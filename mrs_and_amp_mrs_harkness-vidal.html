<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“Look, I don’t care about how we feel about each other in our personal lives, but during missions, we are so disgustingly in love people would write movies about us, got it? You’re going to blow the whole mission.”</p><p>Rio’s head jerked back at that. “I’m going to blow the whole mission? I’ve been the only one doing anything!”</p><p>Agatha’s hand clenched around the door knob. “And what makes you say that?”</p><p>Red began to taint Rio’s skin. “I’ve been looking for our mission target.” Rio leaned in closer, her face inches away from Agatha’s, “Whilst you’ve been…what? Playing catch up with friends.”</p><p>Agatha smirked.</p><p>“Something funny?” Rio asked, her breath hot against Agatha’s face.</p><p>Or: The Smith's Programme, the only programme in the FBI that forces you to marry a complete and utter stranger whom you must complete top-secret missions with. As soon as the two women lay eyes on each other, it is clear Rio Vidal and Agatha Harkness are attracted to one another. But is it just that, or will they inevitably fall in love? Time will tell.</p><p>Based on the TV show version of Mr &amp; Mrs Smith.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I binge-watched the whole of Mr &amp; Mrs Smith for the first time yesterday and I immediately thought about how much it would eatttt if Rio and Agatha were forced into that situation...so here it is. Enjoy ;)</p></blockquote>

<p>
<em>Hihi, welcome.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio sat and stared at the large white screen before her.<br/>
</p><p>Was this really happening? Was she really doing this?<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes darted around the clinically white room (or shoe box) with no windows before her eyes landed back on the screen again.<br/>
</p><p>The screen whirled before a drawer shot out of the base making Rio jump, her hand flew up to her heart. She scolded herself for it. Wasn’t she an FBI agent? Had been an FBI agent for years before she got pulled from the main field and had been reduced to The Smith’s Programme.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re too brutal for this, Vidal,” her former boss had told her. “You are like Death personified; you detach too easily from the living. You’d be better suited elsewhere.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at the memory. Weren’t you <em>supposed<em> to be detached to be an FBI agent or at least a good one?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>An instruction flashed on the screen:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Insert nail clipping.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio fumbled around in her bag around her shoulder until she pulled out a small plastic lock bag with her nail clipping. She pushed the packet into the drawer and watched it snap shut.<br/>
</p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “Erm…so do I just-”<br/>
</p><p>She cut herself off when the screen flashed black before returning to its blinding white.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>How tall are you?<em> The screen asked.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“Five foot, six. Eight if you give me some good heels,” she laughed awkwardly. At the end of the day, she was talking to a fucking machine. How much more awkward could this possibly get?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Where did you grow up?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Brooklyn…New York.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Are you willing to relocate?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said hastily. She hated how fast that came out. She tried again, “I mean yes. I have no problem relocating.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Tell us why you are the perfect agent.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Well, isn’t obvious?” Rio teased, her voice dripping with sarcasm. And then she remembered once again…she was talking to a machine. She cleared her throat. “I can detach easily. I can get the job done and move on as if it had never happened. I’ll be prepared to do whatever you ask of me.”<br/>
</p><p>The screen asked Rio what she majored in, in college.<br/>
</p><p>“Endangered plant species…or biology, if you meant in broader terms.” She bit her lip, “I swear we already covered this?”<br/>
</p><p>The next question hit Rio like a punch to the gut.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Why were you dropped from the main field?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She stirred in her seat. Rio felt like she was at a therapy season now and this machine was her therapist. The curser on the screen blinked at her, urging her on.<br/>
</p><p>“They said I was too detached,” Rio hated how small her voice sounded.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe it. She gapped at the brownstone townhouse on the Upper Westside that was now her home. If she knew this is what you got when you joined The Smith’s Programme, she would’ve left the main field on her own accord.<br/>
</p><p>When she was growing up, Rio lived in a tiny apartment above her Abuela’s plant shop. It wasn’t much, but to a child who had been abandoned by their father after their mother had died because they, ‘reminded them too much of her.’ It was everything.<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed before climbing the steps to her new three-story home.<br/>
</p><p>The house had everything she could think of; an open plan kitchen with oak furbishing, a large living room fitted with fine leather sofas, an in-home library. Rio’s new home had a fucking library. She couldn’t believe it and she was only on the first floor.<br/>
</p><p>Rio spotted an elevator down the corridor and made quick work of walking over to it and pushing its only button. The elevator ‘pinged’ moments later and she stepped inside.<br/>
</p><p>The basement had a cinema room, a gym and an inside swimming pool (which she would definitely be getting into the moment she had finished exploring the house). The top floor had three ensuite bedrooms with king-sized beds, a large study with two desks and shelves decked with even more books, and an open rooftop garden.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to sob at the sight of it. She could detach from humans easy, but plants? Just the mere thought of plants stirred up emotions within her. She could see it already, her tending to this garden for hours on end. Perhaps she would hide from her future wife up here if they didn’t get along.<br/>
</p><p>This was the first time Rio had properly thought about it. She was going to be married to a complete stranger by the end of this day. She’d never thought about it, getting married. Not even with her previous girlfriends. She knew with her line of work it would never work.<br/>
</p><p>She scoffed at the irony of it all. Now she was to be married <em>because<em> of her work.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio stared at her new garden for a moment longer before turning on her heels and stepping back through the sliding doors, she wanted to take a dip in the pool.<br/>
</p><p>She entered the bedroom closest to the elevator on her left and was surprised to see most of her clothes as she rummaged through the drawers and wardrobes. How did they get these? She knew better not to question it.<br/>
</p><p>Finally, she found her bathing suits. She settled on a forest green two-piece, grabbed a towel from the bathroom and made her way to the elevator.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate before diving head-first into the decent-sized pool. She loved swimming, it reminded her of summers spent at the community pool whilst her Abuela scolded her for walking around without flip-flops.<br/>
</p><p>She emerged from the water, pushing her dark hair back with both her hands. She took in her surroundings, smiling and splashing. How this was her life, she couldn’t have told you.<br/>
</p><p>Rio spent almost an hour in the pool. She was sure she would’ve stayed longer until she remembered her future wife would be coming home in the evening, and she probably shouldn’t meet her in a bikini.<br/>
</p><p>She climbed up the ladder of the pool, smoothing her hair. Rio walked in the direction of her towel on top of a sunbed before she froze. Her brown eyes locking with deep blue ones.<br/>
</p><p>Shit.<br/>
</p><p>The woman before her was devastatingly beautiful. Her face crossed the line between being soft and ethereal and strong with sharp features. Rio figured whichever one dominated would be down to the expression the woman wore.<br/>
</p><p>The light-washed jeans and white tight-fitted button-up blouse hugged her figure in all the right places, and Rio had to remind herself three times that she could not allow herself to stare at the woman’s chest regardless of how her top buttons were undone and she could see the purple lace bra she wore poking out at the top.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t miss, however, the way the other woman was eyeing her up too. Would this be a problem? She kind of assumed she’d get put with someone she wouldn’t be attracted to, or if she were she could simply acknowledge it and then ignore it completely like white noise.<br/>
</p><p>There would be no ignoring how attracted Rio was to this woman, but it was fine because she had mastered the art of detachment…hadn’t she?<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” the other woman said. “For barging in. I didn’t realise you would be swimming.”<br/>
</p><p>It was only then Rio realised she had failed to grab the towel to cover herself.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>How tall are you?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Seriously? Agatha thought. She had already put all of this in her file, she didn’t understand why she needed to repeat herself to a fucking robot.<br/>
</p><p>She let out a short huff, “Five-three.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Where did you grow up?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“The Upper East Side, New York,” she replied flatly.<br/>
</p><p>The screen's next question caught her completely off guard.<br/>
</p><p>“Willing to relocate?” She stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>How far was that? How far away would she be from him? She couldn’t leave him.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t have a choice.<br/>
</p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat before saying a weak, “Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Tell us why you are the perfect agent.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>This she answered easily. “I kill for sport. I’m the best gunman or woman to come out of the field in decades.”<br/>
</p><p>A breakup that happened a year prior to Agatha sitting in a chair in a shoe box room in the FBI headquarters had landed her in this position. She had been so caught up in her own stupid emotions she royally fucked up. She shot the wrong person, a high-profile politician.<br/>
</p><p>Her bosses had to bend over backwards to get her out of it. She had to go through multiple rounds of interrogations to confirm she wasn’t a foreign spy; she was forced into therapy to get her head straight and her gun license had been revoked until her bosses pushed for her to join The Smith’s Programme.<br/>
</p><p>And now here she was.<br/>
</p><p>She wouldn’t have chosen it, but it was the only way she would’ve been allowed back into the field. Agatha would rather die than go into any other occupation.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What was your major in college?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Criminology with History,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>She rolled her eyes so far into the back of her head at the next question. “It’s in my fucking file.”<br/>
</p><p>The screen continued to flash.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tipped her head back before answering, “I made a fatal mistake,” in a mocking tone.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha arched a brow at the brownstone townhouse in front of her. She wasn’t a stranger to the architecture of the Upper Westside considering only Central Park separated her from this neighbourhood when she was growing up. When she was younger, she always used to wonder what it would be like to live in a multistorey house instead of the penthouse she was raised in.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shoved the memory of her past away, there was no need to open that can of worms right before she was about to start her new life.<br/>
</p><p>She explored the house briefly, starting with the top floor and ending with the basement. As she made her way down in the elevator towards it, she was satisfied with the fact that she must be the first one there. That her future wife would join her later.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know how she felt about it, being married. She’d sworn off all relationships after the last one. But did it matter? They weren’t <em>actually<em> married, legally yes, emotionally and physically no.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>…Well, she’d see about the physically part.<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t until she’d caught a glimpse of a figure behind the glass door to their swimming pool that Agatha realised, she was sorely mistaken. She in fact was not the first one to arrive.<br/>
</p><p>Was <em>that<em> her wife?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She watched the woman emerge out of the pool. It looked straight out of a movie the way the water dripped off of her tanned skin, slid off her toned abs, smoothed over her dark hair.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe this Smith’s Programme wasn’t so bad after all.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had to make sure her expression was void of all the swirling thoughts she had about the beautiful woman as brown wide eyes locked onto hers.<br/>
</p><p>Shit.<br/>
</p><p>Was she intruding? What a terrible first impression.<br/>
</p><p>It was then Agatha got a good look at the woman’s face. It was even more beautiful than she had previously thought. Maybe her opticians were right, she should start wearing her glasses more often.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha went to apologise before she noticed the woman staring at her chest. 
</p><p>She smirked before apologising anyway, “Sorry, for barging in. I didn’t realise you would be swimming.”<br/>
</p><p>The other woman grabbed at the towel on the sunbed, hastily wrapping it around herself. Agatha turned away to afford her some privacy even though it was far too late for that.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s okay,” the woman replied when she was appropriately covered.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m Agatha,” she extended her arm out toward her.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio,” Rio took Agatha’s hand, shaking it.<br/>
</p><p>Rio, Agatha thought. It suits her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t believe she was saying the words coming out of her mouth. “Did you want to get dressed? I’m pretty sure there is some stuff we need to sort out in the study, and we have to do the whole marriage thing.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “Erm…yeah. Meet you in the study in ten?”<br/>
</p><p>“Course,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman produced Agatha a warm smile before scurrying past her into the house.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss the way Rio smelt as she ran past. Mixed with the undeniable scent of chlorine she smelt sandalwood, pine and vanilla. Agatha had to resist the urge to chase after Rio, grab her and sniff her.<br/>
</p><p>She jerked her head back.<br/>
</p><p>Hello? Had she not remembered the last time she fell in love? Agatha swore she would never do it again. But was wanting to sniff someone a sign of potential love? She didn’t think so, only mere lust. She’d only spoken five words to the woman.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha made her way to the study on the third floor. Whilst she waited, she did a more in-depth survey of the place. She pushed hidden buttons that revealed arsons of weapons. She almost drooled at the different riffles. There was a bottle of a whisky Agatha knew cost a fortune because her father had it on display at the front of his alcohol cabinet which he only drank on special occasions.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled it out of the velvet box it was placed in and pulled at the tag attached to the neck of the bottle.<br/>
</p><p>“What does it say?” A voice came from behind her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to see Rio, unfortunately, dressed in a dark brown tank top and sweatpants. Agatha tried to ignore the fact she wasn’t wearing a bra.<br/>
</p><p>She cleared her throat, “It says, ‘Enjoy your first day of marriage.’”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha peered into the box to find two gold wedding bands tucked away at the bottom. She retrieved them, setting the bottle down on the table before handing a ring to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman nodded in response.<br/>
</p><p>“And this must be the marriage certificate,” Rio pointed at the white sheet of paper on the desk closest to where she stood.<br/>
</p><p>Rio walked over to it, eyeing Agatha to do the same.<br/>
</p><p>Once at the table, the two women grabbed a pen each and signed.<br/>
</p><p>It was done. They were married.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, great,” Agatha said, sliding her ring onto the rightful finger as if she had just agreed to go grocery shopping instead of legally attaching herself to a woman she didn’t know.<br/>
</p><p>“I guess we’re married now,” Rio said awkwardly.<br/>
</p><p>“Now don’t sound so disappointed,” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t miss the way Rio tried to stifle her chuckle at her remark.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha clicked at the laptop next to the marriage certificate and it whirled to life. The screen flashed white before it said:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Hihi, Mrs &amp; Mrs Smith, congratulations on your marriage.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>You are now ready for your first mission.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio wriggled her eyebrows, the first thing she did that seemed to genuinely showcase her personality. Agatha couldn’t help but feel the slightest bit excited at the possibility of getting to know this woman more.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you ready, Mrs Smith?” Rio asked her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Always, Mrs Smith.”</p>

<p>Rio snuggled further into her bed, her thought process being that if she buried herself deeper into her covers, she would fall asleep. She needed to, her and Agatha’s first mission was tomorrow, and she wanted to be well rested.<br/>
</p><p>After what felt like days of tossing and turning, she gave up. She flicked on the lamp on her bedside table and grabbed her book <em>(Rooftop Gardening: Hidden Secrets)<em> that she had taken from the library and rested her back on her headboard. Rio hoped reading would help her fall asleep. She didn’t understand why she was so nervous. She had been on numerous missions before, why would this one be any different?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It was different because this time she had a wife.<br/>
</p><p>Just then said wife knocked on her bedroom door. Rio suggested they sleep in separate beds; Agatha didn’t disagree although Rio did catch the slight disappointment in her voice.<br/>
</p><p>“Come in,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stepped inside. She was wearing a deep purple short-sleeved silk button-up night shirt and matching shorts.<br/>
</p><p>“I just wanted to tell you goodnight,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stirred. Was it hot in here? “Goodnight,” she said as she lifted her hair which was falling past her shoulders into a ponytail on top of her head.<br/>
</p><p>She knew she shouldn’t have. She was only wearing a thin tank and by lifting up her hair she was revealing her uncovered breasts to Agatha. She was giving the other woman an invitation to look at the buds that would be poking through her top.<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew and she did it anyway.<br/>
</p><p>She <em>wanted<em> Agatha to look. This wasn’t very detached of her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio licked her lips as she watched Agatha’s eyes drop to where she wanted them to and then return her blue gaze to her brown.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow, Rio shrugged in response.<br/>
</p><p>'Your move,' Rio said without saying it.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha regarded her for a long moment, her eyes flicking between Rio’s chest, lips and eyes.<br/>
</p><p>A smirk painted Agatha’s lips before she walked over to the bed and perched herself on the edge.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head, “You’re too far.”<br/>
</p><p>“Am I now?” Agatha teased. She pulled the covers off of Rio’s legs, reached over to where she was sat, grabbed at her waist and slid her across the bed towards her.<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t surprise Rio that Agatha was strong regardless of her height and physique.<br/>
</p><p>The two women held each other in each other’s arms for a moment simply staring at one another.<br/>
</p><p>Fuck, Rio thought. Agatha and those deep blue eyes were going to be a big fucking problem.<br/>
</p><p>“Is it bad I’ve been thinking about kissing you all day?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio prayed she wasn’t blushing. She shrugged, “Why are you thinking about it still? Just do it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed at that. “Excellent point.”<br/>
</p><p>And before Rio could think, Agatha brought her lips to hers.<br/>
</p><p>Shit. Shit. Shit.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was in big fucking trouble.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s soft lips attacked hers with a ferocity she had never experienced before, not even with the girlfriends she had dated for years. Not once had they kissed her the way Agatha was kissing her now after not even twenty-four hours of knowing each other.<br/>
</p><p>Rio grabbed at the long, dark, thick locks of the woman that she had wanted to run her hands through the moment she had laid eyes on her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha moaned into Rio’s mouth. “You taste…so…<em>good<em>,” she got out in between wet kisses.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio whimpered at her words. She was in <em>big<em> fucking trouble.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio woke with a start.<br/>
</p><p>Her sheets stuck to her skin, sweat dampened her forehead, a ball of tension was wedged between her legs.<br/>
</p><p>Really? A sex dream about her new wife already? How was she going to survive this marriage?<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew she couldn’t give in to her desire; it would just mess up the whole thing…right? Like it wouldn’t make sense for her to cross that line with Agatha because it would mess with their professional dynamic.<br/>
</p><p>She could always get a new partner; Rio thought it would be worth it…<br/>
</p><p>No, no.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wouldn’t, <em>couldn’t<em>.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She was a good agent, she had never had a problem with professionalism before and she would not start today, even for the most beautiful woman she had ever laid eyes on.<br/>
</p><p>To get through this, all Rio had to do was detach. She could do that easy. That meant, no getting to know Agatha and no letting Agatha get to know her. That meant keeping all conversations work-related and avoiding her at all costs around the house. The attraction to her wouldn’t go away but at least Rio could keep it to just that, mere attraction.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Their first mission was to deliver a package to an address Hihi would give them once they had received the package. The package in question would be carted around by an elderly woman who would be going to collect it at a café five blocks from their house.<br/>
</p><p>According to Hihi, the woman would be collecting the package at ten am.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Rio got to the café at eight.<br/>
</p><p>Rio ordered a double espresso, and an all butter croissant and Agatha ordered a flat white with an almond croissant. The two women sat with their eyes glued to the café door simultaneously sipping their coffees and eating their pastries.<br/>
</p><p>Twenty minutes passed and both pastries were finished. Rio wouldn’t have minded except having food in her mouth stopped Agatha from trying to talk to her. At any moment, Agatha might try to initiate a conversation with her. She didn’t want that.<br/>
</p><p>“So,” Agatha said after another ten minutes of silence.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“How did you sleep?”<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” was Rio’s short response. She tried to ignore the way Agatha’s head jerked slightly at her abrupt bluntness.<br/>
</p><p>Neither woman spoke for a beat, the sounds of the café filled their ears until Agatha said, “And I slept fine too, thanks for asking.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pretended as if she hadn’t heard, her eyes never left the door she was watching.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha continued to Rio’s dismay. “Where did you grow up?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio fought off the smile that wanted to inch its way onto her lips at the fact that Agatha was not disheartened by her rudeness.<br/>
</p><p>“Can we not,” Rio said. “I’m trying to focus on the mission.”<br/>
</p><p>“The mission hasn’t started yet,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a short huff. “The mission started as soon as we left the house,” she eyed Agatha briefly, watched her furrow her eyebrows before Rio returned her gaze to the door.<br/>
</p><p>There was another stretch of quiet before Agatha said, “So are we just supposed to sit here in silence then?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, we can’t, you won’t shut up,” Rio grit out.<br/>
</p><p>To Rio’s surprise, Agatha laughed. “Okay. Woke up on the wrong side of bed today princess?”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t,” Rio spat. Rio was a lot of things, but a princess was not one of them. The poor abandoned girl who barely survived high school was <em>not<em> a princess. She couldn’t have been if she tried.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>
<em>Agatha narrowed her eyes before nodding.<br/>
</em>
</em>
</p><p>Luckily for Rio, the woman they were waiting for came through the door and Agatha’s attempts at making conversation halted.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Okay…what the fuck?<em><br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>She was supposed to be watching the woman who had just walked in and the man she was having a conversation with, but she couldn’t focus. Her eyes kept falling back on Rio. What had she done between the time the two women had conversed in the study to now that had pissed Rio off so much?<br/>
</p><p>What happened to the prospect of getting to know each other? She had seen it, that little bit of Rio’s personality she had invited her to look at. Would that be it? Was it all just a game to Rio? She’d give Agatha scraps and then snatch those back eventually too?<br/>
</p><p>“She’s leaving,” Rio said, ripping Agatha out of her thoughts.<br/>
</p><p>The two women shuffled out of their respective booths and ran out of the café to chase the elder woman. Agatha spotted her rounding the block to their left. Trying not to break into a sprint, the two darted down the street.<br/>
</p><p>For an elderly woman, she sure moved fast. They kept losing sight of her. Agatha thought maybe the older woman knew she was being followed by the way she kept changing her course of direction so abruptly.<br/>
</p><p>The woman had turned ten corners before she walked into a theatre.<br/>
</p><p>“Shit,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio replied. “I’m going in, you stay out here in case she comes out.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. She fumbled around in her pocket until she found what she was looking for. She lifted her hand up to tuck Rio’s hair behind her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“Woah,” Rio said jerking her head back. “I…you…” she spluttered.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “I was just going to put your com in.” She waved the intercom in front of Rio’s face so she could see it. “Here, sorry. You can put it in.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s face flushed red with embarrassment. “No…erm…it’s okay, you can do it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Are you sure? Because it seems like you don’t want me to-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cut her off. “It’s fine.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes in teasing suspicion before she placed the intercom in Rio’s ear.<br/>
</p><p>“Right…so I’m gonna…” Rio didn’t finish her sentence before she practically bolted into the theatre.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head and laughed. Had she done that on purpose to freak Rio out? Yes. Rio wanted to play games, Agatha could too. Her previous relationship made her a master at them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha heard Rio talking to the ticket warden, he wasn’t letting her in. There was a moment of silence before she heard Rio telling him she found her ticket, she had then asked her ‘mother’ where her ticket was, to which Rio’s fake mother said she had never seen Rio in her life. Agatha heard Spanish in her ear and then the interaction was over.<br/>
</p><p>Rio spoke Spanish? How much hotter could this woman get?<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, so what’s happening?” Agatha said as she paced outside the theatre.<br/>
</p><p>She got no response.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio?”<br/>
</p><p>Her phone vibrated in her pocket.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio:<strong> you know you can’t talk in theatres, right?<br/>
</strong></strong>
</p><p>Agatha snorted. Somehow, she knew Rio was being sarcastic and wasn’t having a dig at her.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha:<strong> Good point. What can you see? Is the woman still there?<br/>
</strong></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio:<strong> she is.<br/>
</strong></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha:<strong> …And?<br/>
</strong></strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio:<strong> nothing. nothings happening.<br/>
</strong></strong>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hands up in the air dramatically.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha:<strong> Okay??? Well, why not?<br/>
</strong></strong>
</p><p>As soon as she had hit send a message from Rio popped up.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio:<strong> okay she’s swapped packages with a woman. this package is bigger.<br/>
</strong></strong>
</p><p>This was followed by:<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio:<strong> she’s leaving, get ready to follow her.<br/>
</strong></strong>
</p><p>Right on cue, the old woman walked out of the theatre meters away from Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>What should she do? Tackle the woman right here and now and get it over with? No, no she couldn’t do that, this had to be done well.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha followed the older woman down the street, grabbing a parcel out of the FedEx delivery van she passed. She turned off the main street into a side alley and ran. She had to get in front of the woman.<br/>
</p><p>The side alley had her come out at the perfect spot meters in front of her target. Agatha walked with her head down just in case the woman recognised her before she pretended to trip. She caught on to the other woman and pulled her to the floor. Both packages fell to the ground.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, I am so sorry,” Agatha apologised. “I’m so clumsy.” She helped her up.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grabbed her package and handed it to the woman. “Are you okay? Do you need help getting to where you are going?”<br/>
</p><p>The old woman shoved Agatha off of her grunting.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, well just let me know,” Agatha called to her retreating form.<br/>
</p><p>She smirked before she picked up the elderly woman’s package, tossing it in the air before catching it again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha heard a laugh. She spun around to see Rio beside herself.<br/>
</p><p>“Did you just tackle an elderly woman? She was pushing seventy.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled; this was the first time she had heard Rio’s laugh. She liked the sound of it.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha held her hands up. “You gotta do what you’ve gotta do.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s phone pinged. She pulled it out from her back pocket and clicked it on.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve got the address for the package, let's go.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The two women stared up at the white mansion before them. This was it? This is where that elderly woman’s package needed to end up? To Agatha, this didn’t add up.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded her head in the direction of the stairs before them and Agatha followed the silent command. Once they had climbed the stairs, Rio knocked on the front door. A scrawny teenage boy opened it, he was dressed in a waiter's uniform.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. <em>What the hell?<br/>
</em></p><p>“We have a package,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“Finally,” the boy ushered them inside. He pointed them towards the kitchen down the hall and then scurried off into the house.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha took in the marble exterior of the place, she hated it, it reminded her of home.<br/>
</p><p>The two women walked into the kitchen where they were met with a circus. Waiters were running about the place, chiefs were screaming at said waiters for running about the place. Agatha and Rio glanced at each other. What was this mission?<br/>
</p><p>They looked severely out of place. Rio was wearing a white fitted long-sleeve top, flared jeans and leather jacket, and Agatha was wearing a light blue button-up blouse, grey blazer and grey work trousers.<br/>
</p><p>“You must have the package,” a woman said, snapping the pair out of their trance.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nudged Agatha in the side with her elbow.<br/>
</p><p>“Er…yes, here,” she said handing it to her.<br/>
</p><p>The woman took it gratefully, placing it on the table.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Rio craned their necks to watch the woman open the package.<br/>
</p><p>When the woman did it revealed…<br/>
</p><p>A cake.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha almost screamed. A cake? A fucking <em>cake?<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>She wanted back into the main field immediately. Fuck The Smith's Programme, the rest of her career would not be spent hand-delivering cakes!<br/>
</p><p>“It’s a bit smudged, did you drop it?” The woman said, pointing at the purple icing that had smeared down the left side of the rectangular white cake.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha clenched her fits.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said hastily. “That was my fault.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hmm,” the woman hummed. “Nothing can be done. Did you want to stay and try some? I’m sure I could sneak you a slice before we serve it to the guests.”<br/>
</p><p>“We’re good, thank you,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s eyes on her, she didn’t care. She was fucking fuming.<br/>
</p><p>Two waiters came over, took the cake and carried it out with the rest of the food headed out of the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay then,” the woman said.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded before pulling Agatha forward by her blazer.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know when her feet started complying but soon, she found herself outside of the house again. She turned to face it still in utter disbelief.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, that was anticlimactic,” Rio mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me about it. I thought our first mission would be-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha got cut off when the house exploded.</p>

<p>A piercing ringing spiked in Rio’s ear. She thought she couldn’t breathe; her face was so smashed against the tarmac that it was becoming harder for air to reach her nostrils. She shifted, trying to get her arms to move so she could push off the ground. She and Agatha had to get out of there.<br/>
</p><p>Against her muscles protests, Rio got her arms to work. She bit her lip to soothe the pain shooting up them as she pushed off the ground.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?” She croaked.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman was already on her feet, her right hand clutching at her side.<br/>
</p><p>“We gotta-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cut herself off when people emerged from the other houses on the street.<br/>
</p><p>Without a word, the two women made their way across the road before breaking into a run. They shot down the sidewalk, neither of them daring to look back to see if anyone was following them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio thought at first, she was imagining it, until Agatha did it again. She laughed. It was breathless and choppy due to the running, but the other woman was in fact laughing. Before she could stop herself, Rio was laughing too.<br/>
</p><p>They looked like maniacs. They were covered in blood, soot and dirt sprinting down the streets of Manhattan laughing hysterically. Rio bet people thought they had just escaped from a psych ward.<br/>
</p><p>It felt like they had ran a half marathon before Agatha told her they should stop. Rio watched as the other woman hunched over, her hands resting on her knees.<br/>
</p><p>She shouldn’t…but she did it anyway. “Are you okay?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stood up. “Yeah,” she blew out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, watching her fake wife stretch.<br/>
</p><p>“And I’m fine too, thanks for asking.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry,” Agatha laughed. “I thought we only had one-sided conversations.”<br/>
</p><p>She was talking about how Rio had acted in the café earlier. Rio stuck her tongue in her cheek as she let out a short laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Sirens sounded in this distance and a chopper appeared in the darkening sky.<br/>
</p><p>“We should clean up. We can’t have people looking for us.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>The two women headed down the street to the Thai restaurant at the end.<br/>
</p><p>Rio tried to ignore how hungry she was as soon as she stepped into the restaurant and was instantly hit with the smell of delicious food. How desperately she wanted to sit at one of the tables, order her favourite Thai dish (Thai green curry that was tempting her as she stared at the menu before her) and eat to her heart's content. She knew she couldn’t. She had literally just blown up a mansion.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you have a toilet?” Rio asked the server at the door. “My wife and I fell over; we need to clean up.”<br/>
</p><p>The server scrunched his face to let them know he called bullshit.<br/>
</p><p>“Here’s fifty,” Agatha said, handing him a fifty-dollar bill.<br/>
</p><p>The server accepted gratefully and pointed them in the direction of the toilet.<br/>
</p><p>Something told Rio Agatha was accustomed to giving people money to get what she wanted. Who was this woman and what had her upbringing been like? Rio knew already that Agatha’s had been nothing like hers.<br/>
</p><p>There was only one toilet, of course there was. The two women shuffled into the tight space and Rio tried not to gag at the smell, or the toilet roll all over the floor. And obviously, there wasn’t a mirror, the one thing they actually needed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled toilet roll off the toilet roll holder and turned the tap to dampen it. The water came out in drips no matter how loose Rio unscrewed the tap. She huffed in frustration before dabbing at her forehead with the tissue. She didn’t know if it was doing any good, she couldn’t fucking see.<br/>
</p><p>“Would you like some help?” Agatha said after a while. “You’re just wiping blood all over your face.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip. She <em>really<em> didn’t want Agatha to touch her, but she couldn’t go out covered in blood.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Yeah…please.”<br/>
</p><p>The other woman nodded, walking over to where Rio stood with her back against the sink. She swallowed; Agatha was so…close.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s fingers brushed the backs of Rio’s as she took the damp tissue. She tried to relax her body when the other woman’s finger gently slid across her forehead to tuck strands of hair behind her ear. She couldn’t help herself; she looked down and was met with a sea of blue staring up at her as Agatha swiped tenderly at Rio’s forehead with the soggy tissue.<br/>
</p><p>She inhaled a shaky breath and forced herself to breathe properly when Agatha’s eyes began slowly flicking between hers. Something pulsed down below, and Rio dug her nails into her palms to steady herself.<br/>
</p><p>“Done,” Agatha said moments later.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had never been more relieved in her life…well, that was until she realised, she should return the favour.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you want me to?” Rio gestured to her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Please,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Hold on, let me check your side first.”<br/>
</p><p>“What-”<br/>
</p><p>Before Agatha could finish her sentence, Rio was pulling up her blue button-up shirt. There was a deep purple bruise blooming on her right rib. She locked eyes with her wife, a silent request to touch. The other woman nodded and as soon as she did, Rio took two fingers and pressed them into Agatha’s skin, she hissed.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio apologised. “Good thing is nothing's broken.” She let her fingers trail up and down the bruise. Agatha was so warm under her cold digits.<br/>
</p><p>When she looked up, she saw blue and promptly snatched her fingers away, clearing her throat before reaching over to the toilet roll next to her and dampening a new piece. Rio then began wiping her fake wife’s face. She wasn’t covered in any blood; she was just dirty and Rio had to resist the urge to stick her thumb in her mouth and wipe away the dirt on Agatha’s face with her saliva the way her Abuela did her when she was younger.<br/>
</p><p>Rio did the best she could with the limited water, but it wasn’t enough.<br/>
</p><p>“I think we’re just going to have to leg it home.”<br/>
</p><p>“We’ll split up,” Agatha told her. “We’re less recognisable then.”<br/>
</p><p>She nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, take off your jacket.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow which made Agatha laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“No, I mean we should change our appearances as best we can.”<br/>
</p><p>Oh…obviously, Rio thought. She didn’t understand why she was second-guessing everything Agatha said and did. She hadn’t made a move on her and yet Rio thought everything she did was just that.<br/>
</p><p>She shrugged off her jacket. Her white top was covered in dirt and blood.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Oh…erm…here.” She started shrugging off her own blazer. “Take the top off and put this on. I’ll climb out the window and you go out the fire exit down the corridor.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio took the blazer from Agatha’s outstretched hand. “Okay…thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “You don’t have to say thank you, we’re married. What’s mine is yours.”<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t want to, she really didn’t, but Rio couldn’t help it. She smiled back.<br/>
</p><p>“See you at home?” Rio asked shyly.<br/>
</p><p>“Where else would I be?” Agatha replied as she started climbing out of the window. “Really anticlimactic, huh.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed before the other woman disappeared into the night.<br/>
</p><p>She stripped off her long-sleeve top and disposed of it in the bin next to her. She then pulled on Agatha’s blazer and did up the middle button to cover herself. It smelt of Agatha, of her perfume. Rio didn’t know what it was, but it smelt like power. Like sex and seduction. She pressed her nose further into the blazer, she would stand in that bathroom sniffing her fake wife’s clothing all night if she could. The scent was addicting, Rio craved it, she…<br/>
</p><p>Shit.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was in big. Fucking. Trouble.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>On the subway home, Rio thought about how best to tackle this situation. She had been doing so well this morning, she was blunt, she hadn’t let Agatha get to know her, and the conversations had been work-related. It was just the way Agatha had taken care of her in that bathroom. Rio was usually the one looking after the people she cared about, mind you that only really meant her Abuela, and more so in the moments leading up to her death.<br/>
</p><p>Either way, Rio didn’t get looked after, and now her fake wife had done just that. And the way Agatha had looked at her when she did so, with such patience and understanding.<br/>
</p><p>No one had ever looked at Rio the way Agatha just had.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>But that wasn’t anything special…right? That was just fake wife stuff…?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She twisted her clasped hands. Her professionalism was slipping away by the minute.<br/>
</p><p>What Rio really wanted to do when she got off the subway was to walk around Central Park for the next hour until she had solidified a plan of action, but she couldn't. She was on a potential watchlist right now and she needed to get off the evidence of her involvement (the blood and dirt on her body).<br/>
</p><p>She entered her house and was met with nothing, had she gotten home before Agatha?<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio called as she put her keys into the key bowl.<br/>
</p><p>No response. She either wasn’t home yet or was in the shower, which is exactly where Rio wanted to be.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had been in the shower for an hour and a half when she finally got out, she was as shrivelled up as a raisin. She didn’t care, she wanted the grime gone. This was a practice of hers after every mission. Rio would make sure the water was scolding before she’d spend over an hour in the shower scrubbing herself raw. She didn’t know what it was about it, but it helped her feel clean, helped her move on.<br/>
</p><p>Helped her detach.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled on grey linen sleep shorts and a red Spider-Man t-shirt she had, had since she was a teenager, wrapped a towel around her head and walked out of her room towards Agatha’s. She wanted to see if she had gotten home…it was for no other reason.<br/>
</p><p>Rio knocked and was met with silence. Against her better judgment, she frowned.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio said as she pushed her fake wife’s bedroom door open.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t there, the room was empty.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was sure she was home. She had been in the shower for over an hour. Rio walked to the elevator and pressed the button to the first floor. When she stepped out, she was hit with the scent of food. Rio’s mouth salved at the smell.<br/>
</p><p>“Hungry?” Agatha’s voice called from the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rounded the corner to see Agatha clean and, in her pyjamas, another silk set except this time it was navy blue.<br/>
</p><p>“Starving,” Rio replied, walking over to their island that was covered in various takeaway containers.<br/>
</p><p>“I got a mix of dishes because I don’t know what you like yet, but,” Agatha licked orange sauce off her thumb before she handed Rio a container. “This ones yours.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped in disbelief. “How…how did you-?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed, “I saw the way you were staring at it on the menu back in the restaurant. You were practically drooling.”<br/>
</p><p>She blinked at the Thai green curry in her hands.<br/>
</p><p>Not once in her life.<br/>
</p><p>Rio could feel herself crossing the line between professionalism and not.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t care.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s okay,” Agatha replied as if it were nothing.<br/>
</p><p>But to Rio, this was everything.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The two women sat on opposite sides of their largest leather couch. Rio had brought down blankets from their storage cupboard and Agatha had plated up their Thai food into pasta bowls. Jazz music played from the record player in the corner of their living room that Agatha had figured out how to work.<br/>
</p><p>She had noticed that Rio kept stealing little glances at her. Did she have something on her face? She must’ve done. The way Rio had acted this morning made it clear she had intended to toy with her and that was it. Agatha wanted to feel the same.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t sure she could.<br/>
</p><p>It was all so…easy, with Rio. Did that make her stupid? Agatha thought so. This was day two of their marriage and she barely knew the woman, but it was just the way Rio had laughed at her antics earlier, the way she had taken over back at the mansion when Agatha had been close to choking someone, the way she had looked at her in that bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>Like she was grateful for Agatha being there. That she <em>wanted<em> Agatha there.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It had been a long time since Agatha had felt wanted by anyone…well, except for him.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t had much luck in the love department. She hadn’t gotten it from her parents during her childhood, she hadn’t committed to anyone in her teens only fucked around with almost every girl in her very catholic private school and had only been in one relationship, and that had ended in utter shit.<br/>
</p><p>Why would Rio be any different? It was evident her fake wife wasn’t interested in her past their mutual attraction…<br/>
</p><p>But then why was she staring at her?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed, “What? What is it?”<br/>
</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio said around her mouthful of spring roll.<br/>
</p><p>“You keep looking at me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio coughed before swallowing her food. “Was I? I don’t think-”<br/>
</p><p>“You know, for a secret agent you really are bad at lying.”<br/>
</p><p>“I…” Rio started. “I’m not bad at lying when it counts.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed at that. “So, this doesn’t qualify?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip as Agatha watched her try to suppress a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>The women settled into silence until Rio said, “I know I’ve already asked but how are you doing? How’s your ribs?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fought off the urge to smile at her fake wife’s newfound concern. “They’re fine. I’m okay, not my first explosion.”<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me about it,” Rio said shifting to sit up further like an eager kid preparing to listen to a bedtime story. “About your first explosion.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Okay. My partner and I had to disable a bomb in this warehouse. I can’t remember what happened exactly all I know is one of us accidentally set off the timer. We had to get out, there wasn’t enough time for us to disable it. It was the first mission I ever failed. I promised myself I wasn’t going to make it a habit.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“But I did get a cool scar,” Agatha put down her food on the table and lifted up her shirt to reveal a zig-zag line on the edge of the left side of her pelvis.<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip at the sight of Agatha’s exposed skin. “That’s…yeah…that is a cool scar,” she got out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled her shirt down. “What about you? What was your first explosion?”<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…this was it. I don’t think the practice tests we did in FBI training count.”<br/>
</p><p>“They do if you want them to,” Agatha smiled. “Okay, since we are no longer having one-sided conversations let's start again. Tell me something about yourself.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stirred. Agatha could tell by her face that there was a conflict Rio was fighting in her head. She watched the other woman in silence, letting the jazz music fill the void. Agatha wouldn’t push Rio she realised. If she didn’t want to talk that would be okay, she would wait until she was ready.<br/>
</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, “I grew up in Brooklyn, my favourite colour is green, and I like cats.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow, a smile on her lips. “Wow, you really hit me with all the deep stuff.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed at that. “Now your turn.”<br/>
</p><p>“I grew up in the Upper East Side, my favourite colour is purple, and I also like cats but prefer rabbits.”<br/>
</p><p>“<em>You<em>…like…bunnies?” Rio gaped in disbelief.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a short laugh. “I’m sorry that was unexpected. You look like you would own a Rottweiler or a Doberman Pinscher or something.”<br/>
</p><p>“I do?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah. You’ve got that intimidating look, those type of dogs match the vibe.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “The vibe?”<br/>
</p><p>“Exactly.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not sure if that’s a compliment or not but thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>“It is,” Rio reassured her. “Beautiful women with scary dogs,” she kissed her fingers the way chiefs did when they made a meal that tasted good.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smirked; she couldn’t help herself. “You think I’m beautiful?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s face fell as she shrank into herself after she realised what she’d said. She bit her lip nervously before her expression turned into a scowl. “You own a mirror.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“I think one of the neighbours has a cat so look out for it, I saw it in the garden this morning.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stood up, walked to the other side of the couch where Rio sat, lifted up her legs, sat down and replaced Rio’s legs on top of hers fixing the blanket over them.<br/>
</p><p>She was being very bold, and she knew it, but Rio hadn’t shown any signs of being uncomfortable.<br/>
</p><p>“I took a photo, I’ll show you, so you know what it looks like,” Agatha said, pulling her phone out of her pocket.<br/>
</p><p>She clicked it on and was about to tap on the camera roll icon when both women froze. The contact ID <em>Baby<em> popped up on Agatha’s screen.</em></em></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio stared up at the ceiling above her bed. The sun streamed in from the slight gap in her curtains. The same thought from last night ran laps around her head:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha practically leapt off the couch last night when she got that call. Rio thought her fake wife must be sick in the head. Who in their right mind flirted with someone like that when they were in a whole relationship? You weren’t even allowed to <em>be<em> in any other relationships. You were supposed to have cut off all connections from your past life when you joined The Smith’s Programme. They weren’t even allowed to keep their previous surnames for goodness sake.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Why didn’t this woman take anything seriously?<br/>
</p><p>Rio wasn’t looking forward to their next mission later that night. One, she didn’t want to be around Agatha; two, they had to go to an art exhibition and auction at The Met. She’d gotten the text from Hihi early that morning:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Hihi, good morning, Mrs &amp; Mrs Smith.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Your mission this evening will be to attend the Liza Décor exhibition and auction at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. There you will need to sedate a man named Peter Johnson, drive him to a safehouse and leave him there. An address will be provided once you obtain him.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>It is imperative that you only inject him with ONE dose of the sedative.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>The dress code is black tie, please wear one of the pieces we have bought for you.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>An art exhibition at The Met meant they were probably going to be surrounded by rich pricks, Rio thought Agatha would fit right in.<br/>
</p><p>She spent most of the day sitting in the garden reading her book about how to look after said garden. A cat had visited her briefly. She figured this was the cat Agatha was talking about last night, the cat she would’ve shown her until her <em>Baby<em> rang her. Rio didn’t know who this <em>Baby<em> was, but she hated her.<br/>
</em></em></em></em></p><p>Rio blinked. Was that…jealousy?<br/>
</p><p>No. No, it couldn’t be.<br/>
</p><p>Disturbed, Rio went back into the house and into the unoccupied bedroom to pick out her outfit for the evening. Her fingers brushed the material of the items as she walked up and down the racks in the walk-in closet.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t know if she wanted to wear a suit or a dress. Rio loved a good suit; they were comfortable and flattering. You couldn’t go wrong with a dress either though. All she knew was that she wanted to make Agatha squirm when she saw her, wanted her to feel sick because she couldn't have her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wondered if Agatha’s lover was prettier than her.<br/>
</p><p>Woah. She needed to stop that. She was acting like a psycho ex. She and Agatha weren’t <em>actually<em> together.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio pushed at some of the gowns on the rack in front of her until her eyes snagged on something that made her eyes widen.<br/>
</p><p>That was it. That was what she was going to wear tonight.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gaped at her, her mouth open, eyes blinking rapidly.<br/>
</p><p>“You look…”<br/>
</p><p>“Do you have the sedative?” Rio cut her off, ignoring the way her fake wife was practically foaming at the mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Good. That was exactly what Rio wanted. She wore a tight-fitted red dress that reached her ankles. It had one strap that crossed over her chest which exposed her entire left shoulder and most of her right. What sold her the most when she had picked out the dress, however, was the huge slit that reached the top of her right thigh exposing her leg.<br/>
</p><p>She had watched Agatha’s eyes drop there immediately as she'd stepped out of the elevator.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grabbed her purse from the table and shook it. “It’s all here.”<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect. Let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha offered to drive; Rio didn’t object. The car ride was awkward, neither woman spoke. It was clear Agatha had no intention of telling Rio about who had called her last night. She hadn’t attempted to seek her out during the day, and it seemed like she wasn’t going to bring it up now. And that would’ve been fine because Rio had planned to spend the entire evening tormenting her, except Agatha looked <em>so<em> good.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She wore a rich brown corseted suit with a scandalously low neckline that showed off the edge of her breasts because of fucking course she wasn’t wearing a bra. What really made Rio want to get on her hands and knees for her was the red lipstick that painted Agatha’s lips. It matched the red on her dress perfectly.<br/>
</p><p>How had she done that? Did she know what she would be wearing tonight?<br/>
</p><p>Rio spent the journey fidgeting with her fingers to stop herself from reaching out and touching Agatha. She was in hell. <em>She<em> was the one who was supposed to be torturing Agatha all night not the other way round.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha pulled up at the drop-off zone and handed their car keys to the valet, warning him not to scratch their new black Land Rover.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared up at the steps before her. As much as she hated to admit it, she was nervous. Not about the mission, never about the mission. She was nervous about having to be around New York elite. Would she know what to say? How to act right? She needed to blend in, seem like she belonged because if she didn’t, she risked screwing up the whole mission.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looping her arm in Rio’s made her jump.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on then,” Agatha said as she tugged Rio up the stairs.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha dropped off Rio’s coat at the coat check once they had gotten inside and the pair ventured further into the building, their arms still linked. They entered the first display room and Rio practically shoved Agatha off her. The other woman blinked at her, and she pretended not to notice.<br/>
</p><p>The truth was, having Agatha pressed against her body would <em>not<em> end well. Rio didn’t trust herself not to do something stupid like kiss her. She had a job to do and that was that.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Let’s split up and look for Peter, we’ll cover more ground that way,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t we need-”<br/>
</p><p>She walked away before Agatha could finish her sentence.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pushed down her imposter syndrome and began to walk around The Met as if she owned the place. If she was being honest with herself, she needed to get over herself. She was a federal agent for fucksake, she’d done missions like this before, just because she was in her home state didn’t make it any different (it did). Still. She needed to suck it up.<br/>
</p><p>Luckily, all the serious names in the art business had been forced to wear name badges. All she had to do was keep her eyes peeled for a Peter Johnson. Hihi had been sparse with their information, the text they received before they left the house was that they were looking for a white middle-aged man. The only problem was…most middle-aged white men had the last name Johnson or the first name Peter. Rio’s eyes kept snagging on the names but none of them were together.<br/>
</p><p>A server passed her with champagne glasses on their tray and Rio snatched at one and practically inhaled the whole thing. She probably shouldn’t be drinking on the job, but one glass wouldn’t hurt.<br/>
</p><p>In the corner of the room she was in, a man with his back turned stared at a painting of bluebells. This immediately caught Rio’s attention, whilst everyone was mingling, this man had chosen solitude. Why? Rio was about to find out.<br/>
</p><p>She stopped in front of a painting of monkeys two paintings down from him. She still couldn’t see his full face or his name badge. The only thing Rio had gotten from her quick glances was that he wore glasses, and his lips jut out from his face. She inched closer to him ready to make an advance when:<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!”<br/>
</p><p>She turned and found Agatha making her way towards her with a man. Her eyes dropped to his name tag. ‘Samuel Jacobs’, it read, not Peter Johnson, so who was this and why was Agatha bringing him towards her?<br/>
</p><p>“Samuel, Rio. Rio, Samuel,” Agatha said gesturing between the pair.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi…nice to meet you,” Rio said awkwardly.<br/>
</p><p>“You too. Never in a million years did I think Aggs here would end up settled down. Not after her antics during school.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Oh, yes sorry. Rio this is an old friend of mine.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, yeah…of course one of Agatha’s friends just happens to be in the art business.<em><br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>She nodded in acknowledgement. “Well, it was nice to meet you, but I don’t want to interrupt-”<br/>
</p><p>“Nonsense,” Samuel cut her off. “Stay with us I want to know how you survive being married to this one,” he jabbed his thumb towards Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed dryly before she shot Agatha an irritated look. They had a mission to get on with and…oh great. Rio had turned and her top running candidate for Peter Johnson had gone.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s settled then. We’ll look around the exhibition together,” Samuel said, clearly not reading the room.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio spent the next half an hour swatting away Agatha’s hand whenever she tried to touch her and zoning in and out of conversations as she continued her search for their mission subject. She was starting to get more and more aggravated by Agatha by the minute. She didn’t appear to be doing anything to help complete the mission, she was just playing catch-up with old friends.<br/>
</p><p>Rio suspected this was how Agatha usually spent most evenings before she joined the FBI, prancing around in events such as this one getting stupidly drunk with all her stupid friends.<br/>
</p><p>A server came round with another tray of champagne again and Rio couldn’t help herself. She took a glass off the tray.<br/>
</p><p>“Could you grab me a glass please too, baby?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s whole body jolted, and she accidentally nudged the server in the shoulder, the server then proceeded to drop the entire tray of champagne on the floor.<br/>
</p><p>“I…I’m so sorry,” Rio apologised, stooping to help the server pick up broken glasses.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine,” the server told her. “Please get up ma’am and continue to enjoy your evening. I shall clean this up promptly.”<br/>
</p><p>“Are you sure? I don’t-”<br/>
</p><p>“Please, ma’am.” The server was begging her.<br/>
</p><p>Shit.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, come on,” Agatha said, lifting Rio to her feet. “We’ll be back in a sec we’re just going to head to the bathroom,” she said to Samuel.<br/>
</p><p>He nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tugged Rio out of the room.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, you sick fuck,<em> Rio thought. <em>Calling me baby when that’s what you call your lover.<em><br/>
</em></em></em></em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha dragged her fake wife to the single bathroom on her left, pushed Rio against the door when she’d shut it and locked the door, leaving her hand on the knob to trap her there.<br/>
</p><p>“What the <em>fuck<em> is going on with you?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio shifted beneath her. They were the same height right now. Agatha was wearing heels, Rio was not.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing?” Agatha spat. “You’ve been acting as if you hate me all evening.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha realised she probably did. She’d ran off last night and avoided her all day. But she couldn’t tell Rio about it. <em>Never<em> about that.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>But this was a mission.<br/>
</p><p>“Look, I don’t care about how we feel about each other in our personal lives but during missions, we are so disgustingly in love people would write movies about us, got it? You’re going to blow the whole mission.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s head jerked back at that. “<em>I’m<em> going to blow the whole mission? I’ve been the only one doing anything!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha’s hand clenched around the door knob. “And what makes you say that?”<br/>
</p><p>Red began to taint Rio’s skin. “I’ve been looking for our mission target.” Rio leaned in closer, her face inches away from Agatha’s, “Whilst you’ve been…what? Playing catch up with <em>friends.<em>”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha smirked.<br/>
</p><p>“Something funny?” Rio asked, her breath hot against Agatha’s face.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned forward just as the other woman had done, she watched as Rio’s eyes widened at how close they were. She hastily retreated, her head slamming on the door behind her. Agatha continued her advance, watching Rio squirm beneath her as she tried to free herself from her trap. Agatha didn’t help the situation, instead, she put her free hand beside Rio’s head, trapping her further.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m working on it,” Agatha nodded patronisingly. “But I’m going to need us to put on the performance of our lives out there, okay princess?”<br/>
</p><p>She knew she shouldn’t have, the reason why stared back at her as Rio’s eyes flickered with hurt.<br/>
</p><p>“I told you not to-”<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t care. Rio had pissed her right the fuck off. “Yes, or no?” Agatha cut in.<br/>
</p><p>Rio's eyes turned into slits. Agatha thought Rio might kill her then, she would understand. She deserved it. She was being an ass.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared her down, her dark brown eyes boring into Agatha’s, burning them with her fury.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” she replied through gritted teeth moments later.<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect,” Agatha said with mock enthusiasm before she grabbed Rio and pulled her out of the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wasn’t lying she did have a plan, and she would’ve told Rio it if she hadn’t run off earlier. She just hoped her fake wife didn’t act impulsively…trusted her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha understood she hadn’t given Rio any reason to do so.<br/>
</p><p>They walked back into the room they had been in, and Samuel found them immediately. All evidence of Rio’s accident had vanished.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha slid her arm around Rio’s waist, and together they walked towards him.<br/>
</p><p>“Everything alright?” he asked when they met.<br/>
</p><p>“Course, just wanted to check if Rio had spilt anything down herself.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to the other woman who produced her a forced smile.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m all good,” Rio said, her voice laced with faux sincerity.<br/>
</p><p>“Glad to hear it,” Samuel replied.<br/>
</p><p>“So, you were saying about the pieces you want to buy tonight,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“Ah, yes! Let me show you, my favourites.”<br/>
</p><p>Samuel stopped in front of a large painting that depicted a forest. A steep waterfall took up the right side of the painting and a dazzling full moon took up centre stage in the night sky.<br/>
</p><p>"This is what everyone will be bidding on tonight,” Samuel said enthusiastically.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. That’s when she felt Rio’s hand slide underneath hers to wrap around her own waist.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Okay, good. She’s actually doing this.<em><br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“And do you see these Cedar trees,” Samuel said pointing at them.<br/>
</p><p>“Pine,” Rio mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“What was that?” Samuel asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pressed Agatha against her side, a nervous impulse Agatha thought.<br/>
</p><p>“Those are Pine trees,” Rio said. “You can tell by the way the leaves are thin and pointed. Cedar leaves are much wider than that, lighter in colour too.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow impressed.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm,” Samuel hummed. “Thanks for telling me, now I won’t look like an idiot explaining this thing to buyers.”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s if you get it,” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, come on, Aggs. Have I ever not gotten what I wanted?”<br/>
</p><p>“You didn’t get me,” she grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“I liked you before I found out you were a lesbian, that doesn’t count.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha heard Rio trying to stifle a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Well…”<br/>
</p><p>“Anyways,” Samuel cut in loudly. “The Pine leaves– thank you Rio– took Liza four years to paint.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen. “Four years? Why-?” She cut herself off when Rio’s hand on her hip dropped to her ass.<br/>
</p><p>“Why…?” Samuel prompted.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…” Fuck what was she saying? Agatha couldn’t remember anything since-<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s hand gently rubbed against her left ass cheek. Back and forth, back and forth.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tried to shift out of her grasp but that only made Rio press firmer into her soft flesh, trapping her against her.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs?” Samuel said.<br/>
</p><p>He was to the side of them, he couldn’t see the cruel torture her fake wife was making her endure.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, sweetheart. What were you saying?” Rio urged. Her expression smug.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, you sick fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“I…I was saying…” she couldn’t breathe. Rio had added more pressure as she stroked. “I don’t think I was saying anything,” Agatha got out. “Continue…please.”<br/>
</p><p>“Are you sure?” Samuel turned to her.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…” Rio squeezed. “Yep…yep,” Agatha said. “Go on.”<br/>
</p><p>He eyed her over Rio’s head for a moment before he finally turned away.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, so as I was saying…”<br/>
</p><p>Samuel’s voice faded to nothing as Agatha tried to pull Rio’s hand off of her. Rio would let go for a moment only to replace her hand seconds later.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Rio whispered, her voice playful after Agatha’s fourth attempt of trying to free herself. “You thought you could talk to me the way you did in that bathroom and get away with it?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was about to shoot her a reply when Samuel cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>“Ah! Johnson!”<br/>
</p><p>She turned to see Samuel getting ready to bear hug the man, their mission target.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“Told you I was working on it,” Agatha said smugly before snatching Rio’s hand off her body.</p>

<p>Somehow, Rio knew exactly what to do. After the group had exchanged greetings and handshakes, Rio was keeping Samuel busy whilst Agatha hung back with their mission target…or…Peter. It was Agatha’s plan all along, to get Peter in a one-on-one conversation. She had forgotten to tell Rio in the bathroom because things had gotten a little…heated. But now it didn’t matter. Rio knew.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha briefly wondered if her fake wife could read her mind.<br/>
</p><p>“So…how do you know Samuel?” Peter asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to face him. She was still shocked by his appearance. She had imagined a lanky man with glasses and patches of grey hair like Samuel. Peter was the complete opposite. He looked like Captain America. Why a Captain America look-alike was needed by the FBI was beyond her.<br/>
</p><p>“We went to school together,” she replied.<br/>
</p><p>“I thought he went to an all-boys school,” he laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“He did. Our schools were run by the same people, and we did chapel together.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh,” Peter pointed a finger at her in recognition. “You went to St Ives.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hands out before doing jazz hands as if to say ‘ta-da.’<br/>
</p><p>“Yes!” Peter laughed. “Were you a goody two shoes or a complete party animal?”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah the only two options,” Agatha laughed. “Guess.”<br/>
</p><p>He stepped back examining her with mock seriousness. “Goody two shoes,” Peter said with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>She laughed again.<br/>
</p><p>“Nah you were definitely a party animal.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha locked eyes with Rio over Peter’s shoulder. She was scowling at her, but it wasn’t…what was that? That look she was giving her?<br/>
</p><p>“Am I right?” Peter asked, snapping her back to the conversation.<br/>
</p><p>“Obviously,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“And what about now? Do you still have it in you?” His gaze dropped to her lips, then to her exposed chest.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to punch him. What was wrong with men? She had just introduced him to her wife twenty minutes ago. She suppressed her eye roll and focused on the mission.<br/>
</p><p>“Of course.”<br/>
</p><p>Peter threw his head back in relief. “Thank god. Samuel’s gone soft but it looks like I won’t need him after all.”<br/>
</p><p>He leaned forward, his lips brushing the shell of her ear. She had to force herself not to shudder, or to knee him in the dick.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanna go somewhere and have some real fun? I’ve got,” he pulled back enough so she could see him mime snorting something up his nose.<br/>
</p><p>A slow smile slid across Agatha’s lips. This was too easy.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s go,” she said.<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect.” He grabbed her hand and pulled her towards Samuel and Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha and I…are…going to look at some of the other art…elsewhere,” Peter announced.<br/>
</p><p>Samuel’s eyes darted between the two before it appeared he had connected some dots. “Are you two serious?” He groaned. “You can’t wait?”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t have a clue what you’re talking about,” Agatha shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Neither,” Peter said before he dragged her out of the room.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha managed to get one last look at Rio. She was wearing that face again. Agatha pointed at her ear and Rio nodded in acknowledgement.<br/>
</p><p>As Peter pulled her up a flight of stairs, she discreetly slipped her hand into her pocket, pulled out her intercom and slipped it into her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“Where are we going?”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Peter said.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re dragging me up a flight of stairs in heels I have a right to know,” Agatha laughed breathlessly as they made it onto the landing.<br/>
</p><p>Peter didn’t reply, just pulled her past statues of Greek Gods and Goddesses.<br/>
</p><p>He finally stopped outside of a room called the ‘Anette Room.’<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “We’re going into the Anette Room?”<br/>
</p><p>He scrunched his face as if to say, ‘Well obviously,’ before he laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Peter swung the door open and gestured for her to go inside, he followed suit and shut the door behind them. He fumbled around in his pockets for something. Agatha took this as the perfect opportunity to pull one of the sedatives out of her purse.<br/>
</p><p>She hissed when the needle pricked her palm as she tried to get it ready to use behind her back.<br/>
</p><p>“You alright?” Peter asked through a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Yep,” she smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.” He patted his pockets. “I can’t seem to find it…but oh well.” His smile turned predatory as he stalked over towards her.<br/>
</p><p>He grabbed her by the waist and was about to plant a kiss on her lips before she jammed the sedative into his neck.<br/>
</p><p>It worked in seconds, his large head slumped on her right shoulder.<br/>
</p><p>“Ugh,” Agatha grimaced, rolling her eyes as she tried to push him off.<br/>
</p><p>Rio barged in soon after. She took in the scene and laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Took you long enough,” Agatha said shoving Peter onto the ground.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry. The only details I got were that you were going upstairs and, ‘We’re going into the Anette Room?’” Rio’s impression of Agatha was startlingly accurate.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha adjusted her suit. “I was trying not to be suspicious.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh please,” Rio scoffed. “That man just wanted to get in your pants, you could’ve said anything, and he wouldn’t have cared.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Right, I’m going to get the car. You figure out a way to get him out of here,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “You’re going to make me drag him outside by myself?”<br/>
</p><p>“This was your well-executed plan; you should finish it.”<br/>
</p><p>“What-”<br/>
</p><p>She got cut off when Rio’s phone pinged.<br/>
</p><p>“Shit,” she mumbled when she read it.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>"Hihi sent us the location…”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hands up dramatically, “Yes? What’s the problem?”<br/>
</p><p>“It says we have to drop Peter off by one am.”<br/>
</p><p>“And what’s the time?”<br/>
</p><p>“12:30, but the safe house location is in Lower Manhattan.”<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha muttered. “Alright get the car, stay on coms, I’ll tell you where to pick us up.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, ready to head out the door when Agatha said:<br/>
</p><p>“Wait where’s your gun?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled open the slit of her dress to reveal her covered thigh. There, strapped to the toned, tanned skin sat a gun. Agatha thought it looked so pretty there, like a bow on a Christmas present.<br/>
</p><p>She swallowed involuntarily.<br/>
</p><p>“Did you just swallow at the sight of my thigh?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes locked with dark brown. Rio looked far too smug for her liking.<br/>
</p><p>“Shut up and get the car,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Rio cackled as she left the room.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed, looking down at the unconscious Peter Johnson. This was going to be a challenge and a half. She bent down to sling his arm around her shoulder when her eyes snagged on a plastic bag sticking out of his back pocket. Agatha couldn’t help herself; she pulled out the packet.<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head. It was filled with white powder. “I can’t find it my ass,” she mumbled before stuffing it back in his pocket.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>When Rio pulled up in front of the back entrance Agatha had told her to meet her at, Agatha was panting and drenched from head to toe in sweat.<br/>
</p><p>She rolled down her window. “Erm…maybe I should’ve helped you.”<br/>
</p><p>“You think?” Agatha shrieked. “Just help me get him in the car.”<br/>
</p><p>“How did you do it? Move him?” Rio asked as she got out to help the other woman.<br/>
</p><p>“Dragged him,” Agatha said as she pulled open the passenger door.<br/>
</p><p>“You…what?” Rio said as her knees buckled when Agatha dumped Peter’s entire body weight on her.<br/>
</p><p>“You heard me.” Agatha walked behind Peter and pushed at his back to help get him into the car.<br/>
</p><p>“What did people say?”<br/>
</p><p>“There was no one on the second floor so that was fine. I practically rolled him down the stairs and pretended he fell when I reached the bottom. I did actually have to hold him up whilst we walked passed some of the exhibition rooms, but that was fine. I just told people he had too much to drink.”<br/>
</p><p>With one last push, the two women got Peter into the car.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha slammed the door hard letting out all of her frustration before climbing into the front passenger seat.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re not going to make it,” Agatha huffed when Rio got into the car. “We’ve got fifteen minutes; it takes forty to get to Lower Manhattan from here.”<br/>
</p><p>“We’ll be fine,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you-?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cut her off. “Put your seatbelt on.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at her fake wife’s bossiness but did as she was told. As soon as she had clicked it into place the car lurched forward, and they were off.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hand immediately flew to the grab handle above her head as Rio shot down the street. She watched as the numbers on the dial crept up and up. Fifty miles per hour, sixty miles per hour, seventy, eighty.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha shrieked as they came across their first car.<br/>
</p><p>Rio showed no intention of slowing down.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re going to hit that car!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha caught her rolling her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>The fucking audacity.<em><br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>They were inches away from the car ahead before Rio swerved and entered the lane going in the opposite direction. Agatha slammed her eyes shut when a car in their new lane shot towards them. She couldn’t believe this would be the way she died, at the hands of her fake and reckless wife.<br/>
</p><p>The sound of a horn blaring as it passed got her to open her eyes. Miraculously, they hadn’t died.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was doing ninety now.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you have a death wish?” Agatha screamed.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, calm down we’re fine,” Rio waved her off. “You’re an FBI agent you should be used to this.”<br/>
</p><p>“I am when it’s <em>me<em> driving.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Oh!” Rio said, throwing one of her hands up making the car swerve a little. “So, you’re just a control freak.”<br/>
</p><p>“At least I’m not a-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha slammed into the dashboard in front of her. Peter Johnson slammed into the back of her seat. She looked up to see a twelve-wheeler stopping midway through the crossroad in front of them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio drummed her fingers against the wheel.<br/>
</p><p>Sensing what she might do, Agatha said, “Relax. It’ll move soon.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio appeared to take this as a challenge. She smirked.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you-”<br/>
</p><p>The tiers of their Land Rover screeched as Rio reversed. She put a hand on the back of Agatha’s headrest as she looked behind her and Agatha scolded herself for liking how hot Rio looked when she did so.<br/>
</p><p>The car jolted when Rio hit the curb, jolted again when their back wheel road up it. She spun the wheel, and the car zoomed forward now going down the lane in the opposite direction. Cars behind them honked profusely as they sped away. The Land Rover skidded again when Rio turned onto the street to their left.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t help it, Agatha stared at her fake wife as the city blurred around her. Rio’s hair fell around her face in loose waves, her side profile was set with flawless makeup and her form-fitting red dress hadn’t shifted amidst the commotion. And yet she was driving like a Formula One Driver. There was something so inherently alluring…feminine about it that all Agatha could do was take it all in.<br/>
</p><p>A groan from behind her dragged her attention away from her beautiful wife. She looked to see Peter Johnson starting to stir.<br/>
</p><p>“Shit.”<br/>
</p><p>“What?”<br/>
</p><p>“He’s waking up!”<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Rio said as she almost rammed into the back of a yellow cab. “Did you give him the right amount of sedative?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes! It’s you and your fucking driving.”<br/>
</p><p>“Do you want to make it in time or not?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed. She bent down, putting her hand out to stop herself from slamming into the hard material in front of her as she reached for her purse. She fished around for another dose of the sedative, whirled around and jabbed it into Peter’s back.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice was laced with concern.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>“We were only supposed to give him <em>one<em> dose of the sedative.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The message they had gotten from Hihi flashed in her mind; <em>It is imperative that you only inject him with ONE dose of the sedative.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio said as nonchalantly as she could. “It’s fine he’s like a bear, he probably needed that amount anyways.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said breathlessly. “Yeah…it’s fine.”<br/>
</p><p>“Exactly.”<br/>
</p><p>The women sat in silence, only the noises from the car could be heard.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pushed down harder on the accelerator; the speed dial hit one-twenty.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The two women bolted out of the car at two minutes to one. Agatha yanked open the passenger door and Rio looped her arms underneath Peter’s underarms. She started pulling him out of the car. Agatha had gone around the other side to push at his legs.<br/>
</p><p>Once they had gotten him out of the car they lugged him to the safe house front door. Agatha pounded on it as if she were a police officer preparing to raid a house to look for a wanted criminal.<br/>
</p><p>The door swung open moments later and the two women basically threw Peter Johnson at the waiting FBI agent. The agent nodded them a curt thank you before slamming the door in their faces.<br/>
</p><p>“You could’ve actually said thank you!” Agatha yelled before kicking the door.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at the other woman for a long moment.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha’s eyes locked on to hers, she scowled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t help it, her face split into a toothy grin before she burst out laughing. She caught Agatha rolling her eyes, caught her trying to keep the scowl on her face, caught her snigger.<br/>
</p><p>Soon Agatha was laughing with her. The two women were hunched over with their hands on their knees trying to suck in breaths, so they didn’t suffocate and die.<br/>
</p><p>“You…you almost killed us in the car,” Agatha choked out.<br/>
</p><p>“And you almost killed our mission target,” Rio replied. There was no malice in her voice.<br/>
</p><p>“Shush!” Agatha hissed, swatting Rio in the arm.<br/>
</p><p>“You also rolled him down a flight of stairs!”<br/>
</p><p>Tears were streaming down Agatha’s face. “You bitch! I can’t believe you made me do that by myself.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was hyperventilating now. “I’m…I’m sorry. I should’ve helped you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Yeah, you should have!”<br/>
</p><p>The two women stood outside the safe house laughing for god knows how long until they finally calmed down.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s go home,” Rio sniffled as she wiped tears from her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Please,” Agatha replied as she started making her way towards the car. “Hey, what did you tell Samuel?”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, shit! I told him I needed to pee and that I’d be back in a second. I should’ve said something else he’s probably wondering where we all are.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, no shit,” Agatha laughed as she pulled open the driver's door. “Your driving privileges have been revoked give me the keys.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio groaned before begrudgingly doing so.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Detached. That was what Rio was supposed to be and yet her and Agatha’s last mission proved she was being anything but.<br/>
</p><p>What <em>was<em> that? She didn’t know.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Firstly, Agatha had gotten her so riled up, so angry, so <em>nervous<em> in that bathroom. She’d deliberately broken one of Rio’s boundaries with seemingly no remorse. That was really the tip of the iceberg for her, and that’s why Rio had done what she did. Rio <em>knew<em> Agatha had another lover and she’d touched her anyway.<br/>
</em></em></em></em></p><p>Why? Because she was pissed off and no that wasn’t an excuse.<br/>
</p><p>Secondly, she’d gotten all jealous when their mission target was whispering and giggling with Agatha. Why she had gotten jealous she didn’t know. Her wife was a lesbian and Peter was their mission. But Agatha was laughing, it wasn’t fair that Peter got to make her laugh and Rio didn’t. She’d turned that envy into more anger and made Agatha deal with Peter on her own. She almost caused them to fail their mission because she was too aggravated to help.<br/>
</p><p>Lastly, after terrorising the streets of Manhattan with her extremely impressive driving skills she and Agatha had simply…laughed about it. As if they hadn’t been playing sick games with each other all night, as if they weren’t fuming with each other, as if they hadn’t almost killed one another and their mission subject.<br/>
</p><p>It all felt so…normal to Rio, completing a mission and then laughing about it with her wife as if this were a practice they’d done for years.<br/>
</p><p>It had only been three. Fucking. Days.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t know if she would be able to survive this marriage. She was already acting out of character. Rio didn’t think one person should be able to make such an impact on another in such a short amount of time. It scared her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha coughing to the left of her ripped her out of her thoughts.<br/>
</p><p>It was the first night of their new mission. They were at a ski resort in Verbier, Switzerland keeping tabs on the Archibold family, more specifically Amelia Archibold. She was the CEO of Hifiz, a tech company dominating the tech market at the moment. The FBI have reasons to believe Amelia is using her tech company as a front for something else, Agatha and Rio’s mission was simple. Observe Amelia, her husband Jack and twelve-year-old child, get close to them, download a software onto Amelia and Jack’s phones so the FBI could track their activity and that was it.<br/>
</p><p>Should be simple enough.<br/>
</p><p>The agency had booked Rio and Agatha into the hotel room next to the Archibold’s and they had installed a camera so that they could watch them 24/7. The only problem was that the room only had one bed. Rio had claimed it immediately, she had told Agatha that because she was a ‘princess’ she deserved it. Agatha looked ashamed of herself and therefore hadn’t objected.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman coughed again.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Why do you keep coughing?”<br/>
</p><p>“What you think I’m doing it on purpose? It’s fucking freezing and there are no blankets. I’m probably catching a cold.”<br/>
</p><p>“Turn the heating up,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“It <em>is<em> up.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Then why are you still cold? Are you a reptile or something?” <em>Why am I snapping at her?<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>“'<em>Are you are reptile or something,<em>’” Agatha mimicked her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio scoffed. “And just like that…my sympathy has vanished.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sneezed before she said a sarcastic, “Oh, no! How ever will I recover?”<br/>
</p><p>The room fell into silence. Rio stared at the pitch black to the left of her where her fake wife was probably curled up in a ball on the floor. She didn’t want Agatha to be cold, she didn't even know why she kept making digs at her.<br/>
</p><p>It was just Agatha was so confusing. It was easier to act as if she hated her.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman sneezed three times in a row before she was attacked by a coughing fit.<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” Rio grumbled. “Get up here.”<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“You heard me. We actually need to be able to sleep if we want to get this mission done well and neither of us is going to be able to if you won’t stop coughing and sneezing.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was met with silence. Agatha didn’t reply nor did she hear her move. She bit her lip, now she just felt stupid.<br/>
</p><p>What seemed like years to Rio passed before she heard a rustling. The left side of the bed sunk with added weight, she felt cool air hit her skin as Agatha lifted the duvet and slid underneath it.<br/>
</p><p>The room fell silent again.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shut her eyes to try and ignore the way her body felt like it had been set alight due to her and Agatha’s close proximity. The knowledge that if she stretched her hand to the left her fingers would connect with Agatha’s body filled her with dread. The temptation to do just that was unbearable.<br/>
</p><p>Out of nowhere, the bed started shaking.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re shivering?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Not on purpose,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t get it…the whole reason I told you to come up here was so that you wouldn’t be cold anymore.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed. “My body just needs time to adjust. Bear with me, alright?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, I can’t exactly sleep if the bed is-”<br/>
</p><p>“There’s not much I can do about it, Rio.” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Rio opened her eyes just to roll them. She needed sleep and wouldn’t get any unless Agatha warmed up. Instincts from where Rio didn’t know, took over. She rolled over, pressed her body against Agatha’s and slipped her hands around her waist.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you-?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cut her off. “You’re cold, my body heat will warm you up and we’ll both be able to get some sleep.”<br/>
</p><p>“I know but-”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t question it, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply, instead, she pressed her body further into Rio’s. She hadn’t been lying, she was freezing and Rio immediately felt guilt about making her sleep on the floor. She started rubbing Agatha’s arm to generate heat as the other woman trembled against her body.<br/>
</p><p>“Is this, okay?” Rio asked. She owed it to Agatha to ask after the last time she touched her.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” she whispered. “Yeah, it’s okay.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked slowly awake. At first confused by her surroundings. This wasn’t her room in New York. Then she remembered she was on a mission and had left New York fifteen hours ago. Another thing confused her, the feeling of weight behind her, of hands holding on to her that weren’t hers. She craned her neck slightly to see Agatha’s face pressed against her back. Rio froze. Was this how she fell asleep? No, it hadn’t been. It had been the other way around. Had they flipped during the night? Evidently.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck,<em> Rio thought.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>As carefully as she could, she detangled herself from Agatha, grabbed some clothes off the armchair by the bed and tiptoed to the bathroom. She needed a shower. There was tension built up in between her legs that she needed rid of as quickly as possible.<br/>
</p><p>Whilst in the shower Rio wondered if she made the right decision last night. She had essentially <em>cuddled<em> her fake wife. Was that allowed? Did that count as cheating to Agatha? Would her lover approve? No, it mustn’t do. Agatha would’ve said something.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She grabbed her towel off the toilet seat once she was done and stepped out of the shower. Rio frowned when she saw the bathroom door ajar. It wasn’t by much, but she swore she had shut it, she didn’t want to wake Agatha up with her showering. She crept across the bathroom to close it, it did for a second before it popped open again.<br/>
</p><p>Their bathroom door didn’t shut.<br/>
</p><p>“Great. This is <em>just<em> great,” Rio muttered.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Are you talking to yourself?” A voice croaked from the other room. “Because you know that’s the first sign of insanity.”<br/>
</p><p>Despite herself, Rio laughed. “Pretty sure I crossed over the line to insanity a long time ago.”<br/>
</p><p>“Shit, should I be worried? Should we start looking at psych wards to put you in?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “You’re hilarious.”<br/>
</p><p>“Aren’t I just,” was Agatha’s quick reply.<br/>
</p><p>Fifteen minutes later Rio was dried, moisturised and partially dressed. She couldn’t find a top. She swore there had been one in the pile of clothes she had brought with her. Currently, she was dressed in leggings and a black bra.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?” She called.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>“Is there a top on the chair by my side of the bed?”<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause before a, “No.”<br/>
</p><p>Shit.<br/>
</p><p>She scanned the bathroom, lifted up the towels on the towel rack to see if she’d put it there, nothing. She looked behind the toilet, in her pile of pyjamas, Rio even checked the shower.<br/>
</p><p>Still nothing.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, it was fine. Agatha had seen her in a bikini this was no different. In fact, this time she was even more covered because she was wearing leggings. Rio considered asking her fake wife to bring a top for her, but then Agatha would have to dig through her luggage case, and she’d rather avoid that.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath before pulling the already open bathroom door wider apart. She stepped out and blue eyes locked on to her immediately. She froze as if Agatha had trapped her in a trance. The other woman’s gaze fell to Rio’s chest. She made no attempt to cover herself, actually, Rio let her stare…she would’ve.<br/>
</p><p>It was as if Agatha had to force herself to take her eyes off Rio as she cleared her throat and shifted off the bed.<br/>
</p><p>“You…you done with the bathroom?” She stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha made her way towards her and Rio swore she was walking in 0.5 speed. Goose bumps spread across her skin as Agatha stopped beside her. What would she do? Grab her right here and now? Throw her onto the bed and kiss her until she couldn’t breathe? Rio scolded herself for wanting nothing more.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes trailed up Rio’s form again before she looked up at her. Her gaze let Rio know she had her undivided attention.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, her voice laced with desperation.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” was all she could manage.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha only stared at her for a long moment. Her eyes flickered between each of her eyes and her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“I…I lied.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“There was a shirt on the chair.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio took her eyes off Agatha for the first time in minutes, and there on the chair was the shirt she thought she brought with her to the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>She scoffed in disbelief. “You bitch.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cackled before disappearing into the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at their mission target as she sipped her coffee. They were three tables down from them at the restaurant where they were eating breakfast. She was trying to ignore the way Rio kept glaring at her so that she didn’t laugh. She figured she’d messed with Rio enough for the morning, if she laughed in her face, she would only make the situation worse.<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t that Agatha <em>wanted<em> to mess with her fake wife, she just thought Rio deserved some payback for having her sleep on the floor and almost giving her hyperthermia.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>For people who were supposed to be happily married (that’s what Amelia had said in every interview Agatha had watched before they had arrived at the hotel last night) they didn’t look it. The Archibald’s had barely spoken a word to each other since arriving at breakfast, and their son had been so engrossed in his iPhone games he didn’t seem to notice. Even Rio and her looked happier than them, although Rio was scowling at her, they were holding hands across the table.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, so plan for today?”<br/>
</p><p>“We follow them. We put trackers on them if we make contact.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>A waiter came with their omelettes and Agatha flinched when Rio took her hand out of hers. She shuddered. That was weird. Her body shouldn’t have reacted that way simply because of the loss of contact.<br/>
</p><p>And all of a sudden it was last night again, and Rio was rubbing circles on Agatha’s arm. At some point, Rio had fitted her head in the crook of Agatha’s neck. It had fit so perfectly there as if it had been made with the other woman’s head in mind.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had pressed so far back into Rio’s body that she wouldn’t have been surprised if their bodies moulded together.<br/>
</p><p>“…Agatha?” Rio said. By the look on her face, this hadn’t been the first time she’d said her name.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>“I said you can ski, right?”<br/>
</p><p>She nodded. “My dad planned yearly trips to Aspen for ‘work.’ Really it was just an excuse for him and his business friends to get inhumanly drunk.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows in a way that said she wasn’t shocked by what she had said.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…what about you? How do you know how to ski?”<br/>
</p><p>“Had to live in Canada for a bit for a mission,” Rio told her as she put a piece of her omelette in her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“You ever snowboarded?” Agatha asked, eating a bit of her own.<br/>
</p><p>“Once. It was alright, I prefer skiing. You?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah. I kept faceplanting and called it a day.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio snorted the coffee she was sipping. It sprayed over her face.<br/>
</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to laugh. “I forgot I was a comedian. I should’ve waited until you had taken a sip before I spoke,” she said, pulling the cup from Rio’s hand. She reached over with a napkin and started wiping Rio’s face.<br/>
</p><p>“Or maybe you shouldn’t speak at all and then I wouldn’t have coffee up my nose,” she smiled.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha smiled, she showed teeth.<br/>
</p><p>Their relationship was so confusing to Agatha. One minute they were pushing each other’s buttons, the next they were talking as if they were lifelong friends, the other they were trying not to rip each other’s clothes off.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh shit,” Agatha said, scooting her chair backwards.<br/>
</p><p>“What?”<br/>
</p><p>“They’re leaving.”<br/>
</p><p>“Shit,” Rio mumbled, shuffling out of her own chair.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The two women found themselves on a ski lift twenty minutes later. The Archibold’s were five lifts up from them. Five lifts too far Agatha thought, but a family of twenty had gotten in front of them and there was no getting passed them. They stuck to each other like gorilla glue.<br/>
</p><p>Rio swung her ski-fitted feet back and forth whilst the lift climbed up the mountain. Normally Agatha would’ve told her off for making the lift rock, but she didn’t feel like it today.<br/>
</p><p>The view was breathtaking. There was snow top covered mountains for as far as the eye could see. The pine trees looked like they had been dusted with icing sugar along with the wooden ski lodges of their resort in front of them. It looked straight out of a Christmas card.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s gaze shifted to Rio in her all-black one-piece ski suit, black beanie and silver ski goggles that sat on top of her head. Her raven hair spilt out onto her shoulders.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes…” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“I didn’t say anything,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“You were staring at me.”<br/>
</p><p>“I was staring past you,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Yeah, okay.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m worried we’re going to lose them,” she said, changing the subject. “We haven’t engaged yet; we haven’t slipped trackers on them.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip. “Yeah, me too.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her seat and started pulling at her navy blue ski gloves.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you have your intercom on you?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Always.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, put it in.”<br/>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows. “Why?”<br/>
</p><p>“So, we can communicate,” Rio laughed as she pulled at her ski goggles.<br/>
</p><p>“Where are you going?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to catch them down the mountain.”<br/>
</p><p>“How?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio winked before her brown eyes disappeared behind metallic silver.<br/>
</p><p>“Ri-”<br/>
</p><p>In one movement, Rio lifted up the barrier locking them in place and slid off the ski lift.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha screamed as her fake wife dropped onto the pine tree below them and glided down the tree until she hit the ground. She was too far away but she was sure Rio had hit it with a thud.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you fucking insane?” Agatha yelled to her.<br/>
</p><p>Somehow, she made out Rio’s cackle as the ski lift pulled her further up the mountain.</p>

<p>Rio coughed as soon as she finished cackling. She had winded herself from the fall. She was almost surprised she hadn’t broken any bones, but she’d done reckless shit like that all the time and gotten away unscathed. Sometimes she wondered if it was even possible for her to break any limbs at all.<br/>
</p><p>She grunted, picking herself off the ground. She fumbled around in her pocket until she found her intercom, pushed it into her ear, and tapped it on.<br/>
</p><p>“…You’re fucking crazy. Are you even there? Did you die? You better not have died.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled before she said, “God? Is that you? I always knew you were a woman.”<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause before her wife spoke again, “Please tell me you’re okay.”<br/>
</p><p>The anxiousness in Agatha’s voice caught Rio off guard. She didn’t mean to frighten her, she just wanted to do what was best for the mission.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, I’m fine. Promise.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio heard Agatha breathe a shaky sigh of relief.<br/>
</p><p>She cleared her throat. “Erm…do you still have eyes on them?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied. “They’re still on the lift. Sit tight.”<br/>
</p><p>Ten minutes later, Agatha spoke again.<br/>
</p><p>“Jack’s coming towards you now. They had a fight; he left Amelia and their son on the top of the mountain. I’ll stay with them; you stay with him.”<br/>
</p><p>“Copy.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, by the way, you left your poles in the lift so…”<br/>
</p><p>“Shit,” Rio mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>This changed everything. She couldn’t keep up with Jack without her ski poles, she would lose him again.<br/>
</p><p>Okay. New plan. Rio had to make contact so she could slip a tracker on him.<br/>
</p><p>She rolled her eyes at how pathetic she was going to have to pretend to be before she started digging a hole in the snow large and deep enough to submerge her ski boot in. When she was satisfied with her hole, she covered it thoroughly with snow. Next, she launched one of her skis a great distance away from her and waited.<br/>
</p><p>She had to wave off four people who had asked her if she needed help. One man was so adamant about helping that she had to bark at him so he left her alone.<br/>
</p><p>Finally, Jack came, and she shoved down every thought that rejected asking a man for help as she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Excuse me.”<br/>
</p><p>He skidded to a stop, snow sprayed Rio as he did so.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” Jack apologised.<br/>
</p><p>“No, it’s alright,” Rio said breathlessly. “I was wondering if you could help me…please? I seem to have gotten a bit stuck.”<br/>
</p><p>He looked down at her foot in the hole she’d made and arched a brow. “How have you done that?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed airily. “I’m not too sure.”<br/>
</p><p>Jack raised both eyebrows this time before he smiled. “Yeah, here.”<br/>
</p><p>He held out his ski poles towards her and she grabbed onto the rubber ends. Jack pulled; Rio didn’t budge.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Shit. Did I do too good of a job at getting myself stuck?<em><br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“Are you holding on tight?” Jack asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, just making sure.” Without warning, Jack clicked his skis off and fell backwards into the snow.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shot forward. She felt her entire body weight resting on the tip of her stuck ski boot before she fell on top of Jack.<br/>
</p><p>“I am so sorry,” she said, pushing off him to get up, but not before she slipped a tracker into his pocket.<br/>
</p><p>Was it the best place to put it? No. She would’ve preferred if she could’ve stuck it to his skin, the second he took off his ski trousers she’d lose him again. It was the best Rio could do.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s alright,” Jack laughed. “I needed a reason to dive into snow.”<br/>
</p><p>“Rough week?” Rio asked, dusting herself off.<br/>
</p><p>“You could say that,” he mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear that.”<br/>
</p><p>Jack sat up. He regarded Rio for a long moment before he said, “Thanks.”<br/>
</p><p>She could tell he meant it, could tell that her apologising to him was something he needed to hear.<br/>
</p><p>“So,” Jack said, changing the subject. “What brings you skiing?”<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…” Rio pretended to scratch her ear so she could turn off her intercom. She didn’t want Agatha hearing this conversation. “My wife and I are on vacation.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah. You been married long?”<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head. “Although it feels like it.” Rio started kicking the snow like a schoolgirl that had just been asked out by her crush as she spoke about her wife. She hadn’t even realised she was doing it. “What about you? Are you married?”<br/>
</p><p>Jack scoffed. “Technically.”<br/>
</p><p>“…Technically?”<br/>
</p><p>“I mean yes I’m married but I…it doesn’t feel like I am anymore.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded her head regretfully. “Oh, well, I’m sorry…again.”<br/>
</p><p>Jack threw his head back and laughed. “No, I’m sorry. I don’t even know you and I’m telling you all my problems.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio waved him off. “I owe you, after all, you did help me get out my hole in the ground.”<br/>
</p><p>“That is very true,” Jack said standing up. “I’m Jack,” he extended his arm out towards her.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio,” she replied, taking it.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, it was very nice to meet you, Rio.” He started kicking on his skis again. “I hope to see you around.”<br/>
</p><p>“Me too,” she smiled.<br/>
</p><p>He stuck his ski poles into the ground and slid past her until he stopped abruptly. “Rio?” He said, turning to face her.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes?"<br/>
</p><p>“Your wife…do you love her?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio choked on her spit. The question had caught her so off guard. She swallowed and forced her lips to move.<br/>
</p><p>“Y…yes,” she stuttered. “Deeply.”<br/>
</p><p>Jack nodded. “Good. Make sure you show her that you do, or you’ll end up like me.” That was the last thing he said to her before he sped off down the mountain.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio sat at a bench at the bottom of the slope with her eyes glued to her phone. Jack appeared to be sitting at the hotel café, and he hadn’t moved for the past half an hour. She couldn’t make contact again, not without it seeming suspicious. She had to keep track of him from afar.<br/>
</p><p>She was also waiting for Agatha who hadn’t come down the mountain yet. A huff escaped Rio’s lips, and her breath became visible in front of her. It crossed her mind to unpack what she had told Jack, that she loved her fake wife. She didn’t, she knew that. But that didn’t mean it didn’t feel good to say…because it did.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know what that meant. She didn't-<br/>
</p><p>
<em>WHACK!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The side of her face began to sting. She shuddered as snow seeped down her neck and into her ski suit.<br/>
</p><p>“What the-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cut herself off when Agatha’s laugh ripped through the air. She whipped around to where the sound came from and was met with another snowball to the face.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you kidding me?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s laugh grew louder. “That was for scaring me half to death when you fell out of that tree and for turning off your coms, I’ve been trying to talk to you for the past twenty minutes.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip. The other woman was right, she had no leg to stand on. “Did you need to throw the snow though?”<br/>
</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled a face to which her fake wife laughed again.<br/>
</p><p>“You put the tracker on Amelia?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yep.” Agatha sat down next to Rio on the bench. “I think I feel bad for her.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “What do you mean?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, when I made contact, she was crying. Her son didn’t care…like at all. And you know her husband had left her on the side of a mountain.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, well, we don’t know what <em>she<em> may have done to make him do that.” Rio didn’t know why she felt the need to jump to Jack’s defence.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha eyed her carefully before she said, “Anyway, their marriage is falling apart no matter whose fault it is.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio inhaled a short breath. “The file said they’d been married for thirteen years. If you’ve been with someone for that long, when do you get to the point where you wake up and just…hate them?”<br/>
</p><p>It had happened to Rio before, waking up in a relationship and realising it wasn’t meant to be. Although, she had never dated anyone for more than two years (because she was scared they were getting too close to her and she'd bolt). She figured if you were with someone for longer than that then you must really love them, otherwise, you would’ve left already… wouldn’t you?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Trust me. It happens.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio locked eyes with the other woman and she immediately turned away. It was as if she’d accidentally given too much away, that she’d let Rio see something she hadn’t intended her to.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to know more, realised she wanted Agatha to talk about her past, wanted her to talk about herself in general.<br/>
</p><p>Her fake wife cleared her throat, “Let’s go see our mission targets.”<br/>
</p><p>Knowing she wouldn’t get any more out of her, Rio nodded. She pulled out her phone and opened up the tracking app.<br/>
</p><p>“They’re at the café,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, then,” Agatha replied, getting up.<br/>
</p><p>Rio joined her, but not before scooping up a pile of snow and shaping it into a ball.<br/>
</p><p>“So,” Agatha said, turning around. “What do you think-”<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t get to finish her sentence as a snowball whacked her in the mouth.<br/>
</p><p>She spat, hastily swiping at the snow covering her cheeks and chin. “Oh, you’re dead, Smith,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>Rio cackled as she ran in the direction of the café, her wife on her heels with a mountain of snow wedged between her fists.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“M’lady,” Agatha said, her tone mocking before she placed a mug of hot chocolate on the table in front of Rio. They were in a booth across the café from their mission targets who they had full view of.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman’s hair was soaked, white clumps of snow were still visible amongst her strands of dark brown hair.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had slipped, a rookie mistake. Agatha had shown no mercy, pulling off Rio’s beanie as she dumped piles and piles of snow on top of her head. That wasn’t to say Rio didn’t get her back, she’d kicked her leg out and Agatha had fallen beside her. Her fake wife had rolled on top of her and pummelled her with multiple snowballs.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scowled at her<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blew out a low whistle. “I got you good, didn’t I?”<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t think before she cupped Rio’s face with both her hands. She stroked Rio’s pink cheeks with her thumbs. “You’re freezing.”<br/>
</p><p>“Am I?” Rio said sarcastically.<br/>
</p><p>“Just a bit.”<br/>
</p><p>A slow smile spread across Rio’s lips before she scrunched her nose and pulled Agatha’s hands off her. “Your hands a cold.” She took her hot mug and pressed it against her face. “That’s better.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before grabbing her own cup. She almost choked after her first sip.<br/>
</p><p>“What? What is it?” Rio said, her voice urgent.<br/>
</p><p>“Marshmallows,” Agatha grimaced. “I told the barista not to give me any, he must’ve forgotten.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked at her in disbelief. “You don’t like marshmallows?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“What…what’s wrong with you?”<br/>
</p><p>She laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not joking,” Rio said with a straight face. “This is a serious offence. Who doesn’t like marshmallows in their hot cocoa?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gestured to herself.<br/>
</p><p>“My Abuela would’ve called you an alien.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s ears perked up at that. This was the first time Rio had mentioned anything about her family. She knew it was for good reason; they weren’t supposed to share anything about who they once were with one another.<br/>
</p><p>“Because I don’t like marshmallows?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm. She used to say, ‘It’s not a hot cocoa without whipped cream and marshmallows.’” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>But only one word stuck out to Agatha. “Used to?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio sucked in a short breath. Her whole demeanour changed. “Erm…yeah.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was an FBI agent; she didn’t need Rio to spell it out for her to know what she meant.<br/>
</p><p>“You were close?” Agatha asked more as a fact.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “She was all I had for a while. She died a couple of months ago.” She sounded so distant when she spoke.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her wife with her lips between her teeth. She hadn’t thought much about what Rio’s family life had been like, she just assumed it was fine. Rio seemed so…put together. There hadn’t been any signs of someone grieving. She had a new found respect for the other woman. To carry yourself the way Rio did when your world was falling apart is taxing. Agatha would know, she had failed every time she’d needed to do so.<br/>
</p><p>“Stop looking at me like that,” Rio said, taking a sip of hot chocolate. “I don’t need your pity.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s not…” Agatha trailed off. “I’m…just…” She inhaled deeply before she finally got her sentence out. “You know you’re not alone anymore, right?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked at her.<br/>
</p><p>“I mean,” Agatha continued, holding up her left hand. “We’ve got rings to prove it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s brown eyes flicked between Agatha’s. Her expression was a mixture of disbelief and gratitude. Rio didn’t say anything, only nodded.<br/>
</p><p>That was enough for Agatha.</p>

<p>The rest of the day consisted of watching Amelia and Jack argue or completely ignoring one another. They hadn’t gone back out onto the slopes; they stayed at the café for five hours. Amelia tapping furiously at her phone when she wasn’t hurdling insults at her husband, and Jack trying to connect with his son when he wasn’t shooting back his own.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Rio had gotten through two cups of hot chocolate (Agatha got hers with marshmallows just to give to Rio) and two cups of coffee.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha needed to pee…badly. Of course, she could get up and go, but she didn’t want to leave Rio. It wasn’t for concern of her safety. Rio could handle herself and Agatha knew it. It was simply the fact that she didn’t want to miss a second of this time they were spending together.<br/>
</p><p>This was the first time they had been in each other’s company for this long and not wanted to strangle, torment or fuck one another. And neither of them felt the urge to run away. There was nothing wrong with those three things, Agatha was sure they’d get back to that at some point. But she wouldn’t deny that she wasn’t enjoying being in Rio’s presence.<br/>
</p><p>She hadn’t mentioned anything about her past again, but she’d shared other things with her, like how she loves basketball, and her team is the Brooklyn Nets (obviously), and although she’s never been to see them live, she tunes in to every game whenever she can and when she can’t she watches it back the second she has any free time. She prefers to watch films than TV shows although she rarely watches either and she hates olives.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha loves them.<br/>
</p><p>She’d returned the favour. She told Rio she had no interest in any type of sport ever, she also prefers films to TV shows but would happily watch either. If she wasn’t so hellbent on being a federal agent, she was sure she would’ve pursued a career in acting. Rio had laughed, she’d said it made sense because she was so dramatic. Agatha had pulled a face at her and Rio had laughed harder.<br/>
</p><p>The Archibold’s were getting up to leave now. Agatha and Rio waited a minute before following them, keeping track of them by their trackers. They were heading towards their hotel room and Agatha wasn’t complaining. The bed, couch and chairs in their room were far more comfortable than the stiff leather booths they had been sitting in.<br/>
</p><p>Once back in their room, Rio flicked on the TV, and it lit up with live footage of the couple next door.<br/>
</p><p>“Are we still going to dinner?”<br/>
</p><p>Amelia blinked at her husband. “Is that because I run a tech company? You think I’m a robot and therefore don’t need to eat?”<br/>
</p><p>Jack threw his head back exasperatingly. “It was just a question.”<br/>
</p><p>“It was a stupid fucking question. Of course, we’re still going to fucking dinner.”<br/>
</p><p>“Guess we’re going to dinner,” Rio said over the top of Jack and Amelia’s newest argument.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Guess so.”</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s brown eyes glistened in the low lighting of the restaurant. They somehow looked lighter than usual. Maybe it was the lighting, maybe it was the way her smile reached her eyes as she laughed at Agatha’s digs at their waiter.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t see it?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “No, I do. He does like a seventy-year-old man trapped in a teenager's body.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw out her hand as she said, “Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>She took in the way Rio was staring at her with an easy smile on her lips, took in the way Rio kept fiddling with her wedding ring as she did so.<br/>
</p><p>A sharp clang of cutlery against Chinaware ripped the pair's attention away from one another. Four tables down Amelia was waving her hands around, muffled words spilled out of her mouth. Her husband had his head in his hands.<br/>
</p><p>Back in the room Rio and Agatha had decided not to make contact again. They would wait until tomorrow. Things between the couple had gotten so heated that trying to engage again would probably end in immediate dismissal. They couldn’t risk that otherwise reapproaching would become far more difficult.<br/>
</p><p>Amelia looked up; the whole restaurant had turned to face her family. She slipped on a neutral mask and returned to her eating.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s next words to Rio caught even herself off guard. The comment was offhanded, and she hadn’t considered what they meant, how layered her statement was until it had landed.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t want to ever end up that way with you. Kill me if you think we’re going in that direction, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>She was laughing until she registered the slight shock on Rio’s face.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s smile slowly faded, and she stirred uncomfortably in her chair. “I mean…because it wouldn’t be good for our professional dynamic.”<br/>
</p><p>She felt Rio’s foot press against her leg momentarily before it pulled away. “Yes…professionalism is our only concern.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha almost thanked god for the waiter arriving with their food. He placed steak and fries in front of her and a lasagne before Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Enjoy,” he said in that gravely shaken way old men spoke with.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t bother with her knife and fork as she stuffed a handful of fries in her mouth. Food meant she didn’t have to speak. Food meant she had time to think of how to get out of this awkward position she’d put herself and her fake wife in.<br/>
</p><p>She’d gotten carried away with the fries. A heavy boulder of unproperly chewed food was now wedged just below her throat. Agatha thought her eyes might budge out of their sockets as she tried to cough it down. With flared eyes Rio handed her a glass of water and she took it, not stopping to breathe or think as she downed the entire content in one gulp.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sucked in desperate breaths, rubbing soothingly at her chest, eyes watering.<br/>
</p><p>“You, okay?” Agatha didn’t miss the slight amusement in Rio’s voice.<br/>
</p><p>“Peachy,” it came out strained.<br/>
</p><p>“How about you try chewing next time?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes teasingly and Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“So, they’re good?”<br/>
</p><p>“Hm?”<br/>
</p><p>“Your fries,” Rio said, pointing her knife at Agatha’s plate. “They’re good?”<br/>
</p><p>“Extremely.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “I’m glad for it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes playfully. She shifted her gaze back to their mission targets who were now eating in silence, their son still glued to his phone like he always was. Her hand found its way to a fry as she watched. She looked down at it and grimaced.<br/>
</p><p>That was enough fries for today.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio was alone in their room, her pyjamas on as she sat on the couch watching the TV. Jack was looking at his son who had fallen asleep on the bed in front of him. She’d told Agatha to stay with Amelia as the couple looked like they were going to split. Amelia had ordered a bottle of wine; it didn’t look like she was going to be moving anytime soon. She’d wanted Agatha to order some more food; after nearly choking on her fries, she hadn’t touched anything else on her plate.<br/>
</p><p>Her fake wife had huffed, was going to rebuttal until Rio had shot her a look that it was not up for debate. She was pleasantly surprised when Agatha didn’t argue, she anticipated it, prepared for it…and it hadn’t come.<br/>
</p><p>For something to do, Rio started biting her nails. Jack wasn’t doing much; he’d flopped on the queen-sized bed using his arms as a pillow. After a while he stilled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed. <em>Now what?<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha returned to their room an hour and a half later. In that time Rio had showered, changed into a new pair of pyjamas, brushed her teeth, organised her clothes and stared boredly at the TV.<br/>
</p><p>“I need to shower,” Agatha grumbled. Rio could hear her boots falling onto the floor as she took them off.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s all yours,” Rio said from behind the coach. Her legs were hanging off the back of it, her body upside down, her head inches away from the floor.<br/>
</p><p>“You trying out for the Olympics?”<br/>
</p><p>“Huh?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s face appeared above her; she gestured to the odd positioning Rio had put herself in.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh,” she shifted. “Well, how else was I going to make watching a man and his son sleep for two hours interesting?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha feigned disgust. “This is what you choose to do with your free time? Watching men sleep? Who the hell have I married.”<br/>
</p><p>“Shut the <em>fuck<em> up,” Rio said.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha cackled before disappearing into the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>Rio twisted herself so she could see the TV upright again. Amelia was stumbling about her room, pulling sluggishly at her coat and boots. She didn’t bother taking off the rest of her clothes before she dived into bed. It took ten minutes of tossing and turning before Amelia fell asleep.<br/>
</p><p>Finally. Rio had, had enough of watching that family for one day. Her bed was calling to her. With the grace of an elephant, she tumbled off the couch, stretching out her neck and shoulders as she made her way over to it.<br/>
</p><p>She approached the bathroom, didn’t think before she drew to a stop outside of it. She’d expected the door to be ajar, what she hadn’t expected was to see Agatha freshly out of the shower with a towel wrapped around her body.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched as the other woman reached across the countertop to wipe at the large mirror before her. The condensation melted away and Agatha stared at herself in the reflection before she huffed, moving to loosen the towel that hugged her form.<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed as Agatha’s naked body slowly revealed itself to her. The towel unravelled and her wife let it drop to the floor before she kicked it away. Rio had to force herself to steady her breath, Agatha was <em>so<em> beautiful.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her eyes wandered lazily up the other woman’s figure. She picked out the jagged scar on the left side of her pelvis, the fading bruise on her rib from their first mission, the flower tattoo on the inside of her right ankle, the toned lines of her back, her sharp collarbone. Rio couldn’t find a single fault on the woman.<br/>
</p><p>She had to dig her nails into her palms to stop herself from giving into the impulse to barge into the bathroom and trail her fingers down Agatha’s bare spine, plant open-mouthed kisses on her neck, mouth and jaw, run her fingers through her long wet hair, get on her knees and-<br/>
</p><p>Rio dug into her palms harder.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha reached for the cream next to her, opened it and started moisturising her skin. It was then Rio became aware of the tightening coil in her lower stomach, of the dampness in between her legs. She should stop watching. She should go to bed and hope that sleep would come quickly so that every thought of Agatha would be erased, even for a moment.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t move.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman had finished creaming herself. She pulled on a fitted grey long-sleeve sleep shirt and Rio’s disappointment came out as a shaky huff. Agatha’s long dark hair fell over her shoulders as she reached to her left. She disappeared from Rio’s view for a moment before she returned wearing plaid grey and navy pyjama bottoms. A slither of her lower stomach was still visible, and it was all it took to dry out Rio’s mouth entirely. She swallowed again and felt sandpaper.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pushed at her hair until it was in a messy ponytail. Immediately, Rio’s eyes dropped to where her hair once was. Water had soaked through the areas around her breasts. There was no missing the hard buds that poked through her shirt.<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. She was torturing herself. Unless she intended on acting on her desire to fuck her fake wife, she had no reason to be watching her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rested her hands on the countertop, rolling her head back until her eyes landed back on her reflection. She inhaled a deep breath as she stared at herself. Rio watched the way her eyebrows began to furrow, and then her gaze shifted, connecting with Rio’s in the mirror.<br/>
</p><p>She’d been caught.<br/>
</p><p>Rio all but sprinted to their bed, diving underneath the covers and burying her face in her hands. How could she be so stupid? She heaved in shaky breaths, her knuckles pressed against her forehead.<br/>
</p><p>She forced her eyes shut and tried to steady her breathing, willing herself to fall asleep, or for a hole to open up and swallow her whole. Rio would prefer the hole.<br/>
</p><p>Sleep didn’t come only Agatha did.<br/>
</p><p>She heard the click of the big light turning off, felt the bed sink with added weight, felt Agatha’s warmth reach out and envelope her when she got underneath the covers. She didn’t move. Even if she wasn’t asleep hopefully Agatha would think she was. It wasn’t like she could see Rio; she had fully submerged herself beneath their duvet.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was sure she would’ve stayed buried if she didn’t feel like she was going to suffocate. The heat radiating off her body plus Agatha’s was enough to melt glaciers. She pulled timidly at the top of the cover until light streamed into her little layer and cool air poured inside.<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t enough.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shuffled upwards as discreetly as she could until her head was above the covers. Her hair was pushed in front of her face. She left it there. It was a mask; she would have to deal with the way it tickled her nose.<br/>
</p><p>Minutes passed and Rio thought Agatha had fallen asleep, she hadn’t felt any movement from the other woman. She shifted her legs, biting down on her bottom lip as her left thigh slipped easily over the right. A reminder of how soaked she still was.<br/>
</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes harder until she saw stars. She needed to get it together. The movement stilled when she felt fingers brushing her forehead. One by one, strands of her hair were being brushed out of her face. Little by little, her skin became exposed to the cool air of the room.<br/>
</p><p>She stifled the urge to moan at how good it felt to feel Agatha’s soft fingers on her face.<br/>
</p><p>Once all of her hair was out of the way, Agatha brought it behind her shoulder, letting her hand skim the edge of her neck, letting her nails trail down the back of her shoulder before resting on her upper arm. Agatha’s warmth seeped through Rio’s skin like a searing brand; she knew she wouldn’t be forgetting that feeling anytime soon.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s other hand returning to her face to stroke her cheek had Rio’s eyes fluttering open. The action was so tender, deliberate, how could they not? She was met with deep blue. Even in the dim light of their bedroom, Agatha’s eyes were just as alluring as ever. They slowly flicked between Rio’s as the thumb on her cheek began to move lower.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped to watch where her thumb was going, it along with her eyes landed on Rio’s bottom lip. She pulled lightly, the edge of her thumb dipping into Rio’s mouth coating it in her saliva. Agatha dragged her eyes lazily back up Rio’s face until their eyes connected again.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman’s gaze was dizzying and her thumb tugging at Rio’s lip felt so good her eyes drifted shut again. She thought she was going to explode. It didn’t feel human to feel this good.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t think before finally moving her own hands. They sought out Agatha’s body beneath the covers, she exhaled when her hand found her wife’s hip, shifting at her shirt until she could only feel her heated bare skin. With ease, she slid her arm around the other woman’s back and pulled her into her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt the press of Agatha’s arm against her chest because of the space she’d closed.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha whispered. She dragged out Rio’s name as if she were savouring it.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” was all she could manage.<br/>
</p><p>“Open your eyes.”<br/>
</p><p>She felt Agatha’s breath hot against her cheek.<br/>
</p><p>Rio did. She choked back tears. Her wife was so fucking beautiful, always, but especially like this.<br/>
</p><p>There was a hunger in Agatha’s eyes, dark and devastating.<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew then, that whenever Agatha looked like this, she would do any and everything she asked of her.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman leaned in, and Rio was ready. Professionalism? Fuck professionalism. She was an idiot for even trying to suppress the urge to taste Agatha. She felt the ghost of her lips against hers, felt the pressure increase-<br/>
</p><p>
<em>She has a lover.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The thought stole the breath from Rio’s lungs. She shoved Agatha back, detangling herself from their intertwined limbs.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>So<em> stupid. How had she forgotten?<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Rio scrambled out of bed, grabbed her phone from her bedside table and ran to their hotel room door ready to pull it open when:<br/>
</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha’s voice sounded pained, betrayed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s hand stilled on the door knob. “Don’t,” she hated how raw her voice sounded. She tried again. “Don’t follow me.” She opened the door. “Please.”<br/>
</p><p>And a plea it was.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio thought she might die from hyperthermia. She was okay with that.<br/>
</p><p>The biting cold against her uncovered legs and arms hurt like hell but at least it grounded her. With blue trembling fingers she took another drag from her cigarette. She hadn’t smoked in <em>years<em> and only used to do it when she was significantly buzzed on alcohol, but desperate times. The receptionist behind the desk in the lobby had seen Rio crying and offered her one. She hadn’t declined.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio Vidal had done many morally questionable things; she had to it was in her job description. And because of this, she tried not to do anything unnecessarily morally grey in her day-to-day life. Sure, she’d killed people, tortured criminals for information, broken a few laws, but partake in an affair? Help another woman cheat on her partner?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Never.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>It was something Rio <em>could<em> control and therefore she wouldn’t do it.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Was Agatha truly that fucked up? Evidently. Rio knew she had started it; she should’ve walked away like she had told herself to so many times. But Agatha had touched her, caressed her lip, gunned for the kiss.<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t make any fucking sense. Why was she okay with cheating? Was the woman not capable of love? How could she be so heartless?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe the person who rang wasn’t her partner? Maybe I should just…ask her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio shook away the thought. No. Never.<br/>
</p><p>She took another drag of her cigarette.<br/>
</p><p>If Agatha wanted to tell her about it, then she would’ve and she hadn’t.<br/>
</p><p>Rio took it back, maybe she wasn’t okay with dying from hypothermia. Her teeth chattered violently. She scolded herself for leaving without her fucking shoes, or a coat, or <em>something<em>. The only thing she’d thought to grab was her phone which had her key card and black card (it had the software she needed to download on either of the Archibold’s phones) in the wallet attached to it. A fat load of good either of those things would do right now. She had no intention of going back to her room, and Jack and Amelia were sound asleep the last time she checked.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She shut her mouth to let the cigarette smoke seep from her nose. With her eyes closed, Rio rolled her head back to try and help herself relax. Annoyingly, the feeling between her legs hadn’t quite disappeared. All she felt was this deep hatred for herself because why was it still there? She would never touch a woman in a relationship like that, and Agatha was a witch for trying to get her to.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rested the side of her face against her shoulder. A mistake. Her nose caught a whiff of Agatha’s fragrance that still clung to her clothes. Tears of anger began to prick Rio’s eyes. She had been so stupid.<br/>
</p><p>Pain shot through her middle finger as the cigarette butt burnt her skin. Rio dropped it with a jolt. On a normal day, that would’ve pissed her off. Today, Rio welcomed the pain as a distraction. As punishment…maybe. Maybe she deserved it.<br/>
</p><p>“Did you want another? Or maybe a coat?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to see her mission subject.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…”<br/>
</p><p>“Actually, I’m not giving you an option about the coat it's minus four degrees.” Jack slung his black North Face puffer over Rio’s shoulders. He held out a cigarette. “They’re golds.”<br/>
</p><p>A slow smile spread across Rio’s lips. “You’ve convinced me.”<br/>
</p><p>Jack returned her smile as he handed it to her.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said as he brought out his lighter. “For the jacket.”<br/>
</p><p>He nodded his head, and she came closer. She put her hand behind the lighter to block the wind as Jack flicked it. Orange sparks shot out, lighting Rio’s second cigarette in five years. He repeated the ritual for himself, took his first drag before he said:<br/>
</p><p>“It’s nothing. You want to tell me why you’re half dressed in the freezing cold at twelve in the morning?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio inhaled her cigarette, letting the action buy her time to think of an answer. She settled on something simple.<br/>
</p><p>“Couldn’t sleep.”<br/>
</p><p>Jack turned to her; his eyebrow raised to let her know he didn’t buy it. Luckily for Rio, he didn’t persist.<br/>
</p><p>“And where’s your wife?”<br/>
</p><p>“Where’s yours?” Rio shot back.<br/>
</p><p>Jack nodded. “Touché.”<br/>
</p><p>The pair stood in silence as they took drags of their cigarettes. Rio thought her toes were going to fall off. She was about to tell Jack to have a good night when he spoke first:<br/>
</p><p>“Wanna do shots?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s slow smile returned.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio had already almost broken one of her rules concerning professionalism tonight, one more wouldn’t hurt. Technically, this could be seen as helping the mission, getting drunk with her mission subject. She was getting Jack to warm up to her, well, that’s what she told herself anyway.<br/>
</p><p>Tequila burned her throat for the sixth time in half an hour. She wiped lazily at the liquid that missed her mouth and dribbled down her chin.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know how you do that without salt or a lime,” Jack laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged although she knew why. The harsh taste of the alcohol was burning out any feeling of Agatha against her skin, in her hair, on her lips-<br/>
</p><p>She grabbed another shot and tipped it down her throat.<br/>
</p><p>“Woah,” Jack waved his hand sluggishly. “Maybe I should cut you off? Wouldn’t want you dying from alcohol poisoning.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled as the alcohol <em>finally<em> had the effect, she’d wanted it to. She shut her eyes and let that feeling of numbness wash over her entire body. For the first time since the bathroom in the Thai restaurant after their first mission, Rio detached.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>All of the confusing, torturous feelings she had about her fake wife faded away into a pit of nothing. Rio sighed into the familiarity of it. If she wasn’t so drunk she would’ve been annoyed at herself for needing alcohol to get her to this place. She’d never needed any help with detaching before.<br/>
</p><p>When her father abandoned her, Rio had built up defences soon after. She never wanted to feel that sort of emptiness again. This meant letting few people get to know her and getting to know few people. The fewer people in her life, the fewer people who could affect her by leaving it. This meant pouring herself into her job, into her hobbies and interests, into her plants.<br/>
</p><p>Like Rio said, she didn’t think one person should affect another so deeply in such a short amount of time. She didn’t understand what made Agatha so different from anyone else she’d ever met.<br/>
</p><p>Rio hated her for it.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay?” Jack asked.<br/>
</p><p>She reopened her eyes, a breathless giggle floating out her mouth. “Never felt better.”<br/>
</p><p>He swivelled in his bar chair to face her. Rio could see there was a question on his tongue. She blinked at him slowly for several seconds waiting for the reveal.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes…” Rio said when the reveal didn’t come.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re avoiding your wife.” It was a statement, not a question.<br/>
</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “I don’t have a wife.” And technically, she didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>Jack laughed at that. “Me neither.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio giggled as Jack called the bartender behind the bar over to get them another round.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Their conversation flowed easily. Jack told her about his love for skiing and snowboarding, about the time he crashed into a tree and broke his nose, about the time he and his friends had gotten stuck on a ski lift in the middle of a snowstorm for five hours. Rio laughed sluggishly at his tales and at his terrible dad jokes. She told him very little about herself (obviously), sticking to general topics like basketball and how unlike Jack she hated snowboarding.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll be back, I’m just going to use the restroom.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded her response as she played with the straw in her rum and coke. She needed a new one, the paper had gone soggy, and it was making her drink taste like cardboard. She was about to wave the bartender over when her eyes landed on Jack’s phone. He’d left it? Oh, perfect! This just made Rio’s life that much easier.<br/>
</p><p>She fumbled in the pockets of her phone wallet, pulling at the black card with more effort than she would usually need considering her drunken state, and pressed it against the front of Jack’s phone. She watched as the screen whirled to life, flashed white before a circle appeared. The number zero sat in the middle, and Rio watched as the numbers climbed. To hide what she was doing, she rested her arm on the phone and called over the bartender to ask for a new straw.<br/>
</p><p>Why was it moving so slowly? The bartender had come and gone, she had discarded her new straw next to her and yet still the number on the phone read fifty-two percent complete. Rio looked around anxiously for Jack’s return, her right hand fidgeting with the tip of her straw.<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t make sense to her that the alcohol coursing through her veins made her even more alert than usual. She didn’t question it. There weren’t many people in the hotel bar, but she watched them all like hawks as she completed her mission.<br/>
</p><p>Jack’s phone read eighty-four per cent when she caught the first sight of him.<br/>
</p><p>He smiled at her as he made his way across the bar. Luckily, he had to cross the entire room to get there, and he bought her more time when he stumbled into a woman on the way out. As he apologised profusely, Rio folded over his phone and reached for one of the bottles behind the bar, her body shielding Jack’s phone from his view as long as he stayed behind her.<br/>
</p><p>She pretended to fish around the bar for a bottle. She couldn’t remove the card mid-process otherwise the software wouldn’t download. Several moments later, Jack appeared next to her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Shit.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“What are you doing?” His voice accusatory.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had been caught for the second time tonight.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you mean?” She played off her question cooly, her hand pressing harder into his phone.<br/>
</p><p>“I mean, what are you doing?” Jack paused. “Were you drinking without me?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio almost collapsed with the relief. “Was it obvious?” She snatched at a random bottle and threw it in the air before catching it again.<br/>
</p><p>When she resettled in her seat, she swiped the card from Jack’s phone in a drunken manner so it couldn’t be mistaken for anything but a drunken impulse. Rio was grateful to see <em>100%<em> on Jack’s phone before it disappeared. Jack hadn’t seemed to notice.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Orange vodka?” Jack said eyeing her. “Okay, interesting choice but let’s do it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio concealed her shock at her random choice with a pleased expression. “Okay then.”<br/>
</p><p>She fucking hated orange-flavoured things.<br/>
</p><p>“Excuse me,” the bartender had reappeared from god knows where. “Unfortunately, you can’t help yourself.”<br/>
</p><p>Jack and Rio turned to each other with knowing glances before turning their attention back to the woman.<br/>
</p><p>“What if we pour you one?”<br/>
</p><p>And that’s how Rio spent the rest of the early hours of the morning, behind a bar serving the rest of the people in the room alcohol. The bartender had given Jack access to the bar's speakers, and he blasted <em>2016’s Hot One Hundred<em> through them.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She danced the night away with alcohol getting poured down her throat, a hot bartender holding her hips and laughter filling her ears.<br/>
</p><p>Every thought about her fake wife forgotten.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio stumbled back into her hotel room at a quarter past six with a croissant she’d stolen from the breakfast buffet they had started to prepare at the restaurant next to the bar stuffed in her mouth. She was still extremely drunk, the room blurring as she felt along the walls to keep herself upright.</p><p>Her soul almost left her body when Agatha appeared in front of her. Even in Rio’s drunk haze, she noticed the dark bags underneath Agatha’s eyes, the way her hair sat an unruly nest on her head, the anxiousness written all over her face.</p><p>She hasn’t slept?</p><p>Had she been waiting for Rio to return?</p><p>A pang of guilt spread across Rio’s body before she shoved it away, replacing it with the pit void of feelings for the woman before her.</p><p>Agatha regarded her for a moment, taking her in, analysing her as if she were a lab experiment. Rio wanted to shrink into herself but resisted the urge, standing taller instead.</p><p>“You smell like a distillery.”</p><p>Rio laughed as if Agatha had told her the world’s funniest joke. She laughed so hard and for so long she folded over herself as she tried to suck in air to breathe. She regretted it immediately, the momentum of the action made her head spin and Rio pushed past Agatha and made a B-line for the toilet.</p><p>Without thought, she threw her half-eaten pastry on the floor and knelt in front of the toilet. Her body heaved and vomit spewed from her mouth. Rio tried to swipe her hair out of her face to stop her sick getting in it but failed miserably.</p><p>She found her hair being pulled back anyway. Agatha knelt behind her, held her hair, and started rubbing circles on her back. If Rio had the energy, she would’ve pushed her away.</p><p>She stayed hunched over the toilet bowl for what felt like hours, Agatha by her side whispering soothing words as her body contracted.<br/>
</p><p>Finally, her body gave out and she slumped against the cool porcelain. Rio surprised herself when she realised, she regretted nothing. She’d do the whole night all over again even if it meant heaving her guts out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hand withdrew and Rio tried to ignore the way her body twitched because of it.<br/>
</p><p>“Have a shower, Rio,” Agatha told her as if she were a teacher telling off a delinquent student.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Two hours later Rio was sat opposite her fake wife at breakfast. Although the vomiting and showering had sobered her up a bit, she still felt tipsy. She was glad for it; the hangover wouldn’t be hitting her anytime soon.<br/>
</p><p>With extra effort, her eyes focused on Amelia and her son across the restaurant. Jack wasn’t with them which came as no shock to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“You should eat something,” Agatha said, her tone flat.<br/>
</p><p>Rio glanced at her before returning her gaze to their mission subjects. “I’m alright.”<br/>
</p><p>Her stomach twisted at the thought of food.<br/>
</p><p>In the corner of her eye, she saw Agatha shaking her head.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not asking, here,” she put a baguette on Rio’s plate.<br/>
</p><p>She scoffed. “I’m not eating that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed and Rio knew she’d awoken some sort of beast. It fascinated her immediately, she was up for a challenge, anything would help to make it easier to hate the woman.<br/>
</p><p>“So, you’re going to go out of your way to jeopardise our mission because you can’t be asked to be at the top of your game?” Agatha smiled sweetly. “You're such a…<em>brat<em>.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio fought the urge to smack her. The way she’d said it, it was so layered, so meant to agitate, to catch her off guard, to taunt.<br/>
</p><p>She wouldn’t let Agatha have this one. She steeled herself before she said, “Well, I am a princess. What did you expect?”<br/>
</p><p>The thought of Rio calling <em>herself<em> a princess <em>again<em> made her want to cringe and vomit.<br/>
</em></em></em></em></p><p>“You-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cut herself off, her eyes falling across the room. Amelia and Jack’s son was leaving the table, Amelia didn’t look like she was moving. Perhaps he was going back to his father asleep in his room. The pair needed eyes on the boy, he didn’t have a tracker and he’d been with one of his parents up until now.<br/>
</p><p>Rio went to move before Agatha gripped her wrist across the table.<br/>
</p><p>“Stay here and eat something, and you better. I have absolutely no problem coming back here and cramming food down your throat. I’d do it happily. Put your com in and turn it on or so help me, Rio,” Agatha’s words shot through Rio’s skin like venom.<br/>
</p><p>She snatched her hand away from Rio’s wrist and stormed out of the restaurant.<br/>
</p><p>Rio kept watch of Amelia for the next hour, and no, she didn’t eat anything.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Once Amelia was done with breakfast she didn’t head back to her room, instead, she got on a ski lift. Rio followed suit.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re following Amelia up the mountain without telling me?” Agatha’s voice broke through the silence as she climbed up the slope.<br/>
</p><p>“What? How did you – you put a tracker on me?” Rio scoffed. “Of course, you fucking did.” She patted her body.<br/>
</p><p>“Give up now, you won’t find it,” Agatha said matter of factly.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t. Rio pulled out every pocket of her coat and ski trousers, slid her arms down the material of her clothes, shook them out, no sign of a tracker.<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” she mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you going to engage? You should, Jack hasn’t moved since I’ve been back, so I don’t think we’ll be getting the software on his phone anytime soon.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows until she realised Agatha didn’t know she had completed half the mission.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve already put the software on Jack’s phone.”<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause before Agatha asked a sceptical, “How?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, you see, we got given this card and all I had to do was-”<br/>
</p><p>It was clear Agatha wasn’t in the mood for Rio’s sarcasm. “I got that much. When did you do it?”<br/>
</p><p>“When I did,” was Rio’s short response as she hopped off the ski lift.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha said nothing after that.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio walked into the restaurant at the top of the slope, she found Amelia already sitting on one of the stools in front of the bar. The thought of sitting at <em>another<em> bar made Rio feel queasy but she did it anyway.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Amelia nodded at her when she sat down, and Rio returned it. An obnoxious growl escaped her stomach, and her cheeks flushed red with embarrassment.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman turned to her with an amused smile. “The truffle fries here are really good by the way.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, turning away shyly. “I’ll have to give them a go.”<br/>
</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Rio had a bowl of fries and a glass of water in front of her and Amelia had a whisky, neat, as she typed furiously on her phone.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wasn’t chewing properly, and her food had gotten lodged in her throat. It brought back memories of the day before, of Agatha almost choking on her own fries. Rio caught herself smiling and a wave of nausea that had been plaguing her all day made another appearance.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay?” Amelia said. “You look like you’re going to throw up.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio waved her off. “Yeah, I’m good, just hungover.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah. Well, you know the trick is to just keep drinking and then you won’t feel it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed before gulping down her water.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you getting so angry about? On your phone I mean, if you don’t mind me asking.”<br/>
</p><p>Amelia chuckled. “No, it’s fine. I’m trying to download this game that my son plays, you know, so I can bond with him, but I can’t find it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Let me see,” Rio gestured for Amelia to pass her phone.<br/>
</p><p>She saw the woman hesitate, why wouldn’t she? She was the owner of a multi-million dollar tech company after all, before she appeared to deem Rio as unthreatening and handed her phone over.<br/>
</p><p>With the black card hidden beneath her hand, she pressed it to the back of Amelia’s phone, watched it flash white and the zero appear. Luckily for Rio, Amelia’s phone took to the software in seconds. The download was complete before she could blink.<br/>
</p><p>The screen cleared and Rio discovered the error in Amelia’s ways. In the search bar in the app store, she’d been searching for, ‘Candy Crush,’ instead of ‘Candy Cars.’ That’s what she assumed she was looking for anyway. A mission a couple of months ago where she’d had to go undercover as a high school science teacher to protect a senator's kid had gotten Rio very well-versed in all the games twelve-year-olds were into.<br/>
</p><p>“Is this it?” She showed the phone to Amelia.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes! Oh, it's Candy <em>Cars<em>, I can’t keep up,” she laughed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio found it odd that she wasn’t aware of trending apps considering she was the owner of a tech company, but she refrained from bringing it up, technically she wasn’t supposed to know who Amelia was.<br/>
</p><p>“You are an angel. Hopefully, this means my son will actually talk to me,” she played it off as a joke, but Rio could hear the sadness in her voice. Amelia swiped at a tear before she cleared her throat. </p><p>“Excuse me a moment.” She smiled weakly before she got off her chair and headed toward the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>Rio got why Agatha felt bad for her now.<br/>
</p><p>She took another drink of water relieved that this mission was finally fucking over, and she could go home. She pushed more fries in her mouth, any excuse to prolong going back to her hotel room where Agatha would be until she heard it.<br/>
</p><p>Muffled, but undeniable to ears that have been trained to pick out those exact noises.<br/>
</p><p>Screams.<br/>
</p><p>Amelia’s.</p>

<p>
<em>The fucking nerve.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha had said Rio’s name three times and was with met with silence. Rio had taken her com out. It had taken everything inside of her not to scream out in anger before she pulled on her coat, retrieved her gun from the safe and stormed out of her hotel room.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha brought her gun on instinct. She hadn’t needed it yet, but it felt right to have, to aim at Rio perhaps for pushing her to her fucking limit.<br/>
</p><p>She replayed yesterday's events on a loop as the ski lift dragged her up the mountain to her infuriating fake wife. The look on Rio’s face when she’d caught her staring at her in the bathroom mirror, the desperate yearning and shock of being caught, Rio’s hand firm against her hip, her <em>scent<em> distinct to Rio and Rio alone curling around her as their lips touched.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>And then Rio had ran.<br/>
</p><p>She had left Agatha alone with nothing to protect her from her own vitriolic thoughts.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Of course, she ran away. There’s nothing good about you.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>She knows letting you in would be just the same as inviting the devil into her home.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>You were born evil.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>They weren’t really Agatha’s words; they were more of her mother’s in Agatha’s voice.<br/>
</p><p>She’d tried to shove them away, to remind herself they weren’t true, but the longer that passed without Rio’s return the harder it became. Not to mention she was worried something had happened to her. Rio had left in nothing but her pyjama top and shorts; she hadn’t even put on shoes.<br/>
</p><p>When the other woman had returned over six hours later, Agatha hadn’t slept a wink. Her fear and anxiety morphing into anger when she realised Rio was fucking drunk. And although Agatha knew she had no legs to stand on when it came to using substances as coping mechanisms, that didn’t make her any less furious.<br/>
</p><p>She’d held Rio’s hair back and helped her stay calm as she spewed her guts out even though she thought Rio didn’t deserve her kindness. Some part of Agatha, a part of her she didn’t understand, couldn’t bring herself to leave Rio to deal with it on her own.<br/>
</p><p>As Rio spent an absurd amount of time in the shower afterwards, Agatha fought off tears that kept pricking her eyes. She wouldn’t cry about this; Agatha hadn’t cried for far worse.<br/>
</p><p>She’d been so lost in thought that she almost missed getting off the lift at the top of the mountain. In her daze, she hopped off, swaying a little as her ankle landed funny and twisted in the snow. Shaking her emotions away, Agatha began to walk the path up to Rio’s location.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes scanned the restaurant for the other woman twice before she concluded Rio wasn’t there. She pulled out her phone to recheck her location. Rio was still in the building.<br/>
</p><p>So where was she?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha picked up on the way a chair at the bar faced to the left instead of forward like the others as if the person sitting in it had gotten up in a hurry. She made her way towards it and then past it noting the bowl of half-eaten fries, a half-empty glass of water and the whisky next to it.<br/>
</p><p>The corridor she found herself in broke away from the restaurant and towards the restrooms. Agatha entered the ladies to her right, called Rio’s name and kicked open all the cubical doors. They and the rest of the bathroom were empty. She repeated the process for the men’s room, waving off a man’s complaint about her being in there when she wasn’t supposed to be.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha made her way further down the corridor to the glass door at the end. That’s when she spotted it, the dot of crimson just in front of the door. Her hand flew to her gun in its holster as she pulled it out and nudged the door open with her shoulder.<br/>
</p><p>A gust of wind hit her instantly and Agatha grit her teeth together. The blood was unmissable now, sticking out like the north star in the night sky alongside two sets of footprints. She followed the trail behind the restaurant as it went down another slope. A black van came into view at the same time the spots of blood stopped, and the trail of footprints became one. The prints that remained were large, a European size forty-six if she had to guess; far too big to be Rio’s or Amelia’s.<br/>
</p><p>The sound of blows behind the van caught Agatha’s attention. She started at a sprint, only stopping once she was concealed behind the vehicle. She caught sight of Rio in the distance. Thumping and muffled screams from inside the van split her attention momentarily before it returned to her fake wife fending off two men in all black twice her size.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wasn’t the slightest bit surprised to see Rio doing a brilliant job at holding her own. One of the men had picked her up by the waist and she was using it to her advantage, kicking out at the man who was trying to get hold of her legs. It appeared they were trying to drag her away from the van and Rio wasn’t letting them. Agatha realised then that she hadn’t been ignoring her, and her com had likely been ripped out in the commotion.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha winced as she heard the snap of a neck. The man trying to grab Rio’s legs face came into view as he bent backwards, blood pouring from his shattered nose. Rio had kicked him in the face. His eyes fluttered shut as he fell backwards, landing contorted in the snow.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha’s eyes returned to Rio, she had freed her trapped right arm and was elbowing the other man in the eye. He dropped her from the impact. She was turning on him when he retrieved a knife from seemingly nowhere and sliced the hand curled into a fist aimed at his face. Rio dropped her hand before she tried again, powering through as if a blade hadn’t sliced through her ski gloves and into her skin. He hadn't been expecting the second punch but unfortunately, his reflexes were quick. He stepped back, caught Rio's fist and twisted her arm behind her back so that she was pressed up against his body. His knife against her throat.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha watched as the man pulled down his ski mask revealing pale skin and blue eyes. He was whispering harsh words into Rio’s ear as she squirmed against him, never giving up in her attempts to free herself. The undeniable discomfort on Rio’s face was enough to kick Agatha into action. She couldn’t hear what was being said, but Rio looked like she wanted to throw up.<br/>
</p><p>The necessary movements were muscle memory now as Agatha held up her gun. The shot was a dangerous one. The slightest movement on Rio’s part would send the bullet into her instead of the enemy, but Agatha had made this shot once before. And Agatha always hit her intended targets (well, apart from the one time).<br/>
</p><p>She sucked in a breath, relaxed her body, focused on her target, and pulled.<br/>
</p><p>The recoil rippled through her body as the bullet hit its mark just above Rio’s head. She watched as her target fell backwards into the snow like a bolder toppling over. The other woman’s eyes flared, scanning her surroundings until they landed on Agatha concealed behind the black van.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t look long enough to see Rio’s reaction, instead turning to the van door to yank it open. There she found Amelia, her hands and feet bound by rope, her mouth gagged with a piece of cloth. She had a gash on the left side of her forehead and her blood was staining her dazzling white ski jacket.<br/>
</p><p>Amelia’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion at Agatha’s appearance. She grabbed the pocket knife in her pocket and started tugging at Amelia’s ropes.<br/>
</p><p>She became aware of footsteps coming up behind her. Agatha didn’t turn around.<br/>
</p><p>“You could’ve taken my fucking head off!” Rio shouted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as Amelia’s bondage broke free.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you hurt?” Agatha asked in the voice she used when on the job.<br/>
</p><p>Amelia shook her head, pulling the gag from her mouth. “It’s only my head.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Alright. Let’s get that checked out.”<br/>
</p><p>She held her hand out and Amelia took it to help her step out of the van. She all but pushed Rio out of the way as they made their way back to the restaurant.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was glad to be home.<br/>
</p><p>She’d taken Amelia to the medical centre, watched as she recounted the events to her husband who looked like he was going to burst into tears the more she spoke. He had hugged her afterwards and told her he’d never leave her alone again. They’d kissed and it was so charged and passionate it made Agatha feel nauseous. Even Amelia’s son had put his phone down to express his concern. She’d kissed his cheek, and he’d collapsed in her arms, sobbing.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t have a clue who had tried to kidnap Amelia or why, but she’d reported it back to the agency and they’d thanked her for it. She hadn’t spoken a word to Rio since she’d shot a gun at her. They barely acknowledged each other on the journey back to New York and as soon as she’d stepped into their house she’d disappeared into her room.<br/>
</p><p>For the first time in a long time, Agatha was lost. She didn’t know what to do about her fake wife. They had made so much progress on the first night of the Switzerland mission. Rio had spooned her, to warm her up, but still. It had opened a door. They had begun touching each other without thought. She remembered Rio’s hand reaching out to grab hers across the table at breakfast, the way she had cupped Rio’s face in her hands after she’d attacked her with snow. How they had been less afraid to share things about themselves.<br/>
</p><p>Now it felt like they were back to square one and Agatha didn’t understand why. Was it because of how intimate the touches had become? She didn’t think so, it wasn’t like them being attracted to one another wasn’t common knowledge. She knew as much as Rio that they’d been enamoured with the other since day one. She couldn’t place why Rio had pulled away so abruptly.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t want to think about it anymore.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha took a long shower, got into her pyjamas and her own bed (finally). And fell asleep moments later.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha spent the day in the cinema room covered in blankets and surrounded by snacks. She needed an escape and always found it in films. It was one of her healthier coping mechanisms. So far, she’d watched <em>The Shinning, Die Hard, The Craft<em> and was now ten minutes into <em>Grown Ups<em>. She was laughing at the face Kurt made at the four-year-old who was still being breastfed when Rio appeared.<br/>
</em></em></em></em></p><p>Agatha froze. She hadn’t expected to see her today or ever. The film continued to play as Agatha realised, she wouldn’t be acknowledging Rio’s presence, and she definitely would not be stopping one of her favourite films for her. Her fake wife settled in the chair two seats away and turned her attention to the large screen in front of them.<br/>
</p><p>Not a single word passed between the two, only their laughs filled the room at the ridiculous film.<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t until some time later when Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“I also want to get chocolate wasted, pass me that,” she pointed at the bag of Reece’s Pieces by Agatha’s lap.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed before she paused the film. They weren’t doing this. They weren’t going to pretend everything was normal between the two of them (whatever normal was) and that Rio hadn’t run away, and that Agatha hadn’t been cruel with her remarks, and that they hadn’t spoken in over a day.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sunk further into her chair. The silence in the room was <em>loud<em>. So loud that Agatha could hear her own heartbeat thumping irritatingly against her ear. She thought the quiet might suffocate her as it neared the ten-minute mark, so, in true Agatha fashion, she said the first spiteful thought that came to mind:<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I’m going to ask for a new partner.”<br/>
</p><p>She watched as Rio’s body went ridged, spotted the brief panic in her eyes before Rio concealed it behind in difference.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” was Rio’s only response. She sounded so far away again, like the way she had spoken about her dead Abuela.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t meant it, she just wanted to see how Rio would react. She hadn’t anticipated Rio not reacting at all. It was so easy for her, wasn’t it? She scoffed before resuming the film.<br/>
</p><p>It was probably for the best anyway.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stood and left the room.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t want Agatha to get a new partner. She wanted Agatha to be hers and hers only. She didn’t think she had the right to be so possessive, but she was doing it anyway. How long did it take to be reassigned in The Smith’s Programme? Was it like main operations where it could take a matter of days? Could she intervene and tell Hihi Agatha couldn’t leave her because of some bullshit she’d have to make up?<br/>
</p><p>Rio had surprised herself at how easily her detachment came as she answered the other woman’s statement. She’d felt anything but detached like she always did when it came to Agatha. She’d noted how her fake wife didn’t seem to care, resuming her film as if she’d just mentioned she was going out to get some fucking eggs.<br/>
</p><p>She knew that Agatha getting a new partner would probably be for the best for both of them. Their relationship so far had been so confusing, so unstable, so <em>exciting<em>. And yes okay, so maybe Agatha had a lover, but whatever they had was something <em>real<em>. Even if they were only meant to be friends, Rio didn’t want to lose the fragile thing that they had. It had brought something different into her life that she’d never experienced before. She didn’t think she had any new experiences to endure because of her line of work and yet here she was.<br/>
</em></em></em></em></p><p>Rio had retreated into the living room after she’d left the cinema room. She pulled open her laptop, opened her emails and dragged the photo she’d sent herself into the picture icon in Google. It was a picture she’d snapped of Agatha after their snowball fight. She’d shoved the phone in her face catching her fake wife off-guard as she scowled into the lens.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to know more about the woman who might become her ex-fake wife before she disappeared from her life forever. Biting down on her nails, she waited as Google scoured the internet for images that matched. She stilled when the page loaded. Slowly, Rio pulled her fingers out of her mouth as her eyes made their way down her laptop screen. She read headline after headline looked at image after image:<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>O’Connor’s daughter caught coked again:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>An image of a teenage Agatha snorting a line in a dingey bathroom with a boy she registered as Samuel from the art exhibition and another woman was attached below.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Multi-millionaire’s spectacle off-spring shocks no one in her latest stunt:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>This image depicted Agatha mid mid-make-out session with another girl behind a dumpster. She couldn’t have been more than sixteen.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Would this image put your heavily religious mother in hospital? Because it sure did Manhattan’s most infamous delinquent’s:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>There were two images this time. Agatha leaving a club with two champagne bottles in her hand. She drank from one whilst the other was pressed against her chest as if she were scared someone would try to take it from her. She was accompanied by four other teenagers. A girl with a shaved head and bright pink top, Samuel once again, a blonde-headed girl that Rio vaguely remembered seeing in a film once and a boy with blue hair. They were all laughing as if they didn’t have a care in the world, and Rio thought that perhaps they didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>The image next to it was a woman in a hospital bed. She wore a gold cross around her neck that you wouldn’t miss from a kilometre away. Her hair was grey and black and wrapped in a clasp behind her head. She was unconscious and yet she still looked so put together, so cold. She gave Rio chills.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>The princess of the Upper East Side gives paparazzi the bird as she escapes in an older woman’s vehicle:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>The inside scoop of O’Connor Industries' new building’s grand opening:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
This was the first image that looked staged to Rio. Patrick O’Connor who she now recognised as the founder of O’Connor Industries; the company that specialised in transporting technology to places of employment around the country.<br/>
</p><p>She had a case on the company a couple of years back when the FBI suspected some members of committing embezzlement fraud to fund wars overseas. High-profile lawyers had gotten involved, and the case had been dropped.<br/>
</p><p>Patrick was pressing a kiss to a young Agatha’s forehead, and she was smiling as if she were disgusted whilst simultaneously pleased at her father’s outwardly affection. The woman next to Agatha, who Rio realised was the woman from the hospital bed and who must be Agatha’s mother looked straight at the camera, her expression void of emotions. That large gold cross hung unmistakably around her neck.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>This<em> was who her fake wife was? Rio couldn’t believe it. She hadn’t had much access to the internet when she was growing up and she had no interest in the newspapers her Abuela read at the breakfast table before school so she wouldn’t have recognised Agatha anyway. How someone so known by the world would be allowed to become an FBI agent was beyond her.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“Ah. My best bits.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio jumped as she slammed her laptop screen shut.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed, appearing from behind the couch. She didn’t seem the slightest bit annoyed by Rio’s snooping. She had changed, now wearing all black in the form of a sports zip-up that covered her chin and lips, leggings and Uggs.<br/>
</p><p>Rio offered her a weak, “Sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s alright. I’ll just have to do the same to you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio refrained from telling her she wouldn't find anything. That unlike her she was nobody.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to leave, and Rio couldn’t allow it, not now. She was so intrigued by the woman, by her wife. She wanted to know everything about her and because of this, she blurted out her next words:<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t want you to get a new partner!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stilled.<br/>
</p><p>“I…I want to be yours,” Rio stuttered. “If you’ll let me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned, a smirk on her face and Rio wanted to punch her. She nodded her head towards their front door.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>“Where?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“On a walk. Think we could both use the fresh air.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t surprise Rio when they ended up in Central Park. Agatha offered to buy them coffee from a stand and Rio let her.<br/>
</p><p>They had so much to talk about, so much to unpack, and Rio didn’t know where to start. She wasn’t good at that, the talking about her feelings. She thought she should ask Agatha about her lover first because that would clear the air, set the record straight.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t bring herself to do it.<br/>
</p><p>The thought of knowing that Agatha was in love with someone else threatened to destroy her. No matter how hard she tried Rio knew she wouldn’t be able to detach from it, but she also knew there wasn’t a chance in hell she would expel Agatha from her life now that she was in it.<br/>
</p><p>She broached a topic she could actually handle.<br/>
</p><p>“So…you are Agatha O’Connor?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sipped her coffee as she shook her head. “Used to be. I had to change it when I joined the FBI because it was too recognisable. I took my mother’s maiden name instead.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrow for Agatha to continue. The other woman laughed in response.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s Harkness.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio let the name bounce around in her head. <em>Agatha Harkness.<em> She liked it. It sounded right.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Well, nice to meet you, Agatha Harkness, I’m Rio Vidal,” she held out her hand for Agatha to take.<br/>
</p><p>This was like their first encounter but in reverse. This felt new, like a complete reset.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha reached out and shook it. “Nice to meet you, Rio Vidal.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio tried to ignore the way her entire body buzzed at the sound of her name on Agatha’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>“You have a beautiful name,” Agatha said, holding Rio’s gaze.<br/>
</p><p>She cursed herself for the way her breath hitched, and it was only then she realised neither of them had let go of the other’s hand.<br/>
</p><p>Rio vaguely made out a playful laugh and screams coming from behind them as she let Agatha’s blue eyes drown her. It was the other woman breaking contact that snapped her back into reality.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, baby,” Agatha said as she lifted a small form onto her hips.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked, her eyes darting between Agatha and the little boy who squealed as she pressed kisses into his cheeks.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha tried to ignore the shock on Rio’s face as she held her son. She had never wanted Rio to know. One, for Nicholas’ protection, she was supposed to have severed all ties from her former life, and two, she wanted to avoid an interaction like this where she’d be forced to explain.<br/>
</p><p>It was just her luck Nicky was here at the same time she and her fake wife were. Manhattan was so fucking big this never should’ve happened. Agatha planted one more kiss on her son's cheek. He pushed at her face as she put her coffee on the bench next to her so she couldn’t spill it on him.<br/>
</p><p>“Where have you been, Mama?” His giggle dying and a frown replacing it.<br/>
</p><p>“Remember when Mama said she’d have to go away for a while and only talk on the phone?” Agatha replied as she swayed her five-year-old.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky nodded. “But you said you’d be far. This isn’t far.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed at her son's sharpness. It shouldn’t surprise her anymore, there had been so many other occasions where he’d caught her out like this.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded slowly. “No, you are right. This isn’t very far, is it?” She tickled his stomach, and that giggle reappeared.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky’s head twisted and Agatha sucked in a breath as he locked on to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman cleared her throat. “Erm…hi…I’m…I’m Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky was silent and Agatha thought she might have to prompt him into a reply before he said:<br/>
</p><p>“Nicky.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Nicky,” Rio said, her smile warm.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re pretty.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked at her son's forwardness which again she should be used to as he got it from her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed red before she said an awkward thank you.<br/>
</p><p>“Nicholas?”<br/>
</p><p>That voice froze Agatha in place. It had felt like so long since she’d last heard it when in reality it had only been two weeks.<br/>
</p><p>“I found Mama,” Nicky squealed in excitement, completely unaware of how Agatha’s arm had tensed as she held him.<br/>
</p><p>“I can see that, but what have I told you about running off?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned in the voice's direction, her eyes locking on to those green ones she’d fallen in love with all those years ago. It was comical to her now that she felt absolutely nothing.<br/>
</p><p>“I thought you were relocating.”<br/>
</p><p>“I did.”<br/>
</p><p>“Where? To across the road?” Wanda snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt venom crawling up her throat ready to spit and harm her ex with. She steeled herself instead.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s not do this in front of him,” Agatha gritted out as Nicky stirred on her hip.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes before her gaze shifted to Rio. Agatha watched her size Rio up before her face split into a fake smile.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda, nice to meet you.”<br/>
</p><p>The awkwardness Rio usually displayed when she met new people disappeared when she answered:<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, you too.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wondered where the confidence had come from.<br/>
</p><p>“Mommy, isn’t Rio pretty?” Nicky asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tried to hide her smile at her son asking the question she’d never get away with asking herself.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda inhaled a seething breath as she said, “Extremely. Now we gotta go.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky whined as Agatha lowered him to the ground. He squeezed her legs one more time before he took Wanda’s outstretched hand. Wanda began to tug him away before Nicky turned.<br/>
</p><p>“Mama because you’re back can you come visit?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha locked eyes with Wanda who pursed her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“We’ll figure something out, okay baby?”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky pouted but accepted Wanda’s words with a nod.<br/>
</p><p>“Bye, Rio. Bye, Mama,” Nicky said as he waved.<br/>
</p><p>The two wives waved back.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha inhaled deeply as she retrieved her coffee from the bench. Where the fuck did she start when trying to explain all of that? To Agatha’s surprise, Rio spoke first.<br/>
</p><p>“You two have a beautiful kid.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha could tell the compliment was sincere even as Rio’s voice waved.<br/>
</p><p>“That was my ex,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>She watched Rio’s entire body relax at her words. She smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“And technically Nicky’s not hers. He only has my DNA and the donors. She got custody because I run from exploding buildings and shoot bullets at criminals in ski resorts.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Yeah, that’ll do it.”<br/>
</p><p>The women continued their walk in a comfortable silence, each taking sips from their respective coffee cups. Agatha loved Central Park in April, after the bleak winter the park seemed to come alive again in the form of the sea of pink from the cherry blossoms sprouting from their trees and the array of colours from flowers (not all of them she could name) popping out from the earth. When she was younger it always symbolised hope. That yeah, maybe she’d had the worst couple of months of her life with seasonal depression and her mother’s verbal abuse, but things were looking up.<br/>
</p><p>She looked to Rio then, her fake wife’s eyes darting everywhere as she took in her surroundings. Rio looked like a kid at Disneyland.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t looked at her, it was Agatha laughing that grabbed her attention.<br/>
</p><p>“What? Did you say something?”<br/>
</p><p>“I just said it’s beautiful.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said as if she were mortified by the fact that Agatha had to repeat herself. “Yes, it is.” She paused before she spoke again, her voice near a whisper, “I…I never got to come here much so it’s all still surreal to me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio still hadn’t looked at her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha collected her thoughts. She wanted to say the right thing, didn’t want Rio to regret sharing parts of herself, parts that seemed like she didn’t talk about often.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck me,” Rio said after a while. “Who knew me opening up was all it took to shut you up,” she laughed then. “I’m going to have to do it more often.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “You will. Takes a lot to shut me up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, trust me,” Rio’s lips curled further, “I know.”<br/>
</p><p>“What is it about plants you love so much?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked at her for the first time since they’d parted with Nicky.<br/>
</p><p>“How do you know that? I’ve never told you that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow as if to say, ‘Are you serious?’ Before she answered:<br/>
</p><p>“I’m an FBI agent and even my expertise wouldn’t be necessary to figure that out, Rio. You spend every waking moment in the garden, <em>Rooftop Gardening: Hidden Secrets<em> is glued to you whenever you walk about the house, the way you spouted out the difference between Cedar trees and Pine trees as if were common knowledge at The Met, your favourite colour is green, should I go on?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio stuck her tongue in her cheek. “Didn’t realise you were so desperate to get to know me.”<br/>
</p><p>A realisation hit Agatha then. That remark, that was something she would’ve said. Rio always had a way of meeting her where she was at. Whether that be with disarming comebacks, during missions, during casual conversations. Agatha would challenge and Rio would have no problem challenging back with the same energy.<br/>
</p><p>She’d never had that with someone before, and she definitely didn’t think she would find it in the seemingly strange and awkward woman she met on the first day of their marriage.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had met her match, and she felt sorry for the world that it’d probably have to pay for it.<br/>
</p><p>“Who was the one who was googling me earlier again?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips snapped shut and Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let the silence drag on for a beat before she said, “I like plants because they don’t talk.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha knew the reason was deeper than that, but it was evident that Rio wasn’t ready to tell her. She nodded instead of prying. She took another sip of coffee before Rio spoke again.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I ask you something? You…you don’t have to answer.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stopped to look at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Why did you become an agent? It seemed like you had <em>everything.”<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha realised she wasn’t ready to say the deeper reasoning behind Rio’s question either. She shrugged. “Pictures are just pictures.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes searched her. To Agatha, it felt like she was looking at every curve, every line, every feature and then looking past those as well. She felt so <em>seen<em> and it terrified her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio nodded like she understood there was more but like Agatha would not pry.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, they are.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>It had been two weeks since Rio had met Nicky in Central Park, and in those two weeks, they had been on three missions where Rio had pushed Agatha out of a plane, almost drowned her when she forced them to escape a mission through a trapdoor that opened up at the bottom of the Hudson River and very nearly sent them hurdling off the side of a cliff during a car chase.<br/>
</p><p>During each of these incidents, Agatha seriously wondered if Rio had made a deal with the devil. Rio was fearless, she acted as if she couldn’t be killed, as if she were Death herself. And when Agatha had asked about it, Rio would simply shrug as if it were nothing, as if falling from the sky was something everyone did.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t name what it was Rio exuded when she was like this, all she could say was that it felt like Rio was a robot going through the actions without a thought…detached? Maybe?<br/>
</p><p>And the icing on top of the cake for Agatha was that she hadn’t been mad at Rio afterwards. Sure, the first time Rio pushed her out of a plane without a parachute was a shock to the system and she’d screamed bloody murder at her fake wife, but when it had passed…<br/>
</p><p>Adrenaline. Agatha was dizzy with it like she’d taken a pill or something.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t kidding when she’d realised, she had met her match. For every insane thing Rio did Agatha wanted to match it, supersede it. So, when Rio had grabbed her mid-air and landed them safely on the tarmac of the private airport, Agatha pulled out a flashbang and threw it at the tanks of plane fuel being prepared for use. The tanks had caught fire in an instant spreading across the tarmac and engulfing the plane with their mission targets inside. They’d tried to flee, to escape without the flames licking them. They failed. Agatha watched with a smirk as the east coast's most notorious sex traffickers burnt alive by the flames she’d caused.<br/>
</p><p>She’d almost killed herself and Rio in the interim. She’d been so wrapped up in the moment that she hadn’t noticed the flames shooting towards them from the spilt gasoline that surrounded them. Rio had, had to drag her away.<br/>
</p><p>The only reason they’d had to escape from a trapdoor was because Agatha had been dilly-dallying to slip the poison into corrupt French politician Raphael Dubois’ drink. She was proving to Rio she could get it done just before all their safe options out of the building got closed off at 1 am. Somewhere in between proving her point and completing their mission, she’d gotten lost in Rio’s eyes, in her smile, in her laugh and the minutes had dwindled to nothing.<br/>
</p><p>As for Rio almost driving them off the cliff edge, technically that was neither of their faults, the mission hadn’t gone smoothly, not all of them can do. Rio was driving recklessly because they had to avoid being caught. The Salem Seven mafia were on their tails. Rio had swerved near the cliff's edge to avoid a car ramming into them and Agatha had been the one to grab the wheel and drive them over it. She was just glad they weren’t in their Land Rover and instead their Ferrari Portofino. They’d jumped out of the car and into the ocean with minor injuries.<br/>
</p><p>When they hadn’t been fighting crime, the two had started to become more comfortable with one another. Rio didn’t hesitate before telling Agatha random facts about herself and Agatha didn’t shy away from showing Rio more than just her bold and sarcastic demeanour.<br/>
</p><p>Days they’d been at home they’d started making breakfast together. Agatha could cook, Rio couldn’t. She tried, of course, but everything was either burnt or undercooked and Agatha always had to take over or guide Rio through the instructions step by step. Rio joked that she was surprised Agatha could even cook because she’d probably had a private chef. Agatha had told her she had and that shut her up.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky called often and when he did Agatha didn’t hide. At times she’d even put him on speaker so he could talk to both her and Rio. He’d tell them about his day at school and they’d tell him a child-appropriate version of their latest mission. Nicky informed them he wanted to learn Spanish because the new girl in his class who had moved to the States from Mexico didn’t know any English. He felt bad for her, wanted to make her feel included, and Agatha had never felt prouder.<br/>
</p><p>She’d offered Rio up to teach him and as reluctant as her fake wife was, she eventually agreed after Nicky’s pleading. No one could ever say no to that boy.<br/>
</p><p>Neither of them spoke about their past again, neither of them ready. That can of worms would be opened in due time.<br/>
</p><p>Now, on the official one-month anniversary of their wedding, Rio and Agatha were in the back of a pickup truck somewhere in Argentina after infiltrating and dismantling an illegal dog racing ring. They hadn’t showered in days. Rio was covered from head to toe in dirt, soot, and dried blood and her bottom lip had been busted open from when she’d gotten punched in the face.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha thought she’d never looked more beautiful.<br/>
</p><p>Rio glanced over at her from where they sat side by side in the truck. “Quit staring at me before you give yourself an aneurysm.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled, her eyes dropping to her crossed legs without meaning to.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>This fucking woman. Since when do I get nervous? I don’t ever get nervous.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Are you blushing or is that sunburn?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to strangle her.<br/>
</p><p>“Sunburn.”<br/>
</p><p>“Liar,” Rio said with a smirk.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t have this. She needed the upper hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t pretend you weren’t staring at my ass when I had to climb that roof earlier.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio's ears went pink, and Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Exactly. So, shut up.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes playfully. “Sue me.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t blame you; I would look too.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scowled at her and Agatha winked.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, happy one-month anniversary by the way. As a shock to the both of us, we haven’t killed each other…yet.”<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha turned to look at her, a smile on her face, Rio’s eyebrows were furrowed.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked an edge of concern in her voice.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing. Just hasn't felt like it.” Rio shrugged. “I guess time means nothing when I’m with you.”</p>

<p>A weight, although she wasn’t sure who put it there, felt like it had been lifted from Rio’s shoulders ever since she found out about Nicky and Wanda the ex.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had never considered that Agatha’s baby, was her <em>actual<em> baby. Her sweet little boy with dark brown eyes that had reminded Rio of someone she couldn’t place.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She wasn’t angry at Agatha for not telling her, she had no right to be. Plus, she understood. Nicky needed protecting and Agatha couldn’t have known if Rio could be trusted. She wouldn’t have trusted her if it were the other way around. The protection of a child is not to be messed with.<br/>
</p><p>She almost wished she’d been brave enough to ask, but as Rio had said, she wouldn’t have been able to handle the knowledge of Agatha being in love with someone else. And she wouldn’t let herself decipher why that was (she knew exactly why).<br/>
</p><p>Rio squeezed her legs together as her latest sex dream receded into the back of her mind. Ever since they’d gotten back from Argentina three days ago, the second she closed her eyes for even a moment she was taken right back to that moment in the back of that lorry:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“You, okay?” Agatha breathed, panting heavily.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>She and Rio had almost missed sneaking into the back of their transportation to the location of the illegal dog racing ring. They were surrounded by sedated dogs in cages, filming equipment and dozens of cardboard boxes. There wasn’t any space to breathe let alone stand or sit. Agatha was pressed up against a wall in the corner of the lorry and Rio was flush against her. They couldn’t be discovered easily if they made themselves small.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio nodded. “Yeah. Are you?” She’d found Agatha’s eyes in the dim light, and they’d be trained on her as if she hadn’t been looking at anything else.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Mhm.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>The lorry jolted and Rio almost fell into the boxes next to her. Agatha caught her by the waist, her fingers touching her bare skin because Rio’s shirt had bunched up from where she’d caught her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha held her gaze for a long moment, studying her to see if she was alright.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You, okay?” She slowly pulled Rio to stand straight.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>This time Rio couldn’t get out a sound let alone words. She only managed a nod.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha didn’t let go of her after that, her hands remained on Rio’s hips as the journey went on. At some point, Rio had let her arms rest on Agatha’s. She was inches away from the other woman’s lips and all she could think about was what would happen if she just leaned forward to kiss them.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>She hadn’t.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>There had been many incidents like that one, always a spark or pulse of tension that occurred between the pair on accident. A teasing remark that hit too close to home, a touch that lingered dangerously close to a body part that craved the other woman’s touch, a tight space that forced them to be inches away from one another.<br/>
</p><p>Rio thought she might be going insane (more so than usual). They hadn’t even <em>kissed<em>, and she was this hung up over her fake wife? She didn’t get it.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She wasn’t sure if it was because they were too busy jumping out of planes and trying not to drown in large bodies of water why it hadn’t happened yet, but it didn't bother her. From what she’d gathered from her relationship with Agatha over this past month is that it was bound to happen. It was inevitable even, and she would wait a lifetime to kiss her wife if that’s what it took.<br/>
</p><p>She stretched before shoving her sheets aside, getting out of bed and walking out into the corridor. She didn’t even knock as she barged into Agatha’s bedroom. It had become a ritual. Rio would wake up, cram down any lingering thoughts about her dream where she’d fuck her fake wife, and then she would barge into said fake wife’s bedroom minutes later.<br/>
</p><p>Rio flopped onto Agatha’s bed, her body landing on top of one of Agatha’s knees. The other woman yelped, and Rio ignored her, burying her face deeper into the mattress.<br/>
</p><p>“And good morning to you too,” Agatha huffed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio mumbled something incoherent, and Agatha nudged her with her foot.<br/>
</p><p>“What was that? Speak up, Vidal.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stiffened at the use of her last name. Agatha had used it before, used it often actually, and every time she did Rio felt the same stupid butterflies in her stomach.<br/>
</p><p>“I said,” Rio twisted to face Agatha. “Good morning.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh!” Agatha exclaimed melodramatically. “And how did you want me to guess that when you’re mumbling like a toddler?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “What’s for breakfast?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha put down the book she was reading. “What are you in the mood for?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pondered this for a moment, her eyes tilted up to the ceiling as her thoughts swirled. “Fruit. Fresh fruit.”<br/>
</p><p>“You want a bowl of fruit for breakfast?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scowled at her. “Not <em>just<em> fruit. Fucking obviously.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Again…how was I supposed to know that? You need to use your words, sweetheart.”<br/>
</p><p>That body part that craved Agatha’s touch pulsed involuntarily at Agatha’s words. It was the way she’d said it, as if they were in an entirely different situation in which Rio was naked and Agatha was inside of her, forcing her to communicate whilst she pushed her to her breaking point.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked, clearing away the thought. She twisted her head back into the sheets to hide whatever facial expression she couldn’t explain. Rookie mistake, they smelt like Agatha: like power.<br/>
</p><p>Sex.<br/>
</p><p>Seduction.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio scrambled off the bed.<br/>
</p><p>“You, okay?” Agatha asked, more amused than concerned.<br/>
</p><p>“Peachy,” Rio replied, irritation in her voice. She knew Agatha knew exactly what she was doing. “I want fruit. We’re going to the farmers market.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio had stopped being surprised by the bratty attitude that came out whenever Agatha pissed her off. It used to shock her because it had only appeared since Agatha. She thought maybe she’d internalised the labels the other woman had forced upon her, or maybe her fake wife just had the ability to bring out the worst in people. Either way, she didn’t care. It was Agatha and Agatha alone who would have to deal with it.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled slowly and Rio knew exactly the words that wanted to leave her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Rio beat her to it. “Call me a princess and I <em>will<em> choke you.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Promise?” Agatha replied, a challenging smile on her lips.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>This fucking woman.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Don’t you think it’s a little ironic that you call me that when an article I read labelled <em>you<em> as, ‘The princess of the Upper East Side?’”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I wanted to test it out for myself. It’s got a ring to it don’t you think?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled a face at her. “Meet me by the front door in twenty.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, that stupid, teasing smirk smeared across her face. “Yes, ma’am.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Although Rio was the one who wanted fresh fruit, Agatha had taken over their shopping trip to the farmers market. She’d spend five minutes at least on each section of fruit until she picked up the most adequate bunch. Sure, Rio was fussy about the condition of her fruit, but not <em>this<em> fussy. She thought it must be a rich people thing.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>For the past hour, Rio had been Agatha’s mule lugging around any bag her wife would slip onto her shoulders. Rio knew if this had been anyone else, she wouldn’t have done it. In fact, she would’ve left forty minutes ago.<br/>
</p><p>“And where are these cherries from?”<br/>
</p><p>The man behind the cherry stall stared at her with a bored expression, as if to say he didn’t get paid enough to care about questions like this.<br/>
</p><p>When he didn’t reply, Agatha threw her hands up. “Well? Are you going to answer me or just stare at me like a fish out of water?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t bother suppressing her laugh.<br/>
</p><p>The man glared at her and Rio’s face hardened.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you going to answer her or not? Or should I start barking? Is that your preferred method of communication?”<br/>
</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to laugh.<br/>
</p><p>The stall man shot daggers at the both of them before he started explaining where his cherries were from. When he concluded, Agatha clapped her hands with the intention to mock.<br/>
</p><p>“Now was that so hard?”<br/>
</p><p>He ignored her. “So how much did you want?”<br/>
</p><p>“Oooh,” Agatha replied, her head tilting back and forth. “I just don’t know if your customer service is up to scratch. I think we’re going to try the stall over there.” She pointed at the woman selling cherries opposite them.<br/>
</p><p>The man seethed. “You fucking bi-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stepped in without missing a beat. “I dare you to finish that sentence.” She shifted their shopping bags out of the way to flash her gun.<br/>
</p><p>The stall owner swallowed. “Have a nice day ladies.”<br/>
</p><p>“We hope you have the worst imaginable,” Agatha winked before the pair turned on their heels towards the stall opposite.<br/>
</p><p>“Who brings their gun to the farmers market?” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“For situations like that one,” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Sure, as if you would murder a civilian in broad daylight for talking to me funny.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s smile only widened. “For you a-”<br/>
</p><p>She got interrupted when a voice Rio didn’t recognise spoke, “Well if it isn’t the whore of St Ives.”<br/>
</p><p>The pair turned. The woman before them wore black sunglasses, a long pink silk dress with a white blazer hanging off her shoulders. She had brown skin, and her hair was shaved, and Rio knew her from somewhere although she couldn’t remember where.<br/>
</p><p>“Terrorising the civilized citizens of Manhattan, are we?” The woman continued.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her before shooting back her own remark, “Can’t be many civilized citizens out today can there? I mean you’re here for one.”<br/>
</p><p>The two women stared at each other and Rio felt like she was witnessing a bullfight. Who was this woman and why did Agatha know everyone on this island?<br/>
</p><p>The tension only grew until Agatha’s lips started to twitch until she was full-blown smiling.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Huh?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The whiplash made Rio’s head hurt.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s been far too long, Kale,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>And then it clicked. Jennifer Kale had been a name under the picture of Agatha leaving that nightclub when Rio had googled her all those weeks ago.<br/>
</p><p>“I know,” Jennifer agreed. “How have you been?”<br/>
</p><p>“Busy.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah? How’s Nicky? How’s work?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nicky’s complaining because he can’t see me because of work and I’m complaining about work because I can’t see Nicky.”<br/>
</p><p>Jennifer laughed. “Are you still with that witch Wanda?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You told me you liked Wanda?”<br/>
</p><p>“You know I have to say that shit. I’ve known you since our nannies would take us on walks in our strollers around Central Park.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “No, I’m not with Wanda.”<br/>
</p><p>Jennifer’s eyes shifted to Rio and then back to Agatha, prompting her to introduce the mysterious woman standing next to her.<br/>
</p><p>“This is my wife, Rio,” Agatha said casually.<br/>
</p><p>Jennifer gaped at her. “<em>You<em> have a wife? You, you as in the same person who has slept with our entire school and half its faculty members?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha grimaced. “I think you’re being a tad hyperbolic.”<br/>
</p><p>Jennifer continued as if she hadn’t heard. “The same person who swore up and down she would never get married?”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, I was thirteen when I said that. Why you remember that anyway is a little concerning, and why is it so shocking? Samuel acted the same way when I saw him.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve seen Sammy? How is he? Wait, we’re getting sidetracked…what?!” Jennifer’s eyes shifted to Rio again. “How much is she paying you to pretend to be her wife?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled sheepishly. “She isn’t paying me anything.”<br/>
</p><p>Jennifer’s eyes narrowed. “Okay and how much extra did she pay you to say that?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed and Agatha rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Enough, Jen. What about you? What have you been up to?”<br/>
</p><p>Jennifer or Jen relaxed then, more than happy to start talking about herself. “Well, to absolutely nobody's surprise I have gotten-”<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, babe,” a woman interrupted. “That guy at that cherry stall is a dick so I’m going to go to that one,” she pointed at the stall Rio and Agatha were on their way to.<br/>
</p><p>Rio froze.<br/>
</p><p>“Alice?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened. “Ri?” She basically jumped on her. “What the fuck? What are you doing here? How are you?” Alice tried to hug her around the hundreds of bags she was carrying.<br/>
</p><p>Alice Wu-Gulliver, Rio’s best friend until their sophomore year when Alice left abruptly after her mother, international superstar Lorna Wu died suddenly in a hotel fire. Alice had been Rio’s only friend; she technically still was. They’d speak every so often after the year she left until neither of them reached out anymore and their connection had dwindled to nothing.<br/>
</p><p>Rio thought about her often but didn’t miss her. Rio didn’t miss anyone.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m good, how are you?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m good too. It’s so nice to see you,” Alice smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“And how do you two know each other?” Jen asked, waving her finger between the pair.<br/>
</p><p>“We used to go to school together,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>“So this is just one big reunion?” Jen said. “Remember when I was telling you about my friend Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>“The slut?”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s the one,” Jen replied with a toothy smile.<br/>
</p><p>“You bitch,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, shit! Sorry,” Alice apologised. “I didn’t realise…” She whacked Jen on the arm, and she cackled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha waved her off. “Don’t apologise, my reputation precedes me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted, something uncomfortable was fighting its way to the surface. If Agatha was as promiscuous as her friend was making her out to be, why hadn’t she made a move on her? A proper move, not a lingering touch or a flirtatious comment. A bold move. An Agatha move.<br/>
</p><p>She shoved the thought away.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait so how do you two know each other?” Alice asked as her eyes darted between Rio and Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh…erm…Agatha’s my wife,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>Alice gaped at her and Rio wanted to crawl into a hole.<br/>
</p><p>“You…you married the whore of St Ives?” Alice blinked as if she hadn’t meant to say her sentence aloud. “I mean…I mean…your type hasn’t changed since high school then?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smirked and Rio shot Alice a look. She mouthed a, ‘Sorry,’ before Jen spoke, her eyes on her gold Rolex:<br/>
</p><p>“Al and I have to go…but we should do dinner.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes!” Alice agreed. “When are you both free?”<br/>
</p><p>“We could do this evening,” Agatha replied, she looked at Rio to confirm.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, this evening works.”<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, perfect! See you then,” Jen said, turning to leave.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>The other women stopped.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes…”<br/>
</p><p>“How do you two know each other?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen smiled. “Alice is my wife.”</p>

<p>Agatha had half a mind to cancel dinner with Jen and Alice and reschedule when the food she was attempting to make wasn’t trying to ruin her plans. 
</p><p>She was only making salmon with asparagus and dauphinois potatoes. But Rio had already burnt the first two salmons, the double cream for the potatoes had been knocked on the floor and she didn’t have enough cheese. She’d convinced herself there was more than enough in the fridge and therefore hadn’t bought anymore at the farmers market. 
</p><p>As for the asparagus…actually…there was nothing wrong with the asparagus. But what good would that do her? She couldn’t serve up a plate of fucking vegetables.<br/>
</p><p>“Relax,” Rio said from her perch atop the island. She was very much in the way.<br/>
</p><p>After burning their fish Agatha had sent her off to prepare the table. Now she was finished she’d made it her sole purpose to annoy Agatha as her frustration grew.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed. “Why would I relax when dinners fucking ruined and Jen and Alice are going to be here in thirty minutes?”<br/>
</p><p>“Because everything’s fine,” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to strangle her.<br/>
</p><p>“I know you’re not slow, so why are you acting like it?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio gasped, feigning offence. “Ouch! I didn’t realise you were <em>this<em> pissed off. I wouldn’t have come back into the kitchen otherwise.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What?” Agatha replied half listening as she tried to wrestle a wooden spoon free from where Rio was sitting on it. The other woman made no attempt to move to let her get it.<br/>
</p><p>“When you get particularly moody you-”<br/>
</p><p>A rare (for Rio) squeal left her mouth as Agatha picked her up by the waist and lifted her off the island. Once Rio was standing on her two legs, Agatha retrieved her wooden spoon.<br/>
</p><p>She turned to the stove and started stirring what was left of the double cream until she realised the voice that followed her everywhere had suddenly gone quiet. Agatha spun round to face her, and Rio was just…blinking at her?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Why is she…ohhh. I touched her. Whoops.<br/>
</em></p><p>“When I’m particularly moody I…” Agatha prompted, a smirk spread shamelessly across her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“You…um…you…”<br/>
</p><p>“Do you need a minute?” Agatha’s smirk never wavered, even after she turned back to the stove.<br/>
</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, ignoring Agatha’s comment. “You insult me without actually insulting me. When you get really pissed off.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t do that,” Agatha countered.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah? Remember the time-”<br/>
</p><p>The doorbell sounding cut Rio off.<br/>
</p><p>“Shit!” Agatha checked the oven for the time. “They’re early.”<br/>
</p><p>“Are they?” Rio asked, a teasing smile on her lips as she sauntered out of the room.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face. <em>What is wrong with Rio today?<br/>
</em></p><p>She turned her attention back to the stove, heard Rio having a muffled conversation in the hallway, the front door shutting, and Rio’s reapproaching footsteps.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman walked in with three large white takeaway bags.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her. “You ordered food?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled as she breezed past her, setting the bags down on the kitchen island. She put on a low voice that sounded like Buzz Lightyear as she said, “I’m an FBI agent. I’m always prepared.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow and Rio deadpanned.<br/>
</p><p>“When I burnt the first fish, I already knew this meal was gonna end up a disaster, so I ordered food.”<br/>
</p><p>“And you didn’t think to tell me?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Why would I do that? I like when you get all grumpy.” She smiled, “It’s very entertaining.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scowled at her.<br/>
</p><p>“See.”<br/>
</p><p>She started unpacking the bags, laying out the food on the island. Agatha turned off the stove, tipped the double cream into the sink and began loading the dishwasher. 
</p><p>Once she was finished, she put away the unused food into their rightful places. When she looked back at Rio, she was plating up the food she’d ordered in serving bowls and plates. They were having Mexican. There was an array of dishes: tacos, nachos and guacamole, chilli con carne, you name it.<br/>
</p><p>It was only then Agatha realised how hungry she was. The food smelt <em>so<em> good. Much better than the fish Rio burnt that stank up the whole kitchen. 
</em></em></p><p>She watched Rio as she worked, watched the shift of her wine-red silk top that tied into a bow at the back and exposed her slender shoulders as she reached across the table, watched the way she moved around the island in her deep grey trousers that hugged her ass perfectly and she had to keep pulling up before she accidentally slipped on the excess material. They were clearly meant to be worn with heels. The flared bottoms kept running under her bare feet.<br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
Oh, how Agatha loved watching Rio do stuff. It could literally be anything, and she’d watch with all the concentration of a person in deep meditation.<br/>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Her stomach growling snapped her out of it.<br/>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<em>Rio laughed. “When was the last time you ate?”<br/>
</em></p><p>“I haven’t really eaten today; I got distracted with the whole Jen and Alice coming for dinner thing.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed again. “You haven’t even had any of the fruit we bought earlier?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll bring them out later. You have to have some of the cherries.”<br/>
</p><p>“They’re good?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back to exaggerate her point. “So good. You’re good at that, picking the best fruit.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched involuntarily. <em>You’re good at that.<em> Had anyone ever said that to her outside of a sexual context? No. She didn’t think so.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She knew she should come up with a cocky or teasing remark, knew she shouldn’t let Rio’s words spread a warm and protective layer over her heart. And then the last time Rio said something that caused the same effect flashed in her mind.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I guess time means nothing when I’m with you.<br/>
</em></p><p>Did Rio know what effect her words were having on Agatha? Did she know or were they just offhanded remarks to her? Agatha wondered if she’d even noticed.<br/>
</p><p>The snarky or teasing remark didn’t come, all that did was:<br/>
</p><p>“I am?” Her voice wavered.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said through a laugh. “You-”<br/>
</p><p>She cut herself off, looking up at Agatha for the first time in minutes. Rio’s face scrunched like she wanted to understand, that she registered Agatha’s tone and wanted to know what prompted it instead of the usual cockiness.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stepped closer, her voice a gentle whisper. “Yeah. You’re great at it.” She nodded as if willing Agatha to understand. As if Rio understood that this was deeper than fruit.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha breathed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio brushed her cheek with the back of her fingers. “Anytime.”<br/>
</p><p>It was happening again. They were being sucked into one of those moments where it felt like it was just the two of them, as if there couldn’t be more to the world outside of Rio’s brown eyes. It physically pained Agatha how desperate she was to kiss her, but she couldn't bring herself to do it.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ruined most things, her relationship with Rio wouldn’t be one of them.<br/>
</p><p>Their first kiss would be well thought out and approached carefully on Agatha’s part. The last time she had tried to kiss Rio it hadn’t ended well, the other woman had quite literally run away. She couldn’t handle Rio rejecting her again, so she had to be patient, read the situation right. She didn’t want to say it had to be perfect…but yeah…it had to be perfect.<br/>
</p><p>The doorbell rang snapping the pair out of their little world and back to the real one with real other people.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll get it,” Agatha whispered, forcing herself to walk away from her wife.<br/>
</p><p>She needed a fucking medal. Nobody was stronger than her at this point.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Dinner had gone well. Drinks were flowing, food had been demolished and Rio surprised herself when she realised, she was really enjoying her company. Her fake wife, her fake wife’s best friend and her ex-best friend. She felt herself wanting to get used to this, wanted to make this a custom. She hadn’t recalled a time when she actively wanted to be around a group of people. Where she’d felt known.<br/>
</p><p>Apart from when she was on the job, Rio felt invisible. She wasn’t sure if it was because it was easier to protect herself that way or because she simply didn’t have anyone.<br/>
</p><p>The party had moved to the living room, each woman with a full wine glass in hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait…so you two did what?” Alice said, wiping tears from her eyes from how hard she’d been laughing.<br/>
</p><p>“We locked our principal in a closet during senior prank.”<br/>
</p><p>“How did you manage that?” Alice asked, she wiped at her eyes again.<br/>
</p><p>“We said Agatha was stuck in the closet in the drama department,” Jen said.<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause before the room erupted into more laughter due to the irony.<br/>
</p><p>“Have you ever been in the closet?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head, laughter spilling uncontrollably out of her mouth. Rio loved when Agatha laughed like this, it was like she could <em>see<em> her. She was unguarded, wasn’t hiding behind a thick layer of whatever emotion she chose to shield herself with.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“When you get outed at eleven and it's splashed on the front page of every magazine the next day there’s no closet to climb into.”<br/>
</p><p>The laughter in the room cut off instantly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes shifted to her wife above her on the couch from the floor. Agatha’s locked with hers and she knew her eyes were filled with unapologetic sympathy.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs,” Jen started. “I am so sorry, I completely forgot about that.”<br/>
</p><p>“Me too,” Agatha chucked, the sound getting lost as she gulped down her wine.<br/>
</p><p>Every woman in the room was staring at her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed. “I didn’t mean to turn this into a doom fest. It’s fine, I’m fine, let’s just-”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s not,” Rio cut in. “Never is, never was.”<br/>
</p><p>That same look Agatha had given her when she’d told her she was good at picking fruit earlier was on her face again. That look that looked like she couldn’t believe the words coming out of Rio’s mouth, the look of someone who had never heard those words before.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha let her lips twist into a small smile. She reached for Rio’s hand and held it, placing it in her lap.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, are you a witch or something?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Alice said through a laugh, the tension in the room evaporating.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m being serious. She must have some magical powers because I have never seen Agatha Harkness get so fucking sappy or actively go out of her way to touch another human being <em>gently<em> unless it’s Nicky.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio looked up again to see Agatha scowling at her friend.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Jen shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, but she didn’t release Rio’s hand like she thought she would. Instead, she squeezed harder.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, so how did you two meet?” Agatha said, changing the subject as she waved her wine glass in between the women on the other couch.<br/>
</p><p>“We met at work,” Alice said casually.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, cool,” Rio said. She tilted her head up to Agatha and saw the other woman with a slight furrow in her brow and sneaking suspicion in her eyes. Eventually, her facial expression smoothed out and Rio wanted to know what dots she was connecting.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s nice.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Jen said. “What about you two?”<br/>
</p><p>“Same,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Damn,” Jen shook her head. “We’re all married to our jobs then, huh?”<br/>
</p><p>They all laughed. Rio more so because she <em>was<em> married to her job, although it felt like it less and less every day.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Aliceee,” Agatha dragged out.<br/>
</p><p>“Yussss,” Alice echoed her delivery.<br/>
</p><p>“Share with the class a story about Rio in high school.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice perked up at this. “It’d be an honour.”<br/>
</p><p>“Do it and I’ll murder you,” Rio glared at her.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll take my chances. Plus, Jen would clock you before you had the chance,” Alice smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Not if Agatha got there first.” Rio heard Agatha scoff behind her.<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna go, Harkness?” Jen said, setting down her glass, seemingly to stand.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, Kale. But I don’t want any tears, I know how much of a sore loser you are,” Agatha said, releasing Rio’s hand to get up.<br/>
</p><p>“Sit down.”<br/>
</p><p>“Sit your ass down,” Rio said at the same time Alice did.<br/>
</p><p>The two women were staring at each other like they were in a bullfight again before they begrudgingly lowered themselves to the couch. Rio mirrored the slight shock on Alice’s face when their wives actually listened.<br/>
</p><p>Alice cleared her throat. “Anyways, embarrassing Rio stories.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hey! She said stories from high school not embarrassing ones.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice waved her off. “Same thing.” She stroked her chin in thought for a moment before she said, “Oh! I know! There was this one time in gardening club when-”<br/>
</p><p>“You two were in gardening club?” Jen cut in.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Alice replied, warning in her tone. “What’s the issue?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing… it's just…isn’t that really nerd-”<br/>
</p><p>“Stop digging yourself a grave, Kale,” Agatha tutted.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not…but isn’t it?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head like a disappointed mother. “Shush now, Jennifer. You are only making it worse.”<br/>
</p><p>“But-”<br/>
</p><p>She saw the daggers in Alice’s eyes and promptly shut up.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, so this kid,” Alice continued. “What was his name, Ri?”<br/>
</p><p>“Josh Davidson.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice shuddered at the name. “Yeah, him. He stomped all over our azaleas, kicking, pulling, ripping them out of the ground. When he was done it looked like a crime scene.” She took another sip of wine before going on. “And I just stood there watching, which now that I look back at it was kinda pathetic. Anyways, Rio over here witnessed the end of Josh’s tantrum, so the damage had already been done.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio started to laugh as she knew what was coming next.<br/>
</p><p>“But she didn’t let him get away with it. I swear I’d never seen her move that fast, she stormed over to him and kneed him in the dick, once, twice, three times!”<br/>
</p><p>Everyone was laughing now.<br/>
</p><p>“He cried like a baby, falling to his knees in the azaleas he’d just slaughtered.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked up to her fake wife on the couch, her own chest moving up and down with laughter.<br/>
</p><p>“He had to go to the nurse's office and couldn’t get it up without being in excruciating pain for a month…so…obviously me and Alice as well as every girl in gardening club and then the rest of our year when they found out had their fun…<em>enticing<em> him,” Rio finished off the story.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Oh, you’re <em>evil<em>,” Agatha said, the biggest smile on her face. “That’s my girl.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio blushed like an idiot.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Rio were back in the kitchen. Rio was preparing a fruit platter and Agatha was looking for another bottle of wine. She’d stopped counting how many the four had gone through.<br/>
</p><p>“You, okay?” Rio asked her wife.<br/>
</p><p>An easy smile spread across Agatha’s lips. “Yes. You?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm. I think I should’ve drank less. What if I accidentally reveal we’re in fake marriage?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha feigned offence, gasping and holding her hand to her heart. “I knew you were only with me for the money!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed as Agatha smiled at her.<br/>
</p><p>She wished she could stop harping on about her wife’s appearance. There was so much more to Agatha than just her looks, but god, wasn’t she just divine? If your wife looked like Agatha Harkness, you wouldn’t shut up about it either.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was wearing a black tailored short dress with a round neckline that cinched in her waist, and deep red lipstick. Rio was a sucker for Agatha in red lipstick.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re going to get drool on the fruit.”<br/>
</p><p>That snapped Rio back to the present. She blinked as she realised, she’d be staring into Agatha’s eyes the whole time.<br/>
</p><p>“Was not,” Rio shot back like a child caught red-handed.<br/>
</p><p>“At least you thought to lie about it, makes you seem less desperate that way,” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to smack her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha brushed her hand against the small of Rio’s back as she passed to get to the drawer with the corkscrew and Rio’s entire body buzzed.<br/>
</p><p>And then so did her phone on the kitchen island in front of her, and Agatha’s in her dress pocket.<br/>
</p><p>That meant one thing.<br/>
</p><p>“We got a mission,” Agatha said, reading the phone in her hand.<br/>
</p><p>Now Rio <em>really<em> wished she had drank less.</em></em></p><p><br/>

<em>Hihi, Mrs &amp; Mrs Smith.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Emergency mission.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>The telecommunication awards (TTAs) might be a target for terrorist group The Sisters of Liberty, more specifically tonight’s host Imogen Morgan and her family.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>You MUST stop the attack. If you do not this mission will be considered a failure. It is imperative no one at the TTAs is harmed. They are vital assets to the FBI.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>What to wear will be delivered to your house at a moment's notice, the location is already in your GPS.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>They’d had to make up an excuse for Jen and Alice to leave and luckily they seemed to take it well. All that was said was that they needed to do this again sometime, and Agatha and Rio had wanted nothing more.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was waiting by the front door after chugging down what felt like a gallon of water to sober her up in the clothes she’d be instructed to wear. A form-fitted black suit with no blouse underneath so you could see the deep purple lace bra she was wearing and black kitten heels. She wasn’t sure if she should keep the red lipstick on but decided to do so anyway. They were going to an award show after all.<br/>
</p><p>The elevator pinged and Rio stepped out. She didn’t bother holding in her laugh.<br/>
</p><p>The agency had made them match. They looked identical down to the red lipstick. The only difference was that Rio wore a forest green lace bra to Agatha’s purple.<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” Rio mumbled although she was smiling.<br/>
</p><p>“I think we look hot,” Agatha said. “I would want to fuck us if I saw us coming.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio parked their car a block away from the event location. Upon their arrival, Hihi sent another message instructing them to say their names to the security detail at the door and to wait for further instructions once inside. They were to act like the married couple they’d been assigned to be.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha took Rio’s hand in hers as they approached the event. She wasn’t kidding about what she said earlier. They looked hot, like one of those couples you see modelling for high-end fashion brands. She thought maybe it was cringe of her to think so, but she didn’t care. If your wife was as hot as Rio Vidal, you would think shit like this too.<br/>
</p><p>The event was being hosted in an off-Broadway theatre that needed refurbishing three decades ago. The place reeked of the 90s, paint was falling off the walls, the chairs in the entrance were covered in a thick layer of dust. Wasn’t this supposed to be a prestigious award show? Why had they chosen here of all places?<br/>
</p><p>“Names?” The security guard said as she approached.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha Smith.”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio Smith.”<br/>
</p><p>The guard laughed before she said something Agatha didn’t catch.<br/>
</p><p>“Spread your legs,” the security guard told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, and Rio shot the woman a look that would’ve crushed lesser mortals souls and withered their bodies to ashes.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, sorry. I mean I need to pat you down for weapons,” she laughed, realising the error in her choice of words.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio’s eyes narrowed further as the guard approached Agatha. She had to force herself not to laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s jealousy over the smallest comment was unexpected, she didn’t seem like the jealous type. Until she had started to open up, she had always been awkward and somewhat shy. None of those traits screamed possessive bitch. She might give Agatha a run for her money.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha slid her gun from its holster and discreetly passed it to Rio underneath her suit jacket. One thing she hated about The Smith’s Programme was that they couldn’t have badges or have license to carry their guns around wherever they pleased. They had to pose as normal law-abiding citizens. It was a pain in Agatha’s ass.<br/>
</p><p>She wouldn’t be lying if she said this security guard was being…thorough. She was taking her sweet time with the pat down, often repeating the action on a limb she’d done more than once. Agatha could feel Rio twitching next to her. She wouldn’t be surprised if Rio’s finger <em>accidentally<em> slipped and one of the two guns she was holding went off.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I think you’re done,” her wife all but growled at the security guard.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman blinked as if she hadn’t realised what she was doing.<br/>
</p><p>She cleared her throat. “Erm…yes. Your turn,” she said to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Rio gave her a bitter smile before storming over to her, stepping in front of Agatha to block the woman’s access to her just in case she felt the need to make up an excuse to touch her again.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shoved the guns into Agatha’s hands and waited for her pat down.<br/>
</p><p>It was over in seconds, the other woman probably scared Rio would bite her head off or something.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, so you <em>can<em> move quicker than snail's pace. Never would’ve guessed by all that attention you were giving my wife.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha turned away to hide her smile. Rio sounded just like her.<br/>
</p><p>“I…I…” the security guard stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>“I think you owe her an apology,” Rio said, nodding her head towards Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” she said without looking up. She mumbled another apology to Rio before scurrying away.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched after her, daggers in her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>It was Agatha slipping her gun back in her gun holster that snapped her attention away. She let her hand rest on Rio’s waist as the other woman’s eyes locked on her.<br/>
</p><p>“So, you’re the jealous type?” Agatha raised an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t bother denying it, she just shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“And just when I thought you couldn’t get any hotter,” Agatha smirked, letting her hand slide across Rio’s stomach as she walked away from her.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio found herself in a dim corridor on the second floor of the theatre.<br/>
</p><p>Hihi had sent them further instructions. They were to split up. Agatha was to stay in the audience and monitor any suspicious movement from there, and Rio was to cover the second floor and its balconies.<br/>
</p><p>Her gun was trained in front of her as she scanned the corridor. So far everything appeared normal. Rio hated it. Her anxiety was at an all-time high. In situations like this when everything appears ‘normal’ they most definitely are not. She just wished there was a tell, something that stuck out, something that seemed out of the blue.<br/>
</p><p>She drew closer to a pair of double doors, the sounds of muffled laughter behind it. She put her gun away as she approached the door. A woman in an all-black suit holding a gun would raise some suspicions among audience members.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pushed on the double doors before hands grabbed her. One covered her mouth the other wrapped around her body forcing her backwards. The suddenness of the action had caught her off guard, and it was only when she was being dragged through another set of doors and into a darker corridor did her instincts kick in.<br/>
</p><p>She elbowed her attacker which earned a grunt from behind. Rio spun on them, hand flying to her gun to aim and potentially shoot when she froze just like she had the first time she saw the woman.<br/>
</p><p>“Alice?!” Rio whisper yelled.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Alice replied, her hands still up because Rio hadn’t lowered her gun.<br/>
</p><p>“What the hell! I could’ve shot you!” She dropped her gun. “What are you…”<br/>
</p><p>It was then Rio took in her appearance. She was dressed the exact same as her except her lace bra was orange instead of Rio’s green.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re in the programme.” Rio wasn’t asking, she already knew the answer.<br/>
</p><p>Alice nodded. “As are you.”<br/>
</p><p>“You wanted to be a cop last time I checked.”<br/>
</p><p>“Isn’t a special agent just a glorified version of that?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows as if to say, ‘True.’<br/>
</p><p>“What about you? Didn’t you want to be a biologist?”<br/>
</p><p>“Taxonomist,” Rio corrected.<br/>
</p><p>Alice scoffed. “Yeah, so how’d you end up in the FBI?”<br/>
</p><p>“Life.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice tilted her head as if to say, ‘Fair enough.’<br/>
</p><p>Footsteps sounding in the corridor next to them snapped the two women back to the mission at hand.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re not done talking about this,” Alice whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled her gun out and Alice followed suit. She cracked open the door slightly and there in the corridor were twenty or so people all in black suits. Rio locked eyes with Alice, her face wearing a perplexed expression. Were they FBI agents or something else?<br/>
</p><p>They waited, watching to see how the suited people acted to determine who they were. They didn’t seem to be doing much. They weren’t even talking to one another, just standing around twiddling their thumbs. They didn’t seem alert enough to be agents, but they weren’t moving with any purpose to be potential terrorists.<br/>
</p><p>So…who were they?<br/>
</p><p>Alice and Rio stayed hidden behind their door for a good five minutes before the suited people actually did something. They started disappearing into the different doors leading into the theatre. Once the last person had entered, the two women finally left their spot and ran to open the double doors.<br/>
</p><p>They were locked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio yanked as hard as she could. The door didn’t budge. They tried every door along the corridor, the verdict was the same. The doors had been bolted shut.<br/>
</p><p>“Shit,” Rio whispered as she pressed her com. “I know you can’t reply but I’m just letting you know they’ve locked the doors on the second floor. Gonna try the ground floor now,” she told Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“How many agents do you think are here?” Alice said.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know. It’s a bit fucking stupid they didn’t tell us about other agents being here.”<br/>
</p><p>“I guess we’re technically not supposed to know about anyone else in the programme,” Alice said, nodding to the door they’d just come from.<br/>
</p><p>“But then how do we know who the enemy is and who’s not?” Rio replied as she opened the door and slipped through.<br/>
</p><p>She briefly wondered if she should trust Alice. She had no proof that she was actually <em>in<em> the programme. All she had was Alice’s word. She could be lying. She could be part of The Daughters of Liberty.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>On this rare occasion, Rio chose to be naïve. Alice had been her best friend once, joining a terrorist group seemed extremely out of character even if she couldn’t technically claim to know the woman anymore after over a decade of no contact.<br/>
</p><p>They ran down the corridor, pushed open the door at the end of it, and flew down the stairs to the ground floor.<br/>
</p><p>Alice and Rio froze as they opened the doors to the reception.<br/>
</p><p>Guns. Multiple. Were trained on them.<br/>
</p><p>“Hands up!” A man in a black suit boomed.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s okay we’re-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nudged her to keep quiet. They had to be smart; she didn’t know if they were agents or not.<br/>
</p><p>The two women complied, putting their hands up in surrender.<br/>
</p><p>“Grab their weapons,” the man said.<br/>
</p><p>Two black-suited figures came towards them and Rio had to fight the urge to react. Usually, she’d try to figure out an escape plan, but she was well and truly trapped, and she had to worry about Alice. It wasn’t like if she were with Agatha. The other woman would probably read what she was about to do before she did it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Was she okay? Was she being held at gunpoint too? She hadn’t heard from her wife since they parted ways.<br/>
</p><p>A sick feeling began to twist Rio’s stomach.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>BANG!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>BANG!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>BANG!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Three gunshots rang out from within the theatre. Everyone in the reception froze as screams sounded. Next, the locked doors started moving as people tried to get out. More gunshots sounded and the black-suited people surrounding Rio and Alice turned their guns to the double doors.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Shit.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>This was going to turn into a bloodbath.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>BANG!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio whipped to the side to see a body fall to the ground.<br/>
</p><p>A burst of FBI agents wearing bulletproof vests with ‘FBI’ in big bold yellow stormed the building. The suited people turned; fire arms raised.<br/>
</p><p>“FBI, put your weapons down and keep your arms up,” a woman yelled. “We outnumber you. It is in your best interest to comply unless you want this to get messy.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio recognised that voice.<br/>
</p><p>She locked eyes with the owner of said voice and her stomach twisted. It was her former boss, Lila Calderu.<br/>
</p><p>She snapped her eyes away to catch the last of the suited people to put their weapons down. The FBI agents moved in, barking orders and arresting the criminals.<br/>
</p><p>Two agents started approaching Alice and Rio before Lila intervened.<br/>
</p><p>“They're with us,” she said.<br/>
</p><p>The agents nodded and retreated.<br/>
</p><p>“Mrs and Mrs Smith,” Lila greeted.<br/>
</p><p>“Long time no see, Agent C,” Alice replied.<br/>
</p><p>The nickname. That came with familiarity. How had Rio never come across Alice in her entire time working for the FBI?<br/>
</p><p>“Hello, Alice,” Lila smiled. “Hello, Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her. She was the reason she had been dropped from the main field; she was the reason she’d had to start living under an alias permanently, she was the reason…<br/>
</p><p>She met her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“Hello, Agent Calderu.”<br/>
</p><p>The sound of splitting wood sounded and the locked doors to the theatre smacked open. The reception was now rid of criminals and the frightened audience could leave the theatre without any obstacles.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched the onslaught of people, all terrified, some covered in blood, some crying.<br/>
</p><p>“I must deal with this,” Lila said, turning to leave with her fingers pressed to her com. She paused before she added, “Find your wives.”<br/>
</p><p>The words activated something in Rio. It was like she was a magnet with the one and only urge to find its opposite.<br/>
</p><p>She looked to Alice who nodded for her to go ahead.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded back before she pushed her way through the crowd towards the theatre. She felt like she was drowning, like she was swimming against the tide trying to drag her under. She didn’t care. She fought harder, pushing and elbowing until she could climb onto a chair and seek out her wife.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t see her.<br/>
</p><p>A slither of fear started to inch its way up Rio’s body. Medics were crouching around limp bodies; FBI agents were carrying out arrests alongside other agents in The Smith’s Programme in their black suits.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes landed on the stage for the first time. There was a huge blood stain, and a black body bag was being placed next to a dead body. She couldn’t tell who it was.<br/>
</p><p>“You looking for someone?”<br/>
</p><p>That voice. Rio loved that voice.<br/>
</p><p>She looked down to see Agatha staring up at her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t bother hiding her smile as she dropped down from the chair and into her wife’s arms. Agatha squeezed her tightly.<br/>
</p><p>She knew this wasn’t professional, that they should be acting like agents right now. But as always when it came to Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Fuck professionalism.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio didn’t spend over an hour in the shower like she tended to do after every mission. This might’ve been the quickest shower she’d ever had in her thirty-two years of life. As always, she was breaking every rule she’d ever lived by for Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman had suggested they debrief in the living room and Rio had wanted nothing more. She couldn’t tell if it was all the adrenaline left over from the mission, or if New York was just humid tonight, but Rio couldn’t bring herself to put on proper pyjamas. Instead, she opted for her underwear; a black bra and lace-trimmed hipster pants. She threw on an overside white button-up blouse over the top.<br/>
</p><p>She felt like she should be lounging around somewhere in Italy.<br/>
</p><p>She wished she was in Italy.<br/>
</p><p>Rio surprised herself when she realised, she didn’t feel weird about what she was wearing. She felt she and Agatha were at a comfortable enough place for her to do this.<br/>
</p><p>When she stepped out of their elevator and into the living room, Agatha was already there. It appeared Rio wasn’t the only one who felt hot. Agatha had her long hair tied up in a ponytail, the hairs that weren’t quite long enough falling around her face to frame it. She too was in a bra with white cotton boxer shorts on.<br/>
</p><p>As well as glasses.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s mouth dried out. “You…wear glasses?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked up from her phone. She smiled. “You like them?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Yes! Fuck yes!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She shrugged. “They suit you I guess.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sat down on the opposite side of the couch. She had to blink a few times for her eyes to adjust to the dimmer lighting of the living room. The big light was off, the room instead lit by various hues of orange and red from smaller lamps dotted around the space. She took in the plants she had added, the large Kenita Palm, the Snake Plant, the Peace Lily, the Devil’s Ivy.<br/>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t noticed up until now, but their house was really starting to feel like theirs. For Rio’s plants, Agatha had put up photos of Nicky, a rug she knew cost more than her old apartment, blankets that had a permanent home in the living room, and a fucking Dyson air purifier. Between that and her plants, Rio swore they had the cleanest air in Manhattan.<br/>
</p><p>Said air was also filled with her wife’s scent, and as always, Rio craved it. The urge to slide across the couch and invade Agatha’s space was undeniable, but she resisted, snuggling deeper into the leather to trap herself.<br/>
</p><p>She needed a fucking medal for the strength she was displaying.<br/>
</p><p>“So, what happened?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha replied immediately. There had been no warning, no announcement of The Sisters of Liberty’s presence. Imogen Morgan had been alive and well, making her audience laugh…and then she was dead. Shot in the head by a gunman somewhere in the vicinity. Agatha didn’t know what to do, people were shooting but they were all wearing black suits, she was wearing a black suit. She had no clue if they were FBI agents or terrorists. She chose not to shoot, killing another agent was a pile of paperwork she didn’t want to do.<br/>
</p><p>Rio told her she made the right decision. She relayed her side of the story before she told her about Alice, about seeing her former boss.<br/>
</p><p>“I fucking knew it!” Agatha shrieked triumphantly. “Jen said they’d met a work, Jen works for the FBI, Jen would never marry another agent she told me she’d rather drop dead,” she let out a breathless laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled at her wife’s smile. Who knew the simplest things in life could bring such joy?<br/>
</p><p>“I wonder if they made it out okay,” Rio said, pulling out her phone to text her former best friend now friend again.<br/>
</p><p>“I hope so,” Agatha replied. “And what about seeing your old boss? What was her name?”<br/>
</p><p>“Lila Calderu.”<br/>
</p><p>“Your former boss was Agent C? Oh, I love her! She…” Agatha trailed off. “I mean, what a bitch. How dare she remove you from main operations.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head playfully. “Nice save.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged as if to say it was nothing.<br/>
</p><p>“It was fine. I hated her for a really long time when I got dropped and when I first started the programme.”<br/>
</p><p>“And now?” Agatha prompted.<br/>
</p><p>“Now the programme’s not so bad.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah?” Agatha’s voice was low, silky. “How come?”<br/>
</p><p>“Decorating this house is what really did it for me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stuck her tongue in her cheek. “Yeah, okay.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s phone buzzed. She thought nothing of it, probably Alice shooting back her reply until Agatha’s phone buzzed too.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, not again,” Agatha grumbled. “Surely we can’t have two missions in one night.”<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t another mission.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Hihi,<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Three casualties, one of them Imogen Morgan.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Mission: FAILED.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Is it just me or is Hihi extremely passive-aggressive?” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded her agreement.<br/>
</p><p>The two women sat and stared at their phones. They’d never failed a mission before. There had been some close calls, but never an actual fail. What did that mean?<br/>
</p><p>Another message popped up a moment later.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>That is strike one out of three.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t let it get to three.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Yep, very passive-aggressive,” Agatha mumbled, setting her phone down.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t want to know what would happen if you got to strike three, actually, it didn’t matter. She was never going to find out. They wouldn’t be failing another mission again. So, this is where the most brilliant idea she’d had all evening popped into her head:<br/>
</p><p>“Wanna get fucked up?”<br/>
</p><p>The defeated look on Agatha’s face vanished immediately.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The room was spinning, three bottles of wine and the fruit platter Rio had made earlier were on the table and her wife was laughing at something funny she must’ve said but forgotten what it was.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stumbled towards the speaker.<br/>
</p><p>“Nosotras necesitamos musica Española,” Rio said. <em>We need Spanish music.<br/>
</em></p><p>“¿Qué vas a jugar?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio whirled around. “¿Tú hablas Español?” <em>You speak Spanish?<br/>
</em></p><p>“Un poco.” <em>A little.<br/>
</em></p><p>Truth was, as soon as Agatha had found out Rio spoke Spanish on their first mission she’d started to relearn it. Her longest Nanny had spoken it, and she learnt it to communicate with her. It felt like their own secret language, no one in the Harkness-O’Connor household spoke it. She’d often get scolded by her mother for not speaking English, but she didn’t care.<br/>
</p><p>She also took it during high school, it was one of her highest-scoring subjects, but Agatha couldn’t tell if that was because she was genuinely good at it or if it was because she sleeping with her Spanish teacher.<br/>
</p><p>“Why are you making me teach Nicky if <em>you<em> can speak Spanish?” Rio laughed. The sound came out slow and breathy like it does when someone is under the influence.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Why would I pass up an opportunity for him to learn from a fluent Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, an action that was taking her more effort than it would on a normal day. “I never told you that.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m an FBI agent, remember sweetheart?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed red immediately and she started shifting at her blouse.<br/>
</p><p>“Música!” She said, turning to the speaker.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>X by Nicky Jam &amp; J Balvin<em> started blasting through the speakers and Rio threw her head back immediately.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“I fucking love this song!”<br/>
</p><p>She started swaying her hips, her eyes closed as she absentmindedly tipped alcohol down her throat.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha watched her from the couch. The orange light emitting from the lamp behind her shone through the messy pieces of her that were sticking up from where Rio had been rubbing her head against the leather from laughing so hard.<br/>
</p><p>She looked otherworldly. Like she had been sent from the heavens.<br/>
</p><p>Rio brought the hand free of her wine glass into the air before she dropped it back down to run the length of her body, starting from her head to the curve of her neck, to her chest. Agatha had never been more jealous in her life; she wanted to do that.<br/>
</p><p>She resisted the urge, instead chugging down the wine in her glass and pouring herself another.<br/>
</p><p>When she looked at Rio again, her eyes were fluttering open.<br/>
</p><p>“No, get up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Huh?”<br/>
</p><p>“You heard me,” Rio giggled. “We’re dancing.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head in protest. She couldn’t dance with her fake wife half-naked. She’d do something stupid.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s cute you think you have a choice,” Rio said, setting her wine glass on the table to approach Agatha on the couch. “I know you like to dance, Harkness. I saw those photos of you leaving that club, saw you leaving multiple clubs actually.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m gonna have to cut off your access to the internet if you keep googling me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed, her hands finding Agatha’s and tugging her to her feet. She led her towards the open space in their living room.<br/>
</p><p>Before Agatha had a chance to collect her thoughts, Rio had slung her arms around her neck. She started swaying again as the next song, <em>Downtown by Anitta &amp; J Balvin<em> started playing.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s brown remained locked on Agatha’s blue, and she had to force herself to remember to breathe. Agatha had never been more nervous in her life. Had another woman ever made her feel like this? No. They hadn’t.<br/>
</p><p>“I know you have no problem coming up with excuses to touch me, so what are you waiting for?” Rio raised an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>“Who are you and what have you done with Rio Vidal?” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed, her head falling to the crook of Agatha’s neck. She felt Rio’s warm forehead against her skin and the soft poke of her nose before she lifted herself up again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wished she hadn’t.<br/>
</p><p>She finally moved her hands to Rio’s hips on top of her blouse. She wanted to apologise for how clammy her hands probably were. Agatha didn’t know if it was because of the alcohol or the temperature or because she was so fucking nervous why she was so sweaty.<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed, moving Agatha’s hands from on top of her shirt to her bare skin. The action caused one of the shoulders of her blouse to slip down revealing her uncovered right shoulder.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt pleasantly overstimulated. She didn’t know what to process first, the heat coming off of Rio’s body, the expanse of more skin, how bold Rio was being.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife started swaying her hips again, and Agatha’s hands followed the movement. Rio’s eyes flicked back up to hers. She smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“There you go. Now, let’s do something about this.”<br/>
</p><p>Before Agatha could ask what she meant, Rio was reaching towards the back of her head. She felt Rio’s hands in her hair, felt a slight tug as her ponytail fell and her hair dropped past her shoulders. Rio slid the now useless hair tie onto her wrist before she raked her hands through Agatha’s hair, arranging it however she liked.<br/>
</p><p>“Hermosa,” Rio whispered. <em>Beautiful.<br/>
</em></p><p>The song changed again. <em>Peligrosa by FloyyMenor.<br/>
</em></p><p>A slow smile spread across Rio’s lips as she began to recognise the song. When the beat dropped, she started nodding her head.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled at her like an idiot.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stepped back, grabbing her hand to spin her. Agatha squealed as she almost tripped before Rio caught her with a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re fine!”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah?” Agatha tossed her wife over her shoulder and began to spin.<br/>
</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to squeal.<br/>
</p><p>“I didn’t spin you this fast!” She scolded through a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha put her down.<br/>
</p><p>“If I throw up, I’m blaming you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, so just like last time then?”<br/>
</p><p>They hadn’t spoken about the night Rio got drunk with their mission target during the ski mission.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s mouth snapped shut. She stared at Agatha a moment before she said, “I’m sorry about that. I should’ve apologised sooner.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw back her head and laughed. “I was only joking but I accept your apology. I’m sorry for almost blowing your head off.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “I was just grasping at strings; I knew you wouldn’t have taken the shot if you knew you couldn’t do it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows. “You’re sure?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes!” Rio shoved her playfully in the shoulder before drawing her back into her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hands found Rio’s waist once more and Rio looped her arms around the back of her neck. They started swaying again before Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“You still need to try the cherries.”<br/>
</p><p>She breezed past Agatha towards the fruit platter on the table. Agatha tried not to acknowledge how her body shivered due to the lack of contact.<br/>
</p><p>Rio came towards her at the same time the song changed: <em>Gata only by FloyyMenor &amp; Cris Mj.<br/>
</em></p><p>She held her hand out expecting Rio to give it to her. The other woman shook her head and Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. Rio nodded her head and Agatha understood.<br/>
</p><p>She tilted her head up, felt Rio’s hand press flat against her throat to steady her as she lowered the cherry into her mouth. Agatha bit the bottom of it and a burst of sweet cherry juice covered her tongue.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes widened as she locked eyes with Rio again. “Holy shit, these are good!”<br/>
</p><p>“Told you,” Rio replied as she popped Agatha’s half-eaten cherry into her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t break eye contact as she sucked the cherry off the stem.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>This fucking woman.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She pulled the stem from her mouth and then took out the pit.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smirked before she said, “Look who’s drooling now.”<br/>
</p><p>It was only then Agatha felt the faint trail of cherry juice sliding down her chin. She wiped it away hastily as Rio returned to the table.<br/>
</p><p>They shared more fruit on the couch. Strawberries, grapes, more cherries. Never serving themselves, always taking the food from the other woman’s fingers.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt dizzy. It was the alcohol mixed with the insanely good fruit, the music, and her uncharacteristically (for Rio) bold wife.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Ay Vamos by J Balvin<em> was playing the next time Rio dragged Agatha to her feet.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>They were in the same position as always except this time, Agatha was guiding Rio’s hips as she swayed not following the other woman’s lead.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you always this stiff?” Rio said after a while.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Agatha blinked. She’d been in a trance, watching her wife’s hips sway back and forth.<br/>
</p><p>“You barely move your hips.”<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…?”<br/>
</p><p>“Here, let me.”<br/>
</p><p>Truth was, Agatha was not stiff, Rio was right, she loved dancing. But she’d been so caught up in everything that was Rio Vidal she hadn’t had time to pay attention to what her own body was doing.<br/>
</p><p>Rio dropped to a crouching position and Agatha’s breath hitched at the sight of her wife looking up at her through her eyelashes. Rio put her hands on her hips and waited for the chorus again before she started swaying her, moving her left hip first, then her right and repeat to the beat of the music.<br/>
</p><p>“There you go,” Rio praised.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hair kept falling past her shoulders and she kept having to swipe it behind her ear. She couldn’t miss a second of this, of the way Rio looked at her as she gripped her waist.<br/>
</p><p>Rio slid her fingers up further so more of her hand was pressed against Agatha’s bare skin.<br/>
</p><p>Was their A.C. working? It didn’t fucking feel like it. Agatha was sure beads of sweat were forming on her forehead. All she wanted to do was kiss her wife, god, do more than kiss her. Her body felt like it had been set ablaze. The mess of feelings between her legs twisted so tightly it almost hurt.<br/>
</p><p>The room began to spin the more Rio swayed her. She was not surviving this woman. Agatha was sure she was going to die from lack of air.<br/>
</p><p>She was okay with that.<br/>
</p><p>“You, okay?” Rio whispered.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No! I’m going to fucking explode if I don’t put my lips on yours.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha got out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stood slowly. She took in Agatha’s expression and before Agatha could think she was sliding her hand around Rio’s waist.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>DO NOT KISS HER! IT HAS TO BE PERFECT! YOU ARE DRUNK!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She heard Rio whisper something like, ‘Fuck it,’ before she felt her wife’s lips on hers.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha froze. She was sweating like a pig, she had her glasses on, she was fucking drunk. This was not perfect, nowhere near…<br/>
</p><p>And yet she hadn’t pulled away.<br/>
</p><p>She sighed, closing her eyes and sinking into the feeling of soft lips on hers.<br/>
</p><p>Rio tasted like the cherries they’d just eaten, and she smelt, Agatha let her shoulders drop, she smelt like Rio, like sandalwood, pine and vanilla.<br/>
</p><p>Rio parted her lips more, letting Agatha gain more access to her. She took it in stride, allowing her tongue to slide into her wife’s mouth. Rio let out a soft moan that was closer to a whimper and Agatha’s entire body trembled.<br/>
</p><p>It had now become one of her favourite sounds.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman pulled away and Agatha thought she might cry. Was that it? She was prepared to pray to whatever deity necessary to keep this going.<br/>
</p><p>A smirk painted Rio’s lips before she reached up and slowly freed Agatha from her glasses. She tossed them on the couch away from them.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve got enough money to buy new ones.”<br/>
</p><p>“I hope they’re not broken those are Ray Ban’s,” Agatha teased before Rio’s lips were on hers again.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate, she parted Agatha’s lips with her tongue, pulling her closer by sticking her finger into the waistband of Agatha’s boxers and tugging. Agatha’s hands found purchase on Rio’s neck; she pushed her thumbs gently against the front of it to steady her.<br/>
</p><p>The kiss intensified, getting slower, deeper.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s entire body buzzed. She knew what it felt like to be high out of her mind. She’d been on many week benders taking any drug she could get her hands on. No high had ever felt like this. She was certain no high ever would.<br/>
</p><p>Rio started backing her towards something. She assumed it was the couch until her back hit the living room wall. She gasped at the impact, momentarily severing their link before Rio stole the air from her lungs again.<br/>
</p><p>She felt Rio’s hands snake up the side of her stomach before they slid higher and rested on her chest. Agatha waited patiently until…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>There it was. Pressure. Rio squeezed her left breast, and she saw stars.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fu…ck,<em>” Agatha got out in between gasps.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She felt she wasn’t doing enough. She’d practically short-circuited ever since Rio’s lips touched hers. She wasn’t used to not being in the lead, to not dominating. She felt so useless and yet she couldn't get her body to do <em>anything.<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>This was a new level of ecstasy, one so hot and blinding she couldn’t process a single thought she was having. All she knew was that she’d never felt this content.<br/>
</p><p>Rio broke the kiss to turn her attention to Agatha’s neck. She couldn’t stop the way her body arched off the wall, couldn’t stop the way she wanted to melt in Rio’s arms.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife licked the side of her chin where she knew cherry juice had dribbled down before she pulled her lips back on hers.<br/>
</p><p>That seemed to snap Agatha back into her body. The urge to make Rio feel even half of what she was feeling pulsed through her and with one swift movement she flipped them.<br/>
</p><p>Now Rio was the one who was pressed against the wall.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha started pulling off Rio’s blouse, it was getting in the way. Once she was rid of it, it was her turn to break the kiss, dipping her head down to kiss along the edge of Rio’s breasts. She moaned against Rio’s skin. She was so warm and soft, and she smelt so <em>fucking<em> good.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She could hear soft whimpers from above, felt one of Rio’s hands slide around her exposed back until it moved past it and palmed her ass. Agatha short-circuited again, losing her construction as her knees buckled. Rio steadied her before dragging her upwards, so their lips connected again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help herself; she started inching one of Rio’s bra straps off her shoulder, letting it fall loose on her arm.<br/>
</p><p>Why she was even bothering with the strap she didn’t know, she should just pull the whole thing off.<br/>
</p><p>“SPEAKER ON 10%. SPEAKER NEEDS CHARGING!” Blasted through the house startling the two women away from one another.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to throw the speaker out the window.<br/>
</p><p>When her eyes fell on Rio, she was panting, lips swollen, pupils blown wide.<br/>
</p><p>She was so fucking beautiful Agatha thought she might cry.<br/>
</p><p>“We should…probably…stop right?” Rio got out through ragged breaths.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No! We shouldn’t fucking stop we should keep going until I’m on my knees.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Right…we should stop,” Agatha panted.</p>

<p>Rio didn’t sleep.<br/>
</p><p>Alcohol coursed through her veins, she could still taste Agatha on her tongue, her whole body felt alive with something she couldn’t name.<br/>
</p><p>She was the one who had suggested they stop. She was a fucking idiot. She would’ve been more than happy to continue, to let Agatha take her right there in their living room, but she didn’t want to overstep. She had already initiated the entire thing; she didn’t want to push her wife to go to a place she wasn’t ready for.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t even tried to kiss her for god sake.<br/>
</p><p>Walking away from Agatha in the living room last night was probably one of the hardest things she’d ever done, and that was saying a lot.<br/>
</p><p>All night she fought the urge to barge into Agatha’s room and continue where they left off. Now she’d had a taste of Agatha, Rio knew she was hooked, that she’d crave her every time she was in her presence.<br/>
</p><p>This was going to be a big fucking problem.<br/>
</p><p>Her phone buzzed on her bedside table, and she groaned before reaching over to grab it.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Alice: meet me at our old café in an hour. dude we’ve got so much to talk about.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>They really had.<br/>
</p><p>But was that a good idea? If Agatha woke up and found Rio gone, she would assume she’d run away again. Rio wasn’t running, not this time. She had been chained to the ground; she wouldn’t be going anywhere now unless she was forcibly removed.<br/>
</p><p>She’d send a text. She needed to see Alice and they could probably use some space before they spoke about whatever the fuck just happened.<br/>
</p><p>Rio showered, changed into baggy jeans and a faded Brooklyn Nets crewneck jumper she’d had since she was seventeen, some UGGs and sunglasses to hide her hangover before she left the house. She texted Agatha as she made her way towards the subway.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t been back to this café since she joined The Smith’s Programme. It had been two blocks down from her Abuela’s plant shop/their apartment, and on the last Friday of every month, she and Alice would go to this café before school. Rio could only afford to go once a month, and Alice never judged her for it.<br/>
</p><p>She would visit more frequently once she moved back to Brooklyn after she finished college. She now had the money to. It was always a comfort, especially after long missions where she’d been away from home for so long.<br/>
</p><p>The café had large windows so you could people watch, booths which were dark green, and spinney chairs if you wanted to sit at the breakfast bar.<br/>
</p><p>Alice was already there. She had two coffees in front of her and two croissants. She smiled when she saw Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Morning.”<br/>
</p><p>“Morning,” Rio grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Rough night?” Alice quirked an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes and no,” Rio replied, reaching to pick up her coffee. She sighed as the hot liquid coated her throat and heated her insides. “Thank you for this. How much do I owe you?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re good,” Alice said. “You’ll get it next time.”<br/>
</p><p>The fact that Alice was suggesting there would be a next time warmed Rio’s insides further.<br/>
</p><p>“You get that message from Hihi?” Alice asked, ripping a piece of her croissant and putting it in her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm. Mission failed.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice nodded and Rio’s next question popped into Rio’s head.<br/>
</p><p>“Have you and Jen ever failed a mission?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice shook her head. “No. I mean I guess there was this one time we didn’t complete a mission but that wasn’t our fault. We were supposed to move this mission subject from a safe house, but he died before we got there. Nobody knew how.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio almost choked on her coffee. “Erm…”<br/>
</p><p>“You, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah. What was his name?”<br/>
</p><p>“Peter Johnson…I think? I can’t remember it was over a month ago now.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio took another sip of her coffee.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, so how long have you been in the programme then?” Alice asked.<br/>
</p><p>“A month and two weeks?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened. “Only?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah. You?”<br/>
</p><p>“Almost a year now.”<br/>
</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to widen her eyes. “What?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Alice laughed bashfully.<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit into her croissant. “And you’re happy?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice smiled. “Extremely.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio returned it. “And are you…like…keeping it professional?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice furrowed her eyebrows before her face smoothed out in realisation. “You mean are we fucking?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio kicked her under the table.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Alice laughed. “We’re all adults here.”<br/>
</p><p>“She’s not,” Rio pointed at the woman holding a toddler.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s like two,” Alice replied. “She doesn't know what we’re saying. Why are you being weird about this? The Rio I remember didn’t care about talking about sex in public.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>The Rio I remember.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t felt known in <em>such<em> a long time that she’d almost forgotten what it was like for someone to know when you were acting out of character.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“It’s my old age,” Rio quipped.<br/>
</p><p>“Dude we’re thirty-two,” Alice laughed. “And yes, we are, it’s like the first thing we did.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“What about you and Agatha? When did you?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio sipped her coffee slowly. “We haven’t…fucked…yet.”<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Alice yelled.<br/>
</p><p>Everyone in the café turned to look at them. Rio’s cheeks flushed with embarrassment.<br/>
</p><p>“Shush!”<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” Alice apologised. “Why not?” She whisper yelled. “Wait is this some type of kink thing you two have got going on…see how long you can wait until one of you-?”<br/>
</p><p>“What? No!” Rio thought about it, was that what they were doing? “No,” she repeated when she settled on the answer.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh!” Alice snapped her fingers as if she’d figured it out. “Is it because she used to sleep around a lot?”<br/>
</p><p>“What?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well Jen’s told me some…<em>stories<em>…and she’s the whore of St Ives and all.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice threw her hands up defeated. “Then what is it, Rio? Because the sexual tension is there. You two couldn’t stop eye fucking each other over dinner last night.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio took another bite of her croissant to buy her some more time. She swallowed. “I was trying to keep it professional.” Technically not a lie.<br/>
</p><p>Alice blinked at her as if to say that was the stupidest thing she’d ever heard. “You’re in The Smith’s Programme…and…you’re talking about professionalism?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Ri! Fuck professionalism. The shit that applies in main operations doesn’t apply to us. They pair us with the people we’re most compatible with so we work well together. We act as married couples, of course, they expect people to fall in love and fuck!”<br/>
</p><p>The entire café was looking at them again, but this time Rio didn’t care. She threw her head back and laughed. They both did.<br/>
</p><p>“So…you love her…Jen?” Rio asked once they’d settled down.<br/>
</p><p>Alice shrunk into herself, and she looked like that shy sixteen-year-old who was once Rio’s favourite person apart from her Abuela.<br/>
</p><p>“I think so…yeah.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “Have you told her?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice shook her head, sipping her coffee.<br/>
</p><p>“Why not?”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know,” Alice shrugged. “Waiting for the right time I guess.”<br/>
</p><p>“There is no such thing,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah? Like you’re not waiting for the right time to kiss Agatha, to have the <em>talk<em> with her.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“We have kissed thank you very much,” Rio shot back.<br/>
</p><p>“When?” Alice replied just as fast.<br/>
</p><p>The fight drained from her tone slightly as she whispered, “Last night…technically this morning.”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha kissed you,” Alice stated as a fact.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “I kissed her."<br/>
</p><p>Alice jerked her head back in surprise. “You did? I thought she would be the one to initiate it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Me too.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow as if to say, ‘Good for you,’ before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“We gotta talk about the shitshow of a performance the Nets put on this season.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio groaned ready to dive into this rant she’d wanted to get off her chest since october.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t slept.<br/>
</p><p>Her every thought was Rio, Rio…and oh, you guessed it, more Rio.<br/>
</p><p>She was surprised her vibrator hadn’t exploded from how much she’d used it since her return to her room last night. She could’ve kept going, she was more than happy to, but Rio had suggested they stop, and she wouldn’t push.<br/>
</p><p>She heard movement down the hall…she wasn’t listening out for Rio…wasn’t waiting for her to barge into her room like she usually did…no, never. Rio’s footsteps seemed to be retreating, and Agatha couldn’t help but frown.<br/>
</p><p>Was Rio running again?<br/>
</p><p>For fucksake this is why she hadn’t wanted to kiss her yet.<br/>
</p><p>She heard the elevator ping, heard the doors closing, heard it dragging her wife away from her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pressed her hands to her face and groaned.<br/>
</p><p>She hated everything.<br/>
</p><p>After about five minutes of regretting her life choices, her phone pinged. Agatha glared at it. She was prepared to scream at it if it was another passive-aggressive message from Hihi.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled it off the bedside table and flicked it on.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: good morning, i hope you slept well. i’m going to have breakfast with alice, i’m not running again, promise. see you later 🖤<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>All the anxiety and dread left Agatha’s body immediately. She smiled, ready to text back her own reply when the doorbell rang.<br/>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows. The only people who knew where she lived now were her wife and…<br/>
</p><p>Oh.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha made her way to the front door, pulled it open, and Jen all but barged in. Two coffees and a bag of food in hand.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t remember inviting you over.”<br/>
</p><p>“Shut up,” Jen said as she made her way to the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed as she shut the front door.<br/>
</p><p>When she entered her kitchen, Jen had laid out two breakfast bagels, two bowls of fruit in plastic bowls alongside their coffees.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at the fruit remembering the way Rio had taken it from her last night, the way she’d purposely let the tips of Agatha’s fingers dip inside her mouth, the way she’d tasted of them, so sweet, so-<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Jen said, snapping her fingers in front of Agatha’s face. “Where’d you just go?”<br/>
</p><p>“So sorry was thinking about all the things I want to do to my wife.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen grimaced getting a laugh out of Agatha in response.<br/>
</p><p>“I feel sorry for Rio being married to a horny freak like you,” Jen said, sitting at one of the chairs around the island.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha did the same. She reached for her coffee before she said, “Calm down we haven’t even fucked yet.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ha,” Jen laughed dryly as she took a sip of her own.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m being serious.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen stared at her for so long it started to make Agatha feel uncomfortable.<br/>
</p><p>She had to make this less awkward. “You went to Jo’s bagels like we used to every Saturday?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen ignored her question. “You’re serious? You haven’t fucked?”<br/>
</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to ignore a question. “Did you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, I went to Jo’s bagels, have you or have you not fucked?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw hands up dramatically, “No, we haven’t!”<br/>
</p><p>Jen blinked at her. “Are you trying out celibacy or something? Has your mother wormed her way into your mind and turned you towards god?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed, a proper laugh that came from her core.<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>“Then what gives?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>Jen pulled a face. “Have we entered an alternate reality or something? You plus hot woman equals you railing them immediately.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked. “You make me sound like some sex demon.”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, aren’t you?” Jen’s smile was wicked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha deadpanned.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m joking,” Jen said, her smile turning playful. “No but seriously, why haven’t you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha popped a grape into her mouth to buy her some time. Wrong move. Images of Rio last night flashed in her mind again and she choked.<br/>
</p><p>“You good?” Jen lifted an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>“Yep,” she coughed, sipping her coffee. “I just don’t want to ruin what we have.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen furrowed her brow. “Why would sleeping with her ruin…ohhh…you like her!”<br/>
</p><p>And all of a sudden it felt like they were sixteen again squealing about crushes in Jen’s room.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha twisted her face in faux disgust, “I do <em>not.<em>”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Shut up, Harkness. There has only been one other time you didn’t rush to sleep with a woman and now you have a kid because of it. When are you going to tell her?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not.” She would.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t be fucking stubborn and stupid, although I know that’s hard for you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hand up at the unnecessary stray she just caught.<br/>
</p><p>“You gotta tell her!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was done talking about this.<br/>
</p><p>“So, how’d you end up in The Smith’s Programme?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen narrowed her eyes but allowed the subject change.<br/>
</p><p>“Got bored of main operations.” She took a bite out of her bagel, moaning at how good it tasted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha realised then she hadn’t had any of her own. Jo’s bagels were the best bagels in New York, the best bagels anywhere, and no she wasn’t prepared to argue about it. She was right and everyone else was wrong.<br/>
</p><p>She sunk her own teeth into her bagel and sighed as the flavours and textures filled her mouth. This would always be the best hangover cure. She thought this may be what heaven tasted like.<br/>
</p><p>Actually no, most definitely not. Heaven tasted like Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Hold on,” Agatha said around a mouthful of bagel. “You said you would never date another agent.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen nodded. “True, but I was talking to Agent C, and she said that the programme was a good way for more independent agents to connect with humanity again.” Jen shrugged, “She was basically just calling me single and saying I should let the FBI play matchmaker, and I thought, well fuck it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head in agreement. Leaving main operations after one conversation with a senior agent and boredom seemed like a very Jennifer thing to do.<br/>
</p><p>“And do you regret it?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen smiled. “Not one bit. I love Alice, I really do.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha returned it. “You’ve told her?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nah. I’ll get round to it at some point though.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed at Jen talking like confessing her love to her wife was just something she needed to tick off her to-do list.<br/>
</p><p>“I already know how you ended up in the programme.”<br/>
</p><p>“I never told you-”<br/>
</p><p>“Didn’t have to,” Jen cut her off. “After that whole thing where you killed the wrong lawyer.”<br/>
</p><p>“Politician,” Agatha corrected.<br/>
</p><p>Jen ignored her. “And you disappeared for all that time. Oh, yeah. Kinda mad at you for that, you couldn’t even text back, Aggs?” She rolled her eyes. “Anyways, and then you pop out with a whole ass wife after being with Wanda for like seven years, after saying you never wanted to get married…yeah…I knew you joined the programme.”<br/>
</p><p>“Then why was the first thing you did after I introduced you to Rio to tease me about being a slut?”<br/>
</p><p>“Force of habit. And it’s not like I could just blurt out, ‘Hey Aggs are you in The Smith’s Programme?’ could I? I needed to prod, ask the right questions before I was certain.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shifted in her seat. “Sorry…for not texting.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen glared at her before her face softened. “It’s fine. You’re clearly alive so what does it matter.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. They settled into a comfortable silence, eating their breakfast.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs?” Jen said after a while.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>“Be careful with your heart this time around, yeah? With Rio. I know you do everything in your power to protect it, but when you offer it up, it’s no longer yours anymore. I just…I don’t want a repeat of last time. I don’t want this to be another Wanda situation.”</p>

<p>Agatha wondered if she was being incredibly naïve. Jen was right. She should be more careful because wasn’t this exactly how it had played out last time? A shy girl who grew up with no access to the internet and therefore didn’t know who she was, who appeared to have no interest in her apart from mutual attraction until she finally revealed her cards.<br/>
</p><p>Didn’t that <em>just<em> happen with Rio? Clearly Agatha had a type.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha had met Wanda during her first week at Columbia. It was clear by the way she marvelled at the campus that this was the first time she’d visited, and then it was clear why when she spoke. Her accent was thick, Eastern European, Sokovian. And this was her first time in America.<br/>
</p><p>That had been it. One conversation outside of a lecture hall that Agatha barely remembered because she was half asleep and hungover after being at some frat party the night before. She’d pass Wanda occasionally around campus or in halls but unlike everyone else at Columbia, Wanda wouldn’t stop and stare at her, wasn’t desperate to make an effort to befriend her. She acted like Agatha was invisible. It was somewhat…refreshing? She wasn’t sure.<br/>
</p><p>The only people who ignored her were her parents, but Wanda’s intent didn’t seem malicious like her mother’s or due to being too busy for her like her father. Wanda was ignoring her because Agatha was simply another human being to her. Not the ‘Spectacle off-spring,’ or ‘The Princess of the Upper East Side.’<br/>
</p><p>To Wanda, Agatha was simply…ordinary.<br/>
</p><p>Three years post Columbia, twenty-four-year-old Agatha was doing something stupid like crying in an alleyway in Brooklyn. Agatha had become a fast climbing agent, her skills undeniable to anyone after her repeated display of dead shots. But her mother had found her, of course she had after she’d switched her last name to her maiden. Or maybe her father had ratted her out, broken his promise to never reveal where she’d run off to after she left college. Wouldn’t be the first time he’d betrayed her trust.<br/>
</p><p>Sometimes Agatha couldn’t help but hate him. He’d gone through all the effort to help her disappear, help her get into the FBI when she was advised against it because of who she was, but he always caved when it came to his wife. That’s how Agatha had ended up in conversion therapy, troubled teens summer camps, catholic private school when he had planned for her to go to the same school he had.<br/>
</p><p>That’s when Agatha knew the fairytales lied. The man did not save the girl, the girl had to save herself.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was crying because her mother had said the usual. It was only affecting her so much more today because she hadn’t been prepared for the ambush. <em>You were born evil. I should’ve killed you the moment you left my body. You are a vile slut. Your sexual deviance will be your demise. You deserve nothing good. The fact you can’t keep your legs closed illustrates how much of a pathetic excuse of a human you are, sex is all you can offer to another.<br/>
</em></p><p>The thoughts were so loud, so bitter, so <em>true.<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha thought she might die. She couldn’t breathe. She’d slid down the side of the wall with her knees to her chest and her hands pressed to her face waiting for the devil to snatch her soul from her body when hands rested on her kneecaps. Agatha looked up and was met with deep green.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda whispered. Her thick accent was gone. “You can’t be here by yourself it isn’t safe.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her. Was she dead? Had she somehow made it to heaven and her guardian angel was this girl who she’d always found pretty but never properly spoke to?<br/>
</p><p>“Are you real?” Was all Agatha could manage.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda smiled. “Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>“How…?” she sniffed, “How did you know it was me?”<br/>
</p><p>“I think I’d recognise you anywhere,” Wanda quietly admitted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked at her and Wanda sucked in a short breath.<br/>
</p><p>“I meant what I said, you can’t stay here.”<br/>
</p><p>She lifted Agatha onto her feet, ready to pull her out of the alleyway when Agatha hugged her. And no, she didn’t think before she did it. She just really needed a fucking hug, and Wanda was there, and she’d smiled at her, and she was so <em>warm.<br/>
</em></p><p>Wanda squeezed her tightly, rubbing her back as Agatha’s tears racked through her.<br/>
</p><p>They stayed like that for ten minutes until Wanda pulled back, laced her fingers with Agatha’s and tugged her back onto the street. She’d taken Agatha to her apartment, wrapped her in blankets, made her tea and played with her hair until she fell asleep.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda wouldn’t ask what she’d been crying about until months later.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt <em>good.<br/>
</em></p><p>She’d just sat and yapped with her former best friend now friend again for the better part of four hours like no time had passed between them, like it hadn’t been sixteen years since they’d last seen each other face to face. And she was now on her way to confess her feelings to her fake wife…no just wife…no…wait…?<br/>
</p><p>She was making her way back to the subway when her eyes snagged onto something she hadn’t noticed in years.<br/>
</p><p>And all of a sudden, she was twenty-four again, and this was the most confusing day of her life:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was about to leave her favourite café. Her Abuela had texted her about needing more cinnamon because she was making Tres leches, and if Rio could buy some on the way over.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>That’s when someone slid into the booth opposite her. She looked up from her phone, her face scrunched in confusion until she realised who she was staring at.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Papá?” Rio asked before she had the chance to snatch the word as it left her mouth.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Hola, mi hija.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio blinked at him.<em> Why? What? Huh?<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>
<em>She hadn’t seen her father in nineteen years and now here he was, popping up completely out of the blue? Yeah, fuck that and him.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“<em>No,” Rio said before she slid out of the booth and stormed off towards the door.<br/>
</em></p><p>
<em>“Rio. Hija, por favor,” Rio’s dad said as he followed her out of the café.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Diego had grabbed his daughter’s arm to stop her, and Rio had snatched it free.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Leave me alone. I don’t want to see you,” Rio gritted out.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I know but-”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio cut him off. “What you thought you could just leave me? Toss me aside as if I were nothing when mami died? As if I were worthless, nothing more than an inconvenience,” her voice cracked, and she wasn’t sure she was making any sense, but she’d been holding all of this in for almost two decades now. “And then you just show up out of the blue? For what? What the fuck do you want?!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Diego stared at her, regret in his eyes and Rio wanted to fucking smack him. He didn’t get to do that, feel regret. He was the one who left, who orphaned her, who made her grieve alone when her mother died.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>His voice was soft when he said. “I need you to protect yourself, mija. You need to find a new job, they are-”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Are you fucking kidding me? You can’t just show up and start dictating my life! You haven’t been fucking in it!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her father’s face hardened, his voice taking on an urgent edge. “I know I don’t have the right, but I need you to listen to me.” He reached for Rio’s hands and squeezed firmly so she was forced to look at him. “You must learn to fight, to be strong, to protect yourself. You cannot continue your work with plants you must join the police force, or the FBI, or the CIA, or something. I cannot tell you why, but if you are ever to listen to a thing I say, let it be this. Please,” Diego pleaded.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio stared at him; her facial expression unreadable as she tried to fight off the tears pressing in her eyes. How did he know she worked with plants?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her father’s eyes travelled along her face. His lips twisted into a small smile. “Eres tan hermoso. Te pareces a tu mami.” You are so beautiful. You look just like your mom.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Fuck you,” Rio squeaked because how dare he say that to her when that was the reason he left.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Diego nodded. “Adiós, mi amor.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>And then he’d left her again.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio ran to the to the closest alleyway and sobbed. What was her father talking about? Protect herself? Why and from who? She loved her job as a taxonomist, would she give that up now simply because of something her absent father had said? Rio didn’t trust that man for as far as she could throw him, but there was something about the way he spoke…so vulnerable, so desperate, so concerned.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio leaned her head back, letting it rest on the wall behind her and inhaled. She blinked. The air was filled with a scent she couldn’t quite name. It smelt like power and…and…two other words she couldn’t put her finger on. Rio stood up straight and inhaled again, deeper this time. The fragrance calmed her, stilled her tears.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>She wiped her eyes and solidified a plan.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio was going to join the FBI.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Staring at the same alleyway where she’d decided to alter her entire course of life now was surreal because her life had changed course again. Even more drastically this time. Rio needed to stop assuming she knew where her life was going at this point.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha heard the key turn in the lock from the living room. Jen had left half an hour ago and she’d showered and changed out of her pyjamas, replacing them with sweatpants and a plain white tee.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe she was being naïve with Rio, but where she’d felt ignored with Wanda she felt <em>seen<em> with Rio. Not ordinary, not the spectacle off-spring, appreciated for who she was entirely. That Agatha simply <em>being<em> was everything to Rio.<br/>
</em></em></em></em></p><p>Not exploring that…well that would just be stupid. And Agatha Harkness was many things, stupid not one of them.<br/>
</p><p>The door opened and closed, and Rio appeared in the living room. She smiled like she’d been waiting all day for this moment.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi,” Rio said softly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. An overwhelming feeling of pure and utter happiness overcame her, and she found herself wanting to tear up. Luckily, she didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>“Good morning.”<br/>
</p><p>“Afternoon,” Rio corrected as she took off her UGGs and sat on the other side of the couch.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wished she hadn’t. Why couldn’t she sit closer? On top of her even.<br/>
</p><p>Okay…so where to start? How does one admit to their fake wife they have feelings for them? And once you do, then what? They were already married. Did they go on dates, become girlfriends and then get married <em>again<em> but for real this time? How the hell did any of this work?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>You know what, fuck it. I’ll figure it out later. I’m just going to tell her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“I have feelings for you.”<br/>
</p><p>“I think about you all the time,” Rio said at the same time Agatha did.<br/>
</p><p>A smile flew onto Agatha’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you now?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head playfully. “Shut up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Does this mean you have feelings for me too?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, what else would it mean?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, her wide smile still on her lips. “I know but I need to hear you <em>say<em> it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You love to make things difficult, don’t you?” Rio scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said matter of factly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes before she said. “I have feelings for you, Agatha Harkness. Are you satisfied now?”<br/>
</p><p>“Almost, could you say that again? I need to record it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed, preparing to scold her wife when Agatha tugged her arm, pulling her across the couch and crashing her lips with hers.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s laughter died out as she relaxed into the kiss.<br/>
</p><p>She tasted just as good as she did yesterday, and Agatha was content with never kissing another woman again.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait,” Rio said, breaking away from her. “If we do this, we have to start being honest with each other, <em>communicating.”<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha pretended to contemplate her request. “Hmm, I don’t know. I was hoping we would just make out, occasionally talk, but hardly ever.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and Agatha turned serious.<br/>
</p><p>“No, yeah. I’ll be honest with you, promise.”<br/>
</p><p>Her wife smiled a proper smile that reached her eyes. “Good.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio snaked her hand up Agatha’s neck and dragged her lips back down to hers.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha <em>hated<em> this mission.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The high that she was on from yesterday after she and Rio confirmed they were on the same page was long gone.<br/>
</p><p>They were on the outskirts of New York in a warehouse with intel that it was being used as a makeshift holding facility for slaves, all of whom were children. Fast fashion brand Zip and Zazzle had stirred up a storm on social media, it was now all the rave and because of this, they needed <em>help<em> keeping up with the demand.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The owner, Paul Zazzle had held a conference stating that the brand was using ethical means to do so, but like all men, Paul Zazzle was a liar.<br/>
</p><p>Hihi had assigned Agatha and Rio the task of scooping out the warehouse. They were to collect the necessary information and report it back to the FBI. They were to do nothing more. A whole team would be required to extract the children, if Rio and Agatha tried to do it on their own, they would blow the entire operation.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to throw up. How could Hihi just expect them to see the children and then not do anything about it?<br/>
</p><p>She watched Rio as she fiddled with the lock to break into the warehouse. She couldn’t help but stare at her, she knew Rio was a good agent, she’d seen it, but the way Rio had acted when she’d found out what the mission was…Agatha couldn’t understand it.<br/>
</p><p>Missions like this were part of the job, always had been always will be, but Rio hadn’t even batted an eye. She’d read the message then continued eating her breakfast as if she’d just checked the weather. Agatha had thrown the rest of her food in the bin.<br/>
</p><p>Rio finished picking the lock and motioned Agatha to join her as she entered the building. The night sky was dark, the warehouse even darker. Once she had shut the door behind her, the two women were plunged into darkness. Rio flicked on her torch and Agatha followed suit.<br/>
</p><p>So far there wasn’t anything to note. There was no sign of life, children or potential guards. The space they were in was utterly deserted and it nearly forced out a sob from Agatha’s lips. Nobody cared about protecting these children. They’d been left unguarded.<br/>
</p><p>The two women advanced further into the building, torches lighting the way, their guns just below them. They came across another door minutes later. Agatha shone her torch in the lock's direction as Rio dropped down to pick the next lock.<br/>
</p><p>The door creaked making Agatha wince. The sound was far too loud in the silence and if anyone was near, they would hear it. They slipped into the next room and Agatha’s heart dropped.<br/>
</p><p>Cages. Dozens of them that appeared to be made for dogs but were instead housing children.<br/>
</p><p>The room was filled with a foul stench: urine, vomit, faeces.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t breathe.<br/>
</p><p>Rio got to work immediately, noting down how many cages there were. As Agatha ventured further into the space, torch searching she started to make out the sound of shuffling. Most of the sounds retreats, fearful children probably thinking their captors had returned.<br/>
</p><p>The children looked too thin, too pale, too…dead.<br/>
</p><p>Their clothes were dirty or far too small for them. Agatha wasn’t doing her job. She wasn’t noting down the necessary information or assessing how big the space was. How could she possibly care about any of that when these children were living in such disgusting conditions?<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes locked onto hers and she froze in front of a cage at the end of the seventh row. Those brown eyes, eyes of a stranger’s, were so reminiscent of the brown eyes of Rio, of Nicky.<br/>
</p><p>She hadn’t seen Nicky since they bumped into him in Central Park. She’d been surviving off of phone calls and FaceTimes when Rio would teach him Spanish. Now more than ever she missed him. She thought about all the parents that were missing these children in fucking cages. Agatha couldn’t help but think about what if this had been Nicky. It threatened to kill her.<br/>
</p><p>The big brown eyes blinked at her, curiosity in them. Unlike every other child in the warehouse, this child appeared brave, fearless even.<br/>
</p><p>“Have you come to move us again?” The girl asked, her voice hoarse probably from lack of water.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head, and the little girl narrowed her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Then what do you want? You clearly haven’t come to feed us.”<br/>
</p><p>And now Agatha’s only wish was that she had some food.<br/>
</p><p>She found her agent's voice as she said, “I’m FBI.” She wanted to say she’d come to save them, but she hadn’t…<em>couldn’t<em>. That wasn’t their mission.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The girl's head jerked back slightly, a flicker of hope in her eyes before it vanished again.<br/>
</p><p>“Where’s your badge?”<br/>
</p><p>“Not on me.”<br/>
</p><p>The girl let out a sound Agatha was sure was supposed to be a scoff, but it came out as a wheeze.<br/>
</p><p>“Nice try.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. She didn’t have any proof; she didn’t even have a team with her.<br/>
</p><p>She went to move on when the girl spoke again.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait,” she croaked. “Are you really? Are you here to rescue us?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha replied. “A team will be on their way.”<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t do it?” The girl’s voice wavered for the first time.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha knew she should say no, or shake her head, or <em>something<em>. But she couldn’t bring herself to do it. Her fingers twitched towards the lock.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Don’t,” Rio’s voice sounded from behind her. “That’s not our job.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned slowly towards her fake wife, her body shaking with anger. What the <em>fuck<em> did Rio mean by, ‘That’s not our job?’ This was their fucking job.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I can’t just <em>leave<em> them here.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You must,” Rio said, her voice void of emotion.<br/>
</p><p>“What is wrong with you?” Agatha seethed. “How are you okay with any of this?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s face was unreadable. “Let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>“Please don’t,” the little girl pleaded. “Please don’t leave us, I can’t stand this place anymore.”<br/>
</p><p>That was enough for Agatha. Fuck her orders, she wasn’t leaving these children behind. Who knew how long the FBI would take to extract them. They could be long gone by the time a team moved in.<br/>
</p><p>She reached towards the lock on the girl's cage and as soon as she did felt strong arms wrap around her torso. Rio was dragging her away. She tried to scramble out of the other woman’s grip until Rio lifted her off the ground.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha thrashed around in her arms, kicking and pulling at Rio’s hair. Her fake wife’s hold only tightened. It took everything in Agatha not to scream out. She elbowed Rio in the stomach, felt Rio fold over and drop her. She started for the cage again when a foot swept underneath hers, causing her to crash to the floor. The touch she had been holding rolled away from her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio caught her foot, dragged her backwards and Agatha flipped onto her back before she kicked out with her other foot. It connected with Rio’s stomach and the other woman hunched over once more. She got to her feet ready to turn when Rio caught her arm and twisted her to face her again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t think before she brought her fist up and swung. Rio blocked it with her forearm but wasn’t so lucky blocking the second punch Agatha aimed at her left side. Rio stumbled to her left with a grunt.<br/>
</p><p>She held her side as she straightened. There was warning in Rio’s tone when she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha. Stop.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s gaze hardened and she was positive she’d never looked at Rio with such malice before.<br/>
</p><p>“Make me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed; her head tilted.<br/>
</p><p>When she didn’t reply Agatha scoffed. “That’s what I-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha got cut off when her fake wife smacked her across the face. Her right cheek tingled with searing pain.<br/>
</p><p>“Get it together,” Rio gritted out. “You are an agent, start fucking acting like it.”<br/>
</p><p>A manic smile spread across Agatha’s lips. “Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t know being an agent meant being an emotionless bitch.”<br/>
</p><p>If Agatha’s words had hurt Rio she didn’t show it. Her face remained as unreadable as ever.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck. You,” Agatha spat.<br/>
</p><p>She turned towards the little girl whose face was riddled with panic.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s voice lost its spiteful edge as she said, “Someone is coming to get you out of here. I’m sorry it couldn’t be me.”<br/>
</p><p>The girl shook her head, pleading with her and Agatha had to turn away before she could contemplate knocking her fake wife out and executing the mission the way she would’ve wanted to.<br/>
</p><p>She picked up her torch and shoved past Rio before making her way out of the warehouse.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The car ride home had been silent. When they got to the house, Agatha went straight to her room, stripped off her clothes and headed to the shower.<br/>
</p><p>As the warm water from her overhead shower fell onto her skin, Agatha leaned her head back and sobbed. She thought about the little girl and her big brown eyes, she thought about all the other children she had left in the warehouse, she thought about Nicky.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha folded over and threw up.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long she spent in the shower, but when she got out her skin was pruned and her head spun. She draped her towel over herself, walked out of her bathroom and flopped onto her bed. No part of her cared she was soaking her bedsheets.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and somehow, fell asleep.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>She woke with a start.<br/>
</p><p>Her phone buzzed incessantly on her bedside table. She sat up, wiped the sleet from her eyes and furrowed her eyebrows at the fact she was still in her towel before she reached over to grab it.<br/>
</p><p>She sucked in a breath before she tapped on the answer icon.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, baby,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause…a very long pause.<br/>
</p><p>“Nic-”<br/>
</p><p>“Mama, what’s wrong?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. Clearly, her voice was not as void of emotion as she had thought.<br/>
</p><p>She let out a breathy laugh before she replied. “Nothing’s wrong, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mama,” Nicky said, his voice far too concerned for a five-year-old.<br/>
</p><p>“Yesss,” she tried to sound as cheery as possible. “How did you sleep?”<br/>
</p><p>“Good. Mama, what’s wrong?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ignored his question. “That’s good! I slept well too. What are you having for breakfast?”<br/>
</p><p>“Coco Puffs. Mama?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sighed. Nicky wouldn’t let this go. The boy was persistent, another trait of hers he’d unfortunately acquired.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m just tired, sweetheart. I had a long day at work yesterday.”<br/>
</p><p>There was another pause, it was clear Nicky was not convinced.<br/>
</p><p>She heard Wanda in the background. Moments later Nicky said:<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, Mama. Go back to sleep.”<br/>
</p><p>“Will do, sweetie. Have a good day. I love you.”<br/>
</p><p>“I love you too,” Nicky replied before the line went dead.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at the living room ceiling. She was lying flat on her back trying to process whatever the fuck had just happened last night.<br/>
</p><p>After she’d sent off the necessary information to Hihi, she hadn’t slept. The whole event played on a constant loop in her head.<br/>
</p><p>The mission had been a cruel one, no part of her wanted to do it. She’d felt so fucking helpless, but she’d had a job to do. Nothing, not even her own emotions had stopped her from carrying out a job before no matter how difficult it had been.<br/>
</p><p>She just couldn’t stand the way Agatha had looked at her, acted towards her as if she was nothing but a soulless being carrying out the actions as if she were the fucking grim reaper ferrying souls to the afterlife. Detached and unbothered as if the task couldn’t affect her.<br/>
</p><p>It <em>did<em>. But they were special agents, that is exactly how they were supposed to be. If Rio allowed herself to feel anything she would never get out of bed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>On top of that, they had fought. Agatha hadn’t pulled her punches and Rio had smacked her, hard enough to bruise. She’d lost control, let emotions seep through and manifest into anger. Not to mention the malicious words that had been exchanged and the hateful looks her wife had shot her way.<br/>
</p><p>She hadn’t meant any of it, actually, she would’ve preferred to help Agatha free every single child in that warehouse. But that wasn’t the task they’d been assigned, and Rio would always complete her tasks.<br/>
</p><p>What sounded like a pan falling came from the kitchen. Her wife was alive so that was a good start. Rio hadn’t heard a peep from Agatha ever since she headed to her room last night. How did one even go about approaching this situation? ‘Hey, sorry for smacking you and telling you, you were being a shitty agent. Do you forgive me? I miss you.’<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked. <em>I miss you<em>. Rio didn’t miss anyone (at least that’s what she tells herself).<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The doorbell sounded.<br/>
</p><p>Was that Jen? Had Agatha told her best friend how much of a shitty wife she was already? Oh, for fucksake this would be good.<br/>
</p><p>She heard the shuffle of Agatha’s feet, heard her unlock their front door.<br/>
</p><p>The voice that rang out…Rio had not been expecting that voice.<br/>
</p><p>“Mama!” Nicky squealed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t help herself. She got up and made her way to the hallway, not to be seen, she’d just poke her head out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had stooped down to hug her little boy.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, Nicky. What are you doing here sweetheart?” Although the question was directed to her ex towering over them.<br/>
</p><p>“He knew you were upset and wanted to come see you. You know how he is. He wouldn’t stop asking and I caved.”<br/>
</p><p>“I never told you where we lived,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m a lawyer, I have connections, remember sweetheart?” Although it was entirely condescending.<br/>
</p><p>“You know it's not safe for him to know where we live,” Agatha shot back.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, and he’ll be under the protection of two federal agents. He’s the safest little boy in Manhattan,” Wanda answered. “I’m coming back to get him in an hour.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mommy, you said two,” Nicky argued.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, Mommy’s a liar.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t see Agatha’s face, but she was certain she was scowling at her.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda stepped back through the threshold when she paused, concern in her eyes for the first time Rio had seen. “What happened to your face?” Her voice was gentle, there was actual affection there.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t pretend like you care,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda looked genuinely offended. Her head snapped up and she locked eyes with Rio. They bore into hers like she could tell the bruise was Rio’s fault.<br/>
</p><p>That’s when three sets of eyes locked onto her.<br/>
</p><p>The weight of the situation fell on Rio immediately and she could no longer breathe. She walked off towards the elevator, cursed it for taking so long, then slipped into it as soon as it arrived.<br/>
</p><p>She walked into her room, flopped onto her bed and cried.<br/>
</p><p>No wonder Agatha was having such a difficult time with this mission. It was so much more for her than devastating, it was heartbreaking. She must’ve thought of Nicky, of how she would’ve felt if it were him.<br/>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t even thought about that. As always, her wife was making her rethink her entire way of life. It was important to be detached, to complete her job but it was <em>also<em> important to be a shoulder to cry on.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She’d left Agatha to be alone last night when she probably needed someone to be there for her, take care of her, help carry the weight of what they’d just gone through. And instead, Rio had left her with a purple bruise on her cheek.<br/>
</p><p>“Fucking idiot,” Rio mumbled between sobs.<br/>
</p><p>She heard the elevator doors open and clamped her hand around her mouth and nose to stifle her tears. She listened out for the sound of footsteps passing her room. The sound never came. Instead…<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s door opened slightly, and two brown eyes locked onto hers. She wiped at her tears as Nicky shuffled into her room.<br/>
</p><p>“Your Mama’s room is down the hall, Nicky,” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky nodded but continued his advance anyway.<br/>
</p><p>He reached her bed and then proceeded to try and make his way up it. His struggle was clear considering how high it was, and after his second attempt Rio offered:<br/>
</p><p>“Would you like some help?”<br/>
</p><p>The little boy nodded and as carefully as she could, she hoisted his small form onto her bed.<br/>
</p><p>When he’d gotten settled, he simply stared at her. The same way children do when they are fascinated by a new discovery.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky truly <em>was<em> beautiful. His brown hair so thick and curly like his mother’s, his brown eyes so big and wide. Even his outfit was adorable, a red Spider-man t-shirt and light-washed jeans. Rio realised then that they were wearing different variations of the same top. Hers a little older and faded since it had been in her wardrobe since she was seventeen.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Is Spider-man your favourite superhero?” She whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Mine too,” she said with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky took her in further, his face twisted as if he were deciding if he should do something or not.<br/>
</p><p>He decided on his answer when he got up on his knees, shuffled towards Rio and flung his tiny arms around her neck.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked startled. She would’ve been prepared for anything except that.<br/>
</p><p>She gently wrapped her arms around him and let herself relax into the hug. She hadn’t realised how much she’d needed it. She wasn’t sure how long they’d stayed like that, but when Nicky finally pulled away, he brushed at the bangs framing her face.<br/>
</p><p>“You and Mama looked really sad.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t find the words she needed to reply. How was this little boy more emotionally intelligent than most men double his age?<br/>
</p><p>“No es...estés triste.” <em>Don’t be sad<em>. He had butchered the pronunciation and struggled to get the words out, but Rio was so impressed all she could do was smile.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Muy bien,” Rio replied, Nicky’s arms still around her neck.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky smiled back at her revealing his missing front tooth.<br/>
</p><p>Now more than ever she understood Agatha's thought process during the mission. She too would’ve done everything in her power to free those children from their captivity, because a child should only look like this.<br/>
</p><p>She needed to fix things with her wife, and she needed to fix them now.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Is she okay?” Agatha asked when Nicky returned to the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>He nodded. “She just needed a hug, Mama. You should give her one too.”<br/>
</p><p>“I think you’ve given her enough hugs for the both of us,” Agatha smiled. She clapped her hands together. “Okay, you’re on mixing duty.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky had asked to make chocolate chip cookies, and she had already added the sugars, butter and eggs to the bowl.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky giggled as she hoisted him onto the kitchen island.<br/>
</p><p>“Want me to hold the bowl?”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky shook his head furiously. “No, Mama. <em>I’m<em> doing it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Okay, okay,” she backed away from him, her hands up in surrender.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe she should have held the bowl. Ten minutes later their kitchen was covered in egg, sugar and flour.<br/>
</p><p>“For someone so small you sure make big messes,” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not small, I’m big!” Nicky exclaimed.<br/>
</p><p>“You sure are. Can you put the chocolate chips in the bowl for me please?” She asked, handing the packet over to him.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky accepted it eagerly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to check on the oven and when she turned back her son was popping chocolate chips into his mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“Nicholas Harkness!”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky started giggling and Agatha tried and failed to keep a straight face.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re lucky I prepared for this.” She reached behind him and pulled out another packet of chocolate chips.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky leaned forward; hands eager as he tried to swipe the new packet.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tutted. “Pour that one in first.”<br/>
</p><p>He pouted before he did as he was told. Agatha opened the fresh packet and gave it to him. They disappeared into the bowl too. She started stirring the dough before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, now what’s next?”<br/>
</p><p>“We shape them!”<br/>
</p><p>“We do!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure how she now had cookie dough in her hair and flour all over her face. All she did was help Nicky roll the dough into balls. But her son liked to play with her hair and touch her face even though she warned him not to because they were baking.<br/>
</p><p>“Mama’s gonna have to get in the shower now, look what you’ve done to me,” her voice playful.<br/>
</p><p>“I think you look very pretty,” Nicky beamed.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you, baby. I think you look pretty too.”<br/>
</p><p>He scrunched his nose and pushed at her face when she tried to kiss his cheek.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t want a kiss?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Nicky squealed as she leaned in again.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you sure?” She leaned in once more and Nicky finally let her kiss him.<br/>
</p><p>He kissed her in return.<br/>
</p><p>“Why thank you.” She pulled him off the island and set him on her hip. “Let’s go check on the cookies.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Nicky left twenty minutes after the cookies had come out of the oven. They’d eaten one together with warm milk and Agatha let him take six out of the remaining ten home. She would’ve let him take all of them, but he’d insisted that she and Rio needed some too. And as always, Nicky got his way.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt a thousand times better, she always did after seeing Nicky. It could be for five minutes or the whole day and the joy she’d feel would be just the same.<br/>
</p><p>She turned to the ginormous task of cleaning the kitchen. As she cleaned, of course, she thought about Rio. She thought about how she first felt when she joined the programme, how she’d sworn off relationships. Maybe she should’ve stuck to that, maybe she still could.<br/>
</p><p>Rio fascinated her, saw her for who she was, and she really liked the woman, there was no denying that. But Rio had been so detached, she seemed like she wasn’t affected at all by the mission. Agatha didn’t know if she could be with someone like that. She was aware she didn’t have much room to talk. She’d always preferred to hide from her emotions too, but she <em>was<em> making some type of effort not to do that with her fake wife.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She thought Rio cared about her; she had been so sure of it. And it probably wasn’t fair of her to think any differently after one incident. But she couldn’t deal with another relationship with another woman who couldn’t and wouldn’t be there for her when she needed them most.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t want this to be another Wanda situation.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Jen’s voice sounded in her head.<br/>
</p><p>And neither did Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>She finished cleaning the kitchen and finally freed her hair from its hair tie. A clump of cookie dough fell out of her hair and onto her t-shirt. She shook her head and laughed. That boy really was too messy for his own good.<br/>
</p><p>She needed a shower.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew Nicky had left. The hour had been up twenty minutes ago, and she knew Wanda would be back to get him as soon as.<br/>
</p><p>She listened out for her wife. The elevator doors opened, and she heard her footsteps pass her room. Rio waited a few minutes before she got up and made her way down the hall.<br/>
</p><p>She knocked. “Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>No reply. That’s when she heard the shower going.<br/>
</p><p>Okay. She’d come back later…or…<br/>
</p><p>Rio opened her wife’s bedroom door and ventured in. This wasn’t a good idea, they were arguing, they hadn’t spoken all day.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t stop until she reached the bathroom door.<br/>
</p><p>She bit her lip.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe I should just wait. I don’t think cornering her in the shower is a good idea.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She turned to leave.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Be there for her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio could do that. She was used to looking after the people she cared about and so far with Agatha; she hadn’t been doing a good job.<br/>
</p><p>She sucked in a short breath and let herself into the bathroom. She prepared for the most likely outcome of Agatha screaming at her and telling her to go away.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s bathroom was slightly larger than hers. There was a marble sink and large mirror directly opposite the door which was next to the toilet. To the right, there was a large bathtub and to the left, there was a huge walk-in shower with a shower bench and an overhead showerhead that covered most of the ceiling.<br/>
</p><p>Rio loved hers, it felt like it was raining every time she showered.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s blue eyes locked onto her immediately, and soon after her arms flew up forming a cross across her chest.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Okay, not a good start.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>But not, not a good start. Agatha hadn’t screamed at her to get out…yet.<br/>
</p><p>Rio kept her eyes on Agatha’s as she slowly started to remove her shirt, giving her wife the opportunity to tell her to stop.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio was entirely naked, she paused, waiting for Agatha to vocalise an objection.<br/>
</p><p>Again, it didn’t come.<br/>
</p><p>Now with the clear go-ahead, Rio walked towards the shower, pulled the door back, and stepped in.<br/>
</p><p>She was enveloped in a cloud of steam. Warm water fell onto her skin and soaked her hair. Rio pushed it out of her face and set eyes on Agatha. She bit her lip, the bruise on her cheek looked much worse than she had imagined. It was too big, too purple and in that moment, Rio wanted nothing more than the power to heal.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were searching, waiting.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes dropped to the shampoo bottle next to Agatha’s feet. She bent down cautiously to pick it up, keeping her eyes on the bottle and off her wife’s body. When she was standing straight again, she said:<br/>
</p><p>“May I?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s arms were still crossed across her chest. Wordlessly, she turned around and Rio took that as the green light.<br/>
</p><p>She reached past Agatha to turn off the main showerhead so only the one behind her fell. She then poured a healthy amount of Agatha’s expensive shampoo onto her hands and rubbed them together before she placed them on Agatha’s scalp. The other woman’s shoulders dropped as Rio started massaging her scalp.<br/>
</p><p>With tender fingers, she worked the product into Agatha’s hair. Agatha tilted her head back so Rio could see better.<br/>
</p><p>After a while, Rio started scratching at her scalp with her nails. Her wife gasped at the feeling and Rio applied more pressure.<br/>
</p><p>Once Agatha’s head was covered in a decent amount of foam, she moved on to the ends of her hair, stooping down for the shampoo bottle again. Rio would be happy to run her fingers through her wife’s hair forever. It was so long, and thick, and soft. She let it run over her hands, watched it fall when she let go of it.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio was satisfied she’d done a thorough job, she gently put a hand on Agatha’s waist, guiding her backwards into the falling water.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wouldn’t notice the slight shake of Agatha's shoulders until she was done washing out the conditioner.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby?” Rio whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply.<br/>
</p><p>She lightly pulled on the other woman’s shoulder encouraging her to turn to face her. When she did tears were streaming down Agatha’s face. She’d never seen Agatha cry before, and she never wanted to see it again.<br/>
</p><p>The sight was devastating.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s arms had dropped from her chest, they hung limp at her sides.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t think before she drew Agatha’s body into hers, wrapping one arm around her head and the other around her back. Her body shook as Agatha’s did. She rested her head on Agatha’s shoulder and held her.<br/>
</p><p>It took a moment before she felt movement from the other woman. Agatha’s hands moved underneath her arms to grip her shoulders.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio soothed as Agatha sobbed. “You’re okay, I’ve got you.”<br/>
</p><p>And she did.<br/>
</p><p>The warm water fell around them and it felt like they were trapped in their own little world. That as long as she held Agatha nothing could happen to them. Rio wouldn’t let it.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled away to rest her forehead on Agatha’s. She stroked away her tears with her thumb, being careful to avoid the bruise on her cheek.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t stopped crying, and she didn’t know what else she should do. She couldn't stand to see her like this.<br/>
</p><p>Rio inhaled deeply before she brought her lips to Agatha’s bruised cheek planting a deep kiss there. It was everything she hadn’t said yet: <em>I’m sorry. I’m here for you. I’m not going anywhere.<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha’s tears stopped soon after as if she understood.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife made the next move, snaking her hand up Rio’s left upper thigh, passing her hip, until it rested lighting on Rio’s rib. The place she had punched her. Agatha’s warmth seeped into her skin and Rio wouldn’t have been surprised if her touch alone healed the bruise.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve got you too,” Agatha breathed.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio returned to Agatha’s room once she dried herself off and changed. Whilst she was gone Agatha had blow-dried her hair and was now sitting on the floor in between Rio’s legs as Rio brushed it from where she sat on the edge of the bed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew what she had to say now but she didn’t know where to start. She’d never said this out loud to anyone before.<br/>
</p><p>She took a deep breath and forced her lips to move.<br/>
</p><p>“When I was five my mother died, and my father left me because of it. He said I reminded him too much of her.”<br/>
</p><p>She waited in case Agatha had any questions. When it appeared she didn’t, she continued.<br/>
</p><p>“My Abuela was the one who looked after me. Ever since the day he left, I vowed I would never let myself feel like that again. Worthless. Abandoned. So, I learned how to detach. To never let people get too close to me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio tilted her head back and forth, “With the exception of Alice…I guess.” She cleared her throat, “Um…so…so…”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck this is hard.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Take your time,” Agatha said from below.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled as she combed through her hair. “So, I don’t like showing emotions like fear or despair and I guess it makes me appear…soulless. Because if I am, when people leave me, it doesn’t hurt as much because they never really knew me. And I never really let myself know them.”<br/>
</p><p>She combed absentmindedly through Agatha’s hair. It was a comfort, a distraction from the words she was willingly let pour from her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“In a way it kind of makes me selfish because I’m not willing to acknowledge other people's feelings or how I might be affecting them by being this way. I’d much rather appear detached, and laser-focused on my job than let people see the ways it could be affecting me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio inhaled again. “I act like nothing bothers me when in fact <em>everything<em> does. I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you yesterday. I’m sorry for hitting you. I’m sorry for-”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Rio,” Agatha cut her off. She turned around so that she was on her knees looking up at her. “You aren’t the only one who's in the wrong. You were right, I wasn’t acting like an agent,” Agatha nodded her head willing Rio to understand. “Thank you, for telling me. And I’m sorry too. I shouldn’t have hidden from you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes playfully. “It’s not like I made an effort to seek you out.”<br/>
</p><p>“But you did. And I’ve done it before, remember, the night you found out about Nicky.” Agatha placed her hands below Rio’s shorts. “I have this habit of hiding and running. It’s how I survive just like you detach. I’d much rather hide from my problems by physical means or by doing drugs, drinking alcohol, losing myself in sex. It’s easier…safer,” she whispered the last part.<br/>
</p><p>“I’d gotten better at not doing that, but then there was this whole thing with my ex, and I ended back at square one,” Agatha continued. “But I’m working on it, I <em>will<em> work on it. For you.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio felt a smile tugging at her lips.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha got up on her knees so that they were eye level. “I want to make this work…you and I.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was full-blown smiling now. “Me too,” she whispered. “I want to be there for you…always.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“I have a feeling you’re going to change my life, Agatha Harkness.” And no, Rio wasn’t ready to admit that she already had.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned into the hand that now rested on her cheek. “Mine too.”<br/>
</p><p>The two wives stared at each other, smiles on each of their lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I just say, we failed at day one of communicating.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “Well, it’s a good thing we’ve got many more to rectify that.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The house smelt of body odour, whisky and cigarettes and it looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in years. There were dirty clothes all over the floor, unwashed dishes with half-eaten food everywhere you looked and spilt liquids and drug residue on every floor and surface.<br/>
</p><p>Toby Denis was a slob.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Hihi, Mrs &amp; Mrs Smith.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>You are headed to Lake Como, Italy, to secure high-value target Toby Denis. You are to transport him SAFELY to the designated safe house and await further instructions.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The sounds from the television echoed around the house as Agatha and Rio snuck inside. Agatha rolled her eyes at the state of the 4.5 billion dollar mansion. As always, Rio stifled a laugh at her theatrics.<br/>
</p><p>Toby had no sense of self-preservation. He hadn’t even turned to look at the sound of a pan falling when Rio slipped on a puddle of god knows what, knocking it off the kitchen counter as they approached his location in the living room on the couch. He was too busy snorting a line of coke.<br/>
</p><p>With one swift movement, Agatha pulled a black hood over his head and locked it with a thin plastic handcuff.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Toby shouted. He swung sluggishly at nothing, too coked up or drunk to do any real damage.<br/>
</p><p>Rio caught one of his attempts and made quick work of securing a handcuff around one wrist whilst Agatha pinned him down so Rio could grab the other.<br/>
</p><p>“You want money?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes again.<br/>
</p><p>“Because I have it. I have loads of it!”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve got more than enough of my own,” Agatha replied boredly.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re here to keep you safe, Toby,” Rio answered, her agent voice on.<br/>
</p><p>“By handcuffing me and putting a hood over my head? Yeah, not fucking likely. Let me go right now or I’ll-”<br/>
</p><p>“You’ll what?” Agatha entertained. She was ready to hear whatever the man was about to come up with.<br/>
</p><p>“Well…I’ll…I’ll…”<br/>
</p><p>“Brilliant,” she said, clapping her hands together when he gave her absolutely nothing. “Looks like you’re coming with us.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll scream,” Toby said.<br/>
</p><p>“Go on then.”<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs,” Rio warned, giving her a pointed look.<br/>
</p><p>“What?”<br/>
</p><p>“Stop toying with him and help me get him in the car.”<br/>
</p><p>Toby started moving then, thrashing around on the couch like a fish out of water. “You won’t take me! I won’t allow it!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio sighed before she pulled at his restraints and yanked him up by his shoulder.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, look at that,” she said as she started shuffling him out of the house. “Guess we’re taking you after all.”<br/>
</p><p>Toby did not give up his ‘fight’ as the two women dragged him outside to their waiting matte black Porshe Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid Coupé. It was pathetic really, the way he tried to wriggle out of their grip. He looked like he had ants in his pants.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, you deal with <em>that<em>,” Agatha gestured to Toby once she’d opened the back passenger door for Rio to shove him in.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She got into the driver’s seat as Rio tried her hardest to calm Toby down.<br/>
</p><p>“We should’ve gagged him,” Agatha said as she started up the engine.<br/>
</p><p>“What did you just say?” Toby seethed.<br/>
</p><p>“Shut up, both of you,” Rio scolded. “Toby you’re safe with us, we’re FBI. Agatha, stop making digs at our mission subject.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s voice was entirely serious, but Agatha caught her trying to hide her smile in the review mirror.<br/>
</p><p>“But he’s so easy,” Agatha whined.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes as she strapped him in. She shut the passenger door before climbing into the seat next to Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Then, they were off.<br/>
</p><p>Lake Como was beautiful in May. Every tree was covered in green leaves, flowers dotted the mountainside as they drove down winding lanes towards the safehouse, the sun was shining, what more could you ask for?<br/>
</p><p>Rio slipped her hand easily into Agatha’s and Agatha didn’t fight the smile that spread across her lips.<br/>
</p><p>Ever since their talk two days ago where they had laid everything out, things had been (she didn’t want to say good) <em>good<em>. Everything felt so clear now that they had communicated, and she wondered why they hadn’t done it sooner (they were both afraid of their own feelings and would rather die than face them).<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Like Agatha had said, she’d met her match.<br/>
</p><p>She’d been so ready to be done with Rio, to pretend that her feelings for her could be stuffed and buried. And Rio, like Rio always did was prepared to challenge her. She’d gone into her bathroom and showed her that she couldn’t run and hide from her feelings. She’d taken care of her, been there for her just as Agatha wanted.<br/>
</p><p>The little shit.<br/>
</p><p>“I can’t breathe!” Toby exclaimed the same time Rio started running her thumb along Agatha’s hand.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha knew she was dramatic, she was self-aware like that, but this Toby was taking it to a whole new level.<br/>
</p><p>“There’s breathing holes in the fabric, you’re fine,” Rio told him. “Just calm down. We’re here to help you remember?”<br/>
</p><p>“Then why is my head in a bag!”<br/>
</p><p>“For your safety,” Rio replied calmly.<br/>
</p><p>“It can’t be for my fucking safety if I can’t fucking breathe!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wondered if all their mission targets were going to be insufferable.<br/>
</p><p>Toby started hyperventilating. “Oh god, oh god, oh god. I recently had a heart attack.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes for probably the fiftieth time in the space of half an hour. “It’s probably all the coke you’ve been snorting.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio whacked her in the arm as Toby’s monologue continued.<br/>
</p><p>“I…can’t…breathe,” he panted.<br/>
</p><p>“Toby,” Rio said, her voice dripping with authority. “Calm down.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re gonna have to take this hood of me,” he nodded. “Mhm. That’s the only solution.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face as if to say that was the stupidest thing she’d ever heard.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve gotta do it. Please or I’ll die! You told me you were here to keep me safe!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed. “We need him alive.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head before nodding at Rio to take off the hood.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife nodded in confirmation, detaching her hand from Agatha’s, undoing her seatbelt and swivelling around to lean into the backseats.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to get to the safehouse now before she strangled their mission subject and blew the whole mission.<br/>
</p><p>Toby’s head popped out of the hood, and she locked on to him via her rearview mirror. He was pushing sixty with white hair and ice-blue eyes and he had a beer belly and sickly looking skin. The man was not looking after himself. No wonder he’d had a heart attack if he was even telling the truth.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sat back in her seat and in no time her hand was in Agatha’s again.<br/>
</p><p>They arrived at the safehouse twenty minutes later.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, Toby,” Agatha said. “We’re going to move you in there now.” She nodded her head back to the small house surrounded by trees. “I don’t want any-”<br/>
</p><p>“Babe,” Rio cut her off. “I think-”<br/>
</p><p>A bullet whirled towards them hitting the side mirror on Rio’s side.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned around in time to see a figure dressed in black slip behind a wall from where they’d shot at them in front of the safehouse window. Another figure previously hidden by a tree appeared, and another, and another.<br/>
</p><p>Bullets rained down on them soon after.<br/>
</p><p>“Who the hell is after you?” Agatha asked at the same time their back window shattered as a bullet hit it.<br/>
</p><p>“Get down, Toby!” Rio instructed.<br/>
</p><p>The man did as he was told.<br/>
</p><p>Rio retrieved her gun immediately and fired back through their now open window, hitting the figure behind them.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha. Drive,” Rio urged.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman did, backing away from the not-so-safehouse. Her gun hung out the window as she shot at the approaching targets. She hit one woman, didn’t get a chance to hit anyone else as she swerved the car and sped away.<br/>
</p><p>“Who was that and what have you done?” Agatha yelled as they made their way back down the winding lanes of the mountainside.<br/>
</p><p>Toby said nothing. He remained hunched over in a sort of foetal position on the floor of the car. He was making strange blubbering sounds that reminded Agatha of a walrus.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you fucking crying?” She screamed.<br/>
</p><p>“On our six,” Rio announced.<br/>
</p><p>A black Range Rover with blackout windows was on their tail.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, for fucksake,” Agatha muttered as she pushed down on the accelerator.<br/>
</p><p>The Range Rover followed suit, ramming into the back of their car.<br/>
</p><p>“Are they fucking serious?” Agatha complained as if the person who had tail-ended them was an idiotic driver and not someone trying to murder them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed as her wife sped up once again, swerving the car this way and that to try and shake their inconvenience.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you laughing right now?” Toby screeched like a prepubescent boy. “We just got shot at!”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, and we’re still alive calm down,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>The car on their tail annoyingly had kept up with Agatha. It was just as close as ever.<br/>
</p><p>“Right. They’re pissing me off now,” Rio said as she pushed herself towards the open passenger’s window, gun raised.<br/>
</p><p>A bullet sailed past and almost took her arm off once she did. She immediately retreated back inside as more bullets hit and ricocheted off their car.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck.”<br/>
</p><p>“We gotta get off this mountain,” Agatha said. “I don’t feel like driving over any more cliff edges.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed again as she prepared to hang out the window once more.<br/>
</p><p>“I will <em>not<em> be driving over any mountainsides!” Toby declared.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Shut up,” the wives replied simultaneously.<br/>
</p><p>The second the gun stopped firing, Rio stuck her upper half out of the car and shot at the tyres of the vehicle behind. One of the front tyres burst and the Range Rover skidded before crashing into the mountainside.<br/>
</p><p>“Well done,” Agatha praised, a wide smile on her lips as Rio’s upper half returned to the car.<br/>
</p><p>“I do try,” Rio replied, her smile mirroring her wife’s.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m gonna die,” Toby mumbled. “I’m gonna die, I’m gonna die, I'm gonna die.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as they sped down the mountain. Rio kept her eyes trained on the road just in case any more Range Rovers made an appearance.<br/>
</p><p>Once at the end of the lane by the lake, Agatha made a sharp left into a residential area. Colourful houses and shops lined each street as Agatha slowed down as to not hit any civilians. Church bells sounded and once the church came into view, it was evident why.<br/>
</p><p>There was a wedding.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>For fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>A cluster of people blocked the road as the happy groom and bride stood in the centre kissing.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha honked her horn, and the sound fell on deaf ears.<br/>
</p><p>“Speed up and they’ll move,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“No!” Toby yelled from the floor of the car. “You will not run over a wedding that’s bad luck!”<br/>
</p><p>The patience Rio had been displaying for the insufferable man in the back of their car seemed to snap as she grit out:<br/>
</p><p>“Well, what do you want us to do Toby?”<br/>
</p><p>More people poured out of the church adding to the already large crowd.<br/>
</p><p>“Because they’re slowing us down and putting you in more danger.”<br/>
</p><p>“Crashing a wedding <em>literally<em> is bad luck!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Oh! So, you’d rather die than have bad luck?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before retrieving her gun, rolling down her window, sticking it out and shooting: once, twice.<br/>
</p><p>The wedding began to disperse as people screamed and ducked for cover.<br/>
</p><p>“Or we could just do that,” Rio nodded her approval.<br/>
</p><p>She pressed down on the accelerator again, bolting down the street until a Range Rover came out of seemingly nowhere and crashed into the side of their car. The gunman in the passenger’s seat closest to Agatha stuck his head out the window, gun raised, and she didn’t hesitate to shoot him right in the centre of his head. He collapsed, falling out the car window.<br/>
</p><p>She started to reverse, heard the screams of fleeing people as they tried to dive out of the way before she hit them.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, stop, stop, stop!” Rio urged.<br/>
</p><p>Her words didn’t register soon enough, and another Range Rover smashed into the back of their car. Every person in the vehicle jolted from the impact.</p>

<p>“I’m gonna die,” Toby sobbed as Agatha pushed open her car door.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched her as she shot three times at the three targets moving in on them over the hood of the car. Agatha hit all three, one in the head, one in the shoulder, and one in the heart. She ducked behind the car at the retaliation.<br/>
</p><p>Rio climbed into the backseats and yanked Toby up on his knees. She leaned over him and pushed his car door open before pushing him out. He fell to the cobbled ground with a splat. She made quick work of climbing over him to get out of the car before forcing him to stand.<br/>
</p><p>“Keep your head down,” Rio ordered.<br/>
</p><p>Toby nodded profusely.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was on the floor, hands under the car to grab the assault rifle beneath it.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife rolled to her feet again, didn’t hesitate before spraying a rain of bullets onto their fast approaching enemy. She took most of them out on her first sweep, took the rest out on her second.<br/>
</p><p>Rio cut the restraints locking Toby’s hands together with her knife whilst the sounds of guns and bullets hitting marks rang out around them.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s go,” she nodded her head to the alleyway behind them.<br/>
</p><p>She made Toby go first, keeping on his heels behind him. She saw her wife toss her rifle next to their car and follow suit.<br/>
</p><p>Stairs. Far too many of them came into view and Toby let out a sound that was most definitely a sob. He stopped.<br/>
</p><p>“Move!” Agatha barked behind them. “Or I’ll push you and don’t think I won’t.”<br/>
</p><p>That snapped Toby into action. He practically threw himself down the hundreds of stairs. They’d almost made it to the bottom when a bullet hit the wall by Rio’s head.<br/>
</p><p>She spun around to see a motorbike headed straight towards them. She nodded at Toby to go ahead whilst she and her wife shot at the gunwoman on the bike.<br/>
</p><p>Rio hit her shoulder; Agatha hit her heart. The vehicle crashed into the wall with a loud bang.<br/>
</p><p>They grabbed an arm of Toby's each and started ushering him down the next alleyway. Unfortunately, it opened up to a bridge, a bridge that would leave them exposed to potential bullets if they came their way. They didn’t have a choice; they had to cross it.<br/>
</p><p>“Cover us?” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“Always,” Agatha replied as she reloaded her gun.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pushed Toby down and used her body to shield his as she began to sprint across the bridge. She couldn’t see what her wife was doing, just heard bullets fire from above her head and saw sparks from bullets ricocheting off her surroundings.<br/>
</p><p>They crossed the bridge safely, taking cover against the closest wall.<br/>
</p><p>Another motorcycle with a gunman appeared soon after. Rio tugged on Toby to move again but this time he resisted.<br/>
</p><p>“I…can’t…breathe,” he panted.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, and you certainly won’t be able to if there’s a bullet in your heart now move,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Toby grunted before he did as he was told.<br/>
</p><p>They ran up a steep incline, having to dodge children as they played a game of football. The sound of an approaching motorcycle only grew louder.<br/>
</p><p>“In there,” Rio said, nodding her head to another passageway in the alley.<br/>
</p><p>It was a dead end, leading only to a gated home but they could wait there and hope the motorbike passed without detecting them.<br/>
</p><p>It did.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ran out of their hiding spot soon after, Rio just behind until she paused realising she didn’t hear footsteps behind her. She backtracked until she locked onto Toby who was still cowering in the passageway.<br/>
</p><p>She looked at him the way you would a child who knew they had done something wrong. His head hung low before he shuffled his feet to join her.<br/>
</p><p>They made their way up the rest of the hill. A mistake. They had hit another dead end. All around them now were colourful houses. People hanging out their washing, people smoking on their balconies.<br/>
</p><p>Toby sat down on a bench outside of the yellow house hunched over.<br/>
</p><p>“I need to…I need to pee.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hold it,” Agatha replied fiercely. Her eyes darted to Rio. “Ri…thoughts? What are we doing?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, tilting her head up to scan her surroundings. “Go through a house to get to the water.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha clapped her hands, “Okay, let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>Toby shook his head. “Hold on, let me catch my breath.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m giving you ten seconds,” Agatha told him.<br/>
</p><p>Rio glared at her before nodding her head to tell her wife to take a walk. Her wife complied, turning her attention to focusing on working out their escape route.<br/>
</p><p>“Toby, look at me,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>He looked up, eyes fixed on hers.<br/>
</p><p>“In through your nose out through your mouth, ready?”<br/>
</p><p>Toby did just as she instructed. They did this four times before his breathing levelled out.<br/>
</p><p>“You ready?”<br/>
</p><p>He nodded before getting onto his feet.<br/>
</p><p>The sound of a door being bashed in sounded. “In here,” Agatha beckoned from a house three doors down.<br/>
</p><p>Rio dragged Toby to her wife’s location and pushed him through.<br/>
</p><p>A frenzy started up in the house as soon as they entered. They’d intruded on a family eating dinner. Harsh words in Italian got spat their way and Rio fumbled around in her brain for the right words as Agatha dragged Toby through the house.<br/>
</p><p>“Polizia, calmati.” <em>Police, calm down.<br/>
</em></p><p>To nobody's surprise, the family did not calm down. One woman grabbed her knife from where it rested next to her plate.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She ignored the family’s advances and ran after her wife and Toby who had made their way to the balcony outside the family’s small living room.<br/>
</p><p>A vase shattered by Rio’s head as she neared the balcony. She turned to see a gunwoman preparing to shoot at her again. Rio beat her to it, shooting. The blood from her enemy’s head splattered on the wall behind them and an old woman screamed.<br/>
</p><p>“Scusa.” <em>Apologies.<em> She said, turning on her heels and away from the family she’d just traumatised.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>When she came outside, she’d just caught the middle of Toby and Agatha’s latest argument.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s a one-story jump you’ll be fine!” Agatha yelled.<br/>
</p><p>Toby shook his head. “Nope. Nope, can’t.”<br/>
</p><p>“You can,” Rio jumped in before her wife had the chance to spit any more venom in the man’s direction. “Look, just watch me.”<br/>
</p><p>She put her gun in her holster before swinging one leg over the balcony railing, then the other. Rio jumped and landed on the gravel surface below.<br/>
</p><p>“And then it’s only one more jump after that, see.”<br/>
</p><p>Toby bit his lip before he did as Rio had just done, swinging one leg over the railing then the other at a much <em>much<em> slower pace.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Wanna do that any slower?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Just,” Rio held up her hand.<br/>
</p><p>“But he’s-”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah!” Rio said as you would when a child is adamant about getting in a rebuttal.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha kept quiet.<br/>
</p><p>What felt like hours later, Toby finally jumped off the balcony railing. Agatha jumped down in triple the speed.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, and now this one’s just the same.”<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t it was slightly higher.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve already done it once, just do it again,” Rio said as she jumped down to the pavement by the water.<br/>
</p><p>“I can do it,” Toby said although it sounded like it was more for himself.<br/>
</p><p>“You can,” Rio encouraged.<br/>
</p><p>“Yep,” he swung his arms in preparation for the jump. “Yep, yep, just…”<br/>
</p><p>She caught Agatha rolling her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope, nope. Can’t do it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Do it or I’ll push you.”<br/>
</p><p>Toby gasped, bringing a hand to his heart. “You’ve already threatened that before! You wouldn’t!”<br/>
</p><p>“She would.”<br/>
</p><p>“I would,” Agatha and Rio replied simultaneously.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Toby said, his hands up in surrender. “I’ll jump just…could you count me down?” He was talking to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay. Ready?”<br/>
</p><p>He nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“One…Two…”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pushed him before Rio said three.<br/>
</p><p>He landed on his two feet but then proceeded to collapse on the floor as if it were from the impact.<br/>
</p><p>“Ow!” He exclaimed, rolling around on the floor. “I think I’ve sprained my ankle.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’ll live,” Agatha said before she climbed down to them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio did find herself laughing at that.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on, Toby. Get up we gotta go.”<br/>
</p><p>“I am not going anywhere with that <em>woman<em>!” He pointed at Agatha.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Okay, that did. She was willing to tolerate anything but that.<br/>
</p><p>“Get the fuck up,” Rio said, her voice lethal.<br/>
</p><p>Toby stilled.<br/>
</p><p>“You can say anything…anything at all except something like that. I will not tolerate you speaking to my wife in that tone. Understood?”<br/>
</p><p>Toby nodded as if he were a little boy being scolded by his teacher. He peeled himself off the ground and waited for further instructions.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had a shit-eating grin on her lips before she said, “We’ll steal one of those boats.”<br/>
</p><p>She was talking about the ones hooked up at the dock a few meters ahead of them. Wordlessly, Toby made his way over to one.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha kept looking at Rio’s lips like she wanted to risk the whole mission by fucking her against one of the walls surrounding them.<br/>
</p><p>“Quit looking at me like that,” Rio warned. And she meant it because if Agatha made a move, she was certain she would do nothing to stop her. “We’ve got a mission to complete.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha replied even though she was licking her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“I mean it, Harkness.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s voice was low when she replied, “I heard you the first time, Vidal.” She stepped closer towards her.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, so stop.”<br/>
</p><p>“I am stopping.”<br/>
</p><p>They were nose distance away now.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you two coming?” Toby called from one of the boats.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes never left Rio’s as she said, “Yep.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha drew closer if that were even possible.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll have my way with you later,” her breath hot against Rio’s skin.<br/>
</p><p>It was a promise and the hairs on Rio’s arms stood on end. Her wife walked away from her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>This fucking woman.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and stretched out her neck before slipping on the mask of an agent when heading over to the pair on the boat.<br/>
</p><p>Toby was fiddling with the motor as it roared to life.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>BANG!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>A bullet hit the side of the boat next to Toby’s head.<br/>
</p><p>“Get down, Toby!” Rio yelled as another gun fired.<br/>
</p><p>From the balcony they’d just jumped from, a gunman had his gun trained on them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha held her gun up to shoot back when the boat jolted forward throwing her off balance. She folded over as another shot rang out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shot back as the boat zoomed away into the heart of the lake.<br/>
</p><p>“You guys, okay?” Rio asked once the gun was out of range.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife and Toby nodded.<br/>
</p><p>After a long stretch of silence, Rio’s phone pinged.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Hihi,<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Waterplane coming to pick Toby up. The coordinates as to where will be sent shortly.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She showed the message to Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Good,” the other woman muttered.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The waterplane had been and gone. They were finally, <em>finally<em> rid of their insufferable mission subject Toby and Hihi had given them four uninterrupted (their words) days off.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Things were looking up.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing?” Rio asked as she docked their stolen boat at the other end of the lake.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was on her phone; she hadn’t gotten out of the boat yet or offered Rio any help in trying to dock it.<br/>
</p><p>“Securing our transportation out of here.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah,” Rio nodded. “What do you want to do with our days off once we get back to New York?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Not sure yet.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio offered her hand as Agatha began to make her way off the boat.<br/>
</p><p>“M’lady.”<br/>
</p><p>“You are too kind,” Agatha teased, taking Rio’s hand.<br/>
</p><p>She stepped onto the dock with a slight wobble.<br/>
</p><p>“You, okay?” Rio asked, holding her steady.<br/>
</p><p>“Of course.”<br/>
</p><p>They’d found a bench outside of a church and waited there for half an hour. Rio swung her legs back and forth whilst Agatha rested her head on Rio’s shoulder. She almost fell asleep. The rhythmic rocking of her wife’s body as she swung her legs mixed with her comforting scent had the same effects as a lullaby.<br/>
</p><p>A car honking had Agatha’s eyes fluttering open, she smiled when she locked eyes with the driver.<br/>
</p><p>“Long time no see, Aggie,” Luca called from inside the forest-green Ferrari Portofino. His Italian accent thick.<br/>
</p><p>She rolled her eyes as she got up from the bench. “You know how much I hate that nickname.”<br/>
</p><p>“Apologies,” Luca smiled, getting out of the car.<br/>
</p><p>He hugged her, pulling away to hand her the keys.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve been looking after it?”<br/>
</p><p>The man with olive skin ran his hands through his chocolate brown hair. “Yes,” he replied boredly. “I only crashed it that one time.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, okay,” she laughed. Agatha stepped out of the way to introduce Rio who was now standing behind her. “This is my wife, Rio. Rio, Luca. He’s a family friend.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hi,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“Hello. È bellissima.” <em>She’s beautiful.<em> He told Agatha.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Grazie,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>Luca blinked at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Ooo...yeah, she can understand you I should’ve said,” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>He stuck his middle finger up at her. “Ciao.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ciao,” Agatha replied, a smile still on her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Ciao. It was nice to meet you,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>Luca took her hand and kissed it. “You too.”<br/>
</p><p>“You can fuck off now,” Agatha told him.<br/>
</p><p>He did, but not before sticking his middle finger up one more time in parting.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you happen to know someone on every single continent?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha replied, opening the passenger door. “I don’t know anyone in Antarctica.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes before hopping into the passenger’s seat.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said as she shut the door.<br/>
</p><p>“You needed all of this to drive us to the airport?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha answered as she climbed into the driver's seat. “Only the best for my girl.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes again but there was no missing the toothy smile that painted her lips.</p>

<p>Agatha couldn’t help it. She kept glancing at her beautiful wife as they drove down the scenic roads of northern Italy.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had her black Prada sunglasses on, her dark hair whipping around her from the wind sweeping past their heads due to the roof being down. There was a shine on her now olive forehead because of the day spent in the Italian sun. The shine was down to sweat but it made Rio glow just the same.<br/>
</p><p>“Keep your eyes on the road, Harkness,” Rio told her after she’d stared at her a second too long and the car swerved.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re distracting me,” Agatha replied, her eyes now on the road.<br/>
</p><p>“By sitting next to you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “Something tells me we’re not going to the airport.”<br/>
</p><p>“What makes you say that?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, we’ve been driving for three hours now, and it takes one and a half to get to Milan.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gasped, feigning shock. “You worked that out super quicky, have you ever considered working for the FBI?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed again. “So, where are we going?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tapped the side of her nose.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not gonna tell me?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “We’ve been driving for three hours now and it’s only now you’re asking where we’re going?”<br/>
</p><p>“By hour one I still thought we were going to the airport, by hour two I thought you’d gotten lost and were taking another route, by hour three <em>then<em> my interest sparked.” Rio smiled, “I’ve learnt it’s best to be patient with you before you bite my head off.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha brought her hand to her heart as if she’d just been shot. “I would <em>never<em> bite your head off…it’s too pretty. Your arm on the other hand.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio elbowed her as Agatha cackled.<br/>
</p><p>She rested her hand on Rio’s thigh and squeezed. “You trust me?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio leaned her head back on her headrest before turning to face her. “Unfortunately.”<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect! Then you’ll love where we’re going,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio returned it.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“Portofino?” Rio asked twenty minutes later as they made their way around yet another mountainside.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re taking me to fucking Portofino?!” Rio shrieked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha just had to look at her now. She’d never seen Rio act like this, all excited and screaming like a preteen being told they were going to see their favourite artist in concert.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait,” Rio eyed her suspiciously. “I only mentioned I wanted to go to Portofino once how did you remember?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Are you going to ask me that every time? You asked me how I knew your favourite Thai dish was Thai green curry the third time I ordered it for you, you asked me how I knew you bite your nails every time you have nothing to do, you asked me how I knew you have an impulse to squeeze any limb of mine you happen to be attached to every time you get nervous. I pay attention to you, Rio!” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip. Had anyone ever paid this much attention to her before apart from her Abuela? No. No, they hadn’t.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio replied softly.<br/>
</p><p>“For…?”<br/>
</p><p>“Making me feel like I’m not invisible.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at her before returning her eyes to the road. “You’re not invisible, Rio. Never in my eyes.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blushed and for the first time, she didn’t care.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you blushing or is that sunburn?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back and laughed. “Using my own words against me, huh?”<br/>
</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>They were staying at the Splendido Portofino. A five-star hotel at the top of the mountain. Agatha had booked them a one-bedroom suite that looked out onto the sea. Their room was to die for.<br/>
</p><p>Upon entering you were met with a long corridor that split off into a large bathroom with a large tub, mirrors and shower. Rio couldn't wait to get into that bath later. The rest of the doors opened to wardrobes.<br/>
</p><p>Inside the suite itself was a king bed, a desk and some lounge chairs. Their balcony was right in front of the bed and Rio knew she would enjoy watching the sunset from it. The next room over had a couch, a dining table and a television.<br/>
</p><p>Everything was Mediterranean style. Each wall was decorated with China plates with intricate Italian designs, paintings depicting sea shells, or Roman statues. Even the light fixtures looked like they’d been carved by fucking Michelangelo.<br/>
</p><p>“You like?” Agatha asked as the bellboy rolled in their luggage.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re in Portofino, I would’ve been happy with a tent. Yes, I like it! Are you serious?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Just checking.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio had never stayed in a place this fancy outside of a mission. She often forgot her wife was not just her wife and was actually the daughter of multi-millionaire Patrick O’Connor. That she’d probably spent her whole life going to places like this. She wondered if the novelty had warn off on Agatha by now.<br/>
</p><p>“How’d you get our luggage?”<br/>
</p><p>“I told Luca to get it before he dropped the car off.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah.” Rio threw her head back. “I need to get in that bathtub and then I need a nap.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tipped the bellboy after he finished putting away their luggage.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re gonna have to pick one, we’ve got dinner reservations at eight.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked. “We <em>do?<em> How? We only found out we were getting some days off a few hours ago.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I know people.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah…I’m not gonna ask what that means.” Rio clapped her hands together. “Okay, I’m going to have a quick shower and try and squeeze in a nap.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Rio frowned.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t take quick showers, Ri. Not after missions.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to ask how she knew that but then remembered what her wife had told her earlier. <em>I pay attention to you, Rio.<br/>
</em></p><p>“I <em>can.”<br/>
</em></p><p>“Okay,” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Two hours later the two wives were sat by the sea watching the sunset. Their wine glasses full as they waited for their food.<br/>
</p><p>Rio, as always, looked stunning in a cream-shear mini dress that ruffled at the ends and on the straps on her shoulders. It had a low neckline and although the dress wasn’t completely see-through, Agatha could still make out the outline of her underwear. A move she definitely knew was on purpose.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wasn’t wearing much makeup, her glowing skin from her day in the sun meant it wasn’t necessary.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha on the other hand was wearing a long fitted lilac satin dress that accentuated her chest. Again, a move done on purpose.<br/>
</p><p>The two wives were playing with fire tonight.<br/>
</p><p>“You look good,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Why thank you. It isn’t like this is the seventh time you’ve told me since we left the hotel room.”<br/>
</p><p>“I see it, so I’m saying it. What did you do to your hair?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tucked a strand behind her ear. “I just defined the curls.”<br/>
</p><p>“You should do it more often.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head.  “You know how much hair I have. It takes forever.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll do it!” Rio replied hastily.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha chuckled.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Rio said, shrinking into herself embarrassed.<br/>
</p><p>“Any excuse to touch my hair.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio straightened at that, finding her confidence once more. “And what about it?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed again, “Nothing at all.”<br/>
</p><p>Twenty minutes later the two women were deep into their bowls of pasta whilst Rio was scolding Agatha for never watching any of the Spider-Man films.<br/>
</p><p>“But you love films!”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah…so?”<br/>
</p><p>“Sooo…why haven’t you watched any of the Spider-Mans?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not the biggest fan of superhero movies.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio gasped. “You take that back!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged her shoulders. “Sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>“But Nicky <em>loves<em> Spider-Man. Why haven’t you watched it with him?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Nicky loves Spider-Man.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help the smile that tugged at her lips. The pair had really taken a liking to one another. They started talking about more than Spanish. The FaceTime would always start that way, a Spanish lesson, and then Rio and her son would divert to an entirely different topic. Like how Nicky should become a baker because the chocolate chip cookies he made were ‘phenomenal’ (Rio’s words). And Nicky had asked what that meant and Rio had told him, and then the topic would change <em>again<em> because Nicky would start asking what other words also meant phenomenal.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>In the two days after they had made up, when Nicky would call, he would ask for Rio straight away, ‘Hi Mama, where’s Rio? I’ve got to show her what I made at school.’ Agatha thought it should sting that her son would rather talk to her wife than her. It didn't.<br/>
</p><p>It, like everything did when involving Rio, felt so easy, so (she didn’t want to say normal) normal. As if this had been their entire life together. Sometimes Agatha wished it could’ve been. She was sure half the fucked up shit that happened to her wouldn’t have if Rio were in her life.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, trust me. He’s tried. I usually distract him by suggesting we do something else I know he’ll like more.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back and laughed. “Mother of the year.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha winked at her. “Okay,” she took a sip of her wine. “If you could live anywhere in the world other than New York, where would you live?”<br/>
</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio sat back and pondered. “Australia,” she said moments later.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded for her to elaborate.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, it’s hot most of the time, and if I lived in say…Sydney, I could swim every day. They’ve got plants and spiders and-”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry…spiders?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm. One time on a mission there I had a day off, so I went to the zoo and got to hold a tarantula. It was all fury, and it crawled up my arm and I swear there is no better feeling.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked at her. “…Then a spider crawling up your arm?”<br/>
</p><p>“Tarantula,” Rio corrected.<br/>
</p><p>“You are so strange.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio replied as if she’d just been given the world's best compliment.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha let out a low chuckle.<br/>
</p><p>“What about you? Where would you live?”<br/>
</p><p>“Anywhere my mother isn’t,” Agatha answered easily. “If it weren’t for Nicky I would’ve left New York a <em>long<em> time ago.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio stared at her and Agatha realised this was the first time she’d mentioned her mother. She knew Rio had some idea of who her mother was, she’d googled her a million times after all, but Rio had never asked her about her.<br/>
</p><p>She appreciated it.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t get along?” Rio asked although it appeared she already knew the answer.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head before taking a long gulp of her wine. She needed it if they were about to have the abusive mother conversation.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Rio said before she returned to eating the pasta on her plate. An indicator she was dropping the conversation.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Thank god for that.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha knew it was a conversation they needed to have, but not when they were eating dinner by the sea in Italy and Rio looked like <em>that.<em> There were more important things to be focusing on.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Okay, time to switch gears.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sipped her wine preparing to do just that when Rio spoke first:<br/>
</p><p>“Just out of curiosity…how many people have you slept with?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows over her wine glass. She pulled it away from her lips and asked, “You want to know?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio poked at her pasta. “Yeah?” She posed it as a question as if she were unsure.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you sure? Do you want me to be completely honest with you right now?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked at her for the first time since she asked the question. “Yeah,” her voice found its confidence again. “Yeah, be honest with me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know if she was being baited. Sure, they’d agreed to be honest and communicate with each other from now on, but Agatha had slept with <em>a lot<em> of people. Not all of them she could remember because she was too high or drunk or both.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“More than fifty.”<br/>
</p><p>Not a lie, not a complete truth. She knew it was nearing the eighties.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked at her, “I…that…good for you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “They don’t call me the ‘Whore of St Ives’ for nothing,” she teased.<br/>
</p><p>To her surprise, Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“You said you use it as a coping mechanism…is it just that?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had to think about it. “I’m not sure,” she answered honestly. “I mean don’t get me wrong, I enjoy sex, but sometimes I think I’m doing it for the wrong reasons. To distract myself, out of boredom, to make a headline that will hopefully send my mother into an early grave.”<br/>
</p><p>Dammit. She was talking about her mother again.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, her face void of judgment.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve…I’ve only slept with four people.”<br/>
</p><p>She was letting Agatha know as if to say she wasn’t as experienced. Agatha doubted that. Rio was breathtaking, she’d undoubtedly been in a relationship before. She knew the other woman had some tricks up her sleeve.<br/>
</p><p>She gasped in fake shock. “You’ve slept with people outside of marriage? I am so shocked.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed before kicking her under the table.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was well past eleven when the pair, to the workers gratitude, finally left the restaurant. They’d talked about everything from the first man landing on the moon to why Coco Puffs are the best cereal ever invented (Rio’s words). And during that time, touches had become more frequent, eye contact had become more intense.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had an arm slung around Rio’s waist as they stumbled back towards their hotel via the winding roads of the mountainside. Alcohol plus hotel on top of a hill was <em>not<em> a good combination. She had tripped a couple of times already, almost dragging Rio down with her. Rio had cackled and Agatha had to cover her mouth with her hand so as to not wake up the sleeping residence.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Shush,” Agatha hushed as she and Rio sat in the middle of the road because she’d slid backwards climbing the mountain for the fourth time.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breath was hot against her palm as she tried to stifle her laugh.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio’s laughter settled, the two wives simply stared at each other and Agatha’s entire body pulsed. Rio blinked lazily at her, her long eyelashes coated in mascara and her brown eyes outlined with black eyeliner. They seemed to sparkle from the reflection of the dim streetlights.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha dragged her hand down past Rio’s lips, it caught on her bottom one, tugging it slightly before she rested her hand lightly on the base of her neck. She felt Rio’s heart pounding against her chest. Evidence of how much she wanted Agatha…or maybe she was just drunk and high off laughter.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled at Agatha’s dress by her waist to pull her closer, the action caused her dress and bra strap to fall loose at her shoulder and Rio’s eyes darted there immediately.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Are we about to fuck on this road? I mean I’m not complaining.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes returned to Agatha’s as she snaked her hand up Rio’s neck to draw her into her. They were nose-distance away before the sound of a speeding motorbike filled their ears. Agatha’s agent brain switched on as she got to her feet, pulling Rio up with her and dragging her to the sidewalk.<br/>
</p><p>The motorbike shot down the road soon after.<br/>
</p><p>The two women paused, staring at each other with furrowed eyebrows before they burst out laughing again. Almost getting run over because you got caught up in your wife’s eyes would be an interesting way to go.<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna stick to the sidewalk from now on?” Agatha suggested.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Where’s the fun in that?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>They continued making their way towards their hotel. Still stumbling, still trying to keep each other quiet. They came up to a sign that indicated to the sea.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “We should go swimming!”<br/>
</p><p>“Now?” Agatha asked in alarm.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes…when else?”<br/>
</p><p>“This is true. Let us go.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cackled. Agatha wasn’t sure what possessed her to start talking like 15th-century British royalty, but it made her wife laugh so she didn’t question it.<br/>
</p><p>By the time the pair had made it down the many steep, jagged and slippery stairs that were most definitely a safety hazard. Agatha had the biggest bruise on her knee from where she’d fallen. For now, she didn’t care, too drunk to feel its effects.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was dragging her around the big boulder in the centre of the stone beach. Agatha didn’t know how she was moving so quickly; the stones were digging into her feet and if it weren’t for Rio she would be taking her sweet precious time walking over them.<br/>
</p><p>“Hurry up, Aggs!” Rio told her as she found them the perfect spot and started stripping off her dress.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “I’m coming!” She said as she took off her shoes.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe the fitted dress wasn’t a good idea. In her drunken state, she couldn’t begin to pull down the zip at the back of it.<br/>
</p><p>She felt Rio coming up behind her, felt her brush her hand against hers, felt her move her hair to one side, felt her begin to unzip her dress. Agatha tried to suppress the shudder that came with Rio’s tender touch.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s hand followed the other as she moved the zip down her back. Cool air hit Agatha’s exposed skin. She did actually shudder when Rio grazed her fingernails down her now mostly exposed back. Rio slid the straps of her dress along her arms until it pooled around her feet on the stones.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stepped out of it, turning to face her wife in the poorly lit night. The only light came from the full moon and the streetlights on the mountainside above.<br/>
</p><p>She drew her wife into her by her waist, letting her hand rest half on her underwear, half on her bare skin.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stuck her tongue in her cheek before rolling it around to the front of her mouth in front of her bottom teeth.<br/>
</p><p>It was like there was static in the air from how charged this moment felt. It was as if the moment Agatha pressed her lips against Rio’s lightning bolts would shoot from the sky.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stepped closer towards her; her breath hot on Agatha’s face when she said:<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll race you,” before darting away from her.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha called after her. “No fair! You distracted me!” She said as she chased Rio down the beach.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was waist-deep into the water before Agatha got there. She took a calculated (well for her drunken mind) risk when leaping towards Rio and crashing their bodies into the water.<br/>
</p><p>They tumbled around in the sea, arms and legs pushing at the other to keep them underneath as they fought to get to the surface first.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha won.<br/>
</p><p>She let Rio up soon after.<br/>
</p><p>“You bitch,” Rio said, splashing water at her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “You shouldn’t have cheated.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio started circling her. “I don’t think you can call it cheating.”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, I-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio disappeared underneath the surface before Agatha could get her rebuttal out.<br/>
</p><p>Seconds later, Agatha was being dragged beneath the waves as her wife tugged at her feet. She let out a yelp before the sound got cut off.<br/>
</p><p>“You trying to off me like a shark?” Agatha asked once they re-emerged.<br/>
</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Another reason why I would want to move to Australia.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s laugh joined hers before she dove into the water again. It was warm, and although she couldn’t see them, she could feel the fish swimming around her…or maybe that was just Rio.<br/>
</p><p>They spent the next god knows how long splashing each other with seawater and trying to see who could hold the other down for the longest because of course, with everything Agatha and Rio did, it turned into a competition.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s head popped out of the water next to Agatha, she pushed her hair out of her face before spraying Agatha in the face with water she shot out her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha landed a harsh slap to the water by Rio’s face, drenching her in it.<br/>
</p><p>“Eugh!” She grimaced as she wiped her face. “Do you know how many germs are in the ocean?”<br/>
</p><p>“The sea,” Rio corrected.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha deadpanned and Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>For the first time since being on the beach, she reached for her wife gently by the waist. In no time at all, Rio snatched Agatha up and propped her on her hips. They bobbed up and down as Rio tread water, Agatha’s arms wrapped around Rio’s neck as they held eye contact.<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked so beautiful with her hair soaked and her mascara slightly runny under her eyes. Agatha stroked her hair behind Rio’s ear as she became hypnotized by her wife’s gaze.<br/>
</p><p>She let herself snap out of it to dip her head down and kiss her. There wasn’t any tongue or fire, it was tender, sweet even.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wondered why it had taken her all evening to do so.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled back with a smile on her face.<br/>
</p><p>The bell from the cathedral in the heart of Portofino rang out signalling the new day. Agatha looked back at Rio from where she’d momentarily taken her eyes off her to locate the sound.<br/>
</p><p>She smiled. “Happy birthday, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked at her, a slight furrow in her brow. “How did you…?” she trailed off. “Thank you,” she whispered before pressing her lips to Agatha’s.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Agatha replied against them.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s legs felt like jelly. Whether that was because of the drunken walk back up the steep mountainside or the tight coil in her stomach from having her wife’s tongue down her throat she wasn’t sure. It was probably both.<br/>
</p><p>Her hair was wet, her clothes stuck to her body and her mascara was ruined. She told Agatha she needed a bath as they had begun to make their way up the mountain. Stupid. She didn’t want a fucking bath she wanted her fucking wife.<br/>
</p><p>Now Rio sat on the edge of the bathtub running her fingers through the warm water regretting her entire life while her wife moved around in the next room.<br/>
</p><p>She could ask her to join her? Yeah, that seemed like a good idea.<br/>
</p><p>She made her way into the bedroom to do just that.<br/>
</p><p>Every thought Rio ever had left Rio’s mind as she set eyes on Agatha. To anyone else Agatha would look the same, but to Rio…<br/>
</p><p>Now in the brighter lights of the dim bedside table lamps, Agatha glowed. Her hair still wet sat in loose curls that stopped just below her waist, her usually pale skin had gotten some colour in the Italian sun and her cheeks were slightly pink from sunburn.<br/>
</p><p>She looked…Rio couldn’t find the words.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked up from where she was fishing around for something in her suitcase.<br/>
</p><p>“You, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio tried to swallow what little saliva was in her mouth. It was bone dry due to the salt water and her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” her voice hoarse.<br/>
</p><p>The water from the running bath filled the short silence as the two wives stared at each other.<br/>
</p><p>“How’s your bath going?” Agatha asked, meeting Rio where she stood before their open balcony door just in front of the bed.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s going,” Rio heard herself reply.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s good.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio tried to channel the confidence she had found the first time she’d kissed her wife to ask her…hold on…what had she come to ask?<br/>
</p><p>She channelled the confidence just the same, stepping into her wife’s space and closing the distance between them.<br/>
</p><p>She tugged at Agatha’s dress and the two straps on her right shoulder fell just as they had the first time Rio pulled at it. Her eyes flicked up to Agatha’s again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded to the bathroom. “You should probably go check on your bath.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, I probably should.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t move a muscle.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha placed a hand on Rio’s waist and pulled her closer. “You wouldn’t want to flood our hotel room.”<br/>
</p><p>“No, I wouldn’t.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t take her eyes off Agatha’s.<br/>
</p><p>A sly smile spread across Agatha’s lips as she lifted Rio’s chin with her index finger.<br/>
</p><p>Rio forced her body to still as Agatha brought her lips to hers. The kiss was soft, tender, like the first one Agatha gave her on the beach.<br/>
</p><p>And then it grew claws.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s tongue pressed into Rio’s mouth without warning forcing her lips open. The index finger holding her in place withdrew and was replaced with a firm hand that rested at the base of her neck. Agatha’s other hand on her waist dropped to palm her ass, bunching up the ends of her damp dress as she did so.<br/>
</p><p>An involuntary gasp escaped Rio’s lips before the sound was swallowed by Agatha’s.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wasted no time in ridding Rio of her dress. From where her hand cupped her ass, she pulled up the bunched material in her hand and lifted it over Rio’s head in one swift movement.<br/>
</p><p>The hand on Rio’s neck tightened to angle her head up. A cool breeze hit her exposed neck courtesy of their open balcony door before Agatha’s lips quickly replaced it. Rio genuinely didn’t know how she was still standing as her wife pressed hot kisses into her skin and sucked on her pulse point.<br/>
</p><p>Her heart was beating at a million times per hour, and she was sure her body couldn’t tell the difference between running for her life and having Agatha on her body. The adrenaline was just the same.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s kisses trailed down to her collarbone; Rio felt the graze of her wife’s teeth on her shoulder until she realised, she was using her teeth to slide her bra strap down her shoulder.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<em> Why was that the hottest thing Rio had ever seen?<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>To Rio’s dismay, Agatha stopped kissing her, but only to remove her wet bra entirely. The other woman took a step back, her fierce gaze softening. Her eyes wandered over Rio’s body, taking her in as she stood before her in her dark green lace underwear.<br/>
</p><p>“Eres tan hermosa.” <em>You are so beautiful.<em> Agatha breathed. She nodded as if it were the only truth in the world.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>For some reason, her words made Rio self-conscious. She instinctively wrapped her arms around her body to cover herself.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s gaze hardened once more. She closed the space between them and tugged Rio’s arms from where they shielded herself.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d I just say?” Her voice was low, challenging.<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed. “That I’m beautiful.”<br/>
</p><p>“Exactly. Don’t go getting all shy on me now.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was sure she would’ve laughed if Agatha didn’t look like <em>that.<em> She looked the way she had in the hotel room during the ski mission. Hunger in her eyes:<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Dark. Devastating.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wondered if she looked like that. She doubted it. She probably looked like a mortal before a god:<br/>
</p><p>Powerless. Devoted.<br/>
</p><p>She was aware she probably <em>shouldn’t<em> look like that. Agatha didn’t need to know how easily she was willing to give herself over to her. With everything Rio did, she had to challenge her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>So…she did just that.<br/>
</p><p>“Momentary blip,” Rio said, reaching out to grab one of Agatha’s hands that were no longer on her body.<br/>
</p><p>She placed the other woman’s hand on her neck before using her own to begin guiding it down her body. Her gaze never shifted from Agatha’s as Rio left her wife’s hand to sit on her left breast, her hand on top of it.<br/>
</p><p>A slow smile slid onto Agatha’s lips as she watched Rio for a long, <em>long<em> time. Rio’s breath hitched in anticipation. The other woman wasn’t moving, applying pressure and the lack of it was going to send Rio into an early grave.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She realised her wife wanted to torment her, make her wait, drag this out. And Rio had to force down a frustrated whine.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t bear it. Her patience had run thin.<br/>
</p><p>Rio clamped down on her wife’s hand on her breast finally getting the pressure she was itching for. Her head fell back at the sensation before it was abruptly cut off. Agatha’s hand resisting against hers.<br/>
</p><p>“No!” Rio whined. “Do it again.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s head tilted and it was almost sinister. “Remember when I said I’d have my way with you?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breath caught and she had to steady it to get out a weak, “Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>“Then let me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips parted, she knew she should argue, should fight this, but as she said, she’d take anything Agatha would give her. And if that meant having to be in agony as her wife pushed her to her breaking point. She’d do it.<br/>
</p><p>She managed a nod.<br/>
</p><p>That smile returned as Agatha pushed her onto the bed next to them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio barely had time to prop herself onto her elbows before Agatha was on top of her, and without warning Agatha’s knee pressed into her core the same time her lips were on hers. A moan was forced from Rio’s lips at the sudden contact.<br/>
</p><p>The feeling of Agatha’s lips, Agatha’s tongue, Agatha’s knee felt so good she wanted to scream.<br/>
</p><p>Her hips lifted from the bed to find more pressure and as soon as she did the knee withdrew.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck<em>,” it was breathless and frustrated.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Take what I give you,” Agatha hissed in her ear.<br/>
</p><p>The woman was going to send her to a mental asylum.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was too worked up she couldn’t even muster a nod.<br/>
</p><p>“Words. Use them.” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sunk into the bed, another pathetic whine escaping her lips before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tucked her hair behind her ear. “<em>Good<em> girl,” she cooed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She rolled her eyes at the mocking praise.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted to kiss Agatha again, her entire body itched to do so, but she stilled in fear of the repercussions.<br/>
</p><p>The hand in her hair tightened as Agatha dragged her lips up to hers once more.<br/>
</p><p>As Agatha’s tongue explored her mouth, the hand in her hair slid from it to roam over Rio’s body. It played with her breasts, ran across her stomach, fiddled with the lace trim of her underwear.<br/>
</p><p>Rio took it back. There was a better feeling than a spider crawling up her arm. It was this. Her wife’s soft fingers <em>everywhere<em> (well, except the place she desperately wanted them) sending shivers up her spine.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>After however long of Agatha’s teasing, Rio was nearly brainless. All she could think about was the painful pleasure that sat tight and coiled in her heat.<br/>
</p><p>She’d been so good, she hadn’t tried to make a move just as Agatha had instructed her to, when was she going to get her reward?<br/>
</p><p>On accident, she knocked into the arm her wife was using to prop herself up. Agatha jolted and those fingers on her stomach slid to the middle of her underwear. She moaned at the contact.<br/>
</p><p>To her surprise, Agatha didn’t withdraw. Instead, cupping Rio over her underwear.<br/>
</p><p>The next moan that left Rio’s mouth would definitely be heard by anyone if they happened to be on their balcony at this hour.<br/>
</p><p>The look on Agatha’s face in reaction to the noise only made Rio want to do it again. It was smug, but not the type of smug that made Rio want to roll her eyes, it was pride, as if she knew she was the only person who could get Rio to sound like this.<br/>
</p><p>And Rio realised in that moment that that was undoubtedly true.<br/>
</p><p>“You look so pretty like this. So desperate for me to be inside you.”<br/>
</p><p>The words hardly registered. Rio was too focused on the pressure between her legs. Of how much it hurt, how much she’d always want to feel this type of pleasure.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha dipped her head down to kiss Rio’s neck again and the hand cupping Rio’s underwear slid the damp material to the side before pushing a light finger in.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s hips jerked up at the contact, her breath becoming strained as Agatha ran it up her folds before withdrawing again. But only momentarily before replacing the one finger with two.<br/>
</p><p>She gasped as Agatha started circling her entrance.<br/>
</p><p>She felt the wave of an orgasm wanting to crash through her already. She had to bite her lip to keep it at bay. She wasn’t ready for any of this to be over yet.<br/>
</p><p>Rio could see her own chest rise and fall as her wife continued to tease her. She didn’t know how she was still breathing let alone functioning.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut as the feeling became overwhelming.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha’s lips were no longer on her neck.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Look at me.”<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t.<br/>
</p><p>The fingers stilled and slid out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s face pinched from the withdrawal; from the tears she was sure she’d shed.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open.<br/>
</p><p>“Look at me?” Agatha’s tone was softer.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded weakly and Agatha’s fingers slid back inside.<br/>
</p><p>They ran up her entire core forcing Rio’s head to snap back in pleasure before they started pumping into her. Rio’s breaths came out fast and strained and desperate as her hips rode Agatha’s fingers.<br/>
</p><p>“Eyes on me, baby,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Somehow, Rio got her head up to lock onto Agatha’s eyes.<br/>
</p><p>"You make me feel like I'm losing my mind,” she got out through her shallow pants.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned as she finally, <em>finally<em> applied direct pressure to Rio’s swallow clit.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The sound that left Rio’s mouth ought to be considered shameful. She didn’t care. Her head rolled back in pleasure as Agatha pumped faster.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d I say?”<br/>
</p><p>In the haze of it all Rio found the strength to lift her head, her eyes meeting the deep blue of the ocean. It took everything in her not to let her eyes drift shut as Agatha’s eyes bore into her.<br/>
</p><p>It was almost too much, her beloved’s eyes on her face watching her fall apart. It was a type of vulnerability, intimacy that Rio had never experienced before. No wonder Agatha enjoyed sex so much if this was how she made people feel.<br/>
</p><p>All that power she wielded to get her partners to shatter and crumble. Wouldn’t you chase that feeling forever? Rio was sure she would.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched Agatha’s expression in return. Watched her eyes glisten with satisfied joy, watched her lips part, her own breaths audible at the pleasure she too was feeling.<br/>
</p><p>One heavy dragged-out run over her clit had Rio’s orgasm crashing through her. Her body pulled taunt, her head snapped back and an almost ear-shattering moan escaped Rio’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s fingers didn’t still as she fucked her through it.<br/>
</p><p>The fingers didn’t ease up until Rio lowered her body back to the bed and her breathing calmed down a little.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha withdrew and Rio flinched at the lack of contact. Her head snapping back to lock on to Agatha, Agatha who was still in her fucking clothes after picking Rio apart.<br/>
</p><p>As if in 0.5 speed, Agatha brought her now wet fingers up to her mouth, parted her lips and sucked on Rio’s slick. Rio swallowed what little saliva she had at the sight. She wanted it framed. No. Burned in her memory forever.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha moaned at the taste of Rio on her tongue. And again, all Rio could do was watch.<br/>
</p><p>Only once Agatha had sucked her fingers dry did she touch Rio again, moving her now even damper hair off her forehead to tuck it behind her ear.<br/>
</p><p>The events of the day (running for her life, the long drive, the drinking, the swimming, the fucking) had finally caught up to Rio. She felt sleep amongst the high of sex wanting to drag her under. Her body crumpled deep into the bed and her eyes began to flutter shut.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Get up. You’ve got to return the favour.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Just give me a sec,” Rio got out through her still shallow breaths. “And I can-”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you worry about me,” Agatha soothed.<br/>
</p><p>She felt covers being pulled over her, felt Agatha wrap her in an embrace, her arms circling her stomach.<br/>
</p><p>“It is your birthday after all.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio managed a smile. She felt sleep consuming her until a question popped into her head. In her delirious state, she found the confidence to ask it:<br/>
</p><p>“Why did you wait so long to have sex with me? Did I do something? Was it me?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” was Agatha’s soft reply.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breath caught again and not for good reason.<br/>
</p><p>“Sex means nothing to me until it does,” Agatha continued. “When I’m with the right person, there’s no need to rush it. There is nothing more intimate than being as close as physically possible with another human. I wanted to make sure you knew that what we have is more than just the physical stuff…you know…given my reputation.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled against her wife’s neck as Agatha drew her impossibly closer.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio hummed and Agatha pressed two kisses to her forehead.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was seconds away from sleep now, the soothing sounds of the breeze rustling their balcony door curtains, the drum of Agatha’s heartbeat, the rhythmic dripping of water hitting surfaces edging her on.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio sighed.<br/>
</p><p>“You never turned off the tap for your bath.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes shot open. “Fuck!”</p>

<p>Rio blinked slowly awake. The events of the night before slowly resurfacing.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife littering her entire body with kisses, her wife’s scent swirling around her as their bodies intertwined, her wife’s fingers <em>everywhere<em>. Rio flooding their hotel room, Rio trying to get up to clean up her mess and her wife not letting her telling her she’d sort it, Rio falling asleep to Agatha’s fingers running through her hair.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She smiled.<br/>
</p><p>She turned around to lay eyes on the other woman.<br/>
</p><p>Rio screamed.<br/>
</p><p>“Surprise!”<br/>
</p><p>“Alice?!” Rio shrieked. “What the fuck? What are you doing here?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice pulled a face at her from where she lay propped up by her elbow atop the covers. “Okay. And good morning to you too.”<br/>
</p><p>Instinctively, Rio pulled up the covers to her chin when she remembered she was naked apart from her underwear.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, relax. Nothing I haven’t seen before.”<br/>
</p><p>“Al?!”<br/>
</p><p>“Happy birthday, bitch! Thought you’d be more excited to see me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “I’m sure I would’ve been if you hadn’t fucking ambushed me in my fucking hotel bedroom.”<br/>
</p><p>“Woah, woah, woah. Ambushed is a strong word. I think you’re meant to say <em>surprised.”<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio deadpanned.<br/>
</p><p>Alice sighed. “Your wife told us she was taking you to Portofino for your birthday and told us to join you guys. What? You wish we hadn’t come.”<br/>
</p><p>A smile, although Rio didn’t want it to, twitched her lips. “No.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice smiled back. “Good.”<br/>
</p><p>She hugged Rio then, not caring that her friend was naked.<br/>
</p><p>“Thirty-three,” Alice said when she pulled back. “You’re getting old.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shoved her in the arm.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Alice clapped, getting off the bed. “We’ve got breakfast by the pool in half an hour.” She threw a shirt at Rio’s head. “So, get the fuck up, get ready and let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled as she pulled the shirt over her head.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Although it was only 10:30, it was boiling. The Italian sun shone hot and bright in the sky. Rio had opted for a red bikini, white linen shorts and a matching button-up cover-up. Alice was in a black bikini with denim shorts, her black and red streaked wolf-cut tied back in a messy ponytail.<br/>
</p><p>They walked to the table under an umbrella where their wives sat conversing, laughing. The table already had various fruits and drinks on it.<br/>
</p><p>“Good morning, sweetheart,” Agatha said as Rio pulled out her chair. “Happy birthday.”<br/>
</p><p>“Happy birthday, Rio,” Jen said.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio replied with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>She turned to look at Agatha and was met with her lips on hers. She laughed as she relaxed into it.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Jen scolded. “It’s ten in the morning let's cool it with the PDA.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flipped her off as she continued to kiss her wife.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled away with a smile, wiping at Agatha’s lips from where she’d gotten lip gloss on them.<br/>
</p><p>“How’d you sleep?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Good.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah?” Agatha replied with a knowing grin.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, real good. Best sleep I’ve had in ages.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha winked at her.<br/>
</p><p>“How was the flight?” Rio turned to Alice and Jen opposite them.<br/>
</p><p>“It was alright, we were only in France.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mission?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Jen hummed, popping a grape in her mouth. “Had to chase down some wanted fugitive.”<br/>
</p><p>“How’d it go?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>Alice and Jen exchanged irritated glances.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s just say…things didn’t go as planned,” Alice shivered at the thought.<br/>
</p><p>“I’d like to forget about it actually,” Jen said, gulping down her mimosa.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve come to the right place,” Agatha replied, pointing her champagne glass at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, Riri. Plan for today?” Alice asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes playfully at her childhood nickname. She hadn’t heard it in years.<br/>
</p><p>What had Rio wanted to do today? She’d thought about going to Portofino for years, sure, but when she imagined herself going it wasn’t like this. It wasn’t with a beautiful wife who had surprised her with the trip for her birthday, her ex best friend and <em>her<em> wife certainly weren’t there and she was sure she’d be going broke, the flight taking up all her expenses. So now? Now she couldn’t remember for the life of her what she’d always wanted to do.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Erm…”<br/>
</p><p>Okay, maybe that was a lie. She wanted to spend the day tangled in bedsheets whilst her wife fucked her into oblivion. But she couldn’t do that, not with Alice here.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I think about it?”<br/>
</p><p>“You can do whatever you want,” Agatha smiled. And somehow Rio knew she meant it. That anything Rio wanted today, Agatha would bend over backwards just to give it to her.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>They’d ended up on a yacht two hours later. Rio had made a passing comment on how she’d liked the look of one of them she saw on the way to dinner last night and Agatha had called up the yachting company and got them on it. Even though it had already been booked out for the day. It was Rio’s birthday, nothing as inconvenient as a yacht being rented out already was going to stop Agatha from giving Rio exactly what she wanted.<br/>
</p><p>She was almost scared she was smothering her. It didn’t happen often (it had only happened twice actually), Agatha falling for someone, but when she did, she fell <em>hard<em>. She’d give them the moon if they asked. That’s why the Wanda situation had fucked her up so badly. They’d been together for so long, she swore they had been so in love, and then Wanda did what she did.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha told herself she was done with it, love. She never wanted to feel so out of control and hopeless ever again. But Rio was Rio and Agatha thought that if she had met her even at the worst points in her life, before she even realised, she was capable of love, she would’ve fallen for her.<br/>
</p><p>It felt so inevitable. Fate…if you will.<br/>
</p><p>Last night had been a dream that she never wanted to wake up from. She’d forced herself to appear confident, in charge like she usually felt whilst having sex. In truth, she was <em>nervous<em>. And no, she would never admit that to a soul on earth. Rio always made her feel nervous, the control she usually found when sex was involved was a façade with her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She wanted to do everything right somehow not trusting her own (outstanding by the way) abilities to make her partners feel every drop of pleasure she could get out of them. She’d hoped she’d succeeded.<br/>
</p><p>Now far too many mimosas deep the four women were sat at the back of the yacht on comfy white sofas, shoes off, sunglasses on, more champagne glasses in hand as the boat glided across the water.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha watched the other women laugh next to her. She missed this already; she knew she’d look back at this moment tomorrow with this same insight. That she wished she could’ve stayed here, that this was the happiest she’d been in a long time.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t know if it was the alcohol, but when Rio started running her thumb back and forth along the inside of her upper arm, it made her entire body pulse with want. In fact, Rio touching her in any way today made her entire body pulse. Her fingers had brushed against Agatha’s as she took the room key from her hand earlier and Agatha had to stop herself from pouncing on her right then and there.<br/>
</p><p>She’d thought the feeling would go away. It didn’t. The more she drank the worse it got. Maybe that was a sign for her to stop drinking.<br/>
</p><p>When she’d been silently reflecting, not engaging in the conversation because she was so wrapped up in the moment, now turned in to not being able to speak because she couldn’t form coherent sentences.<br/>
</p><p>All she could think about was how much she <em>wanted<em> Rio.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>I really need to kiss her, to touch her, to be inside her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Those three thoughts on a constant loop in her head.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was so fucked.<br/>
</p><p>“…Aggs?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked, by the look on Jen’s face this had not been the first time she’d said her name.<br/>
</p><p>She swallowed. “Yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>“Where’d you just go?” Rio asked, her brows knitted in concern.<br/>
</p><p>“Nowhere,” she laughed. “I’m just drunk.”<br/>
</p><p>Lazy smiles painted each of the women’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Cheers to that,” Alice said, raising her glass.<br/>
</p><p>The sound of clinking filled the deck as the women brought their glasses together.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, come on,” Rio said once she’d set her glass down. Her hand outstretched for Agatha to take.<br/>
</p><p>“Where we going?”<br/>
</p><p>“I need to pee.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ew,” Alice teased. “Are you guys one of those annoying couples that are always attached to the hip?”<br/>
</p><p>“Today we are. I need her like I need oxygen, Alice. I can’t <em>breathe<em> without her,” Rio said dramatically, tossing her head back and fanning herself.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Alice kicked at her playfully.<br/>
</p><p>“Get out of here,” Jen laughed, throwing a pillow at them as they made their way through the sliding doors.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha kept blinking to keep herself steady. She was glad for the air-conditioning. It was helping her stay grounded. Helping her think about anything else but Rio’s warm hand in hers, about how she could feel Rio’s pulse through her fingertips as they pressed into her hand, about how Rio’s thumb kept stroking her skin.<br/>
</p><p>They smiled and exchanged small greetings with the yacht crew, reassuring them everything was fine they just needed the restroom.<br/>
</p><p>They cautiously made their way downstairs to the bathroom. The yacht kept rocking, slamming them into the walls. Rio was laughing and Agatha was sure she would be too if she could get her brain off the thoughts that were on loop.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pushed open the bathroom door and Agatha lost all self-control. She grabbed Rio and pushed her against the door before crashing their lips together.<br/>
</p><p>She’d never get bored of the sensation that shot through her whenever Rio’s lips were on hers. They were so soft, so wet, and today, sticky from the lip gloss her wife kept applying. When Agatha finally pulled back, said lip gloss was ruined, the deep pink liquid spread across Rio’s lower face.<br/>
</p><p>She looked ruined already and Agatha hadn’t even <em>done<em> anything yet.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Let me taste you,” Rio panted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked. She hadn’t thought about being touched once today; all she wanted to do was touch Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“I…” she started. “Wait no. It’s your birthday.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio flipped them so now Agatha was pressed against the wall. “And what I want,” Rio started lowering herself to the ground. “Is to taste you.”<br/>
</p><p>Her hands were on the thin straps keeping Agatha’s purple bikini bottoms in place. Rio was on her knees now, looking up at her with…what was that?<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t necessarily hunger, more devotion. She felt as if Rio wanted to give her <em>everything.<em> The same way Agatha wanted to give Rio everything.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>…Or maybe she was just drunk.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded and a mischievous grin spread across Rio's lips.<br/>
</p><p>Without warning she yanked off Agatha’s bikini, pushed her legs open and dove in.<br/>
</p><p>A strangled gasp left Agatha’s mouth as Rio’s tongue made contact with her centre. She arched her back off the door and Rio pushed her back with a forceful hand. She hit the door with a thud.<br/>
</p><p>With a flat tongue, Rio ran it across her entire core like she was licking fucking ice-cream. It sounded like she was too with the way she moaned in pleasure. As if Agatha tasted sweet and creamy like the dessert did.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was glad for the hand keeping her in place. She was sure she would’ve fallen to the floor otherwise.<br/>
</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut; head pressed hard against the wall as the pleasure ripped through her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s strokes were long and slow. It was like she was savouring the taste of her.<br/>
</p><p>The next moan that left Agatha’s lips surprised even herself with the volume of it. Rio rolled her tongue around her clit before she started gently sucking. Agatha’s hands flew to Rio’s hair immediately. She needed something to hold on to. To ground her to this plane as Rio was trying her hardest to take her out of it.<br/>
</p><p>She felt Rio’s free hand trail up her inner thigh before it joined Rio’s tongue. It replaced Rio sucking her clit, her thumb instead applying the pressure as Rio’s tongue continued to work through her folds as Agatha rode her face.<br/>
</p><p>She came soon after. The hand holding her in place loosing as she practically levitated off the door.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s hand pulled away, but her tongue kept going and didn’t stop until Agatha’s pants softened.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck,<em>” Agatha murmured in the haze of it all.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio wasn’t done, cleaning up her mess with her tongue. Agatha felt it travel up her inner thighs and dart back inside her core.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha could see her full face again, Rio had a shit-eating grin on her glistening mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“Next time,” Rio said, her tongue licking Agatha’s slick off her lips. “I want to hear you. You weren’t loud enough for my liking.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You wanted the yacht crew to hear us? I was trying to be considerate.”<br/>
</p><p>“I want everyone to hear how good I can get you to sound.”<br/>
</p><p>A challenging smile spread across Agatha’s lips then. “Okay.” She pulled Rio to stand. “Your turn then.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t get the chance to reply. Agatha flipped them once more, pressing her wife against the door and wasting no time dipping a finger into Rio’s bikini bottoms, pressing a finger into her entrance.<br/>
</p><p>She groaned at the feeling. “This all for me?” She teased, as Agatha met no resistance.<br/>
</p><p>“Who-” Rio cut herself off when Agatha added another finger. “Who else would it be for?” Rio whimpered.<br/>
</p><p>“No, you’re right, baby,” Agatha replied, running the fingers easily through Rio’s folds. “Because you wouldn’t let anyone else touch you like this would you?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head as her body shuddered. “Never again,” Rio said through pants.<br/>
</p><p>She might as well have just told Agatha her mother had died. It was music to Agatha’s ears.<br/>
</p><p>“You mean that?” Agatha said, adding a third finger.<br/>
</p><p>Somehow, she knew Rio did, she just wanted her to say it again.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve never meant anything…” Rio jolted as Agatha’s fingers sunk knuckles deep. “…more.”<br/>
</p><p>The smile that painted Agatha’s lips was one she was sure she’d never worn before.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s walls clenched around her fingers, her slick seeping onto her knuckles, the action showing just how much she meant what she’d said.<br/>
</p><p>And oh, Agatha couldn’t name a better feeling. She felt like saying something stupid like she loved Rio or something, but she gained control of her thoughts and focused on the task at hand.<br/>
</p><p>“I wanna hear you,” Agatha said as Rio started grinding down on her fingers.<br/>
</p><p>It was as if Agatha had let floodgates open.<br/>
</p><p>Rio started moaning immediately. The sounds unchecked and senseless as if she’d given up control over them. As if she were vocalising how good her body felt.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha thought she might come all over again from the sounds Rio was making alone.<br/>
</p><p>She picked up her pace, her fingers pumping into Rio fast and hard. Rio kept up, her grinding matching the rhythm.<br/>
</p><p>“Jesus, you feel so good,” Agatha got out. She doubted Rio could even hear her over her own sounds.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help herself. She leaned in and kissed Rio, stealing the breath from her lungs. She felt Rio’s walls flutter around her soon after. She drew back to allow Rio to vocalise the effects of her orgasm.<br/>
</p><p>The sound came out as high-pitched desperate whimpers and she swore there was no better sound in the world.<br/>
</p><p>Rio slung her arms lazily around Agatha’s neck, letting Agatha fuck out every last aftershock out of her system.<br/>
</p><p>With her fingers still inside Rio she let her free arm wrap around her back, holding tightly against her body, resting her chin on her shoulder. Rio’s scent wafted up her nose and she felt a new wetness in between her legs.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Seriously? We just fucked!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>They couldn’t go again; they’d already been gone far longer than was considered polite.<br/>
</p><p>“The yacht crew definitely heard you,” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>She could hear the smile in Rio’s voice when she said, “Good.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed withdrawing her fingers. She felt the flinch that always came whenever she withdrew from Rio so hugged her tighter.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay, my love?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s body jolted again at the sound of the pet name.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, mi amor,” came the reply. “Are you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Never better,” she smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled back then until Rio’s face came into view. She tucked Rio’s hair behind her ear before pulling her in to place a gentle kiss on her lips.<br/>
</p><p>Ten minutes later, the two wives returned to the back of the ship. Hands washed, makeup fixed, hair…hair as good as they could get it.<br/>
</p><p>“You guys have fun?” Alice teased.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Rio nodded. “Lots of it.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice and Jen exchanged confused glances until the realisation hit.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you two fucking serious?”<br/>
</p><p>“On a fucking boat?” Alice and Jen said simultaneously.<br/>
</p><p>The wives sat down with a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snuggled up against Jen to irritate her further.<br/>
</p><p>“Get the fuck away from me, I know where you’ve been.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed again.</p>

<p>This had genuinely been one of the best birthdays Rio had ever had. It was definitely in the top two. She couldn’t decide between this one and her fifteenth where her Abuela had saved up enough money to take her and Alice to a deadly plant exhibition in the city, bought them dollar pizzas from a pizza place and surprised her with a huge tray of Tres leches when they’d gotten home.<br/>
</p><p>They’d spent most of the day on the yacht. The yacht crew had set up a slide that went into the water, a water trampoline and various water toys. They’d also brought out the jet skis where they’d challenged each other to races. Rio won against Agatha, lost against Alice, and Jen refused to get on again when Alice went so fast, she fell off into the water.<br/>
</p><p>Now she and Agatha were getting ready for dinner and waiting for Nicky to call. He had wanted to wish Rio happy birthday the second he woke up, but Agatha decided to wait until they had sobered up. They were in no condition to be talking to a five-year-old.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was sitting on the bed whilst Agatha was in the bathroom after kicking her out. Agatha told her she was too distracting as at any given moment Rio would kiss her. It’d only be a peck at first and then it would grow into something far more intense. Hands would start wandering and the next thing they knew both of their makeup was ruined and they’d have to do it all over again.<br/>
</p><p>This happened three times before Agatha found the strength to tell Rio to leave otherwise, they’d be late for dinner.<br/>
</p><p>She heard her wife’s voice from the bathroom, light and cheery like it always was when she spoke to Nicky. Agatha emerged soon after.<br/>
</p><p>“Someone wants to talk to you,” Agatha smiled, turning her phone so that Rio saw those big brown eyes and gappy smile.<br/>
</p><p>“Feliz cumpleaños, Rio!” Nicky squealed when Agatha gave her the phone.<br/>
</p><p>“Muchas gracias, Nicholas,” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>“How old are you now?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha mouthed that she was going back to the bathroom and Rio nodded in acknowledgement.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m thirty-three!”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re old,” Nicky giggled.<br/>
</p><p>“I know. I’m going to have to spend more time with you to give me my youth back.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky giggled once more. “Did you have a good day?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, I did thank you,” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I come to Italy too next time?” Nicky asked.<br/>
</p><p>“You better! I wish you were here,” Rio told him.<br/>
</p><p>And she realised she meant it. Agatha always came to life whenever Nicky was around. To have that around her on her birthday every year would be the only present Rio would ever need. She also wanted Nicky around for herself too. Rio thought it was too soon to say that she loved him, but she was fond of him.<br/>
</p><p>He had this light about him that she thought would work on her even on her darkest days.<br/>
</p><p>“I miss you, Riro,” Nicky said.<br/>
</p><p>She laughed at the nickname he’d accidentally given her and had stuck. She was teaching him how to say red in Spanish and he’d gone to say her name and gotten it mixed up with the colour, merging the two words together.<br/>
</p><p>“I miss you-”<br/>
</p><p>A voice she’d never heard before cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>“Nicholas? Who are you talking to?”<br/>
</p><p>“Riro…Rio,” Nicky corrected. “It’s her birthday!”<br/>
</p><p>The phone turned and two ice blue eyes locked on to her. They were supposed to look like Agatha’s, but they didn’t. Where Agatha’s eyes sparked regardless of the depth of them, these eyes were void of anything. They appeared muted, no, dull. That was the best way Rio could think to describe them.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh. So, <em>this<em> is her,” Evanora said, locking onto someone across the room that Rio could only assume to be Wanda.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Could I have the phone please, Nicholas? I want to wish Rio happy birthday.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky didn’t say anything just handed the phone to his grandmother.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you, dear,” Evanora replied. “Go into the other room would you please?”<br/>
</p><p>“But Grandma!” Nicky protested.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched Evanora tilt her head, her eyes burning into the little boy behind the screen. It made the hairs on Rio’s arms stand up. She couldn’t even imagine what it was doing to Nicky. She heard rustling on the other end, Nicky getting up to leave.<br/>
</p><p>Rio heard a soft thud of a door closing, and Evanora’s eyes returned to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re a pretty little thing aren’t you, dear,” Evanora smiled. It was an empty one and the compliment didn’t seem like a compliment. “Not as pretty as my Wanda here, but you’ll do.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I’ll do? What the ever living fuck does that even mean?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha had never gone into detail about her relationship with her mother. Rio only knew they didn’t get along and she’d had to figure that out on her own.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wasn’t going to bother with niceties. She wasn’t going to say thank you for a compliment that was disguised as something else, so she simply stared at the old woman on the phone.<br/>
</p><p>“Has my daughter been looking after you on your special day?” Evanora continued.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio replied bluntly.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, I bet. A poor girl like you loves to take advantage of the filthy rich.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew she was being baited, and she wouldn’t rise to it.<br/>
</p><p>“Could you put Nicky back on the phone, please?” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora ignored her. “Tell me, what lies have you fed her to trap her like this? It isn’t like you have much to offer. You come from nothing, your mother and grandmother are dead, and your father left you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped. How did she even know that?<br/>
</p><p>She wanted to shrink into herself. She knew this was what Evanora wanted, to make her feel as small as a grain of rice. And Rio hated that it was working because what <em>did<em> she have to offer to Agatha? </em></em></p><p>Nothing. She had absolutely fucking nothing.<br/>
</p><p>“I…”<br/>
</p><p>Evanora’s lips curled into a cruel smile. She already knew she’d won.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing?” Agatha shouted as she snatched the phone from Rio. “Don’t you ever fucking speak a word to her, don’t even look at her!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio heard the old crone cackle on the other end.<br/>
</p><p>“My darling daughter, just as naïve as ever. You really think <em>she<em> wants you? Coming to her defence as if anyone would do the same for you. No, darling. She wants you for your money, for what she can get out of you because you’ll never be more than a vile little slut-”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Evanora got cut off when Rio pressed the end call button, the room plunging into silence.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her now blank phone screen and Rio stared at her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>This<em> was the type of thing Agatha had been putting up with her entire life? Guilt edged its way into Rio’s self-doubt. Agatha had told her; her upbringing wasn’t as perfect as the photos made it out to be and Rio had thought she’d only been saying that to make Rio feel better. Or she was making it out to be worse than it was when in fact she’d been undermining it entirely.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Her mother had spoken a few sentences to her wife, and she’d said that. Rio couldn’t imagine what a whole conversation would be like, Agatha’s whole life would’ve been like. Rio only had her Abuela growing up and she’d felt more love than she thought humanly possible. Did Agatha even know what it was like to feel truly loved by a parental figure? She’d never spoken about her relationship with her father.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs…” Rio started and then stopped.<br/>
</p><p>Words wouldn’t work.<br/>
</p><p>She got up from the bed and tugged her wife into her arms, squeezing her tightly and hoping Agatha could <em>feel<em> just how much Rio appreciated her from the act alone.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“It isn’t true,” Rio told her, rubbing circles on her wife’s back. “Nothing she said is true.”<br/>
</p><p>“What did she say to you?” Was Agatha’s sharp reply.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing that matters,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>She’d work through her own feelings of worthlessness later. Right now, she only wanted to be there for her wife as it was apparent no one else had been.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled back. “No. Tell me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio sighed. “Agatha-”<br/>
</p><p>The other woman cut her off. “Tell. Me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio ran her hand through her hair. What good would this do them? But there was no point arguing about it, it was clear Agatha wouldn’t let this go.<br/>
</p><p>“She basically just said that I was nothing. That I didn’t have anything to offer you.” Rio hated the words on her tongue.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked as if she were fighting off tears. Wordlessly, she turned around and headed towards the door.<br/>
</p><p>She was running, just like she told Rio she always did.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt tears in her own eyes. Was that it? She thought they weren’t doing that anymore. The door opened and closed, and Agatha was gone, leaving Rio alone.<br/>
</p><p>She flopped back onto the bed, tears streaming down her face. She wiped at them fiercely. No. No, she wasn’t going to cry about this. So, what her wife had left her, would rather run than talk to her, would rather force them to deal with this on their own instead of together like they’d promised they’d do.<br/>
</p><p>More tears fell.<br/>
</p><p>Rio really didn’t have anything to offer her because that’s why Agatha had left right? There was no other explanation for it. Her mother’s words had opened her eyes and now Agatha saw her.<br/>
</p><p>A nobody with nothing to offer anyone.<br/>
</p><p>Fuck, how had Rio been this stupid to think she could be anything more? This is why she never let anyone get close to her, this is why she detached because sooner or later they would see Rio for who she really was.<br/>
</p><p>Why would Agatha be any different?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>But she was supposed to be.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>A sob floated out of Rio’s lips, and she clamped her hand around her mouth to stifle it. And then she removed it because who the fuck cared. She was crying on her birthday, and her wife had smashed her heart in two. She was allowed to fucking cry and be loud about it.<br/>
</p><p>Rio jumped when she felt hands on her. She blinked and saw Agatha in her blurry vision. She must’ve missed the door opening because of how loud she’d been.<br/>
</p><p>“Sweetheart?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to fucking smack her. How dare she just fucking leave and then <em>sweetheart<em> her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio sat up, pushing Agatha’s hands off her body. “Don’t fucking touch me or I’ll-”<br/>
</p><p>“No, listen to me,” Agatha cut her off. “You aren’t nothing, never to me I told you that. You’ve given me <em>everything.<em> I can’t even put into words how much you’ve done for me in what…two months and a bit.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio glared at her, tears still streaking her face.<br/>
</p><p>“I shouldn’t have left like that I know, but I had to get this to prove it to you and it was in Jen and Alice’s room.”<br/>
</p><p>It was only then Rio noticed the red velvet box in Agatha’s hand.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife opened it and a gold band with an emerald in the centre shone back at her. Little ferns had been engraved around the rest of the ring.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s to replace that,” Agatha nodded to the plain ring that decorated Rio’s ring finger. “You deserve better than that.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked at her. She was so fucking confused she thought she might pass out. So…her wife wasn’t running away she was just getting a ring…and her wife didn’t think she was nobody…and she shouldn’t be angry at her…?<br/>
</p><p>“Rio?”<br/>
</p><p>Her mouth opened and closed. “I…” She looked back at the ring, then back at Agatha kneeling on the floor holding the ring. “Don’t you ever fucking do that again!”<br/>
</p><p>That probably wasn’t the right thing to say but Agatha smiled, nonetheless.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head, bringing Rio’s hand to her lips and kissing the knuckles.<br/>
</p><p>“May I?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha slid off the old ring and replaced it with the new one. “Fits like a glove,” Agatha commented.<br/>
</p><p>It did and Rio loved it, but she wasn’t going to give Agatha the satisfaction just yet after the stunt she’d just pulled.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to fix my makeup,” Rio said, getting up and heading towards the bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The four wives were at dinner in the hotel restaurant. The view was to die for. A pink and orange sunset cast the perfect backdrop on the colourful buildings of Portofino. The sea glistening just below.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was still angry at Agatha, but she was holding her hand underneath the table, and that was good enough for her.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s see it then,” Alice said.<br/>
</p><p>Rio lifted her hand and Alice took it from across the table. She nodded her approval.<br/>
</p><p>“Came out way better than I thought it would. This one wouldn’t stop nagging me to make sure she’d done it right,” she nodded at Agatha. “You like it?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes…love it actually,” Rio begrudgingly admitted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “First time I’m hearing it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shot her a look and Agatha stifled a laugh. She was in no position to be teasing Rio right now.<br/>
</p><p>“When are you going to replace my ring?” Jen glared at Alice. “We’ve been together longer than them and my best friend beat you to it?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice sighed. “Was the necklace I gave you not good enough?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha caught sight of the gold necklace with a small ‘A’ pendant hanging off Jen’s neck.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Jen snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“When was the last time you ate?” Alice asked, her hand coming up to rub Jen’s arm.<br/>
</p><p>Jen pulled a face at her. “You think just because I haven’t eaten that’s why I’m-”<br/>
</p><p>She cut herself off when Alice gave her a pointed look.<br/>
</p><p>“This morning,” Jen mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Alice smiled knowingly. “I’m going to get you some nuts from the bar and ask the waiter to hurry up with our food. You guys want anything?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Rio shook their heads.<br/>
</p><p>Alice gave Jen a quick kiss on the cheek before heading off towards the bar.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. She was happy that Jen had found someone who understood her.<br/>
</p><p>She looked to Rio then who had started up a conversation with Jen about how much of a pain in the ass their wives were.<br/>
</p><p>Agathe hoped Rio knew how much she understood her; how much she saw her. She wasn’t sure if the words were enough, she’d already told Rio she would always be someone in her eyes and a five-minute conversation with her mother had ruined that.<br/>
</p><p>She’d seen it in Rio’s eyes how much she believed what her mother had told her when she’d asked what she’d said back in the room. And Agatha didn’t know what else she could do to prove it to her. Was the ring enough? She’d only found out a minute ago that she actually liked it.<br/>
</p><p>But Agatha understood. It had taken her years to realise that her mother’s words weren’t true and even then, it was hard to tell sometimes. Rio had been exposed to it for the first time today and Agatha vowed she’d never let Rio hear something like that again.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Belly’s full and three bottles of wine deep, all tension from the beginning of the evening had faded away. Rio was pressed against Agatha next to her, and Jen was holding hands with Alice across the table.<br/>
</p><p>“No, I’m telling you we would all be dead,” Jen laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Alice wiped at her eyes. “No, you’d all be dead, they’d never suspect me. I’m quiet as a mouse unless I’m around people I know.”<br/>
</p><p>“What about me?” Rio protested.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re quiet but you’re freaky, Ri,” Alice replied. “You look like you do blood magic in your spare time, the witch hunters of Salem would sniff you out before you knew it.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m gonna have to agree on that one,” Agatha laughed. “You would not survive the witch trials.”<br/>
</p><p>“And neither would you,” Rio shot back. “You’re too smart for your own good and you could never keep your mouth shut.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha put a hand to her heart and feigned offence. “I <em>could<em> keep my mouth shut if I really wanted to.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio and Jen shot her looks as if to say, ‘Be serious.’<br/>
</p><p>“What!”<br/>
</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “Just shut the fuck up.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cackled.<br/>
</p><p>“You wouldn’t want me to keep my mouth shut anyway,” Agatha said to Rio who blushed.<br/>
</p><p>Jen and Alice groaned.<br/>
</p><p>“Can you not.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s every day,” they said at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“Anyway, Jen. You’re not surviving either,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, and I have the decency to admit that unlike one of us.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flipped her off. She clapped her hands together. “Right, I’m going to the toilet.”<br/>
</p><p>“Alright,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow. “You’re not going with her?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nah, she’s still in timeout for a stunt she pulled earlier.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen perked up at that. “What’d she do earlier?”<br/>
</p><p>“None,” Agatha threw a breadstick at her. “Of your business.”<br/>
</p><p>“Well now you have to tell me,” Jen told Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha heard her wife laugh as she walked away from the table.<br/>
</p><p>Once she’d gotten to the toilet, she sat down (not having the energy to stoop because of how drunk she was) and emptied herself into the toilet bowl.<br/>
</p><p>Her phone buzzed. Agatha clicked it on.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Hihi, Mrs &amp; Mrs Smith. You are-<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha clicked her phone off and groaned. Seriously? So much for getting four uninterrupted days off.<br/>
</p><p>Her phone buzzed once more, and Agatha was just about ready to throw it down the toilet. She turned it on again ready to see another message from Hihi.<br/>
</p><p>It wasn’t Hihi.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Unknown number: Get rid of her or they’ll kill her.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha stopped breathing.</p>

<p>
<em>Hihi, Mrs &amp; Mrs Smith.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>You are headed back to New York. You will be going undercover to protect Judge Matthews' daughter at the Miss America beauty pageant. As you may know, he will be overseeing the sentence of gang lord Marina Blue after the FBI caught her a month ago to this date. Her gang the Serpiente have made it clear they will be retaliating.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>This mission appears to be a long one and will continue throughout the entire Miss America process, starting with the luncheon you will be attending as soon as you return. You will be assigned other missions in between inactive periods.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lastly, we would like to apologise for interrupting your uninterrupted days off. The FBI thought the pair of you would be the best agents for the job.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>More details soon.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio would be lying if she said she hadn’t been royally pissed off when she received the message from Hihi at dinner in Italy last night. She and Agatha had to leave soon after, a boat out of Portofino was waiting for them and then they were headed to the airport.<br/>
</p><p>They’d told Jen and Alice to stay for the remainder of the trip, there was no point in them all missing out just because she and Agatha had a mission. She’d wondered if there would ever be a time when the four of them could hang out without a mission interrupting them.<br/>
</p><p>As much as it irritated her to no end that she couldn’t enjoy the rest of her birthday; she’d always put her job first…second? After the Zip and Zazzle mission, after she and Agatha had fought, after they’d laid bare their feelings after Rio had comforted her in the shower, Rio had this terrifying realisation that maybe her job wasn’t first…<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t like it. A person was not supposed to come before her job, she wasn’t supposed to put her duty to her country and protecting the lives of civilians above someone who was perfectly capable of holding her own…and yet she was.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t do it willingly, but her heart seemed to win out over her head in the matter.<br/>
</p><p>She looked at Agatha now as she drove them to the Miss America luncheon. Her wife in an all-black number; a black off-the-shoulder knitted jumper and black trousers. The deep red lipstick she tendered to wear painted her perfect lips.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wished they could swap outfits. She was wearing a light pink flowy dress with small white flowers. Rio wouldn’t be caught dead in it on a normal day. She was wearing it because Hihi had made her pose as a Miss America contestant for their undercover, and Agatha was to be her coach.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t understand why Hihi would make <em>her<em> do it. Agatha had all the knowledge on how to be a pageant girl. She’d been friends with some, although Agatha corrected her and said they were more acquaintances. Her wife had been to luncheons, and brunches, and soirees like every teenager on the Upper East Side. She would know how to go about this correctly. Rio didn’t have a clue.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio watched as Agatha drummed her fingers on the steering wheel as she drove. This wouldn’t be unusual, but Rio knew her wife. Ever since she’d returned from the bathroom once they’d gotten the text from Hihi at dinner, Agatha seemed… (she didn’t want to say off) <em>off.<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>At first, Rio put it down to being pissed off that Hihi had ruined their trip. The way she kept fidgeting, had nearly broken the zipper on her luggage case as she tried to close it in the hotel room, the way she held Rio’s hand so tightly on the journey home she almost cut off her blood circulation multiple times.<br/>
</p><p>But then she wasn’t talking, not really. Rio thought it was because she was tired. She’d been running around the entire day yesterday trying to make sure Rio’s day was perfect. This morning, Agatha’s talking, or lack of it, was the same as last night. Her sarcasm and snarky replies came just the same, but they weren’t nearly as frequent as Rio knew them to come. As if her wife’s thoughts were elsewhere.<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew better than to ask. She figured out that patience was best when it came to her wife. That she shouldn’t push her because she would tell her at some point when she felt comfortable to.<br/>
</p><p>She turned her attention away from Agatha and back onto the stupid flowy dress stuck on her body. Hihi thought it would make her appear younger considering she was going undercover as a twenty-three-year-old.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Agatha asked, stealing a glance at her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>How about you tell me first?<em> “It’s this dress,” Rio groaned.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “You only have to wear it for a few hours.”<br/>
</p><p>“Good because then I’m burning it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled again.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>She should’ve laughed at that, or told me she would burn it with me, or made a remark about how her dramatic flair is rubbing off on me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio resisted the urge to sigh. Instead removing one of her wife’s hands off the steering wheel where it continued its tapping, intertwining their fingers, and rubbing soothingly on her hand with her thumb. She hoped the action said:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I’ve got you. I’m here for you. Tell me what’s bothering you when you’re ready.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Half an hour later, Rio was sat at a table with five other pageant contestants in a banquet hall in The New York Palace Hotel. She was posing as ‘Miss Delaware.’ What Hihi had done with the <em>real<em> Miss Delaware, she didn’t question.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her mission subject, Kalani-Rose Matthews next to her. The other girls, ‘Miss Washington,’ ‘Miss Chicago,’ ‘Miss California,’ and ‘Miss Massachusetts.’ Were having a conversation about what colleges they went to, and Rio had to force herself not to zone out or look for her wife across the room chatting away with the other coaches.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t want to say she hated pageants. They’d definitely evolved from what they used to be in the late 90s/early 2000s. The contestants were judged for more than the size of their bodies or the looks of their faces. They were now asked how they wanted to change the world, what they did to act on those changes and more, but still. It would never be a process that Rio would willingly put herself through.<br/>
</p><p>“What about you, Rio?” A soft voice asked.<br/>
</p><p>She peeled her eyes off her wife and blinked, realising the entire table was staring at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry…could you repeat the question…please?”<br/>
</p><p>Miss Washington smiled. She kind of reminded Rio of Alice without the red streaks and with neat layers instead of her rough wolf cut.<br/>
</p><p>“Where do you go to college?”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh…NYU.” Of course, Rio wouldn’t mention the fact she graduated over a decade ago now.<br/>
</p><p>“My sister goes there!” Miss Massachusetts shouted. “What course do you do?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stirred. “Biology.”<br/>
</p><p>That got a lot of sounds of approval from the group.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled nervously. She was <em>way<em> out of her depth. She couldn’t be around all these confident pageant girls, not when she’d just been called poor and that she’d come from nothing by her wife’s mother. She was surrounded by girls whose mothers would probably think just the same.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Evanora’s words still stung, as much as Rio hated to admit it. As much as Agatha’s words had quietened the thoughts and the ring she gave her solidified the truth behind them, she couldn’t shake the feeling that Agatha deserved better than her. It wasn’t true, of course, her wife had told her that much. But her brain liked to fuck with her.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you married?” Miss Chicago asked her, she nodded at the ring Rio hadn’t realised she was playing with.<br/>
</p><p>In the time Rio had gotten lost in thought the conversation must’ve moved on because the question didn’t sound out of the blue.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…” Was she supposed to say she was married? She didn’t think it would affect the mission, but it didn’t seem right for her undercover persona. “Sort of,” Rio settled on. “It’s more of a promise ring until I get the actual thing,” she explained.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, that man is very lucky,” Miss California replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Girl,” Rio corrected with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>“I knew it!” Kalani-Rose exclaimed. “So, you have a girlfriend?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“What does she look like? Describe her to us,” she urged, resting her head on her chin and leaning in. The other girls around the table copied her actions.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…” Rio stirred some more. “She’s got silky dark hair and eyes the colour of the ocean.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was aware that she probably meant is she blonde or brunette, or does she have green eyes or brown. But she couldn’t undermine Agatha’s beauty by simplifying it like that. Her wife’s beauty was <em>not<em> simple. It was the type that would attract hundreds of thousands of people to museums just to catch a glimpse of on a portrait, the type of beauty people would go to war for, the type of beauty that ensured you got everything you wanted.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“What a lovely way to put it,” Miss Washington said.<br/>
</p><p>Kalani-Rose rolled her eyes. “So, what I’m hearing is you like brunettes?”<br/>
</p><p>“I guess so…yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>“You ever been with a blonde?”<br/>
</p><p>As much as Rio hated to admit at the time, Alice was right, her type hadn’t changed since high school.<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Shame. You should try it out sometime. We’re quite fun,” Kalani-Rose smirked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wasn’t religious, but she thanked a higher power that her wife was not around to hear that. Their mission subject would soon become their mission target.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on, Kalani!” Miss Washington groaned. “She <em>just<em> told us she had a girlfriend.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I always go after what I want, you know this. How else do you think I won Miss New York, huh?” She turned back to Rio. “Tell your girlfriend she’s got some competition.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio fought the urge to laugh. Who did this girl think she was?<br/>
</p><p>“I couldn’t possibly lie to her. Healthy relationships are built on trust after all,” Rio replied, taking a sip of her water.<br/>
</p><p>Kalani-Rose didn’t seem deterred by her remark. “Until the foundations start to fold in on themselves,” that smirk returned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was so fucking glad Agatha couldn’t hear this conversation.<br/>
</p><p>“Okayyy,” Miss Chicago said hastily. “Let’s move on, shall we?”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was refreshing her phone for what seemed like the billionth time that day.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Unknown number: Get rid of her or they’ll kill her.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Who will? Who is this?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Radio silence.<br/>
</p><p>How dare they send her some cryptic text message and then not elaborate? Firstly, get rid of Rio how? Divorce her, hide her, kill her? And <em>they’ll<em> who the fuck was that? It wasn’t lost on Agatha that she had a city’s worth of enemies dating back to even before she was an FBI agent and instead simply the daughter of a multimillionaire.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>But something seemed off, the threat was so random. And why weren’t her enemies going after <em>her?<em> If they really wanted to harm her, would they seriously take it out on Rio? This is how she knew the threat couldn’t be coming from her mother. Evanora liked to harm Agatha directly. She wouldn’t bother going after Rio with more than words. It would be a waste of her time and skills.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>So…who the fuck was it then? And who had texted her?<br/>
</p><p>She debated telling Rio about the text, technically, she still was. She didn’t want to hide anything from her wife, but she couldn’t think of a good reason to tell her, not when she didn’t know anything. At the same time, she wanted to tell Rio so that she could be on higher alert, not that Agatha would let anything happen to her as long as Rio was…<br/>
</p><p>Where the hell was Rio?<br/>
</p><p>Her wife and mission subject chairs were empty. Agatha sighed and tapped on Rio’s text messages knowing she’d probably get her faster that way than turning on coms if she wasn’t in the position to talk.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Where’d you go?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>The reply came almost five minutes later, and good because Agatha was just about ready to flip this whole building upside down, scared that someone really had killed her wife.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: toilet.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: And you didn’t think to fucking tell me?! Something could’ve happened to you, Ri!<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: …???<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: we only went to the toilet? i’ve got my gun on me. we’re fine.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: You should’ve told me.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha watched those three little dots appear and disappear three times before Rio’s next message came in.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: no, you’re right. i should’ve told you. i’m sorry.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: our mission subject is a real weirdo btw.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha found herself laughing.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Weirder than you? What’d she do?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: you don’t wanna know.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Well now I must know.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: trust me, you do not.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Rio…<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio: i miss you &lt;3<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Agatha: Shut up. What’d she do?<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>The reply didn’t come as Rio sauntered back into the room with Kalani-Rose, sat back down in her seat, and made a show of placing her phone on the table, a knowing grin on her lips.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sighed. Match made indeed.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Two hours later, Agatha was still sitting at the same table she had been except now she was surrounded by other coaches. Nobody was saying much, just watching the girls across the room as they conversed.<br/>
</p><p>That’s when Agatha saw the first glimpse of a threat. A server that had been to Rio’s table three times in the space of ten minutes, seemingly for no obvious reason. The girls' drinks were full, their food had been cleared away and the appropriate cutlery had been reset.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was eyeing her too. Every time she came over, she watched her like a hawk as she faffed around with whatever she was doing.<br/>
</p><p>It was the sound of glass shattering minutes later that got everyone’s attention. Rio was apologising profusely as Kalani-Rose was laughing. Agatha couldn’t help but smile, she was sure Rio had done it on purpose, but it brought back memories of their second mission when Rio had knocked over a tray in The Met.<br/>
</p><p>That’s when a gun went off.<br/>
</p><p>Screams and shrieks started soon after. As everyone ducked and fled for cover, Agatha caught sight of another waiter trying to flee the scene by slipping out the fire exit. She was on his tail immediately, yanking the fire exit door open and following him outside.<br/>
</p><p>“FBI! Stop!” She yelled; gun drawn. Of course, her request was unanswered.<br/>
</p><p>She sprinted after him and caught a glimpse of his black uniform disappearing through the black gates at the entrance of the hotel.<br/>
</p><p>Then he was gone.<br/>
</p><p>Swallowed by the bustling streets of the city.<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” she mumbled as she stepped out onto the street.<br/>
</p><p>She searched for him for fifteen minutes before she concluded he was gone. Agatha, understandably, was fuming. This was her fault, right? She should’ve been paying more attention; she shouldn’t have been letting her thoughts consume her <em>again<em> because that’s the only way she could’ve missed an armed waiter in a room with little over one hundred people.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She walked back into the hotel, her spirit decidedly crushed.<br/>
</p><p>Well…until she saw Rio. An unharmed Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“What happened?” She asked once she’d poked and prodded at Agatha to make sure she was alright.<br/>
</p><p>“I lost him,” Agatha huffed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sighed. “Next time.”<br/>
</p><p>“What happened in there?” Agatha nodded to the banquet hall.<br/>
</p><p>“The server slipped something into Kalani-Rose’s drink. I caught it. Knocked it over. After the gun went off most people ran. I stayed with her until her bodyguards took her off me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows as if to say, ‘Fair enough.’ “This doesn’t count as a failed mission, does it?”<br/>
</p><p>“Shouldn’t do. We’ve done our jobs,” Rio replied. “She’s alive.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Yeah, but she could’ve been killed. You too.<em> “Yeah, she is.”<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The wives were back at home snuggled up on one of the larger velvet red chairs in the cinema room. It wasn’t really meant to fit two people, but Agatha had insisted, and she knew Rio couldn’t bring herself to tell her no.<br/>
</p><p>They were watching the news coverage of the luncheon. Of course, a shootout at a Miss America pageant event would make it onto the news. You couldn’t get a clear shot of Rio or Agatha, that was probably due to the FBI’s involvement, but Kalani-Rose was everywhere.<br/>
</p><p>The pageant's social media team had gotten most of the incident on video as they were filming most of the event anyway. An image of the gunman flashed on screen. Daniel Gomez the news told them. This was followed by the news anchor telling people to stay on high alert and report any sightings. He was on the run.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Yeah, because I let him slip through my fingers.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha committed the light brown hair and green eyes to memory. If she saw him, she was taking him down no question about it.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, at least we have a face and a name,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“We wouldn’t need them if I had been paying attention,” Agatha mumbled to herself, well at least she thought it was to herself.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Rio nudged her with her elbow. “Don’t do that. This isn’t your fault.”<br/>
</p><p>“But isn’t it?” Agatha wasn’t saying it to get some sort of sympathy. She meant it because wasn’t this all her fault?<br/>
</p><p>“No.” Rio kissed her once. “It isn’t.” She kissed her again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched. She wouldn’t smile because she believed it, she would smile because how could she not whenever Rio’s soft lips were on hers?<br/>
</p><p>Her wife clapped her hands and stood. “I’m going to make popcorn and snacks and we’re going to watch whatever film your heart desires so you can get out of this self-loathing you’ve gotten yourself into.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled fully this time. “Can we watch Miss Congeniality? It seems very fitting for this mission.”<br/>
</p><p>“Whatever you want,” Rio repeated. “Be back in ten.” She kissed Agatha one last time before exiting the room.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grabbed the remote and pressed rewind to the video that showed the shooting. She wanted to see what she missed. Upon first watch, she saw the same thing she saw for the past four watches: Daniel retrieving a gun from underneath his server's tray and firing it into the air.<br/>
</p><p>Okay…simple…that’s what happened. But Agatha knew she was missing something. She felt it in her gut.<br/>
</p><p>She rewound the clip, zooming in on Daniel and putting it in slow motion. She watched it like that three times before she finally caught something. She sat up in her chair and leaned in. It was a blink-and-you-miss-it moment.<br/>
</p><p>Daniel appeared to be aiming upward as soon as he fired his gun. But was he? He seemed to hesitate, lagging as his gun trained on something else before he shot into the air. He did this for a split second and Agatha seriously considered if she just grasping at strings.<br/>
</p><p>…Or maybe she wasn’t. Why would anyone shoot at nothing?<br/>
</p><p>She zoomed out to try and identify what his gun was momentarily trained on. Sure enough, it was Kalani-Rose across the room. So, why didn’t he shoot her? This was the perfect opportunity. Was this supposed to be a warning to get her father to make the right choice about Marina Blue’s sentencing?<br/>
</p><p>She rewound the clip again and paused it to the exact moment she thought Daniel had his gun trained on her. Agatha’s eyes flicked between Daniel holding the gun and Kalani-Rose at the table. Rio was next to her, her face blurred as she expected.<br/>
</p><p>But wait…<br/>
</p><p>Agatha got up from her chair and stood just before the large screen. She pressed her finger against the screen and dragged it across it to follow Daniel’s line of fire.<br/>
</p><p>Her heart dropped.<br/>
</p><p>The gun hadn’t been pointed at Kalani-Rose…it had been pointed at Rio.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No. No, that can’t be it. I’m seeing things.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She repeated the action three more times. The first and third time her finger landed on Rio, the second and fourth time it landed on Kalani-Rose.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha needed to sit down. The screen was hurting her eyes, and she wasn’t wearing her glasses.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I’m grasping at strings. Why would this have anything to do with Rio?<em> She told herself.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>When her phone buzzed against her thigh, Agatha almost jumped out of her skin. She clicked it on.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Unknown number: I bet you’re trying to convince yourself it’s all in your head.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>And now Agatha understood. The warning wasn’t for Judge Matthews. The warning was for her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke up with a start. Nightmare.<br/>
</p><p>She and Rio were on one of their regular walks around Central Park, coffees in hand, Rio laughing at a joke Agatha had said. And then Rio was dead. A gunman, more specifically, Daniel Gomez, pulling out a gun and shooting her as he passed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha could barely see as her vision blurred. She was screaming for someone to help as Rio’s warm blood poured onto her hands and arms. Nobody came and Agatha was left to cradle a dying Rio as blood gurgled from her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Once Rio was gone, all Agatha could see were those beautiful brown eyes now empty, void of life behind them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha choked out a sob.<br/>
</p><p>As if she’d heard an alarm sounding, Rio stirred at the noise, blinking her eyes open before they landed on her wife.<br/>
</p><p>They’d decided to share a bed now. They had in Italy and their relationship was well established it only seemed right. Today they were in Agatha’s room, deciding they should alternate between the two.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s wrong, mi amor?” Rio asked, her voice thick with sleep.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha replied, rubbing at her eyes to wipe at the tears but playing it off as a tired gesture.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re sure?” Rio pressed.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha offered her a small smile.<br/>
</p><p>She could tell Rio wasn’t convinced, but lucky her wife dropped it.<br/>
</p><p>“Come here,” Rio told her, opening her arms.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snuggled into them willingly, letting the feeling of Rio holding her flood out any trace of the nightmare. Rio was alive and well and holding her and that’s all that mattered.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>DING DONG!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha almost jumped out of her skin.<br/>
</p><p>She broke away from Rio, eyebrows furrowed. They weren’t expecting anyone. Jen and Alice were still in Portofino. Unless…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Was this someone coming to take Rio out?<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s ignore it,” Agatha said, tightening her grip on Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Rio laughed. She went to move but Agatha only strengthened her grip. “Aggs,” Rio half-heartedly smacked her on her back to get her to release her.<br/>
</p><p>“Nobody should be disturbing anyone this early on a Saturday anyway.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed and Agatha knew she’d rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“I didn’t want to have to do this, but you gave me no choice.”<br/>
</p><p>“What-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha yelped when Rio tickled her stomach. She let go of the other woman immediately.<br/>
</p><p>Rio cackled as she fled the room.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you fucking serious?” Agatha shrieked as she chased Rio.<br/>
</p><p>The elevator doors had just snapped shut once she’d made it into the corridor. She cursed under her breath. Why did she have to be ticklish? And why had she been so stupid to let Rio figure that out? Agatha’s mind began to spin as she impatiently clicked on the elevator button.<br/>
</p><p>What if she went upstairs and Rio was dead? What if she went upstairs and Rio had been taken? She <em>really<em> needed to tell her wife about those text messages.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>What felt like an eternity later, the elevator arrived. What felt like another eternity later, the doors opened on the ground floor and Agatha braced herself for what she might see.<br/>
</p><p>It certainly wasn’t that.<br/>
</p><p>“Mama!” Nicky screamed as he bolted down the corridor towards her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows knitted together in complete and utter confusion. She wouldn’t say she wasn’t happy to see her son, she was always happy to see him…but what on earth was he doing here?<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, baby,” she said as she lifted him and placed him on her hip. “What are you doing here, sweetheart?”<br/>
</p><p>“You didn’t know?” Wanda’s irritating voice sounded from down the hall.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t bother suppressing her eye roll. “Enlighten me.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nicky wanted us to have a sleepover because he missed my birthday. We wanted it to be a surprise,” Rio’s beautiful voice answered instead.<br/>
</p><p>“And you’re letting this happen because…” she was talking to Wanda.<br/>
</p><p>“He deserves to spend some time with Rio considering he didn’t get to on her birthday.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha noted that her ex had said ‘spend time with Rio’ and not her, but she tried not to let it get under her skin. Agatha also had a sneaking suspicion that Wanda felt bad about the way her mother had spoken to Rio on the FaceTime call.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m picking you up at three tomorrow, not any later and no that is not up for negotiation,” Wanda halted Nicky in his tracks before he could argue. “And don’t eat too many cookies.”<br/>
</p><p>At that Nicky whined.<br/>
</p><p>“I gotta go, come give Mommy a hug and a kiss.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha put Nicky down and he ran over to Wanda who was already stooping down to receive both. Nicky did just that before taking his Spider-Man rucksack from Wanda’s outstretched hand.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky giggled before running over to the elevator.<br/>
</p><p>“And where do you think you’re going, mister?” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>“To find my room to put this in.”<br/>
</p><p>“Would you like some help?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“No, Riro. I’m fine, I’m big,” Nicky answered.<br/>
</p><p>“You sure are,” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>The elevator doors opened, and Nicky disappeared leaving Agatha with her ex and her wife.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fucking great.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“We need to talk,” Wanda said, looking at Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Er…” Rio stuttered. “I’ll leave you to it,” Rio said, backing away towards the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grabbed her then, kissing her wife long and deeply. She heard a quiet groan from Wanda, and if Agatha’s lips hadn’t been occupied, she would’ve smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled away, glaring at her with a pointed look that told her she’d seen right through her little display of affection. Agatha only shrugged. To her surprise, Rio kissed her again before leaving for the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>“Talk,” Agatha said when her wife was out of sight.<br/>
</p><p>“I just want to say I had no idea Mom was going to say that stuff to Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.<em>Mom.<em> Because that’s how Wanda saw Evanora. As her mother. Agatha wasn’t sure what her mother liked so much about Wanda, but she’d treated her better than she ever had her. And the audacity for Wanda to call her mom?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha was just about ready to stab her.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, you didn’t?” Agatha replied sarcastically.<br/>
</p><p>She wondered what type of warped version Wanda had of Evanora in her mind for her to <em>not<em> see that coming.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Why are you telling me this? My wife’s the one you should be apologising to.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha saw Wanda flinch at the word ‘wife’ and let her eyes roll into the back of her head once more. The audacity.<br/>
</p><p>“I already have,” Wanda told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Great,” Agatha nodded patronisingly. “You can get out now.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda frowned slightly. “Aggs.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back at that. The way Wanda had said it as if pleading with her. It was the same way she’d said it the last time she’d spoken it:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Aggs,” Wanda pleaded. “I didn’t have a choice.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You can go fuck yourself.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Don’t be like this. Please.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha wiped angrily at her tears. “How the fuck else am I supposed to be?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Wanda’s face dropped as she bit her lip. She didn’t have an answer.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha scoffed. “Exactly.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Just…” Wanda started. “What did you want me to do? I would’ve lost everything! My livelihood, my money, my firm!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You would’ve had me!” Agatha shot back. “And Nicky! I would’ve helped you, I could have helped you if you’d come to me. You were drowning and you didn’t think your own girlfriend would’ve helped you swim?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Wanda was crying now. She let the tears roll down her cheeks not even bothering to wipe them. “I didn’t want to put the burden on you.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Bullshit,” Agatha spat.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Mom offered to help!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha groaned. “She’s not you’re fucking mother.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“She is! My mother’s dead! Evanora is all I have left. She offered more like insisted on saving the firm and I let her! Is that so fucking bad?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha could’ve strangled her. “Yes! You know how badly she treated me, still does!” Agatha swiped underneath her eyes again. “And you’ve never defended me, not once.” Agatha laughed bitterly. “And I let it go all these years because I loved you, but just as I know the sky is blue, I know I no longer love you.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Don’t you have somewhere to be?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda sighed before turning on her heels and leaving the house without a word.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head to clear it of the memory. She had too much on her plate already, thinking about what went down with her ex wasn’t something she had time for.<br/>
</p><p>She walked into the kitchen to find Rio on her tiptoes reaching into one of the top cupboards. Agatha tried not to let herself linger on the way her shirt rose up revealing her abs and from this angle, she could see the bottom of her ass in her shorts. She couldn’t let her mind go there when Nicky was sure to return at any moment.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you looking for?” Agatha asked, turning to look at their coffee maker which had suddenly become very interesting. Had it always been red?<br/>
</p><p>“Flour. I thought we could make pancakes for breakfast,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“I want pancakes!” Nicky yelled, running into the room.<br/>
</p><p>“And where did you come from?” Agatha smiled because seriously where had he come from? Was Rio so distracting she didn’t even hear her own elevator ping.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky giggled.<br/>
</p><p>“What do we say when we want something?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Please,” Nicky answered.<br/>
</p><p>“And en Español?” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“Por favor.”<br/>
</p><p>“¡Perfecto! Vamos,” Rio replied as Nicky tugged at her shorts and pulled her towards the island.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>An hour or so later, Rio, Nicky and Agatha were sat around the dining table eating their pancakes. Nicky sat next to Rio and Agatha was opposite him. They watched with careful eyes as Nicky picked up another pancake and dropped it onto his plate. He reached across the table for the strawberries and Rio grabbed his orange juice to save it from being knocked over <em>again.<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>Nicky, of course, refused all help because <em>he was big.<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I’m doing the whipped cream for you though,” Agatha told him.<br/>
</p><p>“But Mama-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, and all arguments stopped.<br/>
</p><p>As Agatha squeezed the whipped cream onto his pancakes she wondered if having Nicky here was a good idea. Was it safe? Probably not with a threat looming over Rio’s head but she couldn’t exactly get him to leave. Not without telling Rio and Wanda why, and she thought that was a conversation best to have when Nicky was not in the house.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha just hoped whoever was after them wasn’t so heartless as to harm a five-year-old. She would easily lay down her life protecting Nicky, but she hoped it wouldn’t have to come to that.<br/>
</p><p>“And how’s your friend? Are you able to speak to her now?” Rio asked as Nicky shovelled his food into his mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” he nodded. “My Spanish is muy bien.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio hummed, a smile on her lips. “That’s good.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m teaching her English too!”<br/>
</p><p>“You are?” Agatha said as she took a sip of her apple juice.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes!”<br/>
</p><p>“What was her name again?” Rio asked. “Victoria?”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky frowned. “No, Mami. <em>Valentina.”<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha watched Rio freeze at the word. She smiled to herself, she doubted Nicky even realised he’d said it.<br/>
</p><p>Rio glanced over at Agatha who shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>Rio swallowed. “Erm…no that’s my fault…sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky giggled, returning to his breakfast blissfully unaware that he’d made Rio’s head spin.<br/>
</p><p>He’d made Agatha’s head spin too. Was that how he saw Rio now? As another mother? She’d never told him outright that Rio was her girlfriend, or wife, or whatever the fuck. Nicky was a smart kid; he’d figured that out on his own. But for him to call Rio that…<br/>
</p><p>Agatha could see it now. The three of them, one big happy family. One that he deserved after the shitshow that was her and Wanda’s relationship.<br/>
</p><p>The thought was swiftly shut down when Agatha remembered the threat that hung over Rio’s head.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs?” Rio’s voice was soft, but her brows were knitted in concern. Her eyes moved to Agatha’s clenched fits around her cutlery.<br/>
</p><p>She hadn’t even noticed she was doing it.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” she told Rio with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The plan was to take Nicky on a walk around Central Park and get food after. That plan had been scraped when hail stones the size of tennis balls came hurdling out of the sky. There was to be a storm.<br/>
</p><p>Now Rio found herself playing a very intense game of tag in their basement. The game had really put into perspective just how big their house was. There was no shortage of rooms to run into. She’d be corned in the gym, hidden in the cinema room and almost slipped when running across the poolside.<br/>
</p><p>She and Nicky had joined forces. Agatha had been It before she snuck up on Rio from her hiding place in the cinema room. Nicky declared that, that wasn’t fair and offered to help Rio take down his mother. The pair were closing in on her wife as Agatha kept taking steps towards the edge of the pool.<br/>
</p><p>“How is this fair?” Agatha groaned. “We’re not supposed to be playing in teams.”<br/>
</p><p>“You started it,” Rio countered. “You can’t sneak up on people.”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s exactly what you’re supposed to do! We’re playing tag!” Agatha shot back, taking another cautious step back as Nicky and Rio edged closer.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky shook his head. “No Mama.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio could see her wife switching tactics. That was confirmed when she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Okay…let’s think about this…you both lov…care about me. You wouldn’t want me to suffer.” Agatha shook her head slowly. “You just wouldn’t.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio and Nicky glanced at each other before continuing their advance.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you both serious? It’s only tag, just a bit of fun!” Agatha whined.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh. Her wife was easily the strongest person she knew, and she was whining about potentially getting wet after cheating at a kid's game.<br/>
</p><p>“This isn’t-” Agatha cut herself off with a yelp when her foot slipped off the edge of the pool.<br/>
</p><p>Rio caught her by her arm as she hung off the platform.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Rio told her as Nicky squealed in delight.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I knew you couldn’t let me fall.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. “Oh, won’t I?”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you dare-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio let go of her wife and she fell into the water fully clothed. Nicky burst out laughing.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha seethed as she flapped around in the water spraying water at them.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t underestimate me,” Rio cackled.<br/>
</p><p>She saw her wife twitch to flip her off until she remembered her child there.<br/>
</p><p>“Help me out at least,” Agatha said, swimming to the poolside, her hand outstretched for Rio to take.<br/>
</p><p>Now, Rio knew her wife and she wouldn’t fall for it. “Nice try.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Okay, Nicholas will <em>you<em> help me?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Nicky swayed on his spot before deciding he would. He went to do just that when Rio sighed and declared that she’d do it. She didn’t want Nicky getting too close to the edge and he wouldn’t have been able to pull his mother up anyway.<br/>
</p><p>“Here,” Rio said, holding out her hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Too easy,” Agatha grinned before grabbing Rio’s hand and pulling her into the pool.<br/>
</p><p>Rio fell in head first, almost hitting her head on the bottom of the pool because they weren’t in the deep end. Rio had to resist the urge to swear at Agatha when she resurfaced.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was the one cackling now until she turned to see Nicky backing away to do a run-up into the pool.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha warned. “You don’t have your armbands on.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky turned to Rio who was encouraging him to jump into her arms.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky giggled before running full speed.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha got cut off when Nicky splashed her as he jumped into the pool into Rio’s waiting arms. His face and head full of curls got soaked before he splashed and squealed in Rio’s arms.<br/>
</p><p>“You are a terrible influence,” Agatha told Rio who held Nicky in her hip.<br/>
</p><p>At that, Nicky and Rio both turned to each other. With their intentions aligned, they both proceeded to splash water at Agatha who promptly swam away from them.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent swimming. Wanda, always prepared, had packed Nicky some swimming trunks and armbands. After jumping into the pool fully clothed and then not wanting to get out, Agatha said he didn’t have to as long as they put on swimming costumes.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had spent the better part of two hours teaching Nicky how to float on his back. For this, the armbands had to be removed, but Rio reassured Agatha near to a hundred times that she wouldn’t let anything happen to him. Rio meant it more than anything.<br/>
</p><p>When they finally coaxed Nicky out of the pool with the promise of pizza and a movie of his choice, the wives and Nicky ended up snuggled together with pizza, French fries and garlic bread after quick showers and changes into pyjamas.<br/>
</p><p>To Nicky and Rio’s delight and Agatha’s dismay, they were watching <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming.<em> Nicky’s favourite film and Rio’s sixth favourite film. Nobody could beat Toby Maguire’s version of the franchise in Rio’s humble opinion.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio could tell her wife was enjoying the film even though she made a show of scowling and feigning disinterest by the way she was trying to stifle her laughs and couldn’t keep her eyes off the screen as Peter climbed the Washington Monument.<br/>
</p><p>When the credits rolled around, Nicky had fallen asleep on Agatha’s shoulder. They moved cautiously as they got up, not wanting to disturb him.<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna carry him to bed?” Agatha whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked. “Are you sure?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “I wouldn’t have suggested it otherwise.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio inhaled shakily before nodding. Carefully, she picked up Nicky’s sleeping form and brought him to sit on her hips, her arm going underneath his leg to support him, the other going around his back. Even in sleep, Nicky lifted his arms to cling to Rio’s neck.<br/>
</p><p>All she could do was stare at him. He was so precious, an extension of his extraordinary mother. So smart, so kind, so sweet.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on, my love. Let’s go to bed,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>The storm was audible now on the top floor. Rio had almost forgotten about it whilst they were tucked away in the cinema room. The wind lashed at the windows; the rain pelted the roof like a consistent spray of bullets.<br/>
</p><p>She rested Nicky on his bed in the guest room, and Agatha tucked him in, putting his stuffed bunny in his grip.<br/>
</p><p>“Goodnight, baby,” Agatha whispered, kissing him twice on the forehead.<br/>
</p><p>She tugged on Rio’s pyjama shorts pockets to guide her out of the room.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t sleep. The storm was too loud, her throat was too dry, and she desperately needed water. She lifted her arm off Agatha’s waist to go to the kitchen when the other woman grabbed onto it.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m just going to get some water,” Rio soothed. “I’ll be back in a moment don’t worry.”<br/>
</p><p>Her wife hummed, and Rio left for the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>Now with a glass of ice-cold water from the water dispenser attached to the fridge, Rio sat on one of the chairs around their kitchen island listening to the sounds of the storm. She smiled to herself. How had her life turned out like this? She now had a wife, a wife who had a son whom she couldn’t help but adore.<br/>
</p><p>Rio never thought of herself as someone who was a ‘kid’s person’ maybe she still wasn’t, maybe it was just Nicky. She wished her Abuela could’ve been around to see this, to meet them. Would she be proud of Rio now? Rio liked to think so. She hadn’t been thrilled with the idea of Rio joining the FBI when she first told her after that encounter with her father. She’d been worried that Rio would put her work first and wouldn’t make anytime to create a life for herself outside of it.<br/>
</p><p>She had now.<br/>
</p><p>Rio finished her water, put her glass in the dishwasher and made her way back to her room. She’d almost made it to Agatha’s door when she heard:<br/>
</p><p>“Mami?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. That word again. She’d almost broken down in tears the first time Nicky had said it over breakfast. Did he mean it or was he just testing the word out in Spanish and felt most comfortable using it on her because she was the one teaching it to him? She tried not to think about it and answered:<br/>
</p><p>“Yes? What are you doing up, buddy?” Rio asked softly, making her way over to him. She stooped so she was looking up at him.<br/>
</p><p>“Can’t sleep,” Nicky told her, his stuffed bunny pressed against his chest.<br/>
</p><p>“Is it the storm?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip. “Do you want to sleep in there with your Mama?” She gestured to Agatha’s room.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky nodded again.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, let’s go.” Rio stood and held out a hand for him to take.<br/>
</p><p>He did, and she led him into Agatha’s room. Her wife was up, her bedside table lamp on, most likely waiting for her return.<br/>
</p><p>“Couldn’t sleep, huh?” Agatha said when Rio lifted Nicky onto the bed.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky shook his head.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s alright, sweetheart.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky pressed himself into her as she wrapped her arms around him. Rio waited for them to get settled before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Goodnight. I’ll see you in the morning.”<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t want to overstep. She wasn’t sure if Nicky would be comfortable sharing a bed with both her and his mother.<br/>
</p><p>“Where are you going? You’ve got to get in,” Nicky said. He was drifting off again, but he’d found it in him to get the sentence out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows as if to say, ‘You can’t argue with that.’<br/>
</p><p>And no, Rio couldn’t. She climbed into bed, sandwiching Nicky in the middle between herself and her wife. Agatha turned off the light and draped her hand over Rio and Nicky. Rio did the same.<br/>
</p><p>Soon enough, the trio drifted off into an easy sleep.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>They woke up in the late hours of the morning. Agatha was surprised Nicky slept for that long, he usually woke up at the crack of dawn with all the energy of the sun.<br/>
</p><p>He still had that energy at 11:45, jumping around on the bed to get them up. Agatha had to warn him not to in case he fell off the bed, but when Rio was up, she started jumping too because of course she did. Agatha had to avoid feet trampling her as they jumped all over the bed.<br/>
</p><p>“Be…care…full,” Agatha said as the bed shook.<br/>
</p><p>“Jump with us, Mama,” Nicky urged.<br/>
</p><p>“No, thank you,” Agatha said hastily, diving out of the way before Rio landed on her. “I’m going to get ready and make breakfast.” She stood. “You can see he does the same,” she said to Rio, who was watching Nicky jump apparently now exhausted from the way she slumped against the headboard.<br/>
</p><p>The pair came into the kitchen half an hour later. Agatha laid out three bowls, milk and cereal. She hoisted Nicky onto the highest chair around the island, unsurprised when the first thing he did was reach for the box of Coco Puffs.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you want to do today, baby?” Agatha asked when Nicky’s breakfast was sorted.<br/>
</p><p>“Can we go to the Disney store in Times Square, please?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grimaced. She fucking hated Times Square, that place was reserved for tourists and suckers.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?”<br/>
</p><p>“There’s a Spider-Man pop-up Nicky wants to go to,” Rio answered.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky nodded as he shoved a spoonful of Coco Puffs in his mouth. He’d eaten more than he could chew, his cereal dribbled out of the corners of his mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face. “Here,” she handed him a piece of kitchen roll.<br/>
</p><p>He accepted it with a giggle.<br/>
</p><p>“Can we do something else?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?”<br/>
</p><p>“I just-”<br/>
</p><p>“Mama’s scared of Times Square,” Nicky answered for her.<br/>
</p><p>“That isn’t true.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re scared of Times Square?” Rio asked at the same time thoroughly amused.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha replied immediately.<br/>
</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio hummed. “Well, in that case, we might have to give it a miss if Mama scares so easily.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned from the pair to conceal her smile at Rio’s words. She noticed the lack of ‘Your’ when Rio had said, ‘Mama scares so easily.’ It had rolled off Rio’s tongue so effortlessly as if Nicky was theirs. Yet again, like she wondered with Nicky, she wondered if Rio had even noticed.<br/>
</p><p>“I do not scare – ah!” Agatha yelped after Rio grabbed her shoulders and screamed in her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“What was that?” Rio laughed as Nicky giggled.<br/>
</p><p>She shoved at Rio’s face, pushing her back after she had the audacity to hug her from behind and rest her head on her shoulder after scaring her.<br/>
</p><p>“Get away from me,” Agatha told her wife as Rio tried to wrap her arms around her again. “Go sit down and eat your food.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio did as she was told, reaching across the table for the Coco Puffs. She had no idea how the two stomached them, they were just pure sugar. She sat down and poured herself some milk.<br/>
</p><p>“How about we go play in the park instead, like we were supposed to do yesterday?” Rio suggested.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes! Let’s go to the park!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hands up. If she had suggested that Nicky would’ve complained, and she would’ve had to spend the next ten minutes convincing him. Rio had made it look so easy.<br/>
</p><p>“Guess we’re going to the park,” Agatha mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky clapped as Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Nicky and Rio were playing witches and wizards. Agatha was not playing. Rio had pissed her off by scaring her three more times after the initial time she’d scared her. Now, she was sitting with her arms folded, coffee in hand, on a Central Park bench.<br/>
</p><p>The chaotic duo had run off somewhere and if she weren’t pissed off, she’d probably start looking for them.<br/>
</p><p>“Mama!” Nicky screamed, bolting towards her from down the path, Rio on his heels.<br/>
</p><p>When they arrived, Nicky looked like a pot about to boil over. He was clearly hiding something, and Agatha knew it had something to do with whatever he was hiding behind his back.<br/>
</p><p>“I know you’re mad at me,” Rio started.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, you did?” Agatha replied sarcastically. “You really are beauty and brains.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “So…we made you this.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky revealed a stick with purple flowers wrapped around it. “It’s your wand, Mama! We’re hoping you’ll play with us now!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s smile only widened, and Agatha was fighting for her life to stifle hers. Why was this fake wand the best gift she’d ever received?<br/>
</p><p>She feigned indifference. “Well…since you’ve gone through all the effort.” She took the wand.<br/>
</p><p>“Yay!” Nicky squealed, climbing onto the bench.<br/>
</p><p>Rio and Nicky attacked her with kisses on each of her cheeks. She laughed despite herself. She loved them both dearly.<br/>
</p><p>Hold on…<em>loved?<em> She loved Rio?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She didn’t get time to process the thought.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve got to try and blast us now, Mama,” Nicky told her as he scrambled off the bench, waving at Rio to join him as they ran away.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes with a laugh before she put down her coffee and began chasing them.<br/>
</p><p>They spent the next god knows how long running around Central Park pretending to be witches and wizards. They waved their sticks around, spouting gibberish like ‘abracadabra’ and other things along those lines.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky was chasing them down, and Agatha and Rio were pretending to run away, running slowly so he could catch them and ‘shoot magic’ at them. During their escape, Rio picked Agatha up, earning a squeal from her wife as she threw her over her shoulder and jogged away. Nicky ran into the back of Rio’s legs and almost caused her to send her wife flying. Rio caught her legs as she almost faceplanted the ground.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m gonna have to put you on the grass,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you dare!”<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio replied as she started lowering her to the ground.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio Vidal, if you put me in this grass, I swear to god!” Agatha warned her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed before she stooped further, placing Agatha’s feet on the solid earth.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shot her wife a look before righting herself. “I’m ready to go home now,” she said as she blew hair out of her face.<br/>
</p><p>“No, Mama!” Nicky shouted.<br/>
</p><p>“We gotta go, Nicky,” Rio said. “Your Mom’s picking you up in twenty minutes.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky kicked the grass. “But I don’t want to go with Mommy. I want to stay with you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio and Agatha looked at each other. They didn’t want Nicky to go either.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stooped down so she was looking up at her son. “We’ll do this again soon, promise,” she offered him a warm smile.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky’s frown didn’t budge.<br/>
</p><p>“You want a piggyback?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>The frown disappeared immediately.<br/>
</p><p>“I knew you would. Come on then.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Wanda was there when they got home, and Nicky left soon after. There had been tears and promises that he’d be back with them soon.<br/>
</p><p>Sometimes, Agatha wished she had a different job, one that would mean she could spend every day with her son. But if she didn’t have this job, she wouldn’t have Rio and Nicky wouldn’t have her either.<br/>
</p><p>As they cleaned the house, Agatha collected her thoughts on how she was going to approach this conversation with Rio. She’d decided that it was ultimately best for her to tell Rio about the text messages. She didn’t want to lie to her. Not again.<br/>
</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Agatha said as Rio was about to leave the cinema room, trash bag in hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>She beckoned her over with her index finger and patted the chair next to her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes but put the trash bag down and followed Agatha’s instructions.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t know where to start. Instead, she decided to let the text messages do the talking. She handed Rio her phone, opened to the messages.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha watched as her wife’s eyes scanned the phone, once, twice, three times, before she gave it back. Rio looked down at nothing, her lip between her teeth, her fingers mindlessly twisting her wedding ring.<br/>
</p><p>“They’re about me?” Rio finally spoke moments later.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m pretty sure, yeah,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>More silence.<br/>
</p><p>“What does this mean…what do you…” Rio trailed off.<br/>
</p><p>“What do <em>I<em> want to do?” Agatha finished for her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s not really about what I want to do. It’s your safety they are threatening.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “Jesus, I don’t care about my safety. I mean, I do, but empty threats don’t worry me. We’re FBI agents, our lives get threatened every day it’s in the job description.”<br/>
</p><p>Despite herself, Agatha laughed. She turned serious again when she told Rio about the shooting at the Miss America luncheon.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked when her wife merely shrugged. “You can’t know for certain. You said sometimes it seemed like it was aimed at Kalani-Rose.”<br/>
</p><p>“I know that,” Agatha replied. “But then I got the text message.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio waved her hand dismissively. “It doesn’t make any sense, Aggs. Why would someone shoot at an FBI agent in broad daylight? I’m a nobody sat next to a high-profile judge’s daughter.”<br/>
</p><p>“You aren’t nobody,” Agatha told her, everything else Rio said flying over her head.<br/>
</p><p>Rio tilted her head as if to say, ‘You missed the point.’ “Nobody gains anything from killing me, nobody gains anything from making you miserable. I would say maybe your mother, but she would never stoop so low as to kill me…would she?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow. “Well, conversion therapy didn’t work, so maybe she’s trying something new.”<br/>
</p><p>It was supposed to be a joke, Agatha didn’t believe her mother would do such a thing, but the look on Rio’s face? Yeah, Rio hadn’t seen it as a joke.<br/>
</p><p>“She…she…what?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sighed. The truth was out now, no point in sugar coating it. “Yeah.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio leaned across her chair, cupping Agatha’s face with both hands. “I am <em>so<em> sorry, baby. You didn’t deserve that, nobody does.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha replied as Rio’s thumbs brushed her cheekbones.<br/>
</p><p>“It isn’t.”<br/>
</p><p>In all honesty, Agatha had gone numb to the fact that she’d gone to conversion therapy. Years of drug and alcohol abuse had made sure of that. It was just the way Rio was looking at her, <em>apologised<em> to her with such sincerity. It threatened to burst the floodgates open.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She couldn’t let it; they were getting off topic. Agatha was about to make sure they returned to it until Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“If you don’t mind me asking…how is your mother okay with Wanda?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed bitterly. “I have no idea.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, her thumbs continuing their soothing motion.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled away; she wouldn’t be able to continue the serious conversation at hand if Rio was distracting her.<br/>
</p><p>Sensing that Agatha didn’t want to talk about it anymore, Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not worried about me. I’m worried about…what this means for us.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed. She didn’t know. When she thought about telling Rio, she’d imagined her wife caring more about what happened to herself not them.<br/>
</p><p>“I want to keep you safe,” Agatha concluded. “And…” She didn’t want to say it, god she really didn’t. Living life without Rio now that she’d found her seemed so miserable, she thought she’d stop breathing. But Rio might stop breathing if she didn’t take the threat seriously. “And if that means,” Agatha continued, “That you get a new partner then-”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha, don’t leave me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha crinkled her eyebrows, biting down on her lip to keep the tears at bay. Rio just <em>had<em> to make this difficult, didn’t she? Here she was trying to be selfless and letting her wife be free of her, and Rio, like always, was challenging her. This was hard enough as it was.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha forced herself to keep going. “It would be safer for you if you weren’t with me and-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio cut her off once more. “Do not leave me.”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned. “You have to listen to-”<br/>
</p><p>“Do not. <em>Leave me.”<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, inhaling shakily. Her wife, so willing to look past the dangers, so stubborn, so afraid to be left alone.<br/>
</p><p>She was ready to argue her point again until she locked eyes with Rio. Those big brown eyes drained all the fight left in her away. Who was she kidding? Agatha <em>was<em> selfish, especially when it came to her. In the end, all Agatha said was:<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Okay.”</p>

<strong>Three months later.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>It was undeniable. Rio was high.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had bought them the <em>good<em> stuff. Rio would never call herself a stoner, but it usually took her more than two tokes for cannabis to have an effect on her. Well, apparently not with whatever the fuck was in this stuff.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She watched with heavy eyes as her wife lit up the zoot again with her lighter. They were in their rooftop garden, sprawled out on their three-seat garden swing chair. Agatha’s feet were in Rio’s lap whilst Rio let her right leg hang off the chair to rock them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha inhaled deeply before she breathed out, letting the smoke seep from her mouth and nose. She leaned back and smiled lazily at nothing. Rio smiled too. She was content to die like this, high out of her mind, staring at her beautiful wife.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lifted the blunt to her lips again, inhaling and sitting up before crawling on top of Rio. She laughed as Agatha parted her lips by tugging her bottom one with her thumb. Agatha’s lips ghosted over Rio’s as she blew smoke into her mouth. She’d given up halfway through, instead collapsing on Rio and pressing their lips together in a lazy kiss.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed once more when their lips broke apart and smoke spun in the space between them. She brought a hand to brush through the hair on Agatha’s scalp. Her wife settled further into her, wrapping her arms around her stomach and burying her head on her chest.<br/>
</p><p>“Why…?” As usual, whenever Rio got high, she’d forgotten whatever she was going to say the moment she thought it. “Why…?”<br/>
</p><p>“Whyy…?” Agatha mumbled into her chest.<br/>
</p><p>“Just…give me a minute.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha giggled, readjusting her head to settle further into Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Why…?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Jesus what the fuck was I going to…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>I was going to…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>I was…?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Erm…”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha giggled again, a slow and breathless sound that, if Rio was thinking straight, she would’ve committed to memory.<br/>
</p><p>“Mouse got your tongue?” Agatha teased, closing her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Apparently,” Rio sighed.<br/>
</p><p>They fell into a comfortable near silence, the sounds of the city humming below, <em>Abracadabra, by Lady Gaga<em> playing on low volume through their speakers, a song queued by Agatha. Rio ran her fingers through her wife’s hair. Until she realised…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Baby…that’s not…that’s not the saying.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open. “What? Is it not cat’s got your tongue?”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s not what you said,” Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>She propped herself up, so her hands lay across Rio’s chest as she rested her chin on them. “That’s exactly what I said.”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio was laughing even harder now. “You said mouse.”<br/>
</p><p>“Did not!”<br/>
</p><p>“You did!” Rio was full-on cackling now. “You did and you know it.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not arguing about this.”<br/>
</p><p>“Because you know I’m right?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha scowled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed again. “So stubborn.”<br/>
</p><p>“Not,” Agatha shot back.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah? So we didn’t get shot at because you broke into the wrong safe?”<br/>
</p><p>They’d had a mission in the Hamptons. CEO’s of weapon distributor Fletcher Industries, Mr and Mrs Fletcher, were holding their annual summer soiree. Their job was to secure a hard drive hidden in the <em>back<em> safe in their basement. They’d come across a safe in the basement as soon as they entered it, and Agatha was convinced it was the right one.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It was not.<br/>
</p><p>They waisted valuable minutes breaking into the wrong fucking safe and security had caught and shot at them. It ended well…well, if you consider six casualties and the wives fleeing the party covered in blood. The dress code was white, so two women running out of a basement covered in red didn’t go unnoticed.<br/>
</p><p>Luckily for the wives, the guns went off the same time the firework display was on, so no one noticed the gunshots.<br/>
</p><p>Rio spent the journey home teasing Agatha about how stubborn she was and if she’d just allowed Rio to tell her it was the wrong safe, then none of that would’ve happened. Her wife, to no surprise, held her head up high and said she regretted nothing, even as she drove with her hands decorated with dried blood.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha made Rio pay for her teasing later on in the bedroom.<br/>
</p><p>“Let that go. I regret nothing. I was trusting my instincts,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes playfully. “I’m never listening to you again.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. They both knew that was bullshit. Agatha could ask Rio to rip out her own kidney, and Rio would do it willingly.<br/>
</p><p>Now <em>that<em> terrified Rio, just like when she realised, she’d easily put Agatha before her job. She never realised how all-consuming love could be. Well, not in this sense anyway, it wasn’t like how she felt about her Abuela. They were blood, family. You do anything for family.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha wasn’t blood, and yet she might as well be; in fact, Rio was sure this woman had the other half of her soul. And what would you do for the other half of your soul? Any and everything. Fight, die, kill. There wasn’t a thing on earth that would stop her from protecting Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Sometimes Rio thought she was a mad woman (more so than usual) …like, was this normal? They’d known each other six fucking months. Shouldn’t you only feel this way two or three years down the line? Eh, it basically was two to three years down the line; this was lesbianism after all.<br/>
</p><p>“Turn this shit up!” Rio exclaimed when <em>Breathe, by Blu Cantrell ft Sean Paul,<em> came on.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She pushed Agatha off of her. The other woman yelped as Rio ran to the speaker to turn up the song.<br/>
</p><p>“And now we dance…what are you doing on the floor?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Are you for real? You shoved me down here.”<br/>
</p><p>“Did I?” Rio feigned obliviousness as she went to help her wife.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shoved her off and got up on her own.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “Sorry, love.”<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck off.”<br/>
</p><p>“Are you hurt? Want me to kiss it better?” She reached to place a hand on Agatha’s waist.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife tried to push her away again, but Rio caught her wrist and pulled her into her before crashing their lips together.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha pulled back, she still had a scowl on her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Better?” Rio asked, pushing Agatha’s hair out of her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>“What will help?”<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha looked at her, she had <em>the look<em> in her eyes.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio smiled. “You want control, baby?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked at her like she was stupid. “No, of course you do. Come on then.” She tugged them inside the house towards their bedroom…not that they made it there before Agatha pounced.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife shoved her against their corridor wall, their lips colliding. Rio did nothing; she let Agatha force her tongue in, lick at her teeth, bite down on her bottom lip, drawing blood.<br/>
</p><p>“Desperate, are we?” Rio breathed as she panted. Her wife would make her pay for that.<br/>
</p><p>A smirk that Rio could only describe as sinister painted her wife’s lips. “I’m going to ruin you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled as she licked the blood from her lips. “Can’t wait.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha yanked her shorts down before crashing their lips together again.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know how they got into the bedroom, and to be honest, she didn’t care. Agatha practically threw her on the bed before climbing on top of her, pinning her arms down. But Rio couldn’t make this easy…no, she knew what she wanted, and to get it, she had to…<br/>
</p><p>She hooked her leg around Agatha’s waist and used the momentum to roll them over, so now she was on top of Agatha. She pinned her arms down, and Agatha narrowed her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“You wanna play that game?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scrunched her face in confusion. “What game?” She asked innocently as if she didn’t know exactly what she was doing.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm,” was all Agatha said before lifting her knee and pressing it between Rio’s legs.<br/>
</p><p>She shuddered immediately, loosening her grip on Agatha’s wrists. Her wife didn’t hesitate, getting up and slamming her body into Rio’s, so she fell backwards onto the bed. She hit her head hard against the mattress and she damn well saw stars.<br/>
</p><p>A lazy smile slid across her lips. The next thing Rio registered was the sound of clothes being ripped. She looked down and her wife had quiet literally ripped her underwear off her body.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Rio whined. “I liked those.” She actually didn’t care, but she had to be difficult for Agatha to fuck her like she wanted her to.<br/>
</p><p>“Well,” Agatha said as she pushed three fingers in without warning. Rio’s body arched off the bed. “Good thing I can buy you as many as you need.”<br/>
</p><p>And she would have to, this was the fifth pair of Rio’s underwear she’d destroyed this week…it was Tuesday.<br/>
</p><p>Rio gasped as Agatha ran her fingers knuckles deep. She was surprised her wife didn’t make her wait to be touched.<br/>
</p><p>But of course, Rio spoke too soon. Agatha pulled her fingers out, and she couldn’t help the whine that left her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“No. Put them back,” Rio demanded.<br/>
</p><p>“Brat,” Agatha told her. “What do I always tell you?” Agatha asked patronisingly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio glared at her. She would still be difficult because she obviously had a death wish and a bratty reputation to live up to.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know.”<br/>
</p><p>If a look could kill her, Rio was pretty sure the look Agatha was giving her right now would.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife cupped her harshly, and Rio’s body jerked up again.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck,<em>” Rio whimpered.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You like my fingers in you, don’t you?” Agatha spoke again in the same tone.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded frantically.<br/>
</p><p>“I know you do. So, tell me what I want to hear, and you’ll get to keep them there.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blamed her next answer on the fact that she was high, and because she was high, so could afford to risk her life.<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha removed her hand. “Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha got up and left.<br/>
</p><p>Left Rio sprawled out on the bed, half naked and soaking, because Rio couldn’t help herself. She lay like that for a minute, five minutes, ten. Yeah, her wife wasn’t coming back. The elevator had sounded as soon as Agatha left, and it hadn’t made a noise again.<br/>
</p><p>Rio got up and went to it. She didn’t bother redressing, there was no point wasting another pair of underwear. She was getting what she wanted.<br/>
</p><p>She went to the ground floor, searched the kitchen, the living room (jesus, they needed blinds; half of Manhattan had probably seen her naked by now), went into the dining room, nothing.<br/>
</p><p>When she got to the basement, she heard a film playing because of course her wife had gone to watch a fucking film as if she weren’t going to rip Rio a part twenty minutes prior.<br/>
</p><p>Rio walked in, and Agatha didn’t even acknowledge her; her eyes stayed glued to the screen as she watched whatever film she was watching.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said, blocking her wife’s view.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ignored her, craning her neck so she could see to the side of Rio. She stepped into her wife’s eye line again.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio repeated. Agatha repeated her movements, moving to see the screen.<br/>
</p><p>In all honesty, Rio should’ve known better. She knew what she had to do.<br/>
</p><p>She got on her knees and looked up at Agatha as if she were a god, which, in Rio’s eyes, she literally was.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll do as you say,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me what I want to hear,” Agatha replied, her eyes never leaving the screen.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll use my words.”<br/>
</p><p>“And?”<br/>
</p><p>“I want you to take control. I want you to do whatever you want with me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha's lips curled. “Now beg.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed. Nothing was funny she knew Agatha would do this. She wanted to anyway.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha locked on to her for the first time since she left their bedroom, her eyes dark. All amusement on Rio’s face vanished.<br/>
</p><p>“Please, baby. Do whatever you want to me. Please, it’s all I want.”<br/>
</p><p>“Good. I want you to say that whilst I fuck you. Take off your shirt.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio complied without hesitation.<br/>
</p><p>“Lie down.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio did.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha got off her chair and climbed on top of Rio. “You’re not going to be able to think straight once I’m done with you.”<br/>
</p><p>And it was a promise.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha kissed her softly then, and Rio knew that was the last bit of gentleness she’d feel for a while.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha’s lips were on hers again, they were harsh. Her tongue licked at her teeth; she bit down on her lower lip, reopening the previous cut. Agatha’s hands slid up Rio’s body until they rested on her breasts, and then her wife squeezed, hard. Agatha pinched her nipples, and Rio let out a choked gasp.<br/>
</p><p>This was exactly what she needed.<br/>
</p><p>“Why can’t I hear you?” Agatha mumbled on her lips.<br/>
</p><p>Now, Rio wouldn’t say it was because her lips had been preoccupied with Agatha’s on them, she would just…<br/>
</p><p>“That feels so good. You always make me feel so good. Please, keep going.”<br/>
</p><p>It came as no surprise to Rio that her wife had a praise kink after the way she reacted to Rio telling her she was good at picking out fruit.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned her attention to Rio’s neck, kissing and sucking and bruising her skin. She grazed her teeth against Rio’s neck as she continued to pinch her nipples.<br/>
</p><p>Rio would never say she was easy…but she could come right now. Sometimes, even looking at Agatha would make her want to. It didn’t help that she was high, either.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha slid down her body, kissing and biting on the way until her mouth was lined up with Rio’s breasts. Then she dipped down and took the left one in her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Rio could’ve sworn she levitated.<br/>
</p><p>“So…good…baby,” Rio panted. “<em>Please,<em>” she didn’t know what she was saying anymore. Just letting whatever tumble out of her mouth.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha circled her nipple with her tongue before biting, and Rio screamed. She was going to come, yeah, that was it she was done.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you dare,” Agatha told her. She’d clearly felt the signs of Rio about to fall over the edge. “You won’t until I tell you to.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. Agatha stopped her movement, and Rio forced out a:<br/>
</p><p>“Yes.”<br/>
</p><p>“Good.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned her attention to the other breast.<br/>
</p><p>Rio clenched her stomach to keep the orgasm at bay. She could feel her body heating, felt sweat oozing out of her skin. She wouldn’t be surprised if she passed out.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha continued littering her body with kisses and hickeys as well as trailing her nails along Rio’s skin. At every bruise, every kiss, every scratch, Rio’s body twitched. Her hips lifting, her body shuddering, her core dripping.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, she was not coming out of this alive.<br/>
</p><p>“Please,” Rio got out desperately. She knew it was futile. She wouldn’t get what she wanted until Agatha was ready to give it to her; her actions early made sure of that. But she had to try. “Please, baby. I can’t…I <em>can’t.<em>”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You can and you will,” Agatha told her before shoving three fingers in knuckles deep.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s body lifted off the floor, and with a firm hand to her stomach, Agatha pushed her back down. The pace she started with was fast and punishing.<br/>
</p><p>“Jesus, you’re so fucking wet.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t think, but she knew Agatha wanted a response, and if she didn’t supply her with one, the fingers inside of her would pull out.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s…you…for-” she cut herself off when Agatha’s thumb pressed against her clit. “You,” Rio got out in a strangled moan.<br/>
</p><p>“Duh,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>If Rio was in the right state of mind, she probably would’ve hit her, but because she wasn’t…<br/>
</p><p>“Please. I can’t.” Tears began to prick her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ignored her, her three fingers returning to their devious pace.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know how long had passed, how long she’d been clenching her body to fight off her orgasm until Agatha said:<br/>
</p><p>“Come for me, love.”<br/>
</p><p>It was all she needed. She let her body relax, and the orgasm ripped through her, a strangled moan tearing out of her throat. Her body shuddered from the release, and she felt a rush of wetness leak from her core.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s fingers didn’t stop, of course, and the next thing Rio felt was her tongue. Yeah, Rio wasn’t surviving this.<br/>
</p><p>“I can-”<br/>
</p><p>“Should’ve thought about that earlier,” Agatha mumbled against her centre.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s tongue circled her entrance, and Rio’s body stuttered to life again as if it hadn’t just found its release.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lapped at her core, and in moments, Rio was gone again. Her orgasm pulling her body taut, and another cry of pleasure leaving her lips.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fucked her three more times before she stopped.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay, baby?” Agatha asked as she pulled Rio into her arms.<br/>
</p><p>“Never better,” Rio replied dazed as her wife’s fingers ran through her hair.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you need? Water? A shower?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” was all Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>They didn’t move for another twenty minutes. Agatha simply held her, stroking her hair and pressing soft kisses to her forehead.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked awake. After her wife had washed her down in the shower, Rio fell asleep in Agatha’s arms, although Agatha was no longer there. The sun was gone so Rio figured she’d probably slept for a good six hours.<br/>
</p><p>“Ri?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned towards the door and there Alice stood. She rubbed her eyes to make sure she wasn’t hallucinating. Was she still high, or was Alice really there? She squeezed her eyes shut, reopened them, and there Alice was.<br/>
</p><p>“Al…what’s wrong?” She’d noticed Alice’s mascara smudged underneath her eyes. Her best friend was not a crier, so whatever this was, it was <em>bad<em>.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Al?” She opened her arms, and Alice ran into them.<br/>
</p><p>She squeezed Alice tightly and didn’t let go until Alice pulled away.<br/>
</p><p>“Me and Jen had a fight.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio patted the bed next to her and waited for Alice to get settled before asking:<br/>
</p><p>“Want to talk about it?”<br/>
</p><p>“I told her I loved her; she didn’t say it back.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked. They hadn’t said it yet? She and Alice had this conversation almost four months ago, and she knew Jen felt the same way, Agatha had told her. She didn’t say this, though.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine. I know it’s probably hard for her to say that shit, you know the rich and their emotionally unavailable parents.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed because she did, her own wife popping into her mind.<br/>
</p><p>“And I get she has a lot of shit,” Alice continued. “But so, do I. I didn’t pull the dead Mom card, but you think she would think about that, right? She said I ambushed her with it. I don’t think I did…I mean, now I’m not sure, but we were lying in bed and I just told her, and she got mad.”<br/>
</p><p>“You didn’t do anything wrong, Al. You just told her how you feel.” She rubbed soothingly along her best friend's arm.<br/>
</p><p>“I should’ve waited,” Alice mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio said firmly. “This isn’t your fault. I told you, there is no right time. She could’ve reacted this way whenever you told her. You weren’t to know.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice nodded. “Can I stay here tonight? I don’t think I can go home.”<br/>
</p><p>“Of course,” Rio told her. “We can order takeout and do whatever you want.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice looked up at her then, her eyes had been glued to the bed throughout the duration of their conversation. “Can we go to a bar and get really fucked up?”<br/>
</p><p>Now, Rio shouldn’t do this because there was still weed in her system, and the last time, she mixed weed and alcohol, she whited and threw her guts up for an hour straight.<br/>
</p><p>But Alice needed her.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” she grinned. “Let’s get fucked up.”</p>

<p>The threats had stopped as soon as Agatha had told Rio about them. Over the last three months that unknown number was radio silent, as if they knew Rio knew now and the gig was up, the prank was over. Well, to whoever had sent Agatha spiralling for three days straight for no fucking reason she hoped they had a special place in hell reserved for them, preferably next to her so she could torment them for eternity.<br/>
</p><p>Nobody had attempted to hurt Rio in public or during missions either. It was as if the threat simply…vanished. It was unsettling. For two days it was clear someone was after Rio. Had they suddenly lost interest, and if so, <em>why?<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio would always let Agatha rant about her concerns for hours on end until she’d soothe her with reassuring words…or actions…or sex. Lots of sex.<br/>
</p><p>But it really did seem like they were safe now; these last three months had proven that.<br/>
</p><p>They’d completed all their missions flawlessly (apart from the one with the safe (Agatha still had no regrets)), they’d convinced Wanda to let Nicky stay with them on weekends if they didn’t have a mission, and Agatha was hopelessly in love.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah…she wasn’t all that thrilled about it at first. As much as she was a hopeless romantic at her core, it still terrified her just as it did the first time she fell in love. Rio wasn’t Wanda, far from it, but to get used to that loss of control again was haunting. She wasn’t proud of it, but sometimes she’d take it out on Rio. Snapping at her for no reason, getting pissed off over nothing, but her wife, her wonderful, amazing wife saw right through her bullshit.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wasn’t perfect but she was perfect for Agatha, and Agatha only hoped she was perfect for her wife as well.<br/>
</p><p>Now…had she told Rio she loved her yet? No, nope, nada. She would...eventually? No, she would…<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed on the kitchen island, and she wasn’t surprised when she saw who it was. It was probably an explanation for why her wife had shown up on their doorstop with mascara running down her face.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d you do?” Agatha asked once she answered the phone.<br/>
</p><p>“Did she look okay?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s been crying if that’s what you’re asking.”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend muttered obscenities under her breath.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d you do?” Agatha repeated.<br/>
</p><p>“I fucked up,” Jen replied.<br/>
</p><p>“I see that…so I ask again…what’d you do?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen huffed. “I’m too sober to have this conversation with you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to see Rio poking her head out from behind the wall.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s up?”<br/>
</p><p>“Me and Alice are going to go out tonight, she needs it.”<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” Jen mumbled on the phone.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that Jen?” Rio asked, her voice laced with irritation.<br/>
</p><p>Whatever Jen did, her wife was not happy about it.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied. “Have fun, I’ll send you $500.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked at her. “What for?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “So nobody buys you drinks. Your night out is on me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head playfully. “You know I have my own money, right?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah…your money is your money; my money is <em>our<em> money. I would’ve just told you to take my card, but I know you wouldn’t use it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You know me so well,” Rio said dramatically before going over to kiss her on the cheek.<br/>
</p><p>“Hello?” Jen’s voice said through the phone.<br/>
</p><p>Rio gestured she was leaving, and Agatha nodded, stealing one last kiss.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, go on,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>“So what I’m hearing is you're free tonight. Good, we’re going out for dinner and drinks.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m guessing I don’t have a choice in the matter.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nope, meet me at Nobu Downtown at 8:30, and don’t be fucking late.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha cackled before Jen hung up.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>An hour later, Agatha was sitting across from her best friend, who was drinking her third martini, an array of sushi on the table before them.<br/>
</p><p>“Why aren’t you drinking?” Jen asked as Agatha took a sip of water.<br/>
</p><p>“I think at least one of us should be sober tonight, don’t you think? Your wife and mine are going bar hopping, and you look like you’re about to drown your sorrows in that glass.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio had told her what type of night this was looking like for her and Alice. And because Agatha wasn’t going to be with her, she wanted to be alert just in case something happened, and Rio needed her. Alice had picked out a skin tight deep green top that showed <em>a lot<em> of boob for Rio to wear tonight. And her wife, as adorable as she was, had asked if she’d be okay with her wearing it. Agatha reminded Rio that she was a grown woman, and she could wear whatever she wanted, she also reminded her that she knew how to fight and owned a gun, plural.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her wife and her best friend were going to have a time tonight.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you finally going to tell me what you did now?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “Alice told me she loved me.”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s great…” Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “What’s the problem then?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen knocked back her martini and then signalled to a waiter to get her another.<br/>
</p><p>“You didn’t say it back?” Agatha asked, already connecting the dots.<br/>
</p><p>“Worse.”<br/>
</p><p>“Worse?” Agatha echoed. “The fuck did you do?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen shook her glass, trying to get the last drop.<br/>
</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to roll her eyes. “Spit it out, Kale.”<br/>
</p><p>“I got mad at her for it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her hands up, exasperated. “And why’d you do that? I thought you loved her.”<br/>
</p><p>“I <em>do<em>,” Jen told her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Then why on earth would you get mad at her?”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know, I don’t know,” Jen spluttered. “I just…I thought it would be easy, you know? Like you just say it, and everybody sings Kumbaya around the fire.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>“But then she said it and I just…froze. I’ve never said it before, and nobody’s ever said it to me in that way. And, fuck, you know we never got that shit growing up. People only wanted me for my looks or my money nobody ever <em>loved<em> me. Hell, I don’t even think my own parents love me half the time.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow because everything Jen was saying? Story of her life.<br/>
</p><p>“And Alice is perfect, far too good for me, so it’s like…how and <em>why<em> does she love me? I don’t deserve her.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>A waiter arrived with Jen’s next drink.<br/>
</p><p>“Fucking finally,” Jen grumbled before taking a large gulp. “God, no wonder people hate rich people, we have all the money in the world, and yet we still find something to complain about,” Jen joked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “It doesn’t really matter if you don’t think you deserve Alice. She clearly thinks you do otherwise, she wouldn’t have told you that, she wouldn’t have fallen in love with you.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen hummed. “I guess you’re right. Pretty sure I’ve completely fucked it now, though.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nah,” Agatha shook her head. “She’s been dealing with you for over a year now, I’m certain you’ve fucked up multiple times and look…she still stayed.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks,” Jen deadpanned.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed once more. “You’re gonna have to do that thing that we emotionally unavailable spoiled brats hate to do.”<br/>
</p><p>“And what’s that?”<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Communicate.<em>”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “I hate that shit.”<br/>
</p><p>“Me too, but you gotta do what you’ve gotta do.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen nodded. “Well, cheers to that,” she said, lifting her glass.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha followed suit, tapping their glasses together.<br/>
</p><p>“You think Sammy’s free tonight?” Jen asked after she’d taken her sip.<br/>
</p><p>“My company not good enough?” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope, I can only look at your face for so long.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha flipped her off.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Now Agatha sat across from two of her best friends, they both had martinis in hand and were both beyond the point of drunk.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you…do you remember the summer of '08?” Samuel asked.<br/>
</p><p>This was the first time Agatha had seen him since The Met mission, and after questioning why she and her wife and his friend disappeared into thin air right before the auction started for the first ten minutes after his arrival, Samuel had knocked back five shots with Jen and had since dropped the subject. Agatha was glad for her years of learning how to masterfully dodge questions.<br/>
</p><p>“Was that the summer we broke Agatha out of that troubled teens camp?” Jen cackled.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s the one,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“I remember,” Jen replied. “You just got your license, and you had to drive upstate, and you almost crashed the car four times!”<br/>
</p><p>“Did not…it was three times.”<br/>
</p><p>Samuel’s response earned a laugh from both Jen and Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“God, my mother was so mad when I finally returned home for school.”<br/>
</p><p>After breaking Agatha out of camp, they spent the remaining weeks of summer at Samuel’s house in the Hamptons. It was one of Agatha’s more promiscuous summers. She was sixteen and had a lot of abuse to try and forget about.<br/>
</p><p>“Didn’t you sleep with one of Sammy’s housekeepers?”<br/>
</p><p>“And his Mom,” Agatha winked.<br/>
</p><p>Samuel rolled his eyes as Jen grinned. It was a life long joke, Samuel had a hot mom, Agatha would tell him she’d sleep with her.<br/>
</p><p>“Wasn’t that the year you started sleeping with our Spanish teacher?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“What is with you and older women?” Samuel said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Unchecked mommy issues.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen and Samuel raised an eyebrow offering a ‘Fair enough.’<br/>
</p><p>“How old is Rio?”<br/>
</p><p>“Our age.”<br/>
</p><p>“Shocker,” Samuel laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Speaking of,” Agatha picked her phone off the table. “My wife’s calling.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio and Alice were at their third bar for the night. They were both far too drunk for their own good. They always got their shots four at a time, and Rio was sure her liver would need pumping by the end of the night. It did occur to her that one of them should probably be less drunk than the other, but they were FBI agents, even paralytic, she was sure she could kill someone.<br/>
</p><p>Alice tugged her into the centre of the dance floor as Rihanna’s <em>Rude Boy<em> boomed through the speakers. Rio took her best friend's hand and spun her, earning a giggle from Alice as she staggered.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The bar was filled to the brim and Rio had to hold her steady, so she didn’t knock into anyone. They bounced up and down, screaming the lyrics into each other’s faces. Alice nodded at Rio’s chest and when Rio went to look her boob was popping out of her top. Whoops. She laughed as she shoved it back in.<br/>
</p><p>Unfortunately, a fucking man had watched her do it and took that as an invitation to pester them. Because men and their fucking audacity the man shoved his way between them so now Rio was looking at a man instead of her best friend. With one swift movement, she pushed the man back with a firm hand to his face. The man stumbled into the sea of people behind him.<br/>
</p><p>“Bitch,” he muttered when he’d righted himself.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Rio yelled because she was drunk and couldn’t help herself. She could take down a man easily.<br/>
</p><p>“Okayyy,” Alice said, dragging her best friend away from the scene.<br/>
</p><p>It was on to bar number four.<br/>
</p><p>“We didn’t have to leave,” Rio told her as they walked to the next location.<br/>
</p><p>“We did, I know you,” Alice laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio giggled. “No, you’re right. I forgot what it’s like to not be with an enabler. Agatha would’ve been cheering me on, hell, she’d join in. Oh, wait, shit sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio needed to stop doing that, bringing up her wife and her happy fucking marriage as if her best friend wasn’t in a rough patch with hers.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re good,” Alice told her with a smile. “I’m happy for you. You were never a people person, so the fact that you’ve found someone who you genuinely seem to like? You can talk about your wife for as long as you want.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. She loved Alice so much, and because she was drunk, she’d actually tell her. “I love you. I’m annoyed we never got to do this in our twenties.”<br/>
</p><p>“What? Because we’re thirty, we can’t have fun?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shoved her playfully. “That’s not what I meant! I mean, I’m annoyed we weren’t friends anymore, I should’ve called you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Me too,” Alice walked into the bar, Rio behind her. “But there’s no point dwelling on the past, we’re here now.”<br/>
</p><p>They got up on the bar stools and waited for a bartender to serve them. This bar was quieter than the last one.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I buy you a drink?” A woman’s voice rang out from behind Alice.<br/>
</p><p>Before her best friend could reply, Rio jumped in, “She’s happily married actually so you can fuck off.”<br/>
</p><p>The stranger blinked before promptly scurrying off.<br/>
</p><p>“Ri!” Alice scolded with a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged. “What? I’m pissed at Jen right now but that doesn’t mean other people can flirt with you. We’re still that lesbian friend group that people see in passing and wish it were them. We still sing Kumbaya around the fire.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice’s smile faltered. “Jen says that all the time,” she whispered.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh. Idiot.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Okay, no. No being sad, you need more shots.”<br/>
</p><p>They did more shots, they did more dancing and somehow, it was two in the morning. The women stood outside the bar, staring at their phones as the Uber app told both of them that they were still ‘looking for a driver.’ It had said that for twenty minutes.<br/>
</p><p>“Where’s a yellow cab when you fucking need one,” Rio huffed. “Fuck this.”<br/>
</p><p>She cancelled her Uber and told Alice to do the same before she dialled. Agatha picked up after the first ring.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay, love?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. She’d never get tired of hearing her wife’s voice. “Hi, baby,” Rio drawled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Hi, sweetheart. Are you okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“Uber is useless, can you come pick us up…please?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah. I’ll leave now.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thankkk youuu. I don’t know where I am, so you’re gonna have to look at my location.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed again. “I’ve been tracking you all night, I’ve got it.”<br/>
</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to laugh. “Stalker.”<br/>
</p><p>She could tell her wife was grinning when she said, “I’ll see you soon.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re my favourite,” Rio told her before hanging up the phone.<br/>
</p><p>When she looked up, Alice was looking at her with a wide smile.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scowled. “What?”<br/>
</p><p>Alice shook her head as a nothing.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Alice crashed on Rio’s bed as soon as they got back. Rio was going to sleep with her tonight, but she wanted to see Agatha before she went to bed. Her wife had made her toast with Nutella and coaxed her into drinking water, even as Rio protested.<br/>
</p><p>Now, Agatha was sitting on Rio’s stomach, tenderly wiping her makeup off with makeup wipes. Rio was lying down, looking up at her. Agatha was so beautiful.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife’s eyebrows furrowed. “What’s wrong?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio tilted her head. Agatha wiped underneath her eyes with her thumb.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re crying.”<br/>
</p><p>“I am?” Rio patted her face with her fingers. “I am!” She giggled. “I’m sorry I can’t help it, I’m drunk and you’re just so fucking beautiful.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes with a laugh. “You’ve never been so sappy whilst drunk.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio flung her arms around lazily. “It’s the weed.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, okay,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rested her hands on her wife’s hips, stroking the bare skin between her pyjama shorts and top. And they were <em>hers<em> because Agatha had developed a habit of stealing all her nightwear.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I remember when we first met, I swore I would never call you beautiful because you were so cocky, and I didn’t want to boost your annoyingly high ego. You already knew I found you attractive anyway.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Doesn’t everyone?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shoved her, and Agatha wobbled before righting herself.<br/>
</p><p>“Shut up.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned down again and continued taking off Rio’s makeup. This close, Rio could see Agatha’s eyes in full. She took them in, from the dark blue that outlined her irises to the lighter blue with specks of grey that filled them.<br/>
</p><p>“Quit staring at me, I can’t focus.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio ran her hand up Agatha’s spine. “How could I not stare at you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before planting a soft kiss on Rio’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>“You are going to have to close your eyes now, though. I have to take off your eye shadow.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed but did as she was told.<br/>
</p><p>She felt the warm pads of Agatha’s fingers trail along her jaw as she wiped at her eyelids. Rio inhaled deeply, letting her wife’s fragrance consume her. Rio was more than happy to die like this.<br/>
</p><p>Moments later, Agatha said:<br/>
</p><p>“Done.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyelids fluttered open, and a lazy smile painted her lips at her wife staring down at her. Her hair had fallen around them, acting like a curtain, shielding them from the world.<br/>
</p><p>“You ready to go to bed?” Agatha asked as she sat up.<br/>
</p><p>“I could go to bed.” Rio slid her hand down to rest on her wife’s ass, “Or…”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha laughed, climbing off of her.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” Rio pouted.<br/>
</p><p>“Because you are drunk and I am sober, my love.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio groaned. “So?”<br/>
</p><p>“Soo…that doesn’t work. We don’t fuck unless you consent, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>“I am consenting, I’m the one who wants this,” Rio said, propping herself up.<br/>
</p><p>“Doesn’t work, there’s a power imbalance.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thought you liked the power imbalance,” Rio smirked.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha replied, “When it’s consensual.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shuffled up on the bed until she was close enough to kiss Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Good night, mi amor,” Agatha mumbled against her lips.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pouted again, grumbling a: “Good night.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed before kissing her one last time.</p>

<p>She had barely seen Rio in three days.<br/>
</p><p>It’s not like Agatha was mad about it or anything. Alice needed her because she didn’t want to go home yet, and Jen hadn’t spoken to her even though Agatha had told her to. Alice had been at theirs, and Agatha had been at Jen’s.<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend was having melt down after melt down and wasn’t doing the one thing that would actually fucking help…<em>communicating with her wife.<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha wouldn’t judge her, though, couldn’t. She understood. She’d told Rio about how her mother had treated her, told her about some of what her childhood was like, but she hadn’t told her about Wanda, about her relationship with her father. She knew she knew more about Rio than Rio knew about her. But like Jen said…communicating? Yeah, the emotionally unavailable rich brats that they were didn’t know how to do that<br/>
</p><p>Rio was getting ready to meet Alice at a café in Brooklyn to prepare her for when she went home. Alice thought that enough was enough; she also felt bad for staying at their house for so long. Agatha genuinely didn’t mind, and Rio was more than happy to let Alice stay longer, but Alice declined their offer.<br/>
</p><p>That said, because Alice had been staying at theirs, Rio had been sleeping in her room with her. Agatha hadn’t shared a bed with her wife in <em>three days.<em> They hadn’t fucked in three days. Agatha didn’t want to say she was losing her mind…but, yeah, she was losing her mind.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>After showering, she dried herself off with her towel, pulled on deep green laced underwear, moisturised her skin, and reached for her t-shirt. She froze, her hand hovering over the item of clothing. She could put it on…or…<br/>
</p><p>She stepped out of the bathroom and into the bedroom, frowning when her wife was no longer there. She wouldn’t have left yet, not without saying goodbye. Agatha ventured into the hallway and smirked when she heard rustling down the other end in the study.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stopped at the threshold, watching her wife move pieces of paper and lift objects off the desks. Agatha knocked.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, baby, have you seen my…<em>holy.<em>” Rio’s jaw dropped as she gaped at her mostly naked wife.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Have I seen your…” Agatha asked innocently, slowly entering the room with her hands clasped behind her back to reveal as much of herself as possible to her wife.<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked before she said a curt, “No. No, I don’t have time. I’m already running late because I can’t find my fucking keys.”<br/>
</p><p>“Well…if you’re already running late,” Agatha said, walking further into the room. “What’s a few more minutes?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Because it won’t <em>be<em> a few more minutes, will it?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha shrugged, that faux innocence on display again. “That’s up to you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, it is,” her wife replied. “So I’m saying no.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned. Rio wasn’t saying no.<br/>
</p><p>When she was close enough to touch her wife, she pushed at her shoulders until Rio stepped back. She tried to resist, but three steps later, Rio was dropping into the desk chair behind her.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you still saying no?” Agatha asked, as her body trapped Rio’s in the chair beneath her.<br/>
</p><p>She slid her hands down Rio’s neck as she lowered herself onto one of Rio’s thighs.<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back, breathing out a frustrated sigh. Agatha knew she was fighting for her life right now, which meant there was only one thing left to do.<br/>
</p><p>She rolled her hips forward, grinding against Rio’s thigh. Rio’s head snapped forward the same time her hands flew to Agatha’s hips, gripping to encourage her wife on. Agatha smirked. It was too easy. Rio watched as Agatha continued to roll her hips, taking her time with it. Rio bit her bottom lip as breathy sounds escaped from her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife watched the movements as if she were in a trance, and Agatha couldn’t help but smirk further as the pressure built.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, no,” Rio said weakly. “I don’t have time.” It was pathetic, she was already trapped.<br/>
</p><p>She cautiously lifted Agatha off her thigh.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re going to have to change anyway, there’s no point in stopping now,” Agatha said, looking down at the jeans she was just sitting on.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows before following her wife’s eyeline. “For fucksake,” she muttered, because Agatha had ruined her jeans.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d you say, baby?” Agatha said, batting her eyelashes, “You have time now?”<br/>
</p><p>“I hate you so much,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>And before Agatha could tell her that she didn’t, Rio surged forward, capturing her lips in a searing kiss. Agatha laughed before Rio’s lips muffled the sound. Rio had never and would never say no to her.<br/>
</p><p>Now <em>that<em> was power.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her wife reached behind her and wiped the desk clear of all paper and stationery, they crashed to the floor with a clang. Rio grabbed her hips and lifted her onto the now empty desk. Agatha clung onto Rio’s neck for dear life as her wife consumed her. Rio’s tongue slid mercilessly into her mouth, Rio’s hands slid up to fist her hair, Rio’s body pressed harshly against her own.<br/>
</p><p>The message was clear: Rio wanted this one. And because she was making her wife late, she’d let her have it.<br/>
</p><p>She’d let Rio take control.<br/>
</p><p>Rio dipped her head down to press open-mouth kisses to Agatha’s neck. She groaned at the feeling, letting her body go limp as a firm arm wrapped around her back to keep her up. Her head fell back, the action would’ve made Agatha fall with it if Rio’s arm wasn’t there.<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit, sucked and kissed at her pulse point. That was definitely going to leave a mark.<br/>
</p><p>“Marking me up, are we?” Agatha teased breathlessly.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re making me late,” Rio mumbled against her skin. “You deserve to wear a turtle neck for a couple of days.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed before the sound turned into a moan as Rio licked up her neck to her earlobe before nipping it, just how she liked it.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha murmured. “<em>Fuck, fuck, fuck,<em>” she chanted as Rio grabbed at one of her breasts and lifted her knee to press against Agatha’s centre.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The other hand ran down Agatha’s side, following the curve. Agatha shuddered, the action was so delicate, so purposeful that it made the hairs on her arms stand up. Oh, she was so fucked. She realised she’d let Rio do any and everything she wanted to do to her.<br/>
</p><p>That was fucking scary.<br/>
</p><p>She’d already lost control of her emotions when it came to Rio, and now, she was giving her body to her too? The lack of control was dizzying and yet she still wasn’t fighting back. She was willingly letting Rio dominate her.<br/>
</p><p>When had Rio gotten down there? Now her wife was on her knees, spreading her legs open.<br/>
</p><p>“Sneaky,” Rio taunted as she pulled down Agatha’s underwear. “You knew I wouldn’t be able to resist you wearing these.”<br/>
</p><p>It was only then Agatha realised she was wearing Rio’s favourite colour. She had to admit, she hadn’t done it on purpose. Once Rio had told her what it was, Agatha had gone out and bought an absurd amount of green underwear. This was just a happy accident.<br/>
</p><p>“You wouldn’t have been able to resist me anyway,” Agatha panted.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed. “Hmm,” she hummed before yanking Agatha’s legs onto her shoulders and taking her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s back arched as Rio’s flat tongue licked up her entire core.<br/>
</p><p>“Jesus,” another stroke, “Fuck,” another stroke, “Rio!”<br/>
</p><p>She felt the tip of Rio’s nose in her core and knew that if her wife kept that up, she’d stop breathing, but right now, Agatha couldn’t bring herself to care. The added pressure plus Rio’s tongue had her eyes rolling into the back of her head.<br/>
</p><p>Rio gripped around her thighs harshly as Agatha rolled her hips forward to meet her wife’s tongue. She was so close, so, so close and then…Rio fucking stopped. She pulled back, and Agatha met brown eyes…well…black eyes. Rio’s pupils had engulfed her beautiful irises.<br/>
</p><p>“You better be joking,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio said nothing, just looked up at her. Agatha knew how vulnerable she looked right now, her chest rising and falling rapidly, her lips swollen, her hair a mess and sticking to her body. It was almost too much.<br/>
</p><p>“Why did you stop?” Agatha shrieked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged. Rio fucking shrugged as if she wasn’t seconds away from making Agatha fall over the edge.<br/>
</p><p>“You thought I’d let you have what you wanted so easily?”<br/>
</p><p>“You were the one who said you didn’t want to be late; you were the one who couldn’t keep your hands off me three days ago!” Agatha complained, the denied release spurring on her frustration.<br/>
</p><p>“And you’re the one making me late.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha knew Rio wasn’t actually annoyed about that, but she was using it against her anyway.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, I swear to god if you don’t-”<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Rio sat back, thoroughly amused.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked at her. Why was she being difficult today of all fucking days. They hadn’t fucked in three days! She was starved.<br/>
</p><p>“Then I’ll do it myself” Agatha shot back.<br/>
</p><p>A wicked smile painted Rio’s lips. “Go on then.” She sat cross-legged.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, I…” Agatha started. She hadn’t fucking meant it! Ever since her wife first touched her, she knew doing it on her own would never do the trick again. But she wouldn’t let Rio know that; instead, she said. “Fine. I will.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha started moving her hand until Rio shot up and grabbed it.<br/>
</p><p>She smirked. “Thought I was doing it.”<br/>
</p><p>“And I thought you were smarter than that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Taking a leaf out of my book?”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, I’m taking more than that,” Rio said, her voice low, raspy.<br/>
</p><p>She moved Agatha’s hand behind the desk and slowly pressed three fingers inside. Agatha’s body awoke again, her back arching on cue.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re not stopping until you’re begging,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>A steady grin spread across Agatha’s lips. “I can take it. I’ve always been stronger than you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened as she cupped Agatha, sliding her entire palm underneath the wetness below. Agatha let out a pathetic whimper.<br/>
</p><p>“We’ll see about that, sweetheart,” Rio nodded patronisingly.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t give Agatha time to breathe before she felt those three fingers again, but this time they curled, and Agatha screamed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t breathe, let alone think straight. Her wife had fucked her…she actually didn’t know how many times. She’d wanted this, said all the right things to make sure of it. But Rio was a machine. What was she on? Five Red Bulls? A gallon of coffee? Pre-workout? Why wasn’t she tired yet?<br/>
</p><p>“Baby…baby,” Agatha mumbled. “I can’t.”<br/>
</p><p>She was exhausted, drenched in her own sweat and sensitive.<br/>
</p><p>“You can do one more,” Rio soothed, her fingers still pumping. Her voice had lost its harsh edge two rounds ago. “You can do that for me, can’t you?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck why did she have to ask so nicely?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha forced her head to nod.<br/>
</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio cooed.<br/>
</p><p>“You know I can’t – hm,” Agatha got out as Rio’s thumb rubbed her clit. “You know I can’t say…say no when you talk to me like that.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “That’s why I do it. Come on, love, come for me. Please.”<br/>
</p><p>On command, Agatha’s body locked up, her thighs shaking around Rio’s hand as a small gasp left her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“There you go,” Rio said softly.<br/>
</p><p>Once the wave passed, Rio pulled her into her arms. Agatha didn’t have the energy to hold her, she just let her arms stay limp around Rio’s body. Her wife stroked her damp hair.<br/>
</p><p>“You, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>She barely had the energy to nod.<br/>
</p><p>“You did so well for me,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know how long they stayed like that until Rio muttered:<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck.”<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Agatha whispered, not having the energy to make her voice louder.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m two hours late.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh. Tell Alice I’ll send her a present as an apology.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “You’re going to have to.”<br/>
</p><p>They settled into a comfortable silence.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t want to leave…but I might have to,” Rio spoke moments later.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s alright. Go,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“You sure?” Rio asked, pulling back.<br/>
</p><p>“Positive.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio leaned forward and planted a deep kiss on Agatha’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>“I miss you already,” Rio told her as she moved away from her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes playfully.<br/>
</p><p>“Would you look at that,” Rio said by the door.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned to look at her and Rio was bending down. She shook the keys dangling from her finger.<br/>
</p><p>“Found my keys.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled as Rio left the room.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>She had five missed calls from Alice. Rio had tried to call her back, but the phone went straight to voicemail. She ran across Brooklyn to their café, but when she stepped inside…well, she hadn’t expected to see that.<br/>
</p><p>Alice sat across from Jen, her mascara running down her face <em>again.<em> Rio loved Jen, but if she made her best friend cry one more time this week, she’d be prepared to kill her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She waited for Alice to catch her eye. Her best friend mouthed that she was okay.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re sure?” Rio mouthed across the café.<br/>
</p><p>Alice nodded. “Text you later.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen turned then and Rio narrowed her eyes at her. Jen looked genuinely terrified. Good.<br/>
</p><p>She looked at Alice one more time before leaving. That conversation better be Jen apologising profusely and then buying Alice whatever she wanted otherwise there was going to be a problem.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Alice texted a few hours later, saying that she and Jen were good again. And that was good…for Jen because there was no telling what Rio would’ve done if she’d hurt her best friend again. One thing about Rio, she didn’t play about the people she cared about.<br/>
</p><p>“The happy couple are happy again,” Agatha announced when she walked into the living room.<br/>
</p><p>“Jen told you, too?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Thank fuck. We can all be one big family again,” she teased.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “You know what we should do?”<br/>
</p><p>“Invite them over and smoke?” Agatha asked, dropping into Rio’s lap.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “How’d you know I was going to say that?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m in your skin.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shuddered. “You’re gonna give me the heebie jeebies.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cackled. “Yeah, let’s do it. Why do you want to smoke so much all of a sudden?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve got the good stuff.”<br/>
</p><p>“I see,” Agatha replied with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>And that’s how the evening was spent. The four wives lighting up and then gorging on everything in Agatha and Rio’s pantry. They laughed at nothing and ranted about the state of the world, and for once, a mission didn’t interrupt them.</p>

<p>Rio really did feel like she was in <em>Miss Congeniality.<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>After she and Agatha had watched the film three months ago, Rio swore she was living it.<br/>
</p><p>It turned out she was not as graceful as she thought she could pretend to be. It was the last phase of the Miss America mission where they’d been assigned to protect high-profile judge Judge Matthews’ daughter, Kalani-Rose.<br/>
</p><p>After the luncheon shoot-out, all Miss America events had been postponed until last week where they had a dress rehearsal. There was nothing wrong with the way Rio walked, she knew how to keep her posture, etc, but compared to the other girls? Rio looked like a newborn giraffe staggering about the stage.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, and to top it all off, she didn’t have a fucking talent. Well, not one that she could use. It wasn’t like she could tackle five men on stage, or spout out knowledge about plants, or shoot at objects. It wasn’t like the movie; she couldn’t call someone up and start displaying self-defence moves.<br/>
</p><p>She and Agatha had to think of something on the spot, salsa dancing. It wouldn’t have been her first choice, but they didn’t have much time to work with. Rio picked moves she remembered and strung them into a routine before the mock judges. She wouldn’t say they were impressed, but they hadn’t booed her off stage or thrown tomatoes at her, so she’d taken it as a win.<br/>
</p><p>For the next week leading up to the pageant, she practised her dance moves, her walk, her speeches. And Agatha, her easily irritated wife had been surprisingly patient with her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s patience was on display again as Rio pulled at her bikini minutes before she had to go on stage.<br/>
</p><p>“I fucking,” she lifted the bikini top, “Hate,” she pulled at it again, “This shit. Fuck, why can’t this cover more of me!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wasn’t insecure about her body, she looked after it, had to, she was an FBI agent. But having it on display for thousands of people in a live audience was something else. They’d all be analysing and judging it, <em>her.<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>The only people she’d want to see her in a bikini were her best friends and her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“If it helps, you look good,” Agatha smiled from where she sat at Rio’s assigned vanity.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to have to agree,” Kalani-Rose said from behind her. She was wearing a deep blue one-piece littered with rhinestones, her Miss New York sash slid across it. “Deep greens your colour.”  She walked to Rio’s side before adjusting her sash. “It was wonky,” Kalani-Rose said before running a hand across Rio’s stomach as she left for her own vanity.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt her wife tense next to her.<br/>
</p><p>Another problem on Rio’s long list was <em>that.<em> Kalani-Rose’s relentless flirting. Every time she did it in front of Agatha, her wife’s hand would twitch towards her gun. Rio wasn’t sure how well that would end, Agatha murdering the person they were supposed to protect. Rio couldn’t even stop her flirting either, if she was too harsh, Kalani-Rose wouldn’t want to be around her, and then how would she protect her?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She turned to face her, and Agatha was glaring at Kalani-Rose with a look Rio could only describe as murderous.<br/>
</p><p>“What if, somehow, Kalani-Rose got food poisoning, and she couldn’t compete anymore, and then we’d get to go home. Hypothetically…what would you think?”<br/>
</p><p>“I think you need to calm down before that vein in your forehead bursts,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>She wished she didn’t have to calm her wife down. Jealous Agatha? Yeah, it was the hottest thing Rio had ever seen, so she could thank Kalani-Rose for that. But they were on a mission, and she couldn’t risk her wife spiralling and putting it in jeopardy.<br/>
</p><p>“Can all the girls get into the wings, please? Show starts in five,” one of the stage managers announced.<br/>
</p><p>The other pageant contestants started shuffling out of the room.<br/>
</p><p>“Good luck,” Agatha told her. “Don’t fall on your face.”<br/>
</p><p>“Gee, how helpful,” Rio deadpanned.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife leaned in before Rio drew back with a slight shake of her head. Agatha cleared her throat as she remembered they were at work. Rio was really starting to dislike missions where they couldn’t act like the married couple they were supposed to be.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on, Rio,” Kalani-Rose said, grabbing her hand and dragging her away from her wife.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>After two hours of parading around in a bikini with a smile glued to her face and answering numerous questions, Rio was finally done with the swimsuit portion of the pageant. She wanted to shower. She was covered in body glitter, and she smelled hairspray whenever she moved after the absurd amount of it Agatha had put in her hair to keep her 90s blowout in place.<br/>
</p><p>Rio slumped into her chair and rested her head against her vanity. She was exhausted and there was still the talent portion, and the evening gowns and interviews left to go.<br/>
</p><p>“Well I never,” a voice said from behind her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked up, and in the mirror, she saw the owner of said voice.<br/>
</p><p>There was no fucking way.<br/>
</p><p>“Nat?” Rio asked as she stared back at the redhead in the mirror. She turned, and there she was. Natasha Romanov.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s ex-girlfriend.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, pretty girl,” Natasha said, walking over to her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio got up and hugged her.<br/>
</p><p>This was the relationship Rio had woken up one day and realised it wasn’t meant to be. Rio worked too much, so rarely got to see Natasha, and Natasha had always hated how cagey Rio was when talking about herself. Rio never pointed out that Natasha was cagey, too.<br/>
</p><p>Their relationship had ended six years ago on a good note. They were still each other’s number one booty call. Well, until Rio’s Abuela died, and she got married.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled back. “What are you doing here?”<br/>
</p><p>“Could ask you the same thing,” Natasha replied, her eyes taking in Rio’s appearance, the deep green bikini and Miss Delaware sash.<br/>
</p><p>“I asked you first,” Rio shot back like a child.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha smiled, that disarming smile that Rio remembered all too well.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s own lips twitched into a smile.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha pulled something out of her back pocket and revealed it to Rio. Her mouth dropped.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve been an FBI agent this whole time?” Rio gaped at her.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Why the fuck didn’t you tell me? I told you! You said you worked in accounting!” Rio scream whispered so the girls in the room couldn’t hear.<br/>
</p><p>“Had a mysterious reputation to uphold,” Natasha teased.<br/>
</p><p>“How come I never saw you at work?”<br/>
</p><p>“I avoided you like the plague,” Natasha replied, a smile on her lips.<br/>
</p><p>Did Rio need glasses? Why did every person she knew work for the FBI? She’d never crossed paths with Agatha before this, nor Alice and now Natasha? Was she walking around MO with her eyes glued to the floor? Apparently.<br/>
</p><p>“So, you know why I’m here, why bother asking?”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha shrugged. “I wanted to see what you’d come up with.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back, a frustrated groan escaping her lips. “I don’t get why out of everyone they picked <em>me<em> to do this. I don't know the first thing about pageants. I'm sure there are so many beautiful women who do that the FBI could’ve chosen to do this, like you. Why couldn’t you do it?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Why would I do it when we’ve got you?” Natasha reached out to touch Rio’s hair, running her fingers through the ends. “I never told you how hot you look.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>RETREAT, RETREAT, RETREAT.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Too late.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, Agatha Smith. What’s your name?” Agatha had appeared out of seemingly nowhere. She grabbed the hand that was in Rio’s hair and shook it in what looked like a bruising handshake.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha raised an eyebrow, looking between Rio and her wife before saying:<br/>
</p><p>“Natasha.”<br/>
</p><p>“How do you know Rio, Natasha?” A sickly sweet smile plastered on Agatha’s face as if she wasn’t gritting her teeth as she spoke.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re old friends. How do you know her?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m her wi-, her pageant coach,” Agatha corrected. Rio knew her wife was most likely spiralling right now at the fact that she couldn’t claim Rio as her loving, adoring partner.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Is there any particular reason you’re in here, Natasha?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>She flashed Agatha her badge. “Just making sure the girls are safe.”<br/>
</p><p>Which was probably true. The NYPD and FBI were crawling around the entire venue. After the shootout, security regarding the pageant had increased because, to Rio’s dismay, the Miss America organisation refused to cancel the thing.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, Rio here looks unharmed.”<br/>
</p><p>“I know, I was just-”<br/>
</p><p>“You can go now,” Agatha cut her off. “Your job needs you,” she added.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha bit her lip as if to stop herself from laughing. “Okayy…” she wrapped her hand around Rio’s upper arm. “I’ll find you later,” Natasha smirked and left.<br/>
</p><p>Rio scrunched her face and prepared to look at Agatha. What condition would she find her wife in?<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs-”<br/>
</p><p>“I know all your friends. Alice and Jen, that’s it. So, who the fuck was that?”<br/>
</p><p>A few of the girls in the dressing room were looking at them now. Rio grabbed her wife’s arm and pulled her into a corner.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…she’s…well.”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha’s tone made Rio’s blood chill. “Spit. It. Out!”<br/>
</p><p>“My ex! Natasha’s my ex.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her head back, a bitter cackle leaving her mouth. “Of fucking course! The one day you have to walk around in a bikini, your ex is here.”<br/>
</p><p>“Baby,” Rio whispered. “Lower your voice.”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” Kalani-Rose was headed straight towards them.<br/>
</p><p>Why? Why couldn’t she just stay in her seat across the room, where Rio could keep an eye on her in peace?<br/>
</p><p>She forced herself to sound pleasant when she said, “Hey.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve gotten my hair stuck in my zip; can you help?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Can’t you get someone else to do it?! I’m in the middle of trying to make sure my wife doesn’t crash out.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Sure,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re an angel.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio jolted when Kalani-Rose put an arm around her waist and guided her away from her wife. Her hair wasn't fucking stuck. Rio went to turn back to look at Agatha, but Kalani-Rose turned the corner before she could.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Was this hit on Rio day or something?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was just about ready to kill someone.<br/>
</p><p>It was already bad enough their mission subject couldn’t keep her hands off her wife, and <em>now<em> Rio’s ex was here too? Her stunning ex with red hair and a long bob that she somehow managed to pull off.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha knew her wife was beautiful; she told her every chance she got, but that didn’t mean <em>other<em> people could also find her beautiful. Why were other women even looking in Rio’s direction anyway? Couldn’t they tell by looking at her that she was married? Wasn’t she oozing with after sex glow 24/7?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha immediately regretted not making the time to fuck her this morning.<br/>
</p><p>She was watching the TV backstage as the talent section of the pageant commenced. Agatha peered at the main screen where Rio was performing her salsa routine, and the wings where Kalani-Rose was stood practically fucking drooling over her wife. Matter of fact, everyone was.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned, and every person in the room had their eyes glued to the screen as Rio danced in her red salsa dress. This was getting ridiculous.<br/>
</p><p>Now, Agatha wasn’t insecure; she loved having a hot wife, loved turning heads when they walked down a street hand in hand. It was the fact that she couldn’t say Rio was her wife and instead had to watch as everyone and their mother made a move on her.<br/>
</p><p>It was the inability to do something about it that was driving Agatha mad.<br/>
</p><p>Rio finished her routine and everybody clapped, some even standing. Agatha followed her wife on the screen, where she ran off into the wings, and Kalani-Rose essentially tackled her the moment she got off stage, trapping Rio in a bear hug and pressing kisses to her forehead.<br/>
</p><p>Could Agatha kill their mission subject? She could make it seem like manslaughter; she thought Kalani-Rose was under attack and shot in her general direction and accidentally killed her…that could work.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I’m a dead shot, nobody's buying I killed someone on accident.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And for the first time ever, Agatha hated that, that was common knowledge.<br/>
</p><p>After the talent show was over, it was finally time for lunch. She could sit next to Rio and glare at anyone who was making eyes at her. Agatha made her way over to the dressing room and…oh! Of course.<br/>
</p><p>Both Natasha and Kalani-Rose were standing next to Rio. It almost looked like a tennis match, Rio was the ball and Natasha and Kalani-Rose were pulling her back and forth by THE FUCKING WAIST to get Rio closer to them.<br/>
</p><p>All Agatha wanted to do was tell them to get their fucking hands off her wife before she chopped them off. But she couldn’t say that, instead:<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, ladies. Ready for lunch?”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha didn’t look at her when she replied, “Yeah, I was telling Rio she should sit with me in the restaurant.”<br/>
</p><p>Okay…fucking rude.<br/>
</p><p>What was the charge for killing another FBI agent? With a good lawyer, Agatha figured she could get…five years? Agatha could do time for five years.<br/>
</p><p>“And <em>I<em> was telling Rio she should come out with me and the girls. Last year's winner, Isabella, will be there.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Aren’t we supposed to eat with our coaches?” Rio asked, stepping back so her body pressed slightly against Agatha’s.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha forced herself not to grin. It was a small gesture, but Rio was reaffirming that she was still hers, and these women fighting over her could touch her, but she’d always be touching Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sure your coach won’t mind. It’s not like she’s your mom,” Kalani-Rose said.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No, I’m her wife you bitch.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Erm…I guess I can go with you,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha knew she didn’t want to, but Kalani-Rose was unfortunately their mission, and Rio had to stick to her like glue.<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect!” Kalani-Rose grabbed Rio by the hand and dragged her away from Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fucking hated this mission.<br/>
</p><p>She glanced at Natasha who was watching Rio’s ass as she walked away. Was she serious? Rio wasn’t a piece of fucking meat!<br/>
</p><p>She stepped in front of Natasha’s view, blocking it. “Do you fucking mind?” Agatha bit out.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha stepped back with her hands up in surrender. “She won’t mind me looking, trust me.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t,” Agatha shot back. “If I catch you looking at my client.” <em>Wife.<em> She so desperately wanted to say wife. “I’ll have you removed from the premises.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Natasha scoffed. “You can’t do that.”<br/>
</p><p>“Try me,” Agatha smiled, although her tone was harsh.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha smirked as if she were taking this as a challenge. “Noted,” she said before walking away.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha imitated strangling Natasha behind her back.<br/>
</p><p>She needed a shot of vodka…or five.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio was trying to enjoy her lunch. She was with the girls she sat with at the luncheon: ‘Miss Washington,’ ‘Miss Chicago,’ ‘Miss California,’ ‘Miss Massachusetts,’ and, of course, Kalani-Rose, with the addition of last year’s winner, Isabella Alonso. But all she could think about was how her wife was most likely plotting Natasha and Kalani-Rose’s deaths simultaneously.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted to be with her, to calm her down and remind her that at the end of every day, Rio was her wife and nobody else’s. But Kalani-Rose just <em>had<em> to suggest that they go out for lunch. She was sitting next to her mission subject and Isabella.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio understood how Isabella had won the moment she met her. Her smile was radiant, her voice firm but kind, and she had this elegance about her that only she seemed to possess.<br/>
</p><p>“How was Brazil?” Miss California asked Isabella as she tucked one of her dark curls behind her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, it was amazing,” Isabella replied.<br/>
</p><p>Isabella had been volunteering in the Amazon Rainforest to help with reforestation, replanting trees and connecting with the locals. Rio thought it was nice to see that Isabella really <em>was<em> trying to change the world. It hadn’t been a front to win a beauty pageant.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio had watched Isabella’s speeches and interviews to help her prepare for the mission and she couldn’t tell at the time if she was just bullshitting to get the crown. It turned out she hadn’t been, and Rio felt bad for assuming that she was.<br/>
</p><p>“We will help regrow the rainforest one tree sapling at a time,” she smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s so inspiring,” Rio said, the words tumbling out.<br/>
</p><p>She hadn’t spoken much so far, but the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest kept Rio up at night. To hear that people were actually trying to combat the issue was something she couldn’t keep quiet about. Praise was due where praise was due.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you, Rio,” Isabella replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio realised Isabella reminded her of a Disney princess.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you before this. Have you been doing pageantry for long?”<br/>
</p><p>“Er…no. I’ve just gotten into it recently.”<br/>
</p><p>Isabella pouted slightly, and somehow it worked for her. “Well, that is a shame. I have a feeling you could’ve been…” she tilted her head up as if trying to find the word, “…legendary.”<br/>
</p><p>She held Rio’s gaze, and for some reason Rio felt like what she said had a deeper meaning. Or maybe she was just pulling shit out her ass.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, that’s a good point,” Kalani-Rose said. “I’d never heard of you before the luncheon…where did you come from?”<br/>
</p><p>The other girls murmured their agreements.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake. How am I supposed to spin this?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I was an underdog. Nobody expected me to get this far.”<br/>
</p><p>“But I swear, when I had been looking at all the Miss America contestants before the pageant, the Miss Delaware did <em>not<em> look like you. There’s no forgetting your face.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Oh, Agatha was going to kill her for what she had to do next.<br/>
</p><p>“And there’s no forgetting yours,” Rio smirked, a flirtatious edge to her voice. “Which means you must’ve skipped past me.”<br/>
</p><p>Kalani-rose’s cheeks reddened as she mirrored Rio’s smirk. She placed a hand on Rio’s thigh under the table, and for the first time, Rio had to force herself to stay put. Luckily, it had been worth it, the subject was dropped after that, as everyone started guessing the final ten.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sat there in silence, trying her hardest not to chew her nails off because Agatha would understand, right? Rio would tell her that she had to flirt with Kalani-Rose to get herself out of a sticky situation. And it wasn’t technically flirting, more like one comment and a slight smirk…Agatha would understand it was all about the mission…right?!<br/>
</p><p>Her wife was going to kill her.<br/>
</p><p>Isabella nudged her. “Are you okay?” She whispered. “You look like a ghost.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nerves,” Rio lied.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, that’s normal,” Isabella smiled. “I’m here if you want to talk,” she said, squeezing Rio’s arm gently.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>They made their way back to the dressing room after lunch. Kalani-Rose was attached to Rio by the arm as if she couldn’t possibly keep upright without holding on to her.<br/>
</p><p>“I gotta go talk to my coach. I’ll come by your vanity in a sec.”<br/>
</p><p>Kalani-Rose frowned. “Okay, don’t be too long.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio forced a smile before detaching herself and finding Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife stood by her vanity with her arms on her hips and her right foot tapping incessantly. Rio couldn’t help herself, her eyes dropped to Agatha’s biceps. They were so evidently toned and firm with muscles. It was even hotter with the dress she had on; a black number that reached just above her knees and thick straps that sat on her shoulders, exposing her entire arms.<br/>
</p><p>“How was lunch? You choke on your food?” Her wife asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s mouth split into a grin. “I missed you, too.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Sit, we have to redo your makeup.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio complied, and Agatha stepped in front of her to get started. Now that she was concealed behind her wife’s body, Rio placed a hand on the inside of Agatha’s left thigh and squeezed. It wasn’t much in terms of affection; she wanted to do more, but it was better than nothing.<br/>
</p><p>She watched as her wife tried to fight off a smirk at the contact. With Agatha so close to her as she took off her makeup, Rio couldn’t resist. She whipped her head back and forth to make sure the coast was clear before she leaned forward and bit Agatha’s nose.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed before scrunching said nose. “One day you’re going to bite my nose off,” she whispered.<br/>
</p><p>It had become a habit. To Rio, Agatha’s nose was so adorable that all she wanted to do was eat it.<br/>
</p><p>“Good, then I could keep it forever.”<br/>
</p><p>“Freak,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio squeezed her thigh again.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, Rio,” a voice said from behind her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Give me a fucking break.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She removed her hand from Agatha’s thigh and forced down the way her heart broke when her wife flinched from the loss of contact.<br/>
</p><p>“Is this your coach?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replied, turning to look at Isabella.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha Smith,” Agatha said, extending her arm.<br/>
</p><p>Isabella took it with a warm smile.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry to interrupt, I just wanted to give credit where credit is due. You’ve done such a phenomenal job with Rio.” Isabella dropped her voice to a whisper, “I’m not supposed to say this, but I feel Rio has a real chance at winning.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha forced a smile and said, “Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>“No worries. Remember what I said, Rio,” she squeezed Rio’s shoulder. “I’m always here if you need.” She let her hand linger for a moment before pulling it away and taking her leave.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s fists curled into balls.<br/>
</p><p>Noticing this, Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, come on. She’s harmless.”<br/>
</p><p>“No, she wants you. Just like everyone else in this godforsaken place.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio had to laugh at that one. She wasn’t an idiot; she knew when she was being hit on, but Isabella? Yeah, no. It was a known fact she was straight, making it known on every single one of her social media platforms that she was a proud ally to the LGBTQIA+ community.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s straight,” Rio reminded her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“And you’re hot. You think straight people are immune to you? I know how smart you are, Rio, don’t play dumb with me now.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back and cackled. “You’re hilarious.”<br/>
</p><p>“And I’m going to murder you. Don’t let her touch you again.”<br/>
</p><p>When Rio looked at her, she could tell her wife was being entirely serious. She swallowed. If looks could kill.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>“Good.” Agatha yanked her chin up and continued her previous task.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck why is she so hot when she acts like this??? Do I need help?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Once Agatha was finished, she turned towards the vanity to dispose of the makeup wipes when of fucking course Kalani-Rose showed up.<br/>
</p><p>“You said you’d only be a minute,” Kalani-Rose whined.<br/>
</p><p>“I have to redo my makeup, sorry,” Rio offered half-heartedly.<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect, I’ll help you and you can do mine,” she started pulling Rio off her chair.<br/>
</p><p>“Where's your coach?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“I told her to go back to lunch, I don’t need her.”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, Rio needs <em>me<em> to do my job. So, no. She can’t help you at the moment.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Relax,” Kalani-Rose replied, flaring her eyes. “You can join my coach, too. Grab a drink with her…you might need it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio internally smacked her palm against her forehead.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s lips twisted into a cruel smile. Agatha wrenched Rio from Kalani-Rose’s grip, pressing her firmly against her side.<br/>
</p><p>Rio fought the urge to snigger.<br/>
</p><p>“I say this with the upmost disrespect: fuck. Off. You’ve been stopping me from doing my job all day. Rio will find you once I’m done with her. If the problem is that you can’t go five seconds without looking at her, it’s a good thing she’s only across the room from you. You can stare at her for as long as your heart contents.” She nodded her head towards Kalani-Rose’s vanity, “From over there.”<br/>
</p><p>Kalani-Rose blinked, momentarily thrown off guard. “You can’t…you can’t speak to me like that.”<br/>
</p><p>“I think I just did,” Agatha nodded patronisingly. “Bye-bye now,” Agatha waved.<br/>
</p><p>Kalani-Rose stared at Rio, and when she realised she wasn’t going to say anything, she walked away.<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t frighten the person we’re supposed to be protecting,” Rio teased, dropping into her chair. “That defeats the purpose.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, well, she shouldn’t be flirting with my wife.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The girls had to do one more rehearsal before the live show this evening. Agatha, unfortunately, didn’t have the luxury of watching it on the screens backstage. She had to do coach stuff. What that was, she couldn’t have told you. The FBI had sorted it out for her; all she had to do was go to the meeting and pretend she knew what everyone was talking about.<br/>
</p><p>Once the pageant stuff was out of the way, emergency protocols were discussed. For that, she zoned out, she knew all of that like the back of her hand.<br/>
</p><p>When the meeting was over, she went to the dressing room to find Rio…who wasn’t there. She huffed as she made her way to the next likely place she’d find her. The restaurant.<br/>
</p><p>She spotted Kalani-Rose, who fortunately was at a table without Rio, and spotted Rio at the bar, unfortunately with Natasha.<br/>
</p><p>Fucking Natasha.<br/>
</p><p>Could Agatha catch a break? First it was Kalani-Rose, then Natasha, and then Isabella. Agatha hadn’t mentioned it to Rio yet, but there was something <em>off<em> about Isabella. She was too nice, too sweet, too perfect. She got it, she was Miss America, but nobody was that flawless. It had to be a front.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Natasha was laughing at something Rio had said, leaning into her and resting her hand on her crossed legs.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha saw red.<br/>
</p><p>She stormed over to them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio lit up when she saw her, and Natasha, the psychopath that she was, did not remove her hand from Rio’s leg even when Rio tried to shift out of her grip.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wondered if she had a death wish.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, Aggs,” her wife smiled.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Hi, baby.<em> “Hi, Rio. You ready for this evening?”<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“With you by my side, always.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha loved her so much.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m ready too,” Natasha said as if she were included in the conversation. “You’re going to look stunning.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s head jerked. Was she hearing right? Was Natasha hitting on her wife <em>in front of her?<em> As if she hadn’t threatened her earlier. Did Natasha not value her life?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Er…” Rio’s eyes darted to Agatha. “Thanks. Are you ready for tonight? I mean the FBI, etc,” Rio said, changing the subject.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah…” Natasha started speaking, but Agatha tuned her out when Rio waved at someone across the room.<br/>
</p><p>She turned. Isabella. She was taking her place beside Kalani-Rose at their table. This, in turn, caught Kalani-Rose’s attention. She waved Rio over.<br/>
</p><p>“I should go,” Rio said, sliding off her chair.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha knew she wouldn’t have wanted to, but she figured Rio felt she’d been away from their mission subject for long enough.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll see you later,” Rio smiled before walking over to the table.<br/>
</p><p>“See you,” Natasha called after her, her voice far too low and raspy for Agatha’s liking.<br/>
</p><p>She took a seat in Rio’s old one, letting her wife’s warmth and scent ground her for a moment before turning her attention to Natasha.<br/>
</p><p>“I know you’re an agent,” Natasha started. She hadn’t looked at Agatha, her attention on the straw in her drink in front of her.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, you do?” Agatha replied sarcastically.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha scoffed. “Which means I know you might have a <em>crush<em> on Rio, but you can’t do anything about it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha smiled. She would entertain this. “What and you can?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve never worked with her, and I don’t intend to. Plus…she’s my ex.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hmm,” Agatha nodded. “And do you know what programme I’m in?”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha waved her hand dismissively. “MO?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tutted. “Try again.”<br/>
</p><p>When Natasha turned to her, her expression bored, she shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>“No, really think about it,” Agatha urged.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha huffed before resting her chin on her hand to think.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes widened in realisation.<br/>
</p><p>“But Rio…she…she’s not-”<br/>
</p><p>“My wife?” Agatha cut in eagerly. “Well, yes!”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha stared at her, stunned.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was grinning like the Cheshire Cat. This felt <em>good.<br/>
</em></p><p>She leaned in, closing the distance between herself and Natasha.<br/>
</p><p>“Now that the cat's out of the bag,” Agatha smiled. “If you touch or even look at my wife again,” she flashed her white teeth. “I’ll kill you.”<br/>
</p><p>And Agatha was only half joking.<br/>
</p><p>“You know I can just report you, right?” Natasha said, trying to seem nonchalant, although Agatha caught the flicker of fear cross her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“How are you going to do that if you’re not breathing?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe I need psychiatric help. I may be taking this a bit too far…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Are we clear?”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha regarded her for a moment before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“You need help.”<br/>
</p><p>That wicked smile flew across her face again. “And you will never have my wife.”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha nodded slowly. “Yeah…okay.” She got up and left.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Phew.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha sank into the barstool. Natasha finally seemed to get the message. Now, there was only one thing left to do.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>It was an hour before the pageant was due to start. The dressing room was chaos. The girls and their coaches were running about the place, everyone was screaming at each other across the room, and there was so much hairspray and steam in the air Agatha was surprised she hadn’t suffocated.<br/>
</p><p>She was midway through curling Rio’s hair when Natasha appeared.<br/>
</p><p>“Natasha!” Agatha smiled brightly. “What are you doing here?”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha shot her a look before turning her attention to Rio. “I’m leaving, so I just wanted to say goodbye.”<br/>
</p><p>“You are?” Rio asked in alarm. “Why?”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha glanced at Agatha, who still had that sickly sweet smile on her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“It turns out I’m better suited elsewhere.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh.”<br/>
</p><p>“That is <em>such<em> a shame!” Agatha said, bringing her hand to her heart.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Yeah,” Natasha deadpanned.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, well, it was nice to see you,” Rio said, getting up to hug her.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah…let’s not,” Natasha said, stepping away from Rio. “It was good…erm…cool,” Natasha corrected. “To see you, Rio.” Her eyes darted to Agatha. “Good luck.” And then she left.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared after her with her eyebrows furrowed until it appeared the dots had connected. She whipped around to face Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d you do?”<br/>
</p><p>“Me?” Agatha asked, feigning innocence.<br/>
</p><p>“You got her taken off security, didn’t you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha returned to Rio’s hair, picking up a piece and twisting it around the curling iron.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>She waved her free hand in the air. “All I said was that she had been very distracting and not helpful in protecting Kalani-Rose or the other girls.”<br/>
</p><p>“And they listened to you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head as if to say, ‘Be serious.’<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed. “No. No, of course they did.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Somehow, Agatha managed to get Rio ready without any interruptions. She did catch both Kalani-Rose and Isabella watching Rio slip into her evening gown, but apart from that, nobody looked in their direction or spoke to them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked unreal.<br/>
</p><p>Her hair was in loose waves, and her gown…Agatha couldn’t keep her eyes off her.<br/>
</p><p>The gown was a silk strapless number. The material twisted at her hips, sinching it in before flowing out into a floor-length train behind her. And of course, it was deep green.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had let Agatha take control when gown shopping. She trusted her wife to put her in the best dress, and Agatha felt she had outdone herself. If Rio really <em>was<em> competing in the Miss America pageant, Agatha was certain she’d win (and no, she wasn’t biased).<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Finishing touches,” Agatha said as she looped the Miss Delaware sash around her wife’s head. “Te ves hermosa, mi amor.” <em>You look beautiful, my love.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Sí, lo haces.” Yes, you do. Isabella had appeared from thin air. “¿Tú hablas español?” <em>You speak Spanish?<em> She was talking to Agatha.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Sí,” Rio answered before Agatha could say, ‘only a little.’<br/>
</p><p>“¿Por qué no lo mencionaste antes?” <em>Why didn’t you mention it before?<em> She was talking to Rio.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio shrugged. “No sé.” <em>I don’t know.<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha was starting to hate this interaction. How much had they spoken today? Was it all in Spanish so that nobody knew what they were talking about?<br/>
</p><p>That reminded Agatha to tell Rio to keep an eye on Isabella tonight.<br/>
</p><p>“Wow, Rio,” Kalani-Rose said as she came towards them, a handful of girls behind her.<br/>
</p><p>They all murmured their agreement.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio smiled. “You all look amazing.”<br/>
</p><p>The other girls thanked her in return.<br/>
</p><p>“Twenty minutes before the show starts, ladies,” the stage manager announced.<br/>
</p><p>The room turned into a zoo again, the girls scurrying away in all directions. Well, all except Kalani-Rose and Isabella.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m never forgetting how good you look in this dress, and I hope, like you mentioned earlier, you don’t forget what I looked like in mine.” When she smiled, it was sincere.<br/>
</p><p>Their mission subject genuinely did have a crush on her wife. And Agatha may have taken pity on her…if it weren’t for that last part.<br/>
</p><p>She twisted her head slowly towards Rio, who had her lip between her teeth.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio? Are you okay? You’ve gone pale again,” Isabella asked, reaching over to touch her.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s fine,” Agatha replied, yanking her away from Isabella. “It’s the nerves, we’re going to the bathroom. Don’t wait up!”<br/>
</p><p>“But the show starts in-”<br/>
</p><p>“We’ll be back in time, don’t worry,” Agatha cut her off, dragging Rio to the closest bathroom.<br/>
</p><p>She locked the door and spun around to face Rio. “Are my ears deceiving me?” Agatha seethed.<br/>
</p><p>“Now…” Rio started, speaking to Agatha as if she were an animal that needed taming. “The girls were starting to question my cover. I had to…flirt,” Rio quietly admitted. “To get Kalani-Rose to back off.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha threw her head back, cackling manically. “And that’s the truth? I’m just supposed to take your word for it?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes!” Rio yelled. “Don’t you fucking trust me?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha did. She just didn’t know where to put her anger. This whole day had been filled with everyone pining over her wife, and she thought she was losing her mind.<br/>
</p><p>“I do!” Agatha screamed back, crowding Rio against the bathroom wall.<br/>
</p><p>“Then fucking act like it!” Rio said, shoving at Agatha to get her to move so she could leave.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t budge.<br/>
</p><p>“Move,” Rio ordered. “I’m on soon, and I need to keep an eye on our mission subject.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gave Rio a mental round of applause for not uttering Kalani-Rose’s name at this moment.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s got people watching her. You’re good.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. “Yeah, and she’s our mission, so,” she shoved at Agatha once more, “Get,” another shove, “Out,” another, “Of. The way.”<br/>
</p><p>Again, Agatha went nowhere.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, you know what, fuck you,” Rio said, before dipping underneath Agatha’s arm and escaping.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grabbed her arm then, tugging sharply and twisting Rio around until their lips crashed. She heard Rio moan into her mouth, felt her body relax against her. She pushed Rio back against the wall, uncaring she was trampling all over the train of her dress.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby…” Rio gasped. “…Baby, I can’t,” Agatha didn’t stop kissing her. “Mission…gotta…” Rio gave up when it was clear her wife didn’t care.<br/>
</p><p>Moments later, when Agatha dipped down to pull up Rio’s extremely long dress, she spoke again:<br/>
</p><p>“No. I need to be in the wings.”<br/>
</p><p>“I only need five minutes.”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha-”<br/>
</p><p>“Let me,” Agatha cut her off. She hated how needy she sounded, but for this entire day, Agatha felt like a chicken walking around with its head cut off.<br/>
</p><p>Everyone had been sorting out Rio’s attention, and for the first time, Rio hadn’t been able to give <em>her<em> any. Maybe she was insecure, but she needed a reminder that Rio still wanted her. Because if Rio wanted, she could have anyone.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Please.” She was on her knees now.<br/>
</p><p>Looking at Rio, it seemed like she could read her mind, understood the turmoil churning with in.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gave her a small smile before she dipped her head under Rio’s dress, shimmied down her underwear and pressed her tongue inside.<br/>
</p><p>She greedily lapped up Rio’s core, moaning at the taste of her wife. God, did she need this. Under Rio’s dress Agatha felt like she was in her own little world that consisted of nothing but Rio’s warmth and scent.<br/>
</p><p>She held onto Rio’s thighs, using them to ground her, using Rio to ground her. Reminding herself that she was the only person who got to do this, that at the end of the day Rio was coming home to her and Agatha was coming home to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Was this home? <em>Was Rio home?<br/>
</em></p><p>She shoved the thought away.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s back arched off the wall, muffled moans escaping her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m yours, mi amor,” Rio told her from above. “Nunca lo olvides.” <em>Never forget it<em>. “¿Promesa?” Promise?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha nodded before pushing three fingers in whilst continuing to work her tongue. In seconds, Rio was grabbing at her head beneath her gown, her groans muffled as she toppled over the edge.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha worked her through it until the hand loosened.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha emerged from underneath Rio’s dress, she was panting and sweating. Strands of hair were falling over her face.<br/>
</p><p>Rio helped her up, her hands immediately going to her hair to fix it.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha realised then that she had Rio’s hands in her hair, Rio’s scent clinging to her sweat and filling her nose, had her slick all over her mouth and fingers and still…it wasn’t enough.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted to be consumed by Rio in every imaginable way possible.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned forward and pressed a deep kiss to Rio’s lips, letting her wife taste herself on her tongue.<br/>
</p><p>A pounding against the door made them break apart.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” Isabella’s voice called through the door. “You’re on in two.”<br/>
</p><p>“Coming!” Rio called back. “I look okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha reached up and tucked a piece of Rio’s hair behind her ear. “Perfect.”<br/>
</p><p>A slow smile slid across Rio’s lips. She pressed one last kiss to Agatha’s before she headed to the door.<br/>
</p><p>“I miss you already,” Rio said before she opened it.<br/>
</p><p>“Not nearly as much as me.”</p>

<em>Keep an eye out for Isabella.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s words played on a loop in Rio’s head. It was the last thing her wife had said to her before she left the bathroom. Keep an eye on Isabella? What for?<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t tell if her wife just had it out for the other woman because she was ‘hitting on her’ or if she was a genuine cause for concern. Agatha’s instincts weren’t always to be trusted…like the safe mishap, but she trusted her wife.<br/>
</p><p>So, as Isabella led Rio towards the wings, she made a mental note to track Isabella’s every move.<br/>
</p><p>Rio took her place behind Kalani-Rose and Miss California.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay?” Kalani-Rose whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait,” Kalani-Rose wiped the corner of her mouth with her thumb. “Your lipstick was smudged.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio suppressed the smile that came when thinking about her wife’s lips on hers. “Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>The music started, the lights went up, and the show began.<br/>
</p><p>The girls were called to the stage one by one; the host would state their name and which state they were representing:<br/>
</p><p>“Miss Rio Smith, also known as your Miss Delaware!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio inhaled a deep breath before forcing her feet to move. She resisted the urge to shield her eyes from the blinding lights of the stage as the audience came into view. People clapped and cheered as she made her way centre stage.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t trip, don’t trip, don’t trip.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She hit her practiced pose, the hand on hip, before walking to her assigned place on the stage as the host announced Miss California. She spotted Agatha in the front row ahead of her. Her wife clapped with a smile on her face.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s my girl!” Rio caught her saying.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t help but grin. She loved Agatha, she really did. She made a mental note to tell her that one day.<br/>
</p><p>Once the rest of the contestants were on stage, the host welcomed Isabella:<br/>
</p><p>“And now for the reigning queen, Isabella Alonso!”<br/>
</p><p>The crowd went wild as Isabella stepped on stage, her wave regal, her smile radiant as people got to their feet.<br/>
</p><p>Rio really did wonder what her wife thought was so wrong about Isabella as she watched her hug the host and take the spare microphone in her black sequined dress. It was as if nothing could ever possibly <em>be<em> wrong with Isabella.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Hello! Are you all ready for this evening?” Isabella asked the crowd.<br/>
</p><p>They all whooped and cheered in response.<br/>
</p><p>“I thought so too! Now, without further ado, let the 2025 Miss America pageant begin!”<br/>
</p><p>The crowd reacted in kind.<br/>
</p><p>The judges were introduced, videos recapping the girls talents that they had performed earlier were played, an elimination process had been and gone, and now it was down to the final ten, the interviewing stage.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had gotten in by default, the competition had been rigged to make it so, she had to be by Kalani-Rose’s side at all times, especially whilst she was so exposed on stage.<br/>
</p><p>The first judge, a woman with an afro, stood up from her seat at the judge's panel just in front of the stage.<br/>
</p><p>“My first question is for Miss Delaware.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio smiled and walked centre stage to where the appointed mic was.<br/>
</p><p>“Give it to me,” Rio quipped.<br/>
</p><p>The crowd laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Why do you think we still have this competition?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio resisted the urge to stamp her foot. She didn’t fucking know.<br/>
</p><p>Isabella caught her eye where she was standing stage right, she nodded reassuringly, that warm smile on her face. The gesture reignited Rio’s confidence.<br/>
</p><p>“To inspire young women,” Rio answered.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Yeah…good enough.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>It was in fact, <em>not<em> good enough. The judge stared at her, waiting for her to continue.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Erm…” fuck. She’d fucked it, she’d hesitated. “Because it teaches us to embrace what it is to be a woman. Yes, we dress up and walk around in swimsuits.”<br/>
</p><p>The audience laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“But it’s more than that. It’s what we don’t get to showcase on stage. The behind the scenes, the charity work where we give back to our community, the volunteering where we help look after our dying planet, the teaching where we educate our youth. Being a woman is everything at once. This pageant allows us to do that whilst drawing attention to the issues we care about on a global stage.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio put her hand beside her mouth as she stage-whispered, “And get the big investors to put their money where we need them to.”<br/>
</p><p>The audience laughed before clapping, and the judge sat down with a satisfied nod.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Okay, good, good, nailed it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Once Rio took up her place at the end of the line down stage left, she looked for Agatha. When she found her, her wife smiled and winked.<br/>
</p><p>That was all the reassurance Rio needed.<br/>
</p><p>The other judges asked their own questions to their preferred girls.<br/>
</p><p>“Kalani-Rose,” the only male judge asked twenty minutes later. “How do you intend to make your mark on the world?”<br/>
</p><p>Kalani-Rose tucked one of her blonde curls behind her ear. “As a lesbian who is out and proud, I hope to show other lesbians that it is okay to be out. I have found that many of my peers who are the same as me hide because they are scared of how the world might perceive them. But look at me, I’m in the final ten women in the Miss America pageant. That will be my mark.” She smiled before she said, </p><p>“Your sexuality is a beautiful thing; never let people make you feel ashamed of it.”<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause before the crowd erupted into cheers. Rio had to hand it to her, she did well.<br/>
</p><p>Kalani-Rose smiled as she made her way over to Rio, and Rio smiled back.<br/>
</p><p>“The judges will be back with the final five in just a few moments, sit tight,” Isabella announced.<br/>
</p><p>The audience applauded as the girls went backstage.<br/>
</p><p>“Well done,” Rio congratulated as they huddled in the wings. “You all did amazing.”<br/>
</p><p>“As did you, Rio,” Kalani-Rose winked. She turned to the rest of the girls. “Whatever happens out there, I’m proud of you all for making it this far.”<br/>
</p><p>“Same here,” Miss California replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Me too,” Miss Washington added.<br/>
</p><p>The other girls murmured their agreements.<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew she’d made it into the final five, again, by default to protect Kalani-Rose, but she couldn’t help but feel bad. She hadn’t earned it; she’d be taking a spot away from a girl who actually did.<br/>
</p><p>She shoved the thought away and focused on the mission at hand.<br/>
</p><p>Isabella approached them then, that radiant smile of hers on her face.<br/>
</p><p>“How are we feeling, ladies?”<br/>
</p><p>A chorus of ‘goods’ was said by the girls.<br/>
</p><p>“How are you feeling?” Isabella whispered to Rio. “You know, because of earlier with your coach.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah, no, fine. Just some last-minute nerves.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hm,” Isabella hummed. “I’ll stand next to you when we get on stage. If you’re feeling nervous, just look at me and hopefully my facial expression will reassure you and let you know you’re fine.”<br/>
</p><p>That was nice of her, truly. But if Rio really did need to overcome some stage fright, the only person she would need to reassure her would be Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“You're back on in five, four,” the stage manager backstage started.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“And on to the final five,” the host announced.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was in the middle of Kalani-Rose and Isabella, both of them were holding her hands. She looked out into the large audience in search of her wife.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The seat in which her wife had been sitting was empty. Had she moved? She scanned the entire audience once, twice, three times. Her wife was nowhere to be found.<br/>
</p><p>Panic started bubbling inside Rio’s gut almost immediately.<br/>
</p><p>Had something happened to her? Was she okay? She couldn’t even ask. They had their coms in, but she couldn’t possibly speak to her on stage with all these people looking at her. Everyone would think she’d gone mad.<br/>
</p><p>She vaguely registered that Kalani-Rose was squeezing her hand, vaguely registered the host announcing the first girl who’d made it to the final five.<br/>
</p><p>Where the fuck was her wife? Rio cared about little else except the answer to that question.<br/>
</p><p>The audience was clapping again. Someone else had made it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Where’s Agatha?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Kalani-Rose had tightened the grip on the hand she was holding.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Where’s Agatha?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Isabella was shifting her weight from one foot to another beside her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Where’s Agatha?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>A gunshot sounded, and Rio’s heart dropped.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No! No, no, no, no. Please don’t let it be her. Please.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her eyes darted frantically across the audience. She wouldn’t have known where it had come from, she was too focused on her wife’s whereabouts.<br/>
</p><p>And that’s when she felt it.<br/>
</p><p>A hand slipping out of her grasp, a body hitting the floor, the audience screaming. Rio turned.<br/>
</p><p>Isabella was dead.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened before she jumped into action.<br/>
</p><p>“FBI, move out of the way,” she ordered.<br/>
</p><p>The host who was crowding around Isabella’s body stepped back.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stooped down to check for a pulse. Nothing.<br/>
</p><p>The police and FBI swarmed the stage, shooing everyone else away. They surrounded Isabella’s body, their guns aimed at her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know what the hell was going on.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She shot up, her eyes scanning her surroundings for her wife.<br/>
</p><p>Finally, her wife appeared, her gun out as she ran up the steps and onto the stage.<br/>
</p><p>“What the hell happened?!” Rio asked when Agatha had come up to her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “You didn’t see? Isabella was going to kill Kalani-Rose.”<br/>
</p><p>No. Rio definitely didn’t see that.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“Wait…explain it again,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>This was the fourth time Rio had asked now. Agatha had explained what happened on stage at the pageant, during the ride home, in the shower, and now on their living room couch.<br/>
</p><p>“The FBI got word that the <em>real<em> Isabella Alonso had gone missing earlier this morning.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“The Isabella that I killed was a fake.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “But she <em>looked<em> so much like her. Acted like her, too. I studied her Miss America videos religiously when preparing for this mission. How did I miss that?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha shrugged. “You’re not a robot, my love. Humans make mistakes.”<br/>
</p><p>“But I shouldn’t have,” Rio grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Before Agatha could offer some comfort, Rio said:<br/>
</p><p>“Continue.”<br/>
</p><p>“I…are you sure?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said sharply. “I mean,” her voice softened, “Yes. Please.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I had my doubts about her from the beginning, so after the break, I moved closer to the stage to get a better view of her. That’s when I saw the gun, that’s when I saw her pull it out.”<br/>
</p><p>Now, would Agatha admit that, technically, she’d pulled the trigger too early as Isabella hadn’t actually <em>done<em> anything yet? No. But she’d had a gut feeling that something bad would happen if she didn’t, and it certainly had nothing to do with the way she was holding her wife’s hand.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She’d been right about it anyway, so what did it matter? It was found out that the fake Isabella’s real name was Rosa, and she was a long-time member of the Sepiente gang. The gang that had it out for Judge Matthews and his family because he was deciding the fate of their gang leader, Marina Blue, the whole reason they were on this mission in the first place.<br/>
</p><p>“When you said to keep an eye on Isabella, I’m going to be honest, baby, I thought it was mostly you’re jealousy talking.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “You should never doubt my gut.”<br/>
</p><p>“Except for that one time,” Rio teased. She was talking about the safe incident <em>again.<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha groaned. “Let that go, will you?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve got to be honest, though, I’m surprised you didn’t notice it. The gun, I mean. That’s not like you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shifted in her seat. “I was distracted,” she quietly admitted.<br/>
</p><p>“You were?” Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Why?”<br/>
</p><p>“Why?!” Rio shot back. “Because you had disappeared from your seat, and I couldn’t fucking find you! You scared the shit out of me.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh.<em> “Oh…sorry about that.”<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“You fucking should be,” Rio shoved her playfully in the arm. Agatha caught it and pulled Rio onto her lap. She wrapped her arms around her.<br/>
</p><p>“You worrying about me distracted you from doing your job? Look at how far we’ve come.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not proud of it,” Rio mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, tightening her grip around Rio. They settled into a comfortable silence.<br/>
</p><p>“I think I’d put you above everything, you and Nicky,” Rio whispered into the stillness.<br/>
</p><p>A smile slowly slid onto Agatha’s lips before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Me too.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>They were on a walk around Central Park. After the chaos that was yesterday, the wives itched to get back to their simple married life and fighting crime without the glitz and glam of the pageantry world.<br/>
</p><p>“You did what?” Agatha laughed as she sipped her coffee.<br/>
</p><p>“I pierced my nose. I mean…technically Alice did it, but still.”<br/>
</p><p>“And you did that because…”<br/>
</p><p>“Because I was going through a phase, alright?” Rio rolled her eyes. “This girl I had a crush on told me she thought I’d look good with a nose piercing. And being the hormonal fifteen-year-old that I was, I persuaded Alice to do it for me.”<br/>
</p><p>“So it wasn’t a phase, you just had a crush on a girl.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio side-eyed her before continuing, “Whatever. When my Abuela got home, she flipped, understandably. Our bathroom looked like a crime scene; there was blood everywhere, and Alice had lost the stud.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her head back and laughed. “Did you keep it? The piercing?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head, taking a sip of her coffee. “We never found the stud, so the hole closed up. My Abuela grounded me for a month.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow. “Makes sense.”<br/>
</p><p>“What about you?” Rio asked. “Did you have any phases?”<br/>
</p><p>“I was blonde for a bit,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “You were?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha hummed.<br/>
</p><p>“I never saw any photos of you as a blonde.”<br/>
</p><p>“You really have to stop googling me,” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, if you don’t want me to look, take the photos off the internet,” Rio shot back.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “It was when I was fourteen. I also had a silver streak phase, but that was when I was seventeen. My mother had really pissed me off that year and she absolutely hated it, so my goal was achieved.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “Were the streaks throughout your whole hair?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha replied, shaking her head. “Just the two front pieces, see,” she pulled at her hair to show Rio what she meant.<br/>
</p><p>“I would’ve loved to see that,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah? Maybe I’ll do it again one day.”<br/>
</p><p>“Well,” Rio replied, taking a sip of coffee. “We do have the rest of our lives,” she tilted her head to Agatha with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, we do.”<br/>
</p><p>They stopped short when a crowd of protesters blocked their path. She looked to Rio with her eyes narrowed, her wife mirrored her expression.<br/>
</p><p>“What are they protesting?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know.” Agatha couldn’t tell from here.<br/>
</p><p>The signs the protesters were holding were all facing away from them.<br/>
</p><p>It happened the way Agatha remembered the bible story her mother had repeatedly told her when she was little, the one about the man who had split the sea. The crowd split directly down the middle, and there she was.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother.</p>

<p>“Do you want to go another way to avoid them?” Rio asked, staring out at the protesters.<br/>
</p><p>The hand in hers had gone stiff. With furrowed brows, she glanced at her wife, whose pale skin had turned translucent.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby?” Rio asked, her voice laced with concern. “Hey, what’s wrong?”<br/>
</p><p>It was like she was talking to a wall. Her wife was fixated on something ahead of them. Rio turned back to the protesters to see what she was missing.<br/>
</p><p>The devil herself, that’s what she had been missing.<br/>
</p><p>Panic began bubbling up throughout Rio’s body as cold blue eyes locked onto her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>It isn’t like you have much to offer. You come from nothing. Your father left you. Your mother and grandmother are dead. A poor girl like you loves to take advantage of the filthy rich.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>It was as if being in Evanora’s mere presence reignited every doubt Rio had about herself and shoved them to the forefront of her mind.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You come from nothing.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And the words only replayed on a loop.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>It’s not like you have much to offer.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio blinked, forcing herself to snap out of it. She was letting the wrong thoughts consume her because whatever was going on in Rio’s mind would be far worse in Agatha’s.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby,” Rio repeated, although her voice was firmer this time. “Let’s go. You don’t need this.”<br/>
</p><p>Her wife had never gone into much detail about her relationship with her mother. That one FaceTime call on her birthday gave her all the insight she needed. The only other time Agatha had really spoken about it was when she’d casually mentioned her mother had forced her to go to conversion therapy.<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew never to pry when it came to her wife. She’d learnt to be patient and let her come to her. Otherwise, her wife would shut down like a hermit crab.<br/>
</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio urged, but it was too late.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife’s mother, along with a handful of protestors, was surrounding them. She could see the signs and what was written on them clear as day now:<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Turn towards God, let him save you.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>It was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>God is the only thing that can save females now.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Do not give in to sexual deviance.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Women should be seen and not heard.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Homo’s are worshippers of the devil.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>She stopped reading, instead trying to find a break in the circle that had trapped them. She needed to get Agatha out of there.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt an ice-cold hand on hers, felt sharp nails pressing into her wrist as the claws ripped her hand out of Agatha’s. She turned to see the old hag between her and her wife.<br/>
</p><p>Before Rio had a chance to say anything, Evanora started:<br/>
</p><p>“You evil little thing. You disgust me,” she spat above the chanting.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife swallowed.<br/>
</p><p>“What makes you think it is appropriate for you to walk around in such a public space holding hands with your <em>slut<em>. There are children present; do you not have any shame?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her wife, who had been frozen still, jumped into action then.<br/>
</p><p>“Call <em>my wife<em> that again, and I’ll kill you.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>And when Agatha spoke, it wasn’t just a threat, it was a promise.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora only laughed. “Then you’ll end up in prison just like I knew you always would. And don’t count on Daddy to bail you out like always, sweetheart. He always does what I tell him to.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes before she shifted her gaze to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s go, baby.” She held out her hand for Rio to take again before her mother smacked it. The sound ringing out over the chanting. Red started blossoming on her wife’s pale hand.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Baby,<em>” Evanora mimicked. “As if that is something you should ever call another woman.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Aggs,” Rio said, because why the fuck had she just been standing there letting her wife’s poor excuse of a mother speak to her like that? “You’re right, let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>Her wife nodded, and together, they began trying to leave the circle on opposite ends.<br/>
</p><p>“Let her go,” Evanora ordered.<br/>
</p><p>The protestors parted for Rio, and she made it out the other side. That went easier than she had expected. She walked around the throng to retrieve her wife…<br/>
</p><p>Who hadn’t been let out.<br/>
</p><p>Who was still trapped inside the crowd of protesters, face to face with her mother.<br/>
</p><p>“No!” Rio yelled.<br/>
</p><p>How had she been so stupid?<br/>
</p><p>She surged forward only to be met with five beefy men blocking her path. They shoved her back, using their signs to push her further.<br/>
</p><p>Now, was it a good idea for a trained FBI agent to display all of their abilities in the middle of Central Park on civilians? No. But they were the only thing stopping her from getting to her wife.<br/>
</p><p>And Rio would do anything for her wife.<br/>
</p><p>She shot forward again, using her speed as an element of surprise to yank one of the protest signs from one of the men’s paws for hands. He blinked at her before Rio started swinging. She flipped the sign so that the wooden plank it was stuck to was at the end and went for it.<br/>
</p><p>It was a blur after that. Rio registered blows landing, wood splitting, blood dripping onto the sidewalk. But her mind told her, <em>don’t stop until you get to Agatha.<br/>
</em></p><p>When Rio came back to her body, the crowd had dispersed. The chanting had stopped, and the air was filled with groans and hard thuds of people running from the crazy woman whacking people with a ‘God saves all’ sign.<br/>
</p><p>In her line of sight was her wife again. Her wife, whose mother’s hands were gripping onto either side of her head with a vice-like grip. Her wife, whose eyes were streaming with tears, as her mother whispered harshly against her face.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was going to snap Evanora’s wrists.<br/>
</p><p>She raised the now bloody, battered wooden plank of the protest sign.<br/>
</p><p>“Get your hands off of your daughter before you no longer have any,” Rio grit out.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora, the sick fuck that she was smirked. She put her hands up in surrender and backed away from Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Remember,” Evanora sing songed. “You will always be nothing.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio let the comment roll off her back because the only thing that mattered, the only thing that would ever matter, was her wife’s wellbeing.<br/>
</p><p>“Mi amor,” she took a step forward as Agatha stepped back. Rio tried not to let how much that hurt her stop her. “¿Estás bien?” <em>Are you okay?<br/>
</em></p><p>Spanish because Evanora couldn’t understand it. Spanish because Agatha was the only one who could hear her that could. Spanish because no one existed in this moment but them.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Nena?” <em>Baby?<em> Rio tried again.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her wife’s eyes were glassy. Vacant. As if the lights were on but nobody was home.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha took another step back, then another, until she turned.<br/>
</p><p>She was running.<br/>
</p><p>Rio dropped the sign in her hands as she watched her wife’s retreating form.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora stepped into view, a smug fucking smile on her face. Rio’s fits curled into balls.<br/>
</p><p>“When she leaves you,” Evanora told her, voice dripping with satisfaction. “Remember I told you so.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t think before she brought her fist up and swung.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>She could have anyone in the world, why on earth would she choose you?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s feet carried her out of the park.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Soon enough that poor little slut will realise she’s bedded the devil.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her tears blurred her vision. She couldn’t for the life of her see where she was going.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You drink and abuse substances because you can’t face yourself.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She knocked into a woman who started yelling at her. The words fell on deaf ears.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You will never be enough, Agatha. Not for me, not for your father, not for Wanda and certainly not for your son.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her feet had carried her to a bar.<br/>
</p><p>She shouldn’t. She fucking shouldn’t. She hadn’t turned to alcohol like this in years. She didn’t want to give the therapy sessions she’d been forced to attend after she’d shot the wrong person and blew up her life any credit, but they had helped.<br/>
</p><p>She yanked the bar door open anyway.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I’m glad Wanda has Nicholas. You would’ve corrupted him. Turned him into pure evil just as you are.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha turned off her location, got up onto one of the bar stools, and ordered three shots of vodka and a double vodka coke. She knocked back the shots as if it were as easy as breathing.<br/>
</p><p>The bartender stared at her, his mouth agape.<br/>
</p><p>She flipped him off before forcing him to pour her three more shots. She demanded a tray to carry her drinks and slipped into a booth at the back of the bar.<br/>
</p><p>She gulped down another shot when her phone began to buzz.<br/>
</p><p>Rio.<br/>
</p><p>She’d forgotten she’d set her phone to let Rio’s phone calls come through regardless of whether she was on do not disturb or not. She watched the phone ring until it stopped, and when she swiped up to look at her notifications, she had five missed calls from her, three from Jen, and one from Alice.<br/>
</p><p>She turned her phone off and knocked back another shot.<br/>
</p><p>The acidic taste of the vodka burned her throat, and she welcomed it.<br/>
</p><p>She needed every word her mother had said to her gone.<br/>
</p><p>The five shots she’d done hit her all at once. The effects of the boose slamming into her head making her nauseous. A giggle climbed up her throat and left her mouth. She laughed as she thought about what happened. Seeing her mother, her mother slapping her, her mother telling her she was the devil in human form.<br/>
</p><p>It was all so funny, wasn’t it? None of it was true.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>It’s not true,<em> Agatha reminded herself.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>
<em>It’s not true, it’s not true, it is true, it’s not.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her brain was getting confused. It <em>wasn’t<em> true.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>But isn’t it?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She slammed back the last shot. Those manic cackles turning into soft sobs.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled her glass of vodka and Coke towards her and took a sip, her tears slipping down her face and into the glass.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t understand what was wrong with her. Her mother said shit like that to her all the time. Maybe it was because of yesterday, all those women going after Rio, because, like she’d realised, Rio could have anyone. And her mother seemed to know that, too.<br/>
</p><p>And Nicky…was he better off with Wanda? Sure, she saw him almost every weekend, but her son didn’t really <em>need <em>her. She didn’t do the school runs, she didn’t make him breakfast every morning, she didn’t tuck him into bed at night. That was all, Wanda.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She’d been a pathetic excuse of a mother.<br/>
</p><p>Was she her mother?<br/>
</p><p>The thought made her stomach clench, and she dry heaved. Fortunately, nothing came out. When her breathing levelled out, she chugged the rest of her drink, liquid pouring down her chin as she drank.<br/>
</p><p>She waved a bartender down and reordered her previous order.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know how long she’d spent at the bar, but by the time she’d been kicked out, the sun was setting, and it was raining.<br/>
</p><p>She tried to turn on her phone but kept dropping it. She was so drunk she couldn’t get her body to operate normally. It had been a while since she’d drunk this heavily, and she’d almost forgotten what it was like to lose complete control over her body.<br/>
</p><p>She cursed when she dropped her phone into a puddle. Cautiously, Agatha stooped down to retrieve it. There was no saving the thing; she tipped it forward, and water leaked from the speakers.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuckingg greattt,” she slurred to herself.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You are your mother.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She winced when the thought slammed into her head.<br/>
</p><p>It hadn’t worked. The alcohol.<br/>
</p><p>When she used to do this, she’d drink until she couldn’t think straight, and the vitriolic thoughts disappeared. That hadn’t happened this time. The thoughts still came, and when they did, they were <em>loud.<br/>
</em></p><p>She stood up, swaying on the spot before righting herself. When she thought she was good enough to move, she started walking…or…stumbling towards her house. Wherever that was.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha bumped into at least five people as she made her way down the street. They all grunted or screamed at her to watch where she was going. She acknowledged none of them. Somewhere along the way, she’d lost her phone. Dropped it and kept walking, not that she needed it; it didn’t work anyway.<br/>
</p><p>Rain soaked her hair and drenched her clothes as she staggered her way down more streets. She was vaguely aware that her body was cold. She wasn’t because she couldn’t feel it, but her skin was riddled with goosebumps, and her lips began to tremble.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Nicky and Rio would be better off if you were dead.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>That thought felt like someone had backhanded her.<br/>
</p><p>She stopped dead in her tracks, hunched over, and threw up.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Was that true?<em> She asked herself as she threw up. Because if it were, shouldn’t she just end it all now? Run out into the middle of the road and let a car slam into her.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>
<em>It isn’t true. You are just drunk.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>A pair of black leather shoes appeared next to her patch of sick.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay, ma’am?” The pair of shoes asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Do I look okay?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>The man stuttered. “I…er…n…no.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m glad we’ve cleared that up. You can fuck off now.” As soon as she’d finished her sentence, she hurled again, her sick splattering onto the man’s shoes.<br/>
</p><p>The shoes retreated.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know how long she spent curled over vomiting with hard raindrops beating against her back, but when she was finally sure she was done being sick, the rain had cleared most of her vomit away.<br/>
</p><p>She wiped her eyes and mouth with the back of her hand, and when she looked up, her heart skipped a beat.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sprinted towards her and didn’t stop until she was holding her in her arms.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha thought she was done crying, but when her wife squeezed her tightly, the floodgates opened again. She rested her chin atop Rio’s shoulder as the tears rolled down her face.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re okay,” Rio soothed as she ran her fingers through Agatha’s wet hair. “I’ve got you. I have <em>always<em> got you.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>For the first time since she’d spoken to her mother, those thoughts, those vile, deceiving thoughts dissolved into nothing.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha realised then, just like she had when Rio had kissed her for the first time, that no substance could ever do more for her than her wife did, would ever have an effect on her like her wife did.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled back, wiping the rain and tears from her eyes. Her hands mirrored the placement of her mother’s hours earlier, except her nails weren’t digging into her skin. Rio’s hands were gentle, cradling her.<br/>
</p><p>“You are <em>not<em> evil, Agatha,” Rio told her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Even in the rain, even in her drunken state, she locked on to the brown eyes staring back at her. They were filled with such earnestness that Agatha found herself believing her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pressed their foreheads together as the rain continued to fall.<br/>
</p><p>And because Agatha remembered how much her mother’s words had affected her wife the last time, she heard herself reply:<br/>
</p><p>“And you aren’t nobody.”</p>

<p>Time stopped as Rio held her wife in the rain. Agatha was the strongest person she knew, and yet right now she seemed so small, so heartbroken and destroyed by her mother’s abuse.<br/>
</p><p>All Rio wanted to do was take care of her.<br/>
</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio said, pressing her thumbs into her cheeks to hold her head up. “Let’s go home, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Her wife nodded her head once.<br/>
</p><p>Rio could tell she wasn’t quite with it. She smelt of alcohol and dingy bars.<br/>
</p><p>She held Agatha to her side as she flagged down a cab. Once one arrived, she cautiously put Agatha in it and told the driver to drive slowly. Agatha had nuzzled into her side, her beautiful face covered by her head of wet hair.<br/>
</p><p>The taxi pulled up to their house, Rio paid and helped her wife out of the car. She swayed as she placed both feet on the ground, her body slumping against the cab.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on, baby,” Rio encouraged as she pulled Agatha’s body onto hers. “You have to let me hold you so the driver can leave.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, just let Rio pull her off the cab. Once it had driven off, Rio started walking towards the house, her wife’s arm slung around her shoulder as Agatha tried to walk. This wasn’t working. They wouldn't be getting anywhere anytime soon.<br/>
</p><p>“Would you be okay if I carried you?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha looked at her, her pupils were blown so wide she looked like one of those cartoon babies. Rio’s heart broke as her wife nodded, her teeth digging into her bottom lip.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re okay, baby,” Rio soothed as she picked her up bridal style and carried her towards their front door. “I’ve got you, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio made it up the steps before she put Agatha down again. She let them into the house, and her wife began to cry again.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Rio soothed. “What is it? Talk to me.” She tucked Agatha’s wet hair behind her ear.<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head. “Please don’t make me,” Agatha’s voice was so small.<br/>
</p><p>“Never,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted to know more than anything what her mother had said to her, but Rio also knew she had to be patient. Agatha hated talking far more than she did, and Rio would wait an eternity if that’s what it took.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you need, sweetheart?” Rio asked. “Anything you want, anything in the world, and I’ll get it for you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked at her with glassy eyes, taking her in. After a beat, she whispered, “I just need…I just need you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips curled into a small smile.<br/>
</p><p>“And maybe a shower,” Agatha quipped.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s smile only grew. Even at her lowest, her wife was still finding ways to tease and make jokes.<br/>
</p><p>“I can do that.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio helped her wife undress and took care of her in the shower, washing the stench of alcohol out of her hair and off her body. Afterwards, she made Agatha avocado toast with eggs and tomatoes (one of the only things Rio knew how to make) and chamomile tea.<br/>
</p><p>At first, her wife outright refused to touch any of it, but with soothing words and gentle kisses to her cheeks, Rio coaxed her into doing so. Agatha had eaten three-quarters of the toast before Rio allowed her to stop eating. But she did drink all the tea.<br/>
</p><p>After that, Rio took her to bed. She rested her back against the headboard as Agatha curled into her, her head resting against her chest. She was trembling, whether that was from the fact she was still cold from being out in the rain or to suppress tears, Rio didn’t know.<br/>
</p><p>She ran her fingers idly through her wife’s hair, scratching at her scalp to try and calm her as much as possible.<br/>
</p><p>“If I fall asleep,” Agatha whispered, “Promise to still be here?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. Did her wife think she would leave her? Never again.<br/>
</p><p>She pressed a kiss to the top of her head. “I’m not going anywhere, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>The hand resting on her chest curled her shirt fabric into a small ball.<br/>
</p><p>“I can hear your heartbeat,” Agatha told her. “It makes me feel safe. I don’t want you to get up, even if you need to pee or get water, if I fall asleep. I know that’s not fair of me, but I just-”<br/>
</p><p>“Not going anywhere,” Rio repeated. “I’ll be right here. I promise.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>They fell into silence, Rio’s fingers continued to play with her wife’s hair.<br/>
</p><p>“When I needed Wanda,” Agatha spoke into the silence moments later. “She was never there. My mother would come over to our house, scream at me as she just did, and she would just…watch.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped. Wanda, the person Agatha had loved so much, she chose to have a child with, watched as her mother verbally abused her? The hand in her wife’s hair tightened slightly as the anger started to rise.<br/>
</p><p>“And once my mother was done,” Agatha continued. “She’d offer Wanda tea and cookies and leave me to go through my emotions alone.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>How?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The first thing Rio thought once Evanora had started spewing her bullshit was how to stop it, how to harm her in anyway possible. How could Wanda just <em>stand there?<em> The anger was manifesting into tears as they pricked her eyes.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I never said anything because I loved her too much. But then there had been an issue with the law firm Wanda started; they had gotten into some money trouble, and she was going to lose everything. She never told me, but told my mother, and my mother paid to save it when I could’ve helped.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>So, Wanda was a fucking sellout.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“I couldn’t do it after that. She was wrapped around my mother’s finger, doing everything she asked. She became the daughter my mother never had.”<br/>
</p><p>And in that moment, Rio hated Wanda.<br/>
</p><p>“She never deserved you, mi amor,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>A breathy chuckle left Agatha’s mouth. “I know that now.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not her,” Rio found herself saying, found herself needing to say. “Nothing in the world would make me betray you or Nicky like that.”<br/>
</p><p>The fist clenching at her shirt tightened.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t have to thank me,” Rio replied, because she didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>“Growing up,” Agatha started again.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait,” Rio stopped her. She realised then that her wife was still drunk, and she probably should remind her of that fact before she started opening up. “You’re not sober yet, Aggs.”<br/>
</p><p>She nodded. “I know, and it’s pathetic, but I don’t think I would be able to get this out properly if I were. Please just let me.”<br/>
</p><p>“Just…are you sure? I don’t want you to regret this in the morning.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded again. “My only regret is not telling you all of this sooner, for having to be fucking drunk to do so,” she laughed lightly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. There would never be a more delightful sound in the world.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha inhaled a deep breath. “When I was growing up, I discovered I liked women pretty early on. To this day, I still don’t know how, but someone found out and it spread like wildfire. My mother, to no one's surprise, was not happy about it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scratched lightly at her wife’s scalp.<br/>
</p><p>“She had never treated me all that nicely before, but it just got <em>worse.<em> My father didn’t care, not really, about my sexuality, that is, until my mother told him it was cause for concern. So, she did everything in her power to try and ‘fix me,’ and my father paid for the best of the best.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio hated this, hated that she couldn’t go back in time and change it all. When she’d come out to her Abuela, nothing changed. She’d told her she didn’t care, and she’d love her regardless of who Rio loved. She wished her wife could’ve had that.<br/>
</p><p>“It didn’t work, obviously, so I just started lashing out. Sneaking out, sleeping with people I shouldn’t, drinking and drugs and all that shit because I just figured what did it matter? At the beginning of every summer, I would be shipped off to some troubled teens camp or conversion therapy, so I might as well make the most of my freedom.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha paused, snuggling deeper into Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Sex, drugs, and alcohol were the escape. But I realised today that it no longer is.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re healing, baby,” Rio told her. “And I am <em>so<em> proud of you.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her wife’s head tilted upwards, and Rio locked onto beautiful blue for the first time since they’d gotten into bed.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s you,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re healing me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio blinked, and tears slipped down her face immediately. “Don’t give me too much credit.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s the truth,” Agatha replied firmly.<br/>
</p><p>She put her head back down on Rio’s chest, and Rio pressed two kisses to her head.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak again after that, and Rio couldn’t quite find the right words to say. She just held her wife and ran her fingers through her hair.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know how long she did this before her wife fell asleep; she could tell by the soft snores that left her wife and by the way her mouth was slightly open.<br/>
</p><p>She smiled. Agatha was truly perfect.<br/>
</p><p>In the silence of it all, Rio found it was safe enough to whisper:<br/>
</p><p>“I have an intense feeling of deep affection for you.” And she kissed the top of her wife’s head once.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>This was the second time Agatha had woken up that morning. The first time, she needed to pee. It was around 6 AM. Because of her stirring, she had woken up Rio, too. Her wife also needed to use the bathroom, and Agatha realised she’d probably been holding it since last night after she’d asked her not to go anywhere.<br/>
</p><p>They’d gone together. She didn’t know if it was how vulnerable she’d been last night or the hangover, but Agatha found herself being extremely clingy. She’d held Rio’s hand as she sat on the toilet and continued to hold on to it when it was Rio’s turn.<br/>
</p><p>They’d climbed into bed again, neither of them falling back asleep quite yet. They just sat in a comfortable silence, clinging to each other.<br/>
</p><p>About an hour passed before Rio said she wanted to make breakfast, and if it would be alright for her to leave to do so. Agatha had nodded, and her wife had left. She meant to follow her, but she’d ended up falling asleep again.<br/>
</p><p>Two hours later, Agatha was blinking awake, and Rio hadn’t returned.<br/>
</p><p>She groaned as she pulled herself out of bed. Her head was throbbing, and her throat was dry. She brushed her teeth and washed her face before heading to the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>What day even was it?<br/>
</p><p>Her wife greeted her with a smile when she entered the room.<br/>
</p><p>“Good morning.”<br/>
</p><p>“Morning,” Agatha yawned.<br/>
</p><p>She stopped when she took in Rio’s appearance. She was wearing a green apron that was covered in what looked like cinnamon. Cream was smeared across her face and elbows and the kitchen looked like a bomb had gone off.<br/>
</p><p>It was possible her wife made an even bigger mess than Nicky.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you-”<br/>
</p><p>“How are you feeling?” Rio cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>“Better.”<br/>
</p><p>And she meant it. Minus the hangover, she felt as if a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. She’d finally been able to tell Rio everything. Agatha wasn’t proud that she’d needed alcohol to do so, but she didn’t trust herself not to chicken out if she attempted to do it sober.<br/>
</p><p>She loved Rio, but talking about her feelings was something she still found insanely difficult. But she was working on it.<br/>
</p><p>“You still haven’t answered my question, though. What are you-”<br/>
</p><p>Her wife tugged her in by the waist and cut her sentence off with a long, deep kiss.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled away with a smile. “You’re trying to distract me…why?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio feigned obviousness. “Am I?”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you want bagels?” Rio asked, changing the subject yet again. “Because I still haven’t tried those Jo’s bagels you and Jen won’t stop raving about, and you always tell me they're the best hangover cure.”<br/>
</p><p>“I thought you were going to make breakfast?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio waggled a finger at her. “That was two hours ago…plus I burnt it all.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “Then what’s all-”<br/>
</p><p>“So, bagels?” Her wife cut her off again<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was getting more frustrated by the minute.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha replied with gritted teeth. “Bagels sound nice.” As much as Rio was pissing her off, she really did want those breakfast bagels.<br/>
</p><p>“Great! Can you go get them?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back. “But you were the one who-”<br/>
</p><p>“I know, but I need to go shower and clean up the kitchen, baby. I mean, look at me, I can’t go out looking like this.”<br/>
</p><p>“I can help, and then we can go together.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Nope, nope. You gotta go now, otherwise they’ll run out of the breakfast bagels. Isn’t that what you and Jen always tell me? They're always gone by 10:30?”<br/>
</p><p>Unfortunately, her wife was right, and Jo’s bagels didn’t do Uber Eats. What food establishment didn’t do fucking Uber Eats?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Rio Vidal if you don’t tell me what the fuck is going on right now, I swear to-”<br/>
</p><p>“Fine, fine,” Rio replied. “I promise I’ll tell you…when you get back.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to argue when Rio tilted her head and stared at her with a pointed look.<br/>
</p><p>She was the only person in the world who could get Agatha to do as she asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha huffed.<br/>
</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio told her before giving her a quick kiss.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before turning to leave.<br/>
</p><p>“I miss you already!” Rio called after her.<br/>
</p><p>She flipped her off.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was making her way back to the house with a large paper food bag and two flat whites in hand.<br/>
</p><p>She was fuming, to say the least.<br/>
</p><p>Why was Rio being so secretive? And why hadn’t she wanted to come with her? And why was their kitchen a mess?<br/>
</p><p>She rounded the corner, and their house came into view.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I have an intense feeling of deep affection for you.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>What was that? The thought made Agatha blink. That was Rio’s voice in her head. Had she dreamed that?<br/>
</p><p>Her mind cast back to last night, to when she was slipping into sleep and Rio had whispered…<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stopped abruptly.<br/>
</p><p>That was the textbook definition of love. Her wife had told her she loved her without actually saying she loved her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Why had Rio said that to her when she thought she was asleep? Could her wife not say it to her face? Now Agatha was even more pissed.<br/>
</p><p>She stormed up to their house and hurriedly opened their front door to confront her wife.<br/>
</p><p>She stopped short for the second time in two minutes.<br/>
</p><p>Hanging in their hallway was a banner.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Happy Birthday!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>In purple and gold.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had completely forgotten what day it was, yesterday’s events ensuring it. She smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Sneaky bitch,” she muttered to herself.<br/>
</p><p>She walked into the living room and found it decorated with more banners, purple, white and gold balloons were scattered about the place and on their table was a handful of presents.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s smile only grew.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not slick for this by the way!” Agatha called as she made her way to the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wasn’t there.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes playfully; her wife was going to make her find her. She placed the food and drinks down on the now clean island. She began to make her way to the elevator when Rio’s phone buzzed in her back pocket. Rio’s phone because she still didn’t have one from when she’d lost it yesterday. Her wife had told her to take hers and call her on the landline if she needed anything.<br/>
</p><p>She took it out of her pocket and clicked it on.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Unknown number: Happy birthday, Agatha.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows. Who was-<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes caught sight of drops of crimson just ahead. Blood. And a shattered glass.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha screamed.<br/>
</p><p>She ran out of the kitchen and found there were more drops of blood further down the hall passed the elevator. She followed the trail until it stopped just short of their back door that had been left slightly ajar.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head furiously. <em>No. No. No.<br/>
</em></p><p>She flew to the elevator and pressed the button frantically. When it arrived, she got in and headed straight for the basement. She called out Rio’s name and checked every room. She wasn’t there. </p><p>Agatha returned to the elevator and took it up to their bedrooms. She yelled Rio’s name as she pushed open every door until she made it to their rooftop garden.<br/>
</p><p>There was still no sign of her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha called desperately as she stepped out of the elevator and made her way back to the living room.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha searched the house five times before she ended up back in the kitchen. She was sweating, panting like crazy, and tears were beginning to prick her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head as tears slipped down her face. The conclusion was clear.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s phone buzzing again only confirmed what she already knew.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Unknown number: Good luck finding her.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha hunched over and threw up.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio blinked awake, finding she couldn’t see a thing. Wherever she was, was void of light.<br/>
</p><p>She had a brief moment of peace before pain started spreading through her brain. She winced as it only got worse. The left side of her forehead felt damp, sticky with something she knew could only be blood. She went to touch it and found her hands had been bound. The chains jangled as she moved, doing nothing for her headache.<br/>
</p><p>What the hell had happened?<br/>
</p><p>The last thing she remembered was getting out of the shower and changing as fast as she could to make it back in time to prepare the kitchen for her wife’s return.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio called even though she knew it was probably futile. “Agatha?” Rio called again, except this time it was barely a whisper.<br/>
</p><p>She knew the beautiful voice and the woman who owned it would not reply.<br/>
</p><p>How had she let this happen? How had she let someone <em>take<em> her? Rio was good at her job, she could sniff out an attack from a mile away, so why not this? Why hadn’t she seen signs in her own home?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>There was no point in dwelling on it. What’s done was done. The only thing Rio had control of now was getting out. And she would, no matter what it took.<br/>
</p><p>She twisted her hands in her cuffs to see how much room she had. None. They’d been fastened perfectly, almost as if they’d been designed for her. Rio leaned forward and picked up the chain in her hands, yanked once, twice. No give.<br/>
</p><p>Pain shot through her again, but this time it came from her right arm. She noticed then that it felt weaker than the other, sensitive even. As if someone had stuck a needle in it. She realised she was probably right.<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed, her eyes darting about the place to see if she could make out anything amongst the darkness. She couldn’t. Maybe she should try standing, see how far she could walk. She went to do just that only to find her feet had been chained to the ground as well.<br/>
</p><p>She crashed back down to earth with a yelp, her chains rattling as they hit the floor, the ache in her head spiking.<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” Rio muttered.<br/>
</p><p>What sounded like bolts unlocking rang out. The noise from the chains must’ve notified her attackers. Good. Rio was ready to kill someone.<br/>
</p><p>What felt like centuries later, the door unlocked, and a thin stream of light shot down the room as the door creaked open. Rio heard a man and woman speaking in what sounded like Spanish, what they were saying unclear.<br/>
</p><p>She craned her neck to try and see who spoke until the man came into view, blocking the light and plunging her into darkness once more. He stood and stared at her for a long moment, and Rio was desperate to see who he was.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>CLICK!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Light. Rio squinted, blinking rapidly to get her eyes to adjust. She made out the figure of the man approaching her before he crouched just before her. She forced her eyes to remain open as she took him in. He kind of looked like someone she…<br/>
</p><p>Daniel Gomez.<br/>
</p><p>The man from the Miss America shoot-out, the man her wife was convinced was trying to shoot at her instead of their mission subject, Kalani-Rose.<br/>
</p><p>Rio jerked her head back. “You?” She scoffed. “What the fuck?”<br/>
</p><p>Daniel furrowed his eyebrows as if he couldn’t believe that was all Rio had to say. “I…” he started.<br/>
</p><p>She stared at him, her expression unimpressed.<br/>
</p><p>This was fucking ridiculous. Her kidnapper was just some random. Not a long forgotten enemy or someone out to seek revenge. Just a man she’d never even spoken to or seen before until he was blasted all over the news.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck do you want?” Rio asked because now she was fuming. It was her wife’s birthday, and this man (like most men do) was ruining everything.<br/>
</p><p>He blinked at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Well?!” Rio yelled.<br/>
</p><p>She was clearly throwing him off. He probably expected to go in there and be the big bad attacker, and that Rio would cower and shake in her bones at the mere sight of him. The thought that she’d dismantled this dream made her feel warm and fuzzy.<br/>
</p><p>Daniel blinked a few more times before he steeled himself. His face twisted into a somewhat serious expression. He reached his olive hand up to touch Rio. On instinct, she jerked her head back. His hand kept advancing until Rio’s head was pressed against the wall.<br/>
</p><p>With nowhere else to go, his hand finally made contact with her skin, brushing at her cheek, tucking her hair behind her. She felt sick; the only person who could touch Rio like that was Agatha. When Daniel went to brush her other cheek, Rio lunged forward to bite him. His finger just avoided being bitten off.<br/>
</p><p>He scrambled backwards as if she were a wild animal. Rio flashed him a toothy grin.<br/>
</p><p>“Try that again and I will bite your hand off.”<br/>
</p><p>Daniel narrowed his eyes before surging forward and shoving a needle in her arm.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck, fuck, fuck. No! Fight it!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She couldn’t, she felt her consciousness slipping away from her by the second.<br/>
</p><p>Daniel slid behind her, putting his back against the wall and cradling Rio in his arms. She couldn’t even yell at him to get off her, threaten him, fight him. Tears slipped down Rio’s face as Daniel stroked her hair and shushed her quietly. She felt him press a kiss to her cheek, and she wanted to scream.<br/>
</p><p>As Rio’s eyes began to flutter shut, only one thought came to mind:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I love you, Agatha.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I miss you already.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>That was the last thing Rio had said to her; the last thing Rio might ever say to her. And what had Agatha said? Nothing. Too irritated to tell her the same. Too caught up in being mad about something so fucking stupid she hadn’t given her wife any last words to cling on to, like Rio had her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I miss you already.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Not nearly as much as me.<em> Agatha should’ve said. Because that’s what she always said.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>But not this time. Not the one time Rio actually needed to hear it.<br/>
</p><p>After Agatha finished throwing up, the doorbell rang. She grabbed one of the hidden guns in the kitchen and made her way to the door, prepared to shoot at anyone who dared to attack her as heartbroken as she was.<br/>
</p><p>It was Jen and Alice coming over to celebrate her birthday.<br/>
</p><p>She let them in, told them everything, and cried in her best friends arms.<br/>
</p><p>Alice stepped away to report Rio’s kidnapping to the FBI, and Jen suggested they go out and try to track her phone's location. This only made Agatha sob more because she’d lost her fucking phone. She’d lost her phone, and Rio had given her hers.<br/>
</p><p>Why did she have to do that? Get drunk yesterday? She didn’t even need the alcohol, it hadn’t worked. Rio was the only thing that worked. And now Agatha might’ve lost her.<br/>
</p><p>She should’ve woken up earlier and gotten the bagels earlier so she wouldn’t have missed the attack, she should’ve forced Rio to come with her, she should’ve walked home faster, she should’ve ordered less, and then she would have made it back sooner.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Jen said softly, dragging her out of her thoughts. “Come on, I’m driving us to MO.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>As she sat in the back of Jen and Alice’s car, Agatha kept clicking Rio’s phone on and off. She had her lock screen set to a photo shuffle so that every time you unlocked it, the picture would change. When Agatha unlocked it next, it was a photo of her and Rio in Portofino for her birthday. They both had pasta coming out of their mouths as they flipped off Alice, who had taken the photo from the bar.<br/>
</p><p>The next photo came up. It was only of Agatha. She’d never seen this photo before. She was in their cinema room, head resting on her propped-up hand as she stared at whatever film she was watching, wrapped up in blankets.<br/>
</p><p>The phone switched off again, and Agatha clicked it on once more. This photo was another one of her and Rio. Jen had taken this one. They’d all decided to go on a walk around Central Park. Alice and Jen had been late. Agatha and Rio were waiting on one of the benches for them. They were leaning into each other; Rio was tucking hair behind Agatha’s ear, and Agatha looked so in love.<br/>
</p><p>Because she was…is.<br/>
</p><p>Next, it was Rio, Nicky and Agatha. Rio had taken it in their bathroom mirror as they were brushing their teeth one morning. Nicky had toothpaste coming down his mouth, and Rio was laughing, Agatha smiling.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Nicky.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Jen! Jen, give me your phone.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen did so without question. “What’s up? Is everything okay?”<br/>
</p><p>No. Everything was not okay.<br/>
</p><p>She searched through Jen’s contacts until she found ‘Agatha’s bitch ass ex’ and dialled.<br/>
</p><p>The call went to voicemail.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha dialled again.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>They’d moved her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was no longer chained to a wall; she was in a chair, handcuffed (obviously), sitting at a table. The room was small…like a shoe box, white…clinically white. It reminded her of the room at main operations she’d been in the day she’d joined The Smith’s Programme; the day she married Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Her arm was twice as sore now after the second injection. Rio realised she needed to play her cards right if she wanted any chance at escaping. It seemed as if the moment Rio did something Daniel didn’t like, he’d sedate her. She couldn’t do a thing if she were unconscious.<br/>
</p><p>The door to her left opened, and Daniel stepped inside, a smile on his face.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio was free from her chains, she was going to kill him.<br/>
</p><p>He sat down on the chair opposite her, his smile unwavering. “You could’ve been everything, you know?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio just glared at him. She didn’t have time for the cryptic talk. She wanted him to say what he wanted and get this over with.<br/>
</p><p>“We knew, they knew, and yet they kept you away from us. But here you are anyway.” Daniel grinned. “The princess finally home to her castle. Pity you don’t get to stay.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, come on,” Daniel leaned forward. “You’re not even the slightest bit curious as to what I’m talking about?”<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>Quite frankly, Rio didn’t give a single fuck. She just wanted to get home to her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“Hm. I’m gonna tell you anyway.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“A long time ago…well…just over thirty-three years ago now, actually. A man and a woman had a daughter. Any guesses on who that might be?”<br/>
</p><p>Again, Rio deadpanned.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, it just so happens to be the beautiful woman in front of me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted to throw up.<br/>
</p><p>“Anyway, this man was very important to this group of people, he was a king. And his daughter…she was supposed to take over after his reign. But he hid her from the people, their princess, their predecessor.” Daniel paused before he said, “So naturally…we killed his wife.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrowed. Then it hit her.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother.<br/>
</p><p>She never actually knew how her mother died. Her Abuela had told her she was sick, and the sickness took her. Rio never questioned it as she couldn’t remember much about her mother anyway.<br/>
</p><p>“You killed her?” Rio asked, her voice quiet but stern.<br/>
</p><p>Daniel smiled. “Anyway, the king left his people for good after that, and the princess was lost to the world. We got whiffs of clues as to where she was here and there, but nothing solid. Until we got a call, someone knew who you were and where we could find you. And here we are.”<br/>
</p><p>“Whose we?” Rio shot back. “And who told you?”<br/>
</p><p>Daniel tutted. “All in good time, princess.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio fucking hated that pet name.<br/>
</p><p>Her mind was racing. This didn’t make any sense. Her father was king, king of what? Rio was pretty sure her father had worked at a repair shop fixing cars. There was no king’s needed in garages. And who the fuck was <em>we<em> and why did they want to kill her? It wasn’t her fault she didn’t know her family legacy.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Daniel rolled up his shirt sleeves, and Rio caught sight of the start of a tattoo. It appeared to be a long, blacked-out line.<br/>
</p><p>The door knob twisting caught Rio’s attention. The door opened slowly to reveal a woman behind it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Huh?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Marina Blue. The Serpiente gang leader.<br/>
</p><p>Wasn’t she on trial? Wasn’t she behind bars? How? What?<br/>
</p><p>She smiled, her perfect teeth on display. She wore a fitted black suit with no shirt underneath, her dark hair that reached just past her shoulders was in loose waves, her olive skin still managed to glow regardless of the weird lighting, and her dark eyes gleamed with fascination as she took Rio in. She was holding a file under her armpit.<br/>
</p><p>“A Vidal in the flesh. Never thought I’d see the day.” Marina stepped into the room. “Get out, Daniel.”<br/>
</p><p>“But I’m not done with her yet.”<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t remember asking. Get up and get out.”<br/>
</p><p>He rolled his eyes before doing as he was told.<br/>
</p><p>Marina took his place opposite Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“First things first. You will not try to escape; you will not go with Agatha if she finds us, and you will not give her or Alice or Jennifer any clues as to your whereabouts if we let you out in the open.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio forced herself not to furrow her eyebrows. How the hell did she know her wife and friends' names? She’d let them roll off her tongue so effortlessly. And out in the open? They wouldn’t be so stupid as to let Rio out, would they? She hoped they would be smart enough to know the second she had the chance, she’d take it.<br/>
</p><p>“And,” Marina continued. “I think you might want to see these before you get any ideas.”<br/>
</p><p>She opened the file and spread out the contents within on the table.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s heart dropped.</p>

<p>Agatha still hadn’t heard from Wanda.<br/>
</p><p>She’d called her next to thirty times by now and had gotten nothing. Agatha had thrown up again. The thought that Nicky could be gone too threatened to kill her, would kill her, if Nicky and Rio didn’t come out of this alive.<br/>
</p><p>They’d driven to Wanda’s apartment and found nothing. It appeared everything had been left undisturbed (Agatha knew where Wanda hid the spare key and had let them inside), but it didn’t explain their absence.<br/>
</p><p>Now in main operations, a team of intelligence agents, led by Agent Calderu, were searching for Rio. After giving a detailed report on what had happened, Lilia had told Agatha to sit tight until they found something. She couldn’t. Instead, she logged into her home's security cameras to watch the footage with Jen and Alice, only to find the footage had been cut.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha almost threw something.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t know what to do. She felt so helpless, and guilt was clawing at her insides because if she’d just been smarter, faster, more alert, then she could’ve stopped this. Rio would be safe and sound in her arms and not gone or potentially dead.<br/>
</p><p>She ran out of the room to throw up again.<br/>
</p><p>Many gruelling hours passed without any good news, or news at all for that matter. The sun had set, and Agatha still hadn’t heard from Wanda. She was starting to get so desperate that she was contemplating calling her mother.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was no longer in the room with the intelligence agents or Jen and Alice. The room was suffocating, trapping her within like a mouse in a shoe box. Instead, she walked aimlessly around MO as her mind spun out of control.<br/>
</p><p>She missed Rio so much she felt like she couldn’t breathe.<br/>
</p><p>How was she going to continue to live if Rio and Nicky were found dead? She’d been thinking about it, and the thought was so horrifying it physically stabbed her in the heart every time it crossed her mind.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was nothing without either of them.<br/>
</p><p>She was walking to the toilet to throw up again when she locked eyes with dark brown. Not <em>her<em> dark browns but ones she recognised.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“It’s you,” the little girl said, smiling with her big brown eyes.<br/>
</p><p>It was the brave girl from the Zip and Zazzle mission many months ago. The mission where the children had been forced to be slaves and housed in cages. Hihi had notified them when the children had been saved but Agatha never thought she’d see the girl again.<br/>
</p><p>“Hello,” Agatha got out. Her voice was raw and scratchy from all the vomiting. “How are you?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m free,” the little girl laughed, her dimples deepening.<br/>
</p><p>She looked even younger now in the bright lights of the FBI headquarters. But her cheeks were full, she wasn’t as thin, and her eyes had a sparkle in them instead of being empty and hollow.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m glad,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>The girl nodded. “I have to come here for therapy every week, but I like to stay longer. I think I want to be an agent, help people…or try to. Like you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha could’ve cried. Instead, she inhaled and kept them at bay. “I think you’d be a great one.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” the girl replied. “I’m Nicole, by the way. What’s your name?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Nicole. Kind of like Nicky.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“I’m Agatha, nice to meet you,” Agatha offered her hand to shake.<br/>
</p><p>Nicole stared at it for a long moment before she ignored it completely and stepped towards Agatha, wrapping her small arms around her stomach.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was going to lose it again; she felt the tears prick her eyes immediately. She bit her lip to fight them off as she wrapped her arms around Nicole.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you again,” Nicole mumbled into her chest. “Seeing you gave me hope again. It reminded me to keep fighting.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to ask her how because she hadn’t <em>done anything.<em> She couldn’t even save Nicole when she’d wanted to. She had to leave her behind.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You’re welcome.” Agatha crocked.<br/>
</p><p>Nicole stepped back with a small smile. “You also made me want to learn how to fight. When you and your partner started battling it out, amongst all the fear, I couldn’t help but thinking how cool it looked.”<br/>
</p><p>Somehow, Agatha found it in her to laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you two friends again? That argument was <em>bad.”<br/>
</em></p><p>Agatha chuckled. “She’s actually my wife,” Agatha replied. “And yes, we’re fine now.”<br/>
</p><p>They were not fine, far from it.<br/>
</p><p>Nicole lit up at the word wife. “That’s so cool! She’s your wife and your partner? I’m definitely joining the FBI now.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “I’ll be looking out for you then, Agent Nicole.”<br/>
</p><p>The girl's glee only grew. “See you around, Agent Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>“See you,” Agatha replied as Nicole walked away.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha let out a deep sigh. That brief break from reality was much needed, but when reality settled in again, it was a punch to the gut. She made a beeline for the toilet.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>It was 11:30 PM when Nicky and Wanda burst through the doors of MO. Nicky ran straight towards her, a smile on his face as he launched himself into her arms.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda had finally called her back. She had taken Nicky to the Hamptons to visit his grandpa and hadn’t been on her phone all day. Agatha would scream at her for it later, right now, all she cared about was that Nicky was safe.<br/>
</p><p>She’d told Wanda briefly what had happened and told her to come straight to MO when they returned to the city.<br/>
</p><p>“Happy birthday, mama!” Nicky squealed.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, right. It was still her birthday.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you, baby,” Agatha replied as she squeezed him tightly.<br/>
</p><p>She could breathe slightly easier now that she had Nicky, and she could protect him. It was one less problem to worry about on her list of many.<br/>
</p><p>“Why are we at your work, and where’s mami?”<br/>
</p><p>The question was so innocent, so sincere.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Where’s mami?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She didn’t know.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha told Wanda not to tell Nicky that Rio was missing. What would be the point? It would only upset him. Agatha didn’t trust herself to be strong for him, to not break down and cry when explaining to him.<br/>
</p><p>She inhaled sharply as Nicky pulled back, his brown eyes locking onto her expectantly as he waited for an answer.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s not here right now, Nicky,” Agatha forced a smile.<br/>
</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed. “Why not? I wanna see her.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Me too.<em> “She’ll be back soon. She had to go away for a bit.”<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Nicky frowned. “She left us behind?”<br/>
</p><p>“She didn’t want to,” Agatha replied in barely a whisper.<br/>
</p><p>“But-”<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, Nicky,” Jen’s voice cut in. “My god, you’ve gotten so big!”<br/>
</p><p>He giggled, and thankfully, the frown vanished. “Thank you, Auntie Jen.”<br/>
</p><p>“This is my wife, Alice,” Jen introduced.<br/>
</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Nicky,” Alice smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“You too.”<br/>
</p><p>Her best friend and her wife spent the next thirty minutes entertaining Nicky as the FBI sorted out a safehouse for the five of them.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Three days.<br/>
</p><p>Three days with no news on Rio. She hadn’t been picked up on any CCTV cameras, and there hadn’t been any sightings of her. It was almost as if she’d vanished off the face of the planet.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t been eating…or sleeping for that fact. She spent her days with the intelligence team, walking about MO or spending time with Nicky. He grounded her, gave her hope because Nicky had returned to her unharmed. Which meant Rio could return to her too.<br/>
</p><p>She was in the bathroom washing her hands when Rio’s phone buzzed. She grabbed it from her back pocket immediately and clicked it on.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Unknown number: You want your wife? Come get her.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>The next message was a location. A warehouse upstate.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Unknown number: Come alone and don’t tell anyone, or she’ll be dead before you even step foot in the building.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>It was all Agatha needed. She didn’t stop to think about whether this was a trap, or if she <em>should<em> tell someone and get back up. This wasn’t smart, and she knew it, but she didn’t care. Love made her stupid, and although Agatha prided herself on being anything but, this was Rio.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She grabbed her gun and her car keys and made her way upstate.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The warehouse was old and abandoned.<br/>
</p><p>It was tucked away in the middle of nowhere, and there was no indication that anyone was in it at all. That was a major red flag and only encouraged Agatha’s suspicion that this may be a trap.<br/>
She went inside anyway.<br/>
</p><p>The large space was cold compared to outside. A chill ran down Agatha’s spine as she took in the place littered with stacks of wooden planks that reached the ceiling. She pulled out her gun and ventured further into the warehouse.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha went down the rows of wood that split the place up into long corridors. She went gun first as she stepped into each row, her eyes scanning for something, <em>anything<em> that might give away why she had been asked to come here.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She was nearing the last couple of rows when Agatha started to lose hope. Either she was about to be trapped herself, or someone was getting off on messing with her. She didn’t have time for this, not when she could be out looking for Rio, not when Rio was missing, not when Rio was right in front of her…<br/>
</p><p>Her back was turned, but Agatha would recognise that head of dark shoulder-length hair anywhere.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby?” Agatha asked, her voice hesitant even though she knew it was her.<br/>
</p><p>She watched Rio’s body go rigid, watched her turn slowly, watched her face twist in horror.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was taken aback by Rio’s expression, but shoved the thought away because who cared right? Rio was in front of her, and she seemed unharmed, apart from her right hand, which had a white bandage wrapped around it.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re okay!” Agatha exclaimed. When she stepped towards Rio to hug her, her wife took a step back.<br/>
</p><p>She tried to ignore how much that hurt.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Rio’s voice trembled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. When she pictured them reuniting, it had not gone like this.<br/>
</p><p>“I-” she started, then stopped because she genuinely didn’t know what to say. Why was Rio acting like this?<br/>
</p><p>“You need to leave,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked, words getting lost on her until she realised the reply was obvious. “Not without you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s going on?” Agatha took another step forward as Rio stepped back. “Why are you acting like this? You're safe now, I’ll protect you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head again. “No,” she whispered. “Please…please, you need to go.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was getting pissed off now. Did her wife not trust her to protect her? Why couldn’t Rio see that now they were together again, they were back to being a team? A team that jumped out of planes and blew up buildings. A dead shot and one of the best agents in the field. A team that knew what the other was going to do without even a glance passing between them.<br/>
</p><p>Like Agatha had said, she’d met her match, and she felt sorry for the world that it’d probably have to pay for it.<br/>
</p><p>Today was no different. She and Rio were getting out of her, and after that, they would hunt down every last person that had anything to do with Rio’s kidnapping. <em>Together.<br/>
</em></p><p>“I’m not leaving you,” Agatha shot back. “Not unless someone killed me, and even in death I wouldn’t. I’d haunt you in my ghost form.” Agatha had to joke, had to try and make Rio laugh because for the past three days they’d both been in hell.<br/>
</p><p>But Rio didn't laugh, didn’t even smile.<br/>
</p><p>“If you won’t leave, then I will.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to leave, and Agatha grabbed at her arm. She spun Rio around, and Agatha had to block the fist that was aimed at her face.<br/>
</p><p>She jerked her head back, betrayal sinking into her stomach because why had Rio done that?<br/>
</p><p>Her wife was glaring at her as she tried to yank the arm Agatha was still gripping free.<br/>
</p><p>“Let go of me!”<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me what’s going on? Who took you? Why don’t you want to come with me?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was getting more frustrated with every question. She brought down her free hand onto Agatha’s arm, hitting it like a knife slicing through vegetables. Agatha snatched her arm back with a yelp as pain spread through it.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, what the hell?!”<br/>
</p><p>Her wife was turning to leave again, and Agatha grabbed her wrist once more.<br/>
</p><p>Yet again, Rio tried to punch her, and Agatha had to block it. She twisted her wrist sharply and freed herself before shoving Agatha back roughly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at her, her chest rising and falling, her heartbeat thumping wildly against her ribcage. “Why are you doing this? Talk to me.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m leaving,” Rio replied matter-of-factly.<br/>
</p><p>Again, Agatha wouldn’t let her. Why did Rio think she could just walk away from this? From them? And Agatha would just let her?<br/>
</p><p>She grabbed at Rio’s arm again, twisted her around and crashed their lips together. She hoped the kiss said: <em>I’m here, I’m not leaving you, I love you.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio pushed her back. The expression on her face, which was pure anger mere moments ago, was pained. Agatha could see the tears collecting in her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t do that,” Rio whispered.<br/>
</p><p>“Why not?” When Agatha stepped towards her this time, her wife didn’t step back. “Why not, sweetheart?” She asked softly.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled Rio into her arms and hugged her. Agatha hadn’t realised it until Rio gripped her back, but her body had felt like lead. Having Rio pressed against her made her feel light as air. She could breathe again, function like a human being again.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re never going to let me go, are you?” Rio spoke moments later from where her chin was resting on Agatha’s shoulder.<br/>
</p><p>“Never,” Agatha replied as she cradled Rio’s head. “Whatever is going on with you, you’re going to tell me and we’re going to deal with it together. Like always.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a noise that seemed to be a cross between a sob and a frustrated huff.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha only gripped her tighter (if that were even possible). Whatever it was that Rio’s attackers had on her must be bad for her to be acting like this. She let her body sink further into her wife’s hold, relaxing until…<br/>
</p><p>Wet?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt something trickling down her leg, she furrowed her eyebrows until a stinging started up in said leg.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio stepped back, Agatha looked down to find a knife buried in her right thigh. She snapped her head up and looked at Rio in horror.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife had stabbed her.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t…I don’t understand,” Agatha got out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was wearing her unsettling mask of detachment. Agatha hadn’t seen it in months.<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t chase me down if you can’t run,” Rio replied coolly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt tears running down her face, whether that was from the pain or heartbreak, she didn’t know.<br/>
</p><p>“Goodbye, Mrs Smith,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha took a step forward and groaned when her leg buckled, and agonising pain spread across it. Rio was right, she couldn’t run after her like this.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, baby, don’t do this,” Agatha pleaded. “Don’t leave me.”<br/>
</p><p>It reminded her of when the situation had been reversed. When she’d gotten the first round of texts, and she was trying to tell Rio that she should get a new partner. And Rio had begged her not to leave her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s mask of detachment didn’t waver.<br/>
</p><p>“Please, my love,” Agatha choked out. “<em>Please.<em>” Even though her body screamed at her not to, Agatha took another step closer.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio reached into her pocket and grabbed another knife. “Take another step and the next ones in your heart.”<br/>
</p><p>“Do it,” Agatha replied without missing a beat. “It’s yours anyway.”<br/>
</p><p>She saw her wife’s eyes flick upwards before something smacked her in the head.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had been knocked out cold.</p>

<p>Rio blinked. “Where did you get these from?”<br/>
</p><p>Marina smiled. “Where do you think?”<br/>
</p><p>They were pictures of Nicky. There were photos of him at school, eating breakfast in his home, out at a restaurant with Wanda, in Central Park with Agatha and Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Someone is watching the boy at all hours of every day. He’s even been here.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s head snapped up. “How?” She all but demanded.<br/>
</p><p>Marina’s smile didn’t waver. “He has a friend at school, he even learnt Spanish for her when she moved here just recently. It was quite sweet actually.” Marina shrugged. “Anyway, we’re using her as well as many other people. She’s been instructed to kill him if we say so.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “You would use a little girl to kill another child?”<br/>
</p><p>Marina stared at her as if it were obvious.<br/>
</p><p>“Why…why would she do that?”<br/>
</p><p>“We’ve told her if she doesn’t follow instructions, then we’d kill her parents back in Mexico…we haven’t told her that they’re already dead…but what does it matter.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio could only blink at her. Marina was sick in the fucking head.<br/>
</p><p>But was that what they were doing with Nicky? Was he already dead, and she was just saying that to get Rio to do whatever they wanted her to do…whatever that was.<br/>
</p><p>“How do I know he’s not already dead?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t,” Marina answered simply.<br/>
</p><p>“Then why would I-”<br/>
</p><p>“Would you risk it?” Marina cut her off. “You’d be killing your wife’s only child, the love of her life. She would never be able to forgive you, and you’d lose them both.” Marina pulled out her phone.<br/>
</p><p>She fiddled with it momentarily before the room filled with Nicky’s cries. He was screaming and wailing at the top of his lungs. Rio winced. If her hands weren’t handcuffed, she would’ve covered her ears because she’d never heard a more horrifying sound in her life.<br/>
</p><p>“Please,” Rio pleaded. “Stop it.”<br/>
</p><p>Marina didn’t. She let the sound play on.<br/>
</p><p>“And guess what, I can add this,” Marina continued. She tapped more buttons, and the next thing Rio knew, she heard:<br/>
</p><p>“Mami! Mami, it <em>hurts<em>.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>That did it for Rio. Tears poured down her face as that sentence repeated.<br/>
</p><p>“Mami, you can stop this! Stop it!”<br/>
</p><p>“Stop it!” Rio screamed herself.<br/>
</p><p>This time Marina complied. She let out a low whistle. “Technology has come a long way. You just need someone’s voice, and you can manipulate it to say anything. That’s how you get masterpieces like that!”<br/>
</p><p>“What do you want?” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Marina narrowed her eyes before she straightened up. “You to give us everything you know about the FBI. We want passwords, safehouse locations, agent names. All of it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio scoffed.<br/>
</p><p>“You think I’m joking? You think I would joke when I just threatened to kill your son? Your <em>wife’s<em> son. I could have him killed like,” she snapped her fingers, “That. I’ve got moles in the FBI, so even if you’re thinking ‘Nicky will be fine, he’s probably tucked away in a safehouse somewhere,’ I have that safehouse location.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“If you’ve got moles, why do you need me?” Rio shot back.<br/>
</p><p>“Because you know far more than they’ll ever know, princess. Plus, this is way easier.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wiped at her face with her shoulder. They had her. Now she was going to be a rat betraying her country and her job because she couldn’t let anything happen to Nicky, <em>wouldn’t<em>. The Rio Vidal, before she joined The Smith’s Programme, would never have dreamed of doing such a thing. She would compartmentalise, detach, and let them kill an innocent boy before she betrayed her government.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>But now Rio’s heart was full and beating. The art of detachment, which was once her only way of life, was a foreign language to her.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispered.<br/>
</p><p>Marina grinned. “Atta girl. You should get some rest; you’ve got a long day of government secret sharing ahead of you tomorrow.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her.<br/>
</p><p>“What? I’m not a pure evil,” Marina laughed. She clapped her hands three times, and the door opened.<br/>
</p><p>A man Rio had never seen before came in.<br/>
</p><p>“Put her with the other one.”<br/>
</p><p>The man nodded, and before Rio could think, another needle was jammed into her arm.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio woke up with a wince. Her arm was throbbing. Everything felt slow…too slow, like the world had been put in slow motion. She didn’t want to think about how many drugs were probably in her system right now.<br/>
</p><p>They’d moved her once more. As Rio’s consciousness returned, she started to make out the room. It was smaller than the first one she’d been in; the walls were grey and there was a carpet. It was white and covered with various large patches of dried blood.<br/>
</p><p>She was also handcuffed to a wall again.<br/>
</p><p>“You scared me for a second there,” a soft voice said. “You’ve been out for a while.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio forced her head to move in the direction of the voice.<br/>
</p><p>“Isabella?” Rio blinked.<br/>
</p><p>The other woman shot up from where she was slumped against the wall she was handcuffed to. “You know me?"<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>The <em>real<em> Isabella Alonso, last year's Miss America beauty pageant winner. Her wife had killed the fake one when the real one had been found out to be missing a few hours before.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She was missing no more.<br/>
</p><p>“What…” Rio tried because she was finding it difficult to speak. “What do they want from you?”<br/>
</p><p>Isabella shrugged. “I don’t know, they don’t speak to me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio thought, even now, even covered in dried blood and dirt, that Isabella looked beautiful. She truly was Miss America.<br/>
</p><p>“How…how long have you been here for?”<br/>
</p><p>Isabella shrugged again. “I don’t know.”<br/>
</p><p>The door rattling pulled Rio’s attention off her.<br/>
</p><p>It opened to reveal a little girl with two cups of water. She walked in slowly, her head of long, thick, wavy light brown hair swaying as she walked. Her eyes were a deep blue. Rio almost sobbed. In person, she looked so much like Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Valentina?” Rio whispered as she handed her the water.<br/>
</p><p>She knew what Nicky’s friend looked like. He would show them photos of the two of them on playdates whenever he had the chance.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s…it’s Noa,” she squeaked.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky had been teaching her well then. She’d thought to reply in English first.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “Es hermoso.” <em>It’s beautiful.<br/>
</em></p><p>Noa smiled. “Gracias.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio noticed the huge bruise on her arm then. It seemed Noa had seen her look at it too because she hid her arm behind her back and walked over to Isabella with the other cup. Once she was done, she left the room without another word.<br/>
</p><p>Rio decided then that even if she was fated to die and couldn’t escape, she would help Noa to. She didn’t know how, but she would if it were the last thing she did.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know how many days it had been since she’d been kidnapped. She hadn’t seen the light of day since Agatha’s birthday. Her days consisted of being trapped in a room with Isabella, sat at a table writing out passwords and data, and trying to talk to Noa as much as possible whenever the little girl came in to give them food or water.<br/>
</p><p>Rio would try to make her laugh or smile whenever she could because every time the girl returned, she’d have a new bruise on her arm or face. Why were they hurting her? What had she done? They weren’t even hurting Rio to her surprise.<br/>
</p><p>The only person hurting Rio was herself. She’d cut her palm with the glass she’d dropped when they snuck up on her to kidnap her. She remembered that fact after they’d stopped sedating her so frequently. She would dig into the cuts to ground her, to stop her spinning out of control, and the cuts would reopen. Daniel had bandaged her hand when they noticed.<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t write if you’re injured,” he’d told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was going to kill him and every person who had laid a hand on Noa and Isabella.<br/>
</p><p>She was back at her usual table, in the usual room, in the usual handcuffs as she wrote the next set of codes Marina had asked for, when she caught sentences of what appeared to be a heated conversation.<br/>
</p><p>“You underestimate how much she loves her,” Daniel whispered. “The woman told us and our eyes in the FBI have reported the same thing. She’s like a madwoman. She doesn’t sleep; she doesn’t even eat. She’s just waiting until they find her, and then what? She’ll come.”<br/>
</p><p>“Our eyes will throw them off the scent. They won’t find us or her before she’s dead,” Marina replied.<br/>
</p><p>“We need to do something. We need her to get her to stop looking.”<br/>
</p><p>Marina huffed loudly. “Think of something, then do it.” Rio heard her walking away.<br/>
</p><p>She smiled because, of course, her wife was looking for her, of course she wouldn’t stop until she’d found Rio. She was also slightly annoyed at Agatha for not eating or sleeping. Rio was missing, but that didn’t mean she stopped looking after herself.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know how long it had been until Daniel returned.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s you’re lucky day, princess. We’re going on a field trip.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The next thing Rio knew, she was in a car, blindfolded and handcuffed with two people on either side of her. It was unnecessary, she wasn’t going anywhere, the threat that they would harm Nicky in any way had stopped any thought about her trying to escape.<br/>
</p><p>The car drew to a stop, and she was yanked out of the car. It felt nice to be outside again. The air was warm and fresh, and she could feel the sun on her face. She hadn’t realised how stuffy the place they were keeping her in was until she drank in the air.<br/>
</p><p>She was tugged forward and made to walk for what felt like forever. When they pulled the blindfold off, Rio was in a warehouse, and the temperature had dropped significantly. They uncuffed her and instructed her to stand in a corridor made up of high wooden planks that reached the ceiling.<br/>
</p><p>Daniel put two knives in her pocket. “If you use them on yourself, we’ll kill the boy,” he told her.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted to ask him what they were for, but kept her mouth shut.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t look at anything but the wall in front of you until you hear that voice, or we’ll kill the boy.”<br/>
</p><p>“What voice?” Rio had to ask that one.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ll know it when you hear it. You’ll know exactly what to do,” he grinned, then he disappeared behind the planks of wood.<br/>
</p><p>The minutes droned on, and Rio tried to think of the reason why they were making her do this when she heard it. That voice, that beautiful voice.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio froze. <em>No. No, it’s not you. Please don’t let it be you.<br/>
</em></p><p>She turned slowly and lo and behold, there she was. Agatha. Rio couldn’t help but notice she looked different. Thinner, she had dark bags around her eyes and her long hair, although in a ponytail, was a mess like she hadn’t brushed it in days.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lit up when she saw Rio’s face. “You’re okay!”<br/>
</p><p>But she wasn’t, far from it.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Rio asked, she couldn’t keep the tremble out of her voice because she knew.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>We need to get her to stop looking.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>That was Rio’s job. That’s why she was there. To say or do something to make her wife never look her in the eyes again.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha stepped towards her, she stepped back because she couldn't do this, couldn’t hurt her wife. She’d rather die.<br/>
</p><p>She’d told her wife to leave, and to no surprise to Rio, she flat out refused. Agatha picked up on the fact that something was wrong immediately, and Rio wanted nothing more than to tell her. Tell her about Nicky, about the Serpiente’s, about Isabella and Noa.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll protect you,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I know you usually can, but not from this.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She could see her wife getting angrier the more she refused to go with her.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not leaving you. Not unless someone killed me, and even in death, I wouldn’t. I’d haunt you in my ghost form,” Agatha quipped.<br/>
</p><p>Even at her lowest, her wife would still find ways to tease and make jokes. Rio wanted nothing more than to smile and laugh, but the situation was too dire, too awful to even consider it.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t do this. She couldn’t stand there and listen to her wife ask her to leave with her and not be able to comply, not be able to do exactly as she said, because Rio always did. Like she said, Agatha could ask her to rip out her own kidney, and she’d do it without a second thought.<br/>
</p><p>So, refusing her? It was Rio’s idea of hell. Consequences be damned Rio was done with this.<br/>
</p><p>“If you won’t leave, then I will.”<br/>
</p><p>She turned to do just that and felt Agatha’s hand on her arm. She could’ve cried, to feel her wife’s touch again after however long without it, felt like Rio’s body was alive again. That she’d been dead and now she was being brought back to the living. But Agatha couldn’t touch her otherwise, Rio would do something silly like try to leave with her.<br/>
</p><p>The only thing Rio could think of to get her to stop was to pretend to harm her. She didn’t want to, she really didn’t, but she brought her fist up and swung.<br/>
</p><p>Just as Rio knew she would, Agatha blocked it with ease. The look on her wife’s face, however, the horror and betrayal would be etched into Rio’s mind forever.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha kept questioning her, kept touching her, and Rio really did have to hit her to get her to let go.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m leaving,” Rio told her after the last time Agatha grabbed her wrist.<br/>
</p><p>She turned to leave once more, and this time, when Agatha spun her around, she kissed her. She fucking kissed her, and all Rio wanted to do was sink into it. Agatha’s lips were so soft, so warm, so perfect in every way imaginable. Rio didn’t know if she’d ever get the opportunity to kiss her wife again.<br/>
</p><p>This was a gift, a gift she couldn’t keep.<br/>
</p><p>She pushed Agatha away before she got lost in it, before she did something stupid. She could feel the tears collecting in her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t do that,” Rio got out.<br/>
</p><p>“Why not?” And then Agatha was stepping closer, and Rio couldn’t bring herself to step back again. She <em>wanted<em> her wife to touch her, to kiss her. She never wanted to be apart from her, not now, not ever.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Why not, sweetheart?” Agatha asked softly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was a goner. Her wife stepped into her orbit and wrapped her arms around her. What was the point, right? Of fighting her, of trying to get her to leave. Because Agatha wouldn’t, and neither would Rio.<br/>
</p><p>She would never leave her; she promised her that.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re never going to let me go, are you?” Rio spoke into the silence moments later, tears slipping down her face.<br/>
</p><p>The reply came quickly. “Never.” She felt her wife run her fingers through her hair. “Whatever is going on with you, you’re going to tell me, and we’re going to deal with it together. Like always.”<br/>
</p><p>The realisation hit Rio like a ton of bricks because there <em>was<em> a point. Nicky. His life, that’s what was going on with her, that’s why she couldn’t go with Agatha. Rio had forgotten in the haze of it all, seeing Agatha again, touching her, kissing her.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>We need to get her to stop looking.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>That was Rio’s job. To do something so hurtful that her wife would never look for again. So that Nicky could be safe.<br/>
</p><p>She remembered the knives in her pockets and knew exactly why she’d been given them. The answer was clear as day now.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a sob as she discreetly reached into her pocket as her wife’s grip around her tightened. If Rio was going to do this, she needed to detach or at least appear detached. She could do that; she <em>had<em> to do that.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It was the only way.<br/>
</p><p>The knife was in her hand now, just before Agatha’s thigh.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I love you, I’m sorry.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio plunged the knife in.<br/>
</p><p>The look on Agatha’s face when she realised what she had done would haunt Rio until the end of time.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t…I don’t understand,” Agatha got out.<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t chase me down if you can’t run,” Rio replied in what she hoped was an even tone.<br/>
</p><p>Rio thought she might throw up. To look at Agatha with blood pouring down her leg, knowing <em>she<em> was the one who had done that, threatened to kill her. She wanted to run towards her, call her an ambulance, apologise until she couldn’t breathe.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She couldn’t.<br/>
</p><p>She had to stand there and pretend that none of this was bothering her when that couldn’t be further from the truth.<br/>
</p><p>Tears started running down Agatha’s face, and Rio needed this to be over.<br/>
</p><p>“Goodbye, Mrs Smith.” She couldn’t say her name; Rio didn’t deserve to say it again after what she’d just done.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha took a step and groaned, Rio had to force herself not to wince at the devastating sound. Her body twitched to surge forward and help her, but Rio forced herself to stay put.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, baby, don’t do this.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Baby. Don’t call me that, please don’t. I no longer deserve it. Hate me. Please hate me. Stop fighting for me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Don’t leave me.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t want to!<em> Rio wanted to say, wanted to scream at the top of her lungs.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“Please, my love,” Agatha cried. “Please.”<br/>
</p><p>Her wife took another step, and Rio reached for the second knife. Her hand was trembling, but she tightened her grip around the knife to stop it.<br/>
</p><p>“Take another step and the next ones in your heart,” Rio forced out because that had to work, right? That would hurt so much that Agatha would be so disgusted she’d be done with her for good.<br/>
</p><p>But it didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>“Do it,” Agatha replied without missing a beat. “It’s yours anyway.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio could cry, would cry if she were allowed to, because her heart belonged to Agatha as well. Rio figured it what stop beating after this. It would fossilise, and she would live out the rest of her days without it until her death sentence came.<br/>
</p><p>Because after today, Rio might as well be dead.<br/>
</p><p>Daniel came out of seemingly nowhere, a wooden plank raised above his head, before he smacked Agatha over the head with it.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife crashed to the ground with a thud.<br/>
</p><p>“No!” Rio screamed, surging forward.<br/>
</p><p>She could harm her wife (and only to protect her); nobody else on planet earth could.<br/>
</p><p>She rushed over to Agatha and fell to the floor, putting Agatha’s head on her lap as she brushed through her dark waves. Tears slipped down her face and onto her wife’s cheeks, she hastily wiped them away.<br/>
</p><p>“Up,” Daniel demanded. “You did well, we’re done here.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio ignored him and fished around in her wife’s back pocket for a phone. She found it, clicked it on and sent a message to Jen and Alice telling them to track Agatha’s phone and call an ambulance.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing?” Daniel yelled. He reached for her, and Rio held out the knife she didn’t use to get him to back off.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m coming with you, okay! But I’m not leaving until I know someone’s coming to get her.”<br/>
</p><p>Daniel scoffed. “You don’t have a choice. Get up before I hurt you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Fucking kill me then because I’m not leaving her like this!” Rio shot back.<br/>
</p><p>Daniel said nothing.<br/>
</p><p>When it was confirmed that help was on the way, Rio slid Agatha’s phone back into her pocket and kissed her twice. Once for her, once for Nicky, before she rested her head down gently on the ground.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I love you, I love you, I’m sorry, I love you.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She got up and handed the knife back to Daniel, who yanked her by the arm and dragged her away from her unconscious wife.</p>

<p>She was in a hospital. Agatha fucking hated hospitals.<br/>
</p><p>It was the smell more than anything. It was unsettling, like it was trying to be clean, but instead the smell of antiseptic was just a big cloud of fog trying to conceal all of the diseases and sicknesses that filled every corridor, every room, every corner.<br/>
</p><p>She was attached to a drip; whatever painkiller they were giving her filling her bloodstream. There was a huge lump on her head that was concealed behind a bandage, and her thigh had been stitched up.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t felt so trapped in days, and that was saying something. Between MO and the safehouse, the hospital was by far the worst enclosure she had found herself in.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes snapped to green.<br/>
</p><p>And to make things fucking worse Wanda was there.<br/>
</p><p>Jen and Alice had taken Nicky to the vending machine to buy him some snacks.<br/>
</p><p>“Have you been listening to me?”<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda sighed. “I said they should be letting you out soon.”<br/>
</p><p>Good. Because then she could finally return to trying to find Rio. She’d been in the hospital for far too long now, not being able to do a thing. She’d tried to escape on multiple occasions, but there were FBI agents crawling about the place, making sure she stayed put.<br/>
</p><p>It had happened more times than she’d like to admit, her trying to escape and agents dragging her back to her room, kicking and screaming. She’d started losing track of time, the pain in her leg, plus her concussion, plus the painkillers kept knocking her out. She wanted them to lay off the painkillers because of it, but the doctors told her it would make her feel better.<br/>
</p><p>That was fucking bullshit because no matter what drug they gave her Agatha wouldn’t be fine until she found Rio again.<br/>
</p><p>“Where do you want to go after this? We can’t stay in New York, it’s not safe.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>We<em> as if they were in this together, as if they were a team. The only team Agatha belonged to included her wife, her two best friends, and her son. Wanda’s were not included.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“I’m going to find Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda’s jaw dropped. “You…you still want to find her?”<br/>
</p><p>If Agatha was the one who had been concussed, why was her ex acting so slow?<br/>
</p><p>“I just said that, didn’t I?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“But…but she,” Wanda spluttered. “She fucking stabbed you!”<br/>
</p><p>“So?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda gaped at her. “So…so why would you want anything to do with her?”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh…I don’t know because she’s my fucking wife,” Agatha replied sarcastically.<br/>
</p><p>“Who stabbed you!” Wanda shot back.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you understand how fucking insane that is? The woman who supposedly loves you fucking stabbed you!”<br/>
</p><p>“And she also told Alice and Jen to come get me and call me an ambulance. So, what does that tell you? That she didn’t fucking want to. Jesus, Wanda, use your brain.”<br/>
</p><p>“I…” Wanda started, then stopped. “You love her too much. It’ll kill you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Let it,” Agatha replied without missing a beat.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda scoffed. “What about Nicky? Your son. You’d let yourself get killed for her? You’d leave him without his mother, for her?”<br/>
</p><p>Now that stopped Agatha dead in her tracks. <em>Nicky.<em> No, she wouldn’t leave him. That boy was everything to her, everything to each of his mothers. Wanda, her, Rio…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Rio.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha shot up.<br/>
</p><p>That was it. That was what they had on her, her son. Rio would rather die than let anything happen to him, just as Agatha would.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha said without looking at her. “You’re a fucking genius.”<br/>
</p><p>“I…what?” The redhead stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio had her eyes closed, her head against the wall as tears slipped down her face. She’d just woken up from her fifth round of sedatives. They’d told her she was being hysterical and needed a time out…multiple.<br/>
</p><p>After she’d stabbed Agatha and Daniel had handcuffed her and yanked her towards the car, she couldn’t stop crying. How had she done that? She’d left Agatha by herself in the middle of fucking nowhere bleeding out and unconscious.<br/>
</p><p>She would’ve been fine with just the stabbing, Rio made sure she hadn’t punctured any fatal areas, all she would need was some stitches. But then Daniel had knocked her out. What for? He didn’t need to do that.<br/>
</p><p>Had Rio killed her? Had Rio killed her own wife?<br/>
</p><p>She would never know because she would never see Agatha again.<br/>
</p><p>She did try after a while to run back to the warehouse to make sure Agatha was okay, but Daniel grabbed her, picked her up and dragged her towards the car, kicking and screaming.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>How could I do that?<em> Rio asked herself often.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>
<em>To protect her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>But did I?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio didn’t think so.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay?” Isabella asked from the other side of the room.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio replied flatly. The drugs made her mouth move faster than her brain had the chance to process, so she couldn’t lie if she tried.<br/>
</p><p>“Want to talk about it?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. She couldn’t talk about it. Her thoughts were vile enough, she didn’t need to hear what an awful person she was from another person’s mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Isabella replied. “But if it’s about your wife, don’t beat yourself up about it,” she shrugged. “You did what you had to do.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio opened her eyes at that. “You know?”<br/>
</p><p>Isabella nodded. “Nobody keeps their mouth shut in this place. Everyone talks about ‘The Princess and her mad wife.’”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed at that, wiping at the tears on her face.<br/>
</p><p>She sniffled. “I had to hurt her.”<br/>
</p><p>Isabella nodded slowly. “But you didn’t want,” she replied as if it were the truth, which it was.<br/>
</p><p>“No. I’d rather hurt myself than hurt her.”<br/>
</p><p>“And you’re scared she won’t forgive you, and that’s why you’re upset?” Isabella asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a wet laugh, shaking her head. “That’s the worst part. I did it, and she still wanted me. So, it’s like, what did I do it for?”<br/>
</p><p>“A reason that made sense at the time. A reason that has probably saved her from why they needed you to do it in the first place.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pressed her lips into a thin line as she took in Isabella’s words.<br/>
</p><p>“She must love you an awful lot. You’re lucky to be loved like that,” Isabella told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pressed the heels of her hands into her eyes. “But that’s the problem. I <em>stabbed<em> her. I broke skin and drew blood. You’re not supposed to…you’re not supposed to still love someone after that.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“But that’s the thing about love,” Isabella replied. “One choice doesn’t stop it. It continues to flow at full force even when you feel it shouldn’t. It doesn’t just turn off.”<br/>
</p><p>“But shouldn’t it?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but feel like Wanda. The ginger bitch had gotten away with so much and yet Agatha still loved her. She didn’t want her wife to forgive her for this. Rio hoped that once she was dead, all Agatha would feel was resentment. That she would remember the pain and the stitches and the hospital (her wife hated hospitals) and feel all of that instead of her love for Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Because Rio no longer deserved it.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Everyone had returned to the safehouse, leaving Agatha alone in the hospital. She begged them to take her with them, but her doctor refused, telling her she still needed at least one more night there.<br/>
</p><p>The shadows from the trees outside her window kept moving, crawling about her room as if they were evil spirits ready to snatch her soul. As much as Rio liked to disagree, Agatha didn’t scare easy. It was just the fact that she was in a hospital at night alone.<br/>
</p><p>Now, the sudden blare of car horns that she’d been accustomed to after a life living in the city made her jump. Agatha hated this, she wanted to go home, she wanted to be with Nicky, she wanted…<br/>
</p><p>She wanted Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes snapped to her open hospital room when a shadow flashed across the threshold. She reached under the covers for her gun. She was <em>supposed<em> to be protected by the agents outside, but after everything that had happened, Agatha had a theory…no, she was certain…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>There were moles in the FBI.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t sure if they would be after her; it was clear Rio’s kidnappers weren’t. At the warehouse, they had every opportunity to kill her, and they hadn’t.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha curled her finger around the trigger, ready for if she needed it, when the light in her doorway fluctuated again.<br/>
</p><p>She snapped her gun up when a man appeared in the threshold. He stared at her, his hands up in surrender. In the dim light, it was hard to make out the man’s face. He had a mix of dark brown and grey hair and what looked like a goatee.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not here to hurt you,” the man told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Like I’m supposed to believe that.”<br/>
</p><p>“I swear it, Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>How did he know her name?<br/>
</p><p>He stepped further into the room, even though she still had her gun pointed at him.<br/>
</p><p>She caught the glint of deep brown in his eyes as they reflected the light off the lamp posts outside. They weren’t the brown eyes she’d fallen in love with, but they were…similar.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha squeezed the trigger slightly. “What do you want?” She snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“The same thing you do,” Rio’s father replied simply.<br/>
</p><p>She knew it was him; Vidal eyes were so distinguishable. Agatha thought of Rio and the pictures she’d shown her of her Abuela, and the similarities were so clear it was almost frightening.<br/>
</p><p>“To save my daughter, both of them.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. Both of them? Rio had never mentioned having a sister.<br/>
</p><p>“I tried to warn you,” he continued. “I thought that text would’ve scared you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hand clenched around her gun and she damn well near pulled it. “<em>You<em> were the one texting me?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I texted you once three months ago. I never texted you again. I thought you would care more about my daughter’s safety than whatever relationship you had built with her.”<br/>
</p><p>“I…” Agatha started, then stopped.<br/>
</p><p>This was her fucking fault. If she hadn’t been selfish, if she hadn’t been <em>weak<em> and not crumbled the second Rio begged her not to leave her then none of this would’ve fucking happened.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Fucking stupid.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio’s father stepped closer regardless of the gun trained on him. “It doesn’t matter now, we need to get her back, both of them. The Serpientes, they are terrible people. Every inhumane thing you can think of they have a hand in it. Child trafficking, sex slaves, you name it, and they’ve done it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed. To think of Rio being stripped of her identity and sold to the highest bidder made bile climb up her throat.<br/>
</p><p>“I know that’s what they plan to do with Isabella, make her a sex worker. I am still unsure what they want with Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>“Isabella?” Agatha questioned. Like…Isabella, last year's Mrs America’s winner? She was Rio’s sister?<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s father nodded. “I know where the Serpiente’s headquarters are. You must go there and get them.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lowered her gun slightly. “How?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s father sighed. “I used to be their leader.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snapped her gun back up. Rio’s father had just told her the Serpientes were terrible people, and yet he had been their leader? What. The. Fuck.<br/>
</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking, but it was not that way when I was in control. When it started to go south, I left. For my wife, for Rio. They would expect her to be something I never wanted her to grow up to be. So, I hid her, and they killed my wife.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stared at him. She didn’t trust him, not even a little bit. But if he knew where Rio was, she wouldn’t do anything to him…yet.<br/>
</p><p>“Why do you want to protect her now? You’re thirty three years fucking late don’t you think?” Agatha stated.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve been watching her all those years, looking out for her in ways she’ll never know. You have to stay away from the people you love in order to protect them. You do that…with Nicholas.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back at the mention of her son. “How do you-?”<br/>
</p><p>“Like I said, I’ve been looking out for her,” Rio’s father cut her off. “And recently that has also meant watching you.”<br/>
</p><p>“If you’ve been watching us, then why didn’t you see this coming?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“I did. I warned you,” he replied.<br/>
</p><p>And now Agatha was pissed. “Then why the fuck did you let it happen? Why did you let them fucking take her?!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s father simply stared at her before he continued. “You can’t trust anyone at the FBI apart from your two friends and Agent Calderu. Have them look after Nicholas while you get Rio and Isabella.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at him. She was aware he’d completely dodged her question, but getting Rio was far more important. “You want me to infiltrate the Serpiente headquarters…alone?”<br/>
</p><p>He nodded. “I trust you won’t need backup. You are a good agent…one of the best, and you have enough rage in you, for what they did to Rio, to the both of you to get the job done.” He smiled for he first time since he stepped foot in the room. “Plus, you’ll have some extra help should you need it.”<br/>
</p><p>“How do you know any of this? How are you even in here?” Agatha blurted out.<br/>
</p><p>“I have help,” Rio’s father replied with no further context. “Now, you know what to do, Agatha. Protect your son, get my daughters.” He turned to leave.<br/>
</p><p>“Why can’t you do it?” She had to ask, she would never let anyone else rescue Rio, but she wanted to know why her father had no intention of doing so.<br/>
</p><p>He stopped in his tracks. “You love her?” He asked instead of answering.<br/>
</p><p>“More than you ever will,” Agatha replied without missing a beat.<br/>
</p><p>“Then it’s best you do it,” Rio’s father replied. “You’ll have her location when you wake up tomorrow. Get some sleep, Agatha. You’ll need it.”<br/>
</p><p>“But why do they want her <em>now<em>?” Agatha blurted out again because she still had more questions.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Sleep, Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s father disappeared through the threshold.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“Isa…” Rio started.<br/>
</p><p>What she assumed to have been yesterday, after Noa had come in, fed her (physically because Rio’s arm’s were dead to the word. She noticed them beginning to stop working after she’d had that conversation with Isabella, like they were trying to paralyse her), and given her water, they knocked her out again.<br/>
</p><p>She’d woken up to the sound of Isabella crying.<br/>
</p><p>“Isabella, what’s wrong?” Rio asked, shuffling as close to her as her bounds would allow her. The distance of the room still separated them a great deal.<br/>
</p><p>Isabella hadn’t cried once since she’d been here.<br/>
</p><p>Glassy, dark brown eyes looked up, tears streaming down her face. “I finally know what they want with me.”<br/>
</p><p>Panic exploded in Rio’s chest. She said nothing, allowing Isabella to continue if she wanted to.<br/>
</p><p>“Sex work,” Isabella said bitterly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s body went stiff. Not on her fucking watch.<br/>
</p><p>“Have they…” Rio trailed off. She needed to word this right. “Did they touch you?” Rio asked softly.<br/>
</p><p>Isabella shook her head. “Not yet. But they will.”<br/>
</p><p>“I won’t let it,” Rio replied firmly. “They won’t lay a finger on you, I <em>swear<em> it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Isabella offered her a small smile. “I appreciate it, Rio, really. But there is no hope for me. You’ll be dead soon.”<br/>
</p><p>And she hadn’t sugar-coated it because they both knew.<br/>
</p><p>But Rio meant what she said. She shuffled closer until her chains were physically yanking her back. “Listen to me, I-”<br/>
</p><p>She cut herself off when a commotion started up outside. Heated conversations in Spanish were muffled behind the closed door until said door opened.<br/>
</p><p>“Get her and let’s go,” Marina said as Daniel stormed into the room towards Rio. “She’s here.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The Serpiente’s headquarters were a huge mansion in upstate New York. It was in a lovely little neighbourhood, with lovely little neighbours who would never suspect they were living next to notorious criminals.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s father told Agatha that they were keeping Rio in the basement and the best way for her to enter the house would be right through the front door…as a prostitute. He’d told her that the members not in the basement would be low-level and less likely to recognise her; they’d probably only know her name. Plus, it was common to have men and women in and out purely for sex.<br/>
</p><p>Once Agatha had relayed the plan to Jen, Alice and Lilia, she had a very heartfelt goodbye with Nicky, telling him she had a mission she needed to take care of and to be good for his Aunts. Agatha left for the location, Lilia on her tail.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled to a stop a few houses down from the Serpiente’s mansion. It was a white building with a green roof that reminded her of rusted iron; it had pointed turrets on either side of the wide house, and there were many, <em>many<em> windows. The house was four levels (not including the basement).<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Fuck me,” Agatha muttered.<br/>
</p><p>Now she wasn’t <em>nervous<em>, but that was a big house and there was only one of her…well, one of her until she found Rio. She was certain a highly skilled agent against amateurs would be fine, but like she said…<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Jesus Christ, that’s a big house.”<br/>
</p><p>She checked her appearance one last time in her car mirror. Agatha was wearing light-washed jeans, a V-neck tight-fitted long-sleeved button-up white blouse that revealed her black lace bra and black leather boots. She was also wearing a decent amount of makeup and her signature deep red lipstick because she had to look the part.<br/>
</p><p>Her hair was down and wavy, but she had a hair band on her wrist for when things would get…messy later. She’d also painted her nails a deep red to match her lipstick, but that was more from being bored out of her mind sitting at the hospital, ready to be released than anything else.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha was happy she had her gun, three knives, and com, she hopped out of the car and made her way to the house, nodding at Lilia when she passed.<br/>
</p><p>“Shout if you need backup,” Lilia told her in her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“Will do,” Agatha replied as she walked up the steps to the house.<br/>
</p><p>She knocked three times then waited.<br/>
</p><p>Moments later, a man appeared at the door. Agatha smiled that smile of hers, she used on Rio whenever she wanted her on her knees. The man’s throat bobbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said, her voice dripping with seduction. “I heard my services were needed.”<br/>
</p><p>The man with light brown hair and a snake tattoo snaking up his neck dropped his gaze to her cleavage. If she were allowed, she’d kill him right here and now. Instead, she continued to smile.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you gonna let a girl in? It’s cold out here.” (It wasn’t).<br/>
</p><p>The man nodded his head frantically and stepped aside.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Well, that was easy.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>He walked her into the house and past the kitchen, where four men sat around a table. They continued down the corridor until they reached the stairs, where she saw a shut door that definitely led to the basement.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Bingo.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She took a step towards it when a group of men and women burst through the door. In the chaos, the man who had let her in tugged her up the stairs. Of course, she could’ve freed herself if she wanted to, but that wouldn’t be smart. She’d have to take on that cluster of people all at once, and what if one escaped, ran downstairs and told them she was here? Then they’d try to move Rio before she got to her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha, for now, had to be smart.<br/>
</p><p>The man tugged her up more flights of stairs; many of the rooms she passed were shut or only had one person in them. More than once, if the person in the room saw them, they’d say something like, ‘Pedro, give her to me when you’re done,’ and Pedro would laugh, and Agatha would make a mental note to return to those rooms and kill them.<br/>
</p><p>When they hit the fourth floor, Pedro, finally, pushed a door open and let her into a room she guessed was his. Agatha looked about his room briefly until her eyes landed on him again. Pedro had stripped off his black t-shirt, and she had to suppress the urge to grimace at the half-naked man in front of her.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s your name, baby girl?” Pedro asked as he began unbuckling his belt. “I want to know whose name I’ll be moaning.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was going to throw up.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” she replied.<br/>
</p><p>Pedro nodded absentmindedly, too busy taking off his trousers for the information to register. He stalked over to her in his monkey underwear, reached his hand up to touch her face until the hand stilled.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha…Harkness…?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned like a shark.<br/>
</p><p>Pedro opened his mouth as if to shout when Agatha jammed one of her knives into his throat. His blood began to trickle down her white shirt sleeve, and she groaned.<br/>
</p><p>“Pedro, I liked this shirt! You’ve ruined it now, it was very expensive,” Agatha whined.<br/>
</p><p>Pedro started to choke and gargle. “Puta.” <em>Bitch<em>. He got out before he spat blood at her. She felt the hot liquid on her face and exposed chest.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes before shoving the knife in further until the light in Pedro’s eyes went out. She wrenched her knife free and shoved his body to the ground.<br/>
</p><p>She grimaced as she wiped the blood mixed with spit off her face. Agatha didn’t mind blood, but not when it was spat at her by a <em>man.<br/>
</em></p><p>She kicked him once before exiting the room.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha went back down the stairs to a room on the third floor of a man who had asked Pedro for her once he was done. She knocked, hiding her bloody hands behind her back.<br/>
</p><p>He looked up at her in surprise. “That was quick.”<br/>
</p><p>“Pedro doesn’t last long,” Agatha told him with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>The man scoffed. “I told him he needed to work on that.”<br/>
</p><p>“Can I come in?”<br/>
</p><p>The man nodded. “Hey, what’s on your face?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked at him innocently. “My face? Oh! Kool-Aid.”<br/>
</p><p>The man, so horny and desperate didn’t question her again. He yanked her by the waist, pulling her towards him, seemingly to kiss her, but he paused.<br/>
</p><p>“That…that doesn’t look like Kool-Aid?”<br/>
</p><p>“No?” Agatha furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>He paused, staring at her for a long moment until it appeared he had connected some dots. Again, he went to shout when Agatha jammed the same knife into this man’s throat.<br/>
</p><p>“Ah, ah,” she tutted. “Can’t have people knowing I’m here yet.”<br/>
</p><p>More hot blood from this man trailed down her arms, and she seriously had to ask herself what possessed her to wear white.<br/>
</p><p>She removed her knife and let the man drop to the floor. She inspected her bloody hands and noticed that her nail varnish was chipped.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you fucking serious? I <em>just<em> painted these.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha slipped out of the room and down the landing.<br/>
</p><p>Adrenaline was coursing through her veins after her first two kills. It wasn’t the same type of ecstasy she felt when she could shoot at her enemy, each bullet landing exactly where she’d want them to, time and time again, but it was close enough. It felt <em>good<em> to use her hands to get the job done, to get all these people back who had a hand in Rio’s captivity.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>As much as she wanted to go into every room and slaughter every person who had made a vulgar comment about her, she realised she couldn’t. It took too much time, and she needed to find Rio. That didn’t mean she stopped killing, though. Now covered in blood, her presence went a little less unnoticed.<br/>
</p><p>She still snuck past doors. Sometimes she was successful, others a man or woman would start screaming and she’d have to knock them, slit their throat, or stab them.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me this house is big.<em> Agatha thought when she made it to the second floor.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Now, her white shirt sleeves were mostly red, there were splatters of blood on her jeans, boots, face, exposed chest and lace bra. She looked straight out of a horror film. Agatha blew her long hair out of her face as she wiped her forehead with the back of her bloody hand.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Jesus, why is killing people so exhausting?<em> Agatha was sweating so much she could fill a bathtub.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>She scraped her hair into a high ponytail.<br/>
</p><p>As soon as she was finished, she heard the creaking of floorboards and then a fist was flying towards her face. She dodged it, ducking underneath before bringing her knee up to knee the woman in the stomach. She folded over, and Agatha hit her in the back of the head with her elbow.<br/>
</p><p>She contemplated leaving her there, but realised it wouldn’t be smart to have her out in the open. All the other bodies had been concealed behind closed doors. Agatha groaned before looping her arms underneath the limp body and shuffling towards the shut door to her left.<br/>
</p><p>She used her elbow to push down on the door handle and dragged the unconscious woman through the threshold. She dropped her body down with a huff.<br/>
</p><p>“Mierda.” <em>Shit.<em><br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha spun around to see a man reaching into his back pocket for what she assumed to be a gun. Now, that wouldn’t do. She spotted a baseball bat by the unconscious woman’s feet and grinned.<br/>
</p><p>She picked it up without hesitation and swung it down on the man’s hand as he lifted his gun. It dropped to the ground, and Agatha watched as the man’s eyes widened before she sent him to a blissful sleep with one swing of the baseball bat.<br/>
</p><p>She was splattered with more blood as it appeared she’d smashed the man’s skull in. She inspected the pale wood with its new red detailing.<br/>
</p><p>“Huh.”<br/>
</p><p>Why hadn’t someone had a baseball bat sooner? It would’ve made her life a whole lot easier.<br/>
</p><p>With her new baseball bat, she exited the room, the bat swinging in her hand as she <em>skipped<em> down the landing.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Oh, this was <em>fun<em>.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She was mildly aware that her thigh was starting to hurt. Agatha figured she’d probably ripped open the stitching.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh well.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She was too high on adrenaline to give a fuck.<br/>
</p><p>“Everything okay in there?” Lilia asked in her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“Yup,” Agatha replied when she hit the first floor.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s-”<br/>
</p><p>“Wait, hold on,” Agatha cut her off when two women came at her.<br/>
</p><p>She went to hit them with her baseball bat when one of the women kicked it out of her hand.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha kicked out with her right foot, connecting with one woman’s stomach whilst she shot out her fist at the other woman, punching her in the nose. Her head snapped back, and she didn’t get to see how much damage she caused because the other woman grabbed her foot.<br/>
</p><p>She turned back around and used the advantage of her foot being held to push off the ground. The woman let go of her leg in surprise, and Agatha flipped midair, sticking the landing as if she were an Olympic gymnast.<br/>
</p><p>The two women gaped at her.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Agatha panted. “You've never seen an FBI agent before?”<br/>
</p><p>They continued to gape until she used the back of her hands to knock them out at the same time. Once they were out cold, Agatha started fanning underneath her arms. It had been a very long time since she’d done so much physical fighting all at once. She missed using her gun, stupid having to be covert so as not to alert people of her presence.<br/>
</p><p>She picked up her bat again. “Go on, Lilia,” Agatha told the older woman as she made her way down the steps and (finally) onto the ground floor.<br/>
</p><p>She yanked the door of the basement open, pleased when it gave way and hadn’t been locked.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s the situation looking like?” Lilia asked as Agatha ran down the stairs to the door at the end.<br/>
</p><p>“I just got to the basement.”<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Only?<em>” Lilia asked in alarm.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Yes, Lilia. I had to deal with some shit,” Agatha replied as she opened the next door.<br/>
</p><p>She’d entered a long corridor with grey walls and pipes running down their lengths. It was dimly lit and empty…too empty. There wasn’t a soul in sight. Had she blown her cover? Agatha swore she was being careful…but then she’d killed or knocked out next to twenty-five people by now. Can you really be covert about that?<br/>
</p><p>She shrugged and started down the corridor, baseball bat still firmly clutched in bloody fingers. Once at the end, she came up to another corridor. She stuck her head out to check if it was safe and…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>BANG!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>A bullet almost blew her head off. Guess her presence was known after all. She pulled her head back, yanked her gun out of it’s holster and turned it down the corridor without poking her head out again, she didn’t need to, she’d seen the man’s location now.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled the trigger, heard the groan of the man when the bullet hit, and the thud of his body as it crashed to the ground.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wasn’t happy about that. She’d much rather they didn’t know <em>where<em> she was exactly; that gunshot just told everyone.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She ran down the next corridor.<br/>
</p><p>“Everything okay? I heard a gun.” Lilia asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha replied as she shoved the door she’d approached open.<br/>
</p><p>Two sets of eyes locked onto her from where they’d been standing behind it. They grinned as if they’d been expecting her.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, boys,” Agatha smiled. “Are you here for me?”<br/>
</p><p>“La esposa loca de la princesa esta buena.” The princess’s crazy wife is hot. <em>One of the men told his friend.<br/>
</em></p><p>Is that what they were calling her now? Kind of had a ring to it.<br/>
</p><p>Thank god for being an attractive woman, because when the men just stared at her, they had no chance when Agatha swung the baseball bat above her head and swung. She stepped over the now unconscious bodies and further into the surprisingly empty room until she got to the door, opened it:<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, what the fuck?!” Agatha grumbled when she hit yet <em>another<em> long corridor.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>This place was a maze, and she’d seen no sign of Rio. The next person Agatha came across, she was going to make sure to question them instead of immediately knocking them out or killing them. She rolled her eyes before moving along the next corridor.<br/>
</p><p>She pressed her body up against the wall when she heard footsteps shuffling down the corridor over. Agatha waited for the footsteps to draw closer before she shot out, snatched the woman by her shirt and forced her against the wall. She got out her knife and pressed it against her throat.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you know who I am?” Agatha asked in a low voice.<br/>
</p><p>The woman nodded frantically.<br/>
</p><p>“Good. Then you know what I want, where is she?”<br/>
</p><p>The woman’s petrified expression seemed to vanish at that. Agatha narrowed her eyes before the woman launched a ball of spit at her face.<br/>
</p><p>Why the fuck was everyone spitting at her?!<br/>
</p><p>She took great pleasure in backhanding the woman, her face snapping to the side from where she’d hit her.<br/>
</p><p>She wiped at her cheek with the hand holding her bat before she snarled, “Wanna try that again?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not telling you shit!” The woman spat. “We own the princess now; you can’t have her, she’s ours!”<br/>
</p><p>Now that just wouldn’t do.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pressed the blade into the woman’s neck until beads of blood started to appear. “No. Rio is not yours, she’s mine,” Agatha nodded. “And you’ve had her for far too long now, and I don’t like sharing.”<br/>
</p><p>The woman started choking and gasping for air.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve been referred to as her mad wife around here. Is that true?”<br/>
</p><p>The woman, now desperate to cling on to her life, started nodding frantically again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned, the woman’s blood slipping down her wrist to join the blood of her dead companions.<br/>
</p><p>“Would you like to find out why?”<br/>
</p><p>The woman shook her head as best she could.<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect!” Agatha said, her grin never wavering. She pulled her knife away, pocketing it before she dragged the woman off the wall by her hair down the new corridor. “You’re going to take me to my wife then.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>About five corridors later, the woman told her to stop outside a door. Agatha glanced at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, go on then. Open it.”<br/>
</p><p>The woman went to do so before Agatha yanked her by the hair.<br/>
</p><p>“And if you’ve trapped me, I’ll break your spine before they get the chance to do anything to me…understood?”<br/>
</p><p>The other woman nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Fantastic! Go on then.”<br/>
</p><p>The woman pulled the door open, and Agatha laid eyes on what seemed like an aeroplane bunker…minus the planes. It was just a large open space with a few cars dotted around here and there.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Huh?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>How fucking big was the place? All of this was just lying around under the entirety of upstate New York? It was like they’d entered another dimension.<br/>
</p><p>She pushed the woman further into the massive space.<br/>
</p><p>“Where is she?” Agatha snapped when she’d scanned the space and observed that nobody was there.<br/>
</p><p>The woman kept her mouth shut until:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>BANG!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha ducked, her hands instinctively going to cover her head, releasing the grasp on the woman. The woman didn’t hesitate to run away from her. More gunshots sounded, and as Agatha ran for cover behind a car, dropped the bat, freed one of her knives and threw it at the woman. It hit her in the back of the leg, and she tumbled to the ground.<br/>
</p><p>She retrieved her gun from her holster and started firing back at her enemies, who had also hidden behind the cars littered about the place. Agatha panted against the car, gun up and ready as she waited for the next round of fire.<br/>
</p><p>When it came moments later, she peeked her head up from the hood of the car, aimed her gun and:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>BANG!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Bullet in the head. Dead.<br/>
</p><p>“You fucking idiots!” Agatha heard a voice say. “You’re not supposed to shoot her; I need her alive!”<br/>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows…<em>why the-<br/>
</em></p><p>Her thoughts got cut off when she felt hands on her; they yanked her up by the collar of her ruined white shirt. Her feet dangled in the air as she looked down at the beefy man holding her up. She went to pull on her gun when the man shook her so violently that the gun was wrenched from her hand, sliding across the not-so-aeroplane bunker.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, for fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“So, what now?” Agatha hummed. “You’re orders say you can’t kill me.”<br/>
</p><p>The sound of bodies dropping a bit away caught the man’s attention, and Agatha didn’t hesitate to kick him in the balls. The man shrieked and Agatha cackled as he doubled over, putting her down, although he didn’t let go. She shoved at him as hard as she could, and the man staggered back, releasing her completely.<br/>
</p><p>She slid across the floor towards her bat, considering it was closer than her gun, retrieved it, spun around with it raised to hit the man that was most likely coming back for round two, when her bat met resistance.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes snapped up to find an axe warding off the blow to the person's head.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked down and was met with deep brown.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Hers.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha took her in. She, too, was covered in a healthy amount of blood. It was splattered all over her face and on a lot more of her arms, considering her wife had on a short sleeve. She looked exhausted but buzzing with adrenaline just as Agatha was.<br/>
</p><p>A slow smile spread across Rio’s lips as Agatha finally released the pressure she’d been pushing down on her wife with her bat. Rio lowered her axe, and Agatha felt her own grin sliding across her lips.<br/>
</p><p>Watch out world…Agatha Harkness has her wife back.</p>

<em>She’s here.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Daniel yanked Rio’s arms up and started unlocking her cuffs. Now this was an opportunity to escape, not escape, escape, but help Isabella and Noa. If <em>she<em> was who Rio thought she was, the Serpentines were going to be occupied for a while.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio could help Isabella and Noa and potentially catch a glimpse of her wife before they carted her off or killed her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio would be content if the last thing she ever saw in this life was Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Daniel had the next set of cuffs ready to place on her wrists as he uncuffed her from the ones on the wall. This was the first time he’d ever done this whilst Rio had been conscious. And although she was still drowsy from the sedatives, she was still a highly trained FBI agent. So, naturally…<br/>
</p><p>Once both her hands were free, she grabbed at Daniel’s neck and head butted him in the head with every muscle in her body. His head snapped back, and he crashed to the ground. Daniel was out cold. If Rio had the time, she would’ve killed him then and there.<br/>
</p><p>She fished around in his pockets for the keys for Isabella’s cuffs, there she also found a pocket knife. She scurried over to her and unlocked them.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio?” Isabella asked when she was free. “Do you know what you’re doing?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nope,” Rio replied before she pulled Isabella to her feet. “Just stay with me, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Isabella nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“What is taking-” Marina cut herself off when she opened the door to see Rio and Isabella standing on their feet, staring at her. “Mierda.” <em>Shit.<br/>
</em></p><p>Marina reached into her back pocket, and before she had the chance to pull whatever she had out, Rio went for her. She knocked her off her feet, tackling her to the ground. As Marina kicked out and scratched, Rio continued to straddle her as she searched for the weapon Marina had intended to use on her.<br/>
</p><p>When she freed it, it revealed itself to be a taser. Why the fuck couldn’t she have a gun? Whatever. Rio pulled out her pocket knife ready to slit Marina’s throat when a piercing scream cut through Marina’s struggles.<br/>
</p><p>Rio snapped her head up to see Noa, her arm dripping with blood. She was crying as a man was carrying her down the hallway. She locked eyes with Rio and:<br/>
</p><p>“Rio! Please!”<br/>
</p><p>She sounded like Nicky on that voice manipulation record Marina has shown her. Rio’s heart shattered.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t think before she jammed the knife in Marina’s neck before springing up and shooting down the corridor towards Noa.<br/>
</p><p>“Isabella! Come on!” Rio urged.<br/>
</p><p>The previous Miss America fell in line behind her as they sprinted towards Noa. She and the man carrying her disappeared behind the door at the end of the hallway. Rio ripped it open to see Noa and the man crossing through an empty room covered in patches of dried blood before slipping behind another door.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had never seen the place where she’d been held captive, only her cell and the room where she would share government secrets. Rio was starting to believe that this place was much larger than she had previously thought.<br/>
</p><p>“Here,” she gave Isabella the taser. “Do you know how to use that?”<br/>
</p><p>Isabella nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay good. Hopefully you won’t have to, but you can use it to protect yourself,” Rio told her as they crossed the room.<br/>
</p><p>She went to pull on the next door when…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Axe?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>In the corner of the room was a bloody axe. It had clearly been used for some form of torture or execution. Maybe they were even planning on using it on her. Well, jokes on them. Now it was Rio’s.<br/>
</p><p>She grinned as she darted across the room to grab it.<br/>
</p><p>Isabella raised an eyebrow as she opened the door to let Rio through. Rio could only muster a shrug.<br/>
</p><p>Now they were in another long corridor, and Noa was down the other end. The man carrying her had picked up his pace. He yelled at her to stop screaming, and there was a trail of Noa’s blood going down the length of the hallway.<br/>
</p><p>That man was going to die.<br/>
</p><p>“You might not want to see this,” Rio warned Isabella. “So, stay back.”<br/>
</p><p>She sprinted towards Noa and the man, axe in hand. With no doors for them to escape through, Rio caught up to them easily.<br/>
</p><p>Usually, she’d go for the most devastating play first. Maybe hack off a limb or a head. But he was holding Noa, and she didn’t want him to drop her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio crashed to the ground, knees sliding until she could swipe at the man’s leg. A large cut appeared in his trousers as he grunted, leg buckling. Rio slid past him before getting to her feet and grabbing Noa before he could drop her.<br/>
</p><p>She gave her to Isabella and said:<br/>
</p><p>“Turn her away and cover her ears.”<br/>
</p><p>As soon as Isabella did, Rio didn’t hesitate before she buried the axe in the man’s back. Blood sprayed, coating her body in it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio didn’t mind blood, but she was currently trying to protect a child. She definitely should not be covered in human blood whilst doing so.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She tried to wipe it off before Noa noticed.<br/>
</p><p>Too late.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing?” Noa asked her.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio looked up, blue eyes were glued to her.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve seen blood before. I’ve actually seen worse. You don’t need to hide that from me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stooped so that she was looking up at her. “Yes, but you were never <em>supposed<em> to see those things. I don’t want you to see anymore of it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Noa shrugged. “It’s too late for that.”<br/>
</p><p>She was five, and yet she was talking like someone ten years older.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re killing the people who hurt us, Rio. They’re bad people, and I know you’re a secret spy or something. That’s what they said. So, do it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. She still wasn’t going to kill anyone with Noa watching, but it was the fight in her. It, like a lot of things about Noa, reminded her of her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“How’s your arm?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“It <em>hurts<em>,” Noa replied.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio bit her lip. The cut was nasty and hadn’t stopped dripping.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay. We’re gonna do this,” Rio told her as she got out her knife. She cut off the bottom of her top to act as a makeshift bandage and wrapped it around Noa’s arm.<br/>
</p><p>“When you get out of here, Isa will find you a better one.”<br/>
</p><p>“When <em>we<em>,” Noa corrected.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio nodded with a weak smile, although she knew she wasn’t going anywhere. Not with Nicky under threat.<br/>
</p><p>Was Rio hearing things, or was that a gunshot? Was that two gunshots?<br/>
</p><p>Clearly, she wasn’t, as Isabella and Noa looked around as if trying to find the source. Who would be-<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Oh, yes. Her wife was here. Rio had almost forgotten in all the commotion.<br/>
</p><p>Footsteps, a lot of them, had sounded in the next corridor over. They all seemed to be going in the direction of said gunshots, towards Agatha. And Rio being Rio, simply couldn’t let that happen.<br/>
</p><p>“Stay here,” Rio told them before she ran down to the other end of the corridor.<br/>
</p><p>She stepped out into the next hallway and all of the five men running towards her stopped. Their expressions were perplexed and sceptical and Rio wished she could read their minds. ‘How the hell has she gotten out?’ Was probably on their minds.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re not supposed to kill her yet,” one of the men told his friends.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, what are we supposed to do? She’s out?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. She didn’t have time for this.<br/>
</p><p>She ran towards the first man and swung. His head dropped to the ground. This time, the blood had splattered mostly on her face. The man had been a decent head taller than her (ha, get it?). The man just behind him gasped in horror as the man next to him brought a quivering hand holding a gun up. Before he could even think to shoot, Rio cut his hand off.<br/>
</p><p>He screamed in agony before Rio buried her axe in his heart. More blood splattered her body. She went to free it before the next man along the line tackled her, slamming her against the wall. He had a syringe in his hand and was trying desperately to jam it into her arm.<br/>
</p><p>He’d only been able to tackle her because of the element of surprise. Now, him trying to beat her in what was essentially an arm wrestle was just sad. She had no problem snapping his wrist before taking the syringe and shoving it into his arm instead.<br/>
</p><p>She watched as his eyes began to get heavy.<br/>
</p><p>“Night, night,” she told him as his body slumped to the ground.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t get the chance to breathe before another fist was flying in her direction. She dodged it easily, making the fist slam into the wall beside her head. The man yelped before she kneed him in the balls, freed her knife and stabbed him in the neck. A steady fountain of blood sprayed from it and onto her arm that was holding the knife in place.<br/>
</p><p>She yanked it free and let the man’s body drop to the floor. Now with no more men flying at her, she could get her axe back. Rio counted the bodies as she stepped over them.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>One, two, three, four…missing one.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The man with one hand was trying to escape.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t fucking think so.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio ripped her axe from where it was buried in the man’s heart before throwing it hard and fast at the man running down the corridor. The axe spun multiple times before it hit home in the man’s back.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, satisfied with her work.<br/>
</p><p>Once she’d gotten her axe back, she told Isabella and Noa to come out, and they headed down the other end of the corridor so they wouldn’t see the mess Rio had made.<br/>
</p><p>There was no hiding the blood from Noa now, but it appeared the little girl genuinely didn’t care. She took Rio’s axeless hand and held it, blood and all.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>This place really was a maze. Rio was unsure how many corridors they’d been down, but they never seemed to stop. They’d come across more herds of men, and just like last time, Rio would tell Isabella and Noa to stay in the corridor over, and she’d <em>handle it.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio was certain she could fill multiple buckets with the amount of blood on her skin and clothes. She was starting to get worried that the sight might worry Noa, but it never did. Every time they would reunite, Noa would take her hand as if it were nothing.<br/>
</p><p>Which, Rio figured, to her, it probably was.<br/>
</p><p>She hated that the little girl had, had to grow up in an environment like this. And to make things worse, her parents were dead, and she didn’t even know.<br/>
</p><p>When they came up to a door that actually looked like there was something promising behind it, Rio’s arms were dead. She’d lost count of how many people she’d killed.<br/>
</p><p>Isabella pulled the large door open, and it revealed a massive space filled with nothing but the odd car.<br/>
</p><p>Rio ushered the girls forward so that they were concealed behind a black <em>Range Rover.<br/>
</em></p><p>And then Rio saw her.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife.<br/>
</p><p>She was holding a woman by her hair and shoving her into the centre of the place. Agatha wouldn’t have been able to see her from where she was hidden to the left of her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was covered in blood, which didn’t surprise Rio. She expected nothing less.<br/>
</p><p>“Is that…is that your wife?” Isabella asked.<br/>
</p><p>A smile spread across Rio’s lips. “Yep.”<br/>
</p><p>She could feel Isabella's gaze over her before returning it to Agatha. “I can see why you two are married now.”<br/>
</p><p>“She’s so cool!” Noa whisper yelled.<br/>
</p><p>“Isn’t she?” Rio replied as if she were some fangirl talking about their favourite celebrity.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>BANG!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>A gunshot sounded and then another. Rio sheltered Noa with her body as she tried to find where the gun was firing from. She was unsuccessful.<br/>
</p><p>There was a pause in fire before it started up again. This round shorter as her wife had found the target and killed them. Rio hadn’t seen a thing, but she knew.<br/>
</p><p>“You fucking idiots!” Marina. How was she still speaking or even alive? Rio stabbed her in the fucking throat. “You’re not supposed to shoot her; I need her alive!”<br/>
</p><p>And there it was again. The confirmation that they didn’t want her wife dead. Good. But why? They had no problem threatening a five-year-old boy, but drew the line at a thirty-three-year-old?<br/>
</p><p>Rio poked her head out so she could see over the hood of the car and didn’t think before she grabbed her axe and bolted towards the horrific scene. A beefy man was holding Agatha up by the collar of her beautifully bloodied white shirt.<br/>
</p><p>Men came at her from wherever they were hiding almost immediately. There were no thoughts behind Rio’s actions like she were working on autopilot. Just swing, swing kill. It reminded her of the wooden plank vs those protestors in Central Park when Agatha’s mother had trapped her.<br/>
</p><p>It was like her mind was hardwired to protect Agatha without a thought, like it was animal instinct. That science couldn’t explain it. It was something Rio just <em>did.<br/>
</em></p><p>The men were dead, Rio was running forward, and Agatha had freed herself. The beefy man was hunched over on the floor a bit away, and her wife was sliding on the floor to retrieve something. She spun around, a bat raised and ready to crack Rio’s skull with.<br/>
</p><p>She brought her axe up to prevent that from happening.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched her wife’s eyes snap up to the axe above her head before they locked onto her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s pupils dilated immediately, and Rio’s heart grew five sizes.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife was still pressing down on her axe, and if Rio wasn’t pushing back, that bat would’ve killed her.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t care, a slow smile creeping onto her lips. Agatha was so fucking beautiful. Her face was covered in blood, and yet the full face of makeup she was wearing hadn’t smudged an inch. Rio made a mental note to ask her wife what setting spray she’d used.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s lips were also painted in her signature red.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife was the hottest woman on the planet.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s smile mirrored hers, and Rio would’ve gotten lost in it if there hadn’t been a man gunning for her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“Duck,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to be told twice. She ducked, and Rio cut the approaching man’s head off.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife sprang back up. “The axe is hot, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>And as if that was the first thing Agatha said to her after everything that had happened between them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t help it. She laughed. “Thank you. I like the bat.”<br/>
</p><p>“Than-”<br/>
</p><p>Her wife cut herself off when she pushed Rio down just before a knife connected with her body. The knife landed on the floor with a clatter before Agatha whacked someone in the head with her bat.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you. I feel like Harley Quinn.”<br/>
</p><p>“Who –” Rio threw her pocket knife into the eye of the man coming up behind Agatha. “ – Who the fuck is Harley Quinn?”<br/>
</p><p>“Are you fucking with me?” Agatha said as she nodded in the direction she wanted to head in. Rio followed her lead. “I know you didn’t watch films until you met me, but come on. You don’t know Harley Quinn?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nope,” Rio replied as Agatha bent down to retrieve her gun and then the one just ahead of it.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re watching it when we get home, then.” She handed the gun to Rio. “Now, as much as I’ve loved getting my hands dirty, let’s finish this with guns,” Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio returned it.<br/>
</p><p>“There will be no need for that,” a voice said.<br/>
</p><p>There was absolutely no fucking way.<br/>
</p><p>Wrinkled ankles revealed themselves as they got out of the car furthest away. Rio locked eyes with ice blue.<br/>
</p><p>Because who else would it fucking be than Evanora Harkness.</p>

<p>“This,” Agatha waved her arms around, gun in hand, as she indicated to the space. “Was <em>you<em>?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Evanora smiled. “It hasn’t gone according to plan, but I think it might work out better now, actually.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why?!” Agatha shouted.<br/>
</p><p>“Because you. Don’t. Listen. I told you you’re attraction to women would only cause you pain. Look at your leg. Oozing with blood from a cut that <em>she<em>,” Evanora pointed at Rio. “Gave you.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
Rio’s stomach dropped when she remembered what she had done. She’d forgotten. How had she forgotten?<br/>
</p><p>She dropped to her knees immediately, putting her gun down so she could place both hands on Agatha’s leg to turn it towards her. Rio gasped in horror when she laid eyes on the large patch of blood that was spreading across Agatha’s jeans from the place she’d stabbed her. Yes, her wife was covered in blood, but that patch, that was so evidently her own.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” Rio mumbled, tears pricking her eyes. <em>I love you<em>. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have…it’s my fault-”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha knelt so they were level. “Rio,” she said sternly, cutting her off. “It’s okay. I’m not angry with you, sweetheart.”<br/>
</p><p>“But why?!” Rio shot back. “I stabbed you! I fucking stabbed you. You should hate me, I hate me!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha dropped her own gun and brought her hands up to cradle Rio’s face, shaking her head. “I don’t hate you, baby. I know you didn’t want to.”<br/>
</p><p>“How? I never said-”<br/>
</p><p>“I knew,” Agatha said, nodding to emphasise her point. “You did it to protect Nicky.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows, her tears still falling. “How did you-?”<br/>
</p><p>She cut herself off. Of course, her wife would’ve figured it out. She was the smartest woman she knew.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha offered her a small smile as she brushed away her tears with her thumb.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s expression turned startled, her mouth opening before Rio felt herself being yanked from her wife’s grip.<br/>
</p><p>She was forced to stand, her hands locked behind her back as she felt cool metal pressed against her temple.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened when she saw Agatha in the same predicament. She lunged to help her when a harsh voice said:<br/>
</p><p>“Take another step and we’ll blow her brains out.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stilled all movement.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora clapped with a relieved sigh. “Now that I have both of your attention again, let me explain,” she grinned. “Conversion therapy didn’t work. Your lifetime of abuse didn’t work. I took Wanda from you, and it <em>didn't work<em>. You’re still stupid, Agatha. Still evil, an active servant of the devil.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Evanora laughed bitterly. “And then I find out about <em>her<em>. You’re new little wife, courtesy of the FBI. I didn’t think she’d grow to care for you, but when Wanda called me crying one night, saying that you might have actually moved on, I knew it was real.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“So, you did this for Wanda?” Agatha spat, still twitching regardless of the gun pressed against her head.<br/>
</p><p>“Heavens no. I did this for <em>you<em>. No daughter of mine shall service the devil. I will not stand for it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“You don’t-”<br/>
</p><p>“Shut up!” Evanora shrieked. “Before I kill her right now!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fell silent.<br/>
</p><p>“I dug into your sluts past and found out her father used to lead this gang,” she gestured to the men holding the wives at gun point. “And that they were on the hunt for a certain missing heir or two, so I nudged them in the right direction.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “Or two?”<br/>
</p><p>“Isabella,” Agatha told her before her mother had a chance to reply. “She’s your half-sister, your father told me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t know which piece of information she should process first. The fact that she and Isabella were related or the fact that her father, a man she hadn’t seen in almost a decade, had been in contact with her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“You went after my sister too?!” Rio yelled. “One I didn’t even know I had! What the fuck is wrong with you? Isabella had nothing to do with this!”<br/>
</p><p>Evanora smiled. “That is what you get for being involved with my daughter. You suffer. She’s like a plague that only sickens you, makes you weak.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio heard Agatha whimper.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t listen to her, Agatha,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“I know you were warned,” Evanora continued. “Your father almost ruined my plan because of it. You had an escape, and yet you <em>still stayed<em>. Your demise is on you, dear.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha whispered.<br/>
</p><p>“For what, baby?” She resisted the urge to try to walk towards her. “It was me who asked you to stay, and I wouldn’t change that for the world.”<br/>
</p><p>“But I almost got you killed!” Agatha’s voice broke.<br/>
</p><p>“No, no,” Evanora interrupted. “You <em>have<em> killed her. We’re mere moments away, I just need you both to understand.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>A tear fell from Agatha’s eye, and all Rio wanted to do was go to her and stop them.<br/>
</p><p>“It worked out well, my masterful plan that is,” Evanora went on. “They didn’t want to kill you at first, and then I told them that they could use you to retain government secrets. Criminals love to get their grubby little hands on those. I said, ‘I’ll tell you where the girl is, you get all those secrets, and in return you kill her for me.’”<br/>
</p><p>“They were very quick to do as I said when I put it that way. I even threw in your sister as a bonus so that they would in fact, get an heir,” Evanora laughed in delight.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re sick,” Rio spat.<br/>
</p><p>“No!” Evanora countered. “The pair of you are! For participating in your homoeroticism.”<br/>
</p><p>Evanora paused, drawing closer to the wives as her eyes darted between them.<br/>
</p><p>“You thought you were so close to having her back in your arms just then, didn’t you, deary?” Evanora was by Agatha now, her hand brushing tenderly over her bloody face.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha spat at her mother, and Evanora swiftly smacked her across the face.<br/>
</p><p>“No!” Rio screamed as she surged forward until the two men holding her held her still, the gun on her temple pressing harshly into her skin. “Don’t fucking touch her!” Rio continued anyway.<br/>
</p><p>She would die protecting her wife.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora ignored her, gripping Agatha by her chin and digging her nails into her skin.<br/>
</p><p>“And if you did happen to escape,” Evanora said roughly against Agatha’s face. “They would’ve hunted her down, again and again, until she was dead. There is no escaping them or me.”<br/>
</p><p>She yanked Agatha forward. “I will <em>always<em> take away your toys, do you hear me?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha only glared at her, more red from the bruise blossoming on her face, joining the blood there.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora released her, and Rio bit her lip at the very visible nail marks left on her wife’s face.<br/>
</p><p>“Ah,” Evanora sighed, rolling her head back. “Now on to the grand finale,” she grinned when she had taken up her previous position in between them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio heard a shuffling next to her until Isabell and Noa appeared, both of them held at gunpoint.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you serious?! You’re going to kill an innocent little girl and a woman who has nothing to do with any of this?” Rio yelled.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Evanora replied calmly. “Agatha will…if she doesn’t kill you.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.<br/>
</p><p>“Kill your slut Agatha or we’ll kill these two and her,” her mother continued.<br/>
</p><p>A knife was shoved into her hand as she was dragged towards Rio. The cold metal of the gun aimed at her pressed against her skin, reminding her it was still there.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you see what I mean when I said it actually worked out better for me?” Her mother laughed. “Now you get to kill her, daughter.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt the tears running down her face as she stared into Rio’s beautiful brown eyes. Her wife was nodding, as if she’d accepted her fate. How could Rio accept this? She should know Agatha wasn’t going to do it.<br/>
</p><p>“Do it, mi amor,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head, tears streaming down her face. “No. No, I can’t.”<br/>
</p><p>“You must,” Rio told her with a reassuring smile. “They’re going to kill me anyway. If you do it, you’ll be saving two lives.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s lip trembled as she continued to shake her head. “I can’t kill you,” she whispered. “My body physically won’t allow me to.”<br/>
</p><p>“Come here,” Rio told her as if two men weren’t holding the two of them.<br/>
</p><p>One of the men looked at her mother for the green light, and she gave it.<br/>
</p><p>They pushed the wives closer together, but Rio didn’t stop until the knife was pointed directly at her heart. The blade pressing into her shirt.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s like you said, ‘It’s yours anyway.’ My heart is yours forever and then some. If anyone had to take me out of this world, I would want it to be you because I know you’re doing it with care in your heart,” Rio nodded, stepping closer so the knife pushed deeper.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tried to pull back, but the men holding her wouldn’t allow her to.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, <em>please<em>. Stop it.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio soothed. “Everything will be okay.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s hand holding the knife trembled.<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t let them die, Aggs,” she nodded to the little girl and her sister. Their sobs audible. “Not when they are innocent.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha made the stupid mistake of looking at the little girl and realised she knew her. She was Nicky’s friend, Valentina. How had she ended up in this mess? Valentina’s big blue eyes were rimmed with tears.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was right, and she hated it.<br/>
</p><p>But could Agatha kill her own wife? She didn’t think so.<br/>
</p><p>It appeared Rio was doing the job for her anyway. She stepped even closer, and Agatha felt the knife sinking lightly into skin. She choked out a sob.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s only fair, right, baby? I’ve stabbed you already after all,” Rio quipped.<br/>
</p><p>“This is <em>not<em> the same thing,” Agatha replied, the first trickle of blood running down Rio’s shirt joining the blood already there.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Her wife offered her a small smile.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio. Rio, please stop,” Agatha pleaded, her eyes so blurry she could hardly see.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s okay, baby. I love-”<br/>
</p><p>Everyone’s attention snapped to the two girls being held at gunpoint…although they weren’t anymore. Isabella had appeared to have tasered both of their captors, and they were convulsing on the floor.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha did not miss this opportunity (everyone distracted) to strike.<br/>
</p><p>She stabbed the man behind her with her knife. He fell backwards, and she snatched the gun out of his hand, shooting and killing both men before they could even process what was happening.<br/>
</p><p>Rio seemed to have freed herself too, the distraction throwing her captors off guard as well. She’d sent the gun flying from the man’s hand before she ducked, reading Agatha’s mind as she shot the two men in the head.<br/>
</p><p>Rio snatched up her axe, charging towards the men convulsing on the floor. She ordered Isabella to cover Valentina’s head before her wife chopped the men’s heads off.<br/>
</p><p>Once everyone was dead, the two wives spun on Evanora.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother tried to run away, but Rio caught her with ease, dragging her towards Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Evanora was alone now. Nobody else had jumped to her rescue, and Agatha figured they’d all fled once her presence was known and her mother had appeared. Even Marina Blue hadn’t made an appearance.<br/>
</p><p>It was every man for themselves at the end of the day.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha held her gun up, aiming it at her mother’s head.<br/>
</p><p>“You think killing me is going to stop them from hunting her now? They have all the resources to find her, and they won’t stop. She’s dead, Agatha. You killed her. It’s only a matter of time,” Evanora got out desperately. “I win, no matter which way you spin it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ignored her. “You wanna do the honours, baby?”<br/>
</p><p>“Nah. You can be the one to send her to hell,” Rio replied. “You suffered from a lifetime of abuse after all.”<br/>
</p><p>And it was all Agatha needed.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled the trigger, watched her mother’s body tumble backwards from the gunshot in her head.<br/>
</p><p>Dead.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shoved her gun in her back pocket before surging forward and pulling Rio into a tight hug. Rio dropped her axe and circled her arms around her. She felt her wife’s tears on her shoulder, wetting her shirt.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you ever do that again!” Agatha yelled, shoving Rio away from her. “We would’ve figured something out. We always figure something out, Rio! You don’t just walk into a knife. You don’t just sacrifice yourself for the people who love you without consulting them first!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know if she was making any sense. All she knew was that she was pissed off that Rio was going to let herself die so easily.<br/>
</p><p>That she was going to leave her in this world without her.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife said something, but Agatha hadn’t caught it as she continued her ramble.<br/>
</p><p>“And I know you felt like you didn’t have a choice, but we-”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha stopped speaking, taking in the pained look on her wife’s face.<br/>
</p><p>“You…you love me?” Rio asked quietly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked, thrown by the question. “Well, I…” she trailed off before she furrowed her eyebrows in frustration. “Well, wasn’t it pretty fucking obvious?!”<br/>
</p><p>“After…still?” More tears streamed down Rio’s face.<br/>
</p><p>It was clear Rio still didn’t believe that Agatha had forgiven her.<br/>
</p><p>“I never stopped.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio let out a choked laugh before she walked forward, her hands grabbing at Agatha’s waist to draw her in. Her wife pressed a searing kiss to her lips. Agatha could feel the metallic taste of blood in her mouth, but she didn’t care.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t care about anything as long as Rio’s lips were on hers.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio pulled away to Agatha’s dismay, she whispered against her lips:<br/>
</p><p>“I love you, Agatha Harkness-Vidal.”<br/>
</p><p>A fresh wave of tears pricked Agatha’s eyes.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Harkness-Vidal<em>. Because they were one in the same.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>“And I love you, Rio Harkness-Vidal.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled against her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio?” A small voice said.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife pulled away to greet Valentina, who was running to her. Rio stooped down so that she could run into her arms, and Rio squeezed her tightly.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you okay? You hurt?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>Valentina shook her head. “It’s just my arm.”<br/>
</p><p>“We’ll get that checked out, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>She nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Noa,” Rio started, turning to face Agatha. “This is my wife, Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Noa and not Valentina.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha kneeled so that she was level with Rio. She smiled. “Hi Noa, nice to meet you. Nicky’s told me a lot about you.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa blinked her big blue eyes, staring at her for a long moment until she said:<br/>
</p><p>“You kinda look like me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “I kinda do.”<br/>
</p><p>“Isa, you okay?” Rio asked as she stood up to hug her sister. “You really do know how to use a taser, huh?”<br/>
</p><p>Isabella smiled as she accepted Rio’s hug. “Evidently.” She pulled back. “Sisters then? Makes sense, you look gorgeous even though you're covered in blood,” Isabella teased.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked up at them. “I think it’s time we go home now then, yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s smile fell, and Agatha’s stomach twisted.<br/>
</p><p>“What is it?”<br/>
</p><p>“We can’t go home, Aggs. I’m a rat. I leaked government secrets, and Marina is gone. You heard your mother, they won’t stop chasing me until they find me and kill me. It’s the same for Isabella and you just killed a civilian, albeit your dementated mother, in cold blood.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. She hated to admit it, but Rio was right.<br/>
</p><p>They couldn’t possibly go home now.<br/>
</p><p>------------<br/>
</p><p>Tina was a part of the Serpiente gang, she was also an FBI agent. An agent who had been asked to go to the home of a certain missing princess to retain her. After Agent Rio Vidal had leaked government secrets to her gang, she was a wanted criminal.<br/>
</p><p>A <em>missing<em> wanted criminal.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She and her wife, Agent Agatha Harkness, last known location was the Serpiente’s headquarters. After a particular bloody blowout, the two women, along with Rio Vidal’s sister (the other missing heir), Agent’s Alice Wu-Gulliver, Jennifer Kale and Agent Agatha’s son had simply…<br/>
</p><p>…Vanished.<br/>
</p><p>The FBI had picked their best agents to go to the pair's house in hopes of finding them there.<br/>
</p><p>Tina waited for her head agent to bash the door in before her task force swarmed the place.<br/>
</p><p>When Tina stepped inside, the first thing she noticed was a ‘Happy Birthday’ banner in the hallway, written in gold a purple.<br/>
</p><p>Ah, yes.<br/>
</p><p>Tina remembered that the mysterious old woman who had planned the entire thing had asked for Rio Vidal to be kidnapped on Agatha Harkness’ birthday.<br/>
</p><p>Tina ventured further in, her gun up, darting about the place as she followed the tail of five other agents. She stepped into the living room and found more banners, purple, white and gold balloons littered the floor and on the table, a handful of untouched and unopened presents.<br/>
</p><p>Tina wondered if the FBI might let her take some.<br/>
</p><p>Once the living room was confirmed to be clear, she moved to the kitchen. It was a lovely kitchen, open plan with oak furbishing. Rio Vidal and Agatha Harkness had a magnificent house, it was a shame they would have to live in prison cells for the foreseeable future.<br/>
</p><p>Tina noticed a large paper bag that sat on the kitchen island next to two cups of coffee. She would recognise that branding anywhere.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Jo’s bagels.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Tina loved Jo’s bagels! She wondered how long the food had been sitting there. It was probably mouldy by now.<br/>
</p><p>What sounded like boots on glass caught her attention, and she looked to see that one of the other agents had trodden on a piece of shattered glass. She walked over to it and saw blood.<br/>
</p><p>She knew it was Vidal’s blood. Daniel hadn’t stopped boasting about how he’d caught her completely off guard the day he went to kidnap her.<br/>
</p><p>A foul smell wafted up Tina’s nose, and she snapped her head up to lay eyes on a gone-off tray of tres leches. She wrinkled her nose and made quick work of vacating the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>She was ordered to go upstairs with five of her task team to sweep the top floor.<br/>
</p><p>When the elevator opened, her team spread out. She went into the first bedroom and searched it, finding nothing to note other than the fact that this must have been Harkness’ son’s room. There were stuffed animals and <em>Spider-Man<em> posters stuck about the place.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Tina did feel bad about what her gang had threatened to do to the boy. He was only five, and this really had nothing to do with him. But like all people, he was a means to an end. She was sure they would’ve only killed him if it was necessary. It just so happened that the boy was the perfect leverage to keep Vidal in line.<br/>
</p><p>Tina moved on to the next room, which was fitted with white bedsheets and purple and green cushions. Clothes were on the floor, as if someone had been changing in a rush. She went into the bathroom, and when she was certain no one was in it, she turned to leave.<br/>
</p><p>That’s when Tina’s eyes snagged on a photo on the bedside table.<br/>
</p><p>It was Vidal and her ‘mad wife’ as her gang members had labelled her. They appeared to be on holiday, Italy, if Tina had to guess. They were snuggled into a couch on the back of a yacht, champagne glasses in hand. They weren’t looking at the camera. They were looking at each other.<br/>
</p><p>Tina thought they looked so in love. And they were.<br/>
</p><p>She was there when Harkness was crashing out at the FBI headquarters when they couldn’t find Vidal (Tina had a hand in throwing them off the scent). She had heard what Vidal had done to her wife in order to protect her from Daniel when she was back with the Serpiente’s.<br/>
</p><p>Tina thought that type of love was only written in movies. Tina had been proven wrong.<br/>
</p><p>When she stepped out of this room, all the others, along with the rooftop garden, had been checked. They weren’t there.<br/>
</p><p>The task team circled back to the first floor, and everyone confirmed what Tina had figured.<br/>
</p><p>Rio Vidal and Agatha Harkness were gone.</p>

<p>Rio gaped at the mansion in front of her, Noa’s hand in hers, Nicky on Agatha’s hip next to them.<br/>
</p><p>“So, you just…you just bought it?” Rio got out.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied as if it were obvious.<br/>
</p><p>It had been three days since the blood bath at the Serpiente’s headquarters, three days since Agatha killed her mother, three days since they’d fled the US.<br/>
</p><p>It was all thanks to Lilia. She’d gotten them out of the country and was now working overtime to clear their names back home. But Agatha had told Rio she didn’t want to go back, even if their names got cleared.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted a fresh start.<br/>
</p><p>And Rio, being Rio, did anything her wife wanted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had brought up how Rio said she’d always wanted to move to Australia and that they should go…so there they were.<br/>
</p><p>Sydney, Australia, looking at their new house on the beach.<br/>
</p><p>“I wanna look!” Nicky squealed as he wiggled out of Agatha’s grasp. He grabbed Noa’s hand, tugging. “Val! I mean…I mean, Noa. Come on!”<br/>
</p><p>Noa nodded, letting go of Rio’s hand with a giggle as they raced up the sand path to the house.<br/>
</p><p>The decision was as easy as deciding you needed to breathe, that they would adopt Noa. After Rio had explained to her that her family were unfortunately dead, she had brought up adoption. Rio hadn’t even finished the sentence before Noa said yes.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled as she looked at the pair, wrapping her arm around Rio’s waist. Rio leaned into her, relaxing as Agatha pressed her firmer against her. Now more than ever, she appreciated the small things after the days she’d spent thinking her wife would never be able to hold her again.<br/>
</p><p>“This wasn’t very discreet of you, by the way,” Rio teased. “Technically, we’re still wanted criminals.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “And we’re still two of the best FBI agents to come out of the field in twenty-odd years. I think we’ll be fine.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled at her wife’s smile.<br/>
</p><p>“Mama, Mami,” Nicky yelled. “Can you open the door, please? We wanna choose our rooms!”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, coming,” Agatha called as she tugged Rio towards their new home.<br/>
</p><p>The sand path led up to a gate that Agatha pushed open. The sand turned into a grass lawn with a few trees dotted about. A glass fence split the grass from the grey tiled floor next to a pool. Up from that were pool chairs, up from that was their house.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha unlocked the glass sliding back door, and Nicky and Noa shot past into the house.<br/>
</p><p>“Careful!” Agatha called after them with a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>Rio still hadn’t stepped inside yet. None of it felt real. A couple of days ago, she was certain she would be dead by now…and now? She was going to be living in Australia with her beautiful wife and equally beautiful kids.<br/>
</p><p>How had she gotten so <em>lucky?<br/>
</em></p><p>Or maybe she wasn’t. Maybe she was still under some sedative, handcuffed to a wall.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha asked, stepping back out of the house.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her before she asked weakly, “Are you real?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha burst out laughing until she took in Rio’s expression and steeled herself.<br/>
</p><p>“How about I prove it to you?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed her, slowly, deeply.<br/>
</p><p>“How’s this? Do I feel real yet, baby?” Agatha mumbled against her lips before she pressed them together again, this time sliding her tongue in.<br/>
</p><p>Rio hummed, revelling in her wife’s taste.<br/>
</p><p>“Ew!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled back with a smile on her face as Nicky had his arms folded. Noa was next to him with a grin on hers.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s not ew, Nick. They’re in loveee,” Noa sing-songed.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky scrunched his face as Agatha nudged her inside.<br/>
</p><p>“You wouldn’t be alive if it weren’t for us,” Agatha told him.<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows, “Mi amor-”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah!” Agatha cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>They explored the large house with its wooden flooring and open plan living room and kitchen, and its oak furbishing, identical to their old home in New York.<br/>
</p><p>“We have a conversation pit?!” Rio exclaimed as she set eyes on it.<br/>
</p><p>“Yup,” Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate before she dove in like she was jumping off a diving board. It didn’t take long for Nicky to copy her actions, landing on top of her with a giggle. Rio yelped as Nicky’s elbow dug into her rib.<br/>
</p><p>Before Rio had time to process the pain, more weight landed on top of her as Noa squealed, landing right on her stomach, winding her.<br/>
</p><p>The room filled with laughter as Nicky, Noa and Agatha cackled at Rio’s misfortune.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s always your own family,” Rio huffed. The laughter only got louder.<br/>
</p><p>“Mama’s turn,” Agatha announced.<br/>
</p><p>“Wait-”<br/>
</p><p>And before she knew it, Noa and Nicky were scrambling off her body to the other end of the pit. There was no warning, just Agatha falling off the edge and onto Rio. Another yelp left her mouth as Agatha dug her elbow into her rib in the exact same place Nicky had.<br/>
</p><p>Her family were trying to kill her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled off Rio, and she sat up, rubbing her rib.<br/>
</p><p>“Ow!” Rio yelled dramatically.<br/>
</p><p>They only laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Now we’re in the conversation pit,” Agatha started, fixing her clothes. “We need to have a conversation.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky groaned. “But Mama, we haven’t picked our rooms yet!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head in warning, and Nicky fell quiet.<br/>
</p><p>“Now, Nicky. Me, Mami and Noa are going to be staying in Australia. But Mommy has asked me to ask you if you would like to move back to New York once it’s okay for me and Mami to take you back. What do you think?”<br/>
</p><p>Wanda had sworn up and down that she didn’t know anything about Evanora’s plan. Neither of the wives wanted to believe her, but when she had been told what happened, her reaction was genuinely sincere. She’d broken down in tears and apologised to the pair of them.<br/>
</p><p>And as selfish as Rio wanted to be by keeping Nicky with them permanently in Australia, it was neither Agatha's nor hers call to make.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky’s face scrunched, and he stirred uncomfortably. “I want to stay here with you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio had to stifle the urge to sigh in relief.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Then it’s settled then.”<br/>
</p><p>“Now, Noa,” Rio started. “Are you sure you would like us to ad-”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Noa cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head playfully. Noa would never stop reminding her of her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“Then it’s sorted. You may now choose your rooms,” Agatha told them.<br/>
</p><p>They both squealed before they ran off upstairs.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Nicky and Noa had chosen the two rooms on the top floor, leaving the second floor to Rio and Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>It was stupid o’clock, but neither of them could sleep because of jet lag. They were snuggled into one another, the waves crashing onto the beach being the only sound.<br/>
</p><p>Rio would never get tired of this, of Agatha. She would never get tired of her wife’s smell, the sound of her heartbeat, the warmth of her body.<br/>
</p><p>It felt like a privilege that Rio had access to Agatha like this. That she could just touch her, hold her, speak to her whenever she wanted to. It was a privilege she thought she’d lost with the kidnapping, the stabbing.<br/>
</p><p>She flipped onto her stomach and settled in between Agatha’s legs as she was propped up against the headboard, and lifted her shorts to reveal her stitched-up thigh.<br/>
</p><p>No thoughts, Rio dipped down to kiss the length of the new stitching since Agatha had torn the old ones whilst fighting.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry,” a kiss. “I’m sorry,” another. “I love you,” two kisses. “I’m sorry.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio lifted her head, and Agatha had a small smile on her lips. “I told you; you have nothing to apologise for.”<br/>
</p><p>“But baby, I stabbed you.”<br/>
</p><p>“I was there,” Agatha chuckled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. “You should be making me grovel, bad. I should be sleeping downstairs right now.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’ve spent far too many days falling asleep without the sound of your heartbeat. I’m good.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay…then can you yell at me or something?”<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why-”<br/>
</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled a face. “You can’t just say that whenever you want me to drop a subject.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s smile never wavered. She leaned forward, “I love you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said sternly as her wife’s breath hit her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Say it back,” Agatha whispered as she kissed Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs,” Rio said as Agatha pulled away and turned her attention to Rio’s neck.<br/>
</p><p>“Say it back,” Agatha mumbled against her skin.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut as Agatha pressed hot kisses to her neck.<br/>
</p><p>“My love,” Agatha started tugging at her tank top until she pulled it over her head. “Say it back.”<br/>
</p><p>“I love you,” Rio said as she reached forward to pull at her wife’s top. “I love you so much.” She tossed it aside, dipping her head to press kisses along the edges of Agatha’s breasts.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, feeling herself getting choked up. She was never supposed to see Agatha again, and yet here she was dotting her wife’s beautiful body with tender kisses.<br/>
</p><p>She pulled back, taking in everything that was her wife. Her deep blue eyes, her nose, her lips, her head full of long, dark, thick waves.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. How had Agatha chosen her out of eight billion people to fall in love with?<br/>
</p><p>“It’s yours,” Rio found herself saying.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“My heart. I don’t want you to forget. Yours forever and then some, got it?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, pulling Rio in by the waist. “Got it. Just as mine is yours.” Agatha brought her hand up to brush Rio’s hair out of her face. “You are so perfect, baby.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s face pinched as she tried to fight off tears. “I hate you,” she said when a tear fell.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed as she wiped the tear away before pulling Rio in to plant a gentle kiss to her lips.<br/>
</p><p>Rio started tugging her shorts and underwear down, and Agatha did the same. They leaned backwards onto the mattress, heads next to each other as Agatha brought her hand up to stroke Rio’s cheek.<br/>
</p><p>She kissed her once more at the same time Rio started walking her fingers down Agatha’s stomach. She parted her legs expectantly, and Rio slid three fingers through damp curls and into her wife’s wetness.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha let out a small whine, her eyes locked on Rio’s as she did so.<br/>
</p><p>“You make the most beautiful sounds for me,” Rio whispered. “I never thought I’d be able to touch you again.”<br/>
</p><p>A rush of wetness coated Rio’s fingers, and she smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll only ever,” Agatha cut herself of with a moan when Rio’s fingers grazed her clit.<br/>
</p><p>“Keep going, sweetheart,” Rio urged.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked slowly between hers, her soft pants catching her off guard at moments.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll only ever make them for you,” Agatha got out.<br/>
</p><p>“I know my pretty girl,” Rio told her before stealing a kiss.<br/>
</p><p>She picked up her pace, and Agatha’s hand on her cheek moved to thread through her hair.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt like tearing up again. Her wife’s unforgettable scent was swirling around her, her wife’s hand was running through her hair, her wife’s blue eyes were locked onto her as she made the most beautiful sounds.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was so <em>lucky.<br/>
</em></p><p>“I love you.” It was all she could think of to say. There wasn’t a word in the world that could describe the way she was feeling.<br/>
</p><p>“I-” Agatha got cut off by her own gasps as Rio ran her fingers through wet folds, hitting her clit every time.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s body began to tighten as it built up to its release. She never took her eyes off Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes held her gaze as a high-pitched gasp left Agatha’s mouth. Rio felt her warm breath on her face as her wife found her release.<br/>
</p><p>Rio worked her through it, gently pumping to let her wife ride out her orgasm.<br/>
</p><p>“I…love you too, baby,” Agatha got out through shallow pants. “Now let me taste you.”<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t give Rio much warning after that, just detangled herself from her and slid down Rio’s body until her head was between her legs.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pressed tender kisses to Rio’s inner thighs. “I missed you so much,” Agatha mumbled into her skin.<br/>
</p><p>“Not nearly as much as me,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“I highly doubt that.”<br/>
</p><p>And before Rio could argue, her wife was running her tongue through her folds.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s back arched as Agatha continued to lap up her core.<br/>
</p><p>She stopped once to get out a, “I missed your taste,” before she continued.<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t take long after Agatha started circling Rio’s clit for her to come. And then again, and again, until Rio started whining that she wanted it to be her turn so she could taste Agatha. They’d started rolling around in the covers then, trying to stifle their giggles as they tried to pin each other down.<br/>
</p><p>Rio ended up coming out on top, didn’t think before she dove in between her wife’s legs to taste her. After she’d made Agatha come more times than either of them could count, they settled into each other’s arms.<br/>
</p><p>They were hot, damp and sticky. Neither of them cared, prepared to suffocate in each other’s heat as long as it meant not letting go.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pressed three kisses to Agatha’s forehead. One for her. One for Nicky. One for Noa.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>6 months later.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha was…fine (most definitely not fine).<br/>
</p><p>This was just some normal day (was not a normal day, but her wedding day).<br/>
</p><p>Sure, she and Rio technically <em>were<em> married. But they never did it properly. All that had happened was that they’d signed a piece of paper and put on simple wedding bands.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio was the one who suggested they should do them again, and since there names had been cleared four months ago, Nicky and Noa had settled into their new life in Australia and most of the Serpentine gang were behind bars or dead, Agatha figured…fuck it.<br/>
</p><p>The wives both decided they didn’t want a big wedding. Just their friends, family and of course, no Wanda’s.<br/>
</p><p>Since Lilia had retired from the FBI four months ago, she moved out to Australia alongside Alice and Jen. She’d gotten her marriage officiant license from some course online and informed Rio and Agatha of this fact the second they’d asked her.<br/>
</p><p>“I wanted to be prepared,” she had said.<br/>
</p><p>The ceremony was to be held on the beach outside their house.<br/>
</p><p>They weren’t doing bridesmaids or maids of honour. They wanted it to be simple, and although their love was anything but, it felt right.<br/>
</p><p>Jen was finishing Agatha’s hair when a six-year-old Noa burst through her bedroom doors.<br/>
</p><p>“Mama!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha whipped around. “Yes, baby? What is it?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mami…” she was panting from running, her forest green flower girl dress dishevelled because of it.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “What is it? Is she okay?”<br/>
</p><p>“Beach…go…” Noa got out.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t hesitate, picking up her lilac silk wedding dress and bolting out of the room.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha called when she’d made it out of their backyard.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snagged on the white chairs and the wedding arch made up of her wife’s favourite plants.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha called again. “Baby! Ba-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio was down the beach, her silk forest green corseted suit rolled up to her knees as she stood ankles deep in the water.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ran up to her. “What happened, baby? Noa said-”<br/>
</p><p>“I saw a shark!” Rio cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head back, blinking. “You…you saw a shark?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded her head. “Do you remember in Italy when I first told you I wanted to move here. I said it was because of the plants, tarantulas and sharks. And we’ve been living here six months and…”<br/>
</p><p>“We’ve never seen a shark,” Agatha finished her sentence.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded again. “Al was helping me get ready, and I saw it. I came straight here and thought you might want to see it too,” Rio shrugged. “It felt like a sign, so naturally, I googled it.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha burst out laughing, her annoyance for Rio making her think she was in trouble, vanishing. “Go on then. Tell me what it means.”<br/>
</p><p>“It means power and protection,” Rio said, wrapping her arm around Agatha’s waist.<br/>
</p><p>“Does it now?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm. So, we’re protected for life now. No more shitty parents, no more gangs, no more kidnappings.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha giggled as she rested her head on Rio’s shoulder.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s just you and me and our annoyingly perfect kids…and I guess Alice, Jen, Lilila-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s laugh cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>They settled into a comfortable silence, letting the waves crash against their feet, the warm breeze brush their skin, the fading sun warm their faces.<br/>
</p><p>“You kinda fucked us with the waiting to see each other at the alter thing.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged. “We’ve never done things the <em>traditional<em> way, though, have we?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha lifted her head to look at her wife. “Guess not.”<br/>
</p><p>“Like this, for example. You ever seen a couple attend their own wedding wet?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow. “Well…now that depends on what you mean-”<br/>
</p><p>She cut herself off with a yelp as Rio scooped her up in her arms and ran into the water.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t you fucking-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha got cut off once more when Rio dropped her into the ocean. When she stood, she and her wife were soaked.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going to fucking kill you!” Agatha shrieked as Rio tried to run away from her.<br/>
</p><p>She tackled her, slamming her body into hers and shoving Rio into the water. They rolled around in the depths, trying to see who could make it to the surface first. Agatha won.<br/>
</p><p>“I can’t believe you put me in here when you saw a shark!” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “You would’ve been fine, baby. I’d gladly let the shark eat me to save you.”<br/>
</p><p>“That is the only correct answer, yes,” Agatha said matter-of-factly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled, walking up to her. She tucked Agatha’s hair behind her ear before she pulled her forward, planting a tender kiss on her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” Jen yelled from the beach.<br/>
</p><p>Their guests had arrived and were sitting in their seats staring at them.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you two ready to get married now or what?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio slipped her hand in Agatha’s and tugged her out of the water.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Jen and Alice were sitting next to each other, Samuel and Isabella were on the other side of the aisle. Nicky and Noa were dropping purple and green flower petals down the aisle with Agatha just behind them. She was still soaking wet, her makeup smudged, and she smelt of the ocean.<br/>
</p><p>It was perfect.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was down the aisle next to Lilia. She looked just the same. Her wife smiled, the little gap between her teeth on show. Agatha thought there would never be a more beautiful image in the world.<br/>
</p><p>Once they’d made it to the end, Nicky and Noa went to sit on their aunt's laps (Nicky on Isabella’s, Noa on Jen’s).<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, well,” Lilia was tearing up already, and Agatha couldn’t help the tears that pricked her own eyes. “Let’s begin.”<br/>
</p><p>Maybe Lilia was doing a good job at officiating, Agatha would never know. She’d gotten lost in deep brown…well, almost dark brown. Rio’s pupils were blown wide, her love for Agatha so evident.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t believe it. She never thought she’d get this. She never thought she’d be loved like this, have a family like this, have a life like this.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother had always told her that she didn’t deserve it, but her mother was in hell. And Agatha, as of right now, was the furthest from it.<br/>
</p><p>Apparently, it was time to say vowels because Rio was opening her mouth:<br/>
</p><p>“I used to have a pretty tight grip on my life. I had control over my thoughts, my emotions. And then I met you.”<br/>
</p><p>She heard Jen cackling behind her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled, tears rimming her eyes. “You took my life and flipped it on its head. Every rule I ever lived by got shoved out the window and replaced with you. Detaching, compartmentalising, all foreign languages to me now. I only know love and how it drives me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio breathed in a shaky breath, squeezing her hands. “That’s all you.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha let out a wet laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“There is just you for me, Agatha,” Rio nodded to emphasise her point. “My heart is yours, mi amor.”<br/>
</p><p>And then Rio was kissing her knuckles.<br/>
</p><p>“If our children weren’t present, just know I’d be swearing at you for making me cry before I got to speak,” Agatha said, wiping at her tears.<br/>
</p><p>Their family laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha started, sucking in a breath. “I was terrified of you. You had this ability to make me feel so nervous…you still do.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smirked, and Agatha nudged her.<br/>
</p><p>“But I knew I was going to fall in love with you. There were times when I really didn’t want to. Times when I thought I would be able to ignore my ever-growing feelings for you. But that would be like asking the sun not to rise.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio squeezed her hands.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re inevitable, Rio. It’s yours anyway, always, my heart,” Agatha concluded.<br/>
</p><p>She heard the sniffles from their family and Lilia, but nothing would make Agatha pull her eyes away from Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Lilia cleared her throat. “I now pronounce you, Mrs and Mrs Harkness-Vidal.”</p>

<strong>6 months post-wedding.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Rio looked out at her kids splashing and squealing in the ocean by their house. Noa was trying to force her brother’s head underwater. Rio smiled when Noa was successful, kicking Nicky’s feet out from underneath him. He crashed into the water with a yelp.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t murder your brother, Nono!” Rio yelled from the beach.<br/>
</p><p>“But he’s making it so easy, Mami!” Noa called back.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“When are you getting in?”<br/>
</p><p>“When Mama gets out here. I don’t know what-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smacking her ass cut her off.<br/>
</p><p>“Here I am,” Agatha announced, pressing a kiss to Rio’s cheek. “Why haven’t you gotten in yet?” She asked, making her way to the water.<br/>
</p><p>“Er…” Rio started. “I was waiting for you?”<br/>
</p><p>“Why?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “Because you told me to wait for you?”<br/>
</p><p>“I did, didn’t I?” Agatha grinned before she dived into the waves.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, swimming to join her kids and wife.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky didn’t hesitate to climb onto her, his arms wrapping around her neck. Rio laughed until it was clear Nicky was trying to force her backwards.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t start with me, little man,” Rio warned teasingly.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky giggled until it was cut off when Noa and Agatha pushed them. Neither had a chance to catch their breath before Rio lost her footing, tumbling into the waves.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio resurfaced, Agatha and Noa were beside themselves.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t think Mama and Noa have drunk enough salt water,” Rio said to Nicky.<br/>
</p><p>“Me neither,” Nicky replied.<br/>
</p><p>They moved as one, chasing the pair down.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha scooped Noa into her arms as they made a break for it down the beach. The air was filled with giggles and the sounds of splashing water. Nicky didn’t hesitate when he leapt, latching on to Agatha who fell with Noa in her arms.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was laughing so hard she couldn’t breathe.<br/>
</p><p>She’d never been happier than she was right now, and she realised this was the entire point, life’s entire point.<br/>
</p><p>Love and being surrounded by it.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Two years later.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>“Are you sure we can’t watch something else?” Agatha groaned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio dumped a bunch of snacks into their conversation pit, and her kids scrambled over her to snatch at them.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio answered as she dropped down next to her. “We’re watching Spider-Man: Far From Home.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “This isn’t fair. I’m outnumbered.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mama, you like Spider-Man too,” Noa chimed in.<br/>
</p><p>“You just pretend you don’t,” Nicky added.<br/>
</p><p>Rio cackled.<br/>
</p><p>“I do <em>not<em> like Spider-Man,” Agatha protested.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“But you watch it with us every time?” Noa questioned, popping a peanut M&amp;M in her mouth.<br/>
</p><p>“Who took you shopping the other day?” Agatha said. “You’re supposed to be on my side.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa grinned. “Lo siento, Mama.”<br/>
</p><p>“And I would never miss out on family movie night, even if we’re watching the worst films known to man,” Agatha argued as Nicky snuggled up next to her.<br/>
</p><p>Her family gasped.<br/>
</p><p>“You take that back,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>Noa rolled her eyes. “Like Nicky said, Mama has to <em>pretend<em> she doesn't like the films to annoy us.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha’s hand flew to her heart. “Lies!”<br/>
</p><p>“Rage baiting your own family, baby?” Rio tutted. “That’s not nice,” she continued, waggling a finger.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s rage baiting, Mami?” Nicky asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Like when you annoy your sister after she’s been told off to make her angrier.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ohhh,” Nicky replied.<br/>
</p><p>Noa squeezed in between Nicky and Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you done complaining now? Can I press play?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Whatever.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled, leaning over their kids to kiss her cheek.<br/>
</p><p>“Ewwww,” Nicky moaned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled before pressing play, the latest Spider-Man movie gracing their television screen.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Four years later.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Rio still wasn’t used to normality. The idea that she and her wife’s daily routine included the school pick up and drop off was still strange to her. Four years ago, she was blowing up buildings and murdering criminals and now? Now she was making sure she left the house early to avoid traffic.<br/>
</p><p>They still did it, the crime fighting, but not nearly as often. Although Lilia had retired, she still had connections, and because their names had been cleared, the FBI were more than happy to have their best agents on whatever job they wanted to accept. If the mission aligned with their schedules, Agatha and Rio would readily take them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had yet to decide which was worse, dealing with criminals or dealing with rude parents at the pick-up and drop-off point. She parked her car, got out and made her way to the school where the rest of the parents were waiting.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s ears perked up at the sound of a laugh…one of her favourites.<br/>
</p><p>She scanned the cluster of parents until her eyes landed on her wife with a woman who had a hand on her arm.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Aggs?” Rio asked as she approached.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife turned, a smile on her face.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing here?”<br/>
</p><p>“Jen and I lost track of time, and she didn’t have time to take me home before the school run, so I said I’d come with.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah,” Rio acknowledged. “Where is she?”<br/>
</p><p>“Sky’s teacher needed to talk to her about something,” Agatha explained.<br/>
</p><p>Jen and Alice adopted their daughter, Sky, a year after moving to Australia. She was the same age as Nicky and Noa, and the three of them had become as thick as thieves. A win. Rio didn’t know if she could handle her kids not getting along with her best friends kid. A loss. The little shits caused far too much havoc for their own good.<br/>
</p><p>“Cassie was just asking me if I wanted to help out with the bake sale next week,” her wife continued.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, yes! The blonde who had a hand on her wife.<br/>
</p><p>“Cassie, is it?” Rio tried and failed to keep the agitation out of her voice.<br/>
</p><p>The blonde nodded. “Yes, nice to meet you. What was your name again?”<br/>
</p><p>And if Rio wasn’t pissed off enough.<br/>
</p><p>She glanced at her wife, who turned to hide her smirk. After all these years, Agatha was still the same, still doing everything she could to get the reaction she craved.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wasn’t rising to the bait.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio,” Rio replied, extending her arm.<br/>
</p><p>Cassie shook it firmly. “Would you also be interested in helping out with the bake sale? We could use all the hands we can get.”<br/>
</p><p>“I thought you said my hands were enough,” Agatha smirked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio missed the days she could walk around with a gun.<br/>
</p><p>Cassie dropped her head. “I think I said something else about your hands,” she said quietly.<br/>
</p><p>“And what exactly did you say about my wife’s hands?” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Cassie’s gaze flew to hers. “Your…your wife?” She stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, I didn’t tell you?” Agatha said nonchalantly. “Yeah, I’m married.”<br/>
</p><p>“You let me flirt with you even though…you’re married?” Cassie blinked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Cassie got out.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Rio nodded. “Should be. It’s not like her wedding ring is invisible, or do you need glasses?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted and Rio glared at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t touch my wife again, okay?” Rio ordered.<br/>
</p><p>Cassie shook her head. “I won’t.”<br/>
</p><p>“Wonderful!” Rio said, clapping her hands. “About that bake sale, I’ll help, Agatha won’t.”<br/>
</p><p>“What if I want to-”<br/>
</p><p>Dark brown eyes stared deep blue down. Her wife promptly shut up.<br/>
</p><p>The school bell rang.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…are you sure?” Cassie began.<br/>
</p><p>“Course! No need for this to be an issue. You’ve promised not to touch my wife; I no longer have to kill you, we’re good. I’d be more than happy to help.”<br/>
</p><p>“…Kill me?” Cassie questioned in alarm.<br/>
</p><p>“Mami!” Noa yelled, running through the school gates with the other kids on her tail.<br/>
</p><p>“Hola, mija. ¿Dónde está tu hermano?” <em>Where’s your brother?<br/>
</em></p><p>Noa shrugged. “No sé.” <em>I don’t know.<br/>
</em></p><p>Rio sighed. “Por supesto.” <em>Of course.<br/>
</em></p><p>Her daughter furrowed her eyebrows. “Mama, what are you doing here? It’s not your day.”<br/>
</p><p>“I know, thought I’d give Auntie Jen some company picking up Sky,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky materialised next to Noa.<br/>
</p><p>“Hola, Mami. Hi, Mama,” Nicky greeted.<br/>
</p><p>“Hola, mijo,” Rio answered. “Vamos.”<br/>
</p><p>Her kids and wife started following until Rio stopped, spinning on Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“No, you’re going with Jen.”<br/>
</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha asked through a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve pissed me off. You aren’t coming in the car with me,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Language, Mami,” Noa scolded as she took the car keys out of her hand.<br/>
</p><p>She and Nicky went to the car.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you serious?” Agatha laughed again.<br/>
</p><p>“Deadly. See you at home,” Rio said, kissing her on the cheek.<br/>
</p><p>“Puta,” Agatha replied teasingly.<br/>
</p><p>“Language! There are kids,” Rio grinned.<br/>

<em>
<strong>Lilia: I’ve been sent a mission that you might be interested in. Let me know if you want it:<br/>
</strong>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<strong>Location: London, England<br/>
</strong>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<strong>Mission: assassinate ex-Serpentine member Daniel Gomez.<br/>
</strong>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<strong>Agatha: Yeah, we want it. Can you look after the kids?<br/>
</strong>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<strong>Lilia: Of course.<br/>
</strong>
</em>
</p><p>Sweet, sweet fucking revenge.<br/>
</p><p>Daniel had been on the run for years, slipping easily through the FBI’s fingers. If Rio didn’t have a family to protect, she would’ve spent every waking moment hunting him down.<br/>
</p><p>He’d been travelling around Europe under an alias that the FBI finally caught wind of. They’d been monitoring his debit card activity and figured out he was on the way to Paris via the Eurostar. That’s how Agatha and Rio found themselves in St Pancras International station.<br/>
</p><p>“You see him?” Agatha asked, concealed behind a newspaper.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope,” Rio replied, taking a sip of her <em>Blank Street<em> latte.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Are you going to freak out if he sees you and calls you princess again?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t need to see her wife to know she was smirking.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio grumbled. “That word isn’t triggering anymore.”<br/>
</p><p>It was. She still fucking despised it.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know why you hate it.” Agatha folded her newspaper so that deep blue locked onto dark brown. “I’ve always said it makes perfect sense that you’re a princess. You’ve got the bratty attitude down to a T.”<br/>
</p><p>“In what world would I <em>ever<em> be a princess? And I only get that way because of you,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha chuckled, repositioning her newspaper. “And there it is.”<br/>
</p><p>“I-”<br/>
</p><p>“Your six o’clock,” Agatha interrupted.<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned her head an inch. Her fists clenched when she locked onto the light brown hair, green eyes and olive skin of her former captor. Four years later, and her blood still boiled at the sight of him.<br/>
</p><p>The memories flooded back: being chained to a wall alongside Isabella, Noa coming to feed her covered in bruises, the needles he’d jam into her skin, the way he kept her from her wife.<br/>
</p><p>No thoughts.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby?” Agatha whispered when Rio got up, following Daniel into the men’s restroom. “Be smart,” her wife urged.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, no. Fuck being smart. Rio had been waiting to kill Daniel since the day he kidnapped her.<br/>
</p><p>Before Daniel had the chance to zip down his pants at the urinal, Rio kicked him with everything she had.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck?!” Daniel grunted, eyes snapping to her.<br/>
</p><p>And that look on his face. The horror. The utter disbelief. Rio would remember that for as long as she lived.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio?”<br/>
</p><p>A slow smirk slid onto her face. “Happy to see me?”<br/>
</p><p>“Not the words I would use.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, come on,” Agatha taunted, falling in line next to her. “You haven’t missed your princesa?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio glared at her, and Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Daniel started backing away. “Water under the bridge, though, right? That was four years ago. I was only following orders.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio tilted her head, the action sharp, sinister. “You almost tore my family apart, and you think it’s water under the bridge?”<br/>
</p><p>“Y…yeah,” Daniel stuttered.<br/>
</p><p>His lip started quivering, and Rio beamed at the sight. “You’re so unbelievably pathetic. What? Can’t face me without a sedative on standby?”<br/>
</p><p>Daniel scoffed, holding her gaze for a beat before he pulled out a gun. Rio didn’t hesitate to kick it out of his hand. Her wife went for him, slamming him against the wall behind. Agatha stepped out of the way as Daniel stumbled backwards, dazed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio gave him a moment, his last, then walked easily behind him, arms wrapping around his neck effortlessly, trapping him in a headlock. The fight for his life began. Like a cat scratching at a toy, Daniel clawed at the arm suffocating him.<br/>
</p><p>Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“Shush,” she soothed. “It’ll be over soon.”<br/>
</p><p>“Puta,” Daniel spat.<br/>
</p><p>At that, her wife kicked him in the balls. The scream in response had Rio cackling.<br/>
</p><p>“Just think,” Rio continued as she squeezed the life out of him. “The last thing you ever did in this life is die at the hands of the woman you failed to kill.”<br/>
</p><p>Daniel spluttered.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re a failure,” Rio hummed, his eyes fluttering shut. “Remember that.”<br/>
</p><p>Daniel’s body went slack against her.<br/>
</p><p>Dead.<br/>
</p><p>After all these years, Daniel Gomez was finally fucking dead.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s grin mirrored hers. “Nice job, Mrs Smith.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why thank you, Mrs Smith.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hadn’t been in a principal’s office in <em>years<em>. It still gave her the same feeling, the need to snap back and poke fun at the authority figure in front of her. She found herself wanting to tell her kids' principal that he wouldn’t be able to hide his bald patch by combing his hair over it.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>Stop it.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Right.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She was an adult now, responsible for two human beings.<br/>
</p><p>She glanced at Noa beside her. Her daughter’s arms were folded, a scowl on her face. Agatha stifled a laugh. Noa really was her kid.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sure you know why you’re here, Mrs Harkness-Vidal,” Principal Dale began.<br/>
</p><p>Noa stuffed her bruised fist in her school blazer.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha replied. “I would also like to apologise for my wife’s absence, you know how work can get.”<br/>
</p><p>He most definitely didn’t. Rio and Alice were blowing up a building somewhere.<br/>
</p><p>Principal Dale nodded. “Fighting isn’t tolerated here, Noa. You know this.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa didn’t say anything, just sank further into her chair.<br/>
</p><p>The principal huffed. “And you still haven’t told us why you hit Kieran.”<br/>
</p><p>“I didn’t hit him, I punched him. At least have your facts right,” Noa grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha bit back a laugh before she said:<br/>
</p><p>“Noa, you aren’t helping yourself, sweetheart.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa didn’t look at her.<br/>
</p><p>“You have to cooperate with us so we can act appropriately,” Principal Dale said. “Why did you punch him? Your teacher said it had something to do with your brother.”<br/>
</p><p>At this, Agatha straightened. “What happened with Nicky, baby?”<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes identical to hers looked at her for the first time. “He made me promise, Mama.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jerked her head. Since when did their kids keep secrets from them?<br/>
</p><p>She swallowed the discomfort to say:<br/>
</p><p>“But if he’s in trouble-”<br/>
</p><p>“He’s not in trouble,” Noa interrupted.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, whatever he is, Mami and I can’t help if we don’t know.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve handled it,” Noa replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, you don’t need to handle things on your own anymore, remember?”<br/>
</p><p>She knew it wouldn’t just go away, Noa’s survival mode. Up until her adoption, her daughter never had a childhood. Even before the kidnapping when she lived with her birth parents in Mexico, Noa had to fend for herself. Her kid was only ten, and yet she thought and acted like someone double her age.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Rio were thrilled when Noa told them she was open to the idea of therapy. And as far as Agatha knew, Noa had no problem talking to them about the issues she was facing.<br/>
</p><p>It seemed Agatha had been wrong.<br/>
</p><p>“I know,” Noa spoke into her blue shirt collar.<br/>
</p><p>“So can you tell us what’s going on so we can help?” Agatha asked softly.<br/>
</p><p>Noa stirred, silence washing over the office until…<br/>
</p><p>“Kieran was picking on Nicky because he joined the choir. He kept saying it was only for girls.” She shrugged. “I overheard and punched him because <em>no one<em> can pick on my brother.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha fought to hide her smile. She was so unbelievably proud.<br/>
</p><p>“Noa, you know that’s not how we handle things,” Principal Dale patronised.<br/>
</p><p>Noa said nothing.<br/>
</p><p>“We will speak to Kieran, but unfortunately, I will have to suspend you for the rest of the week.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa shot up, “How’s that fair?!”<br/>
</p><p>“Noa,” Agatha warned. “We understand and accept the punishment, thank you, Principal Dale.”<br/>
</p><p>He nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“I will be checking that Kieran is properly dealt with, however. The fact that my daughter had to step in because my son was being bullied right under your noses and no one noticed doesn’t sit right with me. I’ll be making a complaint to-”<br/>
</p><p>“No!” Principal Dale cut in.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow.<br/>
</p><p>“There’s no need for that.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Quite the contrary. Like Noa said, no one can pick on my son, and the school has yet to-”<br/>
</p><p>“Dealt with immediately,” Principal Dale cut in. “We apologise for not dealing with the situation sooner.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Good. Come on, Noa.”<br/>
</p><p>They left the principal’s office and headed to the car park.<br/>
</p><p>“So I’m grounded then?” Noa mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>“Nope.”<br/>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows. “But you just said-”<br/>
</p><p>“I had to say that so we could get out of there.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa smiled, climbing into the car.<br/>
</p><p>“I have to ask though, and I’m not telling you off…why, baby?”<br/>
</p><p>Noa picked at the zip on her rucksack. “Nick has to be protected, Mama. He’s never had to deal with the things <em>we<em> have.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha hadn’t gone into detail about her shitty childhood, but her daughter had been there when her own mother tried to force her to kill Rio. She’d heard the vile things Evanora said to her. One day Noa asked, and Agatha told her in the nicest way she could.<br/>
</p><p>“He’s only ever known good, and I only want him to,” Noa continued.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was so proud of the girl she was raising.<br/>
</p><p>“I understand, Nono. And I’m proud of you for protecting him, but remember that’s what Mami and I are here for, okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Noa nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Good. Now,” Agatha began, starting up the engine. “Ice cream and shopping? Nicky can hang out with Sky for a little longer.”<br/>
</p><p>“Really?!” Noa exclaimed.<br/>
</p><p>“Yup. You deserve it, you’re injured.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa giggled. “Mama, were you a naughty kid?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at her in her mirror as she revered. “What makes you say that?”<br/>
</p><p>Noa shrugged. “You seemed uncomfortable in Principal Dale’s office.”<br/>
</p><p>“Did not!” Agatha protested, offence in her tone.<br/>
</p><p>“You <em>were<em> a naughty kid!” Noa laughed, pointing an accusatory finger.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Stop before I revoke your ice cream privileges.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa gasped. “No!”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Six years later.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>“Mami?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio should’ve expected it. Nicky always asked to go to the animal shelter whenever they drove past.<br/>
</p><p>“Bueno, entonces.” <em>Alright then.<br/>
</em></p><p>Because today she needed the pick-me-up. Agatha, Alice and Jen had gone back to the States for Jen’s father’s funeral, and she hadn’t seen her wife all week.<br/>
</p><p>“We have to be quick though because we need to pick Sky and Nono up from Grandma’s.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky nodded, and Rio turned back towards the animal shelter.<br/>
</p><p>Once parked and out of the car, they headed inside. She smiled at the staff who had grown familiar with them as Nicky pulled her towards his favourite section, the bunny rabbits.<br/>
</p><p>“He’s still here, Mami,” Nicky told her, pointing at the bunny that looked identical to Scratchy.<br/>
</p><p>Her son no longer slept with him, claiming that at twelve, he didn’t need stuffed animals. Nicky’s most prized possession now lived on the toy shelf above his bed.<br/>
</p><p>Big brown eyes looked up at her. “Are you sure we can’t get him?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip. She <em>hated<em> saying no to Nicky. “No, baby. Noa’s allergic, remember?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Nicky’s head dropped. “Oh, yeah. Olvidé.” <em>I forgot.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Lo siento, mijo.”<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine,” Nicky replied, stroking the bunny through the cage one last time before moving on to the dog kennels.<br/>
</p><p>The barks that always came when you entered greeted them. And the smile that flew onto Nicky’s face because of it followed. Rio grinned as her son named every dog on his way down the corridor.<br/>
</p><p>“And…huh? Mami!” Nicky shouted.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes?” Rio asked, approaching him.<br/>
</p><p>“Pancakes still here?” Nicky replied, his brows furrowed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s furrowed too because the golden retriever Nicky said goodbye to two weeks ago was staring back at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, we found out the people who adopted her had a history of animal abuse,” Joy, one of the workers, told them. “So she’s back here again.” She sighed. “I’m debating adopting her myself at this point. This has happened to her three times now.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew a thing or two about feeling unwanted. Her gaze returned to the dog with its golden brown fur, tongue out, looking up at Nicky as if he were the most precious thing in the world.<br/>
</p><p>Big brown eyes were on her again. “Mami…Noa’s not allergic to dog fur.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes…they’d always wanted a dog…<br/>
</p><p>“Your Mama’s gonna kill me for not asking her first, you know that?”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky giggled.<br/>
</p><p>“Looks like Pancake’s coming home with us then, kiddo.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes! Thank you, Mami!” Nicky exclaimed, hugging her. “Love you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled, squeezing him tight. “I love you too.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Seven years later.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha’s smile only widened the further down the beach she got. From their back gate to the blankets her wife set up was a corridor of photos and fairy lights depicting their life together. She gazed at every one, fingers brushing over a picture of their wedding day, eyes raking over the image of Nicky, Noa and Pancake running along the very beach she stood on.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I guess time means nothing when I’m with you.<em> Rio had said to her once.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>And it didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>All of a sudden seven years had flown by. Wasn’t it only yesterday she’d been forced to join The Smith’s Programme? Wasn’t it only yesterday Nicky was asking her to ‘kiss it better’ when he’d fallen off his bike, and Noa was asking for another bedtime story before bed? They were somehow teenagers now.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha continued down the path, stopping to stare at a photograph of her wife, kids, Isabella, best friends and their kid and Lilia at Rio’s birthday dinner until her eyes fell on the woman herself.<br/>
</p><p>She needed a better word than beautiful.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wore a long orange dress that had gold dots placed sporadically on it, reflecting off the moonlight and lamps she’d set up. Sitting on her exposed chest was the gold ‘A’ necklace she never went without, and Agatha tried not to swallow at the sight of Rio’s thigh exposed by the large dress slit.<br/>
</p><p>“Did you just swallow at the sight of my thigh?” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>She needed a moment, pausing before the creation her wife made. Rio had put down blankets, pillows, bottles of wine, food platters, a banner that said, ‘Happy Anniversary, Mi Amor,’ and a projector and screen.<br/>
</p><p>“You like?” Rio grinned. “The kids helped before they left.”<br/>
</p><p>“They did?”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” her wife nodded.<br/>
</p><p>The tears started welling.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby, you can’t cry yet. The night’s just started. You’ll ruin your makeup,” Rio said, coming towards her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted. “No, you’re right.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled, planting a kiss on her lips and tugging her onto the blankets.<br/>
</p><p>“I like your dress,” Rio commented.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked at her black satin Ralph Lauren off-the-shoulder dress. “Would hope so, you bought it for me.”<br/>
</p><p>“That’s why I like it,” Rio replied, that grin reappearing. “You ready?”<br/>
</p><p>“For…”<br/>
</p><p>Rio hummed, turning her attention to the bottle of wine next to her. When the two glasses were filled, Rio pulled a remote from underneath her. The projector whirled to life, and Agatha smiled at the text on screen.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>‘Seven years of us.’<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“You did this?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Nick and Noa helped again.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha chuckled, pulling her wife into her. Rio rested her head against her chest, and Agatha’s hand found its way to Rio’s rib. It usually ended up there; it was where her wife had gotten a tattoo of their family’s birthdays. The order went from oldest to youngest.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pressed play.<br/>
</p><p>Their entire life together compressed into a two-hour video.<br/>
</p><p>The wives sipped on their wine and munched on the food as they laughed at the photos of Agatha covered in snow from the ski mission, videos of them riding around on jet skis in Portofino for Rio’s thirty-third birthday, them high out of their minds passed out in their rooftop garden in New York.<br/>
</p><p>“How’d you explain this one to the kids?” Agatha laughed, the wine’s effects evident.<br/>
</p><p>“Told them we had a tough mission.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed so hard she snorted three times in a row.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby…baby,” Rio tried to get out.<br/>
</p><p>They collapsed into each other, laughing so hard no sound came out. Agatha slapped at Rio, who tried and failed to tell her to stop. Her chest hurt, and she had a stitch. Agatha wanted so desperately to stop, but every time she looked at her wife rolling around on the blanket, she couldn’t help herself.<br/>
</p><p>“We need…we need…” Rio started wheezing, and Agatha genuinely thought she was going to die from laughter. “Ocean,” Rio choked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wiped under her eyes. “Wh- what?” She cackled.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife said nothing, just forced her to her feet.<br/>
</p><p>“Why-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha screamed, Rio tossing her over her shoulder and bolting down the beach.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t…you-” she gave up when she saw the water beneath them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, and as soon as she did, she was weightless.<br/>
</p><p>“Ri-!”<br/>
</p><p>Water surrounded her, rushing into her ears and eyes. Agatha snapped them shut, swimming frantically to the surface.<br/>
</p><p>“Every fucking time!” She yelled when she remerged.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was beside herself. “We…we needed to calm down!”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, because you’re so calm now.”<br/>
</p><p>Her wife grinned, swimming towards her. Agatha felt Rio’s hands on her dress, pulling it up until her hands were on bare skin.<br/>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows. “What are you-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha yelped when Rio gripped her thighs and lifted her onto her hips.<br/>
</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. “I hate you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Rio smiled, leaning in to kiss her.<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t take long for that light peck to turn into tongue and teeth. Didn’t take long for the hair pulling and the wandering hands. Didn’t take long for the desperate whines and Agatha shifting to find any sort of friction.<br/>
</p><p>“I…n- need you, baby,” Agatha said breathlessly between kisses. “P-please.”<br/>
</p><p>“Greedy girl,” Rio smirked. “Let’s go then.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Can’t wait. Now.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled back, eyebrow raised. “Are you-”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, I’m fucking serious!” Agatha snapped. She huffed pathetically. “<em>Baby<em>,” she pleaded.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Do that again,” Rio whispered in her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“Please. Anything,” Agatha whined. “I’ll take anything.”<br/>
</p><p>She felt movement, her wife’s fingers brushing against her entrance. Agatha jolted, the water splashing around them.<br/>
</p><p>“No underwear? Desperate, are we?”<br/>
</p><p>“You call it desperation; I call it being-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha cut herself off when her wife tugged on the short, coarse hairs of her cunt. The moan was involuntary, and her head fell to rest on Rio’s forehead.<br/>
</p><p>“Stop toying with me,” Agatha forced out.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?”<br/>
</p><p>Her eyebrows pinched. “Baby!”<br/>
</p><p>That smirk returned as Rio finally slipped her fingers inside.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gasped, fingers hooking onto Rio’s necklace to ground her. Her eyes fluttered shut, easy pleasure washing over her entire body as her wife’s fingers pumped. The grip on the necklace tightened the second her wife added another finger; she smiled at the groan Rio let escape because of it.<br/>
</p><p>And to drive the knife in.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, let her pathetic whimpers fill her wife’s ears.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s fingers stilled for a moment as if she’d lost a hold of herself before they continued.<br/>
</p><p>She smiled, enjoying the fact that after so many years, they still got lost in each other. It was one look from Rio, one touch, one word, and Agatha would lose her senses.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife still made her feel like a horny teenager, still made her feel giddy like a kid in a candy store, still made her feel loved unconditionally.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pressed her thumb against Agatha’s clit, and the water splashed around them, Agatha unable to gain control of her body.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife had the remote; her body reacted accordingly.<br/>
</p><p>She’d undoubtedly left marks around Rio’s neck from how hard she’d been tugging.<br/>
</p><p>“You…you okay? Want me to let go?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Don’t you dare.”<br/>
</p><p>A laugh spilt out before she interrupted herself with a sharp gasp, Rio pressing firmly against her clit.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck! I’m gonna-”<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t let her finish, crashing their lips together as Agatha’s body pulled taut. The ocean lapped against them, and Agatha was surprised she hadn’t snapped Rio’s necklace in half by how hard she’d yanked.<br/>
</p><p>Their lips broke apart when Rio gasped. Agatha felt the tension in her body at an all-time high before she relaxed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her wife’s arms, studying her.<br/>
</p><p>“Did you just…did you just come untouched?”<br/>
</p><p>“No.”<br/>
</p><p>“You did!” Agatha cackled. “I love you so much.”<br/>
</p><p>“I love you too,” Rio grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled before dipping her head down to kiss the love of her life.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Eight years later.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Nicky poked his head out from behind the wings.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>That’s a lot of people.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Every seat in the theatre was filled with parents and peers. He’d never sung on his own before, only with the school choir. Maybe he was in over his head. Maybe it was too soon for the school talent show.<br/>
</p><p>He nodded, ready to tell Mrs Hart that he wasn’t doing it, when his eyes snagged onto his family in the crowd. His sister was holding up a ‘Just pretend everyone’s naked’ sign.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky laughed, his hand flying to his mouth as Melissa Judd continued her violin solo.<br/>
</p><p>He needed to stop being surprised that Noa would always know exactly what he’d need to hear at any given moment. Nicky had gotten so lucky with his sister. He still didn’t know the full story as to why his parents adopted her or why her name changed from Valentina to Noa.<br/>
</p><p>But did the whys even matter?<br/>
</p><p>He couldn’t imagine his life any differently. Maybe his family had had to suffer to get to this point, but Nicky hoped they felt it was worth it.<br/>
</p><p>He most certainly did.<br/>
</p><p>“And now we welcome to the stage, Nicholas Harkness-Vidal.”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky sucked in a breath before walking onto the stage.<br/>
</p><p>His moms, Noa, Aunts, Sky and Grandma Lilia were the only ones standing, their cheers loud.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky would never know silence.<br/>
</p><p>“Go on, Nick!” Noa and Sky screamed together, waving Noa’s sign.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s my boy!” His mama yelled, wiping at her tears, his mami soothing her.<br/>
</p><p>His Aunt Alice had her camera out, and his Aunt Jen kept whistling.<br/>
</p><p>His Grandma, like his mom, was a wreck.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky smiled. “Hi, everyone. Today, my talent is singing.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Ten years later.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Noa sluggishly came down the stairs. The smell of burnt food wafted through the air which only meant one thing: her mami had attempted to make breakfast.<br/>
</p><p>“Morning Pancake,” Noa mumbled when her dog rubbed against her leg.<br/>
</p><p>“But you know how to make pancakes, baby. How did you burn them?” She heard her mama ask when she turned the corner.<br/>
</p><p>Their kitchen looked like a bomb had gone off the way it usually did when either her mom or Nick made food.<br/>
</p><p>“No sé- buenos días, Nono,” her mami greeted when she saw her.<br/>
</p><p>“Buenos días,” Noa replied, slumping onto a chair around the island.<br/>
</p><p>Her mom grinned. “Still hungover, are we?”<br/>
</p><p>“I didn’t drink that much, Mama,” Noa huffed.<br/>
</p><p>“Sureee,” she replied. “Mami’s burnt breakfast, so do you want to go out to eat?”<br/>
</p><p>Noa nodded with a yawn.<br/>
</p><p>Her mom laughed. “Okay. When Nick’s up, we’ll go.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa nodded again.<br/>
</p><p>Her moms shuffled about the kitchen, loading the dishwasher, cleaning surfaces, peeling pancakes off the ceiling?<br/>
</p><p>“And what’s up with you, little miss?” Her mama asked a while later.<br/>
</p><p>“¿Qué?”<br/>
</p><p>Her mothers glanced at each other before her mami said:<br/>
</p><p>“You’re being uncharacteristically quiet, mija. You’ve usually debriefed us about your night by now. The party wasn’t good?”<br/>
</p><p>Noa shrugged. “It was fine.”<br/>
</p><p>Her mothers glanced at each other again.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” her mami said, returning to her task.<br/>
</p><p>“But if you want to talk about it, we’re here,” her mama added.<br/>
</p><p>Noa nodded, let her moms continue to clean the kitchen before she blurted out:<br/>
</p><p>“How many people have you killed?”<br/>
</p><p>Her moms froze.<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” Her mama asked.<br/>
</p><p>Her mami smacked her. “We haven’t killed anyone.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa rolled her eyes. Her mami always said this whenever their job was brought up, as if she hadn’t seen them in action.<br/>
</p><p>“So how many would you say?” Noa continued.<br/>
</p><p>“A decent amount,” her mama answered.<br/>
</p><p>“Could you give me an estimated number?”<br/>
</p><p>“Not a chance in hell, baby girl,” her mama said.<br/>
</p><p>Noa huffed. “Okay…so that means you’re well-versed in hiding bodies then?”<br/>
</p><p>Her moms heads snapped towards her.<br/>
</p><p>“What’d you do?” “Who’d you kill?” They asked at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“No one!” Noa stressed. “But hypothetically, if I were to kill someone, would you help me hide the body?”<br/>
</p><p>“Without hesitation.”<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs,” her mami scolded, smacking at her.<br/>
</p><p>Her mama pulled a face. “Why are you acting as if that wouldn’t be your first response?”<br/>
</p><p>“Because at least one of us has to respond responsibly.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bullshit,” her mama grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Noa smiled. Ten years on, and her parents had never changed. They still teased each other, bickered with each other, <em>loved<em> each other. It was this or nothing Noa realised. If she fell in love, but it didn’t feel like what her mothers had, she didn’t want it.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Why are you asking about murder anyway, mija?”<br/>
</p><p>Noa folded over the island, resting her face on her arms.<br/>
</p><p>“This girl-”<br/>
</p><p>“Has done what?” Her mama jumped in. “She hurt you? Because I swear to g-”<br/>
</p><p>“Shush,” her mami soothed. “Let her explain first, okay, baby?”<br/>
</p><p>Noa lifted her head.<br/>
</p><p>“But she hasn’t hurt you, right?” Her mami checked, that same venom her mama displayed evident in her voice.<br/>
</p><p>Noa shook her head, and both her mothers relaxed.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, then what is it?”<br/>
</p><p>“This girl keeps fucking with my head,” Noa groaned. “Like, she told me she was straight, but then yesterday at Tilly’s party she kissed me, and I was too drunk to stop her. And, she keeps flirting with me at school, and I’ll always go ‘Aren’t you straight?’ and she’s always like ‘Can’t I test the waters? That’s what you do.’ Mind you, I’m bisexual. I’m not testing the fucking waters! It’s so invalidating! And-”<br/>
</p><p>“Sweetheart, calm down,” her mami said, taking off her dirty apron and sitting beside her. Her mama brought over a cup of apple juice before she took up the seat on her other side.<br/>
</p><p>Noa downed the cup in one gulp.<br/>
</p><p>“You want another?” Her mama smiled.<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head. “Moral of the story is, if I just killed Zara, then she wouldn’t be able to fuck with me.”<br/>
</p><p>Her mami laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Noa moaned.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re just like your mama, oh so very dramatic.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not dramatic!” Noa and her mama snapped at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“Point proven,” her mami laughed. “Anyway, you can’t resort to killing, Nono.”<br/>
</p><p>“But that’s literally what you and Mom do.”<br/>
</p><p>Her mami waggled her finger. “Because it’s our <em>job<em>, mija.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Noa rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“What you do instead is tell…Zara?”<br/>
</p><p>Noa nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“To fuck off and that you have no interest in being an experiment,” her mama continued. “It isn’t fair to you, and nine times out of ten, stuff like this will leave you heartbroken if you don’t shut it down immediately. And then no one wins because I’ll have to hunt down a sixteen-year-old girl for breaking my baby’s heart, etc,” she finished, squeezing Noa’s cheeks<br/>
</p><p>Noa batted her mother’s hand away with a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you talking about Zara <em>again<em>?” Nick groaned, entering the kitchen, Pancake at his heels.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“No es de tu incumbencia.” <em>It’s none of your business.<em> Noa bit out at the same time her moms:<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Look who finally got out of bed.”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, how lovely of you to grace us with your presence, Nicholas”<br/>
</p><p>Nick pulled a face. “Smells like burning, Mami attempted to make breakfast?”<br/>
</p><p>Their mami wacked at him, and Nicky swerved out of the way with a chuckle.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re going out for breakfast, okay?” She snipped.<br/>
</p><p>Their kitchen filled with laughter.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio was running about the house like a madwoman. Everything had to be perfect before her wife returned in, she checked her watch, half an hour?!<br/>
</p><p>“Mierda.” <em>Shit.<em> Rio muttered.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Where do you want me to put this?” Alice appeared, waving metal tongs.<br/>
</p><p>“Put it by the barbecue,” Rio instructed.<br/>
</p><p>Alice nodded and left.<br/>
</p><p>“Mami!” Noa called.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rounded the corner and looked up at her daughter on the stairs. “¿Sí, mija?”<br/>
</p><p>“¿Falda, sí o no?” Noa asked, holding a denim miniskirt.<br/>
</p><p>Sky joined Noa on the landing.<br/>
</p><p>“I told her to wear it,” Sky informed, swiping one of her goddess braids behind her ear.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s cute,” Rio answered. “Didn’t you buy that when you were with Mama?”<br/>
</p><p>“Sí.”<br/>
</p><p>“Then wear it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” Noa replied, the same time a text from Nicky came in.<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Nicky: mami, i can’t distract her any longer. we’re coming home now.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>“Mierda.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at her son who was tapping furiously at his phone in the passenger seat. She was supposed to let this stuff go. If Nick wanted to tell her about it, he would…<br/>
</p><p>Too bad she was already pissed her wife and daughter hadn’t come to brunch with them on today of all days. So naturally, Agatha snapped:<br/>
</p><p>“Nick, who the fuck are you texting?!”<br/>
</p><p>“No one!” Nicky said defensively.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. “You know I was a federal agent, right? Telling lies and uncovering them was my profession.”<br/>
</p><p>“Congrats?” Nick replied.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha side-eyed him. “You and your sister are becoming more and more alike every day.”<br/>
</p><p>“Why do you feel the need to insult me?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed. “That wasn’t an insult.”<br/>
</p><p>“Sure,” Nicky mumbled before returning to his texting.<br/>
</p><p>“Seriously?”<br/>
</p><p>“If you must know, I’m texting your wife,” Nicky told her.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not texting Mami.”<br/>
</p><p>“How would you-”<br/>
</p><p>“You take seven to ten business days to text us back,” Agatha interrupted.<br/>
</p><p>“That’s not true.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nick-”<br/>
</p><p>“Fine! I’m texting my girlfriend!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha almost stopped the car in the middle of the road.<br/>
</p><p>“Your what?! Since when?!”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky’s cheeks flushed red, and he ran a hand through his dark curls. “Since yesterday.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw a hand up. “So at dinner yesterday when Mami and I asked, ‘Did anything interesting happen at school today?’ You didn’t think <em>that<em> was interesting.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Nicky pulled on his baggy jeans. “I didn’t feel like being bombarded with questions, plus Noa would’ve taken the piss.”<br/>
</p><p>“Can you blame her? Every time she mentions a girl or boy, you tease her about it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Because that’s what brothers <em>do<em>,” Nicky stated.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Agatha smiled. “When do we get to meet her?”<br/>
</p><p>“Never.”<br/>
</p><p>“Nick-”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m serious. I love you guys, but you’d scare her.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gasped, feigning offence. “<em>Scare her?!<em> We would never!”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Nick rolled his eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Can I get a name at least?” Agatha asked as they pulled up to their drive. “Wait…isn’t that Aunt Jen’s car?”<br/>
</p><p>“Her name's Riele!” Nicky blurted.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“We’re home,” Agatha called when she and Nicky entered the house.<br/>
</p><p>No reply, not even Pancake came to meet them.<br/>
</p><p>She furrowed her eyebrows, and Nick shrugged.<br/>
</p><p>They walked further into the house, finding the kitchen empty…the kitchen was never empty. She found the same result in the living room. Agatha didn’t want it to, but her heartbeat picked up a notch.<br/>
</p><p>This felt far too familiar.<br/>
</p><p>“Nick, go back outside,” Agatha said calmly.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” he replied.<br/>
</p><p>“No, Nicky. Not that way,” Agatha whispered when her son went to their back door.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha chased after him. “Nick! Nick-”<br/>
</p><p>“SURPRISE!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked. Her backyard was filled with her family: Rio, Noa, Jen, Alice, Sky, Lilia, Isabella, Samuel, Pancake. They all had stupid birthday hats on and grins on their faces.<br/>
</p><p>“Happy birthday, baby!” Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Words were lost on her as she stared at the food on the barbecue, the ‘Happy Birthday’ banner over the pool, the balloons, the table of food, the presents.<br/>
</p><p>“I…how didn’t I figure out you were doing this!” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Her family laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“Happy birthday, Mama,” Nick and Noa said simultaneously, planting a kiss on each of her cheeks.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you, loves,” Agatha replied, squeezing them.<br/>
</p><p>“Forty-three,” Jen started. “Why are we still friends? I’ve known you for too long.”<br/>
</p><p>Her kids released her, and Agatha rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“You almost spoiled my surprise.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“Your car, Jen. It’s parked outside.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice groaned. “Babe, I told you to park it at the end of the street.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted.<br/>
</p><p>The rest of her family greeted her and wished her a happy birthday until it was her wife’s turn. And that smile, Agatha loved it so much.<br/>
</p><p>“You know, I was so ready to be mad at you when I got home,” Agatha said, Rio wrapping an arm around her waist.<br/>
</p><p>“Because Noa and I didn’t want to come to brunch?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Thought my own wife and daughter didn’t want to spend time with me on my birthday.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Could never spend your birthday apart. We were forced to do that once, never again.”<br/>
</p><p>Blue eyes flicked between brown, tears welling.<br/>
</p><p>“Te amo muchísimo, thank you,” Agatha breathed.<br/>
</p><p>“No pasa nada y I love you too,” Rio replied, stealing a kiss.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio always found it odd how much she appreciated the smaller things in life now. Ten years ago, the only joy she found was on long missions, infiltrating governments, going deep undercover. She was an adrenaline junky, a perfectionist and lived to work.<br/>
</p><p>Now, Rio simply lived.<br/>
</p><p>Lived for sunset beach walks with her kids, wife and dog. Lived for basketball games with the friends she’d made. Lived for her wife’s smile just as it was now after an evening of eating and drinking in celebration of her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha held a painting of a fifties-style cinema Nicky painted, and Rio couldn’t help but record the entire thing. It was something to remember, Agatha surrounded by their family, the sunset and ocean behind her.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s beautiful, Nick,” Agatha told him, kissing his cheek.<br/>
</p><p>“I could sell that in my art gallery, you know,” Samuel chimed in.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky shook his head. “Nah, it’s one of a kind like Mom.”<br/>
</p><p>A collective ‘Aw’ came in response.<br/>
</p><p>“Shut up,” Nicky told them, his cheeks reddening.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t be embarrassed, Nicky,” Isabella teased, squeezing him.<br/>
</p><p>Her wife opened more presents, and that smile only grew.<br/>
</p><p>“I mean…it’s kinda dumb,” Noa began before Agatha shook her head.<br/>
</p><p>“No, baby. I love it.”<br/>
</p><p>Noa had given her a photo album, everything down to the cover she’d sourced and made herself. The photos were filled with images she’d taken on the film camera they’d gotten her on her fourteenth birthday.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha kissed her on the cheek, and Noa’s eyebrows pinched. She choked before flinging her arms around her.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, Rio was a goner. The tears rolled down her face.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay, Nono?” Agatha soothed.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Noa mumbled. “I just erm…I love you, Mama.”<br/>
</p><p>“Me too,” Nick added.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pouted, opening her arms to invite him in. "I love you both so much."<br/>
</p><p>“Go on,” Lilia urged, taking the phone off Rio.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t need to be told twice. Nicky shifted, and Rio fit easily into the space, arms circling her kids; eyes locked on her wife.<br/>
</p><p>Like Rio said, it was the simple things.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>She’d do it all again.<br/>
</p><p>The childhood filled with abuse, Wanda, shooting the wrong politician, going through Rio’s kidnapping, all of it, if it meant she’d end up right here. Just like Rio walking into her life, finding her family was inevitable.<br/>
</p><p>For years, Agatha only found love in small doses. Now she was surrounded by a consistent flow, as if it could never run out. And Agatha genuinely didn’t think it could.<br/>
</p><p>Her gaze fell on her kids opposite. “You should go,” she encouraged.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re not leaving you on your birthday, Mama,” Nicky replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Why not? We’re almost done here, and it’s not like I’m going to complain about being alone with Mami.”<br/>
</p><p>Her kids groaned.<br/>
</p><p>“Ew.”<br/>
</p><p>“All the food I ate is going to come back up.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “You should go to the party.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re sure? It’s your birthday,” Noa repeated.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m positive. I didn’t spend all that money on getting your hair dyed for you to not show it off,” Agatha smiled, running her hands through her daughter’s layered jet black hair.<br/>
</p><p>Noa rolled her eyes playfully.<br/>
</p><p>“Is you’re girlfriend going to be there, Nick?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Sky jumped in.<br/>
</p><p>Nicky glared at her, and Sky giggled.<br/>
</p><p>Noa furrowed her eyebrows. “You told Mama about, Riele?”<br/>
</p><p>“Who’s Riele?” Rio butted in, sitting down with a slice of tres leches.<br/>
</p><p>“Nick’s girlfriend,” Noa informed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes flared. “Girlfriend?!”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay…so we’re going to go,” Nicky said hastily.<br/>
</p><p>“Noa and Nicholas Harkness-Vidal, get your asses back here!” Rio yelled as their kids ran towards the sliding back door.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head playfully. “We miss you already!” she called with a grin.<br/>
</p><p>“Not nearly as much as us!” Came the reply.</p>
