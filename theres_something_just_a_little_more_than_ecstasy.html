<div class="userstuff">
<p>Running her gloved hand over her face, Agatha wiped the rain from her eyes. Her rooftop stoop was unsheltered, and her hat was so sodden that it was no longer effective. Spending hours in the downpour had left her soaked through and regretting her choice of lookout for the night. She was beginning to wonder if she'd been given bad intel as she stared down at the empty street. The odd person scurrying through the bad weather caught her attention, but the action she was hoping for was nowhere to be found.</p><p>When it had been an hour since the last sight of movement, Agatha straightened with a sigh and resolved to have a word with her informants. She stretched out her cold and achy limbs and made her way back to the street, carefully climbing down the building the same way she'd gone up. Turning her collar up and shoving her hands in her pockets, Agatha boots splashed through the muddy puddles. The din of people safely inside warm taverns and the hard patter of raindrops against stone were loud in her ears. Loud enough to drown out what was coming.</p><p>Agatha’s breath was knocked out of her as her back was slammed into a brick wall, her eyes trying to adjust to the lack of light in the alleyway. Hands clutched at her lapels, an inhuman strength holding her in place as a shadow leaned closer.</p><p>“You're following me again.” The familiar voice sent a shiver down her spine.</p><p>“Can't a girl just enjoy a nice evening stroll?” A rumble of thunder punctuated Agatha’s query as her fingers desperately searched for their target in the folds of her coat.</p><p>“You picked the perfect night for it.” A cold hand grasped at Agatha’s jaw, forcefully turning her head to the side. Rain splattered against her newly exposed neck, jugular vulnerable as she was unable to pull away.</p><p>As the shadow moved closer, breathing in her scent, Agatha managed to palm her salvation. The feeling of lips against her skin had her on the move.</p><p>“Not so fast.” Agatha pressed her weapon to the shadow’s chest, sharp enough to pierce skin and draw the smallest bead of blood. “Buy me a drink first.”</p><p>A frustrated huff came before the hands loosened their grip and the shadow backed off. “Can't blame a girl for trying.”</p><p>As she took another step back, the shadow’s face caught the light of a street lamp. The cocky smirk of an elegant woman shone through the darkness before disappearing back into the gloom, and Agatha was struck by how beautiful she was up close. Of course she was beautiful, it was part of the ruse. Lure unsuspecting victims in with good looks and pretty words, then spit them out when they've had their fill. Focus, Harkness.</p><p>“You're right. Must be a tough night for dinner. Not many warm meals venturing into the storm.” Agatha straightened herself, fixing the collar of her coat as she held the sharpened piece of wood aloft. She backed her way toward the lamp lit street, trying to keep the shadow in her eyeline.</p><p>“Hmm… something like that.” Her voice came like a purr as she teased Agatha from the edge of darkness. “Are you here to put a damper on the evening? Send me to my room without dinner?”</p><p>“I had a bit more than that in mind actually.” Agatha watched the woman closely, each movement graceful but precise. Her eyes flashed at her words and a chuckle came deep from her throat.</p><p>“Aren't you so big and scary? You've got me shaking in my boots.” Her chuckle turned into a laugh. “You think you can kill me with your hunter costume and a single stake? Well I've got news for you sweetheart.” The woman surged forward, fangs bared.</p><p>Agatha was embarrassed by how quickly she faltered, taking a step back with a stumble off the curb and into the street. Her eyes darted from one danger to another as a carriage came barreling towards her, no time to dodge out of the way of massive hooves. For the second time that night, her breath was knocked from her chest as a solid blow pushed her to the ground. Her arms raising to her head, she prepared herself for the impact that never came. The carriage hurried past her, the horses undeterred from their route, and Agatha was left gasping and alone in the middle of the road. Eyes darting towards the shadows, she carefully picked herself up and waited for the other shoe to drop.</p><p>As the bumps of carriage wheels on the cobblestones disappeared into the night, the only sound Agatha was left with was the unrelenting rain. As far as she could tell, the shadows were empty. She truly was alone. Stooping to pick up the stake that had fallen from her fingers, she tried to piece together her thoughts. She had been seconds away from the fight of her life, heart pumping and hand tightening around wood. There would be a bruise forming on her chest, she could feel the dull ache spreading under her skin. Her hand raised to the place, fingers splayed against the soaked fabric of her shirt in the image she was certain she'd find there in the morning.</p><p>The woman had pushed her out of the path of the carriage. The woman who had been moments away from attempting to rip out her throat had pushed her to safety, and when she was vulnerable on the ground, ripe for the picking, she just left. It didn't make any sense. Why would the woman do such a thing? No… not a woman. Vampire.</p>

<p>Agatha stood in front of the mirror for a long time the next morning, her fingers gingerly tracing the shape of the bruise blooming against her sternum. The sheer force of the handprint had been enough to clear her from danger. She wasn't surprised by that, she'd already experienced the woman’s strength as she was pinned against the wall. She was surprised by how purposeful the gesture was. Clear indentations of fingerprints were visible against her skin, Agatha's own hand fitting perfectly inside the lines of purple and blue. She'd spent the rest of the night awake in bed, staring at the ceiling and trying to understand.</p><p>Laying on the wet street, gasping for breath, Agatha had been easy prey. The woman hadn't hesitated to try and kill her before. Her fingers drifted up to her neck, skimming across the place those lips had been. Agatha felt a lurch in her stomach as she thought about it, the woman's face swimming in the darkness of the memory.</p><p>A sharp knock on the door jolted her from her thoughts and she wrapped her shirt around herself.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, your carriage has arrived.”</p><p>“Shit.” Agatha whispered as she scrambled for the closet. “Thank you! I'll be down in a minute!”</p><p>Hearing the footsteps retreat, she hurriedly finished dressing. She was going to be late, which inevitably meant she'd get last pick for assignments. Finishing fastening her corset, Agatha raced down the stairs, grabbed her daytime coat and hat from the hook, and climbed into the carriage with a huff. As soon as they were off, she set about making herself more presentable while she thought about how she was going to report the events of last night. She didn't think anyone would believe her, so she decided to stick to what she was planning to say before the encounter.</p><p>The carriage slowed to a stop outside of the modiste, where Agatha climbed out with a nod to the driver. The bell over the door chimed as she walked in, drawing the attention of the handful of patrons and the young boy behind the counter, who greeted her with a cheerful smile.</p><p>“Good morning, Ms. Harkness. We've got some samples for you in the back to take a look at.”</p><p>“Thank you, Tommy. Is your mother here already?” Agatha made her way towards the curtain at the back of the shop.</p><p>“Yes ma'am. You're late.” The boy grinned at her and she narrowed her eyes back at him with a hum.</p><p>Behind the curtain, Agatha stepped into the changing booth removing her gloves and carefully unpinning her hat. With a glance at herself in the mirror and a little sigh, she reached for the sconce on the wall. A twist of the metal arm to the left and the sound of gears turning whispered beneath her feet. The floor began to sink, lowering her slowly to the level hidden below the dress shop. As the booth clunked into place, Agatha braced her shoulders, pursed her lips and made her way further into the basement. It was much louder down here, the clicks and whirs of mechanical contraptions filling the air. The floor was full of workbenches where people fiddled with various machines.</p><p>“You're late!”</p><p>The voice Agatha had been bracing for called across the room as the woman herself stood up from a desk.</p><p>“Am I, Lilia? I hadn't noticed.” Agatha wound through the workbenches towards her.</p><p>“I don't appreciate the snark, Harkness. Get in there, we’re waiting on you.” The older woman, the matriarch of their little branch, gestured towards the curtain that separated the workshop from another room, waiting for Agatha to duck through it before following.</p><p>Standing around a large table with a map of the city embedded in it, the others looked up as they entered. About a dozen women filled the dimly lit room, ceasing their conversations in favour of giving Lilia their attention.</p><p>“Let’s begin, now that we’re all here…” Agatha rolled her eyes at Lilia's passive aggressiveness and moved towards the back of the room to lean against the wall.</p><p>They went around the room, reporting on the happenings of the night. Sightings here and there, new leads, mysterious disappearances and attacks, and reports on movements from specific targets. When it was Agatha's turn, she pushed herself off the wall with a sigh and stepped forward into the light hanging from the ceiling.</p><p>“The west end was uneventful. All I got were ruined stockings and the startings of a cold.”</p><p>Lilia looked up from the map with a raised eyebrow. “Really? That's surprising. We've been getting a lot of chatter about that area.”</p><p>“Well you should speak to your informants about better leads. It was a waste of time.” Agatha accidentally made eye contact with the woman standing to her right as she moved back to the wall, her heart jumping with worry that she'd noticed something amiss.</p><p>“Alice? Jen? What about you? You weren't very far from Agatha last night, any activity?”</p><p>Two women on her left stepped forward, grinning at each other and buzzing with excitement. “We got one.”</p><p>The whole room burst into chatter, people clapping them on the back and offering congratulations. A voice, that might have been Agatha's, rang through the noise. “Prove it.”</p><p>Silence hitting the room, Jen reached for her bag and pulled out a necklace with a cameo pendant, holding her trophy under the light to a few quiet gasps.</p><p>Alice pointed out a street on the map. “We were staking out the back alley here. Jen spotted her first, a young girl exiting out the back of the gentlemen's club. We followed and didn't have to wait very long. The beast pushed the girl against the wall but didn't notice us until it was too late.” Everyone was hanging on to her every word, a thirst for action in all of their throats.</p><p>“Alice got the girl to safety when I managed to pin the beast's arms before she drove the stake home. The bloodsucker was ash before she knew what was happening.”</p><p><em>She</em>. Agatha’s stomach lurched as she tried to recall her own night, the ghost of a memory burning against her chest. Had the woman been wearing a necklace? Jen and Alice hadn't been very far. Could she have left Agatha only to end up running towards her end. Agatha tugged at her collar, finding it hard to breathe, thankful that nobody was looking at her as they continued congratulating the women. She was just mad that Jen and Alice had stolen her kill. That's what the feeling was. She'd spent the night in the cold and they were being lauded instead. She clenched her hand at her side, trying to calm her heartbeat, when she felt a light touch at her wrist.</p><p>“Are you okay?” The woman on her right, Wanda, lowered her voice so the others wouldn't hear.</p><p>“Fine.” Building her walls back up, Agatha focused on pulling her gloves on. “I'm just sick of getting stuck with dud assignments.” She pulled away from the woman and made to leave the room, stopping to speak to Lilia. “When you're done celebrating the golden duo, send a messenger to let me know where you'd like me patrolling tonight.” She didn't wait to be chastised before storming out. Nobody would be surprised by her antics. She'd always been competitive. It was a good enough cover to get her out of that room and onto the street where she could breathe.</p><p>By the time she got home, Agatha had convinced herself that the vampire Jen and Alice had killed couldn't possibly be hers. Her vampire was way too strong, way too smart for those idiots to get the drop on her. No, Agatha was going to go out tonight and kill her herself. She spent the rest of the day in her basement preparing, the woman swimming through her thoughts with each blow to the sparring bag, taunting her. Her heart pounded in her chest, her body flush with exertion, as she took out the frustrations of the last twenty-four hours. It wasn't until her butler came down that she realised time had gotten away from her, the sun nearly setting outside.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, young Master Maximoff is at the door for you.”</p><p>“Thank you Ralph. I'll be right up.”</p><p>Wiping her face with a towel, Agatha fixed her hair and made herself more presentable before heading upstairs to see her guest. He was in the foyer, carefully examining one of her paintings.</p><p>“Hi Billy.”</p><p>“Oh! Hi Agatha!” He jumped at the sound of her voice, nearly dropping a bundle he had stowed under his arm. “I was sent with your assignment for tonight. Mum said you weren't feeling well and left early.”</p><p>Leave it to Wanda to try to smooth over her dramatic exit. Agatha wasn't sure what she'd done to warrant the woman’s attempts at friendship. “Something like that.” She took the carefully folded paper offered to her and stuffed it in her pocket. “What do you have there?”</p><p>“Oh! I've been working on a new toy and thought maybe you'd like to test run it.” Billy set the bundle on a side table and excitedly unwrapped it, holding it up so she could see. It was some sort of leather binding with a contraption attached.</p><p>“What does it do?” Agatha crossed her arms over her chest, becoming skeptical of said toy.</p><p>“So it straps to your arm like this.” Billy began lashing the bindings to his forearm as he spoke. “And it's small enough that you should be able to hide it under your sleeve.” He pulled his own sleeve over it. “And then, when they're least expecting it…” He lifted his arm, the click of a spring sounding and a stake rapidly appearing in his hand.</p><p>Agatha let out an appreciative whistle, reaching out to examine the device. “Hell yes!” This was going to be a game changer. “Show me how it works.”</p>

<p>As she leaned against the alley wall, head tilted to keep an eye on the street, Agatha was thankful that it wasn't raining again. Her coat and hat were still slightly damp from the night before, the leather not having had enough time to dry out. She stifled a yawn into her sleeve and rolled a crick out of her neck. The lack of sleep was getting to her, but she needed to snap out of it. The night was still young. As expected, her antics that morning had landed her back in the same neighbourhood. Her report of zero activity meant that nobody else had wanted the assignment. Knowing the woman was too smart to hunt the same streets two nights in a row, Agatha was worried she was in for a quiet night of watching drunks stumble home from the shadows.</p><p>Another yawn forced itself from Agatha's mouth and she leaned her head back against the brick for a moment. The weight of her new weapon was heavy against her wrist and she was itching to try it out. The longer she sat waiting, the more her confidence began to falter. Maybe her vampire had moved on from this neighbourhood afterall, looking for somewhere free of her patrol. Or maybe Jen and Alice killed her vampire last night. A sinking feeling hit Agatha, one that she pinned on jealousy and not anything else. She wanted to be the one to put an end to her, to look her in the eyes and plunge a stake through her heart.</p><p>The sound of a glass bottle being kicked down the street jolted Agatha awake. She must have dozed off for a moment, sinking to the ground in search of a more comfortable position. She glanced around the corner, watching as a clearly drunk man wandered down the street in the other direction, humming a tune she couldn't place. Rubbing her hand over her face in an attempt to bring herself back to alertness, Agatha groaned and pushed herself to her feet and away from the wall. Looking down at her pocket watch, she silently cursed at herself. It hadn't just been a moment, she'd fallen asleep for almost two hours. With a shake of her head, she glanced up and down the street again before contemplating just going home.</p><p>“You look tired. You should probably call it a night.”</p><p>Agatha froze as she was about to step out of the alley, the darkness calling to her. She slowly turned, her fingers hovering over the mechanism at her wrist. The woman stepped out of the shadows, a look of innocence about her that anybody else would have fallen for.</p><p>“Why? So you can hunt in peace?”</p><p>A smile flashed across her face, no fangs in sight as she tilted her head. “Not at all, sweetheart. Because you look dead on your feet and I'm worried you're going to keel over.”</p><p>Sweetheart. She'd called Agatha that last night before leaping forward to kill her. Hearing it again sent ice down her spine.</p><p>“Oh don't worry, I'm fine. More than fit enough to take you on.” Agatha braced herself for action, watching each of her movements carefully for any sign of attack.</p><p>“Hmm, I believe you.” The woman slowly walked around her, hands up as a gesture of peace. “Did you know that you snore a little?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, the insinuation that this monster had been watching her sleep tensing her muscles. Her heart was loud in her ears, the adrenaline pumping through her body.</p><p>The woman's laughter was like a hum in the back of her throat as she got close enough to pass her. “Don't worry. It was cute.”</p><p>With a mere few feet between them, Agatha snapped, springing into action. Her fingers pumped the mechanism at her wrist, a stake finding itself sturdy against her palm as she flung herself towards the woman. Agatha pushed the woman against the alley wall, the sharp end of the stake pressed hard against her chest. She only hesitated because she wanted to savour the kill, to look the woman in the eye. That’s what she told herself as she looked into the woman’s face, breath heavy as her own weight held her against the wall.</p><p>A peel of laughter rang out in the darkness, the woman lolling her head back. “Oh really? Is this how you repay me for saving your life and not killing you while you slept?”</p><p>“I-” Agatha halted a moment before regaining her resolve and shoving her arm hard against the pinned woman. “You didn't save my life, you endangered it in the first place. You're a scourge on this earth and we deserve to be rid of you.” She couldn't help the waver of her voice, repeating something that had been funneled into her psyche from a young age.</p><p>The woman’s voice was no louder than a whisper, her hand creeping up to wrap around the one holding the stake to her chest. “Then why haven't you killed me?”</p><p>Agatha let out a tiny gasp as her eyes locked with the woman’s, in the darkness they were like pools of pitch. She felt the hand on hers pressing down, the tip of wood cutting into unblemished skin. Her gaze dropped to the woman’s chest, eyes watching the trail of blood as it rolled between her breasts and disappeared beneath her corset.</p><p>“All you have to do is push a little harder.” The woman's hand snaked its way up Agatha’s collarbone to rest against her neck, but she made no move to end their deadly embrace. She could have choked the life out of her in that moment, but instead Agatha felt a gentle caress against her jaw. She couldn't help but lean into the touch, her fingers tightening against the stake. “You're so close, Agatha. Just a little further and you'll pierce my heart.”</p><p>Agatha didn't know why her hand wouldn't move. She had the woman at her mercy, a few more millimeters and she would be nothing but dust. The woman’s hand was helping, not hindering her in any way, so why could she not finish the job? Out of sheer frustration, Agatha unclenched her fingers, the sound of wood on stone echoing through the silence as the stake rattled away from them. A breath she hadn't realized she was holding escaped from her chest as she felt a thumb swipe at a tear she hadn't realized had fallen.</p><p>Becoming hyper aware of their bodies pressed together, Agatha pinning the woman with her own weight, she shifted to push herself away. However, a hand at her waist stopped her and Agatha looked up into the woman's face, finding a look there like she was trying to make sense of something. Agatha's gaze dropped to the woman’s lips for a split second, resisting an unbidden urge to taste them, before returning to her eyes.</p><p>“Are you going to kill me now?” Agatha's voice was quiet, a shock of fear hitting her system when she realized how vulnerable she was. The hand at her waist was solid, pressing their bodies together and not allowing an escape.</p><p>“No.” The woman continued to stroke her cheek, seemingly analyzing Agatha's reaction. “Are you scared of me?”</p><p>She swallowed again as her pulse spiked, the woman’s fingers tracing their way against her jaw and down her neck. Agatha’s breath was thick, her own hands clinging to the woman’s shoulders, fingers tight against the fabric there. “I don't - I don't know.”</p><p>Their faces were stiflingly close, the woman's nose bumping against Agatha's as they imperceptibly closed whatever distance was left. When their lips met, it was cautious, a curious tasting, like the first sip of an unknown wine. The woman pulled away with a gasp, her eyes wide before slipping from under Agatha's weight. When Agatha turned to chase her, she was gone, the night as quiet as if it had never happened. The silence spilled over Agatha, calming her breath and cooling her heated skin. But nothing could slow the beat of her heart, her fingers raised to her lips.</p>

<p>Agatha lay awake in her bed that night, staring at the ceiling. She needed to sleep, her body was desperate for it, but her brain was buzzing at the edges. With a frustrated groan, she reached over to turn on the gas lamp at her bedside, searching for a glass of water. The lamp cast the room in shadows and Agatha gasped as one of them moved. Her heart hammered in her throat as she watched the shadow grow before the woman stepped out into the light. She pulled her hair down from its arrangement, long tendrils falling to her shoulders as she stalked forward towards the edge of Agatha's bed.</p><p>“Wha- how did you…”</p><p>The woman shook her head as her knee lifted to rest upon the mattress. “I have my ways.” Their eyes stayed locked together as the woman crouched, climbing onto the bed and salaciously crawling across the sheets towards her. Agatha found herself glued to the spot, watching the woman as she moved to hover over her. Her hands reached out reverently to cup Agatha's face. “One taste wasn't enough.”</p><p>Agatha felt the same way and met the woman as she lowered to press their lips together. The woman's fingers skated across Agatha's skin, sending shivers through her body. Gripping at her corset, Agatha began frantically pulling at the ties, desperate to rid them of any and all space between. She whined when the woman moved to help her plight, pulling at her dress and slipping her lithe body from the fabric. Agatha's jaw dropped at the sight of her, skin glowing in the lamp light. Their lips met again in a crash of emotion, Agatha pulling at the woman's body like she needed her to breathe. The rustle of fabric drew her attention to hands lifting her night dress, allowing the woman to yank it over her head before being pressed into her mattress. A hand on her chest, a perfect match to the yellowing bruise there, held her in place as the woman straddled her hips. Lowering herself again, Agatha held her breath as the woman ran her tongue along her jaw and down her neck, tasting her sweat and breathing her in. Agatha's hands explored the woman’s back, her fingers gliding over the dip at the base of her spine. With a more purposeful motion, the flat of her tongue pressing against her throat, the woman pulled away for a moment, like she was asking permission.</p><p>Agatha stared into her eyes. In that moment, she knew what the woman was asking for, and she desired nothing more than to give it to her. “Please.” Her voice was wrecked with want, pulling the woman closer by her hips. With one more kiss against her lips, she watched as the woman's face morphed into something more primal, but no less beautiful. Her mouth opened, her fangs extending out as she shook her hair over her shoulders. Her pulse was loud in her ears, her body screaming with self preservation, but Agatha held tightly to her, pulling the woman in. One hand carefully cradled her head as the woman prepared to take her fill, the other raised above her, braced against the pillow with their fingers interlocked. An indecent moan pushed its way out of her throat the second she felt her skin break against the woman’s teeth, warm blood pooling against the dip of her collarbone.</p><p>Agatha woke with a start. She sat bolt upright, chest heaving as her hand raised to feel at her neck. Catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror, she managed to calm down. There was no wound, no blood. There was no way the woman could enter her home, it was a rule of her kind. It had been a dream, a nightmare, nothing more. As her hand dragged down her neck, her touch sent a tingle towards the base of her spine and she felt a persistent tug between her legs. Curious, she allowed her hand to wander down, pulling at the hem of her dress and slipping underneath. She found her skin slick with want, a gasp escaping her lips as her fingers teased herself. Quickly retreating, Agatha jumped out of the bed, feet hitting the cool wood floor. She looked down at her mussed bed, recalling the dream once more before shaking her head to dismiss it.</p><p>The sun streamed through her window, birds chirping their morning song, and the sound of the doorbell rang out from below. It was time to begin her day. No more time for thinking about it. No more time for trying to figure out why she couldn't kill the vampire last night. No more time for wondering why a simple kiss had made her feel more alive than she'd ever felt before. Definitely no more time for dreaming about things she had no business dreaming about.</p><p>Agatha stared at the dress hanging on her closet door, much prettier than her typical garb. Today was a day for high society and keeping up appearances. She'd send in her report by messenger, the same story of an uneventful night, and check in for a new assignment tomorrow. Agatha hated balls, she'd much rather be out on the streets, weathering the cold and the dirt, but she knew it was important to keep up with the season. At least she didn't have to worry about unwanted attention from men anymore. She was far too old to pique their interest, especially without her mother there trying to sell her off. One good thing about being born into a family of legendary vampire hunters was that it meant her mother was rarely home. Evanora was usually off on council business, which suited Agatha just fine. It meant she was left to her own devices.</p><p>“If there's one thing I need at these things it's a fucking drink.” A familiar voice knocked Agatha from her thoughts and she looked up to see Alice scooping punch from the ornate bowl beside her. “My mother keeps introducing me to foreign dignitaries, like they'd want anything to do with me.”</p><p>Agatha felt sympathetic towards the woman, born of similar circumstances. “Here's to Evanora being out of town.” She raised her glass in a toast before downing her own drink.</p><p>“Lucky. Lorna never leaves. You know she made Lilia pair me up with Jen because she's worried I'll get hurt? Like you haven't been off on your own for almost a decade.”</p><p>“At least your mother cares about your safety, mine only cares about results.” Agatha sighed, refilling her glass before clinking it against Alice’s. “Nice one, by the way. I guess I didn't congratulate you guys.”</p><p>“Thanks. Don't worry about it. I don't think I spoke to you for a week after your last one, not that you'd have noticed. Our mothers really have done a number on us.”</p><p>Agatha winced at the thought. She and Alice had been pitted against each other since they were children, the competitiveness something their parents rewarded rather than dissuaded. At least Alice was better at making friends with the others; all Agatha did was push everyone away. She considered for a split second about confiding in the woman, but quickly shook the notion away, a pit of guilt forming in her stomach.</p><p>“Oh god, she's found another. You haven't seen me.” Alice quickly grabbed a sandwich and darted away from the refreshments, leaving Agatha on her own again.</p><p>As she contemplated the pastries laid out in front of her, she also considered leaving early. She'd made her appearance and nobody was likely to miss her at this point. Just one more treat and she'd be on her way, but as she reached out for a macaron, somebody called out her name.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness! There you are!” Lady Hart, the host of the event, was scurrying across the room towards her. “I want to introduce you to someone.” Agatha was so busy trying to figure out if it was too late to run away, that she hadn't noticed the shadow Lady Hart was toting behind her. When she finally saw who it was, a gasp was punched out of her chest.</p><p>“Agatha, dear. This is Lady Vidal.”</p><p>The woman stood before her, bottle green gown cut low on her shoulders, smiling at her in a room full of people. She extended her hand towards Agatha, eyes flashing before glancing at Lady Hart.</p><p>Clearing her throat, Agatha took her hand, maintaining appearances. “Lady Vidal, is it?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Finally, a name for the woman who tormented her. Lady Hart prattled on about the woman, regaling Agatha with whatever lie she'd come up with to get in with the society crowd. Rio put on a good act. Smiling and nodding along at the right moments, she was the picture of elegance. Agatha's hand clenched around her glass as she watched the woman playfully swat at Lady Hart’s arm after something she said, her laughter sweet and warm like honey. It didn't take long for their host to get pulled away from them, leaving Agatha alone with her. The sounds of the ballroom around them rushed back to her as Rio spoke quietly, leaning around her to take something off the table.</p><p>“How did you sleep, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha snapped, putting her glass down before grabbing Rio’s arm and hauling her away from the ballroom. She did her best not to cause a scene, and Rio seemed to be cooperating, hurrying to keep up rather than being pulled along. Glancing down hallways, Agatha finally found one deserted and opened the first door she saw. She yanked the woman through the door and closed it behind them, the sounds of partygoers disappearing behind the wood.</p><p>Scanning her surroundings, Agatha found them in an empty study, lights dimly glowing along the wall. Rio seemed amused, her heels sounding against the floor as she wandered towards a bookshelf.</p><p>“You know if you wanted to get me alone, you could have just-” Rio gasped as the cold metal of Agatha’s knife hit her throat, her arm wrapping around her to brace across her middle and hold her in place. “Is that silver?”</p><p>Agatha growled into her ear, the woman’s back pressed against her chest. “You've had your fun, it's over.” The woman squirmed against the blade but otherwise didn't fight her, Agatha's hand shaking as she pressed it to her skin.</p><p>“Do it then. What are you waiting for?” Rio tilted her head, the knife slicing into her skin and pulling a hiss of pain from her throat.</p><p>Agatha looked down at where their bodies pressed together, her hand gliding over Rio’s ribs and pulling her closer. The tantalizing skin along her shoulder, glowing in the lamp light, made her mouth water, a bloom of warmth creeping up her neck. She couldn't do it. Her hand was frozen in place, unable or unwilling to plunge the knife deeper. Letting out a frustrated growl, Agatha pushed the woman away from her and instead sank the dagger into the surface of a desk.</p><p>“Fuck!” She turned and pointed at the woman, who was seemingly shocked by the outburst. “What did you do to me?”</p><p>“What did I- ?” Rio looked confused, taking a step towards Agatha with her hands up.</p><p>“You! You're in my head! You used one of your sick tricks and now you're in my head!” Agatha felt insane, out of control in a way she'd never felt before as tears began steaming down her face. “I can't - I can't-” She felt hands against her face before she saw Rio move, gently cradling her head.</p><p>“Agatha, I haven't used any tricks on you.” Her voice was soft, the sound warming Agatha from the inside.</p><p>“Bullshit! You're playing with me. You were in my dreams. You're just playing with your food.”</p><p>“I haven't - wait… you dreamt about me?”</p><p>“Don't pretend you don't know, like that's not why you asked how I slept.” She pulled Rio's hands away and took a few steps back, sinking into a chair with her head in her hands. “If you're going to kill me, just do it.”</p><p>“Agatha, I swear to you, I haven't done anything.” She felt a touch against her leg and looked up into Rio's face, the woman kneeling in front of her. “I haven't used any tricks on you. Making you dream about me isn't something I can do.”</p><p>“Then why… why can't I-” Agatha stared into Rio’s eyes, not black after all but a warm inviting brown.</p><p>“I don't know.” Rio's voice dropped to a whisper as she leaned closer, eyes staring at Agatha's lips. “What did you dream about?”</p><p>It was like they were drawn together by some unseen force, slowly colliding against each other. Agatha’s hands rose to cup Rio’s jaw, deepening their kiss with a soft hum in the back of her throat. Everything around them fell away, her thoughts fuzzy at the edge as she focused instead on other things. The rustling sound of fabric barely registered compared to the weight of Rio's hands gripping her thighs through it. She could feel the flush against her chest, her body warming with every taste of the woman’s mouth. After a particularly languorous stroke of tongues, Agatha heard the smallest whimper that didn't come from her and felt Rio's hands tighten against her. It was enough to tug low in her stomach, the feeling pooling in her lap.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers began slowly exploring the expanse of Rio’s skin that was exposed to her, nails lightly scraping against her collarbones. She was about to move lower, fingertips teasing the edge of fabric, when she suddenly found her hands empty and her lap substantially lighter. Her brain lagging, she looked around confused and found Rio on the far side of the room perusing a book. She opened her mouth to speak when the door of the study opened, the din of the party rolling in with one of the house staff.</p><p>“Ah, there you are Lady Vidal.” Rio looked up from the book innocently, her eyes darting to Agatha for a second before raising an eyebrow at the man. “Lady Hart has requested you join her in the parlour.”</p><p>“Of course. Thank you, for your company Ms. Harkness.” Replacing the book, Rio followed the man from the room, glancing back at Agatha with a sad look. If Agatha wasn't mistaken, the look was full of longing. It was a feeling she was familiar with, something in her chest pulling after the woman, begging to follow her.</p><p>Taking a moment to recompose herself, Agatha soon left to rejoin the party. It only took a few minutes to decide that she didn't want to be here anymore, a group laughing loudly near her setting her teeth on edge. She waited in the foyer for the staff to call her carriage and collect her things, deciding to send Lady Hart a thank you note in the morning to smooth any feathers that may be rustled by her early departure. Leaning against the corner of a doorframe, trying very hard not to impatiently tap her foot, Agatha felt a brush against the inside of her wrist. She turned to chase the feeling but found nobody behind her. Instead, she looked down at the piece of paper in her hand, a page ripped from a book with a note scribbled on it. But her eyes didn't focus on the words right away, distracted by a familiar shade of lipstick in the shape of a kiss.</p>

<p>Agatha’s fingers worried at the piece of paper in her coat pocket. Her thumbs had rubbed against it enough over the course of the evening to soften it to her touch.</p><p>
<em>#7 Azalea Way</em><br/>
<em>At your earliest convenience.</em>
</p><p>She tapped her foot against the corner of the building across the street from the house, trying to be sly about casing it. It seemed normal, the typical home of a high society woman. It was hard to tell in the darkness of the late hour, but Agatha knew that in the daytime it would be bursting with colour, the plants climbing the outside walls overflowing with flowers. Agatha chewed at her bottom lip, watching the windows for any movement. What was she even doing here? In what world was this a good idea?</p><p>If she was wrong about the woman, then this was a trap. She'd be walking towards a slow, humiliating death. If she was right about the woman…</p><p>“God, what would my mother say if she could see me right now?” Agatha muttered under her breath, kicking again at the lowest brick of the building. Evanora would probably disown her if she knew about any of this, let alone if she knew Agatha had come with only her knife in its usual place in her boot, even after changing out of her ballgown. She thought about turning back and going home. It wasn't too late. The paper slid smoothly between her fingers and she pulled it from her pocket. The scrawl was hurried but elegant, the ink swooping against the page. Agatha couldn't help but dart her tongue out to wet her lips as she stared down at the now worn kiss staring back at her, like she could still taste her.</p><p>Turning her back as a carriage rolled down the street, Agatha waited for it to pass before jogging across the cobbled stones towards the front steps. With a pull at her collar, she checked up and down the street before pressing her finger against the doorbell. She could hear its muted chime through the door and stuffed her hands in her coat as she waited. Her heart was in her throat as she bounced on her feet, ready to make a quick getaway. She was about to lose her nerve, taking a step back from the threshold and moving to turn around, when the door opened.</p><p>Rio’s face was framed in the soft light from the candle she held, her hair loose around her shoulders and eyes wide at the sight of her. “You came.”</p><p>Holding the door wide enough, Rio stepped aside for her to slip in. Agatha took a deep breath, trying to reassure herself, before her boots crossed the threshold. Rio gently closed the door behind her and they both stood for a moment taking each other in. She looked more comfortable than Agatha had seen her yet, wearing a simple dress with a robe over top of it.</p><p>“Sorry, I only just got home an hour ago. Lady Hart can be quite demanding of attention.” Rio moved past her and led her down the hallway and into a sitting room. Turning the dial on the wall for the gas lamps, the room was cast in a dim light before she set down and blew out the candle she'd been holding. “Can I offer you a drink? Wine, perhaps? Or, I might have a bottle of sherry somewhere…”</p><p>Agatha stared after the woman as she moved towards what was presumably the liquor cabinet. This all seemed so normal, the house quite similar to her own. Her hand reached out to touch the back of a nearby sofa and she heard a quiet chuckle from across the room.</p><p>“What? Not what you were expecting? Hoping for something more along the lines of an evil lair?” Rio held a bottle of wine towards her with a little shake.</p><p>“Why did you invite me here, Rio?”</p><p>A small breath escaped the woman as she set the bottle down on a side table. Even from where she stood, Agatha could see her pupils dilate at the sound of her name. Rio carefully moved towards her, clearly trying not to make any sudden movements as she closed the distance between them.</p><p>“I feel truly terrible about how today ended. So abrupt… so unsatisfying…”</p><p>Agatha couldn't help as her eyes were drawn down as she walked towards her, the slight shine of her dress making it glow with the movement in the soft light. She swallowed against the lump forming in her throat, her fingers involuntarily reaching out to skim against the fabric of Rio's dress. A single finger lifted her chin and she found herself face to face with the woman.</p><p>“I don't know about you Agatha,” Rio’s voice was soft as she tilted her head, staring at her lips. “but I'm desperate to continue from where we left it.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes were heavy with lust as her gaze returned to Agatha’s, her hands gently sliding against her waist in a way that let her know she could still escape. She'd never felt so wanted before, watching as Rio restrained herself, unable to stop herself from touching but clearly itching for more. She'd also never wanted anyone as much as she wanted Rio. Her own fingers twitched as she tried to withhold herself, only allowing them to brush against her dress. Agatha’s thoughts were waging war inside her mind as Rio’s hands travelled up her sides, each touch sending sparks across her skin. Her logical mind was getting in the way, her years of learning and experience screaming at her to open her eyes. As Rio's hands cradled her face, her thumb reaching out to stroke against her lower lip, Agatha pushed logic aside. Grasping at her waist, she pulled Rio hard against herself and joined their lips together, Rio's arms wrapping around her shoulders.</p><p>They both held each other tightly, as if afraid they'd disappear. Rio's spine hit the back of the sofa and she used it to anchor herself and pull Agatha even closer. The woman threw her head back, allowing her to kiss down the column of her throat, her breath the only sound echoing through the house.</p><p>“Agatha.” Her own name, said like a plea, tugged low in her stomach as she looked back into Rio's eyes. A hand came to caress her cheek before Rio leaned in to speak, her voice hot and heavy in her ear. “Come upstairs.”</p><p>The woman slowly spun them around, pressing an obscene kiss to her lips before pulling herself from Agatha's grasp. With a bite of her lower lip, Rio began backing out of the room, her hands slowly and suggestively removing her robe. Agatha clamped her mouth shut as it began to water, swallowing thickly when Rio turned to continue down the hall. Without any hesitation, Agatha followed. By the time she reached the foot of the stairs, a shiny pool of silk had been discarded on the steps. With an involuntary whine, Agatha pulled off her coat, draped it over the banister, and took the stairs two at a time, following the warm glow coming from a room down the hall.</p><p>Agatha stood in the doorway of a bedroom, heavy curtains drawn over the windows and a massive four-poster dominating the room. Rio flitted around, lighting candles at an inhuman speed before stopping to make eye contact as she blew out the match. As the light trails of smoke swirled around her unobscured form, Agatha drank in the sight of the woman before her. She was utter perfection, just as in her dream, her lithe unclad body stalking towards her.</p><p>“May I?” Rio's fingers toyed with the ties on Agatha's shirt, eyes expectant as she waited for her to nod. With the go ahead, Rio leaned up to kiss her again while her hands gracefully worked her clothes away from her skin. Agatha ran her own hands over the woman's arms, her skin warm and soft under her palms. When her clothes began hitting the floor, she pulled Rio closer, desperate for the feeling of their bodies pressed together. She couldn't help but gasp at the feeling of Rio's fingers pulling at the waistband of her trousers.</p><p>“Is this okay?” Rio’s face was so earnest as she pulled back to check, squeezing Agatha's heart.</p><p>“Fuck, yes.” She surged forward to continue kissing her, not caring about anything else. Not caring about the sound of her knife skittering across the floor as she kicked off her boots and began walking them towards the bed. With a gentle push, Rio fell against the mattress with a grin, watching while Agatha finished removing her trousers. Baring herself to someone for the first time in a long time, Agatha paused for a moment, the shyness creeping in and the blush spreading across her chest.</p><p>Rio's pupils were blown wide as she looked her up and down, tongue slowly licking her lips. “Holy shit, Agatha. You're so fucking beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha felt her blush deepen and shook her head. “Not as beautiful as you. You're… fuck you're perfect.”</p><p>Reaching for her hand, Rio pulled her down to the bed, rolling so that she could straddle Agatha's hips. Pinning her hands to the mattress above her head, Rio’s eyes raked down her body, making her squirm a little with the intensity of her gaze. “You're perfect to me. More beautiful than anything I've ever seen.” Rio punctuated her words with a filthy kiss before her mouth continued down to worship her body.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught with every brush of Rio's lips against her skin. Her hands were freed as Rio moved lower, her fingers tangling in the sheets as she watched her lick a stripe along her breast before pulling the hardening bud of a nipple between her lips. She couldn't help but arch her back at the feeling, a whine escaping her throat.</p><p>“Mmm, you make such pretty noises, Agatha.” Rio sat up, rolling her hips to grind against Agatha's with a deep hum, her hands lifting to run through her own hair. Agatha was transfixed, hands sliding up the woman's thighs and urging her to move again, watching her reaction. Rio had a faint blush creeping over her face as their eyes locked, matching Agatha's slightly agape expression before biting her lip and rolling her hips again, this time with more purpose.</p><p>“Shiiiit. Rio, I need you to kiss me right fucking now.” Agatha’s hands tightened against her thighs and Rio wasted no time obliging her. Their tongues slid together with a satisfied groan, Agatha gripping against Rio's skin. Shifting to slot their legs together, Rio gasped as her thigh landed against Agatha, already slick with desire.</p><p>“You really know how to make a girl feel wanted.” Rio's voice sounded wrecked, impossibly turned on as she lowered her hand to let her fingers feel how wet Agatha was for her.</p><p>“I do. I want you. I need you Rio. Please.” Agatha had never begged before, but having Rio’s fingers play so dangerously close sent her over the edge.</p><p>“Since you asked so nicely.”</p><p>Agatha threw her head back at the first purposeful stroke against her clit, not holding back the moan that erupted from her. If Rio wanted her pretty noises, she was going to get them. Immediately having the desired effect, Agatha watched as Rio tried to regain focus, her breath shaky and her hips involuntarily grinding against Agatha's thigh.</p><p>“I- shit I might come just from listening to you.”</p><p>“We can save that experiment for another time.” Agatha slid her hand between her thigh and Rio, the woman whimpering as her fingers explored her folds. “Come with me instead.”</p><p>Rio kissed her hard and both women slipped two fingers inside the other, gasping into each other's mouths. Every roll of Rio's hips, grinding against Agatha's hand, thrust their fingers deeper, palms rubbing against their clits. The two clutched each other in a tight embrace, Agatha’s hips rising to meet Rio's movements. They swallowed every moan as their mouths came together, before it became too hard to breathe and they had to bury them in each other's necks, bodies rocking in tandem.</p><p>With a well timed crook of Rio’s fingers, Agatha felt her body tighten, a wave of pleasure cresting and ready to crash over her. “Rio I- ah…ahh Ri-oooo!” Muscles clenching around Rio's fingers, Agatha's nails dug into her shoulder as she rode the wave. She felt Rio follow a few seconds after her, a breathy cry against her neck. “Agatha!”</p>

<p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Jumping as she was jerked out of her thoughts, Agatha quickly managed to stop herself from knocking over a table lamp. Everyone was staring at her as she looked up at Lilia’s expectant face.</p><p>“Are we boring you?” Her tone was that of a disappointed teacher and Agatha couldn't help but feel suitably chastised.</p><p>“No. Sorry. I'm just tired.” Standing from the table, Agatha went to make a cup of tea while the briefing continued. In all honesty, she didn't give two shits about the briefing. The hunter who was giving it, talking about an uptick in suspicious activity in the merchant quarter, was an idiot on a good day. God forbid her mind had found better employment reminiscing about the last twelve hours.</p><p>Rio lightly drew designs into the skin of her shoulder, her cheek nestled against her chest. Their bodies were warm although they lay uncovered, limbs tangled together. Running her fingers through silky smooth hair, Agatha couldn't help but hum at how content she felt.</p><p>“Penny for your thoughts.” Rio's voice was quiet as she shifted to look up at her.</p><p>Agatha couldn't help the niggle at the back of her brain, a fear that she wasn't able to let go. “Do you promise?”</p><p>“Promise what?” Rio furrowed her brow in confusion.</p><p>Agatha sighed with a hint of sadness, tenderly pushing a lock of hair behind Rio’s ear. “That you haven't tricked me.”</p><p>“Why are you so set on that?” A shadow crossed over Rio’s eyes and she pushed herself up with a huff, moving to her closet in search of a robe.</p><p>“Because I don’t feel like this!” Agatha’s voice rose as she sat up, an unhinged laugh catching in her throat. “I've never felt like this. This want, this desire. Not with anyone, let alone someone… like you. And it all just feels so, so-”</p><p>“Unnatural?” Rio pulled a thin robe tightly around herself as she turned back to face her, a defensive bite to her stance. Even like this, clearly irritated, her attention took Agatha's breath away.</p><p>“Unreal.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders fell a little as she began to understand. “You're scared that I'm using you, playing with you.”</p><p>“I'm scared that you'll turn it off and I'll lose this feeling forever.” Agatha looked down at her hands, her fingers rolling the sheet fabric between them where she sat on the bed.</p><p>“Oh, Agatha.” Rio’s hand fell against her cheek as she appeared in front of her, pulling her gaze back to the woman. “I feel it too. With every corner of my soul. I promise, I don't have the power to change the way you feel.” Her thumb wiped at the wetness that had collected at the corner of Agatha’s eyes before leaning forward to press a comforting kiss to her lips. “I don't understand it either, the way I'm drawn to you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, knowing the feeling well. Rio's hands moved along her body like she couldn't stop touching her, setting her skin on fire. Pulling her to sit in her lap, Agatha leaned forward to taste Rio's neck, sucking a kiss against the beating of her heart. “It's like… there's a thirst inside me that I didn't know was there. Like you saved me from the desert.” Her mouth continued down Rio’s neck and down her chest, taking a deep breath of her through her nose.</p><p>Pushing Agatha's hair back, clearly enjoying the attention of her mouth, Rio rolled her hips against her, biting back a sigh. “Yes, exactly! I feel like I could drown in you and never have enough.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her face to look up at Rio, a frown tugging at her lips. “See? Unreal.”</p><p>With a shake of her head, Rio cradled Agatha's head in her hands before gently placing their foreheads together. Her eyes were so warm in this moment, catching the flickering of candle light, that Agatha felt the warmth in her heart when she whispered. “Real.”</p><p>“Hey, you okay?”</p><p>Agatha jumped again as Wanda appeared by her side, leaning to get in her line of sight.</p><p>“Shit, yeah.” She put her cooling tea down on the table she'd been standing near, looking back towards the front of the room.</p><p>“Don't worry, it's over. You didn't miss much.” Sure enough, everyone was packing up their things and moving to leave. A few hunters stayed to mingle in smaller groups, no doubt discussing assignments, and Lilia was patting the presenter on the back.</p><p>“Let me guess. Attacks are up in the merchant quarter, we think it's something to do with the season. Lots of boats coming in with new faces.”</p><p>Wanda snorted out a chuckle. “Pretty much. Same old shit.” She lowered her voice, eyes glancing to make sure they weren't being overheard. “You sure you're okay though? You've been, I don't know, on edge or something all day.”</p><p>Damn this woman and her observation skills. She always knew when something was slightly off with her. “I'm fine Wanda. I just haven't been sleeping well, and you know how much I hate these kinds of days.”</p><p>The other woman pursed her lips as she contemplated Agatha for a moment before nodding. “Sure. Just let me know if you need anything. I can always send one of the boys to help take something off your plate.”</p><p>“I'll keep that in mind. Maybe I'll see if I can leave early. Get some rest before tonight.”</p><p>“Sounds like a good idea.” With a smile and a pat on her arm, Wanda left her. Agatha watched her walk out of the room and join Billy at a worktop while he excitedly explained what he was working on, before turning towards Lilia.</p><p>“Go home Agatha.”</p><p>The old crone always could read minds. “I didn't even say anything yet!”</p><p>“You were falling asleep during the presentation, your mind is clearly elsewhere. I need you in top shape tonight.” Lilia busied herself cleaning up the room as she spoke.</p><p>“Why? What's tonight?” Agatha’s interest was piqued, leaning forward over the table.</p><p>“We've had reports of an aggressive vampire in the eastern entertainment district. I'm sending a few of you out to patrol tonight. You'll need your wits about you.”</p><p>How was Agatha supposed to sleep with the promise of a hunt on the horizon? She tried her best, tossing and turning in her bed for an hour with no sign of slipping into unconsciousness. It was hopeless, the anticipation spiking her adrenaline. Instead, she set to work on preparing. Laying her tools out on her writing desk, she checked the sharpness of her stakes and took inventory of her other weapons. Shit. Her fingers paused at a gap in her kit and the memory of metal skittering across wood flashed in her mind. Her silver dagger was likely somewhere under Rio's bed.</p><p>It was as good an excuse as any to knock on her door again. Agatha grinned as her plans for the night came together. Killing that vampire tonight would be a walk in the park, and then she'd visit Rio to celebrate. She was practically salivating at the promise of a fantastic night.</p>

<p>Agatha kept to the shadow's, avoiding groups traipsing through the night coming and going from their various events. The entertainment district was always bustling at this time, the peel of laughter and boisterous singing usually filling the air. She dodged out of sight of another group exiting a club, the women hanging off of each other with their men protective behind them. They would probably be okay. She knew what he would be looking for. A straggler from a group too far gone to notice, or someone completely off on their own. Reports made him out to be aggressive, so maybe he was feeling greedy. Spotting two young girls tumble out of a back alley, Agatha kept her distance but began following them. If at the very least, she'd escort them to a more crowded area and double back, a little grin forming on her face as she watched one girl kiss the other’s cheek.</p><p>There were four of them out in the neighbourhood tonight. Agatha and Alice had their own area, covering a few blocks in each direction, and Jen had been paired with a newer girl who's name Agatha hadn't bothered to learn. Knowing that they were working as a unit tonight, Agatha had her senses on overdrive, listening for whistle signals from her cohorts in case they needed help. She paused, watching the two girls make it to a well lit busy street, before turning to wander back.</p><p>On a different night, she might not have heard it, but tonight her senses were on edge, every little sound loud in her ears. The scuff of shoes on stone and a tiny groan whispered from the darkness of the alley beside her. Agatha's fingers tightened against the stake in her palm, taking a quiet breath before inching into the gloom. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness, the shapes of two people became clear. A man and a woman were caught in an intimate embrace. Towering over her, the man had her pressed against the brick wall, but it was too dark for Agatha to make out exactly what was happening. Could it just be two lovers who couldn't wait to get home, a private moment in the dark? A pit in Agatha's stomach told her that her instincts were sound, there was something wrong here.</p><p>Backing out of the alley, Agatha pulled a small torch from her coat pocket and lifted herself to light it off of a street lamp. With one last bracing breath, she spun back into the alley and launched the torch towards the couple. It clattered against the stone ground, casting a low light as Agatha stormed towards them.</p><p>“Let her go!” Her voice was stern, gripping her stake at her side.</p><p>As she got closer to the end of the alley, the soft glow of the torch made it clear that Agatha had made a mistake. The couple had pushed off of the wall and the towering man crumpled to the ground with a sickening thud.</p><p>Free from the man’s shadow, the true predator emerged, eyes wild and features furious. Agatha felt like she couldn't breathe as she watched the blood drip from her face, her voice no more than a whisper.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>The woman’s face softened at the sight of her, her usual self but for the crimson stain against her lips. “Agatha?” She moved towards her but stopped when Agatha stepped back, stake raised in defense. “Agatha, I won't hurt you.”</p><p>“You…” Agatha stared at the unmoving man on the ground, clearly dead, reduced to nothing more than a pile of limbs. “How could I be so stupid?”</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio took another step towards her, hands raised.</p><p>“No!” Agatha felt insane as all of the reality of her situation crashed over her. She knew Rio was a vampire, she'd just been so distracted by everything else that she'd pushed aside what that really meant. She was a killer, a monster. Was Rio the vampire that she'd been sent to kill tonight? The vampire dropping bodies like it was a game? In the silence, Rio tried moving towards her again, this time needing to step over the body on the ground to do so. Agatha couldn't help the unhinged bark of laughter that burst from her chest at the air of casualness around the woman.</p><p>“I swear to God, Rio! Stay where you fucking are!” She couldn't miss the look of hurt that crossed Rio's face at her words. Was that just a game too? The light in the alley began to dim as the torch burned out. When the darkness fell, Agatha blinked and Rio was standing in front of her. The hand against her wrist, keeping her weapon at bay, was firm but gentle as her other hand came up to touch Agatha's cheek.</p><p>“Agatha… I promised.” It was like she had read her mind and knew that Agatha was questioning their connection again. She twisted her face from Rio’s touch, fingers still tightening against wood. How did she know she wasn't lying?</p><p>Three short blasts of a high pitched whistle followed by one long one sounded about three blocks away, pulling Agatha's attention from the woman.</p><p><em>Quarry sighted and lost. Safe</em>.</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, eyes snapping back to Rio. It wasn't her. There was another vampire hunting tonight.</p><p>“What's wrong?” Rio looked concerned and was searching her face for answers.</p><p>Agatha shook her head and pushed the woman away from her, turning to exit the alley. “You need to leave. It's not safe for you here. We’re hunting.” She pulled her whistle from around her neck and blew one long blast on it as she found herself on the lit street, leaving Rio behind her.</p><p>“Agatha, wait!” The sound of heels clipped behind her, but Agatha didn't stop, shoving her hands in her coat as she walked. “I know you're upset, but just give me a chance! I'm not the monster that you think I am!”</p><p>Agatha spun around sharply at her words, her voice a hushed yell. “How can you even say that to me right now? You’re still covered in his blood!”</p><p>Rio raised her hand to her lips and was shocked to find her words true, pulling a handkerchief from the pockets of her dress and quickly wiping away the blood. With another shake of her head, Agatha turned and continued walking. She needed to move, to work. The longer she stood there, the more she could feel her heart breaking. She'd loop back around and look for Alice, assuming that the signal had been called by her. She didn't get much farther before she was pulled by the sleeve of her coat into the darkness of another alley.</p><p>“Jesus, Rio, would you just fuck off?” The words came out harsh, pulling her arm from the woman’s grasp. “Don't you get it? I can't even look at you!”</p><p>“You won't even let me explain?” Rio had tears in her eyes, tears that Agatha ignored.</p><p>“Explain what? All of the reasons that I'm an idiot for letting myself forget what you are? I went against everything that I believe in. For what? You're still just a killer!”</p><p>“That man I killed? That man you're so fucking worried about? He's killed two women just this month! He had his eyes on two more when I put a stop to him. But sure Agatha, I'm the fucking monster.” A tear escaped, falling down her cheek as she shook her head, and Agatha's hand twitched at the need to wipe it from her face. “I can't stop being this any more than you can stop breathing. If that makes me the bad guy, then I guess we’ve both been foolish. Good night, Agatha.”</p><p>Her hand reached out before she could even think, stopping Rio as she moved to leave. Eyes locking together, the world stopped moving and the air grew thick between them. The moment felt like an eternity before they crashed together. The metallic taste of Rio’s lips stung the back of Agatha's throat, the feeling drawing her closer instead of putting her off. Rio's back hit the brick as she wrapped her arms around Agatha's shoulders, a sharp whine drawn out by the impact.</p><p>Agatha felt frenzied, her hands grasping at the folds of Rio's dress as they pressed against each other. She needed more, to be closer. Grasping at her thigh, Agatha hiked up Rio’s leg, slotting herself against the woman and feeling Rio wrap around her hips. Her fingers slipped under the layers of fabric, palm gliding up the soft skin of her leg and feeling it tense as she pressed her closer. Rio’s lips pulled away with a heavy sigh as Agatha's fingers ghosted over her inner thigh, chasing the heat there.</p><p>“Fuck, please Agatha. I need you.” Rio's pupils were blown, her nails desperately scraping at the nape of her neck. “Please.” The word was more than just a plea for her touch. Agatha knew that.</p><p>With a nod, Agatha rubbed her nose against Rio’s, her voice a whisper. “I'm here, Rio. I'm yours.”</p><p>Rio pulled her back to her lips, her kiss slow and full of emotion before she broke away to gasp against Agatha's cheek at the feeling of fingers pressing into her. “Yes!” A sigh pushed through her chest as Agatha ducked her head to kiss her neck, sucking at the skin over her pulse before soothing it with the flat of her tongue. Rio moaned at a well timed crook of her fingers as she easily slipped another digit into her slick opening. It felt like she was playing the most beautiful instrument, coaxing music from her lips with nothing more than her touch. Agatha’s gaze was heavy with lust as she watched Rio’s chest heave, the skin of her breasts spilling over the top of her corset and begging for her to taste. Lowering her head further, Agatha’s teeth grazed against to top of Rio's breast before her tongue lapped against the tender skin there, cursing the fabric that covered what she really wanted.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio’s breathy voice drew her attention back to her, face more flushed than Agatha had ever seen it. “Agatha.”</p><p>Kissing Rio hard, Agatha pumped her fingers with more determination. Rio bit Agatha's lip with a moan when she raised her thumb to rub against her clit, the sharp pain and taste of blood going right to her own flood of pleasure between her legs. The back of Rio's head fell against the wall as she whimpered with every bend of Agatha's fingers, the sound building in her ears as Rio gripped hard to the collar of her coat. The sight of the woman coming undone at her ministrations was almost enough to send Agatha herself over. She felt the moan coming as her lips pressed against the column of Rio’s throat, before the woman raised her hand to cut it off, biting down hard on her knuckles to stop herself from crying out as her body tightened around Agatha's fingers.</p><p>Watching her face as she rode out the wave, Agatha couldn't help but admire Rio’s beauty. Her cheekbones soft and pink with blush as her eyes opened, irises warm like honey. She reached up and gently stroked Agatha's face before pulling her into a kiss. Their lips tenderly brushed against each other, full of words left unsaid for the moment.</p><p>“Harkness?”</p><p>The two women were sharply pulled back into reality as another voice rang out in the darkness. Untangling themselves from each other, they straightened, Agatha placing herself in front of Rio.</p><p>“Oh, shit sorry. Are you okay?” Alice stood in the opening of the alley with her hand resting on the blade at her hip. She'd been peering into the gloom but was now awkwardly averting her gaze.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, glancing over her shoulder as Rio set herself to rights. “I'm okay.”</p><p>“Sorry. I heard your safe call. I looped back around to meet up but heard something in the alley. I thought… sorry.” She cleared her throat and awkwardly nodded at Rio. “Good evening Lady Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha glared daggers at the woman, reaching back to touch Rio and stepping to cover her more. “What's going on with the quarry?”</p><p>Alice’s eyes darted back to Rio, not sure if she should speak in front of an outsider, but Agatha gave her a nod. “He dropped two bodies. A man and a young girl. I caught him over the girl, took a couple slices out of him but he bolted. I'm guessing I scared him off for the night. He’s probably hunkered down to lick his wounds. I was going to check on you and then head towards Jen before turning in my report.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, far too over stimulated to make much sense of what she said. Her head was spinning, her mind racing to think of some sort of excuse for Alice finding her the way she did.</p><p>“You should um… you should escort Lady Vidal home. Make sure she gets there safe. I'll tell Lilia you were taking care of a civilian.” Alice gave her an awkward smile. “You can report in the morning.”</p><p>Snapping her mouth shut at the shock of how accepting Alice was being, Agatha nodded. The paranoia about it could set in later, right now she needed to get Rio out of here. She kept herself between the two women as they slid out of the alley, mouthing a thanks to Alice before leading Rio away.</p><p>They were quiet for most of the walk, Agatha's thumb worrying at her fingers inside her coat pocket. Her other hand was occupied, her and Rio's pinkies interlocked between them, helping ground her. It wasn't until they reached the end of her street that Agatha realized that they'd walked to her house instead. She was supposed to take Rio home, not the other way around.</p><p>“Sorry, Rio. I'll walk you home.”</p><p>Rio giggled, leaning up to peck her lips. “Don't worry. I can get home on my own just fine.”</p><p>Agatha glanced up and down the street before leaning closer. “What if you didn't go home?” She smirked, lifting her finger to her chin. “Co-”</p><p>Rio's hand quickly covered her mouth, stifling her words. “Agatha, don't. Don't invite me inside.” She waited until Agatha nodded before lifting her hand and letting her speak again.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“I just… I want you to feel safe in your home.”</p><p>Agatha cradled Rio's face in her hands, her thumbs stroking across her cheeks. “I do. I feel safe with you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio's hands came up to grip Agatha's, leaning into her touch with a soft smile. “I know just…please, Agatha. For me.”</p><p>“Okay, okay. Even though I want nothing more than to have you in my bed tonight, I'll leave you out in the cold.”</p><p>With a quiet chuckle, Rio kissed her lips again. “Thank you.”</p><p>Opening the door, Agatha stepped over the threshold and paused, turning back to face her. “You really can't come in unless I invite you?”</p><p>Pursing her lips, Rio shook her head, slowly reaching her hand out. The moment her fingers should have crossed the doorframe, it was like they hit a solid wall. Flattening her palm against the invisible barrier, she held it there for a moment before sucking in a hiss of pain. Agatha watched as her skin began to blister and burn and quickly reached out for her hand, stepping back onto the stoop.</p><p>“Okay, okay! Stop!” She gingerly ran her fingertips over the reddened skin, watching as the blisters slowly faded away. “Shit, I didn't realize that's how it worked.”</p><p>“Yeah. I could probably push my way through but I would burn the whole time I was in and be dead before I got to the stairs.”</p><p>Agatha gently pressed her lips to Rio’s freshly healed palm and rested it against her cheek.</p><p>“Go to bed, Agatha. You look so tired.” She reached up to smooth down her hair, cupping her face. “Sleep. Have sweet dreams and rest.”</p><p>“Then I'll dream of you, Rio.” Agatha grinned as she watched the blush creep across her face. “Until I get to see you again.”</p>

<p>“This is bullshit and you know it Lilia!”</p><p>Agatha strode into the meeting room to an argument already in progress, quietly pouring herself a cup of tea and sitting down to enjoy the show.</p><p>“Jennifer, the powers at be have made a decision. They just don't want to stretch our resources thin on a single threat. I've been instructed to keep Agatha and Alice on the entertainment district since they're our strongest hunters.” Lilia looked tired, likely having spent most of the night dealing with instructions from the council.</p><p>Jen scoffed. “Strongest? Don't make me laugh. Are you talking about the hunter who failed to signal when she found a body? Yeah, great. Glad she's on the case.”</p><p>Agatha knew better than to interject to defend herself when it risked toppling her story. Instead, she sat back and played the bratty well behaved role by innocently sipping her tea, which did almost as good of a job at irritating Jen.</p><p>Coming in that morning, Agatha had been surprised that Alice hadn't ratted her out. She hadn't told Lilia about catching her and Rio in the alley, only that Harkness had escorted Lady Vidal to safety. So, Agatha kept the rest of her story simple. She had just run into Lady Vidal leaving an establishment when they discovered the body. The woman was understandably distraught and frightened, and Agatha had thought it best to make sure she got home alright. Calling in the body had slipped her mind as she was distracted by her new ward.</p><p>Taking another sip of her tea, Agatha caught Alice staring at her from across the room and raised an eyebrow. She was clearly thinking about something, slow to put her attention back to the fight, and Agatha didn't like how that sat with her. She didn't like her rival having that kind of information on her, information that could get her into serious trouble with the wrong people.</p><p>“You know that Alice and I are a better team!”</p><p>“Jen, I'm giving you a solo assignment tonight! Are you seriously going to keep fighting me?”</p><p>“Alice is my partner! I don't trust that one to have her back!”</p><p>Jen glared at her and Agatha continued to sit in silence. It was well known that she preferred working alone, never really being a team player. Agatha couldn't help but wonder if Jen was right though. She'd been distracted last night, the appearance of Rio making everyone else fade from her mind. What if Alice had been in danger? Would she have made it in time to help?</p><p>“That's enough.” Lilia's voice was stern as she stood, hands braced against the table. “You're acting like a child. Everyone here is on the same team. There might be an unhealthy level of competition between some of you, but at the end of the day we take care of each other. Now sit down before I change my mind and have you posted up in the workshop tonight.”</p><p>Arms crossed, Jen begrudgingly sat and spent the rest of the meeting glaring daggers at Agatha. Jen was the first to leave when Lilia dismissed them, storming out with an accompanied eye roll from Alice. Agatha wanted to speak to Alice and quickly intervened before she could chase after her, hand on her arm and voice low.</p><p>“Hey, I just wanted to say… thanks I guess. For um, not saying anything.”</p><p>Alice glanced around, hugging her arms around herself and giving her a small nod. “Sure. I uh… didn't want you to get in trouble for something stupid. As far as I know, I just saw you comforting a scared woman.”</p><p>“Right.” Agatha watched Alice’s face, her eyebrows screwed up like something was bothering her. “Alice, we’re… kind of like friends right?”</p><p>“Um… yeah I guess so. It's hard to say no when I've known you since I was four. Why?”</p><p>“I know you saw more than…comforting. Is that okay? With you?” Agatha stuffed her hands in her pockets, not sure why she cared about what Alice thought of her. Maybe she just wanted to make sure she wasn't going to report her to the authorities for indecency.</p><p>“Oh. Shit, yeah. Agatha that's… yeah. I mean I’d be a fucking hypocrite if it wasn't.”</p><p>Agatha couldn't help her mouth falling open in surprise. “You mean… you-” All of a sudden, realization clicked into place. “Oh my god, you're fucking Jen!” She felt like a kid on Christmas, the look on Alice’s face confirming it as she slapped her hands against her shoulders.</p><p>“Jesus Christ Agatha!”</p><p>“No wonder she’s so fucking mad at me. Awe, she's so worried about you.” Alice slapped her hands away when she tried to pinch her cheeks.</p><p>“Would you shut the fuck up? You're so annoying!” She extricated herself from Agatha’s sibling energy and turned to leave the room, flipping her off over her shoulder for good measure.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>“So how long have you been together?”</p><p>Agatha wasn't sure what prompted her to break their silence. Maybe she was bored because the streets weren’t as busy as the night before. Maybe something deep inside pushed the question out because she needed someone to talk to.</p><p>“Why? Are you going to be a prick?” Alice shifted her position next to her, digging herself deeper into her coat for protection against the cold night air.</p><p>“I'm not going to be a prick. I'm just curious.”</p><p>They both looked up at the sound of boots on cobble, watching a messenger boy scurry down the street and disappear around a corner. Sitting here wasn't going to get them anywhere.</p><p>“Come on, let's walk.” Agatha reached a hand out to Alice and pulled her to her feet before beginning to wander down the street.</p><p>“You know Jen and I have been close since she joined up.” Alice’s voice announced the woman joining at her side. “We've only been… acting on it for a few months. What about you? I saw you talking to Lady Vidal at the ball.” It was her turn to tease and Agatha cursed the warmth she felt in her cheeks.</p><p>“It's all… very new. Can I ask you something?” Agatha stuffed her hands deep in her pockets as they walked, avoiding Alice's curious gaze.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“Do you ever feel like you're doing something… wrong? Like the people around you would be disappointed in you, in your choices?” Saying it out loud wasn't any easier than Agatha thought it would be, blinking back tears that threatened to fall.</p><p>“Shit.” Alice breathed out the word like it was heavy on her chest, clearly not expecting the conversation to go this direction. “I mean yeah, sometimes. I think about how much work Lorna’s putting into trying to marry me into a political match, my expectations from my family to deliver an heir, you know.” Agatha knew all too well. “But then Jen smiles at me and everything else melts away. She tells me that she loves me and… well how could that be wrong?”</p><p>Would Alice still say that if she knew the full truth? If she knew that there was more than one illicit aspect to Agatha's relationship? She lifted her sleeve to subtly wipe at a tear that had fallen free, nodding at Alice’s words. “Right… yeah. But what if there's more to it-”</p><p>Alice abruptly stopped, her hand held up as her face screwed up to listen. “Did you hear that?”</p><p>Pausing to listen, Agatha slowly turned in the direction Alice was looking. There it was, muffled crying and the soft scrape of shoes on stone. Looking at each other with a nod, the two women pulled their weapons and ran towards the noise. Agatha rounded the corner, stake in one hand and knife in the other, bursting into the alley ready for a fight. The shadows were dense, her eyes taking a second to adjust before she spotted the girl. She sat in a ball on the ground, back pressed to the wall and knees hugged up to her chest as tears poured from her eyes. Agatha ran to crouch in front of her, pocketing her knife and setting the stake down on the ground to check her over. Blood was slowly oozing from the wound on her neck, drenching her clothes like oil in the darkness. Pulling the scarf from her own neck, Agatha tried to stave off the bleeding, looking over her shoulder to check on her partner.</p><p>Alice was walking back from the other side of the alley, shaking her head. “It's a dead end. He's gone. How is she?”</p><p>“She's alive. For now.” The girl was still sobbing, hyperventilating but Agatha knew there was nothing she could do to calm her right now. She was in shock and they needed to get her to a doctor.</p><p>“Let's get her back to headquarters then.” Alice resheathed the blade at her hip and took a step towards Agatha when a shadow fell from above, knocking her to the ground.</p><p>“Alice!” Agatha quickly took the girl's hand to continue pressing the scarf to her neck and picked up the stake, turning towards the scuffle.</p><p>The vampire, a hulking man easily a foot taller than both of them, had Alice pinned to the wall by her lapels while she tried to push him off her. Easily holding her with one hand, he wrestled a stake from her fingers with a laugh and pointed it towards her chest. “How about a taste of your own medicine?”</p><p>He was toying with her, all grins and chuckles until Alice spat in his face. Agatha watched his features harden and knew she needed to act. Rushing towards them with a shout, she threw her body against the man, using her arm to break between them and shove Alice away. A feral snarl erupted from the body that tumbled with her to the ground and the sound of her stake tumbling across the stone echoed in her ears. She thought the hard impact against the ground was the worst of it, until she felt the weight land on top of her and a blinding streak of pain shot through her middle.</p><p>“You think you're so dangerous, but you're just weak pathetic little girls.” Agatha looked up into his eyes as he growled, fangs bared. He was everything that was supposed to be terrifying, if you went for that kind of thing. She couldn't help the smirk that crossed her lips as she squared herself and leaned up to whisper.</p><p>“I'm not scared of you.”</p><p>With another snarl, the side of Agatha's face was pressed hard against the ground by a strong hand, her neck exposed to lunging fangs. And then there was nothing. The weight on top of her had disappeared. Blowing dust from her mouth, she carefully opened her eyes to see Alice standing over her, stake in one hand and the other offered to help her up. Clasping her hand, Agatha groaned as she was pulled to her feet, the remains of their attacker falling to the ground in an avalanche.</p><p>“That was gross. Thanks.” Agatha brushed off the remaining dust, a loose stake falling from her coat.</p><p>“No worries. You saved me first. You okay?” Alice pointed to a splatter of blood against her ribs and Agatha looked down to check. The stake hadn't been loose. It had been embedded in her side, knocked free when she stood. She ran a hand over the wound and did her best not to wince, her fingers coming away red.</p><p>“Um, yeah. I'm fine. I don't think it's mine.” She gestured towards the girl and pulled her coat tight around herself.</p><p>Alice looked unconvinced but turned back towards the girls anyways. “She's in really bad shape.”</p><p>“You get her back to headquarters. I'll finish cleaning up here.”</p><p>Agatha helped Alice lift the girl to her feet and draped her arm over her shoulders.</p><p>Pausing, Alice looked back at her once more. “Are you sure you're okay?”</p><p>“Yes! Now go! I'll check in later.”</p><p>Agatha waited until Alice was well out of sight before leaning against a stack of crates with a groan. The sharp pain had turned into a dull throb, her adrenaline doing its job. She could go home and patch herself up, no need to make a big deal out of it. Crouching to pick up the stake, a glint in the dark caught Agatha's eyes. A gold pocket watch lay discarded against the stone. Agatha quickly pocketed it and made her way out of the alley.</p><p>She made it a couple of blocks before things started getting hazy. Heat was rising from under her collar, making it difficult to breathe. Her pace slowed as her body began to settle, the pain becoming unbearable. She didn't notice that she wasn't climbing the front stairs to her house, her hand grasping at the railing with each step. The final step sent her to her knees, forehead dripping with sweat from the exertion of getting this far. The sun peaked out from under the horizon, day beginning to break as her bloodied hand rose once more to press against the doorbell. She only wanted one thing before she died, and as the door opened, she was given it.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha collapsed across the threshold, her last vision of Rio’s face swimming in shadows.</p>

<p>Agatha bobbed in and out of consciousness, sounds and sights muffled and confusing.</p><p>
<em>“C’mon Agatha, up you get.”</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<em>“Here, drink this. There's a good girl.”</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<em>“Just close your eyes sweetheart. I'm right here.”</em>
</p><p>And she was. Rio was the only constant each time she resurfaced from the abyss. Her voice, her face, like an angel.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned as she properly awoke, her bones achy and head pounding. Looking around, she tried to make sense of her surroundings and quickly realized she was in Rio’s bedroom. Memories of what happened began flooding in. The fight in the alley, the grueling trek through the streets, falling at Rio’s feet. Her clothes were gone, replaced by a robe wrapped around her. She pulled at the fabric, searching where she knew her wound to be, but instead her fingers skated across unblemished skin. Her side was a little tender, warm to the touch, but otherwise unscathed. A little breath of disbelief puffed from her lips. How long had she been here?</p><p>Swinging her legs out of the bed, her bare feet hit the floor with a little thud. Only wavering a little as she pushed herself up, Agatha made her way to the window, pulling aside the heavy curtain to get a look outside. The sun streamed in through the gap as she looked down at the bustling street below. It was evidently the middle of the day.</p><p>“I would appreciate it if you kept that closed please.” Rio's voice came from the hallway, pausing at the door to the room.</p><p>“Shit.” Agatha quickly moved the curtain back into place, being sure it was secure before wandering back towards the bed. “Sorry, I wasn't thinking.”</p><p>“It's okay.” The woman entered the room carrying a small tray of food and set it down on the nightstand before sitting on the farthest edge of the bed.</p><p>“What happened after I passed out?”</p><p>“You’ve been asleep for roughly eight hours. In and out at the beginning. I'm sorry to say that your shirt and trousers were unsalvageable.” She sounded terse, her words clipped and her hands wound tightly in her lap.</p><p>“Okay but… what happened?” Agatha's hand fell to rest against her side, the place where there should be a bandage not a silk robe.</p><p>“I healed you.” Rio looked down at her hands, voice quiet as she avoided Agatha's gaze.</p><p>“You… how?” The ghost of a memory, a thumb coaxing her mouth open, a cup pressed to her lips. “What did I drink?”</p><p>Rio's face was pinched, her voice the smallest Agatha had ever heard it. “My blood.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart plummeted, her breath coming fast and heavy as panic began to set in. “What… what does that mean?” She jumped up from the bed and ran to the vanity mirror, checking herself in her reflection. “Am I-” She couldn't even get the words out.</p><p>“No, Agatha. You're not a vampire. Believe me, the process isn't quite that simple.”</p><p>“Oh.” Her body immediately relaxed, pulse slowing as Rio reassured her. Lips pursed, she moved towards the bed and wrapped her arms around one of the posts, hugging it as she pondered Rio. “Then why are you acting like someone killed your dog?”</p><p>Rio laughed incredulously and leaped to her feet, rounding on Agatha. “Because I opened my door this morning to you fucking dying on my doorstep! How would you like me to behave?”</p><p>“Okay. Fair point.” Agatha scraped her nail against the wooden post, feeling properly chastised. “I'm sorry. I just kind of ended up here.”</p><p>Rio let out a frustrated groan as she began pacing. “And I can't even actually be mad at you for that because if you hadn't come here you would be dead!” She plopped herself back down on the bed in surrender, her head in her hands as her voice began to waver. “Your pulse was so weak, you'd lost so much blood.”</p><p>Agatha rushed over to kneel at her feet, pulling her hands away and cradling her own face with them, looking up into her wet eyes. “Hey, I'm okay, right? You saved me. I came here because deep down I must have known that I needed you.” She leaned up to press their foreheads together. “I need you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, her words a whisper against her lips. “You scared me, Agatha. I thought I had lost you.”</p><p>“I'm right here. You can't get rid of me that easily. I'm right here.” She punctuated her vow with a kiss, vehemently pressing their lips together.</p><p>Rio reciprocated for a moment, clearly finding some comfort in it, before moving her hands to Agatha's shoulders and firmly pushing her back. “Tell me what happened.”</p><p>With a sigh, Agatha fell back to her haunches and stood up. She wandered over to the tray of food and picked up a little sandwich. “We were out hunting for that same guy. I took a calculated risk to rescue my partner. Apparently I hadn't anticipated taking a stake to the stomach. But it doesn't matter now, because he's dust, so…” She popped the sandwich into her mouth and was instantly hit with how hungry she was.</p><p>“Is Alice okay?”</p><p>“Uh… yeah, Alice was fine. How'd you know it was Alice?” She popped another sandwich, trying to chew this one more.</p><p>“Because you two are the best. If I were your boss, I would send my best after that brute.”</p><p>“The best huh? Is that the word in the vampire circles? Watch out for Agatha Harkness?” She couldn't help but smirk as her bravado put a little smile on Rio's lips.</p><p>“Wow, you're cocky. No wonder he managed to stake you. It's a wonder I haven't had to pull you out of any gutters.”</p><p>“Oh darling.” Agatha slunk towards her, carefully climbing into the woman’s lap and whispering in her ear. “Don't pretend you don't like me cocky.” As she pulled Rio’s earlobe between her teeth, she felt her strong hands slide against her waist and grinned. Agatha bounced a little as she was tossed to the bed, but when she looked up Rio was halfway towards the door.</p><p>“What did I do?” She couldn't help but pout, worried Rio was still mad.</p><p>“You didn't do anything, sweetheart. It's the blood talking.” Agatha furrowed her brow in confusion and Rio let out a resigned sigh before continuing. “Our blood can have a certain… euphoric property when ingested. Now that it's finished healing you, you're starting to feel it. I won't take advantage of you when you're under its influence. I'll come back in a bit with more food.” She turned to leave and Agatha threw herself from the bed, rushing to stop her by grabbing her wrist.</p><p>“Rio, no. This is how I always feel around you.” She raised her hand to gently stroked Rio's cheek before letting her hand fall to grasp at the side of her neck. “I never want to stop touching you, or making you smile, or being close to you.” She carefully pressed their lips together, trying to coax Rio into believing her.</p><p>“You… you really don't feel any different?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, lips pursing. “I feel how I always feel standing in front of the woman that I’m in love with.”</p><p>The realization hit the second the words came tumbling out of her mouth. She was in love with Rio. It didn't matter that she was a vampire, her family’s sworn enemy. Alice's words echoed in her mind. <em>How could that be wrong?</em></p><p>“You love me?” Rio’s eyes were wide, searching her face.</p><p>“I must. It's the only thing that makes sense. I think I knew I was dying and I didn't come because I thought you could save me. All I wanted was you. To be with you in my final moments. I must love you.”</p><p>Rio quietly wrapped her arms around Agatha, holding her tight and pressing her face into the crook of her neck. She could feel the fabric of her robe dampen against Rio’s silent tears, her hands feeling the shake of tiny sobs as she carefully rubbed them along her shoulders.</p><p>“Oh, Agatha. I love you too.” Rio pulled away enough to lift her hands to Agatha's face, affectionately cradling her face.</p><p>“You do?” It was like a weight was lifted from her shoulders. If they both truly loved each other, then nothing else mattered. She felt it all melt away, just like Alice had said, when Rio smiled at her.</p><p>“I do. In all my years, I've never met anyone that makes me feel the way you do. At first I thought I was drawn to you out of mere intrigue, but then you kissed me and it was like nothing I’d ever experienced. And I've fallen more in love with each moment we've shared.”</p><p>Agatha felt her own eyes prick with tears. She didn't think she'd ever considered somebody else falling in love with her. She'd been content with burning her way through life, happy to disregard expectations and barrel forward alone. But now, the woman she held in her arms, who smiled at her softly and gently stroked her cheeks, uncovered a new path for her. A path that she didn't need to walk alone.</p><p>“I don't know what I expected, trusting you, letting you in, but… it certainly wasn't love.” Agatha chuckled at her own words, hardly believing the situation.</p><p>“It took me by surprise too. Is… is it okay?”</p><p>“Okay? Rio, it's perfection.” Agatha laughed and bent a little so she could scoop Rio into her arms. Rio let out a startled squeak as Agatha twirled them around before joining her laughter.</p>

<p>Agatha lightly ran her fingers tips up and down Rio's back, feeling her shiver in a way that had nothing to do with the temperature of the room. She could get used to this, naked bodies pressed together, lounging in bed while they waited for the sun to go down. It was peaceful.</p><p>“Now that we've established where we stand with each other… can I ask you vampire questions?”</p><p>Rio stirred, lifting her head from Agatha's chest just enough to look up at her. “Hmm, I guess so.” She rolled over, propping herself on top of Agatha. Pressing a kiss to her sternum, she crossed her arms over her chest and rested her chin on them. “What do you want to know?”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips as she thought, pushing the hair from Rio’s forehead and letting her fingers card through it. “How long have you been a vampire?”</p><p>With a grin and a click of her tongue and against her teeth, Rio shook her head. “Now, sweetheart, you know better than to ask a lady her age.” When Agatha didn't respond, she sighed and tilted her head. “Long enough. Let me keep a smidgen of mystery.”</p><p>The silence carried a little too long. There was obviously something there that Rio didn't want to discuss right now. Agatha knew she'd find out one day, but she wasn't going to push today. “Well, I guess you're lucky I have a thing for older women.”</p><p>Her quip did its job of breaking the awkwardness, Rio rolling her eyes. “Obnoxious. Next question.”</p><p>Agatha mulled over her thoughts. For a group that focused on hunting vampires, she had to admit that they didn't actually know a lot about their quarry. They didn't make a habit of taking the time to ask questions.</p><p>“So… you're technically dead, right?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I suppose that's one interpretation.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, fingers moving to rest against Rio's neck, feeling the pulse under her skin. “Then why can I feel your heart beating?”</p><p>“I'm no scientist Agatha.” Rio sighed again and sat up in Agatha's lap, straddling her and lifting one of her hands to rest against her heart. “I guess my understanding is that my heart still needs to pump to circulate the blood inside my body, the same way yours does. The difference is that my body absorbs the blood to keep me alive and I need to replace it. Blood for me is sustenance in the same way that food and water and air are for you. But I could be wrong. Maybe it's just magic.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, focused on the steady beat against Rio's chest. What she said made sense. It would explain why she didn't feel any different, still warm and soft. Letting her fingers explore, gliding over Rio's skin, Agatha paused at the supple flesh of her breast before her hand fell to rest against her hip. Agatha swallowed thickly as a thought crossed her mind unbidden, Rio striking from her place above her.</p><p>“How uh… how does one become a vampire?”</p><p>Rio quirked an eyebrow and considered her for a moment. “I have no intention of turning you, Agatha.”</p><p>“No! No. That's not… I don't want to be a vampire. Just… call it morbid curiosity. You said it's not an easy process. Do you like…have to bite someone or…?”</p><p>Squinting her eyes, Rio was clearly suspicious and seeing through Agatha's attempt at nonchalance. “You would have to drink my blood and die with it in your system. It's not as simple as opening your eyes and suddenly you're a vampire. It's days of excruciating pain, like your body is eating away at itself, because it is. And when you finally start feeling like you're not being pulled apart, the hunger sets in.”</p><p>“Oh. Right. That sounds… kind of horrible. I'm sorry.” Agatha felt a pang of sadness knowing that Rio had gone through the experience she described. Unfortunately, it only lasted a moment, another thought occupying her mind. “So… it's not like you biting someone turns them into a vampire then.”</p><p>“No, not at all.”</p><p>“Then why… why have you never bitten me?”</p><p>“Do you want me to bite you?”</p><p>Agatha avoided eye contact but she couldn't stop the blush that rose to her face, biting her lip.</p><p>Rio huffed out a laugh, looking down at her with her mouth open in surprise. “Agatha Harkness! Are you turned on by the thought of me biting you?!”</p><p>Continuing to not look at the woman perched on top of her, Agatha cleared her throat. “The idea might have crossed my mind once or twice. Merely out of intrigue-”</p><p>A gasp escaped Agatha's lips as she felt the strong fingers against her jaw, forcing her to meet Rio’s gaze, the woman running her tongue along the inside of her cheek with a grin. “Tell me what you want, Agatha.”</p><p>“You.” The word was quick to her lips, no hesitation. “I want you, Rio. In every way imaginable.”</p><p>Rio's eyes darkened before she surged forward to lock their lips together. Agatha grabbed her hips, pulling her closer, and could feel what her words had done to the woman. Her arousal slick and warm against her own skin, Rio’s voice came as a whisper against her ear. “You want me to taste you, Agatha?”</p><p>“God, yes. Please!” Agatha squirmed under the woman as her lips traveled down her neck, tongue exploring the taste of her skin. She crossed over her collarbone and paused above her heart, pressing a messy kiss there.</p><p>Sitting up again, just enough to be able to watch Agatha's face, Rio bit her lip as she pressed her fingers against her chest. Agatha’s breath caught in her throat at the stinging pain as Rio took one nail and dug it into her chest, the skin breaking with a surgical precision. The cut was small but deep enough that it took no time at all for the blood to bloom to the surface, beading and rolling towards her sternum. Rio’s pupils were blown wide, taking in Agatha's reaction. Licking her lips, she dipped her head to press the flat of her tongue against Agatha's chest, cleaning the rogue blood from her skin. With a tiny suck at the opening, Rio then ran her tongue against the wound she'd created and pulled away like she had emerged from under water. Agatha watched as the wound slowly closed up and stopped bleeding, Rio's thumb smearing the last bead across her skin before pulling it past her lips to suck clean.</p><p>“Fuck. You are delicious.”</p><p>Agatha could say the same of Rio. Her whole body felt like it was on fire just from watching, her hands twitching with the need to touch every inch of her.</p><p>“Do you want more?” She watched as Rio became a little shy at her question, nodding and eying her neck. “Then take it. I want you to bite me. I trust you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio lowered herself again and Agatha felt her tongue against her pulse before the feeling of teeth. The moan that erupted from her chest was obscene, but Agatha couldn't bring herself to care. The moment Rio’s teeth broke through her skin, a wave of calm, of serenity washed over her. Everything felt warm and fuzzy at the edges as she held on to Rio's body, little whines escaping each time she felt her tongue lap against her skin. After what felt like forever, Rio pulled off her like she was out of breath, chest heaving and a pool of blood slowly spilling from her mouth. Taking in her appearance, Agatha stared up at the woman with reverence. Her fangs and sharper, almost animalistic, features drew her in when they should have made her want to run in the opposite direction. Rio was a predator, a deadly threat, her eyes piercing and Agatha’s own blood shining against her lips. Agatha’s eyes followed her blood as it spilled from Rio’s mouth, a trail running down her neck, her chest. She didn't know what compelled her in that moment as she rose up to lick the trickle of crimson into her mouth, stopping it from cresting over Rio's breast. Her lips sucked at the soft skin, not stopping when it was clean of blood.</p><p>Hands pushed her hair away from her face and Agatha glanced up to see Rio watching her suck kisses against her breast. Her cheeks were flush, a little whimper crossing her lips when Agatha scraped her teeth against her skin. Knowing that it was her blood providing the flush to Rio's body, her blood keeping Rio warm against her fingers, was positively euphoric. Something took over Agatha, some primal possessiveness compelling her towards Rio's bloodstained lips. She pulled her closer as they kissed, the feeling of sharp teeth against her lips and the taste of her own blood only adding to the feeling. Flipping Rio so her back hit the mattress, she felt legs wrap around her and a hum from the woman accompanied a roll of her hips.</p><p>Breaking away from her lips, Agatha began placing nips and kisses along Rio's body, watching as little red marks briefly appeared on her skin before fading away.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Rio pushed herself to her elbows to investigate while Agatha sucked another mark against her hip.</p><p>“See this?” She ran her tongue against the mark before smirking up at her. “That's me. Running through your veins. Each beat of your heart is pumping my blood.” She slid even lower, pressing a kiss to the inside of Rio's thigh.</p><p>“Shit… that's fucking hot.” Rio’s voice broke over her words, her body squirming against Agatha's lips.</p><p>Agatha pulled her hips forward, staring up at the woman from between her legs, feeling her heat against her face. “I know.” With eyes glued to Rio's face, Agatha ran her tongue along Rio's folds. Gripping her headboard, Rio arched her back with a groan, the flat of Agatha's tongue gliding over her clit.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha!”</p><p>Sucking the bundle of nerves between her lips, Agatha was spurred on by a strong grip in her hair as Rio began losing control. Each whine and whimper, every staggered breath had Agatha desperate for her own release. She gripped at Rio’s thighs around her head, her tongue tasting every inch and feeling every quiver against it before teasing at Rio's slick opening. Her tongue, only dipping inside, drew an indecent moan from the woman followed by an involuntary thrust of her hips that pushed her deeper. There was a moment, smothered by her scent and the delectable sounds filling her ears, that Agatha believed she must have died. It wasn't until she had sucked the last scream from Rio’s chest that she came up for air, the woman looking at her like she was a meal. Coaxing her back up her body, Rio engulfed her, tongue licking into her mouth as soon as she was able and arms wrapping tight around her.</p><p>“Fuck, you're incredible. I can't get enough of you.” Rio's hands roamed along Agatha's back, her lips brushing against any piece of skin they could reach. Agatha needed more, grinding her hips against the woman with a heady sigh.</p><p>“Rio, I need you to fuck me. Right now.” Agatha moved Rio's hand against her and began grinding in earnest, desperate for her touch. Rio obliged, pressing her fingers inside and letting Agatha ride against her. It was all too much, but at the same time still not enough. She watched Rio watch her, a look of awe on her face as Agatha's thumb traced her lower lip before brushing over an incisor.</p><p>“What do you want? I'll give you anything.” Rio's voice was hushed, reverent as her eyes searched Agatha's face.</p><p>Agatha shook her hair onto her back, pulling it aside to expose her neck to Rio. Licking her lips, Rio lurched forward to once again sink her teeth into Agatha. The feeling of her skin breaking was enough to send her over the edge. The flood of warmth and calm washed over her again, clashing with the tightness that released with a moan deep from her belly. Agatha’s body turned to goo as she collapsed against Rio, and everything went black.</p><p>That was it. She was dead. Rio had sucked her dry and she didn't even care. She'd never been more at peace, the darkness like a warm bath. But it was over before it had even begun, the sound rushing to her ears as she was pulled into consciousness. Opening her eyes carefully, Agatha found herself cradled against Rio, face resting in the crook of her neck as fingers gently stroked along her back.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio's voice was soft as she realized Agatha had woken. “Are you okay? You passed out. I'm sorry, I should have been more careful. I got too caught up in everything-”</p><p>Agatha raised her hand to rest against Rio's lips with a chuckle and shook her head. “Don't apologize. That was amazing.” She grinned, pressed a kiss to her neck and snuggled closer to Rio with a hum. It took a moment, she felt Rio relax under her, a hand coming up to stroke her hair.</p>

<p>The pocket watch clattered against the table as Agatha tossed it down in front of everyone before slouching into her chair. She was on edge, fingernails to her lips while everyone else congratulated her and Alice. Whatever bliss she had found in Rio’s arms has faded as her day went on, the culprit standing at the front of the room having a hushed conversation with Lilia.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness! Where have you been?”</p><p>Agatha quickly pulled the collar of her coat tighter around her neck as she crossed the threshold into her home, very conscious of the borrowed clothes she was wearing.</p><p>“Mother! You're home. When did you get in?” She peeked at herself in the reflection of a decorative plate near the door, making sure nothing was amiss before joining her mother in the parlour room.</p><p>“Early this morning. You didn't answer my question.” Evanor Harkness directed her attention from the paper she was reading, a perpetual look of contempt on her face whenever she spoke to her daughter.</p><p>“I was just visiting with a friend today. You know, keeping up appearances.” Agatha tried her best to seem casual, resisting the urge to wrap her arms around herself, desperate to escape up to her room.</p><p>“Hmm, very well.” Evanora took a sip from her tea cup before going back to her paper. “I heard you and Lady Wu’s spawn killed a vampire last night.”</p><p>“We did.”</p><p>An arched eyebrow rose, her voice laced with disappointment. “I thought we were past the days of you needing a nanny. You should have been able to take the beast out by yourself. Instead, you've embarrassed me with your sloppy seconds.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, trying to let the words bounce off her. She didn't care what her mother thought. Evanora was a self-absorbed, holier-than-thou, bitch and nothing Agatha did would ever be good enough for her. That didn't stop her from mumbling an excuse. “Lilia set the assignments, I just did as I was told.”</p><p>“Yes, well I'll be having a conversation with Lilia tonight. Go make yourself presentable, I've already called the carriage.”</p><p>Alice moved to sit in the chair next to her with a light tap against her arm. She darted her eyes towards Evanora and raised an eyebrow, silently questioning.</p><p>Keeping her voice to a whisper, Agatha leaned in to talk. “This morning.”</p><p>“Shit. Is that why you’re late? I was worried when I didn't hear from you today.”</p><p>Agatha was surprised by the admission, never suspecting Alice to be worried about her wellbeing. “Uh, no. I was with…” She raised her eyebrows conspiratorially, allowing the other woman to fill in the blank.</p><p>“Ah… right.” Alice grinned, glancing over at her own paramour, who was turning the pocket watch over in her hands.</p><p>“I sent a message to Lilia, letting her know I was safe and that I'd report before sunset. Evanora was a complete surprise.”</p><p>“Lucky us.” Alice grumbled before splitting away from Agatha as the two older women ceased their conversation and turned to the table.</p><p>Lilia looked like a beat dog, something Agatha could sympathize with. “Yes, yes. Alice and Agatha killed our entertainment district vampire last night. Well done.” She cut off the applause that began brewing, plowing on. “But there's still work to be done so let's get on with it.”</p><p>The imposing figure of Evanora behind her kept everyone silent as Lilia began doling out assignments for the night from the paper she held in her hands. As she got lower on her list, only a handful of hunters yet to place, Evanora leaned over her shoulder and clicked her teeth.</p><p>“Hmm. That won't do. Agatha works best on her own.”</p><p>Lilia closed her eyes as she took a calming breath, before glancing at Agatha apologetically. “Alright. Alice, you'll go with Jen then, and Agatha will stay on the west side of the entertainment district. Dismissed.”</p><p>Evanora glided from the room the second that Agatha's assignment was set, having no further business there. Agatha breathed out for what felt like the first time in an hour before looking at Alice.</p><p>“Sorry. I actually thought we worked well together last night.”</p><p>“Yeah, I guess we did. It's okay, Jen will be thrilled to have me back.” Alice stood with a squeeze of Agatha's shoulder and left with the others to get ready.</p><p>Looking up into the eyes of the only person left, Agatha gave Lilia a grimace of a smile. “Sorry. I would have warned you if I hadn't been surprised myself.”</p><p>“No, I'm sorry Agatha. Sorry you and Alice didn't get the praise you deserved.” She picked up the pocket watch from where it had been discarded on the table, turning it over in her hands. “You did good work last night, no matter what you might hear elsewhere.”</p><p>“It doesn't matter. Nothing I do is enough for her. I made peace with that a long time ago. Best I can do is count down the hours before she leaves again. Give that to Alice, she deserves the credit.” She gestured to the watch before turning to leave the room, feeling the older woman's empathetic eyes burrowing into her skull.</p><p>The upside of Evanora butting back into her life was that Agatha had been given a solo assignment. That meant she could do whatever she wanted as long as she stayed in her quadrant. She couldn't help the smirk that grew on her face as she heard an ominous scuffle behind where she sat on some crates in a pub’s back alley.</p><p>“Are you seriously trying to scare me?” She questioned into the quiet night air, met with silence. “You know, a vampire that was actually trying to kill me wouldn't let me hear them first.”</p><p>A blur of shadow skirted across her periphery before lunging at her square on. A terrifying visage of growling fangs and deadly eyes filled her sight before there was a gentle press of lips against hers.</p><p>“Hello, sweetheart.” Rio kissed her again, wrapping her arms around her neck and pulling her close.</p><p>“Mmm, you're so scary.” Agatha’s heart hammered against her chest, but not for the reason that made any sense. Her body just couldn't find it in itself to be scared of the woman, instead she was just excited by her.</p><p>“I’ve missed you.” Rio’s admission made Agatha's heart skip, her hands sliding around the woman’s waist.</p><p>“It's only been a few hours, my love.”</p><p>“A few hours too many. Waiting for the sun to set was a special kind of torture today.” She pulled at the collar of Agatha's shirt, exposing the half healed wound she'd made there earlier that day and pressing her lips against it.</p><p>“Mmm, speaking of special torture… I got home to change and discovered that my mother is in town.” Agatha closed her eyes with a hum at the feeling of Rio's tongue against her skin.</p><p>“Ah, yes. Evanora Harkness. I've heard all about her.” Rio lifted her head to pout at Agatha, pecking her lips. “I'm sorry.”</p><p>“You’ve heard of her? Oh god. Her ego would sky rocket if she knew her name was prolific in the vampire underground.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, carefully fixing Agatha's collar. “Well that's fine, because I've heard about her from my society circles, not from any vampires. Lady Hart keeps threatening to introduce us the next time she's around.”</p><p>“No, you can't.” Agatha quickly sobered, hopping to her feet from atop the crate she was sitting on. “You cannot meet my mother.”</p><p>“Don't worry. It's not like I'm going to tell her anything. I play Lady Vidal very well, thank you.” She looked playfully offended, running her hands along Agatha's neck.</p><p>“No, no, no, you don't understand. She'll sniff you out so fast. If I hadn't already met you in that alley and wasn't just so caught up in you, I would have immediately been suspicious of your appearance. My mother taught me how to read people. There's no way she'd just accept you at face value. She'd dig deeper and you'd be found out. You'd be in so much danger, and I just… I can't…”</p><p>Agatha felt herself beginning to panic. The idea of her mother getting anywhere near Rio made her sick. If there was one happy thing in her life that she refused to let Evanora touch, it was this.</p><p>“Okay, okay. Agatha breathe. Shh, breathe.” Rio wrapped her arms tight around Agatha's shoulders and nuzzled gently against her ear. “I'll do my best to stay away from her. I promise.”</p><p>Her body relaxed against Rio’s, forehead falling to her shoulder and hands slowly rubbing at her back. “Thank you. She's just… so dangerous.”</p><p>“Are you okay? I mean… while she's there? You can stay at mine if you need.”</p><p>“I'm fine. I'm used to it. I'd love to stay with you but she'd be too suspicious of where I was, I wouldn't want to risk it.” Agatha lifted her head and kissed Rio's cheek reassuringly. “It's okay. She's never around for long.”</p><p>Rio's brow was scrunched, clearly not fully believing Agatha's claims, but when Agatha opened her mouth to change the subject she was cut off. Three sharp and shrill whistles sounded nearby, followed by a short pause and three more.</p><p><em>Help</em>.</p><p>“Shit!” Agatha’s eyes went wide as she untangled herself from Rio, reaching into her coat before taking off at a run. “Jen and Alice!”</p>

<p>Agatha's lungs burned as they ran through the streets. She knew where her comrades were supposed to be hunting, it was just a matter of finding the right alley. Stake gripped tightly in her hand, all Agatha could hear was the clips of her boots on the pavement and the blood rushing in her ears. Rio was keeping pace with her when she suddenly turned to look at her, eyes wide.</p><p>“Faster. I smell blood.” She bolted ahead, only slowing to pause at an alley opening, looking over her shoulder for Agatha.</p><p>As Agatha rounded the corner, she wasn't prepared for what she was about to see. The scene was a massacre, blood pooling on the ground where two unmoving bodies were strewn facedown. Agatha's sob of surprise was met by an echoed sob nearby. Stepping deeper into the darkness, eyes adjusting, Agatha could see a familiar figure kneeling on the stone with her back to her. Getting closer Agatha saw the figure desperately clinging to a lifeless body against her chest, sobs wracking through her.</p><p>“Jen?” Agatha's voice, though only a whisper, felt loud in this space, everything around them having stopped.</p><p>“Agatha I - we- we didn't… Alice, she…”</p><p>Heart sinking at the confirmation, Agatha thought she was going to throw up. For all intents and purposes, Alice was the closest thing Agatha had to a friend, a sister even. The tears fell unbidden from her eyes as she stared blankly at Jen’s back. She hadn't thought she'd feel like this, people died everyday. They lost hunters all the time… but not Alice. Not someone she considered her equal. Jen had lost the person she loved, and Agatha just felt empty.</p><p>“My love.” Rio's voice, appearing at her side, tried to pull her back to the world, hand gentle on her shoulder. Agatha just shook her head, palm wiping at her face. “My love,” Her voice was more hurried, desperate for Agatha's attention. “I can still hear her heart beating.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped to Rio with a gasp, golden eyes staring pointedly back at her, asking for permission. Nodding, Agatha jumped into action, rushing forward and placing her hands on Jen’s shoulders.</p><p>“C’mon Jen, you need to let go for a second. Trust me. Trust me!”</p><p>The other woman wailed as she was forced from Alice’s still and blood drenched body, Agatha pinning her arms at her sides with a bear hug and pulling her to her feet.</p><p>“Noooo! I'm not leaving her! I'm not-”</p><p>“We're not leaving her, Jen! We’re not leaving her!”</p><p>Holding Jen to her body was a struggle, the woman fighting against her grip to run back towards her love, but somehow Agatha was able to keep her at bay. She watched as Rio moved past them and crouched at Alice’s limp form. With one more glance back at Agatha, she began rolling up her sleeve and pulled Alice’s head to rest in her lap.</p><p>“What is she-” Jen stopped struggling when she finally noticed Rio and Agatha couldn't help but wonder what she might be thinking as she saw a glimmer of hope in her face. Did she think Rio was a doctor? Agatha kept her grip tight, knowing that Jen was in for a rude awakening.</p><p>Rio raised her wrist to her mouth, cheating away to hide her features as she bit into her own skin. The crimson poured from her veins and she quickly held her wrist to Alice’s mouth, quiet words of encouragement on her lips as she forced the blood into her system.</p><p>Jen’s body went rigid, eyes widening as realization dawned on her. “She's one of them?!” She began fighting anew against Agatha, trying to pull herself free and lunge at Rio.</p><p>“Jen, stop! She's trying to help!”</p><p>Agatha tried to keep her eye on Rio’s progress while holding back her feral comrade, heart sinking when Rio pulled her wrist from Alice's mouth with a harried whisper. “Shit.” Wet eyes looked up at Agatha, a tiny shake of her head. “I'm so sorry. I didn't think…”</p><p>Jen took the opportunity as Agatha's arms loosened a fraction at the news, a scream peeling from her lungs as she threw herself towards Rio, stake gripped in her hand. Reaching for anything she could find, Agatha bent to pick up a scrap of broken lumber and swung with all her might, a sickening crack echoing through the alley before Jen’s body hit the ground.</p><p>Dropping the lumber, Agatha crouched to check she was still breathing, wiping at the tears that had begun to fall. “I'm sorry, Jen.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Alice is dead.”</p><p>Agatha stood in the doorway of Lilia’s office, very aware of the picture she created covered in blood and muck.</p><p>“I took Jen home. She told me what happened. There were two of them, feeding on young girls. The girls are dead. Jen and Alice were outnumbered. Jen set off one of Maximoff’s contraptions, causing them to flee, but not before one tore at Alice's throat. I was too late. She was already dead when I got there. I went back and cleared the scene before coming here.”</p><p>Lilia nodded solemnly, tears falling down her cheeks. “I will inform her family.” She stepped around her desk and pulled Agatha into her arms. “How are you holding up?”</p><p>Agatha’s hands twitched, wanting nothing more than to accept the hug and tell Lilia everything, but she kept them at her sides. “I'm fine.”</p><p>She had to be fine. It was up to her to keep all of them safe now.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The door opened seemingly on its own as Agatha climbed the frontsteps, the early morning sun lighting the street. The second she crossed the threshold, kicking the door closed behind her, she fell into waiting arms. Taking a deep breath against Rio’s neck, Agatha held on for dear life, forcing everything she felt back into its box so it wouldn't overwhelm her.</p><p>“I drew a bath for you, my love.” Rio's voice was quiet, gentle as she squeezed Agatha's shoulders.</p><p>“How are they?”</p><p>“There was more yelling, but Jen's gone quiet for now. I can hear her puttering around, probably looking for a way out.”</p><p>“And Alice?” Agatha pulled back from Rio’s embrace, searching her face.</p><p>“Alice is… still unconscious.” Rio raised her hand to run against Agatha's hair, stopping along her jaw and swiping her thumb over her dirty, tear stained cheek. “Go bathe. Everything will be as you left it when you're done.”</p><p>Agatha didn't have much fight left in her, obeying Rio’s instruction without even a grumble. The bath was the perfect temperature as Agatha ran her fingers over the top of the water before catching herself in the nearby mirror. What a sight.</p><p>Any part of skin that wasn't covered in mud or the ash of cleaned up evidence, was caked in the dried blood of her friend. The sleeves of her coat, her trousers, the toes of her boots, all held the memory of what had happened tonight, and Agatha couldn't get them off fast enough. She'd never scoured herself clean like this before, scrubbing at every inch, desperate to be rid of any reminder. The water had gone cold by the time she'd deemed her job good enough, wrapping a robe around herself and looking back at the mirror. She still felt marked.</p><p>Wandering down the hall, Agatha paused at the door to the room she knew housed her friend, hand poised against the knob. With a careful twist, the door slowly opened and she slid inside the simply decorated bedroom. There she was. Laying still amongst the linen, seemingly peaceful. You'd almost believe she was sleeping.</p><p>“I tried to make her as comfortable as possible, but she's in for a rough few days.” Any other day and Rio's voice might have startled her, but Agatha was far too drained.</p><p>“She's so… still. I didn't expect her to be so still.” Agatha wrapped her arms around herself.</p><p>“Agatha… I'm sorry. I never meant for this to happen.” Rio's voice dropped to a whisper, her eyes on her hands and she quietly wrung them together. “It’s not… I'd never want to force this on someone.”</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha turned, reaching out to stop Rio’s hands before pulling her into an embrace. “I know. You were trying to help her. We’ll get through this. We’ll all get through this.”</p>

<p>If one thing was going well in Agatha’s life, it was the luck of Evanora leaving the same night as the attack. She'd eventually come home to a note left with Ralph.</p><p>
<em>Left on business. Try not to embarrass me.</em>
<br/>
<em>~Lady Evanora Harkness</em>
</p><p>A sense of relief washed over her. Her mother leaving meant that she was free to spend her time at Rio’s, watching over her friend and staying close to the woman she loved. She continued attending patrols in the evening, knowing that Evanora would not allow grief as an excuse if word got back to her, but Lilia gave her easy jobs out of empathy. As the sun crested over the horizon, Agatha would retreat back to Rio's house, always greeted at the door as if by her doting wife.</p><p>Agatha had taken charge of caring for Jen, not able to bear the hurtful things flung Rio’s way.</p><p>“Let me out of this fucking cage, Agatha!!” Jen spat through the bars of the wine cellar in the basement, the most sensible place they could think to keep her for the time being, where the neighbours wouldn't hear her yelling.</p><p>“Soon, Jen. I can't have you running to the council until we can talk some sense into you.”</p><p>“Who's we? You and your bloodsucking whore? I'll fucking kill you! I'll kill you Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha knew better than to engage, letting Jen’s words bounce off her back as she retreated upstairs. Right now, Agatha couldn't blame her for her reaction to everything. A month ago, she would have felt the same way. Once Alice woke up, once Jen could see she was alive, she'd be able to talk to her.</p><p>Once Alice woke up.</p><p>If Jen’s distraught words were enough to pull at Agatha's heartstrings, Alice’s state was flaying her wide open.</p><p>Rio had recounted to her, in much more detail, exactly what it had felt like when she had turned. The immense pain, like she was burning alive, like her bones were breaking, was excruciating. Agatha found it hard to believe, her friend laying as still as could be in the bed, two full days of death under her belt. Yet, Rio assured her, her heart still beat.</p><p>On the third day, Agatha slid through the front door and into open and waiting arms with a contented hum. “How are you, my love.”</p><p>Rio pressed a kiss to the side of Agatha's head. “I'm fine, sweetheart.”</p><p>Pulling away just enough to look at her more closely, Agatha realized Rio looked different than she had ever seen her before. The word popping into her mind. <em>Tired</em>.</p><p>“Are you sure? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?”</p><p>Rio hadn't left the house in the last three days, not daring to leave Alice alone, especially not with a murderous woman in the basement.</p><p>“I'm fine, Agatha.”</p><p>“Don't. You're not fine. You're -” That's when it dawned on Agatha. “You're hungry. Aren't you?”</p><p>A flash of embarrassment in Rio's eyes confirmed her suspicion and Agatha led her into the parlour room. Sitting them down on the sofa, Agatha pulled her hair and collar away from her neck. When Rio looked at her apprehensively, Agatha leaned forward to brush their lips together, speaking quietly and looking right into her eyes. “I want you to, my love.”</p><p>Taking Rio's hand, Agatha raised her palm to her face, leaning into the touch and exposing her neck further to the woman. A soft sigh escaped her lips, eyes fluttering shut as teeth broke through skin and Agatha felt the rush of calmness spill over her. “Take as much as you need, I have more than enough to share.”</p><p>Rio's grip tightened at her words, a satisfied groan against her neck. Agatha raised her own hand, threading her fingers through Rio's hair and gasping at the feel of her tongue along her skin. When Rio pulled back, one final lick along her throat, Agatha nearly whimpered at the loss. She watched as the woman wiped the crimson from her lips, sucking the excess from her fingers, her own tongue darting out to wet her lips at the sight. Agatha launched herself towards Rio, pressing their mouths together, tasting the metallic of her own blood as she climbed into the woman’s lap.</p><p>“Wow, you really like that, hey?” Rio chuckled a little between kisses, her hands gliding along Agatha's legs.</p><p>“Mhm, it’s very hot.” She kissed along Rio's jaw, dropping down her neck and scraping her teeth across the same spot Rio had just bit her. “And it feels so good. However that works, it's the most relaxed I've felt in days.”</p><p>“Only you would call the thing that's meant to stop you from fighting me, relaxing.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, pulling away to look down at the woman under her. “It is relaxing. Because I already feel safe with you. You quiet everything else. I'd rather focus on you than all of the things spiraling around in my mind.”</p><p>Rio looked up at her, eyes sad and mouth pinched. “I know, sweetheart. I'm sorry.”</p><p>“You look better. Do you feel better?” Agatha cradled Rio's face, thumbs running over her newly flushed cheeks.</p><p>“I do. Thank you.”</p><p>“Anytime, my darling.” She leaned down to kiss her slowly, smiling against her lips as she felt the warmth under her fingertips. “I mean it.”</p><p>Nodding, Rio's hands gripped Agatha's hips. “I'll keep that in mind.”</p><p>Agatha wanted nothing more than to continue, to give in to the lust and have her love right here and now, but it didn't feel appropriate. The shadow of their circumstances loomed over the house, a muted, sombre understanding between them.</p><p>“How is she today?” Agatha shifted her weight, moving instead to sit in Rio's lap rather than straddle her.</p><p>“Her heart grows stronger, faster. I suspect it won't be much longer before she wakes.” Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha as she moved, maintaining their intimate embrace.</p><p>“And then what? What's your plan?” The exhaustion of the day began setting in as she rested her head against Rio's shoulder.</p><p>Rio sighed. She'd been avoiding this part of the plan, Agatha could tell, but it was now racing towards them. “She's going to be hungry. That's the first obstacle.”</p><p>“Will you take her hunting?” An immediate shock of fear squeezed at Agatha's chest at the idea of setting Alice loose to kill so soon.</p><p>“I don't know. It depends on… how she is. She might have objections, considering her morals, but she can't afford not to. If she doesn't feed, she'll die.”</p><p>“Can I help? You can give her my blood. Not as a permanent solution, just to give you time to explain, to persuade her.”</p><p>Rio mulled the idea over, her fingers combing through Agatha's hair. “I suppose that's a solution, although the possessive part of me doesn't like the idea of sharing you.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, running a finger under Rio's chin. “Only you get to drink directly from the source, Alice will have to settle for a glass.”</p><p>“Mmm a compromise I can get behind.” She leaned forward to kiss Agatha's lips, and noticed her eyes droop. “You should sleep, my love. Do you want to go upstairs?”</p><p>Shaking her head, Agatha nuzzled closer to her love. “I'm comfortable here. Wake me if you need to.”</p><p>Agatha wasn't sure what time it was when she startled awake. She found herself more horizontal, Rio having adjusted their position on the sofa without her noticing, likely in an attempt to make her more comfortable. Her fingers brushed the hair from Agatha's face as she lifted her head from her chest, blearily looking around.</p><p>“I'm sorry to wake you, my love. I was hoping we had more time.”</p><p>Grumbling slightly, Agatha pushed herself up more to look at the woman. “What's going on?”</p><p>“She'll be awake soon. It's earlier than I expected. I thought we'd have until sunset.” Rio's brows were pinched, the stress evident on her face.</p><p>Carefully extracting herself from the sofa, Agatha went over to rummage in the drinks cart until she came away with what she was looking for. Armed with a glass and a knife, she nudged Rio's legs from the cushion and sat beside her.</p><p>“Talk me through it while we do this.” She handed Rio the glass and quickly sliced the knife over her wrist before either of them could change their mind. Ignoring Rio's sharp intake of breath, Agatha held her now seeping wound against the rim of the glass and watched as the deep red dripped into the bottom.</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha reached out to gently raise Rio's chin, taking her attention away from the blood that was slowly filling the glass. Her eyes were nearly completely black when they flicked up to meet Agatha's. “Tell me what you need.”</p><p>“I need you to be safe.”</p>

<p>If there was one thing that Agatha was not, it was patient. Agatha anxiously tapped the wooden stake against the bannister as she watched the empty hallway at the top of the stairs.</p><p>She and Rio had agreed that she would wait outside until Alice had at least had something to drink. If Rio’d had it her way, Agatha would be standing out on the street in the sunlight, but that was too far for her. Even though Rio assured that Alice wouldn't be a danger to her, Agatha couldn't help but be worried for her love, never wanting to be too far. At least at the foot of the stairs, she was close enough to hear if there was a struggle, but far enough that she'd have forewarning if Alice got past Rio. Plus, it meant she was an extra body to stand between them and Jen in the basement.</p><p>The house felt far too still for Agatha's liking, her heart pounding in her ears as she waited. Maybe Alice was taking it well. Maybe she and Rio were just talking everything through. That optimism went right out the window as a crash of furniture sounded from the second level, Agatha bolting for the stairs and taking them two at a time. As she threw the door of the bedroom open, stake gripped and at the ready, she took stock of the scene.</p><p>A side table must have been thrown at a wall, the pieces of wood and glass from a lamp littering the ground. Rio stood calmly in the middle of the room, back to the door and firmly between Agatha and the woman frantically pacing. Alice's gaze shot up towards her as she stepped into the room, eyes furious and teeth bared in a snarl. Gripping tighter to the stake, Agatha raised her hand and braced herself for an attack. However, at the sight of the weapon, Alice's shoulders fell and she took a step back.</p><p>“Is that what I am to you now?” Agatha's friend wrapped her arms tightly around her middle, fingers clutching at her clothes. “The monster that needs to be put down.”</p><p>Agatha looked at the stake in her hand, tears pricking at her eyes. “No.” She shook her head and looked back at Alice. “So don't make me have to.”</p><p>Alice’s gaze shifted to Rio, her face turning fearful, like she was scared of herself. “I don't know how… what do I- STOP!” She roared at Agatha as she took another step into the room, backing away until her back hit the wall. “It is taking everything in my power to not rip your throat out right now Agatha, you need to stop!”</p><p>Rio raised a hand behind herself, urging Agatha to stay as she took a couple of careful steps towards Alice. “That's because you're starving, and she smells delicious. Believe me, I know.” It wasn't the time for it, but Agatha stored that information away for later. “You need to feed, but we're limited for options at the moment because the sun is still up.”</p><p>Glancing back at Agatha, Alice frantically shook her head. “No, I'm not… I'll kill her. I can't.” Tears were streaming down her face, a waver of panic in her voice.</p><p>“I know. Alice, I know. I'm not asking you to. We came prepared.” Rio gently held the glass full of Agatha's blood between them. “Something to take the edge of while we talk.”</p><p>Glancing at Agatha once more, Alice only hesitated a moment before taking the glass and turning her back to them as she drank. Agatha watched as her friend became marginally less tense. Wandering towards the corner furthest from the door, she set the glass down and perched herself in a lean against the wall with her arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Agatha lowered her arm, a puff of air that she hadn't realized she'd been holding escaping from her lips. She kept her distance, Alice clearly wanting it, and leaned against the doorframe. “What do you remember?”</p><p>Rubbing her eyes, Alice shook her head. “I remember patrolling with Jen. We were ambushed by two of them. I dove to protect Jen and…” Her voice caught in her throat. “I don't know, the rest is kind of… gloopy. Did they do this to me?”</p><p>“No. I did.” Rio looked at Alice apologetically. “You were dying. I tried to help by feeding you my blood, but I was too late. Your heart stopped before it could heal, and my blood in your system made you this.”</p><p>“She saved you, Alice.” Agatha refused to let Rio be the bad guy. At the end of the day, Alice was alive because of her instead of dead in an alley.</p><p>“What about Jen?” Alice’s hand unconsciously rubbed at her neck, the same place that had been torn open a few days ago but was now pristine.</p><p>“Jen is perfectly fine. You did it. You protected her.” Agatha nodded once at her, knowing the thought swirling in her head. If her final moments had been spent saving Rio, she'd want to know that it hadn't been for nothing.</p><p>Alice returned her nod, sniffing as a way to collect herself. “Thank you. At least I didn't fuck that up.”</p><p>Only Alice would see her death as a fuck up. Well, maybe not only Alice. The way they had been conditioned since they were young to be the best, to not make any mistakes, to think of themselves above all others, Agatha wasn't all that surprised. She could hear Evanora’s voice in her head at the thought of the same thing happening to her.</p><p>
<em>“Foolish girl. Only the weak sacrifice themselves for others. She always was an embarrassment.”</em>
</p><p>Agatha could only imagine that the same was going through Alice’s mind, only the voice was that of Lorna Wu.</p><p>“You died protecting somebody you love. I don't think there's any nobler death than that.” Rio's words echoed in Agatha's mind. She'd always been told that love made you vulnerable, and while that may be true, she also knew now that it made you stronger. There wasn't any power on earth that would keep her from protecting Rio if it came down to it, and she knew that Alice felt the same.</p><p>Alice nodded solemnly. “At least she's alive. She'll be able to mourn me and move on with her life.”</p><p>“Yeaaaah… so about that…” Agatha awkwardly scrunched her face when Alice raised an eyebrow at her. “She's kind of in the basement.”</p><p>Alice gasped. “I can hear her moving around! Oh my g-” She choked on her words, her hand flying to cover her mouth and looking at Rio in shock.</p><p>“Yeah, sorry. You can't really say that anymore. You'll get used to it.”</p><p>“Right… okay.” She cleared her throat looking back to Agatha. “Why is my girlfriend in the basement?”</p><p>“We kind of had to lock her up so she wouldn't run off to the council and blab about everything that happened.”</p><p>“You… you kidnapped her?!”</p><p>“I mean, technically.” Agatha shrugged, only feeling a little bad considering some of the insults Jen had hurled her way the past few days. “It's not like we left her there to rot. We’re taking care of her and it was only supposed to be temporary.”</p><p>What happened next happened in a flash.</p><p>Rio abruptly stepped to the side as Alice tried to rush the door, adamantly staying between her and Agatha. When Alice ducked to avoid her reaching arm, she shoved Rio hard in the middle, throwing the woman off balance enough to lose what grip she'd managed on her clothes. Agatha's hand tightened on the stake again, ready to plunge it into her friend’s chest, but she was merely pushed aside as Alice bolted from the room.</p><p>“Shit.” Rio quickly raced after her, leaving Agatha to rush downstairs as fast as she could, unable to keep up with the superhuman speeds.</p><p>“Get away from me!”</p><p>Agatha rounded the corner to Jen brandishing a makeshift stake that she must have made from breaking a crate of wine. Presented with a locked door, it looked like Alice had ripped it off its hinges in desperation, clearly still getting used to her new abilities. Jen was backing deeper into the cellar, her face full of rage and fear.</p><p>“Take one more step and I'll fucking dust you!”</p><p>“Jen, darling, please.” Alice took another slower step forward, her hand outstretched.</p><p>“No! You don't get to call me that! You're not her! You're just a demon wearing her face!” Agatha saw Alice falter at Jen’s words.</p><p>It's not like she could blame Jen for thinking that, for feeling like she'd lost everything. If the roles were reversed, if it had been a month ago, Agatha would have been saying the same thing. It's what they knew to be true, what they had always been told. Vampires are monsters. There was nothing more to it.</p><p>Stepping in between them before either could do something stupid, Agatha held her hands up to create distance between the two women. “Okay, okay. Let's just take a breath for a second here.” She looked at Alice, the hurt evident on her face. “Put yourself in her shoes. Think about how you would have reacted if the roles were reversed.”</p><p>Alice nodded, wiping a stray tear from her cheek. “You're right.”</p><p>“And you.” Agatha rounded on Jen, fully turning her back to Alice in a show of trust. “Can you calm the fuck down for two seconds and use your brain? Not the one the council conditioned, your actual fucking brain.”</p><p>“You're just as bad as them.” Jen spat the words at Agatha, her grip never loosening on her stake.</p><p>“Jen, wake the fuck up! The woman that you love is alive! If she was the monster we always thought they were, she would have ripped my throat out twenty minutes ago! Look at her! Really look at her!”</p><p>Jen's eyes darted over Agatha's face, looking for any sense of deception. Presumably not finding any, Jen leaned slightly to look over Agatha's shoulder, taking in the woman slouched in defeat.</p><p>“Alice?” Jen's voice was barely a whisper.</p><p>“It's still me, darling. It's just me.” Alice nodded, a sad smile on her lips.</p><p>“Okaaaay. I think that's enough fun for right now.” Rio stepped up behind Alice, placing a hand on her shoulder, gently trying to direct her out of the cellar. “The sun's about to set, let's talk more about this in the morning.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, trusting Rio to know what Alice needed right now. “Good idea. Why don't I take Jen on patrol?” She raised an eyebrow at the woman who was no longer cowering in the depths of the cellar, the stake held lower by her side. “As long as I can trust her not to run off.”</p>

<p>“So what have you told Lilia?”</p><p>Jen kicked a rock down the street, the sound of it skipping across stone loud in the still night air. They strolled through Agatha's usual patrol route these days, knowing they were unlikely to find any action.</p><p>“That you've been grieving and needed to recoup. She's been very understanding and I've told her I've been checking up on you.”</p><p>Jen chuckled humourlessly, shaking her head. “And she believed you?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, thinking back to the night she'd strode into her office covered in blood and dirt. “I know we've never exactly been friends…” Years of infighting, snide remarks and their competitive natures had kept most people at arm's length of Agatha, but Jen had always been the most combative of them all. “But if we have one thing in common, it's Alice. Even Lilia can see that.”</p><p>“I bet none of this would have happened if she'd been partnered with you like she was supposed to be.” Jen sighed, stuffing her hands deeper in the coat she'd borrowed from Agatha.</p><p>“Probably not.” She heard the scoff beside her, Jen clearly offended by how quickly she'd agreed. “Alice would never have jumped in front of me to protect me like that. There would have been no chemical contraption to deter the beasts from the fight, and we would have fought until both of us were dead on the pavement. So you're right. This never would have happened.”</p><p>Begrudgingly, Agatha had always known that Jen and Alice were a better team. Where Agatha and Alice were cut from the same cloth, they balanced each other out.</p><p>“I know I've never said it, but you're good at what you do Jen. You and Alice are great together, you need each other.”</p><p>“You're just saying that so that I don't go running off to the council and form a mob against you.” She stopped walking, instead leaning against the wall of a building with her arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>“Maybe you're right. When have I ever said something nice about you? I'm probably just covering my own ass, manipulating you. Or maybe, just maybe I'm trying to bury at least some of the hatchet.” Jen raised a mistrusting eyebrow at her. “Like it or not, we’re all intertwined now. The women that we love are the very same creatures we've spent our whole lives sworn to destroy.”</p><p>“I didn't choose this, Agatha. Alice didn't choose this. We didn't run off on some flight of fancy in some classic Agatha form of rebellion.”</p><p>“What, you think this is all just a big fuck you to the council? To my mother? You think this is some kind of game to me?”</p><p>“Honestly, it sounds like the kind of stunt you'd pull. Anything to be the star of the show.”</p><p>Agatha felt her hand squeeze into a tight fist at her side, compelling herself to keep cool. “Choose your next words carefully, Kale.”</p><p>“It's just like you to drag Alice into your bullshit. Just like the time you guys accidentally set fire to the lab. Lorna punished her for weeks for that stunt, what did you get? A slap on the wrist from Lilia.”</p><p>They'd been sixteen when that happened, Agatha having had a clever idea for a new device and roping Alice in as another tester. Evanora hadn't let her eat for four days afterwards, but her only public punishment was getting chewed out by Lilia in front of everyone. That event had absolutely been her fault, and seeing the way she'd gotten her friend in trouble and the aftermath of it all had been a catalyst for pushing herself away from them.</p><p>“Is that what you think? I dragged her into my bullshit?” Agatha kept her voice steady, wanting nothing more than to scream at the woman in front of her. “You think I wanted to risk the only part of my life that's given me an ounce of happiness?” She scoffed, eyes blinking back the tears that always seemed to be at the brink of falling lately. “Fine. Next time, we’ll leave you both to die. How about that? Or, I know, let me just hop in my time machine and I'll go back to that alley and stop Rio from saving Alice. Okay? Does that suit you better?”</p><p>“You don't get to act like you're some kind of saviour, Agatha!” Jen's voice had risen to a shout.</p><p>“And you don't get to treat me like a fucking villain!” Her voice echoed through the empty street.</p><p>This wasn't how it was supposed to go. She was supposed to talk to Jen, not fight with her, but old habits died hard it seemed. Agatha took a deep breath and closed her eyes, trying to compose herself.</p><p>“I'm done apologizing for what's happened.” Agatha's voice was back to a more acceptable level, conscious of drawing attention to themselves. “We’re in it now. Either make peace with it or don't, but I wouldn't let you or anyone else hurt the people I care about.”</p><p>“Is that meant to be a threat?” Jen stood a little taller, squaring up to her.</p><p>“Only if it needs to be.” She looked over the woman in front of her, the woman struggling with her own thoughts, the inner turmoil clear as day on her face.</p><p>“Jen… open your eyes. Everything we've been told, everything that's been hammered into us all these years… it's not completely true. The council has been pushing their beliefs down our throats and we never questioned, we never considered there were other possibilities.”</p><p>“And why would we? We've seen first hand the kind of horror they’re capable of, the depravity.”</p><p>“Why would we notice those who are just like us? We look for beasts and we find beasts. There are good and bad in all walks of life. How is a vampire killing a girl outside a pub any different than a man doing the same?”</p><p>Jen shook her head, a little laugh growing in her chest. “If your mother could see you now. Agatha Harkness, champion of the noble vampires.”</p><p>“At least I'm big enough to admit that I was wrong.” Agatha felt a chill in her spine at the mention of her mother, a thought that she'd been shoving down deep for a while now.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Jen turned away to continue wandering down the street. “You're a fool in love is what you are.”</p><p>“Aren't we all?” Agatha called after her. “You're not even willing to give her a chance?”</p><p>She watched as Jen paused, her feet stopping with her words, the night silent. Agatha knew this was the final moment. Jen would have to make up her mind. Continue down the path in front of her, carefully curated by those that came before, or veer off the path and jump into the unknown with them. She didn't want to think about what would happen if she chose poorly.</p><p>“I'm not sleeping in that fucking cellar again. I want a bedroom.” Jen didn't turn to look at her before she continued walking nowhere in particular.</p><p>Agatha sped up slightly to draw even with her. “I'm sure we can do something about that.”</p>

<p>“Agatha, do you remember that time we stole Lorna’s hats to use as target practice? The look on her face?” An eruption of laughter burst from Agatha's chest at the memory as she passed Alice the bottle of liquor.</p><p>“Oh my god! When she came home! I don't think I've ever seen Wanda run that fast! Your mother had some serious scary face.” She laughed again as Alice tipped back the bottle.</p><p>“Over shooting arrows at hats? The mothers in this town need to get their priorities right.” Rio shook her head as the bottle was passed to her, Agatha and Alice snickering.</p><p>“They weren't just shooting arrows. They were shooting firey, explodey arrows and were lucky they didn't burn the whole house down.” Jen accepted the bottle with an eyeroll, but there was still an amused smirk on her lips.</p><p>“Okay, buzzkill. The house was perfectly safe. Lady Wu’s collection of fascinators however…” Laughter from the group echoed over the roof of the building they were sitting atop, Agatha blushing slightly at the bemused look Rio gave her.</p><p>“I can't really believe she's done all this.” Alice sobered a little, staring out at the view in front of them. About a hundred floating balls of light glowed against the dark expanse of the city graveyard, a candlelight vigil in progress.</p><p>Lilia had pulled Agatha aside the day before and informed her of Lorna’s desire to honour her daughter’s sacrifice. Although there was no body to bury, she wanted to have it at the family plot, a final send off.</p><p>Jen’s hand fell against Alice's shoulder with a soft squeeze of comfort. While she was doing much better, she was still getting used to being around her like this. “It does seem very beautiful. I'm almost sad to be missing it.”</p><p>Both Jen and Agatha decided against attending the ceremony. Agatha had promised to inform her about it and later that night she'd sent a missive stating that Jen was far too distraught and that she'd keep an eye on her. Evanora would likely think it a waste of her time anyway, so it was better to use work as an excuse for herself to stay away.</p><p>“It's all bullshit anyways. She's just doing it to keep up appearances. If she's mourning anything, it's the loss of her legacy, not me.”</p><p>Alice took another big swing from the bottle and passed it back to Agatha. Staring down at the glass beneath her fingers, thumb rubbing over the paper label, Agatha couldn't help but commiserate. The only way Evanora would do something like this would be because she thought she would lose standing by not doing it. She knew her mother would never mourn her if she died. A hand ran its way along her shoulders and Agatha looked up into warm honey coloured eyes.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio's voice was quiet, only for her.</p><p>“Yeah.” She smiled a little before drinking from the bottle, leaning in closer to the woman beside her. Rio's fingers gently stroked along her neck as they watched the candlelight dance in the darkness.</p><p>“Fuck. I can't watch this anymore.” Alice abruptly swung her legs from the edge and stood up, hands wiping at her eyes. Agatha moved to follow, but Jen’s hand stopped her.</p><p>“I've got it.” She stood and followed Alice from the edge, leaving Agatha and Rio on their own.</p><p>“Can you see all the way from here?” Agatha watched Rio's face as she nodded, her brow furrowing. “What is it?”</p><p>“There's a woman speaking to the crowd now. Older. I believe it's your Lilia.” Rio raised her hand to wipe at her own eyes. “She's upset. A lot of people are upset.”</p><p>Agatha looked over her shoulder at the other women, comforted by the sight of Alice finding solace in Jen's arms. There were only a small handful of people that Agatha genuinely hated that she was lying to every time she saw them. Lilia, the woman who was closer to being her mother than the woman who actually gave birth to her, as well as Wanda and her sons were the only ones that hurt. She'd been avoiding headquarters as much as possible lately so she didn't have to lie to their faces.</p><p>Rio shook her head and stood up from the edge of the roof, clearly affected but whatever she could see down in the graveyard. Agatha quickly followed, knowing that her usual refrain of late was creeping in again.</p><p>“Hey, stop.” She cupped Rio's face between her hands. “None of this is your fault. That wake, or whatever you want to call it, would have happened with or without you. Those tears down there? They aren't yours.”</p><p>“I know. I just… I've never liked funerals. The dead I can deal with, it's the ones left behind…” Agatha could see a sadness in Rio's face, a story behind her eyes. There was still a lot she didn't know about the woman, about her past, but she trusted her to confide when she was ready. Instead, Agatha was determined to make the sadness go away. Turning slightly so that the other women could hear her, Agatha raised her voice.</p><p>“Alright. I think we've mourned someone who isn't dead for long enough. How about we have some fun instead?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, searching Agatha's face with an amused squint of her eyes. “What do you have in mind?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha’s back slammed hard against the brick wall, the air knocked from her lungs. Her heart was racing as the shadow loomed over her, the anticipation exhilarating.</p><p>“Aren't you a tough little thing.” The deep voice was sweet and smooth as honey as a rough hand closed around her jaw. Agatha squirmed against the hold, looking up into dark, dangerous eyes.</p><p>“Please… please, don't.” Her voice sounded pathetic in her ears, just as intended. She let out a whimper as the shadow moved even closer, his face coming into the light.</p><p>Eyes sharp and fangs bared, as he closed in on her neck he inhaled deeply. “I love the smell of fear.”</p><p>“Marcus, don't play with your food.” Another voice quipped from a short distance away and Agatha heard Jen struggling against his grasp, her boots scuffing against the ground.</p><p>“Fine. Take all the fun out of it.” The beast on Agatha, Marcus, sneered at her as he ripped at her collar.</p><p>She couldn't help but smirk at his words, the fear dropping from her face. “Oh, don't worry. It'll still be fun.”</p><p>The look of confusion on his face as she glanced upward was glorious, even though she only saw it for a second. Her face was released from his grasp a moment later as a new shadow fell from the sky, landing on top of him with a snarl.</p><p>“You shouldn't touch what isn't yours.” Rio’s voice was dangerous as she threw the man to the ground. He quickly recovered, squaring up in a crouch. A little further away, his partner had been heartily flung from Jen, hitting the wall of the alley with force.</p><p>Marcus snarled and lunged for Rio, who easily sidestepped him in a blur of speed. When he spun to attack her again, she backhanded him across the face. Agatha grinned as she watched Rio in action. Marcus was nothing more than a game to her, not even able to land a single blow. That's when it dawned on her. Every time Agatha had managed to best Rio, every time she'd held a stake or a knife to her heart, Rio had been exactly where she wanted to be. As a rush of heat rose in her body, Agatha couldn't help but lick her lips, her mouth suddenly bone dry.</p><p>“Honestly, you're embarrassing as a vampire. Best we put you out of your misery.” Rio sidestepped once more, catching Marcus in a headlock and turning to face Agatha. “Don't you think, sweetheart?”</p><p>With a grin, Agatha reached into her jacket and emerged with a stake in her hand. “Probably for the best, my love.”</p><p>Marcus scrambled against Rio’s grip as Agatha stepped closer, his fate becoming clearer. “Please! Don't!”</p><p>Agatha could help but laugh at the roles reversed, a glimpse of the others besting their target over Rio’s shoulder. She mockingly pouted at him, seemingly empathetic. “Mmm, but where would be the fun in that?” With a fancy flip of the wood, Agatha drove the stake into his chest, his final shout lost as his body collapsed in a heap of ash at Rio's feet.</p><p>Her heart was loud in her ears, the high of the kill coursing through her veins. The moment snapped like a tether the second she met Rio’s eyes, and they crashed together. The stake rattled against the stone as it fell from Agatha's hand now gripped in Rio's hair as she licked into her mouth. She let herself be shoved hard against the brick again, but this time the attack was welcome. Rio's lips pulled away from hers and began pressing hard against her throat, a ferality to every touch. Gripping at the folds of her dress, Agatha pulled her closer, head hitting the wall as she gasped at the scrape of her teeth against her skin.</p><p>“Jesus, you two.” Jen’s annoyed voice only just managed to pull Agatha's attention. “We’re going home.”</p><p>“Yeah, some of us aren't voyeurs.” Alice laughed, her arm around Jen’s shoulders as the couple stood very close together. It was good to know that they weren't the only ones affected. They were all the same kind of freaks, turned on by the high of killing.</p><p>Agatha tilted Rio's face up, kissing the pout off of the woman’s lips. “What's the over/under on making it home first?”</p><p>“You better make it worth the wait.”</p>

<p>Agatha laughed as she bounced, her back hitting the mattress of Rio's bed following a rather forceful shove from the woman. Deft fingers worked at loosening her dress while Agatha lifted herself onto her elbows to watch, Rio’s eyes never leaving her face with a predatory grin. It didn't take long for her to climb out of the layers of fabric, making a meal of every move, putting on a show for Agatha that made her mouth water with anticipation.</p><p>They had barely made it through the front door before Rio's hands were all over her and dragging her up the staircase. It didn't matter that their friends were still there with them, shouting about indecency with a lighthearted tone as they made their own way to a room on the main floor, hands entwined. All that mattered was the heat of Rio’s fingers against her skin, her breath in her mouth, as they stumbled their way up the steps. As the bedroom door slammed shut behind them, Agatha's fingers impatiently pulled at the bindings of Rio's dress, resulting in the shove onto the bed.</p><p>Rio's wicked smirk, stepping out of the pool of silk on the floor, had Agatha's heart pounding in her chest. Her eyes raked over flawless skin as the woman prowled towards her, climbing onto the bed and straddling Agatha's hips to hover over her. A push against her chest had Agatha laying back, staring up at someone who looked like she was ready to eat her whole. Agatha knew the feeling, desperate to touch, to taste. Her hands landed against Rio's legs, palms gliding up her smooth thighs before they were ripped from their pleasure, Agatha's arms lifted and pinned over her head with a gasp.</p><p>Leaning low to speak into her ear, Rio’s hand squeezed hard against her wrists. “Not so fast.” Her voice sent a shiver down Agatha's spine, her hips involuntarily lifting to press them closer together. “You made me wait. It's your turn.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to argue. After all, it's not like she didn't also have to wait for them to get home, to resist the urge to touch the entire walk back for fear of losing control. But she quickly snapped it shut again, enjoying the game Rio wanted to play far too much to let it end.</p><p>“Now, be a good girl while I finish undressing you.” She squeezed Agatha’s wrists once more, the unspoken command clear before letting go of her grip.</p><p>Breath heavy, Agatha watched as Rio's fingers carefully undid each button on her shirt and lowered her head to press her lips against each new section of exposed skin as it was revealed. Agatha squirmed against the touch, her hands flexing above her head as she forced them to stay where they were. She closed her eyes, back arching against Rio's mouth with a sigh as her teeth scraped against her stomach. A whimper escaped her throat when she felt Rio on her chest, sucking kisses against her breasts.</p><p>“Sweetheart, open your eyes for me?”</p><p>Agatha did as she was told, biting hard against her lip as she watched Rio run the flat of her tongue against her nipple before pulling the taut bud between her lips. She didn't dare close her eyes again, her breath shaky as Rio gently sucked and nipped, maintaining eye contact the whole time before pulling away with a hum.</p><p>“You're being so good for me. Do you think I should reward you?” Rio’s voice was husky, her pupils blown, clearly as affected by this game as Agatha was.</p><p>Quickly nodding, Agatha moved her hands in an attempt to reach out, but was harshly pinned back against the mattress again.</p><p>“Ah ah ah, that's not what I had in mind.”</p><p>Agatha pushed back against the hold, her shoulders screaming at the effort, but Rio was far too strong. Relenting, Agatha pouted at her. “Do I still get my reward? Or are you going to punish me?”</p><p>“Do you want me to punish you?” It was a genuine question, Rio loosening her grip so her hands only sat against Agatha’s wrists, asking for boundaries.</p><p>Agatha pondered for a moment. Is that what she wanted? A little bit of pain was nice, the feel of Rio overpowering her, but she'd never been a masochist. The idea of Rio being disappointed, even under the guise of playfulness, made her skin crawl. She frowned and shook her head.</p><p>“No. No I don't.”</p><p>Rio lifted her hand from her wrists, but Agatha kept her arms above her head of her own volition with a grin, needing Rio to know that she was enjoying herself.</p><p>“Hmm. Reward it is then.” Rio smiled and dipped her head to press a kiss to Agatha’s lips. It started with a peck, but became increasingly filthy in no time, tongues sliding together and exploring each other's mouths. Agatha had to knit her fingers into the sheets to stop herself from touching. Pulling away with a gasp, freshly flushed, Rio’s fingers began frantically working at the front of Agatha's trousers. With a lift of her hips, Agatha attempted to help as Rio pulled the offending fabric from her body, the clunk of her boots landing in a corner somewhere in the room. She moved from her position only to also remove her shirt the rest of the way before laying back again with her wrists carefully above her head, biting her lip as she waited.</p><p>“So well behaved for me, sweetheart.”</p><p>Agatha squirmed as Rio's lips glazed across her inner thigh, the lightest of touches sending flames through her body. Her breath was warm against Agatha's skin, teeth scraping like she wanted to bite but stopping herself with a little hum.</p><p>“Did you know that you have a major artery, just here.” Rio’s fingernail traced sharply up the inside of Agatha's leg, pausing at the bend. “The tiniest knick and you would bleed out in a matter of minutes.” Her tongue darted out to lick her lips as she closed her eyes and took a deep breath to try and refocus. “It's intoxicating.”</p><p>Agatha shifted a little, exposing more of her leg to Rio and reaching out to gently caress her cheek. “Have a taste.”</p><p>Rio's eyes flashed with desire before she managed to shake her head a little. “I wouldn't want you to pass out before we've had our fun.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled at Rio's smirk, running her thumb over the woman’s lips. “I trust you.” Pulling her hand from Rio's face, she settled back into position, wrists crossed in some semblance of restraint.</p><p>“Those are dangerous words, my love.” Eyes darkening, Rio bared her teeth and Agatha watched as her incisors became fangs in an instant. What should have been the adrenaline of fear hit her in the chest, excitement as Rio braced herself before plunging teeth into Agatha’s skin.</p><p>Agatha’s back arched involuntarily at the pain, a groan escaping her lips. Her thigh was far more sensitive than her neck, the euphoria of the bite not quite enough to completely drown out the sensation. As her head began to buzz, drunk on Rio’s bite, Agatha settled into it. Her breath was shallow, fingers tightening into the sheets to stop her hands from wandering. When Rio emerged, spending a moment to truly make sure the wound had closed well, Agatha's hands lunged for the woman to bring her back to her mouth.</p><p>The metallic taste of her own blood on Rio's lips was something Agatha would never get enough of. The game was over. Agatha rolled them over, Rio's back against the mattress as she chased the flavour in a lust filled frenzy. As she kissed along her neck, sucking little marks against her skin, Rio let out a sigh, fingers carding through her hair.</p><p>“You put far too much faith in me, Agatha.”</p><p>Sitting up, legs straddling the woman now under her, Agatha looked at Rio with a furrowed brow. “You’re wrong. You assume that I have faith in you not killing me?” She reached out to run her thumb along Rio's bottom lip, brushing a smear of blood she must have missed. “I simply would not mind if you did. Dying in your arms, the woman I love, it would be an honour.”</p><p>“You're so dramatic.” Rio's smile was soft, her hand lifting to stroke Agatha's face and pull her down again for a gentle kiss, whispering against her lips. “I love you, Agatha.”</p><p>Fingers tracing down Agatha's spine as their lips locked, Rio's hands rounded over her hips and pulled her closer. The friction caused them both to moan, Agatha rocking against her body as the tension at the base of her spine tightened. Sliding a hand between them, Agatha ground down against her knuckles, gasping against Rio's lips.</p><p>Pulling at her hips again, Rio whined at the touch, desperate for more. Slipping her fingers between her folds, Agatha drew more of those sweet sounds from Rio’s lips, swallowing them down with her own. When fingers finally pushed into her slick opening, Rio threw her head back with a moan, her hips raising to meet Agatha's. Tongue against the column of Rio's throat, Agatha pumped her fingers inside, the roll of her hips keeping friction against her clit and driving her insane.</p><p>With her chest heaving, Rio managed to form the words she wanted. “Agatha, wait… wait… together. I want…. Together.”</p><p>Slowing her movements, Agatha let Rio collect herself, their foreheads pressed together. She hadn't realized how tightly wound she was herself until Rio's fingers gently circled her clit, a cry pushing from her chest as her hips staggered at the touch. She wasted no time, filling her up with ease. With a press of lips, thick with want, they began their movements in tandem. Their kisses were lazy, more a sharing of breath than anything else, each movement, touch, crook of a finger mirrored by the other.</p><p>Agatha braced the arm holding herself up, hand tightening in the sheets as she felt the crescendo climbing. Rio's voice, breathy in her ear as she gripped tightly to the back of her neck, repeated her name over and over, like a prayer. The final curl of her fingers turned it into a shout, Rio throwing her head back in pleasure.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha's own pleasure tumbled after her, body tightening around lithe fingers with a wanton moan before collapsing. As she caught her breath, she placed little kisses under Rio's jaw, feeling her pulse against her lips.</p><p>“I never want to stop touching you.” She lowered her head to Rio’s chest, sucking a mark against her collarbone and watching as it bloomed red under the skin. She was never getting over the possessiveness of watching her own blood as it moved through Rio’s body.</p><p>“I know the feeling well.” Rio ran her fingers through Agatha's hair, stopping to frame her jaw and draw her back to her lips. Their bodies locked together, legs entwined and hands wandering over every inch of skin, as the kiss deepened. When a rather rough bite against her lip sent a burst of metallic against Agatha’s tongue, a thought crossed her mind.</p><p>Lifting Rio's hand to her cheek, Agatha turned away from the kiss to press her lips against the inside of her wrist. With a scrape of her teeth against the skin, Agatha put on her biggest puppy dog eyes and looked through her lashes up at Rio.</p><p>“Could I have a taste, my love?”</p><p>Rio seemed taken aback at the request, eyebrows knitting together. “You'd actually want to drink my blood?”</p><p>“I want to be connected to you in every way imaginable.” She pressed another purposeful kiss to the veins against her wrist. “Your heart pumps my blood, pushes me through your veins. I want the same, your blood warming my body, keeping me alive.”</p><p>Rio's eyes turned black as pitch at her words. Pulling her wrist from Agatha's grasp, she lifted it to her own mouth, her teeth tearing an opening in the skin. The blood rose to the surface, slowly spilling over like crimson tears. Agatha watched a moment, entranced, before she realized the wound was already beginning to close. Lunging forward, tongue lapping against her skin, Agatha brought her lips back to her wrist. Latching on, she pulled the sharp liquid into her mouth with a steady suck, desperate to get what she could before the skin knit itself closed. Breathing through her nose, Agatha swallowed each thick mouthful of blood she was able to get until it stopped coming. She felt her chest heave as she licked Rio's skin clean, any evidence of an opening melting away as she watched.</p><p>“Holy, shit.” Rio's voice was wrecked as she stared at Agatha, watching her wipe the blood from her lips. “I didn't think that would be so hot.”</p><p>“Now you know how I feel.” Agatha grinned, biting her lip as she lowered herself again. “So what are you going to do about it?”</p><p>Rio snapped, grasping the back of her neck to pull her down into a kiss, fingers gripping tightly at the base of her hair. Agatha whined against her lips, hiking her leg up so she could slot easily in between. Rio was slick and open for her fingers as they pressed inside, her groan as she was filled swallowed by Agatha's lips. Leg hooking around Agatha's hips, pulling her closer, Rio's grip shifted to her shoulders. With each thrust of Agatha’s fingers, nails sunk deeper into her skin, the bite of pain exhilarating. She could feel the scratches opening and closing along her back, Rio's fresh blood in her system healing with each swipe as Rio clung to her.</p><p>“More, Agatha! Harder!” Rio gasped in her ear and Agatha did as she was told until her fingers coaxed a scream from the woman, her body arching as her head flung back.</p><p>Agatha was only granted a moment of smug appreciation for her work before she was thrown onto her back. Rio, like a woman possessed, tasted her way down Agatha's body until she reached her prize. As her tongue licked through her folds, a moan pushed through Agatha's entire body. She pulled her clit between her lips and Agatha's hand slammed down against the mattress as her hips bucked. Between whatever chemicals were coursing through her system from blood and bite, and the high she was experiencing from the woman between her legs, Agatha thought she was bound to be driven mad. She squirmed underneath Rio’s ministrations, fingers knitted tightly in either the sheets or her hair as the tension built. A steady stream of moans were all Agatha was capable of until a well timed suck sent her over the edge with an explosion of white across her vision.</p><p>Breath finally slowing, Agatha’s senses came back to tiny kisses against her sternum and a smug smirk staring up at her.</p><p>“That was fucking insane.” She reached down to stroke Rio's cheek, who chuckled and kissed her hand.</p><p>“And I bet you're not even tired.”</p><p>It was true. Agatha’s body, so thoroughly fucked, should have been spent. Instead, she felt energy vibrating in her bones and an itch for more.</p><p>“I could get used to this.”</p><p>Rio's eyes flicked away from her for a second, clearly distracted by something before a laugh escaped her lips.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nothing, it's just… we’re not the only ones having fun.”</p><p>It took Agatha a moment to get her meaning, so thoroughly wrapped up in a Rio she'd forgotten everything and everyone else.</p><p>“What do you say we show them how it's done?”</p><p>Rio laughed with a shriek as Agatha tackled her onto her back, ready for round three.</p>

<p>“So what's the plan?”</p><p>Agatha looked up from her breakfast with an arched eyebrow, finding Alice staring at her expectantly. They sat at Rio’s seldom used dining table, the woman having cooked breakfast, or rather lunch, for the living. It almost felt like a fucked up version of a family meal.</p><p>“The plan? Jen and I report to headquarters while you stay here and wait for the sun to set. Same as it has been.”</p><p>Watching Alice deflate with a grumble, Agatha set down her fork and sat back with her arms crossed.</p><p>“What do you want the plan to be?”</p><p>Alice’s eyes darted to Jen, clearly having already had this conversation with her. “I don't know. I mean… last night was a lot of fun… fully ignoring the part where I need to scrub my memory of some of the things I heard.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. Last night was a lot of fun. Rio’s hands slid along her shoulders before her arms wrapped around them from behind. With a quiet chuckle, she leaned down to kiss Agatha, looking rather smug.</p><p>Alice shuddered and rolled her eyes, apparently scarred from their antics. “But before all that… the hunting. That felt really good. It was like I had a purpose again, a reason for all of this happening to me.”</p><p>“What are you proposing?” Agatha narrowed her eyes towards Jen, who was staying out of the conversation.</p><p>“Let me come on patrol with you. You have to admit that things would be easier with me there.”</p><p>“Okay, and if the council catch wind?”</p><p>“That's what I said.” Jen mumbled into her food, ignoring the glare from Alice.</p><p>“How are they gonna know?”</p><p>“Alice, it's bad enough that I've been telling them Jen has been tagging along with me. Why do you think she's going in today? I'm supposed to be off on my own. Lilia can only do so much before Evanora starts breathing down my neck. You don't think she'll be suspicious if our success rates all of a sudden skyrocket?”</p><p>Agatha sighed at the sight of Alice looking like a kicked puppy, knowing that she was right and any excitement she may have had falling away.</p><p>“Look, I'm not giving you an outright no, Alice. All I'm saying is that we need to think more about it. Last night was not exactly a good idea but at least everyone was too busy to notice. We need to be smart.”</p><p>“Fine. You're right, Agatha.” They were words that always came out stung, no matter which of them said it.</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha reached over and tapped Alice's hand. “We’ll figure it out, okay? Let's just give things time to settle first.”</p><p>With an attempt at a comforting smile, Agatha got up to get ready to leave, Rio following her out of the dining room.</p><p>“When am I seeing you?” Rio stopped her with hands against her waist, pulling her close.</p><p>“I'm going to stop at home to change after checking in. As much as I appreciate the dress, it's not exactly conducive to working.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers roamed over the expensive fabric of the dress she loaned Agatha, who'd run out of clothes and needed something appropriate for daytime.</p><p>“I'll meet you there. Dusk should have fallen by then. As much as I like you in my clothes…” She yanked at Agatha’s bodice, clearly feeling possessive. “I do love you in trousers.”</p><p>“Sweetheart, did you not just hear the conversation in there?” Agatha had a pit of anxiety in her stomach around getting caught, the Alice of it all throwing a new layer into the mix.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness.” Rio's voice became stern. “I have been a vampire longer than you have been alive. Do not believe that I would allow you to police my coming and goings. Although it's adorable that you thought you could.” With a tiny smirk, she pressed a kiss to Agatha's lips. “I'll be seeing you later, my love.” She squished Agatha's jaw between her fingers, her smirk growing before turning and disappearing deeper into the house.</p><p>“You know, I never thought I'd see you like this.” Jen’s voice broke Agatha out of her thoughts as they made their way through the streets and towards the modiste. “It's almost like you're warmer, brighter. Who would’ve believed you could care about people other than yourself?”</p><p>“Wow, Jen. Careful, that almost sounded like a compliment.” Agatha rolled her eyes as Jen sniggered, knowing exactly how it sounded.</p><p>“I mean it though. She looks good on you. Makes you more human.”</p><p>“Hmm… ironic.” Agatha smirked, holding the door to the dressmaker’s open for her before following after. Young Tommy was at his usual spot on the front desk and nodded at them.</p><p>“Good afternoon, ladies. There's some new samples in the back for you, and mum was hoping to see you today Ms Kale.”</p><p>“You're looking sharp today, Tommy. Is that a new vest?”</p><p>The young man blushed, looking down at the garment. “Thank you Ms Harkness, it is. Mum made it for me. I'm meant to meet a young lady for tea today.”</p><p>“Very handsome. You'll knock her dead.” Agatha punched him on the shoulder, bringing a smile to his face, and ducked under the curtain into the dressing rooms.</p><p>“See? When have you ever been that nice?” Jen squeezed into the booth next to her and pulled on the mechanism to send the lift to the basement.</p><p>“Oh, shut up. Just because I'm not nice to you, doesn't mean I'm not nice. I'll have you know that Wanda’s boys both love me.”</p><p>“It's not the brag you think it is, being adored by teenagers.”</p><p>As much as Agatha enjoyed the barbs they threw at each other, she dropped the witty banter. It was time for them to focus. They were in dangerous lands, where one misplaced word could send everything toppling to the ground.</p><p>“Jen! You're here!” Wanda rushed through the maze of workbenches towards them as soon as they exited the lift, flinging her arms around the other woman. Agatha made eye contact with Jen and mouthed <em>you're grieving</em>, towards her before continuing on towards Lilia's room.</p><p>“Hello, darling. How was last night?” Lilia barely looked up from whatever she was reading atop her desk as Agatha wandered in.</p><p>Fidgeting, Agatha slowly spun the globe on display on one of the side tables and she spoke. “Fine. Uneventful. How was the ceremony?”</p><p>Lilia sighed. “Thoroughly devastating." She closed the ledger and stood to move around her desk. “How's Jen?”</p><p>“Jen’s out there. Ready to get back to work.” Agatha leaned back against a table, arms crossing over her chest.</p><p>“Oh, that's good. Poor thing.” As Lilia got closer, she took in Agatha's appearance but chose not to comment on the dress that definitely wasn't her style. “And how are you?”</p><p>“As I keep telling you, I'm fine Lilia. Just give me my assignment and I'll be out of your hair.”</p><p>“Yes, alright fine. God forbid I care.” Lilia pulled a piece of paper from the folds of her dress and handed it to Agatha. “I hate the idea of you being alone in that house. I just wish you'd spend more time around here, around your people.” As Agatha reached out to take the paper, her hand clasped against her forearm in what was meant to be a comforting gesture. However, Lilia's fingers gripped tight as a tiny gasp pushed from her chest and she stared up into Agatha's face. Reaching up to gently touch her cheek, Lilia’s eyes turned sad.</p><p>“I always knew you were meant for bigger things.”</p><p>The moment stopped in an instant, like it had never happened as Lilia released her grip and went back to her desk. “Send Jen in when she's done being doted over. And Agatha?”</p><p>Brow furrowed in confusion, Agatha made for the door before pausing once more.</p><p>“Don't be a stranger.”</p><p>Stepping out of the office, Agatha rolled her shoulders, trying to dislodge the odd feeling Lilia had placed on her as she made her way back to the others.</p><p>“Your turn, Kale. Be warned, she's extra witchy today.”</p><p>Jen extracted herself from Wanda’s grip, leaving Agatha to be her new target.</p><p>“How are you, dear?”</p><p>She tried her hardest not to roll her eyes. And Lilia wondered why she didn't want to spend time here. “I'm fine. Keeping busy.”</p><p>“As is your way, I suppose.” Wanda smiled a sad smile and lifted a hand to her arm. “Billy's been working on some new things. He's excited to show you when he's done.”</p><p>“If it's anything like the last gadget, I look forward to seeing what he's dreamt up.” Agatha absently adjusted the bracer hidden under her sleeve. “I have my assignment, I'm heading out.”</p><p>“Are you not waiting for Jen?”</p><p>“Jen’s a big girl, she doesn't need a chaperone.”</p><p>Before Agatha could turn to leave, the breath was knocked out of her as Wanda flung her arms around her shoulders and hugged her tight. Her voice was small in her ear, the kind of voice that was only used to share secrets.</p><p>“I miss how we were. Just young girls without a fear in the world. But now we’re grown, and I have too much to care about.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened at her words, her hands gently raising to loosely return the hug. Wanda was right. Things were easy when they were teenagers with nothing to lose, but now there were things, people they loved. Wanda had her boys, they each had a partner in this life, and as much as she was loath to admit it, they had each other. This was the reason she'd been avoiding being here as much as possible. Wanda was actually grieving one of the people she loved, and Agatha was pretending.</p><p>Bracing her hands against her arms, Agatha pushed Wanda back and attempted to nonchalantly wipe the tears that had begun to fall. She quickly put the mask back in place and shook her head.</p><p>“We can't stay kids forever Wanda.”</p><p>Attempting to escape, she felt Wanda’s hand grasp for hers once more. “Just… be careful.” She squeezed tight before letting go and turning back towards the workbenches, wiping at her own face.</p><p>Agatha released a breath and hurried towards the lift before anyone else could stop her and rattle her psyche any more for the day. Who would have thought that Agatha Harkness would actually manage to find kinship in the women she'd grown up with. It was really damaging to the lone wolf persona she was trying to put out, but she couldn't help but feel warmer at the thought. Maybe she wasn't as alone as Evanora had always made her feel.</p>

<p>She kept to the shadows, as was her way, while the sun slowly sank behind buildings and disappeared beyond the horizon. It was one of her favourite things to do, walk the streets at dusk and watch the people as they hurried about their final business for the day. It was the closest she could get to the mundane, among the normal everyday people doing normal everyday things.</p><p>The shopping district was surprisingly busy for the evening, lots of bodies rushing about, easy to blend in. Smiling at a young boy distracted by a nearby bird while his mother spoke with a friend outside the flower shop, a familiar scent wafted through the air, drawing Rio’s attention. Spotting the curls she knew so well, she smirked and wound her way through the shoppers towards her. Placing a silent hand against her waist, she whispered at Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“Boo.”</p><p>The woman actually jumped beneath her fingers, Rio hearing her heart speed up a moment before settling at the realization. She was surprised at the reaction, Agatha usually being hard to sneak up on.</p><p>“Are you alright, my love?” As she looped her arm in Agatha's, appearing as nothing more than friends out for a stroll, she carefully searched her face for answers.</p><p>“Fine.” It was a lie, as it often was when asked about her well-being. Rio gently rubbed her thumb against her arm, trying to coax out more. Agatha shook her head. “That place just… I don't know. It rattled me today.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened the way it always did when she thought about how she couldn't protect Agatha from those people. The people who wouldn't even blink before killing her. It made her wonder when her life had ended up so… Shakespearean.</p><p>“I'm sorry, sweetheart. What can I do?”</p><p>Agatha pulled her closer as they walked, her free hand coming up to rest against Rio’s. “You do enough by just being here. I will gladly put up with the headache if it means I get to have you.”</p><p>“You have me, Agatha. For as long as you wish.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “That could be a very long time. Are you sure you want to promise that?”</p><p>“What else am I doing with my life? I might as well spend it with you.” Rio grinned back, playing nonchalant. In actuality, she couldn't think about what her life would be like without Agatha. She'd been on this earth for a long time, but she'd only started feeling alive again after that first night in the alley, a stake to her heart and a healthy amount of banter between would be enemies. Without Agatha, Rio thought, what was there to live for?</p><p>“How romantic.”</p><p>“Well I would get down on one knee but… this dress is rather expensive.”</p><p>A laugh burst from Agatha’s chest, drawing looks from passerbys and turning her face red from the attention. Rio couldn't help but smile at how cute she looked.</p><p>With another shake of her head, Agatha turned to her with narrowed eyes, her voice sardonic. “You're hilarious.”</p><p>It was only a joke on the surface. Rio had every intention of entangling them in every way possible. If that meant making Agatha her bride one day, then so be it. She looked back at Agatha, only smiling and not refuting anything. When she didn't say anything for a long while, she watched as Agatha's pupils expanded and knew exactly where her mind had gone.</p><p>With a reassuring pat against her arm, Rio focused back on their path, Agatha's house coming into view. “There will be plenty of time to think about that, my love. But I do suspect you'd look absolutely stunning in white.”</p><p>She heard Agatha swallow hard, her mouth suddenly dry as she tried to respond. “I uh… well I don't think either of us could get away with white, sweetheart. Perhaps we think about black.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, feeling her own face warming at the prospect, at the idea that Agatha was actually thinking about it. “A fine idea. We’ll put a pin in it for now.”</p><p>As they climbed the front stoop, they paused at the top in front of the door. Agatha’s neighbourhood was quieter than the main streets, feeling more private.</p><p>“Will you be joining me tonight then?” Agatha’s hand slid into her own as they unlooped their arms.</p><p>“I thought you might like some backup. It's been forever since we've had a night to ourselves.”</p><p>“A promenade in the moonlight?”</p><p>Rio smiled and rolled her eyes, feeling like a debutante. “It's a date.”</p><p>“I wish you'd let me… you know.” Agatha gestured her head towards the door. “But I'll respect your wishes and leave you tied up outside like a dog.” She smirked before glancing around at the road below them, making sure the coast was clear before leaning in to peck Rio’s lips. “I'll only be a few minutes. I just need to get out of this dress.”</p><p>“Don't worry about me. I'll keep myself entertained. Maybe chase a cat or two.”</p><p>Agatha laughed as her hand twisted the door knob and she stepped over the threshold.</p><p>Rio should have known something was wrong, she should have been able to tell before it happened, but she was a few seconds too late. A hand shot out of the darkness of the house and yanked Agatha to the ground by her hair.</p><p>“Treasonous whore!”</p><p>As Evanora launched herself at her daughter, pinning her to the ground, Rio threw herself forward without thinking. Her body slammed against the invisible barrier as she shouted.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha struggled under her mother, but while Evanora was along in years, she was still a formidable opponent. Hand clasped against her jaw, she slammed Agatha's head against the ground, slowing some of the fight.</p><p>“I've put up with a lot of your dalliances, Agatha. I've turned my eye from your proclivities, I've stomached the embarrassment you bring me among my peers, I've allowed you to stay here unmarried, and this is how you repay me?”</p><p>Rio could see the tears streaming down Agatha's face from where she stood helpless on the stoop, sobs wracking through her as she continued trying to throw her mother off of her.</p><p>“I've been saying it since you were born. You're a disappointment. You disgust me.”</p><p>“Mother please! Please, mother, I'll leave! I'll leave and never come back! You'll never hear from me again, I promise!”</p><p>Evanora sneered at her daughter before ripping at the collar of her dress, revealing her neck and the partially healed wounds that Rio had left there. Rio's heart sank, knowing the reaction that was coming.</p><p>“You would let her defile you?” Evanora spat in Agatha's face. “You are no blood of mine. It's too late for your pleas. You are a blight that must be cut from this world, tainted by scum.”</p><p>Rio saw the flash of steel in the older woman’s hand and felt her heart stop. “Agatha!”</p><p>“Stay out of this bloodsucker! You'll be dead by sunrise!”</p><p>“No! Mother, please!” Agatha flailed harder even though her mother’s knee was against her sternum.</p><p>Slamming her hands against the barrier out of sheer panic and frustration, her eyes met Agatha's. She saw the thought take hold in her mind as she opened her mouth to speak again.</p><p>“Rio, co-”</p><p>A hand slapped her hard across the face before grasping her mouth in its palm, stopping the invitation on her tongue.</p><p>“Do not invite that <em>thing</em> into my house! Don't worry. Out of familial obligation, I'll make it quick.” Evanora brandished the knife against Agatha's throat. “I should have killed you the moment you were born. Insolent child.”</p><p>Before she knew what she was doing, Rio was pressing her hand into the barrier. Her skin burned hotter than any fire could, but she found the resolve to carry on, pushing further. Agatha’s shining blue eyes spurred her forward. She heard a wail as she took another step, assuming it came from her own lips as Agatha's eyes widened. Rage and love fueling every movement, Rio wanted nothing more than to rip the harpy’s head from her body. Another wail emerged, her skin feeling like it was melting from her bones, but this one was laced with fury. It was enough to catch some of Evanora’s attention, a sick smirk upon her lips.</p><p>“Foolish vermin. You've made my job easier. Let me just take care of my daughter fir-”</p><p>As she turned back to Agatha, her words were cut off by the sudden appearance of a wooden stake being driven through her throat. Blood gurgled over her lips, her face a mask of shock as Agatha managed to extricate the stake from her wrist and push the woman off of her.</p><p>“Rio! Come in! You're invited! You're invited.”</p><p>The second the words left Agatha's mouth, the burning stopped. Rio fell to her knees, thrown off balance by the sudden absence of resistance. She hissed in air as she began to heal, the red and blistered skin evening out and melting away. Her eyes flicked to where Agatha was on the ground, covered in her mother's blood as she gasped to catch her breath. Only, it wasn't just her mother's blood.</p><p>Evanora’s knife had found its home, buried deep in Agatha's chest, piercing her heart. With a sob, Rio rushed to her side and pulled her love into her lap. Blue eyes smiled up at her, a gentle hand reaching to touch Rio's cheek.</p><p>“My love.” Her voice was ragged, air struggling to escape her lungs. Rio brushed her hair from her face, stroking in what she hoped was a reassuring manner.</p><p>“I'm here, my heart. I'm here.”</p><p>Agatha’s blood stained lips curved into a peaceful smile, comfortable like she was cuddling on the sofa with her, until she coughed and more crimson spilled from her mouth.</p><p>As her eyes fluttered closed and a final breath pushed from Agatha's chest, Rio heard her heart slow to a stop. She sat in the silence for a moment before everything tumbled over. Her own heart felt like it was about to burst. Ripping the knife from her chest and throwing it across the room, she clutched at Agatha's body and let out a feral cry. In that moment, she'd never felt so helpless, the cry turning into her weeping, forehead pressed to her love’s temple. This wasn't how any of this was supposed to go.</p><p>In the back of her mind she heard running footsteps as someone climbed the front steps and stood before them, taking in the scene.</p><p>“Rio…” Alice’s voice was small, full of surprise and emotion. “What can I do?”</p><p>With a wince, Rio shook her head, not moving from her embrace. If Alice was this close to her, it meant only one thing. The owners of this house were truly dead. There was nothing more to be done</p>

<p>Death was peaceful.</p><p>The quiet fade of consciousness into nothingness, silence, stillness.</p><p>Death was peaceful, until I wasn't.</p><p>A thousand tiny pieces of glass cut open her skin as she cried out. She fought against hands holding her underwater, her lungs burning with every attempt at breath, the water like acid against her wounds. The dark face above her was familiar as her fingers grasped at nothing, her mother’s laugh echoing in her ears. She couldn't move, couldn't escape. The water turned to flames licking at her skin, searing her from the inside as she writhed against the pain.</p><p><em>Shhh. I'm here, my love. I'm right here</em>.</p><p>Her fingers were raw where they scraped at the ground, chasing the voice, trying to free herself from this torment only to be dragged back to begin anew. She tried to scream, to call for help, but her throat was full of gravel, the rocks slicing her open with each attempt.</p><p><em>Come back to me</em>.</p><p>This was hell. It must be. Eternal torment and pain. The torture of hearing her love’s voice but not being able to reach for it. Her mother had been right all along. She was but another demon sent to hell.</p><p>There was no sense of time here as she was jostled from one vision to another until they all bled together. Drowning in flame, burning underwater, suffocating in darkness. Until she opened her eyes to something else, blinded by the brightness of her new environment.</p><p>Something was wrong. Everything was still, she wasn't actively in pain. She took a deep breath before choking on the air, coughing up a hundred different overwhelming tastes. Her eyes darted around at her surroundings as she sat up, the room unfamiliar to her. It was small and dark now that her eyes adjusted, the only light coming from candles scattered around on the few surfaces there were. Her attention caught as she followed a miniscule dust particle float upon the air near her face before locking in on the chair at the foot of the bed. What once was a shadow to her sat unmoving, hands steepled and waiting.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to speak only to find her throat dry and gritty from lack of use, but she was able to whisper the one thing that mattered. “Rio.”</p><p>The shadow leaned forward, her eyes shining with tears, and gave the tiniest shake of her head. “I'm so sorry.”</p><p>As she sat up, hand reaching out for her, a wave of exhaustion hit Agatha, her head spinning and forcing her to grasp at the footboard to steady herself. “What-” Agatha strained to make sense of what was happening. What was the last thing she remembered?</p><p>Pain. The crack of her skull against wooden floorboards. A sharp sting against her cheek. Watching Rio burn herself alive to reach her. Then blood.</p><p>Her mouth watered at the thought, the memory of her mother’s blood spraying from her throat. Her eyes met Rio's again from across the room and the woman whispered her refrain once more. “I'm sorry.”</p><p>“I'm dead.”</p><p>Agatha didn't know what she'd expected to feel in this moment. Was it sadness? Anger? Whatever it was, she certainly hadn't expected what came washing over her. Relief. She watched a tear fall from Rio’s eyes, the droplet running across her cheek, and vaulted over the end of the bed to reach her. She threw her arms around Rio, hugging her tight as a sigh pushed from her chest followed by a laugh.</p><p>“You're um… taking this well…” Rio’s hands were cautious against her sides, likely unsure on how to interpret Agatha's reaction.</p><p>“Don't you see?” Releasing Rio, Agatha kneeled in front of her, grasping her hands and smiling up at her. “I'm finally free.”</p><p>“No, Agatha. You don't understand…”</p><p>“No, Rio.” Agatha cut her off, her voice stern. “You don't understand. Evanora is dead, and here I am.” She raised Rio's hands to her face, leaning into the softness of her palms. “Alive. With the woman I love. I survived.”</p><p>“At what cost?” Rio shook her head morosely. “This wasn't how it was supposed to go. You were supposed to have a choice.”</p><p>“Rio, my love… I never had a choice.” She pressed her lips to Rio's palm. “From the moment I met you, this was always going to be the only option.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, openly crying now, and pressed their foreheads together. “I'm so sorry, Agatha. I'm so sorry.”</p><p>“Stop apologizing.” She raised her thumbs to wipe at Rio's tears.</p><p>“You're here because of me.”</p><p>“Exactly. I'm here because of you. Without you, I’d be dead. Buried in the ground, not coming back, dead.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, Agatha feeling her hands shake. “Your mother wouldn't have attacked you if it wasn't for me.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, pulling Rio to her feet and clasping her face in her hands. “Rio, I was already dying. Being in that house, living under her rule, it was killing me. You saved me. You saved me from the moment you pushed me clear of that carriage. You've never stopped saving me. I owe you my life.” She leaned forward and gently slid their lips together in a chaste kiss.</p><p>“You don't owe me anything, Agatha. If anything, I owe you for letting this happen.”</p><p>“It sounds to me like our debts cancel each other out then. That's too bad...” She grinned slyly, watching as Rio’s eyebrow rose. “I was intending on pledging my life to you for an eternity, or at least as long as you'll have me. You might be sick of me now.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes with an annoyed shake of her head, but Agatha saw the tiny smile on her lips. “I hate you.”</p><p>“I know, my love.” She pecked her lips again, wiping what was left of Rio’s tears. “Now how about we do something about this hunger thing. I feel like I'm going to be sick.”</p><p>Agatha was starving. Like a hadn't eaten in weeks kind of starving. She did her best to focus on something else, but it was there in the background. A constant yelling, a burning in her gut, in her throat.</p><p>Rio nodded, immediately understanding. “There's clothes in the wardrobe, I'll be back in a moment.”</p><p>Agatha tried to listen as Rio left the room, tried to discern where she was going and what she was doing, but to no avail. She did however hear things she wasn't expecting. The quiet ticking of a clock somewhere else in the house, the chattering of rats in the street outside. She shook her head and turned to open the wardrobe. The clothes were nothing special. A small selection of shirts and trousers folded neatly for her and a coat hanging on the rack. Rio knew what she liked.</p><p>It took her no time at all to change and she caught herself in the mirror. Running her fingers through her hair, she was surprised to find it untangled, like someone had taken care of it while she slept. Her heart warmed at the thought, Rio gently running a brush through her hair while she kept sentry over her. She stepped closer to the mirror and looked over her face, bringing fingers to run along her skin. She looked the same, perhaps less tired, slightly pale. She grimaced at her reflection, baring her teeth. Nothing. Furrowing her brow, she tried again.</p><p>“Think about how hungry you are.”</p><p>Agatha nearly jumped at Rio’s reappearance, glancing at her through the reflection. She stood in the doorway, arms crossed over her chest as she watched. Looking back at herself, Agatha focused on the pang in her stomach, the unbearable thirst scratching at her throat. Gripping at the edge of the mirror, she couldn't help the hiss that escaped her lips as her face changed before her, her features sharpening, eyes glowing, and the fangs. The fangs pushed from her gums and she carefully ran her tongue across their points. She was frightening. The kind of thing you fear is lurking in the darkness. A monster.</p><p>Agatha took a step back from the mirror, squeezing her eyes shut and shaking her head. She'd become the thing she'd vowed to kill. She was the creature in the night that the people needed protection from.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio's hand landed between her shoulders, solid and steadying.</p><p>Agatha nodded, taking a deep breath to try and stop herself from spiraling. “Yeah, it's just… strange.”</p><p>“I know. You'll get used to it. The change is brought on by emotions. Predominantly anger and fear. The hunger triggers your fear, your survival instincts.” Her fingers pushed a lock of hair behind Agatha's ear. “Are you ready to go? I get the feeling you learn better on your feet.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, glancing once more at herself before heading for the door with a sense of determination. If there was one thing she was capable of, it was hunting.</p>

I've been a little blocked on this lately (my muse has been a tad distracted and my brain hasn't wanted to pivot) and I didn't want to post this chapter until I at least had a decent start on the next. Only a handful of chapter left, I think, but stay tuned! Thank you everyone for reading and hopefully enjoying!</p>
