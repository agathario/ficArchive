<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>"I want this," She says, plainly, "And it's fine if you don't. I understand. But if you're only holding back because you think I'll regret it in the morning…" She trails off, racks her brain for something to soothe Rio's overworking brain with, "Rio, I'm green."</p>
<p>It takes a minute for Rio to answer—brain quite obviously cracking and sparking, but then, "You want this." They say in a way that sounds more like a realization sinking in than a question.</p>
<p>And so Agatha, just to make Rio laugh, tilts her head so she's not speaking into the mattress, "What's a little bondage between friends?"</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Rio's never tied anyone up before. For some reason, as their best friend, this means Agatha has to get involved.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>There are just some situations one doesn’t come to expect to be in with their best friend.</p><p>And this—Agatha face down on the center of her bed in a position she’s previously only ever found herself in during her twice weekly yoga class, while said best friend checks they can fit two fingers between rope and Agatha’s skin, in a tie she herself had instructed, is one of those situations.</p><p>But maybe Agatha’s getting ahead of herself. There was, of course, a build up to this. Agatha didn’t just strip and bend over for her best friend of fifteen years and demand to be tied up, but even still, if anyone had told her just last month that this is where she’d be, she wouldn’t have believed them.</p><p>It started, as most things do with them, in Agatha’s living room—a film they’ve seen countless times together playing as background noise for their conversation, and a bottle of wine split between them.</p><p>And Agatha’s trying very hard to be patient with all of Rio’s hesitance—and they <em>are</em> being hesitant, Agatha can tell—but that’s one trait she’s never been credited with having. Their wine is barely touched in their glass, lips remain unstained as, every so often, they let out a glum sigh, locked deep in their own head.</p><p>“Fucking hell, I can’t do this anymore.” Agatha says, shifts so she can put her wine glass down onto the ceramic coaster on the coffee table with a clink. Rio looks startled, eyes wide and like they’ve been caught doing something they shouldn’t.</p><p>“I’ve been zoning out again, haven’t I?” A sheepish look spills over their face.</p><p>“Well yeah, but you don’t normally look like you’ve been sent here to kill me.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio laughs, taps a finger on the stem of their glass, “It’s not <em>quite</em> as difficult as that.”</p><p>Agatha gestures for them to explain—patience thinning. If it were anybody else, she’d have jumped down their throat the second the first sigh had left their lips. And though Rio maybe wouldn’t necessarily agree, Agatha reserves all of her gentleness for them.</p><p>Rio has enough gentle to extend to more than just Agatha, but Agatha’s greedy little heart is placated knowing she’s <em>first. She’s</em> the most important. The best friend.</p><p>“So what’s up?” Rio bats away her question with a hand and a shake of their head, “Rio, you know I won’t let this go. Yellow card has been issued, I can’t take it back now.”</p><p>“Aw, you did pay attention to the game." Rio grins and for some godforsaken reason finds the need to flick Agatha’s forehead. Agatha <em>did</em> pay attention—is always in the habit of paying attention to whatever Rio’s interested in, even if she doesn’t often let them see that.</p><p>“Don’t change the subject.” Agatha scowls, rubs the place where Rio’s finger made contact.</p><p>Rio must have thought they’d managed to escape questioning because their head drops to the back of the couch and they let out an agonized groan. It’s so very an Agatha sort of move that it amuses her to no end the idea of Rio’s subconscious latching onto her enough to replicate parts of her.</p><p>“You remember Maria, right?”</p><p>Remembers her. Loathes her. Yeah, she’d say that was about right.</p><p>Agatha only hums.</p><p>“She,” Rio gulps, more nervous than Agatha is used to seeing them, “She asked me to do something—”</p><p>“Oh, so <em>she’s</em> the one who sent you to kill me?” Agatha says, hopes to soothe Rio's nerves with a quip.</p><p>“Not that,” Rio says, not as placated by Agatha’s words as she’d hoped. They scrunch their eyes closed like saying it without letting any light in will help. And maybe it does because the words spill fast like they’re being pulled from their mouth, “She asked me to tie her up.”</p><p>Huh. Not Agatha’s first guess. Or even her tenth.</p><p>“Rio,” She starts, uses some of the gentleness from her <em>Rio supply,</em> “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. Doesn’t matter how long you’ve been together—”</p><p>“It’s only been six months.” Rio interjects.</p><p>Jesus, fuck. Is that really all it’s been? Feels like years.</p><p>“Break up with her then.” Agatha throws her hands in the air, solution very much obvious to her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says in a tone that tells her they think she’s acting a little insane, “I just wanted some advice.”</p><p>“Advice.”</p><p>“Yeah, like,” Rio’s ears must burn with the color they’ve become, “You’ve done it before, right?”</p><p>“You haven’t?” Rio is her best friend. Agatha loves Rio. But Rio is enormously fun to mess with, and Agatha loves playing with her food, “Didn’t take you for someone so vanilla.”</p><p>Rio is the most fun to mess with because she knows exactly where their boundaries lie, can elicit some sides to Rio most others never see. Such is the benefit of knowing each other from when they were teens, because Rio deliciously bites back with an innocent smile plastered to their face, “Do you often think about me having sex?”</p><p>It takes a lot to stop Agatha in a run, and she’d applaud them if it didn’t mean admitting defeat. She thinks about it for a moment. Okay, so it’s maybe crossed her mind one or two times, but that’s only natural—to wonder who your friend is behind closed doors. So, in the interest of honesty, Agatha, with a shrug says, “Sometimes.” And watches as Rio chokes on the wine they’ve finally decided to have a sip of.</p><p>“Right, well,” Rio clears their throat, wipes their mouth on the sleeve of the well worn sweatshirt they keep in a drawer in Agatha’s bedroom, “Can you help me or not?”</p><p>Agatha huffs, smacks one of Rio’s legs, “I can’t believe I speculated my own murder by your hand and you brand that as only one step lower than dipping your toe into bondage.”</p><p>“Not one step,” Their ears still haven’t returned to their normal color, though they grin, “A few at the very least.”</p><p>“Oh, well that makes me feel so much better, thank you.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha sighs, “Can’t you just google it like everyone else?”</p><p>“I want to get it right,” Rio says, ever in pursuit of perfection and doing things properly, “You have experience. I know you do. What’s better than learning first hand?”</p><p>Agatha hums. Rio’s not wrong exactly. And it’s not like they don’t ever talk about sex. It’s like Rio said—they know she has experience. Is it different to teach them something they’ll use on their girlfriend?</p><p>Fuck, there has to be something wrong with Agatha for the only thing that abates the sickly feeling in her stomach to be the knowledge that she taught Rio this. That even when they use what she shows them on their girlfriend, it’ll be Agatha’s words they recall, Agatha’s hands tying the knots in their mind.</p><p>“I suppose you’re right to come to an expert.” Agatha says, flutters her eyes closed and flips her hair over her shoulder.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio shifts on the couch, digs their toes into Agatha’s side with a toothy grin and wiggles them, speaks over the embarrassing laughter they’ve managed to drag loose from her body, “I wasn’t aware I was in the presence of an <em>expert.”</em></p><p>“Watch it,” Agatha glowers, grabs hold of Rio’s ankle with a firm grip, “Or my instruction might have to be a little more physical.”</p><p>They stop the flailing of their leg, eyes getting a faraway look in them for just a moment before they shake whatever thought had just latched itself to their brain loose. Agatha doesn't want to get into whatever that is and so releases their ankle.</p><p>"I don't know why you don't just tell her you don't know what you're doing."</p><p>"Well, I—" Rio cuts themself off, grimaces, "It's embarrassing when she's done it before."</p><p>"Everyone has to start somewhere." Agatha shrugs, doesn't think poking any sort of fun at Rio will help here.</p><p>Rio pushes their tongue into their cheek and looks away. Clearly that's not all there is to it.</p><p>"Rio…" She doesn't want to have to start pulling teeth.</p><p>And luckily Rio's been on the receiving end of that before because they rub their hands over their face with a groan, and say—muffled, mouth to palm, "I might have told her I've done it before."</p><p>Of course they did.</p><p>"Are you seriously telling me you wouldn't at all judge someone who didn't have any idea what they were doing?" Rio bursts out before she can say anything, "If they tried to tie you up and it like… came apart or something."</p><p>It's perhaps one of the more absurd things she's ever heard Rio say, "Hon, I don't do that." And at Rio's questioning hum, she sighs and says, "I do the tying."</p><p>"Oh," Rio says like this changes everything, "Every time?"</p><p>And Agatha pauses, <em>could</em> lie to Rio, say she's never tried it, that she isn't interested, but, "I've tried it. I don't like being restrained."</p><p>Rio picks at a nonexistent fray in the fabric of the sofa, "What don't you like about it?"</p><p>"I don't like feeling not in control," She chews on her tongue but ultimately can't stop herself from divulging more, "And you know I have no interest in dating, I'm not a person built for love. Anyone I've had some sort of arrangement with… I just—"</p><p>"You don't trust them?" Rio's eyes are wide like that's one of the more devastating things Agatha's ever told them.</p><p>"It's a different kind of trust," Agatha says evenly, wants Rio to understand exactly what she means, "Of course there's trust there. You need it. But I guess you're halfway right, I don't trust them the same way they trust me to do the same thing."</p><p>She smacks Rio's leg again in part to get their attention, but also because she's very much <em>done</em> with this conversation, and then stands, hands decisively on her hips and hopefully looking a lot more confident than she feels.</p><p>"Where are we going?"</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, "Do you think I keep my rope in the living room, do you?"</p><p>Agatha swears she sees Rio's throat bob when they swallow roughly. They stand, rub presumably sweaty palms on their jeans, "I should have had more of that wine."</p><p>"Nope," Agatha says, takes them by the arm and drags them to the stairs, "You need a clear head."</p><p>When they reach the top of the stairs, Rio, in a tone unheard by Agatha before says, "Why, what are you gonna do to me?"</p><p>Agatha slows as she reaches her bedroom, traces fingers across the dips in the wooden door, casts a glance over her shoulder at an eagerly nervous Rio, somehow giving the exact same energy as a dog about to learn a new trick. And in a way, they are.</p><p>"I'm gonna teach you a basic tie," She squints at Rio who's rocking back and forth from their toes to their heels, "What did you think I was gonna do? Tie you up?" She raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"Well, I don't know!" The pitch in Rio's voice is somewhere in the ceiling when Agatha turns back around and leads them into her bedroom.</p><p>It's the wine, Agatha thinks when she crosses the room to her closet, and to the chest she keeps at the bottom, it's the wine that's forcing the image of Rio tied up and underneath…someone—someone less Agatha shaped, into her stupid brain.</p><p>She spends a little more time than she usually would here—faux rifling to find the soft rope her hands made contact with almost immediately. Usually, at this point she's with a partner—has them waiting by the bed, and her hands don't shake when she crosses the room to the closet.</p><p>It's just Rio, she reminds herself. It's just Rio and she's just helping out a friend.</p><p>"Do you <em>want</em> me to tie you up?" Agatha says, turns around, rope in hand, hopes to regain a little of the control with a tease, "Is that why you don't know what you're doing?"</p><p>Rio's eyes bug when she stalks back over to them, flickering between her and the lengths of deep purple rope she's holding, "I, um—"</p><p>"Prefer to be the one all tied up?"</p><p>"No," And this comes with a vigorous shake of their head, but then, "I don't know. I've never tried that either."</p><p>There's something in Agatha's chest—one might confuse this with her heart, but no, it's something else and it tightens to know they've come to Agatha over everyone and everything else.</p><p>"We'll start simple," She says, tease gone, pushes at Rio's shoulder with a single finger to get them to sit on the bed, and then elaborates, "A square knot."</p><p>Agatha passes a second length of rope to Rio, watches them rub the silky material between thumb and forefinger. It's strangely intimate to know the rope in Rio's hands is <em>hers</em>.</p><p>"Like in macramé?"</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>There must be a distinct look of <em>I have no idea what we're talking about</em> on her face for Rio to clarify, "The square knot."</p><p>"Fuck me," Agatha rubs her head, "I forgot about that particular hobby. When was that, the last year of high school?"</p><p>Rio hums and then starts to unravel the rope from the loose wrap Agatha had tied to store it.</p><p>It makes a little more sense to Agatha now—this is just the latest in a long line of hobbies Rio has tried out over the years. And like many of them—the aforementioned macramé, then tennis, pottery, chess, and tabletop gaming, and so on, have all been brought to <em>Agatha</em> specifically with an enthusiastic, <em>"Do you wanna try this with me?"</em></p><p>Of course this newest venture—a hobby they'll inevitably drop—has been brought to Agatha.</p><p>"No, <em>not</em> like in macramé."</p><p>It's a shame that none of Rio's hobbies have ever leaned nautical because they'd have been sure to have come across the basic square knot if they had. Agatha could have been saved the headache this is turning out to be—dizzy whenever she looks to Rio's careful hands and focused eyes wanting to get it right first time.</p><p>They don't rush, they listen to Agatha, and even though this is the bare basics, Agatha feels pride swell in her chest. Stupid, really. But they <em>do</em> get it. Agatha has never taught another person—has had no need since she herself learned; she's not planning on subbing for anyone else again.</p><p>She has to admit—<em>can</em> admit to herself and never aloud—that Rio is a far better student than she ever was. Likely because they actually want to <em>listen</em> and have the respect for the basics that Agatha never had at the beginning—first seeking to give the discomfort she felt being put in that position over anything else.</p><p>Stupid and dangerous. Things gentle Rio with their kind eyes and careful hands is not.</p><p>But after the fundamentals, and Agatha's talks and checks about safewords and aftercare, it's a little harder to teach Rio more than that without—well, either one being tied up.</p><p>And Agatha's prepared to leave it there. She is. Rio has the basics—can do the rest of the research themself.</p><p>But Rio says, <em>What next?</em> And the idea of leaving Rio with less information than they want—especially when she has it herself, is uncomfortable. Agatha thinks to the first time the opportunity was presented to her and she didn't have a clue what she was doing—embarrassing and anxiety inducing, doesn't want Rio to have the same experience.</p><p>The thought of Maria not being as understanding as say, she would be, is ultimately what makes her say, "Do you want me to teach you how to tie someone to the bed frame?" Because even if they admitted to Maria their limited experience, at least it wouldn't be a lie to say that they had <em>some.</em></p><p>As ever, Rio is keen to learn—and especially from Agatha. All of their past hobbies and interests have been things Agatha also doesn't have experience in and so they learn together. This is different.</p><p>"Am I—" Rio cuts their words off, licks their lips as they try to find the words, "Tying you up?"</p><p>And—oh. Agatha hadn't thought about that. But this is Rio. And they're not doing this for real.</p><p>"If you want." She shrugs, hopes to come off mostly aloof.</p><p>"Only if I'm not gonna make you feel uncomfortable." Rio is so earnest, their voice so soft it almost dips into a deep whisper at points.</p><p><em>You could never make me feel uncomfortable,</em> are the words that come to mind when she stares into Rio's eyes, which feels justifiably insane enough to <em>not</em> say them aloud. Instead, Agatha just nods, a slight smile on her lips—closed mouthed in case the too heavy words slip through the cracks.</p><p>And so she scoots up the bed, stays sat up as she talks Rio through first tying the rope safely around her right wrist.</p><p>Agatha pokes fun at Rio's tongue peeking through their teeth in their concentration, and it… feels <em>nice</em> when Rio chuckles, sticks their tongue in their cheek so as not to bite back. It's not scary, doesn't make her feel out of control, doesn't feel like Rio has become a whole different person in order to do this.</p><p>"Is this okay?" They ask, "Not too tight?"</p><p>"No." Agatha says, words heavy from how the wine must have caught up to her a little, <em>feels perfect,</em> she doesn't say.</p><p>And then, under Agatha's watchful eye, her steady instruction, they hitch her to the bed frame. Every new movement warrants a side eye glance towards Agatha, a wordless check in.</p><p>And she must have taught them well—not that she doubted it, what with Rio's eagerness under her own exceptional guidance.</p><p>"What about the other wrist?"</p><p>The words sit between them for a moment, Rio's dumbfounded expression not quite fitting the question. And it's then that Agatha realizes they were <em>her</em> words, in <em>her</em> tender tone.</p><p>Rio nods after a second and—<em>fuck—</em>Agatha could quite easily backtrack, play it off as a joke. But she doesn't find the panic that commonly bubbles up from the depths of her stomach when a partner who likes to switch asks a question in the same vein. So she doesn't take it back.</p><p>"What's your safeword?" It's throws her—has Agatha half thinking they're joking. Not a lot with Rio is a joke unless explicit.</p><p>Agatha laughs, "We're not doing this for real. We don't need one."</p><p>But Rio isn't mollified by her words, "You're the one who said having an established safeword was important for <em>any</em> level of bondage."</p><p>They're right—Agatha did say that, "But this isn't—" She cuts herself off with a harsh swallow, doesn't know why sharing this with Rio feels <em>bigger.</em></p><p>"Agatha," Rio leans towards her almost like they're going to bump their head into her like a cat would, "We don't have to do this. You could always do it on me, I'm sure I can learn that way."</p><p>It's tempting.</p><p>"Or you could tie me up after, if you wanted," Rio's big hand heavy but not stifling on her thigh, "Maybe something more complicated, and then we'll be even."</p><p>Agatha knows what they're doing—appealing to her ego, her love of performing. In layman's terms, she's a show-off.</p><p>"Purple." She says, eyes on the rope conveniently colored the same. She's not sure she's thinking when she says it. It's not her typical safeword. It feels <em>dirty</em> almost, to use the same word she uses for her hookups in a tame, <em>teaching</em> situation. It feels <em>wrong</em> to use the same word with <em>Rio.</em></p><p>"Purple." Rio nods, brings their hand up to run the tips of their fingers over the rope cuff around Agatha’s wrist, "Another color. Makes sense." They say, unaware that this is has been inadvertently chosen just for them.</p><p>"And you remember the traffic light system?"</p><p>"Green means everything is good and keep going. Yellow is slow down and check in. Red is to stop because you've hit your limit." Rio's hand shifts so from the rope so that they're holding Agatha's hand. Agatha closes her fingers around their palm.</p><p>"And if I say purple?"</p><p>"We stop play entirely." Rio says, no hesitation.</p><p><em>We</em> stop play entirely. She knows it's not what Rio meant but the implication sits heavy in Agatha's stomach. She thinks she can almost feel it curdling. <em>Is</em> it curdling?</p><p>Agatha nods, licks her lips and watches it play out in the mirror of Rio's own face—an accidental mimic.</p><p>It doesn't seem like Rio's quite ready to take initiative, so she tilts her head back, extends her left hand towards the bed post and says, a little like she's commanding a dog, "Rio, green."</p><p>It's this that snaps Rio into action. Agatha watches them swallow, nod once like they're building themself up. And then they take the second length of rope and methodically wrap Agatha's wrist.</p><p>"Feels strange." They say when they're making sure the rope is neat and flat against her skin.</p><p>"Do you not like it?" Agatha narrows her eyes, wishes she could get inside Rio's mind and walk the paths of their brain.</p><p>"Not that," Rio clarifies and then when they've finished their tie, looks to Agatha and says, "Color?"</p><p>There's no doubt, "Green."</p><p>And so Rio works on hitching her second wrist to the bed frame.</p><p>"Doing this with you."</p><p>Agatha hums, taken from her quiet mind at Rio's words. She racks her brain, "It's strange?" She says, eventually remembers Rio's words before.</p><p>"It's strange that it's <em>not</em> strange." They say, and then back away, eyes tracing over the wrist and then snap to the other one, admiring their handiwork.</p><p>Agatha bites her tongue when it comes to her agreement—doesn't want to get into thinking about why the fuck this isn't scary to her. Even more so when Rio says, "Did I do it right? Can you get out?" And Agatha pulls against her restraints, finds that she can't. Finds too, that her heart keeps its same rhythm following the realization.</p><p>She wordlessly shakes her head, even though Rio is watching her every move with the attention of an animal tracking prey.</p><p>"Now what?"</p><p>Agatha laughs, "I hope you don't have to ask that when you tie <em>her</em> up."</p><p>She enjoys the flush on Rio's cheeks at her words, "No, I—" They clear their throat, "I just didn't know if we were done. I know what I'd do if this was real," They say, then eyes go wide as saucers, "Not with you. I meant with—"</p><p>"Yeah, I know."</p><p>Agatha doesn't really need to be thinking about Maria right now. Not when she's allowed, for the first time in years, someone to tie her up. Doesn't need her steady vulnerability shaken up.</p><p>"Yeah, you could leave it here, with just the wrists," Agatha clears her throat, "Or you could do ankles too. It's up to you. The sex doesn't have to be much different just because your partner is restrained. You can do things you'd usually do and their senses will be heightened."</p><p>"That makes sense," Rio nods, "I guess I should—" And they nod towards a wrist.</p><p>Agatha wiggles her fingers in invitation and Rio carefully unties her, checks over each wrist when they're free, softly touches the skin where there are the faintest of marks.</p><p>"Do you want me to rub them?" They say, stare down at the skin.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, comes back to herself a little—can hear the film they'd been watching and had forgotten to turn off before coming upstairs. It's near the end, she thinks. The street sounds a little busier than usual—she can hear cars rolling past outside the window. All of this was lost to her before. Maybe <em>not</em> due to the wine then, but it's not something Agatha wants to think about right now.</p><p>"I'm gonna show you a more complicated tie, aren't I?" Agatha picks up one of the lengths of rope, enjoys the sharpening in her mind as she does, "I don't like to confuse my brain with aftercare mid session. You <em>can</em> though—if that's right for you."</p><p>Rio nods, lets Agatha's words sink in. Agatha likes that—how willing Rio is to learn, never trying to skip ahead. They're a natural, and if their girlfriend is more experienced, like Rio said, then she's going to have fun expanding on Rio's basic knowledge.</p><p>Agatha is maybe the only one who <em>won't</em> have fun—which is a strange thought to have. It <em>has</em> been a while since she did this with another person. Actually, it's been a while since she <em>fucked</em> someone else. She really needs to rectify that because she's starting to lose it a little.</p><p>"How do you want me, then?" They ask, ready for Agatha to do whatever.</p><p>"Can I tie your ankles to your thighs?" Agatha says, touches lightly to one of Rio's ankles, "It's one of my favorites."</p><p>Rio nods like they have nothing to think of, "Of course."</p><p>Agatha gathers her rope, "Can you kneel for me?"</p><p>Rio does, "Like this?"</p><p>Agatha looks them over, "On your toes, please." She says, taps the bottom of Rio's sock covered foot.</p><p>Rio huffs a laugh as they shift, rocking forward on their knees so that they can sit with their toes under them a little. Agatha gets halfway through murmuring her thanks when Rio says, grin evident just through their voice alone, "You're so polite."</p><p>Agatha scoffs, "I can be mean if you want," Swats Rio's thigh even though it's through the thick material of their pants, "A lot of people like that and I'm <em>very</em> good at it."</p><p>Agatha, facing Rio side on, gets the ego swelling view of her best friend's face reddening at her words—they probably <em>do</em> like a mean femme, if Agatha had to guess. Unfortunately, Agatha thinks, unfortunately they'd probably be compatible in bed.</p><p>She swallows that thought down. It must be leftover from whatever weird shit was going on in her mind when she was tied to her own headboard. Traitorous, fuzzy brained head demons.</p><p>She starts looping the rope around Rio's right thigh and ankle—the angle better now on Rio's slightly raised leg.</p><p>"No—I—I'm okay." Rio stammers even though their cheeks retain a lovely blush. Agatha shifts her eyes up for a second, just to catch how Rio watches her work, almost mesmerized.</p><p>"What are you thinking?" Agatha asks—almost doesn't when a sick little voice tells her Rio's thinking about how to do this on…<em>her.</em></p><p>"How good this would look against skin." Rio's voice comes out a little breathy, and Agatha doesn't know which is worse: thinking about Rio with their skin exposed, rope cutting patterns into it, or thinking about <em>Rio</em> thinking about <em>Maria</em> like that.</p><p>(Only one of those options leaves an acidic burning in her throat when she thinks of it, and worryingly it isn't the one where she's thinking of her naked best friend.)</p><p>She distracts herself with an affirmatory hum, even though she's not quite sure what she's agreeing with, and finishes off the tie on Rio's right thigh. She quickly moves round the bed to make a start on the other side when Rio gives an eager <em>green.</em></p><p>There's less talking on the second tie, and Agatha's experienced enough that it doesn't take long for both of Rio's legs to be properly bound.</p><p>They're staring down at themself with a look Agatha understandably has never seen on her friend, but recognizes as clear, unfiltered arousal. And maybe this <em>isn't</em> just about Maria after all. Agatha can't help the twitch of her lip.</p><p>Rio looks up then, catches Agatha watching them, narrows their eyes and then, to take focus from their face where they're sure to know Agatha's taking pleasure in staring at, they say, throat thick, "What position do you like when you do this?"</p><p>This feels like some sort of test. And Agatha is <em>good</em> at tests, which is handy because she doesn't like not being good at things right away. And that's why she has to pause—because what if she gets this wrong?</p><p>There's something in their eyes so <em>earnest</em> that the words, "Can I get you to move?" Come spilling from Agatha's lips before she's had chance to think it through.</p><p>But Rio is nodding like this is all perfectly normal, and so Agatha helps them to tip forward, ass up, chest near to the mattress, watches short nails bite into the skin at the tip of their thumbs.</p><p>"Clasp your forearms for me." Agatha says, would request something like this anyway, but if it gets Rio to stop anxiously digging into their skin then that's another win, "Color?" She asks, just to be sure.</p><p>Rio waits until they've done as Agatha asked before they give another <em>green.</em> They <em>do</em> look a little more relaxed now.</p><p>"Good," Agatha's heart thumps heavily in her chest—unique to just this one time with Rio, "Wouldn't want you touching when I haven't allowed it."</p><p>Agatha swears she hears a poorly held back whimper escape from Rio's lips, but she shakes the thought away.</p><p>"How does it feel?"</p><p>Rio clears their throat, shifts their hips as they think. Agatha isn't a patient person—wouldn't be this lenient with someone else, someone she doesn't care about. With Rio, she would wait forever.</p><p>(And if she happens to notice the stretch of Rio's jeans across their ass, happens to lean a little further back to appreciate it further, no one needs to know but her. She's never looked before, she <em>swears,</em> but there's no time like the present.)</p><p>"The tie is fine," They say eventually, sand-papery words, "Nice. I can see why people like it."</p><p>"But not you?" Agatha says, touches a hesitant hand to one of theirs, gripping hold of their own arm.</p><p>Again, Agatha is patient, doesn't ask again, doesn't force an answer. Fuck, is this what it's like when you <em>care</em> about someone?</p><p>"It's more the position."</p><p>Hm. There's a lot they don't talk about to do with their sex lives, so maybe this makes sense now that she's <em>allowed</em> to think about it. "Color?" She asks again.</p><p>From Rio's throat comes a tentative little noise.</p><p>"I won't be mad. It's important to be honest so we both have a good time," And then she realizes exactly what she's just said, "You and whoever you're doing this with, I mean."</p><p>Which is just a fantastic save said in such a normal, unwavering tone. It's just good that Rio is otherwise preoccupied with their own thoughts for now. "Color?" She prompts again, when Rio's had time to process her words.</p><p>This time, Rio's voice is sure, "Yellow."</p><p>"Can I change the position to have you on your back?"</p><p>"Yeah." Their voice is breathy, relief evident, and they let go of the grip they have of their own arms to push themself over.</p><p>"Better?"</p><p>"I think."</p><p>"You think?"</p><p>And in the spirit of the honesty Agatha's been promoting this evening, Rio rambles, "It depends what you're gonna do. I mean—not you, obviously. But like, if I was like this for someone else," They stop to briefly choke on their tongue, and still Agatha's patience persists, "I can't help but imagine something happening with me like this. So I'm green right now because we're not having sex, but maybe I'd be yellow if we were. I'd wanna know what you were gonna do to me."</p><p>Agatha knows the <em>you</em> doesn't actually mean her—she's not stupid, and so she chooses to ignore that for Rio's sake.</p><p>But she does hazard a guess as to why, "You like to touch more than be touched?"</p><p>Rio nods. More of a shuffle that messes up the hair at the back of their head from the half up half down tie that their relatively short hair has been pulled back in.</p><p>"So, <em>not</em> a butch bottom then," Agatha heaves out an over dramatic sigh, and then in a sing-song voice rings out, "Boring."</p><p>God, she almost feels bad for enjoying the flush that goes from cheeks to ears, but she can't really help it.</p><p>"Bet you like wearing the strap, right?" She says, grin curling. And it's amusing to watch Rio's eyes bug out of their head but there <em>is</em> a purpose to this: she wants to show them the benefits of not having to <em>bottom</em> while subbing.</p><p>Rio chokes out an affirmation, and so Agatha carries on.</p><p>"What if you were strapped up," Agatha starts, voice dropping somewhere sultry, below where the bounds of friendship flirting stops, "And the base of your cock wasn't <em>quite</em> where you need it. We could tie your arms up too." Agatha shifts to straddle Rio's hips—just so they get the proper image, remains hovering above them, "Color?" She asks again, wants to make sure this is okay, that she's on the right lines too.</p><p><em>"Green."</em> Rio gasps like they're <em>getting</em> it, and the tipping point for Agatha's brain to snap apart from her mouth, her body, is seeing Rio's arms immediately reach up to the headboard, like they know it would please Agatha.</p><p>And, <em>fuck,</em> for some reason it does.</p><p>"What if I rode you til I came, over and over and over again, and you had no part in it," She's careful not to press back into Rio's crotch, which is hard when her hips want to move to her own words. She leans over, one hand next to Rio's shoulder in the mattress and holding herself up, while the other comes to firmly grip Rio's chin, smiles—all teeth, "Just a glorified toy for me to use."</p><p>Rio is panting, chest heaving, and honeyed eyes swallowed almost wholly by palpable arousal. She tracks a bead of sweat that drips from their temple.</p><p><em>"Yeah."</em></p><p>Agatha watches in real time the way Rio's brow furrows when she shoves herself off their hips, plasters a smile on her face, and swallows past the lump in her throat, "Something like that is more your thing, probably."</p><p>Probably. Like Agatha couldn't fucking tell. Like she doesn't know something incredibly intimate about someone she's been friends with for longer than she's able to stomach most people.</p><p>Rio lets go of the headboard, props themself up on their elbows. Agatha doesn't feel guilty often, but she knows it's because of her that Rio can't look her in the eye.</p><p>"I think I get why people like it now."</p><p>Agatha nods and for a moment is uncharacteristically lost for words, "I think that's enough for you to get by on." She manages to force out.</p><p>"Yeah," Rio shakes their head, looks a little more cognizant after, "Yeah, thank you."</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had sort of expected Rio to leave after that—an awkward exit that they hadn't experienced since they were young and prone to hormonal outbursts.</p><p>But Rio stayed, insisted on rewinding the film and staying until it finished. They didn't talk much, and Rio would have rather looked anywhere in the room but Agatha's face for the rest of the night. But they stayed, nonetheless, sock covered feet on the sofa—the only one of Agatha's friends who's allowed to do that, and pressed them into Agatha's thigh like everything is normal.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>And everything <em>is</em> normal.</p><p>That remained the only night of its kind. Agatha didn't even ask whether they've used what she taught them.</p><p>(Though avoiding a conversation about Maria isn't too much of a hardship.)</p><p>And it's definitely normal for her mind to slip back there sometimes, even months later.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes a story gets a little convoluted. Especially when Agatha is telling it.</p><p>Especially when Agatha is lying.</p><p>But Agatha, hand on heart and hope her mother dies, or however the saying goes, for once isn't lying when she says that's about all the build up there is.</p><p>To fill in the very minor gaps between the <em>then</em> of running Shibari 101, and the <em>now</em> of being face down, ass up on the center of her own bed, with her arms fed between her thighs, wrists tied to her lower legs in a <em>very</em> confident tie, Agatha's rampant brain has to break this down into easily comprehensible bite sized chunks.</p><p>It is, admittedly, a little hard to think when she's tied as she is. Maybe her blood is rushing to her head, she thinks, though realistically she knows Rio has made sure to prop her comfortably up with cushions under her upper body so that, and any unnecessary discomfort, is lessened.</p><p>This doesn't mean anything, so why does the thought of Rio learning beyond what Agatha had taught them repulse her?</p><p>Either way, the real, honest-to-god facts are;</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Rio and Maria broke up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a subsection to that, Agatha gets to stop referring to them as <em>Mario</em> in her head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rio came to <em>her</em> right after after it happened—which shouldn't be much of a shock but Rio hasn't been in her house since the night they delved into bondage together. As friends. For teaching reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rio <em>laughed</em> when they divulged that the only reason they stayed together for as long as they did was because of stupid Agatha and her stupid lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agatha made the mistake of saying, <em>"Oh, so you think you're a dom now? Last time you were here I had you whimpering underneath me."</em> Which is not something Agatha had ever thought of saying to Rio before, and probably should never have left her mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As she's on a roll with verbal mistakes this evening, why wouldn't she also say a resounding <em>yes</em> when Rio asked, <em>"Would you like me to prove it?"</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And yet another one when she said a joking <em>of course</em> to Rio's joking <em>do you want to take your clothes off?</em></p>
</li>
</ol><p>And so, here she is—Rio fitting their fingers between rope and skin like someone good, and kind, and respectful, and not at all like the overcompensating doms of Agatha's early twenties. Agatha, stripped down to just her underwear and a thin tank, can only thank unhearing gods that she likes to treat herself to nice things, and wearing lace is a regular thing for her.</p><p>It's been a long time since Agatha was on the receiving end of any rope play, but Rio—the person she trusts most in the world, has made quick, habitual passes of the rope around her body, all while making light conversation about their fucking work week, <em>and</em> checking in with her on what fucking color she is.</p><p>She's green. So fucking green it's ridiculous.</p><p>She can feel her heart <em>everywhere,</em> feels it beat harder and harder the closer Rio gets to finishing their tie. Because what happens when it's finished? <em>Fuck,</em> this would all be so much easier if this was anyone but Rio. But then again, Agatha would have shut this down at the first insinuation if it <em>was</em> anyone but Rio.</p><p>(It's always been the same with the pair of them—Agatha's never known how to back down from a challenge issued by Rio. She doesn't know what Rio's excuse for suggesting this is.)</p><p>She'd been sort of waiting for Rio to chicken out—hadn't thought it would go this far. She'd watched their throat constrict, their eyes widen when she started peeling her clothes off, and half expected them to nervously laugh like they often do, avert their gaze with a hand on her forearm to stop her. But she hadn't been stopped. And more importantly—more <em>worryingly,</em> she hadn't <em>wanted</em> to be stopped.</p><p>So that's where Agatha's at right now—trying to come to terms with the fact she's enjoying being tied up for the first time in a <em>long</em> while, and also trying to keep the repeated <em>I'm wet, I can feel it sticking to me, Rio can probably fucking see it,</em> thoughts from sluicing from her brain.</p><p>"Agatha?" Rio's voice finds a gap in the stream. They sound careful, a little worried. It's only then that she realizes she's been hearing them speak to her for maybe a minute now, their voice like a soft blanket.</p><p>Agatha doesn't get tongue tied often, but it seems to sit too heavy in her mouth, offers a hum as her only response.</p><p>"We don't have to do anything." Rio says, and Agatha wonders if that's what they've both been thinking this whole time. Does Rio even want that or are they just humoring Agatha? Proving a point and nothing else.</p><p>"Do anything?" She forces out, unsticks her tongue from the roof of her mouth as she tries to regain the upper hand she's pretty sure she's solidly lost in the time she's spent not even slightly fighting Rio tying her up. She's a fucking embarrassment, she's aware. "What did you think we were gonna do?"</p><p>"I mean," Rio sounds too amused for Agatha's liking, "You're the one who took your clothes off."</p><p>"You're the one who asked." Agatha hisses.</p><p>"I didn't think—" Rio cuts themself off, and Agatha's heart thuds with the thought that maybe Rio hadn't meant for her to go through with it, "I didn't think you'd say yes."</p><p>She's going to have to change her name and move somewhere far away when Rio unties her.</p><p>"Way to embarrass the woman who you've got naked and tied up." Agatha turns her head, speaks her words into the sheets under her while her face burns.</p><p>She just about hears Rio muttering, "Not <em>fully</em> naked." And is about to snarl back when Rio says, to her rather than themself this time, "Do you want me to untie you?"</p><p><em>Yes,</em> Agatha wants to want to say.</p><p>She doesn't, of course. Doesn't say no either.</p><p>"Do <em>you</em> want to untie me?"</p><p>"I don't—" Rio stammers, sounds much more like how she thought Rio would be in this situation, "I don't know."</p><p>From the safety of freshly washed linen, Agatha breathes deep, allows little things like <em>consequences</em> to leak from her mind, leaves herself only with the thoughts of Rio touching her, spreading her open, taking her apart. She's never thought of Rio like this before. Sure, she's been barraged with images of what they might like in bed when she knows Rio's on a respectable date number three or higher, but she's never thought about Rio in bed with <em>her.</em></p><p>It's the only thing rattling around her brain right now.</p><p>"God, Rio," She breathes, and the whine in her voice that would usually mortify her gets thrown out the same window as those pesky consequences, "Either fucking touch me or untie me."</p><p>"Sweetheart," Rio says, voice soft. They've never called her that before and it ping pongs around Agatha's empty mind. A comforting hand is placed on her lower back, "I don't want you to do something you'll regret."</p><p>"I <em>won't</em> regret it, fucking hell," Agatha should be impressed with Rio's ties—this <em>was</em> the initial purpose of all of this, but she can only grit her teeth when she tries to close her legs, get some sort of friction to her pulsing cunt, but <em>can't</em> with the way Rio's tied her arms to the inside of her legs, "You're the only one who's had me like this in a long time. I know what I'm doing."</p><p>"You don't think we should talk about this first?"</p><p>"What?" Agatha scoffs, sways her hips and hopes to god Rio's an ass guy, "You gonna untie me just for me to say 'yeah, Rio,'" She exaggerates, just for them, "'I want you to fuck me' and then tie me right back up again?"</p><p>"Agatha…"</p><p>"I want this," She says, plainly, "And it's fine if you don't. I understand. But if you're only holding back because you think I'll regret it in the morning…" She trails off, racks her brain for something to soothe Rio's overworking brain with, "Rio, I'm green."</p><p>It takes a minute for Rio to answer—brain quite obviously cracking and sparking, but then, "You want this." They say in a way that sounds more like a realization sinking in than a question.</p><p>"Do you?" Agatha throws the ball right back in their court.</p><p>Rio nods their head like there couldn't have been a different answer, "Yeah."</p><p>The words and what it means for them sit heavy between them, and so Agatha, just to make Rio laugh, tilts her head so she's not speaking into the mattress, "What's a little bondage between friends?"</p><p>It works—Rio huffing out from their nose in a way Agatha can picture their exact face, chin pressed to chest to hide their smile, eyes closed like looking at Agatha will set them off into hysterical laughter.</p><p>Once it passes, Rio steps round into view, crouches down in front of her and tenderly cups her face in their gentle hands. Agatha blinks a few times—nowhere to look but at Rio, and <em>fuck,</em> does it feel more real now. "We're doing this?"</p><p>But Agatha's no good for <em>tender</em> and so says, "If by <em>this</em> you mean fucking me through the mattress 'til I can't feel my legs, then I hope so."</p><p>Something flashes behind Rio's eyes and they grin, "If that's what you want." And then plant a soft kiss to Agatha's cheek—one that leaves her eyelids fluttering in time with her heart, before retreating back to behind Agatha.</p><p>She feels the bed dip under their weight and then their hand—the one that had rested comfortably on her back, lands firmly on her ass this time, palms the flesh in their unyielding grip.</p><p>"Rio—" She gasps, which is incredibly stupid because Rio's barely even touched her, but she can't fucking help it.</p><p>"I was trying to be very normal and respectful when I was tying you up," Agatha feels a solitary finger slowly trace the inside of her thigh, runs alongside the seam of her underwear, surely brushing through the thick hair that spills out onto her thighs, "But it was hard with you all squirmy and so obviously turned on," Agatha tries to roll her eyes but her body won't commit to it, and then decides the intention is good enough because Rio can't even see her face from this angle, "I bet I can feel how wet you are through these."</p><p>And when they say those words, the knuckle of that finger nudges up against her covered cunt.</p><p>Agatha can hear the smug grin in their voice when they hum and say, "Thought so."</p><p>"Rio, just touch me." She gets out through gritted teeth, tries to push herself back into the light touch as much as she can, doesn't get very far with it.</p><p>But Rio, thank fucking god, does something even better—peels her underwear slowly down her legs until they're at her knees and can't go any further, and then with both thumbs, spreads her open.</p><p><em>"Shit."</em> Agatha reburies her head in the sheets at the touch. She feels so exposed. It feels so <em>dirty.</em> It's exactly what she needs.</p><p><em>"Jesus,"</em> Rio whines, and if Agatha's brain was currently able to build sentences more complex than <em>fuck me, fuck me, fuck me,</em> then she'd probably say something like, <em>no Jesus here.</em> "I bet it wouldn't take much to have you dripping onto your sheets."</p><p><em>Where</em> has all of this been hiding?</p><p>Agatha's grip on the situation—her internal reassurance that she'll regain the upper hand when she gets her clothes off, when she bends over, when Rio touches her, when they see how desperate her cunt is to be touched by them—is quickly fading.</p><p>"Put your fingers inside me and prove it then." She hisses, unused to not being able to <em>take</em> her pleasure at will.</p><p>"You're so feisty." Rio says like they're talking to a fucking wet kitten, but before Agatha gets a chance to fight back—almost like they've timed it to perfection—the moment she opens her mouth the only thing that comes out of it is a pathetic whimper as they push the tips of two fingers just barely inside her.</p><p><em>"More."</em></p><p>Rio, once again, doesn't do as she asks. And that's yet another thing she's not used to, because Rio usually takes a request, a command, a plea from Agatha like a dog does from its owner.</p><p>Instead, they pull their fingers from inside her and make some soft touches to the outside of her cunt, pads of fingertips stroking over her in exploratory passes, making sure to avoid her clit. They even drag their fingers through the thick hair between her legs, and Agatha just has to fucking <em>let them.</em></p><p>This is undoubtedly the very last time she allows herself to sub for anyone. It's awful. She doesn't know why anyone does it.</p><p>This one particular thought does of course come undone when Rio's clearly mapped every part of her—sans clit—enough to possibly recreate her pussy in oil painting form, and they finally give her exactly what she wants.</p><p>Rio's fingers are longer, a little thicker than her own. She knows because they've measured them before. Palm to palm and fingers stretching as much as they can when they were young and stupid in school and imitating their friend Wanda with the weird transfer student she ended up making her husband, and subsequently bringing into Agatha's home because she's still friends with all these freaks.</p><p>If they <em>hadn't</em> done any of that, she'd be finding out now—with Rio sliding two fingers deep inside her to the fucking knuckle right away. Agatha digs her forehead into the bed at the feeling that's <em>so</em> much more than two of her own.</p><p>"You took them so easy, baby."</p><p><em>Baby, baby, baby, baby—</em></p><p>The pet name rings from one ear to the other and back again. An accident, she's sure—caught up in the moment and the sex of it all.</p><p>"That's because it's only two fingers, Rio." She makes a point of calling Rio by their actual fucking name like a normal person.</p><p>"Are you usually this argumentative when you're getting fucked?"</p><p>Rio punctuates their words with a curl of their fingers that drops Agatha's jaw. She's just glad they're behind her and can't see the way she chews on the bed sheet for a moment before she all but growls, "I'm usually in control of when I get fucked."</p><p>And still no let up from Rio who starts up a delicious rhythm, slow and deep. Their only response is a fake sympathetic <em>poor baby</em> as they use their other hand to grab her ass cheek and spread her open to watch how she takes their fingers.</p><p>"If I weren't tied up—"</p><p>"You'd what?" Rio pulls their fingers all the way out, and before Agatha can start up another complaint, fits a third alongside them and slowly pushes back in, cresting argument breaking softly in her throat, "You'd pin me down and ride my fingers?"</p><p>They push in as deep as they can—three feeling <em>a lot</em> more than she's used to taking from fingers alone, "You'd have already come at least once, maybe twice by now? The thing is, Agatha," They lean over her back, keep their fingers stilled deep inside, "I'd fucking enjoy it. But that's not what you wanted."</p><p><em>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</em></p><p>An overwhelmed tear slips from the corner of her eye. They're right. Of course they're right. Agatha Harkness never does anything she doesn't want, and she wants <em>this.</em></p><p><em>"Rio."</em></p><p>"It's okay, baby," There they go again—<em>baby, baby, baby—</em>but Agatha doesn't have time to think about it before Rio's snaking a hand under her stomach and seeking out her clit, "I've got you."</p><p>They circle her clit like they've known her body for longer than just tonight, expertly bringing Agatha instantly close to the edge. It's lethal—the heady combination of the tie, and the position, and the thick fingers, and the rubbing on her clit has her—</p><p>"Gonna come. <em>Fuck,</em> Rio, I'm gonna fucking come."</p><p>Rio gasps against the sweat soaked skin of Agatha's back, "Did I say you could?" But doesn't do anything to slow her down.</p><p>"Rio, Rio, <em>fuck,</em> let me <em>come."</em></p><p>Rio licks up her back—fucking freak, "Are you gonna ask nicely?"</p><p>Agatha thinks she might puncture a hole through her lip with how hard she bites it in an attempt to keep quiet.</p><p>"No?" Rio's voice is sickly sweet and Agatha knows exactly why when they stop all movements, and then horrifically removes their fingers from her clit, and pull out from her cunt until Agatha's empty and clenching around nothing but air, "That's fine, sweetheart, I can wait."</p><p>"No, no, Rio, I need it." Agatha's fingers flex open like she has any chance of reaching out, grabbing Rio, and bringing them back where they belong.</p><p>"You can have it," Rio says, and tortures Agatha further by letting her hear them very obviously sucking their fingers into their mouth, "You just have to ask nicely. It's so easy."</p><p><em>Shit.</em> Agatha squeezes her eyes tightly shut, and then very reluctantly lets out a small, <em>"Please."</em></p><p>"Sorry, what was that?"</p><p>"Do <em>not</em> make me say it again."</p><p>She says it and fuck, does she want to stick by it, but then Rio brings their fingers back to press against her entrance, and like before, pushes only the tips inside her.</p><p><em>"Please,</em> I need you.<em>"</em> Agatha's eyes remain closed, waits for Rio to ridicule and mock her, but it never comes. Instead, they press a soft kiss to her side—as close to her stomach as the angle allows, before pushing back inside her, fingers reaching round for her clit again.</p><p>She'd like to say it took longer than a minute, but as her orgasm crashes over her Agatha finds she lacks the capacity to lie.</p><p>"You look so good when you come." Rio sounds a little in awe when they pull out, which—good. As it should be.</p><p>"Yeah? Make me do it again then."</p><p>Agatha hears Rio laugh just a little and then their face comes into view, "Do you need to change position?"</p><p>Hm. Agatha takes stock of her body, "I'm good."</p><p>"You're sure?" Rio's eyes rake over Agatha's whole body. She wonders if they've been watching her this closely the whole time, watching for any indication of discomfort.</p><p>They're so sincere about it that Agatha doesn't even have it in her to be cruel when she says, "I can call yellow if I'm not."</p><p>Rio nods, settled, but looks suddenly like they have no idea what they're supposed to do next. Agatha doesn't think it's worth trying to make herself feel bad for her ego swelling at the thought of stupid <em>Marlene</em> or whoever not going for another round.</p><p>But before any of that, much more importantly, Agatha notices how Rio's still fully dressed—the real downside to starting the bondage side of their relationship before the sex side, "Rio, let me see you."</p><p>They blink at her like they hadn't expected this, but it maybe shouldn't be surprising that Rio had thought she'd prioritize herself this much. That would usually be the case, but today she wants to <em>look,</em> especially if she can't touch. Especially if this is the only time they're going to do this. And she expects it will be.</p><p>"Oh, uh…" Rio fiddles with the hem of their t-shirt before pulling it over their head in one quick motion like they're ripping off a band-aid. They make sure to keep themself in Agatha's eye line, which is much appreciated because she gets a delicious view of Rio's abs and their taped chest.</p><p>Agatha <em>knows</em> what Rio's got going on under their clothes, but knowing and seeing are different things entirely. They live different lives, have no reason to be <em>changing</em> in front of each other like at the sleepovers they regularly had when they were younger—Rio's parents more than happy to have Agatha over, and Agatha more than happy to get away from her mother.</p><p><em>God,</em> Agatha wants her mouth on them.</p><p>It's a very cruel thought to have materialize when she's restrained the way she is.</p><p>She watches, eagle eyed as they push their jeans down their thighs, takes in every inch of skin that gets exposed. She'll settle for looking, just for now.</p><p>"You remember where I keep my toy chest, right?" Agatha says to stop herself from saying something like <em>let me suck bruises into your skin.</em></p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"How about you go and strap up while I stay here and look pretty?"</p><p>A weird gurgling sound leaves Rio's throat that <em>could</em> be some sort of <em>okay</em> if the way they dart across the room is any indication. Agatha's head empties as she listens to Rio rummaging through the chest and mumbling to themself.</p><p>"Do you have a preference?"</p><p>Since apparently tonight is meant to be about Agatha letting go, she tells them to decide.</p><p>"You have a lot," Agatha laughs at how daunted by this task Rio sounds, "I didn't think you topped all that often."</p><p>Agatha huffs at the admittedly correct assumption. "Those are for <em>me,"</em> She clarifies, "I'm so sick of people claiming they have a dick big enough and then disappointing me."</p><p>"Oh." Is all Rio says, but from the sound, Agatha thinks they're focusing on putting the harness on properly. It's <em>weird</em> not knowing what's going on behind her. A gentle touch to her hip lets Agatha know that Rio's back, and any nerves die down. "Do you—" Rio cuts themself off with a cough, the telltale sign of their own embarrassment, "Um, do you use <em>all</em> of those things?"</p><p>Agatha has no idea what they're referring to that's got them all flustered when they've already used her own rope to tie her up, but <em>yes</em> she has used everything she owns, and her brain is a little too mushy to try to pick just one thing apart from the lot, "Well, they're <em>mine,</em> aren't they?"</p><p>Agatha <em>hears</em> Rio's gulp from behind her and she grins into the sheets below her. God, they're so <em>easy.</em></p><p>The smile slips from her face, becomes a more pleasure filled, open mouthed thing when Rio nudges the tip of their cock against her.</p><p><em>"Yes,</em> Rio." Her hands flex again, not even a purposeful movement but she can't help it, wants Rio in deep, wants their hips pressed up against her, wants to feel even the slightest amount of skin beneath her fingertips with how close they are.</p><p>"You want it?" Rio asks like it hasn't all been leading up to this. Like it's not <em>obvious</em> how much Agatha wants to be fucking split open. She's about to say just that when Rio groans, "Shit, I didn't grab lube."</p><p>Agatha, for lack of being able to reach anything else, digs sharp nails into her own legs, "Rio," She sighs, exasperated and fucking turned on because Rio hasn't pulled away, still has the tip of the strap resting at her entrance like they're fucking <em>teasing</em> her, "I'm so fucking wet. If you dare leave to go grab lube I swear I will tear through this rope and kill you with my bare hands."</p><p>She must sound convincing enough to Rio because they don't even try to argue, grab hold of Agatha's hips and slowly, carefully pushes inside.</p><p>Agatha feels herself stretch for Rio to fit—a mind numbing feeling. There are benefits to this, she supposes, doesn't have to do anything but lie there and take it, easily putting her trust in Rio.</p><p>"You look so good like this," Rio gasps, fingers twitching on Agatha's hips, "You know when you had me bent over," They say almost conversationally, wait for Agatha's brain to cast back to when this was just friendly advice, "All I could think about was having <em>you</em> like that."</p><p><em>Fuck.</em></p><p><em>"Rio—"</em> She wants to respond properly but all that's running through her head is <em>Rio, Rio, Rio.</em> Can't think of anything but them and the way their hips slot firmly against her ass when they finish speaking.</p><p>Nothing else leaves her lips, nothing else <em>can</em> with the way Rio pulls back out and starts up head-emptying thrusts that get just a little faster each time. All Agatha knows is the feeling of Rio filling her up perfectly, over and over again.</p><p><em>"God,</em> it's like I can feel you." Rio gasps out when Agatha's mind is almost getting used to the only sounds being harsh pants, and gasps, and the sound of her own cunt.</p><p>"Feels good?"</p><p>"Yeah, baby," One of Rio's hands leaves her hip to stroke over her stomach, "It's like you were made for this."</p><p><em>Yes,</em> Agatha's demon brain hisses, <em>yes—made for Rio.</em></p><p>It only takes Rio sliding their hand from Agatha's stomach to her clit, rubbing a few quick circles around it, for Agatha's eyes to roll into the back of her head as she comes.</p><p>It takes a moment for Agatha's brain to catch her back up, her cunt still full and taking Rio's now irregular and frantic thrusts.</p><p><em>"Baby,"</em> Rio whines, "I'm so close, I'm so—"</p><p>Rio's fingers slip from her clit as they use that hand to hold themself up. She doesn't even need it—hurtling towards another orgasm at breakneck pace.</p><p>"Rio, <em>please."</em> Agatha hears herself gasp, wet and needy, doesn't even know what she's pleading <em>for,</em> just knows it's something only Rio can give her.</p><p>Rio slots their hips against Agatha, presses in deep and grinds themself against her ass as they come, a deep moan falling from their throat. It's this—knowing Rio's deep inside her and <em>coming</em> that tips Agatha over the edge into another orgasm, feels herself clenching around the strap buried deep inside her.</p><p>After the few moments it takes for Rio to recover, they slowly slips out of Agatha, who can't stop the unhappy groan from escaping when they do. That changes when they bend down, press a kiss to the back of her thigh and touch a wrist lightly, "Can I undo these?"</p><p>"Please." Agatha nods into the blankets, mouth dry from overuse, and focuses on the feeling of Rio's deft hands untying her. They unfold her from her position where she feels a little like a shrimp that's been straightened out, and she sighs happily as she stretches her muscles, lets Rio tug her underwear the rest of the way down her legs and lets them move her arms enough to pull her sweat soaked tank over her head, baring her entirely.</p><p>She feels like she could fall right asleep, eyes closed and content to let Rio move her into her soft pillows and rub a balm into her skin where the rope had been.</p><p>"Thank you." Agatha says, throat raw.</p><p>"Oh," Rio says. Agatha can feel them shifting around, "Hold on, baby, let me get some water." She's not in her body enough to fight being shifted so Rio can scoot away from her, muttering to themself about being stupid not to think about bringing any—as though any of this was really planned. "I'll be so quick, just wait there." They say, smooth out the irritated crease between Agatha's brows.</p><p>The speed that Rio loosens and shoves the harness to the ground as they shuffle to the door would probably be funny if Agatha didn't already miss them so much.</p><p>True to their word, they're back with Agatha, cold bottle of water grabbed from her fridge in less than a minute. It doesn't stop Agatha from reaching out for Rio like she's wanted to do most of the night. Rio falls back onto the bed, uncaps the water for her and encourages her to drink before they wrap Agatha up in strong arms like they know it's exactly what she needs.</p><p>"I didn't get to touch you." Agatha says, quiet, not sure she wants to put the thought out there in case Rio wouldn't have wanted that from Agatha.</p><p>Rio hums, "There's always next time."</p><p>It isn't <em>said</em> like a joke, but it must be. This is a one time thing between friends. Once Rio leaves, this is over. Agatha tightens her grip on them and doesn't say anything in response.</p><p>"Is there anything you usually want during aftercare?" Rio says, holds Agatha close to their chest, fingers brushing out knots in her unruly hair.</p><p>"I'm not usually on this side of it," Agatha mumbles into the chest, feels their tape under her lips, throws an arm over their stomach and nuzzles in, "'S different."</p><p>"Well, is there anything you want?" Rio's words are almost whispered, "You can have anything you want."</p><p><em>Just you,</em> Agatha's mind says, makes her heart jump up into her throat where it doesn't fucking belong.</p><p>"Do you have those videos of the ravens talking like people?" She says instead.</p><p>"I thought you said they freaked you out." She can hear the amusement in Rio's voice even when they immediately start feeling around for their phone, find Agatha's first with a fumbling hand, easily enters her passcode.</p><p>"They do," Agatha says, voice not at all whiny, "But like, in a good way. Like how watching a horror film is fun."</p><p>She doesn't say <em>they remind me of you, I want to be surrounded by you.</em> She doesn't even know what that fucking means.</p><p>Agatha drifts off to her brain itching hearing those birds talking in too-human voices, to Rio stroking her hair, and switching off atop their rumbling chest when they try to laugh quietly so as not to disturb her.</p><p>The last thing she hears before she loses consciousness entirely is Rio whispering a soft, "I love you."</p><p>"Love you." She mutters back, thinks she might be drooling on Rio's chest. The words come naturally—she <em>does</em> love Rio, tells them all the time. They're her closest friend. And in the morning they'll go back to normal.</p>

<p><em>"Do you believe in love at first sight?"</em></p><p><em>Now, Rio likes making Agatha laugh. </em>Loves<em> it, even—it's one of their favorite sounds. But as Agatha clutches her stomach and cries laughing, has to quite literally wipe streaming tears from her cheeks, Rio feels it in their chest like a spray of broken glass.</em></p><p><em>"Rio, I barely even believe in </em>love."<em> Agatha says as her laughter trails off into an amused hum, "Oh, god. Don't tell me you do."</em></p><p><em>"No." Rio lets Agatha make a liar of them. They have, of course, been in love with Agatha since they were a gangly teenager with no friends, when she sat down opposite them and stole their lunch with a smile on her face.</em></p><p><em>They're sat, drunk and halfheartedly trying to sober up on the kitchen floor, speaking in hushed voices so as not to wake their other roommates. Rio's water bottle in the gap between their thighs, their hands brushing against each other in their shared bag of fries.</em></p><p><em>Rio swallows one down like cardboard, says, "Wait, I thought you said you weren't interested in dating. Not that you don't believe in love. Like… conceptually."</em></p><p><em>"Conceptually," Agatha hums like it's funny, then rolls her head against the wall they've propped themselves up against so she's looking at Rio, pout on her face, eyes gleaming, and says with a performative pitched voice, "Mommy didn't love me enough as a child and it's hindered my ability to love and be loved."</em></p><p><em>Rio's eyebrows knit together, "That's not true," They say, and in a moment of drunken vulnerability, words spill from their lips, unable to stop themself, "I love you."</em></p><p><em>The pout falls from Agatha's lips as her eyes roam Rio's face like she's looking for the telltale signs of being lied to. Rio holds still, waits for their words to sink in—they've held them back for so long that the entire kitchen seems to only have space for the two of them and Rio's confession.</em></p><p><em>It feels like minutes, hours that Agatha stares at them, but eventually a smile twitches on her lips and she lets out a laugh, head rolling away to stare up at the ceiling, "You don't need to pity me, Rio," She says as though it's entirely unbelievable that someone could fall in love with her, "I'm trying to self-therapize. I assume that's what one would tell me."</em></p><p><em>And so Rio's words get sucked back into their throat—feel heavier than ever when they settle back in the pit of their stomach.</em></p><p><em>It was unfair of them, probably, to put that on Agatha. And really, Rio thinks she's saved them both a lot of awkwardness by pretending not to know what Rio had meant.</em></p><p><em>They resolve to keep their feelings to themself from now on. Nothing is worth losing Agatha.</em></p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wakes to a hand on her stomach and knees touching the back of her own. It takes a moment for her to remember where she is (her own bedroom) and what happened (her best friend tied her up and fucked her until her brain was mush).</p><p>It's just—maybe it's stupid—but she hadn't expected Rio to <em>stay.</em> Agatha knows what this is, knows her way round a one night stand better than most. Rio's very much a relationship person, probably hasn't had to make a silent escape into the night.</p><p>Would that have been worse? Was Rio right to stay?</p><p>Fuck, this is why she doesn't sleep with friends.</p><p>Unfortunately for Agatha, it's probably the best sex she's ever had and ever <em>will</em> have. She's yet to turn thirty and already she knows everything will be measured against last night with Rio. How depressing.</p><p>Agatha's brain throws out the image of Rio waking and pressing their knee between her thighs and her whole fucking body reacts to the thought of Rio touching her again, <em>wanting</em> her ag—</p><p>Agatha turns her head, forces her face into the mattress, hopes to rid herself of that half-brewed form entirely.</p><p>(Agatha is selfish though, and <em>fuck</em> she wants Rio again.)</p><p>Her heart is hammering in her chest—can feel it in her temple, her toes. She's not surprised when Rio shifts behind her; it's surely loud enough to be echoing through the room.</p><p>She tries to keep still, hasn't worked out what to say now that everything has to go back to normal, even when she's naked and being held so tightly—Rio's fingers flexing against her stomach, their hand pressing her even closer to their front.</p><p>There's a rustling sound that pulls Agatha out of her own head; it doesn't take long to figure out what it is—Rio rubbing their feet together under the covers. It's woken Agatha up many times over the years—at the sleepovers they'd have at Rio's house, sleeping top and tail in their bed, as roommates in college when they'd both be too drunk to even pretend to want to be alone.</p><p>And yet, even after all this time, Agatha still doesn't quite know what it means. She lets out a breath—shakier than she's ever known from herself, and shifts against the sheets, just in case Rio needs reason to escape, in case they want to try to pull away and have Agatha's unconscious form not notice them slipping out of bed.</p><p>For some unknown reason, Rio tightens their hold on Agatha, mumbles in a sleep heavy voice, "Sorry," And before Agatha has time to work out what the hell they could be apologizing for, "Did I wake you up?"</p><p><em>Fuck, fuck, fuck,</em> is all that's running through Agatha's head as she rolls over to face them. Not that she'd admit it to anyone else, and not even to herself outside the late hours of the night, or the few minutes her brain takes to start up properly in the morning, but Agatha isn't immune to making mistakes.</p><p>Rolling over and facing Rio—seeing their sleep mussed hair, their bare shoulders, their chest covered only by tape, the arm they've kept over Agatha's body even through her moving, is one such mistake. Because no words leave her gaping mouth at the sight of them.</p><p>She watches Rio bite their lip, watches their eyes dart round the room like they know they should have left by now.</p><p>All Agatha does is shake her head, brings Rio's eyes back to her, "No," She says, voice thick with sleep, "You didn't wake me."</p><p>Rio hums, their fingers starting to tap an obviously nervous rhythm on Agatha's rib cage.</p><p><em>Last night was a mistake,</em> Agatha hears in Rio's voice, <em>it can't happen again. Friends don't do this, </em>and then her brain decides to be nice to her, <em>I can't lose you,</em> and,<em> I didn't get to taste you last night.</em></p><p>Wait.</p><p><em>I didn't get to taste you last night.</em></p><p>Her ears and her eyes play catch up with each other and suddenly she's replaying the very real moment that Rio said, <em>"I didn't get to taste you last night."</em></p><p>They pull away from her then, sit up and with the hand that had been holding Agatha, they start picking at the quilt, staring down at her with wide eyes, "Sorry. We don't have to do anyth—"</p><p>"No." Agatha gets out before she can think. She shouldn't—she knows it's such a bad idea to do it again but she can't help but <em>want.</em> If Rio wants to make her come again before they go back to being <em>normal</em> friends, she'll take it. Which is a normal thing to think about a friend who, just last night, was responsible for the most intense orgasm Agatha's ever had. "I just…" She trails off, clears her throat, mortified by her own hesitation, "I didn't think—"</p><p>"You didn't think…" Rio trails off, looks a lot more like they did last night now that Agatha's been reduced to some kind of stammering idiot, "That I'd wanna make you come on my tongue?"</p><p>Which is an insane thing to say to your best friend, frankly.</p><p>Even more insane is the way Rio's eyes drop below her face, the way their tongue darts out to wet their lips at the sight of Agatha's tits. Agatha smirks—this she can do; she grips the sheet and subtly shifts it a little lower, gives Rio a better view.</p><p>She can't blame them for looking—they didn't really get a chance last night.</p><p>Rio takes it as an offer, leans down and presses a kiss to Agatha's breastbone—much too gentle a thing for what this is, and so she fists Rio's hair, relishes in the surprised groan they let out, and pushes their head down. They don't fight it, wrap their lips around a nipple, the combination of teeth and tongue has her already squirming against the sheets by the time they move onto her other breast—hand covering the one they just left.</p><p><em>God,</em> she can't fucking take much more of this. She thinks she's been wet since the moment she woke up—Rio's touch lighting her up from the inside.</p><p>Agatha tightens the grip she has in Rio's hair and pulls. They rise obediently, lips tinged pink from use, and hover over her, look down at Agatha like she's done something adjacent to hanging the stars rather than offering herself up for a selfish final orgasm.</p><p>Rio's heavy-lidded eyes drop to Agatha's lips, and she only has a second to stop them from making a mistake even weightier than what they did last night.</p><p>They're so close to pressing their lips to Agatha's, and she almost gives in, just to know how it feels. But that's not what this is. Instead, she presses her hand to Rio's chest, stops them from closing the distance, and says, "You're taking your time for someone who seemed desperate to eat me out."</p><p>Rio's answer comes in a thick swallow. Agatha pictures her lips pressed to their neck, imagines she can feel it.</p><p>Fuck, she needs this to stop. She loves Rio, of course, but not like that. It's just that it's harder to stop the swelling in her chest this morning. Maybe she needs Rio to tie her back up so her brain stops trying to trip her up into feelings she doesn't have.</p><p>Rio doesn't try to kiss her again; Agatha watches as their pupils dilate and threaten to completely take over warm brown. They're so fucking compliant this morning, it has Agatha thinking about how good Rio would sub for her. Not that they're going to get the chance.</p><p>They shift down her body, dropping open mouthed kisses and the occasional bite to her skin as they go. Agatha loosens her harsh grip in Rio's hair but keeps her hand there, eyes fluttering shut as she tries to empty her mind the way it had been last night, shakes off the thought that she can't replicate that same feeling without Rio being in control the way they were.</p><p>Rio spreads her thighs, strong hands forcing them apart—the show of strength doing absolutely nothing to temper her need. They settle in the space between them, eyes laser focused on her cunt, fingers gently carding through the thick hair and then down to spread her open. And Agatha <em>knows</em> she's wet, but it's a whole different thing to feel the way Rio's touch goes from a drag to a smooth glide the moment they part her folds with a single finger.</p><p>The shaky breath she lets out at the touch draws Rio's eyes back up to her for a moment, "Okay?" They ask, because of course they do.</p><p>Agatha nods as best she can, "Touch me." She says before Rio can think to say anything else.</p><p>And Rio does, lowers their head, presses a soft kiss to the inside of her thigh that almost has Agatha's grip tightening once more in Rio's hair, frustration swelling instantly in her chest, before it fizzles out as Rio presses their mouth to her cunt.</p><p>She hums happily, finally getting what she wants, and strokes her hand through Rio's hair. It's only just occurring to Agatha that she can <em>touch</em> Rio this time.</p><p>Rio's mouth is <em>everywhere</em> but her clit, exploring like they had last night with their fingers. <em>"Rio,"</em> She sighs, feels Rio's answering hum like electricity through her. She bucks her hips up into Rio's mouth, tries to get their mouth on her clit, but to no avail, "Rio, come on."</p><p>They don't listen to her, keep a hand on her thigh so she can't close her legs even slightly, keeping her spread open. Which should be more annoying but, <em>fuck,</em> she'd never admit it out loud but it feels so fucking good to just lie back and <em>take</em> it.</p><p>The hand that isn't in Rio's hair flies up to her own face, jams her thumb and forefinger in closed eyes to try and rid herself of the thought that there's a <em>reason</em> this feels so good—and it's because it's <em>Rio.</em> Even this—lazy morning sex wouldn't usually have her on her back, not even <em>trying</em> to exert control, not trying to flip their positions, get herself on top to ride their face until <em>she</em> decides they're done.</p><p><em>Fuck.</em> She's been missing out on a lot by not sleeping with her friends.</p><p>"You want something?" Rio mumbles against her, presses a kiss to her clit—the only touch it's had all morning, breathes out a laugh against her when Agatha's hips involuntarily twitch at the touch.</p><p>"You dick."</p><p>"You're very mean to me." Rio says, then pushes Agatha's thigh more towards her chest—a move she hadn't been anticipating, and with the newfound easier access, dips their tongue lower and <em>fuck,</em> inside.</p><p>It's not what Agatha was trying for but the <em>sounds</em> Rio's making as they push further into her cunt has her mind emptying of any thoughts past <em>Rio's inside me. Need them deeper.</em></p><p>And maybe Rio's willing to give her this. The thought of having Rio inside her, stretching her out surpasses any need to have their tongue on her clit. Suddenly, the only thing she wants is <em>Rio</em> as deep inside her as they can get—doesn't even care about her building orgasm as long as they fill her completely, the way she wants, needs—</p><p><em>"Shit,"</em> Rio groans, pants against Agatha's thigh and leaves her cunt devastatingly empty, "You that desperate for it?"</p><p>Agatha whines, blames the early morning sun cracking through the blinds, and the mind numbing orgasms from the night before for the words she'd <em>apparently</em> let slip from her lips, because <em>yes,</em> she <em>is.</em></p><p>And all of the overthinking she's been doing since Rio woke up this morning is silenced by the fingers they press to the entrance of her cunt, teasing her open.</p><p>She's just glad Rio can't tell she's just as contented by this—knowing they're going to fill all the gaps she has left, as she is by being granted an easy orgasm.</p><p>"Put your fingers inside me." She says, is <em>not</em> about to beg—she did enough of that last night.</p><p>Rio finally works <em>with</em> her and not against her, presses inside with two fingers, doesn't stop until they're at the knuckle, filling her easy.</p><p>They pump their fingers slowly—once, twice, and that's all it takes for Agatha to fist the sheets by her head with one hand, and Rio's hair with the other, "Another," She says, words coming up from the depths of her throat, "Another finger."</p><p>"Three? Already?" Rio says the words against her thigh. They're said like a question, but Agatha can feel the smirk against her skin, can hear the tease in their voice, "Greedy girl."</p><p>Agatha doesn't have it in her to disagree. Not when Rio pulls out, a third finger fitting next to the others and pushing back inside like they belong there—like the shape of Agatha's cunt was made to fit Rio inside.</p><p>She can feel herself clenching on Rio's fingers—like her body agrees and wants to keep them inside of her.</p><p>God, it's not gonna take long. She wants it, <em>needs</em> it now.</p><p>"Maybe next time," Agatha says like there's going to <em>be</em> a next time, "You can wake me up like this."</p><p>It's worth the unexpected ache in her chest to have Rio whine into her cunt at her words, and then <em>finally</em> lick over her clit.</p><p>Her back arches off the bed, she's probably near ripping out Rio's hair. She can't bring herself to care.</p><p>The fingers inside her start up a harsh rhythm, makes Agatha feel every inch that's inside of her completely, and it only takes seconds for her to fall over the edge into an orgasm that creeps up on her, crashes into it almost by accident.</p><p>Rio doesn't let up, fucks Agatha through her orgasm, their fingers keeping to the same speed as they suck her clit into their mouth. Part of her wants to back away from the feeling, try to stave off the rapidly approaching second orgasm, partly to protect her ego, and mostly because she doesn't want this to end.</p><p>She can't though, and her orgasm breaks over her, a near scream ripping from her throat. She feels it in every part of her body—toes curling in the sheets, thighs tensing in Rio's grip, back arched as the feeling zips up her spine, ears ringing as she rides it out.</p><p>Agatha will blame the way she's not long woken up for the tired that sits in her bones when she comes down, a happy hum escaping her lips when Rio shifts back up her body, gentle so they can keep their fingers inside her just a little longer. She's not sure if that part is for her or for them, but she's grateful—hates the feeling of being empty too soon after she's come.</p><p>Rio's face is shiny and their eyes are bright when Agatha takes them in. She keeps her arms by her sides so she doesn't slip up and let her happy buzzing body pull Rio in close like she'd allowed Rio to do with her last night.</p><p>"You taste so good." Rio says, slowly slips their fingers from Agatha's cunt, watches her jaw slacken at the feeling.</p><p>"Yeah?" Agatha says, swallows hard at the way her brain seems to record those words. She wonders if when they go to dinner at Wanda's later this week, and Rio has no reason to want her anymore, she'll still hear them echoing around her mind.</p><p>Rio hums, "Want a taste?"</p><p>Agatha's eyes drop to their lips; she can see herself all over Rio, imagines herself leaning up, tasting herself on Rio's lips, licking into their mouth and sucking on their tongue, and—</p><p>Fuck, <em>what?</em> She blinks, very pointedly averts her gaze to look into Rio's eyes and nowhere else. Surely Rio must know how the lines would blur if they kissed.</p><p>"No?" They say before Agatha can answer—a rarity since Agatha has made a habit since childhood of speaking before she thinks—mouth pulling in a disappointed line, "That surprises me."</p><p>And thank god Agatha hadn't said something stupid like <em>I can't kiss you because I think I might die if I do,</em> because Rio brings their hand up to their mouth and sucks just their forefinger into their mouth, takes it deep until their lips are touching their knuckle. They hum at the taste.</p><p>Agatha's hand shoots out and wraps around their wrist. That's <em>her</em> prize; they can't take it from her.</p><p>They raise an eyebrow at her but allow Agatha to pull their finger from their mouth. Agatha replicates their move—maintains eye contact as she takes just that one finger, slick with both her come and Rio's spit, deep into her mouth.</p><p>She smirks around it at Rio's slack jawed expression and when she backs off, leaving the tip just at her lips, decides to go straight in for the kill—lines the other two fingers that had been inside her up next to the first and takes them right down to the knuckle. Agatha hums around them when they touch the back of her throat; she shouldn't be surprised—she could feel <em>exactly</em> how long their fingers were when they were inside her last night, but she still hums her satisfaction at the happy buzzing it gives her brain.</p><p>Agatha bobs her head, cleans their fingers until she can no longer taste herself on them, pleased with the way Rio hasn't looked at her with anything but awe the entire time.</p><p>She's going to miss this.</p><p>"Fuck," Rio breathes, doesn't wipe their spit slick fingers on the covers, instead curls them into their palm as if they'd been given a gift, "You're perfect."</p><p>Agatha's heart seems to plummet down into the pit of her stomach at their words—sick and stupid.</p><p>She wants to tell Rio not to say those kinds of things to her—that's not the kind of relationship she has with any of the people she fucks. And yes, of course it gets a little tangled with how close they are, how much they love each other, but Agatha can't hear anything like that after they've had sex.</p><p>Instead, she clears her throat, looks Rio in the eye because it's not like she's uncomfortable or afraid to end this, and says, "I have work soon. I need to have a shower."</p><p>And Rio—kind and wonderful Rio doesn't say, <em>'Oh, so you're kicking me out', </em>or, <em>'Right, yeah, of course you do', </em>or, <em>'Don't bother calling',</em> like she was ever even planning on it.</p><p>No, Rio's big brown eyes just widen further as they grab her hand, thumb stroking over the back a few times before they shift to get out of bed, "Sorry, I didn't even realize," They say, start looking around for their clothes, "I usually know your work schedule better than this."</p><p>Agatha just watches, unable to even move from her bed as Rio gets dressed in last night's clothes. If she was more <em>in her body</em> she'd have offered Rio a pair of clean boxers from her drawer—what she likes to sleep in when she doesn't have someone in her bed.</p><p>She watches them pull their clothes back on, memorizes every bit of skin that gets covered up because she'll never get to see it again.</p><p>"Maybe I could take you out to dinner tonight?" Rio says when they're pulling on their shoes, "That Greek place you like?"</p><p>Agatha would <em>never</em> normally say no to that, but the idea of everything going back to normal <em>today,</em> and not even allowing herself the time to push the thought of Rio like <em>this</em> to the very back of her mind, has her shaking her head, "Another night?"</p><p>The light in Rio's eyes dims—she probably wouldn't even notice it if she hadn't got so used to looking into them in the past twelve hours, "Yeah," They still cross the room to come to her, cup her face in their hand, "I'll work around you."</p><p>"Soon, I promise." She says, allows herself to tilt her cheek into their hand. No one's ever done that before and it feels nice. Sue her. And then, as Rio's about to leave, she calls after them like a pathetic teenager, "I had fun last night."</p><p>Rio peeks their head around her doorframe, stupid, goofy grin plastered to their face, "And this morning, I hope."</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, "Well, yes."</p><p>"I know what you mean, though," Rio says, eyes shifting around the room, Agatha patiently waiting for them to find the right words, "Thank you for trusting me. I'd probably find trying new things with you easier too."</p><p>Agatha can only nod, is worried that if she tries to speak her voice will crack. She hadn't expected Rio to understand the gravity of submission for her, and her heart clenches at the acknowledgment.</p><p>And then they're gone, leaving Agatha in the sheets that smell so distinctly like the two of them together.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha considers not washing the sheets.</p><p>Which is ridiculous because they're in desperate need of it. But after Rio left, it didn't take long for her to realize that was her last opportunity to <em>touch</em> Rio, and she fucking blew it by kicking them out.</p><p>Rio's probably a <em>normal</em> level of freak <em>and</em> Agatha's best friend. She imagines they wouldn't take too kindly to Agatha curling back up in those sheets with her nose pressed to them.</p><p>So she doesn't. She fully intends to take this day as a full reset for her relationship with Rio.</p><p>And that works up until it doesn't. She's showered, washed her sheets, made a half-assed attempt at yoga to clear her mind, which didn't work at all when she got into the rabbit pose and swore she could feel Rio's hands on her hips like they had last night.</p><p>Maybe she should take up a new hobby. Something entirely unsexy—something like macramé. Agatha's fairly sure Rio remained a virgin throughout that whole obsession, so there must be some correlation.</p><p>And then, halfway through loading the dishwasher, Agatha gets slapped in the face with the memory of the words, <em>I'd probably find trying new things with you easier too,</em> and she almost drops a plate.</p><p>Because maybe she doesn't have to give this up. Maybe that was their way of letting Agatha know they'd be interested in doing this again—if there was something they haven't tried yet.</p><p>She spends the rest of the day in a sort of horny haze—thinking up things Rio might not have done before, and equally, things <em>she's</em> never tried, imagines them trying them together. It's important that she has the full picture before adding them to her list.</p><p>And that night she texts them, just to test the waters—keeps it relatively tame—</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>have you ever tried anal?</em></p><p> </p><p>It's tame compared to some of the other things that came to mind today. And it can potentially be read through the lens of a curious friend. Though she does quickly follow it up with—</p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>and if so giving or receiving?</em></p><p> </p><p>Because <em>god,</em> she wants to know.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>No</em><br/><em>To both</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip when she gets the response nearly half an hour later. Not that she's been keeping track of the time or checking her phone. No, she has better things to do than to constantly check whether Rio's messaged her back yet.</p><p>And it's a good job she <em>hadn't</em> been waiting because she doesn't know if it's the response she wants. Just a flat out no. Does that simply mean <em>no, they haven't tried it, </em>or, <em>no, and I don't want to try it with you?</em></p><p>Not that she was going to, but Agatha doesn't have to spend time trying to figure out her next move because another text chimes in from Rio.</p><p><br/><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>I'm interested</em></p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>ok. good.</em></p><p> </p><p>In hindsight, maybe Agatha should have first figured out whether that meant Rio was interested with <em>her,</em> but then—</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>What about you?</em></p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>yes to both</em></p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>I hope you're not disappointed with</em><br/><em>my lack of experience</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha slams her hand down on the sofa in the space next to her, triumphant grin on her lips. Okay, so that was more painless than she'd been anticipating.</p><p>She could be mean, but there's enough time for that later—times where it could be more fun for both of them.</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>you could never disappoint me</em></p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Over the next few days, Agatha hopes to interrupt Rio's day with messages that have them turning their notification previews off.</p><p><em>degradation. thoughts?</em> is sent just minutes after waking up.</p><p>She cackles to herself when she texts them <em>i've never been fisted before</em> when she knows Rio will be on their weekly call with their mom.</p><p>Their responses are mostly the same—some broken brain blabbering and then agreement. They <em>always</em> want to try whatever Agatha has to offer.</p><p>Agatha makes sure to send a text just after 10am on the Wednesday because she knows Rio's likely to be doing their grocery shopping. They don't explicitly confirm her suspicions, but she knows she's right when the answer to, <em>how do you feel about choking?</em> is—</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Shit</em><br/><em>Agatha</em><br/><em>Maybe a warning next time?</em></p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>where's the fun in that? :(</em></p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Don't put the sad face, baby</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her face heat up—with anger—at Rio's use of the pet name, ignores it so she doesn't draw any attention to it.</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>answer the question</em></p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Choking on food is one of my least</em><br/><em>favorite things.</em><br/><em>But if you mea</em></p><p> </p><p>Hm. Agatha's mostly sure Rio hadn't meant to send that. She waits a few minutes, just stares at her screen to see if Rio messages again. It doesn't come.</p><p>She huffs, throws her phone away from her and goes to stare at the mostly empty contents of her fridge like the answer will be in there.</p><p>That doesn't stop her from near lunging for it when it buzzes again.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Oh oops</em><br/><em>Pressed send before I was done lol</em><br/><em>Bumped into Jen</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha can't help but tease a little,</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>omg are you texting me about</em><br/><em>choking me in front of jen?!</em><br/><em>dirty</em></p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Oh, so that IS what you meant :o</em><br/><em>Never done it but yes I'm interested</em><br/><em>I'm maybe more interested in being choked</em></p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>even better</em></p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's list grows the more they talk, but she hasn't <em>seen</em> Rio since that morning. She likes to have a clear vision of what she's doing, and she's definitely not at all nervous, but her right thumb is coppery to taste whenever she brings it to her mouth with how much she's bitten it.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Are you free today?</em><br/><em>There's a witchcraft exhibition at the museum</em><br/><em>Can I take you?</em></p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>i can't today</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha's stomach turns as she presses send. It's stupid, but it sounds like a date. It <em>is</em> a date, really.</p><p>She remembers sitting on Rio's bed at college and distracting them from their studying with stupid questions instead of doing any of her own work. Discussing their perfect dates was obviously much more entertaining to Agatha.</p><p><em>"Um, I don't know. I've never really thought about it."</em> They'd said, not looking up from their laptop, <em>"What's yours?"</em></p><p>Agatha had hummed, said, <em>"Probably like a museum or something."</em></p><p><em>"Yeah?"</em> Rio had finally looked up at that, seemed amused, <em>"Would you be hoping your date buys you something from the gift shop after getting lunch in the little restaurant?"</em></p><p><em>"Fuck off,"</em> She'd said, cheeks heating up because that sounded really fucking nice actually, <em>"Your turn."</em></p><p><em>"Museum sounds nice."</em> They'd said with a shrug and went back to their studying.</p><p><em>"You can't steal my date."</em></p><p><em>"Why not?"</em></p><p>Agatha didn't really have a response to that. It seemed stupid to say she didn't like the thought of them taking another girl on <em>her</em> date. So she didn't.</p><p> </p><p align="right"><strong><em>Me</em></strong><br/><em>i'll see you tomorrow at wanda's right?</em></p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong><br/><em>Of course</em></p><p> </p><p>So it's fine then. Agatha doesn't <em>need</em> to see Rio before tomorrow anyway. She has a plan, and staring at wax models of Salem's finest probably isn't the place to ask Rio to throw her around a little.</p><p>And the ideal place is <em>obviously</em> Wanda's kitchen. Or bathroom. Or bedroom. Honestly, she's not too picky.</p><p>So she'll see Rio tomorrow and she won't have to worry about looking at Rio and thinking about them kissing her, <em>just</em> because her brain has an alert out for <strong><em>DATE SETTING.</em></strong></p><p>Agatha can be patient and normal about this.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio is already there when Agatha turns up, fingers drumming over the neck of their beer bottle and offering Agatha a small smile when she walks in. Agatha readies herself for the usual gentle hug but it never comes. Rio doesn't even stand to greet her—their only acknowledgement being <em>just</em> that smile.</p><p>And she'd have ignored it—Rio isn't <em>obligated</em> to greet her by wrapping their arms around her; no one else does. But then she <em>can't</em> ignore it when she drops her offerings of wine and peanuts off in the kitchen and Jen sidles up beside her, one eyebrow raised like she's some daytime television detective.</p><p>"What was that?"</p><p>Agatha very pointedly does not look at her, "What was what?"</p><p>"Are you and Rio fighting?"</p><p>That's not exactly what she'd call it. Though—if someone else noticed it then…</p><p>"Of course not." She says, looks Jen in the eye and tries to remember the normal amount of times to blink in a minute. Jen doesn't look convinced, "Your eyebrow is gonna get stuck like that." Agatha jabs at her.</p><p>Jen ignores that. Bitch. "So everything's normal with you and Rio?"</p><p>Well. She wouldn't exactly say that either. Agatha hopes the shiver that runs down her spine at the memory of Rio making her come with their strap buried deep inside her isn't noticeable.</p><p>"Yes," She sighs. And then, because she's apparently lost her mind to memories of <em>other</em> things, like the way Rio called her <em>baby,</em> and the way they pressed kisses to parts of her body that <em>weren't</em> her lips, and the way they seemed to know exactly what Agatha needed, and—well, she's out of it enough to say, "Why would you think that?"</p><p>Jen has looked at Agatha like she's insane, like she's scared of her, like she's unconvinced by everything she's saying. She's never looked at Agatha like she's stupid before.</p><p>"Because the two of you are worryingly paired at the hip. I've never seen Rio <em>not</em> try and cross a room to get to you once they've spotted you." Jen says, which doesn't at all help.</p><p>"That can't be true." Agatha says, but as soon as the words leave her lips she knows she's wrong. Rio always makes her feel special in that regard. No matter where they are, how many enemies she's made in the room, Rio will look at her like she could do no wrong—like they're <em>proud</em> to know her. They always head straight to her, even when Agatha can see they're in the middle of a conversation—like Agatha's someone important.</p><p>Fuck. Maybe they <em>are</em> fighting.</p><p>She clears her throat, "We're fine." She reiterates even though now she's not so sure.</p><p>And truth be told, she's maybe a little embarrassed, what with the way she'd prepared herself before coming out, just in case Rio had wanted to try something new tonight.</p><p>She should have gone to that stupid fucking museum.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Dinner goes fine.</p><p>Rio is sitting on the opposite end of the table. They <em>chose</em> to sit that far away from her. The thought sat heavy in Agatha's stomach for a while until they started speaking to her like everything was normal from across the table.</p><p>Agatha doesn't have a fucking clue what's going on.</p><p>So maybe she follows them to the bathroom when Wanda, Jen, and Alice are having the whole <em>to have children, or not to have children</em> debate. It's not as if it's looking like it's in the cards for her—she won't be missed from this conversation.</p><p>She tiptoes upstairs, just in case, and knocks on the bathroom door.</p><p>"Um," Agatha can hear Rio shuffling about, "One second."</p><p>"It's me." Agatha says, mostly in case Rio doesn't want to open the door to her.</p><p>They barely even take a second after that, wrenching the door open and pulling Agatha inside. It's a better reaction than she thought she was going to get.</p><p>"Agatha," They breathe, mouth widening into a bigger smile than she was greeted with, "Fuck, you look so good tonight."</p><p>Well, that she knows. She'd got dressed earlier with Rio in mind—purposefully accentuated her tits with her tight, long-sleeved deep v-neck to selfishly get their eyes on them. They hadn't looked once all evening, but now it's like they've been told they'll die if they look elsewhere ever again.</p><p>Which makes sense because the air is cooler in the bathroom than anywhere else in the house, and Agatha isn't wearing a bra. She's tempted to check, but the way Rio licks their lips as they stare tells her that her nipples are straining against the material.</p><p>"You barely even said hi to me earlier." Agatha says, doesn't sound petulant at all, doesn't lightly punch Rio's arm because <em>what the fuck was that about?</em></p><p>Rio shies away from Agatha's intense look, lets themself be backed up against the wall, "I didn't want to give us away."</p><p><em>Us.</em></p><p>Agatha knows what they mean, but her heart beats out of her chest for just a moment anyway.</p><p>"Right," She says. Maybe she'd overreacted. Whatever. She doesn't tell Rio that their friends had found it <em>more</em> suspicious, "So you still wanna…" She trails off—doesn't want to say something as juvenile as <em>hook up,</em> or,<em> do this—</em></p><p>"It's all I've been thinking about since I last saw you."</p><p>Agatha's breath hitches.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah," It's tantalizing, the way Rio's eyes drop to her lips like that's something they do, "You didn't make it easy to <em>not</em> think about you with all of those questions."</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about." Agatha says, presses forward, hips first, loves the way Rio looks leaning back against the wall like they'd let her ruin them, like they wouldn't even have any doubts about letting her.</p><p>"No?" Rio sounds amused, "Multiple messages a day asking my thoughts on wax play or spanking, or whatever, and you don't remember?"</p><p>Or maybe Rio's set on ruining <em>Agatha.</em> They've barely even said anything but the implication—knowing Rio's been thinking about the two of them trying everything she's messaged about. Her brain is unfortunately, embarrassingly, quite empty.</p><p>"I never asked you about spanking." She sounds like she smokes two packs a day and hasn't drank a glass of water in a year.</p><p>Rio hums, "Oh, that sucks," They say, which makes it sound like Agatha told them that a tv show they like is ending, "Are you not into that?"</p><p>"I'm into it." Agatha says, a little breathless.</p><p>Rio parrots her own words from her texts back to her, a little grin on their face like they know they have the upper hand. They shouldn't <em>have</em> the upper hand. "Giving or receiving?"</p><p>"Do you honestly think I've ever let anyone spank me before?"</p><p>Rio's face is gentle, "That's okay, we don't have to."</p><p>"Well I," God, it's so much more fucking embarrassing talking about this when she's the hypothetical sub, "I never said that. I want to try things with you."</p><p>Agatha doesn't like how calm Rio looks about all this, like this isn't a surprise, like they <em>know</em> Agatha wants to get bent over on her own bed and let Rio mark her, bruise her.</p><p>"Am I to trust that you'll do it right first time," She says, in the hopes to regain some sort of lead in the conversation, tilts her head just a little to look Rio in the eye as she presses a hand to Rio's stomach, presses her nails in—wishes their skin was bared, "Or do you need me to give a demonstration?"</p><p>She watches, unable to keep the sharp grin from her face, as Rio shivers, "I do have <em>some</em> experience here."</p><p>Agatha can feel her smile sliding down into a grimace, teeth still bared, "With <em>her?"</em></p><p>"Maria? Yeah."</p><p>Agatha digs her nails in, and with her other hand on their chest, shoves them further up against the wall, "I don't want to hear her name."</p><p>She knows Rio's not <em>hers.</em> She doesn't want them to be. She's never usually bothered about the people she's sleeping with having sex with other people. It's likely just that it's Rio, and there's feelings there—albeit platonic. She doesn't like the idea of sharing them now that they've fucked.</p><p>"Sorry," They say, and they do sound it, but there's a hint of arousal in their tone too, "If it helps, I've never used anything but my hand."</p><p>Fuck. It does help actually. With the angry buzzing in Agatha's brain anyway; not so much with her underwear. Rio hasn't even touched her but their words, the new thought of Rio bending her over their lap, paddle or crop in hand, has her pressing her thighs together.</p><p>God, she wouldn't even be entertaining the thought with someone else.</p><p>"I might have some toys for you to use."</p><p>Agatha can see Rio's throat bob at her words, "Just so we're clear, you're asking me these questions because these are things you want to do <em>with me,</em> right?"</p><p>The thought of saying no is funny—tempting, but Agatha just pulls her nails from where they're pinned in Rio's stomach, trails her fingers down to the hem of their t-shirt and strokes the skin of their hip. She missed out on a lot only getting to touch Rio during aftercare last time, "I've been making a list, pretty boy."</p><p>Rio whines, lets their eyes slip closed a little, <em>"Fuck,</em> Agatha, you can't just say things like that."</p><p>Agatha bites her lip like it's going to do anything to hide her smirk, "Why? Do you like it that much?"</p><p><em>"Obviously."</em></p><p>Rio's right. It <em>is</em> obvious.</p><p>She files that away for later.</p><p>"How do you feel about coming home with me tonight?" Agatha says, practically speaks the words into Rio's jaw, hadn't realized how close her face had gotten, "I can't stop thinking about the other night."</p><p>"You want me to tie you up again?"</p><p>Honestly, that hadn't been what Agatha was going for, had intended to try something new, but—</p><p>"Maybe I could teach you a new tie?"</p><p>Rio nods, eager, "Please. You looked so perfect the other night."</p><p>Being tied up again isn't exactly what she had in mind, but if it's what Rio wants, all this means is she has more time before her list runs itself down and Rio gets bored of her, like they do all their hobbies.</p><p>She lets out a sigh at the thought, brain whirring through all the ties she knows, pictures Rio once again with her rope in their hands. She shakes off the thoughts, grabs hold of Rio's wrist and checks the time on their watch.</p><p>"I give it an hour before we can leave," She drops Rio's arm back to their side. There's something satisfying about the way Rio lets themself be manhandled by Agatha, but is so comfortable taking control in bed. She'd honestly deluded herself into thinking they'd be solely submissive.</p><p>"What tie will you teach me?" Agatha can almost feel Rio's jittery excitement even though she's no longer touching them, "Just so I can prepare a little."</p><p>Agatha doesn't really know what that means, doesn't know how they're planning on preparing from Wanda's bathroom, but, "I was thinking a box tie, if you've never done one of them?"</p><p>Rio shakes their head, "I've done harnesses but never anything with arms as well," They let their eyes trail down Agatha's chest; she imagines they're picturing her all tied up so she does the kind thing and doesn't interrupt their staring, "Mar—" Rio cuts themself off, wide eyes jumping back up to Agatha's face like they're going to be scolded, <em>"She</em> was always more into the visual of the rope than actually being restrained."</p><p>Agatha hums, lets Rio's minor fuck up go, "That's good actually. A box tie shouldn't be too hard for you to learn then. We can keep it simple."</p><p>She also ignores the implication that, unlike Rio's ex, Agatha <em>wants</em> to be restrained. She can't exactly correct them after last time.</p><p>Agatha backs away to the door, but when she touches the handle, Rio says, "Wait." She looks at them over her shoulder, nerves set into their expression, "I just… I know you don't really do this, but I want this," They gesture in the space between them both, "To be exclusive. I know it's selfish but I don't want you to be with other people too."</p><p>It makes Agatha pause. She didn't consider the fact that Rio would think she'd still do her usual <em>one person alone won't satisfy me</em> thing. She doesn't think that would be true with Rio—not when she now has a plethora of things to try; not when Rio can give her what she wants and <em>needs—</em>neither dominant or submissive all of the time.</p><p>She crosses the room, cups Rio's face in her hands and makes sure to look them in the eye—not the same thing she'd pulled on Jen earlier, but just so they know she's being serious, "Why would I need anyone but you?"</p><p>The bathroom overhead lights are too harsh for the moment, but the depth of Rio's eyes make it feel like the most intimate place in the world. Rio breathes out a sigh, face softening and losing its tension. Their hands come to grip their hips, like they belong there—like they'd been holding themself back before, and their eyes drop to her lips.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha thinks they're going to kiss her. For a moment, she thinks she'd let them, if not for the horrific lighting ruining it a little for her. That and the fact that kissing Rio would be a terrible mistake. That's the main reason. The sole reason.</p><p>She clears her throat and like Rio knows exactly what she's thinking, they nod, release their grip on her hips and lets her leave.</p><p>Agatha resists the urge to lean her back against the newly closed bathroom door to collect herself like some sort of touch-starved damsel. Fuck, she really needs to grow up if she's going to take Rio home with her and not accidentally kiss them when she walks through the front door.</p><p>And she only has about ninety minutes to get that through her skull.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha <em>doesn't</em> kiss Rio the minute she drags them through her front door. She's since recovered her brain cells—maybe she was losing air in Wanda's tiny bathroom, maybe she has black mold growing and it affected her mind. She should let Wanda know. God, she's <em>such</em> a good friend.</p><p>As exhibited by her <em>not</em> kissing Rio when she pulls them to the stairs by their hand. If Rio was someone else, Agatha might have let herself push them against the door, crash her lips into theirs and taste the beer on their tongue. But they're not; they're Rio, and so she doesn't—just pulls them by their wrist up the staircase, giggles when they trip over a step in a bid to keep with her.</p><p>If Rio was someone else, she probably would have shoved them down onto her bed, straddled them, pinned their wrists to the bed as she kissed them, licked into their mouth.</p><p>She doesn't do any of that, of course.</p><p>She <em>does</em> shove them down onto her bed, but she stays standing, heads over to her closet where her toy chest is, pulls out two long lengths of rope, just in case one isn't enough, and also her safety shears. She debates over getting other toys out—a plug, a vibrator, maybe. She doesn't though.</p><p>This way she gets to see what Rio chooses to do, and isn't that what this is supposed to be about? Trying new things, and doing them differently? Agatha never would have let someone else dictate how she was going to get fucked before this thing with Rio sparked alight.</p><p>She heads back to the bed, rope in hand. Rio looks good waiting there for her. They're propped up on their elbows, just watching her, their legs spread. Agatha has the sudden urge to drop to her knees between them and let her mind empty as she takes their cock into her mouth.</p><p>Definitely black mold. Definitely telling Wanda.</p><p>"Thought I was gonna be in control again?"</p><p>Those words said in <em>that</em> position. God, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to her.</p><p>"Thought you were gonna be a good little student for me and learn this new tie?" Agatha says, drops the rope from the loose quick-release tie she stores it in, tries to wrench back any semblance of control.</p><p>"Yeah," Rio says, pushes themself up to sit and grab at the backs of Agatha's thighs now that she's close enough, "And I thought you wanted me to learn it so you sit there looking pretty and not have to think, sweetheart."</p><p>It takes a lot to keep the whine that wants to escape her throat at bay as she stumbles inelegantly forward at Rio's tug.</p><p>"Where the hell did you learn this shit?" She sort of regrets it after saying it because she knows the answer—Maria. Or some other woman who came before her that Agatha probably hated just as much because they were never ever good enough for Rio.</p><p>"Just made a guess at the type of things you'd like to hear," They say and lean in to press a kiss to Agatha's covered hip bone, "And I read a lot."</p><p>Agatha, who had been in the middle of letting herself relax into the feeling of Rio's lips pressed against her, head tilted back, lips curled into a satisfied slight smile, quickly drops her gaze back down, fists her hand in Rio's hair and tugs their head back to force them to look at her. "Rio, please tell me you're not recycling lines from your erotica."</p><p>"Not recycling," Rio says, eyes wide, then mumbles, "Maybe just inspired."</p><p>Agatha groans, though it could be worse—at least they're not recycled lines from one of Rio's past relationships. These are, fortunately, all just with Agatha in mind. Admittedly, she does enjoy the thought of Rio alone in their bedroom reading and thinking only of Agatha.</p><p>She doesn't want to talk about that anymore though, drops the rope and shears on the bed beside Rio and starts pulling the tight shirt over her head, throws it somewhere behind her, loves the way Rio wastes no time before surging forward and taking a nipple into their mouth.</p><p>She allows them, for a moment, lets her head drop back once more as a moan escapes her lips, keeps her hand loose in Rio's hair.</p><p>They're about to move to her other nipple when she tightens her grip, holds their head back, "I'm gonna go to the bathroom, and I'm gonna leave you with a video to watch while I'm gone. And when I'm back hopefully you'll have a basic understanding of how you're gonna tie me up."</p><p>Now, Rio looks particularly smug for someone who's letting their sub run the show so far, "I found one when you left me at Wanda's. I've watched it like twenty times tonight."</p><p><em>Motherfucker.</em></p><p>"Is that why you kept fucking disappearing?" She raises an eyebrow, tries not to look any ounce of impressed, "I thought you had a UTI."</p><p>"It doesn't actually look that complicated," Rio chuckles, leans forward in the grip Agatha hadn't realized she'd loosened in their hair, and plants a kiss to her bare stomach, "I thought you'd get like this," They say like there's parts of Agatha they know better than even she does, "It's harder to teach this one by just explaining, so I thought I'd do my own research first."</p><p>Agatha pushes her tongue into the side of her cheek—a habit she picked up from Rio.</p><p>Rio just smiles like they know Agatha appreciates this. And unfortunately for her, she does. "I made notes."</p><p>Agatha blinks down at them, "You made notes?"</p><p>"'Course," Rio says, fumbles to pull their phone from their pocket to show her, "So we don't have to watch the video, and we can just talk. Plus, I'm not a total beginner anymore, Agatha. I know what I'm doing."</p><p>She knows that. Of course she does, what with the way they bent her over last time, propped her up with pillows to support her chest and neck without having to be reminded, tied her wrists to her legs without missing a step, without fucking anything up, without forgetting to check in as they went.</p><p>Agatha thinks maybe she just doesn't like the idea of them gaining any new knowledge from the first time—when this was all innocent and she was showing them ties that boy scouts learn. Before they took that knowledge and used it on someone else, <em>developed</em> it with someone else.</p><p>They grab hold of her hips once again like it's their favorite place for them to be, strokes them with both thumbs, "You can still leave for a minute while I watch your video, if you want."</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, "I wasn't really thinking."</p><p>Rio gently moves her back as they stand up. It's nice looking up at Rio.</p><p>"That's okay," They cup her chin, "You don't have to think right now, do you, baby?"</p><p>Her brain fucking short circuits hearing that. Once she's used to hearing <em>her</em> Rio saying things like that she'll be fine, but for now, all she wants to do is let them take control like they had last time.</p><p>So she stops thinking, takes Rio's shirt in her hands like she wants and starts tugging it over their head. They raise their arms to help her along, and then start unbuttoning Agatha's jeans once their shirt is off, Agatha's hands reaching to match them.</p><p>Once they're fully bare, Rio sort of sways towards her like they're going to kiss her—the headiness of the skin available to touch and the knowledge they're going to fuck obviously getting to them too.</p><p>Agatha looks away, reaches around Rio to grab one of the lengths of rope from the bed, "Come on then, pretty boy."</p><p>(She enjoys the way Rio softly groans, the thought crackles in the back of her mind that sometime soon, she'll have them at her mercy, will get to watch them react to all the names she'll call them when she's got them whimpering underneath her.</p><p>But that's for another time. And Agatha likes knowing there will <em>be</em> another time.)</p><p>"Still good to use the traffic light system?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"And your safeword?" Rio takes the rope from her hands, runs the length through their hands so that they're holding it comfortably, the bight between their fingers, ready to use.</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>"Can you tell me what it is?"</p><p>Agatha nods, "Purple."</p><p>Rio smiles, obviously pleased, "Turn around for me, baby."</p><p><em>Fuck,</em> she really needs to get used to hearing them call her that soon. She could ask them to stop but—</p><p><em>Baby, baby, baby, baby.</em></p><p>Well. She won't.</p><p>She does as they ask, barely thinks about it.</p><p>"I didn't even have to tell you," Rio says, touches her forearms gently, and Agatha realizes only then that she's crossed her arms behind her back and assumed the box tie position, "Such a good girl."</p><p>Agatha's breath catches with that, is glad she's no longer facing Rio so they can't see the embarrassing flush on her face. She's never been called that before, she thinks she'd fucking remember.</p><p>"I'm gonna start with your arms now, okay, sweetheart?"</p><p>Agatha nods, but the rope never comes.</p><p>"Color, please?"</p><p>Oh.</p><p>"Green."</p><p>She's <em>very</em> green in fact.</p><p>And then Rio starts looping the rope around her arms—a firm tie but not cutting off any blood flow. She can hear them mumbling to themself as they work, catches the end of them quietly saying, <em>now a knot here,</em> which is more endearing than she'd expected to find it.</p><p>It's done much quicker than she's expecting, and soon the part Rio has least experience with is done and they bring the rope around her body, making sure to gently move her hair out of the way so it doesn't get tangled in any of the rope.</p><p>She keeps dropping her eyes to watch them work, largely because she didn't personally <em>pick</em> the tie. Rio was right, this <em>is</em> a simple one—rope just tied above her breasts and then below—a window rather than having them separated by more rope. Agatha should teach them something more intricate sometime, can imagine herself with patterns leaving marks on her skin.</p><p>She can't complain though, not when her mind grows as empty as it had been last time they did this, not when Rio's done such a good job, straight and comfortable lines cutting across her skin, unable to move her arms, tits pushed out with her arms held behind her back.</p><p>"God, you're beautiful." Rio breathes once they've finished, standing in front of Agatha once more. They're the first words they've said to her that aren't about the tie or her comfort, and it's like they've set themself a goal to see how red they can get her face.</p><p>She swallows, doesn't know what to do with that so shakes the compliment off and diverts their attention, "Box ties are fun because you might notice I can still move, unlike last time." She grins, raises an eyebrow, "More positions."</p><p>Rio has a faraway look in their eye. Agatha swears she can see herself in them—in the ways Rio's imagining her.</p><p>"What did you have in mind?"</p><p>Agatha tilts her head, "Thought you were supposed to be in charge, big boy?" She likes the way that grabs their attention, keeps going, "Or are you not capable of that now my tits are in your face?"</p><p>Rio's smile is soft but their eyes are sharp when they grip her chin, "God, you're so desperate to not be in control for once, aren't you?</p><p>"I—"</p><p>"Come on, baby," They say because they know her better than anyone, "That's what all this is, isn't it? You want someone who can put you in your place. You want someone you can trust to switch your brain off around, don't you?"</p><p>Agatha tries to speak, she swears she does but some sort of strangled whine gets released in place of words.</p><p>"It's okay," The thumb from the hand holding her chin comes across to press against Agatha's mouth. Instincts take over and she takes the tip of Rio's thumb just barely between pouty lips, "Do you wanna get on your knees for me?"</p><p>It's phrased like a question, but not said like one. It's said like Rio is peeling back the layers of Agatha's brain and picking out her deepest desires, "Do it then. Kneel for me."</p><p>And she does—thuds to her knees so she can please Rio. Rio can't leave if she's doing everything they ask.</p><p>"Easy, baby." Rio's face flickers when she drops to the floor, "Don't hurt yourself."</p><p>"Fuck off. I'm fine." Agatha snaps, feels the clouds over her mind clear a little.</p><p>"That's not very nice," Rio says, runs their fingers through Agatha's hair, across her scalp, and her eyes slip shut as she leans into the touch, "Do you feel better on your knees?"</p><p>Agatha glowers up at them—though doesn't quite know if it has the same effect as usual from where she's kneeling with her arms bound behind her back.</p><p>"No? You gonna ignore me?" Rio says, voice low and amused, "And I was gonna be so nice to you too."</p><p>Agatha's brain latches onto that—the need to ask jamming into her like she's a pincushion for her thoughts, "What—" Her words come out a little stuck, and so she swallows, tries again, "What were you gonna do?"</p><p>Rio's eyes gleam and they step away from Agatha to sit on the edge of her bed, just like last time, leaning back a little, legs spread, which is a little unfair in Agatha's opinion.</p><p>Admittedly, she's a little distracted by the thick, dark hair between Rio's legs, the happy trail that connects it on show as they wait for Agatha to finish her staring, "Was gonna let you touch me like you said you wanted."</p><p>"How am I gonna touch you with no hands?"</p><p>"What do you think you're on your knees for?"</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath in through her nose, <em>"Fuck, I</em>—" Even being on her knees, she hadn't expected it to be heading this way, "I want my mouth on you."</p><p>"Then you can be a good girl and tell me how you're feeling, can't you baby?"</p><p>God, <em>that's</em> a lethal combination. She finds herself wanting—more than power, more than control, more than anything right now—to hear that again. The way her brain reacts to those words is fucking addictive in ways Agatha didn't ever think she'd experience.</p><p>"It feels good," She says, shuffles forward to get closer to Rio once more, heat prickling up the back of her neck as she sees herself from outside of her own body for a moment and part of her wants to force herself to her feet, angry that she's forced to move on her knees—only a step above <em>crawling</em> to Rio. That part of her is very small though, and overpowered by her need to be <em>close.</em> "It feels good to just <em>do."</em></p><p>Rio nods like they know what she means and watches Agatha, now between their legs, rest her head on their thigh, face turned enough to press the corner of her mouth to their skin.</p><p>"I wasn't sure how not into being touched you were." Agatha says, recalls Rio's words from the time she tied them up in demonstration.</p><p>"I like it when I get to choose how." They bite their lip, eyes darting around Agatha's face like they want to keep looking at her but aren't sure how.</p><p>"You're lucky then," Agatha mumbles against Rio's skin, "Liking being told what to do is a more recent development." A more <em>Rio</em> development is probably more accurate. She takes a deep breath, the smell of Rio's skin is obvious, but not as much as the smell of their arousal—not when Agatha is this close, "Let me get my mouth on you."</p><p>She edges closer to the apex of Rio's thighs, feels the clouds settle steadily over her brain the closer she gets.</p><p>"Ask nicely, baby."</p><p>Maybe if she'd done this before she'd have more self restraint. But since her own orgasm is the only thing she's tasted off Rio, she's not looking to leave it up to imagination much longer, eyes fluttering shut and rocking forward, "Please."</p><p>"You can do better than that." They say because they're extraordinarily <em>cruel,</em> "And open your eyes this time, sweetheart."</p><p>Agatha's brought herself so close to them that she can stuff her head into their lower stomach to whine into the skin there. Rio waits out her brief tantrum, only reaches out to wrap a lock of Agatha's hair around their finger.</p><p><em>"Please</em> let me eat you out," She says, looks up at them from between their legs, "Rio, <em>please,</em> I wanna taste you on my tongue. I wanna be able to taste you every time I think of you."</p><p>It's a level of desperation usually reserved for non-Agatha people, but <em>fuck,</em> she <em>needs</em> this.</p><p>It's almost enough just to receive Rio's proud gaze, but then they mutter, "Such a good girl for me." And fist into Agatha's hair to pull her in.</p><p>Agatha goes willingly, doesn't want to fight it, isn't in any position to tease. She noses through their hair, moans at the taste of them—so strong it's in the air even before she licks through them.</p><p>Agatha likes to take her time, spread out her partner, push their thighs apart so that she can <em>see</em> them. She likes to have them begging, even if not with words, to get her mouth on them. It's a reward, of course.</p><p>It's not like that with Rio. Her mind empties of anything but Rio's taste as soon as her tongue is on them; she doesn't waste any time committing the way they feel against her mouth to memory.</p><p><em>God,</em> the feeling of them dripping for her is unparalleled—knowing how much they want her. She buries her face deeper, hands flexing for the first time against her rope, wants them freed so that she can reach up Rio's body, brush over their abs with her fingers, feel them twitch into her mouth from the touch.</p><p>The thought of how wet Rio had got from tying her up is particularly potent—it clings to the hair Agatha buries herself in—not that it's anything but a good thing, she wants to be covered in Rio.</p><p>She's usually talkative too, with other people. With Rio, she can't bring herself to tear away from their taste for long enough to even take solid breaths, nevermind start denying herself of them with <em>words.</em></p><p>They start to get a little restless after a while, breath coming in shorter pants, hand periodically flexing in her hair and pulling her in even closer, and that's when she wraps her lips around their clit and sucks.</p><p>"Oh <em>fuck,</em> Agatha—"</p><p>Her name is choked out on Rio's tongue, and <em>god,</em> she loves the way it sounds. Agatha keeps sucking on Rio's clit, manages for the most part to keep her tongue away from it. It doesn't seem to matter though—Rio's hips slam up into her face, as they come.</p><p>And Rio, even though they've just been barrelled over by their orgasm, tries to keep their hips pressed to the bed, tries to stutter out a mid-orgasm apology that Agatha is <em>not</em> having. She just presses herself further against Rio and breathes through the new coppery smell in her nose.</p><p>Once their orgasm subsides, Rio shakily sits up a little—puts their abs to good use to hold themself up as they cup Agatha's face in their palms.</p><p>"Baby, let me…" They trail off as they check her face over.</p><p>"Did you break my nose, Rio?" Agatha pants, licks her lips for more <em>Rio</em> since she was unwillingly pulled away, "I happen to like my nose."</p><p>"Me too," Rio mumbles, almost imperceptibly—like it wasn't really a conscious response made for Agatha's ears, "You look fine. There's no blood."</p><p>Agatha hums, "Yeah, that wouldn't be my first choice in ways you could make me bleed."</p><p>Rio's face is already red from exertion, but their ears pink a little further and they stammer without making any real progress with any sort of language.</p><p>"Lay back down, I wasn't done."</p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p>"Come on," Agatha intends for her voice to drop low and sultry, thinks instead it comes out a little impatient, a little whiny, "Let me make you come again."</p><p>Rio hums, leans back on one elbow and brings Agatha's head back between their thighs, where she <em>needs</em> to be.</p><p>It doesn't take long to build them up this time, she can tell. Their thighs start to shake after only a minute, and the hand that was in her hair leaves to white knuckle the bed sheets.</p><p>Agatha's sure to flick her tongue over their clit this time with her lips wrapped around it—hadn't expected them to come before she could deploy that move.</p><p>It proves overwhelming for them, and they let out a rumbling groan as they come once more.</p><p>Agatha stays there, mouth working them softly through their orgasm. <em>God,</em> she'd fucking <em>kill</em> to shove her hand between her own thighs right now. Her motions become more open mouthed kisses against them more than anything after a while, until they push Agatha's head away, with a breathless, "I can't."</p><p>Honestly Agatha's happy staying on her knees, but Rio seems to be the needy type after they come, wants her close. She's not about to argue with the way the encourage her to stand, hands solid on her body and helping steady her without the use of her own.</p><p>They pull her onto the bed, let Agatha straddle one of their thighs. She thought it best if they want her near.</p><p>Rio looks at her like no one ever has before—a look sort of like awe that renders her speechless.</p><p>In fact, there's nothing going on with Agatha beyond the startling realization that she wants to <em>kiss</em> Rio—if only to put their own taste back in their mouth. She hadn't realized she'd rocked so close to them until her eyes drift up from Rio's face to their deep brown eyes and finds them looking at her own lips.</p><p>She doesn't mean to but she hears herself whisper <em>please</em> and lets Rio close the gap between them like they'd only been waiting for her to ask.</p><p>It starts softer than Agatha would have expected when she still has Rio's come in her mouth—just a gentle joining of their lips. And then they pull back, just enough for their eyes to lock. There's something <em>raw</em> there; Rio must see it reflected in her own eyes because after that initial kiss, they come back together messily, Agatha not wasting any time to push her tongue into Rio's mouth.</p><p>They moan—at Agatha's tongue in their mouth or the taste of themself on her tongue, she doesn't know. The reason doesn't matter so much as the vibration she can feel as their teeth clash.</p><p>It's like they've been starved of each other, even though this only started not even a week ago, the way they don't come up for air, the way there's no space between their bodies—not with the way Rio has their arms wrapped around her back. It helps keep her steady when she almost fully topples onto Rio without the use of her hands.</p><p>Rio's panting when they break apart, and she looks at them long enough without any exchange of words to realize she is too. And they're smiling.</p><p>"I can't believe that was the first time we kissed."</p><p>Agatha doesn't know why. It's not like they've had much reason to before. And honestly, if it hadn't been for the way the stopper has been unceremoniously pulled from her inhibitions, she probably would have held off for longer.</p><p>So she doesn't answer—doesn't know if anything she could say would be right, and seeks to change the subject entirely, "I need you to fuck me."</p><p>The smile barely fades from Rio's face as they press a kiss to her jaw. Agatha can feel the curve of their lips against her skin, "How do you want it?"</p><p>They keep trailing kisses—from jaw to cheek to lips, because that's something they do now apparently.</p><p>Agatha's not in much of a position to think and so her answer comes as the only thing that feels right, "Strap." She mumbles against Rio's lips, doesn't want to say too much and break the kiss too soon.</p><p>The kiss ends with Rio helping Agatha to move off their lap. Which she'd maybe fight harder if she didn't know they were going to do as she'd asked and strap up.</p><p>They leave her on the bed, kneeling and watching Rio cross the room to her own toy chest like they own it, cranes her neck to see them pull the harness up their hips and then gets a wonderful view of their ass as they bend over to look through her collection.</p><p>She presses her thighs together in anticipation, feels the slick that's dripped from her cunt against them as she watches Rio fit a strap into the harness.</p><p>"You can use other things too. If you want." Agatha says, can't stop herself, itches to be <em>full</em> after not having Rio in her at all yet. For as much as she loved getting to <em>finally</em> eat Rio out, she's hyper-aware that they've come <em>twice</em> when the most she's been touched was to tie her up.</p><p>Rio hesitates, keeps their back to Agatha, "What sort of things?"</p><p>Agatha swallows, brain and throat caramelized in the same way as she thinks about everything she owns, "Whatever you want that's in there," She wants, first and foremost, to know what <em>Rio's</em> choice is, "I'll tell you if I don't want it. Traffic lights. Remember?"</p><p>She can see the tension in Rio's back lessen at that and they lean back down to the chest.</p><p>It's funny, they must have something in mind—something they'd seen before, because they don't rummage. They turn back to Agatha with a satin pouch in hand. She knows what's in that one.</p><p>"I haven't been able to stop thinking about this since I saw it here last time," They say, take a few steps towards Agatha, who can't do much except stare at the bag, imagining Rio pushing the purple jewelled heart plug inside of her. They must mistake her silence for uncertainty because they sound a lot less sure of themself when they say, "We don't have to use the strap at the same time. We don't have to use this at all."</p><p>"No," Agatha says, almost cuts off the end of Rio's words, "I want it," She swallows heavy, clarifies, "I want them both."</p><p>Rio's lips part, a breath escaping as they come closer to the bed, "You ever done this before?"</p><p>"Not with another person."</p><p>"Not with…" Rio's voice is barely louder than a whisper as they repeat her own words, "By yourself?"</p><p>Agatha only nods.</p><p><em>"Fuck,</em> Agatha," Rio sounds pained, "The thought of you—" They cut themself off. It's cute that they can't talk about her fucking herself when she's got the plug inside of herself when they're about to do it themself. "I um. I've never… done this. What do you need from me?"</p><p>That's one of Agatha's favorite things about Rio—always asking how they can help, what she needs from them, never makes her needs feel like burdens. It's something Agatha wouldn't pride herself on.</p><p>"I was maybe sort of hoping for something like this," Agatha admits, "I might have prepared a little earlier. Just in case."</p><p>Rio's jaw drops a little, the shape their eyes sit at drops a little, makes them look less contained.</p><p>And Agatha likes the way it looks, is about to tease them but they get there first, "You hoped I'd fuck your ass?"</p><p>Agatha won't lie about this, "Yes. Please."</p><p>Rio runs their hand over their face, eyes to the ceiling and Agatha waits unmoving until they're back on her. They move to the bed, grab two of Agatha's pillows and stacks them in the middle of the bed, encourages Agatha to bend over and rest her head against them.</p><p>She doesn't <em>want</em> them to move away and she whines when she feels them leave the space next to her.</p><p>"Relax, baby," They say, voice smooth, "I'm just grabbing lube."</p><p>She's a little embarrassed that all it took was Rio being away from her for a few seconds to have her whining, but then Rio's hands are on her hips, and then her ass, spreading her, and her body forgets how humiliation works.</p><p>One of Rio's thumbs is decidedly closer to her ass than the other and she tries to back herself into the touch.</p><p>Rio doesn't let her, of course, removes the touch entirely as Agatha is forced to listen to the cap of the lube bottle pop open, and the subsequent slick noises of them lubing their fingers up.</p><p>And then all she knows is the press of a single finger.</p><p>Rio's hands are warm, she thinks stupidly, one big hand resting on the small of her back, as their finger presses just barely inside her, just to the first knuckle. Somehow it feels <em>more</em> when it's Rio's instead of her own.</p><p>"Color?"</p><p><em>"Green."</em> Agatha breathes out, no need to even <em>think</em> about it, tilts her head to press her face further into the bed when she feels Rio's finger press deeper inside her.</p><p>They go slow, pump that single finger inside her without any ounce of the urgency Agatha is feeling. When she feels them pull back enough to line up a second finger, she grows a little restless, pushes back as soon as the tips of both fingers are inside her, catches Rio off guard enough for her to take them almost to the knuckle.</p><p>Rio just lets out a bark of laughter before moving the hand from her back. The sound of the smack registers just before the sting, the pleasure of it. Agatha drools into her pillow, feels her cunt clench around fucking <em>nothing.</em></p><p>"Greedy girl." Rio says, spanks her again to punctuate their words, "If you're that ready for it…"</p><p>Rio pulls their fingers out, and Agatha is about to protest until she hears the cap of the lube opening once more and settles.</p><p>She waits for it, more patient than she's maybe ever been for anything in her life, and then her reward—the metal of the plug pressing against her. She stays quiet, doesn't want to give Rio any reason not to let her have this, and in return, gets the brain slowing feeling of the plug stretching her out.</p><p><em>"Rio—"</em> Agatha gasps, has no need to say it, doesn't have anything to tell them, ask them, just likes the feel of their name on her tongue.</p><p>Rio seems to understand, the hand that had spanked her moves to her back once more, strokes over the skin in a soothing motion as the plug easily slides inside her.</p><p><em>"Fuck,"</em> Rio breathes when it's all the way in, "You don't understand how fucking good you look."</p><p><em>"Rio—"</em> Agatha says again—a plea this time.</p><p>"I know, baby. I've got you." They say, even when they <em>don't</em> fill her cunt, which is fucking rude.</p><p>Instead, they fit a hand under her chest and start to tug her up. Agatha goes with them, finds herself kneeling once more, the plug shifting inside her with the movement.</p><p>"You literally had me bent over and you're choosing <em>not</em> to fuck me like this?" Agatha grits out.</p><p>Rio's voice is deep in return when they move around the bed to face Agatha once more, like they can't contain their arousal enough to keep their voice at a clear pitch, "Wanna see how long you can ride me for before you can't hold yourself up."</p><p><em>Oh.</em></p><p><em>Fuck.</em></p><p>Agatha's eyes drop to their cock, looking more like <em>theirs</em> than it had ever looked <em>hers.</em></p><p>"Let me get you ready." She says, digs her nails into her forearms because it's the only fucking thing she has access to.</p><p>Rio doesn't let her move from the bed though, "I don't want you to hurt yourself if you're on your knees for that long again."</p><p>"We're still in our twenties, Rio."</p><p>"Yeah, and I heard your knee click when you stood up before," Rio says, evil, "Come on, baby." They grip hold of Agatha's hip in one hand, hold her back steady with the other as they encourage her to straddle them. She goes to line herself up with the tip of their cock immediately, but Rio's hands are strong on her hips, stopping her.</p><p>"Rio, do <em>not</em> tease me right now," Agatha says, teeth together, feels herself clench once more around nothing but the plug inside of her. And it's far from the biggest one she has, does nothing to make up for the fact she's being denied Rio's cock, "I've waited long enough."</p><p>"You said you wanted to get me ready," Rio says, looks smug as they encourage Agatha to grind against their solid length, "So get me ready."</p><p>Agatha's hips start moving before her brain takes in the instruction, getting Rio's strap wet with nothing but her own slick.</p><p><em>They have no reason to make her do this,</em> the usually sane voice in Agatha's voice tells her, <em>they have lube right in their reach. They're demeaning you by making you do this.</em></p><p>But it's not loud enough to cover up the feral demon banging around her brain saying, <em>let them take you, let them have you, let them own you.</em></p><p>And so she commits herself to grinding herself against them—the only touch her cunt has had all night.</p><p>After a while though, she grows restless, though not from the idea that Rio's trying to purposely demean her, and more from the way she thinks she might grind herself into an orgasm before she even gets them inside her, "Rio, please," She wants <em>desperately</em> to have them inside her, to come on their cock, "You wanna be inside me, right?"</p><p>Rio sucks on their teeth, the picture of someone level and unbothered by Agatha's display, "I don't know if you're ready for me yet. You were so <em>tight</em> for me last time, I don't wanna hurt you."</p><p><em>They're just teasing you,</em> the more composed voice speaks evenly, <em>it'll be a stretch with the plug but not enough to really hurt.</em></p><p>But that's not the voice that wins.</p><p>"I don't care," Agatha sobs—sobs, really, "Make it hurt," She tucks her head between the junction of Rio's neck and shoulder, "Make me <em>yours."</em></p><p>That's what gets Rio, ultimately, and they lift her up, hands cupping her ass as they help line her up with their strap.</p><p>The stretch is unreal; it's everything she needs. She's suddenly grateful for the lack of touch her cunt has been granted—doubts it would feel quite the same if she'd been built up. It's just another example of Rio knowing her needs before she does.</p><p>When she's fully in Rio's lap, all Agatha knows is the absolute fullness of having them in her cunt with the plug in her ass, can barely force the muscles in her legs to lift her up without Rio's help.</p><p>It blurs a little after that, Rio helping her sink onto their strap over and over again as her brain empties, keeps her upright with a careful hand on her back.</p><p>Agatha doesn't think she's ever sped to an orgasm this fast before. She always makes sure to take her pleasure, of course, but it is orchestrated. Nothing before has ever been like sex with Rio. The head-emptying feeling she gets when she's with them is like nothing she's ever felt before; pleasure isn't pre-meditated—she doesn't know exactly how many orgasms she's going to get tonight because <em>she's</em> decided.</p><p>Even when Rio says, "You can come as many times as you want, baby. You've been such a good girl for me." She doesn't know—isn't in her brain enough to <em>choose</em> how many times she wants to come, will let it happen until she physically can't.</p><p>Agatha <em>sobs</em> against their neck, nips at the skin there and then crashes into her first orgasm—trusts Rio to keep her upright when she crumbles.</p><p>When she comes back to herself, Rio is helping move her, hands on her hips and grinding up into her to push her towards her second orgasm. It won't take long, just with the sheer show of strength alone. Agatha has <em>just</em> enough awareness to have the thought that maybe she should have been skipping her yoga class to do deadlifts or whatever the fuck with Rio instead, before their lips press against her neck in what Agatha hopes it a kiss biting enough to leave a mark for days to come. And it's this that has her coming again.</p><p>Rio doesn't let up, keeps to their promise to let her come as many times as she wants, trusts that she'll tell them when she's done.</p><p>A third orgasm comes with them pressing on the jewel base of her plug, and a fourth when they pull it out just enough for the widest point to stretch her open, holds it there for a moment with their cock buried inside her, and then pushes it back inside when she <em>begs</em> to have it back.</p><p><em>"Rio."</em> She says, when she's unable to hold herself up any longer, sunk into her best friend's neck, tears starting to track down her cheeks with the want to <em>touch</em> Rio, to hold them close.</p><p>"Are you done?" Rio says, gentle.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head a little, "I just—" She cuts herself off at the thought of having to tell them she wants to be fucked in <em>missionary.</em></p><p>"You have to use your words, sweetheart."</p><p>She bites into Rio's shoulder, and in a quiet voice says, "Can you untie me?"</p><p>Rio gets it then—helps Agatha lift up and gently puts her down face first in the bed, unties the rope with ease as they mutter things like <em>my good girl, you've done so well,</em> and most notably, <em>I love you.</em></p><p>Then the rope is gone, Rio helping to unfold her arms from where they've been held behind her back, and massaging them lightly.</p><p>"Rio, <em>please."</em> Agatha gasps wet into the pillow, doesn't want Rio to think she wants to be done yet—not when she was promised all the orgasms she wants, and she wants another.</p><p>"I've got you, my love." Rio says, which doesn't help the tears. They roll her gently over onto her back, and her heavy arms lift to wrap around their neck with the <em>need</em> to have them close.</p><p>Rio pushes back inside—the feeling different now she's had them inside for so long. She only knows it feels <em>right.</em></p><p>One of Rio's hands is in her hair—not gripping, just holding, and the other strokes down her body until they reach her neglected clit.</p><p>The lack of touch it's had this whole time has her shivering through what she knows to be her final orgasm of the night, pulling Rio close into a kiss that's more just her breathing into their mouth.</p><p>There must be something that happens in the time between her orgasm coursing through her veins and Rio easing the strap out, pressing kisses to her wet cheeks as they massage her tight shoulders, but she doesn't quite know what.</p><p>"You're so perfect," They tell her when they help her roll over, "You did so good tonight." They say when they start to ease the plug out. The words heat her up—not in her lower belly, but in her chest—somewhere around her heart.</p><p>And, <em>god,</em> she just lets herself sink into the feeling, lets herself be loved for once.</p><p>She'll let them take care of her in the literal sense—a bottle of cold water from the fridge, a snack, a bath maybe—later. For now, Agatha just turns her head into Rio's arms, nuzzles until they get the idea and cover her with their own body.</p><p>(She tells herself that four—five? orgasms are enough to make anyone a little more needy.</p><p>She tells herself that it's the reason her heart swells with the need to tell Rio she loves them—really loves them.</p><p>Because that would be a ridiculous thing to tell someone she's only slept with three times, and so can't be true.)</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Days later, Agatha <em>does</em> let Rio take them to that museum. She probably has a much better time than she would if she were actually on a date, so she's glad it's them.</p><p>They do half the museum before circling back to the restaurant—Rio telling her to grab whatever table she wants, knows she's picky about where she sits, what way she's facing, and orders for both of them. Agatha trusts them to get her something she'll like.</p><p>Her eyes go between her phone and Rio—texts with Alice pulled up for nothing but cover, honestly, when a shadow blocks her light.</p><p>A woman with bright eyes smiles down at her, and Agatha knows something's not right when she doesn't immediately collate a list of ways to make sure she's in this woman's bed by the end of the day.</p><p>"This seat taken?" She says, and Agatha doesn't even get the chance to answer that it is, before Rio's all but slamming the tray onto the table, spilling a little of their coffees over the lip of the mugs.</p><p>"It is." They say, no room for argument. Agatha doesn't need them to fend anyone off for her, but she won't say it's not appreciated.</p><p>"Right," She says, spares Rio no more than a glance, "And are <em>you</em> taken?"</p><p>Rio cuts in once again, "She is."</p><p>"Maybe wanna let your friend answer?"</p><p>"Sorry," Rio says, sickening smile on their face—one they probably got from Agatha at some point, "Maybe I wasn't clear. She's mine."</p><p>Agatha's spine tingles with their possession—loves it but knows she can't, knows realistically there's nothing stopping her from getting this woman's number.</p><p>The knowledge doesn't stop her from reaching out across the table, and resting her hand on Rio's, thumb stroking over the skin.</p><p>The unimportant, nameless woman leaves when Rio sits down.</p><p>"Rio, you didn't have to—"</p><p>"I didn't like her," They huff, empty a sugar sachet into Agatha's coffee, "She can't—"</p><p>"I get it," Agatha interrupts, "You're a good best friend." The words leave her throat like the scrape of tiny knives, "The <em>best</em> best friend." She doubles down, grin on her face she hopes looks real.</p><p>Because it's been days of mind blowing, heart clenching sex, where Agatha doesn't know how to put her feelings to the side until it's over. And unfortunately, somewhere, somehow, she thinks she's fallen in love with Rio.</p><p>Rio blinks at her, and for a moment she thinks she might have said something wrong, "Best friend." They repeat.</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha says, finds herself fighting against tears in the stupid bright museum restaurant, "You'll always be my best friend."</p><p>She just hopes that she gets over them before they get bored of her.</p>

<p>There's a sick sort of feeling in the pit of Rio's belly; has been since they woke. It swirls in time with the way they stir their coffee until it whirlpools enough for them to pour a little creamer in—how they've always done it.</p><p>It's a quiet morning. When they have the time, they like to open their windows, listen to the birds for a while before running their fingers over the spines of the records on their shelf as if picking one at random—even though they know the order by heart now.</p><p>Rio likes to fake spontaneity, likes to imagine that maybe they could be more like Agatha.</p><p>In all honesty, the only spontaneous things Rio has ever done have been because of Agatha—brain switching off a little more around her, just enough to not overthink too much.</p><p><em>("Tell me now," Agatha says, holds back a laugh as she holds a knife up to Rio, "Are you really an old man disguised in a hot, young body?"</em></p><p><em>Rio feels the blush heating their cheeks before they can even think to try to hide it, "What do you mean?"</em></p><p><em>"Rio," Agatha sighs as if exasperated, though Rio knows she probably isn't, "Your morning routine is talking to the birds that nest in the tree outside your window, playing one of your </em>many <em>records, and doing a crossword from your fucking little book of crosswords."</em></p><p><em>"So?"</em></p><p><em>"That's what old people do," Agatha drags out the 'ooh' like she's a child throwing a tantrum, "I deserve a little honesty."</em></p><p><em>Rio grins, "You're just jealous.")</em></p><p>Rio's bar for spontaneity sits comfortably somewhere around having toast for breakfast on a day they'd usually have cereal. Agatha likes to push that. Rio lets her. They don't remember the last time Agatha encouraged them to do something on par with having sex with someone just <em>on a whim.</em></p><p>For good reason, Rio's brain jabs.</p><p>And it's not wrong; spontaneity causes carelessness, and carelessness causes mistakes.</p><p><em>"You're a good best friend," </em>They hear, mind and belly swimming, <em>"The </em>best<em> best friend."</em></p><p>It's entirely Rio's fault. It's on them for not checking Agatha's feelings aligned with their own, for not cutting this whole thing off when it rooted and threatened to grow into something more. Rio has had two nights and a morning of amazing sex and didn't once think to check how Agatha <em>I-don't-do-relationships</em> Harkness was feeling about it all.</p><p>So Rio sits in the quiet of the morning, doesn't want the normalcy of hearing the birds, of listening to one of their favorite albums. They just sit in the stillness with their own thoughts, feeling fucking <em>guilty</em> instead.</p><p>If Rio had been honest from the start—honest about their feelings for Agatha—then she never would have asked for Rio to tie her up, certainly wouldn't have taken her clothes off, asked for Rio to touch her.</p><p>And naively, Rio had thought Agatha felt the same, had been so fucking <em>happy</em> when Agatha easily agreed to be exclusive. It's obvious to them now that it didn't even cross her mind that Rio was asking for the beginnings of a relationship. Agatha has always been very open about her lack of desire for a romantic relationship; she has sex without feelings all the time. Rio doesn't know why they thought it would be different with them.</p><p>Rio's phone buzzes on the kitchen counter where they'd left it, breaks the silence. They contemplate leaving it but their fingers itch with the need to check it—at least ninety percent sure it's Agatha. And Rio is and always has been weak for her.</p><p><strong><em>Agatha</em></strong><br/><em>can i come over?</em></p><p>Rio bites their lip, puts their phone down without replying, just stares as another message comes through.</p><p><strong><em>Agatha</em></strong><br/><em>i want to see you</em></p><p>Rio imagines breaking things off with her; throwing out some explanation that isn't quite the whole ugly truth of it. They reason that it's better to quit while they still can—before it gets too much for both of them, goes too deep. If they were a better adjusted person, maybe they might. But since they're not—</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio would like to say they managed to resist Agatha's charms, and that they tried very hard to break things off—<em>Agatha, we need to talk.</em> But the truth is that they haven't had a coherent thought, haven't said even a single word to her since she barrelled through their apartment door.</p><p>Agatha—the more talkative of the pair of them anyway—only manages to get out a breathy <em>hi</em> before her hand is gripping the back of Rio's neck and Rio can taste cinnamon on her tongue.</p><p>Maybe they shouldn't be doing this. Maybe Rio should push Agatha away and confess, should be forced to live with the sticky guilt of it. But the way Agatha gasps against them empties their mind of any thought—rational or not—as their mouth finds Agatha's neck, their teeth scrape over her throat and their hands struggle to find a gap between their bodies to unbutton her jeans.</p><p>Rio thinks everyone has been reading their dynamic wrong their entire lives; <em>Agatha Harkness is the most selfish person I know. She'll use you up and leave you with nothing.</em> Rio knows the truth is that they're just as selfish, maybe more so by the way their panicked thoughts start to slow the more of Agatha's breath they take for themself.</p><p>It's all very <em>quick,</em> and they're not stupid enough not to notice they can feel how wet Agatha is even through her underwear.</p><p>Rio pulls away from her neck just enough to pant heavily against the side of Agatha's face, takes their time long enough—a couple of seconds at most—to agitate Agatha, who bites Rio's bottom lip in retaliation, in punishment.</p><p>Rio finds they don't mind so much when it's Agatha doling out the punishments.</p><p>"Touch me," She says, grinds the words between her teeth.</p><p>"You're so wet," Agatha's lips are still against theirs as they speak, "I've barely touched you."</p><p>And maybe the words <em>do</em> come out a little like an accusation though they don't mean them to—just want to know what's in Agatha's mind to have her like this so soon, want to know every detail that pounds through her skull.</p><p>Agatha squirms against them a little, huffs and tightens her grip on the back of Rio's neck, nails digging in a little. Rio finds more pleasure in it than they want to admit right now.</p><p>"What would you say if I told you I'd been touching myself before I came here?"</p><p>Rio can tell Agatha tries to catch them off guard, tries to take control of the direction of the conversation, even as their mouth runs a little dry and their throat makes a weird sort of clicking sound as air tries to pass through. They understand how this side of Agatha works now, though she doesn't seem to realize that. "I'd ask you why you couldn't make yourself come without me."</p><p>Agatha snarls, bucks her hips up against Rio's stilled fingers before her free hand moves Rio's <em>inside</em> her underwear, presses their fingers <em>hard</em> up against her own clit and lets out a sigh, eyes fluttering a little at the touch.</p><p>Rio honestly doesn't want to deny her, doesn't want to deny themself just as much, drags their fingers lower, presses the tips inside Agatha just slightly—finds she parts for them with ease, but all the same says, "Admit it," They lick up the shell of Agatha's ear, catch the way her legs momentarily struggle to hold her, "It's not the same anymore. You <em>need</em> me."</p><p>Before Rio can properly sink deep inside Agatha, there's a knock on their door that they're almost fully committed to ignoring, wants to cover Agatha's mouth with their hand to quiet her so whoever is at their door leaves them alone, but, <em>shit—</em></p><p>Their peripheral vision kicks back in with a blink and their favorite neighbor's face comes into view, has them nearly jumping out of their skin, fingers twitching just barely inside Agatha's cunt before they have time to realize they hadn't closed the fucking door, too caught up in <em>Agatha, Agatha, Agatha—</em></p><p>"This is usually the type of show you have to pay for," Lilia raises an eyebrow, mouth pinched tight. Rio can't tell if she's disgusted or holding back a laugh. "So if you're not charging, you should probably close the door."</p><p>"Ms Calderu—"</p><p>Agatha doesn't give either of them a chance to say anything else, and Rio might be smug if they weren't panicking so much because Agatha holds their wrist still, very plainly doesn't want their hand going anywhere, and slams the door shut with the other.</p><p>"Fuck me." She almost growls against Rio's open mouth.</p><p>And Rio can't really be blamed for not being able to think of a single good reason not to. Not when they have Agatha's voice in their ear whispering things like <em>need you to fill me up,</em> and <em>I've been so empty without your fingers,</em> and definitely not when she moans <em>nothing compares to this with you.</em></p><p>Rio is selfish and takes the words as they want to hear them.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>So, Rio doesn't break things off. But that's okay because eventually Agatha will do that for them. She'll get bored of her latest fuck and drop them for someone else, and Rio has until then to learn to be okay with that, to get over her again.</p><p>There must be something in the air alongside the smell of sex as Agatha naps on their chest, sweaty and exhausted, that convinces them they don't need <em>more</em> than what Agatha is willing to offer, that only feeding it, letting it grow insatiable will ruin them.</p><p>They run their fingers up and down Agatha's bare back as the pieces click together maybe a little too easily.</p><p>There's hardly been a time since their friendship with Agatha bloomed that Rio hasn't been in love with her, and for the longest time they've managed to fit that away in a locked box and put it to the back of their mind.</p><p>Agatha has always said she's not a person built for love, that she's hard to get along with, and that she knows she's a difficult person to like.</p><p>Rio has never really had a firm grasp of how true any of those statements could be. Agatha is the person they like the most—easily and unquestionably her friend, and falling in love with her was the simplest decision they never made.</p><p>If there's anyone who can untangle their feelings from reality, it's Rio. They've been doing it for half their life.</p><p>And the rest of it—the sex that Rio should have found most difficult, most embarrassing, is easy too. Agatha is so open, leaves no room for doubt about what she wants. Rio feels their chest flush remembering how she'd asked for them to <em>fuck her until she can't feel her toes,</em> and how Rio had ended up having to move her after—legs like jelly; the muscles in her calves visibly twitching.</p><p>And for every time the little voice of doubt rings out in the back of their mind, says, <em>you're so selfish, Rio Vidal,</em> and <em>this isn't fair to her,</em> they're only reminded of Agatha's own words, <em>I won't regret it,</em> and <em>I want this, </em>and <em>why would I need anyone but you?</em></p><p>In all honesty, this is—has always been all about Agatha. All <em>for</em> Agatha. It is selfish maybe to keep her from every last fact. Less so to give her exactly what she wants—especially when they want the same thing. Especially when Agatha has explicitly told them she couldn't do any of this with anyone but them.</p><p>Maybe this new thing between them will have to end someday, but not today, and not because of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes, because they know what Agatha is like, touching her makes Rio feel like they're cradling a bomb in their hands.</p><p>There are times when Agatha gets a bit quiet, a bit contemplative, and Rio thinks, <em>this is it, we had a good run, but it's over now,</em> but Agatha always shakes herself out of it. Usually, these are <em>also</em> the times she brings up something <em>new,</em> something Rio isn't prepared for.</p><p>She looks like that now—chewing on her bottom lip, her head between Rio's thighs after making them come on her tongue. Normally, there's a sort of mad scramble—especially when Agatha has been made to wait for her orgasm, has been told to give Rio one first. This time, she sits back on her toes, bites the remaining taste of Rio from her lips and stares somewhere a little past them.</p><p>"Is everything okay?" Rio says, pushes themself fully up and cups Agatha's cheeks in their palms.</p><p>She blinks out of it, demeanor changing enough for Rio to know that when she says, "Was wondering when you were gonna <em>properly</em> fuck my ass," that it wasn't really all she wanted to say, "I can tell from your increasingly wandering hands that you want to."</p><p>It gives Agatha exactly what she wanted though, Rio imagines. Their mind is flooded with the thought of doing just that and Agatha fucking <em>knows</em> it—her lips curl around a smirk even when her eyes remain the same watery blue.</p><p>Rio's mouth runs dry, "You want it?"</p><p>Agatha runs her palms up Rio's thighs, digs her nails in near their hips and <em>drags</em> them back down again. Rio whimpers, falls back onto their elbows as they hear Agatha's self-satisfied chuckle fill the room as she rises to climb into their lap, "Do I ever ask for things I don't want?"</p><p>Rio doesn't point out that she's asked for Rio, begged for Rio, but still doesn't want them the same way they want her.</p><p>"How am I supposed to give you what you want," They start, hands grasping Agatha's hips and sliding to her ass, grip tightening and spreading her just a little, a tease, "If you don't give me a chance to strap up for you?"</p><p>Rio watches as Agatha's eyes flutter closed and she hums, rolls her hips like there's something there for her to grind into, "It's so cruel that you're not just always ready for me."</p><p>"I <em>am."</em> Rio insists, rolls their hips up into Agatha's, <em>is</em> always ready for her really.</p><p>Agatha starts up a grumble and Rio takes the opening to flip their positions, gets Agatha onto her back, the air pushed from her lungs as she lands.</p><p>"You can wait for me, right?" They say and push themself off Agatha without waiting for a response, since Agatha, given any opportunity, is <em>not</em> good at waiting.</p><p>The lack of opening doesn't seem to matter; Agatha follows them up off the bed, wraps her arms around Rio from behind and mutters in their ear, quiet and almost shy—everything she isn't, "Can I help you?"</p><p>Rio has to hide their smile, "Your benevolence astounds me."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Agatha bites their shoulder, isn't gentle about it. Rio can feel her smile against the marked skin when they let out a yelp, "The sooner we get you ready, the sooner I can have you inside me."</p><p>Rio hums but all the same allows Agatha to slink past them to open the bottom drawer where they keep their steadily growing set of toys. They <em>do</em> have to step in and guide Agatha's wandering, greedy hands away from a strap she'd probably have a hard time taking for the first time, mollifies her by saying, <em>we'll work up to it,</em> and encourages her towards the smallest strap they own.</p><p>"You don't seem confident about the size of your dick today." Agatha sniffs as she tightens the harness around their hips, fits the dark green strap into the o-ring.</p><p>There must be something wrong with Rio to have Agatha try to shame them, and for the only response that comes to mind to fist their hand in her hair and guide her mouth to their cock.</p><p>They've never had her mouth on them like this, didn't know they <em>wanted</em> so badly. Yet more proof that they're not as selfless as perhaps people think.</p><p><em>Oh,</em> and Agatha knows it, one hand wraps around Rio's cock and the other guides their hand to her head, slowly blinks up at them like she can see everything they're thinking.</p><p>"Do you like me like this?"</p><p><em>Like what?</em> Rio could say with a smirk, play it cool and flip the script, make Agatha have to vocalize it.</p><p>But they can be just as needy as Agatha, and their hand tightens its grip, voice gravelly when they say <em>yes</em> and push themself into Agatha's willing mouth.</p><p>Rio learns very quick that Agatha is as greedy with this as she is with everything else—as if encouraging Rio's cock to hit the back of her throat is just as pleasurable for her as when Rio has two fingers rubbing against her clit. Anything she <em>can</em> derive pleasure from, she <em>will</em> derive pleasure from. Rio respects that. <em>Likes</em> that.</p><p>And then, a particularly hard thrust—Rio losing power to their brain until they hear Agatha let out a gargled moan. They're about to pull back, to apologize, but just before they pull out of her mouth entirely, heart beating a little faster now, they catch how her hand has drifted down between her own thighs like Rio had <em>meant</em> to do that.</p><p>Her eyes flutter open at Rio's lack of movement, hand stilling between her legs like she can see on Rio's face that something isn't right. Rio has just about enough awareness to believe nothing else could be this right. Agatha's lips are pouty, just around the tip of Rio's cock, and Rio can't help themself, pushes in until they can just barely feel the base of the strap pressing against their clit.</p><p>"Good girl. So pretty," Rio mumbles more to themself than Agatha, but she sags against them anyway at the words, eyes drooping back closed as she gags a little from how deep Rio is. But they don't pull back this time.</p><p>They're not even sure who is in control at this point. Agatha, on her knees for them <em>shouldn't</em> be the one in control, and Rio feels <em>powerful,</em> sure, but this is all what Agatha wanted.</p><p>Rio should really get her to stop touching herself, reassert themself, but they swear they can <em>smell</em> her, how much she wants them, how wet sucking Rio's cock has gotten her.</p><p>They know they've missed their chance though, when Agatha's nose brushes up against them, right hand coming to support herself against Rio's thigh as she chokes through her own orgasm.</p><p>She looks far too pleased with herself when she pulls back, spit on her chin and her throat.</p><p>"You just can't help yourself, can you?" Rio swipes their thumb across her lip, wets it in Agatha's spit and pushes it inside her mouth. She blinks up at Rio like she couldn't possibly know what they mean.</p><p>"I'm just getting you ready," Agatha complains, brings her other hand to Rio's hip in what seems to be a soothing kind of motion, but she just smears her own come on their skin, and that doesn't help at all, "You weren't planning on going in dry, were you?"</p><p>Rio's body heats up with how easily Agatha can bait them, <em>"No—"</em> They splutter, pull Agatha to her feet and watch how even biting her lip can't hold back her smile, her eyes twinkling along, "You <em>know</em> I have lube."</p><p>Agatha lets out something close to a <em>giggle,</em> but before Rio can even think to make fun of her for it, she licks along their jaw and ends it in a bite to their earlobe. She's a little harder to tame untied. A <em>lot</em> harder.</p><p>But then she breathes in—shakier than before and not, Rio thinks, because she's trying to recover her breath. She maintains her sly grin but uncertainty creeps onto her face as she says, through gritted teeth like the words themselves are forcing their way out of her mouth, unbidden, "I've never done this before."</p><p>Rio wets their lips, takes a moment to figure out how to respond because they <em>know</em> Agatha has never done this, if they're to fill in the gaps from when they used a plug on her that one time and she'd never done that with another person either.</p><p>She's nervous, Rio realizes, heart clenching.</p><p>"I know, sweetheart," Rio can't help but slip into it, can't bring themself to stop calling Agatha these things—not when it makes her relax into their hands like hearing them is the only thing she's ever going to need, "We'll take things nice and slow, like we always do with something new."</p><p>The forced smile drops from Agatha's face as she softens and nods, just needed to know Rio would take care of her. And they always, <em>always</em> would. Then, like she's nervous about that as well—Rio seeing and understanding how she really feels, Agatha wraps a hand around Rio's cock, still slick with her spit, and pulls them to the bed.</p><p>"Not <em>too</em> slow, I hope," She lets go of them to lie herself back on the sheets, "I want you to fucking <em>ruin</em> me, Rio."</p><p>Rio gets their hands on her hips, grips tight and enjoys the gasping breath Agatha probably pretends didn't let slip from her lips, "Turn over for me," They say, ignoring her attempt at riling them up for now, "I want to see you."</p><p>Agatha's need and her greed must greatly outweigh any anxiety she has about the whole thing because she rolls over with barely a second to <em>think</em> about what Rio has asked of her, arches her back for them and fists her hands into the sheets in front of her.</p><p><em>Perfect,</em> they think, might say aloud if the shiver that runs down Agatha's spine is any indication. They shake their head. Stupid.</p><p>"You don't think I can fuck you <em>nice,</em> and <em>deep,</em> and <em>slow,"</em> Rio starts, brings their fingers to Agatha's inner thigh, drags them up through the wetness she's left there, up to her cunt, doesn't waste time before pushing two inside her, "And ruin you at the same time?"</p><p>Agatha gasps their name and clenches around their fingers and that's all the confirmation Rio really needs, leans over her back with a smirk they brush against her skin.</p><p>Agatha doesn't seem to remember how to form any other words, stutters out their name again when they curl their fingers and then start up what they know to be a torturously slow pace.</p><p>As much as Rio likes possessing the ability to render Agatha speechless, they reach between her legs with their other hand to pinch her clit, "I asked you a question."</p><p><em>"I—"</em> Agatha sort of squeaks, trembling under Rio's touch already.</p><p>"Is that too difficult, baby?" Rio says, stretches Agatha with another finger, "Should I ask a different question?"</p><p><em>("I like the dirty talk," Agatha says in the aftermath. She's sitting on the edge of the bath and hugging a knee to her chest as Rio fills the tub. She didn't want to be alone, she'd said. "I was surprised at first."</em></p><p><em>Rio, who sometimes cringes when suddenly, as they're driving, or trying to fall asleep, or talking to a customer, they remember all the embarrassing things they'd said to Agatha in the heat of the moment, feels the anxiety over it lessen in their chest, even as they flush hot.</em></p><p><em>"Surprised how much you like it?" They start, eyes flicker over to Agatha and then quickly back to the tub. It's silly to be embarrassed, really, when not even an hour ago they had Agatha on her back, bent nearly in half as they pushed her over into her fifth orgasm of the night, "Or surprised that it's me saying those things?"</em></p><p><em>"It's cute how you can barely talk about it now when you literally came when I called myself a slut for you just before," Rio does </em>not<em> meet Agatha's eyes when she shifts along the edge of the bath and closer to them, "Which </em>you<em> encouraged, by the way."</em></p><p><em>"W-well—"</em></p><p><em>"Both, Rio," She leans in and bites their side—right next to a fading hickey. Agatha is a biter, Rio is learning, "Makes me feel fucking filthy hearing you say what you're gonna do to me, the way you make me say it too."</em></p><p><em>Rio opens their mouth to speak, but Agatha gets there first with an accompanying eye roll, </em>"Yes, <em>in a good way."</em></p><p><em>When Agatha had first brought up her degradation kink, Rio's first and only thought definitely hadn't been with the dynamic of it </em>this<em> way round.</em></p><p><em>"Oh," Rio says, just to have something to respond with as they turn the taps off.</em></p><p><em>Agatha pushes them out of the way as soon as she hears the water stop running, only held back by Rio's fingers quickly wrapping around her ankle so they can check the temperature first. She doesn't say anything more until she's got Rio settled in behind her and she's wiggled against their front a few times to find the comfiest position.</em></p><p><em>"Stop overthinking it," Agatha says, reaches up and wraps a wet hand around the back of Rio's neck to bring their face next to hers, smushes them together. She flutters her eyelashes and Rio shivers when they feel it against their cheek, "I'm kinda worryingly into you being a bit of a dick to me."</em></p><p><em>Well then.)</em></p><p>"Would you like my fingers somewhere else, baby?"</p><p>Agatha's resulting moan is loud even with her face pressed down in the bed, and Rio can't help but tease her, pulls their fingers out until just the tips are inside her. She lets out a mournful sort of sound as she rocks back to greedily take Rio's fingers in deeper again. Rio doesn't think there's much harm in letting her today.</p><p>"So desperate for it and this isn't even how you want to be fucked."</p><p>Agatha shifts her face to cast what is maybe meant to be a glare over her shoulder, but with her eyes glassy and a little unfocused it mostly just comes off as a sort of plea.</p><p>Even if Agatha doesn't want them in the same way, it's an ego filled, potent rush to know Agatha has asked, <em>is</em> asking currently with teary eyes alone, for them to take her in a way no one else ever has before; has never trusted anyone but Rio with her body like this.</p><p>Though Agatha would probably never admit to it, she starts getting a little predictable when she's desperate, and it won't be long, Rio thinks, before she <em>begs</em> for them with words, spreads herself open for them. They like knowing this about her, feel the swell of pride knowing she <em>wants</em> them this much.</p><p><em>"Rio, please."</em></p><p>"Come on," Rio stays motionless as Agatha fucks herself back on their fingers, "Tell me."</p><p>Agatha takes in a gulp of air, drowning under Rio's words—very much obvious now that the control has fallen back into Rio's hand. Her voice shakes, "Need you to fuck me."</p><p>"I <em>am</em> fucking you." Rio sort of has to hold back a laugh at the almost roar of frustration Agatha lets out into the sheets.</p><p>She flails a hand back to grab at Rio, doesn't quite get the angle she wants and shoves her hand between her thighs instead, and, in the most shocking move of the night so far, wraps her fingers around Rio's wrist to slowly pull their fingers out.</p><p><em>"Rio, I can't—."</em> She says in a quiet voice and they can't help but take pity on her.</p><p>"It's alright, angel," They notice the way Agatha relaxes at the sound of the lube being opened, "I've got you."</p><p>They've done this once before but even still, Rio feels their heart start to pound in their chest when they press a lubed finger to Agatha's ass. They think giving her a little might be all the encouragement she needs to let go of the last of her anxieties over this.</p><p>"Can you do me a favor?" Rio says, spare hand resting on Agatha's back as they work their finger in just the tiniest bit, only to pull back again to see their vision out in full.</p><p>"I'm a <em>little</em> preoccupied," Agatha's voice sounds rough—a testament to just how much she wants this because Rio hasn't exactly done a lot. She must want it so badly that she realizes how she sounds because then she clears her throat before Rio can say anything more, and says, "I can try. For you."</p><p>Rio can only be glad Agatha isn't looking at them because an embarrassing shiver zips down their spine. "Can you spread yourself for me?" They say before they can think any more of it.</p><p>It's like she'd only been waiting for Rio to ask, like she'd wanted it this whole time but didn't want Rio to know how eager she is. Which is a little silly when Agatha's body visibly craves pleasure every time they're together.</p><p>Rio has never come untouched before, but gets worryingly woozy when Agatha spreads herself open for them, when they have unfiltered access to how ready she looks. They have to steady themself with a hand on Agatha's back when they see her clenching in anticipation because <em>whoa.</em></p><p>When they stop being such a fucking loser, their vision no longer clouded, they lube up their fingers again—can never be too careful—and press back into Agatha's ass. They work slow, noting the way Agatha calms at finally being given what she wants, only adding a second finger when they see her grow a little restless again. Rio's chest heaves when they feel how tight she is around them.</p><p>Somehow, the wet sounds of Rio fucking their fingers into Agatha are a lot dirtier when it's her ass. Perhaps because Agatha is quieter—focused, it seems, on feeling Rio like this. She was quieter the first time too. Maybe the connection from brain to mouth gets nudged loose with just a few fingers up her ass.</p><p><em>"Need it,"</em> Comes Agatha's voice, just when Rio is beginning to think they might never hear it again—and what a tragedy that would be, <em>"I-I—Rio—"</em></p><p>"You ready for it?" They slowly pull their fingers out, listen to Agatha's conflicting whine and reach for the lube again, probably using <em>way</em> too much on their strap but they're not about to hurt Agatha with stupidity and impatience.</p><p><em>"Yes,"</em> Agatha hisses, hands rearranging her grip on her ass like she's slipping with sweaty palms, like she wants to make sure Rio can <em>see</em> how ready she is, "Need you inside me."</p><p>"In here?" Rio says, teases Agatha with a light press of their hips forward, nudges the tip of their strap against her, "<em>Dirty girl.</em> You'd let me do anything to you."</p><p><em>"Anything,"</em> Agatha gasps out immediately, moans <em>deep,</em> "For you. <em>All</em> for—"</p><p>Her words get cut off when Rio starts to push inside her, watches how she stretches to accommodate, barely taking air into their lungs.</p><p>It takes a couple of minutes of Rio working their hips, watching for the slightest change in Agatha's body, to get most of the length inside of her. Agatha could probably take it quicker, but they're being extra careful with her, and she doesn't ask for more. Rio swallows, mouth tacky when they finally allow themself a <em>proper</em> look at Agatha tightening around them.</p><p>"Feel good, baby?"</p><p>They can hear Agatha's breath hitch before she moans more than says, <em>"Good,</em> feels good," And then, just in case Rio didn't get it, she pushes back onto them just a little bit—just enough that she takes the last inch, gets Rio's hips pressed against her ass, whines like she hadn't been expecting <em>more,</em> and says, <em>"Green,</em> I'm so fucking green, baby."</p><p>So Rio pulls out—slow so Agatha can get used to it, doesn't want to hurt her, watches for any sign that she's uncomfortable. And when their hips meet Agatha's ass again—their only buffer Agatha's own hands still set on spreading herself open, they give her another moment, hand coming down to rest on her spine—a comfort, they hope.</p><p>"Agatha?" She's just so unusually quiet that Rio <em>has</em> to know she's okay, that she's still green, needs to remind Agatha that they're here and she can change her mind if—</p><p><em>"I thought,</em>" Agatha's voice comes out strained and Rio can hear her wetting her mouth to try again, "I thought I told you to ruin me."</p><p>Rio doesn't want to hold back from giving her what she so clearly wants anymore, pulls back before moving their hands to Agatha's hips for a better grip for when they push back in, add a snap to their hips that seems to dislodge Agatha from her concentration entirely, and Rio gets to watch in real time, how she sinks down into <em>feeling</em> alone rather than thinking or worrying about her reactions to it.</p><p>It doesn't take long then for Agatha's hands to slip away from the hold she had, has to reach out for the sheets in front of her once more with the faster pace Rio sets.</p><p><em>Fuck,</em> Rio swears they can almost <em>feel</em> Agatha around them, can feel how fucking tight she is, struggles to keep that out of their head; doesn't want to do something as embarrassing as <em>coming</em> just a few minutes into this. This is for Agatha, it's all for Agatha—they're just along for the ride.</p><p>And, <em>god,</em> now they're thinking about that, they quite literally have to shake the thought of it from their mind—Agatha riding them like they had that time they fucked her with the plug in, but this time buried deep in her ass. Maybe the angle would be good for them to fit a few fingers inside her cunt too. <em>Fuck, fuck, fuck,</em> it <em>really</em> isn't the time.</p><p>It's Agatha that breaks them out of their thoughts with a guttural moan, punctuated by Rio's now harsher thrusts—lost entirely to pleasure now. Rio bends over her back a little and their lips twitch up, pleased, "There's my good girl," Agatha's responding moan sticks to them—greek fire that Rio was made to burn in. They can see her knuckles whitening from her grip, can see the tear that leaks from her eye and tracks over the bridge of her nose, "That's it, let me hear you, sweetheart."</p><p>Agatha takes their words to heart, the last pin of restraint finally pulled, <em>"Rio—"</em> She gasps, mouthing at her own arm like she needs something there, <em>"Feels so good, Rio."</em></p><p>"Yeah?" Rio leans further over her, one hand taking their weight while the other jerkily moves to Agatha's face, thumb brushing over her lips and smiling when she doesn't even think about taking it into her mouth, "As good as you thought?"</p><p><em>"Yeah—"</em> Agatha agrees, tip of Rio's thumb still between soft lips, "Love how you fuck me."</p><p>"How many times have you thought about me taking you like this?" Rio grins when Agatha just gets louder, "You love teasing me about it, don't you? But I see you, Agatha," Their thrusts slow a little—mostly to get their words out, but Agatha doesn't need to know that, "I bet you go home and think about it every time you bring it up, just fucking <em>desperate</em> for me to fuck your ass the way you've been wanting."</p><p><em>"Rio—"</em></p><p>"Go ahead," Rio pulls their thumb from Agatha's lips, slides their hand down over her tits, her belly, gives a little self indulgent tug to her bush, just to hear her whimper, "Tell me you don't love being stretched out around my cock." And then they press their fingers to her clit—any sort of response dying on Agatha's tongue as she near sobs.</p><p>Agatha doesn't end up getting any words out—not that Rio really minds when she's louder than she ever has been before. And Agatha doesn't hold herself back. She doesn't get embarrassed at vocalizing her pleasure the way Rio does, <em>definitely</em> doesn't care about Rio's neighbors, but this is different; it sounds like a <em>relief.</em></p><p>"Fuck, baby," Rio gasps when Agatha just about screams through her orgasm. They've never heard that sound leave her before and <em>god,</em> they want to hear it again, "That's it, you just take it, sweetheart."</p><p>Like her orgasm broke the seal over her mind, Agatha <em>stays</em> just as loud as Rio builds her up to another, mutters about how good she sounds, how pretty she looks, how they can't wait to fuck her with a bigger strap, stretch her out the way she likes.</p><p>And it's not that Rio <em>wants</em> to keep her quiet but there's an itch in their brain when they hear themself say, "Do I need to fucking gag you?"</p><p>Agatha moans something that vaguely sounds like an agreement<em>,</em> and then, just in case they didn't get it, commits herself to using her vocal chords the way they were intended, and <em>shit,</em> she sounds so fucking wrecked, <em>"Please—please, do it, please, Rio, god, fuck—"</em></p><p>Rio swallows hard. They don't own a gag, hadn't even thought about it before in a way that was appealing. The appeal, they think, is whatever Agatha wants to try, whatever she thinks she might like. The thought that they might be able to tap into her brain, share thoughts for a moment and see Agatha how she's picturing herself in this moment—bent over and fucking <em>drooling</em> around the gag in her mouth as Rio fucks her ass.</p><p>Yeah, maybe they get it now.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Hours later, Agatha is wrapped in a huge fluffy blanket, laying on her side in the middle of Rio's bed, fully cocooned except for the arm sticking out through a tiny gap so she can scroll on Rio's laptop.</p><p>They like to be <em>certain</em> Agatha is okay to be without them while they clean everything, won't even think about leaving if Agatha can't take her eyes off them, her hands off them. <em>Makes her feel grounded,</em> she'd said.</p><p>It's Rio's laptop that has her full attention now, after being properly spoiled. If this were the other way around, and Agatha had got on the bed behind them, spooned them, and peered over at their screen, Rio would have slammed the laptop closed and not spoken to Agatha for about a week out of sheer embarrassment.</p><p>Since it's <em>this</em> way round, when Rio peers over Agatha's body to see her shopping with two tabs open, side by side—the left side showing a page full of ball gags, and the other side, a paddle that takes them a second to work out says <em>slut,</em> they simply feel their body set itself on fire and choke on their own tongue instead.</p><p>"Subtle," Agatha says, doesn't even bother shifting to look at Rio, "What do you think?"</p><p>"Um—" Is the only thing that manages to leave Rio's mouth.</p><p>"After you were <em>so</em> vocal earlier too." They can hear the amusement in Agatha's voice.</p><p>Rio reaches over to vaguely point to the left side of the screen, "You, um, you want that?"</p><p>"It wasn't obvious when I came pretty much right after you made me think about it?" She casts a glance behind her, leaves Rio blinking at her like a deer in headlights.</p><p>"And the um—other thing," Rio can feel themself blushing, only blushes harder when Agatha's eyes dart to their cheeks and she grins, "I think I might have to hit you pretty hard with that to make it show."</p><p>Agatha's eyes snap back to Rio's and she runs her tongue over her bottom lip, eyes a little unfocused like she's thinking about it, "I'm not hearing any negatives," She says and promptly adds both items to the basket.</p><p>This woman is going to be the death of them.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio hasn't seen Agatha in nearly a week. It's the longest they've gone without seeing each other since they started having sex, and they're honestly starting to get a little worried. Rio has a hard time remembering <em>any</em> time they went a week without seeing each other. They've always been teased for being attached at the hip.</p><p>They've let Agatha set the pace with this whole thing, thinking maybe she'd need the night to get over the embarrassment that Rio isn't used to seeing from her, but that was plainly written across every line of her body. But Agatha didn't text them that night, and not the next morning. She sent them a picture of a dog when she was out getting coffee on the second morning, but there's been nothing about wanting to <em>see</em> Rio again.</p><p>Rio is used to Agatha dropping pre-discussed kinks at random when they fuck. After she found out they were interested in being choked, she didn't wait too long to wrap her fingers loose around their throat and ask for their color—a first, small dip into Agatha taking control for the first time. She'd asked about the likelihood of them having a praise kink <em>('I've always thought you might enjoy being told you're doing a good job')</em> before she got them down on their knees and said, <em>"Make me come like a good boy, Rio,"</em> and so they <em>were</em> a little shocked when Agatha dropped her breeding kink out of nowhere.</p><p>It's not something they'd ever thought about, not a kink they really knew much about, but that's not to say Rio isn't interested. The way their brain turned off, instinct taking over to press their hips firm against Agatha's, hand still fisted in her hair, Agatha's begging sending them hurtling into an orgasm that had hardly had time to build.</p><p>But then, after they were done, and Rio was about to maneuver them both onto the sofa, massage the feeling back into Agatha's body, get rid of the tightness in her hips, her back from being bent over the arm of the sofa for so long, was about to tell her, giddy and flushed that she's unlocked something in them, Agatha pulled away. She could barely even look Rio in the eye, shied away from their touch like she never had before.</p><p><em>("Did I do something wrong?"</em></p><p><em>"I shouldn't have said that."</em></p><p><em>"Said—"</em></p><p><em>"I should go.")</em></p><p>The memory of it keeps twisting further and further up in Rio's stomach and there's really only one explanation for it. They've tried to make it make sense with countless reasons, but the way Agatha couldn't even look at them, couldn't play it off with a laugh, <em>"I don't want you to get me pregnant or anything, but it's hot, right?"</em></p><p>Agatha wasn't thinking about Rio when she asked. She went somewhere deep in her mind where the person fucking her wasn't Rio, only aided by the fact that she was getting fucked from behind, couldn't see them.</p><p>They just thought they'd have a little longer than a month of this, thought she wouldn't grow tired of them this quickly and look elsewhere. Any time they're tempted to try and work out who it might be, they have to distract themself. Agatha is allowed to break things off at any time, is <em>allowed</em> to have sex with someone else tomorrow if she wanted, and Rio shouldn't feel like this is a betrayal just because Agatha is the only one doing <em>friends with benefits</em> properly.</p><p>This whole thing is just dredging up how in love Rio is again, and they've done so well to keep that restrained, to separate their attraction to Agatha from their feelings.</p><p>Because if they've learned anything from Agatha's unwillingness to hold back, her openness about sex—so different from how Rio has always been, her lack of shame about <em>wanting</em> Rio, it's that they're <em>allowed</em> to be attracted to Agatha.</p><p>If Agatha—and this is a real possibility—wants to keep having sex with Rio, then they want her to feel like she can fantasize about other things, other people, even if it hurts a little, just to make it better for her. It's not her fault Rio fell in love with her.</p><p>But if Agatha doesn't want them anymore in any regard, then that's okay—they'll learn to be okay with th—</p><p>"Large veg pizza, no mushrooms, for Rio?"</p><p>Rio blinks back into consciousness at the sound of their name. Had forgotten they were having this realization in Agatha's favorite pizza place. Their body takes a moment too long to catch up and they drop their money all over the fucking floor like an idiot.</p><p>"Just, uh—" Rio stumbles and almost drops the pizza too and then just backs away to the door, eyes fixed resolutely to the floor, "Keep the change."</p><p>Agatha might have to get it delivered from now on.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio replays the night over and over in their mind, staring up at the ceiling and breathing in time with Agatha's almost snores.</p><p><em>"You don't have to look at me if you wanna picture someone else."</em></p><p>They needed her to know it was okay, but then—</p><p><em>"I don't,"</em> Agatha had said, voice small but sure, <em>"I don't wanna picture someone else."</em></p><p>Rio had come over tonight half expecting to have Agatha tell them it isn't working anymore; the other half thinking they might have sex again—Agatha reminding them of what they're supposed to be, that this is just a physical relationship alone, and that anything she feels for them is platonic, but—</p><p>Oh.</p><p><em>Oh.</em></p><p>Maybe Agatha <em>isn't</em> going to break things off with them.</p><p>Before they can think too hard about it, Agatha rolls over with a whimper, eyebrows creased and a small frown on her face, reaches for Rio.</p><p>They take her cold hand in theirs, bring it up to their lips to brush a kiss to her fingers before letting their joined hands rest on top of their stomach, pulling the covers further up with their other hand.</p><p>Agatha's face smooths out, peaceful, and Rio feels their chest settle just seeing her. They fall asleep within minutes.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>It takes Rio another month to realize Agatha is in love with them.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>It's maybe a good thing Rio's instinct generally isn't to react with violence to the unknown. Much more likely for their body to shut down, to get away and hide, and then, if needed, respond with <em>carefully planned</em> violence later on.</p><p>(Eg. <em>The Case of Ralph Bohner's Broken Nose</em> in 2012.)</p><p>When an arm is looped through their own on their way to grab their morning coffee—a treat for it being Saturday, they honestly nearly make a run for it before they look and see Jen's face smiling back at them.</p><p>"What the fuck?" Rio splutters, shoves their headphones down around their neck.</p><p>"I've been calling your name."</p><p>"I—" Rio doesn't know what to say, just gestures to their headphones, heart still fucking <em>pounding.</em></p><p>Jen doesn't seem to care that she was almost the reason for Rio not making it past twenty nine, "I thought we could spend the morning together."</p><p>"Um," Rio hesitates but lets Jen keep her arm linked in theirs, "Why?"</p><p>"Just wanted to hang out!" Jen says, scarily smiley, "Is that a crime?"</p><p>It might be, the way Jen does it.</p><p><em>"No,"</em> Rio says, though even <em>they</em> can hear the uncertainty in their voice, leads Jen to the door of their regular coffee shop anyway, "Just—we don't hang out that much. Alone."</p><p>Rio doesn't even need a single hand to count how many times. They're friends with Jen, sure. They see her all the time, she surprisingly gets their weird sense of humor, but that's when they're all in a group. They're not the type of friends who go out by themselves.</p><p>"Well, maybe I wanted to change that," Jen shrugs and finally unlinks their arms to find a table, "Be a dear and order me a latte?"</p><p>They just nod. That was fucking weird.</p><p>It's like everything in the universe is working against them because <em>why</em> is the line so short on a Saturday? It's never like this.</p><p>They half think Jen's paid off the regulars.</p><p>There's a beat of awkward silence when Rio sits back down, Jen's face pulled tight into a smile like it's killing her to keep it there.</p><p>"So what's this really about?"</p><p>Rio watches as Jen's face drops into something resembling her normal one, "Listen, I—"</p><p>Jen isn't a hesitant person, but she cringes when Rio squeaks out, "What?"</p><p>She sighs, "What's going on with you and Agatha?"</p><p>That's all it takes for Rio's heart to drop into the pit of their stomach, "Right," They swallow and try to act normal, "Why do you think something's going on?"</p><p><em>"Is</em> there?" The look on Jen's face tells them not to bother lying.</p><p>Rio's mouth opens and closes, though no words come out. Like a fish. How <em>Jen</em> knows they're having sex, they have no idea.</p><p>"Agatha was being weird when I saw her too," Jen says, taps her nails against her latte glass. And just when Rio thinks she's about to tell them they need to stop, that it's going to ruin their friendship and take them all with it, she says, "Did you tell her?"</p><p>Rio's brain stutters, "Tell her what?"</p><p>Jen is good enough to cast a glance around like she's worried Agatha might materialize at the table next to them, "That you're <em>painfully,</em> obviously in love with her."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>She really could've left the '<em>painful'</em> part out.</p><p>Jen blinks when they don't give her any more than that, hands flailing a little like she might be able to grasp Rio's unspoken words from the air, "What did she say?"</p><p>"Jen, I," Rio pictures it for a moment, really, <em>really</em> ruining their friendship, "I didn't tell her."</p><p>They don't bother asking how she knows. They don't bother trying to lie about it.</p><p>It's Jen's turn to say, "Oh."</p><p>Rio tries to keep their face neutral, their voice casual, "There's nothing going on. You must've just caught her at a bad time."</p><p>"Is there ever a <em>good</em> time to catch Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha is rarely in a bad mood when Rio sees her. Best friend privileges, they suppose. Rio just shrugs.</p><p>Jen scoffs like this makes sense, and she says, more to herself than to Rio, "Yeah, of course she's different with you."</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p><p>Jen squints at them, lips pursing like she's considering her options—just for a moment, but then it passes.</p><p>Rio wonders how long Jen's known Agatha is in love with them.</p><p>Longer than a day, that's for sure. And now they <em>really</em> feel stupid for not seeing it before. Especially because Agatha has sort of been open and honest about it from the very beginning, has told Rio to their face that she loves them, had chosen to do that after sex.</p><p>"Are you <em>going</em> to tell her?" Jen huffs like Rio's wasting her time, "Because it's her birthday this week and she's aging like fine wine even though she <em>refuses</em> to use any of the skincare I keep recommending her—do <em>not</em> tell her I said that."</p><p>Rio can only laugh, "No."</p><p><em>"No?"</em> Jen splutters, looks at Rio like they're insane, "Rio, she's not gonna be single forever, I mean, if you can get past the personality—"</p><p>"Yes, she is," Rio's smile twitches when they're forced to remember the second, more devastating truth—that even though Agatha is in love with them, "Agatha doesn't date."</p><p>Jen slumps back in her chair like this conversation is shaving years off her life, "She doesn't date people who aren't <em>you."</em></p><p>But if Agatha wanted them, they've been right here for her this whole time, asking her on dates she didn't want to go on, asking her to be exclusive only to find out that doesn't mean the same thing to Agatha as it does to them.</p><p>Agatha may like fucking them, Agatha may be in love with them. But Agatha doesn't want to date them.</p><p>"If I'm so painfully obvious about being in love with her, why doesn't <em>she</em> ask <em>me</em> out?"</p><p>"You're the butch, that's your job." Jen's face says this should be obvious. <em>Duh.</em> "And anyway, it's obvious to <em>us,"</em> Rio doesn't like the implication that the rest of their friends sit around gossiping about their love life, "But I think Agatha's fucking clueless."</p><p>Rio's coffee is mostly cold, but they drink it anyway to buy themself more time.</p><p>"I think you should tell her," Jen says, and she reaches across the table to rest a hand on top of Rio's to get her point across. Rio only feels a little weird about it. "You <em>need</em> to tell her."</p><p>Part of Rio—at least eighty percent of them—sort of wants to shove the idea far away and never touch it again. The other part is sort of convinced Jen is right.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Sex with Agatha isn't usually gentle.</p><p>Rio had thought, the night before her birthday, this would be no different—that she'd be demanding, controlling, would push herself to take as many orgasms as her body could handle as some sort of gift to herself.</p><p>But for Rio, who had built themself up all night to confess to Agatha, they don't mind too much, glad that Agatha is in her right mind, doesn't want her answer to be influenced by her floaty subspace that makes her a little more pliable than usual.</p><p>Rio wonders how long Agatha has been in love with them for, if it's always been as noticeable as it is now.</p><p>"You <em>do</em> make me laugh," She's saying, hands wrapped around Rio's neck and holding them close, strap deep inside her, "You make me happy."</p><p>Rio's eyes flutter closed as they try to steady their breathing. They sort of wonder if maybe Agatha hopes they can make her happy for the rest of her life. They say, voice quiet, trying to step softly into a confession, "I don't know what I'd do without you."</p><p>They feel sick with nerves, worried that they might have gotten this all wrong, and they didn't picture doing this while inside her, but there's something about the intimacy of it all, just them holding each other as close as possible that has them gasping for her attention.</p><p>"Rio," Agatha only lifts her chin from Rio's shoulder to push herself up, sinks back down onto them like she hadn't realized they weren't simply moaning her name, <em>"Please."</em></p><p>"Agatha, I need to tell—"</p><p>Agatha's hand slaps over their mouth, eyes wide like Rio is fucking crazy, and the confession dies inside their mouth.</p><p>Rio has made a lot of embarrassing mistakes in their life, but they don't have many regrets. This is one of them.</p><p>"Please don't ruin this," She's begging with words and wide eyes, hand sliding from Rio's mouth to cup their face—a move that makes Rio want to sob, "Not now."</p><p>They do their best to shake the feeling away, hardening against their feelings. None of this is Agatha's fault, and for as much as she'd like to deny it, Agatha is always careful with them. Like one is with a baby bird. Trying to stop them from getting hurt.</p><p>"What do you want?" They ask, throat thick with unshed tears.</p><p>"I don't want to remember my own name by the time you're done with me."</p><p>And Rio has always liked Agatha's honesty, but just this once, selfishly, they wish she'd just lie and say, <em>"You. I just want you."</em></p>
