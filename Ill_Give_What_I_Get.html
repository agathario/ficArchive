<p>Rio was done. Finished. Over it.</p><p>She didn’t give a fuck if Agatha texted her back.

She shouldn’t have been at the game in the first place.</p><p>Rio stared at the medical-grade brace strapped to her leg with a severe amount of irritation.

_____________</p><p>
<i>Six Weeks Prior</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio jostled Jen as she walked past, the adrenaline rushing through her from their coach’s well-crafted speech.</i>
</p><p>
<i>USC was one of their biggest rivals. Both due to standings and because of its physical proximity to UCLA.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Coach Carter, a UCLA legend and a brilliant strategist, had hated USC since her own time as a Bruin. She always had her best words saved for the times the two teams would meet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was in her third year of college and her third year on UCLAs varsity soccer team. They were 1:1 with USC the past two years and she was dead set on unbalancing the scales.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen grinned up at her as she pulled up her socks, her goalie gloves— worn to shit, logo unrecognizable— were sitting next to her on the bench.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Ready to torch that weak-ass defense?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio rolled her shoulders and bounced on her toes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You fucking know it. Are you ready for the onslaught that’s about to come your way?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen flexed her fingers and offered a sharp smile.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If Harkness wants to dance, we’ll dance. I’ll put her, and that new transfer, Maximoff, in the dirt.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio slapped Jen’s shoulder and collected the rest of her gear as Alice sidled up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice had her headphones at full volume as she approached, pausing for a moment to drop them to her shoulders and blow out a breath.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Be careful of that new center mid. She’s a far better field controller than their previous. Her and Harkness have been ripping teams to shreds, their shitty defense be damned.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen waved a hand around her ear.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“How did you hear us over your god awful music?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice frowned, already gripping the headphones to pull them back in place.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I didn’t.”<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio fell. Hard. A poorly placed knee drove into her solar plexus and she gasped for air as she landed on a body. Particularly, the body of USC’s fucking star forward, Harkness.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha groaned, her hands pushing and pressing at Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Get the fuck off, Vidal.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tried to draw in breath as she blindly pushed herself up, her vision swimming before she was able to draw in a breath. She heaved, being less than careful as she launched herself from Agatha. If she offered a slight shove to her opponent’s body as she freed herself, only Harkness would know.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sprinted forward to provide an option, her eyes on the ball at Romanoff’s feet. She hadn’t caught her breath, hadn’t fully recovered, but USC was out of position and they had a chance to go up a goal within the first ten minutes of the game.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice flew up the outside left, receiving the ball and delivering it back inside to Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was good. No, she was fantastic. She was deeply observant, her head on a swivel to ensure she knew exactly where her team and her opponents were or planned to be.</i>
</p><p>
<i>With ease, she deposited the ball on target, several feet ahead of Danvers who was flying up the right side of the field.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Romanoff caught her eye as she moved away from the opponents box, drawing one of USC’s center backs out of position as Rio sprinted forward to replace her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The pass came through, Danvers teeing off a perfect leading cross that Rio flung herself toward. The goalie, a fucking unit named Walters, collided with her, but Rio’s head still connected with the ball and it careened into the back of the net.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio hit the grass hard as her teammates swarmed and hands grasped and pulled her to her feet. She grinned as she fixed her shinguards and wiped the mud off of her knees and elbows, jogging back toward the center.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She felt eyes on her and flashed a smug smirk at Harkness as she repositioned herself for the kickoff.<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>The next goal to land was from the feet of Harkness on the right wing. An irritatingly perfect series of passes between USC’s three midfielders drew UCLA out of position, and a well-timed, precise pass from Maximoff to Harkness up the sideline had Alice scrambling to get into position.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio knew before Harkness’ first touch that she would score.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Every single meeting with Harkness had given Rio a deeper understanding of the woman. Agatha had a look she got, a glint of victory that appeared when she expected to score, when the pieces lined up just right to get the ball in the back of the net.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio saw Harkness carve through Alice’s attempt to intercept as she drove in toward Rambeau.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Harkness was fast and lethal, her ball skills nearly unmatched amongst the NCAA teams, and she narrowly swam the ball around a deadly slam from Rambeau, only stumbling slightly as she wound up her shot.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It slammed into the top left corner, the precision and speed leaving Jen no time to even attempt to dive.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha threw up her hands, her grin wide and pleased as the stadium cheered for the home team.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She winked at Rio as they met once more at center field.<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>At half, Carter tapped her dry erase marker on the white board between the magnets that represented the attacking midfield.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, great vision, great handling. Watch yourself with Harkness. I don’t need any cards to keep you out of next week’s match.” She tapped more aggressively on the left mid, staring down Munroe. “You are box to box! If you can’t make it back to help your defense, tell me and I’ll find somebody who can.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Carter moved the magnets into starting formation.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“They’re not going to move out of their 4-3-3 formation and their forwards are selfish. They don’t always drop into support like they should. We’re not exploiting this enough.” She gave the team a meaningful look. “We have a tactical advantage. If we run our system well, utilize the gaps in front of their defense, and keep the ball moving across the field, we will win this fucking game.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She pointed at the two defending midfielders.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Khan, Jones, give them hell every time they try to cross the offensive line and for my sake, stop holding onto the ball! Get it up to your attacking midfield so we can get something moving.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Carter looked to Alice.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Our only adjustment will be Wu. I no longer want you pressing the attack. Keep your eyes on Harkness and do not let her drive the outside lane. I only want you involved in the attack if Harkness decides to cross into her own defensive territory.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Lastly, she turned her attention to Jen.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Four excellent saves and more to come. Keep your head up, Kale.”<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Disaster struck in the late minutes of the second half. Rio was pressing the opposing center backs, sitting in the soft spot of their defense. She’d become a machine, delivering passes, controlling the pace and direction of the play. UCLAs time of possession was almost double that of USCs and Rio knew she was playing one of the best games of her career.</i>
</p><p>
<i>USCs response had been to apply bodies to Rio, to jostle her, to dislodge her, and rough her up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But she had hit a groove, one that she was not going to be knocked from easily.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was playing a tactical game, moving chess pieces to pin and skewer their opponents as she facilitated the ball’s movement around the field.</i>
</p><p>
<i>In the final third of the second half, Rio passed the ball outside left and drove forward to receive it back on the run. She moved with it, launched it into the open space on the right side of the field, and saw an opening between the staggered opposing midfield.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She lifted a hand for the ball, planning to let slip past her to where Alice was currently careening up the sideline. It should have been a warning. Alice was moving up because Harkness had finally gotten her ass back to help.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was a layup, an easy goal.</i>
</p><p>
<i>As the ball came her way, Rio felt the approach of a central defender in front of her. She feigned an attempt to settle the ball, planting her foot and letting the ball bounce through her legs.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The next several seconds, Rio didn’t remember. She felt a collision, heard a sharp pop, and felt a staggering sear of pain on the inside of her knee.</i>
</p><p><i>She collapsed to the grass and let out an agonized shout as she held her knee with both hands.</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>Rio had watched film of the moment over a dozen times and she knew, as well as anyone else in the sport knew, Agatha hadn’t hurt her on purpose. She’d been going for the ball, or, where the ball would have been had Rio taken the touch instead of planting her foot.</p><p>There had been chaos, Alice scoring on the drive up, and in the flurry of bodies, it had taken a moment for part of her team to recognize she was down.</p><p>Agatha had been the first to her, had looked panicked as she knelt at Rio’s side and called for a medic.</p><p>Rio had believed, or at least started to believe, that Agatha might not be all selfishness. That maybe, just fucking maybe, Agatha cared the smallest amount about the people around her.</p><p>Now, she was not so sure. She tried not to overanalyze the following day, one of the worst days of her young life, and failed as she remembered the way Agatha had floated into her hospital room with a stuffed rabbit, a get well soon card, and an offer that had nearly put Rio into cardiac arrest.<br/>
_____________</p><p>
<i>Five Weeks and Six Days Prior</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was in a state of distress, her eyes closed as she tried to tamp down her swelling emotions. Her entire team had already crowded into her room to offer support and bring the game ball that Romanoff had apparently stolen afterwards.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Carter had kicked everyone out after an hour, prescribing rest for Rio and the rest of the team, and she sat down by the hospital bed. Her expression was warm, her style off the field so drastically different than the full UCLA sweat suit she wore for games. She had on black slacks and a pastel pink sweater, looking more like a model than a coach with two championships under her belt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio put on a brave face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Coach.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Carter smiled and her eyes were so sincere Rio felt her own fill with tears.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio, it’s just 8 weeks.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio scoffed, a flash of frustration burning her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s the season. And the championship.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Carter nodded, not giving weak platitudes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It is. But you’re a Junior, Rio. You will have your final year. Don’t focus on what you’re missing. Attack this rehab like you do training and you won’t even fall behind for summer conditioning.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded, her heart breaking at the reality that the season was truly over.<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice and Jen had gone home at Carter’s order and they were slated to return once Rio had been cleared. They were sending her screenshots of Tweets and clips discussing her gameplay the night before, any mention of her injury sloppily scratched out with orange and pink pen.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was waiting for them now, her leg stuffed in a clunky brace that was locked in position. High grade two MCL tear. She was lucky her ACL had remained intact. Her crutches were leaning within reach and she eyed the aluminum axillary crutches with disdain.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The door to the room slid open and Rio expected a nurse, her doctor, Alice, a kid that had escaped from their parents and gotten lost. What she did not expect was a wild mane of hair and the unfairly gorgeous face of Agatha Harkness, right wing of the USC Trojans.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s stomach dropped, her mouth going dry as she realized she likely looked like absolute shit. Being on the field was one thing. That was her world and she met Agatha as a titan. In her hospital room with greasy hair, dried sweat and dirt on parts of her body, ugly-ass hospital gown draped shapelessly over her body, Rio was nowhere near a titan.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha closed the door behind her quickly and turned with a bag in hand. She didn’t dress like a college senior. She had on a pantsuit that hugged her hips and waist perfectly, the maroon fabric likely leagues outside Rio’s budget for an entire month. The white t-shirt under was starched and bright like the sun hitting the snow, and Rio wanted to spill her nearly finished apple juice all over it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She made sure her tone didn’t waver as she spit out three words.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What the fuck.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled her eyes and she stuffed her hand into her back to retrieve a fully too-large stuffed rabbit. She tossed it at Rio, the soft body hitting her in the chest and chin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Relax, Vidal. I come bearing gifts.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sputtered and pushed the animal away from her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t need gifts. I want my knee to function again. Got that in your bag?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes, so deeply blue and holding far too much confidence, flickered with something uncertain. It was wiped away quickly as she moved to stand over Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Please.” She dislodged a card and handed this one over instead of launching it. “I have an offer for you.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio felt like she was going to get whiplash on top of her damaged MCL. She looked dumbly at the card and back to Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, and here I thought you were coming to apologize for ruining the rest of my season.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>That uncertainty flashed again and Agatha huffed, motioning aggressively toward the card.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s in there. It was an accident!” Agatha stopped herself, breathed, and tried again. “I’m sorry you’re out for the season.” It felt sincere, and then: “But you probably shouldn’t have planted. Why not just run over the ball?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio felt a surge of irritation in her body, her skin growing hot as she looked at Agatha in disbelief.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m sorry, I didn’t expect to get fucking waylaid by a habitually selfish wing that doesn’t usually support her defense.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes narrowed and she glared at Rio for several moments looking like she was biting back something sharp. Finally, she reached back into her bag and cleared her throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Look, I didn’t come to argue.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stared at the manilla envelope that was pulled out of the bag. It was hefty, at least a half-inch thick, and had a law firm stamped on the outside.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s expression slid into perfect professionalism.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I know you’re on a major scholarship here at UCLA, but it’s not a full-ride. And you work weekends to cover the rest.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s cheeks flushed but Agatha didn’t give her time to be embarrassed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m in hot water because of your injury. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t mean to. It looks bad to the public and to the investors at my mother’s company. I graduate this year and I need to be squeaky clean to take on the COO position that’s being vacated for me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s mind couldn’t wrap around everything being revealed, but it did ping on specific detail.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You aren’t going pro?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha snorted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Please.” She pressed the file into Rio’s hands. “Let’s not get caught up in the emotions that’ll come up here. Embarrassment is a waste of time. I know you need a way to pay your rent and a little extra income is always nice, yeah?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was a force of nature; convincing, assured, stupidly attractive. Rio let herself flip the top of the envelope open and she peered inside.</i>
</p><p>
<i>There were stacks of papers, a folder, and a small envelope.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha motioned for her impatiently and Rio poured out the contents into her lap. Agatha picked up the largest stack of papers and held it out.</i>
</p><p>Non-Disclosure Agreement</p><p>
<i>Rio stared at the page dumbly, her mind spinning and settling on absolutely no reason Agatha Harkness, daughter of musician-turned-corrupt-as-fuck-CEO Evanora Harkness, was holding out an NDA.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha lifted her brow like Rio was stupid.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Well? Read it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio huffed and tried to orient herself. She wasn’t sure if it was the meds or Agatha’s presence that was making her nauseous.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No. What the fuck are you doing here besides calling me poor?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha crossed her arms, NDA pressed to her side, and stared Rio down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I need to do my kinesiology capstone project and my advisor gave the okay for me to help you complete your rehab. If you agree, I’ll cover your rent while you finish out college. Plus any medical bills UCLA’s insurance doesn’t cover.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s nausea was definitely caused by Agatha. Her mouth dropped open and she quickly snapped it shut.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s fucking insane!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha reached forward and pulled one of the smaller envelopes. She flicked the top open and pulled out a blank check.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Name your price.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio waited for any kind of caveat and received nothing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I already have a physical therapist.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I will be supplemental. I’ve already outlined the project. You can find it in that folder.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>There was no way that Rio could accept this. There had to be strings. Maybe Agatha was tricking Rio into selling her soul because she was a literal demon. She shook her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Harkness–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha moved closer, her blue eyes piercing, challenging.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t be fucking stupid, Vidal. I’m giving you your weekends back and financial security to finish out your college career. I just need you to make me look good to my mother’s investors.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio threw up a hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I can give a statement! I can, I don’t know, follow you on social media or talk to your mom.” She waved her hand over the documents in her lap. “All of this is too much.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mind seemed to be calculating, her eyes shrewd as she stared past Rio’s head. Then she nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ll pay your full rent. Including your roommates’ shares.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes flashed smugly as if she’d already won.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio wanted nothing more than to wipe it off her face. When she opened her mouth to do so, she thought of Jen’s failed Etsy shop and Alice’s seeming inability to hold a job. Both of them were on partial scholarship and their road thus far hadn’t been easy.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fuck.” Agatha’s smile widened and Rio rolled her eyes. “Jesus, I can’t fucking believe I’m agreeing to this.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha put the NDA back on Rio’s lap.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Great, I’ll contact your landlord once we’re squared away.” She picked up the check. “How much?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was the same question again, giving Rio far more responsibility than she wanted. She stared at Agatha’s slender fingers and politely painted nails.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t need more, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha waved her off.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s a signing bonus. Do you need a new bike? A car? Do you want to take a trip?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stared some more. She didn’t speak until she saw Agatha’s confident eyes flicker to her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t– listen, I don’t want to take away Jen and Alices’ opportunity to have free rent, but you could just… ask. You don’t need to bribe me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha seemed confused by the concept.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“There’s no guarantee in just asking. I’m notoriously difficult to work with and I can’t have you quitting when I piss you off.” She pursed her lips. “Besides, there’s another aspect of this you aren’t considering. I’m a public figure because of my mother. I’ve been in magazines and online newspapers for a multitude of things and there’s no rhyme or reason to when they decide to seek out the daughter of a once Hollywood icon. We have to sell it. You have to follow through.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio wondered if this was how Agatha had all of her conversations: a checkbook in hand and a refusal to accept any answer but the one she wanted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Just cover the rent. I don’t need anything else.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled her eyes and started to fill the check anyway.</i>
</p><p><i>“I hope you’re not majoring in business. You suck at this.” She pressed the check back into the envelope and set it on Rio’s lap. “Make sure you read the contract and NDA in full. Let me know if you have questions. I’ll be in touch.” She stepped back and paused. “Oh, and nobody can know about this, Rio. That means your roommates too.”</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>Rio hissed as she rolled out her quads, then her hamstrings, followed by her adductors. Her muscles were recovering but they were tight and the foam roller felt more like a dagger.</p><p>She finished and walked toward the mirror, a section of it marked for her to track her knees properly as she squatted. Agatha had taped it a few weeks prior when Rio had struggled to keep her form.</p><p>Rio had never told her <i>why</i> she’d been having such a hard time. She likely never would. But the memory was enough to make Rio feel hot.</p><p>She completed her first set and groaned, her chest aching in a deeply unwanted, unpleasant way.</p><p>This could have been so fucking simple. Do PT, let Agatha pretend to help, make Alice and Jens’ lives easier. Move on. That had been the plan.</p><p>But Agatha was… Agatha was something else.</p><p>Rio had signed the NDA and the contract after reading it over six to fifteen times. She didn’t exactly know what she was looking for, but after a thousand google searches, she had decided Agatha wasn’t trying to scam her.</p><p>There were aspects that made her uncomfortable: she didn’t like being locked into something so ironclad. Nor did she enjoy the section on Rio’s image or likeness being captured and possibly used for media purposes. But she hadn’t seen Agatha in the news since her Freshman year, when Agatha had been photographed at a house party drinking from a beer bong with her hands held in the air.</p><p>Rio started her second set of goblet squats, slow and steady, and remembered the bliss of before. Before she knew anything about Agatha. Before she knew how smart she was. How funny. How observant. How soft. Before she knew what Agatha’s mouth felt like on hers. Before she knew how good Agatha sounded when she came around Rio’s fingers.</p><p>Rio felt a sting in her throat and she cleared it roughly, finishing the second set with some lazy effort at staying aligned.</p><p>Before she knew that Agatha had really beautiful dreams. Before she knew that Agatha was flawed and deeply afraid of the future.</p><p>Rio tried to remember how fucking annoying Agatha was. How irritated she was in the first two weeks. How much regret she had in signing away her already frustrating physical therapy time for somebody to watch.<br/>

<i>Five Weeks Prior</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was going to kill her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Give me my crutches, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha didn’t move, her eyes on the clipboard in her hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You still have two more quad sets. And you need to do your straight leg raises.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s skin felt hot. Her lungs burned with agitation as she looked toward the wall where Agatha had moved her crutches.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m done for the day.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s lips curled up, her eyes lifting to meet Rio’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No. You’re not.” She nodded pointedly. “Let’s go. Ten reps. Hold for ten seconds.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio ground her teeth together and held Agatha’s gaze. She was sweaty and embarrassed and fucking pissed off because it was her first day of PT and she hated how much she couldn’t do.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m done.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha leaned closer, her deeply inappropriate athletic top revealing her tits through a low V in the lavender material.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I didn’t take you for a fucking baby, Vidal. Suck it up and finish your exercises.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio glared.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s brows rose and she crossed her arms. The movement drew Rio’s eyes to her chest and she quickly looked away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s stern expression didn’t waver.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Will you do your exercises if I show you my boobs?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio balked, eyes flying wide.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Uh– I–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s face cracked as she began to cackle.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m fucking with you, Vidal.” She stepped closer and repositioned Rio’s leg, her fingers clinical but soft. “You can keep looking if you finish your PT though.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was certain she was beet-red. Her cheeks were on fire and her frustration was now interspersed with embarrassment and curiosity and slight horniness.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m not looking. They’re just… there! In my face.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha feigned shock.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You want them in your face?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio pressed her hands over her eyes, groaning, and fought that imagery out of her mind.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If I do my exercises will you shut the fuck up?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha smiled sweetly and Rio thought she might’ve been right, and Agatha was actually a demon.</i>
</p><p><i>“Of course.”</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>Agatha had never shut the fuck up. She was constantly running her mouth and Rio hated that she enjoyed it so much. Agatha always had something to say and Rio always found herself listening.</p><p>She pulled a box step free from its stack and set it in front of the mirror. Therapy with Agatha hadn’t been terrible in the end. Rio’s worry was the vulnerability she felt being so incapable. To go from the best shape of her life to hobbling around on crutches was… jarringly difficult. It was overwhelming.</p><p>The first time that reared its ugly head was also the first time Agatha proved to be more than an heir to an empire masquerading as a soccer player.<br/>
_____________</p><p>
<i>Four Weeks and Five Days Prior</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was spent. It wasn’t the prickling agitation she felt with Agatha prodding at her as she completed her exercises. It wasn’t even the pain. Not really. It was the helplessness.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio couldn’t do a simple glute bridge without feeling the instability and weakness in her right knee. It was something she knew she was capable of and yet…</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s teeth clacked tightly as she bit back the scream of frustration that bubbled in her chest. She felt tears in her eyes and she hoped that, for once, Agatha would just keep her mouth shut.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was kneeling beside her, eyes on the clipboard like she was actually capable of taking this seriously. She frowned when Rio dropped from the bridge.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Pain?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shrugged.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s frown deepened.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Vidal, does it hurt?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shook her head. She couldn’t risk opening her mouth. If she tried to speak she was going to break down, and she refused to let Agatha see that. She looked at the ceiling, letting the overheads blind her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha waited for more, only speaking when she didn’t receive it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do you need a moment?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio blinked. The understanding in the question was startling and she felt the dam breaking. She could be so strong until somebody was soft with her. Agatha, of all people, seeing her, understanding what she needed, was far too soft. She nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled to her feet and took her clipboard with her without asking any more questions.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio heard the door to the training room close and the tears fell quietly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Because of school and daily practice, the only time they could meet was at night when the gym and training center were empty.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was grateful for it now as she sniffed and wiped the back of her hand over her eyes. Her team had a morning game the next day. The very first game Rio would be missing in her time as a Bruin. She had an excellent record of staying on the field and the thought of being stuck on the sidelines made her sick.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio wiped at her eyes again and drew in several long, slow, deep breaths.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha came back after a few minutes and Rio felt a stirring of affection when Agatha acted like nothing had happened at all.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Was there discomfort when you did the bridge?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded and tapped the brace on the inside.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It felt like my leg was going to buckle.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded as she leaned forward, her fingers settling on the muscles of Rio’s inner-knee.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s normal. It’s only your second day. The trauma to your knee fucked up a lot more than just your knee. Your mind doesn’t trust the joint, your muscles are guarding, tightening up to protect it. For knee trauma, the quadriceps often shutdown and need to be reactivated. You have a lot to manage here and it’s okay to be frustrated.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She didn’t press hard as she began a lymphatic massage around the knee.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stared at the side of Agatha’s face as she took in the words, as they soothed the angry nest of hornets in her chest. She watched so closely that she saw the moment Agatha’s cheeks flushed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Before Rio could make a comment, Agatha’s hands moved to her quad and her fingers dug in.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio yelped, startled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s touch lightened.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sorry, like I said. Your muscles are guarding. They’re tight enough that it can be painful to work through them. Try to keep still.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio did not keep still. Or quiet. It fucking hurt. And not in the good pain kind of way. Instead of pain and pleasure, it felt like pain and being tickled. The nerves were so alert that Rio was jolting and trying to inch away with every press of Agatha’s fingers.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hummed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ve never had a girl trying to get away from my touch before. This is new.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio didn’t process the words until far later into the night when she was nearly asleep. She snapped back because it was all she could do.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Probably because you’re not committing heinous crimes like torture to them.” Rio slapped at Agatha’s hand, hissing through her teeth. “Seriously what the fuck.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed, her touch softening further, but she didn’t stop her movements.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Try to have some dignity, Vidal. I’m barely pressing.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio gaped.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You just jackhammered into my quad, what do you mean?!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s fingers slowed to a stop and she patted Rio’s thigh.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“There. We’ll finish with Hip Abduction on your side and then we’ll ice it.”<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was laying on the tall therapy table with an ice machine beside her, trying her very best not to think too much about Agatha’s hands.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d made Rio put the brace on and crutch to the room just to start loosening the straps the moment that Rio laid down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s nails were blunt but still grazed over Rio’s skin as she undid the velcro. She lifted Rio’s leg out and settled it on the table.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was of two minds. Agatha was incredibly hot. She had the body of a collegiate soccer player, her muscles toned, her thighs and glutes developed and perfectly displayed in her black leggings. Her eyes were a stunning blue, her nose fit her face so well, and her mouth was curved and soft. She was beautiful. Agatha carried herself like somebody who knew this to be true.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But Agatha was also surprisingly… human. Her eyes were expressive despite her efforts. She talked with her hands. She was as intuitive as she was brash. She seemed like a woman that wanted to reach but didn’t know how. Or was too scared of what would come after.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha wrapped the cool pad around Rio’s knee and strapped it into place.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio said the safest words she could.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why Kinesiology if you’re going into your mom’s business? You’re good at this.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shrugged as she picked up the clipboard and stared blankly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I like it. In a different world I–” Agatha shrugged. “It’s something I enjoy knowing about. I want my body to serve me well. To do that, I need to understand it and care for it.”</i>
</p><p><i>Rio could tell she wasn’t meant to press further.</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>Rio lowered herself to the floor and started her single-leg bridges. She felt the pounding of the bass in her chest as she lifted her body.</p><p>She should have left it alone. Should have ignored her curiosity, her interest. Agatha had the attention of everyone in any room she walked into, Rio hadn’t needed to follow suit.</p><p>But she had. Call her weak. Call her a fucking lesbian who loved tits and women who were mean.</p><p>And Agatha was. She had the capability of softness but her mouth was as sharp as it was pretty and Rio was addicted to it. To silencing it. To riding it. To pressing her palm over it to keep Agatha quiet.</p><p>She closed her eyes during her rest between sets and tried to pinpoint when things had changed.<br/>
_____________</p><p>
<i>Three Weeks and Three Days Prior</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was off her crutches and feeling leagues better with just the simple freedom to walk. Agatha had been insufferable about her gait and posture, asking Rio to perform repetitive, boring exercises that wore at her patience.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Their last session had been aggravating. Rio was forced to endure another agonizing quad massage and then Agatha had had her working through a single-leg balance exercise that made her feel inept. She also wouldn’t let her walk without her brace.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had been so irritated she’d gone to the facility specialist, her actual PT overseeing her healing, and had promptly been told that Agatha was right.</i>
</p><p>
<i>So Rio pouted. And she showed up late for their next session.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had looked at her, at the shitty attitude she was bringing in, and had promptly picked up her bag.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Alright. I think we need a break. Drinks?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio mutely followed Agatha to her car, a sleek, brand new white Jaguar F-Pace SVR. The drive to Agatha’s chosen bar knocked Rio out of her shitty mood and into a state of pure adrenaline. Agatha wasn’t a bad driver. Surprisingly. She seemed incredibly comfortable behind the wheel.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But Agatha wasn’t quiet about her displeasure with other drivers. Her commentary ranged from insults spoken under her breath to shouting and a full on slam of her horn as a truck cut her off.</i>
</p><p>
<i>As soon as they parked, Rio slumped into the seat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“How do you hold so much rage in your body?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha huffed and flung her door open. It slammed, and then moments later Rio’s door opened.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stared at her for a beat too long and Agatha snapped her fingers.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Today, Vidal.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stepped out and only then realized she’d been taken to an upscale cocktail bar that she’d driven past but never planned to go to. She grimaced.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What are we? Divorced moms in their forties?” Rio turned back toward the car. “Take me somewhere my arms will stick to the bar.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha ignored her and walked inside, locking the car before Rio could slide back in.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio dropped her head back and groaned loudly as she made her way toward the massive double doors.<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was tipsy. No. Rio was drunk. She felt the alcohol in every limb, in every finger and toe. Her head swam pleasantly as she sipped on the water that she’d ordered as an afterthought with the twenty dollar salad Agatha was paying for.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was sitting beside her, cheeks flushed, lips pulled into a pleased, almost shy smile that Rio could not stop looking at. It was disarming. And cute.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She couldn’t figure out where it was coming from, what Agatha would have to be shy about. She didn’t seem the type. She also didn’t speak like she felt any type of reticence to do so.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shared stories about her time as a musician’s kid, about how they spent so much time on the road for tours that she’d learned to drive the bus at twelve. Just in parking lots, she’d said. She talked about the instruments she’d half-learned how to play before realizing music just wasn’t her thing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She told Rio that she’d found soccer because her mom would take her to the nearest parks and Agatha would watch kids, adults, teens, anyone play. Eventually, her mom had just decided that Agatha would join. She’d pay the coach or sign a t-shirt and Agatha would be thrust into a group of strange kids to play a sport she hadn’t known.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Wasn’t that hard? Kids are mean.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s smile was almost wistful.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I didn’t care. I was having so much fun.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>There was a point in a story, Rio listening with rapt attention, where Agatha paused.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“--telling you, this guy thought he could woo my mom by making her a gigantic blanket with her face on it. He was led away by security. That was also the night–” Rio waited but Agatha changed the subject, her expression falling. “Anyway. What about you? Insane stories in your youth?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio let it go.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She told Agatha about her very boring parents in comparison. About the ways she and the neighborhood kids entertained one another in their cookie cutter culdesac.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We used to take those kid’s cars– not the ones with the motors, the plastic shitty ones with wheels– to the top of the hill and ride down it. We were way too big and we were hanging out the sides, but we did it every weekend until the big accident.” Rio pulled her collar to the side so Agatha could see the scar on the front of her right shoulder. “I leaned out too far and fell halfway down. Nearly wore through every layer of my skin as I slid on the pavement. The toy cars were banned after that.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was fun. Agatha was fun.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They were both fully drunk by the time Agatha asked for the bill. She scribbled her name at the bottom of the receipt, not bothering to look at the total, and slid the receipt back across the bar.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stood and held out her hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stared at it blankly and tried to stand on her own.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha scowled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re drunk.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio rolled her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I have the brace on. I’m not going to collapse walking the twenty feet from here to your car.” She frowned. “Wait, you can’t drive.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stepped closer so that Rio couldn’t stand without practically pressing herself flush against her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No. That’s why I drink at places like this. So I can leave my car and Uber back in the morning.” She held out her hand. “Give me your arm or I’ll drag you to the car instead.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio groaned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agathaaaaa.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s smile broke out, brilliant and wide.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Wow. Who knew Rio Vidal, CM for the UCLA Bruins, was such a baby.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio narrowed her eyes and tried to stand without help. Her chest pressed into Agatha’s and their faces were centimeters apart. Her breath caught in her throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was warm and soft and she felt fucking good.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s only escape was sitting down. Something she would never do even under the threat of death. So she stood there stubbornly, heart pounding in her chest at the proximity, mind urging her to lean just a little bit closer.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Seeing she wouldn’t budge, Agatha’s tactic changed. Her expression softened, her lips pulling down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Do it for me?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was so unexpected, the tone, the words themselves, and Rio was no pushover, but what the actual fuck was one supposed to do when Agatha Harkness looked at them like that?</i>
</p><p><i>She let Agatha take her arm and they walked outside to wait for the Uber.</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>It became a habit after that. Sort of. Agatha was surprisingly serious about keeping Rio’s rehab schedule, and the next week she’d decided that they’d just have to get drinks after Agatha’s game.</p><p>Rio hadn’t questioned it. She should have. But being in Agatha’s orbit was intoxicating and she blamed her stupidity on being a horny college kid.<br/>
_____________</p><p>
<i>Two Weeks and Five Days Prior</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio walked into another new cocktail bar, this one she’d never heard of, and found that Agatha hadn’t gotten dressed up after her game. She had on her black USC sweats and a crimson t-shirt that looked like it was from her Freshman year. Her hair was pulled from her face in a messy bun and her face was freshly washed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She was nursing a beer, some craft shit Rio had no interest in trying, and she smiled tiredly as Rio sat down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Hey.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s brows lifted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You good?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha huffed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We lost.” She frowned at the bartop. “It’s my fault. Fucking sucks.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio ordered a Coors to the displeasure of the bartender and Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I doubt it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha snorted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No. You’re right. It’s our coach. I know everyone says the front three are selfish, but he tells us not to fall back to support the defense.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio frowned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What? That’s like, the only way the 4-3-3 works.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shrugged, polishing off her drink and ordering another.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“He doesn’t see it that way. Defense is an afterthought for him. He wants me, Belova, and Bishop to stay high and wait for the rest of the team to feed us the ball.” She sighed. “It works well enough that he’s not willing to change it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio felt her perspective shifting again. A picture had truly been painted of Agatha. One that didn’t seem remotely accurate.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I mean, good for your opponents’ safety. You hit hard.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled her eyes but her expression turned down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I am sorry. I didn–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio held up a hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No, stop. I know it was an accident, Agatha. I was ribbing you.” She studied the flush in Agatha’s cheeks. “How much have you had to drink?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s cheeks puffed out.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“A few.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio smiled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay. So we’ll have to Uber, but what if we go to Santa Monica and drink somewhere with a better view.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes lit up and she stuffed her hand in her fanny pack to withdraw her keys. She tossed them at Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes! You’re driving.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sputtered, her beer only half-finished and her mind immediately creating new and impressive ways she might accidentally damage Agatha’s luxury car.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Your car is worth more than I’m paying for college!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stood, pushing Rio’s beer away and dropping a one hundred dollar bill on the bar.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“So don’t wreck it.”<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha bought them towels. And swimsuits. That had been an experience.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had followed her shamelessly into the changing room and Rio was too cool to ask her what she was thinking.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They’d changed facing away from one another, neither turning until they’d both found one they liked.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had nearly melted on the spot, her chest fluttering and her lower stomach clenching at the sage green and white striped retro top that proudly supported Agatha’s perky, mouthwatering tits. The bottoms were a darker green and highwaisted, two silver and white decorative flower buttons on each hip. Her tanned stomach was on full display, her muscles apparent through the vague outline that flexed as she moved.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her thighs were… Rio really fucking wanted to slide her hands on Agatha’s thighs.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She stared for long enough that Agatha cleared her throat, her smile smug but her cheeks tinged a soft pink.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s voice was hoarse when she spoke.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s good.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha snorted, her nose wrinkling, and Rio had an alarming desire to kiss her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha motioned to Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s good too.” She nodded at the boyshorts. “Cute.”<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Neither of them realized their blunder until they reached the start of the sand. Rio hesitated as Agatha began to walk, eyeing her brace and feeling a slow sink of worry in her gut.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It didn’t take long for Agatha to catch on. She’d sobered up significantly during their shopping and she walked back to Rio with her mind racing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Shit. Okay, hang on.” Agatha looked around as if a solution might present itself. After a moment, her eyes lit up. “Okay stay right here.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What?!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha was already walking away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Stay!”<br/>
____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio covered her face with her new towel and groaned again as she was rolled along the sand in a beach wheelchair. The massive yellow wheels and bright blue, cloth seat made sure to draw attention as Agatha gleefully pushed them along.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Stop complaining, Rio.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio liked when Agatha said her name.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What if people think we just rented this for fun?! People need these and we should have just left.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha patted Rio’s head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Right. They think we’re here for a joyride with you in that metal brace. Grow up. We’re almost there and then you can get out.”<br/>
____</i>
</p><p>
<i>They were laid out on the beach, the sun still high in the sky, as they nursed the drinks Agatha had purchased when she was renting the wheelchair.</i>
</p><p>
<i>A deck of cards sat between them and they were currently breaking after their fourth game of Rummy.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had won three of four. So it was less of a break, and more that Agatha refused to lose again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was nice. Rio could almost forget that she was otherwise miserable with her life because of her inability to do what she loved most. Then she’d catch sight of a bright yellow tire and her head would fall back against the towel.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hummed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Stop groaning. I’m trying to absorb the sun.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“And my groaning disrupts the rays of light?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yes.”<br/>
____</i>
</p><p>
<i>After two hours, thirty minutes of which Rio fell asleep, Agatha stood and tapped Rio’s good leg.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m hot. I’m going to take a dip.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio pouted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I guess I’ll just catch on fire out here then.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Ten minutes later, Rio deeply regretted her words. The flicker of shadow was the only warning she got before Agatha was dripping cold water all over her skin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio squealed and tried to roll away, but her movement was limited and she suffered through a full minute of torture until Agatha had squeezed as much water as she could all over Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha dropped to her towel with a bright grin and rolled onto her side.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sorry, I had to put out the fire.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio wiped uselessly at her skin, the droplets having already dried.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m all wet now.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hummed, her eyes staying steady on Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh no, what a shame.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>The tone of her voice, low and dangerous, sent shivers across Rio’s skin.<br/>
____</i>
</p><p>
<i>They finished the drinks Agatha had purchased by the time the sun was starting to set. Both of them were giggly from the alcohol and the heaviness that came from being in the sun all day.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had lost two more rounds of rummy and she looked like she was close to throttling Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio laughed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If you would stop holding your cards when you could lay them down, you’d be doing much better.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s a strategy, Rio.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio mumbled under her breath.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“A bad one.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha launched across the short distance between them, snatching the cards Rio was shuffling and knocking them chaotically to the side. She gripped Rio’s wrists and pinned them to the sand, her eyes bright with mischief as she stared down.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Take it back.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s heart was pounding as she tried to keep her eyes on Agatha’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her face leaning closer.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Take it back.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was going to combust.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Or what?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s breath caught, seeming to only then catch onto their position.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Just when Rio thought she might lean up just a bit… Agatha pulled back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s not a fair fight.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tried to calm her racing mind, her breathing slow and controlled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Raincheck then?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha huffed.</i>
</p><p><i>“Yeah, Rio. Raincheck.”</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>That had been a turning point in several ways. One, Rio was fully aware and panicking about her massive crush on Agatha fucking Harkness. Two, somebody had spotted them. Three, that somebody had recognized Agatha and had sold the photo to a shitty tabloid.</p><p>Rio pulled the foam pad in front of the mirror and started her single-leg stands, her eyes closing as she lifted her right leg first.</p><p>Maybe the Agatha she’d seen on the day that picture dropped was really just who she was.<br/>
_____________</p><p>
<i>Two Weeks and Four Days Prior</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio woke to four fists pounding on her bedroom door. She jolted, her eyes flying wide as Jen called through.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We’re coming in! Even if Harkness is in there too!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s mouth dropped open but she did not have nearly enough information to know what the fuck Jen was talking about.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The door flew open and Jen and Alices’ faces fell when they saw that she was alone.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen stormed up to the bedside and pointed down at Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What the actual shit, Rio.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shrunk back slightly, the energy coming at her far too intense for early morning on a Sunday.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What?!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice sat down, always the calm one, but even she looked like she had a lot of things to say.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Harkness? Why didn’t you tell us?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio felt a sickening sink in her stomach, still unsure what they knew or didn’t know.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Tell you what? I’m letting her help me with my PT as a part of her senior capstone project.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen scoffed and drew out her phone.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Is this a part of your PT then?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked, a pit cratering her stomach as she processed the image on Jen’s screen.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was her and Agatha on the beach, their towels twisted after Agatha had pinned her. It looked… risque. Even knowing nothing happened, the image zinged hot through her body.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh my god.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked at the caption.</i>
</p><p>CAUGHT IN THE ACT. Daughter of Lost Pop Icon Caught Sneaking Around With College Soccer Star She Put in the Hospital!</p><p>
<i>Rio wanted to puke.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh fuck.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen and Alice quickly sobered up at Rio’s panic, Alice placing a hand on Rio’s shin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Woah hang on, it’s okay.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was still staring at the screen, a manic alarm pounding in her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay!? My fucking picture is in a magazine! My parents might see this!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen tilted her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Let’s be so real, Rio. You know your parents’ only interaction with social media comes from Instagram. And only so they can follow you and all your friends. Nobody on the team is going to repost it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She wasn’t wrong, but it did very little to ease the spikes of panic driving Rio’s heartrate up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice interjected.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’ll blow over. Agatha’s mom isn’t in the music industry anymore.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio groaned and dropped back onto the bed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m not leaving the house today.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen laughed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You are. The team is getting brunch.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shook her head emphatically.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Nope. You think I’m going to put myself in front of the team after all of them have seen that?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice grinned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“The sooner you get it over with, the better.” She sobered. “Do you want to talk about it?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio did. And she didn’t. Because she wasn’t allowed to tell them the truth. Her roommates thought she’d received an increased scholarship from the school. They believed their rent was being paid by the housing allowance.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It wasn’t far from the truth. Rio had been told her importance on the team, should she give them another year instead of going for the NWSL draft, would allow the school to provide a full-ride in her last year. It just hadn’t happened yet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“She really is helping me with my PT. For her project.” Rio grimaced. “We just kind of… started hanging out sometimes too. And nothing happened before or after that photo.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice nodded, her perceptive eyes studying Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Did you want it to?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio flushed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No. Maybe. Fuck, I don’t know. It’s confusing. This whole situation is actually ridiculous.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Jen chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Well I, for one, would love for you to rail Agatha Harkness and tell me who comes out on top.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Alice slapped Jen’s arm.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Not helpful.” She squeezed Rio’s leg. “We’re here if you want to talk, okay?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded.<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stared at Agatha’s reply as if the words might rearrange themselves.</i>
</p><p>Agatha: You signed off on it. Not sure what you want me to say.</p><p>
<i>Rio had sent her the article link with a plethora of exclamation points and a question mark. Maybe not the most effective way to get her point across, but she hadn’t expected… this.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She typed out her response, her chest tight.</i>
</p><p>Tell me it’ll go away!</p><p>Agatha: It’ll go away.</p><p>
<i>That was that. No other message, no comment about their PT session the next day.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio spent the rest of hers trying to fend off the jabs of her team, a weird melancholy filling her.<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had almost expected that Agatha would bail or fail to show up at all. Instead, she was already in the training room when Rio arrived.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha didn’t look at her, didn’t point her pretty smile Rio’s way as she motioned toward the floor.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Warm up. We’re going to elevate a few of your exercises today.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her voice was monotone, empty of the snark or the hint that she enjoyed Rio’s presence at all.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio felt her melancholy shift to anger. She crossed her arms.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shrugged, grabbing her bag and storming toward the door.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Great, then it sounds like you don’t need me. The clipboard over there has your sets.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was generally level-headed. She wasn’t one to take rash actions or put herself in unnecessary drama.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But, as Agatha moved to storm past her, Rio reached out and grabbed her arm.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Stop being an asshole and talk to me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha froze, her eyes shooting down to the point of connection, her own anger rearing to life on her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m not being an asshole. I’m just trying to do your physical therapy and you’re being difficult!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio laughed meanly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Difficult?! My face and body are plastered on magazines right now. Forgive me if I need time to adjust!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha pulled her arm free but she didn’t leave.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You signed off on it!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio threw her hands wide.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“So!? That doesn’t mean it doesn’t make me uncomfortable!”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha deflated slightly, her angry blue eyes falling away from Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I get it. If you want to just… stop, I can probably turn in what I already have. I’ll still pay your rent.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s brow crinkled and she tried to piece together what the fuck Agatha was talking about.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t want to stop, Agatha. I just want you to talk to me. Why are you being like this?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha rolled her eyes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“This is what I’m like.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio looked at her hard, her eyes narrowing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No it’s fucking not.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, because you’re the expert?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio caught the flicker of insecurity, so brief she might not have noticed had she spent less time staring at Agatha’s face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No. I’m not trying to tell you how you are. But–” She bit the bullet. “We’re friends. I thought.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s softened, her eyes finding Rio’s again.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We are.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>It almost sounded like a question and Rio’s heart clenched.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay, good. So will you talk to me or do you need to storm out and come back around later?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha crossed her arms protectively but she turned back into the room and walked with Rio to the rubber floor.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m sorry you got blasted on a tabloid.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shook her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It’s not your fault.” She started warming up. “Is this going to hurt your chances to get the position?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha looked like she didn’t believe the first statement and she shrugged to the second.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t know. Maybe. My mom isn’t happy. She said it looks like I’m whoring around.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was taken aback.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why would she say that?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha laughed mirthlessly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh, she’s said much worse. That’s nothing.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio frowned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Did you tell her nothing happened?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“She said it didn’t matter. And she’s right. It’s the way things look. She said it would be better if we were dating so at least I would look like I could commit.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tried to mesh together the mom she’d heard about from Agatha’s childhood to the one calling her daughter a whore. Her next words were out before she could think them through.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Would it help if we were?” At Agatha’s startled look, Rio flushed and continued quickly. “I mean, like, if they believed we were. We could act like we were dating if it helps keep your mom and the investors happy?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha looked taken aback.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You would do that?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio shrugged.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why not? You’re paying my rent to help you keep your image intact. This is just me doing that.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She’d said it to paint it logically, to ease Agatha’s doubts, but it seemed to have an opposing effect.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded, her expression strained.</i>
</p><p><i>“Right. Okay.”</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>Rio felt her growing apathy shrink back down as she remembered the way Agatha had looked that day.</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>Agatha had fucked up. She really had. But so had Rio. She could have handled the truth better. She could have handled a lot of things better.</p><p>Rio set small cones on the ground for her lateral step overs and tried to ignore how fucking boring this was without Agatha there to badger her.<br/>
_____________</p><p>
<i>Two Weeks Prior</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stared at the picture on her Instagram with mounting dread. They’d posted a selfie, her and Agatha with their respective school jackets on. It was meant to sell the story, but it also meant that Rio was about to become a liar.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The call from her parents was the worst, their excitement at meeting Agatha during parents week sending chills down Rio’s spine.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They looked good together. Rio wouldn’t deny that. But it made the dread that had slowly begun to build in her chest double.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They’d spent the past two evenings together, once for rehab, the day after just the two of them working on homework in a coffee shop between their two campuses.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had said they wouldn’t need to act couple-y unless they were on campus or they spotted anyone with a camera that wasn’t just their phone.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They’d been comfortably slouched over their computers for the past two hours and Rio was surprised at how much she’d actually gotten done. She was about to say so when she received a text.</i>
</p><p>Agatha: By the window. Chick with the hat that just walked in has a camera.</p><p>
<i>Rio used every ounce of willpower not to look. She felt her skin buzz in anticipation, not certain what pretending to be a couple meant to Agatha. Maybe she should hold her hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio stewed for approximately ten seconds before Agatha stood up, sliding her computer to Rio’s side, and settled in the booth next to her. She pushed Rio’s laptop aside and leaned into her slightly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Just pretend you’re checking this over. I doubt she’ll stay long.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s entire body reacted to the proximity, her lungs seizing as Agatha’s hand settled on her thigh. She tried to make it seem natural even as she nearly fainted.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Why are they following you? I thought you said your mom wasn’t really in the scene anymore.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s thumb brushed against her skin idly, her attention on Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I looked into them. It’s a pretty new tabloid. I’m not big news, not really. But it was probably their biggest post since they launched. It’s pretty smart, honestly. They’re selling it as a rivals thing to a bunch of college kids that know of us. If the story wasn’t there, this would have already disappeared.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded, her body throbbing at the gentle movements of Agatha’s hand.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Got it.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha studied her too closely, her lips curling up playfully.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Are you alright, Rio?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio wasn’t sure if she was acting or if she was asking a real question. Either way, the answer was the same.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sure. Totally.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes sparkled, her hand sliding higher on Rio’s thigh, and Rio let out a quiet gasp.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yeah?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio felt the challenge there and she met Agatha’s eyes. She curled her fingers over the back of Agatha’s hand and moved it to Agatha’s thigh. Instead of withdrawing, Rio let her palm slide off and settle on Agatha’s skin. She scratched lighty, catching the way Agatha’s breathing stuttered.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Are you?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s chest rose and fell, her eyes searching Rio’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Not at all. A pretty woman’s hands are on me.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio felt the tension ratchet higher, both of them too stubborn to back down. She pressed her legs together and shifted in her seat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“All it takes is a little touch?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s voice rasped.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I could definitely take more.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio thought she might black out.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You asking?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha drew in a sharp breath as Rio dug her nails in slightly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Just stating a fact.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>A server came by to pick up their empty mugs and Rio retreated, her heart racing as her fingers itched to return to their previous position. She stared at her computer screen and decided that her productivity was done for the day.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She had no idea what she was going to do, she just needed to do something. Whether that was having Agatha drop her off at home so she could fuck herself until this need dissipated, or dragging Agatha to the bathroom and slamming her against the wall to get her mouth on her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha seemed to be on a similar page. She closed her computer and slid it into her bag.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Some of my teammates are going to come to mine to watch a movie. If you want to come?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded before she considered the implications.<br/>
_____</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was getting used to her preconceived notions about Agatha being wrong. She’d expected one, maybe two teammates.</i>
</p><p><i>Nearly everyone from Agatha’s team was tucked into the massive living room of Agatha’s </i>house.<i> She had bought a house just for college. Her wealth was generally astounding, but so was the way she seemed to throw it away without thought.</i></p><p>
<i>Rio watched Agatha interact with her team like she was grateful to have them, like sometimes she was still surprised when they went out of their way to engage with her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They were rambunctious and loud and welcoming, including Rio in their shenanigans, in poking fun at one another.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They asked about her PT progress, told her how much Agatha talked about her– Agatha was displeased with that information being revealed– and spoke about classes and homework like every other college kid Rio knew.</i>
</p><p>
<i>By the time they began to disperse, Rio had found herself simply watching Agatha. She couldn’t help it. Stone cold sober and she still felt like she was under some kind of spell.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha walked the last two, her fellow forwards, to the door and said her goodbyes. She collapsed on the couch beside Rio and their bodies were pressed against one another. Neither drew attention to it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Sorry if that was a lot.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio grinned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Please, they’re awesome.” She looked toward the door. “How many of them are fucking each other?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha let out a startled laugh, her eyes dancing with delight as she turned toward Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You caught that, huh?” She settled in, turning so that her knees were resting on Rio’s thigh. “I only know about Bishop and Belova for sure because I caught them in the locker room. I have my feelings about a few others.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio chuckled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Soccer is so fucking gay. Have you fucked your teammates?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha smirked and shook her head.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I prefer to keep the drama to a minimum. It wouldn’t paint me in a very good light if it went badly.” She shrugged. “People already have their opinions of me. I don’t want to prove them right.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nudged her lightly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“They really seem to love you, Agatha. I think they would protect you.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha gave a pained smile.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yeah, maybe. Why risk it though? I can scratch the itch with people that have no connection to my life.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio hummed. They were so close that she could smell the gentle perfume Agatha wore, a blend of cashmeran, apricot, and things Rio didn’t know the name for but deeply enjoyed. It was the reason she spoke without thinking, something she was doing quite often around Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s unfortunate.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s brows raised, her head tilting as she parsed through Rio’s meaning.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“How so?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had never been a coward when it came to women. She’d adopted and lived the belief that if she received a no, it wasn’t meant to be. But the thought of hearing no from Agatha felt dramatically close to world-ending.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio rode a delicate line.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Maybe we should stop hanging out. So I have less of a connection to your life.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha studied her, eyes searching. She looked conflicted for all of two seconds before she was swinging a leg over Rio’s lap, straddling her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was certain she’d never made the sound that came out of her mouth when Agatha kissed her— a cross between a whimper and a moan that Agatha responded to with a whine of her own.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha’s back, pulling her closer, parting her lips as Agatha’s tongue pressed against them.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s hands held either side of Rio’s face, thumbs on her chin to tilt her head back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio lost track of any and all reason, any trail of thought that this might be a bad idea. She felt desperate. She felt like she was on fire, like every nerve in her body was alive and aching to be touched.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha kissed her until her hips were rolling into Rio’s, until their lips were swollen and neither could keep quiet.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio thoughtlessly moved to stand, her hands on Agatha’s ass, and Agatha intentionally unbalanced her, leaning forward and pulling back with a disapproving frown.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If you think I’m going to let you snap your ligament twice because of me, you’ve got another thing coming.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio slid her hands under Agatha’s shirt, her breathing labored.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Is it me?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes narrowed and then unfocused as Rio dragged her nails down her back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fuck.” She crashed her mouth against Rio’s again, mumbling breathlessly. “You have no fucking idea how long I’ve wanted to do this.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio sucked Agatha’s tongue into her mouth and pressed back with her own before drawing back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I have— a pretty— pretty good idea.” Rio pushed Agatha’s shirt over her head and pressed her palms against Agatha’s shoulders so she could look. “Fuck you are unreal.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha knocked Rio’s hands aside and yanked Rio’s shirt until she was able to pull it free. She flung it over the back of the couch and sat back, taking her own time with the view.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her pupils were blown wide, her mouth parted as she followed her hands with her eyes, running them down Rio’s chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She met Rio’s gaze.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“To be clear, we’re going to fuck right now, yeah?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio let out a breathy laugh, her smile wide.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Yeah.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded, her hands cupping Rio’s tits through her bra.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Any hard no’s?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio felt warmth blossom in her chest. She’d genuinely never been asked that before.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I— fuck. I don’t always like penetration. Depends on the day.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Anything else?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio swallowed, her back arching as Agatha’s fingers slid over her nipples.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Not that I’m aware of.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hummed, her hands lowering to press under the band of Rio’s sports bra.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Tell me if one makes itself known.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded and lifted her arms as her bra was tugged up and off.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s hands were already on her chest, palming her tits. She didn’t look like she was listening.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio caught her wrists and her attention.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Agatha. What about you?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s chest rose and fell harshly, her eyes refocusing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t mark me?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She said it like a question, like she wasn’t sure it was okay to say.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio nodded.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She waited for Agatha to continue, keeping her fingers locked on Agatha’s wrists.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t like to feel trapped.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Physically?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha shrugged, again looking like she wasn’t sure if she was supposed to have said anything.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio tilted her head, catching Agatha’s gaze when she tried to look away.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I don’t need to do anything you don’t want. Can you clarify?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha huffed, her hips shifting.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Because that’s sexy.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio changed her tone, her words coming out firm, unrelenting.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“It is. Tell me exactly so I can make you feel good.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes glazed over slightly, a gasp leaving her mouth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Jesus, I—“Agatha’s hips stuttered and she tried again. “I just— I get claustrophobic when too many parts of me can’t move.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio released one of her hands, reaching up to place her hand on Agatha’s throat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Good girl.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s mouth parted, her cheeks flushing a darker red as she pressed into Rio’s hand. She looked relieved.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio drew in a sharp breath.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You are so fucking sexy.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s hips ground into her again and Rio wondered for a moment if she could get her off with just her thigh.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio slid her hand behind Agatha’s neck and drew her into another kiss, this one open-mouthed and somehow more feral than the others.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She released Agatha’s wrist, using her hand to encourage Agatha’s winding movements against her until she was certain she couldn’t go another second without touching her properly.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio moved her hand to the clasp on Agatha’s bra and released it, pulling the material out of her way.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She broke the kiss, pushing Agatha back so she could press her mouth over her tits. She laved her tongue around Agatha’s nipple and then scraped it with her teeth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s head fell back, a whine leaving her mouth as her hands tightened on Rio’s shoulders.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I need you to fuck me. Now.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio hummed, the sensation enough to draw another whimper from Agatha.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ll be taking my time.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha groaned, the sound laced with frustration, and had the audacity to reach one of her hands down to her own jeans.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio caught it, drawing away to glare.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“No.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha glared back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If you think you’re in charge, you are sorely mistaken.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s hand tightened around Agatha’s.</i>
</p><p><i>“I don’t </i>think<i> anything.” She slid her hand up Agatha’s chest and wrapped her hand around her throat to the same effect as before. “I know I am.” She applied pressure to the sides of Agatha’s neck. “You want me to believe you aren’t drenched just because I called you good?”</i></p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes lidded, her voice rasping out a weak rebuttal.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’m wet from being on top of you. From looking at your tits. From tasting your mouth.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio felt her own slick between her thighs, a rush of it ruining her underwear at Agatha’s words. She leaned back even though her mind and body screamed at her not to. She rested her arms on the back of the couch and lifted a brow.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay then. Fuck yourself. I don’t mind watching.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes narrowed.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fine.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She shoved her hand past her waistband and shuddered as she touched herself. She used her other hand to brace herself on Rio’s shoulder, her eyes closing as she started to work herself over.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was hot to watch Agatha twitch and shift as she tried to relieve the ache. It was even hotter to see her mounting frustration as Rio’s hands stayed where they were.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It didn’t take long for Agatha to let out an irritated growl, her hand withdrawing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio lifted a brow.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Okay?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes were narrowed but she looked desperate.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You can…”</i>
</p><p>
<i>She trailed off, the words clearly hard for her to say.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio moved then, her fingers circling Agatha’s hips as she leaned in, her mouth ghosting over Agatha’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Say it, Agatha. I’ll make sure you’re taken care of.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha bit her lip, her words terse.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You’re in charge.” Then she added: “This time.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio smiled softly, pulling Agatha against her by her hips.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s it.” She kissed Agatha’s jaw. “I thought you’d make me work harder.” She dragged her teeth against the sensitive skin below her ear. “I should have known you’d be too impatient.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha started to pull back and Rio let her teeth press harder into her neck. Agatha melted against her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio pressed against her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Take me to your room.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha led the way, her fingers linked through Rio’s.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio was thrumming with want and they’d barely made it through the bedroom door when she pulled Agatha back into her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha walked them backward toward the bed, settling down and pulling Rio to stand between her legs. Her hands were greedy as she scraped her nails along Rio’s skin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“If you don’t fuck me in the next ten seconds I’m going throw you down and mount your fucking face.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio groaned, the words sinking into her and traveling low.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“We could do that anyway.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha dragged at her, tugging her onto the bed and barely giving Rio time to lay back before she was crawling up her body. She paused halfway to shuck off her pants, her struggle drawing a laugh from Rio’s mouth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha glowered and tossed her underwear in Rio’s face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Shut the fuck up.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio fisted them in her hand and smirked.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Give my mouth something better to do.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha maneuvered herself gracefully, her hands settling on the headboard as she straddled Rio’s face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It wasn’t usually Rio’s strategy. She liked to touch and test her way to understanding the body of whomever she was in bed with. But Agatha’s words had punched a hole in her gut and she thought she might die if she didn’t taste her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She wrapped her arms around Agatha’s hips and pulled her down against her mouth.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Her moan was overpowered by the cry Agatha let out as Rio opened her mouth against her cunt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s hips shuddered down and Rio explored with slow, broad strokes until Agatha was a mess of sound.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She pulled at Agatha’s hips, encouraging her to grind down, and only picked up her pace when Agatha’s hips started rolling.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It was euphoric. Rio lost herself in the taste of her, in the words Agatha babbled. There was something powerful in bringing her to heel, in turning her quick words into desperate almost-pleas.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She pressed her tongue inside and let Agatha fuck herself on it as she lifted her hands up to pinch her nipples. Agatha let out a string of curses, her hands falling from the headboard to tangle in Rio’s hair.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio groaned and let her tongue return to Agatha’s clit, finding a rhythm that caused Agatha’s movements to stutter. She doubled down, flicking her tongue across Agatha’s clit until Agatha’s hands tightened into near-painful fists in her hair and her head dropped back.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio felt a surge of wetness on her chin and cheeks and she licked Agatha through her orgasm with careful strokes.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha tremored even after it had abated, the aftershocks keeping her in place for several long moments.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Eventually, she collapsed beside Rio and laid on her back, her breathing labored.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Jesus fuck, Rio.” She laughed in surprise, her eyes closing. “Give me thirty seconds.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio grinned, her legs shifting against one another at the thought of Agatha’s fingers on her.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I expected better stamina.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s eyes shot open and with a flurry of movement, she clambered across Rio’s hips. She leaned low, kissing Rio and tasting herself, before pulling back.</i>
</p><p><i>“I hope you know I’m not going to stop fucking you until you beg me. Get your jokes out now.”</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>Rio tried to stop her mind from falling into the warmth of how fucking good Agatha felt. Rio’s body still reacted to the thought of her, her stomach clenching at the slew of fresh memories that coursed through her head.</p><p>They’d been nearly inseparable for two straight weeks, finding time most days to dip into empty rooms or stop by Agatha’s house. It never felt planned, their meetings often for rehab or homework leading to their hands all over each other.</p><p>Rio honestly felt bad about the amount of times she’d bent Agatha over the therapy table in the room meant for ice baths and one-on-one treatment.</p><p>But Agatha was an instigator. She had a smart mouth and she could always find a way to set Rio off, to make her forget that they were in a public space where anyone could walk in.</p><p>Rio finished her balance drills and let herself feel a tinge of excitement as she picked up her gear and made her way to the turf practice field. She dropped her bag and lined up on the goalie line.</p><p>Her first few rounds of jogging to the goalie box and back were uncertain. Anxiety pooled in her stomach and flared with every step. As she continued with no pain and only mild twinges of oddness in her knee, she grew more confident.</p><p>Her confidence led to her mind wandering back to the same spot it had been since she’d gotten this stupid injury.<br/>
_____________</p><p>
<i>One Week Prior</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio bit at the fingers currently pressed over her mouth and Agatha grunted, her hand dislodging to tangle in Rio’s hair and yank her head back. The action startled Rio enough that she stopped trying to wrestle herself free, her mouth dropping open as she moaned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha hummed, pleased, and pulled Rio tighter against her chest.</i>
</p><p>
<i>They’d been working before, each sitting with their laptops in their laps, a weird lofi mix playing from Agatha’s sound system. They’d figured it made sense. Both of them had essays to write, why not write them in the same place. As motivation. Or something.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It had taken Agatha all of two minutes to get off task. She’d set her computer on the coffee table and leaned against Rio to look at what she was doing.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had rolled her eyes, made a single, snarky comment, and Agatha had practically tackled her to the sofa, knocking her computer on the floor with a comment about hoping Rio had saved her work.</i>
</p><p>
<i>The following minutes had just been wrestling.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Despite their first encounter, Agatha was anything but easy to manage. She’d bested Rio a handful of times, her lack of injury truly coming in handy when the gloves hit the mat.</i>
</p><p>
<i>This was one of those times.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Somehow, Agatha ended up on Rio’s back, one of her arms tugging at Rio’s forehead and hair like a fucking animal as she tried to stay in place.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had used every ounce of strength she had to try to flip them.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She had known she was finished when Agatha went willingly, holding Rio and dragging her along as they switched spots.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had felt Agatha’s arm wrap lightly around her neck, the other holding one of her arms to keep her from moving. Agatha’s legs wrapped like a koala around her hips to stop her from moving entirely.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio had struggled, begrudgingly impressed by how strong Agatha was. She collapsed onto Agatha after several fruitless attempts, her breath heaving.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Fuck.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha had nipped at her ear, her tongue sliding along the shell of it, and Rio groaned.</i>
</p><p>
<i>It hadn’t taken long to work Rio up, Agatha’s hands restless in their movements, touching every part of Rio, using rough and soft touches to drive her mad.</i>
</p><p>
<i>When Rio had tried to speak, Agatha had pressed her palm over Rio’s mouth and shoved her other hand down the hem of Rio’s sweatpants, fingers sliding easily against her clit.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s biting had been a last-ditch effort to keep herself from coming like she’d never been touched before.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s fingers toyed with her, driving her close to her peak embarrassingly fast.</i>
</p><p><i>With her head yanked back, the pleasant burn of her hair being pulled, and Agatha’s fingers focusing in, Rio cried out, her back arched, and she trembled through an extended orgasm that had her boneless on top of Agatha for several long minutes.</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>Rio switched to backpedaling drills, becoming far more confident as she continued training without any pain.</p><p>She was breathing harder than she wanted to be, clearly not in the shape she’d been before.</p><p>As she drew to a stop, her hands on her hips, Rio dropped her head back. Her anger, the burning, bitter thing that had sat in her chest for the past thirty hours was starting to dissipate. She clung to it. She didn’t want to know if she was being irrational.<br/>
_____________</p><p>
<i>Two Days Prior</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio woke up with Agatha next to her sprawled rather gracelessly on the sheets. They’d never talked about what this was. It had been spoken around, joked about, and otherwise ignored. Rio was still terrified of the ‘no.’ That fear grew more and more as she got to know Agatha, got to see so many parts of her and how special she was.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She blinked and glanced at the barely-risen sun, her brow furrowing as she tried to figure out why she’d woken up. A buzz sounded and vibrated against her skin. She grabbed her phone, the device somehow having ended up under her back, and pressed it to her ear.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Hello?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>There was a long pause on the other end. Then a voice came through, one that, for some reason, sent chills along Agatha’s spine.</i>
</p><p>”Ah, so you’re the signee.”</p><p>
<i>Rio frowned, her sleepy brain still trying to catch up.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Wha– I think you have the wrong number.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>There was a humorless chuckle from the other end.</i>
</p><p>”How strange. I could have sworn this was my daughter’s number.</p><p>
<i>Rio froze, her lungs seizing as she pulled the phone from her ear to look. She blanched.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Oh I’m so sorry Ms. Harkness, I thought this was my phone. I’ll get Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>”No, that’s alright dear. I just wanted to let her know that her ploy worked and she’s been given the greenlight to assume the COO position at the end of her final term.”</p><p>
<i>Rio felt relief on Agatha’s behalf, some of her anxiety dissipating.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“That’s great news! Are you sure you don’t want to tell her?”</i>
</p><p>”I’m sure.” Agatha’s mother had a calculated voice and Rio felt uneasy. The woman made a false sound of remembrance. “Oh. And tell her that the tabloid paid back her fee. The story ran so well they called it a miracle and refunded her.”</p><p>
<i>Rio felt every statement like a slowly tightening vine around her throat and chest. In the midst of it, she had the sense that Agatha’s mother was aware of the havoc she was creating. Rio let her stubbornness take root and her voice was admirably clear when she answered.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“I’ll make sure to let her know.” She smiled so that it would be heard in her voice. “It was nice to speak with you, Ms. Harkness. Have a good day.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio ended the call, her jaw clenching as she looked back to Agatha’s sleeping form.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She thought of a hundred different scenarios; telling Agatha to leave, leaving herself, saying shit that would make Agatha feel as badly as she did in that moment.</i>
</p><p>
<i>But this had all been a ploy; Agatha wouldn’t give a shit anyway.</i>
</p><p>
<i>And Rio had never been the kind of person to hurt others like that.</i>
</p><p>
<i>A small part of her hoped it wasn’t true, that maybe Agatha’s mom had lied. She should ask, put herself on the line to see if Agatha felt the same way, but she crushed out that inkling of hope without impunity.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She would just tell her straight. Your mom said this. That sucks. Please get out of my house.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She didn’t need to mince words, didn’t need a whole conversation to prove what she already knew. She’d known Agatha for a month and a half and known of her for three years. She could go back to facing her on the field. She’d be fine.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha stirred beside her, her hand reaching out to slap at Rio.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Stop bouncing your leg.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s chest cracked open at the gravely, sleepy tone of Agatha’s voice. All of her prepared thoughts slithered deep down into darkness to be replaced by a greater hurt.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You thought I wouldn’t find out?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha turned her head, her eyes squinting adorably as she tried to understand what Rio meant. She caught Rio’s gaze and stilled.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“What?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio’s patience was thin.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“You set it all up? Had them take our picture so you could sell your story?” Rio gut churned sickeningly, her voice sharpening. “Well, it worked. Your position is secure.” Rio stood. “Enjoy being a corporate stooge, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio walked into her bathroom, hoping against hope that Agatha would just leave, that she would find it in herself to leave the last word.</i>
</p><p>
<i>She heard Agatha call after her and she gripped the countertop in front of her mirror with force.</i>
</p><p>
<i>There was a rustling of sheets, a padding of footsteps, and then Agatha was standing at the door with a wounded expression on her face.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Rio–”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio couldn’t do it.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Don’t. Just–” Rio sighed. “Just go, Agatha.”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Agatha’s expression hardened, her posture going rigid.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Just like that, then?”</i>
</p><p>
<i>Rio snapped.</i>
</p><p>
<i>“Just like that.” She met Agatha’s gaze. “You sure found a way to take what you wanted, huh? Like mother, like daughter.”</i>
</p><p><i>Agatha bristled, her jaw muscles working as she stared Rio down for what felt like far too long. She let out a disdainful laugh and turned away.</i><br/>
_____________</p><p>Rio breathed out a quiet sigh, her chest hurting as if it had just happened all over again. She felt a twinge of guilt, the same guilt that had dragged Rio to Agatha’s game that night. The same guilt that had made her send that stupid text.</p><p>She told herself her brain wasn’t fully developed and that’s why doing the right thing, saying the right thing, was so hard. It didn’t make her feel any better.</p><p>Watching Maximoff lift Agatha up, hugging her after Agatha broke the tie in a very close game, hadn’t done wonders for her either.</p><p>Rio turned and started her lateral shuffles, making sure to keep her body controlled and steady as she moved side to side across the goal box.</p><p>She was on her third rep when she heard a shout.</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing!?”</p><p>Rio nearly stumbled, her head turning to locate Agatha’s pissed off voice.</p><p>Agatha was storming over in her full uniform covered in grass stains, a still fresh scrape down one of her knees. She looked predatory as she stalked to Rio, her face a mask of fury.</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say, didn’t know if she should risk her MCL to start running in the opposite direction. She stayed rooted to the spot, her heartbeat pounding in her ears.</p><p>Agatha walked onto the field and crossed it with angry steps, coming to a halt a few feet away from Rio.</p><p>“You’re going to prolong your rehab if you do shit before your knee is ready.”</p><p>Rio heard the shake in Agatha’s voice and attested it to her anger.</p><p>“I was cleared.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms.</p><p>“Show me.”</p><p>Rio scoffed, her own anger returning.</p><p>“Please. What are you doing here?”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, her hand flinging out.</p><p>“Because you texted me to come!”</p><p>Rio deflated.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have done that.”</p><p>Agatha looked ready to kill her. She pushed her hands through her messy hair, drawing more of the strands loose from its pony.</p><p>“Fuck you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio hated how hot Agatha looked at that moment. She stood her ground despite herself.</p><p>“You did. I hope you got everything you wanted out of this. We don’t have to do this.”</p><p>Agatha let out a frustrated half-scream and turned around to storm off. She made it three steps before she stopped and stomped back, this time closer. She reached out and jabbed Rio in the chest.</p><p>“Why did you text me tonight?”</p><p>Rio slapped away her hand and shrugged.</p><p>“Stupidity.”</p><p>“Can you just be fucking honest with me?”</p><p>Rio scoffed, her eyes widening.</p><p>“Like you were honest with me?”</p><p>Agatha moved closer and Rio smelled her perfume and sweat. Her mouth watered.</p><p>Agatha glared.</p><p>“You didn’t even let me explain!”</p><p>Rio threw up her hands. Her mind screaming at her to protect herself.</p><p>“Explain what? That you planned this all out? That you let me sign that fucking paper knowing I’d have my fucking name and picture splashed across the every college students’ screen for weeks?”</p><p>Agatha matched her pitch.</p><p>“I didn’t mean for that–” She cut herself off and drew in a breath. “I didn’t mean for them to see that. I thought they’d capture an innocent picture of us walking out of your training room or sitting in a bar.” Her voice broke. “Sleeping with you wasn’t a fucking ploy.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t think straight, couldn’t piece together the meaning of Agatha’s words.</p><p>“Then what the fuck was it?”</p><p>Agatha looked away then, her jaw trembling once before she got it under control. She stared at the back of the net for what felt like minutes.</p><p>Rio let out an empty laugh.</p><p>“Okay then.”</p><p>She started to walk past, intent on ending the conversation before she did something horrendous like cry.</p><p>Agatha caught her arm.</p><p>“Rio. Wait.”</p><p>Rio listened. She couldn’t help it. She wanted to know. She needed to hear the words so she could stop the crawling hope that kept finding its way through her.</p><p>Agatha started speaking, stopped, and tried again.</p><p>“Why did you text me? Please.”</p><p>Rio gave up. She couldn’t hold onto her pride. Better to have it dashed and work on rebuilding when the dust settled. Better to close the door on this.</p><p>“Because I wanted to mean something to you the way you mean something to me.” She felt Agatha’s fingers tighten and she shook her head. “You don’t have to say anything, alright? It’s fine. I’m fine. I got lost in it all but I get it. I–” She sighed. “I really am happy that you’re getting what you want. I’m sorry I said shitty things to you about your mom.”</p><p>Agatha shifted in front of her, the hand on her arm moving to hold Rio’s jaw. When Rio stubbornly kept her gaze on anything but Agatha, Agatha spoke quietly.</p><p>“Look at me.” She ran her thumb over Rio’s cheek. “Please.”</p><p>Rio did, her vision immediately blurring with tears.</p><p>Agatha cooed so softly that Rio felt more tears fall before Agatha even started speaking.</p><p>“Rio, you mean something to me.”</p><p>Rio sniffed, her mind trying to pummel her heart into submission.</p><p>Agatha continued in the same voice.</p><p>“I’m so fucking sorry that I didn’t tell you after the picture dropped. I felt terrible but I just– I didn’t want to lose you. I know I had every chance to be honest and I didn’t take it. I was so afraid that you wouldn’t believe me and I let that fear make decisions for me.”</p><p>Rio felt herself soften, her head leaning into Agatha’s hand.</p><p>Agatha took it for what it was, drawing Rio into a hug, their arms closing around one another tightly. She spoke again, her voice right next to Rio’s ear.</p><p>“Honestly my life is a little more fucked up than I let on. I don’t like telling people because I don’t want pity. But I think you’ve figured out by now that my mom is an actual cunt.”</p><p>Rio snorted.</p><p>“Yeah. She seemed to enjoy telling me.” She twisted her hands into Agatha’s jersey, aiming for levity. “We sure handled ourselves well.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“I’m not very well-versed in talking about my feelings. Bitch mom. What’s your excuse?”</p><p>Rio pulled back slightly and rubbed a hand over her eyes.</p><p>“I’m so young.”</p><p>Agatha groaned.</p><p>“You’re a year younger.”</p><p>Rio shook her head forlornly.</p><p>“So, so young.”</p><p>Agatha pushed at her.</p><p>“Freak.”</p><p>Rio met her eyes, her hands pulling slightly, and Agatha caught the cue immediately.</p><p>It was likely the most gentle kiss they’d shared, both of them settling into the security of what might lay ahead of them.</p><p>Rio broke the kiss and leaned her forehead against Agatha’s.</p><p>“Can we go somewhere with a bed, please? Our first time staying the night with one another didn’t go as planned.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, took a step back, and shook her head.</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“Wha–”</p><p>Agatha held out her hand.</p><p>“First, you’re going to show me that you were cleared to be on this field. If you weren’t, I’m going to pummel you. If you were, you aren’t done with your exercises. I’m sure you’re eager to have a ball at your feet again.”</p><p>Rio pouted.</p><p>“Not that excited. I don’t even like soccer. We should probably go.”</p><p>Agatha laughed as he made her way to Rio’s bag to retrieve the soccer ball inside. She tossed it at Rio.</p><p>“Nuh uh. Come on, Vidal. Let’s see what you can do after six weeks of moping around.”</p>
