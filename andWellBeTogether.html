   <h2>
    And We'll Be Together (Forever &amp; Ever More)
   </h2>
   <div>
    <p>
     Rio has been suffering from a nightmare for a month now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though she is in a sacred place under God's protection, namely in a convent at the local church, demons and other evil spirits somehow manage to get to her soul to torment her every night. At least that's what Father Batiste, the church priest and her adoptive father, tells her. Not that she doesn't believe him, but every night she has the same dream, very much like reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dream always starts the same way. She sees the silhouette of a dark-haired woman sitting on top of Rio, the woman just stares and does nothing else. Rio never sees her face, as if something has blurred her vision, and she can't move or make a sound for help. It usually lasts a few minutes, and then the silhouette disappears. Rio wakes up in a cold sweat and can't sleep for another hour, sitting in the farthest corner of her room, holding a large wall cross tightly in her fist. But neither the crosses on the walls, nor the candles placed in the corners of the room, nor the holy water sprinkled all over the floor and bed, nor the prayers recited before going to bed, none of these things work the next night, as well as any other tried protection.
    </p>
    <p>
     So after a month of trying to resist this strange phenomenon, Rio accepts her fate - to die in her sleep from a demon that takes the form of a strange woman who probably doesn't even exist in real life. The other sisters in the convent try to avoid Rio to protect themselves and avoid contracting the disease. Father Baptiste only shrugs his hands aside, not helping in any way to solve the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Help your neighbor according to your means
     </em>
     . Sure, a hundred times.
    </p>
    <p>
     But working at the church and helping the parishioners during the day is enough to distract Rio from bad thoughts and constant nightmares. She manages to eavesdrop on the news from the town and the latest rumors, whether it be missing people or surprise attacks in the evenings by unknown people. Oh, and some of the confessions, which is pretty much one of the sins, so if she has to choose how to die, she'd rather let curiosity ruin her.
    </p>
    <p>
     One day, hidden from the gaze of the others, Rio stands near the back of the confessional, sweeping the floor at half strength and listening to the voices inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, Father Baptiste, I have sinned so,
     <em>
      so badly
     </em>
     ," says a female voice with a note of drama. "I gave in to the temptation of my demons again this week. I threw rotten apples into the cider barrels at one of the local bars so they'd stop ruining other people's lives. Understand me, Father Batiste! And God must understand me, too."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But, Agatha...don't you sell alcohol yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, so what? They're my competitors!" the same female voice hisses unhappily, trying not to raise the intonation and volume above a whisper. "And all those drunks drinking indiscriminately in their bar and causing hooliganism in the streets only get in my way. Other people, and especially lovely ladies, are afraid to come in to see me! As if I allow the same antics in my bar and plan to get them drunk on poison rather than the best aged ciders in England. I hate those bastards."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't give in to hatred and anger, my dear. They are bad counselors."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh no, all these men should be driven out of town with a birch rod. Not you, Father, you're fine. At least you can be put in the '
     <em>
      not-quite-a-man
     </em>
     ' category as long as you keep your celibacy."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I-" The priest seems to be speechless for a second at this formulation, and Rio has to hold back a chuckle to keep from giving herself away. "How your business goes, Agatha, is entirely up to you. Don't make others responsible for your misfortunes. Repeat the Lord's Prayer ten times and the Hail Mary five times. And don't start that argument again! Go home and think again about what you've done."
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a brief moment of silence. Then the confessional door opens, and Rio peeks around the corner to get a closer look at the mysterious woman. A dark purple layered dress, dark hair falling almost to her waist, a small pendant around her neck, and Rio thinks
     <em>
      she's seen her somewhere before
     </em>
     …
    </p>
    <p>
     Her train of thought is interrupted by blue eyes drilling her with a stare exactly where she's been hiding. Before the mysterious woman turns around and moves toward the exit, she crosses herself in reverse, and,
     <em>
      for God's sake
     </em>
     , winks at Rio. The woman walks away, leaving behind the scent of apples and pears and a pile of wild thoughts in Rio's head that tangle and scream at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What in God's name just happened?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio is not tormented by nightmares for the first time in a long time, and she sleeps like a baby for two peaceful nights. On the third day, after a recent incident with the strange woman who somehow, firstly, found out that Rio was eavesdropping on her and the priest, and secondly, ignored and didn't complain but just went about her business, the stranger very quietly creeps up on Rio while she is doing her daily cleaning in the church. The sudden appearance of a stranger nearby almost sends Rio to the grave early - she is frightened, curses, crosses herself, and apologizes to God. All she hears in response is a quiet woman's laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "For someone who likes to eavesdrop on other people's sins, you're not too careful."
    </p>
    <p>
     "For someone who messes up other people's business, you're not very creative," Rio replies, and the woman beside her, whom her father seems to have called Agatha, raises her eyebrows in surprise. She laughs even louder, almost folding in half, and casually places her hand on Rio's shoulder. Maybe that was too harsh a response from a serving nun, and now she's going to be reprimanded for inappropriate obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't worry, I won't tell anyone," Agatha smiles sweetly, but Rio's brain shuts down.
     <em>
      Did I just say that last sentence out loud?
     </em>
     "So what's such a humble and beautiful girl doing in such a quiet and boring place?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Serving the Lord God and helping others find the right path."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, dear, you don't understand. Let me rephrase the question: why are you here? Why are you here and not somewhere else?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The way the question is phrased puts Rio on edge. She's not used to having someone outside of the convent and the church interested in her life. However, she really wants to answer, not for anyone else, but for herself, to start digging up her history and find answers to questions she has never thought of before.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well...Father Baptiste is my adoptive father, so through coincidence, I ended up here when others abandoned me."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmm, not an easy childhood, how much we have in common..." Agatha scoffs and circles around Rio, barely touching her with her fingers like a curious cat that either wants to attack or just show attention. "So, no fun? One continuous '
     <em>
      yes, Father
     </em>
     ' and groveling before the parishioners and God?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Everyone chooses their own path. It doesn't have to please everyone."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ugh, how boring. Personally, I prefer the road of glory, power, and
     <em>
      bodily pleasures
     </em>
     , if you know what I mean," Agatha plays with her eyebrows and adjusts her hat, brushing invisible dirt off the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not even going to count how many sins that one sentence contains."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ha, good girl," Agatha laughs heartily and strokes Rio's cheek. Her cheeks and ears immediately turn red.
     <em>
      What the hell.
     </em>
     "I see in you an unquenchable desire for curiosity in front of new things, even when it scares you. Are you afraid of death?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No. No? I don't know. Rather, there are things I don't understand."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Like what?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why do demons haunt people at night? Why would someone attack defenseless people in the streets?" Agatha breaks contact with Rio, and the nun begins pacing along the small hallway of the church, rambling in her thoughts and peeling the old skin off her fingers. Agatha, listening intently, follows her silently. "The townspeople are worried about the number of assassination attempts and say they are now afraid to go out in the evenings. Many of the victims couldn't even move or do anything to fight back against the power of evil. So, of course, when a person is scared and can't find an adequate explanation, he comes here, to the church, seeking protection under the cover of God."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And how will God protect them, huh? Send a magical aura that will scare away these '
     <em>
      forces of evil
     </em>
     '? Or will he turn their blood into wine so a vampire can't drink it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "A vampire?" Rio stops and looks genuinely surprised. "But those are children's fairy tales, vampires don't exist..."
    </p>
    <p>
     "My naive summer child, do you really think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, but..." Rio hesitates and rubs the edge of her sleeve nervously, mulling over this thought. "How can we protect ourselves from something we've never seen or known? Fear is the body's defense response, and we need to come to terms with it and accept it as part of life."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hums and looks at Rio as if she's looking right through her, which makes the nun uncomfortable deep down. She begins to speak, lowering her tone, with seriousness in her voice, "Fear is an unnecessary obstacle to a normal life. If you live in fear all your life, if you are afraid of everything around you, then it's not a life at all. I've never understood how you can be afraid of unfamiliar things when they might be
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     . After all, it's one way of exploring the outside world."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But the vampire killed..."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The vampire attacked the guilty ones," Agatha hisses back, her pupils pulsing, shrinking, and then widening. Rio can feel some sort of aura emanating from the woman, something that is frightening in its power, yet beckoning to her. Even if something were to happen now, there are no people around them to help. "Rapists. Drunks who raised their hands to their wife and children. Rich men who...well, just because they deserved it and it was fun."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What I'm saying is that you're only seeing one side of the coin, when in fact there is another side. Yes, it may not please God, but if he doesn't do anything about it, even someone as bad as a vampire can become good."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You say that like he's an old friend."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulls away and shrugs her shoulders without enthusiasm, leaving the question hanging in the air. She runs her long fingernails slowly along the wall of the church, scratching and leaving small grooves in the stone surface. For a moment, Rio imagines herself instead of the wall - she wants to feel these red and burning marks on her skin, throbbing with pain, but at the same time, it's pain that would be pleasant. These are unforgivable carnal thoughts, but Rio continues to think about them until Agatha's voice and her hand on the shoulder pull Rio out of her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sister Rio."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio..." Agatha drawls the name out loud, and it sounds so beautiful in her mouth that Rio feels a strange weakness in her legs and a pleasant feeling in her lower abdomen. She knows what it is, but the thought of it makes her blush even more and fall into a stupor. Agatha widens her eyes in surprise, but a sly smile slowly forms on her lips. "Well, Rio, you're an interesting thing. I'll see you next time. Soon we'll test how fearless you are."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio doesn't have time to ask what it means, because Agatha disappears from her sight like a shadow among the crowd, vanishing as if at the snap of her fingers, leaving behind the scent of lilacs and wildflowers this time. The hope that they'll see each other again makes the inner demons come alive and fill the mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if it helps Rio get through new nights without nightmares, she'll turn to a faith where God is a woman with blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Over the next two weeks, Rio sleeps peacefully, no longer having nightmares, which makes her happy, giving her more energy and enthusiasm for life and what's going on around her. But that doesn't change the fact that the silhouette of the stranger is still present in her dreams, replacing them with something more...
     <em>
      pleasant and exciting
     </em>
     . After nights like this, Rio has to wash her face with cold water to wash away the itchy feeling under her skin and calm the buzzing running through her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
     The attacks on the townspeople are still going on, but there are fewer murders, and people are calming down a bit, adjusting to the new reality. The mysterious woman, Agatha, returns to the church periodically and accidentally (or not) crosses paths with Rio each time: then to place a candle to pray for '
     <em>
      the worst life in hell
     </em>
     ' for her mother while Rio cleans up inside the church; then during the service, singing falsely and changing the lyrics of a song until she is scolded by the parishioners and chased out of the church; then on the church grounds near the apple trees, trying to steal new fruits for her cider while Rio walks around the grounds. And if Rio doesn't fully understand this behavior and realizes that everything Agatha plans and does is sinful, even against the rules, she is wildly curious to learn more about this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     She catches Agatha off guard, getting her revenge for the last time, when Agatha is about to leave the garden, having replenished her food supply in the form of an entire basket of apples. Even though the Bible says nothing about alcohol, stealing apples belonging to someone else's property is still condemned and punishable by local government laws.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can't make dry cider from this variety of apple tree. The fruit is too sweet."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tries not to show consternation, but still flinches slightly when she hears a voice from behind her. "As long as it's free, any fruit will do. And anyway, how would a nun know about making cider?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We have our own cellars where we age our own cider every season for the holidays," Agatha gasps, clutching her hand to her chest, to which Rio rolls her eyes. "Don't react like it's something illegal. Unlike you, we do it legally."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey! I actually have a license. And as I recall, the church is a public place, which means everything else belongs to the community too. Do not forget to do good and to share with others, right?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio resists the urge to roll her eyes repeatedly, not wanting to provoke Agatha into more pointed comments. She picks up the fallen fruit, which looks worse than the ones on the branches, but which could also be useful in the kitchen or in making cider.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's one thing I can't understand, Agatha. Why do you keep going to church if you don't like it? You're not like the other believers."
    </p>
    <p>
     "My late mother, may she rest in hell, was a Christian. She spent most of her life trying to raise me to be a proper Christian, especially when she learned some bad things about me that '
     <em>
      defame our faith
     </em>
     '. Then I ran away from home, my life changed completely, and I became...a different person. Soon I learned that my mother had died, caught up in her own pride and stinginess, I suppose. But the habit of going against her has stayed with me until these days."
    </p>
    <p>
     "For the path you've taken in life, you look young."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Virgins' blood helps," Rio frowns her eyebrows, a hurricane of thoughts racing through her head as she tries to piece together the known facts about the woman. Agatha laughs and places her hand on the nun's back, gently stroking her lower back. The thoughts in Rio's head instantly become confused and quiet. "I'm kidding, Rio. I'm not a vampire."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right..."
    </p>
    <p>
     "By the way, how are your nightmares? They're not bothering you anymore?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "How did you...I never told you about that."
    </p>
    <p>
     An outside observer would not have noticed anything strange in Agatha's changed behavior. But Rio, who has been watching her tirelessly all this time, manages to catch a second of panic in the eyes opposite. Agatha gathers her face after a brief pause and replies as if nothing had happened, "I assumed, given how concerned you were about the matter the first time we met. Perhaps heard some rumors about you from the other nuns."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio doesn't believe her, but nods in agreement for the sake of appearances. Even if Agatha notices it, she doesn't insist and lets the situation go, changing the subject abruptly. "Do you want a secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, I'm not sure I'm the right person for this..."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of all the people in this damn town, you're the only person I want to spend my free time with. I don't know how to explain it. You're interesting, inquisitive, not like the others, and, may I say something stupid, but you're beautiful. That's why I come here every time I'm bored and want to do something stupid to mess with the people around me. Your presence...well, sort of soothes my animal nature and at the same time inflames it even more."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     . Rio's heart beats a little faster at the confession, making everything inside her strangely clench and hum just like after those strange dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm just an ordinary nun living the most boring life. Why me? Why not someone else?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha fishes out a stolen apple from a wicker basket and holds it in the palm of her hand like a gift, like an offering, right in front of the nun. "Because the part of you that lives inside - it's bright, chaotic,
     <em>
      real
     </em>
     , held back only by the outer shell you've been forced into over the years. I want to be your guide to the world of all that is unknown and secret, to help you open up to the world and get to know it. All you have to do is trust me. Do you trust me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks at the apple skeptically, mentally laughing at the absurdity and metaphorical nature of the situation. Part of her screams that it's a trick, that there's no need to agree to such a deal; the other part whispers wishful thinking, encouraging her to agree and try, to learn more, and more,
     <em>
      and more
     </em>
     about everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     The inner demons win. She takes the apple and, without taking her eyes off Agatha, bites into the fruit, chewing a bite and savoring the way the sweet juice runs down the inside of her throat and outward from the corners of her lips to her chin, catching the attention of the woman across from her. She might regret that decision later, but right now, she is giving Agatha a part of herself that she has always carefully hidden behind a veil of faith and teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiles victoriously and takes the apple, biting into it with all desire.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After that, the strange dreams return and, in some ways, get worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio has to change her bed every few days, waking up every morning in a cold sweat with a feeling of severe weakness and exhaustion. The other nuns still avoid her and discuss her strange behavior behind her back, referring to demons
     <em>
      , and if they only knew
     </em>
     that demons take on mysterious forms of unfamiliar girls who do incredibly sinful but surprisingly pleasant things.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the service, while working inside the church and outside, Agatha always stays close, attending the church almost every day, which is unusual for her behavior. She shares with Rio news from the city, tells more about her life and her business, and manages to annoy the other parishioners who are on her blacklist (where it came from - Rio has no idea, assuming it's bad visitors from Agatha's bar). Rio turns a blind eye to all her shenanigans and laughs quietly to herself, getting reprimanded by the parishioners who are annoying and bothersome.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      They don't understand
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It's a weekend, and Agatha purposefully goes to the priest, asking him to hear her confession. Rio takes advantage of the moment, moving closer to the confessional and hiding near the columns to eavesdrop on the conversation. She still remembers that she shouldn't do that, but the whisper inside her grows stronger and stronger with each passing day.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Father Baptiste, I have sinned."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you throw rotten apples into the cider barrels of your competitors again?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Worse. I fucked a nun," the priest breaks off sharply into a cough, choking when he hears the confession. "In my dreams, of course, but Father, that sin of lust haunts me every night, forcing me to imagine such things that I want to do again in person."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jesus, Agatha! You know it's forbidden! You shouldn't follow the voices of your demons, no matter how much they tempt you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But this girl in my dreams is so
     <em>
      familiar
     </em>
     and so incredible. She's beautiful, smart, and fearless. She's funny and she doesn't judge me for what I do. Well, maybe just a little. I want to steal her and show her the whole world so we can be together
     <em>
      forever
     </em>
     . Also she fucks well too."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lord have mercy, spare me the details," Father Baptiste mutters under his breath and crosses himself several times, which Agatha notices with the corner of her eye behind the partition. "Strengthen your mind and resist temptation, and then God will deliver you from evil. Let us consider it a mistake. God is merciful, my child. And he forgives you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's all?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's all, child, amen."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Amen, damn it."
    </p>
    <p>
     While the priest is still in shock and mentally collects himself together after what he heard, keeping this secret just between the three of them (including God, of course), Agatha leaves the confessional and walks straight to the nearest column, turning the corner and knowing she'll find one particular person there. Rio breathes heavily, keeping her distance at arm's length. There is no fear or disgust in her eyes, but the inquisitive and dark gaze with which she pins Agatha to the wall drills harder and harder with each passing second, and it stirs the blood in the veins better than any alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I thought eavesdropping was a sin, Sister Rio."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shut up. Fucking a nun, even in your dream, is no better," Rio grabs Agatha's hand and leads her away to the part of the church closed to visitors, where the storage areas for the kitchen are located. Surprisingly, at this time of day, there is no one here, and only their quiet breathing cuts through the silence. "And now that we're alone, admit it honestly - was that dream about me? Are you dreaming about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The corner of Agatha's mouth twitches slightly at the directness of the question. But she doesn't look embarrassed, instead smiling smugly. She glows with self-confidence and strength that makes it seem like there's nothing in this world she's not ready for.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've dreamed of you every day and every night since I first saw you, darling. Until recently, I've tried to be...tactful."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tactful, for God's sake. You and your tricks drove me crazy every time because it's stupid and, I don't know, kind of romantic? In the sense that you were clearly doing it to get my attention and test me. And I kept covering for you because I was interested and amused. My brain and my body go crazy every night over some stranger who resembles you and I can't find a way out of the damn situation," Rio stops gibbering, catching her breath and gathering her thoughts. Agatha blinks stupidly a few times, as if she's just been told of the existence of a second head. Or maybe this is just a one-off moment of her not being prepared for what's going on. "Okay.
     <em>
      Jesus fucking Christ
     </em>
     , okay, I don't mind. I just want to calm my demons, and if you help me, then so be it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, being an absolute idiot around pretty girls, can think of nothing better to say but to reply, "Oh, so you know how to swear when the Holy Father can't see?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pats Agatha's forearm, but can't hold back a burst out laugh. "That's all you could understand from that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I think there was something about you not minding," Agatha purrs like a cat, advancing on Rio. She pushes her against the wall, pinning her arms down and hoping to regain control, but as soon as Rio twirls Agatha's curls around her finger and pulls her back, all the arrogance and self-confidence fall away, leaving behind only a ghostly trace of the Agatha that really has power.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're a bad influence on me, Agatha. You need to do something about it before I get kicked out of the church altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmm, maybe that's what I'm doing. Seducing young nuns to turn them to the evil side and build a new Sodom and Gomorrah."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shakes her head, laughing. In all her time at the convent, she has never felt so alive as she does now. Overwhelmed with emotion, clearly aware of every moment, every instant, paying attention to what had been taboo before, going against all the rules.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now she can't wait to get a taste of real life.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So I'll sneak out in the night and let you inside so we can have some privacy in the cold but very quiet basement?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll come to you myself," and before Rio can ask anything else (like
     <em>
      how the hell Agatha is going to sneak into her room
     </em>
     ), the woman leaves a quick kiss on Rio's cheek and moves away. Before opening the door and leaving the room, she throws one last glance at a flushed and slightly out of breath Rio, winking and smiling slyly. "Don't be afraid of the night, I'm in it."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio makes the new bed and lights all the candles as if she's an attentive and knowledgeable lover. She reads a book before going to bed and paces back and forth across the room, trying to calm herself and wait for Agatha to appear. Two hours after lights out, the urge to sleep becomes stronger, and she falls into another strange dream that catches up with her as soon as she closes her eyes. The dream changes in plot, adding new details, as if someone in her mind has removed the veil behind which all the secret was hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
     She flies over the city, laughing at the top of her voice and ignoring the frightened cries of the people below. She is not dressed as she normally is, wearing a dark dress of expensive fabrics embroidered with silver patterns all over the surface. Her bare feet barely touch the cool water as she passes the lake near their town, and it feels so real, so genuine, as if this isn't even a dream. A small house is seen up ahead, surrounded by grounds with a large garden with apple and pear trees in addition to flowers. Two servants, looking like shadows of themselves, with sunken eye sockets and dark circles under them, with wrinkled and trembling hands, meet her at the entrance to the house and escort her inside, treating her not as a guest but as a hostess, groveling like slaves. There, at the end of the corridor, she sees the entrance to the dining room with a large table in the middle, and at the opposite end of the table, Rio sees
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the servants, a man, immediately rushes over to the mistress of the house to fill her glass with something that looks very much like wine. She pays no attention to him and only stares, mesmerized, with all the warmth and softness she can muster, directly at Rio, who approaches her, taking her place at the table next to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My love, you were late today. Did something catch your eye in town? New blood?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Wait a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      My love?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      New blood?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tries to answer in her sleep, but she can't. She tries to wake up, but her eyes refuse to open, her body refuses to obey her brain, and her mouth can't make a sound. Instead, she feels something or
     <em>
      someone
     </em>
     lying on top of her, and there is a slight tugging pain running through her body like a current through her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh God
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      oh my fucking God
     </em>
     .
     <em>
      It's a sleep paralysis demon
     </em>
     . She's read about it in the papers. Or it's a succubus, which is bad as well. God, she's gonna die in her bed as a virgin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're not going to die in your bed, Rio. At least not because of me."
    </p>
    <p>
     She hears Agatha's voice next to her ear, at first glad that Agatha had come after all. Then she's scared, because it could only mean one thing - Agatha somehow mysteriously got into Rio's room, and
     <em>
      she was the reason
     </em>
     Rio felt paralyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Vampires can manipulate people's nervous systems. We can immobilize you to make it easier to drink blood. Now you can open your eyes and speak."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opens her eyes abruptly, feeling the weight of the woman's body on her thighs as she sits on top of her, her head tilted slightly in curiosity. Thin trickles of blood run from the corners of her lips and down her chin, and at the same moment, Rio feels a nagging pain in her shoulder. This woman...not only had she filled Rio's entire mind with thoughts of herself, most of which were far from holy, but she dared to take advantage of Rio's weakness and use it as a source of feeding.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What the hell are you do-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry, I couldn't resist," Agatha touches Rio's face before she can pull away. The vampire gently strokes the girl's cheek, guiltily widening her eyes and poking her bottom lip out. "I've been visiting you for weeks, waiting for you to know me, to be ready. And your dreams were filled with
     <em>
      so much desire
     </em>
     that I had to restrain myself every time so I wouldn't pounce. Although it didn't always work out."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wait, wait," Rio can't focus, her head is buzzing, and her body feels heavy and sluggish. "So, all those times I woke up exhausted, did you just drink blood out of me? And not only can you paralyze me to use me, but you can also read my mind? That's so unfair and dishonest."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I would
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     use you, Rio, I swear. Yes, I snapped, and I admit it, but I would never do anything else to you without your consent. If you tell me to leave and never come back, then I'll leave."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then why are you here?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Like I told you, I want to help you get out of here. The question is, do you want the same?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though Agatha speaks sincerely, Rio's heart is racing and ready to jump out of her chest because of everything at once: because of fear, because of unexpected developments of events, because of the anticipation of new possibilities. Her mind is spinning nonstop, twisting itself into a big ball and getting bigger with each new question. Is she ready to drop everything and change her quiet and gray life within the walls of the church for a new and unpredictable life? What would it be like to live with...a vampire? What would it even look like? Will she be human all her life, or could she be turned into a vampire?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just ask me. I know you're a curious little thing."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know, your mind-reading thing is really annoying," Rio sucks in her breath unhappily and folds her arms across her chest. Agatha, who is still sitting on top of her, perks up a little, shifting impatiently in anticipation of Rio's questions. The movement sends the kind of pulses that short-circuit Rio's mind and cause her to rock her hips upward in search of new contact. She sees a slight smirk on Agatha's lips, but Agatha tuts and shakes her head warningly. "Okay, let's go in order. Were you in my dreams?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The house outside of town belongs to you, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I can project some of my consciousness onto others."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you really have servants?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "They're worms," Agatha waves her hand, as if to metaphorically push away the thought of counting them as humans. "They're so old that if I ever decide to let them go, they'll die instantly without my control."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How old are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Two hundred and twenty-eight. Survived the Marseilles Plague as a vampire."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you only kill men? How exactly do you feed? Can a man become a vampire if you drink his blood?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can't help but laugh at the number of incessant questions that rain down on her with each new answer. Human curiosity, overenthusiasm, and the pursuit of knowledge about the unknown and mythical have always amazed and fascinated her. And that's what she liked most about Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     "As I said earlier, I only kill those that pose a danger to...my business. It is the men's fault for doing such foolish things that lead them to, let's say, logical consequences," a hint of pride can be heard in her voice, devoid of any shame or guilt. She wipes the traces of blood drying on her face with the pad of her thumb, licking away the remains. "I drink human blood, sometimes animal blood, depending on the circumstances. Most of the time, I leave my victims alive. Most often, they turn out to be women. Personal preference."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right," Rio swallows, tensing slightly. Agatha notices this, but doesn't react in any way, still remaining in her previous position. "So are you doing this out of necessity or just by choice?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Both, but more out of necessity, lest I lose my powers. You see, to this day, a witch hunt and all other evil is still popular, so abusing my powers could lead them to me, which I really don’t want to," she takes a pause and looks closely at Rio's face, who looks calm and interested. "And regarding your last question...Yes, I can turn a person if I drink all the blood from their body. Afterward, I have a few minutes to give the person my blood, and then the transformation process will start in the body. The sensation after waking up is similar to the state after a week-long hunger strike and a party with a lot of alcohol, where, in addition, you were beaten all over your body."
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite how absurd it all sounds, Rio laughs softly and raises herself on her elbows, accidentally exposing the shoulder where the fresh bite is visible. She doesn't miss the way  Agatha's pupils dilate at the sight of it, turning almost completely black.
     <em>
      Bingo
     </em>
     . If vampires have an advantage whereby they can manipulate humans, Rio finds a loophole to manipulate in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You are definitely not allowed to give public speeches promoting vampires. The consequences would be dire," says Rio, tilting her head to the side and exposing more bare skin, which immediately draws Agatha's full attention. Her pupils dilate again, darkening and casting a slightly red glow. Her fangs bite the lower lip so hard that it starts bleeding. "Theoretically, if I ever wanted to become a vampire, would you do it for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio..."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just imagine. Gaining complete control over my body. Draining me completely, savoring every sip of my warm blood, feeling my body heat and pulse on your lips..."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, don't tempt me," Agatha says warningly through gritted teeth. She tilts her head to the side and tenses every muscle in her body, trying not to listen to Rio and to hold her instincts back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then kiss me. I allow you."
    </p>
    <p>
     From Rio's lips, it sounds not like a request but an order, one that Agatha obeys instantly, as if it's been in her DNA since birth. She leans forward, running her tongue over Rio's lower lip and slowly deepening the kiss, and it feels like falling into the abyss and ascending to heaven at the same time. Like a newfound home, like the crumbling walls of a castle, like a newly built bridge to a favorite place. Even through the clothes, Agatha can feel the warmth of Rio's body. The way she smells the simplest things, like apples, baked bread, the smell of incense, and plain soap. The way she gasps when Agatha runs her tongue over a vein in her neck and gently bites the skin without tearing through it. All these little things drive Agatha crazy to the point of insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh God, help me..."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't mention his name, it's just you and me here."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Didn't think...shit," Rio stutters and gasps as she feels Agatha's hand slide under her nightgown, sliding down the inside of her thigh and lightly scratching her skin. "I didn't think you were the jealous type."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I take what I like and then-"
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside, the sound of shuffling feet and female voices mumbling in unison can be heard down the hall. A dim light shines through the thin gap between the door and the floor, revealing dark stripes of the shadows of the people behind the door. Agatha's hit-or-run reaction instinctively kicks in, reacting instantly to the turn of the knob and escaping through the window before she can be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      (How silly.)
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The nuns approach Rio cautiously, holding crosses and praying a hundred times to God to protect them. Rio resists the urge to roll her eyes or make some snarky comment and allows the wound on her shoulder to be treated. The sisters stay with her for a while, reciting protective prayers, and leave only when Rio turns away and falls asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     But instead, she lies with her eyes open for hours until sunrise, praying to her blue-eyed goddess not to leave her alone and to return as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      (And Agatha swears to herself that she'll fix everything.)
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The next day, Father Batiste and the other nuns leave Rio locked in her room all day after the night's incident, to protect her from being attacked again. In reality, though, their fear is written on their faces every time they look in her direction - they want to protect only themselves from danger, with absolutely no concern for Rio's safety.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Love your neighbor as you love yourself
     </em>
     . Yeah, they are unfamiliar with that.
    </p>
    <p>
     The day passes in agonizing anticipation. The images of last night keep reappearing in Rio's mind, tormenting her tense nerves even more. When the sun fills the sky with a glow and sets over the horizon, all senses are heightened and nerves are strained to the limit. A few minutes later, the wind from the open window intensifies and blows out all the candles in the room. Rio raises her head and comes to life at the sight of Agatha materializing. Agatha catches Rio with a smile slowly spreading across her face, sitting quietly on the bed, hugging her knees like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You came."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Couldn't leave you alone."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How noble of you," Rio chuckles sarcastically as Agatha takes slow steps toward her like a predator ready to attack its prey at any second.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anything for you, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifts herself on the bed, kneeling on her knees. She leisurely lifts the hem of her nightgown, raising it higher and higher, inch by inch, exposing her body and watching Agatha's fascinated and hungry gaze. She follows the trail from Rio's bare thighs, her waist, the top of her belly, and up to her breasts. The nightgown falls to the floor, making Rio feel vulnerable, but she doesn't lose her vigilance and control, watching every careful movement of Agatha, who moves even closer and ends up at the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me what you want, Rio," Agatha cups the girl’s cheek tenderly, towering over her like an all-merciful God, looking down at her with such adoration that it can be heard even in her dead heartbeat. "I will fulfill all your desires, even your darkest ones."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I want to feel you in every way possible. Your hands, your lips, your
     <em>
      fangs
     </em>
     ." Rio's hand slides over the buttons of Agatha's white blouse, slowly unbuttoning the top and revealing a view of her pale body in the moonlight. "I want you to be rough and soft at the same time. I want to know what it's like to desire someone so intensely that the sensation is imprinted on my mind and felt on my lips and tongue. I want to lose my mind and beg you. I want you to make me unable to think." The pause stretches longer than a couple of seconds. Agatha looks like she's ready to either destroy everything around her or give up and die if the pause lasts any longer. "
     <em>
      I want you to make me yours
     </em>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha holds her breath, her eyes darting wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your wish is my command."
    </p>
    <p>
     The vampire drops the girl onto the bed, hanging over her, grabbing her sides, and pulling her closer. Rio arches her back, feeling Agatha's weight on her shoulders as she leaves light and weightless kisses on her shoulders, moving lower and lower. She leaves wet trails and little hickeys on the inside of Rio's thighs, running her fingers over the soft skin and squeezing her buttocks in her hands with a little more pressure. Agatha slides her tongue between the folds, and Rio has to hold back a moan, instead letting out quiet sobs and whimpers. Even if people can't know what heaven feels like in a lifetime, at this moment, for Rio, it feels between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, not embarrassed at all by the sounds she makes, moans in pleasure as she slides her tongue over Rio's clit, entering it inside her cunt. She squeezes the buttocks harder with her fingers and repeats the movements with her tongue, making Rio relax more and more with each passing second. The saliva and lube get so much that the sheet gets soaked through, and it drives them both crazy. Agatha continues to suck Rio's clit and swirl her tongue around it, moving her palm closer to the entrance and gently stretching it with one finger, then the second, inserting them inside and swinging her hand back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside the door, just like the night before, there is a noise to which both women react, turning their heads sharply toward the source of the sound. And it's either a bad joke from God, or he clearly dislikes lesbians and has some personal score to settle, since this is the second time he's interfered, preventing them from making love.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha growls like a wild animal, saying with clenched and bared teeth, "No fucking way, not this time." Before she opens the door, she takes the form of a disembodied spirit surrounded by a black haze and veil, among which only bright red fierce eyes and a predatory mouth with snow-white teeth are visible. At the sight of the nuns with crosses and candles in their hands, an inhuman sound bursts out of the entity's mouth, reminiscent of a loud hiss mixed with a hum. The candles fall to the floor and extinguish, and the frightened nuns run as far away from the room as possible, with squeals and screams, which are undoubtedly joyful and give hope for a happy ending to the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha returns to her normal human form, slamming the door and turning around. She crosses the room in just a couple of steps, her face flashing a range of emotions - anger, despair, affection, and desire.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You. Are.
     <em>
      Mine
     </em>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     Well,
     <em>
      that's hot
     </em>
     . And no god can stop the wild attraction Rio feels at the mere sight of such an Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She helps Agatha get out of her stupid, fashionable flared pants and out of her stained white blouse, the bloodstains contrasting even more strongly against it. The underwear goes there as well, and Agatha sits on Rio's thigh, immediately giving herself away.
    </p>
    <p>
     "F-fuck, you sure this isn't a dream? So vampire physiology is no different from humans, right? Except for fangs and blood consumption."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You manage to ask silly questions even when you have a girl sitting on top of you, absolutely wet because of you, unbelievable."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smears a kiss somewhere on Rio's neck and breathes heavily as she rubs against Rio's thigh beneath her. Her fingers return downward, tracing circles around her cunt, warming up before she enters inside. At first, only the sound of rapid breathing is heard, eyes closed, Rio's fingers digging into the sheet, gathering in her fists a piece of fabric that's about to rip. As soon as Agatha changes angle and begins to speed up her movements, the sounds change to slightly audible sighs, Rio's mouth half-open, her eyes visibly rolling back. Agatha rests her hand on Rio's shoulder to hold herself in place, but Rio grabs Agatha's hand and moves it to her neck, holding and pressing harder, opening her eyes and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, they're definitely going to burn in hell together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha presses down on her throat enough to restrict her access to air, but the ability to breathe is still there. Rio opens her mouth again in a half-smile and reaches for Agatha's mouth with her other hand, running her thumb over her fangs. The vampire looks at her with a bit of confusion, asking the mute question '
     <em>
      can I?
     </em>
     ' and Rio nods affirmatively. The fang bites into the pad of the thumb, causing blood to trickle down the finger. Agatha licks and sucks it inside her mouth, chasing every bit of blood of
     <em>
      her human
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bite my palm," Rio commands again, and Agatha bites her palm just below her thumb, where the mount of Venus is located. More blood begins to flow down her hand. Rio screams in pain, which is offset by the pleasant sensation of fingers inside her. She takes a short break to catch her breath, then squeezes her wounded hand into a fist several times, driving more blood and smearing it, starting from the base of her neck and moving down along her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     (
     <em>
      All the vampire instincts inside Agatha are going wild and screaming for her to pounce right now. But she holds them back, waiting for permission like an obedient dog.
     </em>
     )
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come here. Take this, then take me," and Agatha rushes forward, licking the blood trail with all the zeal she has. "Take whatever you need from me. I allow it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulls away and swallows nervously in anticipation. "You give me permission to bite you whenever I want?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I give you permission to do anything," Rio moves her hips towards the fingers in pursuit of her pleasure, and moans when the fingers hit the right spot. "Fuck, just finish this and drink every last bit of me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Then everything becomes blurry, everything becomes too much. Agatha digs into Rio's neck, sucking blood, and a sharp pain shoots through Rio's entire body, paralyzing her for seconds. Waves of euphoria slowly begin to roll in, Rio moans mixed with curses and screams Agatha's name as she comes. Agatha pulls her fangs out of Rio's neck, licking the wound to make it heal faster, and thrusts her hips like a madwoman, pressing herself harder against the body beneath her. Then, sensing the impending release, Agatha sinks her lips into Rio's and moans contentedly as the warmth spreads with a pleasant shiver throughout her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though she doesn't have time to lie down and rest after such an intense exertion, she has a few moments to spend with Rio before she passes out. Rio looks exhausted, her face growing paler by the second, and Agatha bites down on her arm with her sharp fangs where the brachial artery is most accessible and easy to feed on. The vampire reaches out to the girl and presses the bite against her mouth, forcing Rio to drink the blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good girl, you've been so obedient and accepting," Rio doesn't react to the voice, her body working automatically and only intuitively continuing to suck in blood. "Now it's your turn to take everything I offer you. Drink, my love, drink."
    </p>
    <p>
     And just before Rio completely passes out and closes her eyes, she feels the weight of a body next to her. Agatha holds her hand, saying softly and gently, "It's okay, you need to get some rest. I'll be here for you. I'll always be here for you."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
     The first few minutes of waking up in the morning turn out to be bad.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, that's not the right word.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first few minutes of waking up in the morning turn out to be
     <em>
      horrible
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wakes up naked in an unfamiliar place under satin and undoubtedly expensive sheets with a hunger she's never felt before. Her body aches, barely moving, but pulsing with a powerful force that begs to break free. She can't feel her heartbeat, and her skin looks slightly paler than its usual tone. Her mind is foggy and out of control, and her head is splitting so badly that it's easier to put a bullet in her forehead than to survive this state. She runs her tongue over her teeth, feeling the tip of her fangs, which have grown longer and sharper, and with that movement, something activates in her body. Something so dangerous, uncontrollable, and animalistic that she can barely keep herself on the bed instead of running outside and finding the first person she sees to satisfy her hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Blood. Blood. Blood.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     This looping thought causes her body to react differently, so everything around her stops floating and spinning. She notices that the world seems brighter and clearer now. More colors. More smells. More details that were previously elusive to human hearing and sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Blood. I need blood.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, as if sensing or knowing that Rio could definitely do something stupid on her first day awake as a vampire, walks into the room with a tray, holding two elegantly decorated glasses and a pitcher. Rio's head spins again when she smells the familiar metallic scent of blood. Her body twitches involuntarily, and instead of adequate words, a low whimper comes out of her mouth. Agatha laughs knowingly at the sound and sits down on the edge of the bed, pouring the blood into glasses and handing one of them to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio can pounce on the food, Agatha looks at her just like she did in those dreams, caringly and tenderly. And all she says is,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning, my love. A new look suits you. Shall we have a feast?"
