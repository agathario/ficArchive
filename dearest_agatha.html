      <br/>
      What starts as an innocent prank escalates into unimaginable proportions, and Rio finds herself in a dilemma between keeping her secret identity and facing the emotional realities of her job.

     Mismatch

<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     Rio Vidal had one rule in life that she followed almost religiously: work enough to pay her bills and party hard enough to make a mess. At almost 30, she still hadn’t found anyone—man or woman—who made her want to abandon her friend’s company and the warm atmosphere of her favorite bar every Friday night.
    </p>
<p>
     In fact, Rio doubted such a person even existed.
    </p>
<p>
     So it was understandable the frustration she was feeling when, at 9:47 PM on a Friday, a notification from her friend popped up on her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “WHERE ARE YOU????” Jen didn’t hesitate to emphasize the question.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cast a tired glance at the stack of reports beside her, reaching almost at her shoulders, a mountain of obligations that seemed never to shrink. She worked at Harkness &amp; Calderu, one of the most respected law firms in New York City, a place where dreams were shaped and often shattered.
    </p>
<p>
     Part of her life philosophy was shaped by that environment. For years, she watched associates bend over backward, sleepless nights trying to become partners in the firm, many with their aspirations falling short of expectations. As a paralegal, she decided not to waste her youth stuck in a cubicle.
    </p>
<p>
     Well, that was what she had in mind. Her boss, Agatha Harkness, who owned half the company and was known for her stiffness, certainly had other plans.
    </p>
<p>
     “The witch has me under her spell,” she quickly replied to her friend’s message, a wry smile forming on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Witch” was an affectionate nickname Rio had given her boss, who clearly had no idea. And perhaps it was better that way.
    </p>
<p>
     On the other side of the office, through a glass door and under the only light on in the room, Agatha had her head buried in paperwork, as if the outside world didn’t exist. Even from behind several cubicles, Rio could see the woman’s silhouette.
    </p>
<p>
     “Vidal!” Agatha's voice reverberated through the room. “I need those reports right now.” She lifted her head, fixing her penetrating gaze on Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then you can do it yourself,” Rio shot back, almost inaudibly, her determination growing. She gathered half of the reports she had finished, walked discreetly to her boss's office, pushed the door open, and gently dumped the stack on the desk. “I’m beyond my working hours.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha placed her hands on her head, showing impatience, and leaned over the desk to face Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll pay you double for the overtime,” she offered, her tone impersonal as always.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t need the money.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sized her up with an inquisitive, almost disdainful look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, indignation clear on her face. She hated Agatha’s condescending and elitist attitude toward other employees.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure, and I’m also late for an appointment.”
    </p>
<p>
     The appointment in question was to get drunk on the highest-alcohol drink she could find at Road’s Bar, then dance around with the hottest person who crossed her path, and finally end the night on a high note, being carried home by her friends Jen and Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     She could still hear her boss shouting her name one last time, the voice echoing through the office, before crossing through the elevator doors.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Upon entering Road’s bar, a wave of warmth and laughter enveloped Rio like a cozy hug. With the music playing loudly, wide smiles and familiar faces made their way to Rio, and the everyday worries were left at the door. As soon as she spotted Jen and Alice sitting at a table near the bar, a broad smile spread across her face, wiping away any trace of accumulated stress.
    </p>
<p>
     “Finally!” Jen exclaimed, raising her beer glass as if toasting. The sparkle in her eyes was contagious. “You’re late, but better late than never!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, I was in an exciting meeting with the witch.” Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t help laughing at the look of anticipation on her friends’ faces. “What did I miss?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen, always the boldest of the group, leaned forward, almost bouncing in her seat with excitement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, just had the brightest idea of our lives!” She gestured dramatically. “Remember that nerdy phase of mine when I created a profile on a literary social network?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You were convinced you’d find the love of your life there,” Rio replied disinterestedly, as the waiter handed her a large glass of beer, which she immediately began to drink.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look who I found there!” Jen turned her phone screen around, revealing a profile of a woman they all knew very well: Agatha Harkness!
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t contain her laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     “No way!” She grabbed her friend’s phone for a closer look; it was definitely her boss.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s create a fake profile and mess with Agatha!” Jen practically screamed with excitement.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice, the most reserved and dedicated of the trio, was clearly uncomfortable with the idea.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, girls. That’s not exactly ethical; Agatha is our boss.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, come on, Alice!” Jen insisted, a mischievous glint in her eyes. “She needs a dose of lightness. Look how she buries herself in work all the time, we need to shake that witch up!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Alice, who seemed torn between loyalty to her boss and the idea of having fun. She knew Agatha was an inspiration for Alice, who lived and breathed law, but Jen’s look was persuasive.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re not going to hurt anyone; it’s just a bit of fun. Don’t you want to see Agatha laughing and enjoying herself at least once?” Rio interjected, trying to convince Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t see how this would be fun for Agatha, but she was sure it would give them good laughs.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s hesitation lasted only a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, but if this causes any trouble, I don’t want to be involved.”
    </p>
<p>
     The following hours passed in a whirlwind of laughter, drinks, and the creation of Ralph's profile. With photos of a generic model they found online and a biography filled with sarcasm and humor, the profile came to life before their eyes. Jen became the head writer while Rio provided the bolder ideas, and when they finally pressed “create account,” a collective shout of excitement echoed through the bar, drawing curious glances from other patrons.
    </p>
<p>
     The energy was in the air, and each drink they took seemed to intensify the excitement. The music was an invitation to dance, and in a moment of pure euphoria, Jen stood up and pulled Alice to dance. That space was a refuge, away from the pressure of the office and Agatha's severity.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had woke up with a headache. The weekend had been a blast of laughter and absurd moments, especially friday, but now it was time to face the monday morning.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as she arrived at the office, routine took over. The fluorescent lights and the sound of printers seemed even colder than before. But a notification on her phone made her stop. Agatha had accepted “Ralph’s” friend request. Adrenaline coursed through her body, mixing excitement with a twinge of nervousness. The thought of deceiving Agatha made her involuntarily smile, but the feeling quickly dissipated when she heard the sound of her boss's high heels.
    </p>
<p>
     “Conference room now, Vidal.” Agatha's tone was firm and the expression on her face left no room for questions.
    </p>
<p>
     Inside the room, a woman sat with tears in her eyes and an anxious expression on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is Ms. Sarah Proctor,” Agatha introduced the woman with a seriousness that made Rio’s heart tighten. “She’s facing a complicated lawsuit to gain custody of her daughter. Unfortunately, the deadline for submitting documents expired on friday night, which means the girl will remain under government custody until the end of the process.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's words echoed in Rio's mind, and her stomach twisted. Sarah began to cry, and each tear seemed to cut like a knife, revealing the pain and anguish she felt. It was clear that the woman was on the brink of an emotional collapse.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t even begin to express how sorry I am, Ms. Proctor. What I can guarantee is that my entire office, from the most renowned lawyer to the legal paralegal,” Agatha shot a quick glance at Rio, “will be dedicated to your daughter’s case.” Agatha's voice was firm, but her gaze betrayed a contained fragility.
    </p>
<p>
     As Sarah cried, Rio felt the weight of guilt accumulating in her chest. This situation reminded her of her own childhood, moments when despair and loneliness surrounded her in an orphanage that had never felt like home. She remembered the nights she dreamed of being taken in, of a place where she could feel safe and love. If only she had put in more hours on friday, maybe she could have made a difference in that woman’s life.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman tried to speak, her voice trembling and broken by tears, and Rio remembered how, in her childhood, she had witnessed mothers being separated from their children due to bureaucracies that seemed insurmountable. The feeling of helplessness consumed her, and she closed her eyes for a moment, wishing that the Sarah’s pain could somehow dissipate.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to Rio, her gaze assessing the young assistant with an intensity that made her uncomfortable.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going to stay here and listen. It’s important to understand the impact of our work,” she said in a piercing whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, but her head was in a different place, battling memories that threatened to overflow. What once seemed like an innocent prank now transformed into an unbearable weight. People’s lives were in their hands, and Rio had chosen to distract herself.
    </p>
<p>
     The meeting continued, but Rio could barely hear Agatha's words. Guilt consumed her, and at the same time, she couldn’t help but wonder what Agatha would think if she knew who was behind Ralph. The thought that her actions, made in a moment of fun, could have such serious consequences shook her deeply.
    </p>
<p>
     Sarah Proctor, with tear-swollen eyes, stood up.
    </p>
<p>
     “What am I going to do now?” the woman asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's voice was now choked with emotion.
    </p>
<p>
     “I will handle this, I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Will you?” The woman seemed incredulous. “The only reason I haven’t fired your office is that I’ve spent all my savings on this lawsuit.” She said before storming out of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I leave?” Rio asked in a whisper, her voice broken as she fought to keep the tears from streaming down her face.
    </p>
<p>
     As she left the room, frustration took over Rio. How could Agatha be so insensitive? She had forced her to watch the woman cry, and anger grew in her chest. Even knowing she was partially responsible for not putting in extra hours, it was hard to bear the disappointment in her boss's gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     The witch had taught a harsh lesson, but what irritated her more was the fact that while she felt guilt, she was also furious with Agatha for making her witness that situation. The image of Sarah would haunt her, and the memory of her childhood, which she had tried to leave behind, returned with devastating force.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon entering her cubicle, she caught another notification on her phone out of the corner of her eye. Agatha had sent a message to Ralph.
    </p>
<p>
     A devilish idea formed in her mind.
    </p>
<p>
</p>

     Dispute

<div>
<p>
     Rio hesitated for a moment before picking up her phone. Her hands trembled slightly as she unlocked the screen. The notification blinked, taunting her. With a deep breath, she opened Agatha's message to Ralph.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Hello, Ralph. Thank you for the friend request. Your profile intrigued me. Perhaps we can exchange some thoughts on literature when I have a free moment."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The message was formal, almost cold, exactly what Rio would expect from Agatha. But there was something more there, an opening, a small crack in the armor of the "witch." Rio felt a mix of emotions — guilt, anger, curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     Her fingers hovered over the virtual keyboard, hesitant. Part of her wanted to respond immediately, to seize this unique opportunity to see a different side of Agatha. Another part was terrified of the possible consequences.
    </p>
<p>
     At that moment, her phone vibrated again. It was Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey! Did the witch bite the bait?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip, indecisive. The events of the morning still weighed on her mind. But the temptation to dive into this new dynamic with Agatha was too strong.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes," she replied to Jen. "She just sent a message."
    </p>
<p>
     Almost instantly, Jen called.
    </p>
<p>
     "My God, Rio! This is amazing!" Jen's voice sounded excited on the other end. "What did she say? Come on, tell me everything!"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hesitated, feeling the weight of guilt once more.
    </p>
<p>
     "Jen, I don’t know if we should continue with this. Something happened this morning..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, don’t start with that now!" Jen interrupted. "Don’t tell me you’re afraid of that witch. It’s just an innocent little game."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed, remembering Sarah Proctor’s anguished face. But something inside her rebelled against the idea of giving up now. Maybe it was the anger she still felt towards Agatha for forcing her to witness that devastating scene.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe you’re right," Rio finally said, her voice low, "but let’s take it slow, okay? I don’t want this to spiral out of control."
    </p>
<p>
     "Sure, sure," Jen quickly replied, barely containing her excitement. "I need to get back to work before Lilia shows up, but keep me updated." She said before hanging up.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at the phone screen, rereading Agatha's message. Her fingers began to type almost on their own:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Hello, Agatha. I’m glad you accepted my request. I confess your profile caught my attention as well. How about we start talking about your favorite book?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She sent the message before she could change her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a few minutes to respond, which only heightened Rio's anxiety. She glanced over the cubicles to see if anyone was paying attention to her, but everyone was too busy with their respective work. Finally, the notification arrived.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I think it’s hard to choose just one, but currently, 'The Shadow of the Wind' by Carlos Ruiz Zafón has captivated my interest."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio frowned, surprised. It wasn't exactly the book choice she expected from Agatha. The girl didn’t consider herself a literature expert; that was her friend. Aside from The Hunger Games trilogy, Rio couldn’t remember the last time she had opened a book.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, it was with Evelyn Hugo, she suddenly remembered. She still couldn’t believe that woman was a work of fiction.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio quickly opened Google and typed in famous classic authors, trying to find something that would please Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     After spending a few minutes she found a name that seemed appropriate.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oh, 'The Shadow of the Wind' by Zafón is excellent! If you like dark mysteries, I’m sure you’ll also enjoy 'The Name of the Rose' by Umberto Eco. That book has a pretty sinister atmosphere, and the way Eco blends religion, philosophy, and suspense is incredible."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had no idea what she had just typed, but she felt smart enough to maintain a conversation with Agatha Harkness for more than five minutes. A smug smile spread across her face.
    </p>
<p>
     She heard her boss calling her impatiently from the other side of the room, she closed her eyes for a second, and cursed. Rio wanted to keep talking to her... boss.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Unconsciously, as the days passed, Rio found herself listing and buying all the books Agatha mentioned during their conversations. They were starting to spend hours talking late into the night, and Rio didn’t want to be caught off guard.
    </p>
<p>
     Thanks to one of her late-night chats pretending to be Ralph, Rio was late to court the next day, which left Agatha on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can’t believe this, Vidal." Agatha whispered nervously as they hurried through the place, trying to find where the session would be. "With Ms. Proctor again, don’t you have any responsibility?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Sorry, I..." Before Rio could finish her sentence, her feet stumbled over themselves, sending her and all the case documents crashing to the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bent down to help her pick up the papers, but when her hand closed around the book Rio was reading, the younger woman froze in fear.
    </p>
<p>
     "You read Carlos Zafón." Agatha recognized with a smile on her face, something Rio had never seen in her expression before, at least not directed at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I-I... I just started." Rio stammered in response, but managed to finish the sentence.
    </p>
<p>
     "It’s very impressive; you’ll like it." Agatha raised her hand and tucked a strand of the girl’s hair behind her ear, sending an involuntary shiver down Rio’s spine. "Come on, we’re already late."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still recovering from Agatha's unexpected gesture, her heart racing as she stood up. Her face flushed, a mix of embarrassment and another feeling she couldn’t quite identify.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, right," she replied, trying to keep her voice steady.
    </p>
<p>
     They walked quickly toward the courtroom, Rio still feeling that shiver coursing through her from Agatha’s brief touch. She took a deep breath, trying to compose herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Since this was a parental dispute, it didn’t occur in a traditional courtroom but rather in a more intimate space where parents and children could feel comfortable. Which Agatha soon realized wasn’t possible, as the other party's lawyer was making absurd demands.
    </p>
<p>
     The atmosphere was tense, and she could sense the frustration in Agatha’s voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "Judge, my client is a librarian. Asking for half her salary as alimony is absurd!" Agatha countered, trying to keep calm.
    </p>
<p>
     The other lawyer smiled, almost as if he was enjoying the fight. That was enough to ignite a fire within her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I agree." The judge tried to calm the atmosphere. "Both of you meet with your clients and present a new proposal next week. You are dismissed."
    </p>
<p>
     As they left the courtroom, Sarah looked despondent; she and Rio stepped away from Agatha, who was shouting at someone on the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sarah, you need to remember this isn’t about your daughter." The woman raised an eyebrow, silently questioning Rio. "I can’t imagine your pain at being separated from her, but in a dispute like this, it’s rarely about the child. Men use their children to hurt mothers all the time; it’s systematic. You can’t let him get to you."
    </p>
<p>
     "I know," Sarah said through gritted teeth, "it’s just that... It’s hard not to see this situation as an attack on my motherhood. She’s the most important person in my life; she means everything to me."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed, feeling the tension in the air. She wanted to comfort her client, but didn’t know how.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sarah," Agatha interrupted them, still on the phone, "I managed to get a temporary injunction; you’ll be able to visit your daughter this weekend."
    </p>
<p>
     The woman’s face lit up with happiness. She rushed to hug Agatha, but the woman didn’t seem to know how to respond to that kind of affection. Rio almost laughed at the situation but remembered that Agatha was stillher boss. Sarah bid them farewell and left, nearly skipping down the busy street.
    </p>
<p>
     "How did you manage that?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I called in a few favors. Last year, I got the son of the president of the child protection council out of a DUI charge." Rio stared at her, impressed. A boy of no more than 14 ran past them, causing Agatha to stumble back. "Watch out, you brat!" Agatha yelled, but the boy had already vanished into the crowd. She fumbled in her pockets for something, and an expression of anger crossed her face. "He stole my phone! He fucking stole my phone!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Um..." Rio stammered, unsure of what to do. "Do you want me to go after him?"
    </p>
<p>
     "No, Vidal!" Agatha shouted irritably. "Can this shit day get any worse?"

<p>
     The police station was a blur of fluorescent lights and brick-colored walls as Agatha crossed the entrance gate. Even though she was familiar with the place due to her work, today she had a different purpose. Her boots echoed down the empty hallway as she walked toward the filing area, where the officer who had called her was waiting.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes scanned the counter in search of Mr. Hart, an elderly man with gray hair who had dedicated his life to the police force. He and his wife, Mrs. Hart, a friendly social worker, had helped Agatha with countless cases over the years involving battles against the abusive adoption system of the United States.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I’m here!” Mr. Hart stood up from a table at the back of the station, slowly shuffled to the counter, and greeted her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mr. Hart, how are you and your wife?” Agatha asked politely, but as the man began to speak, her gaze was drawn to a solitary figure handcuffed to a bench in the corner of the room. It was a boy with dark hair, wearing dusty clothes and a tired expression. “Is that the boy who stole my phone yesterday?”
    </p>
<p>
     Mr. Hart nodded, furrowing his brow as he looked at the lonely boy.
    </p>
<p>
     “His name is Nicholas Scratch, that’s what he told the police. In fact, it was my wife who recognized him when he was arrested trying to steal another phone this morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     She looked at the boy, who seemed so small sitting on the bench, even though he was taller than average for his age.
    </p>
<p>
     “He looks so young,” Agatha lamented.
    </p>
<p>
     Mr. Hart rummaged under the counter, pulled out a phone in a sealed package, and slid it across the surface to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I believe this is yours.” The man leaned in, looking around nervously as if to see if anyone other than Agatha could hear him. “I need to ask, do you intend to press charges?” Mr. Hart pulled out a file and opened it, revealing a picture of a young child, probably Nicholas. “He’s only fourteen, Agatha. He’s been in the system his whole life, seven different foster homes. His mother is an addict, and his father has never been in contact.”
    </p>
<p>
     Mr. Hart let out a frustrated sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     “C-Can I talk to him?” Agatha asked bitterly, her eyes never leaving the boy. “Alone, I mean.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, I’ll put you in one of the interrogation rooms.”
    </p>
<p>
     Mr. Hart nodded toward the blue door from which they could be led to one of the rooms, then he stood up to fetch the boy, who now had tears sliding down his face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha followed him to the room, opened the door, and sat across from Nicholas.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are the handcuffs really necessary?” Agatha asked, pointing to the boy’s wrists. “You just said, he’s only fourteen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Mr. Hart removed Nicholas's handcuffs, but not without a nearly inaudible complaint about protocol, and then left the two alone.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas rubbed his wrists, his face contorting as he struggled against the emotions threatening to spill over, but he desperately tried to keep them under control. Agatha watched him in silence for a moment, trying to imagine him without the dirt and the weary expression. Her gaze locked onto his eyes again.
    </p>
<p>
     “What made you steal my phone, Nicholas?”
    </p>
<p>
     He fidgeted in his chair, glancing over Agatha’s shoulder and pointing to the mirror on the wall.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is someone watching us behind that glass? Like in those police tv shows?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled softly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I asked Mr. Hart for privacy, so no. No one is watching us.” She opened the file containing Nicholas's history and pushed it toward him. “This isn’t the first time you’ve been caught for theft.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I needed the money.” Nicholas shrugged and fixed his gaze on a blank corner of the wall, avoiding looking at his own picture. “I was hungry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned as the boy confessed, but she couldn’t deny that the circumstances surrounding his actions were more than justifiable.
    </p>
<p>
     “How long have you been running from the system?” she asked gently.
    </p>
<p>
     The boy shifted his gaze between the wall and Agatha, almost as if deciding how much he could trust her. He wiped away a few persistent tears that had rolled down his face, and his voice was just a broken whisper when he finally spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     “Since I can remember.” Nicholas leaned over the table and pulled the file, flipping through his history until he found what he was looking for and pointed to his first adoption. “This couple here, they were the first ones who adopted me. I was… five years old, I think. Their house was cozy, it smelled like vanilla and cinnamon. Everyone said how lucky I was to be adopted so quickly, that the Millers couldn’t have children and were a great couple. For a few months, it was just the three of us, but then the woman got pregnant and they send me back.” Nicholas ran his finger over the pages of adoptions. “Then I was pushed from one temporary home to another; those are the worst. Too many kids, not enough food. And the parents usually just want the government check.” He slammed the file shut in anger and pushed it back to Agatha. “Now they say I’m too old and nobody wants me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s stomach churned at his story. She looked at Nicholas now and couldn’t understand how anyone in the world wouldn’t want to raise that boy, or maybe it was just her instincts talking. She had spent years trying to save a failing marriage, even as her ex-wife categorically denied wanting children. It was even more painful to see Wanda in her new life, with the man for whom she had left Agatha, pregnant with twins.
    </p>
<p>
     She took a deep breath and rested her chin on one hand, her eyes studying the child in front of her, her mind racing as always, trying to find a solution to the problem before her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not going to press charges, Nicholas.”
    </p>
<p>
     The boy tried to maintain an indifferent posture, but it was impossible not to smile when he heard Agatha’s words.
    </p>
<p>
     “But I need you to promise me one thing.” Agatha pointed to the file and looked directly into Nicholas’s eyes. “I’m going to contact a great social worker, and she will find you a decent temporary home. I know you’ve had horrible experiences, but I need you to trust me on this. Just as I’m going to trust that you won’t run away again,”—she took her phone out of her pocket and showed it to the boy—“and that you won’t get into trouble again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas seemed hesitant, as if he had been disappointed so many times that he barely allowed himself to hope for something better. Weighing the pros and cons, trusting Agatha seemed his only option.
    </p>
<p>
     “I promise I won’t run away again, and I’ll stay out of trouble.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt her heart ache for that young child, so worn out by life. She was determined to help him.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio checked her phone every five minutes, just to reassure herself that no new notifications had come in. Her online relationship with her boss had stagnated; they had barely exchanged messages, and Rio was starting to miss the woman more than she wanted to admit. Throughout the week, Agatha had been more irritable than usual, leaving everyone in the office on edge.
    </p>
<p>
     When the older woman practically dashed between the cubicles toward her office, Rio quickly followed and stepped inside before Agatha finished closing the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve sorted out all the details for the visit between Miss Proctor and her daughter; they’re meeting tomorrow,” Rio said with a hint of pride. “And I see you got a new phone, great.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I recovered the old one,” Agatha said while taking off her blazer, not sparing a glance for Rio. “What are you still doing here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I… N-Nothing, Ms. Harkness.” Rio turned her back and mentally cursed Agatha, but before she could cross the door, she heard her boss call her name.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait. I have something for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Their eyes met, making Rio’s heart skip a beat. She approached her boss’s desk with a broad smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “F-For me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “F-For me.” Agatha mockingly imitated Rio’s voice, eliciting a nervous laugh from the woman. “Yes, for you.” Agatha opened her bag and pulled out a copy of ‘The Name of the Rose.’ “If you liked Carlos Ruiz Zafón, you’ll enjoy Umberto Eco.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help but smile at the irony. Her own online alter ego had recommended that book to her boss, and now fate was weaving a dangerous game between the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure I’ll like it, Ms. Harkness.”

<div>
<p>
     Rio's head was buried in a book, squinting to see the small letters as she took sips from her cold beer. Her attention only briefly drifted to her phone on the counter, where her conversation with her boss was open, and she was anxiously waiting for a reply. For the first time since she started going to Road's bar, Rio wasn't absorbed by the loud music and the intoxicating presence of people dancing.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was sitting next to her, looking miserable as she stared at Jen on the dance floor, wrapped up with a stranger.
    </p>
<p>
     "You should stop being such a coward," Rio said, glancing quickly at her friend. "Just ask her out; the worst that can happen is she’ll say no."
    </p>
<p>
     Alice let out a long sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     "Or I could be humiliated, she might never talk to me again, and I’d completely ruin our friendship."
    </p>
<p>
     "You're so dramatic."
    </p>
<p>
     "What are you doing, anyway?" Alice turned her head and grabbed Rio's phone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nothing! Give it back!" Rio tried to snatch her phone from her friend, but at that moment, a notification from Agatha popped up on the screen.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio quickly grabbed the phone, a mischievous smile spreading across her face. She opened her boss's message and let out a quiet laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "What did she say?" Alice asked, curious.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her phone and showed a picture Agatha had just sent: a table with various cheeses and a half-filled glass of wine. In the background, you could see the upholstery of a black leather sofa, with what looked like the beginning of a painting on top. This little detail made Rio's heart skip a beat. Was it Agatha's house? Or was she at a friend's place?
    </p>
<p>
     A simple message underneath read:
     <em>
      "I think I deserve this after today."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "You and Agatha are already exchanging pics?" Jen surprised them, finally leaving the dance floor to join her friends.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha and Ralph are exchanging pics." Alice reminded her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged, ignoring her friend's comment. It was clear that she and Agatha were getting closer, even if her boss didn't know her true identity. She pushed her beer and another full bottle to the center of the counter and took a picture, sending it to the woman.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Guys' night out."
     </em>
     said the message.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's response was almost immediate.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Are you at Road's bar?? It's right across from my office!"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio felt a cold shiver run through her body, and her expression quickly shifted to panic.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re so fucking stupid, Rio.” Jen pointed to the beer photo, where the napkin with the bar's logo was visible in the corner.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Want to meet up?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Another message from Agatha. Rio's breathing started to quicken, and the bar around her seemed to spin.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do I do? What do I do?” she asked desperately, pushing the phone toward Jen as if she wanted to escape the situation. “You answer it; this was all your idea.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t put this on me, Vidal.” Jen pushed the phone back to her friend. “It was a joke, and now you’re acting like a teenager in love with her teacher.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not in love with Agatha Harkness!” Rio exclaimed angrily.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen grabbed Rio’s book and shook it in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You're even reading the woman’s recommendations.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s actually a great book. And she recommended it; what was I supposed to say? No?” She looked at her phone again and saw Agatha’s photo with three dots underneath, meaning the woman was typing something. She quickly put her phone on airplane mode and tucked it into her bag. “Done, that problem doesn’t exist anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t just pretend it doesn’t exist.” Alice pointed out, frowning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, you’re just delaying the inevitable.” Jen agreed, taking a sip of her beer.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a frustrated sigh, finished her beer, and left her friends behind as she headed to the dance floor to distract herself.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Throughout the next week, Agatha was a bundle of nerves, terrorizing her coworkers. Whether it was due to the Proctor case stress, her worry about Nicholas, or the lack of messages from Ralph, she wasn’t quite sure.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t until her business partner and friend Lilia Calderu pulled her into an empty conference room that she finally let out a heavy breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s going on with you?” Lilia asked as she closed the door. Agatha was sitting at the end of the table, her head in her hands and looking exhausted. “You’re starting to live up to that Witch nickname.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who's calling me a Witch?” she asked sharply, but seeing the authoritative look from the older woman, she relaxed her shoulders and slumped back down. “Maybe I overreacted a little.” Agatha murmured, massaging her temples.
    </p>
<p>
     “A little? Five minutes ago, you were yelling at Rio Vidal for making a typo.” Lilia sat down next to her, and Agatha lifted her head to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m just going through a stressful period.” Agatha sighed, resting her elbows on the table. “I met this guy online; his name is Ralph.” She pulled her phone from her pocket and showed a picture of a tall, blonde guy with brown eyes and a scruffy beard. “We have a lot in common, and we’ve been chatting for a while.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s good; it means you’re finally moving on from Wand...”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t say that name!” Agatha interrupted her, irritated. “Anyway, last Friday he sent me a picture of a bar, and I realized it was really close to here. So, I suggested we meet...”
    </p>
<p>
     “And then he disappeared.” Lilia finished for her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly.” Agatha grumbled, feeling defeated. “And I’m a complete idiot for getting excited.” Over Lilia’s shoulder, she could see Rio working furiously at her cubicle. She watched the girl for a few seconds before turning her attention back to her friend. “I can’t understand what I did wrong.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe he just got scared, Agatha. Or he’s busy; didn’t you say he’s also a lawyer?” The woman nodded silently as she let her friend ramble. “Or maybe he’s married, has two kids, and lives off fleeting online romances. Or he could be a criminal wanted by the FBI, and when you messaged him, he got arrested.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re getting senile, Lilia.” The two burst into loud laughter that echoed through the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now seriously, I’m glad you’re giving yourself a chance to meet new people. And if it’s not with this guy, it will be with someone else.” Lilia leaned in and whispered. “It could even be with that assistant of yours who practically drools every time you walk by.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed at Lilia’s comment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t say absurdities” she replied, even though a blush had crept into her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Isn’t it true?” Lilia raised an eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     “I gave her a book last week, and the girl practically trembled.” Agatha whispered back excitedly. She had never noticed Rio that way, but now it seemed a new possibility had opened up.
    </p>
<p>
     The two friends parted with laughter and smiles; Agatha’s mood had improved considerably after talking with Lilia. She walked calmly to Rio’s cubicle and leaned in to speak with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry for yelling at you over a typo.” Agatha said with a small smile on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to look at Agatha, her brown eyes wide with surprise.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t worry, I know you’re under a lot of pressure.” She replied, a hesitant smile appearing on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but notice her — the way the dark hair fell over her face, the blush on her cheeks, and how her eyes blinked nervously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you enjoying the book?” Agatha pointed to the book on Rio’s desk that she had given her earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s gaze drifted to the book, and her blush deepened.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, yeah... it’s great.” She murmured, touching the spine of the book with her fingertips. “I couldn’t stop reading.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s good.” Agatha said, feeling a strange satisfaction after seeing the young woman’s reaction. She leaned against the edge of the desk, looking at Rio intently. “I was wondering if you could stay a bit later tomorrow; I’ll, of course, pay for the extra hours. I need help with the Sarah Proctor case before we go back to court.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure, I can stay late.” She replied, trying to maintain eye contact with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a date then.” The older woman said before walking back to her office.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t exactly a lie; Agatha indeed needed help with the Proctor case. But Lilia had planted an idea in her head, and she was determined to see how far she could take it.
    </p>

<p>
     The office was calm and empty, only occasional silence interrupted by the sound of Agatha or Rio's keyboard clicks. It was late, and the two shared the boss's office while working on the case.
    </p>
<p>
     “Check this out.” Rio leaned over the desk and pushed the laptop screen toward Agatha. She leaned slightly next to her boss, her hair brushing against the woman’s face. “What do you think? I found this on one of his friend’s Instagram.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced at a photo of Sarah Proctor's ex-husband with his arm around an unknown woman, her eyes narrowing with interest. Rio watched her expectantly, as if waiting for her boss to draw conclusions.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you think he has a girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     “If he does and didn’t mention it in the case, it’s a flaw you can exploit.” Rio gave a small, proud smile, as if she had solved the problem. “Everyone involved in the child's life must be mentioned in the case and heard by the judge. If he has a girlfriend and didn’t bring it up, just mentioning it could help Sarah win custody.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tucked a strand of Rio's hair behind her ear, drawing the younger woman's gaze to hers. Noticing the closeness between them, Rio pulled back and sat down again on the other side of the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe you’re right, but we’ll need to prove it.” Agatha grabbed her phone and sent a quick message that Rio couldn’t snoop on. “I know a great private investigator, Jessica Jones; she’ll get us what we need.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to ignore the heat still rising in her cheeks after the unexpected closeness. She stared at the computer screen, pretending to concentrate on the case. However, her heart still thudded against her ribs, an involuntary reflection of Agatha's touch.
    </p>
<p>
     “And is this private investigator reliable?” she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a sarcastic smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “For the right price, yes.” Agatha silently moved to the other side of the desk and leaned against the edge, facing Rio. Her gaze softened each time she got closer to the woman. “You have a natural talent; why didn’t you become a lawyer?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's proximity made Rio's heart race. She quickly looked away, refocusing on the papers in front of her. Memories of her college days resurfaced, and she cleared her throat to speak.
    </p>
<p>
     “I started in law school,” Rio nervously fidgeted with her hands. The quiet atmosphere and Agatha’s closeness, along with the woman’s intoxicating perfume, made Rio increasingly anxious. “But I didn’t have a support system back then. As time went on and subjects piled up, I started to struggle, and my grades dropped. So I decided to switch to an easier course.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched Rio with a mix of curiosity and empathy as she shared a vulnerable piece of her story. She stepped closer, her knees gently touching Rio's. She brought her fingertips to the woman’s chin, lifting her head to make her look up.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think you’d be a great lawyer.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn't think clearly, her mind a tangle of sensations; her stomach churned with nervousness, and another shiver ran down her spine. Instinctively, she placed her hands on Agatha’s waist and slowly rose to face the woman. She was a few inches taller, yet she felt completely out of control.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe I would...” Her voice came out as barely a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     The tension hung between them like a charged cloud of static electricity. Rio stood frozen, her mind in conflict while their bodies remained close. Her hands rested on Agatha’s slender waist, feeling the firmness of her body beneath her touch.
    </p>
<p>
     It was impossible to deny the attraction simmering between them, but the awareness of their positions in the company and the potential consequences weighed heavily on their decisions.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed her eyes and let her hands slide to the back of Rio's neck, pulling the woman closer. She felt Rio's breath against her face and gently brushed the tip of her nose against the younger woman's cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should stop,” Agatha murmured against Rio's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio remained still under Agatha's touch, feeling the radiant heat at every point of contact between their bodies. Agatha's low voice lingered between them, heavy with reason and desire. The word "should" echoed in Rio's ears, laden with conflicting meanings, yet neither of them moved.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned in slowly and captured Agatha's mouth in a soft kiss. Their lips touched delicately, exploring each other's texture. Agatha's palms found their way to Rio's back, pressing her closer, both yearning for more contact.
    </p>
<p>
     In the intoxicating heat of the kiss, Agatha felt the world around her fade away. Every point of contact with Rio's body felt like a spark of energy. Logic and reason dissipated, drowned in the whirlwind of emotions bubbling between them.
    </p>
<p>
     Desire hung in the air, tangible, though wrapped in a thin layer of reason that threatened to break at any moment. The kiss lingered until they both gasp for air. Agatha pulled back just enough to look into Rio's eyes, her expression still filled with longing.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is wrong; I’m your boss.” She tried to find logic amidst her conflicting emotions, but her wavering voice betrayed her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio remained unfazed, her lips curling into a mischievous smile. Her hands stayed firmly on Agatha's waist, pulling her close again. The space between them seemed to shrink even further, charged with anticipation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, so you’re saying you didn’t like it?” Rio teased, subtly arching an eyebrow in a challenging gesture. Her eyes narrowed as she watched her boss with a mix of sarcasm and attraction.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gripped Rio's shirt tightly, allowing herself to be swayed by the woman’s provocation. She slid her lips over Rio’s for another kiss, this one more intense and passionate than the last.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The next day, Rio woke up feeling especially cheerful. Her breakfast seemed tastier, the colors were more vibrant, and people seemed friendlier. She made it a point to greet everyone she crossed paths with on her way to the office, from the market guy near her apartment to her other boss, Lilia Calderu.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good morning, Mrs. Calderu!” Rio exclaimed as she stepped out of the elevator, startling the woman and making her jump in surprise.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, Vidal. Good morning; you seem cheerful,” the woman said as she tried to compose herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio balanced two cups of coffee in one hand while holding her phone in the other.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, yes. Do you know if Miss Harkness has arrived? I brought her coffee.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Lilia stretched out her arm and grabbed one of the cups, taking a long sip. “But I’ll be keeping this.” She said before heading towards her office.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t let it bother her; the confident smile still on her face. She would just buy another coffee for her boss. She had kissed Agatha Harkness not just once, but twice the night before. Nothing could stand in her way.
    </p>
<p>
     That was until she got to her cubicle and found Jen, her best friend, comfortably seated at the computer while typing something.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?” Rio asked as she dropped her things on the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     “I apologized to Agatha.” Jen replied confidently while pointing to Ralph's profile open on the homepage.
    </p>
<p>
     “No! No, no, no, no.” Rio quickly approached and pushed Jen's chair, making her slide to the side. “What did you do, Jennifer Kale?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I apologized to Agatha on your behalf, of course. Or rather, on Ralph’s behalf.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Hello, Agatha. I want to apologize for my disappearance; I was on a business trip and ended up not having time to check my social media. Actually, I know the Road’s bar, but the photo I was in was from the same branch on another state, which is why the napkin looked the same.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio read the message twice to see if she really understood.
    </p>
<p>
     “What the hell, Jennifer. I don’t want to do this anymore.” She pointed angrily at the screen. “Something happened yesterday that changed everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Jen asked curiously, leaning closer to the desk again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio assessed her friend from head to toe, unsure if she could trust her with what had happened with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     As much as Rio loved spending hours discussing the books she was reading with Agatha, she didn’t want to do that through lies and a fake profile anymore. There was an opportunity to know Agatha genuinely.
    </p>
<p>
     “Get lost, Jen. I’m not talking about this right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     She pushed her friend out of the cubicle and watched her leave for the other side of the office, grumbling. She glanced quickly at her boss’s office and noticed it was still empty.
    </p>
<p>
     That was strange. Agatha was never late.
    </p>

<p>
     Agatha tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. She groped the mattress beside her and found the naked woman asleep. She let out an irritated sigh and pushed the blankets and the girl to the floor, who fell with a loud thud.
    </p>
<p>
     "Dammit, Harkness!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Why are you still here, Jones?" Agatha asked, annoyed. She didn’t like having other people in her apartment, especially Jessica Jones, who only showed up for business or pleasure. In this case, both. She got up, not caring about the cold wind hitting her body, grabbed the robe that had fallen on the floor, and wrapped it around herself. "You never stay the night."
    </p>
<p>
     "Forgive me for being tired after chasing your client's husband." Jessica quickly got dressed and prepared to leave. "I sent the photos to your email; it should be enough to win the case."
    </p>
<p>
     "The payment will be in your account by morning."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched as Jessica left the apartment. When she finally found herself alone, she grabbed her phone to check for any new messages from Ralph, but there was nothing. She had decided to give the guy another chance to talk, but only because they had hit it off so well at first.
    </p>
<p>
     She ignored two messages from Rio: one asking about the kiss they had shared in the office and another wondering if Agatha would show up for the court meeting about the Proctor case the next day. She rolled her eyes indignantly; of course she would attend. She had been avoiding the office for the past two days simply because she didn’t want to run into Rio and admit that the assistant had awakened something new in her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened the chat with Ralph and started typing.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm in a literary slump; do you have any recommendations?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She sat on the bed and bit her lip while looking at her phone with anticipation.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It depends on what you want to read. Do you prefer something light and fun, or something darker and mysterious?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     As she typed her next message full of hope, Agatha couldn’t help but think of Rio and the warmth of her lips against hers.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Actually, I'm in the mood for a romance."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She pressed send and closed the conversation, quickly opening Rio's Instagram afterward. She scrolled through various photos of her assistant; some she recognized the places and people—two women who also worked at the office. But the photo that really caught her attention was of Rio with her arm around the neck of a blonde. The caption with the woman's name was accompanied by a heart emoji.
    </p>
<p>
     "Who is Abby, huh?" Agatha wondered to herself.
    </p>
<p>
     A new notification appeared. Ralph's message came surprisingly fast, as if he were also eager to talk.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Is there a type of romance that makes you especially comfortable? Something that stirs those feelings you love to experience..."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Before she could consider anything, a new image of Rio popped into her mind. She remembered that laugh, that teasing look, and began to question if reading a romance was really the best idea.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Reconsidering, it's better if I read a comedy."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She sent the message and went back to scrolling through Rio’s photos on Instagram. Her curiosity about this Abby grew with the frequency of the girl in her assistant's feed.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why are there so many photos together?" Agatha wondered, frowning. She had exactly three photos on her private account: one in front of the Eiffel Tower after a romantic trip with Wanda, in which she had cropped out her ex-wife; one with her best friend Lilia Calderu in front of the office logo; and another of a horse named Little Sebastian, whom she had adopted and lived in a farm in New Hampton.
    </p>
<p>
     In Agatha's mind, there was no reason for so many pictures together unless they were dating. The idea that Rio could have someone in her life disturbed Agatha more than she was willing to admit. The image of another person touching Rio's warm, smooth skin, kissing her soft lips, caressing her hair irritated her deeply.
    </p>
<p>
     She opened the assistant's chat for a few seconds, debating whether she should send something. Fortunately, a new message from Ralph distracted her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Are you sure? I recently started reading 'The Price of Salt' by Patricia Highsmith. I think you’d love it."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned slightly and replied. She had read a synopsis of the book but had never actually read it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I didn’t expect that recommendation from a straight man."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Ralph's next message made Agatha smile slightly and forget about Rio for a moment; it had been a long time since she felt comfortable talking to a man.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Let’s not get stuck on stereotypes, right? A good book is a good book. Besides, it's much more than just a simple romance. It's a story of suspense and intrigue, with many psychological twists. And the author is brilliant in character development."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Before she could reply, another notification came in. This time from Rio, as if the woman could sense that Agatha was awake at this hour of the night, wanting to confirm if they would meet at court.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha locked her phone and lay back down, pulling the covers over her and wrapping herself up in an attempt hide from the outside world. That exchange between Rio and Ralph was starting to mess with her head.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     During the entire court session, Rio sat impatiently next to Agatha while the woman solemnly ignored her. She knew she should focus on the case, on Sarah's satisfied smile as Agatha tore apart the competition's lawyer, on the fact that the detective had proven to be more than competent and had gotten exactly what they needed to win the custody battle.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio struggled to keep her attention on the trial, but her thoughts were elsewhere. Agatha's formal attire, the determined look on her face—everything served only to distract Rio even more. The tight skirt Agatha wore accentuated every curve of her body, almost too tempting to ignore. She felt her irritation grow at how her boss seemed completely immune to the whole situation.
    </p>
<p>
     A shrill scream caught her attention when Sarah Proctor's daughter ran into the room to hug her mother after custody was granted to the woman. Rio watched the satisfied smile on her boss’s face, and it was impossible for emotion not to wash over her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don’t even know how to thank you, Ms. Harkness," Sarah said, her voice thick with emotion.
    </p>
<p>
     "I just did my job." Agatha said with a faint smile; she still seemed oblivious to the presence of her assistant.
    </p>
<p>
     "And you, Rio, thank you so much." She hugged Rio enthusiastically, who reciprocated just as warmly.
    </p>
<p>
     They said goodbye to the client, and gradually the room emptied, leaving the two women alone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you going to acknowledge my existence now?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at her with her cold, calculating gaze. She remained silent for a moment, seemingly choosing her words carefully.
    </p>
<p>
     "You went above and beyond in the Proctor case, Vidal," she finally said, there was something resembling approval in her voice, though it was hidden behind her characteristic seriousness. "Congratulations."
    </p>
<p>
     "That’s not what I want to talk about," Rio shot back, annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow and looked at her incredulously, moving threateningly closer to the assistant.
    </p>
<p>
     "You spent the entire session staring at my legs when you should have been paying attention." Agatha brought her index finger to Rio’s forehead and gave it a little tap. "You could have been learning something useful instead of undressing me with your eyes."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let a sarcastic laugh escape her lips. She was good at irritating her boss, and that was exactly what she intended to do. She lightly pushed Agatha's body against the desk and wrapped her hands around the woman’s slim waist, making Agatha tremble at her touch.
    </p>
<p>
     "You can't ignore how I make you feel, Agatha," she whispered gently against her boss's ear.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stayed still for a moment; her breath caught as she felt Rio's hand tracing circles on her waist. Although she tried to keep her out of her mind, the young woman’s presence affected her deeply.
    </p>
<p>
     "Stop it, Vidal..." Agatha murmured, but she couldn’t muster the strength to push the assistant away.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can’t. It’s too late," Rio said in a teasing tone, as she leaned her face closer to Agatha’s. She could feel her boss’s warm breath against her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed hard, trying to maintain her composure. Her mind told her to stop, but Rio's touch was like a spell she couldn’t resist. She gathered the little sanity she had left and pushed the assistant away.
    </p>
<p>
     "Go back to the office and finish the Proctor case," Agatha said as she gathered her things, avoiding Rio's gaze on her body. She left the room as quickly as possible, leaving the younger woman alone.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cursed Agatha's stubbornness, pulled her phone from her pocket, and opened her boss’s chat. She was planning to delete Ralph’s profile, but Agatha had disappeared for days and wasn’t responding to her messages, so she had to resort to drastic measures. In the end, Jen had done her a favor.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could ignore Rio as much as she wanted, but the young woman knew that wasn’t the case for her alter ego.
    </p>
<p>

<p>
     Rio's eyes were closed as she fought against the tickling of the brush on her face; Jen was applying some makeup that only she knew how to do. Her body was wrapped in a white towel, and she was lying on her friend's lap.
    </p>
<p>
     "What do you think of this blazer?" Alice rummaged through her friend's wardrobe looking for something stunning for Rio's first date with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not a chance," Jen exclaimed before Rio could weigh in. "That witch sees you in business attire every day; today you need to look absolutely irresistible."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened one eye, watching the chaos of clothes scattered across the room.
    </p>
<p>
     "Irresistible?" She repeated, sarcastically. "That's not going to change her impression of me at all."
     <b>
</b>
</p>
<p>
     "Yes, it will!" Jen shot back, applying the eyeshadow even more vigorously. "The goal is to break that negative impression. You need to look desireble."
    </p>
<p>
     "It would help if she at least knew the date was with you," Alice scoffed.
    </p>
<p>
     "She will know; my plan is foolproof."
    </p>
<p>
     "Your plan is terrible, Rio."
     <b>
</b>
</p>
<p>
     "Of course not." Rio pushed Jen's hands away and propped herself up on her elbows, facing Alice. "First, I’ll conveniently be fifteen minutes late. You know, just to make her a bit nervous. Then I’ll text her as Ralph canceling the date, saying I’m swamped with work or something like that. And then, who will show up to save her evening?" Rio pointed to herself with a proud smile. "That’s right, the best legal assistant at the best law firm in New York."
    </p>
<p>
     "So... me?" Jen asked, laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ugh, shut up." Rio lay back down on her friend's lap and let her finish the makeup.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen did some final touches on Rio's makeup, expertly outlining her eyes and applying a dark red lipstick that accentuated her lips. Alice pulled a dress from the closet and handed it to Rio, who tried it on without hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     "Done! Now you look like a true goddess!" Jen exclaimed proudly, stepping back to admire her work.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio walked over to the mirror, looking at herself from head to toe. Her slender figure was wrapped in a tight black dress that left little to the imagination.
    </p>
<p>
     "Girl, if Agatha doesn’t want you, I do," Alice said with a sly smile, but immediately received a confused look from Jen. "Just kidding."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, staring at herself in the mirror with a mix of confidence and nervousness. She had never been this bold in showing off her body, especially to her boss, but the situation called for a different game.
    </p>
<p>
     "I guess there's no turning back now," she murmured, trying to hide her nerves.
    </p>
<p>
     Her friends laughed, clearly aware of the apprehension hidden beneath the façade of self-confidence.
    </p>
<p>
     "Tell me again what happened that day at the office," Jen asked, grabbing a perfume from the bedside table and spraying a bit on Rio's neck. "You kissed Agatha, and what happened?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio squirmed, a small smile forming at the corners of her lips as she remembered that night.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was so good, and she wanted it so much at the time." Rio closed her eyes, clearly recalling that moment. She could feel Agatha's hands running over her body. "Then she said something about being my boss and that it was wrong; it was only when I kissed her again that she melted."
    </p>
<p>
     Jen let out a loud laugh, and Alice covered her mouth with her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "It’s so hard to imagine Agatha, all rigid and authoritarian..." Alice started, but was interrupted by Jen’s voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "No way! I’ve always found Agatha attractive; she has this dominating aura." Jen raised her eyebrows suggestively.
    </p>
<p>
     "Anyway, everything seemed too good to be true. Until she started pretending I didn’t exist." Rio shifted uncomfortably. "Which is ridiculous, because I know it’s just stubbornness. She wants to repeat that kiss just as much as I do."
    </p>
<p>
     Alice leaned closer to her friend, placing her hands on Rio’s shoulders and looking at her through the mirror.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio, tell me the truth. Do you like her?"
    </p>
<p>
     At that moment, the words caught in Rio’s throat, as if she were afraid to say the truth out loud. She bit her lip, avoiding Alice’s piercing gaze in the mirror while conflicting thoughts raced through her mind. The attraction was clear, impossible to deny, and the idea of having Agatha so close again drew her in deeply. She thought of Agatha, her authoritative demeanor, her sharp gaze, her relentless determination. But she also thought of the moments when Agatha had melted in her arms, how vulnerable she became when they were alone.
    </p>
<p>
     "More than I should," Rio sighed in response.
    </p>
<p>
     "Then delete that profile, forget about Ralph. Try to win Agatha over by being yourself. Because if she finds out, I don’t think she’ll ever forgive you." Alice brushed Rio’s hair off her shoulder and gave her a small smile. "And I don’t want to see you hurt."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio furrowed her eyebrows, deep in thought, staring at her reflection in the mirror as her friend’s words echoed in her mind. The image of Agatha came to her mind again, her stern expression softening in memory. Rio sighed, considering the possibility.
    </p>
<p>
     "She likes Ralph," her voice was shaky. "What if she doesn’t like me?"
    </p>
<p>
     "You don’t know if she really likes Ralph. Don’t confuse an online profile with a real person." She laughed. Her tone was gentle yet firm. "You’ve always been good at connecting with people, Rio. You just need to stop trying to avoid feelings so desperately."
    </p>
<p>
     "You’re amazing, Rio. Agatha is the one who needs to see that." Jen made a face. "That witch just needs to get that stick out of her ass and notice you."
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha drank what seemed to be her third glass of whiskey; she wasn’t sure as she wasn’t keeping track. She waved her glass toward the bartender, and he immediately refilled it. The atmosphere of Road's bar and the music were quite intoxicating; she could see why it was always crowded on weekends. Despite being right across from her office, it was Agatha’s first time in the place. The sound of music hung heavily in the air, and the lighting was dim but inviting.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned back on one of the small stools, gripping her glass tightly. She frowned as she surveyed the lively bar, feeling a bit out of place among those cheerful young people. The whiskey burned in her throat, but at least it made her feel less anxious.
    </p>
<p>
     She scanned the room looking for a tall blonde man, but again found nothing. She grabbed her phone and opened Ralph’s chat, starting to grow impatient.
    </p>
<p>
     She sent another message, her tone growing increasingly bitter.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You're late,"
     </em>
     she typed, her hands trembling slightly as she held the phone.
     <em>
      "And you didn’t even have the decency to let me know."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     But there was no indication that he was receiving her messages, so Agatha knew it was pointless.
    </p>
<p>
     "Waiting for someone, boss?" She heard a familiar voice behind her; she didn’t need to turn to know who it was.
    </p>
<p>
     "Vidal, are you stalking me?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Last time I checked, I come to this bar every week. You, on the other hand, I’ve never seen here before." Rio pulled the stool next to Agatha and sat down, leaning her head to get in the woman’s line of sight. "You didn’t answer me; are you waiting for someone?"
    </p>
<p>
     "No." Agatha replied coldly, then took another sip of her whiskey.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are!" Rio let out a loud laugh. The bartender approached, and already knowing the young woman, brought her the same beer she always ordered. "The great Agatha Harkness got stood up."
    </p>
<p>
     "If I had known you were this annoying, I wouldn’t have kissed you."
    </p>
<p>
     "You liked it, admit it." Rio teased.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was a lapse of judgment." Agatha took another sip of her whiskey. She finally looked at Rio, noticing her short black dress and striking makeup.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio flashed a mischievous smile and took long sips of her beer. She propped one foot on the stool’s rail, crossing her legs as she looked directly at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think you just don’t want to admit you want me."
    </p>
<p>
     "What are you doing here, anyway?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I-I... I’m meeting my friends." Rio stammered.
    </p>
<p>
     "Really, Vidal?" Agatha raised an eyebrow, noticing her assistant’s insecurity. "And where are they?"
    </p>
<p>
     "They’ll be here any minute." Rio placed her hand on Agatha’s waist and lightly ran her fingers over it. "Or I could ditch them and keep you company."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched Rio’s hand on her waist, her gaze locked on the young assistant’s eyes. She knew it was a bad idea, but the whiskey and the adrenaline from facing Ralph were affecting her. The sounds of the bar, the conversations in the background, and the lively atmosphere faded into the background, leaving only the soft touch of Rio’s hand as her focus.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don’t think this is a good idea. You’re my assistant."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed in frustration but didn’t give up. She leaned closer to Agatha, pressing against her chair, so close that the scent of perfume and alcohol mingled, creating an intoxicating mix.
    </p>
<p>
     "Tell me you didn’t think about that kiss." Rio whispered so only Agatha could hear.
    </p>
<p>
     "It just..." Agatha’s voice faltered slightly as she mentally scolded herself. "It’s just going to make things more complicated."
    </p>
<p>
     She looked around the bar again, searching for Ralph, but there was no sign of him.
    </p>
<p>
     "Whoever he is, he’s not showing up." Rio caught her attention again. "But I’m right here in front of you."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a deep breath, trying to compose herself. She knew Rio was teasing her, but the truth was that her words had a disquieting effect. She could feel the bar’s energy, the pulse of the music, as if everything was pushing Rio’s words forward.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why do you have to be so irresistible?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a low laugh, a trill that reverberated throughout the space, a sound that drew attention and sent shivers down Agatha’s spine. She leaned in a little closer, resting on her elbows while maintaining Agatha’s gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love the effect I have on you, darling." There was a challenge in her eyes, an implicit provocation that ignited Agatha’s curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, trying to think, but the closeness of Rio and the woman’s scent were intoxicating.
    </p>
<p>
     "You’re unbearably annoying." The words slipped out more as a whisper than a protest.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed again, the sound making Agatha’s body tingle with desire.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened her eyes again, staring at the woman in front of her, who was still looking at her with that challenging gaze. She didn’t know if it was the alcohol affecting her or the frustration of being sidelined by Ralph, but Agatha decided to give in to her desires.
    </p>
<p>
     "Take me to your place." She whispered in her assistant’s ear. "And Vidal, don’t make me regret this."

      Rio's apartment wasn't very large, just enough for a single woman, and decorated perfectly to match her personality. In the living room, a shelf was filled with vinyl records, mostly classic rock, a collection that the girl carefully curated. A small table with some scented candles, an abstract painting she bought at a yard sale, and a soft rug made the space cozy. The walls were a soft, soothing shade of blue, reminiscent of a gentle sea breeze, while several classic band and film posters adorned the space.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn't pay attention to any of that.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The moment the front door closed, she grabbed Rio for an intense and passionate kiss, built up by the desire she had been trying to hide for days. Her hands closed around the woman's neck as their lips met in a feverish dance.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For a few moments, she forgot about everything. The constant tension at work, the frustrations, the worries. There was only the taste of Rio on her tongue and the feel of her body pressed against hers.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio explored her boss's waist and back with the same intensity, pushing her against the wall and holding her. Agatha’s hands drew her close with strength, while their lips molded against hers, demanding and possessive.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "This is my apartment." Rio said breathlessly between kisses. "Do you want to see the rest of it?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes. I want to see your bedroom." Agatha replied, her voice filled with desire.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s suggestion provoked a wave of excitement in Rio, her dark eyes reflecting a mix of anticipation and expectation. Her assistant's hand latched into hers, entwining their fingers as she led her down the hallway.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As they entered Rio's bedroom, the atmosphere felt charged. The sexual tension between the two was palpable, and neither one of them wanted to wait any longer. As Rio turned to close the door, Agatha was already behind her, her hot and quick breath on the assistant's neck. Her hands slid down, gently caressing Rio's thighs over her short dress and pulling her closer.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They moved closer to the bed, their lips and hands starting to explore each other's bodies again, desperate to know every curve and detail. Rio pushed Agatha onto the bed and climbed on top of her, unbuttoning her button-up shirt, revealing a black lace bra.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha arched her body, giving into the sensations coursing through her body and offered a small smile of approval. Rio sat in her boss's lap, her hands wandering over the woman's soft skin.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gently caressed Agatha's breast, her left hand moving towards the woman's face, tenderly caressing it. She supported herself on her knees, hovering above Agatha, as she leaned in, her lips approaching hers in a slow and sweet kiss.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha responded almost desperately, her tongue seeking out the lips of her assistant, craving the familiar sensation, as her hands roamed over Rio's thighs, feeling the softness of her skin through the fabric of her dress. She lifted the garment carefully, exploring Rio's ass with each touch.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I forgot to mention..." Rio whispered into Agatha's ear "I'm not wearing any underwear."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Damn you." Agatha cursed with a mischievous smile on her lips, squeezing her assistant's  ass with force.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a low laugh, the sound echoing through the dark bedroom as she moved lightly on her boss's lap. She felt powerful, knowing that her boss was completely at her mercy.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Is that a complaint?" She asked in a provocative tone, as her lips trailed down Agatha's neck, peppering the sensitive skin with small kisses.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sat up and pulled the woman against her body, searching for the zipper of her dress and pulling it down.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Take it off." The authoritative tone of Agatha mingled with a note of desire, as her hands moved possessively across Rio's body.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt a shiver run through her body as Agatha demanded she take the dress off. The boss's hands were firm and possessive, sending waves of excitement through her veins. Slowly, she obeyed, never breaking eye contact with Agatha. She let her dress fall to the floor, revealing her tan skin.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She leaned forward, her lips finding Agatha's again, her tongue invading her boss's mouth, savoring the sweetness that mingled with the taste of alcohol.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hands now roamed over Rio’s body with an urgency that seemed to be growing with every second. Her nails lightly scratched at the young woman’s skin, sending shivers down her spine. She moved her mouth to Rio’s neck, tracing a line of wet kisses down to her breast, taking the nipple into her mouth with care, leaving light bites and hickeys.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio closed her eyes, giving in to Agatha’s touches, each contact stealing a sigh from her. She finished pulling off her boss’ shirt and bra, and their breasts rubbed against each other lightly as they kissed once more. She felt her boss’ hand slide between her thighs, scratching the inner part of her thighs and pressing her clitoris.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "So wet, Vidal." Agatha whispered against her assistant's mouth. "Is that all because of me?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bit her lip, trying to control the moan that threatened to escape from her throat.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes... just for you," she murmured between kisses, Agatha's tongue tracing its way up her jawline to her ear. Her voice became more ragged as she felt the caresses of her boss, her fingertips sliding over her thighs, each touch causing a shiver down Rio's skin. "I want more."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled in a teasing manner, and her eyes sparkled with an intense ardor.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Do you like this?" Agatha asked, her voice faltering as she tried to maintain control. She slid her fingers in small, circular motions, gently caressing Rio's clitoris, causing the woman's body to respond with an involuntary movement of her hips.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio responded with a guttural sigh, unable to form words as Agatha continued to tease her with an expert touch. Each movement of her fingers awakened a new type of reaction in Rio, as if it were a magic switch that activated all of her most sensitive spots. It was a sweet torment, the way Agatha touched and aroused her, slowly increasing her desire.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes, I like it..." Rio managed to say, struggling to keep her voice steady, but the desire was palpable in every word. She intertwined her fingers in Agatha's hair, pulling her in for another kiss.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha slid two fingers inside Rio, causing the woman to release the moan she had been trying to hold back for so long.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Stop holding back. I want to hear you." Agatha's words were an order, her voice as firm as her fingers. As she spoke, she increased the pace, feeling Rio's body responding to her touch.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio surrended herself to the sensation, forgetting any doubts or inhibitions. Her mind filled with pure desire, and she leaned on her boss' shoulders, giving herself completely to the woman in front of her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Please..." She pleaded, her voice trembling. "Don't stop."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The room was filled with Rio's moans, which she could no longer hold back. Her hips moving in the same rhythm as her boss's fingers, increasing the contact between them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha changed the angle of her touch, causing the legal assistant to be even more caught up in pleasure. She smiled with satisfaction as she watched Rio completely give in. She knew she had found something that put her out of control, and she felt even more powerful. She increased the intensity of her movements, feeling the young woman's body shake even more as a orgasm took over and Rio spilled herself over her boss's fingers.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The ecstasy spread throughout Rio's body as she regained her breath after reaching climax, her expression still marked by the recent pleasure. Rio took her boss's fingers, still wet from pleasure, to her mouth and sucked them without breaking eye contact.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Good girl." Agatha murmured, removing her fingers from Rio's mouth and stroking her chin lightly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lay down, Miss Harkness." Rio gently pushed Agatha down onto the bed. "We're not done yet."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She unbuttoned Agatha's high-waisted pants, leaving her wearing only a tiny black pair of panties. She ran her hands down her boss's bare thighs and positioned herself in between her legs. With the tips of her fingers, she caressed Agatha's intimacy through the fabric, noticing how it was getting wetter.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You look so much better in this position, Miss Harkness." Rio whispered, looking at her with a mischievous smile. "Horizontally."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha bit her lip to repress a moan, feeling Rio's hand caress her body in a provocative manner. She never imagined it would be so easy to lose control, but the woman's touch was irresistible. She closed her eyes, trying to regain a bit of composure, but the effect was the same. Rio's voice only made her sink deeper into the sensations that were invading her, making her vulnerable.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Even now, you're still trying to test my authority." Agatha attempted to be firm, but the expression on her face betrayed how much she was enjoying it.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed, challenging her. Her right hand caressed Agatha's thigh, sliding gently along the edge of her panties and pulling them down, discarding the last piece of clothing her boss was wearing. Rio's hand once again wandered across Agatha's skin, tracing her waist, her ribs, and finally running down the side of her chest, where she stopped to caress one breast. Her fingers continued down her hip, where she leaned in and planted wet kisses. Her right hand slid between Agatha's thighs, her nails scratching lightly against the sensitive skin, while her mouth trailed down her stomach, stopping dangerously close to her intimacy.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio slowly dragged her tongue along the entire length of her boss clitoris, finally tasting what she had been craving for so long. She pulled Agatha by the hip and buried her face on her sex, exploring every exposed corner. Rio bit lightly at the skin of her boss's inner thigh, provoking an even more panting breath from the woman. While still holding her hand on Agatha’s waist, she reached down with her other hand and inserted two fingers inside her boss.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha arched her back in an attempt to control the moans that escaped her throat. Her mind was confused, unable to decide if she wanted to give herself completely to the moment or maintain control. Rio's touch was a tempting torment, a mixture of boldness and desire that made the authoritative and strict woman quiver.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's hand and mouth were waging their own battle, as they caressed the skin of Agatha, discovering her sensitive spots and provoking reactions that seemed to contrast with her boss's natural strictness.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh Rio...” Agatha moaned, unable to control herself. She intertwined her fingers in Rio's hair, bringing the woman's face even closer to her intimacy. "Don't stop, please. Don't stop, don't stop."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's body responded to the silent pleas of Agatha; her tongue moved with more determination as her fingers worked without rest, increasing the pleasure coursing through the woman's veins. As Rio surrendered to the moment, her free hand snaked up the waist of Agatha, caressing her skin with tenderness.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha's moans grew louder, reflecting the desperation within her. She tried to control her breathing, but her voice betrayed her. She felt her body tense against Rio's touch, her walls closing around the assistant's fingers, indicating the imminent orgasm. Agatha grabbed the headboard, trying to keep herself still as her body trembled. The screams escaped her lips without control, her mind trapped in the waves of pleasure that were running through her entire body. For a few moments, the rigidness characteristic of her personality faded, replaced by a vulnerability that was almost never allowed.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio slowly withdrew her fingers while still sucking and licking every drop of pleasure that Agatha had spilled. She stood up to face her boss with a dark expression, her gaze still filled with lust.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Kiss me," Agatha commanded, trying to recover her authoritative pose, but her breathing was still too heavy.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio approached obediently, their lips touching gently, but with a hint of challenge. Rio's tongue invaded her mouth, demanding total dominance. Agatha relented with a muffled moan, allowing the kiss to take control of her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She could feel the sweet taste of herself in Rio's mouth, which was driving her crazy. Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio's neck, pulling her closer.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They seemed unable to separate from each other, the two almost ready to surrender themselves to each other once more throughout the rest of the night.
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      A sliver of light insistently entered the completely dark room that morning. The rain was falling heavily outside, the cold filled the room, and it was Sunday. The perfect setting to stay in bed all day, but Agatha woke up bothered by the light anyway. A slight headache was forming, and the discomfort between her legs from the intense night she’d had made her grunt in pain. She could feel Rio’s possessive embrace around her waist and the assistant’s heavy breathing on her back.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She had spent the entire night with Rio. Her body was marked by the assistant’s touches, but her heart was still on the defensive. She should have left, even if it was in the middle of the night. Right now, she should get out of bed, distance herself from all those conflicting feelings, and return to her routine of work and emotional distance. But there she was, trapped in Rio’s possessive embrace, trying to deal with the mess that was her mind. It was already dangerous enough to have given in to the woman’s provocations; she didn’t need to get emotionally involved with her. If anyone at the office found out, her reputation would be ruined.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A major partner sleeping with a paralegal assistent —what a cliché.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned to face the sleeping woman. The messy hair and relaxed breathing gave Rio a peaceful air, but the arrogant smile that so irritated Agatha was still there. She lightly ran her fingers over the assistant’s lips, feeling their texture. Her desire was to dive into those lips and never leave.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t run away again,” Rio murmured between Agatha’s fingers.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I should, but I won’t,” she replied in a still hoarse voice, moving her fingers across Rio’s face and brushing the strands of hair away to look at her. Rio didn’t move, snuggling even closer to Agatha, her leg wrapping around the woman’s thighs. “Are you always this possessive?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m half Puerto Rican.” Rio slowly opened her eyes, her brown orbs finally meeting Agatha’s blue ones. “I have a free pass to be possessive.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn’t suppress a hoarse laugh at Rio’s response. She slid her hands down the young woman’s back, pulling her body even closer. She could feel the warmth of the other’s skin.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m starting to like this,” she said in a whispered voice, close to her assistant’s sensitive neck. “You’re possessive and very chatty.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Only qualities, in my opinion.” Rio leaned in and initiated a slow, passionate kiss.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Whilst their lips connected in a kiss, Agatha slowly slid her hand over Rio's face, fingers tracing the young woman's cheeks with a gentle touch. The sweet taste of her assistant's mouth invited her to deepen the contact as Rio's tongue found hers in a slow dance.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha softly bit Rio's lower lip, pulling it gently. Her hands continued caressing the exposed skin of the young woman’s back, as the kiss intensified further.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio climbed on top of Agatha, every inch of her body pressing against that of the woman on the bed. She parted the woman’s legs without breaking the kiss and moved her right hand to her sex, pressing her clitoris with circular movements.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Spend the day with me," the assistant begged between kisses.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Rio..." Agatha groaned against the woman's mouth. "That's a low blow, even for you."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I know." Rio intensified her movements, eliciting more moans from her boss. "Spend the day with me.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha arched her back as Rio intensified her touches, the skillful fingers dancing over the sensitive skin between her legs. Each movement sent waves of pleasure through the woman's body, making her moan into the kisses.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She tried to protest, her words got lost.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Rio..." Her voice faltered as the assistant continued to explore every inch of her flesh.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Please..."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes! Yes!" Agatha screamed as the orgasm took over her body. She pushed Rio aside as her body trembled and gasped for air. “Fuck.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio chuckled and propped herself up on one elbow, staring at the woman under the light of the half-drawn curtains. She observed the scene with a calm gaze, her fingers gently gliding through the woman’s messy hair.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did I convince you?” she asked with a mischievous smile.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re dishonest.” Agatha finally said, pulling the sheets to cover her nakedness as she averted Rio's gaze. “Using that trick to get what you want.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you today.” Rio murmured, brushing her lips gently along the woman’s neck.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pushed her back onto the bed and stood up, letting the sheet fall.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If I’m staying here today, you’re making breakfast. While I take a shower…” Agatha walked toward the bathroom, but not before flashing Rio a sarcastic smile. “All alone.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alone? That’s not fair, Agatha!” Rio exclaimed incredulously, but the woman had already closed the bathroom door.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a frustrated sigh, trying to stifle her laughter. As much as she tried to seem irritated, she couldn’t deny that there was something incredibly amusing about the situation. Her boss was a woman who rarely gave in, and seeing her defeated was satisfying.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As she heard the sound of water splashing against Agatha’s naked body, Rio got out of bed, stretching her relaxed muscles and putting on some comfortable clothes. She walked into the kitchen of her apartment, opening the cabinets in search of ingredients.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A few minutes later, Agatha appeared in the kitchen wearing only a Megadeth band t-shirt and panties, her hair still damp from the shower.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You stole my shirt.” Rio pointed while holding a frying pan on the stove.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And your panties, since you don’t even wear them anyway.” Agatha placed her hands on Rio’s waist, hugging her from behind, and peeked over her shoulder to see what she was cooking. “Are those pancakes?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mm-hmm.” Rio murmured, grabbing a steaming mug from the coffee machine and turning to hand it to Agatha. “Black coffee, no sugar. Just like you drink at the office.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grabbed the mug, inhaling the aroma before taking a long sip, savoring it. Rio watched her for a moment; the old band t-shirt her boss wore seemed even more provocative than her usual elegant work clothes. Rio wondered if Agatha really looked like this at home, disheveled with messy hair, or if it was a carefully planned performance just for her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You read the same book as me, know how I drink my coffee, and found me at that bar alone yesterday.” She raised her fingers, counting each coincidence. “I have more than enough reasons to think you’re stalking me.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m just observant.” Rio set the frying pan on the stove and pulled Agatha into her arms for another intense kiss. “I never thought this would happen,” Rio murmured. “You here with me, it feels like a dream.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a small laugh as Agatha caressed her, her hands trailing down Rio’s waist until they settled on her hips. She could feel Agatha’s warm breath against her neck, the tip of Agatha’s nose gently grazing her skin as it traced a path to the curve of her ear.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A burnt smell began to fill the room.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio,” Agatha said, a silly laugh escaping her as she pulled away. “You forgot the pancakes.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio blinked quickly, snapping out of the depths of her thoughts and back into the reality of the kitchen. The burnt smell had become too strong, forcing her to push aside the distraction of Agatha’s face. She rushed to the pan, lifted the burnt pancakes, and quickly threw them in the trash.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shit!” she exclaimed. “It’s your fault, you distracted me.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A simple task, Vidal. Making breakfast, and still, you managed to get distracted.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We can still eat toast.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They spent the rest of the morning between laughter and kisses, eventually ending up on the couch, Rio nestled in Agatha’s arms with her head resting on her chest, listening to the soft beats of the woman’s heart. The movie
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Carol
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      was playing on the television, with Agatha occasionally commenting on how strange it was, since she was about to start the book. She glanced suspiciously at Rio, but the girl seemed unconcerned, so she decided not to ask any questions. It was probably just another coincidence.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the day passed, they took the time to truly talk and get to know each other, without the usual office concerns and the arrogant tone they adopted to annoy one another. Slowly, Rio opened up about her past and her time in foster care.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha listened in silence, her usually stern expression softening with compassion. As she listened, she caressed Rio’s back, her touch gentle and comforting. There were no words of consolation or promises to change the past, just the silence between them as the memories were shared.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How long were you in foster care?” Agatha asked, running her fingers through the brunette’s hair.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Most of my adolescence. I bounced from one foster home to another for years. No one wanted to adopt a kid as old as me.” Rio felt Agatha’s fingers in her hair and sighed. It was hard to talk about it, but right now, she felt safe with the woman. “Until I graduated high school and got a scholarship in a small college.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And your parents? What happened to them?” Agatha asked curiously after a while.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio straightened up on the couch and stared at her hands.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Car accident, I was ten.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha remained silent, absorbing Rio’s sad story. It was a side of the assistant she had never seen before—vulnerable, with her armor down, revealing deeply ingrained scars.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hand found Rio’s, intertwining their fingers.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m so sorry, Rio.” she finally said, her voice softer than usual.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please, don’t feel sorry for me.” Rio said with a small smile on her face. “I have great memories of them. Every Sunday, my mom would make pasta, and we’d sit at the table and eat together. My dad had a Bordonua, it’s like a guitar, that he built himself. And he’d sing typical Puerto Rican songs for the two of us.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A tear fell from Rio’s face, and Agatha immediately wiped it away.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They sound amazing,” Agatha said in a weak voice, almost a whisper.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “They were.” Rio let herself be hugged again and rested her head on Agatha’s chest. “I couldn’t keep most of the things, but I remember how much my dad loved rock and had vinyl collections. Over time, I managed to rebuild that collection.” She pointed to the shelf full of records.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So that’s why half of your wardrobe is band t-shirts?” Agatha grinned widely when she heard Rio laugh. “Yeah, I was spying on your clothes while you made coffee.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s fine, spy away.” Rio snuggled even closer, deepening the embrace between them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt her heart warm. It was inevitable not to think of Nicholas, how their story mirrored in so many details. She knew that if the boy turned out even a little bit like Rio, he would become an incredible man.

<p>
<span>
      Over the past week, Agatha had gotten into the habit of arriving at the office a half hour before work, when everything was still empty, just to have some alone time with Rio. They would look for any excuse to be alone, as Agatha wanted to keep their non-relationship a secret.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Stop it." Rio lowered Agatha's wrist, which she was trying to check the time on her watch. "We still have a few minutes."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "If someone catches us..."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "No one is here at this time." Rio unbuttoned another button on her boss's shirt, which was halfway undone. Agatha was sitting on the desk, her legs intertwined around Rio's hips, and her neck exposed as the assistant distributed kisses all over it.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha bit Rio's earlobe, her voice a raspy whisper.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You know how distracting you are to me?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio bit her lip, and her hands slid down to Agatha's waist.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Maybe that's the point, Miss Harkness.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha intertwined her fingers in Rio's hair, pulling her harder as she responded to another kiss. She felt Rio's lips slide down her neck, sending waves of pleasure throughout her body. These brief escapes in the office were necessary, they were the only way for them to have some alone time together.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It had been a week since they had started whatever this was, and they couldn’t keep their hands off each other. Every time Agatha had a problem or needed assistance, it was Rio who attended to her. Every new case that the lawyer took on, Rio was the one chosen to assist. This had started to cause some resentment among the other legal assistants, but Rio didn’t care. She wanted to be close to Agatha, and she would do whatever it took.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were so lost in each other that neither of them heard the sound of heels clicking down the hall.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha Harkness, how low can you go?” A distinctive laugh interrupted the bubble of passion between them, making Agatha and Rio quickly pull away. Wanda Maximoff was standing in the doorway with a wide grin on her face and a file in her hands, her pregnant belly sticking out in front of her. “Never thought of you as someone who’d fuck in the office. We never did that when I worked here.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out an irritated sigh, pulling the hem of her blazer to cover the small button that had come undone on her chest. Her flushed face betrayed the little control she still had over the situation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio, on the other hand, struggled to control the blush on her cheeks as she tried to compose herself in her seat. Wanda’s name was familiar—everyone knew that she and Agatha had been married, and how disastrous the divorce had been.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Wanda, what are you doing here?" Agatha asked, her voice sharp as a knife.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt her heart race as she watched the woman standing in the doorway, her eyes quickly scanning Agatha, who looked mortified. The situation was unexpected and awkward, but that didn’t seem to deter Wanda, who looked thoroughly amused by the interrupted scene.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She deliberately ignored Agatha’s question and turned to Rio.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda Maximoff,” she extended her hand in introduction, but Rio didn’t bother to shake it. “And who are you?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha’s girlfriend,” Rio replied without hesitation, earning a surprised look from her boss.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, still trying to recover, frowned and shot Rio a disapproving look.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda let out a low laugh and shook her head, clearly enjoying the situation. She walked over to the desk and casually sat in the nearest chair.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Girlfriend, huh?” Wanda asked, a mischievous smile on her lips. “You surprise me, Agatha.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Get out, Vidal.” Agatha guided the assistant toward the door, ignoring her hurt look. She watched as Rio walked away angrily, and as soon as the woman disappeared from her view, she turned back to face her ex-wife. “What do you want here?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “First, tell me about this girlfriend of yours.” She teased a bit more.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda, what the hell are you doing here?” Agatha exclaimed irritably as she sat down facing the woman.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Got it, you’re not in the mood for jokes.” Wanda slid the file across the desk to Agatha. She picked it up and opened it, scanning it carefully. “Tony Stark is being accused of sexual harassment, and I’m representing him. My firm heard that Lilia Calderu took on the girl’s case, so I came here to try and make an amicable settlement.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Before business hours?” Agatha raised an eyebrow.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I wanted to surprise you, my love.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha closed the file and pushed it back to Wanda.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s Lilia’s case, show the offer to her.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That old woman never liked me.” Wanda stood up carefully but didn’t bother to take the file. Agatha glared at her ex-wife’s belly with intensity, the anger beginning to bubble up inside her. Not about the pregnancy, but about the life she and Wanda could have had. “I’ll consider it a personal favor if you present this to Lilia.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The office was starting to fill up as Wanda bid a sarcastic farewell, slammed the door behind her, and left an irritated Agatha behind. Lawyers, interns, and assistants were running around, the sound of keyboard taps and chatter filled the air.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A personal favor.” Agatha mocked when she was finally alone. “Fuck you.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She grabbed the file and walked nervously to Lilia’s office. She passed by Rio’s cubicle on the way, but the girl didn’t even look at her. Agatha knew she had hurt her, and she would make it right. But right now, this was more important. She found her friend in the hallway with a large cup of coffee and sunglasses covering most of her face.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why did I run into your ex-wife in the elevator?” Lilia asked as they entered her office.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed, trying to stay calm. She closed the door behind her and sat in the chair across from her friend, the file still in her hands.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because that devil is representing Tony Stark in a case you took without telling me,” Agatha pushed the file towards her. “She wants to settle before it hits the media.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course she does.” Lilia set her purse aside and sat down to face her friend. “I didn’t know I needed your permission to take cases.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “At least we should have discussed it when it’s something that could affect the entire firm.” Agatha was still frowning.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why are you so nervous?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She caught me with Rio.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia let out a laugh, trying to break the tension in the air.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you worried because the assistant was there?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let her head fall back against the chair and put her hands over her face, clearly embarrassed.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was almost naked,” she murmured, frustrated.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia’s loud laugh filled the whole room.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So you followed my advice.” She said with a small, proud smile. “I heard the other assistants saying she works overtime without complaining. Is she working overtime on you, Agatha?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ugh, shut up!” Both of them burst into laughter together. “I want this case, Lilia.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You want the case to defend a harassed woman or just to beat Wanda?” Lilia asked, raising an eyebrow.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha opened her mouth, feigning false indignation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re offending my morality.” Agatha leaned forward, resting her elbows on the desk. “I want to beat Wanda.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia laughed again, enjoying the mischievous side her friend always showed when they were together.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The case is yours with one condition.” She imposed with a smile. “You’re going to meet my new boyfriend, and you’re going to be extra polite to him. No jokes about him being younger, no jokes about him being interested in money, and definitely no jokes about erectile dysfunction.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Lilia!” Agatha exclaimed, pouting. “He’s only interested in money. They’ll do.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You don’t even know him.” Lilia pulled her phone out of her bag and looked for something to show her friend. “His name is Evan, he’s 32, and he’s a model. Well, sort of. He did some photoshoots and sold them to those stock photo banks. Here.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned her phone toward Agatha and showed her a picture of a man with his arm around Lilia. Tall, with curly blonde hair and a stubbled beard. Agatha felt her heart race, her stomach twisted, and her mouth went dry. It didn’t seem real, but there it was, right in front of her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is Ralph.” Agatha whispered, her eyes widening in disbelief.

      Agatha spent the rest of the day locked in her office with the curtains drawn so that no one would notice her emotional breakdown. She should have been studying the case, learning about the victim and the allegations, formulating a strategy to beat Wanda. But the only thing running through her mind was Rio Vidal.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio, who read the same books as Ralph. Rio, who knew what kind of coffee she drank. Rio, who was watching the movie based on the book Ralph had recommended. Rio, who fell asleep in her arms after they made love all night. It couldn’t be the same person; she refused to believe it. Although all the coincidences pointed to that.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha needed to be sure.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She grabbed her phone looking for Jessica Jones’s number and sent a message.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “I need to know who is behind this account, as soon as possible. I’ll pay double.”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Two knocks on the door, and Rio stuck her head inside. A mix of sadness and nausea took over Agatha.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can we talk? The office is almost empty.” Rio asked, and Agatha gestured for her to sit down. “What did your ex-wife want?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha remained silent for a moment, her gaze fixed on the window that showed the dark city below. After a few moments of silence, she finally responded.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She’s representing the opposition in a case at the firm.” Agatha returned her attention to the computer, trying to stay busy. She couldn’t afford to look at Rio right now.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did something happen? You look like you're about to throw up.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m fine.” Agatha whispered.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is it because I said I’m your girlfriend?” Rio asked with a hint of irritation. “I agree we haven’t talked about it, but I mean something to you, right?” She pointed to herself and then to Agatha. “What we’re doing means something.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha furrowed her eyebrow, her hand gripping the pen more tightly as she tried to avoid Rio’s gaze.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know I can’t have a relationship with someone from the office.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio crossed her arms, a gesture showing both frustration and determination.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why not? Who says we can’t try?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed, seemingly trying to find the right words to explain the unthinkable.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can we talk about this later?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before Rio could protest, a teenage figure in tattered clothes and a smile on his face interrupted them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha!” Nicholas came running into the room, a security guard following closely behind.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicholas!” Agatha exclaimed, surprised by the unexpected presence of the teenager. “What are you doing here?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sorry, Miss Harkness. He said he was your son, but I know you don’t have any children.” The security guard, still out of breath, made a move to pull the boy out, but Agatha waved him off.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s fine, Nicholas is always welcome.” She dismissed the man with a wave of her hand and stood to hug the boy. “How did you find where I work?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There’s a huge sign with your name outside of the building.” He took the backpack off his back and sat next to Rio. “Hi, my name’s Nick.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m Rio, Agatha’s girlfriend.” She said with a proud smile.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Stop telling people that you’re my girlfriend!” Agatha exclaimed, as she readjusted herself in her chair.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m Agatha’s future girlfriend.” Rio whispered to Nicholas, and he laughed. “Is this the boy who robbed you?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’ve gotten past that.” Nicholas bent down and started rummaging through his backpack. “You disappeared after the station, I thought you were going to visit me.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I got caught up in a tough case.” Agatha replied evasively, knowing very well that she had been distracted by Rio.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas finally found what he was looking for in the backpack, three small brown tickets.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good thing your girlfriend is here, I have three tickets for a fun fair.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha relaxed her muscles in the chair, giving in. It was easier to let the boy believe Rio was her girlfriend.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Great!” Rio exclaimed excitedly, almost jumping. “Let’s go, Agatha. Please.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicholas, how did you get these tickets?” Agatha asked, curious. “I know you don’t have money for that, and you promised you’d stay out of trouble.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I… found them on the street…” Nicholas replied quietly, staring at his own feet.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “There you go, he found them on the street.” Rio stood up, pointing to the door. “Let’s go!
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, realizing her dilemma. Nick was a difficult teenager, but he had a sweet heart, and she really didn’t want to say no to him. But looking at Rio, she felt a mix of frustration and distrust. She still didn’t know if she could trust her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please, Agatha.” Nicholas begged. “Mrs. Hart put me in a house with an elderly couple, the woman is deaf, and the man sleeps all day. They don’t even have a TV! All I do is go to school, come home, and stare at the ceiling all day.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alright,” she sighed heavily, “but we’re staying for just an hour.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
</span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the three of them walked through the fun fair, the colorful lights and loud music filled the air. Groups of teenagers ran by, laughing and having fun, while couples smiled and talked.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A target-shooting booth caught their attention, and Rio stopped excitedly and grabbed the fake gun.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If I hit the target, you’ll agree to be my girlfriend.” She declared, aiming at a rubber duck.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She agrees!” Nicholas shouted, raising his arms.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No.” Agatha scolded the boy.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio shrugged and shot the gun, missing the target by a wide margin. Nicholas and Agatha burst out laughing.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shit, what do I get for that?” Rio asked the vendor, disappointed, as he handed her a cheap plastic ring. “Well, better than nothing.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio placed the plastic ring on Agatha’s finger, the casual gesture making the lawyer’s heart beat a little faster. Nicholas watched the scene with an amused expression, but the woman was tense on the inside.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now you’re mine, dear.” Rio joked, while Agatha tried to maintain a neutral expression.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, look!” Nicholas shouted, pointing at a ferris wheel. “Let’s go!”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The boy ran ahead, and Rio moved to follow him, but Agatha stood still, staring at the ride.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Come on, the line’s not even that long.” Rio returned to look at her, reaching for her hand and holding it. “What’s wrong?” She asked, noticing her boss’s fearful look.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I—I’m going to buy something to eat.” Agatha said, her voice trembling.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio frowned and, in an automatic gesture, squeezed Agatha’s hand, trying to calm her. It was the first time she’d seen such a visibly nervous reaction from her boss.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you have a fear of heights?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No!” Agatha replied defensively, but her expression told another story.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t resist the opportunity. She let out a chuckle, barely contained.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How cute, my boss is scared. Are you going to tell me you’re also afraid of clowns?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not scared!” Agatha pushed Rio away irritably and joined Nicholas in the line.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed, satisfied with the reaction. In her opinion, the expression on Agatha’s face was worth every second of the teasing. She stayed close, as the line moved slowly. At times, the young woman cast challenging glances at her boss, enjoying the apparent discomfort on her face.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The line dragged on, the movement in the fair was high, and the sun began to set behind the trees, giving the sky an orange hue. Agatha could see Rio and Nicholas in front of her, talking quietly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Fortunately, they managed to get a cart that could fit all three of them. Nicholas was the first to jump in making the structure of the car shake, Rio followed him and pulled Agatha to sit next to her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is this safe?” Agatha shouted to the attendant, but the man just responded with a thumbs-up, brushing off what the woman had said.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The wheel began to move slowly, and Nicholas seemed too distracted by the view to pay attention to them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Here, hold my hand.” Rio offered.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hesitated for a moment, a distrustful look on her face, but finally gave in and took Rio’s hand, trying to control the involuntary tremor caused by her nerves. The wheel passed through a sloped part, giving a small shake.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Trust me,” Rio said, her tone calm.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Really?” Agatha narrowed her eyes and gave a sarcastic laugh. “Should I trust you?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Can we take a picture?” Nicholas interrupted them again.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at Nicholas and then returned her gaze to Agatha, their eyes meeting for a brief moment. There was an odd feeling in the air, a mix of anxiety and uncertainty. She could feel Agatha’s hand squeezing hers, firm and tense.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sure, why not?” Rio said casually, but there was a hint of confusion in her look.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha forced a smile while Rio nodded. Nicholas positioned himself between them, resting his arms on their shoulders, and Rio extended her phone to take the picture. As the camera snapped, both women wore forced smiles, though a nearly palpable discomfort hung between them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The sky was already turning black as they left the ferris wheel. Nicholas, still as excited as when they arrived, ran to the cotton candy stand and waved at them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I sent you the picture, check if you like it.” Rio said as she approached.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha grabbed her phone from her bag to check her notifications, but what caught her attention was a message from Jessica Jones.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “The account has logged in several times from your company, an employee named Rio Vidal.”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha slowly lifted her eyes and stared at her assistant, her gaze heavy with hurt.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is there something you need to tell me?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Please, tell me.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha silently pleaded.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Don’t lie.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, actually.” Rio gave a silly smile and scratched her neck, completely oblivious. “I wasn’t joking about that girlfriend thing.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood motionless, feeling as though she had been hit in the stomach. Her insides twisted with a mix of pain and betrayal. For a moment, she was silent, unable to say anything. Finally, she found her voice, but it was heavy with disappointment.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Stay away from me, you psycho.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha quickly pulled away, finding Nicholas with three cotton candies and his face covered in sugar. She grabbed the boy by the arm, and they disappeared into the crowd.

<p>
     It was the middle of the night when a tearful Agatha rang the doorbell of her best friend’s brick house, Lilia Calderu, incessantly. It wasn’t until several minutes had passed, both of them comfortably sitting on the older woman's couch, that Agatha finally stopped crying.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was Rio behind the fake profile." She said, her voice trembling, a new wave of tears threatening to fall. "She lied to get close to me."
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia remained silent as Agatha poured out her sorrows. Her cheeks were wet with tears she hadn’t bothered to hold back. Her long fingers gently stroked the foam of an herbal tea Lilia had made. The silence that followed was only interrupted by the sound of the rain beating against the windows.
    </p>
<p>
     "I’m so stupid." Agatha cursed. "It was right there, in front of me. All the coincidences lining up, and I didn’t pay attention. All because I let myself be mesmerized by that girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia let out a long sigh, affectionately running her hand down Agatha’s back. Agatha was someone who rarely cried. The last time Lilia remembered was at her mother's funeral. Even though the woman hadn’t deserved a single tear. Not when she caught Wanda with another man, not during the divorce process, and not even when her ex took her things out of the apartment they had shared for years. Agatha didn’t cry. She screamed and raged, destroyed an entire room after Wanda left, but not a single tear.
    </p>
<p>
     But she was crying now, over Rio, a one-week affair that shouldn’t have meant anything.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha..." Lilia started gently, choosing her words carefully. "Why are you so shaken by this?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hesitated for a moment, the words piling up in her mind, a chaotic mixture of frustration, confusion, and regret. She was a woman used to being strong, but now, sitting in front of Lilia, she allowed herself to drop her guard.
    </p>
<p>
     "I let myself be vulnerable." Agatha now stared at the liquid in her cup, memories of her first night with Rio flooding her mind. "The way she made me feel safe. Rio made me feel things I didn’t even remember anymore. I know it was fast, but I thought I had found something different in her."
    </p>
<p>
     The rain outside seemed to sync with the situation, tapping insistently against the windows. The soft, rhythmic sound contrasted with Agatha’s emotional turmoil.
    </p>
<p>
     "You fell for her, didn’t you?" Lilia’s voice was calm, but there was a note of compassion. Agatha’s blue eyes met hers, startled, but Lilia didn’t need confirmation for something so obvious. "Sometimes people come into our lives just to make us feel alive, Agatha. Vulnerability is part of being human."
    </p>
<p>
     "It doesn’t matter." Agatha wiped her face, trying to rid herself of the tears. "I gave her a chance to explain, you know? I asked her if there was something she needed to tell me, but Rio is so arrogant she didn’t even realize she should’ve told me the truth. To her, everything’s a joke, including me."
    </p>
<p>
     "Have you considered that she didn’t know any other way to get close to you?" Agatha looked at her incredulously at the suggestion. "You need to let her explain, Agatha."
    </p>
<p>
     "No!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes!" Lilia insisted. "But not now. You’re too hurt for that, it’ll just turn into a fight."
    </p>
<p>
     "I’m going to fire her." Agatha said angrily.
    </p>
<p>
     "You’re not."
    </p>
<p>
     "She’s broken at least a dozen company rules!" Agatha stood up and began pacing back and forth. "Of course I’m firing her."
    </p>
<p>
     "What she did was unethical, I agree. And you probably have legal grounds to fire her." Lilia watched her closely, trying to calm her friend. "But now you’re the face of a sexual scandal involving one of the richest billionaires on the planet, with your ex-wife on the other side of the table. Do you really want to risk your relationship with Rio becoming tabloid fodder?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a frustrated scream.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia was right, of course. Agatha knew how the tabloids fed on scandals, especially involving high-class people. And the idea of her relationship with Rio becoming the subject of celebrity gossip magazines was something she wanted to avoid at all costs.
    </p>
<p>
     Sighing, Agatha leaned back against the couch, sitting down heavily.
    </p>
<p>
     "It’s not fair." Agatha whispered, defeated. "She violated my privacy."
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia let her lament for another hour, giving Agatha another cup of tea and watching her cry until she fell asleep in one of the guest rooms.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t sleep that night. Overcome with nervousness and anxiety, she called and messaged her boss for hours, receiving only deafening silence on the other side. She arrived at the office early, as usual, hoping to find Agatha and hear that everything had just been a prank.
    </p>
<p>
     They would be fine, they’d kiss, and everything would blow over.
    </p>
<p>
     But Agatha didn’t show up before their usual morning meeting, nor did she appear when the office opened for business. In fact, Agatha didn’t show up at all during the morning. Rio knew this because she spent the entire time in her cubicle pretending to work while she spied on her boss's office.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think Agatha found out." Rio said casually during lunch with her friends. The burrito she had bought was still untouched while she observed people walking back and forth in front of the company.
    </p>
<p>
     "What?!" Jen exclaimed nervously, nearly choking.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you going to eat that?" Alice asked, her mouth full. Rio handed the burrito to her friend and looked disgusted; she hadn’t been able to to put anything in her stomach since the night before.
    </p>
<p>
     "She called me a psychopath last night, told me to stay away from her." Rio sighed heavily. "She hasn’t texted me since."
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you think she knows it was us?" Alice asked, her voice soft and concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio furrowed her brow, the thought making her even more anxious.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don’t know about you two, but she doesn’t want to have anything to do with me." She replied worriedly.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen frowned, resting her chin in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "But how did she figure out it was you?"
    </p>
<p>
     "No idea." Rio shrugged, discouraged.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you access the profile through the office’s server?" Alice asked suspiciously, to which Rio just made a face. "How stupid are you, Rio! Why didn’t you delete that profile last week?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Because I’m an idiot and forgot!"
    </p>
<p>
     They slowly started heading back to the office, managing to catch an empty elevator.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you think she hates me?" Rio asked, anxious.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes." Both answered in unison.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at them with a suspicious look, but couldn’t help letting out a sad laugh. Her heart nearly stopped when the elevator door was held open by a hand with carefully manicured nails, which she recognized all too well. When Agatha Harkness joined them in the elevator, all three women held their breath.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ms. Wu, I need you to be the lead attorney in the Stark case today. It’s just routine, nothing complicated. Unfortunately, I’ll be absent for the rest of the afternoon." Agatha wore sunglasses that hid most of her face, a knee-length coat, and her hair didn’t look as perfectly styled as usual. Rio noticed the woman’s hand trembling as she held her purse. "Kale, you’ll be my legal assistant on the case. It’ll be an exhausting few weeks, so be prepared."
    </p>
<p>
     "I’m always the assistant on your cases." Rio murmured, upset.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you hear anything?" Agatha said irritably as the elevator finally opened. "This office must be full of flies, I’ll have it fumigated."
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha hurried out of the elevator, Rio struggled to keep up behind her. As they walked through the employees and associates, a few whispers and giggles followed Agatha, but she held her head high, seeming immune to it all.
    </p>
<p>
     "We need to talk." Rio whispered, running after Agatha down the hall.
    </p>
<p>
     "Leave me alone." Agatha muttered through clenched teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Leave me alone!" She shouted, turning to face Rio, drawing the attention of other employees.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio froze at the sudden outburst from her boss. The workers watching tried to hide it, but couldn’t suppress their curiosity about what would happen next.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha realized she had attracted unwanted attention, she composed herself, adjusting her coat and straightening her back. Rio gently pushed her towards her office, closing the door and the blinds to shield them from curious eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "You need to let me explain." Rio leaned against the door, desperation evident in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "Explain what exactly, Vidal?" Agatha collapsed into the chair, her purse sliding to the floor as she removed her sunglasses and covered her face with her hands. "Or should I say Ralph?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed hard, Agatha's words clearly outlining the situation. As Agatha breathed deeply, trying to regain her composure, she searched for the right words to explain herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha, it was just a silly joke..." Rio started defensively, her voice breaking with the tension.
    </p>
<p>
     "I’m sure you had a great laugh." Agatha said with a choked voice, her hands slipping, revealing her tear-streaked face. Her eyes were swollen and red, still tearful, showing she had spent the night crying. It was only then that Rio realized the damage she had caused. "You had fun when you had me in your apartment? Was that your plan the whole time?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio froze, desperation overtaking her as she realized the extent of her actions. The weight of guilt was unbearable, and she couldn’t speak.
    </p>
<p>
     "It wasn’t supposed to be like this..." Rio whispered, avoiding Agatha’s intense gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a bitter laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "It’s too late for regrets, Rio." Agatha wiped away a few stray tears. "I told you not to make me regret this. Why did you do this to me?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio remained silent, feeling the heavy weight of guilt settle in. Her hands trembled, a sign of the anxiety that gnawed at her insides. She wanted to explain, to apologize.
    </p>
<p>
     "I-I was drunk when I made the profile..." Rio finally found the courage to speak, her voice trembling. "Not that it excuses anything. It started as a joke, but after a while, things got intense. I really enjoyed our conversations, Agatha. I was afraid you wouldn’t be interested in me if I wasn’t Ralph."
    </p>
<p>
     "And the bar? Was that planned too?" Agatha asked flatly, to which Rio simply nodded. "You disgust me."
    </p>
<p>
     "That’s cruel, Agatha." Rio finally raised her eyes to meet her. “I wasn't planning on falling in love with you, but it happened.”
    </p>
<p>
     "Love means nothing without responsibility."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared deeply at Rio, as though stripping away every layer of emotion.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed her eyes, frustration mingling with the sadness in her heart. She had ruined everything.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know I’m wrong, I know! But you have to understand... I didn’t want to do this! I didn’t want to deceive you. I thought it would be fun. I never imagined I would hurt anyone." Rio tried to explain, her words coming out amid a controlled sob.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, ignoring Rio’s suffering entirely.
    </p>
<p>
     "The only reason you’re not being fired is because I made the stupid mistake of letting myself get involved." Agatha turned to her computer to begin working. "And I don’t know what you’d accuse me of if you left the company."
    </p>
<p>
     "I would never accuse you of anything!" Rio retorted, horrified.
    </p>
<p>
     "Forgive me for not believing anything that comes out of your mouth." Agatha dismissed her with a wave of her hand, not daring to look at Rio again. "Get out of here."

      The hours spent inside the office were becoming an excruciating torture for Rio as the days went by. There were no more stolen moments before the workday began, no more cases to be solved together, and definitely no more overtime that turned into everything but work.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The lack of interaction between them was becoming increasingly obvious, and although Rio tried to convince herself that she didn't care, a dull pain had settled in her chest. The hallways, once filled with spicy interactions and playful jokes, were now unnervingly quiet.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She even missed the arrogant look and elitist comments Agatha used to throw at her before they got romantically involved. Anything was better than the unshakable silence coming from her boss.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio had tried to talk to Agatha several times, hoping for an honest conversation, but she was always met with the same cold, indifferent gaze. It was as though she were a complete stranger, not someone with whom Agatha had shared intimate moments. It was painful to realize that Agatha could erase her feelings so quickly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then there was the fake profile, Ralph, always there in the background. Now it was like an elephant in the conference room. Always present, but never directly addressed.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat at her desk, her fingers drumming in frustration as she tried to focus on her work. Her mood was awful, which was unusual for her. Her coworkers cast cautious glances at the legal assistant, knowing that something was wrong.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nick’s head appeared first before he hopped into the cubicle and gave Rio a loud kiss on the cheek.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You screw things up, right?" Nicholas grabbed an empty chair and sat near the desk, tossing his backpack onto it.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Did she tell you?" Rio spun her chair around to face the teenager.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "No." He pulled out a pencil and notebook from his bag, starting to doodle. "But she was almost crying in the car when she dropped me off at home that day. What did you do?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed deeply, frustration still hanging over her. She leaned back in her chair, watching him sketch on the paper, knowing Nicholas would give her an honest opinion.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I did something stupid, Nick," she started explaining, her eyes downcast. "I created a fake profile to get closer to her, but things got out of hand."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas looked up at her, raising his eyebrows in focus.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Even I know that was a dumb idea."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio closed her eyes, feeling even more stupid for hearing the truth from someone younger than her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Thanks for the slap in the face, Nicholas." Rio said sarcastically, opening her eyes again. "And now she hates me."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "She doesn’t hate you." He turned his attention back to the notebook, continuing to doodle. "If she hated you, she wouldn’t have been so upset."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At that moment, several employees passed by carrying boxes with the Stark Industries logo.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "What’s that?" Nicholas asked, curious.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "They’re trying to bury us in paperwork." Rio sighed heavily. She wanted to help Agatha with the case, but the woman wouldn’t even let her get close. "The opposition does this when they want to mess things up. They send more paperwork than necessary, so we waste time looking for what we really need."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas furrowed his brow.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Why would anyone do that? It seems like a waste of time."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It’s not a waste of time for them. While we’re busy with all this irrelevant stuff, we might not have time to deal with important things. It’s a dirty trick, but effective."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio caught a glimpse of her friend Jen approaching, excited. She stopped at the cubicle door and showed a video of a blonde woman.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Abby’s in town." Jen said with a smile. "We’re going out tonight, and you’ll forget about that witch boss."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas made a face, irritated.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Agatha’s not a witch. The both of them just had a fight, and they’ll be back together soon!" He dropped the pencil on the table, annoyed at the idea of Rio going out with someone else.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And who are you?" Jen placed her hands on her hips, outraged by the boy’s interruption.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I’m Agatha’s son."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt a lump form in her throat as she watched the expectation on Nichola1s face, her eyes filled with compassion for the teenager. She knew how much he wanted to be adopted, and maybe he was projecting something onto Agatha that wasn’t real. It wasn’t uncommon for orphaned children to latch onto adults who goy close to them, sometimes deluding them with promises of a permanent home, and then disappearing. It had happened to Rio many times; she just hoped that wasn’t the case with Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Agatha doesn’t have any kids." Jen turned back to Rio. "Anyway, she dumped you, and you need to get over it. I’ve already set up to meet Abby at Road’s tonight."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio heard the unmistakable sound of Agatha’s heels as she walked down the hallway and looked incredulously at the small crowd that had gathered around the assistant.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Am I paying you’ll to chat?" Agatha said in her usual irritated tone. "And Nicholas, I told you that you could do your homework in my office. This is not my office."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen dispersed as quickly as possible at the approach of their boss, while Nicholas gathered his things and muttered as he left the cubicle.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I just wanted to talk to Rio." He mumbled, dragging his feet.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And you," Agatha turned to face Rio after days of silent treatment, "since you have time to plan dates with your many girlfriends, you can catalog the Stark Industries files."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Agatha, there are at least fifty boxes on the case!" Rio exclaimed, frustrated. "It’ll take forever."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Perfect, it’ll give you time to think about your actions."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That night, Rio gave in to her friend’s requests. She put aside the file cataloging and joined them at a bar across from the office. Even though she wasn’t in the mood to celebrate, she tried to muster some energy seeing Abby. They’d known each other since childhood, and it was with Abby that Rio discovered her attraction to women. First kiss, first fuck, first crush. Despite their relationship not working out, they had maintained a friends-with-benefits situation over the years.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took a swig of cold beer, the bitter taste of the drink contrasting sharply with the fire building inside her. As she watched Abby laughing loudly at one of Jen’s jokes, Rio felt a mix of attraction and disappointment in her chest. Abby seemed so carefree, the complete opposite of the emotional abyss Rio was falling into.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She glanced over at Alice, the only one not drinking. While the others were slightly tipsy, Alice still seemed in control. However, Rio noticed Alice was looking at Abby with a thoughtful expression, as though wanting to say something but unsure.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "What’s up?" Rio asked her friend.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I know you’re hurt and probably furious with Agatha for not even looking at you," Alice said carefully, "but are you sure Abby’s the answer to this?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let out a frustrated sigh, her hand shaking slightly as she held the half-empty bottle. She looked again at Abby, her laughter like a knife to Rio’s mind.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I don’t want her to be the solution. But look at her, Alice. She doesn’t have problems. She’s free." Rio replied, frustration evident in her voice, her vision slightly blurred from the alcohol.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "So what? You’re in love with Agatha, and if it were easy, it wouldn’t be worth it."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "She hates me." Rio blurted out, mortified.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "She’s hurt, and rightfully so." Alice pointed out the situation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Are you going to judge me too?" Rio said, irritated, finishing the rest of her beer.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Stop being so defensive all the time, I’m on your side." Alice changed her tone to match Rio’s. "You’ve spent so long running from your own feelings that now you don’t know how to act."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I was better off when I didn’t have any feelings."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Don’t make another mistake you’ll regret!" Alice tried to warn her, but Rio walked determinedly towards the dance floor.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The music’s sound pulsed as Rio pulled Abby into a hug, letting the rhythm of the melody control her movements. But as they danced together, a pang of guilt flooded Rio’s heart. The image of her boss, Agatha, came back with force, reminding her of the situation she had caused.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tried to push those thoughts away, focusing on the energy of the dance floor. But the shadow of guilt remained, reminding her of the consequences of her actions. She pulled Abby closer, kissing her awkwardly, a futile attempt to erase Agatha from her mind.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s hands slid down Abby’s waist as the kiss deepened, but the image of Agatha lingered in her mind. Each movement, each touch seemed to amplify the guilt that consumed her. Rio closed her eyes, trying to focus only on Abby’s warm skin against hers, but she could even hear Agatha’s voice whispering her name, tormenting her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Vidal!" Rio heard again, pulling away from the kiss in shock and facing her boss. "Can we talk outside?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stood just a few feet away, with a stern expression and piercing eyes locked onto Rio. The words echoed in Rio’s mind, amplifying her guilt.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She nodded awkwardly, still under the effects of the alcohol, and pulled away from Abby’s embrace. Rio followed Agatha out to the bar’s outdoor area. The night air was cool, and the lights outside were soft, but that did nothing to ease the tension.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I can explain." Rio said once they were finally alone.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I don’t care." Agatha said wearily, turning to face the assistant with a fragile expression. "When was the last time you saw Nick?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "This afternoon when you took him." Rio said, worried, sensing the situation was serious. "What happened?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I just got a call from his foster home." Agatha whispered. "Nick didn’t come home after he left the office."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took two steps forward, closing the distance between them, resting her hands on her boss’s shoulders and pulling her close. Agatha didn’t push her away as usual; instead, she rested her head on Rio’s chest and let herself be comforted.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It’s my fault." Agatha cursed softly against Rio’s body. "I was so focused on the case that I didn’t have time to take him home, I just told him to take a taxi. I thought maybe he was with you, so I came here."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It’s not your fault, Agatha." Rio gently ran her hands down the woman’s back, trying to calm her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Do you think he ran away?" Agatha clung to Rio, seeking comfort.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "We’ll find him." Rio said nervously, trying to avoid answering the question.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha broke the hug and looked at the assistant.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I don’t want to get in the way, you’re in the middle of a date..."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Agatha," Rio interrupted, reaching for her hand and intertwining their fingers, "you two are more important. We’ll find him."
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      Agatha sat anxiously in the passenger seat, scanning the streets of New York through the window, her mind a whirlwind of thoughts. She had never been religious, but she silently prayed that Nick would just appear out of the ground.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio noticed the tension in Agatha’s body as the city lights sped by: a frantic dance of colors that echoed the shared anguish between them. Rio’s strong hand didn’t let go of Agatha’s, as if her touch were a desperate link, the only anchor in the storm of emotions surrounding them. She divided her attention between the road and the lawyer, well aware that this didn’t mean forgiveness, nor that things were better between them, but all she could think about was Nick and how to help Agatha.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The first stop was at the bus station, where Rio ran back and forth for an hour, showing a photo of Nicky on her phone, asking every stranger passing by if anyone had seen the boy. Agatha spent the entire time on her phone, speaking to Mr. Hart and all the other police stations she could remember, trying to find out if anyone matching the description of the teenager had been apprehended.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "He didn’t pass through here." Rio said as they got back in the car and she slowly started driving.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha remained silent for a while, trying to absorb the news without breaking down. She leaned back in the car seat, utterly exhausted, and closed her eyes for a moment, catching her breath as though seeking strength from the darkness she found herself in.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Now what?" she asked, almost as a whisper full of frustration.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "We checked the bus station, and no one at the police has picked up a boy with his description." Rio said, her voice stoic as she kept her eyes on the road ahead. "Maybe he didn’t run away. Maybe… something happened."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out a heavy sigh upon hearing Rio’s words, her throat tightening and a shiver running down her spine. It was hard to face the possibility that something had happened to Nicky, but she could no longer run from the reality.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "What else can we do?" she asked, her voice trembling.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "We should check the hospitals." Rio said, making a turn and changing direction. "When we find Nicky..."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "If we find him." Agatha whispered.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "When we find him," Rio repeated, emphasizing the phrase "he’ll be okay, and all of this will have just been a big scare. What will you do then?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha frowned, turning her head slightly to face her assistant.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "What do you mean?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "He’s attached to you, Agatha." Rio let out a small sigh. "He’s said twice that you were his mother, once to the security guard and once to Jennifer Kale. Are you planning to adopt him? Because he’s getting his hopes up."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s question hit Agatha with an unexpected force. She hesitated briefly before answering, her eyes searching for a way to explain the complexity of her feelings without giving too much away.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I don’t know, Rio." she said, her expression vulnerable. "I’ve always wanted to be a mother, but my family history was never the best. My mom..." Agatha hesitated for a moment but decided to confess. "My mom suffocated me my whole life. She dictated which college I should attend, what career I should pursue, even which friends I should have. She hated my appearance and made me hate myself for years. My nose, my weight, my body. Eeerything. When I married Wanda, it was a nightmare. Every Christmas, she pretended we were just friends and tried to set me up with some man. And still, I would do anything for her approval." Agatha wiped away a tear that escaped. "What if I adopt Nick and end up being a terrible mother, just like she was?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio watched Agatha carefully, her words echoing in her chest. She could see the vulnerability in Agatha’s voice, the pain she had carried for many years. It was the first time Agatha spoke about her family with her assistant, revealing a different side of herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I think you’d be a great mom." Rio said, her hand reaching out to hold Agatha’s arm in a comforting gesture. "Your mother’s mistakes are just hers, and you learned from them. You wouldn’t be perfect, no one is, but Nicky would be lucky to have you as his mom."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "How can you be so wise about some things and so dumb about others?" Agatha gave a small smile.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It’s my charm." Rio shrugged, letting out a laugh. "Here we are." she said to Agatha as she parked the car in front of the hospital.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They walked toward the building, the white walls and clinical atmosphere contrasting with their mood. The sound of their footsteps echoed as Agatha tried to sort her thoughts.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A friendly nurse named Ann Perkins greeted them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "We’re looking for a boy. He’s fourteen, has brown hair and eyes. Talks more than he should." Rio began to describe him to the woman.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Nicholas Scratch." Agatha leaned anxiously over the counter. "Do you have anyone by that name here?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "No." she replied calmly, dashing Agatha’s hopes. "But we did receive a teenager with that description a few hours ago, though he refuses to give a name. Are you his mothers?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I... I am the..." Agatha looked at Rio with a distressed glance.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "She’s his legal guardian." Rio lied outright, then squeezed Agatha’s hand.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Ann looked at them suspiciously but nodded.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Follow me." She began to guide them toward the infirmary.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The two women followed the nurse down the hallway. The bright lights and the sounds of hospital equipment echoed down the ward, reminding Agatha of the fragility of life. Her mind was in turmoil as they approached the infirmary.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they entered, a thin boy with light brown eyes sat up on the bed. He had a playful expression and an restless energy that didn’t go unnoticed.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Agatha! Rio!" The boy jumped up on the bed, smiling when they appeared, but quickly lay down again, groaning in pain. His face was covered with bruises, he had stitches on his eyebrow, and his arm was in a sling.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Nicky! I was so worried!" Agatha rushed to him and pulled the boy into a hug, running her hands over Nicholas’s arms to make sure everything was in place.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Ouch, calm down! I’m all broken up."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "What happened to you, kid?" Rio asked, leaning on the side of the bed, her face more relieved.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I got hit by a bike." Nicholas answered, embarrassed.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t help but laugh loudly, receiving a disapproving look from Agatha.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Is he okay? Can we take him home?" Agatha turned to the nurse, concerned.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Besides a few scratches and a broken arm, Nicholas is going to survive." Ann gave them a reassuring smile. "Just sign the discharge papers, and he’ll be released."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They exchanged relieved looks, the tension in their shoulders easing. Ann disappeared through the door, leaving them alone with the boy. Rio watched the scene as the boy scrunched his nose, trying to look stronger than he actually was.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It’s worse for the ego to get hit by a bike than by a motorcycle." He said with a dramatic sigh.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, but it was clear that the relief of knowing the boy wasn’t in danger was immense.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Don’t make a joke out of this. You could have gotten hurt a lot worse. Was that bike driver not looking where he wasgoing?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I might have crossed outside the crosswalk."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You can’t act like that, it’s dangerous." She retorted, crossing her arms. "Why didn’t you tell the nurse your name? Rio and I could have found you much sooner."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I didn’t want to bother anyone." Nick shrugged, resting his head on the pillow.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "We’ve searched half of New York for you." Rio pointed out with a concerned tone.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You’re not bothering, Nick." Agatha gave him a fond look and stood up. "I’ll sign your release papers and call Mrs. Hart, let her know you’re okay and staying at my place for the night. Can you take him to my car?" she asked, turning to Rio.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Let’s go, kid, try not to get hit by a bike on the way to the parking lot."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Very funny." Nick struggled to get up. "Can Rio spend the night too?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes, can Rio spend the night too?" Rio repeated the question with a smile on her face as she looked at her boss.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Sure." Agatha measured her from head to toe, immediately remembering she should be furious with the assistant. "Rio can sleep on the couch."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha shot an arrogant look at Rio, while Nick let out a muffled laugh, clearly finding humor in the situation. The young assistant crossed her arms, unfazed by her boss’s look.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Oh, how generous of you." Rio replied, her voice full of sarcasm. "I’ll be deeply honored to spend the night on your comfortable couch."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nick broke into a wide grin, and with Rio’s help, he left the infirmary. The walk to the parking lot was slow and full of complaints from the boy about the stitches in his leg. When they reached Agatha’s car, Nick was settled in the back seat with a sigh of relief.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Rio drove, Nick took the opportunity to curl up in the corner of the seat, closing his eyes and allowing himself to relax. Agatha, from the front seat, watched the scene with a small, sweet smile.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they arrived at the condo, Rio entered the elevator that led to Agatha’s penthouse, her heart racing with a mix of expectation and nervousness.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The walls of the elevator were mirrored, reflecting her nervous image. When the doors finally opened, they found themselves before an impressive view.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s apartment was a showcase of luxury and elegance. The spacious entrance led to a large living room with high ceilings, adorned with sophisticated décor.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Wow!" Nick exclaimed, looking at the ceiling.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Come on, Nick." Agatha kicked off her heels and left them by the entrance, ignoring the stunned looks from the two of them. "I’ll show you your room."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As soon as Agatha left to put Nicholas to bed, Rio took the opportunity to explore the luxurious penthouse. The feeling of being in forbidden territory only heightened the adrenaline coursing through her body.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Carefully, she entered the master bedroom, her footsteps quiet and deliberate. The walls were covered in light gray wallpaper, and a large closet with a private bathroom extended at the back of the room. The view of the city was breathtaking, but what caught the assistant’s attention was the king-size bed with soft linens and feather pillows. Rio sat comfortably and waited for her boss to return.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "My God, you’re so nosy." Agatha said as she entered the room fifteen minutes later, heading for the bathroom to take off her gold earrings and leave them on the vanity. "Nick finally fell asleep."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Is he calmer?" Rio followed and stood behind Agatha, staring at her through the mirror. Agatha nodded positively. "Great, can we talk about us now?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, taking off her blazer and blouse, throwing them on the floor, leaving only her bra and a high-waisted pencil skirt. She immediately caught Rio’s lecherous gaze on her body.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Want to talk about the girl you were kissing at the bar today? While you were making love promises to me last week?" Agatha said with her usual acidic tone, the friendly demeanor from earlier now gone.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It wasn’t her I wanted to kiss." Rio moved behind her, wrapping her arms around her waist and hugging her. "It was you."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha closed her eyes for a second, letting herself be swept up in the tension that always surrounded them when they were alone.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You have a strange way of showing it." She turned to face Rio, their mouths just inches apart. She gently ran her fingertips through Rio’s hair, allowing herself to get lost there.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I miss you." Rio whispered against Agatha’s lips. "Don’t you miss me?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let her eyes roam over Rio’s face, analyzing every subtle expression. Every cell in her body begged her to give in to temptation and let her assistant take her right then and there, without shame. But her rational side took over, and she pulled away.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I’m not ready to forgive you, at least not yet. I’m sorry."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I understand." Rio nodded, her head bowed.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You can sleep in one of the guest rooms tonight, but only for tonight." Agatha watched as the assistant left the room.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Agatha," Rio stopped at the doorframe, one last look before she left "I won’t give up. I’ll win you back."
     </span>

<p>
<span>
      Agatha paced around the conference room with her nerves on the edge. She carefully watched as Jennifer Kale transcribed Christine Everhart’s testimony—until then, the supposed victim of Tony Stark—onto the company’s laptop.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Again.” Agatha crossed her arms, unsatisfied, her shoulder muscles stiff with worry.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How many times are we going to have to do this?” Christine complained. She reached into her purse for a small makeup mirror and held it up to her mouth, checking her perfectly aligned white teeth. Agatha almost screamed in frustration at the woman’s lack of interest in her own case.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How many times it takes. You’re nowhere near ready to face Wanda in an interrogation.” Agatha snatched the mirror from Christine’s hand and threw it to the other side of the table. “Do you think this is a joke? Your face is all over gossip websites, got it? You’re the one the public is judging as the gold digger.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Christine gave a small, smug smile at the mention of the media.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So everyone knows?” She quickly became serious, changing her expression when Agatha’s suspicious gaze landed on her. “I mean, they know what he did to me.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “When did you two meet?” Agatha asked for the third time that day.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Two years ago, I was his assistant.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And when did the relationship start?” Agatha lowered her head, examining the file.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hmmm...” Christine paused for a few seconds. “A few months later, he asked me to work overtime, and days later, he asked again.” She chuckled loudly. “You know how these things work.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At that moment, Rio Vidal walked past the hallway. Agatha took her time admiring the assistant through the glass wall, her heart racing. Nick was right behind, carrying a box from Stark Industries. He now spent every afternoon after school in the office, usually chasing after Rio or doing homework in Agatha’s office. He waved enthusiastically at the lawyer, who responded with a gentle smile.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sighed and turned her attention back to Christine.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, I don’t know.” She answered dryly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Christine gave a sarcastic laugh, clearly enjoying the situation. She leaned back in her chair, visibly entertained as Agatha stared at her with an impatient gaze.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Come on. You know how it goes. A little chat, some drinks, a glance here, a glance there…”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes, irritated by the implied suggestion.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How long did your relationship with Tony Stark last?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A little over a year.” Christine shrugged disinterestedly. “I was already wanting to break up with him, but we took a “business trip” to London” She moved her hands making a quotation marks movement “if you know what I mean. The trip was great, I can't deny it. Ah, all the fancy restaurants and designer clothes. Then I broke up with him. Ugh, very possessive. A few days later, I was fired! This is sexual harassment, right?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” Agatha lifted her eyes and pushed a report from the file toward the woman. “But this is your performance review, one month before your firing. You didn’t score very well. Isn’t it true you were fired for being a terrible employee, not because of your relationship?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Christine furrowed her brow, clearly shaken by Agatha’s words. She stared at the paper for a few seconds, then her face flushed with anger.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s a lie! I was a dedicated employee!”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, maintaining her calm, crossed her arms.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You were often late, didn’t meet any of your production goals, and received numerous complaints from coworkers and clients.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You can’t ask me those things!” Christine raised an accusing finger at Agatha.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s exactly the kind of thing Wanda Maximoff will ask you, and I’m still being kind.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then you find a way to beat this woman.” Christine grabbed her purse nervously and stormed out of the room.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “What a hell of a day.”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      Agatha thought, staring at the closed door of the room, watching her client leave in anger. She took a deep breath, trying to steady the accumulated frustration inside her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She quickly walked to her office, still reflecting on the meeting with her client. The door was slightly open, and through the gap, she spotted Nicholas sitting at her desk, deeply focused on his homework. She knocked twice, surprising him.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good afternoon, lawyer. Are you the owner of the company?” Agatha said in a playful tone, smiling.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, I am.” Nicholas sprawled his arm over the chair confidently. “How can I help you?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Come here.” Agatha extended her right hand and motioned for him to come closer. “Give me a hug.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas immediately jumped out of the chair and ran to her, wrapping his arms around her in a tender hug. As she stroked his hair, Agatha instantly felt a sense of relaxation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have something important to ask you.” Agatha’s tone was serious as she pulled the teenager to sit next to her on the office couch.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas nodded, placing his hands on his knees, his eyes alert and eager.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha gently caressed the boy’s bruised arm while gazing at his youthful face. Amid the chaos and stress of her work, the boy had become a refuge, a reminder of simplicity amidst the complexity of her professional world.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What would you think about living with me temporarily?” Agatha asked, a bit unsure. “Instead of with that elderly couple.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas looked at her for a few seconds, his expression shocked and confused but filled with hope. He lowered his head, trying to process the question.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You don’t have to decide right away.” She hesitated for a moment, unsure. “But I’d like you to live with me. I can take care of you.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her heart calmed when Nicholas pulled her into another tight hug, not caring about the various bruises still covering his body.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s all I’ve ever wanted,” he replied, his voice thick with emotion.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha found herself hugging the boy back, her arms wrapping around him protectively. She could feel the tension of the last few days slipping away as she pulled him closer.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How about we go out for dinner and celebrate tonight?” Her voice was gentle. “I can call Mrs. Hart, I’m sure she won’t mind you spending the night at my place.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Great!” Nicholas jumped up, a huge smile spreading across his face. “In the meantime, I’ll invite Rio.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No!” Agatha immediately stopped him. “Nicholas, I know what you’re trying to do. You can’t keep dragging Rio back and forth to force us to spend time together.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But you two like each other.” He dragged his feet back and let his body fall onto the couch. “I know Rio made a stupid mistake, but she’s trying to apologize.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is she?” Agatha raised an eyebrow.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She spent the whole night helping you look for me, didn’t she?” Nicholas narrowed his eyes at her. “Did you even thank her?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha hesitated, struggling with her mixed feelings about Rio. On one hand, she was deeply annoyed by the assistant’s mistake. But on the other hand, she couldn’t deny the valuable help she’d provided.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No.” Agatha admitted guiltily. “Alright, go invite her!”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas kissed Agatha’s cheek with a loud smack, quickly leaving the office to look for the assistant.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As he walked away, Agatha leaned back on the couch, closing her eyes for a moment, trying to organize her thoughts. All she wanted was to put her company in order, but Rio seemed to be an unpredictable element that kept interfering with her plans.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha chose a cozy Italian restaurant in the heart of New York, just as the afternoon sun began to set on the horizon. The atmosphere was familiar and welcoming, with soft lights and candles spread across the rustic wooden tables.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha sat first, her expression slightly tense as she scanned the menu. Nicholas and Rio followed, each taking a seat at the small table.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you for inviting me,” Rio whispered beside Agatha, a hopeful look on her face.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I should be thanking you, for helping me that night with Nicky.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s gratitude was evident in her small gesture of acknowledgment, a brief nod accompanied by a smile. While waiting for their orders, Rio and Agatha engaged in light conversation, with an air of casualness, but there was a palpable tension in the air, while Nicholas distracted himself with a game machine in the back of the restaurant.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I asked him if he wanted to live with me.” Agatha said with a smile on her face while watching the teenager from a distance.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt a pang in her chest as she watched Nicholas engrossed in the game. The relationship between Agatha and Nicholas was a constant reminder of her own history of abandonment. However, she smiled gently, keeping her face neutral.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I imagine he got excited about the news.” Rio replied casually, trying to ignore the memories that were surfacing in her mind.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He said yes.” Agatha turned her affectionate gaze toward Rio. “I think I’m ready. I can be a good mother to him. Like you said, I’m not the mistakes my mother made.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m proud of you.” Rio reached out to hold Agatha’s hand, but was immediately rejected.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sorry, I don’t…”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s okay.” Rio forced an uncomfortable smile.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When the waiter served their orders and Nicholas returned to the table, the mood lightened again. The boy talked nonstop, sharing details about how school was going and how he was finally making friends.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And if I live with Agatha,” he spoke excitedly with his mouth full of pasta, “I mean, I won’t starve again. So I won’t have to run away, and I can stay at the same school for more than a month. Isn’t that awesome?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn’t help but laugh at how cheerful the boy was about the situation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nicholas, chew with your mouth closed.” Agatha offered him a napkin, noticing his dirty face.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, how’s the case going?” Rio turned to her boss, referring to the billionaire who was occupying all of Agatha’s time.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ugh.” Agatha took a sip of wine. “I’m seriously considering making a deal.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You making a deal? That’s strange.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know,” she rolled her eyes slightly, “but if you saw the witness, you’d agree with me. The woman seemed more interested in reliving some business trip to London with Tony Stark than giving me anything concrete to build a defense.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “London?” Rio repeated, thinking hard. She was sure there was something in the files she had been going through about a trip to London. “I’ll check the files again. Maybe there’s something about that trip that could help you.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That would be very helpful.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know, I could’ve found this much sooner if you had picked me as your assistant.” Rio couldn’t help teasing.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ah, Vidal. You deserved to be cut off.” Agatha gave her a mischievous look and a wink while sipping her wine.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They spent the rest of the evening laughing and chatting lightly, with Nicholas occasionally making jokes to distract them and Rio making small advances towards Agatha, who ignored them pointedly. As Agatha paid the bill, Rio and Nicholas stopped on the sidewalk, watching the cold New York night.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is for you.” He pulled a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to Rio. “It’s a list of things I found out about Agatha.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And what am I supposed to do with this?” Rio examined the paper carefully.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Make her fall in love with you again, obviously.” Nicholas pointed to the first item on the list. “See? Her favorite flowers are azaleas.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s the most cliché thing in the world, kid.” Rio scoffed but pocketed the list anyway.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Clichés are clichés because they work.” Nicholas raised his finger in a thumbs-up. “Just stop messing up and follow the list, and she’ll forgive you. I’ve done half the work for you.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave him an incredulous look.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If this works, you’re a genius. If it doesn’t, I’ll break your other arm.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha approached the two of them, her expression tired but happy. Nicholas gave Rio an enthusiastic hug, thanking her for joining them. From Agatha, she only received a distant wave before they both left, but Rio couldn’t help but feel filled with hope. She was sure she was on the right track to win back her boss.

     Azaleas

<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
<span>
      It was a Thursday with little to no sun when Rio stopped in front of her boss Lilia Calderu's office, holding two cups of hot coffee. One of them was carefully wrapped in a small purple azalea, tied around the plastic.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio could see Calderu through the glass door of her office, her stern gaze as she checked the documents on her desk. Before entering, Rio took a deep breath, trying to gather the courage to face the request she needed to make.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Without hesitation, she knocked on the open door and entered the room, placing the coffees on the desk.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I came to spare you the trip to the coffee shop." Rio offered with a gentle smile.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I’ll assume this one isn’t for me." Lilia pointed at the cup adorned with the small azalea.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Oh, no. This one's for Agatha." Rio gave an awkward laugh, trying to break the tension, and felt her cheeks flush. "I mean, for Miss Harkness."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Uh-huh." Lilia picked up the other cup of coffee, took a sip savoring the espresso, and gestured for Rio to sit down. "What can I do for you, Vidal?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat in the chair, her mouth suddenly dry. She had mentally rehearsed what she was going to say dozens of times, but now, in Lilia's presence, everything felt vague and confusing.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I'm assuming you know about Agatha and me." Her voice sounded shakier than she had planned. "Since you two are best friends."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia leaned back in the chair, studying Rio with a look that the younger woman couldn’t decipher. It seemed like she was searching for something on Rio’s face, something she couldn’t quite identify.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes, I know about you two." Lilia finally replied, her simple statement carrying a heavy weight between them. "Agatha told me everything."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "So, she told you what I did?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Girl," Lilia tilted her head slightly with a touch of mockery. The fragile image of Agatha from that night was still vivid in her memory. "Who do you think wiped her tears?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt a lump form in her throat at that mention The image of Agatha, usually so stiff and stoic, dissolving in tears was something she still couldn’t process. The idea that she was responsible for making her boss cry haunted her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nervously fiddled with the hem of her jacket, her eyes fixed on the floor for a moment before summoning the courage to look at Lilia again.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Do you... Do you think there’s a chance she’ll forgive me?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia let out a heavy sigh, crossing her arms in front of her body. A sympathetic expression crossed her face, showing genuine empathy.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Oh, sweetheart, you really have a gift for getting yourself into trouble, don’t you?" A soft laugh escaped her lips before she continued. "Agatha has a softer heart than she let people know, despite her explosive temper. Maybe she’ll forgive you."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio leaned on the desk, absorbing Lilia’s words. The idea of a possible reconciliation sparked a glimmer of hope, and she had the perfect plan, or almost perfect, to make it work.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "In that case," Rio leaned forward, grabbing a post-it and a pen, wrote the address of the Hayden Planetarium, and pushed it towards Lilia. "I know it’s asking a lot, but could you take her to this place tomorrow night? If I ask, Agatha won’t agree. But if it comes from a friend…"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia frowned, suspicious, but couldn’t help the slight curious smile that formed on her lips.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "A date at the planetarium? How clever." She leaned back against the desk, resting her weight on one arm. Her expression became serious. "Alright, I’ll help you. But Rio, if you hurt her again, you’ll have to deal with me, understood?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, speechless. Gratitude bubbled inside her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Thank you, Lilia, really." Rio murmured. "I promise I won’t mess things up again." She tried to sound confident, but couldn’t deny the nervousness that took over her when thinking about the next night.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She quickly left the room, a smile on her face. Agatha’s coffee still warm in her hands, but she had another stop to make before meeting her favorite boss. She walked through the cubicles until she found Jen talking to some other employees, gently apologized, and pulled her friend aside.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I need a favor." Rio whispered, looking around. "A big favor. You know that guy at the planetarium who keeps hitting on you?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "No." Jen immediately closed off. "No way, Rio."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Oh, yes. You owe me for that fake profile. It was your idea, remember?" Rio made sure to rub it in in her face. "I need an hour alone in the planetarium with Agatha, after everyone’s gone."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen rolled her eyes in disgust.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Fine, I’ll get him to let you in."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Thanks!" Rio gave her a tight hug and a kiss on the cheek. "When I marry Agatha, you can be the maid of honor."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She heard Jen’s laughter echo through the office as she walked away. Her friend always reacted in an unnecessarily dramatic way to any request, but Rio knew Jen was loyal to the end. She pulled Nicholas's crumpled list from her pocket and took another look, letting a satisfied smile spread across her face.

</p>
<p>
<span>
      Arriving at her boss’s office, Rio could see Agatha focused behind the desk, looking at her computer, probably making that disapproving face she loved so much.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio lightly knocked on the open door, catching Agatha’s attention, who looked at her with that same superior gaze.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I brought you coffee." Rio said with a simple smile, placing the cup in front of her boss. Agatha couldn’t help but notice the flower wrapped around it.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at the flower, then at Rio, trying to maintain her impassive mask. Even with her stoic expression, a slight flush appeared on her cheeks as she took the flower and gently twirled it between her fingers. With an almost imperceptible sigh, a feeling of vulnerability crept into her eyes.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "How did you know?" The question escaped her, her voice strangely soft.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "A little birdie told me."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "A little birdie named Nicholas, I imagine."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sat in the chair across from her, crossing her legs and resting her arms on the chair’s armrests. A half-smile played on her lips as she observed Agatha’s reaction.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You know I can’t reveal my sources." Rio explained with slight arrogance. She pulled out a file from her bag and pushed it toward her boss. "I knew I’d seen something about London in the Stark files. Christine never went there with Tony Stark, Agatha. She’s lying."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha frowned, took the file, and flipped through the pages. Her eyes scanned every detail, missing nothing. She was always meticulous in her investigations.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "That bitch…" Agatha leaned back in the chair, massaging her temples in frustration. "Now I’m going to have to make a deal."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Sorry you won’t get to clash heads with your ex." Rio said with a twinge of envy, avoiding saying the woman’s name.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It’s not just about that," Agatha closed her eyes for a second, then looked back at her assistant. "People like Christine Everhart are what make it hard for the rest of us women."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I understand. I’m really sorry it didn’t work out, truly." Rio said sincerely.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I better call Wanda, try to make a last-minute deal."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "But that’s it, right?" Rio stared intently at Agatha. "After this, you won’t see your ex anymore, right?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha couldn’t control her laugh and the mischievous smile that formed on her face.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Jealous, Vidal?" She asked ironically.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes, I am." Rio answered with an impassive face. "I told you, I’m possessive."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha laughed again, enjoying the way her assistant spoke so directly. She leaned closer to Rio’s chair, resting her hip on the edge of the desk.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "How toxic, I like that." Agatha teased. "But I’m not yours for you to be so possessive, right?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio got up and gave a small smile, letting her body get dangerously close to Agatha’s, sending an involuntary shiver through her boss. The tension between them was almost magnetic whenever they started with this kind of teasing.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha had to suppress a sigh when Rio’s hand slid across her chin. It was almost embarrassing how much this woman’s touch affected her. She knew she had to stay in control and not let her emotions show, but the intensity Rio exuded was almost irresistible. She hated the lie, hated being deceived, but above all, she hated how easily Rio could disarm her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Aren’t you? Are you sure?" Her ironic tone was unmistakable, present every time Rio wanted to irritate her. "I need to get back to work."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio pulled away with a sly laugh and waved at Agatha before walk through the door, leaving her alone to reflect on her desires.

<p>
<span>
      Agatha sat impatiently across from her ex-wife, her eyes fixed on her slender face while the pen drummed between her fingers and the mahogany desk. Wanda, on the other hand, was impassive, reading the contract in her hands with no hurry, evaluating everything with a smile on her face.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha watched every gesture of her ex-wife with a mixture of frustration and impatience. This meeting was necessary, but she hoped it would be quick and to the point. As the pen tip tapped the mahogany surface of her desk, she thought of a thousand other places she’d rather be at that moment, anywhere but here.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda finally looked up, diverting her gaze from the contract to meet Agatha’s eyes.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Counteroffer,” she said, closing the file quietly and pushing it across to Agatha. “200 thousand, and Christine Everhart signs a non-disclosure agreement.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha suppressed the urge to say something harsh, bit her tongue, and chose to focus on the mechanical movement of her pen, making an effort to stay calm and not strangle Wanda at that very moment.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “500 thousand, and no non-disclosure agreement,” Agatha countered.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda narrowed her eyes, examining Agatha’s expression.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You can’t prove harassment,” she said, a satisfied smile curling on her lips.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Going to court is worse for your client,” Agatha retorted, tossing the pen aside, her face doing its best to remain unreadable. “I’ll drag this out as long as I can, months with his name in the headlines. I’ll use appeal after appeal after appeal. I’ll call in every employee from Stark Industries to testify. And I may lose, but your client will lose far more.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda let out a shrill laugh that filled the room, taking a few good seconds to catch her breath.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, how I’ve missed our arguments. It’s the only thing I miss about our marriage.” She said, an ironic smile adorning her face. “And the sex, of course. You were always very good at it.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha clenched her fists, her face reddening with Wanda’s malicious provocation. But she made an effort to maintain control, leaning back in her chair and crossing her legs.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That didn’t stop you from cheating on me.” Agatha muttered through gritted teeth.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Don’t be a hypocrite, Agatha. It doesn’t suit you.” Wanda’s expression turned serious, almost dark. “We both know our marriage was over long before the cheating. There was no communication, no affection, and certainly no love. At least, not from your side.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked away, the pain preventing her from holding Wanda’s challenging gaze. Her ex-wife’s words were cruel, but they were also true. A mixture of anger and regret churned in her stomach. It was easier to blame Wanda than admit her own flaws.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, maybe our marriage wasn’t perfect, but that doesn’t justify what you did.” Agatha said, her voice faltering for a moment.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re right, but I don’t regret it. It freed both of us from a reality that no longer worked.” Wanda straightened in her chair, reached for her bag, and pulled out a brown envelope, sliding it across the desk to Agatha. “My respect for you is the only thing stopping me from using this, but Tony Stark doesn’t care. 200 thousand, and a non-disclosure agreement. Get your client to sign the deal, and I’ll make this disappear.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda’s words echoed in Agatha’s mind like a wave of resentment threatening to drown her. She watched the envelope land on the table, the weight of its contents almost palpable.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha picked it up, opening it with trembling fingers. Her hands shook as she flipped through photos of herself, Nicholas and Rio having fun at the Italian restaurant. Rio smiling while looking at her, their hands gently touching. It might not mean anything, but in the right narrative, it could ruin her career.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did you have me followed?” Agatha’s voice trembled as she struggled to stay still.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jessica Jones is a great detective, but you already know that.” Wanda smirked sarcastically. “Nice family you’ve got there, Agatha. But sleeping with your assistant? That’s something the board of Harkness &amp; Calderu would love to know. Could cost you your license.” She pulled one of the photos and pointed at Nicholas. “And this boy. What do you think your chances are of adopting him if this goes public?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt bile rise in her throat as Wanda’s words hit her like a brutal attack. The image of her and Rio having fun and apparently more than just colleagues was enough to cause indescribable damage. The photo of Nicholas only worsened everything, amplifying the potentially devastating consequences.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re a snake,” Agatha hissed, her voice full of disgust. “Christine Everhart will sign your deal.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha stormed out of the room, her footsteps quick, matching the rapid beating of her heart. She passed the associate’s offices, the cafeteria, and her friend Lilia Calderu, who tried to catch her attention, inviting her out later. Agatha ignored everyone in her path until she reached Rio’s empty cubicle.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her desperate eyes scanned the area, looking for the assistant. She wanted to hug her, kiss her, hold her close and say she was tired of denying her feelings. That she would go to the board of directors and admit their relationship before someone else did.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      But Rio was nowhere to be found in the company.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was already past business hours when Rio and Jen arrived at the Hayden Planetarium. They walked down a dark hallway leading to the central theater dome, guided by the dim light of a flashlight carried by Scott Lang, one of the guides. Rio walked slowly, carrying a large picnic basket filled with food and wine, along with a tablecloth.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He’s not that bad-looking,” Rio whispered to her friend.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s not that,” Jen whispered back, eyeing the man from a distance. “He’s just not my type.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your type is an adult capable of consenting, Jen. You have no standards.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s not true.” Jen chuckled quietly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So what’s your type then?” Rio asked, curious.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Smart, short, Asian,” Jen replied, looking at her friend and enjoying the incredulous look on Rio’s face.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No fucking way!” Rio gasped, drawing Scott’s attention.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is everything alright, ladies?” he asked. They both gave him a thumbs-up. “We’re here.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He pushed open the door, revealing the huge dome in the Hayden Planetarium’s theater. Rio and Jen walked slowly inside, their footsteps echoing against the empty theater walls. The dome rose majestically before them, resembling the celestial dome where stars and planets were projected. As they got closer, it was impossible not to feel small in the vastness of the starry sky above them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wow, this is incredible!” Jen exclaimed, admiring the setting.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Scott smiled, clearly used to impressing people with this scenario.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, the images are generated from real NASA footage, so it’s a perfectly accurate star show.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And we’ll be completely alone, right?” Rio asked, concerned. “No security cameras, no one spying?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No one comes here at this time of night, and the cameras are just for show. With a place this size, it’s impossible to monitor everything.” He handed the flashlight to Rio. “The show usually lasts twenty minutes, but I’ve set it to repeat. So, you and your date can enjoy the whole night.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio nodded, trying to hide the anxiety she felt. She spread the large blanket in the center of the theater and set the basket down beside it.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What time will Lilia bring Agatha?” she asked.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Any moment now.” Rio replied, her voice touched with insecurity as she carefully surveyed the space. “Do you think she’ll like it?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you kidding me?” Jen playfully slapped her friend’s arm. “This is the perfect first date, there’s no way she won’t love it.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed, even though the nervousness in her chest was growing with each passing minute. The theater was set: the blanket, the basket, the stars gently illuminating the place. It really did seem perfect.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Scott came over again, this time handing Rio a small key.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This is for the back door. Don’t forget that after you lock it, the alarm is triggered, and the door won’t open again until six in the morning.” He offered his arm to Jen with a cheeky smile. “Ready for our date?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen made a face at Rio but gladly took the man’s arm. They left the theater, leaving Rio alone in the starry expanse.

<p>
<span>
      The last few days had been a mix of anger, frustration, and fear inside Agatha Harkness mind. The last time she had felt safe and stable was when she was with Rio and Nicholas at the restaurant. Now, thanks to Wanda, even that memory had been tainted.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once again, she found herself sitting next to Lilia, mulling over her relationships and doubts. Lilia was always reliable, the best and closest friend she could have. Always encouraging when needed and calling her out when necessary.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As her business partner’s car smoothly cruised through the streets of New York, Agatha told her about Wanda and the veiled threat she had received. About her conflicted feelings towards her assistant Rio, how she was ready to forgive her, but at the same time terrified of what that would mean.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "That woman is Satan." Lilia complained loudly, making a sharp turn.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "My God, you're not carrying cattle." Agatha grumbled, gripping the passenger seat tightly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And you're not made of porcelain." Lilia shot back with a smile, making another sharp turn. "My intuition never fails. Since you got involved with that little thing when you two were still associates, I knew that was a wolf in sheep’s clothing."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia had always been the voice of reason in Agatha’s life, the one who advised her in moments of doubt. A safe harbor, a steady presence that anchored her. Now, however, it wasn’t Lilia's presence that filled Agatha's mind and heart the most.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Do you understand now why I need to talk to Rio?" she said quietly, her voice almost a whisper. She ran her fingers over her phone again, trying to call her assistant. Rio wasn’t picking up. "What the hell, where has she gone?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia let out a small laugh.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Oh, darling. We’re here." She parked in the back street of the Hayden Planetarium.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "What are we doing here? It’s already closed." Agatha looked around, but the street was empty. "I thought we were going to get drunk, that’s what I need right now."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Look closer." Lilia pointed to the back door of the planetarium, where a figure holding a lantern was jumping and waving happily in the light drizzle.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha placed her hand on her face in disbelief, laughing at the situation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It is my idiot over there, right?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Exactly." Lilia reached for her friend's hand, placing a gentle kiss on the top of it. "It’s a romantic date, Agatha. She’s really trying to win your forgiveness, and I know you’re dying to take her back. So go on and enjoy, while I figure out how to get rid of that little threat Wanda made."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha got out of the car, and the cold night air hit her face. The sound of rain tapping against the pavement, accompanied by her footsteps, created a faint echo that reverberated through the empty street, highlighting the silence of the night.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The closer she got, the clearer the shape of her assistant became. Her defined body, her wild hair, and that unmistakable smile. If someone had told her a month ago that she would be completely in love with Rio Vidal, she would have laughed out loud.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As she approached, Agatha threw herself into the assistant’s arms, pulling her into a tight embrace. Her hands wrapped around Rio’s back, clutching her, hiding her face in the woman’s neck, inhaling her scent.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Not that I’m complaining, but this wasn’t the reaction I was expecting." Rio murmured with a little chuckle, but returned the embrace with equal intensity. "I was ready for screams and curses."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Don’t ruin the moment, Vidal." Agatha’s eyes slowly closed as she focused only on the woman’s scent, the warmth, and the comfort of her embrace.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gently stroked Agatha's back, letting her calm down in her arms. She felt Agatha’s breathing steady and her body relax little by little. It was as though, for a brief moment, all the weight she had been carrying had disappeared.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I have a surprise for you." Rio said softly, her touch still gliding over Agatha’s back. She felt Agatha cling to her more, as if reluctant to pull away.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha allowed herself to be guided into the planetarium through a dark corridor. Rio held the lantern firmly, lighting the way ahead, while locking the door behind them. Agatha heard a small beep, but the assistant didn’t seem to care and simply ignored it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They walked down the hallway until they reached the Hayden Planetarium’s auditorium, completely empty except for the two of them and the stars that covered the entire dome.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked around, completely enchanted by the place. It was a quiet, peaceful environment that offered a break from the hustle and bustle outside. The bright stars above them formed constellations that seemed to dance on the ceiling.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio placed the lantern on the ground, allowing the room to be illuminated only by the stars. She walked past the empty seats to the picnic basket neatly arranged in the center. She turned back once more, watching Agatha’s reaction with a faint smile on her lips.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Did you like it?" Rio asked, a slight tone of insecurity in her voice.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I... love it." Agatha’s eyes scanned the ceiling again before meeting Rio’s gaze, the constellations and the faint light highlighting her features in the darkness that enveloped them. "I’ve been here a million times, but none of them compare to this."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt her face heat up at Agatha’s words.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was told you like astronomy." she replied, making an effort to keep a casual air as she sat on the picnic blanket she had prepared.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "A little bird told you, right?" Agatha joined her on the blanket, a joyful smile spreading across her face.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio took two glasses and a bottle of wine from the basket, along with some sandwiches wrapped in napkins. She poured for both of them, and they began to eat and drink while watching the stars.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The silence between them was comfortable, only broken by the light show above their heads. It was far from the discomfort and tension they had carried the last few times they had met.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Half a bottle of wine later, they lay comfortably on the blanket.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "This is the Milky Way." Agatha whispered, almost as if she were afraid to break the bubble they had created. "It’s our galaxy. It wasn’t formed all at once, there were small collisions and mergers with other smaller galaxies that took thousands of years."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio wasn’t paying attention, her gaze lost on her boss, analyzing how the light from the stars bathed every feature of her face. While Agatha continued to explain and look at the stars, Rio remained focused on Agatha.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You’re staring at me." Agatha pointed out after a few minutes. She slowly turned her face to meet Rio’s gaze again, the woman’s dark hair framing her face. "I need to tell you something."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Is it going to ruin the mood?" Rio asked, her voice slow while the wine start to take effect.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Probably."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Then don’t tell me." Rio gently intertwined her fingers with Agatha’s.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It’s about Wanda..."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio made a discomforted face and looked away from Agatha for the first time that night.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Even worse." She murmured between clenched teeth.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Please, listen to me." Agatha whispered, her voice choking with emotion. She traced the tip of her fingers over Rio’s chin, pulling the woman’s face towards hers to meet her gaze again. "Wanda threatened me today. She has pictures of us, and she said she would tell the company’s board. She knows that you and Nicholas are my weak spot." She let out a long sigh, followed by a few tears. "I’m scared, Rio. Scared of losing my place in the company, my career, everything I’ve fought for my whole life. But I’m also scared of losing you, of not being able to adopt Nicky." Agatha pointed to her own heart. "I’m scared of these feelings."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let the words hit her, feeling the fragility of Agatha reflected in her gaze. She wrapped a protective arm around her boss’s waist, pulling her firmly against her body.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I’m scared too, Agatha. Of what my colleagues will think of me, that I’m just another opportunist trying to climb the ladder." Rio brushed away some strands of hair that had fallen on Agatha’s face. "I spent so much time running from my feelings that when I finally found someone worth my time, I hurt her. I don’t know if I can forgive myself for making you feel the way I did, I can only hope you forgive me someday."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha closed her eyes, taking comfort in Rio’s arms. There was no more space for the anger and confusion that had consumed her until then. A wave of relief washed over her, and for a moment, Rio’s presence was all she needed.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I’ve already forgiven you." Agatha murmured against the woman’s lips, her voice still trembling.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio tightened her hold on her, pulling her closer as if she desperately wanted this feeling to last. The outside world seemed to shrink until it was just the two of them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Let’s tell the board ourselves." Rio buried her face in the older woman’s neck. "Take the power away from that bitch."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out a small laugh.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I’m not going to impose that on you. We’re not even in a relationship yet." She gently ran her hand through the assistant’s hair.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Agatha Harkness," Rio lifted her head and looked into her boss’s blue eyes, "if I could, I would walk the streets of New York with a loudspeaker blaring how much I love you. I’m not afraid of a board of directors full of decrepit old men."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Y-You love me?" Agatha stuttered.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "In every way a human being can love another." Rio confessed.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was as if all the walls Agatha had built over the years were coming down all at once. Her face lit up, and she looked at Rio with so much affection that it seemed as if light were shining from her eyes.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I love you too." Agatha replied in just a whisper.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She slowly pressed her lips against Rio's, feeling the soft and velvety texture. Her body stiffened with anticipation, her emotions jumping in her chest. In a surge of impulse, Agatha deepened the kiss, her mouth moving against Río's with fervent longing. Their mouths choreographed in harmony, exploring every detail, every curve, savoring the moment, letting themselves be carried away by the feelings they had kept repressed for so long.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha pulled the assistant closer, holding her face with fingers, the tips gliding through the ends of her hair, sending shivers down her body.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt her body slowly igniting, like a candle gaining light. Her heart pounded so strongly that she feared it might burst through her chest. She traced the contours of Agatha's body with her hands, seeking to pass through layers of clothes. Agatha pressed against her, as if wanting to fuse their bodies into one. The kiss deepened, Agatha's tongue invading her mouth, a touch that reminded her of how her boss like to behave, commanding and dominant.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio felt Agatha's hand trailing down her back until it came to rest on her hip, squeezing it with possessive dominance. She attempted to fight for assertiveness, yet her need to submit was undeniable, and all she could think of was pleasing her boss.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha momentarily pulled away, her eyes shimmering with desire and lips wet by the kiss. The shared connection was palpable in the air, like an electric current coursing between them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She still held Rio's face in her hand, feeling the heat in her palm, while the assistant felt the weight of desire in her flushed cheeks.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I want to taste you." Agatha whispered in a husky voice, her tone low and sensual.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio almost moaned with anticipation, her breath accelerating at her boss's words. In an impulsive move, she took Agatha's hand and guided it to the center of her legs, pulling up the hem of her short blue dress. No underwear again, her intimacy drenched with desire.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I'm starting to think you do this on purpose." Agatha murmured with a mischievous smile.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha's hands trailed over the skin of her assistente, tracing the warm flesh of her sex softly, making her wriggle. She positioned herself between Rio’s legs, spreading them apart as her mouth began to kiss wetly along the inside of her thighs, teasing her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s body trembled with pleasure, a mix of intense emotions coursing through her veins. Each kiss sending delicious shivers, her body responding to every touch. As Agatha's hands roamed her with expertise, Rio surrendered entirely, softly moaning, yearning for more.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Agatha, you're torturing me." She murmured in a whispered plea, her voice breathless with desire.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ask for it." Agatha whispered leaving a kiss on her wet, sensitive sex. "I want to hear you beg."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha's words wrapped around her ears, a mix of desire and challenge, making her body even more sensitive. Her touch was like electricity, gently trailing across Rio's skin, setting all her nerves on fire. The sensation of Agatha's mouth kissing her wetly, left her with delicious shivers traversing through her entire body. Her breath became trapped in her chest, each exhalation carrying an inarticulate moan.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Please, please." Rio begged desperately, her hands getting lost in Agatha's hair, trying to bridge the distance between them. "Please, f-fuck me.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was satisfaying to see Rio at her mercy, begging for her touch. The way her body responded, the way she surrendered, it was irresistible. Agatha wanted her, no doubt, and felt a perverse pleasure in prolonging the woman's desires until she teetered on the edge of madness. With slow movements, she took her time exploring Rio's sex, tasting every inch. Her hands and mouth seemed to know every sensitive spot of her assistant's body, exploring with precision as she guided Rio along a path of sensations she had never imagined. Agatha’s touch was firm yet gentle, her hands holding Rio possessively by the waist as her mouth moved expertly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's body responded furiously to each touch, a moan escaping her lips as soon as Agatha found a constant rhythm.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha didn't give her any rest, her mouth exploring every sensitive spot on her body, sending waves of pleasure with each touch. Desire coursed through Rio's veins, leaving her desperate for more contact. Her moans grew louder and more distinct, expressing the pleasure that had taken over her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio's body arched against Agatha's mouth, a low moan escaping her lips. Agatha's tongue was warm and skillful, caressing sensitive points as her eyes closed in pleasure. Waves of pleasure intensified, building slowly until they broke like a cascade of desire and satisfaction. Her body trembled and she clutched at the blanket, her fingers digging into the floor of the auditorium, desperately trying to find support.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha snuggled up beside Rio again, leaving a soft kiss on her lips.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Do you want to go to my place? We can finish what we started." Agatha whispered, letting out a small laugh.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gently bit her lip, looking into the older woman’s eyes and nodded.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes." She answered softly, her voice still hoarse with desire.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed, catching her breath and smoothing down her dress until it was back in place. They quickly gathered their things, trying to leave the place untouched. They grabbed the lantern again and walked back through the same dark corridor to the back door of the planetarium. Rio tried inserting the key to unlock it, but the door jammed and wouldn’t open.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Hmm... We might have a problem." Rio tried again, but the door still didn’t budge.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Please, Vidal. Don’t tell me you locked us in here." Agatha sighed in irritation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Alright, I won’t say then.”Rio smiled, lighting up her boss’s face with the flashlight. She lit up the corridor and started walking back toward the auditorium.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You idiot!" Agatha exclaimed, stomping her foot right behind her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And here come the screams." Rio murmured carelessly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "How do you manage to be so irresponsible? It’s like you make the best decision possible, and then your brain shuts off and you do the dumbest thing!" Agatha yelled as she passed by her, settling into one of the armchairs.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Relax, the guy who lent me the key said the door will open again at 6 AM." Rio sat down next to her, stretching the blanket to cover them both. She leaned her head on Agatha’s shoulder and planted a kiss on her neck. "Please, don’t be mad.” Rio asked as she gently caressed Agatha's hand.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Alright." Agatha checked the watch on her wrist; it was almost two in the morning. She hadn’t realized how fast time had passed when she allowed herself to relax next to Rio, but anyway, there were still many hours ahead, and Agatha saw no other option but to sleep right there.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "No chance to finish what we started, huh?" Rio asked, laughing.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "No, idiot."
     </span>

      Agatha woke up with a pain in her back and numb legs. She quickly looked up and realized she was in complete darkness. She didn't realize when the dome had turned off; she was probably already in a deep sleep. Rio stirred in her lap, her head hanging over Agatha's legs as she sprawled across two other seats, almost drooling. Her eyes hadn’t fully adjusted to the darkness, but Agatha could tell that Rio had left her mouth slightly open and was leaning forward just a little.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She raised her arm to eye level and checked the time on her wristwatch.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      07:32 AM.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were way past the time.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio.” Agatha whispered calmly, but Rio only murmured something muffled by her face, which was now nestled deeper into Agatha’s waist. “Wake up, darling. We need to go.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The lawyer heard footsteps in the distance and a low whistle, making her heart race in panic. Agatha moved, trying to wake Rio in the most gentle way possible, but she was about to lose her patience and shake her awake.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wake up, Rio.” She tried again, her irritation starting to take over. “Someone's coming.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Just five more minutes.” Rio murmured, still sleepy.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The sound of footsteps began to echo through the dome, putting Agatha on high alert. She grabbed her purse and started shaking Rio, trying to get the woman to wake up.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wake up, Vidal!” Agatha shouted, irritated.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Alright, alright.” Rio complained as she sat up, yawning.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The lights in the auditorium began to turn on. While Rio took her time trying to make sense of the situation, Agatha was already on her feet, searching among the empty seats for her shoes.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Did you see my Louboutins?” She asked as she wandered.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio, pulling herself out of her little moment of sleep, was fully awakened when she saw her boss fidgeting. Still disoriented, she followed the sound of footsteps, her eyes scanning the room for the person who had caused all the commotion.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have no idea what that means.” Rio mumbled, rubbing her eyes.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey! You two!” A stocky man in a security guard uniform appeared from the central entrance of the auditorium.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s body finally seemed to wake up when she jumped between the seats, making a beeline for the access corridor. She and Agatha exchanged glances, both seemingly having the same idea as they started running toward the back door.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Please, be open. Please, be open.” Rio silently prayed to the heavens or any divine entity that might be listening. She searched for the key in the depths of her pocket while Agatha followed closely behind, squeezing her hand.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Come back here! This is trespassing, I’ll call the police!” The man shouted behind them, trying to keep up but seemingly out of breath.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s heart pounded in her chest, which did nothing to help her already labored breathing. The key seemed to move slowly in the lock, and she barely noticed Agatha only inches behind her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Faster.” Agatha’s voice echoed, desperate and impatient. “I swear, Vidal, if I end up arrested in the planetarium…”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Finally, the door opened, and a cold gust of wind greeted them. The two ran chaotically down the quiet street. Rio slammed the door behind her, leaving the guard struggling inside, and they ran for several more blocks to make sure they were out of danger.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now... Now we’re safe.” Rio said, trying to catch her breath. The cold morning air hit her sweaty face, and she tried to straighten her hair with trembling hands.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha bent over, exhausted. Her clothes were disheveled, and her face was flushed from the situation. Rio’s still-pounding heart felt the tension in the air, mixed with the adrenaline from the past few minutes.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I lost my Louboutins.” Agatha let out a muffled laugh, pointing at her bare and dirty feet. “I almost got arrested and lost my most expensive pair of shoes.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll buy you the most comfortable flip-flops I can find.” Rio stepped to the edge of the sidewalk and flagged down a passing taxi. They got in quickly, with Rio opening the door for Agatha. “We’re going to...”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Brooklyn.” Agatha interrupted, receiving a questioning look from her assistant. “It’s Nicky’s moving day, I promised I’d pick him up at 8 AM, and I’m already late. And since you locked us in the planetarium, lost my shoes and almost got me arrested, you’re going to help me with the move and paint his room.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh no, Agatha!” Rio slid down in the seat, complaining like a child. “I’m so tired, I didn’t sleep well.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And whose fault is that exactly?” Agatha rummaged through her purse and pulled out a pack of mints, swallowing one and offering one to her assistant. She leaned in and whispered in Rio’s ear. “I’ll let you shower at my place.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio made a face, taking the mint from Agatha’s hand, but not hiding the smile that was starting to form at the corners of her lips. She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling the sweetness of the mint dissolve in her mouth as the taxi sped through the city.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Are you going to be in the shower with me?” Rio asked nonchalantly, trying to maintain her composure but already surrendering to the fatigue that was taking over her body.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe.” Agatha answered playfully, but her eyes were gently focused on the street passing outside the car window. She hated being late, especially for something involving Nicky’s move.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio let herself slump back against the seat, no longer with the tense posture she had before, but with a sense of accumulated exhaustion. Her fingers gripped the mint pack Agatha was still holding, and for a moment, the two were silent, observing the city through the car window.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The taxi passed through some busy streets, the morning rush hour already beginning to form. Agatha was lost in her thoughts, while Rio seemed to be giving in completely to sleep, her head resting against the glass of the car window, her breath soft and uneven.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ll have to offer me more than just a simple shower.” Rio mumbled with her eyes half-closed.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha glanced at Rio, her head still resting on the car window, her expression a mix of exhaustion and amusement. The lawyer gave a small smile, her fingers tossing the empty mint wrapper into her purse. She couldn’t help but enjoy the way Rio seemed so unconcerned with what was happening around her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What exactly do you want, Vidal?” Agatha asked with an enigmatic expression, already knowing Rio wouldn’t pass up the chance to make another joke.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio sighed heavily, still keeping her eyes closed, but the smile on the corner of her lips was unmistakable. She was clearly recovering from her sleepless night, but her mind was sharp enough to joke about the situation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not that hard to please.” Rio answered, her voice light and casual, as if offering a suggestion more than making a demand. “Maybe a foot massage?”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “A foot massage?” she repeated, trying not to laugh.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re a businesswoman, you know nothing comes for free.” Rio gave a slight smile, unable to hide the satisfaction of her own joke.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha threw her purse at Rio, making the girl groan in pain.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m not giving you any foot massages.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, come on!” Rio complained, letting out a loud laugh. “I’m kidding, of course I’ll help you and Nicky.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When the taxi finally pulled up in front of a small house with an overgrown yard, they were greeted by Nicholas sitting on the front steps. He wore a simple t-shirt and slightly worn jeans, a look that didn’t stand out but seemed comfortable for someone his age. Agatha noticed right away that he wasn’t alone. Beside him, Mrs. Hart, an elderly woman with gray hair and a warm smile, was gesturing gently for the boy to go inside, but Nicholas was impatient, barely hiding the anxiety on his face.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Agatha! Rio!” He exclaimed enthusiastically, already jumping from the porch and running toward them, as if he couldn’t contain his excitement at seeing them both together.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas ran up to them, his backpack bouncing against his back and a cardboard box in his hands, but the enthusiasm on his face was enough to make all the stress of the move disappear.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Finally!” He said, setting the cardboard box on the ground and looking from one to the other, his eyes shining with happiness. “It worked, didn’t it?” He smiled, giving Rio a gentle shove, almost as if saying,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       “I told you so.”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What do you mean, Nicholas?” Agatha asked, smiling as if she already suspected the answer but wanted to hear it from the boy himself.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It worked, kid.” Rio extended her hand to Nicholas, who immediately shook it in agreement. “I might be your new stepmom.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Vidal, that’s something we’ll discuss alone!” Agatha exclaimed, indignant.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What happened to your shoes?” Nicholas finally asked, noticing Agatha’s bare feet.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked down at her bare feet, still a little embarrassed, and let out a muffled laugh while thinking of a somewhat believable answer.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s a story for another day, but I can guarantee it’s Rio’s fault.” She said, with a playful but also tired expression. “Is that all?” Agatha asked, eyeing the small cardboard box.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think that’s it.” He answered, his voice quieter but still trying to keep the optimism. “Some clothes and a few personal things. I don’t have much.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha furrowed her eyebrow, her gaze now more focused on the boy. She knew Nicholas’s reality, the struggles he had faced. But even so, the sight of that modest box, with so few belongings, affected her in a way she hadn’t expected.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is that all you have?” She asked softly, a little taken aback by the fact that he seemed so accustomed to living with so little. “Don’t worry, Nicky. We’ll change that. We’ll get everything sorted out, and soon you’ll have a room full of good things.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas felt a mix of gratitude and a slight sense of loss, as if those few items were the only things he had left from his past life. But before emotions could take over, he stepped closer to Agatha and, with a sudden burst of affection, gave her a tight hug.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt the weight of his words and the embrace. It was hard for her to fully understand the pain he carried, but she knew that, even though her intention was to be just a temporary home, at that moment, she was offering him something much deeper. More than a roof over his head, more than a neatly arranged room: she was offering him belonging.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With a held breath, she returned the hug, holding him close with affection but also with a silent determination. She was there, committed to this change, to Nicholas’s life. And, more than that, she was committing to his future — and maybe her own too.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’ll have more than just a room full of good things, Nicky.” Agatha said softly, her voice wavering but firm. “You’ll have everything you deserve. And much more. I promise.”
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas pulled away a little, his face still illuminated by the hopeful smile she loved to see. He looked almost relieved, as if that simple gesture of affection was enough to erase some of the fear he’d always carried about the future.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then, let’s go!” He exclaimed, his usual enthusiasm now with a newfound confidence in his eyes.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      After a few more minutes, Nicholas finally said goodbye to his old temporary home and Mrs. Hart. With his belongings settled in the taxi, he sat between Rio and Agatha for the ride back, the smile never leaving his lips.

      In the bathroom, the steam from the shower still lingered in the air. The sound of the drops hitting the walls and the water gently falling formed a tranquil melody. Rio, finally free from the day's tension and accumulated fatigue, stepped out of the shower, her body wrapped in a soft, white towel. The steam had left her hair messy, but there was something relaxed and carefree in her expression, as if the weight of the world had momentarily disappeared.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She walked over to Agatha's closet, which was a spectacle in itself, with clothes impeccably arranged and organized in a way that could only come from someone with an impeccable aesthetic sense. Rio grabbed one of the lawyer's outfits — a black silk blouse paired with white tailored pants, both comfortable and elegant at the same time. The smooth fabric slid over her skin as she dressed, and for a moment, she felt almost as if she were appropriating a piece of Agatha’s life. She liked feeling this way — more at ease, more comfortable in her own skin, but always remembering who she was.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, in turn, was in Nicholas's room, which had just been prepared for his move. The space was far from empty, but the simple decoration still left room for many changes. The walls were a soft shade of gray, the floor light, and the large windows allowed natural light to pour into the room. Nicholas sat on his bed, looking at some paint samples Agatha had brought.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Purple." Agatha said with a gleam in her eyes, as if it were a simple choice.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "No one paints their walls purple." Nicholas grimaced.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha crossed her arms, laughing softly at Nicholas's response.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I’d love to see someone paint a room purple. So, what do you suggest?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas looked at the paint samples scattered on the floor and, with a mischievous smile, pointed to the shade of blue.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Everyone loves blue. It’s calm, peaceful. It’ll look great in my room."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Blue is too... predictable." Agatha made a puzzled face, as if she was determined to win this little color battle.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was then that a cheerful, calm voice came from the door. Rio appeared, with her relaxed posture, but a touch of irreverent style in the outfit she now wore.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Are you two fighting over wall colors?" Rio asked with a smile, fully joining in the mood. "Why not paint it green? It's my favorite color."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Rio, surprised, measuring her from head to toe.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Are you wearing my Chanel blouse to paint the walls?" she asked incredulously.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio gave a mischievous smile, unfazed by the surprise in Agatha's voice. She made a sweeping gesture with her hands, as if trying to convince the lawyer of her decision.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I'm just borrowing it." Rio replied, as if that was explanation enough. "And about the green... it's a color that brings calm, harmony... and let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a well-painted green wall? It’s bold yet soft, perfect for a bedroom."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha still looked at her with a mix of disbelief and a hint of amusement. She knew Rio had a unique way of appropriating things, and now that was extending to the expensive clothes in her own collection.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Green?" Agatha repeated, raising an eyebrow. "What do you think, Nicky?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas now seemed more interested in Rio's idea. He got up from the bed, his eyes sparkling with the possibility of something new.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I like it," he said, slapping his hand on the light green sample on the floor. "Green has to do with nature, right? It'll be good for the room."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio laughed, shaking her head, and went to the storage room to get the brushes and paint cans. Agatha and Nicholas followed her, both grabbing rollers and brushes as Rio started preparing the paint cans. Agatha watched the way Rio moved, her loose and spontaneous energy making the task feel more like a dance than a simple chore. She seemed to be having fun while working, which made Agatha smile softly, appreciating the contrast between her meticulous style and Rio's more carefree approach.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "If we’re going to paint, let’s do it right." Rio said, turning to them as she began stirring the paint in the bucket. "And seriously, Agatha, this blouse won’t get dirty. I’m a painting professional."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t help laughing. Rio had a way of saying things so irreverently that it was hard to resist her energy. She, who was so controlled in the office and during negotiations, now found herself immersed in something completely different: a carefree afternoon with Nicholas and Rio, transforming a young boy’s bedroom. And, as much as Agatha loved her work and her control over every situation, she couldn’t deny the pleasure she felt watching this new dynamic unfold.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the green paint began to spread across the walls of Nicholas’s room, the trio settled into the rhythm of work. Nicholas and Rio started having fun with the situation, exchanging jokes and making small bets about who would make the straightest line on the walls. Each with their own style: Agatha with calm, focused efficiency; Nicholas with youthful enthusiasm, wanting to make as much of a mess as possible; and Rio, balancing humor and skill, making even the simplest moments feel special.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The afternoon passed quickly, with laughter and conversation flowing like the paint on the walls. At one point, Rio and Agatha were practically competing to see who could paint faster. The two of them, brushes in hand and a fun tension in the air, tried to avoid smudges while covering the last areas of the wall.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I won!" Rio shouted, laughing as she gave one last brushstroke at the top of the wall. "Your line is all crooked, Agatha."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at her work and grimaced, but ended up laughing too.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I just wanted the lines to be a little more artistic," she said, stepping away from the wall and looking at Rio.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas, who had been quiet, watching everything with shining eyes full of happiness, made a face when he saw their work. But it wasn’t a face of displeasure — he was ecstatic with what he saw.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I like it, it’s looking really good. Now, what do we do with the rest of this?" he asked, pointing to the remaining wall.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha wiped her forehead, trying to move the strands of hair that had fallen over her face from the effort of painting. She glanced at the wall and, finally, nodded in satisfaction.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Now, we let it dry," she said with a soft smile. "And then we’ll put in a new bed, some shelves... But the most important thing is that this is your room, Nicky. Your space, your personality. I promised you this would be a new beginning."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas looked at Agatha with gratitude in his eyes, a shy smile forming on his face. Agatha felt a wave of affection and protectiveness, as if she were truly taking care of him in a way she hadn’t before. It wasn’t just about having the best room, the best bed, or the best of everything. It was about belonging to a place, about having a space that was his.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the trio laughed and discussed possibilities for Nicholas's room, the sudden sound of the doorbell cut through the cozy atmosphere. Nicholas and Rio's laughter stopped instantly, and the three of them exchanged glances, as if the sound had interrupted something deeper and more peaceful that was about to unfold.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha, with an expression that mixed curiosity and a twinge of anxiety, walked to the door with steady but discreet steps. When she opened the door, her eyes met her best friend’s, and all the nervousness faded away.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Lilia," Agatha said with a smile, pulling the woman into a hug. "What brings you here?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I came to talk business." Lilia said bluntly as she closed the door behind her and walked past Agatha with a calculated movement.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha felt a tightening in her stomach. She knew exactly what Lilia was referring to. It was impossible not to feel the weight of it, the pressure mounting with every passing moment. Lilia watched her with a mixture of sympathy and a hint of unease in her eyes.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I need you to read this." Lilia said, handing an envelope to Agatha.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took the envelope, and as she opened it, she found a document she had been dreading: a relationship declaration. Her heart skipped a beat, and her eyes fixed on the words with painful clarity. What was there was not just a simple letter; it was a strategy to prevent Wanda from using compromising photos against her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Lilia, you..." Agatha began, but her voice faltered for a moment, taking a pause to process what was happening. "Is this... from last week?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes." Lilia confirmed, with a seriousness that made her words feel like a well-thought-out trap. "Last week, you and Rio came to my office with this signed declaration to acknowledge your relationship."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "But... we didn’t do that," Rio looked at both of them with a confused expression.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You've always liked the dumb ones," Lilia whispered to her friend, causing Agatha to chuckle softly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Rio, darling, this document, signed before the photos were taken, protects me from losing my position at the company. And it protects you from being unjustly fired, you understand?" Agatha handed the document to her assistant as she explained.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Oh, I get it!" Rio’s face lit up with a smile. "So we just have to lie."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia let out a muffled laugh, as if trying to suppress the idea that the situation wasn’t as simple as Rio seemed to think.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "This gives us the advantage that, if anyone from the board asks, we can say you and Rio had already acknowledged the relationship when Wanda’s photos were taken. And from there, we can argue that her actions were an attempt at manipulation, with no foundation," Lilia corrected gently.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia knew that Agatha hated being forced into actions like this — the idea of creating a document that distorted reality in some way troubled her deeply. But to protect the company, her career, and especially her relationship with Nicholas, she knew there was no other way.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I... I know it’s necessary, but..." Agatha began, her voice low, almost as if she were trying to convince herself. "I don’t like this. I don’t like the idea of doing this..."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I’ll sign whatever you need." Rio said as she reached for Agatha’s hand, lightly tracing her palm with her fingertips, trying to soothe her. "I understand the necessity of all this. We might not like what we’re doing, but it’s the only way to protect what we have. I’m on your side. Always."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Rio, and for the first time in a long time, she felt truly supported. It wasn’t just the trust in Rio as an assistant, but something deeper, something building between them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I... I don’t know what I’d do without you," Agatha said with a small, but sincere smile towards the woman.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio, without a second thought, ran to the kitchen to get a pen and returned minutes later, signing the document.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha took a deep breath, feeling the weight of her responsibilities settling on her shoulders. She looked at Rio, who was so focused on the task at hand but also seemed aware of the gravity of the situation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was impulsive, but in that moment, she was choosing to protect Agatha in the way that made the most sense, even if it wasn’t ideal.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha remained silent for a moment, looking at the document signed by Rio. She knew there was no turning back now, that reality and illusion were now fused in that piece of paper, and even hesitantly, she signed as well.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "So... what does this mean for us?" Nicholas asked, with a touch of curiosity in his voice, but also a lightness that contrasted with the gravity of the situation. "You and Rio... are you... together now? I mean, is it official?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes, Agatha. Am I officially your girlfriend now?" Rio asked with an inquisitive tone, but the mischievous smile never left her lips.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes slightly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I suppose so, Vidal."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes!" Rio shouted excitedly, grabbing Agatha by the waist and spinning her in the air. "My girlfriend!"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Rio!" Agatha exclaimed, lightly slapping her assistant’s shoulder until she was put back on the ground. "You’re going to use that word for everything, aren’t you?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes! My girlfriend!" Rio grabbed Agatha’s face, showering her with kisses all over. "My girlfriend. My girlfriend. My girlfriend."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia said her goodbyes to the three of them, and the afternoon quickly returned to its light, carefree pace. Laughter and easy conversation filled the house once again. The three of them were at ease, throwing jokes around, exchanging knowing glances, and, most importantly, putting aside, for a while, the tensions that had been hanging over them.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As night fell, the house grew silent, the only sound the soft rhythm of Rio's breathing, as she slept soundly next to Agatha. The room was lit only by the soft moonlight filtering through the thin curtains, casting gentle shadows on the walls. It was a peaceful night, with no rush, no worries that had marked the past few weeks. Agatha looked at the ceiling, feeling calmer than she remembered being in a long time.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She turned to her side, her fingers gently touching Rio’s skin, until, with tenderness, she rested her hand on the woman’s chest. She felt Rio’s peaceful, steady breathing, the soft beat of her heart. That sound, simple and comforting, filled the silence of the night, and Agatha felt more at peace than she had ever imagined possible. There was no rush, no decisions to make, nothing but that moment.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha’s hand remained there, affectionately, as if, for the first time, she were fully accepting what she felt and what was between them. It was no longer a game, nor a struggle. It was real.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The world outside could wait.

<strong>
      ONE YEAR LATER
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The atmosphere in Agatha Harkness's penthouse was more welcoming than ever. The place, once a reflection of her imposing and distant personality, now had a softer touch, with small mementos of shared moments — framed photos from trips, books in disorganized stacks, and above all, Nicholas's constant smile, which made everything feel more like family.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The scent of freshly baked cake filled the air as Lilia and Agatha were busy in the kitchen, trying not to laugh while assembling a birthday cake for Rio. Green and black balloons, Rio's favorite colors, floated around, thanks to Nicholas's meticulous work, who seemed more excited than ever. Alice and Jen, who were supposed to be in charge of decorations, kept slipping quietly onto the balcony, trying to steal isolated moments.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Is there anyone in this house besides me who likes men?" Lilia murmured incredulously, more to herself than anyone else, as she watched her two staff members making out.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I do." Nicholas replied casually before taking another balloon, putting it to his mouth, and inflating it.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Meanwhile, Agatha paced around the room, masking her nervousness as she made the final touches on the preparations. She had planned everything meticulously, wanting to make Rio's birthday an unforgettable moment, but what truly made her anxious was the gift she had prepared for the woman she loved so much.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "How long is she going to take at the store?" Jen asked as she returned to the room, helping with the decorations.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "If it depends on Rio, she might get stuck at the store." Nicholas joked.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The noise of the door's lock interrupted the group's conversation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Rio's back! Eveyone hide!” Alice shouted as she rushed to turn off the lights.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Smiling, Nicholas grabbed the last balloon and ran into the kitchen. Lilia and Agatha quickly crouched behind the couch, doing their best to look casual, while Alice and Jen returned to the dimness of the balcony.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio entered, suspicious, the door closing softly behind her. She looked around, her eyes scanning the shadows of the room, the balloons floating in the air, and for a moment, everything felt strange and quiet. She stepped inside and stopped, feeling like something was out of place.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "What's going on?" Rio asked, her tone already a mix of surprise and a hint of amusement. She was well-acquainted with that feeling that something was about to happen.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before she could ask more questions, the silence was shattered by a unified shout:
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "SURPRISE!"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The room suddenly lit up, revealing the gathered friends around her, laughing and giving her affectionate looks. Rio stood frozen for a moment, processing the scene, until her smile slowly appeared, widening as she looked at Agatha, who was at the front of everything, with a shy but proud smile.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You..." Rio stammered, her eyes filling with tears. "I... I can’t believe it!"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha moved towards her with open arms. When the two embraced, it was as if the world outside had disappeared. Rio closed her eyes, feeling Agatha's heartbeat against her chest, the warmth and comfort she had longed for.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You deserve all this and more, my love." Agatha whispered, cupping the woman's face for a tender kiss.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The party continued with laughter and joy. Everyone was excited, celebrating Rio's special day with enthusiasm and affection. Nicholas was more animated than ever, running back and forth, eating snacks and stealing slices of cake, while Lilia tried to keep the house in order. Jen hardly left Alice’s side, and the two exchanged knowing looks all the time.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Hours later, when the last guests were leaving, Agatha gathered Nicholas and Rio in the living room, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She held two envelopes, one white and smooth, more formal, and another in a brownish color, sealed with ink and an engraving that looked old.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "First you, Nicky. My safe harbor, my son." Agatha said, her eyes filling with tears as she handed the white envelope to the boy.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas looked at her curiously, then at the envelope. He opened it carefully, but when he saw what was inside, his eyes lit up.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       "Nicholas Harkness."
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      it said, with a seal beneath it marking his new identity. He looked at Agatha, his eyes watering.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Agatha..." he whispered, his voice choked, as he looked at her with a shy smile. "Is this... is this real?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It is. You are my son now, Nicholas. Officially." Agatha answered, her voice soft but firm.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Mom..." Nicholas whispered for the first time before hugging her.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With the tight hug, Agatha felt that everything was finally in its place. The emptiness she had felt before was now filled with the love of the boy. More than ever, they were family.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha looked at Rio, who was watching her with a smile.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And now it’s your turn." Agatha looked at Rio, handing her the second envelope, the brown one.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio looked at the envelope, her heart racing. She recognized the symbol, she knew what it meant.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "This is the result of my exam, right?" she asked nervously while fiddling with the envelope. "What if I didn’t pass?"
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "We’ll be here for you, no matter what the result is." Agatha touched her arm affectionately.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio hesitated for a moment, a little incredulous, before opening the envelope and reading the contents aloud.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "We are pleased to inform you of your acceptance into the Law program at Columbia University." Rio read the words, feeling the weight of them in her mind. Her eyes began to shine, and she looked at Agatha, still not believing it. "I passed." Her voice trembled with emotion.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled, gently touching Rio's face.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I knew you could do it. I always knew." Agatha held both Rio and Nicholas’s hands. "You have a family to support you now. And when you graduate, there will be a place for you at the company."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio was still stunned, her heart racing. She had worked so hard for this moment, and now it was happening, for real.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I never imagined this would be possible." Rio whispered, her voice thick with emotion.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The trio spent the rest of the night with warm laughter and light conversation, playing board games. When Nicholas finally collapsed from exhaustion on the living room couch, Rio and Agatha dragged him to the bedroom so he could rest properly.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Between passionate kisses, the two got ready for bed. While Rio straightened the bed, Agatha rummaged through her closet drawer, searching for a velvet box she had been hiding for weeks. With determined steps, she returned to the room, touching Rio's arm and drawing her attention as she opened the small box.
     </span>

      There was no golden ring, no diamond or traditional romantic gesture. Instead, there was only a cold silver key.
     </span>
<span>

      "I want you to move in with me." Agatha’s voice was low, but filled with a firmness that was impossible to ignore.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio didn’t say anything right away. The silence between them was broken by a soft smile on Rio’s lips. She gripped the key firmly, and Agatha’s eyes met hers, a deep and confident gleam in both of their gazes.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Of course I’ll move in, Agatha. Wherever you are, I know that’s where my place is."
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha smiled shyly, but her eyes shone with emotion. She moved closer to Rio, gently touching her face with the palm of her hand, as if wanting to make sure this moment was etched into her memory. Then, without saying anything more, she kissed her. A gentle yet deep kiss, an exchange of feelings, intentions, and future.
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they lay down and the last light of the night faded away, Rio whispered like a silent promise:
     </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You are my home now."
