<div class="userstuff">
<p>Thousands of years ago, Rio would have ruled over a castle. A proper estate on a mountain—or at least a dramatic hill. It would be a sharp, daunting expanse of land with a cliff. Always with a cliff. The kind of place you could toss a body off of, and it would look like they’d fallen from Heaven. </p><p>There would have been hundreds of rooms and just as many servants—golden chandeliers, stained glass windows, shrines and statues with her likeness carved out of marble.</p><p>None of this was actually a hypothetical, really—Rio knew she <em> had </em> ruled over one of these, once—but when your age starts to number in the thousands, memories become more like fiction than fact. You’re constantly having to parse through what is real and what is imagined—</p><p>It was all a little hard to believe, really, given her current situation in New York City.</p><p>“Five thousand dollars a month for 215 square feet?” Agatha laughed shrilly as soon as they were (barely) out of earshot from the rental agent.  “Rio, I’m going to kill myself.”</p><p>“Can you remind me why we don’t just kill the landlord instead?”</p><p>Rio joined Agatha where she was currently sitting on the cement, an umbrella propped over head to shield from the sun.</p><p>In response to her very genuine question, Agatha glared at her, then gestured toward a camera that was perched on a nearby streetlight.</p><p>“The modern surveillance state, Rio,” she groaned. “We’ve been over this. Remember when I was on the CIA watchlist in the early 2000s? We couldn’t go on vacation for a decade.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “That <em> was </em> unpleasant.”</p><p>“Yes, it was.”</p><p>Cars whizzed by in front of them. Big yellow taxis. Trucks and tiny Kia Souls. Rio thought back to when she and Agatha traveled by horse and buggy. The streets had smelled better then, somehow, even covered in horse shit.</p><p>A rat raced by Rio’s eyes now, voyaging from one sewer grate to the next. She thought her and Agatha weren’t much different than that rodent.</p><p>They’d known each other for six hundred years, roughly. Right around the invention of the printing press. Vampires had lived well back then. Less—as Agatha put it—<em> surveillance. </em></p><p>Murder was a lot easier to get away with. Riches were more <em> material</em>; less digital, no credit cards. If you lived forever, it was quite easy to accumulate a lot of gold, quite like a dragon.</p><p>But a little incident involving a King of England had wiped out that particular source of wealth, and then there was the Bubonic Plague, and her and Agatha had lived with a little <em> less </em> for much too long.</p><p>Still, she was lucky to have a friend like her.</p><p>Friend felt like too small a word to describe it, really. <em> Partner </em> wasn’t quite encompassing; <em> associate </em> was underselling it. They met over bodies; Rio had killed Agatha’s mother, infamous leader of the most notorious vampire clan in history. She’d expected Agatha, Evanora’s firstborn daughter, to naturally retaliate, but instead she’d snuck out of the dark, clapped Rio on the back as they stood over her mother’s corpse, and said:</p><p>“I think we’re going to be great friends.”</p><p>In the years since, they invested most of their time in murder. Murder for power, murder for money, murder for fun. Agatha was unquenchable, and Rio just liked to watch her work.</p><p>But as technology had advanced, their favorite hobby had gotten trickier—a stint in federal prison for Rio had turned them both off of it since the 2010s. They’d been living off their savings ever since, but even medieval gold bars weren’t safe from inflation.</p><p>“Alright,” Rio sighed. It looked like there was no other option. “I give up. We can—”</p><p>Agatha brightened, grinning wide, and interrupted her.</p><p>“Enthrall a billionaire and take all his money?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>.” Rio rolled her eyes, but couldn’t help but smile. “Don’t look so excited.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t that Rio was against creating thralls on principle. It was more… the consequences.</p><p>Creating a thrall meant there was a small chance that whoever you put under your control could eventually fight off that control, and become a vampire in their own right. And when thralls regained sentience as vampires, they tended to have only one thought on their mind—revenge.</p><p>The last time her and Agatha had created a thrall, it had been the King of England. Which, as aforementioned, had gone insanely poorly. Agatha-almost-died poorly. Rio was picking the stakes out of her for days. It was the worst day of her life. She hadn’t been interested in repeating it.</p><p>But desperate times, desperate measures.</p><p>They had to fund Agatha’s coffee habit somehow.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was curled up on their AirBnb couch, the NYC skyline painting a pretty picture of flickering lights into the night. She had a copy of the Forbes 30 under 30 pulled up on her phone, which Rio observed over her shoulder—and promptly laughed.</p><p>“I finally lifted the thrall ban, and you're settling for mid-twenties tech scammers?”</p><p>“Of course not,” Agatha scoffed. She slid her hand up Rio’s neck from behind, tugging at her hair and pulling her down to the couch—all without glancing up from her phone. Rio landed ungracefully by her side, the back of her scalp stinging where Agatha pulled.</p><p>“<em>Ow </em>. You could have just asked me to sit down.”</p><p> “And you could be quiet for once. Neither is going to happen.”</p><p>Her words were cold, but Rio could see Agatha fighting a grin. That was Agatha, always fighting something down—stifling it into submission. And then came Rio’s job, wrenching it out of her. <em> It </em> being just about anything—an emotion, an idea, a corpse Agatha had just sucked dry.</p><p>This time, <em> it </em> was her phone.</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha scowled. “Give that back.”</p><p>“Tell me your plan first,” Rio said, holding the red iPhone to her chest. “I’m impatient.”</p><p>Agatha took this as a challenge—as she took everything—and pushed Rio down onto the couch, climbing over her body like a rabid animal, hands tugging at the device.</p><p>Her eyes shone bright, blood red. Her fangs dropped from her canines.</p><p>And oh, how Rio loved to see her like this.</p><p>“Give. Me,” she breathed hot, venomous. “<em> That </em>.”</p><p>She dug her fingers into Rio’s hands. Rio felt blood prickle around her wrists.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’m good.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and leaned down, her lips brushing against Rio’s shoulder. Rio’s eyes went wide at the contact, her pupils dilating in seconds. They tussled like primates every so often, just to get it out of their system—rolling around on the carpet, nails digging through skin—but Agatha had never done anything as disarming as plant a<em> kiss </em>to her shoulder mid-game, no, that would be awfully strange; foul play, really, outside the rulebook—</p><p>Agatha’s fangs sunk into her shoulder. Rio squealed.</p><p>“What the hell, Agatha!”</p><p>She pushed the other vampire off her, and Agatha’s back thudded on the opposite arm of the couch. Blood was dribbling down her chin, and she was smiling like a wild beast. So, <em> so </em> pleased with herself. Rio’s heart rabbeted in her chest uncontrollably; faster than it had in years; so fast that she failed to notice that Agatha was holding her phone again, wiggling it in the air proudly.</p><p>Rio clamped her hand down on her shoulder, where blood was seeping, and gaped.</p><p>“You’re insane.”</p><p>Agatha’s grin only grew brighter. Wordlessly, she raised herself from the couch, and disappeared to the kitchen. When she returned a minute later, she was carrying a wet wipe, a roll of paper towels, and the remote control for the television. She slowly came up from behind Rio and began to clean the wound, then pat it dry.</p><p>“Sorry,” she said, but her light tone betrayed her. “I think I got a little hungry.”</p><p>Rio laughed shortly, because she wasn’t sure what else to do.</p><p>In six hundred years, Agatha had never bitten her. Not even when they had been starving in the streets of London. Not even out of excitement after they’d killed the entire mafia in Rome. Not even when Rio had gotten enthralled by another vampire, and tried to tear Agatha limb from limb. Even then, Agatha had refused to use her teeth to subdue her.</p><p>Fangs were for killing. Well, killing, and, that one other thing—</p><p>Rio reddened.</p><p>
<em> No, she definitely didn’t mean it like that. </em>
</p><p>Agatha slunk back onto the couch, remote in hand. She looked at Rio with her lip bitten, a genuinely contemplative look on her face. It was a sort of speechlessness that looked very strange on Agatha. It made Rio want to say something, anything, even though she wasn’t sure what, but before she could, the expression was gone. Replaced by an easy overconfidence.</p><p>Agatha had raised the phone screen in front of her.</p><p>There was a picture of a man on there, from the 30 under 30 list. <em> Tommy Ashcroft </em> . Rio’s eyes scanned his profile. Tech startup founder, based in NYC, yada yada. Nothing special. Why would Agatha care about this guy? They could fry such bigger fish. Fuck. Rio didn’t even care. Her head was swimming. Why did Agatha <em> bite </em> her?</p><p>“I thought you said—” she began.</p><p>Agatha interrupted her. “Keep reading.”</p><p>With a reluctant sigh, she did. And that’s when her eyes landed on the last line.</p><p>
<em> Tommy Ashcroft is the son of Richard Ashcroft, billionaire CEO of Ashcroft Oil. </em>
</p><p>Richard Ashcroft. The second richest man on planet Earth.</p><p>“Oh, <em> Christ</em>, Agatha.”</p>

<p>Rio Vidal hadn’t always been a vampire, but she’d always slept like one—both eyes open, mind awake, barely dreaming. Her brain came out of the womb that way, on overdrive; the doctor who swaddled her wrote on her birth certificate that she had the eyes of a gargoyle. Always watching, even when the rest of her was as stiff as bone.</p><p>Agatha Harkness had always been a vampire, but she slept like a mortal. Twisting and turning and snorting like a pig in her sleep. Sometimes her noises were so egregious that Rio could hear them the room over, and would walk her way to Agatha’s just to swat her with a pillow. </p><p>But that night—or rather day, vampires got their best shut eye from nine am to six pm—both of them were abuzz. For very different reasons.</p><p>Agatha had gone full research mode. It was her most natural state, really; one Rio had seen her occupy thousands of times before—bent over an ancient scroll, an intercepted envelope, a bloodied murder weapon, or now, a laptop. Completely, utterly consumed by whatever question she’d committed herself to.</p><p>She was on the couch in the same exact position Rio had left her hours before, only now with a bag of potato chips cradled under one arm, and creases under her eyes from staring at the screen too long. Rio suspected she hadn’t moved once—maybe except to get the chips—since Rio went to get some shut-eye.</p><p>Of course she had not gotten <em> any </em> shut eye. Not because Agatha was being particularly noisy, for once, but because she had left Rio in a state of utter confusion.</p><p>The bite stared at Rio in the reflection of the TV; it was barely there now—vampire skin tended to heal like that, quicker than a bat of an eyelash—but Rio found that she didn’t want it to disappear; not before they addressed it. </p><p>She didn’t want it to fade so completely that Agatha could pretend it didn’t happen.</p><p>“Rio, finally! You’re awake,” Agatha chirped without looking up at her. She shoved another chip into her mouth, chewing noisily as she made room for Rio on the couch. “You won’t believe how good this plan is. I mean seriously, some of my best work.”</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>Completely ignoring her, Agatha shoved the laptop in front of her on the table, tapping the screen with her red acrylic nail. “Tommy—the spoiled CEO kid—is absolutely our way in. His company is recruiting for a bunch of roles, and by a happy little coincidence, we just happen to have resumes that match those roles. Who knew you were so talented in…” Agatha squinted at her notes. “Backend Kubernetes cluster system programming.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, then closed it, then opened it again. <em> This woman. </em></p><p>“Agatha, I don’t even own a computer.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, as if to say <em> and? </em></p><p>“I’m sure plenty of Backend Kubernetes Cluster programmers don’t have computers.”</p><p>“Do you know what a single one of those words means?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I don’t have to. That’s your forte. I’m going to be a…” She clicked the mousepad, and a new resume appeared. “Human Resources specialist.”</p><p>Rio snorted. For the first time in hours, an easy smile fell on her face. She couldn’t help it. Agatha was just being so… <em> Agatha </em>.</p><p>“Well, that’s not completely off-brand for you,” she said, crossing her arms. “You certainly do see humans as resources.”</p><p>Agatha clapped the computer shut, then reached up and tapped Rio on the nose.</p><p>“<em>Exactly. </em>”</p><p>Rio’s smile fell, the shock of contact reminding her what she’d come over to discuss.</p><p>“Agatha,” she restated, trying to keep the tremble out of her voice. The other vampire cocked her head to the side, raised her eyebrows, and made an annoyed ‘<em> what?’ </em> gesture with her hands. Rio sucked in a breath. “Why did you— why did you bite me?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. And there it was again, that brief <em> thing </em> crossing her face. Her nose scrunched just so, her eyebrows furrowed. It was a look of uncertainty, which on anyone else would be nothing to write home about—but Agatha Harkness didn’t <em> have </em>looks of uncertainty. They weren’t part of her facial vocabulary.</p><p>Behind Agatha’s grass green eyes, Rio could see a flurry of possible explanations run through her mind. Rio had seen this look on her before, she realized belatedly, only it happened so rarely these days, she’d forgotten what it looked like. It was the expression Agatha got when cornered. When tied up, jailed, questioned. It was her panic button.</p><p>“Oh, come on. That wasn’t a <em> bite </em>,” the vampire settled on, punctuating the point with a scoff. “My fangs just grazed you by accident. I was trying to…”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened, then closed. She gestured awkwardly with her hands.</p><p>“Trying to…?”</p><p>“Trying to get my phone back!” Agatha groaned. “I don’t know. I wasn’t kidding when I said I was hungry. I was getting a little Bloodlust-y all day doing apartment viewings. I mean did you <em> see </em> the veins on our rental agent? She was all but asking to get bitten.”</p><p>Seemingly satisfied with her own answer, Agatha slid by Rio and toward the kitchen. Her silk robe fluttered as she walked, the breeze from the open window making it wisp like a cape. She seized open the fridge and grabbed a mason jar full of red liquid. Then, looking back at Rio briefly, she grabbed another jar, and poured them both out into proper glasses from the cabinet.</p><p>Agatha was a persuasive woman, but Rio had six hundred years of experience dealing with her bullshit, and she could see the crater-sized holes in Agatha’s explanation. The woman wasn’t even trying to hide how bad of an answer it was.</p><p>Which was strange, because when Agatha meant to do something, she had been planning it for days, weeks, <em> months </em> beforehand—leaving Rio with the empty, confused feeling that it really had been a mistake. A one-off. An <em> accident </em>.</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>A hand on her hip, Agatha stood in front of her, offering her a tall glass of hemoglobin.</p><p>Rio frowned at it. Agatha frowned at her frown.</p><p>“Can we seriously just drop this? I didn’t mean to do it. I just…” Agatha groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose and squeezing her eyes shut. “Yesterday was terrible. The last week has been terrible. We’re running out of money, and we haven’t been able to afford the premium stuff in months.”</p><p>She gestured toward the glass for emphasis. The blood inside it was ruddy, already turning pinkish with age.</p><p>“So sue me if you smelled good, alright?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth went dry. Did she just say—</p><p>“I’m sorry. I <em> smelled </em> good?”</p><p>Agatha groaned loudly. “Are you suffering from hearing loss?”</p><p>Agatha was far past annoyed—she was downright <em> uncomfortable </em>. It actually filled Rio with glee, seeing her like this. She was starting to get it now. Everything was becoming crystal clear. This hadn’t been some crazy ploy to mess with Rio. This hadn’t been anything, actually. This had been Agatha Harkness so desperately sick of eating discount blood from the blood bank, to the point where she genuinely had a Bloodlust Blackout and tried to chew on Rio like livestock.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio giggled.</p><p>“Rio, if you don’t stop laughing right now, I <em> will </em> stake you.”</p><p>“So you can spill more of my blood to sniff?”</p><p>“Oh, fuck you. I’m grabbing the pitchfork.”</p><p> </p><p align="center"><br/>***<br/><br/></p><p align="center"> </p><p>With Rio’s blooming existential crisis now squashed, her and Agatha moved swiftly onwards with their plan. Well, <em> Agatha’s </em>plan. </p><p>Rio would never divine something so stupidly ambitious.</p><p>“Your name is going to be Rio Valdez,” Agatha explained as they walked through the streets of downtown Manhattan, the sun beating over their hat-covered heads. “And I’ll be Agnes Wilkstone. My interview is at ten-thirty, and yours is at twelve. Did you read the notes I gave you?”</p><p>“Wait, why do you get a different first name and I don’t?”</p><p>Agatha halted on the street, turned around, and glared at her.</p><p>“Because you never respond to aliases, Rio. You just get confused and blow our cover like fifteen minutes in.”</p><p>“That’s not true.”</p><p>“Are you going to make me call you something else for the rest of the day just to prove my point?”</p><p>Rio considered it, then nodded. “Yes.”</p><p>Agatha patted her warmly on the cheek. “No chance in hell. Now pick up the pace, the sun is melting my eyelash extensions off.”</p><p>VioCroft Labs reigned at the very tip of the Financial District, tall and thin like a twenty-four story needle. The building was wall-to-wall glass, like a body where you could see all the organs. The organs in question were mostly twenty-two year olds fresh out of various Ivy Leagues, busy-bodies who wore jeans to the office, took meetings all day, and had those megawatt pearly-white smiles that only people with money did. Rio immediately detested them.</p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, was schmoozing. <em> But when was she not? </em> They had arrived in the door only ten minutes ago and she’d already assembled a small posse around her. All interns, if Rio had heard correctly. They were looking at Agatha in her slim-fit pantsuit like she ruled the world. Rio couldn’t really blame them.</p><p>“And then I told Steve Jobs to <em> stuff it! </em>” Agatha was somehow whispering and shouting at the same time. Watching their gaping faces, she dropped her voice conspiratorially low. “But don’t tell anyone that. I’m technically still under NDA.”</p><p>“You’re amazing,” one of them said. The others fervently nodded.</p><p>Rio withheld a groan.</p><p>“Ms. Wilkstone?” The secretary had come to interrupt what would likely have spiraled into Agatha signing autographs. “Mr. Hernandez is ready to speak with you.”</p><p>Agatha laid a hand on the secretary’s back, her eyes shining red.</p><p>“Oh, <em> wonderful</em>.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s interview, evidently, went very well. Mr. Hernandez emerged from the room first, a dumb smile on his face that didn’t fade even as he walked back to his office. Agatha followed out soon after, her pockets mysteriously full of something where they had been empty before.</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrow, pointing at her pockets.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked innocently. “I just felt like the candy in there needed liberating.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh. Of course.</p><p>“Seriously? Stealing<em> candy? </em> Are you ten years old?”</p><p>Agatha popped a red and white mint into her mouth and grinned. “Something like that. Give or take a few thousand. Now come on, stop being so grumpy. You’re up next.”</p><p>Rio followed Agatha’s gaze over her shoulder, where a blonde woman in a no-nonsense suit was fastly approaching. Unlike Hernandez, this woman did not seem like an easy charmer. She was wearing a frown when she asked Rio to sit down, and that frown didn’t leave her face for a solid twenty minutes into their interview. In fact, it grew into a scowl.</p><p>“If I may speak frankly, Ms. Valdez,” the woman said, cutting Rio off mid-explanation about what a CPU was. Which was fortuitous timing, because Rio had zero idea. “Despite your qualifications, I feel like you do not have a great sense for backend programming.” </p><p>Rio wanted to say <em> no shit, Sherlock, </em>but she knew Agatha would yell at her for sabotaging the plan or whatever later, so instead—she smiled.</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear you think that. May I ask why you’ve come to that conclusion?”</p><p>The woman blinked incredulously at her.</p><p>“Where do I start? You’ve disastrously failed every single programming problem I’ve laid out for you so far. You’ve misunderstood basic terminology several times over—I mean, recursion is a basic principle of computer science, not a genre of television—and every time I speak, it only takes a few seconds before you start staring out of the window and looking at that <em> woman </em> sitting in the hallway.” The lady jutted her thumb out toward Agatha, who grinned, and waved back.</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip to stifle a laugh. Jesus Christ.</p><p>She turned back to the woman, and gave her an apologetic smile. Not for the terrible interview, which was actually pretty entertaining—the vein on this woman’s forehead bulged every time Rio gave an answer—but for what she was about to do next.</p><p>“Listen.” Rio placed her hand over the woman’s own, where it was fidgeting with a pencil. The woman looked at it, stunned, but didn’t pull away as Rio’s eyes began to glow red. “This has been a great conversation. I’ve been a phenomenal candidate. I mean like, probably the best you’ve ever interviewed. I answered all of your questions perfectly, and went the extra mile with my answers. I’m super good at Kubernetes, or whatever the fuck. You’re going to go back to your boss with rave reviews about me, and tomorrow I’ll wake up with an email saying I got the job. Alright?”</p><p>The woman’s eyebrows furrowed as her own eyes began to turn red. She looked halfway between nodding yes and nodding no. </p><p>“I’m not sure that’s true…” the woman mumbled noncommittally. “I feel like the interview went poorly, actually.”</p><p>“It is. Super true. All of it. It was a great interview. Why would it not be?”</p><p>Rio was growing agitated. Suggestion was really Agatha’s forte, not hers. She could do it, sure, but half the time her victims snapped out of it before it could really take hold.</p><p>The woman’s eyes began to clear, and her frown was returning. <em> Damn it </em>.</p><p>The door to the office snapped open. Long brown hair whisked in.</p><p>Agatha gave Rio a shit-eating grin.</p><p>“I’ve got this under control,” Rio muttered.</p><p>“Sure you do,” Agatha laughed meanly.</p><p>The other vampire didn’t even have to lay a hand on the blonde. She just stood there, a hand on her hip, eyebrow cocked, and the woman turned to her.</p><p>“You’re going to hire her,” Agatha said, pointing to Rio. “Okay?”</p><p>The woman swallowed hard, blinked twice, then nodded.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “For fuck’s sake.”</p>

<p>Rio hadn’t worked a real, human job in, well… It occurred to her that maybe she had <em> never </em> worked a real human job, at least as long as she’d been a vampire. She was sure in the twenty-two years that preceded her turning, she’d done some sort of labor. She faintly recollected pulling carrots from dirt, cleaning them, chopping them. She’d been your typical 10th century farm hand wench. Maybe? Again, memory—fickle creature. </p><p>But not as fickle as fucking <em> Kubernetes. </em></p><p>Rio inwardly groaned as she tapped fruitlessly at her mouse. She’d been downloading and re-downloading the same program over and over, but it refused to boot up. <em> Boot up. </em> Was that even the right word? She was so in over her head. </p><p>Even logging into the laptop to begin with had been a chore—why is the power button a weird circle with a line through it? Wouldn’t it make more sense if it just said the word <em> power </em>, for fuck’s sake?—and then there was the whole ordeal with the username (this is something like an alias) and the password (like the combination for a safe.)</p><p>Agatha, meanwhile, was having a grand time. Rio knew this because she could hear her cackle of a laugh carrying three rooms over. Agatha’s job mostly consisted of conducting a ritual she referred to as “one on ones.”</p><p>Rio had asked what this term meant, and Agatha summarized it as a time for aggrieved employees to mumble their problems at Agatha, and for Agatha to quietly assure them that they were being listened to, only for her to do nothing, then repeat the same process the next week.</p><p>Apparently, hiring a human resources specialist was just the mortal equivalent of hiring a gaslighting sadist for your workplace, so really, Agatha was perfect for the job. No pretense required.</p><p>Rio was not nearly as lucky.</p><p>“Hey– uh, hi there.”</p><p>Rio momentarily paused her all-out assault on the computer mouse to drift her head in the direction of a shy little voice—one she immediately assigned to the small, curly-headed boy sitting next to her.</p><p>She hadn’t noticed him until now, but given that he was posted by his own monitor and sitting at his own office chair, he’d probably been there the whole time.</p><p>“I’m Billy.” The boy laughed nervously, sticking his hand out. Rio stared at the hand, then back up at him. He quickly retracted it. “Ah—sorry. Not everyone is a handshaker. You’re Rio right? Today’s your first day?” She squinted, then nodded. “Oh, awesome. I’m so glad to have you on the team. I mean, we’ve been totally swamped with this upcoming deadline. Having some extra muscle to push through is like, a godsend.”</p><p>“Uh huh.”</p><p>Rio was already growing disinterested. But this child was apparently her team member, so she had to at least seem polite. And maybe she could get something out of it, too.</p><p>He continued rambling. “You know, maybe you and I could get lunch together today? I could show you around the office? There’s this <em> great </em> view on the top floor. You can see the whole city—”</p><p>“Do you know how to download Github?”</p><p>He stared at her like she’d just grown horns.</p><p>“Sorry.” He frowned. “Github? You don’t know how to download Git?”</p><p><em> Shit. </em> He already looked suspicious. Ugh. Ugh. <em> Ugh. </em> Rio wracked her brain for everything she knew about computers. Some kind of excuse. Her eyes widened. <em> That’s it</em>.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said, smiling tersely. “I’m a Windows girl. I’ve never used a Mac before.”</p><p>All confusion immediately melted away.</p><p>“Oh, of <em> course </em>. Well, let me introduce you to the superior operating system.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Please </em>tell me we can quit soon,” Rio whined.</p><p>The tea kettle whistled in the kitchen as Rio rested her head on the couch, her eyes closed. She could hear Agatha’s pattering footsteps treading back and forth, back and forth. She always paced when she had a problem she couldn’t solve.</p><p>Usually it was endearing, but Rio hadn’t slept in days because of having to work human hours, and she was starting to slowly lose her mind.</p><p>“Not yet.” Water rushed as Agatha poured it from the kettle, and the scent of peppermint filled the room. The vampire’s slippers tracked across the floor to her, and soon enough green eyes were boring down on Rio. “I’ve been trying to get a meeting with Tommy all week, but he won’t respond to any of my slack messages. Some boss.”</p><p>Agatha lifted Rio’s legs and slunk underneath them, placing them back on her lap as she blew on the top of her tea. Rio made a small noise of protest, but she didn’t really mean it. They almost always sat like this—some part of them touching. Vampires were tactile animals; and Agatha even more so, even if she’d never admit it. </p><p>Rio studied Agatha’s face as she drank. Moonlight splayed across her nose, her jaw; Rio found herself staring at Agatha’s lips as she lifted the burning liquid to her mouth, then swallowed. Watched as her neck bobbed. Listened as she made that little <em> ah </em> sound, smiling into the vapor.</p><p><em> She looks beautiful. </em> </p><p>Rio blinked. </p><p>The thought caught her off guard—not because she hadn’t thought it before, she’d thought it plenty of times. </p><p>But because she’d never thought it so intensely. With an<em> urge </em>attached to it. </p><p>An urge? Rio found herself dumbfounded at her own thoughts. <em> An urge to do what? </em> Rio didn’t know. All she knew was that looking at Agatha was making her fingers itch. She gripped the side of the couch, trying to knead out the tension she was feeling.</p><p><em> Maybe the terrible quality blood is getting to me too, </em> she thought as her nails dug into cheap plastic. <em> The nutritional profile probably seriously decays after sitting around for a few days. Maybe I can find a way to get some better quality blood for both of us. So we don’t… </em></p><p>Rio’s mind trailed off. Don’t what? What was she afraid of happening, exactly?</p><p>Agatha’s fingers began to trail absently over her calf. Rio felt it like a gun had gone off in the apartment—her chest seizing. She didn’t let it show, though. <em> God. What is wrong with me?  </em></p><p>She didn’t want Agatha to think anything was wrong. One, because nothing <em> was </em>, and two, because that never went well. As much as Agatha liked to put on a brave face, the vampire had some deadly abandonment issues.</p><p>Consequently, their fights over the years went one of two ways—Agatha was the one to start it, and Rio waited around for her to apologize, or Rio was the one to start it, Agatha cried like a hurt puppy, and then Rio apologized for the next three weeks, feeling worse than she’d ever felt in her life. </p><p>(Then Agatha would force her to make a blood pact so that she would never bring up Agatha’s sobbing again. Rinse, repeat.)</p><p>But Agatha didn’t notice. Which Rio was happy about… until Agatha’s fingers began to knead into Rio’s leg, just around her ankle. Agatha massaged her muscles absentmindedly as she studied something on her laptop. Probably more reading about Tommy whats-his-face.</p><p>And it wasn’t that this was particularly strange, either. Again—vampires, tactile, et cetera. What was strange was how <em> aware </em> Rio was of it. How much she didn’t want it to stop.</p><p>
<em> God, how touch-starved am I? </em>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t had sex in a hundred years, give or take. The same could not be said for Agatha, who went out on the town at least twice a month, hunting down some human to invade for the night.</p><p>Rio had just never had the same needs. Most humans bored her. She found their limited view on life unattractive. How they repeated the same cycles over and over again. None of it inspired much of a sex-drive in her, so she let it fizzle.</p><p>But was that really what this was? Her <em> needs </em> rearing back to life, showing their ugly head, projecting onto her friend? It didn’t feel like it. It felt specific. Specific to Agatha. </p><p>And maybe that was all it was. Plain and true and simple and nothing at all. She just enjoyed Agatha’s touch. So what? That wasn’t new news. She loved Agatha. She loved being around Agatha. She had chosen to spend six hundred years with her, and not by herself, alone, for a reason. Why was she so in her goddamn head about this?</p><p>Because she was never very good at keeping her mouth shut about anything, Rio decided to summarize all of these ruminations with a barely intelligible mumble of, “That feels nice.”</p><p>“Huh?” Agatha peeled her eyes slowly away from the screen. “What does?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand was still working at Rio’s leg. She didn’t even seem to notice</p><p>“Your fingers.” Rio squinted. <em> That sounded bad. </em>“My leg—fuck. You know what, nevermind. It’s nice, that thing you’re doing.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands as if they had been acting of their own accord, her eyebrows raising in surprise. But she didn’t stop, like Rio feared she would, she just looked at Rio with a perplexed expression, and laughed.</p><p>“Sore muscles, huh?” She squeezed Rio’s leg harder, with a little bit of that teasing edge that Agatha always applied to everything. “Didn’t know they were working you so hard in the backend programming department.”</p><p>“Oh shut up, human resources.”</p><p>“Do you want a massage?”</p><p>Another gunshot went off in Rio’s chest. <em> Jesus </em> . She was a vampire—her heart wasn’t supposed to <em> jump </em> that hard. It was barely supposed to beat at all. She commanded her body to chill the fuck out before Agatha picked up on her heartbeat—</p><p>“Wow. Your pulse is going a mile a minute.” <em> Too late. </em>“You okay?”</p><p>Agatha seemed genuinely concerned, her eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>“I’m fine.” <em> Lie. </em>“Drank too much coffee today at the office.” <em> Another lie</em>.</p><p>“You hate coffee.”</p><p>“I know. But I hate Kubernetes more.”</p><p>“You still have no idea what that is, do you?”</p><p>“Not a single clue. But I found an intern to do my work for me.”</p><p>“Oh, <em> naughty</em>. I might have to report you to…” Agatha grinned. “Oh. <em> Me, </em>I guess.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. </p><p>“Do you offer massages to all your employees?”</p><p>That last one had just jumped out of her. Rio wasn’t mad about it, though, with the way Agatha’s face lit up in delight. She loved nothing more than the idea of a workplace transgression.</p><p>“Only you so far. Although maybe I can make a side business out of it.”</p><p><em> No, I want you all to myself </em> was the next thing that threatened to jump out of Rio’s mouth—and on any other day she wouldn’t have stopped it. But it felt different now, colored by all the jumbled thoughts in her head.</p><p>“Come on,” Agatha said, raising Rio’s legs off of her. “Turn around.”</p><p>Rio complied too easily, not trusting her mouth. She turned so she was on her stomach, and felt as Agatha climbed back on top of her, straddling her back.</p><p>Her hands traveled innocently up her spine, spreading out across her shoulder muscles. Pressing in, down, around. Rio let herself release a quiet breath out. It <em> did </em> feel nice.</p><p>Then, Agatha stilled.</p><p>Her hand glided gently over the ridge of Rio’s shoulder. Her fingers stopped right at the bite mark that she’d left there. Caressed it softly, not pressing down.</p><p> “Does this still hurt?” she whispered.</p><p>Rio’s entire body thrummed in response. She’d never felt anything quite like it—her stomach lurching, goosebumps running up her arms, her legs. It didn’t hurt when Agatha touched the mark; it was the complete opposite. It was like she wanted Agatha to rip it open again. She <em> wanted </em>—god, she wanted her fangs, her fingers, anything—</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was almost trembling, like she was feeling the same thing.</p><p>
<em> There’s no way she is.</em>
</p><p>
<em> She’s just worried about me. She just cares. </em>
</p><p>“It feels fine.” <em> Lie</em>. “It feels amazing.”</p><p>Her eyes snapped open. She hadn’t meant to say that.</p><p>Agatha went silent, her hands stilling.</p><p>Just as Rio was about to apologize, Agatha pressed. As if she had read her mind, or maybe Agatha’s mind was telling her to do the same thing, Agatha pressed on the wound with her sharp fingernails. </p><p>Rio hissed. It <em> was </em> painful. But it wasn’t only painful. </p><p>She felt that pulse again, moving through her, down to her stomach.</p><p>The hiss was enough to make Agatha stop, though. Rio had to stifle a whimper when the contact was lost.</p><p>“What feels amazing?” Agatha asked. Her voice had taken on a sort of doctorly apathy. Rio wished so badly she could see her face—see her expression.</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio mumbled into the couch. “I misspoke.”</p><p>“Bullshit.”</p><p>Rio bit hard on her own lip. <em> Fuck. </em> She’d gotten herself in this mess. </p><p>Might as well be honest.</p><p>“It feels good when you touch it…” She confessed. “The bite.”</p><p>“It does?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>A long pause. Agatha’s fingers circled around it, again and again. <em> Edging. </em></p><p>“I see,” Agatha said. There was that doctorly tone again. “Makes sense.”</p><p>Rio brightened, feeling like she was drowning in the ocean, and someone had tossed her a buoy to stay afloat. “It does?”</p><p>“Of course. Bites create erogenous zones.”</p><p><em> Erogenous.</em> It was such a scholarly way of putting it, that Rio almost missed the fact that Agatha had just called her horny.</p><p>She groaned. “Oh, shut up.”</p><p>She could practically <em> hear </em> Agatha’s smirk above her. “It’s nothing to be ashamed of. I mean, hasn’t it been like, a hundred years? You seriously need to come out to the club with me—”</p><p>Nope. <em> Nope</em>. Rio officially could not process more of this discussion. She bucked Agatha off of her, causing the other woman to fall to the other side of the couch with a laugh, and stood up, facing the television. Her entire body was still buzzing—she could feel Agatha’s fingers like a ghost over her skin. She needed to get rid of that sensation right now. Immediately.</p><p>“Come on, Rio, I was just joking—”</p><p>Rio gave her the middle finger, and disappeared into the bathroom. She shut the door behind her, slunk down to the cold tile floor, and breathed.</p><p>In, out. In, out.</p><p>She had no idea how many minutes passed. It all became a drunken blur. The bathroom tub took on an alien form, morphing in space, twisting into abstract shapes. Her lungs felt tight, constricted.</p><p>She only became aware of how tightly her fingers were pulling on the rug beneath her when the door abruptly swung open, and she released the rug—and tore an entire piece of puffy white fabric off with it.</p><p>Footsteps echoed loudly. Agatha knelt down in front of her, frowning deeply.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>The other vampire’s voice sounded muffled, far away, like Rio had entered a wind tunnel.</p><p>“Rio, you’re scaring me.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands were holding her arms now, pressing down. The weight felt good. Felt <em> grounding</em>. Rio didn’t realize how desperately she needed to feel that way. She wrapped her own arms around herself, and shivered. Her teeth chattered, and she felt her fangs collide against molars.</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows lifted. “<em>Oh</em>.” She gave her a worried, but relieved expression. “You— you need blood. Let me go get you some. Just stay here. Don’t move.”</p><p>So Agatha did, and she returned some vague amount of time later. Everything felt so <em> strange </em>—time felt gooey, imperceptible. The next thing she knew, she was waking up on the bathroom floor. Her head was in Agatha’s lap, and the other vampire was staring at her like she was the most important thing in the entire world.</p><p>It made Rio want to explode, just a little.</p><p>But she was still incredibly lethargic.</p><p>“What the hell just happened?” she moaned, closing her eyes. The fluorescent bathroom lights were like tiny stakes. “I feel like I just took fifteen shots of straight tequila.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha said, but her bitten lip said otherwise. She had that expression on her face that meant she was trying <em> very </em> hard to withhold something, and doing so poorly.</p><p>“Yes you do,” Rio muttered. “Out with it.”</p><p>“Err.” Was Agatha <em> blushing? </em>No, that had to be the light. Or Rio’s eyes. “No, I really don't. I’m no vampire doctor. I think you just got… lightheaded. We seriously need to get higher quality blood. We are way too rich to be living off Walmart hemoglobin.”</p><p>A smile crept up Rio’s lips despite herself.</p><p>“We’re explicitly <em> not </em> rich, Agatha.”</p><p>“We will be soon.”</p><p>Agatha had begun to dig her fingers into Rio’s scalp, itching softly. It made Rio’s entire body relax, go limp. She felt herself wading into the ocean of sleep, drifting off like a raft.</p><p>“<em>Very, very </em>soon.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio and Agatha’s friendship had very few downsides. So few that Rio could list them all off the top of her head, and count them on one hand. </p><p>The first was that they were the same age. Born two days apart. August 19 and August 21, which meant they were both Leos. And Rio had lived long enough to know star signs weren’t just ways to sell horoscope magazines to insecure women. No, the tradition of following the stars had actually started with Vampires; it was humans who took it and made it into subscription apps.</p><p> Historically, if another vampire was born in your season, under your star, it meant you were destined to be at each other's throats, one way or another. It meant that her and Agatha shared strengths—and they also shared weaknesses.</p><p>They were both cocky. Agatha more so. They were both loyal. <em> Rio </em> more so. They were both shitty at confrontation. Great at doing the confronting, terrible at being confronted. </p><p>The second downside was, in a way, the same as the first. They were born two days apart, yes, but Rio was born a human, and Agatha was born a vampire. That meant that for nineteen years, they received completely different educations. </p><p>Rio learned how to harvest vegetables, and Agatha learned how to command a room of ancient blood-sucking politicians. </p><p>Rio learned how to do basic arithmetic, and Agatha learned what it meant to bite.</p><p>Rio had been bitten only once in her life by another vampire—well, before Agatha. It had been an older man, a stranger, one that belonged to Agatha’s clan. </p><p>Rio had expunged his name and face from her mind, drowned it in the blood of every sick creature that belonged to the Harkness clan. All who she rid the Earth of, forever.</p><p>All except Agatha.</p><p>This was all to say, she knew vampire bites to do three things—to turn someone, to kill them, or to enthrall them; to make them your slave. There was apparently a <em> fourth,</em> non-lethal thing bites had the potential to do, one Agatha had mentioned maybe twice in their six hundred years together, but she’d only ever referred to it as just that—a “fourth thing.” </p><p>She refused to elaborate, even back then.</p><p>Rio had deduced that it had something to do with sex. She only guessed this because of the way that Agatha flushed whenever she brought it up, the way her hands got clammy, how her throat bobbed just a bit.</p><p>It seemed a reasonable explanation, at least superficially, that vampires might bite as some kind of erotic foreplay with a mortal victim. Personally, she had never had the urge to do so—she wouldn’t want to risk creating a thrall out of a one-night-stand.</p><p>But now, all her plausible explanations seemed to faint and die when exposed to the oxygen of reality. None of it added up in her head. Because sure, she could buy Agatha’s explanation for biting her—she was hungry, the blood-bag blood was shitty and tasteless—but what didn’t make sense was how Rio had begun to feel in the aftermath.</p><p>These… bodily <em> shocks.</em></p><p>Lethargy. Faintness. Her heartbeat racketing in her chest like a heart-attack patient.</p><p>She knew what a panic attack felt like. That had not been a panic attack.</p><p>Rio knew that. Agatha knew that. <em> And yet.</em></p><p>She was being, per usual, a total <em> asshole.</em></p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t get why you won’t just tell me about the fourth thing.”</p><p>“I <em>don’t get why you won’t just tell me about the fourth thing,”</em> Agatha repeated mockingly, lowering her voice to an almost demonic grumble—a pitiful and frankly <em> rude </em> impersonation.</p><p>Rio nearly snarled in frustration as she tried to keep pace with the other vampire. She kept losing track of her between the undulating packs of tourists and bank workers, a dust cloud of travel bags and well-ironed suits. Agatha was weaving like a bird through the crowds, stilettos tapping like percussion instruments on pavement.</p><p>Despite appearances, Agatha wasn’t speed walking <em> just </em> for the purposes of being a dick. It was half past ten, and they were late to work. Agatha would tell you it was because Rio would not stop pestering her; Rio would tell you it was because Agatha would not stop evading her very reasonable questions. Either way, the end result was the same.</p><p>The imposing facade of the VioCroft office materialized before them. Having jogged ahead of Rio to avoid further conversation, Agatha yanked open the front doors of the office and—to Rio’s surprise—actually waited for her at the gates instead of rushing upstairs.</p><p>Of course, she had to ruin what minor goodwill she’d just gained by giving Rio a ridiculous bow. Like some kind of royal butler.</p><p>Rio just sighed, her fury drained by Agatha’s idiocy.</p><p>“What on Earth are you doing?”</p><p>“Being a gentleman,” Agatha said, tipping her head back up to bat her eyelashes at Rio. “Can’t have you handling heavy machinery. You might get all faint on me again.”</p><p>“By heavy machinery you mean the <em> door?</em>”</p><p>“It’s a pretty heavy door.”</p><p>And oh, Heaven have mercy—Agatha was driving Rio absolutely insane. The green eyed vampire was flip-flopping so quickly between charm and avoidance, humor and cruelty. Rio had known her long enough to understand this was a symptom of Agatha avoiding something, but <em> what </em> she was avoiding and <em> why </em> was completely alien to Rio. A big blank spot in her mind.</p><p>Agatha gestured for Rio to go inside, but Rio shook her head.</p><p>“<em>Agatha.” </em>She laid her hand over Agatha’s warm knuckles. “We need to talk.”</p><p>Agatha tried to pull away. “I’m good, actually—”</p><p>
<em> Oh, fuck it.  </em>
</p><p>Keeping her hand firmly pressed to Agatha’s, Rio’s pupils exploded into crimson. Her fangs dug against her gums. She stared straight into Agatha’s eyes, and whispered a hint of Suggestion into them. A command. <em> Listen to me, you idiot. </em></p><p>Agatha snorted. Her pupils flared right back, and she smirked wildly. Rio felt a much larger punch of Suggestion pummel her in the gut. Like a tidal wave crashing on her sandcastle.</p><p>It said: <em>We can talk about this later. </em></p><p>It was a true testament to just how powerful Agatha was that all the fight immediately drained out of Rio’s body, replaced with a dull, agreeable apathy. </p><p>She nodded reluctantly, and they filed inside.</p><p>It wasn’t until lunch that Rio woke up from her stupor. It was like she’d been unknowingly towing around three hundred pounds of deadweight on her shoulders, only for someone to quietly inform her that she could just take it all off. The spell slid off of her like a jacket, and her eyes widened, blinking at the short boy with curly-hair.</p><p>“...And that’s how I knew I was gay,” he said.</p><p><em> What the hell? </em> Rio’s mind spun. <em> How long was I out? </em></p><p>Billy brushed a stray tear out from under his eye, then smiled at her softly.</p><p>“You’re such a good listener, Rio. Thank you for that.”</p><p>She blinked several times, then rubbed her own eyes. They felt so dry.</p><p>“Oh, don’t cry Rio. I know my coming out story is emotional, but…”</p><p><em> I’m not crying, you dipshit, </em>is what Agatha would have said, followed by <em> and I really don’t care about your coming out story,</em> but Rio was the nicer Leo, so she just stood, abruptly, and began to stalk towards the sound of Agatha’s laugh—it was echoing from down the hall like a banshee’s wail. Rio flung open several doors before she finally caught the right one.</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>“Oh, Agnes. You are a <em> hoot</em>.”</p><p>Rio stopped in her tracks. Agatha was sitting on the meeting table, her leg draped over a chair, practically spread eagle. A man in a tuxedo sat a few feet from her in an office chair, grinning like a wolf who had just snuck up on some livestock.</p><p>Rio recognized him immediately. The scruffy mustache, the toothpaste-white teeth, the gleaming blue eyes. He looked straight out of a dental advertisement. Or maybe an Axe Bodyspray one.</p><p>“<em>Ms. Valdez,</em>” Agatha gasped. “Do learn to knock, honey.”</p><p>The man, who was undoubtedly Tommy Ashcroft, looked her up and down shamelessly. “Oh it’s no problem at all Agnes, I know how in-demand you are.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, but it was too civilized and polite to be genuine.</p><p>“Oh, Mr. Ashcroft—”</p><p>He waved her off. “It’s Tommy. Really.”</p><p>“<em>Tommy </em>. Where were we? Lunch tomorrow, right?”</p><p>The man hummed. Rio honed in on his eyes, expecting to see crimson.</p><p>
<em> Wait. Why are his eyes blue? Shouldn’t they be red? </em>
</p><p>It hit Rio like a freight train. Agatha wasn’t manipulating him using her powers. She was doing it the old fashioned way, for whatever fucking reason. Plain old Harkness Charisma.</p><p>
<em> Probably just to see if she could. This absolute freak of nature. </em>
</p><p>“Tomorrow’s a little busy, but…” He began thumbing through his phone. Agatha leaned forward and batted her eyelashes, kicked her heel against his leg playfully. <em> This is literal, textbook workplace harassment </em>. “You know what, I can move some things around.”</p><p>Agatha clapped. “Brilliant! And you’ll invite Ms. Valdez, too?”</p><p>Both Rio and Tommy looked like she’d dumped a bucket of ice water on them.</p><p>“Huh?” they said in unison, looking at each other, then at Agatha, who was completely unfazed. She just shrugged, and kept that easy, gorgeous smile on her face.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to overstep. I just think Ms. Valdez could offer some insightful perspectives on the topics we were planning to discuss.”</p><p>Tommy stared at Agatha for several seconds, then laughed. “I’m sorry. I just. Let me know if I’m hearing this right. You think the IT girl has some… insightful perspectives… on how to best conduct mass layoffs without hurting your company’s brand image?”</p><p>
<em> Oh my god. </em>
</p><p>It took everything within Rio not to laugh.</p><p>Here she had assumed that Agatha had enticed the man with her sexuality. No, of course not. How outdated of Rio to guess that. They had simply bonded over being completely morally bankrupt assholes. 2025, baby. Equality for all.</p><p>“I <em> love </em> mass layoffs,” Rio said, because she couldn’t fucking help herself.</p><p>And maybe just a little bit because of the full-body smile Agatha gave her afterwards.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>That entire interaction with the CEO had been so earnestly amusing that Rio completely forgot about this morning’s argument. The pair of them talked like two chirping songbirds on the way home, going back and forth about what they intended to do with the Ashcroft family money.</p><p>“I want to buy Starbucks,” was Agatha’s idea. “Privatize it, and then make it so the only person who is allowed inside their locations is me.” She snorted. “Imagine some twenty-something college idiot strolling up to the store only to run into a <em> bouncer </em>.” She dropped her voice, doing another horrendous impersonation of a made-up man. “No fangs, no thousand-year-old sex appeal, no entrance, kiddo.” </p><p>Oh, how Rio adored this idiot. “Agatha, that’s like the most useless way to spend billions of dollars you could have possibly conceived of.”</p><p>“No it’s not.” She scoffed. “You’re so boring. Go ahead, tell me your boring answer.”</p><p>Rio took the bait. “I would open a bunch of wildlife rescue centers for endangered animals.” Agatha rolled her eyes, opening her mouth to interrupt before Rio continued, “And then I’d buy a personal militia and dismantle the US government. Kill the rest of the billionaires. Redistribute the wealth. Go full Karl Marx on ‘em.”</p><p>Agatha stopped in her tracks, mouth open.</p><p>“You’re serious?”</p><p>Rio snorted, and took Agatha’s hand without really thinking, swinging it in between them.</p><p>“Maybe. Or maybe I’d just hang out at the zoo everyday and feed the monkeys.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>This warm bubble of hypotheticals carried them to their street and up their creaky elevator, opening onto the 15th floor. They had about twelve more days in this AirBnb before they’d be forced to leave—but neither of them thought about that now. No, nothing seemed to burst the happy little cloud until the clock hit midnight, while they were lying on the couch, eating chips, watching reruns of Gilmore Girls.</p><p>“The actress who plays Lorelai is a vampire, you know.”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha in bemusement. “<em>Lauren Graham? </em>Seriously?”</p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha popped a chip in her mouth absentmindedly. Rio could almost taste the salt and vinegar just watching Agatha eat it—the smell was as powerful as an acid cloud. “She’s a shapeshifter. She’s been in every sitcom under the sun. Full House. Friends. Entourage.”</p><p>“Who was she in Friends?”</p><p>“Monica <em> and </em> Rachel,” Agatha said, then snorted. “Kidding. She was just Rachel.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “I didn’t know shapeshifting was a power.”</p><p>Lorelai and Rory chattered in the background as Agatha set her chip bag aside.</p><p>“Sure is. One of the most powerful vampiric talents there is, actually. And all she uses it for is to be in generational sitcoms. Can you believe that?” Agatha laughed tersely. “God, I would be <em> way </em> more creative if I had access to that kind of firepower.”</p><p>Rio was mesmerized, not for the first time, by that murderous glint in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“What would you do with it?” Rio whispered.</p><p>She didn’t mean to say it like that—so low, so earnest—but that’s how it came out.</p><p>Agatha smiled like a snake. She clicked <em> off </em> on the remote, and the TV shuttered into darkness. Wordlessly, she turned to Rio, so their thighs were flush on the couch. Agatha’s hair was down, wild and messy, and she was wearing one of her sleep blouses, a white, unbuttoned top.</p><p>“Remember when we enthralled the King of England?”</p><p>Agatha wrapped her hand around Rio’s, pressing her fingers into Rio’s palm. It was something she did sometimes, when she was particularly excited—she used Rio’s hand like a stress ball, kneading out that extra energy.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio breathed. “Of course I do.”</p><p>“And you remember how he broke out of our spell and burned our houses and stole all the gold from our vaults and unleashed the full power of the English army on us.”</p><p>“It rings a bell.”</p><p>“Well.” Agatha clicked her tongue, and closed her eyes, as if she was traveling back in time. “If I could shapeshift, I would have turned into his wife, and kissed you right in front of him.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know what she was expecting, but it certainly wasn’t <em> that </em>. Agatha looked so insanely pleased with herself that Rio couldn’t help but laugh with her full chest.</p><p>“You are so—”</p><p>“Wise? Genius?” Agatha interjected, grinning like a little kid. “God, imagine his face. The love of his life making out with the vampire who made him waddle around like a duck for ten years.” Agatha was laughing uncontrollably now, and it was contagious.</p><p>Eventually, Rio got a hold of herself, and shook her head. “You know, you don’t even need shapeshifting to accomplish that. You could have just enthralled her and kissed her yourself.”</p><p>Agatha gasped in offense. “I don’t kiss ladies who don’t want me to <em> kiss them,</em> Rio.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? But I do, in this scenario?”</p><p>“Of course you do. You’d love it.”</p><p>The way she said it was light, teasing, obviously facetious; their crazed laughter had made them manic, put them in another little bubble where nothing else existed except their minds, their endless imagination. It should have been a throw away line, a blip in the ocean.</p><p>But to Rio it felt like being shocked by an electric fence.</p><p>“You think I want to kiss you, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha’s grin faltered. Rio had popped their bubble with a pin-needle. She looked at a complete loss, her mouth curling around words that weren’t there.</p><p>Eventually, she said, quietly, “I was only joking.”</p><p>It was an opportunity to drop it. An olive branch that would let them return to life <em> as it was.</em> But something inside Rio burned. </p><p>She didn’t do well with uncertainty, and Agatha had been bathing her in it.</p><p>“But were you?”</p><p>Agatha’s throat bobbed, and her grip on Rio’s hand constricted. Agatha’s eyes had begun to burn the slightest shade of blood red.</p><p>“Rio, I..." Her eyes drifted to Rio's shoulder, then back at her eyes. "I need to tell you something.”</p>

<em> “I need to tell you something.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s entire face had gone shy. Which, again, was not really a facial possibility for Agatha—or at least Rio didn’t think so until now.</p><p>“Need to tell me what?”</p><p>“About the bite…”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth screwed up into a tiny puckered button of an expression, like a baby tasting a lemon, and Rio would have thought it was adorable under any other circumstance, but right now all she could feel was the anticipation rocketing through her—<em>fear,</em> undoubtedly, mixed with something else. Anticipation. Heady and urgent.</p><p>“The fourth thing…” Agatha trailed off, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Look. I don’t know how to phrase this without it becoming like, a <em> thing. </em>And it doesn’t need to be a thing.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio was starting to feel insane. “If you don’t just say whatever you’re trying to say in the next ten seconds, I’m going to have an episode.”</p><p>Rio’s joke-not-joke seemed to help the other vampire get over herself, because she released a breath, and chuckled dryly.</p><p>“Have you heard of marking?”</p><p>Rio’s brows screwed together in confusion. <em> Marking? </em> She’d heard of it vaguely—mostly, again, from Agatha, but only ever used in the derogatory sense. She’d use it to describe couples on the street that were too into PDA. <em> They’re just marking all over each other, </em>Agatha would say, and Rio would laugh, but secretly have zero idea what she was talking about. She wrote it off as some weird Harkness clan terminology.</p><p>“Not really, no.”</p><p>“Ugh.” Agatha had started blushing. “I really do not want to have to explain this.”</p><p>“Too bad. You have to.”</p><p>Agatha placed Rio’s hand down, as if she’d just realized she was holding it. The vampire instead hugged her knees to her chest, forming a protective shell with her body.</p><p>“So, well, er,” Agatha began, and Rio had certainly never seen her stutter this much in her entire life. “I know I’m like the only vampire you’ve ever actually been friends with, so it makes sense that you don’t know this—but it’s kind of awkward to explain without… context.”</p><p>Agatha ran her hands through her wild hair. Rio tried her best to concentrate on her lips, and not her fingers. This woman was so constantly in motion; it was distracting.</p><p>“Essentially, when two vampires… like each other… very much…” Agatha said, then groaned, then started again, “They sometimes bite each other. The kind of bite you do when you want to enthrall someone. This is called marking.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, her pulse quickening. Agatha had begun to pick at her nails incessantly to avoid looking at the other woman.</p><p>“But why would they do that?” Rio asked, genuinely confused. “What if they accidentally enthrall their partner? That doesn’t sound romantic, turning them into an effective slave.”</p><p>Agatha looked up at her and smiled softly. “No, it doesn’t. But marking is different. When you enthrall someone, they, well—they fight it, right? You can feel their soul resisting. But with marking, when your lover, partner, whatever—” She blushed harder. “When they bite you, you don’t resist. You trust them so completely that you don’t fight it at all. That’s called a soul mark.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips stilled, apparently finished with her explanation. The knowledge roiled around in Rio’s mind, desperately finding a folder to fit in. It all made sense, somewhat. But then again, it didn’t. She didn’t see the point. Why would you ever risk that?</p><p>“I still don’t understand the purpose.”</p><p>Agatha laughed coldly. As if Rio had said something funny.</p><p>“Me neither.” She shrugged. “Never have. In my clan, it was just something you did to whoever you were arranged to marry. You can imagine how disinterested I was in that.”</p><p>Rio smiled easily, imagining younger Agatha.</p><p>They just looked at each other for a moment, caught in memory, like whatever tension had existed an hour ago had evaporated into thin air.</p><p>Agatha clapped her hands together. “Great, so now that we discussed this, maybe we can go back to watching Lauren Graham do her thing—”</p><p>“—but what does any of this have to do with what’s going on with me?”</p><p>Rio realized that Agatha had completely avoided the whole purpose of this conversation.</p><p>And in true Agatha fashion, she had done it so deftly that Rio had almost failed to notice.</p><p>“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Agatha muttered, like this was an episode of Scooby Doo, and she’d been caught redhanded. “Okay, okay.”</p><p>She closed her eyes, took a deep breath in, then delivered her next words in a mumbled, disorganized, barely intelligible sigh:</p><p>“As we talked about before, I was really hungry the other night, and you had just gotten out of the shower, so you smelled good, like that dumb rose petal body wash you use, whatever, fuck, and you took my phone, so I was annoyed, maybe a little turned on for reasons unknown, I just get like that, alright? A woman has needs. And you’re not <em> ugly.</em> And I haven’t been to the club in days. Weeks. Maybe years.” Rio glared at her as if to say <em> Cut the shit. </em> “Okay, <em> days. </em>I haven’t been in days. So I was a little… wound up. So my teeth enter your neck. Oops.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands were gesticulating wildly. It took everything in Rio not to wind them behind her back—they were making it almost impossible to concentrate.</p><p>“And because I didn’t bite you with the intention to kill you, or enthrall you, I guess I must have bitten you a little bit the <em> other </em> way. Look, I didn’t know I could even do that! It’s never happened before. It just sort of…” She bared her fangs, then shrugged. “And I think it’s all because you—well—you didn’t—”</p><p>“I didn’t <em> what, </em> Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha threw up her hands in annoyed huff.</p><p>“You didn’t resist!”</p><p>Rio blinked at her. Agatha bit down on her lip, hard.</p><p>“I guess I just trust you,” Rio said. Because it was the truth.</p><p>“Which, like, <em> thanks. </em>I appreciate that, or whatever,” Agatha muttered. “But that backfired. Because I think I gave you the vampire equivalent of blue balls.”</p><p>“You… wait, what?”</p><p>Rio’s stomach did somersaults. Did she hear that right? No, she couldn’t have.</p><p>But instead of backtracking, Agatha plowed forward.</p><p>“I didn’t do it all the way,” she clarified, her voice throaty, and Rio felt those words in her stomach, no, lower. She felt them throb. “I stopped too soon.” Her heartbeat thudded in her chest. “So your body was like, what the fuck. Give me more.”</p><p><em> Fuck.</em> Rio swallowed. She wanted to say something; Agatha was looking at her like she was supposed to say something–but she couldn’t. Her mouth was so dry. She felt so <em> needy</em>.</p><p>But what could she do? Confirm it? Admit it? It’s not like Agatha actually wanted to kiss her. And it’s not like she actually wanted to kiss Agatha. This was all one long, drawn out vampiric misunderstanding.</p><p>They weren’t going to blow six hundred years of friendship on a stupid biological blip.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said earnestly, which was about as rare as a pig growing wings. “I wish there was something that I could do to help.” Rio couldn’t stop staring at her lips. <em> Fuck. Fuck. </em>“But I really wasn’t joking when I said I’m not a vampire doctor. I know some basic information about our physiology, but I left all my books on the more specific subjects back in London, and—”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said weakly. Her fingers were shaking. “How long does it take to wear off?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip in a frown. She <em> did </em> look horribly regretful, which was making this all so much worse for Rio. Because Agatha regretted almost nothing. But this, somehow, was so terrible?</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “<em>Fuck. </em>”</p><p>They sat in silence for a moment, Rio’s head in her hands, Agatha’s mouth uncharacteristically still. Rio wasn’t sure how much time passed until Agatha spoke again.</p><p>“What does it feel like?” she said, then continued, “Like—what are the symptoms?”</p><p>Of all the things she expected Agatha to say, she didn’t expect <em> that</em>. Agatha’s pupils were dilated like two small suns, her eyes narrowed in genuine curiosity. And Rio burned with embarrassment.</p><p>Because what was she supposed to say?</p><p>
<em> It makes me feel insane. Like I want you to devour me. Like I want your teeth so deeply inside my skin that they never come out. </em>
</p><p>Rio tried to sound apathetic and emotionally removed when she said, “I have this absolutely unquenchable need for you to bite me again.”</p><p>The admission sat like a heavy block between them. Rio stared at Agatha, and Agatha stared back, neither saying anything. Rio watched as Agatha’s neck bobbed. Her fingers dug into the cushion of the sofa. The other vampire’s eyes were glowing redder by the second. </p><p>
<em> Wait. What? </em>
</p><p>Was this… doing something to Agatha?</p><p>
<em> But the effects should only go one way. </em>
</p><p>Confirmation came almost as soon as Rio could think of it.</p><p>“I want to bite you again so<em> badly,</em>” Agatha breathed.</p><p>Rio had never felt her body react in the way it reacted to those words.</p><p>She whined. “Then <em> do it.</em>”</p><p>Agatha lunged forward, pinning Rio to the couch just like before. Only this time, there was no pretense—no struggle—Rio was simply prey, her body a ragdoll.</p><p>She arched into the contact as soon as Agatha’s fangs connected with the spot—that same spot—plunging in.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Rio cried.</p><p>Faintly, like a far away television, Rio could hear the sound of Agatha drinking. Blood seeping out of her veins into Agatha’s open mouth.</p><p>It was the most pleasurable thing in the universe, Rio decided. Nothing would ever compete. </p><p>Everything, every sense, every tiny motion of Agatha’s hands in her hair, Agatha’s hips on her hips, Agatha’s tongue on her neck, took on an overwhelming level of intensity—it was like she was seeing color she’d never seen before.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was coming faster and faster. “Don’t stop—don’t stop—”</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>Rio’s hips bucked up, unprovoked. Agatha had said her name in a way she’d never spoken it in six hundred years.</p><p>It was something between a growl and a confession.</p><p>Then, abruptly, like being struck with a bullet, it stopped.</p><p>Agatha’s teeth ripped from her neck, the other vampire colliding backwards, onto the floor. Her chest was heaving, her pupils so large they were nearly black discs.</p><p>Agatha looked up at her, completely and totally fucked.</p><p>“I’m—” Agatha stuttered. “I thought I should stop, before I…”</p><p>Rio understood what she meant immediately.</p><p>“Of course,” Rio agreed, pretending like all of this was reasonable. Because it was. Totally reasonable. They were just responding to symptoms. Addressing an… ailment. “It’s good that you did.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“<em>Yeah.</em>”</p>

<p>They didn’t say another word to each other until the next morning.</p><p>If given the option, they probably wouldn’t have talked for a full week—maybe a month. Again, between two avoidant Leos, it sometimes became a competition to see who could endure the silent treatment the longest. Historically, it had been Agatha. Rio tended to give in first. She was just that way, a giver. </p><p>But not now. Now, she was… speechless, really.</p><p>But they didn’t have the luxury of time to wait around. They had a very important date the next morning. One they couldn’t awkward their way around. </p><p>And that was with Tommy Ashcroft.</p><p>So, in another first to add to the mounting lists of firsts between them, Agatha was the one to break the ice.</p><p>She did it over coffee. It was five A.M,  the sun was barely awake on the horizon outside the apartment, and neither of them had gotten a wink of sleep. Rio knew this because Agatha had been silent the whole night. No grunts or other animalistic noises. Just the soft sounds of her head rolling back and forth on the pillow, trying and failing to get comfortable.</p><p>“Do you feel… better?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up at Rio when she asked it. She just whisked her coffee with a tiny metal spoon, staring into the whirlpool of brown and white. </p><p>Rio was leaning on a chair, a black robe dangling from her body, drinking her own cup. She held the hot liquid in her mouth for several seconds, thinking of how to reply.</p><p>But nothing smart or tasteful came to her. She’d been thinking about this question all night—about if she was <em> healed </em> now, if she was <em> fixed—</em>and still, she didn’t have an answer.</p><p>When Rio didn’t respond, Agatha risked a glance up at her. Her green eyes settled on the re-opened bite mark, and Rio felt her gaze like an electric current.</p><p>“It looks like it’s fading.”</p><p>Look, now they were both liars.</p><p>“Maybe we fixed it. By addressing it…” Agatha cleared her throat. “Head on?”</p><p>Rio wanted to nod and say <em> yes </em>, because that would be very convenient. God, she wanted so badly to nod and say yes, because then they could just put whatever this was into a corner in both of their brains and forget about it.</p><p>But then she would be lying. And Rio was very bad at lying.</p><p>But she also hated seeing Agatha look like this. Without all her usual blustering confidence.</p><p>And after all, it wasn’t like they could do it again. Doing it again meant risking doing it for <em> real </em>. And doing it for real was clearly a very serious thing to do—a declaration that neither of them was interested in. It wouldn’t just be stupid, it’d be beyond that.</p><p>So Rio found a middle ground.</p><p>“I think it improved things.” Not technically a lie. It <em> had </em> felt amazing.</p><p>“Oh. Good. That’s… good.”</p><p>They stared at each other in awkward, terrible silence.</p><p>Agatha sighed and tangled her hands through her hair. If it was a mess last night, today it was totally untameable. She knew Agatha would beat it into submission before they headed to the office, but Rio almost didn’t want her to. It framed her face so beautifully, curled around the pale flesh of her shoulders. Rio wanted so badly to put her hands in it.</p><p><em> No, </em> she chastised herself. <em> Don’t think things like that. </em></p><p>
<em> Why not? You’ve played with Agatha’s hair tons of times. Why should it be weird now? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Because it *is* weird now. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Great, you’re talking to yourself. That bodes well. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Oh, shut up. </em>
</p><p>Rio quieted the voices in her head by just going for it. She took two silent steps forward, then slid her hand against the back of Agatha’s neck before bunching her fingers in her hair. Agatha went stock still, eyes like a frightened gazelle.</p><p>“You didn’t sleep much, did you?” Rio said lightly, trying to play the gesture off as friendly concern. “Your hair is a bird’s nest.”</p><p>Agatha blinked several times, but ultimately softened into the action. She inched closer to Rio, maybe not intentionally, and brought the cup of coffee to her lips. “I did not.”</p><p>Rio hummed. She replayed last night in her head for what felt like the millionth time, and it made warmth crawl over her skin all over again. She wished so badly that she had the words to cross this bridge between them, but the bridge felt perilous, like it was made of creaking, splintering wood.</p><p>She settled on whatever thought felt the most honest.</p><p>“Being a vampire is strange, isn’t it?”</p><p>At that, Agatha seemed to unwind just a smidgen—laughing lightly.</p><p>“I’ve never known anything different.”</p><p>“I have,” Rio said, even though it was obvious. “I think. I can barely remember it now, but I can still feel the edges of it. The silhouette of the whole… human experience.”</p><p>Agatha got that glint in her eye again. That sharp curiosity.</p><p>“Yeah?”<br/><br/>“Yeah.”</p><p>“What was it like?”</p><p>The parallel of Agatha’s question to last night—“<em>What does it feel like?”</em>—was not lost on Rio. Mostly because despite the superficial similarity—the words, and who asked them—the two questions could not land more differently in Rio’s chest.</p><p>Last night, Rio’s mind had painted a picture of Agatha that she’d never seen before. It was one colored completely by hunger—plain, feral,<em> foreign </em> hunger. She’d experienced a connection with an ancient, primal part of herself that she wasn’t really sure how she felt about yet. Like meeting a relative that you didn’t know you had. </p><p>But now, her hands in Agatha’s hair, smoothing it softly, Agatha drinking her coffee, the smell of burnt mocha in the air, she was reminded of who they actually were.</p><p>Who they’d been for six hundred years.</p><p> Friends. </p><p>And she didn’t mean that diminutively. She meant it with all the love in the world.</p><p>She sagged into Agatha, placing her forehead on the other woman’s neck.</p><p>“Honestly?” Rio whispered into her skin. She felt Agatha shiver, but didn’t say anything about it. It was probably her breath—cold as ice. “The pain is really what I remember most about it. The little cuts and bruises. The way my arms would ache if I slept on them wrong. The human body is so weak, it’s like carrying around a paper bag in a storm.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. How Rio loved that stupid little sound.</p><p>The other vampire pulled her in close, tugging her arms around her back.</p><p>“Tell me more,” Agatha hummed.</p><p>So Rio did.</p><p>Rio told her every memory she could recollect. Most Agatha had heard already, like about Rio’s parents, two faceless farmers with tan skin and wrinkled hands. Others she hadn’t, like about Rio’s village friends. Other girls who worked the fields, who would make bracelets out of grass and flower stems and tie them around Rio’s wrists.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure how long she talked for. She just let herself sink into Agatha’s touch, let the other vampire carry her full weight. They talked about everything but last night—everything but what had irrevocably changed between them—and somehow, that made it feel like nothing had changed at all. The four alarm fire of panic in her brain had dulled to a quiet smoking flame.</p><p>She must have fallen silent, because Agatha’s fingers itched across Rio’s scalp.</p><p>“We’re okay,” she whispered into Rio’s ear. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio said, trying to imbue her voice with confidence she didn’t really have.</p><p>“You’re right. Being a vampire <em> is </em> fucking strange. So I bit you twice. <em> And?  </em>Sometimes desperate times, desperate measures. Fuck,” Agatha laughed then, and it didn’t even sound forced. “God knows we’ve endured stranger things than a little shoulder-sucking.”</p><p>Rio’s face burned, but she still found herself grinning.</p><p>“You mean this <em> wasn’t </em>as weird as that time you had to sow my arm back onto my body?”</p><p>“Please. That was nothing. Remember when we killed those two stockbrokers and then dressed them in tutus for the police to find?” Agatha all but cackled. “Oh my god.”</p><p>Rio nearly buckled over in laughter at the memory.</p><p>“Remember the statement the police gave the next day.” She wiped a tear from her eye.</p><p>Agatha dropped into her ridiculous impersonation voice. “<em> The bodies of respected businessmen Alexander Howard and Wesley Smith were found in rather unusual circumstances.” </em></p><p>Rio cut in, “<em> Naked, afraid, and dressed like… ballerinas?” </em></p><p>The taut string of comedy burst. The two of them laughed like schoolgirls, holding each other for balance. By the time they finally caught their breath, tears were streaking down both their faces. Rio’s grin had never been wider as she looked at Agatha then—at her smeared mascara, her black eyeliner wet and smudged. Wrecked, but beautifully.</p><p>She raised her thumb to wipe under Agatha’s eye.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You’re going to have to fix this…”</p><p>It had been a completely organic gesture, something she’d done millions of times before, but the reaction on Agatha’s face was nothing ordinary. As Rio’s thumb brushed gently against her, Agatha’s lips curled up in unbearable softness. Her eyes creased happily. It was an expression that said, <em> I feel safe in your hands. </em>She doubted Agatha even knew she was doing it.</p><p>It took everything inside Rio to not react.</p><p>Had Agatha always looked at her this way?</p><p>Rio couldn’t be sure now. It was like she was an actor on a set, and someone had moved around the lighting. Everything had a different shadow to it now.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to say something, but then her Apple Watch began to ring.</p><p>“Damn it.” Agatha groaned. They both realized it at the same time. “<em> Work </em>.”</p><p>The two of them separated slowly, then all at once. </p><p>The soft intimacy they’d sank back into had left as quickly as it arrived.</p><p>Rio wasn’t particularly disappointed about it, though. She was just happy things felt as normal as they could again. Agatha seemed to feel the same, as she shot Rio the slightest hint of a smile before shucking on her coat—and her public-facing personality.</p><p>“Last night was just an appetizer,” Agatha grinned, fangs glinting. “Time for <em> lunch. </em>”</p><p>Agatha stalked out the door, a blaze of confidence into the Manhattan streets, and Rio, well…</p><p>Rio had to remind herself to breathe.</p><p align="center"><br/>***</p><p> </p><p>She should have known Agatha would make a joke out of it.</p><p>The awkward phase had lasted approximately forty-five minutes, and now the dam had broken—and Agatha’s was delighting in the full fury of the stream. Since they had decided the whole thing was just a weird one-off, chalked it up to the oddities of vampire biology, it was simply another hilarious memento between them. Well, maybe for Agatha.</p><p>Rio, again, was still remembering how to use her lungs.</p><p>“Hello. <em> Hello? </em>Earth to Rio?” Agatha moaned. “God, will you stop doing whatever nerd shit you’re doing and just look at me? Or do I have to bite you again to get you to pay attention?”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped up from her keyboard. Her cheeks were already flushed just hearing that first sound come out of Agatha’s throat, but by the time she got to the end of her sentence, her ears were bright pink. Agatha delighted in it.</p><p>
<em> Fucking sadist. </em>
</p><p>“Come on, we’re going to be late for lunch.”</p><p>“Did she just imply that she’s bitten you before?”</p><p>Apparently her and Agatha weren’t the only two people in the world. Rio had honestly forgotten. Billy was sitting next to her, typing away at Rio’s current work assignment, looking mildly horrified but also very intrigued.</p><p>“It’s a metaphor,” Rio muttered.</p><p>“It’s not,” Agatha said, grinning brazenly. Then, with a wink, she added, “I bite all the bad employees.”</p><p>Billy laughed nervously, looking at Rio for help.</p><p>She shrugged, rising from her seat. Rio’s office chair spun idly in the background as Billy watched them go. It took him several seconds before realizing that he should probably say something.</p><p>Because, well, Rio hadn’t done a single one of her own work items since arriving—and he had been swamped to begin with—and now she was having lunch at 2pm, and 3pm, and also 4pm. His adolescent mind swam. This seemed like something you’d bring up with HR.</p><p>He frowned. Right.</p><p>“My life sucks,” he muttered to his computer.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Tommy Ashcroft was a luxurious man, which meant he ate luxurious things for lunch. Things like fish roe, and beef tartar, and other assorted stomach nightmares.</p><p>At least, this is what Rio imagined he told himself, to justify whatever monstrosity they were currently being served by a waiter in a tuxedo. They were the only ones in the top-floor restaurant. He’d rented it out.</p><p>“I rented it out,” he said, as if it wasn’t absolutely fucking obvious.</p><p>“I see that,” Agatha said sweetly. Rio could see the crack in her facade when she actually looked at the food, though. Agatha was a picky eater, and not a huge fan of shellfish. But above everything, she was a great liar. “This is like, my favorite dish ever.”</p><p>Tommy grinned. “The Lobster Clam Inversion?”</p><p>Agatha hummed an affirmative as she notably did <em> not </em> touch the Lobster Clam Inversion.</p><p>“So,” Agatha said, clapping her hands. “Shall we get into business?”</p><p>“Business?” Tommy frowned. “And here I thought we were going to do cocaine together.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows rose comically. Even <em> Agatha </em>hadn’t been expecting that one.</p><p>The HR lady’s mouth opened, then shut, trying and failing to come up with some kind of comeback before Tommy burst out in laughter.</p><p>“God, your faces!”</p><p>Agatha chuckled dryly. Rio knew she was currently brainstorming ways to disfigure him.</p><p>He waved his hand dismissively. “The cocaine clearly comes <em> after </em> we figure out this whole ugly layoff business.” Rio was still not sure if he was serious.</p><p>Either way, they did eventually start to discuss the layoffs. Rio mostly listened, jumping in every so often with something she knew would make Agatha break character just a little.</p><p>There was nothing more fun than messing with Agatha when she was particularly committed to a bit—it was like poking a tiger while it was hunting prey. The other vampire glared at her so many times she thought she might genuinely bite her in front of Tommy.</p><p>“You’ve got a great mind on those sexy shoulders, Agnes.”</p><p>And oh, of course, there it was. Rio bit hard on her lip to stifle a laugh.</p><p>“Guilty as charged,” Agatha replied easily. “So, Tommy. I was thinking, you have a big investor meeting coming up, right? Since I’ve been so helpful with this, maybe I can help you out with that presentation? I really know how to work a Powerpoint.”</p><p>Agatha said Powerpoint like it was the dirtiest word in the dictionary.</p><p>Rio smirked. God, how she loved watching Agatha work.</p><p>Tommy’s father, the CEO of Ashcroft Oil, was one of his chief investors. A ticket to that meeting meant being in immediate proximity to his father. And at the end of the day, <em> that </em> was their big goal. Little Timmy was a small fry compared to his father’s fortune.</p><p>Agatha and her had discussed just making Tommy the thrall instead of his father—it was simpler that way, and definitely easier—but they both knew that was a short-sighted plan. Nepo babies always had a tight leash. Papa bear would notice soon enough all the funds leaving his son’s account, and turn off the tap. </p><p>They couldn’t have that. They needed unfettered access. Tommy was just a pawn on the chess board.</p><p>The CEO’s smile faltered.</p><p>“Oh, well…” he trailed off. “That’s a considerate offer, Agnes. But those meetings are really not for regular employees. Lots of confidential information, you know.”</p><p>Agnes—Rio blinked. Jesus, her acting was so good, she was starting to lose track—<em> Agatha </em> took the rejection in stride, putting her hand over Tommy’s and— <em> oh </em> —her eyes were turning bright red. A tongue ran over Agatha’s lips. Rio’s body began to hum. <em> The fuck? </em> No, it was not <em> humming. </em>But, god—it was. <em> It was, </em>wasn’t it? Her eyes were stuck to Agatha’s mouth, waiting, waiting—</p><p>
<em> Please. Please, please. </em>
</p><p>She realized, with a modest amount of humiliation, that she had become a complete slave to Agatha’s fangs. All in under twenty four hours.</p><p>She watched them slide out of Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Her thighs rubbed together involuntarily.</p><p><em> Oh my god. </em> Rio’s breathing was coming heavily now. <em> What am I doing? </em></p><p>She shook herself out of it in time to see Tommy’s eyes turn crimson.</p><p>“You <em> will </em> invite us to the investor meeting,” Agatha said simply, with such exacting control over her own voice that Rio felt like she was being stabbed with the most pleasant knife in the world. “And you’ll introduce us to your father. You’ll do this because you want to.”</p><p>“But I don’t,” he replied, frowning.</p><p>Rio gaped.</p><p>She had never, in six hundred years, seen a mortal reject Agatha’s Suggestion.</p><p>Agatha snarled. “Like hell you don’t.”</p><p>Her nails pressed furiously down into his hand, and it began to bleed. He inhaled sharply, snapping it away, and the color drained from his eyes—he’d completely escaped her spell.</p><p>“What the hell?” Agatha said, sounding as baffled as Rio felt. She looked towards Rio then, eyes angry and almost <em> scared</em>. “What is going on?”</p><p>Tommy was staring at Agatha’s fangs, his mouth open.</p><p>“What the hell <em> are </em>you?”</p><p>Rio could see the exact second that Agatha shifted plans.</p><p>The vampire’s fangs rescinded in seconds, her eyes blinking back to green. She gave Tommy a sympathetic, worried look, and put a gentle hand on his shoulder, squeezing it.</p><p>“Mr. Ashcroft, are you okay?” she asked. “You stopped responding for a moment there. We thought you might have been suffering from some kind of an episode.”</p><p>He flinched away. “An episode? What the hell are you talking about? I saw your—your teeth!” He was on his feet, his entire body rigid, alarmed, like a cat with its tail up. “No, no. You’re not <em> human </em>. That was not… human.”</p><p>Agatha laughed easily, rising out of her chair to comfort him. She reached for his elbow, but before her fingers could reach him, his hand came whipping out—</p><p>—and slapped her <em> hard </em> on the face. </p><p>The sound echoed through the room like a thunderclap.</p><p>The CEO slowly lowered his hand, shaking it. “I’m calling the fucking police.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheek was bright red. Her mouth wide open, speechless.</p><p>And Rio…</p><p>Was currently climbing over the table.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>“What the <em> fuck</em>,” was the last thing Tommy Ashcroft ever said.</p><p>Rio didn’t have a single thought in the time between his hand landing on Agatha’s cheek and the moment Rio realized she had just dismembered a man limb from limb. </p><p>Her body had acted as if possessed. Rio had killed a man quickly before, but she’d never blacked out while doing it. She was a methodical killer; she liked to enjoy the fear on their faces.</p><p>Agatha was a sadist when it came to conversation, but she paled in comparison to Rio when it came to ripping someone’s head off—she wanted them to hear their own bones breaking.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t her only friend just because Rio liked it that way.</p><p>There wasn’t a single vampire on Earth who wanted to get within five feet of her.</p><p>But this kill didn’t give her any pleasure. It had felt, in a word, <em> necessary. </em></p><p>Still straddling his chest, Rio lowered her mouth to his neck, and said something she didn’t mean to say. It just jumped out of her, quite like this murder had—</p><p>“Do. Not. Fucking.” She breathed. “<em>Touch her</em>.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio spit on Tommy’s cold face, then slowly peeled herself off the corpse. </p><p>She didn’t realize how deeply in the fugue state she really was until she tried to stand—and her knees buckled. Urgent hands wrapped around her middle, softly supporting her, helping her up.</p><p>“<em>Mmyoumok? </em>”</p><p>Rio heard some vague murmur from behind her, but she couldn’t decipher it. It sounded like gibberish, fuzzy and jumbled. God, her head pounded. The room wasn’t spinning, exactly—but it was something close. It was <em> pulsating </em>, like she was drunk out of her mind at a club.</p><p>She’d felt this way before, a few select times. Her first kill; then her second; and finally, her infamous (or just <em> famous </em>, if you asked Agatha) massacre of the Harkness clan.</p><p>She barely remembered a single kill out of the whole family affair. Vampires called the phenomenon a <em> Bloodlust Blackout </em> for that reason. It’s only supposed to occur when you’re starving—so desperate for blood that your animalistic instincts are forced to pilot you like a puppet. </p><p>But, there was one problem.</p><p>Rio was plenty fed. She’d had her normal three cups of blood for breakfast, and two more before bed last night—a completely reasonable amount, if maybe slightly on the lean side.</p><p>
<em> Oh. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Right. </em>
</p><p>It only occurred to her then that Agatha had, in fact, drank a <em> substantial </em> amount of her blood. An amount she had completely failed to substitute for.</p><p>She’d been so concerned by the friendship implications of it all that she’d really not addressed the literal <em> draining </em> act of it. </p><p>She was running on a half tank—maybe a fourth. </p><p>That had to be it, then, she decided. She’d just not realized how hungry she was. She’d done the human equivalent of skipping breakfast and forgetting lunch.  An honest mistake. That had to explain her outsized reaction.</p><p>Because why else…?</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio finally registered Agatha’s voice. And just like that, hearing the slight tremble in it, the shaken uncertainty, that tight feeling in Rio’s chest came throttling back, and she saw red again. She whipped around in Agatha’s arms—because apparently Agatha had <em> not let go of her </em>—and looked at the other vampire head on.</p><p>The first thing Rio’s eyes saw was Agatha’s cheek. The flesh was still pink, tender, raw. The sight of it made Rio want to empty her stomach; she felt such an insane nausea at the idea of Agatha getting hurt that she wished she could revive Tommy just to kill him again.</p><p>The second thing Rio’s eyes saw were Agatha’s fangs. They had descended to their full mast, dipping into her lower lip. As sharp as Rio had ever seen them.</p><p>The third thing Rio’s eyes saw was were <em> Agatha’s </em>—</p><p>Looking at her with such raw intensity that Rio’s knees almost buckled again.</p><p>“You killed him,” Agatha breathed out. It sounded ragged. “You killed Tommy.”</p><p>Rio made a small, dazed sound of agreement. She nodded for emphasis.</p><p>“Why on Earth did you do that?”</p><p>Rio’s muddled mind considered it. She could only produce one sensible answer.</p><p>“ ‘Hurt you,” Rio mumbled back. “Felt like the right thing to do.”</p><p>“Oh come on, he barely touched me,” Agatha said, pinching the bridge of her nose as if aggravated, even though her cheeks burned bright red. She seemed stuck in between two warring states of being—the rational side of her, and the <em> other </em> one. “And the <em> cameras</em>, Rio. And <em> the plan</em>. His fucking billionaire father. And what are we going to do with the body—”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter. Need to check on you.”</p><p>Rio drew closer, and Agatha immediately stilled, eyes widening like a deer.</p><p>“<em>Fuck,</em>” Agatha whispered. “Don’t come any closer.”</p><p>Rio frowned. Seeing the obvious question in her expression, Agatha clarified in a whisper.</p><p>“I don’t know if I can control myself.”</p><p>Rio blinked, bewildered, not really processing what Agatha was saying. She was still in that other world—that drunken, single-minded stupor. Her brain’s number one priority was making sure Agatha was alright. It could focus on nothing else but that.</p><p>So, ignoring whatever it was Agatha had murmured, Rio stepped closer, and cupped her hand under Agatha’s chin, tilting it upward.</p><p>Agatha gasped slightly, a quick breathless inhale, and Rio assumed it was from pain. “I’m sorry,” Rio breathed, but she kept going—tilting Agatha’s head to the side, then the other, checking her eyebrow, her forehead, the back of her neck.</p><p>“Rio, I’m serious.”</p><p>Again, Rio didn’t hear her. </p><p>She continued her inspection, slow and methodical. It was like having tunnel vision, she could only see the parts of Agatha she was touching—the nape of her neck, then her ear, her collarbone. It felt like the only way she could get back to a stable, sane place was to make sure every inch of her was okay—that no span of skin was blemished.</p><p>Finally, her gaze returned to Agatha’s cheek. Rio whimpered seeing the hot, painful blemish.</p><p><em> Need to fix this</em>.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha hissed, like the sound coming out of Rio just physically hurt her. “What are you doing—”</p><p>Rio leaned close to Agatha’s face, nudging her nose against her cheek, then slowly ran her tongue up the side of it. </p><p>“My saliva,” Rio explained, even though they both already knew how Rio’s powers worked. But Agatha had asked, so she’d answer. “It should heal it—”</p><p>Rio could feel Agatha’s chest rising and falling under her. </p><p>Breathily, Agatha gritted out, “You really don’t need to do that. It’ll heal just fine—”</p><p>“Mm. Need to,” Rio mumbled. “Have to make sure you’re okay.”</p><p>“Jesus, Rio, it was seriously only a slap—”</p><p>“Shouldn’t have happened. I should have killed him even before. Stupid.”</p><p>“Sweetheart.” Agatha grabbed Rio by the hair, and tore her backward, so their faces were dangling centimeters apart. Agatha said the next two words in a choked breath, “<em>I’m fine </em>.”</p><p>Agatha was practically panting, which didn’t <em> sound </em> fine on Rio’s ears.</p><p>Rio reached forward and tucked a stray brown hair behind Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“When he slapped you, I blacked out again. Like in the bathroom,” Rio whispered. “Still feeling… woozy.”</p><p>Concern mingled with something else behind Agatha’s bright red pupils.</p><p>“Have you not been drinking enough?”</p><p>Rio nodded her head no. “Don’t think it’s that.”</p><p>“Then what could…” Agatha’s eyes widened ever-slightly, her lips parting. “<em>Oh </em>.”</p><p>Her eyes drifted to Rio’s shoulder. </p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“I sucked you dry?”</p><p>Rio whimpered again, involuntarily.</p><p>“Please stop making that sound.”</p><p>“Can’t help it.”</p><p>“Yes you can.”</p><p>Rio became increasingly aware of just how close their lips were.</p><p>Agatha’s tongue darted out to wet them.</p><p>“You need blood,” Agatha said simply.</p><p>Rio swallowed. She was starting to get her wits about her again.  “Yeah, probably. But it’s okay, we’ll just clean this up, then I’ll stop by the blood bank…”</p><p>“<em>Rio </em>.”</p><p>This time it was Agatha whining.</p><p>“What?” Rio said bluntly back, colder than she meant it. She wasn’t angry at Agatha—but she was <em> overstimulated </em> . She couldn’t get a sense for what was actually <em> her </em>, and what was her vampire biology. Everything felt so… intermingled. </p><p>Heady and confusing.</p><p>“I think you should drink from me.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach lurched.</p><p>But before Rio could say anything—something like <em> That sounds like a terrible idea </em>—Agatha took a shallow breath in, and kept talking.</p><p>“Look. I really think you should, because we’re going to have to go kill the guys in the kitchen. And the waiter, too—he pissed himself, then fainted in the corner of the room. Spilled shrimp all over the place.” Agatha’s eyes drifted somewhere behind Rio, and grimaced. “We can’t leave any stragglers who might have known who Tommy was bringing to lunch. You know the drill. <em> Leave no witnesses </em>.”</p><p>It all sounded very rational coming out of Agatha’s mouth. So plain and simple and logical. Just two vampires making reasonable choices given an exceptional situation.</p><p>But again, Agatha’s body told a different story. Rio knew that Agatha would have put her fangs away by now if she could help it. Agatha didn’t like leaving herself exposed. And yet they were as long and sharp as they could be.</p><p>
<em> She’s not thinking clearly. </em>
</p><p>Still, Rio’s mouth watered.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Rio said, clearing her throat. “You want me to…” She made a gesture toward Agatha’s neck. “Even knowing what it’s been doing to me? You want to deal with that?”</p><p>Agatha made an annoyed flourish with her hands. “I’m a big girl. I can handle a little <em> thirst </em>, okay? Don’t make it into a thing. It doesn’t have to be a thing…” Agatha’s hands snaked around Rio’s neck, egging her on. “Just do it.”</p><p>“Agatha, I don’t think—”</p><p>“Do you think you can kill six more people on an empty stomach?”</p><p>Rio paused. Agatha was staring at her, furious. As if she’d projected all the emotions she was clearly ignoring into a neat little box of fury.</p><p>“Why can’t <em> you </em> kill them?” Rio retorted.</p><p>At that, Agatha groaned.</p><p>“Rio, for the love of god, we all know you’re the better murderer—”</p><p>“You do just fine yourself.”</p><p>“And what if I just want to watch?”</p><p>Rio’s stomach nearly strangled itself. Agatha was looking at her with a mix of that signature cockiness and something else—something new, and brazen.</p><p>But Rio still knew it was bullshit.</p><p>Agatha was hiding something. Rio wanted to know what.</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>“Rio, if you don’t bite me, I’ll bite you.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Is that a threat?”</p><p>“It’s a promise.”</p><p>They stared at each other for a moment, something silent passing between their eyes. </p><p>Then, in the distance, a police siren began to wail. Out of the corner of her eye, Rio saw a man peek out from behind the doors of the kitchen. Someone had spotted them.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha scowled. “Rio, we have to—”</p><p>But Rio’s fangs cut off the rest of her sentence.</p><p>And if Agatha’s bite had been reckless, then Rio’s was criminal. </p><p>Because she didn’t aim for a safe, polite place like the shoulder—or a more traditional graze of the collarbone, the lower neck—she planted her teeth like a wolf into the flesh just below Agatha’s ear. </p><p>Her nose nuzzled against Agatha’s neck, and Agatha—<em> fuck </em>—Agatha buried her hand in Rio’s hair, just pushing her in deeper.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha moaned, her head falling backwards. “Fuck, fuck, fuck. I completely see your point about—this.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio saw heaven.</p><p>Which, in all honesty, confused her. She’d drained plenty of bodies before, but she would have never considered the act <em> pleasurable </em>. Agatha always insisted there was a sort of eroticism to it, a bodily connection, a deeper meaning beyond the literal entrance of teeth into skin, but still Rio had never seen feeding as anything other than necessary—her previously human mind was predisposed to find the act inherently gross, her human evolutionary tendencies guiding her to avoid touching blood should it carry disease.</p><p>This was different. </p><p>Rio knew, feeling Agatha squirm underneath her—feeling Agatha’s hips subtly rock against Rio’s stomach, her hands a frenzy in Rio’s hair, trying to push her deeper, and deeper—she would never be the same. </p><p>She would need this everyday. </p><p>She would need this every second.</p><p><em> The real curse hadn’t been put on me, </em> Rio realized. When Agatha sank her fangs into Rio—Agatha had received the real punishment. Like sampling the most addicting drug in the world only to be told you have to go cold turkey.</p><p>Rio’s fangs were still deep in Agatha’s throat, and yet she was mourning something that wasn’t even over. She needed to feel this pleasure for as long as possible. She needed to engrave it in her brain.</p><p>Living without this would be utter <em> hell </em>.</p><p>“<em>Rio. </em> ” Agatha’s voice was distant. Rio was so entrenched, so thoroughly <em> affixed </em> , lapping up every bit of red she could get, nothing could reach her eardrums. She could be shot in the back with a bullet and she wouldn’t notice. “You—you need to— <em> fuck </em>—you need to stop, before…”</p><p>Rio moaned into Agatha’s neck, and grabbed the back of Agatha’s head to pull her closer.</p><p>“Need,” Rio groaned. “<em> Deeper </em>. Now.”</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha’s whine was more emphatic this time, but still, Rio couldn’t hear it. The pleasure rocketing through her was a drug stronger than anything on Earth.</p><p>“You taste—<em> so good. </em>”</p><p>Rio might have been crying. She certainly felt like crying. </p><p>That was how good it felt. Like being reborn.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hips stuttering against her.</p><p>“<em>Baby </em>. I—”</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>The pet name shocked her straight out of her reverie, like she’d been electrocuted.</p><p>She pulled frantically backwards, her fangs falling out of Agatha’s neck. She panted hard, her pupils blown. Agatha’s fangs were biting into her own lip so hard that it was bleeding.</p><p>
<em> Did she just call me…? </em>
</p><p>Rio breathed in, out. Tried to gather her thoughts.</p><p>
<em> She was just trying to get me off of her.  </em>
</p><p>Rio’s stomach sank.</p><p>
<em> Fuck, why did I let it go on that long? </em>
</p><p>
<em> I got carried away. </em>
</p><p>“I—” Rio stuttered. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to—I got lost in it—”</p><p>“Stop apologizing. Just…” Agatha panted, and her finger rose steadily in the air, pointing towards something beyond Rio’s back. “Deal with our little audience, please?”</p><p>Rio craned her head backward slowly, only to find the barrel of four silver guns staring back at her.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, feeling a foreign electricity course through her veins.</p><p>She wiped her mouth, and nodded.</p><p>“Don’t forget to watch.”</p>

<p>Rio had taken down five policemen, two waiters, ten members of kitchen staff, and one unlucky hostess named Barbara by the time Agatha was done dismantling the security cameras.</p><p>They’d done this so many times that they didn’t even have to talk about it. Which was good, because Rio was positive whatever would come out of her mouth next would be an incoherent jumble of desperate sounds.</p><p>She was <em> not </em> prepared to speak to Agatha after what she’d just experienced. And neither was Agatha, apparently—they entered a mutually agreeable pact of silence as they slung the bodies into chairs, and served a plate of Lobster Clam Inversion in front of each corpse.</p><p>They then took the elevator down, and pointedly stared at the floor the whole time. A small eternity passed by the time the metal doors groaned open.</p><p>“We should—” Agatha started.</p><p>“—Go back to work so it’s not suspicious?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a small, awkward smile.</p><p>“Good to know your brain’s still working.”</p><p>Rio laughed hollowly.</p><p>
<em> Not so sure about that. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“How was lunch?”</p><p>For the first time since she started at VioCroft, Rio was grateful to hear Billy’s voice.</p><p>She settled down in her creaky office chair and gave him a tired smile. It didn’t quite reach her eyes—but it wasn’t like she’d ever smiled at him anyway, so why would he know the difference?</p><p>“Meh,” she answered. “The food was terrible.”</p><p>Billy pushed out of his cubicle and yawned. “I bet. Tommy has the worst taste. He’s so obsessed with meat that’s stuffed in another meat. It’s disgusting.”</p><p>Rio had begun typing uselessly at her laptop, but that response made her fingers still.</p><p>She turned to him slowly, trying to remain as chill as humanly possible.</p><p>“You mean the CEO?”</p><p>He squinted at her in confusion. “Er, yeah? Is that not who you went to lunch with?”</p><p>“Why would I be going out to lunch with the CEO? Do I seem like an employee of importance?” Billy laughed at that, which Rio considered a success. “Me and Agath—Agnes went to the taco place down the street. Don Juan’s?”</p><p>“Really? Because I could have sworn I saw you two penciled into his calendar.”</p><p>Rio blinked. <em> Don’t panic. Do not panic. </em></p><p>
<em> Wait. </em>
</p><p>She shot him a genuinely bewildered look. </p><p>“You have access to the CEO’s calendar? Isn’t that like, private?”</p><p>“To most people, sure. But I had the unfortunate privilege of growing up in the same house as him, so,” Billy groaned. “I’ve been trying to find a time in his calendar for us to drive up and see Mom for a few days. But he’s always busy with something.”</p><p>Mom.</p><p>
<em> Mom. </em>
</p><p>They’re brothers.</p><p>
<em> Oh, for the love of fuck. </em>
</p><p>It took everything within Rio to not react.</p><p>Thankfully, Agatha had spent the last six hundred years testing her patience, and the last week and a half training her willpower.</p><p>“So.” Rio had to confirm it— “Your dad is like, Richard Ashcroft? The oil dude?”</p><p>Billy avoided her gaze. He picked up a chewed-on pencil from his desk and began toying with it, balancing it on his knuckles.</p><p>“The oil dude, indeed,” he repeated mockingly. “And he’s my step-dad. My real dad’s dead. Richard is just a rich shithead.”</p><p>“I… see.”</p><p>So, Billy did not seem fond of his step-father.</p><p><em> Or </em>his brother.</p><p>Maybe he and Rio had more in common than she once thought.</p><p>Of course, friendship seemed a little… off the table… now that she’d just killed his big brother. But hey, it was a brief and lovely hypothetical.</p><p>Rio leaned over into his cubicle, propping her elbow up on his desk. She flashed a mischievous smile at him—and her eyes glowed red.</p><p>“Hey, I have a fun idea. Why don’t you show me his calendar?”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“His fucking <em> brother </em>?”</p><p>“Nepotism, dude. It’s a sickness.”</p><p>The irony of Rio calling Agatha <em> dude </em> after she’d nearly sucked the life out of her five hours earlier was not lost on her. But that didn’t mean she was going to acknowledge it.</p><p>The 10 PM news was blaring from their tiny television. Rio could see the reflection of the screen dancing across Agatha’s face—a video of medics carrying bodies out on stretchers.</p><p>“<em>The </em><em>victim has yet to be identified, but the restaurant’s reservation records indicate that the John Doe might be Tommy Ashcroft, son of Richard Ashcroft and former CEO of VioCroft Labs.” </em></p><p>Agatha turned to her. They were on the couch, per usual, but this time, not touching. No footsie, no casual leg draped over casual leg. <em> Nothing. </em></p><p>Several stacks of food sat between them: two pizza boxes, hot wings, potato chips. Anything to help them observe the five foot rule that they’d silently created and were now mutually reinforcing.</p><p>“But your Suggestion worked on the little shrimp?” Agatha asked.</p><p>She sounded a mix between impressed and concerned. Rio felt the same way about it.</p><p>She shrugged. “His eyes were red the whole time. Anyway, turns out he actually had Tommy’s passwords saved and everything—a serious security hazard—so I wrote them down.” Rio dug into her pocket and produced her company phone, a shiny little green iPhone. “I logged into Tommy’s account on my phone and edited the calendar event to remove us from the invite. Now it just looks like he went there alone, if anyone thinks to check it.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows were halfway off her face by the time Rio was done talking. The other vampire huffed out a disbelieving laugh, then shook her head.</p><p>“What?” Rio mumbled, feeling self conscious.</p><p>Agatha leaned over their mountain of takeout and punched Rio lightly in the shoulder.</p><p>“Look at you, tech support,” she teased, poking out her tongue. “Maybe we forget this whole plan and go get you a job at the Apple Genius Bar.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, blushing.</p><p>“I don’t even know what that is,” she muttered, looking away.</p><p>“It’s a bunch of nerds sitting in a store that looks like a spaceship.” Agatha waved her hand dismissively. “I stole my last phone from the one down in Brooklyn. There is seriously nothing more fun than watching one of those dweebs pile a bunch of two-thousand-dollar devices into a Walmart shopping bag you handed him. He didn’t even twitch when the alarm started blazing.”</p><p>Rio grinned fondly at the idea of it. While she and Agatha did most of their risky business together—kind of like how women bring their giant dobermans with them when they go on midnight runs—sometimes Agatha insisted she needed to let her hair down and handle something herself.</p><p>Crimes of persuasion were the easiest for her in that respect; she could get people to fess up for things they didn’t do while Agatha walked out the back entrance, heels clicking.</p><p>The TV news switched cameras away from the paramedics, back to the mainstage.</p><p>“<em>Breaking news. After a careful autopsy, the body has been identified as VioCroft CEO Tommy Ashcroft. Richard Ashcroft will reportedly be landing in New York City tonight to prepare for his son’s funeral. The procession will take place just outside the city. His former wife, Wanda Maximoff, professor of Physics at SUNY Albany, has also made a statement that she will be arriving in the city tomorrow evening.” </em></p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Agatha nearly fell off the couch in excitement. She scrambled up to the TV screen, as if getting closer to the monitor would somehow reveal information they couldn’t see from three feet away. Rio nearly called her an old lady for it—but Agatha beat her to it, spinning around.</p><p>“Plan’s still on, baby.” Agatha grinned as wide as the sun. “We’re crashing a funeral.”</p><p>Rio groaned. <em> This woman has zero boundaries </em>. </p><p>“We can’t crash a fucking—” </p><p>Goosebumps ran across Rio’s arms as she processed the full sentence. <em> Plan’s still on, baby. </em>She knew Agatha was just throwing the pet name around like usual—she’d called Rio everything under the sun for comedic effect—but she still couldn’t expunge the memory of earlier today from her mind.</p><p>They’d been doing a pretty solid job so far of not discussing or acknowledging it whatsoever, but that single word took her back in an instant. She remembered how sweet Agatha’s blood had tasted, and squirmed slightly in her seat, face flushing.</p><p>“Crash a fucking funeral?” Agatha finished for her, not noticing the change in her face. She was too consumed by whatever brilliant idea she’d just thought up. “Oh, we so are.”</p><p>She turned the TV off, pushed the coffee table to the side, and squatted by Rio’s legs. She put her hands on either of Rio’s thighs, grinning up at her.</p><p>“We should go shopping,” Agatha said, giddy. She began to itch her fingers into the fabric of Rio’s pants as she talked. “I haven’t been to a good funeral in years. And you just know this one is going to have the best catering. Fucking rich people. God, you gotta love ‘em.”</p><p>Rio’s throat bobbed as Agatha’s nails scratched along her leg.</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>The other vampire ignored her, continuing to think out loud. “But how are we going to get in? Maybe you can fudge the calendar again—” She frowned. “No, we can’t have their dead son inviting us to his own funeral. Bad optics. Eh, I’m sure we can just Suggest the security detail. Or worst case, if someone tries to throw us out, we’ll just yell at Billy to let us in. That kid has pretty much sworn fealty to you anyway.” Agatha paused, laughed. “You think he has a crush?”</p><p>At that, Rio rolled her eyes. She clamped her hands down on Agatha’s so they would stop their infernal ministrations.</p><p>“He’s definitely gay. I’m actually a little concerned for you that you didn’t clock that.”</p><p>“<em>Ohhh </em>. That explains why his hair is so shiny.”</p><p>A laugh exploded out of Rio. “Agatha, what the <em> fuck </em> does that have to do with anything?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, then slowly rose to her feet again. “Gay people have shiny hair.”</p><p>The vampire lazily picked up the takeout containers from the couch and strolled over to the window. She opened the hatch with a click, rolled them so they were partially open, then threw the cardboard boxes down from their twenty-story perch.</p><p>Rio heard the sound of someone—or multiple someones—screaming expletives from the street below.</p><p>“Agatha, Jesus Christ. <em> Littering </em>.”</p><p>“Meh.”</p><p>Before Rio could launch into a speech about the degradation of the environment, Agatha had already circled back to the couch. And <em> oh </em> —now Rio understood. She’d cleared the dam between them; the green-eyed vampire kneeled into the fabric, propped her elbow against the cushion, and just <em> stared </em> at Rio from a few inches away, biting down on her lip.</p><p>Rio felt like God’s strongest soldier.</p><p>“What?” she asked shortly. “Do I have something on my face?”</p><p>“I think we should talk about it.”</p><p>Now there was the greatest surprise of the century.</p><p>“Talk about what?” Rio said, voice trembling. As soon as the words left her mouth, she became very unimpressed by her own evasiveness. Agatha Harkness of all people was recommending they stop avoiding a subject, and Rio was the one making it difficult?</p><p>“I think you know.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand dropped to Rio’s palm. Her nails scratched softly against it. Rio felt it like electricity—she wiggled her toes just to keep from screaming.</p><p>Rio ventured a brave guess. “Does it have something to do with the biting?”</p><p>“<em> Bingo </em> ,” Agatha said, her mouth forming a ridiculous <em> o </em>. “I want to suggest a way forward.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh. <em> A way forward </em>. Did Agatha think they were in some sort of business meeting? Were they going to talk about improving their bite KPIs?</p><p>No, Agatha knew what she was doing. Or, at least, there was some sort of method to the linguistic madness. She was clearly trying to intellectualize the whole thing—her calmness a box she could use to stuff all her uncomfortable feelings into. </p><p>At least, Rio had to hope so. The alternative was that Agatha felt a pathetic little fraction of the fraught disaster that had become Rio’s mind. It wasn’t impossible, Rio supposed. Agatha had been born a vampire after all, she’d probably done this kind of thing all the time back in London. Swapped blood with half of the Harkness clan and then some.</p><p>The more Rio thought about it, the more deflated she became.</p><p>This was just another instance of Rio’s humanity coming back to bite her.</p><p>“Hey. You. Loser.” Agatha lifted Rio’s chin up, and Rio’s eyes widened. Despite her tone, the vampire was looking at her with an aching softness—all that business-like quality vanishing. “Don’t get all Sad Rio on me. I haven’t even said anything yet.”</p><p>Rio scoffed, offended, but she still didn’t dare move her head. </p><p>“What is that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“Get all withdrawn and depressed about something completely hypothetical.”</p><p>“I wasn’t doing that.” She was totally doing that.</p><p>Agatha huffed, taking back her hand, to Rio’s great disappointment. “I’m just trying to be an <em> adult </em> about this because, well—” She waved her hands around nonsensically. “I am technically the older one, vampire-wise. And I started this whole mess. Pressed the big old red do-not-press-this button on your vampire mating instincts or <em> whatever </em>. So I’ve been thinking about how to best rewire those instincts. Like, a hard reset. And I think…”</p><p>Agatha dragged her hand through her hair, then looked at Rio with a displeased expression.</p><p>“I think you need to go bite someone else. Like, a mortal, obviously. I’d say another vampire, but we all know you’re not going to find a willing one alive who won’t piss themselves at the sight of you. And mortals are a dime a dozen, so…”</p><p>Wait, what? Rio’s entire body went cold. She felt like she’d just been stung by wasps—sudden and painful and then <em> gone </em>, leaving her feeling empty. Like a husk.</p><p>Which didn’t make any sense. Because Agatha was probably right. If she wanted to get out of this state she was in, draining some mortal <em> might </em> do the trick. She doubted it, given that she’d never had this reaction to mortal blood before, but whatever Agatha did to her might have changed her biology completely. It was a complete unknown to Rio.</p><p><em> And yet </em>.</p><p>“Yeah. No thanks,” she muttered, pulling her knees up to her chest.</p><p>Agatha frowned, as if personally offended.</p><p>“Why not? Do you seriously want to continue suffering like this?”</p><p><em> Suffering </em>. And god, that stung too. Is that really how Agatha saw this? As suffering?</p><p>No, Rio was wrong to cast Agatha in that kind of light. She was right. This <em> was </em> suffering. Every moment that her teeth weren’t in Agatha’s neck felt like wasted time now. Like staring into space. This wasn’t productive, it wasn’t useful—it was just an impediment to a great partnership that had worked just fine—no, worked <em> fabulously </em>—for six hundred years.</p><p>“Fuck. Okay.” She sighed. “I’ll try it.”</p><p>Agatha brightened, but it seemed a false sort of brightness. Her smile didn’t reach her eyes.</p><p>“Good,” she said.</p><p>“And you— are you going to find a human, too?”</p><p>Rio really hoped the answer was no. But she knew it would be a yes.</p><p>For some strange reason, Agatha blushed. She looked away, toward the fridge.</p><p>“Nah, I’m good,” she said. “I don’t really feel like it.”</p><p><em> Wait, what? </em> Rio laughed. “Seriously? You <em> always </em> feel like it.”</p><p>“Not right now, okay?” Agatha growled. “Jesus. Back off.”</p><p>The anger was a surprise to both of them—and Agatha seemed to immediately regret it, because she frowned softly, then leaned forward, taking Rio into her arms.</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>“It’s okay.”</p><p>They just sat there, wrapped up into each other, for several silent moments. But through it all, Rio’s mind raced.</p><p>She knew Agatha was right. She knew they should put a stop to this before they did something really, truly stupid. And yet she had zero control over her own words as they left her mouth in a quiet, urgent whisper.</p><p>
<em> “Can we do it one more time?” </em>

<p>Agatha didn’t respond immediately. At least not verbally. Physically, Rio felt the other woman’s body tense. Her muscles contract. Her pulse quicken in her neck.</p><p>“Rio—”</p><p>“It’s stupid. Fuck. I know. You just—” Was she truly saying this? Yep, apparently she was. “You taste… really good. Like, exceptionally fucking good. Sue me for wanting to eat at the fine dining restaurant one more time before I go back to 7-Eleven blood bags.”</p><p>Agatha laughed against her chest, her hot breath falling on Rio’s neck. To Rio’s surprise, Agatha didn’t pull away—instead, she tightened her grip around her, locking her in a chokehold of a hug. The other vampire lowered her nose to Rio’s neck.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha said, and it sounded shy. </p><p><em> Shy</em>. Oh, Rio was so fucked. Agatha Harkness and <em> shy </em> did not go together in the same sentence, and yet, here she was. Rio had been expecting a reply like “ <em> Of course I taste good. I’m me.” </em> or, more likely “<em>You freak. </em>” That would all be fine, understandable, even.</p><p>She had no idea what to do with “Yeah?”</p><p>“<em>Yeah</em>,” Rio all but moaned in return. Because if Agatha was going to let her talk like this, if she wasn’t going to shake her and tell her to stop, she had no choice but to keep going. “I mean, I’ve never really minded the taste of blood. It’s fine, I guess. Like eating your vegetables. But <em> your </em> blood? Jesus, Agatha, it’s like—candy would be selling it short. I don’t know. Cocaine?”</p><p>Agatha snorted, and the sound delighted Rio so much she pressed a kiss to the top of Agatha’s head, in her hair. Just chaste, innocent. She couldn’t help it. She loved this woman so much.</p><p>“You’re not too bad yourself,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. The memory of Agatha’s fangs sinking into her rocked through her whole body, and settled low in her stomach. <em> Fuck </em>. </p><p>She tried to play it off. “Jeez. <em> Not too bad </em>. What do I taste like, animal crackers?”</p><p>Agatha snickered into her shoulder. “A little better than that.”</p><p>“Orange juice?”</p><p>“God, no. Less citrus-y.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrowed. “Cedar wood?”</p><p>Agatha laughed properly into her. Rio giggled back.</p><p>Things went silent for a bit. Then she felt Agatha’s mouth.</p><p><em> Not </em> her fangs, going by the fact that Rio wasn’t about to pass out.</p><p>But it was something far more intense, somehow—</p><p>Agatha’s mouth pressed softly to her neck. Breathed against it, a low exhale.</p><p>“<em>God,”</em> Agatha growled. “I can practically taste you through your skin.”</p><p>Rio had to kill the whine that threatened to crawl up her throat.</p><p>She knew if she made a sound like that, Agatha would stop—and she couldn’t have Agatha stop—</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened slightly, and her tongue glided along Rio’s neck. <em> Oh, fuck my life</em>. Rio couldn’t stop the sound she made that time—a feathered groan.</p><p>Agatha’s tongue rescinded, and her lips pulled back, and Rio was about to curse the day she was born, but then Agatha didn’t leave the embrace. She just hovered there a moment, by Rio’s neck, before pressing down again.</p><p>And <em> again </em>—she didn’t bite Rio. She just pressed a kiss to her neck.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whined. “Stop teasing me.”</p><p>The other vampire smiled against her skin.</p><p>“M’not teasing you,” she mumbled, and somehow, it sounded honest. “I just wanted to…”</p><p>Agatha didn’t finish her sentence. Which left Rio to finish it in her head.</p><p>
<em> Kiss me? She just wanted to kiss me? </em>
</p><p>No, not her—kiss her throat. Which was still her, sure, but different than her <em> mouth </em>.</p><p>But also, in a way, it wasn’t.</p><p>Biting was one thing. It was biology. It was out of their control.</p><p>Kissing her? Teasing her?</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Shh.”</p><p>Agatha placed another kiss to her throat, then another. They were gentle, almost reverent. But then, a moment later, they weren’t—her tongue poking out again, sliding.</p><p>“You’re such an asshole for even suggesting this,” Agatha groaned.</p><p>“I didn’t suggest <em> this,</em>” Rio said breathily, her head hanging back.</p><p><em> I wanted to taste you, </em> she thought, but didn’t vocalize. <em> But I’m also not complaining. </em></p><p>“Yes, you did,” Agatha muttered. <em> This complete gaslighter</em>. “And I’m trying very hard to resist the temptation. Because I am the <em> mature one.</em>” She kissed Rio’s neck again, and Rio heard a low growl in Agatha’s throat. It made her stomach clench. “And you’re just a brat who can’t stop daydreaming about my fucking fangs inside of you.”</p><p>Okay—</p><p>What the <em> fuck. </em></p><p>Rio couldn’t stop the whine that came out of her this time. They were just words, but the way Agatha said them—she wasn’t joking. This wasn’t one of her bits. Rio didn’t need to see Agatha’s face to know her eyes were as crimson as they could be.</p><p>She could feel Agatha’s fangs faintly poke at her neck; Rio bet she didn’t even mean to drop them. Apparently the image Agatha had just painted in words had surprised—and <em> turned on</em>—both of them equally.</p><p>Rio rubbed her thighs together, unable to stop herself.</p><p>She needed this to go somewhere fast. Drinking from each other, that she could do.</p><p>But this—whatever <em> this </em> was—was entirely too much. A different, scarier beast.</p><p>“Agatha, <em> please </em>.”</p><p>But Agatha’s fangs didn’t descend into her. A different part of Agatha moved entirely. She lowered Rio roughly down onto the couch, then pushed her legs open with her knee, slotting her leg in between Rio’s thighs. She did it so smoothly that it didn’t even seem like a conscious choice. All Rio knew was that suddenly Agatha’s leg was pressed up against her core, and—</p><p>Agatha pulled back from her neck, so she was lording above Rio, her hair falling around her shoulders, encasing them in their own little world.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha breathed. She looked caught somewhere in between completely fucking wrecked and—concerned? Rio did not like that she looked concerned.</p><p>Rio frowned. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Just fine,” Agatha cut her off. Her eyes were blazing a red Rio had never seen before. “Just needed to look at you. Sorry—I—didn’t mean to tease. Or cross your boundaries. You didn’t even want me to bite you. That wasn't what you were asking for. You wanted to bite <em> me… </em>”</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened, then closed. She was <em> so </em> confused. Agatha was lying on top of her, her leg pressed suspiciously—no— <em> damningly </em> close to Rio’s center, and babbling about how she’d read the situation wrong? Rio had to address this, and quickly.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio cut her off. “You have my <em> full </em> permission.” <em> To do anything you want. </em></p><p>A moment passed, then a small smirk inched its way up Agatha’s face. </p><p>And that’s when Rio caught on to what this was.</p><p>
<em> This fucking asshole.</em>
</p><p>“Your full permission to do what?” Agatha asked, clicking her tongue.</p><p>She wanted Rio to beg for it.</p><p>“Oh, fuck you, you sadist.”</p><p>“Come on. Use your words. You want me to…”</p><p>Agatha was grinning like a wolf. Rio’s head was swimming.</p><p>“I want you to—<em> nothing</em>,” she muttered, unwilling to play these games.</p><p>“Hmm. Too bad. Maybe this will help.”</p><p>And then Agatha did something insane.</p><p>She lifted her own hand, bit into her thumb hard enough to draw blood, then lowered it to Rio’s mouth. Rio had half a mind to scream, run into her room, and shut the door, but instead, she just sat there, completely stunned, as Agatha pushed her thumb into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>Agatha shrugged innocently. “Appetizer?”</p><p>Rio told herself she wouldn’t drink it. She told herself, <em> This is humiliating, ridiculous, stupid, and also a Very Bad idea </em>, and maybe one last other thing. A thing she’ll never remember because her tongue was already wrapping around Agatha’s finger and drinking every last speck of red that she could get from the shallow wound.</p><p>She groaned, seeing white, and arching her hips up.</p><p>“That’s what I thought.”</p><p>“You asshole,” Rio muttered, grabbing Agatha’s wrist and pulling her finger out of her mouth. She felt her own fangs graze across it, and she moaned again.</p><p>“You love it.”</p><p><em> I do, </em>Rio recognized fuzzily, somewhere in the back of her brain, but it was completely clouded by the absolute <em> want </em>that was pulsing through every cell in her body.</p><p>Agatha laughed, and then smiled down at Rio. It wasn’t a mocking smile—it was simple, genuine, disarming. As if she was enjoying this for reasons beyond her biology.</p><p>“What do you want, Rio?” she asked plainly, softly.</p><p>There really was only one answer.</p><p>Rio offered her neck, and bit down on her lip.</p><p>“<em>Please.”</em></p><p>Agatha didn’t make her work for it this time.</p><p>The other vampire groaned obscenely the moment her fangs touched Rio’s flesh. They pushed down, in a new spot, and Rio immediately felt the sensation like a tidal wave.</p><p>Her hips bucked up involuntarily, and this time, for the first time—they had something to grind against. Rio moaned, the friction feeling impossibly good against her center.</p><p>“Fuck— I’m sorry—” Rio mumbled, trying to stop herself from doing it again.</p><p>She knew Agatha liked drinking from her, but this? This was introducing a completely new dimension to it. A very specific, explicit direction. It wasn’t her fault that biting lit up the erotic areas of her brain, but that didn’t mean she could just subject Agatha to it.</p><p>Agatha’s fangs went in deeper—Rio could feel them hit a nerve, and it felt like <em> nirvana </em>. It took everything inside Rio to keep herself pinned to the sofa, keep herself still and just enjoy the feeling of it, not react—not move—</p><p>But then Agatha moaned, and rocked her hips into her.</p><p>“Oh god,” Rio mumbled uselessly, feeling how hot Agatha was against her leg.</p><p>Still—Rio didn’t dare move an inch. Even if this <em> was </em> doing something to Agatha, it didn’t mean the other vampire wanted it to become, well, in Agatha’s words, <em> a thing </em> . It didn’t mean she wanted Rio to respond. So Rio could—<em>would</em>—restrain herself.</p><p>She’d just let Agatha drink, and they’d both get it out of their systems, and they’d move on from this, and sure, Rio might have a dream or two or eight about in the next few weeks, but she’d recover eventually.</p><p>Hopefully.</p><p>She closed her eyes, and focused on the overwhelmingly pleasant lightheadedness she got as Agatha’s tongue licked across the wound. </p><p>“Need,” Agatha panted. “<em>More </em>.”</p><p>Rio nodded without even thinking of it, exposing more of her neck. Despite how much she was enjoying it, she wasn’t sure how much more of this she could physically take—vampires had a lot of blood, much more than humans—but Agatha was <em> greedy</em>. And they didn’t want to cross that invisible line. No, that would be bad, very bad—</p><p>“No,” Agatha moaned. “Not that. Need more here, I—”</p><p>Agatha’s hips shuddered down again on her leg, and Rio slowly understood. </p><p>
<em> Oh. </em>
</p><p>A smarter, wiser, <em> saner </em> version of herself would have understood that Agatha was <em> in a state </em>, and thus didn’t really know what she wanted, but Rio wasn’t any of those things at the moment. </p><p>So, with a whimper, she pushed her own leg up, into Agatha’s center, and the other woman immediately rewarded the behavior—groaning into her neck and biting <em> deeper </em>, her hips sliding against Rio’s again and again.</p><p>“Can’t— can’t stop,” Agatha whimpered. “You taste—”</p><p>Even through the soft material of her pants, Rio could feel her. Hot, warm, <em> wet </em>.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio moaned.</p><p>“Baby, I–” And there it was again; that nickname. It somehow did more to her than even Agatha’s fangs in that moment. “I’m— I can’t fucking control myself—”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio whispered into her hair, reaching around Agatha’s waist to push her harder down into her—giving her <em> more </em> . “It’s okay. It’s okay.” <em> Please don’t stop. Please. </em></p><p>Rio’s vision was going fuzzy. Her hearing became less and less sharp, like she was zipping through a tunnel. All she could feel was Agatha rutting desperately against her thigh; Agatha’s fangs pulsing in her neck; the little whimpers leaving Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Agatha; Agatha; <em> Agatha.</em></p><p>But then, like a carriage slowing to a halt, Agatha began to slow down. She took a deep breath in, and her fangs exited Rio’s neck. </p><p>When Rio saw her face again, hovering and panting a few centimeters away, it was a version of Agatha she’d only ever seen once before—briefly, when they first met, when Agatha opened the massive metal door to Harkness House, and saw Rio, a stranger dressed in black, a dagger tucked into her dress.</p><p>She had assumed Rio was a guest of Evanora’s. Rio hadn’t corrected her, it would have blown her cover. So she let Agatha believe that was who she was, until later that night.</p><p>And Agatha had looked scared.</p><p>Agatha had never looked scared since then. Not around anyone. Not around <em> Rio. </em></p><p>Rio’s entire body froze. The worst case scenario spinned like a dreidel in her mind. Agatha had got lost in it and done something she regretted—Rio had crossed a boundary, forced Agatha into a position she didn’t want to be in—Agatha was disgusted by her now, she’d never look at her the same, they wouldn’t speak for centuries—Agatha thought she was a monster.</p><p>Agatha’s hand wrapped tenderly around Rio’s face.</p><p>“I could hear your heartbeat slowing down,” Agatha said, and she sounded terrified. “You’ve lost too much blood. Fuck—what was I thinking? Quick, just, take mine—”</p><p>Wait. </p><p>
<em> She was scared… for me? </em>
</p><p>Rio’s heart hammered in her chest.</p><p>Agatha had been so worried about her that she’d pulled herself out of—<em> that</em>—in a split second? Rio had experienced what it felt like to bite now—it was not something you could easily tear yourself away from. It was like a magnet binding to a refrigerator door.</p><p>Rio barely had a second to think before Agatha was lowering herself down to her mouth. And it was only when Agatha’s shoulder—bare and pretty and pale as the moon—was being presented to her on a silver platter did she realize just how hungry she was.</p><p>She was hungry in a way she hadn’t felt in a long time—hungry to the point where her vision was fading around the edges. Greying out. She knew that if she drank now, it would be a Blackout for sure.</p><p>“No,” Rio said weakly. <em> Very </em> weakly, because all she wanted to do was drink from Agatha—press herself against Agatha’s leg and let <em> go. </em> “I don’t think I’ll be able to stop if I do it right now. I’m too hungry.”</p><p>“I don’t care.”</p><p>Rio was scared of how certain Agatha sounded. As if she truly wouldn’t mind if Rio drank her to death. </p><p>“Okay. But <em> I </em> do,” Rio laughed weakly. “It’s ok. Can you just—” She groaned, her head had begun to hammer. She was so thirsty. “Can you grab me a few of the blood bags?”</p><p>Reluctantly, Agatha pulled back. <em> Reluctantly. </em> As if she’d really <em> wanted </em> Rio to drink her dry. <em> What the fuck is wrong with her? </em> Rio paused, then corrected herself. <em> What the fuck is wrong with both of us? </em>She was feeling insane. Rightfully so, actually. </p><p>Agatha had nearly—</p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p>Agatha had nearly…</p><p>Rio’s mind replayed the last five minutes, not completely believing that they were real.</p><p>Had they been about to have sex?</p><p>
<em> You *were* having sex. </em>
</p><p>
<em> No we weren’t. It was just a reaction to the blood. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Yes, just like sex is a reaction to being horny. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Shut the fuck up. </em>
</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>Agatha had poured five bags of blood into a giant Stanley cup. The sight of it made Rio snort. It was a Spongebob Stanley cup—decorated with about six hundred different Patrick Stars. Rio had gotten it as a gag gift for Agatha’s last birthday—(they had so many birthdays between them, every sixth one they celebrated purely as a joke)—and Agatha had thought it was so ugly she threatened to use it as a murder weapon. But naturally, it grew on her.</p><p>She pushed it into Rio’s chest gently, and Rio gave her a thankful smile in return. She drank the whole entire thing, a testament to just how much blood she’d lost. </p><p>Agatha watched her brazenly the entire time, staring with a singular focus that Rio had never seen her give almost <em> anything</em>.</p><p>A warmth, a fondness, a complete and utter devotion.</p><p>It made Rio’s heart stutter again, in an entirely new way than before.</p><p>And—oh.</p><p>Oh god.</p><p>This might be more trouble than Rio thought.</p>

<p>The next morning was more normal than it had any right to be.</p><p>They woke hazily at four in the morning—their circadian rhythms were on life support at this point—and Agatha made it to the kitchen before Rio did.</p><p>A very rare thing, as usually Agatha took an entire hour in the shower every morning. As she put it, she was “never truly ready to face the day until she’d listened to the entirety of Beyonce’s Lemonade.”</p><p>But Rio heard none of Agatha’s pitchy vocals drifting out of the bathroom that morning. Instead she heard the burbling of the coffee pot, the hiss of the burners.</p><p>Even through the dampening curtains they’d installed, Rio still felt the daylight like a sunburn as she zombie-walked towards the kitchen table. Everything felt so still—so quiet.</p><p>The exact opposite of Rio’s mind.</p><p>She couldn’t stop thinking about last night. She was being haunted by it. Over and over over, like a daydream and a nightmare combined in one, her brain sent her flickering images of Agatha—Agatha kissing her neck, Agatha dipping her fingers through Rio’s lips, Agatha groaning against Rio’s thigh—but most of all, she couldn’t stop fixating one image.</p><p>Agatha, afraid.</p><p>Afraid not <em> of </em> Rio, not of what they were doing—but afraid of <em> losing her</em>.</p><p>It shouldn’t have felt so unnerving. It’s not like it was a surprise, was it? </p><p>She knew Agatha cared about her. </p><p>Agatha would always take care of her when she was sick, would cover her in blankets, press her hand to Rio’s forehead and frown, cook her blood and beef stew until the pink returned to her cheeks;</p><p> When Rio would wake up crying in the night, memories floating up of the first time she was ever bitten, Agatha would hold her;</p><p>Hell, Agatha had killed for her more times than she could count. </p><p>Agatha was always just <em> there,</em> a stupid, ridiculous, overconfident constant in Rio’s life.</p><p>But Rio supposed, in the back of her mind, she had always expected that someday, Agatha would leave. After all, Agatha was a free spirit. A wanderer. She looked out for herself, and Rio didn’t blame her for that. </p><p>Her family—may they rest in eternal damnation—had never shown her any other option.</p><p>And in the beginning, Agatha did leave, sometimes. They’d go a few years without seeing each other—Agatha busy raining terror down in Romania, Rio taking an extended hibernation in the ice pockets of Norway and Finland. </p><p>They’d exchange letters; Agatha would send stupid little postcards—<em> Sending my love from Bucharest prison!</em>—and Rio would smile too fondly at them, tuck them away into her drawer, and think to herself, <em> I hope I see her again</em>.</p><p>Because that’s always how Rio had felt. Like every day spent with Agatha was maybe her last chance, and she would enjoy it to the fullest.</p><p>She realized that maybe she never stopped feeling that way. </p><p>And she certainly hadn’t considered that Agatha could possibly feel the same.</p><p>But six hundred years was nothing, really, when it came to immortality. A blip in the timeline. Plenty of vampires had spent six hundred years together as mere happenstance, a convenient intersection of two ultimately diverging paths. </p><p>But could her and Agatha be more than that? </p><p>Did Rio <em> want </em> something more than that? </p><p>Did Rio want…</p><p>Eternity?</p><p>The mere appearance of the word in Rio’s mind made her stomach lurch, and all the nausea she’d felt last night came rearing back. She groaned, holding onto the back of the kitchen chair to balance herself. </p><p>Between the light in the room and the emptiness in her stomach, everything felt hazy and <em> bad </em>. She should probably sit down, before…</p><p>“Whoa, whoa.”</p><p>A hand snaked around her middle, holding her steady, and Rio’s eyes snapped up.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Agatha, hair tied in a chaotic messy bun, dressed in the cheesiest apron in her closet—<em> Don’t kiss the chef. She bites </em>—with almost no makeup on her bare, beautiful face.</p><p> “You’ve got to be more careful,” Agatha tutted, moving one of her hands from Rio’s hip to cup her chin, smoothing messy tendrils of hair back on her forehead. “If you’re going to be my personal bloodbag, you can’t go tearing a femur on your first day. I like to keep my things in pristine condition.”</p><p>Agatha laughed at her own joke, and Rio just blinked at her, incredulous. Because of <em> course </em> Agatha could take nothing seriously.</p><p>Rio was here debating spending her life with this woman, and she was calling her the equivalent of one her favorite Prada handbags.</p><p>And even worse than that, it still made Rio’s stomach do cartwheels.</p><p>She tried to seem as offended as she should have logically been. “Did you just call me one of your <em> things? </em>”</p><p>Agatha’s grin just widened. </p><p>“Don’t sound so offended. You’re in very good company. Have you seen my DVD collection?”</p><p>Unfortunately, Rio very much had. Agatha had forced her to lug it around to every new apartment they’d gotten since 1995.</p><p>With a groan, Rio tried to push the other vampire off of her, but Agatha didn’t let her; she instead took Rio’s hands and pinned them childishly behind her back.</p><p>“You’re insane,” Rio muttered at her.</p><p>Agatha laughed softly.</p><p>“You bring it out in me.”</p><p>Rio thought this was another of Agatha’s little quips, but Agatha’s expression said something different. </p><p>She didn’t have that mocking rudeness of her usual jokes—her lip was frowning slightly, her eyebrows creased. <em> You bring it out in me</em>. Rio was only left to wonder what other things she brought out in Agatha. Her blood certainly brought out a modest amount of lust—that one was getting hard to debate—but was there anything else?</p><p><em> God. </em>Rio felt like her mind had been split in two.</p><p>One side of her wanted nothing more than to just go back to normal. To focus on the practical reality of their life—finding a place to live and money to pay for it, for one. While the other side wanted to sit Agatha down, and…</p><p>And do what?</p><p>She forced her mind to play out the scenario.</p><p>
<em> “Yes, hi, Agatha, friend and roommate of six hundred years. I’ve been thinking. Are you free next Tuesday? To do what, you ask? Oh nothing too big. Just figure out how to properly execute the whole mating soul-bite-ritual thing, like, *for real*, and pair off for life? Bite each other deliriously until death do us part? How does that sound?” </em>
</p><p>It took everything inside Rio not to laugh.</p><p>She could be naive, but she wasn’t <em> that </em> naive.</p><p>Agatha staying by her side as friends was one thing, but going, like, <em> exclusive? </em> </p><p>Sexually exclusive?</p><p>There was no chance in hell. That woman saw everyone as potential food.</p><p>And then, of course, there was the other, much scarier thing.</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha tapped Rio on the cheek, a soft, concerned look on her face that made Rio want to crawl up into a ball. “Where’d you just go?”</p><p>Rio tried to contort every thought in her head into a digestible sentence.</p><p>She failed.</p><p>“A lot on my mind, I guess.”</p><p>Agatha fake-gasped. “You? Overthinking?”</p><p>“Oh, shut up, you wingbat.”</p><p>Agatha smiled brilliantly at the insult, her nose scrunching adorably. <em> Adorably. </em> When did she start thinking Agatha did things adorably? Oh god, had she <em> always</em>…?</p><p>Rio was starting to, frankly, panic.</p><p>Panicking because of the aforementioned “other, much scarier thing.”</p><p>She refused to put a name to it, but that didn’t stop her from <em> thinking </em> about it.</p><p>And the terrifying truth was, Rio had never been in—well—<em>it </em>.</p><p>And she had no idea what <em> it </em> was supposed to feel like.</p><p>Before now, she had assumed she wasn’t capable of <em> it. </em> She’d vocalized this idea to Agatha plenty of times, when the other vampire would ask why she’d never dated. She’d just shrugged and said she wasn’t interested. That she just wasn’t built for that sort of emotion. </p><p>Or maybe she was, once—but just not anymore. </p><p>There’s a certain sort of cold distance one develops towards other people when you’re born human, and then become a beast; when the life you know and the people inside of it slowly grow old and die, and you stay in place.</p><p>It’s like becoming an inanimate object, in a way. A rock, a stone. Life does not happen <em> to </em> you, but around you. </p><p>And in that way, Rio had always been envious of humans. The shortness of life creates an urgency around it. To find one’s purpose—one’s career—one’s, well…</p><p><em> It. </em> </p><p>Vampires, with their perpetually renewed lease on mortality, can afford to never consider the big questions at all. </p><p>That was the great irony of it. </p><p>The more life you’re given, the less motivated you are to live it.</p><p>But meeting Agatha had been like the Tin Man meeting Oz. Agatha was so <em> alive </em> in a way that made Rio realize she’d been dead for a very long time. Everything Rio had done up until she met Agatha was for the purpose of revenge—of enacting some kind of cosmic justice. </p><p>Agatha just did things for fun. For pleasure. </p><p>Rio felt like a fearful goldfish witnessing, for the first time, a vibrant, grinning shark.</p><p>That grinning shark looked at her now, and Rio realized, with growing fear, that perhaps the problem was not that Rio was incapable of <em> it, </em> but that she had been in <em> it </em> the entire time.</p><p>Agatha sighed, and squeezed Rio’s hand. She gave her a pitying look.</p><p>“Wingbat is a <em> terrible </em>insult. I mean, come on, do better,” she laughed before disappearing toward the kitchen, where something was burning on the stove. “Now sit down. I made breakfast for you. I know, me, cooking, unbelievable. A full British, eggs and black pudding and everything. Will probably never happen again, so you might as well cherish it now.”</p><p>Rio’s legs shook as she took a seat. She forced a smile onto her face.</p><p>“I will,” she said, and never meant anything more. “Cherish it.”</p>

<p>After they finally sat down for breakfast, things swiftly escalated—as they always did with Agatha—toward someone’s demise. </p><p>To avoid thinking further life-destroying thoughts, Rio ate dilligently at her pancakes (surprisingly good, despite being burnt in the flames of hell) and listened intently.</p><p>“...So, that’s why I think we should kill Wanda Maximoff.”</p><p>Rio nearly choked mid-bite. </p><p>“Wait, what?”</p><p>She apparently hadn’t been doing as good of a job at listening as she intended. Maybe the psychiatrist who tried to diagnose her with ADHD in the early nineties had a point—sooner or later she was going to zone out of a conversation that actually mattered.</p><p>She pretended like she had been following along. “The <em> Physics professor? </em>”</p><p>Agatha frowned, crossing her arms over her chest adorably, like a toddler who’d had his idea to go back in time to save the dinosaurs dismissed.</p><p>“You weren’t listening.” <em> Caught red-handed. </em></p><p>Rio batted her eyelashes. “Sure I was.”</p><p>“Yeah right. You’re really lucky you have that horribly endearing face. It’s a great disguise for your terrible interpersonal skills,” Agatha muttered.</p><p><em> Horribly Endearing? </em>Rio smiled despite herself. She was really losing her mind at anything now. She would argue Agatha’s latter point, but Agatha had already moved on.</p><p>“She’s not just a professor,” Agatha continued conspiratorially. Not that Agatha really ever said something without sounding conspiratorial. “That’s just what she <em> wants </em> you to think.”</p><p>“Why does she care what I think?”</p><p>Agatha glared at her, and Rio grinned at her annoyance. “Not you <em> specifically </em>. The royal You—you know what. Nevermind. What I’m getting at is that she’s also a vampire. A vampire masquerading as a professor.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shot up.</p><p>Now <em> that </em> was interesting.</p><p>And she was grateful for anything remotely interesting at the moment. Because it was something to think about that wasn’t <em> the other thing. </em></p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>“I know everything.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. </p><p>She had gotten a precious five minutes at the Being-Purposefully-Annoying wheel before Agatha had kicked her back into the passenger’s seat where she belonged.</p><p>“Uh huh. Get to the point, Agatha.”</p><p>“Great, as I was saying. I know everything—as in I know every vampire family that has ever lived. Courtesy of being raised by Evanora Harkness, most prolific vampire socialite of the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th centuries—thank god you put a stop to that—and I recognized Wanda’s face the moment I saw her on the television screen.”</p><p>A flash of last night appeared unbidden in Rio’s mind. She promptly swallowed it down, along with another of Agatha’s potatoes.</p><p> “Old friend?” she asked between bites.</p><p> Selfishly, she hoped not. Agatha’s friends tended to come with benefits.</p><p><em> Me excluded,</em> she was about to think, but upon reflection of recent events—Rio had officially become a tally in Agatha’s mountain of escapades.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how to feel about that.</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I haven’t slept with her, if that’s what you’re thinking.”</p><p>“Of course I wasn’t thinking that.” She was totally thinking that. “Not that I would care either way.” She would definitely have cared.</p><p>Luckily Agatha didn’t drill into her for that second comment. “The Maximoffs are new money. So I didn’t see much of them at Mother’s galas.”</p><p>“New money?”</p><p>“Newly turned. Wanda’s a first generation vampire. Like <em> you,</em>” Agatha added with a wink.</p><p>At that, Rio frowned. She didn’t like being likened to Wanda for some reason. Probably because Agatha wanted to kill her, but more likely because Rio felt pointlessly jealous.</p><p>She decided to focus on something else, balancing her chin on her hand and asking,“But wouldn’t that mean Billy’s a vampire, too?”</p><p>Rio imagined that nerdy little thing tearing someone’s throat out. Didn’t feel right.</p><p>Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“Maybe. Maybe not. Wanda could have had a mortal baby daddy. Then it just comes down to luck and genetics.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes bulged. “Wait, that’s possible? A human and a vampire—procreating?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, and reached over to fuss her hair affectionately.</p><p>“God,” Agatha said breathlessly. “I love that I have to teach you everything.”</p><p>The admission sounded so earnest, Rio nearly fell out of her chair. </p><p>She looked pointedly down at her plate and tried not to blush, at which she immediately failed horribly. Her heartbeat thudded in her neck.</p><p>
<em> Why did that do something to me? </em>
</p><p>“<em>Not everything</em>,” she muttered, digging petulantly into a hardboiled egg with her fingernail.</p><p>Only almost everything.</p><p>“I still don’t see why we have to kill her just because she’s a vampire,” Rio muttered just for the sake of being contrarian. She actually had no problem killing Wanda now that she had this one-sided and completely irrational hatred towards her. “How does that help our plan?”</p><p>And <em> oh</em>—for the love of—Agatha had been smiling at her with the softest expression while she hadn’t been looking. Which was definitely not helpful to Rio’s plan of avoiding over-thinking.</p><p>And it was especially not helpful when Agatha ignored her question and reached out her hand, wiping her thumb gently across Rio’s cheek, grazing her lips.</p><p>“Hold still.”</p><p>She hovered briefly at Rio’s upper lip, looking at it, then up at Rio’s eyes. Agatha’s eyebrows furrowed, and a shadow of <em> something </em> crossed her face, but the expression was so quick and miniscule that Rio wasn’t even sure it was real. Wouldn’t be her first time hallucinating. </p><p>“I’ve never met a messier eater,” Agatha laughed, then popped the egg-covered finger into her own mouth—which, what the fuck—and licked it clean. “Are you sure you were a human before this? And not like, someone’s very loyal dog?”</p><p>Rio scoffed and thought, <em> I was a human before this, and unwittingly became your very loyal dog sometime after</em>.</p><p>She did not say this. “Answer my question, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha made a noise of protest, but Rio’s glare eventually drew it out of her. “You should already know the answer to your own question. We have to kill Wanda because vampires are territorial.”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>She had no clue what Agatha was talking about. So, a typical conversation for them.</p><p>“Really?” Agatha laughed, gesturing toward Rio’s general cluelessness. “I’m having to explain this to the girl who tore Tommy Ashcroft’s throat out for the crime of looking at me?”</p><p>Rio stilled, heart clenching.</p><p>What the hell was she insinuating?</p><p>Rio felt the sudden compulsion to come up with an excuse.</p><p>“He did more than <em> look</em>.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>“Sorry. You’re right. Murder is a totally justified reaction to a little slap on the cheek.”</p><p>Rio scoffed in disbelief. “As if you’ve ever needed justification for murder.”</p><p>“Well, <em> you </em> sure didn’t. Hence my Wanda point.” Agatha gestured in frustration as if this was all incredibly obvious. “She was married to this prick Ashcroft for years. So either he’s already a thrall—unlikely, given the whole divorce—or he’s a human-shaped piggybank Wanda tossed aside after she got sick of him. But he’s still <em> hers, </em> discarded or not <em> . </em> Vampires don’t share toys.”</p><p>This was slowly making some sense to Rio, enough sense that she could have just nodded and let Agatha continue talking—if it wasn’t for the fact that the other vampire had very plainly insinuated that Rio saw Agatha as—well—</p><p>Rio tried to sound discreet, filling her mouth with half a pancake before whispering, “I would never do that to you. Throw you away like that.”</p><p>She wasn’t sure whose benefit she was saying it for—hers or Agatha’s. She just felt the need to let it sit in the air. Because regardless of how either of them felt, it was true, she realized.</p><p>Agatha could reject her in every way—she could drain all the blood from Rio’s body in one long drink—and Rio would forgive her. Rio could die and she’d haunt Agatha as a ghost, holding her hand wherever she went without her even knowing.</p><p>She didn’t care if it was a pitiful truth. Agatha had been abandoned by everyone in her life. Even if it killed her, Rio would never give Agatha an excuse to believe that her destiny was to be set aside. </p><p>Agatha set her fork down. It rattled against the kitchen table.</p><p>Rio looked up at the sound, and found Agatha’s eyes studying her with a quiet intensity.</p><p>“You have to stop saying things like that.”</p><p>Rio frowned and held her gaze with the same intensity.</p><p>“<em>Why</em>?” she whispered.</p><p>
<em> Because it scares you? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Because you wouldn’t do the same for me? </em>
</p><p>“Because…” Agatha frowned, and then she shut her eyes, and sighed, like she was reigning something in—preventing something forbidden from leaking out. “Nothing. Let’s just get back to Wanda.”</p><p>“I don’t want to get back to Wanda.” </p><p>
<em> I want you to make me feel less insane.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I want you to give me a sign. </em>
</p><p>She took in a sharp breath.</p><p>
<em> I want you to call me your baby again. </em>
</p><p>Rio flushed at her own desperation.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t give her an inch.</p><p>“Well, then.” Agatha rose suddenly, avoiding her gaze. “In that case, I’m going to get dressed. I <em> do </em> still have to go work. Turns out the human resources department is quite in-demand when the CEO is murdered. Let me know when you’re ready to get serious about escaping bankruptcy.”</p><p>And before Rio could reach out to her—like the moon reaching out to the singleminded tide—Agatha was gone, the bedroom door slamming shut.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">***</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio called in sick that day.</p><p>In the twenty-first century, some might call what she was doing  an attempt at a mental health day—except Rio was quite sure she was actively making her mental health worse, not better.</p><p>She was spread on the couch, watching Love Island, eating instant ramen with a “this might contain cancerous substances” warning label on the front, and seeing too much of herself reflected in a man named Chad.</p><p>Chad waltzed over to a blonde lying on a sun chair—and offered her a drink.</p><p>“Why are you avoiding me, gorgeous?”</p><p>The blonde glared at him from over her sunglasses. She took the drink he offered her, and poured it on the ground. </p><p>“Because I’m not interested in you, dimwit.”</p><p>Chad looked confused. “But I <em> want you </em>, babe. I swear, only you. No other hoes.”</p><p>“Well, wanting something and having it isn’t the same thing, is it?”</p><p>Rio frowned.</p><p>She shut off the television, and decided to do something she hadn’t done in two hundred years.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">***</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio was extremely—out of her mind, squirming in her socks, six candy bars in—stoned.</p><p>And their bank account was officially out of money.</p><p>Weed was fucking expensive these days.</p><p>“Don’t tell Agatha,” she mumbled.</p><p>She only realized a few minutes later, as she walked herself over to the fridge, looking for food that didn’t exist, that she had no idea who she was talking to. </p><p>The lock on the door clicked, and Rio jumped up like a cartoon character. <em> Shit, shit. </em> There were still seven joints sitting on the living room table—the vampire metabolism made getting high even <em> more </em> expensive—and the room smelled like a hotbox.</p><p>The door pushed open, and Agatha’s voice lifted from the hallway. “God, did a skunk escape into the apartment while I was at work?” </p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>And Agatha’s mouth fell open.</p><p>What Agatha saw: </p><p>Rio, in nothing but a sports bra, black boy shorts, red-rimmed pupils blown to infinity.</p><p>What Rio saw: <em> Oh-god-she-looks-so-good-in-that-pantsuit-fuck-fuck-fuck. </em></p><p>“Are you…” Agatha laughed incredulously, looking down at the still-smoking joint on the table, then to Rio. “High?”</p><p>“No,” Rio coughed. Then coughed some more, until it was just getting embarrassing. “Okay. Yes. Please don’t be mad at me.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. That incredulous look on her face only grew more severe. Rio started panicking.</p><p>But then, Agatha leaned down, picked up the smoldering joint, and brought it to her lips. </p><p>She slunk towards Rio as she sucked the smoke in, hovering right in front of her, only a few inches away, before blowing the smog to the side, creating a cloud between them.</p><p>“Mad at you?” Agatha laughed. Rio could see her perfectly white teeth glinting through the gray. She was grinning wide. “Sweetheart, I fucking <em> love </em> you for this. Best idea you’ve had since killing my mom.”</p><p><em> Sweetheart. </em>Rio’s mind short-circuited on pretty much every word in that sentence, and her circuitry only broke more when Agatha spread her hands on Rio’s hips, then licked her lips breathily, her pupils going nearly as large as Rio’s.</p><p>“You look hot,” she said, like it was nothing. Then she began to snake her hands behind Rio’s back, tracing the serpent tattoo that hugged her hips. “Whoever ends up with you tonight will be a very lucky woman.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “You don’t look too bad yours—” <em> Wait, what the fuck? </em> She blinked quickly, disoriented. “Whoever I—end up with tonight?”</p><p>Agatha’s brows screwed together in genuine confusion. “I mean, you clearly got the weed for us to pre-game, right? To go clubbing and find you some human to bite? To deal with our little..”</p><p>Agatha gestured between them.</p><p>“Issue.”</p><p><em> Their little issue. </em>Right—because this was all still a biological mishap for Agatha.</p><p>Rio was eternally glad for the THC clouding her perception right then, because she was pretty sure she would have had a breakdown otherwise.</p><p>“Totally,” Rio coughed. “That’s what I did.”</p><p>“Genius.” Agatha smacked her on the ass, then turned toward the couch and picked up another of the rolls with a sigh. She turned to Rio with a terrifying glint in her eye: “Come on, let’s finish these, then I’m going to dress you for the best night—I mean <em> bite— </em>of your life.”</p>

<p>Rio’s memory was shit on a good day, but if you asked her to tell you exactly what happened in the time between when they left the apartment and when Rio was suddenly sitting in Agatha’s lap on a too-small barstool, elbows balancing on the sticky bartop, Suggesting the bartender to give them drinks they definitely wouldn’t be paying for—she would probably say something along the lines of:</p><p>“Mmmnmmnoidea.”</p><p>All she knew was that she was here now, Agatha’s hands gripping tight around the corners of her black body con dress, her freshly painted red fingernails claw-marking Rio’s hips.</p><p>Agatha had dressed her and styled her, which Rio only remembered in flashes—“<em> just take the tightest dress in my closet and put it on” “we’re straightening your hair, I want it to look as silky as Jeff Bezos’s fucking pillowcase </em> ” <em> “oh god, you look too fucking excellent, I might have to put you in a turtleneck.” </em></p><p>“What can I get you ladies?”</p><p>A muscular bartender looked down at them through the haze of the dim club lights. Agatha perched her head on Rio’s shoulder, about to open her Marilyn Monroe-red mouth and probably try and order <em> way </em>too many drinks when Rio cut her off.</p><p>She placed her hand on the bartender’s and smiled with her teeth.</p><p>“She’ll have an Old Fashioned,” Rio said. “I’ll have a Tequila Sunrise.”</p><p>The bartender nodded.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed Rio’s middle, nuzzling into her back. “Ordering for me? No fair.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help the dumb, helpless smile on her face as she felt Agatha’s cheek against her dress.</p><p>“You forgot to order the most important thing. Bar snacks,” Agatha muttered like a petulant child, her hot breath falling on Rio’s spine. “I wanted mozzarella sticks.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “You’ve had enough food.”</p><p>“ ‘Have not. I’m starving. Barely even alive back here.”</p><p>To absolutely no one’s surprise—Agatha was insatiable when stoned.</p><p>(And all other times, just with a bit more decorum about it.)</p><p>“You already made us stop for McDonalds <em> twice </em> on the way over here,” Rio laughed, the memory only returning to her as the words left her mouth. The poor cashier probably got fired after filling their bags with fifty-plus unpaid chicken nuggets. “Not to mention how you dragged us into the movie theater just to get popcorn.” Agatha had gone behind the counter and begun filling the box herself. “I can only Suggest so many times before the trick stops working.”</p><p>It had become an undiscussed truth between them that Rio was the one who would be Suggesting now, ever since the Tommy incident. Rio was wise enough not to broach the topic.</p><p>“Nonsense. Your charm is limitless,” Agatha mumbled into her skin, her hands squeezing even harder around Rio’s middle. Agatha’s nose nudged by her neck, where she’d applied a heavy amount of perfume. “God, you smell good—even under that cloud of Celine.”</p><p>If Rio wasn’t intoxicated into the next planet, that comment alone would have gotten her drunk.</p><p>The man and his muscles returned. “Here you are, ladies.” The drinks sizzled in front of them, and Rio was already desperate to wash it down her throat. “Cash or credit?”</p><p>Rio grinned, and batted her heavily mascaraed eyelashes.</p><p>“I was thinking you could put it on our tab?”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Agatha’s hand was pulling her like the ocean tide toward a sea of sweaty, undulating bodies, and Rio—infamous hater of cramped spaces, body odor, and loud music—didn’t even mind.</p><p>She didn’t mind because so far, despite Agatha’s initial very passionate pitch about this night, the only person Agatha had looked at was… her.</p><p>Not at the leagues of pretty single girls in air-tight dresses, not at the gorgeous DJ with bright green hair extensions, not even at the bartender when Agatha had tried to make a last ditch effort for mozzarella sticks—even then, she’d kept her eyes pinned to Rio’s face, giggling drunkenly as she slid five dollars over to the man as if she could bribe him into making her food that wasn’t on the menu.</p><p>Rio chalked it up to the weed. Agatha was always extra needy while stoned. Last time they got high, Rio had gone to bed early and Agatha had broken into her room not a minute later.</p><p>The other vampire had wordlessly slithered into her bed, wrapped around Rio from behind, and whispered something in her ear that, two hundred years later, Rio could still only grin at—</p><p>“Bed is so cold without you,” Agatha had said. “You’re like my warm little lizard.”</p><p>“You’re calling me a reptile?”</p><p>“I’m calling you mine.”</p><p>Her eyes widened. Rio’s entire body trembled at the memory—<em>no</em>—had Agatha really said that?—Rio only ever remembered teasing her for the lizard comment.</p><p>She’d dozed off after that. Vaguely remembered Agatha whispering in her ear, but… <em> You’re just stoned. Creating memories. Wishful thinking. Just forget it, forget it— </em></p><p>They reached the middle of the dancefloor.</p><p>“Fuck. I love this song!” Agatha cheered, bouncing on her heels, her hands a flurry in the air. She accidentally elbowed the man behind her, then, immediately after, his friend, but when they tried to say something, Rio shot them a glare with red eyes—and they backed away slowly.</p><p>The bass pounded, strobe lights flared on—off—on; Rio saw flickers of Agatha’s face in the milliseconds between light and darkness. Agatha’s eyes fluttering closed, her smile wide and drunk, her fist pounding the air, her body sliding smoothly through the air. Von dutch by Charli XCX possessed the room, and possessed Agatha’s hands—tugging Rio close to her.</p><p>Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck and sloppily pulled her so close their foreheads were touching. Rio could see a hint of red in Agatha’s eyes—not fully blown, but levitating around the corners, threatening to spill in.</p><p>“Agatha, what are you—”</p><p>“Plenty of pretty girls here. Every genre you could want. Long hair, short hair, alternative, straight-laced. ” Agatha said, dropping her voice salaciously. Rio could see a hint of a fang pop out from under her upper lip. “See anyone you’re interested in?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid from her neck, down, down—</p><p>The music drilled against their eardrums, louder and louder.</p><p>
<em> It's okay to just admit that you're jealous of me </em>
</p><p>
<em> Yeah, I heard you talk about me, that's the word on the street / </em>
</p><p>“Haven’t really been looking,” Rio whispered back. Agatha’s breath landed on her lips.</p><p>“You should really start,” Agatha pinched Rio’s bra strap. “Unless you want to be stuck with me all night.”</p><p>
<em> You’re obsession’, just confess it, put your hands up / </em>
</p><p>
<em> It’s obvious I’m your number one / </em>
</p><p>
<em> It’s alright just admit that I’m the fantasy / </em>
</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched.</p><p>“Would that be so bad?”</p><p>The music built to a crescendo, then, for a second, it stilled—teetered on the edge. Everything took on a liminal feel, like being suspended in time. Every person but them ceased to exist. The strobe lights illuminated Agatha’s face as bright as the sun.</p><p>She looked like the center of everything.</p><p>“No, I suppose not,” Agatha whispered, cheeks a dark pink. More red filled her eyes. Her hands progressed down to Rio’s hips, pulling them so they were pressed flush to Agatha’s own. “I wouldn’t mind keeping you all to myself.”</p><p>And <em> oh</em>—Rio felt warmth pool right in her center.</p><p>“Agatha, I—”</p><p>Then, the beat dropped. And whatever unwise words nearly pushed out of Rio’s lips died somewhere in the ocean of sound.</p><p>The bass throbbing, Agatha slid around so she was facing the opposite direction, and pushed herself into Rio from behind, so her ass was pressed flush to Rio’s center. She grabbed Rio’s hands and slid them along her own hips, then began <em> grinding against her. </em></p><p>It took everything inside Rio to remain fucking chill.</p><p>“Why are you so stiff?” Agatha laughed meanly. “Come on, are you really so rusty you’ve forgotten how to move? I’ll never forget how you tore through those Austrian balls in the 1600s. And I don’t mean that metaphorically. Fuck, you did well back then. <em> Komm schon, Frau Vidal. </em><em>Zeig mir was diese Hüften können." </em></p><p><em> Come on, </em> Rio translated blearily in her head, <em> Show me what those hips can do. </em></p><p>Oh—fuck it.</p><p>She was way too faded to deal with any of this.</p><p>
<em> If she wants to play games, I’ll play them right back. </em>
</p><p>So as the song faded into the next one, the percussion drilling against their eardrums, Rio danced. She slid her hands over every exposed inch of Agatha—starting at her waist, then inching up towards her cleavage, where Agatha’s breath hitched—<em> serves you right—</em>before dipping back down her stomach towards her thighs, pinching at the soft skin near the end of her dress.</p><p>“God,” Agatha moaned. “You <em> tease.</em>”</p><p>But Rio kept going. She was completely lost in the moment, in the white smoke billowing from the stage, in the stench of vodka and lemon, in the feeling of Agatha brushing up against her center again and again and <em> again. </em>She didn’t even notice her fangs began to dip out of her mouth.</p><p>Agatha took her hand and thrust it behind herself, cupping Rio’s neck before threading her fingers in her hair. She pulled <em> hard </em> and Rio gasped. It <em> hurt, </em>but the possessiveness in it spurred her on even further, and she toyed with the fabric near the center of Agatha’s thighs. It was so <em> warm. </em></p><p>“<em>Fuck, </em>” Agatha whined, thrusting herself the slightest bit forward into Rio’s hand.</p><p>And it drove Rio <em> insane.</em></p><p>So insane that she didn’t notice the two men approaching them until they were literally two inches away. One of them was tall, muscular, like the bartender but with a buzzcut and horrible ripped jeans. The other was short and lanky, blonde with a mole above his lip.</p><p>“Hey ladies. Would you like to dance?”</p><p>Rio could have killed them both right there.</p><p>Agatha was the first to pull away, shuddering off of Rio in a way that felt like they had been embedded together. Rio immediately missed the sharp warmth of Agatha’s body, the damp, humid club feeling like a wet towel over her shivering body.</p><p>She reached out for Agatha’s hand—something to hold onto—but Agatha didn’t take it, not quite flinching away, but pretending not to notice Rio reach for it. Rio frowned.</p><p>“I’m good,” Agatha said, in that fake-charming voice she was so masterful at. “But my friend might actually be interested.”</p><p>Rio gaped at her. <em> In what fucking universe? </em></p><p>Agatha gave her an impassive look, but she arched an eyebrow that communicated the message—<em>use this one.</em></p><p>This was equivalent to Agatha handing her a blood bag.</p><p>
<em> She seriously thinks drinking fucking Mark Zuckerburg’s blood over here is going to cure me of wanting her? </em>
</p><p>It was almost so insane that Rio laughed in their faces.</p><p>“No thank you.” Rio gave them a not-very-polite smile.</p><p>The taller of the two stepped between her and Agatha.</p><p>“Aw, sweetheart, you sure? Just one dance?”</p><p>He wrapped his arms around Rio’s waist. </p><p>Usually this sort of crime would constitute Rio breaking his neck and maybe eating his mother and father, but she refrained, choosing instead to humor Agatha’s stupid idea for two seconds.</p><p>Rio was a lesbian regardless (going on one thousand years of not giving a fuck about men, and counting), so this wasn’t going to go anywhere except possibly into the alleyway behind the club where she’d drain his veins with a straw.</p><p>But, she thought, if entertaining this whole ordeal meant she could possibly catch a glimpse of jealousy from Agatha, that would be worth enduring a few moments of this caveman’s groping.</p><p>She was viewing the whole thing as field research.</p><p>“Sure, why not,” Rio said, lying through her teeth.</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows shot up in surprise, but she didn’t intervene. Rio wondered if she’d choose to dance with the scrawnier of the two—the smaller man certainly looked hopeful—but Agatha just laughed when he tried to get closer to her.</p><p>“Go get me another drink and then we can talk,” she said to him.</p><p>“I’m Vincent,” the man said into Rio’s ear. His breath smelled like alcohol.</p><p>“That’s great,” Rio muttered, her eyes still on Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha, who was watching them like a hawk. <em> Interesting.</em> But her face was completely impassive. Unreadable. The music switched to another dance-pop track, and the three of them danced in close proximity—Vincent holding onto her like a life jacket and he was lost in a storm. Agatha dancing to her own rhythm, eyes following every movement of Vincent’s fingers. </p><p>It continued like this for several minutes until the smaller man returned.</p><p>“Your drink?”</p><p>Agatha downed it in one gulp, then shoved it back at his chest.</p><p>“Another one,” she said, then smiled prettily. “<em> Please.</em>”</p><p>The poor boy probably got her four more drinks before he slunk away somewhere else in the crowd. The entire time, Rio barely registered Vincent’s hands on her—he was like a poorly painted backdrop to a much more enticing musical that sat in front of Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes had gotten much redder now, a silent <em> something </em> building behind them. </p><p>Rio so desperately wanted to peek inside of her mind and know what she was thinking. But Agatha didn’t so much as make a sound. </p><p>
<em> Fuck it. Fine. I’ll make her. </em>
</p><p>“Vincent,” Rio said, patting the man on the cheek. “We’re going outside.”</p><p>The man brightened like a light bulb, nodding quickly as Rio took him roughly by the hand and started leading him toward the back exit. She risked a glance back at Agatha and mouthed <em> be back in a minute </em>, before the door to the club slammed behind them, and the cold air rolling off the Manhattan coast blew over her shoulders.</p><p>She walked them past the groups of people smoking cigarettes and toward a wall that was mostly unoccupied, where they then stood silently, Rio continually checking behind her to see if Agatha would come bursting through the door. </p><p>But even after a whole minute, she didn’t.</p><p>Rio scowled.</p><p>“So…” Vincent wrapped his arm around her waist again. “Shall we?”</p><p>He aimed for her lips, and she made an audible noise of disgust, dodging the attempt.</p><p>“Jesus Christ. Not in your wildest dreams.”</p><p>He stepped back, stunned.</p><p>“The fuck? Okay, <em> bitch. </em>Suck my dick, then.”</p><p>Before Rio could react to <em> that</em>, a six-inch heel was being lodged in the man’s eye, and he was screaming bloody murder.</p><p>She followed the shoe to find a hand—fingernails painted red—then a wrist—a bracelet with fifteen diamonds and as many pearls—and finally a face, a gorgeous, <em> gorgeous </em> fucking face with the most grotesque expression Rio had ever seen on Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Murder became her, that was for sure.</p><p>“Shut the fuck up,” Agatha said coldly, as if they were only having a mild disagreement, and sliced across the man’s vocal chords. He grabbed around his neck as it gushed blood, before ultimately falling to the ground.</p><p>Agatha’s chest was heaving above him, her eyes red as blood moons. She quickly turned to Rio, cupping her jaw.</p><p>“Did he do anything to you?” she asked urgently.</p><p>“No, I’m— I’m fine.” As if any mortal could ever injure her. “Totally fine.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, nodding as if to digest the information.</p><p>She released Rio’s cheek, then bent down to where the man was lying in a red puddle, and—Rio’s mouth opened in shock—dragged her fingers through his blood. </p><p>She was so stunned by the action that she barely noticed as Agatha rose up, stalked forward, then pressed Rio flush to the cold brick wall behind them, hovering her bloodied fingers by Rio’s lips.</p><p>“Open up,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Wh—what?”</p><p>“Open up, Rio,” she said, even quieter then. But her fangs were protruding over her lip.</p><p>Feeling like she might just do anything if Agatha asked, Rio begrudgingly opened her lips, and Agatha inserted them languidly. </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched when Rio’s tongue darted instinctually to the blood—licking it clean without even meaning to. It was simply habitual.</p><p>And ugh, she immediately regretted it—it tasted terrible and moldy and dry, like beer that had been sitting in the sun.</p><p>Agatha’s pupils were completely blown when she shakily asked, “<em>And? </em>”</p><p>Rio’s tongue circled Agatha’s fingers once more before Agatha dragged them out.</p><p>“And… what?” Rio asked, heartbeat thudding.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darted down to her lips, then back to her eyes.</p><p>“Did it work? Do you feel… different? Less… desperate? Like normal again?”</p><p>
<em> Oh. </em>
</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Agatha was asking if this had fixed her.</p><p>Rio was too high, drunk, and frankly, <em> over it </em> to say anything else then—</p><p>“You’re asking me if I still want to bury my teeth in your neck?</p><p>Agatha sighed, and it sounded involuntary.</p><p>“<em>Yes.</em>”</p><p>“Oh. In that case.” Rio licked her lips. “Yes, I still want to do that. Very much so. Maybe even more now, because that man tasted like the fucking gutter. But also—”</p><p>She put her hands on either side of Agatha’s face, cupping her cheeks.</p><p>She wanted to hold Agatha in place so she truly understood the gravity of the point she was making. So she couldn’t escape it, evade it, try to look away—</p><p>She breathed in raggedly. “I think I’m beyond fixing, Agatha. Whatever you did—whatever you activated—it's permanent. It’s not going away. It’s <em> terminal.</em>”</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>She looked properly dumbfounded. Speechless.</p><p>“I see,” she said, finally, like some kind of fucking medical doctor.</p><p>But then, she pressed Rio harder to the wall, and slotted her thigh between Rio’s legs. Rio couldn’t help but groan at the contact, arching to meet her.</p><p>Agatha whimpered in her ear as she pressed her mouth to Rio’s neck, and whispered something like a confession:</p><p>“I think it might be terminal for me, too.”</p><p>Then she drove her fangs into Rio’s neck.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Most mortals lived in constant fear of death. Which of course, Rio would allow, was mostly understandable—death meant disease, corpses, flies, and most fearsome of all (if the adults were to be believed) <em> money for funerals </em>—but Rio had never really understood what the big deal was.</p><p> Ever since she was a young girl in Lugo, sneaking around the village graveyard, hiding behind stones and silently imitating the way mourners shoveled dirt into a shallow grave, Rio felt comforted in the singular ending death presented.</p><p>She liked it in the same way she’d always liked lines (they had a definitive beginning, and a definitive ending), counting (numbers always pleased her in ways people didn’t), measuring cups (she’d sneak into the kitchen just to measure milk before drinking it), and symmetry (later in life, she’d arrange corpses by height, always ascending).</p><p>It wasn’t until she approached ten years old that she feared anything at all. </p><p>That fear, as she’d eventually come to name it—was Transformation.</p><p>It all started with an abrupt and sudden moment of loss, as most phobias do. It was her first pet—a caterpillar. Small and green and wriggly and perfect.</p><p>Rio kept it in her room in secret, in a glass jar, fed it leaves and let it climb on twigs, freed it occasionally to go on daisy walks in the field.</p><p>But then one day, as summer crested over rural Spain, her pudgy fingers screwed off the top of the jar, and Rio first encountered that <em> thing—</em>that something that was worse than death. </p><p>Her beloved wriggly creature was no more. It had been replaced, and now it was hard and rigid like the shell of a pea.</p><p>Rio was inconsolable for days on end; she refused to follow her friends into the fields, or eat the breakfast porridge with her favorite berries, or even play card games. </p><p>Her parents’ explanations did not help. She only grew angrier when they told her the creature had no choice but to become something else, that it was predestined, that it would change once more, that it would someday become something even more beautiful than what it was to begin with.</p><p><em> Something even more beautiful. </em>That part disgruntled her the most. </p><p>Beauty, Rio had believed, came only through intention—Rio’s aunt knitting herself a new skirt for the spring, her mother plucking her eyebrows to more perfectly arch over brown eyes—beauty was by design, not painting the village pig when it was sleeping.</p><p>But eventually, the prophecy did come to pass. Blue wings peeked out of that hard pea-shell she so detested, newborn eyes blinking up at her.</p><p>She wanted to ask the butterfly, “do you remember who you were before?” but it could not speak her language, and she could not speak its—so she was forced to watch it flutter away through the window, and sit with her own frigid emptiness.</p><p>Ever since then, Rio always suspected—with that eerie sense of divination that most children possess—that she’d suffer the same fate. </p><p>That something foreign would root itself deeply and violently into her, like the stems of a demonic tree, replacing her blood cell for blood cell like a corporeal Ship of Theseus. </p><p>That she’d become an alien in her own body, flailing desperately for the controls.</p><p>And of course, the fear did eventually manifest, when the man in the suit arrived from out of town – <em> Hola Sra. Vidal, Señor Vidal, ¿puedo pasar? – </em>his skin frighteningly pale like a spectre. The man had bitten her and left no evidence. Even Rio’s memories eventually bore no witness to the past. </p><p>She was left with just a cloud of assumptions about her life as the caterpillar. More fiction than fact. So in the years since, Rio sought to prevent another transformation at all costs—</p><p>By controlling herself, controlling others, controlling her environment. </p><p>Few enemies, fewer friends. </p><p>Anything that got within rooting distance was clipped at the stem. </p><p>Except Agatha.</p><p>Agatha, who Rio had been drawn to for her obviousness. </p><p>Agatha was manipulative, but in the way that came with a wink and a tip of a top hat. She was a Vaudeville showgirl, not Dracula hiding under the bed.</p><p>Of course, this didn’t mean that Rio hadn’t tried at every turn to make Agatha reveal herself. She tested Agatha incessantly at first, bore her most grievous wounds and waited for her to run and hide.</p><p>But Agatha never did. </p><p>Her acceptance of Rio’s quirks—the way she counted her steps when she walked, or got lost in a train of thought mid-sentence, or murdered for the thrill of it—didn’t scare Agatha; Agatha never sought to change her, only to exploit—and eventually, even appreciate, in her own way—the strange creature that was already there.</p><p>So Rio had never suspected her.</p><p>Never once, until it was already over, the surgery was done, forever irrevocable—and Rio was exiting the cocoon again, newborn eyes peeking out into broad daylight, and wondering who she ever was before. If she’d ever remember, or if this new her would be all there ever was.</p><p>That was how it felt when Agatha whispered those words into her ear—</p><p>
<em> “I think it’s terminal for me, too.” </em>
</p><p>And her fangs sunk in.</p><p>And for all the ways that Rio’s reality had just shifted irrevocably, for all the reasons that she could (and <em> should)</em> be pissed that they hadn’t done this six hundred years earlier, that Agatha hadn’t given her the <em> choice </em> to fall in love — asked her at some point along the way, “do you mind? It might be painful”— instead of blindsiding Rio into it, luring her like a lost dog until she was at the bottom of a well with no ladder, all Rio could muster was a useless, whimpering, <em> hopeful, </em></p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Then Agatha’s knee pushed up against her center, and every lovely overwrought metaphor in Rio’s head emptied like a water can. </p><p>“Don’t believe me?” Agatha mumbled against the open wound in her neck. Rio could almost hear how red her eyes were. “Feel it.”</p><p>Not for the first time, Rio had no idea what she meant. Also not for the first time, Agatha forewent words and used her hands instead, clawing Rio’s wrist and placing it, with an electric shock to Rio’s entire being, between Agatha’s legs.</p><p>Rio hoped she said something salvageable like <em> Agatha </em> or <em> Dear God </em> or informative like <em> Fuck Me, </em>but in reality whatever came out of her mouth was a considerably less sexy mixture of vowels and consonants that muddled together into one long, obscene moan that the nightclub CCTV would most definitely record, reproduce, and send to the police.</p><p>She could see the Daily Mail headline already. <em> Blood sucking murderers get frisky moments after beating a man to death with shoe heel. </em> But she couldn’t find it in herself to care. This alleyway was discreet enough, dark <em> enough. </em>And even if it wasn’t…</p><p>Agatha’s fangs left her throat with a pop, and she leaned back, her cheeks flushed, her chin painted red with Rio’s blood, and her pupils dilated to hell and back.</p><p>Rio wanted her in a way that she could barely put into words.</p><p>Agatha made it so she didn’t have to. “Hitch up the dress, Rio.”</p><p>And Rio obeyed with a singular focus that terrified her. </p><p>
<em> Is this what it feels like to be a thrall?  </em>
</p><p><em> To do someone else’s bidding and feel like it was all your idea? </em> </p><p>Maybe, but either way, the end result was the same. Rio hitched up the dress so it was just above Agatha’s underwear, a silky black piece of lace. </p><p>She felt a feral urge crop up inside herself at the sight of it—something monstrous. She needed it <em> gone </em>. She needed to know, needed to feel—</p><p>“Can I?” Rio said weakly.  </p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, her hooded eyes still pinned to Rio like a stone gargoyle. Rio had expected her to remain in her neck, to suck her dry while Rio touched her, but Agatha was surprisingly immobile. </p><p>
<em> She likes to watch. </em>
</p><p>Of course she does.</p><p>Rio’s stomach coiled even tighter at the thought.</p><p>Carefully, with a reverence a priest would reserve only for the scripture, Rio slowly peeled damp lace to the side, and—keeping her eyes trained on Agatha’s face, on her shallow breathing, on her blood red eyes—slid her fingers against Agatha’s center.</p><p>And oh—oh <em> god. </em> </p><p>Her own hips bucked up uncontrollably against Agatha’s thigh, and the pet name slipped out like butter. “Baby, you’re so—”</p><p>Agatha laughed crassly, cutting her off. </p><p>“Wet? I fucking know. I’ve been like this for hours. You wouldn’t stop—” Agatha bit down on Rio’s neck again, only a nip, and groaned. “—<em> teasing </em>me.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened, the information somehow even hotter than the way Agatha’s fangs were grazing against her nape. “You were like this while we were dancing?”</p><p>Agatha whined. “Of course I was. Fuck the dancing, I’ve been like this ever since you killed Ashcroft. I’ve gone through half my underwear drawer in the last two days.” She slid against Rio and groaned. “Fuck, fuck. Enough talking, I need, I need—”</p><p>
<em> I’ve been like this ever since you killed Ashcroft. </em>
</p><p>Rio’s stomach tightened impossibly more at the words.</p><p>
<em> That couldn’t be true. </em>
</p><p>Because if that was true, then that would mean Agatha had been wet for her—had been wanting this, couldn’t stop thinking about this—at work, at home, on the couch, in bed at night, twisting and turning, in the morning when she made Rio breakfast, when she smudged the leftover egg off Rio’s mouth—</p><p>“<em>Rio, </em>” Agatha growled. “Touch me before the cops come, or I’ll call them myself.”</p><p>Rio whimpered like the thrall she was. She dragged her thumb past Agatha’s clit—once, experimentally—and the other vampire bucked against her with a cry, her fangs sinking full mast into Rio’s shoulder. Rio felt the pain like the most exquisite knife.</p><p>“God, fuck, <em> yes. </em> Right there, right there.<em>”  </em>Rio could feel the blood leaking from Agatha’s moaning mouth onto her shoulder, and it turned her on even more. “You can’t even imagine how many times I…”</p><p>Rio was so distracted by Agatha’s words she momentarily forgot herself, stilling her motions on Agatha’s clit—but Agatha quickly repaid her with a snarl, bucking messily against Rio’s wrist and pressing another warning bite higher on her neck. </p><p>“Sorry,” Rio whimpered. </p><p>“You better be,” Agatha hummed before moaning again when Rio picked up the pace. “God, you’re so good at this. I should have known you’d be so good at this. You take direction so well. Why haven’t we done this sooner?”</p><p>The praise made her head go dizzy, but still Rio couldn’t get Agatha’s trailed off sentence out of her head. “I wouldn’t believe how many times you <em> what </em>, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha’s motions were getting unsteady now, thrusting unevenly into Rio’s palm, which had become a slick, drenched mess of dimpled skin. Meanwhile, the sounds coming from the back of Agatha’s throat were high and ragged.</p><p>It took some coaxing with Rio’s fingers, but eventually Agatha confessed. “You wouldn’t believe… how many times I’ve touched myself this week,” she mumbled almost shyly against Rio’s neck as she slid against her fingers. “Thinking about coming with my fangs inside of you.”</p><p>Rio nearly came undone just at the thought of it.</p><p>“Oh <em> god. </em>Agatha—”</p><p> “So I’ve been doing research.”</p><p>She said the words so plainly and apathetically against Rio’s skin, Rio almost laughed in shock. But the feeling of Agatha’s cunt grinding against her hand stopped any chance of that.</p><p>Rio nearly choked. “Research?”</p><p>“Yes. About the soul bite—eternal marking—<em> thing,” </em> she groaned, pressing Rio harder into the cold cement wall. She was certain they’d leave a dent. “And it turns out we won’t—fuck—we won’t activate it unless—oh  god—unless—Rio, baby, I’m going to, I’m going to—”</p><p>Agatha’s fangs melted further into her, and Rio didn’t know what to do with herself—with her hands, with her legs, with the emotions bubbling like rockets in her stomach—so she just kept the pace, and used her free palm to press against the back of Agatha’s head, pushing her deeper in.</p><p>But Agatha’s unfinished sentence scared her. Was this how the ritual worked? Was she doing something wrong? Would she accidentally trigger it?</p><p>“Agatha— Should I—should I stop?”</p><p>“Fuck no,” Agatha cried. “No, I—I’m so close. God, you feel so good. Rio. <em> Rio. </em>”</p><p>As the last syllable of Rio’s name came out of Agatha’s lips, a fresh coat of wetness covered Rio’s palm, and Agatha shuddered against her. She rutted slowly, once, twice, her breath haggard, before coming to a stop, and slowly extricating her fangs from Rio’s neck.</p><p>Then, like an angel falling from heaven, Agatha slowly bowed backward, so their faces were levitating like two magnets, drawn in and out of each other’s orbit. Agatha’s mouth was stained so completely red she looked like her very own murder scene—but her eyes were as wide and innocent as a doe. </p><p>She looked almost startled by her own desire.</p><p>“<em>Fuck, </em>” Agatha breathed. Then, without pretense, she whispered, “Thank you.”</p><p>As if not having Rio really had been tormenting her for weeks.</p><p>Unable to do anything productive with that information, Rio swallowed in agreement, her hand acting of its own volition to clean the blood from Agatha’s lips, then softly cup her cheek. </p><p>Rio expected to feel desire in that moment, and she did—low and nearly incapacitating in her stomach—but, taking in Agatha’s soft, stunned expression, something else presented itself.</p><p>Rio wanted…</p><p>No, Rio <em> needed </em> to kiss her.</p><p>She looked at Agatha’s lips, then her eyes, asking permission.</p><p>She felt the other woman’s heartbeat pick up. But she didn’t nod yes or no. She just blinked, mouth agape. Like a machine whose gears had ground to a halt.</p><p>But before Rio could use her mouth to clarify, someone a few feet away from them screamed like they’d just found a dead body.</p><p>Oh wait.</p><p>“<em>Vincent? </em>”</p><p>It was a testament to just how lost in the moment both of them were that it took them, with their vampiric agility, at least five full seconds to react.</p><p>Rio moved first, her fingers sliding out of Agatha’s cunt in a way that made her knees weak, and she turned toward the sound—</p><p>And standing there, one hand holding Agatha’s favorite Pink Margarita, the other holding his iPhone flashlight, was that skinny man from the bar. </p><p>Vincent’s… friend. Right.</p><p>Agatha groaned, then rolled up her sleeves.</p><p>“Seriously?” she clicked her tongue. “Before I even get to return the favor?”</p><p>And she pulled off her other heel.</p>

<p>Rio crumpled what was left of the security camera in her hand, and searched the street corners until she could toss it into the nearest garbage bin.</p><p>She would never be caught littering, even with murder evidence. </p><p>Agatha, meanwhile—</p><p>Rio heard a loud <em> splash </em> as the second body hit the East River.</p><p>The other vampire met Rio’s frown with a grand grin. Rio didn’t have to open her mouth for Agatha to hear what she would have said about her disposal process. </p><p>“Oh, come on. It’s not littering. I’m feeding the fish,” Agatha huffed, before pausing, and glancing down at the putrid, foul-smelling water. Her nose wrinkled. “If there are any left. God, the city really needs to do something about the sewage smell.”</p><p>
<em> Says the woman tossing in corpses. </em>
</p><p>Rio sighed. <em> Pick your battles. </em> “That’s not what I’m worried about.” She gestured to the slow-moving, or rather <em> nonexistent </em> tide in the river. “You’re not hiding evidence. You’re introducing corpse-shaped pool floaties. They aren’t even moving, Agatha. They’re just… sitting there.”</p><p>“Sure they’re moving,” Agatha muttered petulantly. “They’re… bobbing up and down.”</p><p>Rio pinched the bridge of her nose tiredly, the cold midnight air making her damp, blood-covered clothes stick to her like prickly icicles. She was covered head to toe in red—completely doused.</p><p>
<em> I feel like an extra in a low budget horror film. </em>
</p><p>Agatha had gotten a bit too creative with that shoe heel, and Rio got splattered with gore like she’d been front row at the whale show at SeaWorld.</p><p>Not to say it wasn’t intensely sexy. It was that.</p><p>But it was also, if Rio was being completely honest—terrifying. </p><p>Because, well, that kill had been <em> possessive. </em> </p><p>She could find no other word for it.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness had killed more than her fair share of people in her long and morally grey life—but she really wasn’t a career murderer. </p><p>No, if Rio had to give her a job title, one she could stick as a headline on LinkedIn, she’d call Agatha a world-class con artist and a petty thief. </p><p>She left cold blooded disembodiment to Rio while she stole the corpse’s jewelry off their clammy hands and fished through jacket pockets for cash. </p><p>If Agatha could help it, she preferred not to get her hands dirty. She hated the feeling of dried blood under her fingernails.</p><p>And <em> yet. </em></p><p>That kill was the type that would have her washing her hands for months. </p><p>Blood in every crevice, gore in every wrinkle of her dress. </p><p>Agatha took that man apart <em> gleefully </em>, blood splattering the walls like an unaired episode of Dexter. Nostrils flared, snarling. Repeating the same phrase over and over under breath, barely audible—</p><p>“<em>Don’t even look at her.” </em></p><p>Like a woman possessed.</p><p>And then she’d just laughed, curt and business-like, turned to Rio with a wide smile, and slid her bloody hands over Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>
<em> “Now.” She licked her lips like a wild animal who’d just picked clean a bone. “Where were we?” </em>
</p><p>And as much as seeing Agatha Barbie-Shoe man to death had turned Rio into a complete and utter <em> mess </em> beneath her dress <em> — </em>it was hard to get back into the swing of things knowing their chances of being discovered were teetering somewhere near one-hundred-percent.</p><p>And Rio was in no mood to go back to federal prison. Not when she’d just gotten her first taste of what she hoped was the rest of her life.</p><p>So Rio had taken care of the cameras, and Agatha the bodies. They’d stowed them away in the big trash bags hiding behind the club’s dumpsters, then dragged them through a series of alleys until they emerged by the lip of the river. </p><p>Luckily, this wasn’t the first time Agatha had killed someone at this particular club—it was her favorite spot for a reason—so she knew just the path to avoid the more crowded streets and potential cop cars waiting to bust drunk hecklers.</p><p>Dusting off bloody hands like some kind of midnight janitor, Agatha rejoined Rio in the corridor, the two of them illuminated only by a half-broken streetlight.</p><p>Agatha looked like a specter under the sharp white light. Blood streaming down her arms, dribbling from her hand. The mortal in Rio trembled at the sight, as if a deep part of her was remembering what it felt like to be scared of monsters.</p><p>“I want the pigs to find them like this, anyway,” Agatha explained, leaning against the wall and tilting her head back. “Something to distract from the news cycle around the Ashcrofts.”</p><p>“Uh huh.” Rio only half-bought that story.</p><p>It wouldn’t be Agatha unless she left behind a scene. It was her signature—a Bucharest ballroom with half a dozen beheaded monarchs strewn like confetti, a London cafe with baristas sagging against metal machines, blood dripping into the coffee. </p><p>Agatha liked crafting a puzzle. Murder and mayhem were her performance art. If some twenty-something wasn’t writing a literary analysis on her latest massacre, Agatha would write in to the papers and complain.</p><p>But this showpiece—Two Bodies in a River, Oil on Canvas—was surprisingly tame.</p><p>Almost as if Agatha had other things on her mind. Other things that became abundantly clear when she slunk close to Rio in the shadows, the heat vibrating off her body like a small, earthly sun.</p><p>“So…” That wolfish smile was back on Agatha’s face, like clockwork, as if the bodies of Vincent and Not Vincent weren’t bobbing like apples in the river just ten feet away. “Should we pick up where we left off?”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha pushed her gently into the wall. The monster had her cornered like prey, both hands placed on either side of Rio’s head, nose bowing down to inhale Rio’s neck. Her bite from earlier was crusted over with dried blood.</p><p>“I was thinking I could…” Agatha’s hand pinched at her waist, then began to trail down. “Repay the favor?”</p><p>When Rio said nothing, Agatha withdrew her head to look at her, an eyebrow perched, asking for permission without having to ask for permission. </p><p>And oh, <em> God. </em></p><p>Rio realized she had never seen want in someone else’s eyes until now.</p><p>Mortals had desired her before, with a kind of huffy, lustful insistence. But Agatha wanted her in the same way that children clung to toys in the sandbox. <em> This is mine</em>. <em> This will never be yours. </em></p><p>But Rio couldn’t differentiate if this was something Agatha really felt, or if it was a transient state passing through her. A drunken urge intermingled with Rio’s blood in her veins.</p><p> But no matter what it was, Rio could see the way Agatha’s lip trembled when she bit it, how her eyes blazed so bright, her pupils couldn’t even focus.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t in her body anymore.</p><p>An animal—that monster Rio had sensed, that her humanity had shivered at—had taken her over, something raw and biological. A wild tiger operating human legs and human arms, human wants and human needs.</p><p>And two things became true simultaneously.</p><p>One, that Rio was so wet she could sink the Titanic.</p><p>And two, that she couldn’t do this again when Agatha was like this. When she was in such a heightened state, numb to the repercussions.</p><p>Because Rio cared about her too much.</p><p>
<em> No, it’s not that. It’s not that selfless. </em>
</p><p>Rio frowned.</p><p>
<em> It’s because you want more than just this. </em>
</p><p>The thought warped and contorted, until it unwrapped itself in Rio’s mind, plain and obvious like a knife through the neck.</p><p>
<em> I want her to want me even when she doesn’t have my blood in her mouth. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I want her to want me sober. </em>
</p><p>The realization pierced through Rio like a bullet, and she swallowed the fiery casing. It burned all the way down. </p><p>And the current began pulling her in.</p><p>
<em> But what if she doesn’t? </em>
</p><p>
<em> What if this is my one chance to feel her hands on me before she comes to her senses? </em>
</p><p>
<em> What if we live forever and I never touch her again in a million immortal years? </em>
</p><p> They were caught up in a drugged up smoke cloud, a bubble made of cigarette ash—pure, undisguised lust. Murder on their hands like the world’s finest stimulant. Any intrusion from reality could pop the dream like a fingernail.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slipped with an arduous slowness down Rio’s hips, her fingers halting at the sheer piece of black fabric covering her underwear. Rio had to stop herself from arching toward the other woman’s hand like some kind of possessed magnet. Like a voodoo doll that Agatha had put enough pins in to make her burst.</p><p>“Tell me about—tell me about the biting thing first,” Rio breathed, finding the self control somewhere within her to grab Agatha’s wrist to stop it from moving further down. “The ritual.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth formed a surprised <em> o </em>, and she bit down on her lip, a fang exposed.</p><p>And then, in a petulant tone that was so <em> thoroughly </em> Agatha, she frowned and mumbled, “Let’s discuss that later. Need to touch you.”</p><p>And oh God, the neediness in her voice, like if she didn’t get to touch Rio she might just cry, was just about enough to make Rio break; to let Agatha ravish her within an inch of her life.</p><p>She breathed a shaky breath out and tightened her grip on Agatha’s wrist. “<em> Agatha. </em> As much as I would like that—” Need it, really. As much as she needed blood, Agatha’s fingers on her, Agatha’s <em> mouth.</em> Oh god, oh god. “I think we should go home before someone finds us — finds us like <em> this </em> — five feet away from a dismembered arm.”</p><p>As she considered it, Agatha’s eyes slowly dulled back to green. Her hand went limp where Rio was gripping it, and she looked toward the river.</p><p>“Fine. <em> Killjoy.</em>”</p><p>
<br/>

<br/>
</p><p>The apartment had never felt so large.</p><p>As they slowly descended into the space, shucking off jackets, scrubbing their hands free of blood under hot sink water, Rio felt a phenomenon she’d never felt around Agatha—awkwardness. </p><p>It seemed to fill the space like a water bucket, magnifying the distance between their bodies. The couch felt as big as a fallen tree trunk, the windows as tall and thick as a giant’s spectacles.</p><p>Rio dragged the curtains closed, and when she turned around, she saw Agatha just standing there, leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed, lip bitten in a frown of concentration. Staring at her.</p><p>She looked nervous.</p><p><em> Agatha </em>looked nervous.</p><p>God, this was a day for firsts.</p><p>The other vampire took in a long breath, and began to walk toward her, silently, her footsteps like mouse prints on the floor, her shadow streaking long and lithe across the wall—almost an entity in itself.</p><p>It reminded Rio of those 80’s vampire movies Agatha had all the DVDs for. How the camera always lingered on the hints of the monster—their cape in the wind, their hands, always scarred up to the knuckles—never showing the full creature right until the very end, camera pushed right into its face, every wrinkle and detail projected terrifying, ugly glory.</p><p>But as Agatha stepped into the light of their living room lamp, her sharp nose and full lips painted under the softest glow, Rio could only describe her as the most beautiful thing she’d ever seen.</p><p>“Hi,” said Agatha quitely, lips curling up almost shyly, and that only proved to confirm it—</p><p>“Hi,” Rio breathed back.</p><p>It was so obvious. The whole time, it had been staring at her, plain in the face.</p><p>“Looks like we’re alone again.”</p><p>“Looks like it.”</p><p>Agatha brought her hand up and put it to Rio’s beating heart where it sat below her dress, curling her fingers around the fabric. </p><p>And Rio couldn’t help but think it, the terrible, obvious thing—</p><p>She was in love.</p><p>She was in love.</p><p>She was in love.</p><p>Oh god.</p><p>She was in love with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Packaged with that realization was a headline from an old Bucharest tabloid, which popped in Rio’s head almost at random, unbidden. </p><p>It was a report on a sudden shock of untraceable murders across Eastern Europe. Detectives had searched and plotted and dug to the point of exhuaustion, but the perpetrator—a woman with untameable raven hair, seen only once, riding a train south, to Spain—was like a ghost.</p><p><em> God must favor the devil, </em> said the headline on the front of the paper, written in black, <em> Because He gleefully lets her get away with the worst of sins. </em></p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered shakily, her hands moving of their own volition to Agatha’s warm cheeks. She found herself unable to find the right words. Everything felt too big and too small at once. Like a straight jacket in an open ocean.</p><p>Agatha breathed, “Yes?”</p><p>And Rio inhaled sharply.</p><p>“Do you want me?”</p><p>She knew it was only a half-question. She knew it was cowardice disguised as bravery. She knew that Agatha might still wake up to regret this when all the drugs and the adrenaline had washed off, that Agatha might only <em> want </em> her for a night when Rio, in fact, <em> needed </em> her—and for much longer than that.</p><p>She knew she had never felt more terrified in her entire life. </p><p>And yet she didn’t regret asking it.</p><p>And Agatha froze.</p><p>Froze for so long that Rio nearly reeled back everything she’d ever said and ever thought, like a desperate fish on a line.</p><p>But then Agatha shifted. She leaned forward, shoved her hand roughly into Rio’s hair, so she was clawing at the back of her scalp, and then, with a voice as honest as Rio had ever heard it,</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha moaned. “<em>Desperately.</em>”</p><p>And crashed her lips to Rio’s.</p>

<p>When Agatha placed her down on the bed with the light touch you might expect from a ballerina, and not a vampire with blood dribbling from her mouth, Rio knew even if someone wiped her mind clean with bleach, erased every wrinkle in her brain, this memory would somehow remain.</p><p>The memory of Agatha kissing her senseless against the window, her still-bloody palms staining the glass red; the memory of the way Rio laughed like a schoolgirl, giddy and so, so <em> happy, </em>even if she’d never say so, when Agatha picked her up, her mouth still on hers, and carried her to the bed.</p><p>“This is so unnecessary. I can <em> walk, </em>” Rio had teased stupidly against her lips. To which Agatha sneered, like the thousand year old frat boy that she was, “Not when I’m done with you.”</p><p>A threat she had so far failed to make good on. Like two drunk teenagers, they’d gotten as far as the mattress, and lost themselves so much in the <em> idea </em> of sex that they’d completely failed to do anything about it. Clothes still on, two bodies wrapped up into each other in the dark.</p><p>But Rio didn’t mind at all. Making out felt like a new magic trick they’d discovered together, as mystical as anything they’d earned through their blood rites. And just as Rio would hone her magic through study, she treated kissing Agatha with the same reverence. </p><p>Like a rat in a pavlovian puzzle, she learned everything that made Agatha squeak, and repeated it ad nauseum—biting her lower lip, kissing her fast, then slow. She made mental notes of every sound the other woman made, categorized it in her brain under <em> Do again </em> and <em> Don’t do again </em>, and prayed to God—something she hadn’t done in a thousand years, since the Turning—that she’d get a chance to do any of it again, after this. After the haze broke.</p><p>But the haze didn’t break, it only dispersed. Agatha strayed from her face and kissed down her collarbones, her arms, to the palms of her hands. Rio trembled when Agatha rolled up her dress to her waist, exposing her underwear, and kissed her inner thighs. “Gorgeous,” Agatha whispered against them, and Rio’s center throbbed at the praise. Agatha’s nose nudged her right there, and—</p><p>“<em>Please. </em>”</p><p>Agatha chuckled meanly. “Paciencia.”</p><p>Rio hated ever teaching her Spanish.</p><p>And then, cruel as she was, Agatha pulled back, and traced her way back up to Rio’s face, far away from her desire. Agatha hovered over her, her gorgeous, erratic curls trapping Rio in a lightless cocoon.</p><p>All she could see were Agatha’s red eyes, her half-bitten lips. Nothing else in the room—nothing else in the world, really, bar a bomb through the window, or a bullet in the head—could breach through their bubble.</p><p>Agatha leaned down to kiss her again, and Rio whimpered into it.</p><p>Their lips disconnected, saliva dribbling between them, and Agatha said, with that shit-eating grin of hers that permeated even the most intimate moments, “You kiss way too decently for someone who hasn’t had sex in a hundred years.”</p><p>Rio balked. She wanted to be offended, but really the backhanded compliment only comforted her. Because she had been scared, like a child who had heard the unending preaching of abstinence, that whatever they were doing would turn them into different people at the end. But Agatha was still crass and stupid, and Rio was ever-ready to let her know it.</p><p>She brought her fingers up to Agatha’s upper lip and pinched it.  “And it’s a miracle you find any women who want to kiss you when you can never<em> shut up.</em>”</p><p>Agatha laughed delightedly at her rudeness, and Rio knew it was delighted because she skipped Rio’s mouth entirely, pressing excited kisses to her jaw, her cheeks, her forehead—and <em> oh— </em> it took everything inside Rio not to melt completely by the time she reached her chin.</p><p>Because it almost felt like there was nothing sexual at all about the kisses. It just felt like <em> them</em>, like Agatha and Rio, best of murderous friends, the them that existed before the bedlam of the last few weeks. </p><p>So why did it feel so romantic?</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure what she aimed to say, probably something horribly unwise. To her luck, Agatha cut her off anyway. The other woman slowly reeled back from her assault of kisses before speaking, and she had this considering, thoughtful expression on her face. <em> That’s never good. </em></p><p>“It’s kind of bizarre, isn’t it,” Agatha said quietly. “That we’ve never done this before. I mean, we’ve been friends for centuries. We’ve both been insanely hot the entire time. I’m into women, you’re into women. Murder turns both of us on like two Harleys. What gives?”</p><p>Rio felt her pulse quicken in her neck. </p><p>Of course, Agatha wouldn’t let her lose herself to the haze for too long. She was too much of a sadist for that. She had to drag Rio through the hot coals of reality.</p><p>“<em>Is </em> it really that bizarre?” she responded hastily, not really ready to discuss it.</p><p>Agatha snorted, because Rio had answered a question with a question. Evasive maneuvering 101. She’d stolen the technique shamelessly out of Agatha’s handbook. </p><p>Like, her <em> actual </em> handbook. </p><p>(Who do you think wrote<em> How To Make Friends and Influence People?</em>)</p><p>“Oh come on, Rio. Don’t be coy.”</p><p>But before Rio could decide just how coy she wanted to be, Agatha dipped her head to Rio’s neck, and licked her tongue along it. Goosebumps immediately cropped up Rio’s body.</p><p>“I just never thought you were interested in me like—well,” Agatha mumbled against her skin. She stalled for a second, as if considering how to end her sentence, and in place of finishing it, she let her fingers trail down to Rio’s underwear, thumbing against where she was wettest. Rio let out a surprised gasp and squirmed, and she could feel Agatha grin greedily against her. “Like <em> that.”</em></p><p>“Oh god.”</p><p>Agatha grinned gleefully. “I’d prefer you use my first name.”</p><p>And before Rio could punish her for such a stupid, <em> stupid </em> joke, Agatha’s hand slipped beneath her underwear, and her fingers spilled across Rio’s center. Rio whined disastrously.</p><p>“Tell me,” Agatha said lowly in her ear, demanding. Rio had only ever heard her use this voice during Suggestion, but she could tell that wasn’t what was happening. This was another Agatha entirely; one Rio hadn’t been privy to until now. That thought made her buck up involuntarily. “Did it all really start with the first bite? Have you ever—before—”</p><p>Agatha began to drag slow circles around Rio’s clit, and Rio saw stars. She began to thrust slowly upward, into Agatha’s palm, but Agatha made a tutting noise, and pressed her down into the mattress, so she couldn’t buck against her.</p><p>“Answer first.”</p><p>“Answer what?” Rio moaned. “You didn’t even finish your own question.”</p><p>“Did you ever want to touch me before I bit you?”</p><p>Agatha met her gaze, and Rio could tell from the narrowing of her eyes that she was serious. This was both a game and a genuine question.</p><p>So, with reluctance, Rio thought back. Because even if Agatha was torturing her, it was torture Rio was maddeningly curious about herself—when had the inciting event really started? Had this been festering for longer than that? It felt naive to say it was only now. It felt silly and terminally human to insist it was since forever.</p><p>She thumbed across Rio’s clit just once, and Rio whined.</p><p>“You’re cruel.”</p><p>“Tell me,” Agatha repeated. “And then I’ll be plenty nice.”</p><p>“God, Agatha. I don’t know,” Rio confessed. “I think… I think it did start with the bite. I never really—” And because Agatha could never let her finish a sentence, she started pleasuring her again, her thumb sliding up, down, up. “Fuck. I’ve just never been that much of a—” Agatha left her clit alone for a mere second, then dragged her fingers down near Rio’s entrance. “Fuck. <em> Please.</em>”</p><p>“You’ve never been a what, Rio? Use your words.”</p><p>“Fuck you,” Rio whined. “<em>Fuck me.</em>”</p><p>“Tell me first. What were you going to say?”</p><p>“A sexual person. I’ve never been much of a sexual person.”</p><p>And at that, at the juxtaposition of Rio begging Agatha to slide inside her to that completely earnest confession, Agatha cackled meanly, and for a moment Rio hated her, in that way where hate was actually love disguised, where someone is so terrible and endearing and terribly endearing that you lose track of which came first, and soon enough you’re smiling at them with murder on your mind.</p><p>But then Agatha softened. Something in her expression looked genuinely pained, conflicted. It made Rio immediately uneasy. Had she given her the wrong answer? Had Agatha hoped for something different? And then, like being cut with a razor, it hit Rio—</p><p>Just how long had <em> Agatha </em> wanted to touch her?</p><p>Any answer except <em> never, until recently, </em> conflicted heavily with Rio’s recollection of events, which looked something like this: Agatha had bit her, awakened something in Rio, then she pitied her and tried to take care of it. And through the course of doing that, Agatha had actually started to find Rio attractive—perhaps she’d found Rio good-looking before, but not in a way that was accompanied by any urges—and now here they were, fucking because they both wanted it.</p><p>Well, fucking with the disclaimer that Rio certainly, quietly, wanted something more, something she still barely understood, but would probably kill her in the end—but certainly Agatha was only here to get off. She’d never seen the other vampire <em> date </em>. She wouldn’t even bring home the same woman twice, for fear that she’d be too clingy.</p><p>“That’s what bothers me,” Agatha said, finally. And Rio gave her a confused look. “That I’ve known you for six hundred years, and you’ve taken someone home, I don’t know, four times?”</p><p>Rio’s brow creased. She began to feel self-conscious. </p><p>“So you’re bothered by my… lack of experience?”</p><p>Sure, it wasn’t much by vampiric standards, but she’d definitely done it more than most of the mortals Agatha brought home. Why should she be held to a different standard?</p><p>Agatha answered that question with another rude laugh.</p><p>“Not at all. If anything.” She lowered her voice. “I like teaching.”</p><p>Rio groaned embarrassingly just at the tone of it, and pressed her hips desperately into Agatha’s hand. But Agatha refused to move her fingers anymore. Apparently, they had ended up in a Serious Discussion. One that Agatha viewed as more important than getting Rio off. A tragedy.</p><p>“I just… It’s hard for me to get in the mood when – when I’m wracked with this guilty conscience. I don’t do well with guilt, you know. I feel it so rarely that it gives me hives.”</p><p>She took Rio’s hand and splayed it against her arm, which was covered in a thin layer of barely-there goosebumps. Agatha sported her best <em> pity me </em>expression. Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Those aren’t hives.” <em> This idiot. </em>“And what do you have to feel guilty about?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, withdrawing completely from Rio and sitting up on the bed. Rio missed her touch with an ache she wasn’t proud of.</p><p>“Because the bite is the only reason you feel this way. You’d still be a little celibate nun otherwise,” Agatha said, looking at the chipped white plaster of the walls and running a hand through her hair. She had that cruel, vacant look about her that she got when she was about to confess something vulnerable.  “And I did that to you, like some kind of fucked up sex spell, and now I’m… taking advantage of the consequences. It makes me feel like a predator. Like a…”</p><p><em> Like a beast </em>, went unsaid, but Rio knew that’s what her mother would always call her. Evanora had not been a fan of Agatha’s proclivities towards women. It was a wound that went deep and scarred badly, and Rio could see it re-open in Agatha’s stilted expression.</p><p>It immediately made Rio want to reach out and cover her in kisses. But fear kept her frozen.</p><p>Agatha bowed her head, and when it nodded up again, she had this sad smile on her face.</p><p>“I know. I know. The ancient vampire has her panties in a twist about being a predator, of all things. You’re allowed to laugh. It’s funny.”</p><p>But Rio, mouth open in disbelief, didn’t laugh. Even though Agatha was right that it was absolutely comical. Just not for the reasons she thought.</p><p>It was comical because it should be <em> Rio </em> having these anxieties; how if anyone was using anyone else, it was Rio taking advantage of <em> her. </em>Because every time Agatha pressed a light, almost tender kiss to her head, her shoulder—she got to pretend for a moment that in Agatha’s mind she was doing it because she loved Rio. Wanted her beyond the confines of friendship or sex.</p><p>But she wasn’t about to say that. She was too selfish; she was enjoying this too much. It couldn’t end so quickly. She felt like a child trying to save a snowman from melting in the rain.</p><p>She rose to a sitting position to match the other woman. She took Agatha’s hand and squeezed it tightly. </p><p>“I want this, Agatha.”</p><p>She hoped that was enough. She didn’t trust herself to expand on the point. Agatha, after all, had always been the talker between them; unlike Rio, who had been mute for years as a child.</p><p>Her parents had to bribe her to speak by offering her favorite meals for dinner, or promising her extra time to play after the field work. Omission had always been how she protected herself.</p><p>Agatha frowned, her eyes imploring. “But how do you know if it’s what you <em> really </em> want, deep down? If you didn’t want it before?”</p><p>And now, of course, because this was Agatha, (The Inquisitor, the Detective, the Relentless Asker of Questions) they were debating the nature and ethics of desire when Rio would much rather have Agatha’s fingers knuckle-deep inside of her.</p><p>Rio once again takes a note from Agatha’s playbook. “Well, did you want <em> me </em> before this?”</p><p>And if Rio had been any other person, she wouldn’t have noticed the brief panic that struck Agatha’s expression. Because Agatha doesn’t show panic like a normal person. It was a minute change of expression—her lip twitched, and the tips of her ears went bright red. But the rest of her was stock still. Even her hand, which Rio was still holding gingerly, didn’t move an inch.</p><p>She swallowed, then licked her lips. “Occasionally,” she said, as impassively as one could say anything. But the information immediately pummeled Rio like boxing gloves.</p><p>Rio’s cheeks were heated and she couldn’t help herself but ask, “When?”</p><p>Agatha looked down to study her nails, treating this turn of discussion as if it was the most boring thing in the world. Which Rio knew it was <em> obviously </em> not. “When? I don’t know. A handful of times. It’s not like I wrote a journal about it.” She lowered her voice mockingly. “Dear Diary, today I was besotted with the desire to fuck the living daylights out of my roommate…”</p><p>Rio let out a sigh that was both exasperated and needy. “<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>Agatha’s expression twitched into a scowl. And suddenly Rio’s wrists were up in the air—Agatha had grabbed both of them—and in the next blink she was being thrown down on the bed, and Agatha was straddling her from above, breathing heavily, her lips levitating inches from Rio’s face. Her fangs had flashed out of her in a moment’s notice.</p><p>“Fuck it. Fine. You want me to fuck you, is that it?” Agatha asked again, raggedly. “You won’t stop thinking about it until you’ve come around my fingers?”</p><p>Seeing Agatha’s teeth, the red in her eyes, Rio descended back into another mindspace completely, every other thought in her head shot with a gun. “So much,” she whined back.</p><p>“Tell me how much. Tell me what you want.”</p><p>Rio could tell from Agatha’s expression, thoughtful and frowning, that she wasn’t asking for the sake of it. She needed to hear it. That she wouldn’t be able to keep going otherwise.</p><p> Rio was more than happy to oblige. She closed her eyes, and imagined everything she’d been keeping in a tight lockbox in her head, letting it loose like Pandora’s Box. “I want…” She moaned. Agatha rewarded her by sliding her fingers back down to her underwear. “I want you to bite me while you fuck me. I want to—ah—I want to come while you’re drinking from me.”</p><p>“Oh god, Rio.” Agatha looked like she could cry just at the idea of it. </p><p>Rio processed this with a blink. <em> She really likes it when I talk. </em></p><p>Agatha bit down hard on her own lip, and looked toward Rio’s neck, towards the wound they kept re-opening. But there was still a shadow of uncertainty there.</p><p>Deciding in an instant, Rio took Agatha’s chin with her hand.</p><p>“Agatha,” she commanded with a whine. “Start touching me right now, and I’ll keep talking, okay? I’ll tell you everything I want. Can you do that for me?”</p><p>She had no idea what possessed her to speak like that, but the way Agatha’s eyes immediately darkened to two black marbles, her mouth opening, her eyebrows lifting, spurred her on. Agatha nodded slowly, obediently, and like magic, her fingers began to work against Rio’s clit, drawing perfect circles that made her nearly come undone in an instant.</p><p>“‘S that okay?” Agatha mumbled, searching her eyes for approval.</p><p>Taking in her suddenly small, nervous expression, Rio was overcome with an amount of adoration for her that she couldn’t contain. She took both her hands and cupped Agatha’s face, kissing her tenderly on the lips before whispering. “It feels—ugh—perfect. <em> You’re </em> perfect.”</p><p>She saw Agatha’s cheeks light up pink, her eyebrows raise, and it just made Rio’s heart ache even more. <em> Has anyone ever told her that before? </em>It occurred to Rio then that the only partners Agatha ever had were humans—short-lived, single day dalliances—and even if they did make Agatha feel good, it’s not like she could ever earnestly believe the praise they’d laud on her.</p><p>Rio was in a unique position that she’d known Agatha for almost half her life. Her words meant something different to her. They carried a weight.</p><p>
<em> I need her to know. </em>
</p><p>She kissed Agatha again softly on the mouth. “You are so perfect.”</p><p>Rio meant it. She was<em> afraid </em> of just how much she meant it. But she could say it under the guise of sex, use the plausible deniability that it was just something that jumped out of her under the influence. That’s what she’d do, she decided. She could say whatever she wanted to, because this was another world—and if Agatha asked about it later, she’d just wave her hands.</p><p>Agatha pushed a finger into her, and Rio moaned obscenely.</p><p>As she began to pump into her with a rhythm, Rio kissed Agatha again, and Agatha whimpered into it, almost as if fucking Rio was doing more to her than the other way around.  An idea that was confirmed by the way Agatha had begun to rut into her; Rio raised her thigh to give her something to attach to, and Agatha immediately moaned.</p><p>Rio dragged her fingers through Agatha’s hair possessively. “Ready to go again so soon?”</p><p>“Just— keep talking,” Agatha whined, arching into Rio.</p><p>Rio didn’t think anything could turn her on more than the small, neediness in Agatha’s voice when she asked her that. She could do nothing but oblige as she rode Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever been this turned on in my life,” Rio confessed, and Agatha blinked down at her like it was a revelation from God. “It’s almost terrifying. Like, I’ve been horny before, but it’s always felt like — like this <em> chore </em> I need to take care of. Like cleaning. Doing the dishes. But fuck, Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha moaned, and slotted another finger into her. Rio nearly saw white.</p><p>“And now?” Agatha asked, biting down on her lip. “How does it feel now?”</p><p>She cupped Agatha’s cheek as she rolled her hips down and moaned. “It feels like I need you to fuck me every day of my life. I wish I was joking. I’m — I’m not. I always knew vampires were supposed to have — high libidos. <em> Insatiability is a hallmark of the species </em>. But I didn’t understand it until now. I think I might have to – I might have to beg at your door every morning for you to come deal with me, or else I’ll— I’ll…”</p><p>“Oh fuck, <em> I can’t take it, </em>” Agatha cried, and plunged her fangs into Rio’s neck.</p><p>And Rio hadn’t been joking about that, either. There was no pleasure on Earth or in Heaven like the feeling of all of it at once—of Agatha’s mouth on her neck, her fingers deep inside of her, thrusting over and over, almost helpless, of every part of them connected—except one.</p><p>Rio wanted to bite her back, too.</p><p>And she almost did it, almost pressed her teeth down into Agatha’s neck, only the moment she thought to, her orgasm pushed her over the cliff and shoved her aside. Tears, wet and salty pressed to Agatha’s shoulder as she let out a whine, coming desperately on Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“F—fuck, I came,” Rio said, so Agatha could slow down her fingers.</p><p>But the other woman didn’t hear her. She was arching helplessly on Rio’s thigh, and Rio quickly moved her own hand to touch Agatha under her dress—<em> how had they still not taken their clothes off? </em>—and felt her arousal build again, almost instantly when she felt how wet she was.</p><p>Rio used her other hand to thread her fingers through Agatha’s hair, pressing her down into her neck and sighing. “Come for me, baby,” she said softly. “Please. Baby. I need you to come for me. I need to feel you come all over my hand again like before. Please—”</p><p>Agatha whined so loud Rio was surprised the Airbnb’s windows didn’t shatter, the vampire coming with such an urgency that she took an entire <em> bite </em> out of Rio’s shoulder as wetness sprayed around Rio’s fingers. Rio hissed, the pain electric and terrible. But it faded almost immediately when Agatha drew back and she saw the look on her face—terrified, helpless.</p><p>“Oh god, Rio, I’m so sorry. I–”</p><p>Rio leaned forward and captured her lips, the blood intermingling between them.</p><p>There was no hesitance when she pleaded, “Fuck me again.”</p>

<p>Rio wanted to go all night. She wanted to go all morning to, and into the next day, and the next, but in reality, about twenty five minutes after she begged Agatha to fuck her again, the two of them were absolutely exhausted. Not from lack of libido—Rio was making up for six hundred years of unspent horniness—but from, predictably (to anyone except them), blood loss.</p><p>She started seeing little black dots at the edge of her vision, and she squeezed Agatha’s shoulder, mumbling a “<em>think I’m going to pass out </em>” before falling like a ragdoll onto the mattress, and waking up five minutes later with a very worried vampire doting over her, carrying a gauntlet’s worth of blood in a red solo cup. </p><p>Apparently, their dishwasher broke during the five minutes that Rio was unconscious.</p><p>Rio rolled onto her back, accepted the cup, and failed to care when the blood dribbled from her mouth onto the sheets. They were ruined anyway, and she didn’t have the arm strength to hold it up much higher. She probably looked like an old lady on her deathbed. <em> How sexy. </em></p><p>“How’d the dishwasher break?” Rio slurred, looking up at Agatha, who was staring at her with intense and terribly endearing worry. It made her heart ache.</p><p>Agatha looked away evasively. “I got in a fight with it.”</p><p>“You got in a fight with a dishwasher?”</p><p>Agatha frowned, crossing her arms. “It was insisting on keeping all of the cups hostage while you were bleeding out on the mattress. Sue me for putting your safety above the sanctity of our security deposit.”</p><p>Rio smiled like a fool. How romantic.</p><p>“We don’t have a security deposit, Agatha. This is an Airbnb.”</p><p>She could hear Agatha pick at her phone. “Cleaning fee then?”</p><p>“Pretty sure cleaning is different than <em> breaking</em>. I heard glass shatter.”</p><p>The closet door creaked open, and Rio heard hangers scrape against wood. What was she up to? Wincing, Rio turned onto her stomach, and the world momentarily spun. </p><p>Her disorientation must have been obvious on her face, because Agatha was suddenly on her again, kneeling at the edge of the bed, frowning. The vampire lifted her hand, then pushed it across the top of Rio’s scalp, threading her fingers between loose black hairs.</p><p>Rio immediately became self conscious of how sweaty and matted it must have been—but Agatha didn’t seem to care. She just scratched across her head like a child raking a pile of leaves, soft and reverent.</p><p>It was so achingly sweet - and it made Rio want to say something dangerous.</p><p>“Thank you for always taking care of me,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha blinked several times, as if Rio had sprayed her with a light dusting of water. Her nose scrunched, and she did that thing where she opened her mouth, just slightly, then closed it. </p><p>“I mean.” Agatha’s hand unconsciously gripped tighter to Rio’s hair. “I haven’t had many friends in my life – they tend to die prematurely in the acquaintance stage, through no fault of my own – but I’ve heard it’s one of the basic tenets of the whole agreement.”</p><p>Rio tried her best not to look like she’d been kicked when the word <em> friends </em> fell out of Agatha’s mouth. But she must have done a shit job at it, because Agatha’s frown deepened.</p><p>“And it helps that you’re easy to take care of,” she continued. “Like a cactus.”</p><p>Rio snorted, and the heaviness in her heart lifted just a bit. Although <em> friends </em> still felt like a knife that had been left to lodge. “That’s really the plant you associate me with?”</p><p>The levity in her voice freed Agatha’s fingers again, and they began to itch against Rio’s skull pleasantly. She glanced down at Rio’s lips, seemingly considering something. Something that looked a lot like <em> Should I kiss her? </em> Which really did not match well with the knife that was <em> friends</em>, but why was Rio expecting consistency out of the most reliably inconsistent person on the planet?</p><p>Growing frustrated and increasingly anemic, Rio made the decision for her, pushing forward and capturing Agatha’s lips in a quick, searing kiss. A kiss to make a point. <em> What </em>point, she had no clue, but Agatha gasped when Rio pulled back, and her eyebrows arched dramatically.</p><p>Agatha lifted her free hand to her mouth, touching her fingers to her lips.</p><p>“What was that for?” she whispered, sounding stunned.</p><p>As if they hadn’t kissed each other incessantly for the last two hours.</p><p>Rio frowned.</p><p>
<em> Because I wanted to.  </em>
</p><p>No, not quite—</p><p>
<em> Because I think I might be in love with you, and I don’t know what that means, it’s my first time at all of this, so I’m scratching like a dog at the door trying to make you understand. </em>
</p><p>Rio took the coward’s route instead.</p><p>“ ‘Hungry. There was some leftover blood on your lips. Couldn’t resist.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her like she was a liar. She was.</p><p>But for the first time, perhaps ever, she didn’t push it. She just laughed, shook her head, and returned to the closet, where she pulled out a set of clothes. They landed on top of Rio’s body a moment later: Agatha’s old Beetlejuice t-shirt, and black sweatpants.</p><p>“You’ll look good in these,” she said with a vacant edge to her voice, and then she was heading for the door, an urgency in her step. “I’m going to take a shower.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>It quickly became obvious that Agatha was not, in a word, <em> alright. </em></p><p>First off, the shower became more of a marathon of wasting the Airbnb's hot water supply. It went on for at least an hour and a half—all of Lemonade played, and then looped—before Agatha stepped out in a steam cloud, avoided Rio’s gaze completely, then trapped herself inside her bedroom to change. Which, Rio could admit Agatha took her time with her outfits, but forty minutes of opening and closing drawers was getting pathological.</p><p>“Agatha. Are you… good?”</p><p>Rio had rapped at her door several times, even tried the handle, but it was locked. She couldn’t remember the last time Agatha had locked a door. Maybe the sixteenth century.</p><p>“Dandy,” came a sharp reply from the other side when Rio knocked again.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>There was no reply for a moment. When Rio tried the handle again, Agatha sighed heavily.</p><p>“I’m busy.”</p><p>Rio laughed incredulously. “Busy? Busy with <em> what? </em>”</p><p>Another pause. Then footsteps thundered towards the door, and it whisked open. Agatha leaned out with her damp, beautiful hair hanging around her toweled body. In those forty minutes, she’d somehow failed to put a single item of clothing on.</p><p>“You might not realize this, but one of us has to actually <em> plan </em> the thrall scheme,” she said coldly. “The funeral is in two days, and events do not crash themselves. Also, our bank account is in the red. And – I just checked the application, app, whatever the fuck – and apparently we’ve overstayed in the Airbnb and they’re coming by tomorrow from out of town to kick us out.”</p><p>Rio’s mind reeled at that tornado of information. But mostly, it reeled at the sharpness in Agatha’s voice. Agatha was rude, and callous, and crass, but she was rarely <em> cold. </em> This was Agatha with her hackles up, a cat one wrong move away from scratching up your arm.</p><p>Rio had no problem with Agatha scratching up her arm, or her hands, or her legs—Agatha could destroy every inch of her, if she so wanted to—so in absence of a survival instinct, Rio furrowed her brow and said, “Why are you acting like this?”</p><p>Agatha scowled. “Acting like what? I’m not acting like anything.”</p><p>“Yes you are. You’re acting like a bitch,” Rio laughed hoarsely. “Which is a bit concerning to me, given that we just had – well – <em> sex </em> for the first time in six hundred years, and your response to it is apparently to flee to the shower, and then lock yourself up in your room, and now you’re yelling at me about things we both know neither of us care about.”</p><p>She could see Agatha partially deflate, called out so thoroughly, her scowl dipping into a more modest angry frown. But this was still Agatha, so she wasn’t going to flip over on her belly without a fight first.</p><p>“I’m being a bitch because I care about us being <em> homeless </em> tomorrow?”</p><p>“As if we wouldn’t just Suggest our way into some idiot’s living room for the night.”</p><p>“That doesn’t resolve the funeral problem. I need a plan. We need a plan.”</p><p>“Agatha. I—” Rio pinched her nose, and breathed out. <em> Get it together. </em> “You already <em> have </em> a plan. You came up with it the minute you saw Tommy dead on the floor. Also –” She raised her eyebrows commandingly when Agatha moved to interrupt. “– You’ve talked my <em> ear off </em> about it all of yesterday. We show up at the gates without an invitation. Pretend to be some rich, connected, oligarch-money lesbian couple from Bucharest who forgot it in the mail. I kill Wanda, you hunt down Ashcroft. The end. My memory might be bad, but it’s not dementia bad.”</p><p>“No I– That’s not–” Agatha spluttered. “Fuck. Well I need to <em> revise </em> that plan.”</p><p>Rio propped a hand on her hip and laughed coldly. “Liar.”</p><p>Agatha’s face was growing red. Her fingers were twitching by her sides, and she looked like she wanted to grab Rio and throw her against something. Not that Rio would complain.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha growled. “Fine.”</p><p>She violently turned away and paraded into her room, throwing her phone onto the mattress before sitting on it and burying her head in her hands. She stroked through her own hair and sighed dramatically. When Rio didn’t immediately come in, she looked up at her and scowled.</p><p>“What is this, eleventh century vampirism? Do I need to invite you in or do you know how to use a door without me walking you through it first?”</p><p>Rio ignored her rudeness, and stepped through the precipice. She got a sense that Agatha would probably jump like a startled cat if she sat next to her on the bed, so she lifted Agatha’s CD collection—exclusively Fleetwood Mac albums—off a nearby stool, and then dragged it to face her.</p><p>“Agatha,” she mumbled quietly, kindly, as she sat on the stool. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>It took Agatha several seconds before she lifted her head from her hands.</p><p>And when she did, the fury had been wiped from her expression. What was left was quieter—more tired, exhausted. Her lip bitten under her mouth, she sighed again.</p><p>“God, I’m really not good at this,” Agatha groaned. “Worse than I expected, actually. Which is saying something.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrowed. “Good at what?”</p><p>Agatha grinded her teeth together. She picked up her phone again, and picked at it mindlessly, to Rio’s annoyance.</p><p>“Maybe we can Suggest the Airbnb owners into letting us stay longer once they get here,” she mumbled, still looking down. “It’d be easier than finding a new place to sleep. And I don’t want you to have to haul my DVDs overnight. I’d hate it if anything were to happen to them.”</p><p>Rio stared at Agatha, her nostrils flaring with frustration.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said, clasping her hand over the phone. “Good at <em> what? </em>”</p><p>Agatha ignored the fact that Rio’s hand was covering half her screen and continued to scroll through—was that Twitter?—She was fully looking at <em> memes </em>right now. Rio was trying to have a serious discussion with her, and she was looking at—</p><p>Rio popped the phone out of Agatha’s hand and squinted. “ADHD memes for… neurodivergent queens?” She huffed in complete disbelief. “Agatha, what the fuck does that even mean?” </p><p>Rio was deeply behind when it came to twenty-first century vernacular. </p><p>Agatha grimaced, and didn’t respond. “Give that back.”</p><p>“Talk to me, and then you can have it back.”</p><p>“You sure? This didn’t go well the first time you did it.”</p><p>They stared at each other petulantly, and Agatha’s words sent Rio in a tailspin toward that very memory—the first time Agatha bit her. No matter how many times she revisited it, she still didn’t understand why it had happened. What had spurred Agatha to do that. Her explanation looked more and more unconvincing as time went on, held up to the harsh mirror of hindsight.</p><p>Rio didn’t want a repeat of that. She didn’t want them to fight, or bite, or even kiss, until she understood what was happening. She was so exhausted by the ambiguity, by the largeness of her own emotions, by the utter opaqueness of Agatha’s. She cared about the other woman too much, as a friend—as more than a friend, it didn’t matter—to understand her so little.</p><p>She set down the phone on Agatha’s lap, and Agatha’s eyebrows rose.</p><p>“You win. You can have it back.”</p><p>“That easy?” Agatha pouted, as if she had been <em> excited </em> about the potential of a fight.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath. She was starting to get overwhelmed. All the worst scenarios spun like yarn around her brain. All the creeping thoughts she’d shoved down and buried.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio put a hand on Agatha’s leg, and looked up at her imploringly. “If you regret sleeping with me, you can just tell me. I’m a big girl. I can take it.”</p><p><em> Not really, </em> Rio thought when she felt her chest constrict at the thought. <em> But I’ll survive it if it means keeping you </em>.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up at that. She gave her a look of disbelief.</p><p>“Regret? Sleeping — <em> what </em>?” Agatha breathed.</p><p>Rio’s frown deepened. Something had obviously struck a chord. “Look, we were drunk, and high, and this whole biting thing—it’s been a lot for both our systems. Physically, emotionally. But we’ve been friends for so long, almost six mortal lifetimes, and I— I don’t want to jeopardize that. I mean, I don’t think I could ever find a person who tolerates me the way you do, frankly. Who doesn’t get scared away when they see the—” Rio gestured vaguely toward Tommy’s limb dismemberment. “—who doesn’t find it annoying when I get all stupid and superstitious about stepping on a crack in the pavement, or killing in uneven numbers.” She breathed in shakily. “You are the only person who makes me feel… sane, Agatha.”</p><p>When Agatha said nothing, she continued, “So if the price I have to pay for keeping that is that I have to sit around with my newly discovered libido, well. That’s fine. I’ll finally have to learn how a vibrator works, probably. But I’ve conquered larger problems in my life.”</p><p>But Agatha just stared, and stared, mouth hanging open. Her cheeks tinted lightly pink.</p><p>Feeling more self-conscious by the second, Rio tried to rescind her hand, but Agatha held it in a vice grip. Unyielding. </p><p>Rio gave her a confused look, but Agatha just clenched her jaw harder, teeth grinding down on eachother. As if she was pressurizing a sentence so it wouldn’t pop out of her throat unprovoked. Then—stranger yet—Agatha’s eyes flared red, then back to green.</p><p><em> What are you fighting so hard? </em>Rio wanted desperately to ask. But she didn’t.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha opened her mouth, and said quietly, “I don’t just <em> tolerate </em> you. I can’t believe you’d ever think that.”</p><p>Rio’s heart swooped in her chest. </p><p>But it stung, too, because she was once again ignoring the point.</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>“Be quiet. I mean it. Or I’m not going to be able to get this out.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, shutting her mouth in an instant when she saw the intensity in Agatha’s gaze. Her grip on Rio’s hand only grew tighter, and she inhaled and closed her eyes.</p><p>“I know I’m beyond shitty at talking about my emotions,” Agatha said, then laughed coldly. “Okay. Even that is an un understatement. I’m catastrophic at it. But when you grow up the way I did—like some <em>thing </em>whose sole purpose is to make small talk with politicians, and hand out blood-sausage sandwiches, and then go sit in the corner when it’s no longer needed—it becomes really easy to dissociate from your own body. And god, I have so much fucking trouble deciphering between what is actually a <em> feeling, </em>a real one, and something that I think I’m <em> supposed </em> to feel.”</p><p>Agatha’s nails were pressing so hard into Rio’s hand that they were drawing blood. But Rio didn’t even notice. She was hanging off of Agatha’s every word. She was ready to go back in time and kill Evanora twice more. Hang her from the cliffs of Salzburg.</p><p>“I know I’ve never told you this. Because I’m <em> me</em>.” Agatha sighed, and Rio felt like her entire life paused for a moment, like the wheels of time screeched to a halt. “But it’s something I should have, a long time ago. You mean the—” She inhaled shakily, and groaned. “God. This sounds so stupidly cheesy. I’m really not made for this. But you mean the fucking <em> world </em> to me, you idiot. You saved me. You <em> saved me. </em>You don’t understand how ungrateful I feel everyday knowing that. Like I’ll never be able to repay that kind of debt. I almost hate you for it.”</p><p>Agatha brought Rio’s hand up to her mouth, and kissed it gently, soft tears pressing into Rio’s skin. Agatha gave her a look that was so deep, so meaningful, so <em> raw,</em> that it speared Rio right through the chest, her lungs constricting.</p><p>“I don’t tolerate you,” Agatha said, when her lips left Rio’s hand. “I cherish you.”</p><p>She dropped the hand gently in her lap.</p><p>“And I very much enjoyed having sex with you.”</p><p>The swift topic change nearly knocked the wind out of Rio’s chest.</p><p>“But if we’re going to do this,” Agatha said, in the same blase tone as if they were going into business together. Opening up a cafe, a coffee shop. “I realized earlier—when I was being a bitch, yes, guilty—that I can’t be as laissez faire as I am with… mortals. We’re going to have to set some ground rules. Because with two vampires, things can get frisky with Eternity real quick.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened, then closed. She was still reeling from Agatha’s confession. From the joy and the anguish of hearing just how much she <em> cared </em>. “...Ground rules?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, then laughed. “God, I can’t believe myself. <em> I’m </em> the one doing this. Setting <em> boundaries.</em> This is actually disgusting. I want this to end as soon as possible. But yes. I’ll make it quick. One, we can’t drink from each other at the same time. That’ll activate that whole—” She waved her hands around, and Rio got the message. <em> Eternal Vampire Marriage.</em> “—so that’s a <em> no go, </em>unfortunately. Sexy as it would be.”</p><p>Rio let her chest unwind. So this whole thing was just Agatha being typical Agatha, then. Her annoyance earlier had been about the fact that she was going to actually abide by some sort of <em> rule. </em> Like a child having a tantrum during a board game. And here Rio thought—</p><p>“And two, I think we should avoid kissing each other outside of sex.”</p><p>Rio’s heart dropped a hundred floors. Splattered in the basement.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, studying her nails again, mouth in a straight, disciplined line. She didn’t seem to notice the way Rio’s entire soul had just crumpled into a little paper ball. </p><p>“It just keeps the lines clearer that way.”</p><p>Rio said nothing for a long time, and when Agatha looked up at her in confusion, Rio slowly nodded, like a zombie.</p><p>“Right. The lines. Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a half-smile. It didn’t seem to reach her eyes.</p><p>“Any other… rules?” Rio asked breathlessly.</p><p>
<em> Just breathe. Just breathe. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She still wants you. In some way, she wants you. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She loves you, in some way. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Maybe not the same way. It doesn’t have to be the same way. </em>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip down in thought. “Fuck it, I don’t think so. Oh, maybe tell me if you’re going to sleep with someone else, so I can kill them in advance to clear your schedule for me instead.” She looked down at herself then, as if she’d just realized she was still in a towel. “Oh. Gross. My poor skin. I’m going to be as wrinkled as Evanora’s rotting corpse.”</p><p>Agatha stood then, then gave Rio an expectant expression. They’d seen each other naked hundreds of times before, but somehow, it felt strange now. </p><p>Like something free had become forbidden.</p><p>“Oh. Oh,” Rio sputtered, rising to her feet slowly. “Sure, yeah. I’ll uh—see you in the living room.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a grand grin, fangs exposed.</p><p>“Make us some coffee, and I’ll grab my Gilmore Girls DVD?”</p><p>And for all the horrible turmoil in Rio’s chest, for all the ways she wanted to leave the apartment and stalk the streets of New York City like an injured, limping dog, she could feel nothing else but an aching softness when Agatha looked at her like that. Like there was nothing else she’d rather do than curl up on the couch with her.</p><p>So, instead of running away, Rio joked, “Coffee? It’s three AM.”</p><p>“And we’re a thousand years old and still haven’t figured out a proper sleep schedule.” Agatha disappeared behind her closet. “Which season do you want to watch?”</p><p>“Anything but season five.”</p><p>“Of course. We hate when they fight.”</p><p>“We do. They’re not meant to.”</p><p>“No. No, they’re not.”</p><p>With that, the door shut softly behind Rio.</p><p>She caught a glimpse of her reflection in the television screen. She looked… normal, to her surprise. Much more normal than she felt inside.</p><p>
<em> Maybe this can work. </em>
</p><p>She let herself feel a flicker of hope.</p><p>Maybe this was enough.</p><p>Forcing herself to believe that, because she had no other choice—</p><p>She went to make coffee.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Just as they said they would, the Airbnb owners—a rich, bohemian gay couple named Andrew and Tony—arrived the next day in the afternoon.</p><p>They must have knocked a hundred times before they finally let themselves in, and were promptly startled to find their rented apartment in potentially the most egregious shape they’d ever seen since beginning their journey as hosts. </p><p>It wasn’t that it was messy, exactly—but more so that it had been completely renovated, redecorated, and refurbished. New drapes had been installed, over a dozen large potted plants distributed around the place, like some kind of Rainforest Cafe. </p><p>If you squinted hard enough, you could see that all of Tony and Andrew’s original furniture was still there, kind of—the faux-leather couch, the mahogany kitchen table—but that it had either been covered in an insane amount of blankets and tapestries—all colored purple—or pushed into a corner to make room for a more expensive looking variation of the same thing.</p><p>Practically, it was horrific. They would be fining their guests into oblivion. But aesthetically, Tony would admit, it was deeply impressive. If their guests hadn’t become, well, <em> squatters</em>, Tony might have asked if they would be interested in doing the interior decoration on their next place. They surely had the eye for it.</p><p>
<em> Maybe with a tad less purple. </em>
</p><p>“Hello?” he shouted, when the guests failed to greet them. “Ms. Garcia?”</p><p>They’d left the key under the mat earlier that month, so they’d never actually <em> met </em> the guests. Something that didn’t seem like a bad idea at the start, since Rio Garcia had quite favorable reviews on Airbnb—five stars, somehow, which very few tenants have.</p><p>All they knew was that Ms. Garcia was a friendly-looking, tan-skinned woman who worked, apparently, at the local blood donation center. And that she wore a “I like plants more than people” t-shirt in her profile. </p><p>“All green flags,” Andrew had said. Tony had agreed. </p><p>But only after several minutes of knocking and shouting at the bedroom door did one of the squatters reveal themselves, a woman who was notably <em> not </em> Rio Garcia, but someone Rio had mentioned off-handedly in her application as her apparent “live-in business associate.”</p><p>It was a very strange way to describe someone, but Andrew wasn’t in the business of questioning people’s lifestyles. So he’d let his eyes skim over it.</p><p>But now he was wishing he’d been a bit more judgmental.</p><p>“What do you want?” the live-in business associate drawled, looking displeased to see them, as if <em> she </em> was not the one illegally overstaying in their residence. The woman was wearing nothing but a robe, nearly naked, her eyes lidded like she’d just been woken up from deep sleep. </p><p>But it was already three o’ clock in the afternoon. </p><p>Andrew looked anxiously at Tony. Neither of them were confrontational people. Occasionally they’d gotten into a dispute with a guest, but it was usually over a cleaning fee, not their right to <em> stay in the building permanently. </em></p><p>“Didn’t you get our messages?” Andrew said, trying to sound assertive, but mostly failing. The woman, even half-asleep, was very intimidating. “We’re here to get the keys back. And, er, you need to leave.” He peered into the room, and saw that it had <em> also </em> been entirely redecorated. <em> Was that a gigantic DVD collection? </em> “And all your stuff needs to leave. too.”</p><p>The woman blinked at him a few times, then groaned.</p><p>“This room’s closed. Try the other one.”</p><p>And then she slammed the door in their faces.</p><p>Andrew looked at Tony in disbelief. “<em>Do something</em>,” he whispered.</p><p>“What am I going to do?” Tony whisper-shouted back. “We should just call the police.”</p><p>“I don’t want to call the police.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t want two random women living in our apartment until the <em> end of time. </em>”</p><p>They stared at each other for a long minute before they both deflated.</p><p>“Let’s just try the second room.”</p><p>So, with a great amount of humiliation, they dragged themselves across the apartment to the other bedroom. Luckily, Rio Garcia was already walking out of the door. She looked absolutely exhausted, her hair in a bird’s nest of a bun, but unlike her <em> business partner, </em> who had barely blinked at their existence, she startled like a bunny, her eyes going wide.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said, chewing her lip nervously as she kept her eyes pinned on them. “There are random men in our apartment.”</p><p>Tony laughed incredulously. “<em>Random men</em>—ma’am, we <em> own </em> this apartment.”</p><p>The other woman shouted from inside her still-closed bedroom, “Ugh, Rio, I <em> told </em> you they were coming, remember? Just do your—your <em> thing. </em>I’m choosing my funeral outfit. Actually, speaking of—dress or suit?”</p><p>A light pink sprouted on Rio’s cheeks, and she bit her lip.</p><p>“Suit,” she said eventually.</p><p>The other woman cackled. “I knew you would. You like me in one, don’t you?”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks got even redder, her throat bobbing, and she looked at Andrew and Tony with an expression that said <em> god help me. </em></p><p>Tony was baffled.</p><p>They were going to a funeral? What? And—weren’t they business partners? Why were they flirting? Also, was that blood on the floor of Rio’s room? Yes, that was a giant bloodstain. Several giant blood stains. He was starting to go insane. These people were making him insane. He started getting the uncanny six sense that you develop growing up in NYC that told him someone crazy was about to try and kill him.</p><p>He grabbed his boyfriend’s hand. “Andrew, I think we should leave.”</p><p>Andrew spluttered, “What? But they’re still—”</p><p>“We’re leaving.” He headed for the door. “Bye girls! Have a good time at the funeral!”</p><p>“Thank you!” the one named Agatha sing-song’d from her room.</p><p>Once the door to the apartment was firmly shut behind them, Tony dragged a hand across his face, groaned, then turned to Andrew, dropping his voice into a whisper.</p><p>“You win. We’re talking to the police.” Andrew geared up to say <em> I told you so</em>, but Tony cut him off with, “I think they might have murdered someone in our bed.”</p><p>Andrew’s smile dropped.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>“Wow,” Agatha said, genuinely impressed as she waltzed into the living room, and noted the absence of two extremely nervous homosexuals. “You’re getting really good at Suggestion.”</p><p>Rio glanced up at her from the couch, which she was splayed over, one leg on the armrest, the other dragging onto the floor. She had her own suit on, a blazing white to match Agatha’s dark blue. When she looked up and saw the other woman in her outfit, gorgeous curls cascading over an open-breasted blazer, it took everything inside her not to push her up against the wall and kiss the daylights out of her.</p><p>Unfortunately, besides Agatha’s stupid <em> rule</em>, they had bigger problems. So she refrained.</p><p>“I didn’t get a chance to use Suggestion,” Rio said, pressing her lips together in a straight line. “So they’re probably pissing themselves halfway to the Brooklyn police station. Well, not <em> probably.</em> They are. I heard them talking about it in the hallway.”</p><p>Agatha looked her up and down—which, <em> oh </em>—then licked across her lips.</p><p>“Hm,” she said. “That’s not great.”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Wanna chase them and see who gets there first? Like old times?”</p><p>Rio barked out a laugh. “You’re a <em> child. </em>”</p><p>“Is that a no?”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip. Considered it.</p><p>“Should we take our clothes off first?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a particularly animalistic grin. Rio grimaced at her own choice of words.</p><p>“I mean—like—should we change back into our regular clothes?” she corrected.</p><p>Agatha shrugged, heading for the window, and unlatching it.</p><p>“If you want to lose, sure.” She stuck her leg out the window and onto the fire escape, then her head, and the roaring gusts blew her gorgeous curls into a frenzy. Still, she gave Rio a shit-eating grin through the fogged-up glass. “Time starts—oh, well, <em> now.</em>”</p><p>Rio clambered off the couch. “Agatha, what the fuck are you—”</p><p>By the time she reached the window, the other vampire was already mid-air. Agatha had jumped from the railing of the fire escape, soared ten feet, and then landed on the roof of a building, walking leisurely on the parapets. In <em> heels </em>.</p><p>“Oh my god.”</p><p>She was in love with an idiot.</p><p>A very sexy, powerful idiot.</p><p>She shook her head, then sighed, stepping out into the wind. “Game fucking on.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha! Slow down, you cheater!” </p><p>Agatha cackled in the distance. “No chance in hell, baby!”</p><p>It had been ten minutes of an all-out marathon, and Rio was so focused on not falling that she couldn’t even enjoy the pet name falling so easily off Agatha’s lips. </p><p>With a grunt, she lurched off another rooftop, landing clumsily on the next before breaking out in a full sprint again—dodging exposed piping, tripping over uneven brick. </p><p>The wind whipped her hair and the full brunt of the dusking sun bore down on her painfully, but she didn’t care. She hadn’t felt adrenaline like this since they were kids. </p><p>Twenty years old and haunting the streets of London like a couple of goons, chasing men in the middle of night and making them leap into the river.</p><p>Sometimes you get old and you forget you can still be as free as you were at nineteen. </p><p>With a small, nostalgic smile on her face, she continued to run—and watched as the silhouette of the police station began to rise through the fog. </p><p>Agatha had a couple dozen meters on her still—she’d gotten a hell of a head start—but Rio was faster. She’d just have to keep her eyes on the prize, and…</p><p>Agatha dropped out of view.</p><p>Rio’s heels rocked on the edge of the building, coming to a sudden halt as she looked down. And there Agatha was, holding onto the side of the building with nothing but her fingernails, her eyes wide and terrified, her arms trembling. There had to be a three hundred foot drop below her. Just cold, hard, pavement.</p><p>“Rio,” she whimpered. “Help me.”</p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha, here, take my—”</p><p>Rio reached down in an instant, but the moment she took Agatha’s arms, the woman’s entire demeanor changed. She grinned wide and sinister. Her eyes blazed bright red.</p><p>“Thanks for the help. <em> You’re going to stay right here and watch me win. </em>”</p><p>The Suggestion tore through Rio like a razor. Her arms stilled, and Agatha hopped down, letting herself fall—her feet hitting what sounded like metal only seconds later. </p><p><em> There had been a fire escape below her the whole time. </em> </p><p>“You absolute asshole,” Rio mumbled, unable to move the rest of her body.</p><p>Agatha giggled, and blew a kiss up at her. “Takes one to know one.”</p><p>And Rio just watched as Agatha began to climb down. Her muscles twitched furiously, wanting to move, but unable to. She knew this was checkmate.</p><p>Except, seconds later, her eyes cleared. She could move again.</p><p>
<em> What the fuck? </em>
</p><p>She blinked down at herself. Agatha’s Suggestion usually put her in a stupor for hours. </p><p>Not mere <em> seconds.</em> </p><p>
<em> So it hadn’t been a fluke with Tommy. </em>
</p><p>Rio had slowly started to suspect that Agatha had been forcing Rio to do all their Suggesting as some sort of game—something to push Rio out of her comfort zone, as Agatha loved to do—but that illusion burst into flames as she looked down at her hands, flexing freely in the air. Agatha’s powers had genuinely faltered.</p><p>There was something <em> wrong </em> with her.</p><p>Rio frowned deeply at the thought. But when she spotted Agatha walking so casually, so <em> cockily </em> towards the police station, heels clicking, hair swooshing, she found that the worry in her chest was quickly suppressed in favor of another feeling.</p><p>Schadenfreude.</p><p>Rio grinned, and took an unconventional path down the other side of the building. She flanked where Agatha was walking, staying out of sight, before reappearing right in front of the doors to the police station.</p><p>The other vampire didn’t notice her until she was already climbing up the steps, then froze when she found Rio leaning against the door, arms crossed, grinning.</p><p>Agatha spluttered, “What the—how did you—”</p><p>The disbelief on her face was absolutely delicious.</p><p>Also, the rest of her. <em> God </em> did she look amazing in that suit.</p><p>“Someone’s off their game,” Rio taunted.</p><p>Agatha balked at her. “<em>Am not. </em>”</p><p>Rio lifted herself from the door, then stepped toward her, gently clasping her fingers around the collar of Agatha’s suit. She bit down on her lip as she smoothed the fabric down. Her fingers grazed against the shirt for several long, arduous seconds.</p><p>When she looked back up, Agatha’s pupils were full. </p><p>Not only were they full—they were staring directly at Rio’s lips. <em> Hungrily. </em></p><p><em>Jesus Christ. </em>Rio found it very hard to focus on what she needed to focus on. “Agatha, is something wrong with your powers?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow creased, as if she was frustrated that Rio was doing something that wasn’t related to fucking her. </p><p>
<em> God, we’re in public. In front of the police station. Why is she so turned on? </em>
</p><p>Rio frowned. Then realized, because she had momentarily forgotten who she was dealing with, that this was Agatha Harkness. </p><p>
<em> She’s turned on *because* we’re in public, in front of the police station. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Probably minutes away from being put in handcuffs. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She is so ridiculously insane. </em>
</p><p>Rio was so in love with her.</p><p>Agatha’s head tipped up, and thankfully she interrupted that train of thought before it could fester.</p><p>“My powers?” She huffed. “Of course not. My powers are fine.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Agatha.” She pulled gently at Agatha’s collar, which made the other woman emit the most distracting sound in the universe. But Rio pushed on. “Don’t lie to me. Your Suggestion didn’t work on me just now. And it didn’t work on Tommy before.”</p><p>“Ugh.”</p><p>Agatha looked up—then down—pretty much everywhere but Rio’s face—before shrugging and going, “Yeah, ok. Maybe.”</p><p>Rio frowned, because honestly, she had really been hoping she was wrong.</p><p>She took another step closer, and pushed a hair behind Agatha’s face worryingly.</p><p>“What’s going on with you?” she asked.</p><p>Agatha trembled a bit at the gesture, at Rio’s hand gently touching her face, which Rio noted away for later in her pile of unexplainable Agatha behaviors. But then she pursed her lips.</p><p>“If you <em> must </em> know. I’ve had a bit of a… mental block recently,” she muttered, cheeks reddening as if she was talking about erectile dysfunction. “With my powers. It’s happened once or twice before. Nothing to get your panties in a twist about.”</p><p>Rio frowned. She never remembered this happening before. Not in their time together.</p><p>“When? What other times?”</p><p>Agatha’s foot began to tap irritatedly against the pavement. </p><p>“Ugh. Does it matter? Just—some other times. A long time ago. When we were apart. Remember, when you went up north, and I was in—”</p><p>“Bucharest, doing those social experiments on the prison guards?”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “But didn’t you use your Suggestion on them for that?”</p><p>“Well, yes. But they were easy targets. Obedient pests like military officials and prison personnel are so weak minded. They follow orders like dogs.” Agatha laughed coldly. “I got myself locked up precisely so I could focus on rebuilding my power using them as pawns. And it worked.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows creased further. “Wait, you <em> got </em> yourself locked up? You told me that it was because you and that woman were spotted in the yard—” The thought of Agatha with someone else made her suddenly nauseous, even in distant memory, but she shoved it aside. “You told me that I should go up north to see the lights while you were in prison. That you wanted some time to relax and enjoy some free meals courtesy of the <em> Poliția Română.</em>”</p><p>Agatha didn’t meet her eyes. She waved her hand in front of her, the gesture she always did when she was eager for a conversation to be over. “And that’s exactly what I did. Two birds, one stone. I got my powers back, you saw a disappointing celestial event. Anyway, the point is, it’s all fixable. I just haven’t had the time to—well—clear my head. Toy around with some new victims.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, then lowered her voice to a whisper. The kind of tone you’d use with a child who’s put himself in a corner and refuses to speak, “But what do you think causes it? The… mental block?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes slowly fell back to hers. Her entire face went impassive; frozen. She got that same look on her face that she did when Rio had kissed her. Like a thousand thoughts were caught in a traffic jam. Clearly, she knew something. Clearly, she had a theory. Agatha <em> always </em> had a theory. </p><p>But it didn’t mean she was going to tell her.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said. Shrugged. “Stress. Imminent bankruptcy.”</p><p>Rio laughed. <em> As fucking if. </em></p><p>Something must have happened back then. Before Rio had left for Denmark in the 1800s. She had a vague recollection of <em> something </em>, but she couldn’t remember what. </p><p>She cursed her stupid, useless mind.</p><p>Whatever. It didn’t matter. Whatever it was, it must also be happening <em> now </em>.</p><p>She just had to pry Agatha open a little bit more.</p><p>“Oh my god,” a voice squealed from a couple feet away. “It’s them.”</p><p>Rio and Agatha both turned at once to find Tony and Andrew staring at them from the bottom of the staircase, eyes wide, jaws unhinged.</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>Her worried expression wiped away slowly, and she patted Rio on the cheek, then leaned in towards her ear.</p><p>“Speaking of feeble minds,” she whispered seductively, and Rio’s entire body broke out in goosebumps. “Let me take a crack at these two? Might help in the <em> healing process. </em>”</p><p>Rio shook her head, but couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“They’re all yours. Just <em> do </em> remember we’re standing in front of the police headquarters.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a brazen smile as she began to walk down the stairs.</p><p>“Good,” she giggled. “I love a challenge!”</p><p>Rio sighed as she watched Tony begin to back away slowly, absolutely terrified, and Agatha transform into one of her many characters—one of those myriad walls she hid effortlessly behind.</p><p><em> Apparently</em>, Rio thought, <em> So do I. </em></p>

<p>In the end, Agatha and the boys reached an agreement: she and Rio would be staying in the apartment indefinitely, and Agatha would consult on the decoration of their next two properties. </p><p>They all concurred that it was a very fair and reasonable situation, certainly nothing requiring police intervention—Tony couldn’t even remember why they’d gone to the precinct in the first place—and, by the end, they all went out for lunch martinis.</p><p>“You are seriously evil,” Rio chuckled as she sipped a daiquiri through a straw. The boys were in the bathroom, leaving them alone with six empty glasses and a full bowl of pad thai. It was happy hour at Thai-lai, and Andrew and Tony had been happy to pay for all four of them. “Celebrating our new interior designer,” Tony had said, and they all clinked glasses.</p><p>Rio had been trying her best not to laugh in their faces.</p><p>Agatha batted her eyelashes up at her. “Oh, I’m evil because I’m doing what a girl needs to do to survive? How reductionist.”</p><p>“To survive?” Rio laughed. “You mean three shots of watermelon vodka, two daiquiris, three entrees, two bowls of popcorn shrimp—”</p><p>“Can I get anything else for your ladies?”</p><p>A waiter had snuck up behind them with a bright, shining smile that said, <em> Thank you for spending way too much money at our restaurant, would you like to spend even more? </em></p><p>Agatha was as quick as a whip. “Two more daiquiris, please.”</p><p>The waiter nodded while Rio’s mouth hung open. “Of course.”</p><p>He puttered away, and Rio snorted in disbelief.</p><p>“Unbelievable.”</p><p>“The shrimp? I know.”</p><p>Agatha popped another of the crustaceans in her mouth, crunching down on the batter as she grinned up at Rio. Agatha was smiling at her in that way that made Rio feel like she could spend the rest of her life just like this, drinking watered down alcohol and not paying for it. </p><p>And for a flicker of a moment—it almost looked like Agatha was thinking the same thing, her smile turning soft, the barely-there wrinkles around her eyes bunching together.</p><p>Rio forgot herself in the feeling, and lifted her hand to Agatha’s face, tucking a hair behind her ear, and saying nothing. The dimly lit restaurant was covered in these stupid RGB lights—blinking red, green, blue, red, green, blue—and they danced on Agatha’s lips like a Christmas tree. Rio so badly wanted to kiss the holiday sheen off that pretty mouth.</p><p>“You’re gorgeous,” Rio whispered, without really meaning to.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks colored this unbelievably pretty pink. She had never seen Agatha blush, not before they started doing all of… this. Whatever this was.</p><p>But she was addicted to it now. She loved the rush that came with knowing she was responsible for making Agatha feel that way.</p><p>“And you’re drunk,” Agatha replied, setting down her snack. She didn’t move away, though—her eyes still pinned to Rio’s own, that easy smile still on her lips. “Rio…”</p><p>“What?” Rio frowned. Because she felt like she was about to get chastised. Then she added petulantly, and yes, <em> drunkenly, </em>“I can’t call you gorgeous now?” <em> Is that another rule? </em></p><p>Listening to the words come out of her mouth, it occurred to her how many times over the years she <em> had </em> called Agatha gorgeous. But how many of those times had she meant it like she did now? It was so strange—it was almost like the memories had a veil over them.</p><p>She could remember the instances—Agatha looking pretty for a Venetian ball, Agatha shuffling across a beach at dusk—but she couldn’t remember the emotion she’d felt each time. Like a photo without color.</p><p>Agatha laughed coldly, and she picked Rio’s fingers up where they lay, still, on the side of her temple, placing them back onto the table. Which was obviously a rejection, Rio wasn’t so dense that she couldn’t see that, but the strange thing is that Agatha didn’t let go of her hand when she set it down. </p><p>She just laid her own palm over Rio’s, and pretended like she didn’t.</p><p>“Sure you can,” Agatha said coolly. Her effortless front had returned. Then, below the table, she slipped her heeled foot around Rio’s ankle. “But don’t do it somewhere where I can’t do anything about it.”</p><p>And <em> oh</em>—Rio’s mind was suddenly as blank as a sheet of paper. She really wasn’t proud of how much obvious evasiveness she was letting Agatha get away with, but she couldn’t help it.</p><p>A quiet, desperate feeling in her chest told her that she only had so many of these opportunities left. That there was a window to all this, and if she didn’t jump at every offered bone now—</p><p>So she sprung out of her seat like a dog who’d heard the treat jar shake, and towered over Agatha, who looked up at her with dark pupils.</p><p>“Let’s go,” Rio said breathlessly.</p><p>Agatha laughed in surprise. “Really? I mean—just leave them here, with the bill? While we bite each other silly back at their apartment?”</p><p>Rio was already getting light headed thinking about it. “Pretty much.”</p><p>Agatha grinned at her fondly. It made Rio’s heart clench.</p><p>“You really do spend too much time with me.”</p><p>She took Rio’s hand, and let her help her up.</p><p>It sounded light and meaningless when Rio replied, “Every moment I can get.”</p><p>

<br/>
</p><p>They didn’t even make it through the apartment door before Rio had Agatha pressed up against the cold hallway wall, her hand clutching at the waistline of the other woman’s pants.</p><p>Agatha tasted like strawberry alcohol—sweet, <em> too </em> sweet, the kind of sweetness that hides something sharp and dangerous—and Rio’s swollen mind could only think, repeatedly, <em> I love you, I love you, I love you, </em>as she pressed open-mouth kisses to the other woman’s throat.</p><p>“Don’t tease me,” Agatha whined. “I want to feel your teeth.”</p><p>Rio groaned out some obscene mix of syllables, because what else was she supposed to do when Agatha said things like <em> that. </em>She let her fangs fall forward, graze on alabaster skin—</p><p>“<em>Wow. </em> Wow. I mean, I want to say I’m surprised, but I totally called that.”</p><p>A voice that belonged to neither of them echoed from a few feet away. Surprise hit Rio and Agatha like a whip and they bolted apart. Rio immediately rescinded her fangs, grateful that she hadn’t drawn any blood when she saw just who was waiting for them, standing like an awkward pin needle with his hands shoved nervously in his pockets.</p><p>“<em>Billy? </em>” Rio mumbled.</p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha groaned. “Does our apartment have some kind of twink bat signal I don’t know about?”</p><p>Billy grumbled. “You can’t just call people twinks, Agnes. I don’t go by any label—”</p><p>Agatha waved her hand, and turned toward the apartment door, searching her pockets for the keys. “This argument hasn’t even started and I’m already over it. Goodbye, teenager.”</p><p>“Wait. Stop. Also, I’m twenty three—”</p><p>Then, like the third train to smash into this mess of a conversation, Rio mumbled, “Wait, you called <em> what? </em>” She was still blinking stupidly as she processed the first thing he’d said. </p><p>Billy narrowed his eyes as Agatha pushed the door open and waltzed inside. “You and Agnes? Being… a thing?” he said, gesturing to the wall that Rio had pressed Agatha against moments before. “I mean, you literally dug a peephole into the fabric of our shared cubicle with a pencil, like some kind of mole rat, so you could spy on her in the meeting room across the hall.”</p><p>“Oh my god. You did what?” Agatha laughed cruelly from inside the apartment. Rio burned red, and followed the other woman’s lead into the living room. Billy looked strangely at the now empty doorway before sighing and following them in, closing it firmly behind himself.</p><p>“Oh, yes, just make yourself at home,” Agatha muttered, rolling her eyes and putting on the coffee machine.</p><p>Her movements were still drunk and clumsy, and she missed the button several times while trying to press it. It made Rio smile despite herself.</p><p>“Gosh, you really are a goner,” Billy said as he took a single glance at Rio’s face. He then neatly removed his shoes, and instead of doing something normal, like sitting on the couch, he continued to stand in place and play with the ring on his finger. But his awkwardness did not prevent him from playing private investigator. “So, how long have the two of you been married?”</p><p>“<em>Married?” </em>Rio said hoarsely.</p><p>“Ten years,” said Agatha, without missing a beat. “Not that it’s any of your business.”</p><p>“Ten years?” Rio said, more hoarsely.</p><p>What the fuck was Agatha talking about? What the fuck was going on?</p><p>Hot coffee burbled out of their Keurig machine and into Agatha’s beloved mug—a bright pink ceramic that said <em> If you can’t beat them, eat them</em>—and Agatha whisked it away and wandered over to the couch, where she dragged Rio down next to her, basically onto her lap.</p><p>Rio gawked at her. But Agatha didn’t give her an inch, her face turned to Billy.</p><p><em> Is this about the funeral? </em> It had to be about the funeral.</p><p>She knew Agatha had been preparing some kind of character for them to play that involved them being married, but the roles were only supposed to extend as far as getting through the gates and inside the venue.</p><p>Billy wasn’t even supposed to know about their aliases. They were planning on avoiding him during as much of the service as possible, and if he did approach them with any questions, they’d just Suggest them away from his mousey little brain. But apparently some part of that plan had changed. Maybe it had changed just now, inside Agatha’s mind. Rio had no idea.</p><p>To help relieve some of that cluelessness, she looked up at Billy and asked, “Um, no offense, but what are you doing in our apartment?”</p><p>“Oh,” he frowned. “I thought that was obvious.”</p><p>Rio gave him a look that said <em> It absolutely is not. </em></p><p>“I think I figured out who killed Tommy.”</p><p>If the Oscars had installed cameras inside their apartment at that moment, Agatha and Rio would have swept every category.</p><p>(Vampires historically hold the most awards for Best Actor and Best Actress. Lauren Graham herself holds twenty-seven awards, which she’s received as several different people. Most famously as Katharine Hepburn.)</p><p>Agatha’s fingers scrunched around the fabric of Rio’s pants, but besides that, everything else about her stayed still. After a moment, she laughed.</p><p>“Oh yeah, Sherlock?” She taunted, leaning forward. “And who do you think did it?”</p><p>The confidence in Billy’s shoulders deflated a little at Agatha’s condescension, but not completely. With a huff, he finally sat down, sliding his lanky body into the eggshell armchair that sat next to the television. It swallowed him up, making him look like a grape in the palm of a giant’s hand. Hardly a threat.</p><p>Still, she felt Agatha tighten her grasp on her knee when he came closer—the faintest evidence of nerves—and Rio’s heart swelled that <em> she </em> was what Agatha held onto when she felt scared. Like an anchor.</p><p>(A totally stupid thought to linger on when they were potentially about to be accused of murder, but Rio had never been great at prioritizing.)</p><p>“My step-brother was caught up in a lot of…” Billy’s leg bobbed nervously. “Well, he…”</p><p>Billy made a bunch of pathetic hand gestures that said nothing. His leg bobbed even more.</p><p>“Dear god. Out with it,” Agatha muttered. “Which is it? Lobbyists? Mafia? Slave traders?”</p><p>His leg stopped bobbing when he gasped. “<em> Slave </em> traders?” Billy looked positively scandalized. “I mean Tommy was a dickhead, but I can’t believe you’d even suggest that.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and Rio could tell, from a single look, that she wanted to say<em> I’ve been alive longer than the Atlantic slave trade, I’ve watched the CIA topple governments—and entire nations—on a whim, and I know just how many things powerful people get away with if they have a good enough public relations team, so yes, it wouldn’t be so surprising, </em> but in a truly uncharacteristic show of self-regulation, she just shrugged.</p><p>“He was in a lot of debt,” Billy revealed finally, to which Agatha full body <em> gasped </em> , replying “the son of a billionaire? In <em> debt? </em>” like the know-it-all asshole she was, and Billy believed it for only a moment before he realized she was just being herself, and continued on, “My step-dad didn’t know about it. But I looked through a bunch of files—” Billy reached for the knapsack he was wearing, and began extracting a series of manila folders. </p><p>“—And Tommy’s company, the company we all worked at, was failing miserably.” He set the folders down on the table, and Agatha, feigning disinterest, picked them up and began to skim apathetically. “So he kept inflating the bottom line by buying and selling some sort of… financial assets… I don’t know, it’s all so <em> vague </em>, but he was selling them to a bunch of high-rolling buyers around the world. In several locations. Beijing, Tokyo…”</p><p>“And Vienna and Bucharest,” Agatha mumbled, reading off the file. Rio’s eyebrow arched, seeing the way something had activated inside the other woman. Agatha had that singular, burning focus about her suddenly, but it flickered out almost as soon as it’d come. She tossed the folder onto the table. “So, what? You think his loan sharks killed him?”</p><p>Billy bit down on his lip and stared at his lap for a moment.</p><p>When his head raised again, a chill entered his voice.</p><p>“It was either them, or my step-dad.”</p><p>Then Agatha <em> snorted.</em></p><p>“Oh my god, you think Daddy Dearest killed his inept son?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Billy huffed, throwing his hands up. “I don’t know. These were the only files I could get from his office before the police arrived and whisked everything away. But it wouldn’t surprise me. My step-dad never seemed to care about Tommy. Or me. Or Mom. He was so—he was so <em> strange. </em> Like, vacant. He’d switch emotions on a whim, happy to sad to angry, and then not even seem to remember why he’d been in a mood a few minutes ago. So no. I wouldn’t be surprised if he did it. I wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t even <em> remember </em> that he did it.”</p><p>Agatha stilled next to her, her shoulders going rigid.</p><p>It wasn’t hard to imagine why.</p><p>Everything in Billy’s description was accurate to the behavior of a thrall. Which meant that he had been—and likely still <em> was</em>—under Wanda’s thumb. </p><p>Which meant that killing Wanda would be the only way to claim him as their own.</p><p>Which Rio hadn’t really had a problem with, not when it was so… theoretical.</p><p>But talking to Wanda’s son—sitting across from him like this, observing him in all his adolescent awkward squirminess—the idea sat differently in her chest now. Her stomach turned uncomfortably.</p><p>“Billy,” Agatha said slowly, licking her lips. “Why are you talking to <em> us </em> about this?”</p><p>Billy blinked. He narrowed his eyes, giving them a look again that said <em> Isn’t it obvious? </em></p><p>“Well. No offense, but you’re the two biggest bullshitters I’ve ever met,” he said. “Well, at least <em> she is.</em>” He gestured toward Agatha, and Rio didn’t take offense. “I’m not good at lying. Or… talking to people. If I try and figure this out myself, I’m going to keep hitting constant dead ends. I… I was hoping that you two might, well, come with me to the funeral tomorrow and help… dig through this. Talk to people. Try and figure out who might have been behind it.”</p><p>Billy twiddled his thumbs nervously. Agatha turned to her, then, with a completely impassive expression—except for the most subtle twitch at the end of her lip.</p><p>What was…</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Agatha was trying… not to laugh.</p><p>This was all incredibly funny to her.</p><p>Why was Rio even surprised?</p><p>“And before you ask, I know, I know, I can’t just ask you to help without… compensation,” he said, wincing like the words physically hurt him. He shoved his hand in his knapsack again and pulled out a checkbook. It had <em> W. Maximoff </em>inscribed on the back. “But Tommy’s not the only one with deep pockets. My mom got… a lot of money in the divorce. So…”</p><p>
<em> Oh my god. </em>
</p><p>Rio could hardly believe what she was hearing.</p><p>Billy wanted them—Agatha, and Rio—to help investigate the murder of his step-brother. For money. Probably a ludicrous amount of money. The step-brother that Rio had, in fact, murdered. Whose father they were planning to enthrall. And whose ex-wife they were most likely going to have to murder in order to do so.</p><p>Yes. That’s what was happening.</p><p>Rio and Agatha had got up to a lot of mischievous shit in their day, but this, somehow, might have taken the cake. Or perhaps the whole cake shop. And the whole neighborhood.</p><p>Agatha reached down and gingerly picked up her coffee cup, slurping it quietly.</p><p>“Fifteen thousand dollars,” she said.</p><p>Billy blinked twice, then sighed.</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Agatha laughed happily, set down the coffee mug, then clapped her hands. She turned to Rio, and with the biggest shit-eating grin she’d maybe ever sported, said, “Well, then. What are we going to wear?”</p><p>“I mean, those suits seem fine,” Billy remarked.</p><p>And Agatha giggled, because she couldn’t help herself.</p><p>“You’re <em> so </em> right Billy. What a happy coincidence.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Married? <em> For ten years? </em>”</p><p>Rio was still reeling fifteen minutes after Billy had left the apartment. Agatha had immediately gotten giddy over the new money in their bank account—and was now furiously tabbing through abandoned Amazon tabs. They’d probably have ten deliveries by noon: new furniture to piss off Tony and Andrew; a robot vacuum cleaner that Agatha had been eyeing.</p><p>“What?” Agatha looked up from her virtual shopping cart with a frown, as if she didn’t see what the problem was. “Well, I can’t just say six <em> hundred </em>years. Then he’d start asking questions.”</p><p>Rio blinked several times in disbelief as she lowered herself onto the couch. She removed Agatha’s laptop from her lap, much to the other woman’s chagrin—although Agatha didn’t put much fight into keeping it, she just made a bunch of petulant noises—and Rio slung her arm over the couch, so it was inches from Agatha’s shoulder. But not touching.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed out, trying to keep her voice steady. Stagnant. Agatha gave her an annoyed look that said <em> Can we get this over with, so I can get back to my online shopping </em> ? Rio gave her a look back that said <em> Shut up. </em> She continued, “I was not criticizing how <em> long </em> our hypothetical, well, no, our <em> non-existent </em> marriage has been going on for—” </p><p>She groaned, hearing herself.<em> You’re babbling. </em> “My point is, <em> was, </em> whatever— why did you claim we were married at all? We weren’t planning on telling Billy about the aliases. And now we don’t even need the aliases. So why don’t we just…”</p><p>
<em> Drop the act. </em>
</p><p>Her lips stilled. </p><p>She couldn’t force the words out. </p><p>Because, well, <em> fuck </em>— she really wouldn’t mind being Agatha’s wife, would she?</p><p>Which was a complete and utter surprise to Rio. Because not only had she not cared for marriage before, she’d been actively disgusted by it. Marriage made women into property. It had always been a legal tax-agreement afforded to the heterosexual portion of the population that, at best, was used to steal a man’s wealth, and at worst, involved a humiliating ritual involving a white dress. Rio never cared for men; and she never wore white.</p><p>Vampire marriages were even worse, if Agatha was a reliable source to go by. Which of course she wasn’t. But Rio believed her nonetheless. She was nothing if not pious.</p><p>But just imagining the sound of that word—<em>wife </em>—coming out of Agatha’s mouth—</p><p>Goosebumps ran up Rio’s arms.</p><p>Oh god.</p><p>She wanted that.</p><p>She <em> wanted </em>that.</p><p>Rio tried to hide that earth-shattering realization from her face, biting down hard on her lip as Agatha finally gave her her full attention. The other woman’s suit top had become a total mess, unbuttoned and creased. </p><p>They’d need to iron it before the wedding. <em> Funeral. </em>Not wedding.</p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p>“What? You don’t want to be my wife?”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. Agatha’s chin was resting on her knee when she said it, an all too casual way to deliver such a question. She didn’t flavor it with any kind of teasing; her whole body said it with a shrug. But Rio could see mischief dancing behind the facade. </p><p>And sure enough: “I’m a shit cook, sure. And I won’t do your laundry. I’ll probably even flirt with other men and then call you crazy when you catch me. But I have a few redeeming qualities,” Agatha continued, a small, barely-there smirk growing on her face as she lifted her hand to wrap around Rio’s own on the couch cushion. She began to walk her fingers down Rio’s shirt sleeve, like a bored child. “For example, as of five minutes ago, I now come attached with a fifteen thousand dollar dowry. Try to find another field maiden with that kind of liquid cash. You won’t.”</p><p>Agatha slowly descended upon her, walking her fingers up and up Rio’s sleeve, until they were curling around the collar of her shirt. </p><p>Within seconds Agatha was straddling her, sitting in her lap and carding her fingers through Rio’s hair.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. “You’d make a pretty bride.”</p><p>Rio’s heart was pure thunder. <em> What the fuck. What the fuck. </em></p><p>“Our ceremony was probably a short one,” Agatha continued to imagine aloud. She laughed. “You probably ate one of the guests for looking at me wrong.”</p><p>She pulled a little at Rio’s hair, and Rio whimpered.</p><p>Agatha smirked when she heard the sound. “You’d make that sound a <em> lot </em> on our honeymoon. Over and over. All night long…”</p><p>Rio just stared at her as Agatha closed her eyes, imagination running wild.</p><p>What was this? Foreplay? Torture? Something else?</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio said weakly, unable to find any other words.</p><p>The pale vampire’s curls coalesced around Rio’s collarbones. There was only a hair of a breath between them now; enough that Agatha could undoubtedly hear the shuddering of Rio’s heartbeat. But she didn’t lean in—or make a move to press her teeth to Rio’s neck. </p><p>She just dangled there.</p><p>“Yes?” Agatha answered, pupils dilated.</p><p>Rio’s eyes darted to her lips. She felt a strong current pulling her toward them.</p><p>Except—</p><p>
<em> Am I allowed to kiss her? </em>
</p><p>Was this sex? Was this something else?</p><p>“What are we doing?” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha’s lips pressed into a line. She didn’t seem sure herself of the answer.</p><p>“Playing pretend,” she said, finally, then amended it. “Getting into character.”</p><p><em> Sex it is, then. </em>“Roleplaying?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darkened. “Ding ding ding,” she said.</p><p>“And you want to call me…”</p><p><em> I should stop this now, </em> Rio thought, not a moment after. <em> I need to stop this now. </em></p><p>Agatha stared at her intensely as she finished her sentence, “My wife?”</p><p>
<em> Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. </em>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes must have widened to the size of two golf balls from the way Agatha chuckled at her.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha used her nails to streak down Rio’s neck. “You’d like that?”</p><p>Agatha had that lilt in her voice again. The one that was trying to sound sure of herself, but really was asking a question—uncertain, unsure. A slight tremble.</p><p>“<em>Yes, </em> ” Rio hissed, closing her eyes. Because in the dark she could pretend this was real. That this wasn’t just a <em> scene </em> —a play— <em> theater.</em></p><p>One of Agatha’s little one-woman-shows.</p><p>Agatha’s hands began to trail their way down her sides. “Aw, you want that so bad, don’t you? You want me to call you my wife while I fill you up? While I fuck you until you lose your hearing?” she drawled, breathless. “You want to pretend to be my wife while I mark you all over? You want to repeat our vows with my fangs buried in your neck? When you come on my fingers?”</p><p>
<em> Oh god. Oh god. </em>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck. </em> Agatha. <em> Yes.” </em>Rio shuddered. Equal parts emotion and desire flooded her chest. She wasn’t sure she’d survive this. Immortality knew nothing of Agatha Harkness <em> . </em> “<em>Please,</em> yes.”</p><p>“Yeah? You want to be my little <em> wife</em>, Rio? All mine? No one else’s?”</p><p>“God, baby. Yes, yes, yes,” Rio whined, as Agatha’s hands slid up her chest. She repeated the word deliriously, like she was praying to a higher power. She felt like a mortal bent over in a church pew, speaking in tongues. She’d never wanted to turn something from fiction to fact so badly in her life. She wanted to Suggest it into Agatha’s mind. She wanted to make it <em> true.</em></p><p>“Really? You do?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes slid hazily back open. Because by now she’d expected Agatha’s teeth in her neck; Agatha’s knee, hand, arm, <em> mouth</em>, pressed up in between her legs; any kind of friction, any kind of excuse to take this conversation off the dangerous teetering cliff of <em> meaning something.  </em></p><p>But Agatha’s voice had only grown more uncertain every time Rio insisted. And true enough, when Rio took her in again, Agatha didn’t <em> look </em> hot and bothered. She looked… startled.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asked, immediately snapping back to reality. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha blinked several times. Her lips were slightly parted, breath coming shallowly from her throat. And that’s when Rio saw it—the damp discoloration just below her eyelashes. A slight redness to her pupils. Barely noticeable, but Rio was close enough to see every detail.</p><p>She was… crying?</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped, all the lust leaving her body in a rush. </p><p>“Agatha, what’s wrong?” Rio said urgently, lifting her hand to wipe under Agatha’s eyes. But as soon as the pad of her finger touched her cheek, Agatha shook her head, turning her face away. She didn’t lift herself from Rio just yet, but Rio could feel her spikes coming up like a porcupine. </p><p>“I’m fine,” she bristled. Then inhaled sharply. “Just <em> kiss me. </em>”</p><p>She turned toward Rio again then, and dragged her forward like a lightning bolt.</p><p>It was desperate and open-mouthed, and Rio couldn’t help but groan into it, her legs spreading involuntarily. But her worry was headier than her desire; she could taste Agatha’s tears on her tongue. She tried pushing against Agatha’s chest, silently reasoning with her to stop, but the other woman refused, just pressing deeper into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio whispered the words against Agatha’s insistent mouth, which kept punctuating her syllables with kisses that said <em> shut up, shut up </em>. “You’re crying— we should— we should stop.”</p><p>Agatha drew back suddenly, and the swiftness gave Rio whiplash.</p><p>And—more alarming—the other woman’s eyes were glowing red.</p><p>“I’m not crying,” Agatha said, and Rio felt pin pricks inside her skull. Agatha’s intruding fingers were aiming for her mind. The attack was almost offensive in its brazenness. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio scoffed. “I can <em> see </em> the tears on your face.”</p><p>Agatha leaned again, capturing Rio’s lips once more. “No you don’t,” she muttered against her mouth, and Rio felt that strike against her cerebrum once more—like a spear.</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>Rio pushed her away with force, maybe too much force, the other woman almost falling off of her. But Rio caught her with a sweep of her arm around Agatha’s back, stabilizing her. The other woman’s eyes widened in shock. A shock that broke the magic connection completely. Rio felt Agatha’s tendrils escape her mind, and the tears on her face became even clearer than before.</p><p>Rio’s first instinct was to apologize, but something more urgent surged through her. Not quite anger, but close. </p><p>She needed Agatha to hear this. </p><p>“Agatha,” she repeated. “Don’t do that.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, then shrugged her hair off her shoulder casually. </p><p>Rio could tell she was trying very badly to piece her shield back together.</p><p> If it wasn’t for the wet streaks on her face, Rio would barely be able to tell something was wrong.</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>Rio sighed. Maybe she didn’t need to say it. </p><p>
<em> No. You need to say it. You need to set this boundary. </em>
</p><p>“I need you to stop using Suggestion on me.” </p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. Then, as if Rio had struck her with a knife, she shuffled off of her lap, and Rio immediately missed her with an ache. The other woman backed up several feet, then huddled her arms around herself protectively. There was a panic in her eyes.</p><p>“Wait, Agatha—”</p><p>“Rio, I would <em> never </em> try to Persuade you to…” Agatha cringed, becoming visibly disgusted with herself — the thought clearly deeply disturbed her. “Persuade you to have <em> sex </em> with me. I’m not some kind of monster.”</p><p>Rio frowned. She stood, and Agatha took another step back.</p><p>“Agatha,” she sighed. “I know you would never do that. Also, you wouldn’t have to. Because I<em> want </em>to have sex with you.”</p><p>Her directness seemed to loosen Agatha’s hackles. When Rio took another step toward her, Agatha didn’t flinch away this time. </p><p>And when Rio wrapped her hands around Agatha’s arms, and began to stroke them up and down rhythmically, Agatha’s frown deepened, but she didn’t run away.</p><p>“I <em> really </em> want to have sex with you,” Rio repeated slowly, despite how much the blunt honesty sounded sour on her own ears. “But not when you’re <em> crying. </em> And you trying to persuade my mind that you’re <em> not </em> crying is not okay, either. It’s insane, actually.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. Rio could feel the muscles tighten in her arms.</p><p>“I just—had a stupid <em>moment</em>,” Agatha muttered. “It wasn’t worth stopping over.”</p><p>Rio’s frown deepened, and she squeezed Agatha’s arm hard enough that the other woman looked up at her.</p><p>“Part of consent is letting <em> me </em> make that choice,” she said quietly. “Not just you.”</p><p>At that, Agatha stilled. The message had clearly landed. Something deep within her seemed to shift as she swallowed, and squeezed her eyes shut. She shuddered, and sighed out, “Fuck.”</p><p>A moment passed, with Agatha’s head hanging down. Then she shook her neck, as if trying to free herself from a thought. What started as resignation seemed to transform into something else—anger, fear. She seemed overwhelmed, dissociative. </p><p>“Fuck,” she said again. “Fuck, fuck.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrowed. She wanted Agatha to understand, to agree, but she didn’t want her to feel guilty about it. She knew it was just a reflex. Agatha sometimes Suggested things without even meaning to. It came to her as naturally as breathing. She did it deliberately, too, of course, but when she felt scared, sometimes it just came out in a rush.</p><p>It happened a lot more when they were younger. Back in Van Helsing’s hayday, vampire hunters had tracked them down into the woods of Transylvania. Rio had been hit with three crossbow bolts and was bleeding in the grass, and Agatha had been so scared that she’d accidentally wiped Rio’s mind of the entire incident while she was trying to heal her.</p><p>Rio only regained the memories after the fact, when Agatha unworked the suggestion.</p><p>That was the thing about Agatha’s powers. You could occasionally overpower them naturally, with sheer willpower, or Agatha could undo the spell herself.</p><p>But it wasn’t something they’d had to do in a long time.</p><p>
<em> Nothing had shaken her up this much until now. </em>
</p><p>“Agatha, it’s fine,” Rio assured her, frowning softly as she ran her hands up to Agatha’s shoulders, then down again. She could feel the other woman shiver. “It’s not a big deal. I just wanted to bring it up in the moment. I’m okay. <em> We’re </em> okay.”</p><p>She closed the space between them, bringing her into an embrace.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said, her voice cold and distant. Her hands remained by her side.</p><p>Rio cupped the back of her head, and scratched her nails against Agatha’s scalp affectionately.</p><p>“You don’t have to apologize,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha laughed bitterly against her neck.</p><p>“Hm,” was all she said. </p><p>And in that moment, all the anger washed away, all Rio could feel was an overwhelming protectiveness over the other woman. Because this had all started with the fact that Agatha had been crying. She’d almost forgotten that, so distracted by Agatha’s prying into her mind.</p><p>Agatha had been crying about… what?</p><p>Rio replayed the moment in her head, and her cheeks flushed.</p><p>Agatha had been talking about being her wife.</p><p><em> That </em> is what had triggered it.</p><p>At least, superficially.</p><p>Rio’s hand stilled against Agatha’s head.</p><p>She pulled back to look at the other woman, her heart beating quickly in her neck.</p><p>“Wait,” she said, trying to sound as delicate as possible. “Why <em> were </em>you crying?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. Rio could see the fearful animal in her retreating.</p><p>“Agatha,” she pressed, sounding more desperate than she wanted to. “I really need to know. I really need you to tell me.”</p><p>Agatha avoided her gaze. “I don’t see why it matters.”</p><p>As usual, Rio wanted an inch—Agatha wouldn’t give her a centimeter.</p><p>“Just tell me this once, and I’ll do whatever you want forever.”</p><p>Rio grinned a little as she said it—she knew the offer was ridiculous—and her whole chest lit up brightly when Agatha smiled a bit too, unable to help herself. The other woman rolled her eyes, but it was full of mirth this time. They just looked at each other for a moment, Agatha studying her face, before she squeezed her eyes shut and let out a breath.</p><p>“Fine. But you’re not allowed to ask any follow up questions.”</p><p>Rio laughed incredulously. “Agatha, that’s ridiculous.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “The rules are the rules.”</p><p>“Oh my god. You are <em> so </em>exhausting.”</p><p>“And yet you’re glued to me anyway. Pathetic.”</p><p>Agatha was giving her one of <em> those </em> grins. The ones that made it impossible for Rio to ever hate her, even a little bit, no matter the heights her rudeness reached. </p><p>“Fine,” Rio muttered. “I suppose I have no choice. Now tell me.”</p><p>Agatha’s shit-eating grin faltered. Realizing she had to actually make good on her end of the deal, she huffed, and, not wanting to meet Rio’s eyes, rested her forehead on her chest instead.</p><p>Rio’s stomach fluttered at the intimacy of it. Her nerves frayed at the edges as she waited.</p><p>When Agatha did speak, her voice was so quiet Rio could barely hear it.</p><p>“Sometimes,” she mumbled. A long pause. “I get greedy.”</p><p>Rio froze, her entire body thrumming at the admission. It was barely a sentence, but still, it lit her mind aflame. Immediately a hundred questions wanted to spring out of her.</p><p>Greedy? What did she mean, greedy? Agatha was a woman who was never afraid to take more than she was offered. She did so with pleasure. She hoarded wealth like a dragon.</p><p>What could possibly make her feel greedy? Did she feel greedy<em> with </em>Rio? </p><p>As in, she was taking too much from her? As in, she wanted <em> more </em> from her?</p><p>Rio’s breathing was coming quickly now, as the thoughts feasted on her.</p><p>But then Agatha’s head drilled even further into her shirt, and she spoke again, even quieter. Her fingers clenched Rio’s shirt, knuckles boring into her sides.</p><p>“When I kiss you I can still taste the mortality on your lips,” Agatha said. “It makes me feel like something bad devouring something good. Like even if you say you want it, you don’t really <em> want </em> it, because you never wanted any of this. You didn’t ask to be made into this. You killed my entire clan because you didn’t want this. And here I am, the child you mercifully left to live, still wanting to bleed you dry. <em> Greedy. </em> Evil. <em> Bad.</em>”</p><p>Agatha laughed coldly against her skin.</p><p>“<em>Oh.</em>” Rio’s heart broke. “<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>Agatha nodded her head <em> no </em> before Rio could even get a word out. “I told you, no follow ups,” she said, not meanly, but sternly, and extricated herself from Rio.</p><p>“You are not <em> bad,”</em> Rio said forcefully, grabbing her wrist. Emotion clogged her throat, Agatha’s words making her angry, furious, enraged, sad, <em> protective. </em></p><p>And Agatha — with all the audacity in the world — just shrugged, turning away, trying to break free of Rio’s grasp. And in that moment, Rio didn’t care <em> how </em> Agatha wanted her. What form or shape it took. She didn’t care if it was only lust; she didn’t care if Agatha didn’t want to hold her in the morning or kiss her before bed; </p><p>If Agatha couldn’t even<em> touch </em> her without feeling wrong, then even if Agatha only wanted her for five minutes, for those five minutes Rio would wipe her mind clean. </p><p>Rio would play the role of the bad, irrational creature, and force Agatha to reinvent herself.</p><p>So she did something rash.</p><p>She picked Agatha up, bridal style. The other woman yelped in surprise.</p><p>“Rio,” she gasped. “What the fuck are you—”</p><p>The sentence died in her throat. Rio kicked open the door to Agatha’s room, and it whined on its hinges as it slapped against the wall. Some of Agatha’s frames trembled against their nails. </p><p>It took a lot of effort for Rio to contain her strength on a daily basis. Where Agatha found it hard to constrain her Suggestion, Rio’s power was something more squarely physical. Every vampire had a talent—and Rio’s was that everything she touched tended to die. </p><p>Gentleness was something she was forced to learn in the reverse; like a woman with an amputated arm, she had to relearn how to handle life with new, mechanical fingers.</p><p>Usually she treated Agatha with those tempered touches. But not now.</p><p>Rio tossed Agatha, with care, onto the mattress. The other woman landed there, cheeks flushed. Rio climbed over, felt her blood boil under her skin.</p><p>“Agatha,” she breathed. “Give me a safe word.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her in complete disbelief. You could tell she was expecting just about anything in the world to come out of Rio’s lips then <em> that.</em></p><p>“<em> What? </em>” she spluttered.</p><p>“Safe word. Now.”</p><p>She could practically see the gears turning in Agatha’s brain. Rio’s idea had worked, at least in part, because she’d clearly given Agatha such whiplash that whatever inner-angst she was feeling had been completely shaken out of her like a salt shaker. She was just stunned.</p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha muttered under her breath. When Rio’s eyebrows lifted, she clarified, “No — that’s not the word. Azaleas. Azaleas is the word. Rio, I don’t think—”</p><p>Whatever complaint was about to come out of Agatha’s mouth Rio silenced with a bite to her shoulder. She didn’t give any warning—no gentle kiss, no swipe of her tongue—just her fangs, cold as ice, diving into flesh. Agatha whined in surprise, but not just surprise—“<em> Fuck </em>,” she moaned, and then, again—“God, you could give a girl a little warning.”</p><p>Agatha was talking too much. That meant her mind was still going, which meant Rio wasn’t doing her job right. “Quiet,” Rio said, taking her hand to press over Agatha’s mouth. She sucked against Agatha’s skin and moaned at how good it felt—she’d almost forgotten—but this wasn’t about her. This was about the way Agatha’s breath was hot against her fingers.</p><p>“Oh god,” Agatha moaned, muffled against Rio’s hand. <em> That’s better </em> . “Oh god, keep going.” <em> Much better. </em> Rio smiled against her skin, and she almost let the emotions peek back in—but she shoved them down. <em> This is about Agatha </em>, she reminded herself. </p><p>This was about explaining something Agatha couldn’t understand unless Rio showed her.</p><p>So she pulled out of Agatha’s shoulder, her eyes glowing bright red. Then she loomed over Agatha’s face, and blood dribbled from her mouth onto Agatha’s collarbones.</p><p>Agatha stared at her, completely mesmerized, as the droplets coalesced on her skin.</p><p>And Rio, blood on her lips, smiled softly down at her. Utterly enamored by that shock in Agatha’s face. She wanted to keep it that way — unable to frown. Unable to reconsider.</p><p>She wiped the blood from her own mouth, and used the same hand to drag it across Agatha’s parted lips. She watched the other woman’s eyes light up as the red dragged across her mouth, looking at Rio like she was made of magic.</p><p><em> I love her</em>.</p><p>She didn’t even stop herself from thinking it. She just let it exist, then pass.</p><p>Rio leaned down and pressed her mouth to Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“You remember that safe word, okay?”</p><p>And before Agatha could reply, Rio surged her teeth into her neck. She felt the other woman’s hips buck up at the contact, moaning like it was a revelation.</p><p>But Rio was only getting started. </p><p>She slid her teeth out of her neck just as quickly as she’d put them there, and then before Agatha could complain, she bit again, lower. She repeated this over and over—bite after bite after bite—barely giving the other woman time to breathe as fangs entered and re-entered her. Leaving gashes down her neck, then around her collarbones.</p><p>“Mine,” Rio said as she sank them in again. She heard Agatha whimper at the word, so she repeated it at every bite. “<em> Mine. </em> ” “Mine.” “ <em> Mine. </em>” </p><p>Her fangs dragged along Agatha’s skin, from her collarbones, down to her stomach, ripping open her suit jacket with only the sharp knife of her teeth. She used her mouth to move the damp, blood-covered shirt aside, so her nose was pressed just above Agatha’s belly button.</p><p>“God, I love your stomach. So soft, so pretty. Like the rest of you,” Rio mumbled against her skin, feeling the flat pane of Agatha’s abs, the soft skin of her lower half. “So perfect.”</p><p>Then, without hesitation, she bit the flesh to the side of Agatha’s belly button, and Agatha hissed, but the way her hips bucked up told Rio everything she needed to know. </p><p>She only increased her ferocity, biting harder—deeper—taking more blood with each bite.</p><p>“Oh god,” Agatha cried, her hips canting up again. “Oh god, <em> oh god. </em>Your fangs, baby—”</p><p>“I know,” Rio crooned into her skin. “You take them so well.”</p><p>Agatha’s torso was an utter crime scene in minutes, and if Rio had any mortal instincts left in her, she would have probably fainted at the sight of it, but she could feel nothing but <em> want </em> as Agatha’s body grew redder and redder, flushed, blood rushing to the surface.</p><p>Rio snaked up her body again, so she could see Agatha’s face.</p><p>And, <em> oh </em> — the other woman’s pupils were dilated to an extreme — black and so <em> full. </em></p><p>She looked like she was completely transported. Somewhere else. Outside her mind. The blood loss helped with that—made everything fuzzy around the edges. So did the feeding. The marking. The feeling of <em> being </em> marked. </p><p>The combination was like being drunk and high and yet so sober you could feel every touch like a razor’s edge.</p><p>“Agatha?” she said softly, pressing her palm against the other woman’s forehead as she tucked hair behind her ear. “You with me?”</p><p>“Mm?” Agatha mumbled. Eyes open and expressive and so <em> compliant. </em>“Yes.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said, and bit her lip. “You’re being <em> so </em> good.”</p><p>Agatha breathed in sharply at the praise, not protesting, so Rio plowed forward.</p><p>“Can you feel how much I want you, baby? Every time I bite you, can you feel it?”</p><p>Agatha blinked at the question. But Rio didn’t want her to think, she just wanted her to answer. She wanted her to know it without thinking.</p><p>So she leaned down and kissed her softly on the mouth. A gentle contrast to the battlefield she’d left on the rest of her body. Agatha whimpered into it, and a moment later, Rio withdrew.</p><p>“Answer me,” Rio said softly.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha breathed out sharply. “I can feel it.”</p><p>Rio nibbled at her earlobe, fangs grazing there too—Agatha hissed.</p><p>“You’re so perfect. My perfect little blood bag,” Rio whispered into the side of her face. In any other state of mind, she would have blushed at the words leaving her mouth. But she was so high on Agatha, seeing only crimson red, the words only felt natural. Agatha was hers. Agatha <em> was </em> perfect. “Being so obedient. Letting me devour you. Letting me suck you dry.”</p><p>Agatha moaned when Rio repeated her own words to her. “Fuck, Rio, I need you—”</p><p>“Are you begging the big, scary vampire to fuck you, Agatha?”</p><p>Rio bit her own lip at that one. She withdrew so she could get a good look at the other woman’s face. But Agatha wasn’t laughing. Instead—it had clearly done something to her.</p><p>“<em>Yes. </em>” She said, cheeks frighteningly pink. “Please.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly at her.</p><p>“Okay,” she said. “But Agatha, I want you to know something first. So pay attention.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows furrowed. Rio could see her fighting the haze.</p><p>Rio’s heartbeat started to racket in her neck. </p><p><em> This isn’t smart. </em> </p><p>She didn’t care. </p><p>
<em> Don’t say this. </em>
</p><p>She didn’t have the self control to stop herself.</p><p>“You <em> are </em> my wife,” Rio breathed.</p><p>Agatha’s face went pinker than it ever had before. Her pupils dilated to oblivion.</p><p>“I am?” Agatha answered, quiet, <em> so </em>quiet, and Rio would remember the quiet revelation in her voice for the rest of her life. The way she unmistakably needed to hear it.</p><p>“Yes, you are,” Rio said, biting her lip so she didn’t smile, and she didn’t care if Agatha could see through her now. She didn’t care if she could tell it wasn’t an act. She didn’t care if this would ruin them forever. “ ‘Till stake through the heart do us part.”</p><p>Agatha laughed—just laughed—free as a bird, and so did Rio.</p><p>And then she let her hand wander down, and found the zipper of Agatha’s pants.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Moonlight filtered in through Rio’s blackened shades and painted Agatha like an angel as Rio slowly dragged down the zipper of her pants.</p><p>Heavenly little bouts of breath caught in Agatha’s throat with each tiny tug, and Rio couldn’t help herself but smile at the sounds like a fool.</p><p>Agatha looked at her through hooded lashes. “What are you smiling at?” </p><p><em> My wife </em> felt like pushing it, and Rio wanted nothing less for this to end, so she pulled the fly completely undone, savored another little angelic <em> hm </em> out of Agatha’s throat, and pressed a kiss to her cheek, whispering,</p><p> “May I take these off of you?”</p><p>It was formal, too formal, but whenever Rio couldn’t think straight, she’d get caught between centuries.</p><p>It was enough that they spoke five languages between them, worse even to have spoken them for hundreds of years, absorbed every manner of idiom and expression and then tossed them aside when it was no longer in fashion.</p><p>But, like sewage, it all circled the drain of Rio’s mind. So when her fingers danced along Agatha’s underwear, a hundred different ways to beg came to mind. <em> May I relieve thee of this? Wilt thou yield this to me? Grant me this, I beg of you. Por favor. Por favor. Por favor. Por favor. </em></p><p>And, as if she was feeling just as overwhelmed, “Da,” Agatha answered, then, blushing, she translated, as if Rio wouldn’t be able to understand, “<em>Yes.” </em></p><p>So, with consent taken in two languages, Rio made her way down the bed, dragging her nails down Agatha’s skin as she traveled—watching goosebumps appear in the soft skin between her breasts, which were still covered in thin white, sheer cloth—until her fingers could curl around the expensive waist band of expensive slacks, and she pulled.</p><p>Of course, Agatha, ever impatient, flailed her legs to get them off faster—tearing the seam.</p><p>“I thought we might be able to salvage those. How naive of me,” Rio said, rolling her eyes. “What are you even going to wear to the funeral tomorrow?”</p><p>“I’ll kill some valet and steal his suit.” Agatha’s head canted up from the pillow, and her eyes were faintly red—a subconscious Suggestion stirring inside her. “‘Now take off your clothes before I rip them off of you with my teeth, <em> pretty please. </em>”</p><p>Rio bit her lip, forcing down a smile. She could feel Agatha rising out of that sunken, scared space she’d been in before—and she welcomed it. Even when she felt Agatha’s influence chew on her mind, telling her to take off her shirt. </p><p>Like some kind of horny teenager.</p><p>But Rio was already complying. She tugged the dress shirt off herself first, then, keeping eye contact with Agatha the entire time, undid the back of her black bra. </p><p>It slunk to the comforter. </p><p>“Oh. Oh, wow.” </p><p>Agatha’s lips parted as her eyes raked down, then up again. She gave Rio a look like she’d never seen another woman’s body in all her time on Earth. And Rio blushed, almost believing her.</p><p> “You’ve seen me naked dozens of times,” she said self-consciously.</p><p>Agatha scooted up, holding herself steady with her hands pressed to the mattress. </p><p>“I know,” she said, eyes still glued to Rio’s chest. Her throat bobbed as she seemed to consider her next sentence. “But I never allowed myself to <em> look </em>before.”</p><p>Rio froze at the admission—and Agatha could tell, her gaze flitting up to meet Rio’s. Her bitten lip silently communicated the same sentiment that started this all: </p><p>
<em> Don’t ask any follow up questions. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I’m not ready to answer them. </em>
</p><p>Rio swallowed. Licked her lips.</p><p>
<em> Okay. </em>
</p><p>But if she couldn’t ask questions with her mouth, she’d ask them with her hands.</p><p>Rio pressed her fingers to Agatha’s hips, where pale hips had been reduced to just her underwear: purple lace, pricier than this apartment’s mortgage.</p><p>But instead of touching her where she wanted—where she clearly <em> needed, </em>telling by the deeply darkened fabric, and the way the other woman whimpered when her fingers treaded close—she cruelly ghosted over the panties, and slunk her hands upward.</p><p>And stopped just beneath Agatha’s breasts.</p><p>They were still covered by her shirt, but Rio could see her nipples harden under the cotton.</p><p>And, to Rio’s surprise, the sight drove her absolutely insane.</p><p>Because before Agatha, she hadn’t really cared about the bodies of the women she’d slept with. They were just that—bodies. Sometimes slim, sometimes curvy. Folds and wrinkles and skin. </p><p>Rio enjoyed the effect she had on them most, watching cloth turn moist and humid under her touch, like Jesus turning water to wine.</p><p>The human body was just not something she found particularly inviting altogether. </p><p>Even less so once it became a source of food. </p><p>But Agatha’s body was different. It felt like more than skin.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure how to describe it. Only that she knew with a sudden certainty that she would need to take up painting; that she'd fill sketchbooks with Agatha’s sharp silhouette, over and over, like a mad man in a trance, until the slope of her hips and the tilt of her jaw were burnt to the very flesh of Rio’s brain, and committed a hundred times to paper in every shade of paint.</p><p>It was a body worthy of devotion.</p><p>And Rio was about to make a shrine with her mouth.</p><p>She tilted her head up towards Agatha, who was looking at her through hooded lashes.</p><p>Rio pulled at Agatha’s collar. “Any last words to this shirt?”</p><p>“Good riddance,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>And Rio ripped it with her teeth.</p><p>Agatha moaned as the fabric was tossed aside, shucked to the floor without a second glance, and Rio’s mouth wrapped around her nipple. And <em> god </em>, god. The sounds out of Agatha’s mouth when her tongue pressed flat to it, when she hollowed her cheeks. She sucked on it like she would any fresh wound—and found it just as pleasing when Agatha squirmed beneath her.</p><p>“<em>La dracu</em>,” Agatha shouted when she bit down, so loud the crows would flee the trees, her hand coming to wrap around Rio’s head, pressing her deeper into her. “That feels—fuck—your <em> mouth. </em>I should have been shutting you up like this for centuries.”</p><p>And before Rio could really let that idea settle into her—of her and Agatha spending <em> years </em> like this, of Agatha pulling open her shirt every time she wanted Rio to stop talking—Rio felt a need to distract herself, so she gilded her free hand down Agatha’s midriff to dip beneath her underwear, sliding almost instantly through wet folds to find Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“Oh—<em> oh. </em> Oh god. <em> ” </em>Agatha bucked instantly against Rio’s fingers. The desperation in it almost made Rio’s vision color white. “Inside, Rio. I— I need you inside.”</p><p>And if anyone was greedy, it was Rio. Insane, terrible her, for saying, cheekily, because she couldn’t stop herself—“Ask your wife nicely.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped open, her breath ragged in her chest as she paused her whining. Rio’s cheeks colored in embarrassment and lust all at once.</p><p>
<em> I said too much. </em>
</p><p>She’d pushed too hard. She could see it now, the water bucket full of ice ready to wash over her and bring her back to reality. Agatha was holding it just above her.</p><p>But the water never came. Instead, Agatha opened her big, beautiful mouth.</p><p>“Your wife,” she said quietly, again, like she couldn’t believe the sound of it. “<em>Right. </em>”</p><p><em> That’s the game we’re playing </em> , Agatha’s expression said. <em> I’d nearly forgotten. </em></p><p>Rio dared not repeat the word. She just licked her lips and nodded.</p><p>“I wish you had a wedding ring,” Agatha mumbled suddenly, urgently. Like it was an idea as powerful as the atomic bomb. “So I could feel the cold metal once your fingers were deep inside me. So you’d know when it was enough.”</p><p>Rio’s mind screeched to a halt. </p><p>She must have looked as dumb as she felt in that moment, just blinking like a slowly dying machine. She could tell her deadened expression must have started to scare Agatha off of it, because she could see the woman’s eyebrows furrow, her mouth moving to reel all the words back. </p><p>Rio couldn’t let that happen.</p><p>“Okay,” she said with a curt nod, and began to lift off of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows furrowed as Rio rolled off. “Wait, okay? What do you mean, okay—”</p><p>Unsteadily, Rio made her way to the set of drawers on the other side of the room. If she thought about it too hard—much like any of this—she’d grow cowardly, so she yanked open the top drawer without thinking, her full strength escaping her fingers, and the wood cracked. </p><p>The drawer nearly collapsed out of the set before she caught it.</p><p>“Damn it,” she cursed, placing the drawer on top of the table beside her. “Where are they?”</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha’s voice had dropped back into that unsettled, unsure place. The one where she pretended to sound confident, but the tremble betrayed her. “I was just fucking around. It was just a stupid horny thought—I have hundreds of them every minute. Come back here.”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t listening. </p><p>She was instead curling her fingers over two rings, plucking them from the soft tissue she’d wrapped them in hundreds of years ago. </p><p>They were made of a soft silver, made by an Italian jeweler back in 1768. They were each carved in the shape of a snake, and embossed in Italian in tiny lettering was part of a poem: </p><p>
<em> La vera storia d'amore è stata quella tra Eva e il serpente. </em>
</p><p>The real love story was between Eve and the serpent.</p><p>She sat aside Agatha and held one out to her, breathing shallowly as she watched Agatha’s eyes trace down to the ring, then, lips parted in disbelief, back up to Rio.</p><p>“Okay, what the fuck,” Agatha said, a humorless laugh leaving her. She looked almost… agitated? “Who were you planning to propose to?”</p><p>Why did she sound so jealous?</p><p>“No one,” Rio laughed. “They’re not engagement rings.”</p><p>“Then why do you have <em> two </em> of them?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. </p><p>“Italians are a persuasive people. Sicilian witches even more so. She told me to get two in case I ever —” <em> Fell in love, </em> Rio stopped herself from saying. Before Agatha could ask her to finish her sentence, as she so obviously wanted to — Rio continued on, “Doesn’t matter. We were apart, that summer you spent in Salem, and the quote made me think of you. I know you’ve always had a… <em> different </em>interpretation of the Old Testament.” </p><p>Agatha’s skeptical expression finally faltered, and she took the ring from Rio, observing it with a soft sort of determination, turning it around in her palm. </p><p>She mouthed the quote as she read it under her breath, then laughed coldly.</p><p>“So, which one of us is which?”</p><p>Rio’s brow creased, confused. </p><p>“Who’s Eve,” Agatha clarified, licking her lips. “And who’s the serpent?”</p><p>
<em> Oh. </em>
</p><p>Rio laughed, understanding the implication. </p><p>“Who corrupted who, you mean?”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Agatha had that troubled expression on her face again. The one she’d had earlier. Rio could practically feel the thoughts pressing claustrophobically against Agatha’s skull — <em> which one of us is bad, tell me it’s me, tell me it’s me, I know it’s me </em>.</p><p>“Isn’t marriage a sort of mutual corruption?”</p><p>That seemed to pull Agatha slightly out of her pit. She smirked, “I don’t think the Catholics would phrase it quite like that, no.”</p><p>“Good thing we’re not Catholic.”</p><p>“Weren’t you baptized?” Agatha countered.</p><p>“So are all the other thieves and murderers born in Galicia.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “So which religion is overseeing this, then?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Take your pick.”</p><p>“The pagans might not mind.”</p><p>“Hm.” Rio smiled as she took the ring from Agatha’s fingers, and began to position her hand. Not quite pulling the trigger, but simply offering it. “Satanism might do, too.”</p><p>Agatha looked nervously down at the ring, then back at Rio. “Even Satan might have rules against marrying someone for the night just to get them off.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach clenched.</p><p>
<em> Is that all this is?  </em>
</p><p>But before she could open her mouth, Agatha took Rio’s hand, and did the honor herself—slipping the ring up her wedding finger, releasing a sharp breath, then grabbing the other ring from the bed where it sat, and doing the same to Rio.</p><p>“There,” Agatha said, as if she’d just cleaned up a mess.</p><p>“There,” Rio echoed, looking down in disbelief at her hand, and at Agatha’s matching finger. For a brief moment, the two snakes seemed to move. Genuinely slither. </p><p>Just as the seller had promised back in the eighteenth century—<em> love will make them dance </em>. </p><p>Rio had figured her for a sentimental scam artist, but maybe she’d read her wrong.</p><p>With Lillia’s voice in her head, <em> love will make them dance </em> ,  <em> love will make them dance </em>, Rio couldn’t stop studying them, far longer than would have been appropriate for something that was proposed as a glorified sex toy. She remained mesmerized, emotion caught in her chest like a bird in a pipe, until she felt Agatha’s finger brush under chin, propping her up so their eyes would meet.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Do you want to stop?” Agatha asked, ghosting her hands across Rio’s thighs. Which made the question feel a little disingenuous. “Or do you want to fuck me, and we can figure out how to be normal again in the morning?”</p><p>
<em> How to be normal again. </em>
</p><p>She laughed. A testament to just how thoroughly ruined she was that she found that idea so funny. Rio wasn’t sure she’d ever be normal again. She wasn’t sure she’d ever take off this <em> ring </em> again. But look at that, for the first time, Agatha had become the optimist. Something to celebrate.</p><p>“Lay down,” Rio said, in place of an answer.</p><p>Agatha blinked, squinting at her suspiciously for a moment, before obeying.</p><p>They didn’t say anything after that. Not until Rio had cleared her mind by ravishing Agatha’s breasts again, kissing and biting along her sternum. They didn’t speak until both of them were a firm distance from reality, the only sounds coming out of Agatha’s throat small whimpers.</p><p>Until finally, Agatha begged again.</p><p>“Rio.” Rio’s nose was pressed up against her throat, her fangs denting the skin. “Fingers. Yours. Enough — enough teasing me.”</p><p>So Rio complied.</p><p>Her hand traveled down, silently, and slipped into Agatha with an ease that made both of them gasp. And suddenly all the anguish from a moment before was wiped clean, replaced only by the feeling of Agatha so <em> full </em> around her, closing around Rio, opening again. </p><p>Like a revelation each time.</p><p>“Does that feel good, baby?”</p><p>
<em> Because it’s completely ruining me. </em>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t use her words in reply, instead wrapping her arms around Rio’s neck and pulling her down, whimpering into a sloppy kiss. Sloppy but <em> soft, </em>her fingers pressing gently into the dimples of Rio’s cheeks. Like Rio was a paper doll that Agatha was scared of crumpling.</p><p>“I don’t usually let people fuck me,” Agatha said quietly, and the confession made Rio’s fingers still—which Agatha immediately punished by pushing into her hand, whining. “That wasn’t me giving you permission to <em> stop, </em>baby.”</p><p>The pet name made Rio’s skin flush. She didn’t think she’d ever get used to hearing it. She hoped she never <em> stopped </em> hearing it. “I just don’t want to do anything you’re not comfortable with.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “If you had let me finish my sentence...” So Rio did, expectantly, keeping her fingers unmoving while she waited—which was obviously the wrong thing to do, by the way Agatha bit the side of her face, like a wild animal.  “What did I say about stopping?”</p><p>“You want me to fuck you while you tell me how you don’t like to get fucked?”</p><p>With an impatient moan, Agatha’s free hand snapped down to meet Rio’s own, and pushed her back inside of herself, guiding her fingers back into a rhythm. Rio’s mouth came open in shock, and Agatha grinned, eternally pleased with herself.</p><p> “God, yes.” Agatha arched into it, eyes closing. “Much better.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.” </em>Rio whimpered. “Tell me.”</p><p>She felt the ring crest against Agatha’s opening, and the both of them gasped again.</p><p>“Oh my god. Yes. <em> Yes. </em>” Agatha moaned as cool metal pulled back, then pushed up against her again. She moaned. “God. I love feeling like your— your—” </p><p>She whimpered, cutting herself off.</p><p>“My what?”</p><p>“Like your — your fucking property.”</p><p>Agatha blushed, and Rio’s entire body melted.</p><p>“Jesus <em> Christ, </em>” Rio breathed out, both disgusted and absurdly turned on all at once.</p><p>Before Rio could say anything about it, though, Agatha careened back to her original thought, “You’re the only one whose fucked me in centuries.”</p><p>Their eyes met when she said it — and Rio could tell from the color of her eyes, darker than usual, that it was earnest. </p><p>
<em> …Centuries? </em>
</p><p>With all the thousands of people Agatha had slept with from then to now, she’d only touched them? They’d never touched her?</p><p>It was a confession that had nowhere to sit in Rio’s mind. It was indigestible.</p><p>“Why?” was all Rio could think to ask.</p><p>
<em> Why me? Why now? </em>
</p><p>Agatha chuckled dryly a moment before moaning again at Rio’s relentless fingers, Agatha’s knuckles grasping the bedsheets, twisting them roughly. </p><p>“Because I don’t trust anyone,” she moaned. “I don’t trust them to touch me right. I don’t trust them to stop when I tell them to stop. I don’t trust them to understand what I want.” She laughed bitterly. “I don’t trust them not to try and kill me while I’m enjoying myself.”</p><p>As Rio digested her words, a boulder began to form in her throat.</p><p>“I would always stop,” Rio said.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I would never hurt you.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“You’re sure you want me to keep going?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened just a smidge. “I’ll kill you if you don’t.”</p><p>“So you trust me?” Rio asked. She needed to know. She needed to hear it.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes captured hers.</p><p>“As much as I can trust anyone,” she said, her fingers snaking around Rio’s neck. Rio could understand what she meant implicitly —<em> I can’t trust anyone fully, I never learned how </em> — “Fuck, Rio. That feels so good. You feel so good.”</p><p>And even if it wasn’t perfect trust, even if it was trust with a heavy disclaimer, it was enough to make Rio feel high. Because Agatha was letting her in—again, and again—<em> inside. </em></p><p>She made a circle around Agatha’s clit, and the other woman’s hips seized into her.</p><p>Agatha’s words—Agatha’s <em> sounds </em>—Agatha’s movements—it was all enough to make an insane woman out of her; that was the only explanation for the way she opened her mouth.</p><p>“The good news is,” Rio said, thrusting her hand deep enough that the ring gilded against again, and she kept it there for a moment, unmoving, “You’re mine now. No one else’s. So you don’t have to worry about anyone else fucking you right. Just me. Only me.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes opened wide, and for a moment Rio thought she’d said something wrong—that she’d damaged them beyond repair—but instead, Agatha’s lips were nearly deforming hers in seconds, and her hips were practically begging Rio to keep going.</p><p>“<em>Please, </em> ” Agatha whined. “ <em> Tell me again. </em>”</p><p>Obedient as a greyhound, Rio worked her thumb against Agatha as she kissed her incessantly, “You’re mine. You’re mine. <em> All mine </em> . All mine.” Remembering what Agatha said earlier, she moaned – “You belong to me. <em> My </em>wife. No one else’s. Okay?”</p><p>She pumped in, out, in. The rhythm felt dizzying.</p><p>“God, call me that again.” Agatha’s breath came in short wisps.</p><p>“My wife?”</p><p>“<em>Yes </em>.”</p><p>“You like it that much?” Rio said quietly.</p><p>Agatha whined, arcing her hips up. “I like it that much.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Agatha was too close to the edge to think — and that’s why Rio asked it then.</p><p>“Because I like feeling like yours,” she groaned. “I love —” She paused, and Rio’s heart nearly jumped out of her. Agatha course corrected, “I get turned on by the — the <em> possession </em> of it all. It makes me feel—” Rio expected her to say <em> alive, turned on, hot, </em>anything that would make sense, anything that wouldn’t ruin her, but instead, she said – “Safe. It makes me feel safe.”</p><p>And Rio’s heart broke again.</p><p>And she knew, in that moment, what she had to say.</p><p>“No one can hurt you as long as you’re mine. Okay?” she whispered into Agatha’s ear as she swiped along her center. “And you are. Mine. Forever. Mine.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyebrows knitted. Her eyes shut tight. She was on the verge of something, and it didn’t feel merely physical—Rio couldn’t help but press feverish kisses to the side of her face, to her chin, to her forehead.</p><p>“Come for me, baby,” she whispered, pressing another delicate kiss to her lips. Then another, and another, until she tasted salty tears. She didn’t know who they belonged to—her, or Agatha. Both of them, at once. She inhaled sharply, pressing another. “Come for me, my love.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped open, and Rio could see the glassiness underneath her eyelashes. The pure terror on her face. </p><p>“Oh <em> god, </em>Rio—”</p><p>And then Agatha flipped them over, Rio underneath her as she came apart on Rio’s fingers. And if Rio had been a mortal, it probably would have broken her wrist in two—but she wasn’t, so she just moaned into the pain as Agatha’s hips careened into her over her again and again, Agatha’s fangs biting down into her neck, Agatha’s tears creasing her shoulder.</p><p>They continued like that for several minutes until Agatha finally let out a breath, and slipped out of Rio’s grip, falling backwards onto the mattress. A pillow’s distance away.</p><p>And it was only when they lay next to each other, unspeaking, that Rio realized their bodies had been connected for hours, skin to skin, and that absence now — that minute separation — felt like pressing ice to unclothed flesh. </p><p>She’d never felt closer to another person than she had being inside of Agatha.</p><p>Fucking Agatha. Making <em> love </em> to her.</p><p><em> This is what sex is, </em> Rio realized, a thousand years belatedly. <em> I get the ruckus now. </em></p><p>She turned over, looking at the other woman, who was still breathing slowly, catching her breath, eyes closed, mouth frowning. Rio felt the urgent need to touch her, to pull her in. She felt like a magnet being held tantalizingly close to its other end.</p><p>
<em> Oh god. </em>
</p><p>She felt her breath begin to come quickly, her pulse quicken.</p><p>
<em> Is it over now? </em>
</p><p>Had the scene ended? </p><p>Would Agatha even want her to touch her anymore?</p><p>Rio felt the ring itch. <em> Take it off. Take it off before she does. It’ll hurt less then. </em></p><p>But before she could slide it off, Agatha’s eyes opened, and, with a slight grunt, she turned on her side. Deep green irises bore into her. Her expression, for a moment, was entirely blank. Like Rio had actually fucked the ability to form thoughts out of her.</p><p>Then, in true Agatha fashion, she made it all seem simple again.</p><p>“You rip all my clothes to shreds, then don't even have the decency to keep me warm afterwards?” She clicked her tongue. “You lived through the regency era, Rio. I wrongfully assumed you knew a thing or two about chivalry.”</p><p>Rio stuttered. “You want—” She gestured between the two of them. “You want me to —  I know you said — about kissing outside of sex, so I wasn’t sure if this was—”</p><p>Agatha groaned loudly, and grabbed Rio by the elbow, practically dragging her into her side. She positioned Rio like a mannequin, slinging Rio’s hand around her middle, nudging Rio’s chin into her shoulder. Then she brought the comforter up to their midsections, so they were bundled into each other. Completely wound together like two spools of thread.</p><p>“You need to listen to me less,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio laughed disbelievingly into her shoulder.</p><p>“I never thought I’d hear <em> you </em> say that.”</p><p>“Well, miracles happen everyday.” Agatha went silent for a moment. “And sometimes I’m wrong. Sometimes you should just kiss me.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers dug into Agatha’s side. Her heart skipped in her chest.</p><p>“Like.” She paused, terrified. But if Agatha was going to bring it up— “Outside of sex?”</p><p>Agatha was eerily quiet.</p><p>“I don’t know. Yeah.” Despite her cool tone, Rio could hear Agatha’s heartbeat striking a drum in her neck. “Whenever you want to.”</p><p>“That’s not…” She tried to recall Agatha’s words. “Going to make things confusing?”</p><p>She felt Agatha shrug underneath her. And for a while, she said nothing. Nothing until:</p><p>“I’m not confused,” she said. “Are you?”</p><p>The response gave Rio such whiplash that she couldn’t even form her lips into an answer. An answer that would obviously be <em> Yes, Agatha, I’m confused. You just asked me to fuck you with a wedding ring on. I just fucked you and made you promise you’d never fuck anyone else, and you said yes. You said yes so many times you nearly went delirious. I just called you my love and you came all over my fingers. You looked at me like I was everything. </em></p><p>But obviously, Rio spent too many seconds in disbelief, that Agatha took her silence for a <em> no, I’m fine. </em>So Agatha sighed out, “God, I’m tired.” Rio thought that might mean that Agatha would leave, would go to her room, would cast Rio aside — but instead, she folded Rio to the side, and slung an arm around her, so she spooned Rio from behind. “Big day tomorrow.”</p><p>Feeling like a log sloshing along in a river, unable to cling onto anything, to say or move a muscle, just fated to be taken by the tide, Rio looked outward into the empty room, and breathed.</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “Big day.”</p><p>Humming, Agatha pressed a kiss to her back. Her mouth lingered there far too long. Rio could tell how tired she was from the way her arm began to sag around Rio’s middle. And when she spoke, her voice was basically dreaming already, so light and exhausted.</p><p>“Goodnight, baby,” she mumbled.</p><p>And Rio’s heart clenched in a way that would have killed a mortal.</p><p>“Goodnight,” Rio said, and swallowed thickly. Everything felt so big. So big. So big. Her throat felt tight. She had to get it out. Had to say something, to make it real. So as soon as Agatha’s breathing had gone quiet, little snores coming out of her nose, Rio whispered, “I love you.”</p>

<strong>STYRIA - 1401</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>The morning in which Agatha’s life changed irrevocably was completely unremarkable in all ways except one. Summer was breaking over Styria in the year 1401, pink foxglove flowers were sprouting into poisonous life off the cliffside of Riegersburg Castle, and Agatha Harkness, the gargoyle that she was, was welcoming in the fifteenth century from her stoop, hiding from her mother, sipping stolen mead, and partaking in her favorite activity.</p><p>Watching, and, better yet, judging.</p><p>The flowers, and everything else—the common people, far below in the fields, with their horse-dirtied tunics tucked into belts; the snobby nobles, women in floor-length gowns, slogging up the castle’s hills in carriages, and worst of all, the members of the Harkness clan, immediately recognizable from their black cloaks, black skirts, black hats, all in the summer heat.</p><p>They were collected like a wasp’s nest in the castle courtyard, drinking ‘wine,’ as they were told to refer to it as, and ‘entertaining’ a group of nobles from a far away place.</p><p>They did this every month or two. A group of well-dressed people would arrive from quite some distance, the clan would invite them for an innocent soiree, business dealings would be made, and the group would leave, none the wiser that they were now thralls—red eyed and mindless.</p><p>She’d seen the pattern so many times that looking at it all bored her to death. She was just about to finish the rest of the alcohol and tuck into a book when something jumped out to her. Not literally—nothing got this far up, save one of mother’s hawks—but far below, in the courtyard. There was a stranger there. Undoubtedly. Not a stranger as in one of the mortal strangers, one of the <em> victims</em>, but a vampire stranger. One of their own, except not.</p><p>Agatha’s heart stuttered, and she felt an emotion that she hadn’t in many years. <em> Excitement. </em></p><p>She’d felt its cousin—fear—many times over, everyday, but this one felt new in her chest.</p><p>Almost as if sensing her, the stranger looked up.</p><p>Brown eyes peered out. Big, docile ones. Like a deer. Woman’s eyes. And woman’s skin. Tanned, like soft leather. It was rare to see a complexion like that in the valley. The mixture of it all was as captivating to Agatha as watching a bird devour a mouse. </p><p>Something about the woman made her want to pounce.</p><p>Agatha’s gut twisted. As soon as the thought had come, she’d felt her mother’s presence in the back of her mind.</p><p>
<em> Women do not want for women. </em>
</p><p>Women especially did not want for tan strangers from the Iberian.</p><p><em> Unless she has a title, </em> Agatha daydreamed. <em> Maybe a duchy. A duchess. </em></p><p>The Holy Roman Empire was a dynasty kept alive by appearances, and when appearances failed, land or blood would do. But none of those things mattered unless Evanora approved. She was, after all, the shadow governor of the entire Habsburg family. </p><p>They were a family of thralls, and the Harkness clan was their masters. </p><p>So marriages, deaths, assassinations—they all went through her first.</p><p>And her only daughter? Well.</p><p>You can imagine.</p><p>Agatha leaned back, and sipped from her mead, feeling a buzz building in the back of her skull.</p><p>Still, that didn’t mean Agatha couldn’t <em> have her fun. </em></p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha intended to be the first to greet the stranger, so she Suggested the doorman—a thrall, one of their oldest—to let her take over his duties for the hour. He agreed with a shrug, taking Agatha’s leftover mead and shuffling over to some other dark corner of the castle.</p><p>Even at her young age, Agatha’s powers of manipulation were nearly equal to her mother’s. But Agatha’s methods for honing them to that degree had unfortunately earned her more beatings than they had praise; her favorite hobby was not enthralling strangers, but breaking them out of their trance. It was her way of undermining her mother, by freeing her favorite pets.</p><p>An unintended side effect of honing her Suggestion this way meant that she got very good at memory alteration.</p><p>Enthralling was essentially a dressed-up synonym for memory suppression, so to break someone out of it meant to release all of those repressed thoughts at once—a very delicate art.</p><p>If you did it wrong, you could injure your subject’s brain forever. </p><p>A mistake she’d made only once. The sight was so harrowing that she’d attempted to alter her own memory to forget it. But enthralling yourself was a circular endeavor—you only made the memory bigger, scarier, more present.</p><p>She had not tried again since.</p><p>A knock struck the door, and Agatha jumped.</p><p>She’d been minding the entrance for over an hour, and all of the usual suspects had already wandered in. The foyer of the Harkness House was bustling with conversation, and Agatha had begun to wonder if maybe the stranger had left before ever coming inside.</p><p>It wouldn’t be so unlikely—vampires occasionally tried to gain an audience with Evanora, only to be turned away.</p><p>
<em> But I won’t turn her away. </em>
</p><p>That had been her plan, at least. The doorman would have potentially alerted Evanora to the stranger. But Agatha would not. A bad idea, maybe. Other vampires could spell trouble, after all. But Agatha craved trouble.</p><p>Well—she craved anything that would trouble her mother.</p><p>So when she heard the rapping of knuckles against metal, Agatha whisked it open, just a crack. Enough for the guest to see Agatha and for Agatha to see the guest, but for no one in the ballroom to get a good look.</p><p>
<em> Oh, wow. </em>
</p><p>The stranger was even prettier at this distance.</p><p>She was wearing a snugly fitting black doublet over a dark green houppelande, its long, hanging sleeves dripping toward the grass. Around her middle was a black, jeweled belt, with a sheath, for what looked like a dagger. </p><p>
<em> A dagger. </em>
</p><p>The woman was carrying a weapon. And making no effort to conceal it, either.</p><p>It sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. Fear, but also, undoubtedly—</p><p>“Gott zum Gruße,” the woman said quietly, her accent curling delightfully around the ß. The greeting was standard, but not nearly as polite as the Harkness family would typically require. <em> The doorman would have turned her away six times by now. </em>The red flags were piling up in spades.</p><p>Automatically, Agatha replied, “Seid mir gegrüßt, edle Dame.”</p><p>The young woman’s mouth snickered in a way that made Agatha’s stomach turn. She so rarely saw women allow their lips to make expressions that were so… opinionated.</p><p>Noble women were supposed to keep their mouths in obedient little lines. Emotions were better concealed that way, secrets more easily protected. That’s what women were, secret keepers.</p><p>Yet, on the contrary, it looked as if this woman was mocking her. <em> Openly </em>so.</p><p>It was completely enchanting. </p><p>“Noble lady?” The stranger chuckled. “Please, don’t call me that. It’s a lie.”</p><p>“Then what should I call you?”</p><p>Against her better judgement, she opened the door even further, and stepped out into the summer night, her body demanding that they be in closer proximity.</p><p>The stranger’s smirk faltered in response, caught off guard now that she could see Agatha in her full glory—black dress wrapped around a tight waist, unbrushed brown hair falling in chaotic tufts around her shoulders. </p><p><em> She finds me pretty, </em>was the story Agatha’s oversized ego told herself. When the stranger’s eyes dropped briefly down to her chest, Agatha couldn’t help but grin in that wolfish way her mother would slap her for. <em> Scratch that. She finds me irresistible. </em></p><p>Okay, perhaps that was a push too far. She knew she was at least partially inventing fantasies. Even if she herself was born with a penchant for the same sex, she guessed that few other women shared her proclivity—or <em> none, </em> if you were to ask her mother.</p><p>“May I ask you a question?” the stranger said, and her voice had gone all quiet. </p><p>Agatha’s answer to that question, she would realize much later, was the singular thing that made the difference between her living and dying that night.</p><p>But in that moment death was about the farthest thing from her mind.</p><p>She leaned up against the doorframe and said something entirely stupid instead, “Anything you’d like, gorgeous.”</p><p>The woman skidded brusquely past her deliberate flirting, although she at least did Agatha the service of looking for a moment flustered by it — her tan cheeks coloring prettily — and said, “Do you know if Wilhelm von Greifenfels is here tonight?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. There was nothing erotic about <em> that </em> man. Her mood soured even darker when she considered that maybe this woman was not only uninterested in <em> her, </em> but here to court a different member of the Harkness family. </p><p>“Are you in search of him?”</p><p>The woman seemed to consider how to answer. “Yes,” she said. “I am.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I have business with him.”</p><p>“Well.” Agatha huffed. “I do hope that business is murder, because any other business would be a dreadful mistake on your behalf. He’s an oaf and a predator. If you marry him, he’ll drink himself into a daze before finding a lady of the night to squander in your bedsheets. His balding head belongs under a guillotine. But yes, he is here.”</p><p>The woman’s eyes widened in what seemed like surprise, or maybe even terror, which only made Agatha more further disappointed. This stranger carried a dagger, for Hell’s sake. A little joke about death shouldn’t have even moved her.</p><p>“Are you serious?” the woman said, and something in her voice made Agatha pause. It wasn’t scandal — or horror — she had misread her — the stranger’s tone was <em> hopeful. </em> As if Agatha had dangled something promising in front of her and then threatened to take it away.</p><p>“About which portion?” Agatha waved her hand before the stranger could answer. “Actually, it doesn’t matter which. I am serious about every bit and detail. In fact I will only let you inside <em> if </em> you promise to kill him. I will sleep easier with his head lolling around on a stake.”</p><p>At this point she was only kidding — disappointment made her say mean, ridiculous things — but the stranger’s answer was as fast as a whip crack.</p><p>“I promise.” She sounded almost eager. Her tongue was swiping along her lips. “I promise I will kill him and if you don’t mind, I intend to do away with the rest of the House, as well.”</p><p>Agatha froze. Her fingers pressed into the cold metal of the door and she just studied the woman for a moment, expecting her to backpedal on such an insane statement, but she didn’t. She looked at Agatha as if she meant it. Truly meant it.</p><p>And Agatha believed her.</p><p>And for a moment, Agatha imagined a future in which it was true. A version of her life that was lived in the way <em> she </em> intended it, free of Evanora’s influence. Because as long as Evanora was alive, she would corral Agatha like cattle. She would ensure Agatha was a stranger in every city, unwelcome at every inn, like a dog herding sheep back to the den, she would ensure that Agatha never left her sight — never made good on any of her aspirations.</p><p>Agatha scanned the horizon for unwanted listeners. Finding none, she looked behind her, then lowered her voice to a whisper. “You will die if you attempt that.”</p><p>The woman chuckled. <em> Chuckled</em>, as if it was funny. “Are you concerned for my well being?”</p><p>It was with great offense that Agatha realized she wasn’t wrong.</p><p>Beyond her initial attraction, there was something about this woman — most likely her threat to murder her mother, which was always an endearing quality in a potential friend — that felt like meeting a twin flame. Perhaps it was her unusual accent, the way it colored German to make it sound pretty in a way that Agatha never thought it could, or her straight-forward way of asking questions, or, perhaps it was just that they were both strange. </p><p>All her life Agatha had felt like an outlier. A stubborn stain in the carpet of the 15th century. It was bizarre and disorienting to find in front of her someone who existed equally in her wrongness. A second stain, resistant, refusing to bleed out into the wash.</p><p>But if Agatha wasn’t stubborn, she’d simply die.  “Of course I’m not.”</p><p>The woman laughed, as if she didn’t believe her. “Well then.” She put her hand on the door. “In that case, I see no reason for you to not let me inside.”</p><p>“Not without a name. I want to know who it is I will be thanking when it’s over.”</p><p>The woman bit down on her lip, then shook her head. “You are quite unbelievable.”</p><p>“So I’ve been told. Now, out with it.”</p><p>The woman laughed again, and Agatha was beginning to grow all too used to the sound. It would be a real pity when she was soon dead.</p><p>“Rio.” She seemed almost sheepish when she said it, which Agatha immediately frowned at. Because it was a beautiful name. Delightfully short, so much shorter than the terrible monikers that filled the road signs and the plaques of this dreadful country. “Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, then, with reluctance, returned the favor, “Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>The wind blew shrilly past both of their ears, and Agatha could hear shouts from inside for her to close the door, for fear of a draft. This little perfect bubble of theirs would be popped soon, and Rio would enter, and perhaps she’d try and kill her family, and most definitely she would die. But in that moment, at least she was alive, and at least Agatha could have her for a moment.</p><p>“I think we’re going to be friends, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, and turned her head toward the party. “You’d be the first to ever try.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>If Rio thought being Agatha’s wife in bed was torture enough, nothing — not solitary confinement, not years in federal prison, not being sliced open and knit back together with a sewing needle — prepared her for the way she’d feel when she woke up the next day, and Agatha hadn’t taken the wedding ring off.</p><p>Not even during breakfast, her hands messy with olive oil, or in the shower, her hands wringing wet hair dry.</p><p>Not once.</p><p><em> She wants to keep it on, </em> her foolish mind told her.</p><p>
<em> Or she can’t be arsed to take it off. </em>
</p><p>The funeral was a few hours away, after all.</p><p>Rio propped her elbows up on kitchen island as Agatha rounded the corner from the bathroom, hot, humid steam wafting in, clouding the kitchen like the view outside an airplane window.</p><p>Her roommate (or, in the dark crevices of her wishful mind, <em> her wife</em>) was more stunning than Cleopatra in just her towel, dew droplets of water collected on her bruised, bitten shoulders.</p><p>
<em> She looks so gorgeous like that. </em>
</p><p>Covered in bite marks. </p><p>Agatha failed to notice her there, so Rio watched her silently, like the moon watches the sun, as Agatha plugged in their coffee machine, and toyed with the edge of her ring as it booted up.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched up into a sly smile.</p><p>“I can feel you watching me, you know.” </p><p>Rio startled, blushing.</p><p>She swore she hadn’t noticed her.</p><p>“I wasn’t watching you.”</p><p>
<em> Liar, liar, liar. </em>
</p><p>“Right, just like you didn’t kill Tommy Ashcroft,” Agatha chuckled, amused, as she slowly punched in an elaborate amount of custom settings into the feeble Keurig machine, which whined like a baby at the terror she was inflicting on it. After a moment, she looked up, toward the fridge, then frowned gravely, as if disgusted. “God, I caught sight of the <em> thing </em> again. Are you sure we can’t burn it?”</p><p> <em> The thing </em> was a portrait of Andrew and Tony’s cocker spaniel that looked like it was painted by someone going through a psychotic episode — its eyes were the size of golf balls, and the color palette was red and pink and yellow.</p><p> Agatha had hidden it partially behind the refrigerator, but you could still see the creature’s snout poking out if you caught it from the right angle. And she had apparently found that angle.</p><p>Rio was just grateful for the change in topic. Anything to distract from the fact that she had woken up with Agatha’s arm slung tightly around her stomach, Agatha’s mouth pressed in a barely-there kiss to her neck. </p><p>Anything to prevent the creeping feeling that something was building between them, like a boulder might teeter at the top of the cliff, before ultimately diving into a chasm.</p><p>She turned the corner around the island, then leaned casually against the kitchen counter, so they were facing each other, trying to project confidence she didn’t have.</p><p>“Let’s <em> not </em> do that,” she breathed. “I like this apartment, and I’m not even sure your Suggestion is powerful enough to get Tony to forgive us if we put that thing into the trash.”</p><p>Agatha waved her hand dismissively. “Oh, let the twink hate me. He’ll have to get in line behind everyone else.”</p><p>Rio laughed sharply. “<em> Twink? </em>You are getting way too much mileage out of a word that you absolutely could not define if I asked you to.”</p><p>“Of course I could define it.” The coffee burbled noisily as Agatha licked her lips, staring at Rio as if she might find the answer in her face. “A homosexual man who is… in my business.”</p><p>Rio wanted to kiss the stupidity out of this woman. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>Apparently Agatha was thinking the same thing, because her eyes dipped down to Rio’s lips, and she bit down on her own. </p><p>Rio’s chest clenched, and last night replayed like shots of film in her head.</p><p>
<em> “You should listen to me less.” </em>
</p><p>They pair of them just stared, and stared, neither of them moving. The coffee began to pour into the drip tray, but there was no mug there to catch it. Agatha didn’t seem to notice. Rio could hear the other woman’s heartbeat in her throat.</p><p>
<em> “I can kiss you? Outside of sex?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Whenever you want.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Whenever you want.  </em>
</p><p>That was permission, wasn’t it?</p><p>As close to a get out of jail free card as Agatha could give her.</p><p>But because Rio was good, too good, and cowardly, too cowardly — she decided to give her an out. One chance to backpedal. </p><p>“Your coffee’s spilling,” Rio said. Because it was.</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows rose ever-slightly, but she didn’t look away from Rio’s gaze. “Oh, is it?”</p><p>Neither of them moved an inch, the tension like a taut rope. Rio looked at the marks of her own teeth on Agatha’s neck; the imprints of her nails on Agatha’s exposed collarbones.</p><p>And because Rio was still Rio, she couldn’t help herself.</p><p>She warned her, “I’m going to kiss you again.”</p><p>And Agatha looked at her as if she was the most ridiculous person on Earth. “Well, I fucking hope so. Or else I just wasted a perfectly good latte.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. But before Agatha could tease her more, Rio shoved the Keurig to the side, the machine wheezing against the granite, coffee spitting onto the floor, and lifted Agatha up onto the kitchen counter. The other woman let out a gasp, and Rio quieted it with her mouth, the kiss harder than she’d meant it to be, more forceful than she’d intended —</p><p>“Sorry.” Her words were messy and smudged against Agatha’s incessant lips.</p><p>Agatha’s shower damp thighs curled around Rio’s sweatpants. “Don’t.”</p><p>Rio withdrew, breathing slowly. Agatha’s pupils were already blown. Her hair already a mess even though Rio had barely raked her hands through it. The perfect picture of desire. Like last night hadn’t ended at all. Like they were right back there, Rio’s fingers curling inside of her.</p><p>
<em> But I want more. </em>
</p><p>The realization toppled over her like a ton of bricks. She no longer felt satisfied to settle for what a week ago would be more than enough. Like a naive addict, she’d ridden the hedonic treadmill to the top of the hill, and now she was greedy and desperate at the top of the cliff.</p><p>Because the longer Rio looked at Agatha, the more she wanted to pull away completely. Not because she didn’t want this, the inside of her thighs already told her otherwise, but for the opposite reason — </p><p>She wanted so desperately for them to just be able to kiss for the sake of kissing. She wanted them to kiss like it was punctuation; kiss and then eggs, bacon, waffles; kiss and then get dressed; kiss and then go on with their day. Kiss hello, goodbye, good morning. </p><p>Kiss like mortals do.</p><p>But then Agatha said, breathless, nails scratching into Rio’s shoulders, “Fuck me.”</p><p>And Rio blinked. Re-evaluated.</p><p>She was as weak as she was anemic.</p><p>“Are you sure? The granite might be kind of —”</p><p>“I don’t care.”</p><p>“But the funeral —”</p><p>Ignoring her, Agatha asked quietly, “Do you still have the wedding ring on?”</p><p>Their eyes met. Rio’s heart clenched.</p><p>“Yes,” she breathed.</p><p>Rio watched Agatha’s throat bob. Like she was swallowing something down.</p><p>“Fuck me with it one more time,” she said. “Before this is all over.”</p><p><em> Before this is all over </em> felt like a knife, serrated, cutting into her and leaving nothing left. But Agatha was starting to open her legs, the towel parting at her abdomen, and she looked like every goddess humanity had dreamt of, and smelled like her shower oil. <em> Olympian pink. </em></p><p>And who was Rio to refuse Aphrodite?</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>By miracle, they still managed to leave the house on time.</p><p>Agatha hired an Uber Black, and it fit right in with the procession of darkened limousines crawling across the streets towards the funeral. They borrowed two black suits from Zara minutes before meeting their driver, clipping the tags out in the backseat as alarms rang back at the mall.</p><p>“Forty-two dollars?” Agatha scoffed, holding the limp white paper in her hand. “What a ripoff. This isn’t even real cashmere.”</p><p>“Is it really a ripoff if we didn’t pay for it?”</p><p>“It’s about the principal of it, Rio.”</p><p>Rio laughed, and she was grateful to laugh — because if she wasn’t laughing, she’d be dwelling. Dwelling on the fact that Agatha couldn’t seem to kiss her without fucking her afterwards. Which made sense, of course, because that’s all this was. Fucking. All this was for Agatha, at least. What this was for Rio was a slow, torturous death.</p><p>A slow death that involved fucking Agatha until the countertop chipped, and the walls shook, and that terrible painting fell to the floor, behind the fridge, where they could never find it out again; until she was panting in Agatha’s ears, “<em> come for me, come for me, come on the ring, baby, I know you want to be mine, show me what that looks like, </em>” and it was those last words that did it — Agatha careening over the edge as silver slipped inside of her.</p><p>And for as much as Agatha was the actress between them, it was Rio who felt like the real performer as time went on. Rio the one pretending like she still cared about this plan, about the Ashcrofts; cared about having money, or even a place to live. She felt like a liar through and through, a method actress auditioning for a movie without a name.</p><p>
<em> Is this how Agatha feels all the time? </em>
</p><p>That harrowing idea carried her through the suburbs, bright green tree canopies flying by, summer in its full, resplendent blush. </p><p>Everything looked so joyous. Rio felt like a walking corpse on its way to a funeral. </p><p>Death consuming her thoughts, her mind drifted, for the first time that morning, to the plan.</p><p>“Are we still planning on —” She took note of the driver, and decided to soften her wording. “ — <em> taking care </em> of Wanda?”</p><p>Agatha rapped her perfectly-red acrylics on the side of the car before turning to face her with a sly expression. “Why? Are you getting soft on me?”</p><p>Rio’s gut twisted unpleasantly. She took those words in a way that she knew Agatha didn’t mean them. But she felt embarrassed anyway.</p><p>“No.” She looked out the window so she didn’t have to face Agatha, or by association, her emotions. But she ended up ramming headfirst into them anyway – “But I do sort of feel bad for the kid. I don’t exactly take pleasure in taking away someone’s mother.” She paused, and emotion lodged uncomfortably in her throat. “He’s not even a vampire. He doesn’t understand this world.”</p><p>Like herself, those many years ago. Before she’d been dragged by the teeth into immortality.</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply for a moment, and Rio worried she might have said something to anger her, but then she felt a soft hand clasp around her own.</p><p>“I’d never force you to do something you don’t want to do,” Agatha said quietly, almost sweetly, and Rio felt her heart flutter. But then, because Agatha was still Agatha, she added, “Even if Wanda has a very killable face.”</p><p>Rio smiled despite herself. “I believe the expression is <em> punchable, </em> Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha waved her off. “Language evolves.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Does it evolve, actually? Or do you just strangle it into submission?”</p><p>Per usual, that was only half a joke — Agatha had spent the better part of the 17th century Suggesting peasants into learning completely made-up vocabulary. <em> Fopdoodle </em> was her proudest work. Well, her proudest work until she eventually replaced it with <em> nincompoop </em>.</p><p>“Hm. If last night was anything to go by,” Agatha squeezed her hand, then said breathily, “Strangling things into submission feels like your forte, not mine. <em> Wifey.</em>”</p><p>It took everything inside Rio to prevent her mouth from falling clean open. <em> This woman will eventually kill me. This woman will eventually kill me, and I’ll have seen it coming the entire way, until the knife is in my mouth, and I’m thanking her for putting it there. </em> The driver cleared his throat loudly, and turned up the music. Agatha smiled like a witch.</p><p>Outside the window, the cathedral began to crest over the horizon. Hundreds of well-dressed guests peppered courtyards protected by tall stone fencing.</p><p>“Well. If we’re not going to take the Wanda route,” Agatha said, effortlessly gliding through topics as if she hadn’t just sent a full-body shiver down Rio’s spine. “We’re going to have to come up with an alternative way to deal with Ashcroft.”</p><p>Rio eyed the GPS, then the traffic in front of them. The street was clogged like cholesterol in arteries. “Well, we have two minutes until we arrive. You’ve carried out a coup d'etat in less time. So, chop chop.”</p><p>Rio could see Agatha’s brilliant smile in the reflection of the window, and she couldn’t resist anymore, turning to look at her — she was nothing if not a naive fish to a worm, ready as ever to wrap her mouth around the hook. Especially when that hook was as pleasant to look at as Agatha Harkness, suit blouse ruggedly undone on her collarbones, wild hair tamed with a sweet-smelling curl cream.</p><p>Agatha hummed. “Thirty seconds is all I need.”</p><p>“Oh, now we’re getting cocky.”</p><p>“It’s not cocky if it’s true. Put on a timer.”</p><p>“I’m not putting on a timer.”</p><p>Agatha pouted. “Hey Siri, put on a timer—”</p><p>Rio’s phone began to vibrate in her pocket. “You’re so—”</p><p>“—<em>put on a timer for thirty seconds.”</em></p><p>“I’ve set a timer for thirty seconds,” Rio’s phone, the traitor, responded.</p><p>“Thank you Siri,” Agatha said, giving Rio a shit-eating grin, then brought her leg up into the seat, wrapping her arm around it so her chin could sit on her kneecap, as she often did when she needed to think hard on something quickly — it was devastatingly endearing. “Well, if he is her thrall, then the only other way to sever their connection is to put as much distance between them as possible. It’ll make it a lot easier for me to unwind his thoughts that way.”</p><p>Rio squinted at her. “As in, kidnap Richard in broad daylight? Not sure about that one. He’s probably protected by half a dozen ex-military.”</p><p>“That’s where Billy comes in.”</p><p>“The kid?”</p><p>“Mm. We tell him we have a lead in <em> the case</em>,” Agatha snorted. Because she was, well, evil. “But it requires us talking to Daddy Dearest. He’ll introduce us to the big man, get us past his security, then I think — hmm — <em> oh. </em> Oh, oh god. That’s good. God, I’m good.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “What is it?”</p><p>The timer went off the same time that the door opened on Agatha’s side. The driver turned his head to them, and with the most grim expression Rio had ever seen, said, “Please leave.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, then tugged Rio by the hand out into the broad sunlight, and as the rays stung her skin, Rio wasn’t sure what pain was worse — the bright, eviscerating light, or knowing Agatha would eventually let go of her.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>For the fifth time in fifteen minutes, Agatha was sobbing.</p><p>Which, normally – Rio would be concerned. Very concerned.</p><p>But this was Agatha Harkness. And Agatha Harkness, when placed in a situation where she could make fun of as many people as possible, could simply not resist the pleasure.</p><p>“He was so,” Agatha sniffled. “So <em> kind. </em>Such kind eyes. Those little baby blues.”</p><p>Agatha’s current victim, or rather, victims, were a nicely dressed lesbian couple. An asian woman in a suit and high heels, and a black woman wearing a form-fitting green dress. They had introduced themselves as Alice and Jen, but Rio was positive Agatha had no idea what their names were, and would continue to not know, even if they repeated them to her.</p><p>“...And how did you know the deceased?” Alice asked softly.</p><p>“Oh, you know.” Agatha wiped her eyes, which were flush with tears that Rio frankly did not understand how she could produce on command. “Support group.”</p><p>“Support group?” Jen said. “Support for… what?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. Which Rio knew was a sign that she was about to say something incredibly stupid.</p><p>“Porn addiction,” Agatha said solemnly. “It’s what killed him in the end.”</p><p>Yep. Bullseye.</p><p>“Luckily,” Agatha sighed. “My wife has been incredibly supportive.”</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand tighten around her waist, but no matter how desperate Rio was, she was not desperate enough to play a prop in this joke.</p><p>“Sorry. You’ll have to excuse her,” Rio said, smiling tightly. “She’s diagnosed with chronic attention-deficit disorder. As in, she constantly needs attention, or she’ll die.”</p><p>Agatha pouted, as if to say <em> You’re no fun. </em> </p><p>Alice and Jen just stared at them, speechless.</p><p>“We’ll be leaving now,” Rio said. “Nice to meet you both.”</p><p>Jen squinted. “Nice to – uh – sure.”</p><p>Rio paraded the two of them away, tugging a reluctant Agatha behind her.</p><p>“You are a complete disaster,” she said, lips twitching upwards despite herself as she led them towards where the service would actually take place. They’d been lingering at the outskirts of the party for too long, and Rio was growing desperate for this whole charade to end. Human funerals were no fun. Everyone was so miserable, reciting the same bland stories about a man they could have cared less about while he was alive, and worst of all – no one let you inspect the corpse.</p><p>Agatha protested, “Sue me for keeping myself entertained. Rich people are so boring. I can only talk about stocks for so long without wanting to pull someone’s eyes out.”</p><p>As Rio dragged them forward, Agatha nabbed another shrimp cocktail from a wayward waiter. Rio rolled her eyes — only mildly impressed at her dexterity for being able to grab it without spilling. The other woman swallowed it down in two gulps, then tossed it to the grass, like they were at a college rager, not a funeral for the son of a billionaire. They received several looks.</p><p>And truthfully, it wasn’t that Rio was annoyed. There was nothing she enjoyed more than watching Agatha bother people. It was more that she was… concerned? Because even when Agatha got like this, she still knew how to keep the attention off her. </p><p>But she was acting… messy.</p><p>So, she pried. “Really? Littering? Aren’t you supposed to be playing a character?” Rio asked. “Like, a sophisticated aristocrat type? Not a melodramatic frat boy?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m very familiar with sophisticated aristocrats. There’s nothing more aristocratic than making the help’s job harder. Hell froze over if Evanora picked up her own dishes.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Point taken. But still — are you okay? You seem off.”</p><p>Agatha’s frown deepened for a moment before she pursed her lips, then seemed to don a new mask — she gave Rio one of those smiles that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. I’m feeling positively glorious. I just had free steak tartare, three free martinis, a new complementary suit from Zara, and the hottest piece of ass this side of the Atlantic chaperoning me around. Not to mention we’re about to steal the wealthiest pig in all of North America. Just keeping my eyes peeled for that lanky farm boy.”</p><p>By which she meant Billy, who they had yet to find. He’d gotten them on the guest list, so they didn’t need his help to get inside, but he’d all but vanished in the mobs of guests. </p><p>“Oh shit,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on Rio’s hand tightened. But before Rio could check in with her again, ask what had her so spooked, Rio froze — went stock still, fear reaching into her chest and gripping around her heart in a death vice. Because in the middle of the crowd, looking at her with a wide, eerie smile, was a man dressed in a black suit. Tan leather shoes. A face as pale as snow.</p><p>His teeth — <em> fangs </em> — were exposed. His eyes were bright red. He was tall, so tall.</p><p>Rio felt like a child again. She felt small, helpless, so afraid she couldn’t move. Her breaths started to come in harried spurts. Her lungs were constricting. </p><p>It was him again. The man from far away. <em> He should be dead.  </em> He had tricked her parents into letting him stay. He had prayed on their charity. <em> I killed him. I watched him die.   </em></p><p>And yet he was here, alive. Alive and so <em> terrifying. </em>He was going to change her again. He was going to make her into something even worse. A monster beyond recognition. A beast so ugly even Agatha would shudder.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio distantly heard Agatha’s voice, but it was so far away. Wilhelm came closer. The crowds seemed to part like tides around him. His feet were so sure, steady, confident. Rio couldn’t move.</p><p>“Rio. Snap out of it.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice rose steadily. Rio started to cry.</p><p>“I killed him,” she said. “He should be dead.”</p><p>Faintly she felt something warm cup her face. “Honey, he is dead. He’s not real.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrowed. Wilhem took another step. She noticed something strange at the edges of his pants—a frayedness, a distortion. But still, her body was paralyzed.</p><p>“But I see him.” Rio’s entire body trembled. “He’s right there.” More tears fell from her eyes; she found it difficult to speak, her throat closing. “He’s going to do it again. He’s going to —”</p><p>But before she could finish her sentence, Agatha stepped in front of her. Obscured everything behind her, so she was all Rio could see, and Wilhem was gone. And it felt like Rio had been wrenched from the ocean, like she’d been drowning and suddenly she was gasping for breath.</p><p>Then Agatha’s hands wrapped around Rio’s neck, her eyes blinking quickly, her mouth wrapped in concern, and she leaned in. She leaned in and pressed her mouth to Rio like she couldn’t help it, making the smallest, most desperate sound as their lips pressed together.</p><p>“You’re okay, baby,” Agatha whispered against her mouth. “You’re okay. You’re safe.”</p><p><em> Baby. </em> Rio’s ears rung. In one swift moment all the fear in her body had slipped down the drain, replaced instead with an aimless <em> need </em>. With a whimper, she cupped Agatha’s face back. And they kissed just like that — unhurried, simple, sweet; a kiss that wasn’t a pretense to anything — and when Agatha finally withdrew, Rio missed her lips with an ache she’d never felt before.</p><p>When their gaze met, Rio could tell it was doing something to Agatha, too. Because she had that unmoored, distant expression again. The one that looked like fear mixed with a memory. </p><p>“It’s Wanda’s magic,” Agatha said, her hand still wrapped around Rio’s neck. “It wasn’t real. She casts these — these illusions. Makes you see whatever you fear. It’s very annoying.”</p><p>She was still fixated on Agatha’s lips. On the fact that she’d kissed her for a reason that had nothing to do with sex. “Wait, what? She knows we’re here?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Not necessarily. Her magic works passively. Defensively.” Agatha licked her lips. She was still looking at Rio’s. They were equally entranced. “But now that you’ve broken out of it once, it’ll be harder for it to trick you again. You’re okay. It’ll be okay.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. They were still completely attached, limb to limb — Agatha’s hands around her neck, softly playing with the hair there; their bodies pressed together. </p><p>And because Rio was still high on the adrenaline of the nightmare, she felt brave.</p><p>“You kissed me,” she said, quietly.</p><p>Agatha blinked, and whatever fearful illusion she must have seen made her dizzy, too, because she replied before her could defensives could come back online — “I did.”</p><p>Rio inhaled sharply. <em> I’m going to say it. </em></p><p>“It made me feel better.” <em> Say all of it. </em>“Kissing you… makes me feel better.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed roughly. Rio could hear her heartbeat pick up relentlessly in her neck. When she spoke, her voice was small. Like it barely escaped her throat at all.</p><p>“It makes me feel better, too.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip, feeling blood pump deliriously in her veins, making her feel insane and naive and optimistic — because maybe this was the cliff, and maybe she was teetering precariously above it, but maybe Agatha <em> was </em> the chasm, calling her name with open arms, open hands, maybe she had been afraid for no reason at all, maybe Agatha loved her, <em> really </em> loved her, maybe she didn’t have to pretend anymore.</p><p>She was so very bad at pretending.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said shakily, her hands massaging the back of Agatha’s neck, in small circles that she hoped communicated the words she was afraid of saying. “I lo—”</p><p>And then, for the second time that day, Agatha said, her voice wrecked with terror, “Don’t.” She shook her head, pleading. “<em>Please. </em>Don’t.”</p>

<p>“I — wait, <em> don’t what? </em>”</p><p>The confession died in Rio’s throat. She felt like all the wind had been knocked from her chest. Like an ice bucket had been poured over her head. </p><p>She had been so ready to say everything, it was all bursting out of her like a waterfall, but now…</p><p>She glanced at Agatha’s face. At the utter fear set into her brows.</p><p>All Rio felt now was <em> worry. </em>Worry because Agatha was looking at her in utter desperation. </p><p>Her fingers were trembling, her eyes blinking like a woman standing in front of a car accident, watching the engine burst into flames.</p><p>Rio hadn’t even got the full word out, and Agatha was already shutting down.</p><p>
<em> Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She doesn’t want me. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She’s terrified of me. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I miscalculated. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I –  </em>
</p><p>No.</p><p>
<em> Stop running away from your own emotions. You can’t put the cat back inside the bag. It’ll claw its way back out eventually. </em>
</p><p>“Agatha, please,” she said quietly, “You didn’t let me finish.” She frowned when Agatha just grew more panicked. “Agatha, I promise it’s not — it’s not bad. It’s okay. We don’t have to talk about it now. We can talk about it later, once the funeral is over. I didn’t mean to frighten you.”</p><p>That sounded good to Rio’s ears, she thought. Placating. Calming. Even if Agatha didn’t want her, even if she’d read every signal wrong, it didn’t have to be some explosive affair like this. They didn’t have to ruin all their well-laid plans with the nuke that was Rio’s bad timing.</p><p>“That’s not it, Rio,” Agatha responded. “We can’t talk about it at all.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her.<em>   </em></p><p>And because there really was no better way to encapsulate it — “What?”</p><p>“I — the thing you want to say. What you want to discuss. I know what it is. We can’t. We can’t discuss it.” Agatha was repeating the idea like a mantra, biting down on her lip and tapping her foot on the damp grass. “We can’t — I shouldn’t have taken it this far. I got too greedy. I should have known better. Fuck. I always do this to myself. Over and over again.”</p><p>Agatha had started talking to herself as if Rio wasn’t there; as if Rio had faded to the background, and Agatha had entered a different dimension entirely. Rio knew Agatha was evasive, she knew that she was defensive, that she had walls, but this was a step beyond. Refusing to acknowledge something entirely? It wasn’t just aggravating, it was maddening. </p><p>And Rio was starting to get, well, mad.</p><p>Agatha was shaking her head at herself, refusing to look Rio in the eye as she stared back at the street. Black cars were still rumbling toward the gates.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” she muttered. “And at a billionaire’s funeral of all places. Great. Phenomenal.” </p><p>Now Rio was more than mad. She was having that wasp sting of a feeling when someone’s character suddenly started separating from the ideal you had of them in your head, peeling away like chipped paint.</p><p>“I’m sorry my feelings are such an inconvenience to you,” she said icily.</p><p>Agatha startled like a deer at that, looking at her with wide eyes. As if she’d just remembered Rio was, in fact, still there. Still a living, breathing person.</p><p>“You’re never an inconvenience to me,” Agatha replied in a small voice. “Nothing about you ever could be.”</p><p>And it sounded so sweet, so genuine, it gave Rio whiplash.</p><p>What the fuck was going on?</p><p>Agatha continued, shaking her head, “But we can’t do this. We can’t <em> talk about it. </em>I know that must be difficult to hear. To grasp. It’s difficult as fuck for me, too. But we — we can’t discuss it. We can either continue as we were before,” Agatha said, and she looked like every word was adding another pound of stress to her shoulders. “Or we have to stop. Right now. Before…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio cut in, and her voice was loud, louder than she meant it; she only lowered it when they began to get looks again — women in black dresses, men in sharp, judgemental tuxedos. “What in the world are you talking about? If you’re worried about this changing us irrevocably, then… that’s okay. That’s understandable. But it won’t. I know it won’t. Because I’ve had plenty of time to freak out about that possibility. And I – I know in my heart that there’s no topic we could possibly discuss that would change things for us. Even my, <em> especially </em>my… feelings.”</p><p> She inhaled sharply, feeling her eyes start to redden. She felt like a teenager, like a humiliated adolescent, begging in front of her crush. </p><p>She continued, “Even if you don’t feel the same way. That’s fine. I’ll get over it. But you can’t just expect me to keep it all inside, trapped in my skull, spinning and spinning—”</p><p>“Rio,” she snapped. “<em>Stop it.”</em></p><p>Agatha’s eyes, wet with tears, blazed red. Redder than Rio had ever seen them.</p><p>And Rio’s hands suddenly went clammy.</p><p>“Shit,” Agatha cursed. She looked like she’d put her car in reverse instead of drive, and petered right into someone’s brand new cadillac. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to… I can’t control…”</p><p>Then she shook her head, cutting herself off.</p><p>“Clean your mess up, Agatha,” Agatha said to herself, a quiet admonishment as her eyes blazed red again. She began to massage her own arms. “Clean your mess up. Focus. Focus.”</p><p>Agatha’s words sounded tinny and far-away to Rio’s ears. Her vision had begun to go dizzy. And where there was once one Agatha, there were now two. Two frayed copies of a woman in distress, grabbing her softly by the shoulders. Rio’s world felt like it had gone off-axis. </p><p>And in that haze, she began to feel a strange sensation in the back of her skull — a warmth, like water bubbling in from a hot whirlpool. It felt like a drug had been injected into her veins, smooth and soft. Like something was dulling a pain that she could no longer feel.</p><p>She felt good. She smiled dopily. She couldn’t remember why she’d been so scared a moment before. Why would she be scared? Agatha was here. </p><p>Nothing had ever been scary since Rio had met Agatha.</p><p>And then, to make matters even better, Agatha was cupping her cheek, and smiling at her with the saddest, sweetest smile in the world. </p><p>Rio felt so happy seeing it. She felt so adored, to be looked at like that.</p><p>“Rio?” she said softly. “Can you hear me?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Yes?” She could hear nothing else <em> but </em> her, loud and clear.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said, swallowing thickly. “That’s good. Listen closely, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“You are not in love with me.”</p><p>Rio felt a sensation in her mind like a tiny paper cut. As if a small knife was scraping against the great fuzzy feeling that was lifting her up like a cloud. She opened her mouth to say something, to protest, although she was not sure about what, but Agatha cut her off with a nod.</p><p>“I know it might feel like that, but you’re not. You’re confused,” Agatha’s words were tight; they almost sounded pained — she sighed. “What you’re feeling is just friendship. We’re just friends. We’ve always been friends. For six hundred years. Long time, hm?”</p><p> Rio’s eyebrows furrowed, and Agatha began to talk like she was reading a script she’d read a hundred times before. “Nothing has ever been romantic between us. Sometimes we’re attracted to each other, physically, but that’s it. Nothing else. We’re just friends. Do you understand?”</p><p>Rio felt a tide wash over her, then away.</p><p>She nodded slowly. “Okay.” She frowned. “I’m sorry. I must have been confused.”</p><p>Agatha blinked back tears, and shook her head. “Don’t apologize. Never apologize.” She stared at Rio for a long moment, taking a shuddering breath. Something in her expression seemed to move, as if she was setting another version of herself aside. Rio thought it looked strange, like watching an actor disrobe offstage. </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “Do you remember why we’re here?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. Of course she did. Was Agatha messing with her?</p><p>“Um, to secure ourselves a new billionaire bloodbag?”</p><p>Whatever was haunting Agatha seemed to blink away with her answer. She laughed, and clapped Rio on the back, turning toward the procession, where the funeral director had begun to tap a microphone and summon the crowds to the main courtyard.</p><p>“Indeed,” she said breathily. Rio saw her wipe something from under her eye. “Indeed.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Throughout the rest of the funeral, Rio felt very strange. Not that she felt particularly normal most of the time, but something was decidedly <em> off. </em>The scare she’d had with Wanda’s magic was probably to blame, but Agatha was also acting cagey, so that didn’t really help. </p><p>It was hard to explain. She just kept getting these odd blips of deep… Sadness? Uncertainty? </p><p>It was like — the deacon would be speaking, babbling on about what a great man Tommy was, how he volunteered at the soup kitchen on Saturdays (a lie, she had watched Billy scoff every time he saw that pop up in his calendar), how he cared about each and every one of his employees (he didn’t know Rio’s name well enough to scream the right words while she was killing him), and then out of nowhere she’d feel this pain in the back of her skull:</p><p>Not quite physical, not quite mental.</p><p>
<em> It feels like I left the stove on but every time I go to check, it’s off. </em>
</p><p>Rio nudged Agatha with her elbow. “I think I’m getting a migraine.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look back at her when she said, strangely somber, “I’m sorry. It’ll pass.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at her.</p><p>“Thanks for your condolences, weirdo. Do you have any ibuprofen?”</p><p>Agatha laughed coldly. “No. But I’m pretty sure every other person here has coke.”</p><p>“Cocaine at a funeral?”</p><p>“It’s like a cigarette during a lunch break for rich people.”</p><p>Rio hummed. Agatha seemed to be in a dour mood, and Rio wanted so badly to take her out of it. So she tried, “I guess we’ll have to get used to it. Seeing as we’ll be rich people soon.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, but it sounded half-hearted. She was obviously distracted. Maybe she was actually listening to the deacon — <em> unlikely. </em> You’d have to wrap Agatha in a straight jacket to get her to listen to a priest. Religion had never been kind to her, nor Rio. It didn’t tend to smile on…</p><p>Rio frowned.</p><p>Smile on what?</p><p>Her skull pulsed again.</p><p>
<em> Smile on what? </em>
</p><p>Vampires? That didn’t feel right. It was like her brain had surgically removed the rest of the sentence. All that was left was a gaping hole.</p><p>“Agatha,” she whispered quickly, to the chagrin of the people next to them. “What does religion tend to… look down upon?”</p><p>Agatha finally turned to her then — obviously so bewildered by Rio’s question that she couldn’t help it — and frowned at her. “Um, I don’t know. Everything?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were so pretty. Green like the sky. Rio noted to herself to tell Agatha that sometime.  “More specific, please.”</p><p>“Well, let me see. Children out of wedlock?”</p><p>Rio licked her lips. “Not the one I’m looking for.”</p><p>“Lying, theft, greed, excess, gluttony — just about anything fun?”</p><p>A woman cleared her throat behind them. Rio glanced sideways at her with blazing red eyes, and she quickly went quiet.</p><p>“Doesn’t feel right,” Rio mumbled. “Feels more carnal than that.”</p><p>Agatha stilled, and the back of her neck went faintly red.</p><p>“Well, religion isn’t very fond of homosexuals.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. She felt something crack in the back of her mind. Like a rip in a tent. Only what blew in wasn’t air — but a feeling. <em> That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. </em></p><p>She could see the faint silhouette of a memory in her head, crystallizing then. Only, as it was about to take shape, Agatha’s hand wrapped around her wrist, and she tugged at it urgently.</p><p>“I see Billy,” Agatha breathed. “Go time.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>It was nearly the turn of the century, and for the first time in her life, Agatha Harkness did not feel like she was the mud being run over by the heavy carriage of time — she felt like the spoke that was turning the wheel. She felt like the driver, the horses, and the whips.</p><p>Which is to say she felt free. She felt in charge. She felt <em> important. </em> Evanora Harkness was dead, and Rio Vidal killed her. Rio Vidal killed her, and since then they had been glued to the hip, swerving through the middle ages on black steeds, trotting from town to town in search of good food and good trouble, and Agatha had begun to nurse a bit of a crush.</p><p>Nay, worse than that.</p><p>Agatha was terribly and torturously in love.</p><p>And because Agatha was nothing if not direct, she planned on solving this issue in one simple conversation — a conversation which occurred in a tavern somewhere in the middle of Europe, under the dark cape of night. </p><p>The alcohol was hot, the lights were dim, the bar stools were uncomfortable and prickly, and Rio was sitting across from her looking like a fallen angel fresh out of Heaven’s gates.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed, her breath smelling of cranberries and sharp liquor. She propped her chin on her hand, and stared openly at the other woman. “I have a question to ask you.”</p><p>Rio set down her drink and smiled lazily. “Is it if I will get us another round? Because you must know I’ve already run out of money. That nobleman’s pockets were unfortunately light.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha chuckled. “Not that.”</p><p>“Then what, hm?”</p><p>“Do you entertain suitors?”</p><p>Rio blinked at her. She looked caught off guard, but not offended. She had that expression on her face that she got when Agatha was trying to explain an elaborate social rule to her.</p><p>“Entertain… suitors?”</p><p>“I mean to ask if you court. Date. However you’d like to put it.” Agatha tried to make it seem casual by shrugging, but the burn in her cheeks probably ruined her appearance of apathy. “We’ve been traveling for some time now, but I’ve never seen you… take a lover.”</p><p>Agatha had taken one or two or three, here and there. But she had always done it in secret, away from Rio. Agatha’s mother had always insisted that women like her — who preferred the fairer sex — did not exist, so she felt a need to prove her incorrect. And incorrect she had proved her, several times over, to the tune of many happy, <em> loud </em> women in various inns and farmhouses.</p><p>But Rio had never shown an inclination toward, well, anyone. Even when Agatha would test the waters — remark about a beautiful woman, or (reluctantly) about a handsome man — Rio would just shrug and reply something to the effect of, “If you say so,” and then they would move on with their day. Which both made Agatha feel better and worse.</p><p>“I had a lover, once. If you can even call it that,” Rio said, blushing as she took a long sip of her mead. “A boy in my town. In Galicia. He stole a kiss from me. It was not long. Quite wet. Slobbery, like a dog. I would have rather kissed a dog, in all honesty. I pushed him into the river. It did not inspire an interest in romance for me.”</p><p>Agatha laughed at the image of Rio pushing a slobbering boy into a stream. “Really? No interest at all, in hundreds of years? I assure you there are better experiences than that out there.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows rose. “You can assure me? Have <em> you </em> entertained suitors, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha went beet red. <em> Damn it. </em>This woman, and her keen ear.</p><p>“Perhaps,” she said. “Although none of consequence.”</p><p>Rio seemed suddenly much more interested in this discussion. She leaned forward conspiratorially. “Tell me about the inconsequential ones, then.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart beat rabidly in her chest. Rio’s big brown eyes were looking at her with such warmth, such <em> interest, </em> Agatha could imagine for a mere second that she actually wanted to become one of the names on Agatha’s list. That she wanted to become <em> the </em>name. </p><p><em> The </em> person of consequence.</p><p>
<em> Stop dreaming, you scoundrel. </em>
</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, then said brusquely, “I fear you might judge me and cast me aside.”</p><p>Rio looked taken aback, startled. “Cast you aside?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, looking askance. On the stage there was a band playing, a little man with a string instrument, and a handsome woman with a percussive drum. They played loud enough that Agatha could drown out the worries that were spinning around her head. But she could not drown out Rio, who had grabbed her wrist, and pulled it lightly.</p><p>“I would not cast you aside, Agatha,” she said quietly.</p><p>And because Agatha was drunk, she replied, “Even if I were to steal a kiss from you?”</p><p>Rio’s pupils went as wide as saucers.</p><p>“Do you intend to?” she whispered, as if something fascinating was happening in front of her.</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched. </p><p>“Steal one? No.” <em> But I’d take one if it came willingly. </em></p><p>“Hm,” was all Rio said, blinking several times. After a moment, she squeezed Agatha’s hand. “So, what is it? You were going to tell me about your <em> affairs. </em>”</p><p>Agatha deflated. For a flicker of a moment she had fooled herself again.</p><p>But Rio had said it herself. She was uninterested in romance, and Agatha would have to respect that. But that didn’t mean she couldn’t be honest with her. They were still friends after all.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha clicked her tongue, “As long as you promise not to tell the church…”</p><p>She looked back and forth conspiratorially — half an act, half serious — before lowering her voice, and looking at Rio with a sly grin.</p><p>“If you must know,” she said. “I have come to enjoy the company of women.”</p><p> </p><p align="center"> *</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
<b>1544</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They were riding on horses away from a very mysterious fire — one that happened to kill seventeen wealthy noblemen and twelve wealthy noblewomen — when Rio said to her, as if only one month had passed, and not sixty years, “I have been thinking about your question.”</p><p>“What question?” Agatha replied. </p><p>She was disoriented, her pockets full of valuables they had pocketed from the raid.  </p><p>“About suitors. About my… proclivities. Romantically.”</p><p>Agatha nearly stumbled off her steed.</p><p>In sixty years they had not addressed that night once. Well, not explicitly. Agatha had gotten more comfortable taking women into bed in their shared quarters, and Rio had begun to make comments about them. Innocent comments, niceties. But nothing more than that.</p><p>“I think I might, too, enjoy the company of women,” Rio said, casually, as if it was nothing.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw went slack. She was happy that it was night, and the only thing illuminating their way was the torch Rio was holding, because if Rio could see her clearly, the entire jig would be up then and there. The confession was written on her face.</p><p>And then, just as fast, pure jealousy piled into her gut.</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha huffed. “And that realization occurred to you when? Before, after, or during our little killing spree?” <em> Had there been a woman there she’d found charming? </em></p><p>“None of the above.” Rio paused. “You sound upset.”</p><p>“I am not upset. I am merely… bewildered by your timing.”</p><p>“I did not know there was a good time to realize these things.”</p><p>Agatha reeled back her misplaced fury, and sighed. “No, there is not. I’m sorry. Let’s start this again. You want to sleep with a woman?”</p><p>Even in the dark Agatha could see just how red that comment made Rio.</p><p>“Sleep with… I am not sure. I merely… I do not think I like men.”</p><p>That, at least, makes Agatha laugh. “I always knew you were a woman of fine taste.”</p><p>Rio smiled at her. They came upon a hunter’s shack soon enough, dealt with the hunter occupying it, and settled in for the night, raiding his pantry for alcohol and grains.</p><p>Unfortunately the hunter’s bed was quite small, only big enough for one and a half bodies, so they were pressed together that night, forced into a proximity that made Agatha delirious.</p><p>They were at the edge of sleep, looking at each other, illuminated only by the moonlight, discussing the events of the day, when Agatha’s deliriousness caught up with her. “I think,” she said, emboldened by the drink and Rio’s confession. “You should kiss me. To see if you’d like it.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes went wide, and Agatha immediately felt a surge of panic in her gut.</p><p>“To see if you’d like… being with a woman,” she corrected. Then Rio’s eyes went larger, and Agatha realized her error. “I meant only a kiss. Chaste. Nothing more. I won’t — I wouldn’t try anything beyond that of course. I just thought it could be helpful. In your… exploration.”</p><p>And to Agatha’s great dismay, Rio did not just nod her head yes, or even say an acceptable, but crushing, <em> No, thank you. </em> She instead <em> laughed, </em> and gave Agatha a sly smile, repeating her sentiment from years ago, “Are you aiming to steal a kiss from me, Agatha Harkness?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha breathed, her heart clenching. “Not steal.”</p><p>
<em> I want you to want it. I need you to want it. </em>
</p><p>Her thoughts must have shown on her face, because Rio’s smile slowly faltered at Agatha’s earnestness. Her face was overtaken with a foreign expression that Agatha had never seen before. </p><p>One that looked truly startled — scared. <em> Frightened. </em></p><p>And Agatha promptly panicked.</p><p>
<em> Oh god. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I’ve frightened her. </em>
</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. Her chest felt heavy, breathless.</p><p>
<em> She’s going to leave me. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She’s going to run and leave me and despise me. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I’m going to be alone again. </em>
</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to say something, but before she could, Agatha’s eyes burned bright red, and she did something she swore she’d never do to Rio, not on purpose. Something she knew once she began to do, she would never really be able to undo — a pattern which could turn Rio into that thrall in Evanora’s basement, the one she’d been trying to forget for centuries afterward.</p><p>But because she was selfish and in love and afraid, Agatha did it anyway, and told her it would just be this one time. <em> Just once, then never again. </em></p><p>“You are asleep,” Agatha said in a rush of words, pressing her hand to Rio’s forehead. “You are having a very strange dream about me. One that you won’t recollect in the morning.”</p><p>Rio’s eyelids began to get heavy. Agatha blew out a warm, unsteady breath of relief.</p><p>
<em> It’s working. It’s working. </em>
</p><p>Rio slowly fell into the caress of sleep, and Agatha watched her for half the night afterwards, wrapped up in a whirlpool of guilt and rejection. A deadly cocktail that only waded away the next morning, when she awoke to Rio’s arm wrapped around her middle, and the other girl smiling this strange little grin, nudging her nose into her cheek.</p><p>“I had the most wonderful dream,” she hummed. “You were in it.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha put on her mask, and schooled her face. <em> It’s not what you want it to be. A woman has hundreds of dreams in a night. </em> “Tell me about it?”</p><p>Rio laughed into her neck. Her breath was as cold as the air outside.</p><p>“I can’t remember what happened, exactly,” she said. “Only that it ended too soon.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>As Agatha dragged her toward Billy, Rio’s mind felt like an open wound.</p><p>Flits of memory were seeping out like bloodstains. </p><p>They were so brief, like one-second films. Agatha’s face over the centuries — smiling, teeth bared, laughing, full-bodied, head thrown back. Agatha in the dim light of a pub, in the broad light of day, blood on her face, murder on her hands. </p><p><em> Why are you showing me this now, </em> she asked to her brain, seeing no red thread between the memories. The only thread was Agatha.</p><p>“I think Wanda’s magic messed with me,” Rio confessed.</p><p>Agatha’s grip on her hand tightened but she did not look back. They threaded through men and women, shouldering through the crowd, getting nasty looks from every direction.</p><p>“How so?” Agatha said quietly.</p><p>Rio could see Billy’s broccoli-like curls now. He was standing on the outskirts of the service, leaning on the stone fencing, smoking a cigarette. It looked like it might as well have been his first cigarette ever from the way his mouth puckered like he’d just tasted acid.</p><p>“It’s like someone keeps rapidly changing the channel in my brain. I keep visualizing things I don’t mean to visualize.” As she said the words aloud, Rio frowned. “I think this has happened before but I can’t place it. Have we run into the Maximoffs before this?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply, dragging her even more quickly towards the boy. They skidded to a stop in front of him, and his eyes widened. He panicked, throwing the cigarette to the ground and stomping on it with his dress shoe. A dress shoe that was also too large for him, slipping at the heel. His entire ensemble was like that — an unfitting tan coat, too-tight dress pants.</p><p> Agatha rolled her eyes. “Jesus, kid. We’re not your parents.” She eyed his jacket pocket, which was bulging with the cigarette container. “Having a vice actually makes you almost likeable. Dampens the whole obsessive dorky thing. Now hand one over, pretty please.”</p><p>He mumbled, “You’re not supposed to smoke here.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and ignored his hypocrisy, digging the cigarette packet out of his pocket, plucking a Lucky Strike out and then making a <em> gimme </em> gesture with her hands for a lighter. He gave her a scandalized expression before finally handing it over. She lit it quickly, tapping her foot anxiously as the smoke clouded. Rio gave her a bewildered look.</p><p>
<em> She’s nervous. Why is she so nervous? </em>
</p><p>“We need to talk to your step-dad,” Agatha said, sans all her usual evasiveness. She usually preferred to disorient her conversational partner into giving her what she wanted. This time, it was straight to the point, no lubrication. It was almost concerning. “We’ve talked to a bunch of funeral guests and it’s looking more and more like he’s our guy. So we need to get some one-on-one time with him. Think you can get us past those guards?”</p><p>Agatha gestured toward the flank of human-beef in tuxedos that was standing nondescriptly at the far north of the reception, beyond the deacon and the body. </p><p>Billy looked suddenly incredibly nervous. Which was saying something, because he always looked incredibly nervous. “You really think it was Richard who did it?”</p><p>Agatha said something in response, Rio saw her lips move, but she couldn’t hear the words. And Billy must have said something back, because he was giving a somber shake of his head, and beginning to turn on his heel to walk towards them. </p><p>Rio frowned. </p><p>
<em> What the hell is going on?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Why can’t I hear them? </em>
</p><p>Her brain was — it wasn’t working. </p><p>It felt like a slowly dying machine. She couldn’t hear the present. Like the audio cord had been snipped. Instead it kept showing her pictures of the past, over and over and over and over, like a rapidly flitting film reel. All the same moments, regurgitated, again and again.</p><p>Agatha in dark robes at the peak of a mountain, Austrian alps at her back.</p><p>Agatha next to her in bed in a cabin. Flush to her body. So close she could feel Agatha’s breath on her cheek, Agatha’s red lips curling into a smile.</p><p>Agatha in Bucharest. In the night. They’re running from the guards. <em> Why are we running? </em>They did something bad. They killed a man — no, not just any man. A very significant man. They killed him and now they were running for their lives. They got out of sight, dodged into an alleyway. Agatha looked beautiful pressed up against the wall, her hands stained with blood, her hair wet from the rain. Rio wanted to run her hands through it. She refrained. Agatha stared at her with a strange expression on her face, a deeply thoughtful one.</p><p>Then Agatha said something Rio couldn't hear. And then Agatha kissed her.</p><p>Back in the present, Rio dropped her cocktail glass. It shattered on the ground.</p><p>
<em> She kissed me. </em>
</p><p>Rio searched her mind like a feral hound for what came next. But after that kiss was a blank slate. Rio tried to find the next memory on the docket, but time seemed to skip forward, and suddenly she was in the North. In Denmark. Norway? She was watching the Borealis. They were underwhelming. She was writing letters to Agatha while Agatha was in Romanian prison. </p><p>Agatha was in prison because she was found kissing another woman. </p><p>
<em> No, not another woman. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She kissed me. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She kissed me and then I left and she threw herself in prison. </em>
</p><p>
<em> That makes no sense. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Why did I leave? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Why did she kiss me? </em>
</p><p>Her mind hurt so badly. It was like she’d had a geyser suppressed under a pot lid, and with the lid gone, hot, molten water was spilling out like a fire hose. She squatted to the ground, jaw clenching and unclenching as she massaged her temples.</p><p>Then, a booming voice. “William, what is the meaning of this?” </p><p>“Richard, these are my coworkers, Agnes and uh —”</p><p>“Your coworkers? Your brother is dead. I am in no mood to socialize.”</p><p>“Rio.” It was Agatha’s voice now, high and concerned. “Rio, breathe, breathe. It’s okay.”</p><p>A new voice echoed. A woman’s, high and lilting. “Billy, there you are. I was looking all over for — Agatha?”</p><p>“Oh, for fuck’s sake.”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness?”</p><p>“Harkness? Wanda, what kind of filth did you drag into my son’s funeral?”</p><p>“Calm down, Richard.”</p><p>“Rio, we’re leaving. Rio, deep breaths. Come on.”</p><p>Rio had the faint notion that she was being picked up. Hauled into Agatha’s arms and transported on foot through the crowds, pushing noisily past the body, possibly toppling over several flower arrangements. </p><p>Everything was a blur until she heard the sound of a taxi rolling up on the pavement, and there was that other woman’s voice again, following them around like the plague. She still couldn’t see anything, but she could hear what sounded like a budding argument.</p><p>“Agatha, we need to talk.”</p><p>“Not the time, ginger Dracula. Get the fuck out of my way.”</p><p>Wanda seemed to ignore her comments completely. “I heard rumors about the spell you had on Ms. Death Incarnate, but it was hard to believe anyone could have tamed the beast herself. Seeing it with my own eyes I’m still not sure I believe it. Murder herself, a thrall.”</p><p>“She’s <em> not </em> a thrall.” Rio could feel the tension in Agatha’s hands as she held her. “Do you want me to put you into the ground right now, or later? Because it’s looking increasingly like right now,” Agatha spat. Rio felt a wave of nausea, and began to groan. Agatha paused, panicking. “Oh god, she’s going green. Oh god. Rio, breathe. Breathe. Fuck. Fuck.”</p><p>“Her brain is melting. Did you unwind her?”</p><p>“No. She’s — I don’t know what’s happening. But her brain is <em> not </em> melting. I didn’t unwind her. She’s just… recovering.”</p><p>“Recovering from your tampering, you mean,” Wanda said. It didn’t sound judgmental, but she did punctuate it with a click of her tongue. “Do you want my help or would you like her to die in the backseat of some taxi? I’d pick quickly, before fate picks for you.”</p><p>Nausea consumed her, and Rio threw up onto the pavement. Agatha sucked in a breath.</p><p>“Baby, it’s okay. It’s okay.” Agatha began to sound desperate. Rio’s mind spun around <em> baby, baby, baby. </em> “How in the hell are <em> you </em> going to help?”</p><p>“I can give you time to unwind her properly.” Rio heard the car’s engine rev. “Consider it a favor that I’ll cash in at a later time.”</p><p>“No, no, <em> no. </em> I – I can’t unwind her. It might kill her. Don’t you think I would have done it already if I thought I could do it safely? Do you really think I keep her like this because I <em> want </em> to?” Agatha’s voice broke. “I only did this once – <em> once </em> – on purpose. Every time after has been – has been out of my control. And then it stacks and it <em> stacks. </em> And the more it stacks, the deeper the lies penetrate the mind, the harder it is to – to — <em> I can’t stop it, Wanda. </em>”</p><p>“Agatha.” Wanda’s voice dropped lower. “The shell can’t contain her anymore. You don’t have a choice in the matter. Either you watch her die, or you at least say you tried.”</p><p>A long drawn out silence filled the air. Rio’s mind buzzed like a construction site. Black flashes paraded behind her eyes. She felt herself heading for certain destruction. Fast and fiery, like a racecar who’d lost a wheel, and was now dragging its metal body across the pavement.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio mumbled into the air. “Please.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p>“Okay,” she said. “Wanda, <em> do it. </em>”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Rio woke up in their Airbnb. All the shades were drawn, so it was completely dark.</p><p>She could feel a warm compress laid over her forehead. Her entire body was beaded with sweat, sticking to the couch cushions. Her surroundings filtered in slowly, and then all at once.</p><p>She took in a sharp breath.</p><p>“Fuck,” she breathed. “I’m alive.”</p><p>The last thing she remembered was Wanda and Agatha’s conversation at the car. She felt instant, deep-seated relief that she remembered that at all.</p><p>Because that meant she also remembered everything else.</p><p>Well, <em>everything</em> was incredibly relative — she had begun to understand that there were holes the size of craters in her mind, and they weren’t of her own making.</p><p>She had always assumed that it was time that eroded her memory — but now she couldn’t tell the difference between life’s natural degradation and the surgical scars Agatha had inflicted on her over the years. She could hardly believe that was the truth, that Agatha had really cut her mind open and stitched her back, placing falsity after falsity, laying blankets over the wrinkles of her brain. Over and over. For who knows how long. </p><p>Rio expected to feel disgust at what Agatha had made her into. Raw and vitriolic. She expected to feel a rage that filled her chest to the point of flowing over.</p><p>But instead she just felt empty as a carcass.</p><p>Like her brain had been put in water, and was floating, floating. She got the sensation that if it wasn’t for Wanda’s magic, she’d be somewhere else right now. In the beyond.</p><p>But she wasn’t there yet. Instead, she was here, feeling close to that tether — but not quite there. Death’s doorstep, her hand on the knob, but the door remained firmly closed. </p><p>It reminded her of something one of the priests in Galicia said to her. One of the old men in robes that liked to lurk at the bakery and bother her with a life lesson.</p><p>She’d thought him silly then, but she saw his point very clearly now. His point about how, at the end of one’s life, we resent people not for what they did to us — but for the lacking nature of their explanations. </p><p>We resent the parent who neglected us without reason, yet we pity, and sometimes even adore, the parent who neglected us while he toiled for money for our food. While he pursued his passions at our expense. It is not the action, it is the reasoning behind it. </p><p>Rio did not fancy herself a psychologist. But she couldn’t resist the notion that what burned in her chest was not anger, but a curiosity — a <em> need to know </em> — as fierce as the sun. She gripped her fingers around the back of the couch, and began to lean forward.</p><p>
<em> I have to believe she didn’t do this on purpose. </em>
</p><p>This was Agatha. This was the girl who learned how to Suggest by <em> un </em>-suggesting.</p><p>This was the woman who would break thralls out of their stupor because she hated to see someone innocent put under that kind of spell.</p><p>
<em> She isn’t her mother. She isn’t Evanora. </em>
</p><p><em>   </em>“Don’t get up. Please. Just stay on the couch.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice gave her a jolt. She sounded incredibly exhausted, more exhausted than Rio had ever heard her, even when they’d been near-death in the woods outside Bucharest.</p><p>She disobeyed Agatha’s instructions and leaned upward, cringing when her entire body ached in response. Still, she made it to a seated position just in time for Agatha to round the couch, brows knitted in worry as she set down a tea cup by the table. </p><p>“I told you to stay still.”</p><p>“And I don’t know if listening to you is the best idea for me.”</p><p>Agatha froze at that, at Rio’s tone.</p><p>“Rio, I — I promise I didn't mess with too much. It's only a few memories, a handful, over six hundred years — okay, two handfuls, but —”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Agatha, I don’t want an apology right now. I’m sure I deserve one. Knowing you, I potentially deserve thousands. But you are terrible at them, and I am flirting much too comfortably with death, so please spare me my time on Earth for other, more useful things,” she finished, then grabbed Agatha’s palm, tugging her toward her. </p><p>Agatha, eyes wide, fell to the side of the couch, and just stared, and stared, like a frightened child. As if Rio was the thing that consumed her—and not the other way around. </p><p>And maybe that’s how Agatha saw it. Maybe Rio had been the one terrorizing <em> her </em>, somehow. Maybe Agatha had been protecting herself from something Rio couldn’t understand.</p><p><em> Maybe, maybe, maybe </em>. Maybes were the problem here. </p><p>Rio did not know what words she was going to say until she was saying them, “I want you to tell me everything, from the beginning, right from the moment we met, until now. Everything you suppressed. Every reason why. And then I will decide if I want to kill you, or kiss you.”</p><p>Agatha stilled. Blinked. A single tear streaked down from her eye.</p><p>“Releasing it all —” Agatha paused. “It might kill you.”</p><p>Rio knew very well that could be true. Agatha had told her what happened to that one thrall she released from Evanora’s control. How Agatha had been trying everyday to forget it. Rio knew what could happen when you tampered too much.</p><p>And yet. </p><p>“I’d rather die knowing you,” she said, “Than die feeling like I never did.”</p>

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio had always wondered what might it feel like to feel death close at hand. </p><p>She had gotten her closest taste in starvation, back in the weeds outside Bucharest, lying hand in hand with Agatha in the field as they listened to the vampire hunters a few leagues off, crossbows cocked, stakes in hand. Two predators, reduced to prey. </p><p>What had been most surprising to Rio was how sweet the air had tasted then. When your body is reduced to nothing, when you’ve been wrung like a rag, everything — the air, the taste on your tongue, the thoughts on your head — takes on a faint cotton candy feeling. Nothing feels scary anymore. It just feels floaty — it feels <em> funny, </em>like a cosmic joke God is cracking at the end.</p><p>She remembered the way Agatha’s hand had tightened around hers then, and how the last thing she’d said, before Rio blacked out, had been a joke. A stupid one, about bees. They both laughed at it like schoolchildren, silly with the delusion that everything would be okay.</p><p>Rio remembered feeling her heart swell so big, it was a miracle she survived it.</p><p>Now felt different. But it also felt the same.</p><p>Because no matter how much she wanted to be angry at Agatha, all she could do was watch her lips, and wait for the joke that it would make it all better again.</p><p>“Before we begin, I have to lay a few ground rules,” Agatha huffed, because even in the face of maybe her greatest personal sin, she still had the audacity to be annoyed at logistics. “One, you can’t ask me anything about any of the memories until it’s over. <em> Completely </em> over. And two, you can’t die on me. Graveyard slots in New York City are way out of our budget, and Willy’s money supply has already run as dry as the Sahara.”</p><p>And there it was. Agatha’s favorite coping mechanism – making light of an incredibly non-light situation — but Rio didn’t have the energy to engage with it, her lips heavy like dumbbells. Believe her, she tried; she got halfway to opening her mouth and saying <em> His name is Billy, and the reason that money is gone is because you spent it on shoes, </em> when she got another flash of black, and she winced, pressing her hand to forehead. Agatha immediately grabbed her shoulder.</p><p>“Fuck, okay, okay, fuck,” Agatha repeated out loud, apparently trying to center herself by using as many expletives as humanely possible. She began to mutter to herself again. “Don’t kill her because you can’t keep your big fucking mouth shut for two seconds. Concentrează-te.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, and blew out a slow breath.</p><p>When her eyes snapped open again, they were burning bright, lava red. Lava being the apt word — because a red current was swirling around her pupils, clockwise. Like a serpent.</p><p><em> So this is what unwinding looks like, </em>Rio thought.</p><p>The process of un-thralling the thralled.</p><p>Peeling back duct-tape wrapped around the subconsciousness.</p><p>She’d only seen Agatha do it a handful of times, all within a week of their first meeting. Once Evanora was dead, Agatha insisted on freeing all her long-time servants — all except for one.</p><p>The doorman. </p><p>Rio had asked why. It seemed a strange decision, given that Agatha had been especially close to him. She had insisted that he and their late maid, Elisabeth, had raised her more than her own mother had. But back then, Agatha had refused to meet her eyes when she answered the question, <em> “He’s buried too deep.” </em> </p><p>Agatha had instead left him the keys to the castle, given him a kiss to the cheek, and a simple final instruction — Live, or at least try to.</p><p>As Agatha’s gaze latched onto her, Rio wondered if she was the same. </p><p>
<em> Buried too deep. </em>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t give her long to contemplate it, snapping her fingers in front of Rio’s face to grab her attention. Rio startled. She hadn’t realized she’d faded out, gone somewhere else. From the worried look on Agatha’s face, that <em> somewhere </em> probably looked a little too much like death.</p><p>“Listen up. When I begin, you will experience the memories as if you are living them for the first time. They’ll feel like dreams, but more visceral,” she instructed. When Rio arched her eyebrow, as if to say, <em> how do you know, </em>Agatha muttered, “I tried it on myself once.”</p><p>“You did? When?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “We can talk about this <em> after</em>, Rio.”</p><p>“I’d like to know now,” Rio breathed, realizing with a quiet rush of urgency that she wasn’t ready, “Actually, not only that. I’d like to ask a few questions before you open me up.” </p><p>“Rio, we don’t have —” Agatha raised her voice, then paused, realizing, most likely, that she did not want to spend her last moments with Rio yelling at her, even if it was tempting, “Wanda’s magic isn’t infinite. She’s distorting the space inside of your brain to slow down the deterioration. But I’m not sure by how much. Or for how long. So time is, well, <em> of the essence.</em>”</p><p>“And yet you seem very comfortable wasting it by arguing with me.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her, utterly speechless, enough to just shake her head, then make a defeated <em> fine </em> gesture with her hands.</p><p>“Even in death you’re insufferable. Fine, out with it, quickly.”</p><p>“Answer my first question,” Rio said adamantly, refusing to let her own indecision show.</p><p>Because she knew Agatha was right. That she was wasting time. But the truth was she’d never been in a position before where she knew that she could ask Agatha something, and she’d answer with the truth. All of the truth. The woman was a closed book with a lock and a picket fence.</p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath, and looked toward the fridge as she said, “Fine. I – When I used Suggestion on myself, I was trying to forget the memory of what I did to Elisabeth. It didn’t work. Big surprise. You can’t suppress your own shit. I would have been better off ramming my head repeatedly against the wall or letting Evanora give me a concussion. Next.”</p><p>Rio’s gut twisted. Even though a part of her was mad at Agatha beyond belief, betrayed and tender, she still couldn’t resist saying, “You didn’t <em> do </em> anything to Elisabeth. It’s not your fault that Evanora suppressed her so deeply that she couldn’t handle coming out of that shell.”</p><p>Agatha laughed coldly, and Rio could tell her attempt at comfort had slid around Agatha’s body like oil to water. “Your unending empathy is as flattering as it is concerning, but it <em> was </em>my fault. It was my decision. I could have just left her alone. She seemed happy enough as she was. But I couldn’t resist. I wanted to make her whole. It was selfish. All because I can never keep my stupid, insatiable fingers off of something, even if it means ruining it completely.”</p><p>“Is that how you feel about me? Like I’m something you’re scared to ruin?”</p><p>Agatha’s face faltered.</p><p>“I —” She frowned. Rio could see a hundred different masks threaten to shove their way into her expression. In any other situation they would. But in this one, Agatha just breathed, “Yes.”</p><p>Rio laughed, and the movement in her chest caused her whole body to shudder in pain, but she still managed out, “And you call me insufferable. You’ll kill an innocent man for an Amazon gift card, but in other regards you hold yourself to the moral standards of the Pope.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “Sue me for considering you more important than a man.”</p><p>“What <em> do </em> you consider me, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha frowned at the question, and picked up the tea she’d set aside for Rio. “This is getting cold. You should drink it before it’s freezing —”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>” Agatha inhaled sharply, desperately, meeting her eyes with a fierceness. “We’re being reckless. Opening the wound ahead of the unwinding… It’s a bad idea. You need to be in the right state of mind. And you’re already deteriorating.”</p><p>“For the love of God, Agatha, stop trying to protect me!” Rio snapped. “I could die in a minute. Just tell me. Let me in.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened.</p><p>“I’ll answer any other question.”</p><p>“No. That’s my only one.”</p><p>Agatha’s foot had begun tapping erratically on the carpet. “You’re going to die if we don’t hurry this along, Rio. Are you suicidal?”</p><p>“Not yet, but I’ll get there if you don’t give me a straight answer for once in your goddamn life.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands were shaking, trembling. </p><p>“Fine, then, I consider you a royal, <em> aching </em>, pain in my ass —”</p><p>“<em>Agatha. </em>”</p><p>And then, like a shaken bottle exploding from the cap, Agatha screamed, covering her head with her hands, dragging her fingers along her cheeks. The tea mug collapsed onto the rug, green liquid spilling like a tide. Rio’s mouth fell open in surprise. Because Agatha had completely lost her cool — had abandoned it on the side of the highway, left to fester.</p><p>Rio had never seen her look so reckless. Her facial expressions so rabid and unschooled, her fingers trembling.</p><p>Then, a moment later, Agatha’s shoulders slumped. Her hands slowly descended down her face, revealing her jaw, clenched back in place, her eyes hollow. The only hint that she was still undergoing anything at all was the way her neck bobbed—the way her voice was thick and salty.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said coldly, then inched forward on the couch. Her hand wrapped around Rio’s leg, then slunk up to her thigh, bracketed her hips, and suddenly Agatha was on top of her, knees on either side of Rio’s thighs, head looming over Rio’s like a gargoyle. “But I’m going to take away your agency, one last time, because you talk too much.”</p><p>She threaded her hands through Rio’s hair, keeping her skull in place, then looked deeply into her eyes. And for a moment a bit of tenderness seeped through — a look that said <em> I can’t promise you much, but I’ll promise I’ll miss you if I lose you </em>— and then before Rio could say anything to that, Agatha’s red eyes spun like a hurricane, and Rio was pulled into the eye of the storm.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>The first time it happened, they were in a hunter’s cabin. Rio didn’t recall this memory at all. It had to have been the deepest, most buried seed. The root of the tree.</p><p>It was night, and it was cold, and their bodies were pressed close like two dogs huddled for warmth, and Agatha told her to kiss her. Rio’s heart had beaten so fast in reply that she didn’t know what to do with it. She didn’t understand <em> why </em> it was trying to leap out of her chest. </p><p>
<em> It’s just a kiss. She’s just being nice. She’s just being Agatha. </em>
</p><p>Rio had stared at her friend’s pretty face and knew immediately that she did want to kiss her. It wasn’t a question of want, it was a question of <em> how much </em> and <em> how long </em>. </p><p>Because she got the uncanny feeling in her chest that her desire would immediately outweigh Agatha’s, that the moment Rio touched her lips to Agatha’s, she’d be desperate up to the very second that Agatha withdrew, and she’d miss it for every moment afterwards.</p><p>So she said something stupid. Something like, “Are you aiming to steal a kiss from me, Agatha Harkness?” And Agatha had obviously hated that — for a reason Rio couldn’t understand, Agatha had hated it so much that she pressed her hand to Rio’s mind and trapped it in a dream.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>The second time, Rio remembered the faint outline of the memory. </p><p>They were traveling in the early 1800s, on one of the first passenger locomotives. The train was so noisy Rio had stuffed cotton in her ears, and Agatha was fiercely journaling across from her, one leg hoisted up to the seat, a notebook pressed against it, a pen in the other.</p><p><em> She looks stupidly lovely, </em> was what Rio thought at the time, and also now. She was younger, before the first age lines had settled in, wearing a long black dress, leather boots, and a tan winter jacket that draped lazily around the seat, deterring other passengers. It was one of those fancy ones only the rich could afford. Agatha had stolen it off some Swedish princess.</p><p>“What are you writing?” Rio asked.</p><p>“A book,” Agatha said, not looking up. Then, she paused, in thought. “No, a manifesto. That’s a better name. More arresting. I want something that will get people out of their seats.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I thought books were for getting people <em> in </em>seats.”</p><p>“Not this one.” Agatha smirked, then raised her head, turning the notebook around so Rio could see. The original title was <em> A Book On Common-Ownership </em> , but book had been crossed out, and the title rearranged underneath, so now it was named <em> The Common-Ownership Manifesto. </em>“I’m conducting an experiment. A bit more ambitious than my usual ones.”</p><p>She tapped the pen to her chin, and it dabbed a blip of ink there. Rio stared at it as Agatha continued, “I thought it’d be interesting to see if I could change the societal order of things around by suggesting a minimal number of people. Just slip this into the pockets of a few prominent leaders and see what might happen. We’re heading to France soon, so maybe I’ll start there.”</p><p>She shrugged, then tossed the notebook onto the table. Rio’s eyes slid down to the page, where a few other ideas had been crossed out before this one. There was one called <em> See the Maximoffs about the California Gold Rush. </em>Rio squinted at it.</p><p>“The Maximoffs,” she breathed. “Who are they?”</p><p>Agatha had her hand raised, flitting it around obnoxiously to try and wave down one of the staff members. “Old enemies of Evanora. The wife Wanda is an on-and-off pen pal of mine,” Agatha said simply. “Last I heard they were getting friendly with President Polk. It seems there’s going to be a lot of shiny minerals flowing into that most western state of theirs, and since we’re hit a bit hard as far as our financials, I thought, maybe…”</p><p>Agatha made a noncommittal gesture with her hands, and then brightened when an attendant finally noticed her aggressive waving. </p><p>“Finally. I’ve been trying to get your attention for hours, I was scared my shoulder would soon sustain a permanent injury,” Agatha huffed. Rio had been counting — the other woman had been waiting approximately fifteen seconds. “Two coffees, please. Don’t go light on the sugar. And three pastries. Any kind. Preferably with jam.”</p><p>The attendant nodded with an apology, and scurried off. A minute later he was back with their food, Agatha paid him with a dizzying bat of her eyelashes, and soon enough they were tucking into it ravenously like a pack of wolves. It’d been many hours since they’d last eaten, the trains were horribly slow and made a hundred stops heading southward, and by the time they were done, both their faces were covered with a dusting of powdered sugar.</p><p>“You’ve got —” Rio gestured with an amused smile to Agatha’s face, which was now the victim of both pen ink and various schmutz, “Here, let me.”</p><p>She pushed their empty dishes to the side and leaned over the table. The train rocked at the exact moment she meant to steady herself, and she fell forward, knocking her forehead against Agatha’s. It was a hard hit — enough to make them both wince — and dizzying enough that Rio accidentally brushed her lips up against Agatha’s when she meant to withdraw.</p><p>The sound Agatha made was something between a startle and a whimper at the contact, and Rio’s eyebrows flung upward, blinking quickly. “Oh – I’m sorry.”</p><p>When she withdrew, Agatha was staring at her, cheeks flushed, and eyes red as saucers.</p><p>And not just red, but swirling.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio said, brow furrowing. “Are you—”</p><p>In the memory, Rio felt herself freeze. But since she was reliving it now, simply a passenger, an external viewer, she could see the aftermath. Her body slumped to the side, and she fell asleep. Another memory subjugated into a dream. Meanwhile, Agatha’s hands whisked up to her face, looking completely shocked.</p><p>“Rio— I didn’t mean to—” she mumbled. “Oh god, what did I do?”</p><p>When Rio awoke, hours later, Agatha had a vacant look in her eye. Back then, she didn’t know why. Now she was beginning to.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The next time she kissed Agatha, it wasn’t a mistake.</p><p>It was soon after, maybe only a decade, and even though Rio’s mind didn’t remember their accidental kiss, it was almost like her body did. They were visiting Riegersburg for the first time in three hundred years to fetch an old heirloom of Agatha’s. </p><p>They were tight on funds (some things never change) and Agatha insisted one of Evanora’s old scrolls could sell for a pretty penny on the vampire black market. Rio didn’t even know there <em> was </em> a vampire black market, but then again Rio didn’t care to know many things about vampires — she left the socializing to Agatha.</p><p>Rio had brought her daguerreotype camera on the trip, excited to capture the plunging valleys and rising mountains that she remembered seeing from Riegersburg. The view from the castle after she’d killed the Harkness clan had been one of her favorite memories. </p><p>Not for the killing, even though the revenge was truly sweet, but because it was her very first memory with Agatha—the other vampire holding her blood-stained hand as they looked out over the landscape, and knew that this Earth belonged to them now. </p><p>That memory was like an aphrodisiac, one that made Rio feel giddy and stupid as she followed Agatha around the courtyard, snapping pictures as Agatha made small talk with the castle’s current custodians. </p><p>They weren’t thralls — Agatha didn’t keep thralls — but they were as close as you could get, which meant they were well-paid employees. Agatha gave them salaries higher than twice the median Austrian average, which meant they didn’t question where the money came from, or why their boss seemed to never age through the decades.</p><p>“Here it is,” Agatha said with a breath of relief. They were in the attic, moonlight seeping through as Agatha finally pried the top off an old chest. The claustrophobic space smelled like dust and old wood, and it was oddly comforting. Even more so with Agatha there. </p><p>Rio was busying herself by toying with old daggers —the Harkness’s had their faults, but taste in weaponry was not one of them — when Agatha crawled up to her in the tight space, and proudly displayed the scroll.</p><p>Rio hummed, taking it, “So this is that old-fashioned magic you were telling me about?”</p><p>The scroll looked like a business contract, only hundreds of years old, and written in runes and hieroglyphs.</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha said, taking it back from her, wrapping it up, and securing it tightly with a string. “Mass Suggestion contracts. Lets you brainwash a whole trove of sorry idiots at once, all you have to do is get them to sign the paper. Mother sparingly used scrolls like these, too much overhead, but she did collect them for <em> rainy days </em>, so to speak. You know, when she wanted to stamp out a peasant movement, or any kind of discussion about civil rights…”</p><p>Rio smiled tightly. “Charming woman, Evanora.”</p><p>Agatha barked out a laugh. If Rio had been focused on the actual contract at that time, she would have probably burned it then and there. Not let Agatha sell it to the highest bidder.</p><p>But like many times in both the past and the future, she was looking at nothing but Agatha. Who, despite the fact that she should be excited that they dug up such a prize, looked nothing but forlorn, distraught. Lost in thought. She was staring out the small box window, looking at the full moon, with her arms wrapped around her legs.</p><p>Rio crawled toward her, sidling up to her side and putting her head on Agatha’s shoulder. She could feel the other woman melt against her. It made Rio’s heart beat in that odd way.</p><p>“Your mother is gone,” Rio whispered. “She’s not in this room. She’s not in this castle. She’s not on this Earth. Well — that might be a stretch. Morsels of her corpse are under the ground, probably feeding a family of worms. But that’s the limit of her reach, darling. Worms.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move, didn’t respond, for a moment. The only sound was her boot tapping nervously on the floor. Then her hand snaked up Rio’s back, pulling her in closer, so Rio was pressed fully flush to Agatha’s side. Rio could hear Agatha’s blood rush under skin—faster than usual, hectic, her heart had to have picked up pace.</p><p>“How did you know?” Agatha replied quietly.</p><p>“You’re more readable than you think you are. Did you know you always tap your foot when you’re nervous?”</p><p>Agatha laughed quietly. “Thanks for letting me know. I’ll make sure to destroy all my tells.”</p><p>“Please don’t,” Rio said, lips twitching up. “I prefer you this way.”</p><p>“Sad?”</p><p>“Honest.”</p><p>Agatha turned to her head to look at her. Her fangs were biting down on her bottom lip, like a dam sitting in front of a waterfall, and her eyes were glassy. Rio could see the reflection of the moon in her eyes. Two full white pearls.</p><p>“I’d have to disagree. Honesty doesn’t become me,” Agatha said, brushing under her eye with a wet laugh. “I’m such an ugly crier. Like a smudged painting.”</p><p>Rio laughed, disagreeing so completely that she said something rash — one of those thoughts that leaves you before you can think better of it. </p><p>“If you were a painting, I’d be one of those strange men trying to kiss it when the museum guards are looking the other way.”</p><p>Agatha’s pupils darkened, and Rio heard her heartbeat staccato.</p><p>“You’d do what?”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks reddened. “I — well. You’re beautiful, Agatha. That’s all I meant.”</p><p>“Is that all you meant?”</p><p>Now Agatha was looking at her with a challenge in her eyes. All of that sad apathy had melted away, replaced with this <em> hunger </em>— no, that couldn’t be right. They had eaten plenty that morning, sucked a poor peasant man dry. And yet Agatha was turning toward her, looking at her face, then her neck, at the pale exposed skin, and back again.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said lowly, quietly, “I must confess something.”</p><p>Rio blinked, and felt as if perhaps her life was about to change. “Yes?”</p><p>“I dream of biting you almost every night.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth went dry, her entire body going rigid. She could barely get out the words when she asked, “Are you starved? We can find another blood source in the nearby village.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head slowly back and forth. “No, not like that.” In the darkness she almost looked like a spectre, and Rio wondered for a moment if Evanora really <em> had </em> haunted the place, because this felt like a dream. A dream that was slowly becoming real, undoubtedly real — because Agatha was slipping over her, pressing her down into the wood.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio swallowed slowly. Her entire body was heating up like a furnace. She could feel want, no — <em> need </em> — pulsing from her fingers to her ankles. It rushed into her abruptly, she hadn’t even realized it was there, hibernating, but it had broken through now, full force.</p><p>Agatha loomed over her and asked, quietly, “Do you want to kiss me?”</p><p>And when she asked it, her eyes were strangely red. <em> A trick of the light. </em></p><p>“What will it mean if I do?” Rio answered.</p><p>“It means I’ll make love to you in my mother’s attic, and forever traumatize her ghost.”</p><p>And Rio wanted to laugh, she really did, but instead her mind zeroed in on that one word in particular — <em> love </em>— and she trembled. A tremble that traveled throughout her whole body, like a chill in the night, and Agatha must have felt it, because all the confidence, all that hunger, seemed to whisk out of her like the wind, and she began to shake her head.</p><p>“I’m — I’m sorry. This was presumptuous, I…”</p><p>But Rio wouldn’t let her pull away. Something carnal took her, and she reached upward, hooking her hand behind Agatha’s neck, and pulled her in.</p><p>And when their lips touched, it felt like a miracle.</p><p>Something blossomed in Rio’s chest. A weed that grew flowers. They didn’t need to take her clothes off for the realization to hit her like an anvil, as if it’d been dormant there all this time.</p><p><em> I love Agatha, </em> she knew already, in the same way that she knew the days of the month. <em> I am desperately in love with Agatha </em>, was a revelation that was new, and terrifying, and all at once made perfect sense. All it took was hearing the other woman to make the sound —</p><p>“Oh god,” Agatha moaned, pressing her down and tilting her hips forward into Rio’s. They kissed like they’d been meaning to for hundreds of years, and when Agatha withdrew to remove a piece of clothing, any piece at all, her eyes were undoubtedly red, and swirling. They widened just as Rio’s did, and Agatha’s fingers went up to cover her eyelids, “No — stop. <em> Stop. </em> ” But the commands against herself didn’t work. “I want this. <em> I want this. </em> Please.”</p><p>But soon enough Rio was lying slack, again. Asleep. </p><p>And Agatha was alone.</p><p>And Rio, the present Rio, stood a few feet away, a passive observer, watching her body lie unmoving on the floor of the attic. She watched as Agatha breathed heavily, crawling off of her in disbelief, backing away, fearful like some kind of terrified animal. She watched Agatha bring her knees to her chest, and hug them tightly, and cry, silently, as the moon descended into the fields.</p><p> </p>

<p>Unlike the other memories, this one—Agatha, in the attic, in the dim light of the moon dipping below the Alps—did not fade into the next. Rio wouldn’t let her brain skip forward.</p><p> She couldn’t leave Agatha like this. </p><p>Even when she knew it was irrational, even when she knew it was like trying to kiss a photograph, or hold onto a ghost. Because she swore she felt her body there in that attic, really there, feet planted to the wood, fingers trembling. </p><p>She could see the moon through the window and every pockmarked crevice in the basalt walls. She could see Agatha curled into herself like a child on the floor, and Rio wanted to touch her. Needed to touch her. </p><p>To wrap her hands around her small shoulders and tell her, in sequential order—</p><p>
<em> It’s not your fault. None of this is your fault. </em>
</p><p>And then,</p><p>
<em> You’re not alone anymore. We’re in this loop together now. </em>
</p><p> Because this was real, it wasn’t a memory. She was there, and she could fix it.</p><p>Except the moment she stepped forward, a pain like death pried its fingers into the gummy fabric of her brain. She fired off signal after signal to her useless body—<em>Move. Go to her. She needs you.</em> <em>She needs you.</em>—and yet Rio looked down at her feet and found them as heavy as sandbags, immobile even after she screamed at them like a frenzied football coach.</p><p>“Stop it, Rio. You’re making it worse—”</p><p>Rio’s heart clenched with hope when she heard the voice, and looked toward the Agatha on the floor expectantly. But that Agatha was still curled up like an armadillo, crying silently. </p><p>The voice had come from somewhere else.</p><p>Somewhere else? There was nowhere else. Rio’s mind pulsed as she descended further into the memory, until the word <em> memory </em> was no longer something that could describe what she was feeling. This was all there was anymore. She would stay here until she could fix this.</p><p>Rio tried stepping forward again, but the movement seemed to have the opposite effect, and she moved backwards instead of forwards, the image of Agatha getting slowly farther away and more blurry, as if Rio was swimming in a pool, and someone had tied rope around her ankles, and now they were pulling her up like an anchor that’d been tossed to sea. </p><p>“No,” Rio cried out. “Let me <em> go. </em>Let me go to her.”</p><p>Her slowly decomposing brain compensated her confusion with a ballista of images. She saw herself falling from a cliff, then suffocating deep underwater. It was too much air and then not enough. She clawed uselessly at the waves, desperate to find something to hold onto. Nothing felt solid anymore. There was nothing to wrap her fingers around.</p><p><em> This is death, </em>she realized, eyes widening. </p><p>And promptly got pissed the fuck off. Because she’d been asleep for all the most important moments of her life, and here the vindictive universe wanted to submerge her one last time, before she could finally—<em> finally </em>—see, before she could finally breathe the same air Agatha had been breathing for centuries. She wouldn’t let it close in on her just yet.</p><p>Powered by that rage, she ripped a tear in her own dream, raked across the fabric of reality with only her fingernails, and swam through it. And suddenly she was a wet fish flopping on the beach again—on the couch, breathing heavily, eyes snapping open to see Agatha’s head looming over her with a frank, unhidden terror in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth had been already open, as if she’d been trying to talk Rio back into reality for several minutes. Seeing that Rio was awake, and her pulse still beating, two silent tears of relief slipped down Agatha’s face. She made no effort to wipe them away. She just stared at her with red-rimmed pupils, refusing to blink, as if Rio might disappear if she looked away.</p><p>“Rio,” she breathed finally, voice trembling. “I thought you — I thought it was all over.”</p><p>Rio smiled at her sadly, tragically, painful adoration squeezing her chest. She wanted to say <em> I’m not going anywhere </em> , <em> I’m here, I’m alive </em> . She wanted to say <em> I see you now and I’ll never forget again, </em>but instead what came out was “And see of never you again.”</p><p>She blinked when she heard the words leave her mouth and she realized that they made no sense—barely a sentence, barely English. She blinked twice when she saw the alarm in Agatha’s eyes, and realized just how much she’d failed to string together a coherent thought.</p><p>“No, no, no,” Rio clarified with a growing lisp — her mouth felt puffy despite it being perfectly fine. “Speak — saying — I have trouble. Don’t mean. Agatha. <em> Agatha </em>. Te veo.” </p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply at the last phrase. </p><p>But whatever effect it had on her dissolved quickly in face of the rest of the garbled sentence. Agatha met her continued linguistic foibles with a deep-set frown, but at least the panic had died down slightly.</p><p>She gently lifted Rio’s head from her lap, helping her into a wobbly sitting position, wordlessly propping her up against the cushion. </p><p>Rio pretended not to notice when Agatha kept her hand placed on the tense muscle of Rio’s shoulder, even once she was more than capable enough to balance on her own. She wondered if maybe Agatha was using Rio to stabilize herself, and not the other way around.</p><p>“Agnatha—” Rio opened her mouth to try to produce language again—hopefully more successfully—but Agatha clapped a hand over her lips, and shook her head adamantly. The feeling of her hot hands over Rio’s mouth silenced every jumbled thought in her brain.</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha said, her eyes flitting down to Rio’s lips, as if she could feel the way Rio’s body was responding to her. But if she could, she didn’t say so. “Your brain needs time to recover. You’re still scrambled. I wasn’t able to finish the ritual all the way.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>“No terminado?” she muttered into Agatha’s palm. </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but Rio could feel the relief in that small expression—that Agatha was once again capable of being exasperated with her meant that she had moved firmly past panic.</p><p>Making sure Rio was okay was the baseline of Agatha’s Maslow Hierarchy of Needs, with Belittling Rio one tier higher toward self-actualization.</p><p>At the same time, Rio also knew that Agatha slipping back in their usual dynamic was a facade in itself. A wall that was much harder to spot, but no less firm and well-built. She had just shown Rio something so vulnerable it was probably equally lethal to Agatha as it was to Rio. She’d revealed a version of herself that her Suggestion had let her hide for centuries.</p><p>Unwittingly or not—Agatha had been protecting herself from this outcome. And here it was. Soul laid bare.</p><p>
<em> At least part of it. </em>
</p><p>The ritual was still unfinished. Rio imagined it was her fault—she’d overstayed her welcome in Riegersburg. But that meant that there were still memories buried inside of her. How many, she didn’t know. What kinds, she didn’t know. </p><p>Rio wished she could open her mouth and ask flatly, but as if Agatha could sense Rio about to try her patience, firm arms slid around Rio’s middle, and she was being hoisted upwards, into Agatha’s arms with a strength that honestly almost astonished her—she often forgot just how strong Agatha was. She didn’t have Rio’s deadly grip, but she was still a vampire.</p><p>“You need to sleep it off, or I’m going to be stuck talking to a static-noise version of you forever,” was all Agatha said as she carried Rio toward the bedroom. Instantly acquiescing to her touch, Rio buried her still-pounding head into the cotton of Agatha’s sweater and felt all the exhaustion she’d been ignoring creep back to the foreground. </p><p>She realized reluctantly that Agatha was right—her brain was as cluttered as a hoarder’s attic, and her muscles were sore like she’d just run a marathon. Fistfighting death was not a sport for the faint of heart.</p><p>Luckily Rio had more heart than most, and it was pounding noticeably as Agatha lowered her into the soft sheets. She could smell Agatha’s sakura detergent fresh on them.</p><p>Agatha stalled at the edge of the bed and bit her lip as if weighing a choice. Ultimately she sighed, and said, “Hold still. I’m going to change you out of your funeral suit.”</p><p>Rio nodded softly, and was grateful for the first time since she’d woken up that she’d lost her ability for language. Because when Agatha started peeling off her shirt, then unbuttoning her slacks, stalling for a brief moment when the final button popped, Rio almost whimpered with want.</p><p>Because as it turned out, knowing she’d fallen for Agatha a hundred times did not ruin the novelty. She didn’t desire her less, but achingly more, with an immortal sort of necessity.</p><p>But if Agatha did notice the way Rio’s cheeks heated—she was uncharacteristically merciful in ignoring it. Or perhaps she was even more distressed.</p><p>“I think I released enough of the memories to keep you stable,” Agatha said as she helped her into a clean set of pajamas, purposefully avoiding Rio’s eye-contact as she tucked the woman’s shirt into her sweatpants, just how she liked it. “I know you probably want to talk about all of it, and we will. But we should wait until we can finish the process before we do.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure if she believed that. There was no promise less-fulfilled than one that came from Agatha Harkness about something soft and painful.</p><p>But Rio was too tired and too useless to question it, so she just nodded again, and let it be enough that Agatha was touching her like she was something small and important.</p><p>After she’d set Rio’s old clothes aside and tossed them into the laundry hamper, Agatha peeled the comforter up. Rio’s heavy body had it pinned down. “Knees up,” she said, softly, with an amount of quiet adoration that threatened to completely wipe away Rio’s mother tongue. </p><p>Rio complied, lifting the lower half of her body and allowing Agatha to tug the comforter around her. Rio watched Agatha’s slightly-trembling fingers, and wondered why Agatha had tucked her into her own bed—and not Rio’s. </p><p>She wondered what that meant. </p><p>She wondered if it had something to do with the word <em> mine. </em></p><p>She wondered, not for the first time that day, how Agatha really felt about her.</p><p>Because the visions had been simultaneously both damning and confusing. Because yes Agatha wanted to kiss her, and fuck her, tenderly even. She wanted all of that over the course of several lifetimes, and had it been taken from her time and time again, producing a skeptical madness that Rio could easily understand. </p><p>But did Agatha want to hold her? Even if the magic had played no part—did Agatha want to press against her even when Rio was weak, and tired, and had nothing left to offer?</p><p>Did Agatha want to be in love with her? Or was her mind protecting her from exactly that?</p><p>“I’m going to try and get in contact with Wanda while you’re sleeping,” Agatha said, matter-of-fact, once she was satisfied with Rio’s bed situation. And even though Rio’s uncharitable mind said <em> She’s making an excuse not to lie here with you, </em>Agatha was still wearing the wedding ring. In fact she was fidgeting with it, even now. And that made Rio foolishly braver.</p><p>She reached for Agatha’s hand, holding onto it even when Agatha jolted in surprise, and she looked up at the other woman imploringly. </p><p>Agatha frowned down at her in bewilderment.</p><p>“What is it?” she said softly, scared. Like Rio was going to punish her for something.</p><p><em> Oh. </em> A pit turned in Rio’s stomach.  <em> She’s still scared I’m going to hate her. </em></p><p>“Nothing wrong. Want,” Rio said, then blinked several times as she struggled with the rest of the words. They felt like puddy on her tongue. She made a pathetic little gesture to the space in the bed next to her and resorted to a soft, “Please.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes drifted to the mattress, then back to Rio. Rio steeled herself for a no. She wouldn’t take it personally, not really—Agatha said she had to call Wanda. </p><p>Wanda, who was Agatha’s friend, apparently, despite previous very earnest plans to murder her. That was somehow the least confusing part of all this, even if it was still dizzyingly bizarre. </p><p>After a moment, Agatha shrugged, in apparent defeat. “Okay.”</p><p>Rio’s heart leapt in her chest when Agatha crested around the bed, gingerly pulled up the sheets, and slunk in next to her. The other woman had already changed into more comfortable clothes, a navy blue hoodie—one Rio had bought her—and star-patterned sleep bottoms—that Rio had bought her. </p><p>She laid on her side, several inches away, unmoving.</p><p>“Let me know if you need anything,” Agatha whispered, still not facing her. “Water, food, whatever. We can try working on the last memory in the morning. There’s only… one left.”</p><p><em> One left. </em>Rio could read into the implicit confession. That last memory was Bucharest.</p><p>A stronger version of herself would have pried. </p><p>But right now she was only a soft and needy animal.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said throatily, saying her name correctly for the first time that day. Her entire body was thrumming, having her this close, but not holding her. “Closer. Please.”</p><p>The memories had left her with a need to comfort the other woman that was so deep it felt like a chasm inside of Rio’s chest. </p><p>Rio saw a shiver travel down Agatha’s back at her instructions. The other woman didn’t respond for a moment, laying eerily still, before she slowly turned her head, then her whole body, so she was facing Rio. </p><p>Her breaths were slightly labored, her eyes glassy. </p><p>She was crying.</p><p>Rio’s heart wrenched in her chest. Looking at Agatha now, her mask crumbled, her face soft and damp and hiding nothing, she saw the girl in the attic. Only this time she could touch her. She reached out, and tugged Agatha into her chest firmly. She ignored the ache in her muscles when Agatha gripped onto her like an anchor, burying her head into Rio’s neck. </p><p>She could feel the warmth of Agatha’s tears press into her skin.</p><p>“I thought you were going to die,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Never,” Rio managed. Because love had a way of bringing back language.</p><p>“Promise?”</p><p>“Promise.”</p><p>Agatha’s foot brushed against her shin, and before Rio could understand what the other woman was doing, she was slotting her leg in between Rio’s and slinging her hand around Rio’s stomach, crumpling so completely into her that there wasn’t a breath of air between them. Rio ignored the heavy press of Agatha’s thigh on her center, and breathed out shakily.</p><p>“You might not forgive me when you see the last memory.”</p><p>The confession was whispered so quietly to Rio’s chest she barely heard it. The only evidence was the heat of Agatha’s breath on her sternum.</p><p>Rio’s hands threaded around Agatha’s back and pulled her in impossibly closer. Her mind felt finally clear when she said, “I think I could forgive you for anything.”</p><p>
<em> Now that I understand why, I’m ready for whatever’s coming. </em>
</p><p>Agatha raised her head slowly at that, and looked at Rio with an expression that Rio could only describe as quietly desperate.  Her eyes flitted to Rio’s lips, then her eyes. </p><p>Rio felt her stomach turn with heat.</p><p>“That’s something people say before the other shoe drops.”</p><p>“The other shoe has already dropped and fallen down several flights of stairs.”</p><p>“Oh, look whose mouth is working again,” Agatha mumbled, but Rio could hear just how delighted she was by that fact in the way her lips curved around it. After a moment, Agatha sighed, and looked toward Rio’s lips once again, her eyes melting into them with a singular focus.</p><p>“I want something selfish,” Agatha said, finally.</p><p>Rio saw where Agatha’s eyes were looking and understood. In fact, she felt as if she had begun to understand everything,  “You need to stop thinking of it as selfish.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a subtly startled look. To puncture her point, Rio leaned forward, ignoring the way her body was weighing her down like a metal blanket, and pressed her lips to Agatha’s. The other woman whimpered in a way that said <em> So you can read minds, huh? </em>and Rio’s body betrayed her—grinding up against Agatha’s thigh as she pulled the other woman down, deepening it.</p><p>Agatha separated them much too quickly. She looked breathless, and still startled—but there was also a hint of something else there. Something familiar, and smug.</p><p>“Rio,” she said, pressing her hand to Rio’s thumping chest. “Listen to me. If you still want this—” She trailed her hand down dangerously close to the lip of Rio’s pants. “—After tomorrow, I’m all yours.” Rio’s breath lodged in her throat at that. “But right now you need to sleep, or I’m going to be sleeping with a corpse. And despite rumors—I’m not into necrophilia.”</p><p>Rio whined, “Fine. But you’re not allowed to leave while I’m napping.”</p><p>She made it a joke so she wouldn’t have to deal with how much she meant it.</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere, you needy thing,” Agatha joked, then nuzzled herself back into Rio’s neck, and pressed a soft, dangerous kiss to the bite mark that had just scarred over. “Unless you make me lay here for weeks, in which case Tony and Andrew might kick us out for good.”</p><p>Rio ignored the way her entire body buzzed in reaction to Agatha’s affection.</p><p>“It’s fine. We’ll just enthrall a billionaire. That always seems to go well.”</p><p>Agatha muttered into her shoulder, “That plan isn’t <em> over, </em> you know.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio laughed, feeling herself fading. “With you, nothing ever is.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio slept for twenty consecutive hours. This was insane for many reasons. </p><p>Firstly because vampires don’t actually need to sleep, and secondly because Agatha stuck next to her the entire time, right up until the final hour, when her foot had fallen so deeply asleep that she thought she was going to have to saw it off her body.</p><p>As the digital clock at her bedside flashed 4:00am, Agatha gently peeled Rio’s arm off her middle, trying her best not to wake her in the process. The vampire responded by hugging her closer. Agatha grunted, Rio’s enormous strength making the innocent gesture feel like she was being tugged backward by a garbage compressor, and she was the garbage.</p><p>
<em> Apt metaphor. </em>
</p><p>Garbage. That was pretty much how she felt. Physically. Emotionally. She felt like her soul had been beaten with a baseball bat and then stepped on by those metal-spike boots humans wore in the winter. Those shoes were <em> so </em>ugly. And unnecessary. Was it really that hard to have a sense of balance? Agatha enjoyed walking full-speed in six inch stilettos on the ice just to prove this point every winter. She was regularly on the local news for it. </p><p>Thinking about humans and their embarrassing little ice-poking instruments, Agatha eventually managed to wiggle out of Rio’s grip, feeling both relief and a crushing sadness once she was free of it.</p><p> Standing up and shaking out her limbs, Agatha caught a view of herself in her standing mirror—and froze in place when she noticed Rio’s handprint red and swollen against her stomach. </p><p>She had been holding her so tightly, it’d left a mark.</p><p>Agatha wanted to scream. </p><p>…But she didn’t want to wake Rio.</p><p>If that wasn’t a perfect description of her life, she didn’t know what else was—fury so hot in her chest that she could tear her own heart out, stamp on it with ice-spikes, but she didn’t. She didn’t because she didn’t want to scare the one single precious thing she had.</p><p>So she plucked her phone off the nightstand, and walked out of the room. <em> I really need a new case </em> she thought as she looked at the long crack running from top to bottom. <em> You might never see Rio again after today, and you’re worried about a new case </em> , she thought afterward. <em> Please for the love of god give me a moment of peace, </em> she instructed her insufferable mind, slouching on the couch and flying to Amazon, because that’s what she did when she wanted to avoid worrisome thoughts and inevitabilities—online shopping.</p><p>Almost twelve separate cases made it into her cart before that bubbling sensation in the back of her skull got too loud, and she was forced to deal with reality.</p><p>She groaned audibly, just loud enough to feel better but not enough to wake Rio, and opened iMessage.</p><p>Thumbing over to <em> Ginger Dracula, </em>she bit down on her lip when she saw half a dozen messages were already waiting for her. She ignored them all except the last one.</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>Effect’s not going to last much longer, I’m almost out of radius. I delayed Richard as much as I could but he’s insistent we go back to Florida. Is your thrall good yet?</p><p><em> Is your thrall good yet. </em>Agatha almost bit the phone. This woman was so—</p><p><b>agatha: </b>remind me to actually let rio kill you next time.</p><p>The truth was, she wasn’t sure Rio <em> could </em> kill Wanda. Or even really injure her. Agatha was absolutely going to have let her try—it would be her equivalent of whatever men felt at a sports game—but she had good money that Wanda would have wiggled out of it just like she always did.</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>i’ll take that as a yes, then. </p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>so are we going to talk about the fact that you just tried to steal my family fortune from underneath my feet, or are you going to block me again?</p><p>Agatha’s lip twitched in amusement. She had been hoping to get under Wanda’s skin with that one. Unfortunately, given present circumstances, she couldn’t enjoy it very much.</p><p><b>agatha: </b> the family fortune i <em> helped </em> you create? ok. also, i figured you were done with richard. old news, you know? i mean, you did divorce him. very publicly.</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>divorce is just a way for a woman to get a man’s money without having to see him on a regular basis, agatha. you should know that.</p><p><b>agatha: </b>fair. maybe i did pick him just to piss you off, a little bit. but mostly because we’re out of money, and i’m tired of being out of money. </p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>don’t give me that excuse. you two are always, perpetually, consistently, out of money. literally since the 1400s. it’s a lifestyle choice at this point. now let’s talk about the real reason you picked richard. i’m running out of texts. i have a limited plan. </p><p>Agatha’s mouth dropped open. Not because Wanda had seen right through her, but because of that last sentence.</p><p><b>agatha: </b>a limited text plan??? what century are you living in? you can get unlimited data for like ten dollars a month, and you have alimony from a billionaire</p><p>Wanda didn’t reply. Probably to <em> save texts. </em> Agatha groaned.</p><p><b>agatha: </b>fine. i wanted to fuck with the Council.</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>hm. try again.</p><p>Agatha scowled at her phone.</p><p><b>agatha: </b>what happened to you saving texts?</p><p>No reply.</p><p><b>agatha: </b>i hate you so much you infuriating cavewoman</p><p>No reply.</p><p>Agatha’s heart began to racket in her chest. Fuck Wanda for making her say it.</p><p><b>agatha: </b>ok. fine, you sadist - i figured if i climbed to the top of the council’s stupid little hierarchy, one of their wonder-vampires could help me with my problem. </p><p><b>agatha: </b>my… rio problem.</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>there it is.</p><p>Agatha’s insides boiled. She was about to tell Wanda to go fuck herself, when she got another expensive, limited-edition text from the other woman.</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>do you still believe that? that you need someone else to fix it?</p><p>Agatha churned her teeth. </p><p><b>agatha: </b>you’re asking me if i think the curse i’ve tried to break for six hundred years is suddenly a mental health problem i can fix with cognitive behavioral therapy? yes, wanda, sure it is.</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>have you ever *tried* cognitive behavioral therapy?</p><p><b>agatha: </b>i tried bloodletting, leeches, and having my ear amputated. i can’t imagine it’s any more effective than those.</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>i cannot stress how unrelated those things are to your mental health</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She threw her phone onto the other side of the couch, and went to get herself something from the fridge. She was hoping to find anything alcoholic—or maybe just straight up poison, that would be nice—but all that was left were Rio’s favorite iced green teas. </p><p>The sight softened her instantly. And that softness bored a hole in her, one that let all the rot rise to the surface. She stampeded in her slippers back to the couch and picked up the phone. She found several texts from Wanda waiting for her.</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>agatha? hello?</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>let me guess, you just grabbed a whiskey</p><p><b>agatha: </b>oh, fuck you. i grabbed nothing because there’s nothing in the fridge. and there’s nothing in the fridge because i’ve been so fucking preoccupied with the fact that for the first time in my entire life, i can actually seem to kiss rio without her blacking out on me. i can hold her and touch her and she actually remembers.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers were trembling by the time she sent the text. Wanda didn’t reply for several seconds, and Agatha feared for a moment that she’d run out of texts.</p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b>agatha… isn’t that a good thing?</p><p><b>agatha: </b>what? no, it’s not a *good thing,* asshole. do you know how much more it’s going to hurt when it inevitably happens again? when we go back to zero? </p><p><b>agatha: </b>i can barely keep it together when she tries to kiss me every hundred years. i don’t think i can bear it if she tells me that she loves me again.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened so hard around her phone that the crack turned into a full fracture, splintering the pixels. </p><p><b>ginger dracula: </b> but have you considered that maybe the suggestion <em> won’t </em> happen again? you’ve unwound her this time. all the memories are there. there’s nothing left to hide from.</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p><b>agatha: </b>not all of them. not bucharest.</p><p>She saw Wanda typing, but she threw her shattered phone to the couch before she could see what she was about to say. Because Agatha already knew what it would be. Some version of <em> it doesn’t matter, Agatha. </em>And Wanda could be right. None of it could matter to Rio. But that didn’t change the fact that even if Rio forgave her for everything, for all of it, it could still happen again.</p><p>This whole cycle could repeat. And Agatha could be back at square one.</p><p>And then she’d have to do this again. And again, she’d have to watch Rio realize she was missing moments of her life. And again, she’d look at Agatha like Agatha had stabbed her. And again, Agatha would want to stab herself. Masochism was one thing—this was another.</p><p>So it didn’t matter what Wanda thought. The plan was still on.</p><p>She was going to get Richard Ashcroft’s fucking number, and she was going to ride that golden ticket all the way up to the top of the vampire foodchain.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>An hour later, Rio woke up to the sound of Agatha loudly washing dishes in the sink.</p><p>Which was a weird sound to hear, because they had a dishwasher that Agatha swore by religiously. In fact, ever since the invention of it in 1850, Agatha never laid her hand on a sponge again—<em> they’re festering with germs, Rio— </em>even though Rio kept one by the kitchen sink.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio called out.</p><p>She felt a pit of disappointment roll around in her stomach that Agatha hadn’t been lying beside her when she woke up. But Rio couldn’t exactly blame her. She had no idea how long she’d been out for. A quick glance at the clock said it had to be hours—maybe days.</p><p>She had never blacked out like that before—so completely, so dreamlessly, just a long black window of <em> nothing. </em> She wondered if that was how mortals slept. Like rocks, hovering near death.</p><p>“Coming, coming,” Agatha said in a huff.</p><p>When Agatha finally ambled into the room, she was wearing a soap-soaked apron, her hair high in a messy bun, and her cheeks tinted an adorable red, like she’d been really exerting herself. </p><p>“Hi,” Rio laughed. No, giggled. Like a schoolgirl with a crush. Giggled like whatever she and Agatha had was silly and simple, and not ancient and insane. “What on Earth are you doing?”</p><p>“What does it look like I’m doing?”</p><p>Rio pushed her tongue into her cheek. “Losing your mind?”</p><p>Agatha grumbled, “Close. <em> Dishes. </em>”</p><p>“Come here and tell me about it?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, seeming to consider the offer, then with a dramatic sigh she began to force the apron over shoulders, struggling adorably when she got stuck mid-way. </p><p><em> “Stupid fucking—” </em> She jumped up and down. “ <em> Dumb ass piece of—” </em> </p><p>Rio nearly got up to help her, but Agatha eventually managed, tossing it into a corner, hissing at it like a psychopath, and then sliding into bed again. Rio felt her heart stutter when Agatha drew close, sidling up next to her like they were two friends at a sleepover.</p><p>Agatha sighed audibly against her shoulder, squeezing her eyes closed.</p><p>“I needed to do something mindless with my hands,” she whispered. “You’ve been asleep for half a century and it was starting to drive me insane.”</p><p>Rio felt her cheeks warm at her closeness. “Didn’t know what to do without me?”</p><p>Agatha opened one eye and still managed to glare at her. </p><p>“Something like that,” she grumbled. Then she paused, and her cheeks grew even more pink, like she’d thought something embarrassing. “Or, more likely, I was thinking of all the ways I could get out of finishing the unwinding process. So you could just forget all this happened so we’d never have to speak about it again. But then I realized I could, technically, do that. By Suggesting you. And then I realized I’m a fucking asshole. And then I found myself doing dishes out of some sort of guilty consciousness. So yes, I’m going insane.”</p><p>Rio’s heart broke and swelled at the same time. </p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Rio said, biting her lip. “Are you actually being <em> honest </em> with me?”</p><p>Agatha looked away. “Sometimes pigs fly.”</p><p>Rio gave her a small, knowing smile.  “I already told you I’m not going to be upset. Whatever it is. Even if you tried to murder me in my sleep.”</p><p>“Right, because you’re some sort of freak of nature that refuses to harbor a grudge. Which would be the <em> normal </em> reaction to all this, by the way — and also to attempted murder.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio reached over, and grabbed Agatha’s face, holding it gently. “Will you just get it over with already, you endearingly insane person?”</p><p>Rio was genuinely begging now. Because she couldn’t stand it anymore. It wasn’t about kissing her anymore. It was about knowing her so that she could tell her it was alright and mean it. </p><p>Agatha was momentarily breathless, looking at Rio’s hands surrounding her.</p><p>“Okay,” she said after a beat. Then frowned, repeating it with resignation. “Okay.”</p><p>And her eyes blazed red.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>In truth, the thing that Agatha dreaded the most about unwinding wasn’t revealing the truth to Rio. It was that when she touched Rio’s mind, when she worked her fingers through the lacerations she’d put on her dear girl’s brain, Agatha had to relive it, too.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
<b>BUCHAREST. FEBRUARY, 1892.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>The wind was blowing fast and the sun hot as an iron as their horse-drawn tram rattled against the metal tracks lining the street. Rio had her head flung out the window, laughing at something Agatha had said. Agatha was high on Rio’s laugh, high on making her smile, high on a little bit of something else, too, as the two of them watched Bucharest blow by in a flurry of tailcoats and polished boots—their final destination crawling toward them.</p><p>“So, you sure he’ll be there?”</p><p>Rio was talking of course about King Carol. The bushy-bearded Romanian monarch they’d been toying about ‘dealing with’ for months now. They had been eyeing his castle—the Peles Estate—and had made plans to move in during the summer. It was a fantastic beast of a castle, a Germanic pearl in the heart of Romania, and Agatha wanted her dirty little hands on it.</p><p>“He will,” she confirmed, jolting a bit when the carriage rolled over an uneven cobblestone. Rio caught her easily, and Agatha tried her best to conceal the warmth she felt being held by her impossibly strong arms. Even covered under all that dense feminine fabric—Rio’s muscles were like boulders. Boulders she wished she could bite. “He attends a concert there every Thursday.”</p><p>“I’m rather excited about the concert,” Rio said.</p><p>And Agatha snorted, because of course Rio was excited about the concert. The concert where they were planning to <em> murder the King. </em></p><p>Then again, Agatha was sort of counting on it.</p><p>“I knew you would be,” Agatha said, then shrugging casually, she added, “I think you’ll like tonight’s program especially. The Athenaeum usually plays Beethoven, that <em> bore, </em> but tonight they’re playing Tchaikovsky. Your favorite.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes brightened like a baby bear’s. Agatha couldn’t help but liken her to an animal—her innocence was equal to her ferocity. </p><p>“Serenade for Strings?” she asked, her voice small and hopeful.</p><p>Agatha nodded, and Rio clapped eagerly, like a child. When she got over her initial excitement, she leaned down to whisper into Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“You suggested the conductor into it, didn’t you?” </p><p>Agatha’s cheeks heated. “I can’t believe you’d ever accuse me of tampering unethically with the concert program.”</p><p>Rio pressed a stupid kiss to the side of Agatha’s head. One that earned them a few looks from the old women on the opposite sides of the tram. Agatha was too dizzy to notice.</p><p>“You? Tampering?” Rio’s breath hit the side of her cheek, and it was smokey like a hot cigar. It made her feel insane, and she knew then and there that tonight would probably ruin her in ways she’d be unable to predict until she was being stabbed in the chest with them. “Never.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nursed a visinata, the cherry aroma matching the shade of Rio’s cheeks as she watched the other woman lean against the wooden railing, absolutely enraptured by the violins playing below them. They were an hour and a half into the performance, high above the stage with some of the best seats in the house, and they were supposed to be strategizing their next move by now, but Agatha didn’t have it in her to interrupt.</p><p>Not when Rio looked so beautiful under the soft lights, like an angel flung out of heaven. Not when Rio was so obviously enjoying herself.</p><p>Agatha would rather be poor forever than ruin a moment of Rio’s fun.</p><p>
<em> Stop it. </em>
</p><p>Her thoughts had been unkind to her all night. And by unkind, she meant they’d been viciously enamored with her friend despite her better instincts. </p><p>It was coming up on fifty years since she’d wiped Rio’s mind clean in Riegersburg. It had been such a traumatizing experience that she hadn’t dared to lean too close again. Even when Rio’s eyes were begging her to—looking down at her lips so flagrantly, so <em> obviously. </em> </p><p>She’d turn away every time, avoid it despite every instinct that she had to let herself be devoured.</p><p>It was simply too terrifying.</p><p>Because what Rio wanted was to put her mouth to Agatha, and what Agatha wanted was for Rio to consume her entire soul. </p><p>
<em> How melodramatic.  </em>
</p><p>It was truly embarrassing how Rio turned her into some kind of failed Shakespeare, the way her mind invented new ways to craft sentences about her need for the other woman. </p><p>She never thought herself a poetic person, but it turned out that Agatha had just, previous to Rio, never been a person who held back from things. And she had come to realize that holding back on things was in fact the <em> mark </em> of a poet—artists were people who had feelings they couldn’t place with their hands, so they did so with their minds and with their silly little pencils.</p><p>Agatha was not meant to be an artist. She was meant to be a messy muse.</p><p>But Rio had sequestered her here, in this awkward space. So she would be a poet in silence, and watch Rio enjoy the show. Because ultimately Agatha was fine living out a fate not meant for her as long as Rio would smile like that, her dimples curling, and kiss Agatha on the cheek afterwards.</p><p>“Are you enjoying it?”</p><p>Rio’s soft elbow into her side rocked Agatha out of her self-pity, and she looked up at the other woman. Rio had turned her body so she was obfuscating the stage, and the light had caught her like a halo, illuminating her from behind.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said simply. Rio didn’t need to know exactly <em> what </em> she was enjoying. It was certainly not her business. But to make it clear, Agatha added, “I’m a huge fan of… music.”</p><p>Rio snorted, her nose wrinkling. “You haven’t been paying attention at all, have you?”</p><p>Agatha played it off with a swing of her hair as she let her eyes fall on the seat of the King. He was in the first row, surrounded by guards. “Guilty as charged. Pay a penny for my thoughts, you’ll find murder on my mind, or however that saying goes.”</p><p>“I don’t think that’s a saying at all.”</p><p>“Well now it is.” Agatha clicked her tongue. “Write it down, disseminate it to the people.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, then circled her hand around Agatha’s back, pulling her into her side so they were forced into looking at the violinists together. Which was a very cruel thing to do to Agatha, who immediately melted into her like butter, but she made sure to huff a very loud breath just to make sure it was clear she wasn’t happy about it.</p><p>A few seconds passed where they both genuinely watched the show. The conductor’s hands were magnetic, and the music was <em> fine </em>, Agatha supposed. She didn’t know then that she’d end up purchasing Serenade for Strings in every format under the sun in the aftermath, because Rio would forget she loved it, and Agatha would play it so she could remember the music, if nothing else.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said. Her voice was uncharacteristically shaky, and her fingers around Agatha’s middle curled in a little too tight. “I’ve been doing a bit of thinking.”</p><p>“That’s never good. Avoid it if you can.”</p><p>Air left Rio’s nostrils, but she didn’t laugh. Dread began to build in Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>“I think maybe I <em> do </em> want to be in love.”</p><p>And <em> oh </em>. Nothing could have prepared Agatha for the way that landed on her chest. Her heart ached in a way it never had before, like it was trying to kill her.</p><p>“You—what?”</p><p>Rio looked down shyly, smiling at nothing particular. “I don’t know. The music makes me theatrical. It’s just… When you asked me many years ago if I desired anyone. If I wanted to date.”</p><p>“I recall.”</p><p>“Well, I think I do.” Rio shrugged, with that casual certainty she brought to everything. “I want to experience whatever it was that made Tchaikovsky write this. And, well, I looked up the word for <em> serenade </em> in the dictionary before tonight—”</p><p>Rio reached into her pocketbook and pulled out a small note. There were a few lines of text scrawled into it with ink. She furrowed her brows in determination and began to read from it.</p><p>“A piece of music sung or played in the open air, typically by a man at night under the window of his lover,” Rio read as though it was scripture, and Agatha was grateful for the dim lighting, because she was borning like a torch. “I’m not a man, and I’ve never had a lover—but I do like the idea of singing something under someone’s window.”</p><p>Agatha felt suddenly completely unprepared for this conversation. Completely unprepared to say anything except <em> Why not my window, </em> or <em> I’d like to sing under yours, </em> because her selfish mind could only position the conversation in those exact two dimensions—Rio loving her, her loving Rio, nothing in between, no other person, alive or dead, skull and bones, dead dead dead. She’d kill anyone who even dared. Yes, she’d like to murder them, and bury them beneath the ground—</p><p>Oh. This wasn’t good.</p><p>Rio had never given Agatha the opportunity to be jealous.</p><p>Now that she felt a glimmer of it, it was clear this was going to end horribly.</p><p>“Have you ever been in love?” Rio asked Agatha when she didn’t reply. Agatha refused to call Rio's eyes <em> hopeful </em> because that would mean admitting something else.</p><p>Agatha quickly swallowed down the rest of her drink, and felt it corrode the inside of her throat. She took Rio’s hand and kept her eyes trained on the King, who was getting ready to take a break for the Intermission.</p><p>“Yes,” she answered because anything else felt like lying. “Let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>They killed the King.</p><p>It went spectacularly well, except for one small detail.</p><p>They were seen by half of the Romanian guard, and were now running for their lives.</p><p>Luckily, vampire legs, when you really put them into gear, carried faster than even horses. And vampire eyes could see through the night’s darkness unusually well, so they could scramble around in the trenches and the alleyways even with no candles. Soon enough they were breathing each other's air in the darkness of some alleyway, horse hooves clopping by in the distance, the police frantically running in the opposite direction, batons twirling through the air.</p><p>Agatha’s chest heaved against Rio’s, and the adrenaline—and the visinata—made her forget herself completely. She pressed a sloppy kiss to the side of Rio’s face, giggling.</p><p>“Oh, that was so <em> fun. </em>”</p><p> Rio’s breath hitched in her chest. But then she laughed it out in a choppy breath. “Do you think we’ll get to keep the castle?”</p><p>Agatha pulled away and palmed over Rio’s pocket, which was notably empty. “Not if you forgot to grab the keys.”</p><p>Rio smirked slyly, and opened her pocketbook. The same one holding the definition from before. Lithe fingers removed an entire ring of keys—silver, copper, bronze—and jangled them in Agatha’s face. Agatha could see her own reflection in them, and she looked much too happy.</p><p>She took them hastily from Rio so she didn’t have to look at herself much longer.</p><p>“It’ll be a chore, thralling every soldier who comes to reclaim it,” Agatha said, stepping away from Rio to press her back against the cold wall next to her, so they were side by side, gazing into the dark streets. She could practically hear Rio’s smile—and feel it, too, when she touched her hand to Agatha’s, and then held it tightly, interweaving their fingers.</p><p>“Everything is a chore to you,” Rio laughed. </p><p>“Not everything.” <em> Not you. </em>“But most things.”</p><p>Rio laughed again, turning toward her on the wall, because Agatha could truly never escape her. The light from the gas lamp cast a hazy ghost on her face, allowing her to see Rio’s fangs, still faintly red. She was always forgetting to wash the blood off of them.</p><p>“You’re going to get us caught,” Agatha sighed, pulling a handkerchief from her pocket and stepping closer. “Let me…”</p><p>She grazed her thumb across Rio’s lip. The other woman stilled, her eyes going minutely wider in surprise. Agatha panicked and nearly withdrew, but then almost as quickly as Rio’s surprise came, it faded. Rio opened up obediently, and Agatha schooled her face toward something she hoped looked doctorly or professional or at the very least <em> platonic, </em> before taking Rio’s chin with her other hand, and running the cloth delicately over her teeth.</p><p>During the entire procedure, Rio looked at her as if she was holding the secrets to the universe. It should have told Agatha that this was too much, too close, but Agatha couldn’t help herself. Rio’s lips were as soft as fresh linens and she smelled so <em> good </em> and her teeth looked so sharp—and Agatha might never get this chance again. That was something she told herself very often, despite never knowing what a <em> chance </em> exactly was. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio inhaled.</p><p>Agatha paused, realizing only then how intimately close their faces had gotten. She had to back away ever-slightly to see Rio’s beautiful brown eyes in full. </p><p>“What?” she said breathily.</p><p>“I think,” Rio swallowed. “I think I would like to be in love with <em> you. </em>”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what happened to her, hearing those words. She’d never felt a tangle of emotions so powerful since. It felt like opening a present on your birthday and getting <em> exactly </em> what you wanted, and then suddenly having it taken away from you, locked in a closet, shot behind the barn. She gasped, her heartbeat in her ears, panic crawling around the hem of her vision.</p><p>Rio could sense her shock and she seemed to immediately withdraw. But because she was Rio, not without a fight first, or at least a pointed question—“Am I not to your tastes?”</p><p>She could see Rio’s mind evaluating itself, searching for faults. And for as much as Agatha was a selfish, self-sabotaging creature, she could never, <em> ever </em> let Rio believe that.</p><p>“Darling, you <em> define </em>my tastes,” Agatha muttered quietly, and quickly, so that she didn’t have to register it on her own ears. “You are the most infuriatingly gorgeous creature on Earth. It is torture not to press you against the walls of most restaurants and bars and opera halls.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, and there was that <em> hope </em> again.</p><p>Agatha wanted to drown in it. She wanted so badly to kiss those swollen, blood-stained lips and have this be easy. But she knew what would happen when she did. And that knowledge cratered into her like a disease, making her hang her head.</p><p>“But you should pick someone else to be in love with, because my love is no good,” she said, hoping to sound casual but precise. “It’s tainted with snake oil.”</p><p>
<em> Because if you fall in love with me, you’ll never get the chance of actually staying in it. </em>
</p><p>It was the truth. The aching truth. And at least, maybe this way, if she just <em> told </em> Rio instead of kissing her and making her learn the lesson—she could at least live with a version of Rio who loved her once. Who remembered how it felt to love her and not have her mind wiped clear.</p><p>Rio huffed out a breath that sounded nearly <em> offended. </em></p><p>“Agatha,” she said seriously, taking the other woman’s shoulder and squeezing it. “Even if your face was doused in poison, I’d kiss you like drinking a cognac. We’ve known each other for hundreds of years, do you really think I don’t know what I’m getting myself into?”</p><p>Agatha looked up, realizing that the aching pit in her stomach was forming into something as embarrassing as <em> tears. </em>Tears which she tried hastily to wipe away, but Rio saw first. </p><p>Her cocky smile immediately dropped from her face and she rubbed the pads of her thumbs delicately across Agatha’s cheeks, holding them there.</p><p>“Agatha. Please let me try and love you,” Rio said softly. “I promise it won’t hurt.”</p><p>Agatha laughed wetly. The utter kindness in Rio’s voice made her want to crawl in a hole. “That’s the kind of promise someone makes before the other shoe drops.”</p><p>Rio cupped her cheek, still smiling at her. “Let it drop, then, and knock me out cold.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, exasperated. “Do you ever give up on anything?”</p><p>“Not when it matters to me.”</p><p>Agatha knew then that Rio would never stop pursuing her, year after year, even if she forgot it every single time. Because Rio was not a person, she was persistence personified. </p><p>So Agatha stared at Rio’s lips—and for a moment, she let herself be greedy.</p><p>She cupped both hands around Rio’s jaw, holding her like a captain might have held onto the ledge of a sinking ship, and pressed her mouth to Rio’s with a soft whimper. Rio immediately threaded her strong hands through Agatha’s hair and smiled into it, <em> laughed </em> into it, and for a single moment in time Agatha laughed too, feeling like everything was going to be okay.</p><p>But then she felt it.</p><p>That familiar stirring behind her eyes.</p><p>
<em> No, no, no, no.  </em>
</p><p>Despair like no other filled her stomach, and she knew then that she had a choice to make.</p><p>She could either do this again and again, lifetime over lifetime, or she could end it now, feel the pain <em> now </em>, and let it scar over. It would heal terribly, like an infected wound; it would be the worst thing she’d ever do, but it would at least make it so she wouldn’t have to do it again.</p><p>She had to change the Suggestion.</p><p>So she pulled back, tears in her eyes, and said new words:</p><p>“Rio,” she said gently, her heart breaking. “You are <em> not </em> in love with me.”</p>

<p>Rio woke up with strange tears in her eyes and a headache like someone had drilled into her skull. She couldn’t remember exactly <em> why </em>this was for a few seconds afterwards, as if her brain was an overstuffed laundry bin that had been abruptly emptied into the washer. </p><p>She winced, rolled her neck, feeling desperate for some thought to fill her up again—only to find Agatha sitting a few centimeters away from her, cross-legged on the bed they were sharing. Her friend was breathing heavily and her cheeks were wet, like pottery that had been soaked in glaze, or resin. She looked so sad. Rio didn’t know why.</p><p>“Agatha?” she said softly, like a question. The other woman blinked like a deer.</p><p>When she received no response, she slowly lifted her hand to cup Agatha’s shoulder, trying to buy herself time to remember. It felt like a half-shapen thought was wrestling around her mind like an aggressive tumbleweed; like when you wake up in a hotel bed and for a moment you have no idea where you are—or how you even got there. </p><p>Until you look around, at the walls, at the bleary light coming through the window, at the time on your phone, and then you remember the airplane you took to get there, you remember the yellow taxi that rumbled up to the hotel entrance on the edge of some alley-like street.</p><p>She palmed her hand around Agatha’s neck and felt like she was that taxi—pulling up to the edge of something. Goosebumps ran up the other woman’s nape, making the fast-fading bite mark protrude more around her pulse point. <em> Bite mark, </em> Rio thought, and her eyes widened.</p><p>“Agatha,” she repeated, but this time her voice broke.</p><p>Rio remembered everything at once. But not necessarily in order.</p><p>She remembered the orchestra. She remembered looking at Agatha across from her, at her nervously bobbing leg, and thinking <em> She must really love me if she’ll sit through this. </em> She remembered killing the king of Romania. She remembered how his blood tasted—salty and sour, like raw fish—and how when she’d mentioned it to Agatha, Agatha had said <em> I bet yours tastes sweet.  </em></p><p>She remembered thinking about that—about how it would feel for Agatha to taste her, for her to taste Agatha—the entire time they ran away from the Poliția Română, until she was pressed up against the cold wall of some street, breathing hard, her lungs constricting, and Agatha was doing the same. Her head hung low, looking prettier and more dangerous than the devil, and suddenly Rio couldn’t run from the truth anymore. It was bursting out of her.</p><p>She was in love.</p><p>She was in love with Agatha, and not for the first time. </p><p>It all started around June of their hundredth year spent together. She’d watched Agatha, drunk and heated, press some woman against the tavern wall in a pub in the north of Ireland. Rio had thought the very simple but ultimately fatal — <em> I wish she’d put her hands in my hair and kiss me that way. </em> </p><p>It was a terrifying thought at first. It filled her with a fear that was worse than the day she was bitten, but like all poisons, it softened on the way down. And suddenly it was all she could think about.</p><p>And god, she felt so <em> good </em> finally confessing it. Like she’d been waiting her whole life to do so. Maybe because she had. But then just as soon as she’d emptied the poison from her chest, Agatha had cupped her cheek, smiled at her softly, and then buried Rio’s love so deep inside of her that it only reared its head decades later.</p><p>
<em> Except that’s a bit of a lie, isn’t it? </em>
</p><p>In truth, Rio had loved Agatha even an hour after Agatha had tried to Suggest it out of her. </p><p>Even when Agatha insisted on shoving herself in Romanian prison for God knows what reason—(to punish herself when no one else would, Rio could understand clearly now.)</p><p>She’d loved her year after year since, with a quiet ferocity that had no name but certainly had consequences. Consequences like an inability to look at other women without feeling a peach pit of guilt grow inside of her. Unable to <em> touch </em> other women without feeling she was ripping out her own insides. Rio felt no attraction to anyone, except Agatha.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t suppressed her love for her. She’d simply removed her vocabulary. Made her unable to put words to what her body already knew.</p><p>At least, for a little while. Rio eventually found her way around to language again. <em> I love you I love you I love you. </em>Again and again and again, persistent like a bee.</p><p>Which meant, of course—</p><p><em> The suggestion didn’t work. </em>Not in full.</p><p>Like a chicken who’d lost its head but not its will to run and squirm and make a mess of everything, Rio fell in love with Agatha again and again and again, and Agatha’s magic did nothing to get in its way. </p><p>And yet, Rio was not naive enough to think this was because her mind was somehow more powerful than Agatha’s Suggestion. Sure, Rio had the raw power of a tank, but her mind was like that of a mortal—feeble, unripe. Unlike Agatha, her mental barriers were weak if nonexistent, made of rotten wood instead of Agatha’s hard, impenetrable steel.  </p><p>If Agatha’s suggestion didn’t work on her, it was only for one reason.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want it to.</p><p>Agatha, at least a small part of her, <em> wanted </em> Rio to love her.</p><p>“Rio? Snap out of it. You’re scaring me.”</p><p>Rio didn’t realize she’d been so completely zoned out until Agatha shook her back into her body. </p><p>With a sharp breath in, her senses re-awakened. She felt the needy touch of Agatha’s hand gripping her arm, the other folded around her waist. </p><p>Agatha was close to her but not <em> too </em> close. Like a fearful animal staring down the barrel of a gun, she was frozen—stock still.</p><p>“I remember everything,” Rio admitted quietly.</p><p>Agatha’s face was a mix of relief and harrowing fear at the admission. She nodded lamely, retreating with her hands so her arm was resting against the pillow on the other side of the bed. After a moment she began to play with the ends of her own hair. </p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Rio laughed, still feeling the hazy high of knowing Agatha wanted her. In a way she hadn’t admitted with words, but with hundreds of years of failed attempts to stop it. “Good?”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know. Not good? Bad? Very bad,” Agatha muttered, then covered her face with her hands. Her voice sounded so little—but still so grouchy, like an old man—when she said: “Please just get it over with and tell me to fuck off. I can thrall one of the twinks to carry my stuff out. Andrew has the bigger arms—but Tony is more tolerable to speak to—”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.” </em></p><p>“And maybe if I text Wanda now I can get her to send me some of her —” Agatha dropped her voice to a mocking venomous tone. “— <em> Billionaire money. </em> I mean, if she won’t let me thrall the jerk myself, it’d at least be neighborly of her to lend me a few hundred thousand dollars to get back on my feet once I’m a one woman show…”</p><p>“<em> Agatha. </em> ” Rio climbed over to her, and put a firm hand around her mouth. “You’re not moving out. Well, we might have to eventually, but I want — we’ll do it as a <em> we. </em>”</p><p>Agatha blinked several times, her incessant lips still moving behind Rio’s hand.</p><p>“I’m not?” she mumbled, muffled. “You’re not… feeling murderous?”</p><p>Of course in practice she meant <em> You don’t hate me now? </em> but it wouldn’t be Agatha Harkness if she didn’t find a creative way of removing her own feelings from the equation—sliding out from under the guillotine until someone tracked her down and put her back there. </p><p>Rio opened her mouth to speak, to say something like, <em> No, even after all that, I still love you as much as I did in the 18th and 19th centuries, and I think I might love you an equal amount when we’re all shooting into space on rockets to Mars, </em>but she bit her tongue. </p><p>Because she realized then that if she didn’t choose her words carefully, this could become another memory that she’d been re-awakening in a hundred year’s time.</p><p>And the truth was—she knew she loved Agatha now, more sure than ever. And she had an inkling that a part of Agatha could love her, too. But she didn’t know how big that part was, or how prickly. If it was something Agatha could touch, or if the act of touching it was the whole problem that began this—like original sin, Eve biting into the forbidden apple.</p><p>Agatha sensed her hesitancy and found the worst possible way to address it, mumbling into Rio’s palm, “We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.”</p><p>Rio’s words died in her throat, replaced by a short, gruff, <em> disbelieving </em>laugh. Because of course Agatha had been enduring six hundred years of heartbreak and yet she was still happy to avoid the subject and sweep it under the rug if it meant avoiding a difficult conversation. She knew Agatha would hate to hear this—but in some ways it was truly evident she was raised by Evanora.</p><p>She let her hand fall away from Agatha’s mouth, missing the warmth of it immediately. She slunk backwards, giving Agatha a small modicum of space.</p><p>“I want to talk about it,” Rio said as if it was obvious. </p><p>Agatha scratched the back of her head, bowing her head. “Mhm.”</p><p>
<em> She’s shutting down. </em>
</p><p>And based on what had happened to her the past times they’d tried to talk about it, Rio couldn’t blame her. She was probably expecting her body to betray her at the last moment. And for all they knew, it still could. </p><p>As much as Rio wanted to say everything she felt in her chest—<em> I have six hundred years of love to give you and I just want to know if you’d like to have it— </em>she needed to tread carefully. They weren’t necessarily at the end of their puzzle, but most possibly at the messy middle of the game, like two chess pieces caught in a stalemate.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said, and risked inching closer. The other woman looked up, momentarily terrified, but softened when Rio slipped her hand around her knee, and squeezed. She lowered her voice to a whisper when she said, “I’m not angry at you. And you’re not alone in this anymore.”</p><p>Agatha stared back at her like she’d just said something impossible. And maybe to Agatha it felt that way. Her eyes were big and dark and desperate.</p><p>“You’re really not angry at me?” Agatha said. “After everything I did to you?”</p><p>“No. I’m not,” Rio said, squeezing her knee again. “And honestly I reject your phrasing. Because what exactly did you even <em> do </em> to me? None of it was your fault.”</p><p>Leaving her knee, Rio trailed her fingers down to Agatha’s hand, and entangled their fingers in the softest way she could manage, like an extended olive branch. One full of six-hundred years of adoration. Agatha took it as Agatha typically took gestures of kindness—with, at first, shock, then a fistful of skepticism.</p><p>“I don’t know, Rio, what didn’t I do?” Agatha laughed dryly, miserably. She withdrew her hand. “Let me see.” She began counting on her fingers mockingly. “Fuck your brain up for the past six hundred years. Force your own words back down your throat. Leave you choking on your own feelings—”</p><p>“<em>Unwittingly. </em>”</p><p>“Okay, great. <em> Unwittingly </em> choking on your own feelings,” Agatha all but shouted, with an almost manic laugh. Distress seemed to overwhelm her and she lurched out of the bed, shaking her head in disbelief that this was actually happening, and opened her closet door. “If I was actually a good person, a <em> sane </em> person, I would have left you be.”</p><p>Rio stared after her from the bed. She muttered, “Left me be?” </p><p>“Yes, Rio. <em> Left you be. </em> Because when you first start noticing that you’re brainwashing someone into— well, <em> being interested in you </em>— the moral choice is to step back and maybe give them some space. Like hundreds of years of space. But I didn’t do that. I’ve just…” The closet door clashed loudly against its hinges as she began picking mindlessly through her clothing. “Strung you along. Because I can’t help it. I enjoy your company. Fucking sue me. Or hate me. Hate me at the very least. It would be the dignified thing to do.”</p><p>Her voice had gone quieter at the end, but she refused to look back. Instead she was mindlessly sorting through her dresses, organizing them like that was something important.</p><p>It was so distracting that Rio almost failed to process what Agatha had just said.</p><p>“You think I–” She began to laugh, because it was actually, in a morbidly sad way, hilarious. “You think you brainwashed me into…”</p><p>She stopped, falling short of <em> into loving you. </em> Even if she wanted so badly to say them, she didn’t want to trigger an episode. </p><p>Rio pinched the bridge of her nose and rephrased. “Not to sound dense — I sort of just arrived at this multi-generational disaster — but didn’t you do <em> exactly </em> the opposite of that?” </p><p>Agatha’s foot tapped against the floor. Rio couldn’t see her face, but she could hear her lips opening then closing several times, before ultimately huffing, “Either way you look at it, it's not great.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Okay, sure, but there’s like a mostly correct way of looking at it, and then an absolutely incorrect way of looking at it. You can’t just present those two as equal options.”</p><p>That tore a slight laugh out of Agatha, which warmed Rio’s chest like a soft cloud. </p><p>She stopped her machinations on her clothing for a moment, and paused in thought.</p><p>“Look. I’m not trying to invalidate your… feelings,” Agatha said, still refusing to turn to her. But Rio could see a fragment of her face in the mirror, and she was blushing. “That’s explicitly what I’m trying <em> not </em> to do. I’ve just had a very long time to analyze the situation. And my reading of it is that, well, I inadvertently Suggested your subconscious into… feeling… some type of way. About me.”</p><p>Rio blinked. <em> She means with the initial suggestion? When she’d put me to sleep anytime we came close to having some kind of… intimate moment? </em></p><p>“Are you implying that you think you did to me what those McDonalds commercials did when they interspliced ‘You really want a Big Mac’ in every other frame of their advertisements?”</p><p>Agatha snorted at that, then promptly covered her face, annoyed that she’d let herself laugh, and shook her head. She looked both mildly delighted and absolutely defeated by Rio’s humor about the situation. </p><p>“It’s honestly offensive how relaxed you’re being about this,” she muttered. </p><p>She shut the closet’s sliding door, and quickly identified the next victim of her nervous manhandling — it was the bootleg Da Vinci art that was hanging on the wall. She began to fruitlessly adjust the frame to make it ‘more straight.’ </p><p>“I’m honestly not feeling very relaxed,” Rio said, feeling her heartbeat rise in her neck as she watched Agatha tilt the picture frame further and further from its point of origin. The action was a very appropriate metaphor for their ongoing conversation. “I’m trying to tell you that I — that everything I said, every single time I said it, has been true. From the very beginning, until now. And you’re telling me that it’s somehow a delusion.” </p><p>Agatha froze, her fingers stilling on the wall. Rio’s vampiric hearing picked up on the stutter in Agatha’s heartbeat. How her blood rushed to her head then down again.</p><p>“Don’t say things you don’t mean,” Agatha whispered coldly. As in — <em> Don’t tell me you love me. </em>“You’re still coming out of the haze. It’s all fresh.”</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw. She was begging to feel furious. A fury she felt in her fingertips, then traveled down to her arms, legs, and suddenly she was getting off the bed, turning the corner, and stalking right up behind Agatha where she stood adjusting the picture.</p><p>She took the woman by the hips, and turned her around. Rio was still remembering the controls to her body, so the movement was harsher than she meant it—Agatha spinning around clumsily in her grasp, her eyebrows raised, her face flushed. Rio steadied her with two firm hands, drilling an apology into Agatha’s skin with her fingertips.</p><p>“Don’t tell me what I <em> mean </em>, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha breathed in for one count, then two—looking deeply, fearfully, into Rio’s eyes, then down at her lips. </p><p>Making the sort of face she made back in Bucharest. </p><p>But this time—Rio cupped her cheek, not the other way around.</p><p>“Don’t panic,” Rio said softly. “It’s okay.”</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha whimpered. The sound sent a shock through Rio’s whole body. “It’s going to happen again.”</p><p> “No,” Rio insisted shakily. “It won’t.”</p><p>She looked down at Agatha’s lips. How they were bleeding from Agatha chewing nervously on them. Rio wanted to run her tongue across them and make it all better. Suck them into her mouth and dissolve every stupid thought and theory from Agatha’s Rube Goldberg Machine of a brain.</p><p>She inched closer, the intention filling her brain like a singularity. Pupils blown, her eyes looked to Agatha’s for permission. </p><p>“Don’t kiss me,” Agatha said instead, trembling. “Please.”</p><p>Rio froze. Arctic-cold water dumped over her. She dropped her hand like it’d been burnt.</p><p>“I—I’m sorry,” Rio stuttered, feeling terrible. Guilty. <em> Bad. </em>“I won’t.”</p><p>Agatha sensed her turmoil and frowned. “Fuck—I don’t mean it like <em> that. </em> I just. Wait.”</p><p>Agatha broke them apart and stalked angrily toward her set of drawers. She squatted, yanked the bottom-most one open, and fished to the very bottom of a bunch of clothes to find a black blindfold. Rio’s mouth hung open as she watched Agatha tie it around her own face, then wobble back up, using the drawers to steady herself.</p><p>“Sit on the bed,” Agatha instructed, using her hand to guide herself to the right side of the mattress. “On the opposite side, facing away from me.”</p><p>“Agatha, this is…”</p><p>“Ridiculous?” Agatha scoffed. “Yes, Rio. It is ridiculous. But you know what’s even more ridiculous? The idea of me experiencing again what I just went through in the last forty-eight hours. That is much more ridiculous. Now sit.”</p><p>Feeling thoroughly chastised, Rio complied. She sat on the opposite side of the mattress, and then scooched in, so her and Agatha’s backs were pressed to each-other, looking away.</p><p>But she still allowed herself the small gamble of reaching for Agatha’s hand. Agatha made a small, wistful sound, but she let Rio hold it, in the small space between them.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, letting the back of her head rest against Rio’s. “This is better.”</p><p>“I’m not sure about that,” Rio laughed hollowly. But the feeling of Agatha’s skull resting on hers—of any part of them touching, even in the slightest—was enough to make her body warm.</p><p>“Everything is relative, you asshole,” Agatha muttered, but there was nothing sharp about her words. “I’m going to talk now.”</p><p>Rio wanted to make some stupid comment at that—something like, <em> haven’t you been talking this entire time already— </em>but she could sense Agatha’s hesitance from the long breath she took in.</p><p> So she stayed quiet and still, and waited for Agatha with the patience of a saint.</p><p>“First of all, I’m sorry for trying to tell you what you feel. But in my defense, it’s sort of my specialty. And I’m really good at it.”</p><p>Rio laughed, and that laugh must have spurred Agatha on, because Rio could feel her sag into her—her body weight being held by the firm muscles in Rio’s back.</p><p>“I’m just. Terrified. Frankly. For many reasons. Some of which should be obvious, but the more pernicious one is that I’ve had a thousand years of living with these powers, and I still don’t understand them. I pretend that I like them, that I enjoy using them, but I don’t. They terrify me.”</p><p>Agatha spread her free hand across the covers, prodding her sharp nails into the fabric of the comforter. Rio watched her red acrylic trace a line like it was a stream of blood.</p><p>“You know how I feel most days?” Agatha laughed hollowly. “Like one of those giants from the German fairytales. The ones that are always stepping on people with their big murderous toes.”</p><p>“You <em> did </em> kill a man with one of your heels once. Twice.” </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes in amusement. “Hm, yes, I did — I must be subconsciously feeding my own narrative — but nonetheless. You never see any media, any <em> poetry, </em>about the feelings of giants. No one ever asks the giants how it makes them feel to spear those little village people through the chest. And rightfully so. No one cares.”</p><p>Agatha speared the comforter with her nail, stretching its threads like the innards of a beast, then sighed, retracting it.</p><p>“There’s simply no playbook for being the bad guy. And if there was, it would have one page — one page that just said <em> Feel awful about everything and then do it again. </em>Because that’s exactly what I’m doing. I have no other setting. I’m a giant and I step on people. I certainly don’t go to therapy and wax poetic about how it felt. So I certainly don’t know how to have this conversation. I don’t know what to say because I’m scared if I say the wrong thing, I’ll just—”</p><p>She made a slow swirling motion with her fingers on the mattress, imitating the Suggestion eye movement. And Rio’s chest ached for her, so much so that before she could open her mouth again, say another word, Rio squeezed her hand and cut her off.</p><p>“You’re not the bad guy for being a victim of something out of your control.”</p><p>Agatha stilled. Rio could hear her knees rising to her chest, her voice breaking slightly when she whispered, “That doesn’t change the fact that I can’t control it.”</p><p>Rio shook her head adamantly. </p><p>“But there has to be a solution for that, Agatha. We can find it.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, then let out a long, exhausted sigh.</p><p>“Your kindness towards me is ridiculously persistent. And annoying.”</p><p>“It has to work extra hard to beat your stubbornness.”</p><p>Rio could practically hear Agatha’s smirk just from the way the back of her head moved. And for a moment afterward, they sat in a small bubble of easy silence, as if nothing had changed.</p><p>The wind rattled the creaky shingles on the window outside, and Rio felt a question burning the back of her throat like bile. And, like bile, it eventually found its way out.</p><p>“Is it selfish of me to ask if you feel the same way?” she whispered. “The way I did… back in Bucharest?”</p><p>There it was again — that ferocious <em> thump, thump, thump </em>in Agatha’s neck at the question. Her entire body went rigid against Rio’s, like a cat with its tail straight in the air. </p><p>“Azaleas.”</p><p>Rio stilled. Not <em> no. </em> But, instead, <em> I don’t feel safe to answer. </em></p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, and squeezed her hand. “It can wait.”</p><p>
<em> For you, I’m happy to wait forever.  </em>
</p><p>But also—<em> if I can help it, I want to get to forever as fast as I can. </em></p><p>“So,” Rio said, redirecting their ship towards safer water. “I assume you have a plan.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s bones relax against her again. The other woman turned to her, still with the blindfold on, but with one of those stupid smiles that Rio would spend eternity with.</p><p>“<em>Of course </em> I do.”</p>

<p>Agatha wasn’t avoiding her, exactly. That would be too obvious of a thing for her to do.</p><p> Instead she was doing something much more confusing and infuriating, which was pretending like everything was fine.</p><p>It had been approximately ten hours since Rio had come to the realization that she’d been in love with her roommate for five hundred years and counting, and, because she now lived in mortal fear of forgetting everything, she had been meticulously recording the events since in a tiny nebula-themed diary in her room while Agatha, err, “cleaned.”</p><p>(The vacuum had been blasting noisily for an hour and a half, but Rio was pretty sure it hadn’t moved from its original position in the kitchen since Agatha had plugged it in. </p><p>Further evidence for this theory was that the last time she peeked outside her bedroom door, Rio saw Agatha lousing on the couch on Tiktok, her legs hoisted over the back, her head dangling from the cushions, like some kind of deranged spider monkey. The pitiful vacuum was still in the same place sucking up the same morsel of food it had started on an hour before.)</p><p>But Rio couldn’t really make fun of her. She was, of course, doing something equally weird. Which was hiding under her comforter, blasting Joan Jett on her iPod Nano, and feverishly re-reading diary entries she’d written not even forty five minutes ago in fear that she’d already lost her memory again. She mouthed the words reverently like she was reading the Old Testament:</p><p>
<em> 8am. Agatha told me in broad strokes about her plan to stop her compulsive suggestions. She seems to think that there’s a vampire out there named Dr. Strange who can perform a type of hypnosis that will make her issue go away. The catch is, he only does favors for other vamps in some pretentious association called ‘the council,’ which richard ashcroft in some way belongs to, and which she has literally never mentioned to me before now, despite it being very related to the plan we’ve had the whole time. I can’t even be mad because at this point I should just expect that all agatha plans will involve secret second-layer plans that I will never be privy to until they’re slapping me in the face. </em>

</p><p>
<em> 9:30am. Every time I try to get physically close to Agatha, her whole body tenses up, and she gets so… eerily, uncharacteristically quiet. It’s not like she outright rejects me, but it’s like she can’t let herself relax into it at all. Even if it’s just a friendly, innocuous sort of touch like we always do – like just sitting close together on the couch while we watch the morning news. I keep thinking about how, right before we finished the unwinding, she told me if I wanted her after it was done, I could have her. And I do – want her, I mean. Badly. Interminably. But I can’t understand what she wants. What she needs before she’s ready to talk to me. I don’t want to make her uncomfortable. I’m so insanely confused. </em>
</p><p align="center">

</p><p>
<em> 11am. The bite is acting up again. I can’t quite explain it, but it’s like I can feel something radiate from that rough patch of skin in my neck where she bit me. It feels so warm there, and that warmth travels through me like a poison. Soon enough my entire body is humming, and I’m finding myself rubbing my thighs together unconsciously, trying to get some kind of relief, like some kind of horny teenager. I suppose it’s a good thing that she won’t let me near her now, because I don’t think I’d be able to stand it. </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ </em>
</p><p>
<em> 12pm. She’s been texting someone for the past hour. I think it’s that Maximoff woman. For some reason, the longer she sits there tapping on her phone with that dumb little furrowed brow, the more I feel vaguely nauseous and pissed off — like something is burning within me that makes me want to grab her iPhone and stomp on it. I know Agatha would be furious with me if I did. She didn’t get Apple Care on the new model. Is this jealousy? </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ . 　⁺ 　 . ✦ </em>
</p><p>Eventually Rio set down her journal and decided to intimidate the phone out of Agatha’s hands herself. </p><p>This was an easier task than she anticipated, as Agatha was more than happy to stop texting Wanda if it meant avoiding any sort of discussion with Rio. </p><p>She handed the phone to her and said “I’m done vacuuming. Handle the ginger yourself, I’m getting Starbucks,” before plucking her coat off the wall and whisking out of the kitchen like some kind of full-time employee on a lunch break. The vacuum still noisily roared in the back.</p><p>The brief conversation gave Rio such whiplash that all she could do was stare down at Agatha’s home screen, and look at the preview of the singular text with Wanda that Agatha had yet to open. </p><p>
<b>ginger dracula: no im still not going to help you with your richard idea. not until you actually take my suggestions seriously. i have a number for one once you’re ready.</b>
</p><p>Rio’s mouth screwed into a frown. </p><p>
<em> A number for what? </em>
</p><p>Like most things with Agatha, this was a question she’d only get an answer to much, much later. Beyond the point where it mattered.</p><p>But before that, Agatha got home, vanilla latte in one hand, and one of those cookie-croissant-things in a bag for Rio in the other. She placed it on the coffee table like one would a peace offering, then went to go wash her hands in the kitchen.</p><p>It was truly a testament to just how deprived Rio was of Agatha’s affection that the fact that she had gotten her a random trendy gimmick dessert had Rio swooning like a middle schooler. And, sure, having her heart flutter over something so minuscule would be humiliating if she could feel humiliation anymore, but she’d long forgotten that impulse. </p><p>One thousand years of living taught her to operate life under dog-begging-for-treat logic: the canine tenet that desperation wasn’t something to be embarrassed of, it was the only thing that ever landed you what you wanted.</p><p>This was the delusion she fed herself when she tried to sit next to Agatha on the couch for the fourth time that day. And her theory felt very validated when Agatha, for the first time, did not instantly get up like she’d been bitten by a wasp, and insist she had to suddenly “do the laundry” or something equally ridiculous that Agatha would never do.</p><p>But no, Agatha did not get up. She sat there, and Rio felt powerfully victorious for it. It probably only happened because she was too consumed with something on her laptop, but Rio took it as a win nonetheless—she sat there, and ate her croissant, and got crumbs on her shirt, and watched her roommate with a doctorly focus, all the while feeling like she was that woman who observed monkeys from up-close.</p><p>
<em> Jane Goodall? </em>
</p><p>Much like an adorable chimp, Agatha took a long noisy sip from her latte as she reached for her credit card on the coffee table. Her laptop screen was currently housing four different windows—one for Google Flights, another with the map of Europe, a third featuring some encrypted Signal conversation with a shady document-forger that Agatha was speaking to in Romanian, and the fourth a Youtube drama podcast that she kept randomly clicking on.</p><p>Rio knew this much: Agatha was in the process of getting them new fake ID documents for a trip across the pond. This suspicion came from the fact that an hour ago she’d forced Rio to pose for a passport photo in their bathroom, and Rio had tried her hardest not to kiss-slash-bite the living shit out of Agatha when the other woman had tucked Rio’s hair behind her ear, readjusted her part with a comb, and stared at her longingly for a little too long afterward.</p><p>But because she was nothing if not patient, Rio had refrained from doing any of those activities (kissing, biting, throwing herself out of the nearest window), ignoring the incessant pulsing in her bite-mark and convincing herself to care about Agatha’s plan. </p><p>Which, let the record show, she really did not.</p><p>“Are you going to tell me where we’re headed,” Rio began, once she had thoroughly mutilated her croissant, and its gore was sitting in pieces all over her shirt. “Or am I going to find out on the plane?”</p><p>Agatha’s head lazily turned to her. The vampire’s hair was a mess of adorable bedhead, half-up, half-down, and she was wearing sunglasses inside, causing her to squint horribly at both the screen, and now at Rio. It made Rio’s heart wrench. And because she was high on the fact that Agatha was letting her this close, she did something foolish.</p><p>Something foolish like <em> touching her. </em></p><p>“We have blackout curtains, you know,” Rio said, sliding her hand delicately over Agatha’s cheek and slowly removing the raybans, earning a very displeased frown—and immediate, panicked goosebumps—from the other woman when Rio set them aside on the table. “Also, I’m not sure the Suggestion cares about your UV filter.”</p><p>“It’s better than a blindfold,” Agatha muttered, putting the sunglasses back on almost instantly. But notably she did not spring off the couch and flee, so, progress.</p><p>“Neither of which I think are necessary.”</p><p>Her hand had made it to Agatha’s knee without thinking. Despite being unable to see her eyes, Rio could still see the way Agatha swallowed—throat bobbing.</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“Don’t get up and leave again. If you’re not ready to talk about all of it, fine. But it’s dickish of you to avoid me like I’m carrying the plague. I have all my vaccines, Agatha. You can touch me without succumbing to disease.”</p><p>Agatha let out a long, chastised breath. One she punctuated with a frown.</p><p>“I haven’t been avoiding you.”</p><p>Rio glared at her, unamused.</p><p>“Okay, second request. Stop gaslighting me over things that are patently obvious. It’s only endearing up to a certain point.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her a moment, as if weighing how seriously to take that allegation.</p><p>“Ugh, fine,” Agatha groaned. She fidgeted nervously with her sunglasses. “You were so much easier to fool before you got your brain back. This fully functioning mind of yours is frustratingly observant. I might have to start putting garlic in your drinks to dumb you down a little so I can get away with my usual stuff again.”</p><p>Rio laughed, because this woman was unapologetically insane. “Oh, I’m so sorry. Poor unlucky you. Next time I’ll be merciful and shoot bullets into <em> your </em> temporal lobe instead.”</p><p> “Temporal what? You know I have zero idea what that is.”</p><p>“The memory center, Agatha. Context clues.”</p><p>Agatha waved her hand dismissively.</p><p>“Modern medicine is so exhausting. I stopped caring after we left latin.”</p><p>“I’m well-aware. I said <em> I’m </em> the one caught up on my vaccines. Your body, meanwhile, is probably on the US government’s list of possible pandemic-starters, next to cave bats and feral poultry. Drinking your blood probably set my immune system back a few millennia.”</p><p>Agatha laughed in angry delight. “Oh, fuck you. You love my blood.”</p><p>“I never said I didn’t,” Rio laughed hollowly. “It’s all I can think about most days.”</p><p>Her mind quickly catching up to her words, Agatha breathed in shakily. Rio expected her to go back on her implicit promise and flee right then—but instead she did something completely unexpected, and let go of the wheel completely, thrusting them into a conversational traffic jam.</p><p>“Is your bite bothering you as well?” Agatha asked, her tone even.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. The question caught her so off guard that she babbled out her next words. Had Agatha been experiencing the same thing?</p><p>“Yes. I didn’t — yours is, too?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And you’ve been feeling—” </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha hissed, cutting her off.</p><p>A beat passed. The space between them on the couch suddenly didn’t seem large at all. </p><p>Rio could feel the pulse of Agatha’s heartbeat as if it was her own—through the fabric of Agatha’s light blue impossibly tight jeans, where Rio was still lightly grasping her knee. </p><p>
<em> Ask her now. Ask her now. </em>
</p><p>“Do you ever wonder,” Rio said slowly, letting her fingers spread over Agatha’s kneecap, “If the biting has something to do with the fact that we’ve been able to get this far this time?”</p><p>She had been thinking about it all morning. Clearly, something was different this time around. The farthest her and Agatha had gotten before was a kiss, and a little emotional foreplay. Now they’d fucked against alleyway walls, made out like drunk lovers in bed, fake-proposed to each other under the guise of roleplay, and Agatha’s little problem hadn’t triggered.</p><p>Except for when Rio confessed at the funeral.</p><p>But up until then, something had been starkly different.</p><p>Agatha was silent for a moment. Rio wanted so badly to remove those dumb aviators from her face again so she could see what sort of thought was churning behind those brilliant eyes, but she knew that removing that layer of protection was playing with fire. Having that wall between them might have been the only reason Agatha had let them dance along this line for so long.</p><p>“I have,” Agatha admitted quietly. “And it’s a possibility. A high possibility.”</p><p>Rio felt a tentative excitement bite at her like a fly. She couldn’t stop her face from brightening at the idea that maybe there was a way out of this. </p><p>A simple way.</p><p>She grabbed Agatha’s wrist.</p><p>“Agatha, that’s fantastic.”</p><p>“Rio—”</p><p>“No, let me finish. If that’s true, if the bite really does have some kind of effect on your condition, then if you feel the Suggestion coming on… Just bite me. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy. It’s foolproof. No more accidental bullets to the temporal lobe.”</p><p>She knew it sounded naive and stupid. But she couldn’t help herself. Her brain was dizzy with desire and her neck was pulsing with want and oh god, she didn’t realize how long it had been since they’d last drank from each other until now. She ached for it.</p><p>Agatha sighed, and wiped her hands across her face.</p><p>“Anecdotal evidence is hardly enough to call something foolproof, Rio. What if I don’t bite you quickly enough? What if I bite you, then pull out, and the Suggestion comes back before I can bury my teeth in you again? We’d have to get the timing down to a science. And sex isn’t a science. I don’t <em> want </em> sex with you to be a science. I just want to be able to fuck you how I want to fuck you.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, and Rio felt the needy sound in her stomach. She felt the entire sentence in her stomach—no, lower—unbearably lower. </p><p>“And how do you want to fuck me?” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha’s pupils instantly dilated. The other woman threw her head back slowly, and whimpered. After a moment, she keeled her head back, pulled her knees up to her chest, and pressed her forehead against them, so her face disappeared behind her lazy brown waves.</p><p>“This isn’t fair to you,” she muttered, muffled by her pants.</p><p>Rio didn’t expect that. She wanted to disagree on principle, or rather because she wanted Agatha more than she wanted to be treated well, but at the end of the day she wanted an insight into Agatha’s mind more than anything, so she asked simply:</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Agatha slowly rose her head again.</p><p>“Because I’m a coward. Against my will, I’m a coward,” she said, and slowly removed her sunglasses. Setting them aside, she fixed Rio with a meaningful look. “Every time I try to tell you something real, my body clams up like a fucking shell. Every muscle inside of me is petrified I’ll say something to trigger the Suggestion, and we’ll be back to square one. And yet I still want to touch you so, so badly, as if I have any right to, when I can’t have an honest discussion with our clothes on. I might be a toxic, murder-happy narcissist, but even I can spot that double standard.”</p><p>Rio pressed down on Agatha’s knees, pushing away the shield that they represented.</p><p>Behind them all that was left was the small, tender presence of a woman who had lost such complete sense of trust in her own body, that the only thing she could think to do with it was to cower in fear like a turtle, her head ducked inside her shell.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said. “I have an idea.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her with a hardness Rio knew was a front.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Don’t talk.”</p><p>Agatha laughed mirthlessly. “Oh, hilarious.”</p><p>“I’m serious.”</p><p>Rio cupped her face, and leaned into her, so her thighs were bracketing Agatha’s legs.</p><p>“I understand why you’re scared. You can’t trust your own mouth. I won’t ask you to. I want you to… tell me how you feel with your body instead. Have a conversation that way.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth parted as if she was genuinely considering the idea—before promptly closing, her expression hardening again. </p><p>“Let me get this straight. You want me to… convey… my emotions… by fucking you… without talking? Like some kind of Suggestion-curse loophole?”</p><p>“Pretty much. Don’t tell me you’re afraid of a little creative thinking, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha laughed incredulously. “I’m not afraid of — oh my god. You're insane.”</p><p>“Am I?” Rio breathed, kissing the side of Agatha’s face, then her neck, before she could think better of it. The woman groaned underneath her. “You can wear the blindfold, too, if that makes you feel better. Or the ridiculous sunglasses. You can have your wall, Agatha. Whatever that looks like. Just let me in another way. I’m clawing at the doggy door at this point.”</p><p>“Fuck — fuck this. Fuck you.”</p><p>Agatha seized her by the hair, and pulled her up into a sudden, needy kiss. White exploded behind Rio’s eyes, and Agatha was whimpering into it like she’d been gagged—and Rio only realized afterward that she was practicing to see if she was capable of shutting up.</p><p>After three long, wonderful seconds, Agatha proceeded to drag their lips apart with a similar intensity, as if she was being forced to kiss Rio instead of forcing Rio to kiss <em> her, </em> her fingernails raking across Rio’s scalp. Her eyes were red, but not swirling, when she demanded:</p><p>“Fine, you idiot. I won’t speak,” Agatha breathed. “We’ll — <em> have a conversation. </em>”</p><p>Before Rio could nod, and kiss her again, Agatha interceded,</p><p>“Go get the blindfold. And the strap in my underwear drawer.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Rio had not breathed since Agatha said <em> go get the strap from my underwear drawer. </em></p><p>Since she had been busy subconsciously pining for her friend for five hundred years, Rio had not gotten very explorative in the bedroom. Scratch that, she had not gotten explorative at <em> all. </em></p><p>In the past few weeks she had remedied that by daydreaming of Agatha in practically every position. Fucking her from just about every angle. Teeth in, teeth out.</p><p>But she hadn’t let herself think about this.</p><p>She wasn’t sure why. </p><p>Rummaging through Agatha’s expensive clothes like they were piles of trash, careful not to break her dresser completely, Rio contemplated this question. The answer she came to was shame.</p><p>Shame because she wanted it so badly, it made her squirm.</p><p>And that was the strange thing about desire, wasn’t it? That the more you wanted something, the more shameful it seemed? Like desire in itself was deserving of punishment?</p><p>With great annoyance, she pushed aside the haunting remnants of her Spanish-Catholic guilt, and found the toy moments later, wrapped in several layers of black lingerie. </p><p>It didn’t seem like Agatha to keep something like this so tucked away, which made Rio wonder if she, too, wanted it so badly that it became a sort of depravity. </p><p>“I wasn’t sure if you wanted me to wear it, or if you wanted to wear it, so.”</p><p>Rio licked her lips awkwardly as she put it between them on the couch. It was five inches and black, the attachments sitting next to it, pushed up on the cushion.</p><p>Agatha bit down on her lip, her cheeks going a rare red.</p><p>“I—” She stopped herself, scared again, and shook her head. Rio could tell that Agatha was trying to tell her something with her eyes when she said, “You asked me how I’d like to fuck you.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly.</p><p>“I want to — to ride you,” Agatha mumbled. “This time. If that’s something you’d like.”</p><p>This time, implying <em> future times, </em> made Rio so happy that her brain completely glided over the first part of the sentence. She wanted Agatha over and over again until the world ended. But then she eventually did hear that first part — <em> I want to ride you </em>— and it felt like she’d just slammed the brakes on her car in front of a family of five. Her entire world spun on its axis.</p><p>Not just because Agatha wanted her. But also because Agatha, more specifically, wanted Rio <em> inside of her. </em> The same Agatha who had told her she’d only ever given, never received, not with anyone except Rio. This <em> was </em> a conversation, an implicit one — Agatha trusted her.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio stuttered. When that didn’t sound enthusiastic enough for Agatha, Rio nodded her head and blew out a breath. “Yes. Yes. I’d like to.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Like it was a business transaction, and not literally changing Rio’s entire perspective on life, Agatha nodded curtly.</p><p>She put on her dumb aviators again and then led Rio into a standing position, grabbing the harness and pressing it lightly, innocently against Rio’s center.</p><p>“Have you ever worn one of these before?”</p><p>“No,” Rio stuttered.</p><p>“You’re a quick study. You’ll do just fine.” Agatha patted at the side of her pajama pants. “Take these off. I’ll show you how to get into it.”</p><p>Rio knew she wasn’t being Suggested, but the way her body responded, she might as well have been actively enthralled.</p><p>She shrugged off the pants and tossed them aside, then struggled to keep her composure as Agatha helped her slide into the harness, tightening the straps around her barely-there black underwear. </p><p>Once it was secure, Agatha breathed a shaky breath out, grabbed the strap from the couch, and began to studiously screw it over Rio’s crotch, like it was a car part and Rio was some kind of damaged convertible.</p><p>The whole thing was both entirely mechanical while also deeply fucking hot, setting every single nerve ending on Rio’s body on fire. She could feel how wet she was without even moving — her entire body thrummed.</p><p>Agatha let her hands glide up Rio’s body, the hair on Rio’s arms standing rod-straight as the other woman slowly met her eyes again. </p><p>Or as much as she could, through those dumb sunglasses.</p><p>“Once we start,” Agatha breathed. “I’m going to stop talking.”</p><p>“Okay. But remember —”</p><p>“I remember the safeword, Rio,” Agatha rolled her eyes. “I won’t need it.”</p><p>She pushed Rio down onto the sofa, and Rio fell like a ragdoll, her arms feeling useless by the sides of her. Tugging a lip in, Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“<em>God, </em>you look good like that.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, Agatha hastily pulled her shirt off her head, and kicked her pants away, so she was just in her purple bra and matching underwear. </p><p>“Change of plans. I’m going to allow myself three words,” Agatha said, because <em> of course, </em> as she walked toward Rio methodically. “Ones that I’m sure won’t trigger anything.”</p><p>She settled onto Rio’s lap, so the strap was pushed up between them. Rio moaned at the mere image of it. Her brain had gone completely mush, the only thing that mattered to her suddenly being the idea of Agatha on top of her, of her <em> inside </em> Agatha—</p><p>“Can I bite you?” Rio moaned.</p><p>Agatha laughed. “I wasn’t done talking.”</p><p>“Are you ever?” Rio teased back, shoving her tongue into the side of her mouth.</p><p>“Shut up. And yes you can bite me. But only once you’re inside.”</p><p>Agatha took the base of the strap in her hand, and pressed roughly downwards on it, so the pressure grated abruptly against Rio’s center. When Rio whimpered, her hips canting up, Agatha felt spurred on, and continued to move it up and down languidly, driving Rio insane as she pressed her nose to Rio’s cheek, and began to speak into her ear.</p><p>“My first word is <em> more,</em>” she whispered. “Second word is <em> coming </em> — when, well, <em> you know. </em>The third word I get is your name. Because I want to say it after the second one.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes nearly peeled back inside her head. Agatha’s hand hadn’t stopped moving the entire time, stroking up and down and pushing the base of the strap against her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed. “I’m going to second word against this harness if you keep doing that.”</p><p>Agatha grinned like a shark, and oh god how Rio had missed it.</p><p>“Put the blindfold on me.”</p><p>Rio was briefly disappointed that Agatha still felt like she had to wear it even though they’d agreed to these restrictive terms, but she wanted Agatha to feel safe more than she needed anything else. So she complied with a nod, tenderly tying the black ribbon around her eyes, and pressing a kiss to Agatha’s cheek once it was secured. Agatha breathed in shakily.</p><p>“Ok,” Agatha said. Then, she ran a thumb over her own lip. “More.”</p><p>Rio understood what she meant immediately.</p><p>She threaded her fingers through Agatha’s hair, and pushed her gently forward, connecting them in a kiss once again. And Rio wasn’t sure what it was — the elaborate rules, the blindfold, the headiness of everything — but she could feel Agatha finally relax against her, her hands softly palming the fabric of Rio’s shirt, her lips soft and gentle, like she wanted to take her time.</p><p>It was everything Rio didn’t expect this sex to be. She expected it to be <em> we both need to fuck eachother because vampire biological instinct and sure maybe I’ll try and communicate some semblance of my own feelings along the way, </em>but instead it was tender, and slow, and Agatha was cupping her jaw and whimpering against her lips and it really did feel like a conversation.</p><p>It felt even more so like a confession when Agatha broke their kiss slowly, and began to press her lips softly to the side of her face, her cheeks, her forehead, turning Rio’s head with a certain but tender grasp around her chin. And when she was done with that, she pulled back and just smiled at her, sweetly, and even with her eyes covered, even though she couldn’t see Rio and Rio couldn’t see her, it still felt like she was pouring her heart out into a single look.</p><p>Rio almost couldn’t handle it. She almost had to end it all right then and there. Because if Agatha didn’t love her the way Rio loved her, it was almost unbearable. Because Rio loved her so aggressively, viciously, violently. She wanted to protect this woman from everything that could possibly endanger her. And with Agatha that tragically included herself.</p><p>But then, because Agatha was nothing if not the personification of ripping a bandaid off, she took her hand and placed it on Rio’s faux-cock again, and pressed down. Repeated the same motions as before, only more aggressively. Rio was about to remind her that she could in fact <em> feel it </em> when she did that, when Agatha sidled closer, and pressed <em> herself </em> against it.</p><p>And promptly moaned.</p><p>“More,” Agatha said, and this time it was less clear what she meant. Rio got the message when Agatha pulled Rio’s hips up toward her. Whimpering, Rio abided—canting her hips repeatedly into Agatha, so the strap rubbed against Agatha’s center, and pressed into Rio at the same time. It was stimulating them both.</p><p>“Oh god,” Rio mumbled into Agatha’s shoulder. “I’m going to come.”</p><p>Agatha pushed apart from her abruptly, the strap wobbling between them. Rio rutted into the air with a whine, but Agatha pressed her back down into the couch.</p><p>“No you aren’t,” Agatha said, matter-of-fact. “Not yet.”</p><p>“Didn’t you only get three words?”</p><p>“That was a ridiculous enough statement that I had to violate my own rules.”</p><p>“That’s definitely more than three words.”</p><p>“I’m adding one more word. Bed.”</p><p>She stumbled upward, and Rio led her by the hand toward Agatha’s bedroom. Agatha nearly stumbled over the vacuum cleaner which was still, <em> still </em> plugged into the wall, before they ultimately crossed the threshold into the bedroom. </p><p>Agatha, somehow identifying it even with the blindfold on, slammed the door shut, pushed Rio onto the bed, and then kicked off her underwear. Rio steadied Agatha as she fell on top of her, trying to control her arousal so she didn’t come like a teenager.</p><p>“You’re not allowed to come until I tell you to,” Agatha breathed into her ear as she grabbed the cock and began to position it by her entrance. </p><p>“So many more words than three, Agatha.”</p><p>“Fuck the three words. The blindfold is enough.”</p><p>They kissed again as Agatha lowered herself onto the strap. The other vampire moaned audibly into Rio’s neck as it sank in, and it took every modicum of willpower inside of Rio not to immediately push her hips up into Agatha, allowing her the time to get comfortable with it inside.</p><p>“More,” Agatha quickly said, because Agatha never gave herself time to get comfortable doing anything. She pushed against the strap, and Rio felt it in her core. “More, fuck. Rio.”</p><p>Rio quickly complied, thrusting upward with Agatha on top of her. She felt herself once again heading towards that climax, the image of Agatha in her purple bra, her sporadic brown waves, her mouth whimpering, her eyes hidden behind that strip of black—all too much.</p><p>“God, Agatha, you feel so good,” Rio whined.</p><p>“You feel even better, baby,” Agatha moaned, and stuck her teeth in.</p><p>Rio decided then, like a priest receiving a heavenly vision, that if it felt good being inside Agatha, there was nothing better on planet Earth than being inside Agatha with Agatha’s <em> fangs in her throat. </em>Agatha’s tongue on her nape, licking slowly at the swollen cut.</p><p>“One more word,” Agatha said, moaning as Rio thrust into her, and she sucked at Rio’s neck like she was starved. She said it as if she was in any way abiding by her own rules anymore. “No—two. Three. <em> Three. </em>Three words, Rio. Three words. Three words. Three words.”</p><p>
<em> Three words. </em>
</p><p>Agatha had begun to chant it over and over again like it was a prayer.</p><p>And it clicked for Rio the same time she came.</p><p>Her hips stuttered against Agatha, the strap twitching against Agatha’s walls as Rio’s orgasm shuddered over her. She wanted to so desperately echo what Agatha was trying to tell her — to say <em> I love you, too, I love you, too, I love you, too </em>— but she knew it might terrify her.</p><p>So instead she said, “three words,” in a soft, broken mumble against the shell of Agatha’s ear, and Agatha came with a cry. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio was curling into her seat on a plane to Iceland in the dead of night with nothing but a fake passport and a change of clothing, soon to meet a council of vampires that could probably end her life with a blink, and all she could think about was one thing.</p><p>And that one thing was currently trying to order wine during takeoff.</p><p>“You <em> must </em> sit down, ma’am.”</p><p>“No, actually, I think <em> you </em> must sit down.”</p><p>“Ma’am, if you don’t sit down in the next five seconds, the authorities <em> will </em> be called when we land.”</p><p>Rio had to hand it to the plane staff. Calling the bluff on thousand-year-old menace Agatha Harkness was truly something deserving an award. Maybe a trophy.</p><p>“Fine! God. I’m going, I’m going,” Agatha groaned, throwing her hands in the air. </p><p>The plane was nearly at a ninety degree angle by the time Agatha fell into her seat, a full bottle of wine cradled in her hands like a newborn. Rio could feel the back of her neck burning with the intensity of the flight attendant’s wrath being pointed at the two of them. </p><p>“I hate flying economy,” Agatha seethed, twisting the bottle cap open.</p><p>“Then Suggest us into Business class.”</p><p>Agatha took a long swig of the wine, rubbed her hand over her mouth, then pinned Rio with a glare through dark sunglasses. “Don’t taunt me, you hag.”</p><p>Rio grinned as wide as a child.</p><p>Both Agatha and Rio were on a collective break from all suggestions since Rio’s little re-awakening, which meant they had to actually spend their money wisely. Combined with the fact that they purchased these flights on such short notice, they’d ended up in Economy Class.</p><p>This was not a problem for Rio, who could appreciate a tight space. (She was known to sleep in old coffins to prank tourists.) It was a fate worse than death for Agatha Harkness.</p><p>And, Agatha Harkness, never one to give in gently to an unpleasant situation — and thank God for that, or else she would have given up on Rio five hundred years ago — the other vampire was currently writhing in her seat like a cat trapped under the thumb of a vet, knees ruthlessly kicking at the teenager sitting in front of them. </p><p>She re-adjusted her position every five seconds, making small, strange, guttural noises, until she finally gave up, and put her head on Rio’s shoulder, linking their arms with a huff.</p><p>“I hate this plane. I hate this tiny little television screen. I hate that I’m the flightless variation of vampire. I hate that I can’t Suggest anyone into giving me lorazepam. And I hate that your shoulder is so bony,” she announced bitterly. “It’s like you’re made of skeleton.”</p><p>“Agatha, all humans are made of skeleton.”</p><p>“Well I wish you were made of something more comfortable. Like cotton.”</p><p>“Then I’d be a rug.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha tutted. Rio could tell she was brewing a stupid joke from the way her grip tightened on Rio’s bicep. “You’d look very nice draped on my living room floor.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. But no amount of pretending to be detached and unaffected could stop the warmth that started puttering around in her chest when Agatha kept herself pressed there.</p><p>“You are so predictable,” Rio sighed, shoving the feelings down. “And annoying.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingernails dug into her arm.</p><p>“And you love it,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio’s heart nearly stopped in her chest.</p><p>She looked over to Agatha then, at the way she was curled up into a contorted ball of limbs in her seat, her chaotic brown waves spilling over an oversized dark purple hoodie, her eyes fluttered closed, her mouth in a tiny, deviant smile, and images of last night chewed at Rio like a feral dog off the leash.</p><p>
<em> Three words. Three words. Three words. </em>
</p><p>“I do.” Rio blew out a breath. “Against my better judgement.”</p><p>She felt Agatha’s body heave out a light laugh, and then sag into her.</p><p>Last night, after they’d had sex, Agatha had laid there next to Rio, stock still, for several seconds. Legs and arms and fingers all frozen like a corpse. If it wasn’t for Rio’s super-hearing, she might have thought Agatha had died. But she could hear her pulse scattering like a jet engine. </p><p>Rio hadn’t been brave enough to say anything to her—her mind spinning around the indirect confession over and over again<em> —three words, three words, three words— </em>but luckily she didn’t have to. Agatha had broken the silence a moment later, turning on her side to look at Rio.</p><p>“I’m going to move our flights up,” Agatha had whispered. “I can’t take the waiting anymore.” Waiting for what, Rio wanted to ask. Waiting to say you love me with your whole chest and mean it, Rio hoped selfishly, silently, as Agatha squeezed her hand, slipped the blindfold off, and stalked out of bed. </p><p>Agatha was up all the rest of the night on her computer muttering things to herself. Rio stayed in bed and she didn’t get a blink of sleep — and you could see it in the shadows under her eyes the following morning. Like she’d stepped freshly out of a morgue.</p><p>But how could she sleep after that? How could she ever do anything except exist in wide-eyed shock, trembling at the edge of a panic attack, shivering in complete and utter fear, knowing now that Agatha might love her back?</p><p>Because what else could ‘three words’ mean? </p><p>A hundred things, surely, plausibly, but Rio didn’t let herself even explore those possibilities. She needed it to be simple. She needed it to be <em> I love you. </em>She needed it to be the ribbon that was trapping something much greater inside a gift box. She needed to rip open the wrapping paper and hear all of it come spilling out of Agatha like water from a dam.</p><p>But—Rio reminded herself with a sharp inhale—she was patient.</p><p>And closer than ever to getting what she wanted.</p><p>And the anticipation is all anyone ever really remembers in the end, isn’t it?</p><p>At least, that’s what she told herself as they jumped into a yellow taxi, swerved through Manhattan traffic, trampled through security, and finally landed themselves in this very jet, headed to Reykjavík.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Rio mused, “Does the Council provide hotel vouchers for visitors, or what?”</p><p>Agatha made an annoyed sound as Rio nudged her with their elbow. They were halfway over the Atlantic by then, and Rio could only entertain herself enough by watching Despicable Me on repeat. She had tried to get Agatha to watch the movie with her, insisting that she was actually a lot like the main character, Gru, but Agatha swore off anything animated out of hand.</p><p>The moving pictures made her nauseous, Agatha would insist. Rio knew this was bullshit. Agatha just didn’t like things made for children. Probably because she never got to be one.</p><p>That was one of the things Rio would do first, once the curse was lifted.</p><p>She wanted to give Agatha a childhood. Of course she couldn’t travel back in time and kill Evanora Harkness straight out of the cradle—but she wanted to approximate something like it. She wanted to make Agatha feel so safe, and secure, that it was almost stifling. </p><p>She wanted to fill her life with freedom, and love, and the whimsy you only get at eight years old. She wanted to erase Agatha’s brain of every bad thing Evanora had ever said to her.</p><p>And she wanted to remember every second of it. </p><p>“Ha ha. You’re not funny,” Agatha mumbled slobberly against her shoulder. But the way Rio could feel her smile said otherwise. “I booked us a bedroom already.”</p><p>Rio grazed her hand down Agatha’s back and hummed, “<em> One </em> bedroom?”</p><p>“Oh, don’t get puritanical on me now.”</p><p>“I’m just asking questions.”</p><p>“Useless questions,” Agatha muttered. “Yes, we’ll even have to sleep in the same bed. Is that okay with you, Hester Prynne?”</p><p>“We both know you never finished The Scarlet Letter.”</p><p>“I don’t need to read a book to taunt you with it.”</p><p>Rio laughed, raking her hand through Agatha’s hair. She listened to the other woman’s breath stutter a bit. It was almost inaudible compared to the roaring of the plane’s engine.</p><p>“I like when you —” Agatha cut herself off.</p><p>Rio’s hand stilled.</p><p>“When I?”</p><p>“<em>That. </em> The thing you just stopped doing.”</p><p>Rio felt her heart squeeze. </p><p>“Playing with your hair?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a non-committal mutter. Rio took it as a <em> yes. </em></p><p>“Okay, baby,” Rio teased, feeling the pet name fall out of her. </p><p>Rio’s whole body tensed when she realized she’d said it. They’d never said it outside of sex, outside of the raw intimacy of the night time—but Agatha didn’t protest, didn’t even blink, she just hummed into Rio’s side, and said, “First word.”</p><p>
<em> More. </em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>As the flight attendants went down the aisle pouring tea and coffee, New York Night transitioning jarringly into Iceland Morning, Rio was left to wonder, as she often did, what exactly Agatha meant.</p><p>If she meant <em> More </em> as in <em> please, never stop calling me your baby. </em></p><p>Or <em> more </em> as in, <em> Get back to work, my thoughts are too loud when you aren’t itching my skull. </em></p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Knowing Agatha, it was probably both, and also neither.</p><p>Just like her coffee order.</p><p>“We don’t serve red wine for breakfast, ma’am.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had three large suitcases and a carry-on. Rio had a half-full backpack and her iPod. All together they had too much luggage for the bellboy frantically trying to shove it into the rickety elevator on their way to the tenth floor of the Grand Reykjavik Hotel.</p><p>Evidently, Agatha had skimped on the flights so she could spend it all on their temporary living quarters. The one-bedroom was deliriously spacious—with giant, broad windows overlooking the Reykjavik waterfront. </p><p>The walls were made of unpainted wood, and the decoration was minimalist: there was a giant slab of white, empty canvas just sitting above the bed, that Agatha referred to as “chic” and Rio referred to as “pointless.”</p><p>There was also a bathtub. A large brass one, meant for two people.</p><p>“We should take one later,” Agatha offered nonchalantly, and Rio nearly fainted at the idea.</p><p>But that is what it would remain—an idea—at least until they dealt with the real reason they were here. And that was to finish what they’d started. </p><p>Well, what <em> Agatha </em> had started. Rio had sort of been following the plan with the loose haziness that a toddler follows the rules of a board game.</p><p>“So Wanda’s our in?” Rio asked as she unpacked her backpack. </p><p>She pulled out a green corduroy suit, a vintage one with buttons made of ox bone. Agatha had told her to bring something nice to wear. The Council had a dress code. </p><p>“Ha,” Agatha laughed dryly. She was leaning against the bed and looking at Rio’s suit with an unreadable expression. “No. She’s completely useless.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Except for the fact that she wired you hundreds of thousands of dollars. Despite the fact that we killed her son-in-law.”</p><p>“Please. She couldn’t stand Richard’s misogynist spawn anymore than she could stand Richard. And to the money, as I said, useless,” Agatha muttered, then threw herself back onto the bed, spreading her arms like a starfish. “A woman needs at least a million these days to buy real estate. Anyway. Our man on the inside is actually your intern. Timothy?”</p><p>“...Billy?” Also <em> not </em> her intern, but.</p><p>“Yeah, sure.” Agatha sat back up and reached for her purse. Inside was a stack of Icelandic króna, a glasses case, and a few folded documents. She snapped open the glasses case and haphazardly shoved the narrow-frame spectacles onto her face, and unfurled the paper.</p><p>
<em> Oh my god she looks so adorable in those. </em>
</p><p>Rio’s heart could hardly handle it. She’d forgotten about Agatha’s farsightedness. </p><p>Probably because Agatha refused to acknowledge it, and instead did all her computer work with her face pressed so close to the laptop screen that her nose repeatedly smudged the webcam.</p><p>Agatha turned the document around so Rio could see it. She pointed to a line that had been underlined in red ink, her long, black fingernail tapping it impatiently. It was an address to a street in some Icelandic town Rio had no idea how to pronounce.</p><p>“Remember when Tim—Billy—<em> whatever </em>— came over to our place and dumbly spread all of his step-brother’s confidential company documents on our table?”</p><p>Rio nodded, clearing her throat. “Sure.”</p><p>“And how he told us about how Tommy was inflating the bottom line of his failed company using a web of overseas investors?”</p><p>“Vaguely.” In truth, Rio hadn’t been listening at all. But she did remember Agatha inspecting the documents very intently when Billy had brought them over.</p><p>“Well, I hired some Romanian hacker off Fiverr to do some digging for me,” Agatha said, then crumpled the paper into a ball, and threw it over her shoulder into a waste bin—perfectly dunking it without even looking behind her. “I gave him the names of the companies Tommy was working with, and he came back with the profiles of the board members for each of them. Of course all these Council guys operate under fake names, so I had him cross-reference the companies with each other, until he figured out which faces and addresses kept reappearing across the different company websites across the globe. Low and behold.”</p><p>She laid the last piece of paper out on the bed.</p><p>It was the board for a company called <em> International Human Management, </em> based in Reykjavik, Iceland. Listed on the colorful print-out were six friendly but stern faces. Rio didn’t recognize any of them until she blinked at the last one, a man named <em> Anthony Black. </em> Her brain itched at a memory. One that had scabbed over.</p><p>“I recognize this guy from somewhere.”</p><p>“Really? That’s impressive. I wouldn’t expect you to, given that you were on the verge of passing out during our little meet-and-greet. That’s Richard Ashcroft. Tommy’s daddy. Wanda’s ex. Oil billionaire. Our <em> guy. </em>He’s on the board under a false name.”</p><p>Rio looked up at her, and Agatha was grinning wolfishly. </p><p>Rio could tell she was impressed with herself. </p><p>Agatha had always enjoyed playing detective. She’d even done a stint of it in the twentieth century, when they were particularly bored and not overly broke.</p><p>It didn’t last long, though—being a cop is kind of an incongruent profession for a serial cop-killer.</p><p>“International Human Management is a pretty hammer-to-the-nail name for a company which is in the business of enthralling the world’s population, but hey. I can appreciate a blunt instrument,” she said, winking at Rio and mouthing <em> like you </em> . Rio immediately blushed. <em> This idiot. </em> The idiot in question continued, “Tommy had an email account at their company courtesy of Papa, so I just used the password we got from Billy to log in to it, and got access to their full calendar, and…” She batted her eyelashes. “Voila, guess who’s attending a company party tomorrow at seven in the beautiful Icelandic countryside?”</p><p>She reached over into Rio’s backpack, plucked her fake passport from its pouch, and then smacked it lightly on Rio’s chest, looking deeply, confidently into her eyes as she did it. </p><p>“Rio Valdez and Agnes Wilkstone are.”</p><p>Agatha giggled, waiting eagerly for Rio’s applause. When she didn’t receive it, she frowned, tossing the passport aside and pouting.</p><p>“What?” she drawled, like a chastised child.</p><p>“<em>Agatha. </em>”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Are you serious?” Rio groaned.</p><p>“Deadly,” Agatha huffed, affronted. “Do you not like my plan?”</p><p>“No, I mean. I love your plan. I just want to confirm the fact that there is no plan.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows screwed together. “Of course there’s a plan.”</p><p>“Right. So let me just go through the details of that plan, then, if you don’t mind.”</p><p>Agatha threw her hands up and nodded.</p><p>Rio blew out a long breath. “The Council has no idea we’re coming.”</p><p>“Correct.”</p><p>“Tomorrow at seven, we’re going to barge in on their party. The party of the most powerful vampires—and most wealthy thralls—in the whole world, all gathered in one place, doing who knows what.”</p><p>“Yep,” Agatha said, crossing her arms and popping the p.</p><p>“And you’re going to—what exactly—effortlessly charm your way into getting Doctor Strange to work on your brain and get rid of whatever you’ve got going on?”</p><p>“Precisely. It’s the most efficient way to get what I want. I could wait around and try to figure out where he lives, track him down, and threaten his wife and children, or something equally boring, but this plan gives me an excuse to dress up. And book us a hotel room with a bath. So.”</p><p>Rio laughed. And laughed, until she wasn’t laughing anymore, and then she was just shaking her head in stupid adoration.</p><p>Because she loved this woman.</p><p>And the truth was, she wouldn’t want it any other way. She picked Agatha because of her chaos, not in spite of it.</p><p>From what Agatha had repeatedly told her, Rio was the most deadly vampire on the planet. A nice compliment, sure, but she always enjoyed an opportunity to test that conclusion.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha. We’ll do it your way.”</p><p>Agatha grinned.</p><p>“I knew you’d come around.”</p><p>“I always do,” Rio mumbled. Then lowered her voice to a whisper, “For you.”</p><p>Agatha’s arrogance melted then, her wolf-grin turning into something softer, less self-assured. Avoiding Rio’s eyes, she tilted her head towards the ground, and studied the cedar floorboards.</p><p>It was almost stunning to Rio how someone who was so larger than life could become so small within seconds, could shrivel in fear when faced with adoration instead of skepticism. </p><p>“In case this goes horribly, catastrophically wrong, which by all accounts it probably will,” Agatha admitted quietly, with a hoarse laugh. “I need to. For the life of me, I need to…”</p><p>Trailing off, she looked up at Rio again, and this time none of that cockiness was there.</p><p>There was a plain, honest need to communicate<em> . </em> Like an inmate standing behind a sheet of glass and wishing they could climb through to the other side. Just desperation.</p><p>A desperation that made her grab Rio by the back of the neck, pull her forward, and press their lips together softly. So softly, without any pretense—no talk of biting, or biology, or memories—that it was as if they did it all the time, like it was simple and effortless. Like it happened everyday. Rio’s heart clenched in a way it never had before. She felt like crying.</p><p>It was a kiss that felt like being in love.</p><p>“Don’t do something stupid like die on me tomorrow,” Agatha whispered against her lips, and Rio felt tears sting her cheeks. “I’ll hate you forever if you do.”</p><p>“That wouldn’t be the worst thing,” Rio laughed into the kiss, because she found she couldn’t do anything else. She grabbed the lapels of Agatha’s blouse and clenched her fingers around them. She needed an anchor. “Hatred and love are very close cousins.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips froze against hers, and a few moments later, she pulled away. </p><p>Rio couldn’t even blame her. </p><p>She knew it was the fear. </p><p>The fear that made it so she didn’t meet Rio’s eyes when their lips disconnected, that made her rush to the bathroom with some paltry excuse. The fear that made it so they ate room service side-by-side, not touching. The fear that made it so they didn’t cuddle at night, even when they both wanted to touch like the moon wants the sun, caught in an inevitable, un-intersecting orbit.</p><p>But there was something between them that was more powerful than inertia, and Rio knew it; she knew it because in the dead of night, when the stars were blinking over the water, Agatha curled into her side, wrapped herself around Rio’s stomach, and mumbled almost incoherently,</p><p>“I’m so glad you found me.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The company office was a three hour journey from the capital, in a town called Vík í Mýrdal. The only convenient way to get there was by car, and—neither of them eager to drive—Agatha booked them two last minute seats on a tour bus heading south.</p><p>Agatha clearly had a lot on her mind during the trip, refusing Rio’s many attempts at chit-chat as she scrawled notes down in a notebook that said <em> Live, laugh, love </em>in Icelandic. </p><p>Rio would have been offended at being so abjectly ignored, but she knew that Agatha’s best moves always came together minutes before the recital. So, leaving her to her reading, she spent the whole drive there glued to the window, eager to swallow the scenery. </p><p>It wasn’t a difficult thing to focus on. Unlike Agatha, who preferred turning into a ripe orange under the sun of an Italian beach, Rio had always held an affection for the northern parts of the world. If there was ever a place to die, she thought, it would be Iceland in the summer. </p><p>It was almost too perfect a place, in the same way an apple shines most when it’s hiding a worm inside. Like one vast Elysium Field, like Homer described in the Odyssey — “the Elysium Fields, where the deathless ones will sweep you off to the world’s end, where life glides on in immortal ease for mortal man” — that’s how she felt now, gazing out the window — like she was crossing over the river Styx, into green fields dusted with gaggles of white sheep, flocks of puffins. </p><p>Had Homer traveled here, she wondered? Had he met the Council himself, thousands of years ago? Had he been a vampire? Is that why he was so concerned about the afterlife? Did he want to imagine a place where even monsters like him could exist somewhere pleasant and pretty?</p><p>Were vampires just like humans, constantly desperate for a place to belong?</p><p>Rio traced her finger on the foggy window. It was a weird idea to digest, that she had been alive hundreds of years, but many vampires had been around for much, much longer. </p><p>She had never met a vampire older than her, not besides the Harkness family, and she could hardly count that encounter as much of a meet and greet. </p><p>She certainly hadn’t arranged time to shake hands and ask questions about the long and elaborate history of their species before shredding them to pieces.</p><p>She sort of wished she had, now. </p><p>It was just — she had never <em> been </em> curious before, about vampires outside her and Agatha. About their lives. Their history.</p><p>It wasn’t an accidental cluelessness. For a very long time, she had been brimming with so much resentment and anger and <em> fury </em> at being forcibly turned, that it felt like ignoring the species she’d turned into was an act of rebellion. An ignorance that kept her closer to her humanity. </p><p>That’s why she never befriended any other vampires. That’s why, when Agatha would offer to teach her about their history, Rio would gently refuse. Eventually, Agatha had stopped offering. </p><p>But now there was nothing Rio wanted more than for Agatha to ask again. </p><p>Suddenly, she wanted to know all of it. </p><p>She wanted to know all the stupid rituals. She wanted to know how to court Agatha like the ancient deathless Elysians would have. What flowers to pick and lay at her beside. What goat or chicken or vegan-imitation-steak to sacrifice by the fire. Because, at the end of the day, loving Agatha meant loving a vampire. There was no pretending otherwise. And Rio didn’t have to forgive the man who ruined her to want to understand the woman who made her feel whole.</p><p>She wanted—she realized with a quiet, desperate breath—to marry like vampires do.</p><p>She wanted to bite Agatha. She wanted Agatha to bite her back.</p><p>The bus went over a bump in the dirt road, and Agatha’s pencil sprung from between her fingers, rolling onto the ground. The vampire groaned, rising from her seat to go searching for it, but Rio intercepted her, pressing her hand softly — well, soft by Rio’s standards — into Agatha’s lap, and forcing her back down into the seat.</p><p>Agatha looked at her, startled. It quickly morphed into something softer. Concern.</p><p>“What is it?” she whispered. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Rio stared at her speechlessly.</p><p>
<em> No. Yes. I want to spend Eternity with you, would you be interested? </em>
</p><p>But Rio kept her trap shut tight. A bus they were sharing with a handful of American tourists and their crying babies was hardly the place for this conversation. </p><p>“I’m fine,” she breathed shakily. She turned her attention to Agatha’s silly little notebook and tapped on it with a fingernail. “What are you scheming, Macbeth?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a second, quizzically—not quite believing her, but also not quite sure what to accuse her of—before finally reaching down beneath her seat and stuffing the notebook into the handbag they’d stolen from the hotel concierge.</p><p>“Nothing too fancy,” Agatha said. “Just a few backup plans.”</p><p>“Care to enlighten me?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said rudely, then grinned at her. “Trust me, you always do better with improvisation. Plus, we won’t need them. I have every reason to believe we’ll receive a very warm welcome. The Harkness name still means something to these people. I met a few of them at Evanora’s galas back in the day, pre-you-know.” She shrugged. “Old friends of my mother.”</p><p>Rio stilled, eyebrows furrowing. “Er, not to sound dense, but won’t these old <em> friends of your mother </em>have an issue with the person who, I don’t know, murdered the entire Harkness clan?”</p><p>Agatha licked her lips. “Not if they don’t know who you are.”</p><p>Rio laughed in disbelief. </p><p>“I know I’m not exactly a social butterfly, Agatha, but people know the story. They’ve heard of me. Wanda said so herself.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Sure they’ve heard of you. You’re famous,” she said, making Rio’s entire body turn to fire when she pressed a quick peck to the side of Rio’s face, as if she couldn’t help but kiss her. “But they wouldn’t be able to put a name to the face. It’s not like you’ve been widely photographed. You’re way more camera shy than me. Why would anyone recognize you?”</p><p>Agatha had a fair point. They’d steered clear of high-ranking bloodsuckers for as long as they possibly could, and when collision was unavoidable, they made sure no one left the encounter breathing. Still, she was skeptical. Especially after what Wanda had said back at the funeral.</p><p>“I don’t know. Wanda seemed to think that the whole vampire community has had a word to say about us. About how we… travel together. They’d probably put two and two together.”</p><p>She trailed off, not wanting to send Agatha into a spiral, but Agatha clearly got the message quick enough. She huffed out a laugh, then reached into her bag for a cigarette.</p><p>“A word about how they think you’re my thrall-slash-concubine, you mean?”</p><p>Rio startled at Agatha’s straightforwardness. A few days ago, Agatha quite literally accused herself of that very thing. Now she was cracking jokes about it. Was the fear in her fading?</p><p>“Yes, that’s what I mean,” Rio said carefully, watching Agatha fish for a lighter. “You can’t smoke in here, you know. We’re on a bus, and the windows don’t roll down.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, putting the cigarette between her lips, “I admit with great hesitance that you might have a point.”</p><p>“About the smoking?”</p><p>“No.” She clicked the lighter several times, but no flame came out. She groaned. “About them recognizing you. You’re right. I’ve let the rumor mill spin around too many times. This is why I wanted you to kill Wanda in the first place. She’s got a terribly big mouth.”</p><p>Rio’s chest lit up in a way it shouldn’t have at actually being able to help sort out part of Agatha’s grand plan for once. Feeling emboldened, she rolled her eyes, and chided dramatically, “Thank you, master. It means a lot for you to consider my input.”</p><p>She expected Agatha to yell at her for that jab, or perhaps stop talking to her entirely, but instead she hit her on the arm, her eyes wide as if she’d realized something. </p><p>“Wait. That’s perfect.”</p><p>Rio laughed, feeling her chest hurt from how much she enjoyed the face this woman made when she thought of an idea. “What did you just think of?”</p><p>“My thrall. That’s what they think you are. We’ll let them think that.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “How will that help?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her as if it was obvious. “They’ll just assume I enthralled you as retribution for killing my family. It makes me look like a dutiful little daughter, and it makes you a lot less intimidating. They won’t be scared you’ll do anything to them unless I tell you to.”</p><p>Rio considered it. Something about it moved her the wrong way, but at the same time, she sort of enjoyed the idea of being Agatha’s mindless eye-candy.</p><p>
<em> Something is seriously wrong with me. </em>
</p><p>“But it <em> will </em> require you keeping your mouth shut for a few hours,” Agatha teased. “No talking unless talked to. That sort of thing. If that’s possible for you.”</p><p>“<em>Possible for me, </em>” Rio laughed. “Oh that is truly, disgustingly rich coming from you.”</p><p>“I never said <em> I’d </em>be good at it. That’s why it’s your job.”</p><p>They shared a long, intense look—equivalent to a game of Chicken—before Rio broke.</p><p>“Fine, I can play a little pretend,” Rio said. And because she couldn’t resist but get a rise out of Agatha, she reached her arm behind her head and scratched lightly at her nape. “How will you refer to me in front of them, then? I presume you won’t use my name. They’d probably look down on a vampire for being on a first name basis with their thrall.”</p><p>Rio could feel Agatha’s pulse skip a beat in her neck. She looked at Rio’s lips, then her eyes, then slowly removed the cigarette from her mouth, and placed it back in the purse. She flexed her hand in her lap, as if it was desperate to touch something, but it clawed at nothing but air. </p><p>“What would you like me to call you?” Agatha asked quietly, maintaining eye contact.</p><p>Rio’s eyes traveled down to Agatha’s neck. At the scarred skin at her nape. Then back at her eyes, glowing faintly red, like two orchard apples. Rio’s entire body buzzed with want.</p><p>“I can think of a lot of things,” Rio said softly, massaging the back of Agatha’s neck in small circles. “I don’t think any of them would be appropriate for our current audience.”</p><p>Agatha’s nails had begun to dig holes in her dress. “Speak quietly, then.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. She’d never met someone less competent at fighting their inner demons.</p><p>But if Agatha was going to ask, she was going to answer. She leaned close to Agatha’s ear and whispered, “I wouldn’t mind being your plaything.” </p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, egging Rio on, so she lowered her nose to Agatha’s neck, and smiled against the skin there — always warm, even when the bus’s air conditioning was blowing like a jet engine from above. She grazed her fangs against it ever slightly.</p><p>The sensation broke Agatha’s mask right down the middle. </p><p>“Jesus <em> Christ, </em> Rio,” she gasped quietly. “There are children on this bus.”</p><p>“The children you were about to hotbox with lung cancer?” Rio laughed, and before Agatha could say something else, something undoubtedly evil and lovely, she bit down.</p><p>She didn’t know what came over her. She blamed Homer. She blamed him for making her think of death and dying and all the things she’d like to do before she was shepherded off to Elysium—how she’d like to propose to Agatha and fuck Agatha and drink Agatha dry.</p><p>Yes, it felt very much like Homer’s fault when Agatha’s blood trickled against her lips, and she nearly moaned into the bus full of other people. </p><p>It was Homer’s fault when she drew away, giving Agatha a mere second to say no — and when she didn’t, when she just looked at Rio with as much desire as the Earth could hold — it was completely Homer’s fault that Rio pressed their lips together.</p><p>The kiss was desperate and needy and short, and Agatha whimpered into it, not moving in her seat. It was a good thing when the bus abruptly halted to a stop, rocking them apart, because Rio had been five seconds away from pressing Agatha against the window.</p><p>“We’ve now arrived,” a grainy, accented voice announced over the intercom. “Please exit.”</p><p>Families began to crowd the middle of the bus, chatting loudly and excitedly about the beach and the fields and the mountains and what to eat for dinner. Panting quietly, Agatha covered her eyes instinctually, and gathered her breath. After a moment, she slowly slid her hands down, so Rio could see her now-quiet irises, and gave Rio a chastising look.</p><p>“Thralls don’t do that, by the way,” she muttered.</p><p>Rio shrugged, feeling emboldened in a way she never had before.</p><p>“This one does.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>They arrived in Vik at five, and hailed a taxi to take them the rest of the way to their destination. The old Italian car crawled up the mountainside, until they were far above the humble little white-painted homes that were dotted across the verdant city. </p><p>As it turned out, the company’s office was not an office but in fact a proper villa — a mansion that reigned high on a ledge that towered over the black sands of the Reynisfjara beach.</p><p>As they pulled into the driveway, the taxi driver moved the rear-view mirror so he could take a look at them. He was an old Icelandic man with a peppery white beard, the kind of man who’d never gotten further than a few miles out of his hometown. But when he talked, he had remarkably good English. Like he regularly conversed in it.</p><p>“How long are you planning to visit Iceland for?” he asked.</p><p>“Just the night,” Agatha said, then waved toward the building. “For the party.”</p><p>“Are you guests of the company?”</p><p>Agatha reached for the handle, but before she twisted it, she said, matter-of fact, </p><p>“No.” She paused for a moment, then added, “We’re just vampires.”</p><p>The man blinked several times into the mirror. Rio furrowed her brows in surprise, looking between them. She was about to open her mouth when he suddenly laughed heartily.</p><p>“Ah,” he said. “Then you must know my Lady.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. <em> He’s a thrall? </em></p><p>“I know several ladies. What’s her name?”</p><p>“She goes by many names,” he said, then waved them off. “I’m sure you’ll meet her inside. Now, chop chop. Out of my car. I need to pick up the other guests. You can find your way in through the back. Mind the koi pond. The fish tend to bite.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus,” Rio muttered. “I thought he was joking.”</p><p>Rio grimaced as she clamped her hand around the fanged fish that was currently attached to her ankle.</p><p>They had traipsed through the overgrown yard on the side of the estate, whose plants and weeds had grown miraculously tall in comparison to the rest of the well-kempt villa — almost as if whoever owned the place didn’t want there to be clear sight lines into the back of the building — and wandered around until they saw a few well-dressed people milling about near a koi pond.</p><p>A koi pond full of cannibalistic fish, Rio concluded, when she finally pried the thing off her leg and saw bite marks on her ankle.</p><p>She threw it back into the pond and kept a wide berth as Agatha laughed, stringing their arms together and heading for the doors.</p><p>“The security here is curiously lax for a gathering of the world’s most prominent bloodsuckers,” Rio mumbled as they approached. </p><p>There had to be over a hundred people in the yard alone, some dressed in tuxedos, others in more traditional attire from various countries — Austrian dirndl, Japanese kimonos.</p><p>Time and place didn’t seem to exist here, it was as if people had stepped through portals from every corner of the Earth and from every period in time, all collected to have one large drunken dinner party.</p><p>“It’s not lax,” Agatha whispered back, not looking at Rio as she said it. She kept her eyes straight forward. “We’re being watched. But don’t go craning your head around—”</p><p>Naturally, Rio was already craning her head around. </p><p>She looked to the rooftops, trying to spy any snipers or eagle-eyed scouts, but there was just floor after floor of open-air balconies, men and women clinking glasses full of sloshing red liquid.</p><p>“<em>Rio, </em>” Agatha teased, but her voice didn’t sound commanding. It sounded terribly adoring, and it drew Rio’s attention to her all the same. “Some discretion, please?”</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio said, in a way that wasn’t sorry at all. “I don’t see a single eye on us.”</p><p>“Spies aren’t very effective if you can spot them.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed a glass of wine, or more likely, blood, from a table they passed, profusely thanked the thrall serving it, and then held the glass casually up to the light. </p><p>“Don’t freak out,” Agatha whispered. “And don’t look back.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Don’t freak out about—”</p><p>Then she saw it.</p><p>In the reflection of the glass, several meters away, back by the koi pond.</p><p>There was a man there. A very tall man with yellow eyes, hollowed out cheeks, and a gaping hole where there was supposed to be a mouth.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Rio whispered harshly. “What the hell is that thing?”</p><p>“Don’t be rude. That <em> thing </em>is a person. Well, formerly.”</p><p>“Right. And we’re just really old anemics.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. She lowered the wine glass, putting that <em> thing </em> out of sight, and they pushed into a wide living room. It smelled like tobacco and red wine, clouds of thick smoke fuming out past wall-to-ceiling windows. It was even more crowded inside than it was out, forcing Rio and Agatha even closer together. Rio could still smell the blood on her neck.</p><p>“Leonard Bianchi, one of the Council members, can control ghosts,” Agatha answered her quietly, almost inaudible in the chatter of the room, “It’s a nasty specialty. But they do make for great watchdogs. I’m sure about ten phantoms have already reported on our presence.”</p><p>“Truly?” Rio asked, genuinely surprised. “I didn’t know ghosts were actually… real. I thought they were a thing humans made up to scare themselves into being good to each other.”</p><p>“You underestimate the power of fear. It finds a way of making itself real,” Agatha said, in a tone that felt briefly too serious, when her attention suddenly shifted elsewhere, to something in front of them, by the bar. She put on a fake smile and began to wave. “They’re coming this way now. Game faces. Don’t talk unless spoken to. Follow my lead.”</p><p>“What are you talking abo—”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness. As I live and breathe. How many years has it been? Six hundred?”</p><p>Rio looked up to find five men and women standing before them. They all looked vaguely middle aged in that way that most truly ancient vampires do. The aging process seemed to round out at forty-five, and after that, it was all up to the quality of the blood. </p><p>This pack of people had clearly been drinking well for centuries.</p><p>That wasn’t just a wild guess, either—she recognized their faces immediately. These were the people on the Board website.</p><p>This was the Council, minus one or two faces. </p><p>You could feel it in their presence. The power wafting off of them was nearly oppressive. It made Rio’s throat tighten, and her knees feel weak in their sockets. None of this seemed to affect Agatha, though. <em> Growing up around old money probably inured her to this sort of thing. </em></p><p>“Nice to see you again, Leonard,” Agatha answered, with an overly sweet smile that made Rio almost cackle at its extreme insincerity. Shaking his hand delicately, she turned her eyes to the other four, who she seemed to similarly recognize. “And Isabella, and Eleanor, and Hans, and… Anne Hathaway? No, Sandra Bullock?”</p><p>The last one smiled, and extended a hand, “Lauren Graham. At least, that’s what I’m going by this century.”</p><p>Rio’s hand flung to her mouth to conceal the laugh that nearly burst out of it. Five pairs of red eyes slid to her, and she went stock still, realizing her mistake. She tried to cough it off.</p><p>“Oh, we absolutely adore your work, Lauren. I think we even met your driver earlier. He gave us a ride up? Very well-behaved thrall, and what a view this place has,” Agatha said, fanning herself. “Gosh, it’s hot in here. You know, we’re only in town for a few hours. I was just planning to stop by for a little visit to see an old friend. Speaking of, I was wondering if maybe—”</p><p>“And you are?” Leonard cut Agatha off, his red eyes pinning to Rio. His gaze had a chilling effect, as if a hundred invisible phantoms had now turned their attention to her. “I don’t believe we’ve met before. Of course, I can venture a guess, but I don’t want to be impolite.”</p><p><em> Don’t talk unless spoken to </em>echoed in Rio’s mouth as she looked toward Agatha. Luckily, she didn’t even have to wait a fraction of a second before Agatha was answering for her, her hand sliding around Rio’s waist. And sure, it was performative, but the motion was also protective in a way that made Rio melt—the grip a little too tight than necessary.</p><p>“My favorite thrall,” she answered brusquely. “Don’t take her silence personally. She doesn’t answer to anyone but me. I prefer them that way — no bark, all bite.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly as their eyes gazed at her like some kind of livestock.</p><p>“Thrall? So it’s true, then. Lady Death, Clan Killer of House Harkness, is your special little lap dog?” Leonard marveled. “Color me impressed, Harkness. I should have known someone of Evanora’s stock would do great things, but still, subduing such a creature…”</p><p>He reached out and took Rio by the chin. She felt herself about to snarl and bite his hand off, but she repressed the instinct at the last second. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see Agatha’s lip twitch. It took a lot to undo Agatha’s facade, especially when she was trying so hard to put on the mask — but him touching her had done enough to make her squirm.</p><p>
<em> She doesn’t want anyone to touch me but her. </em>
</p><p>The raw protectiveness of it made Rio’s stomach turn.</p><p>She was distracted by the sensation of his fingers beginning to prod at her mouth, opening up her lips, like she was a dog at the vet getting its teeth brushed. </p><p>It was getting harder and harder not to kill him.</p><p>“Wow. She’s exceptionally docile,” Leonard said, eyebrows raising. “You must have really done a number on her nervous system. Can she even hear what we’re saying? Or does she mentally turn off when you’re not giving her directions? I haven’t been able to completely erase the sentience on my thralls yet, but Hell knows I’ve tried.”</p><p>He laughed, and his chorus of minions laughed with him. Rio could hear Agatha’s heartbeat beginning to come faster, her fingers drilling into Rio’s side like two knives. When he continued to pry around on her gums, fingers sliding across her upper teeth, Agatha snapped.</p><p>“Get your fingers out of her mouth,” she seethed.</p><p>Leonard’s eyebrows rose just a hair, and his lackeys stilled. The air seemed to have been sucked out of the room in one quick breath.</p><p>But, he did as he was told, and slowly receded.</p><p>“My apologies, Agatha,” he said. “I didn’t realize you had a personal attachment to this one.”</p><p>“I don’t,” Agatha said quickly, trying to regain her composure. Rio felt the comment burn, just a bit. But she knew it was only performance. “I just wouldn’t want you to get bitten.”</p><p>“Of course. How considerate of you.” He smiled like a politician. “Come, let’s not get off on the wrong foot. It’s been so long. Join me by the bar, we have so much to catch up about.”</p><p>He gave Rio another onceover.</p><p>“And I’d love to learn more about <em> her, </em> too.”</p><p>If Rio was finding a hard time not murdering him right now, Agatha was close to grabbing a shotgun. The other vampire’s fingers were all but lodged in Rio’s side. But ultimately, Agatha nodded, plastering her face with that fake smile again.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>They walked to the bar, Agatha’s hand pressed to her midriff the entire time, her entire body radiating with nerves. Rio wanted so much to tell her it was okay—to sketch soothing circles on her back—but she knew even the slightest movement might give them away, so she didn’t.</p><p>“Tell me, does the thrall drink?” Leonard asked, after ordering him and Agatha two Gin and Blood tonics. </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, brushing her hair over her shoulder, and finally releasing Rio. She must have noticed she was holding onto her like an anchor. “Not unless I want her to.”</p><p>Leonard grinned in delight.</p><p>“And do you want her to? It must be fun, getting to do whatever you want with her. Piloting her like a little puppet. If someone killed <em> my </em> mother, I’d do the same thing.”</p><p>Agatha’s lip twitched again, and Rio’s stomach clenched. It was obvious what he was doing. There was no good way to check if someone was a thrall merely by looking at them—their behavior was the only surefire tell.</p><p>He was testing them. And because Agatha refused to ever lose an argument—</p><p>“To hell with it. Why not,” Agatha said, finally, with a purr. She slid her hand into Rio’s hair, and mussed it slightly, scratching at Rio’s scalp. “She’ll have a Vodka Cranberry.”</p><p>It took everything within Rio to not melt at the way Agatha’s fingers were itching across her head. She knew she was just showing off—doing some weird dance of dominance with quite possibly the other most powerful vampire in existence—but <em> god, </em> it was hot.</p><p>“Here.” He handed Agatha the drink, presumably to give to Rio.</p><p>And if it was anyone else, Rio would have found it incredibly, fatally condescending when Agatha physically tilted Rio’s head towards her, took a small sip from the drink, then said to Rio:</p><p>“Open up.”</p><p>But because it was Agatha, Rio’s body did nothing but scream when Agatha’s lips pressed delicately to hers, the alcohol spilling between their mouths like venom. It took everything in her not to grab Agatha by the shoulders and fully kiss her back, whiplash hitting her like a truck when Agatha quickly pulled away, smiling in a way that was only half performative.</p><p>“Oh,” Leonard laughed, raising his glass in cheers. “You’re <em> fun.</em>”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>The next two hours proceeded similarly. Agatha got drunker and drunker, and occasionally she’d get Rio drunk along with her, feeding her a shot through her mouth, or just giving her the glass to sip on.</p><p>Rio had never seen how vampires conducted themselves in groups, but she quickly caught on that this was the norm—half the party was thralls in some kind of undress, parading around in their underwear while Council members watched on, or, occasionally, participated.</p><p>“So, tell me,” Leonard leaned in close to them, his bright white hair gleaming under the disco light that had been haphazardly attached to the ceiling. “How did you Suggest her this well? I’ve been watching her all night, and she’s looked at nothing but you. Complete focus. It’s incredible. Richard and I could absolutely use your expertise with operating our next venture.”</p><p>Rio burned at the observation. In truth she wasn’t trying that hard. She just <em> was </em> focused on Agatha. This was enemy territory, and even though it was much less “evil overlords” and a lot more “rich people sex party” than she expected, anything could change at any given moment.</p><p>She wanted to be ready.</p><p>Agatha did not seem to share her alertness. She had fallen almost completely into character, laughing and sipping on her margarita. “I’m just good at what I do.”</p><p>“You must be. I mean, you’ve got the world’s utmost weapon at your disposal,” Leonard said, giving Rio that livestock-look again. “Is it true? That she can shatter bone with just a touch?”</p><p>“That and <em> more</em>,” Agatha said, tugging Rio into her lap. Agatha put her head on Rio’s shoulder and squeezed around her middle, lowering her voice, “Isn’t that right, baby?”</p><p>Rio’s breath shuddered in her chest. Agatha’s hands had started playing at the waistband of her suit pants. Not moving down, but just pinching at the fabric.</p><p>Rio knew this night was going to be challenging. She did not anticipate the reason why.</p><p>“I would like to make you an offer,” Leonard interjected.</p><p>Agatha looked up, her fingers stilling. Rio was grateful for the reprieve. “An offer?”</p><p>“You’re familiar with the Mass Suggestion contract you sold to us a few millennia ago, yes?” he asked. “The one that allowed us to take over those oil lines in the Middle East — that made starting up the Ashcroft’s oil empire such a breeze?”</p><p>Rio stilled. The memory hit her like a load of bricks—of being in the attic in Riegersburg, digging up that old contract in the cobwebs. Agatha had never told her what she’d done with it. Obviously this had been a deliberate omission, telling from the way Agatha’s hands tightened. </p><p>Rio blinked, the information settling over her.</p><p>
<em> Agatha’s contract was used to build the empire we were intending to steal? </em>
</p><p>“I’m familiar,” Agatha said coolly.</p><p>“Well, then you’ll also probably recall that in exchange for that contract, we very kindly didn’t bother you about any debts your family owed to The Council,” he said, slowly sipping at his drink. “Which is all good and dandy. The problem is, that contract is starting to lose steam.”</p><p>He breathed out an <em> ah, </em>tapping the counter for the bartender to refill the drink.</p><p>“I was going to contact you about writing up a new one. Your Suggestion is probably powerful enough to do it. But honestly, if you’d like to loan <em> her </em> out, that would be just fine too.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile, which had stayed in place the entire time, quivered.</p><p>“Oh, that would be just fine?” she said, voice too calm.</p><p>
<em> Oh no. </em>
</p><p>“Just fine, yes,” he repeated.</p><p>“And what exactly would you do with that loan?”</p><p>He hummed, arching back in his seat. “Oh, nothing that would damage her. There’s just a few… troublesome assets I’d like to take care of. Vampires in Asia and South America that have gotten too big for their britches. I’m sure you know the type.”</p><p>He bit down on his bottom lip, and grinned.</p><p>“And, if you’re into sharing in <em> other </em>ways, she is very pretty—”</p><p>Agatha grinned back like a serial killer as she clamped down hard around Rio’s middle.</p><p>“You don’t want to see what happens if you finish that sentence.”</p><p>His smile faltered.</p><p>“Well. It was worth a try. But the rest of my offer is still on the table.”</p><p>He brushed a speck of dust off his collar, and looked toward the rest of the party. He had obviously finished whatever business he’d come here to discuss, readying himself to leave, and Agatha noticed it. She gently prodded Rio off her lap, and stood to address him.</p><p>“...But I’m happy to consider the rest of the offer,” Agatha said, leaning against the counter. “I could even write up a new Mass Suggestion contract for you. But I’d like a favor first.”</p><p>He paused, giving her a curious, sidelong glance. “A favor?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“I want a session with Doctor Strange.”</p>

<p>
<span>“A session with… Strange? Is something </span>
<em>
<span>wrong, </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha? I’m happy to lend an ear myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Leonard’s entire demeanor changed in a split second. He was fully analyzing Agatha now, his curiosity ignited like a lighter. He was clearly desperate to find something to use as leverage against her. Rio wanted to bite that smug little face of his and chew it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That idea must have been written all over her, because Leonard’s eyes slid over to hers with a grimace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you please tell your lap dog to calm itself? It looks like it wants to eat me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. She turned to Rio and, staring at her intently, she slid her tongue slowly over her lower lip in thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’ll be good,” Agatha said, pinching Rio’s waist chastisingly. “She just doesn’t like when people try to put their nose in my business.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Leonard scoffed. “I would never—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One session, Bianchi. That’s all I want. And then you can have your Mass Suggestion contract. I think that’s a very generous trade, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Leonard went silent, sipping his drink slowly as the party roiled around him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The sun had completely set by this point in the evening, so the only illumination left in the villa were the candle-lit chandeliers and a pair of ill-matched strobe-lights, blinking like police cars.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The strobe-lights gave everything a choppy, stop motion effect; sweaty, dancing bodies appeared and disappeared, and in those split-second moments of complete, utter darkness, Rio could see Leonard’s phantoms in every corner of the villa — behind the bar, in the yard, sitting on couches. In a blink, they were utterly surrounded, and then in another, there was nothing there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio began to feel a sense of deep foreboding that gnawed at her bones. An urgency she hadn’t felt since she was mortal, like she was staring down the headlights of an oncoming train.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take a few minutes to consider it,” Agatha said, giving him one of those slimy, too-wide smiles. “I’m going to use the powder room. Thrall, come with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could process what was happening, Agatha was grabbing her by the hand and ploughing through the crowds, pushing through the orgy—sorry, quarterly business event for guests of the company—until they were spilling into an extremely decadent bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The ceilings were low, just a head taller than the both of them, so they had to duck to avoid hitting their head on the golden chandelier. The air was surprisingly cold and crisp compared to the hotbox of the living room, and Rio felt like she could take her first real breath in hours as Agatha opened the single stall door to check that nobody was in there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When it was empty, she hastily locked the door they’d just come through. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned toward her, panting slightly from the speed in which she’d tugged them both there. Rio met her gaze, taking her in through half-drunken eyes. And dear god, Agatha looked absolutely, gut-wrenchingly beautiful in her crimson red, off-the-shoulder dress, so much so that it was hard for Rio to form a sentence as Agatha approached her. No—</span>
<em>
<span>stalked</span>
</em>
<span> toward her would be a better word; she had a single-minded focus, like she was about to leap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows furrowed at her intensity. Was there a threat? Had there been something she hadn’t seen? </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</em>
<span>Had she been too busy oggling Agatha the entire time that she’d missed something obvious? It was good that they were alone now, they had a lot to discuss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agath—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clapped a hand over her mouth. “Don’t talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened in confusion, but she lost her ability to speak when Agatha suddenly pressed her to the cold tile of the wall, and shoved their lips together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss was animalistic, loud and sloppy, Agatha all but moaning into Rio’s mouth as she grabbed both sides of her face to keep her there, pinned under her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time maybe ever, Rio’s eyes remained open as they kissed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Confused was not an apt enough word to describe what was happening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she stopped caring why when Agatha’s thigh suddenly shoved between her own, hitting right up against her center, and she groaned. All the uncouth thoughts she’d had over the past hour came running back into her brain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha whined quietly into her mouth, pressing herself even closer to Rio, so their bodies were almost enmeshed. “I just couldn’t stand it for another second.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio mumbled back, “Stand wh—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand came up to cover her mouth again, and Rio was equally lost and turned on by the action. But this time, Agatha gave her an answer, pressing her lips to the shell of Rio’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One of his lackeys is outside the door, listening. If you talk, we give ourselves away,” she said quietly, then took in a sharp breath inward as she inhaled Rio’s neck. “You have no idea what you’ve been doing to me for the past two hours. How you’ve been </span>
<em>
<span>looking </span>
</em>
<span>at me. Especially after what you said on the bus, oh God. I need to – I just — is it okay if I —”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could understand what she wanted without her saying so. She nodded quickly, desperately, and Agatha sunk her teeth into her neck. It took everything in Rio not to moan embarrassingly loud when Agatha’s knees went weak at the contact; Rio slung her arm around Agatha’s back, and let her other hand slide down to the hem of Agatha’s dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” Agatha begged, canting her hips up into Rio’s hand. “God, the way those fuckers were looking at you. I was ready to—” Agatha cut herself off, probably realizing that it wasn’t a great look if she started blaspheming the Council, either. She pivoted, taking Rio’s chin in her hand for better leverage as she drank. “Doesn’t matter. You’re mine. You understand that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio whimpered in place of an answer. She felt like complete puddy in Agatha’s hands. She wasn’t sure if it was the alcohol or the roleplay she’d been forced into for the last three hours, but she felt utterly like a ragdoll. She would have done just about anything to please Agatha then.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If they think they’re </span>
<em>
<span>ever</span>
</em>
<span> getting their hands on you,” Agatha snarled in her ear, and then ran her hand down Rio’s suit top until she reached the zipper of Rio’s corduroys. “Here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to fuck you, and then we’re going to leave this bathroom, they’re going to give me everything I want, and then we’re going to go home, take a bath, and I’m going to fuck you again. How does that sound, baby? Would you like that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound that came out of Rio’s mouth in response wasn’t human. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And when Agatha released her fangs from her neck, and stared into Rio’s eyes, searching for one last piece of permission, the look on her face wasn’t human, either. Her eyes were a shade of red that Rio had never seen before. They were nearly pink, and glowing.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That must mean something, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio thought, briefly, before Agatha’s hands were down her pants, and her fingers were rubbing exactly where Rio needed it, and she did not have the brain capacity to play vampire detective.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s right,” Agatha breathed into her mouth as she kissed her again, languidly this time. “You’ve been so good for me all evening, baby. I’m just going to need you to be good for a little bit longer.” She began to pick up the pace. “Can you do that for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moaned into Agatha’s mouth, wanting to say </span>
<em>
<span>I’ll be good for you everyday of my life, </span>
</em>
<span>but that wasn’t allowed, so she settled for biting Agatha’s lip instead, hard enough that it bled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They both gasped as Rio took the lip into her mouth and began to suck on it, the blood as sweet as Kool-aid. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, fuck. Yes. Good girl,” Agatha whined into her mouth. “Drink up, and then come on my hand baby. Please. Show me you don’t belong to anyone else. Come on my fingers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The command went straight through her, and she cried into Agatha’s mouth as her hips stuttered against her hand. The orgasm was unrelenting—she had to rake her fingernails into the tile just to stay upright—as she came once, then twice, Agatha swallowing her moans into her mouth the entire time. It felt like nothing Rio had ever experienced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like something </span>
<em>
<span>different</span>
</em>
<span> was going on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>An idea that was reaffirmed for her when Agatha grazed her hand over her center once more, and she felt like she could come again. She nearly did, before Agatha drew away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They broke apart, and she could see in Agatha’s eyes—her dark pink, glowing eyes—that she sensed the difference too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit,” Agatha said, a lightning shock of panic running through her. “Shit. Shit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A knock thundered at the door. Leonard’s voice followed just after.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything alright in there, Miss Harkness?” He cleared his throat. “Come join me on the second floor once you’re… finished. I think we can arrive at a deal.”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Leonard’s footsteps echoed away from the door, and Agatha took Rio’s face in hers with an urgent, panicked certainty. Rio just narrowed her eyes back in concern. Everything felt a bit woozy, a bit floaty and slow. She chalked it up to the absolute ravaging Agatha had just inflicted on her. </p><p>She’d come…. Three times? Four? It was like she was a woman possessed.</p><p>“I think,” Agatha took a shaky breath in. “I just made you into my thrall.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio blinked at her. She was about to tell Agatha that was ridiculous, that she didn’t feel any different from before, when she realized that she <em> couldn’t. </em>Literally, physically, could not force her mouth open to tell Agatha that she was wrong. The moment she tried to, it felt like she’d been pricked by a shock collar, painful adrenaline pouring throughout her body.</p><p>And once she noticed<em> that, </em> she noticed a host of other new sensations. She noticed that her body felt heavier now, like her limbs were weighed down by invisible barbells. She noticed her thoughts had begun to phrase themselves differently. Not <em> I think Agatha looks frightened </em> but instead, <em> Agatha is frightened and I need to kill whatever’s frightening her.  </em></p><p>And the most insane and perhaps embarrassing part of it all was that if Agatha hadn’t pointed it out, Rio might not have noticed until she was taking someone’s throat out. </p><p>But in her defense, it wasn’t unusual for her to feel protective over Agatha. It also wasn’t unusual for her to feel murderous over her, either. </p><p>Tommy Ashcroft, may his spirit rest in the sweet, sweet embrace of whatever Death had in mind for white collar criminals, was evidence enough of that.</p><p>But this felt different. This felt like it was out of her control. Like Agatha’s wellbeing had become her singular responsibility, and if she failed, she’d be punished. She wasn’t sure by <em> who </em>—she knew Agatha wouldn’t do that to her— but instead by something unseen. As if betraying this impulse would cause her to implode inside, to throw up from nerves.</p><p>She fought against it again, tried to open her lips to say something inflammatory, but every time she tried, it was like being stung by a bee, and then a wasp, the severity increasing with every subsequent attempt until her ears were buzzing and she was physically wincing. Something Agatha must have noticed, because she was beginning to look wildly distressed.</p><p>“She was right,” Agatha said in a hushed, frenetic whisper. After a few, slow blinks, she withdrew from Rio, and began to pound the palm of her hand against her forehead repetitively. “Fuck. She was right. This was inevitable. I can never do anything right. You stupid, stupid—”</p><p>Rio grabbed Agatha’s wrist, freezing her hand before it hit her head again.</p><p>She wanted to stay <em> Stop hurting yourself </em> but her mind wouldn’t allow it. It sounded too much like a command. </p><p>“Who was right?” Rio settled on.</p><p>Agatha had the audacity to look confused by Rio’s question.</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Agatha replied shakily.</p><p>“You just said—” Rio’s voice trailed off. Agatha looked… disoriented? “She’s right. She’s right. You repeated it several times.”</p><p>Agatha blinked again. “I did?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said calmly, too calmly. It was like her brain was now wired like a detective from a 19th century crime novel. Her emotions were muted, ticked on and off based on Agatha’s information. Information she needed to know, badly. “Who were you talking about?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand went limp in her hold, and Rio carefully set it down by her side.</p><p>“I don’t know. I don’t remember,” Agatha said, then looked deeply into Rio’s pink pupils. The panic gripped Agatha’s expression again, and a single tear streaked down her cheek, bringing a dark line of ruined mascara down with it. Her hand trembling, she cupped Rio’s face tenderly. “Look, I can fix this. I promise. I might be a fuck up, but I’m a competent fuck up.”</p><p>The sheer panic in Agatha’s voice broke her heart. Rio wanted to say <em> It’s fine, I can stay like this forever. </em> She wouldn’t mind. She didn’t need her free will anyway. </p><p>Hm.</p><p>
<em> That’s a bit too far, brain. </em>
</p><p>When she finally got the opportunity to tell Agatha she loved her, she wanted to mean it.</p><p>Her thoughts and emotions were slowly cloying towards something that didn’t belong to her—a devotion that was impersonal, not to Agatha, but to the Suggestion itself.</p><p>Agatha withdrew her hand, and Rio immediately missed the warm pressure of it. “Screw Strange. Fuck it all. I’ll get us home, and we can unwind you again there. I don’t want anyone here messing with you. I — I can just use the blindfold until—”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio forced out. It felt like she was being attacked by a wild bear when she said it, gritting her teeth in pain, but she needed the other woman to hear this. “No.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. Rio breathed in, then out, slowly.</p><p>“No,” she repeated, at great expense. She said it so quietly that she hoped the phantoms couldn’t hear. “Talk to Strange. I’ll survive a few hours like this.” She then couldn’t help the dark chuckle that came out of her mouth — “This really isn’t so unusual for me, anyway.”</p><p>She meant that, as in, <em> I am desperately in love with you, and I’d do anything for you without you having to cast a single spell, </em> but Agatha clearly took it as <em> You’ve been making me your thrall for five hundred years already, what’s a little more.  </em></p><p>Rio could infer it by the way Agatha’s eyes darkened, the way her arms fell limp to her sides. Rio desperately wanted to correct herself, to make Agatha feel better, but the thrall hex was too great, too immobilizing, like trying to push against a mountain to make it move an inch.</p><p>Thankfully, Agatha capitulated. “Okay,” she said. “Come with me.”</p><p>Agatha took her hand, and gently kicked open the door to the main room. The music had quieted significantly, mellowing from ear-bleeding Electronica down to something jazzy and lofi.</p><p>The disco ball had been cut down and stuffed in a closet, its glimmering head still sticking out from the cupboard a little bit, like a child who’d been put to bed too early.</p><p>The crowds had thinned, too, so now it was only a handful of cross-faded vampires talking in hushed, gossipy whispers.</p><p>Gossip that focused immediately on the two of them as they began to trail to the staircase. Rio noticed, like a tourist to her own mind, how she’d started to evaluate every single person as Threat or Not Threat. She felt like the computer she’d learned to use for work.</p><p>It would all be very disturbing if she was able to process any of it. Thankfully, she couldn’t. The thing about becoming a thrall, Rio was slowly realizing, was that it felt a lot like being heavily medicated during a big surgery — like, it’s still traumatizing to watch a man in a white coat saw your foot off, but if you’re floating around on horse tranquilizer, it’s sort of like, whatever, man.</p><p>So instead of thinking, she kept her eyes pinned to her north star.</p><p>A star which, to Rio’s great irritation, was trying to escape her purview.</p><p>“I want you to stay here until I’m done,” Agatha said, her hand gripping tightly to the railing as she looked up at the upper floor. “I… I think I need to go there alone.” </p><p>Rio gripped the railing so tight that it shattered underneath. </p><p>Agatha put her hand on Rio’s arm, squeezing it tenderly.</p><p>“<em>Chill, </em>chill. I’ll be fine. Just stay here. If I’m not back in thirty minutes, or you hear me, like, <em> screaming </em> or something, then come look for me.” She glanced around suspiciously, then added with a muttering joke, “And if anyone tries to touch you, kill them.”</p><p>Rio would normally have laughed at that. But the now hyperliteral side of her thrall brain took it with a quick nod, and she knew, almost immediately, that this wasn’t going to end well.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t lose her shit often. In fact, she could count on one hand the number of times it had happened. Almost all of them included Rio nearly dying, which was a true feat, given that she was practically indestructible.</p><p>The other two or three incidents were all related to Amazon packages being delivered to the wrong address.</p><p>And the final one was right now.</p><p>Losing her shit was maybe putting it politely. Because she had just enthralled the single person she cared about, after she was finally, <em> finally </em> coming close to being able to admit something to Rio that was real, and vulnerable, and all the things she was so viscerally, hereditarily allergic to, and she just had to fuck it up. It was cosmically necessary, in fact, that she fucked it up. </p><p>Because that’s just what Agatha Harkness did. </p><p>She tortured precious things to death.</p><p>So, no longer caring about any pretense, she barreled through the hallways of Vampire Orgy Manor, pushing kissing couples apart so fast a few of them went catapulting down the stairs, slamming her hand through various doors to jiggle the lock on the other side, until she finally found Leonard snorting cocaine off a thrall’s belly button.</p><p>“Whatever you want, I’ll do it,” she gritted out, kicking out the chair the thrall was sitting on from beneath him so he flopped unceremoniously to the ground. “Tell me where Strange is.”</p><p>Leonard rubbed the powder off his nose, and huffed.</p><p>“No need to be in a rush, Agatha.”</p><p>“What do you want? One Mass Suggestion Contract? Two? I’ll write as many as my body lets me.” She surged forward, feeling manic and probably too brash as she took him by the chin. “Just tell me where Doctor Strange is.”</p><p>Leonard held her gaze for a moment, and Agatha saw in the reflection of his stormy pupils four phantoms, yellow-eyed and murderous, lingering at the doorstep.</p><p>“Careful,” he whispered.</p><p>Feeling a chill run down her spine, she reluctantly let him go.</p><p>“Two contracts, and your thrall will take care of some things for us. Just a few tasks, in the southern hemisphere. We’ll rent her for, oh, say, a decade or two. Nothing big.”</p><p>Agatha felt newly invigorated to kill him. Ferally, she hissed, “No fucking <em> deal. </em>”</p><p>He groaned, leaning back into the satin couch he was spread against. “Agree to the terms, Agatha, or <em>Rio Vidal</em> won’t leave here alive anyway.”</p><p>Agatha froze, her blood going cold. He rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Oh, please. You’re a negotiator at heart, Agatha. You must understand that this is just good business. She’s far too great a threat for us not to neutralize her while we have the chance. So either you lend her to us, or we deal with her now, after your session with Strange.”</p><p>“You’re bluffing,” Agatha said coldly. </p><p>He hummed, then lit a cigar. “I don’t bluff.”</p><p>Agatha’s mind reeled. It calculated a hundred different plays in a matter of seconds, rehearsed them all in her head from top to bottom.</p><p>Most of them included her tearing his head off his body and playing tennis with it. Most of them ended with both her and Rio dead on the floor in a pile of tragic, Shakespearean carnage, Rio “Romeo” Vidal and Agatha “Couldn’t Get Her Shit Together In Five Hundred Years, Even With Every Chance To Do So” Harkness.</p><p>In the end, only one plan made sense to her. It wasn’t surefire, but nothing was. </p><p>She selected it with her mental cursor, and let the consequences reverberate through the timeline as they may.</p><p>“Fine,” she said, taking the cigar out of his mouth. “I agree to your terms.”</p><p>He smiled, fangs shining under the lamplight.</p><p>“Atta girl,” he laughed. “He’s in the penthouse.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>It only took fifteen minutes for Agatha’s command to kick in.</p><p>Rio was standing by the bar when it happened, stock-still, listening out for the sound of Agatha’s voice. She had zoned in on it somewhere at the top of the manor, on the highest floor, murmuring something. It filled her chest with relief. As long as Agatha was talking, she was alive.</p><p>Strangely, being a thrall made her even more attuned to Agatha’s vitals than she’d been before. She knew that when humans were enthralled, they very frequently became vampires, but she’d never thought about what a vampire thrall might get out of the equation—it was so unusual to think of enthrallment as positive in any way, the potential pros were so rarely discussed.</p><p>But there appeared to be a few.</p><p>For one, all her senses were dramatically heightened. She could hear <em> everything, </em> every word out of every mouth, all circling the drain of her brain stem.</p><p>And yet, at the same time, her thoughts were less muddled. She could organize them and catalogue them— <em> Threat, not Threat— </em>and then snap them away. </p><p>It was a very clear, single minded existence.</p><p>It was also seriously boring.</p><p>She leaned on the bar and sighed, peering around the room. </p><p>The couch in front of her was squeaking as two vampires were making out <em> loudly </em> in front of her face, one of them pausing briefly to handcuff the other. She grimaced as they struggled with the constraints, unable to click them together correctly, before ultimately throwing them aside. </p><p>
<em> Jesus Christ. </em>
</p><p>The whole room just oozed amateur, low-grade porn. The kind you bought for two dollars at the back of a video store then turned off after about fifteen seconds of disgustingly bad acting.</p><p>Which is why, all things considered, she wasn’t even that mad when one of Leonard’s goons strolled up to her, pinched her cheek, then said to his buddy next to him, “Leonard just told me we’re renting her out for the next two years. How about it, a night with Lady Death herself?”</p><p>Rio blinked, and Agatha’s words flashed in her head.</p><p>
<em> If anyone tries to touch you, kill them. </em>
</p><p>Rio inhaled. Agatha always knew the right thing to say.</p><p>“Hi there,” she said, extending her hand. They both took a step back in shock, to which she smiled warmly, her eyes bulging just a bit. “What? Didn’t you want to get to know me?”</p><p>The man began to stutter, looking back and forth between him and his friend. The entire room had seemed to take notice, too — all the chatter abruptly screeching to a halt, like a broken vinyl record. Even the couple on the couch broke apart to stare. </p><p>“Leonard told me she couldn’t talk,” he muttered, speaking to the crowd.</p><p>“That’s fair. I’m not much of a conversationalist.”</p><p>She took a step forward, and cackled when he shuddered backwards, collapsing onto the floor by accident. She could feel Agatha’s command pulsing at the back of her skull, demanding her to work faster, but she pushed against it — as much as she would love to start popping bones from sockets, killing just about anyone would jeopardize Agatha’s session.</p><p>So she fought against the instinct with as much force as she could manage, her whole body feeling like a ticking time bomb. If she just focused on her breathing—</p><p>The stairs creaked. Rio’s ears perked, her gaze quickly sliding across the room to meet Leonard’s. The man stopped at the foot of the stairwell, then proceeded to pound the hardwood floors with the bottom of a long, black cane.</p><p>He’d been carrying the cane around for the duration of the party, and at first Rio had thought it was purely decorative — but now, with her enhanced senses, she could see a faint glow around it. It was an enchanted item.</p><p>Something that could kill.</p><p>“I wouldn’t worry, Robert,” Leonard said, walking slowly over to the man who had collapsed on the floor, and helping him up with a lowered hand. “Once Strange puts that misguided Harkness daughter out of her mournful misery, Lady Death will be ours for much longer than two years. Something more like an eternity. That’s more than enough time for us to fully tamp down her personality, don’t you think?”</p><p>As Leonard’s meaning crystallized in her mind, Rio’s entire world stopped spinning. Like a polaroid dipped abruptly in a bucket full of blood, everything turned suddenly red; the ceiling, the table, the chairs, the windows, the vampires’ pudgy, age-less faces, the dark night sky, the moon. </p><p>She felt a rage inside her unlike anything she’d experienced before. It wasn’t some kind of flash of fury, like a gun going off. No, it didn’t <em> flash </em>at all. She was just dunked in it, like falling  into the ocean in the dead of winter. For a moment it was frigid and cold and everything felt terrible, like the world just might end, but a second later, everything became obvious.</p><p>They were planning on killing Agatha. And for the crime of even entertaining that thought, every single one of them was about to meet whatever afterlife existed for monsters.</p><p>“What did you just say?” she asked calmly.</p><p>Leonard chuckled. Lightning cracked in the window behind him, and in that brief flash of  light, Rio could see a hundred yellow eyes watching her.</p><p>“Nothing that concerns you,” he said, smiling placidly as he took her chin in his hand again. “Agatha told me how you work. Without her go ahead, you can’t do anything. And she told you to stay right here, with us. Not to move an inch for the next thirty minutes. Lucky for us, that’s plenty of time for Strange to do his best work. So why don’t you just sit quietly and—”</p><p>Rio gently took the hand which was holding his cane, and tapped it gently. He trailed off, confused by the action.</p><p>“Hit me with this,” she said, matter-of-fact.</p><p>He let out a surprised bark of laughter.</p><p>“<em> Hit </em> you…? I know thralls are masochistic, but I’ve never seen one so transparent—”</p><p>“I won’t retaliate. I promise. Just hit me with it. Aren’t you curious how much I can take?”</p><p>He paused. Then smiled.</p><p>“I can sniff a loophole from a mile away, Ms. Vidal,” he said, licking his lips. She could tell he was considering it. “You want to trigger some sort of self-defence mechanism in yourself. Quite wise for a thrall, but I won’t give into it. I’m not stupid.”</p><p>“I just thought it would sate your curiosity,” She shrugged. “It’s fine if you don’t want to.”</p><p>She turned away from him, toward the bar, and took a swig from a shot glass. Vodka burned down her throat, and in her head, she began counting down from ten. Ten seconds until they all died. Nine seconds until they all died. Eight seconds.</p><p>At six seconds, she felt the equivalent of an earthquake land on her spine.</p><p>All her vertebrae shattered in one go. Impressive. It even made her cough a little, seizing into the table. She gripped the sticky surface, and took a breath in.</p><p>“Are you sure you didn’t kill her, boss?”</p><p>Four seconds.</p><p>“No. I can still hear her heartbeat.”</p><p>Three seconds.</p><p>Rio could feel the shockwave working its way through her. Rio swallowed the force like a black hole, pulled it into herself and held it there, simmering.</p><p>That was the trick of her entire thing, after all. While those who didn’t know her called her Death, Agatha affectionately—and stupidly—referred to her power as <em> the handbag. </em></p><p>It was annoyingly correct. And also a little bit of an undersell.</p><p>Rio could hold every ounce of violence ever thrown her way inside of her, and carry it like a dumbbell. And just like a dumbbell, it hurt a<em> lot </em> when you threw it at someone’s face.</p><p>She straightened her back, vertebrae snapping into place like a zipper, and slowly turned around. Leonard's face shifted from idle curiosity to open alarm as she smiled at him and gently wrapped her hand around his forehead.</p><p>“<em>Boom,”</em> she whispered.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was sitting crisscross on the floor of Doctor Strange’s studio, inhaling incense and preparing to have her mind dug through like an excavation site, when she heard the equivalent of a bomb go off downstairs. The entire building shook underneath her.</p><p>“What was that?” she mumbled, sitting somewhere between panic and confusion. He had already started the process, and had given her a drink that served pretty much like a sedative. </p><p>Strange squeezed her shoulder.</p><p>“Nothing to worry about, darling,” he said, eyes glowing red. “I’m sure it’s just Leonard dealing with a cockroach."</p>

<p>Arthur Van Der Mill was having a great day, then a very bad one. </p><p>He’d been saving up for fourteen consecutive summers to be able to afford a ticket to the The Council’s Annual Ball. He’d been in the market for a new thrall for a while—someone young, and sprightly, not the old Nandos waitress he’d been stuck with half a century—and the pamphlet for the event <em>had</em> said, “let your fangs hang with a selection of beautiful goddesses.”</p><p>Which had all been true. He’d arrived early, gotten gangbusters drunk, and made out with at least seventeen different gorgeous women by the time his friend—some three-hundred year old <em>idiot</em> from Toronto—convinced him to leave the upstairs lounge behind and watch Leonard mess with Little Lady Death.</p><p>It was true that he’d been watching her all night. He’d seen her and Agatha Harkness enter, arm and arm, through the villa’s double-doors, and it was like the entire room took one shuddering inhale.</p><p>No one in the entire history of modern vampirism commanded more mystique than those two, ever since the Harkness Massacre. </p><p>And there was a good reason for that. A deep psychological reason that very few of them ever deigned to discuss.</p><p>Because the thing is, when you take a species like the vampire, who on the whole are a more powerful collection of people than every other creature on Earth combined, a certain kind of… natural ego develops. </p><p>A complacency at the top of the food chain.</p><p>So when news travels that the most vicious, powerful, <em>untouchable</em> vampires among them, people like the Harkness Clan, are reduced to a pile of corpses all in one evening, it does something to that collective ego. </p><p>It traumatizes it. It says <em>you’re not in charge anymore.</em></p><p>And when a community is traumatized like that, unable to make heads or tails of something so unbelievable, rumors naturally sprout like hydra heads. </p><p>Especially when no one had ever <em>seen</em> Rio Vidal before, not in person. The prevailing theory was that Agatha had made her up in order to scare off possible retaliators.</p><p>That, in fact, Agatha had gotten away with a much more mundane sort of murder—like poisoned blood—and made up an elaborate story in order to raise her reputation. </p><p>But, out of nowhere, without a whisper or an invitation, here she was. Strolling in like she owned the place. Apathetic and infuriatingly quiet.</p><p>Arthur could admit it made sense that The Council had no other choice but to assert dominance. Vampires would have laughed at Leonard for years if he hadn’t done something to put the two of them in their rightful place—to make them pay for the crime of not kissing the royal pale foot.</p><p>So Arthur watched, sipping a margarita, as Leonard bashed his cane onto Rio’s back.</p><p>The resounding crack that followed convinced everyone she was dead where she was standing, that it was only a matter of time before she crumpled onto her knees. But she didn’t.</p><p>She coughed a bit, like she’d swallowed spit the wrong way down, then turned around, walked up to Leonard, and patted his forehead with her fingers.</p><p>Then she said something like ‘Boom’ or ‘Shoom’ or ‘Bloom,’ Arthur had no idea, it could have been anything, it really didn’t matter, because suddenly Leonard, King of the Vampires, was standing in his tuxedo, straight as a rod, with no head.</p><p>Arthur blinked once, twice. Unable to process it. How could he? Rio had pressed only the pads of her fingertips to Leonard’s sweaty forehead, and a moment later, his skull, and naturally his brain, had exploded like shrapnel. </p><p>Some spongy tissue even arrived shortly in Arthur’s margarita, just floating around like it belonged in a soup.</p><p><em>Oh, </em>he thought, feeling the strange, eerie sort of satisfaction that comes with meeting a god, even one that might just annihilate you next. <em>She’s real.</em></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“Just relax, Agatha. I can’t open your brain if you don’t relax.”</p><p>“I <em>am </em>relaxed.”</p><p>“You’re remarkably tense, actually. Which is truly, terrifyingly impressive, given I’ve drugged you with the maximum dose of my sedative.”</p><p>“Sounds like it’s a shit sedative, then.”</p><p>Strange sighed.</p><p>“Four drops of it can put a rhinoceros to sleep in five seconds. I’ve given you twenty-two drops.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, shifting her weight around on the yoga mat. The truth was, she was high out of her absolute mind in that moment—she was seeing shapes and colors float around behind her eyelids, was hallucinating screams and shouts and all myriad of horrifying sounds—but that wasn’t too different from the normal state of her brain.</p><p>“I’m much more formidable than a big gray cow,” she slurred, laying her head down, and feeling the floor rumble. “God, what are they <em>doing</em> down there?”</p><p>She frowned, reality suddenly breaking through the fuzz like a knife to the gut.</p><p>“Rio,” she breathed, lifting herself into a sitting position. An immediate bad idea—the world spun, the cabinets in the dusty attic turning into one long brown streak across her vision. She groaned, rubbing her eyes and trying to stand regardless. “Have to check on her. Make sure she’s okay. If one of those idiots is messing with her, I’ll make him eat his own—”</p><p>Tugging her sleeve, Strange pulled her back down onto the mat. Agatha folded over with an embarrassing quickness, and she scowled at him, ready to bite.</p><p>He raised a hand to placate her. “She’s <em>fine,</em> Agatha.”</p><p>“You don’t know that,” she slurred. He had grown three heads now. Like Cerberus. “Let me go check on her. Will be right back. You stay here. I’ve paid for ninety minutes.”</p><p>She tried to get on her knees again, and this time Strange didn’t try to stop her. Not physically. He just sat there, cross-legged and stoic, and asked her a question instead.</p><p>“Can you tell me the exact moment in time that you decided you were unlovable?”</p><p>Agatha froze, her lungs tightening like a snapped balloon. For a second she thought she couldn’t breathe, but then she realized what she was feeling was something else entirely.</p><p>An intrusion.</p><p>He was inside of her brain. </p><p>She was so used to experiencing Suggestion the other way around—vacationing in the subconscious of other people, dragging her lawn chair in and sunbathing in their stupid little memories—that to be under the knife herself was a completely foreign procedure. It felt like she’d walked into her kitchen and found a stranger re-organizing her spice cabinet.</p><p>Her knees wobbling with a mixture of fury and dizziness, she lowered herself back onto the mat, and, with a truly formidable amount of reluctance, turned to face him. </p><p>“You’ve been in my brain for three seconds,” she said coldly. “I don’t think you can make deductions like that so definitively.”</p><p>“I’m good at what I do.”</p><p>“No, <em>I’m</em> good at what <em>you</em> do. So, expert-to-expert, you don’t know shit.”</p><p>“For the sake of our time I’d like you try and not lie to yourself as much as possible.”</p><p>He said it so casually, without any judgement at all, that it made Agatha want to hit him over the head with a pan, like in a cartoon.</p><p>She gritted her teeth. </p><p>
<em>Cálmate.</em>
</p><p>Sucking in a long breath, she licked her lips, then gave him an award-winning smile.</p><p>“Look, motherfucker.” </p><p>“I’m not here to talk about my—how would you unbearable therapist types phrase it—<em>my limiting self-perceptions?</em> I’m quite familiar with those, having lived in my claustrophobic hell-box of a mind for one thousand years.</p><p>“I’m aware of the fact that I think I’m a piece of shit. I am! I’m a <em>bad person. </em>Big news. Alert Anderson Cooper. Oh, wait, what? <em>All</em> of us bloodsuckers are terrible people? Hm. How surprising that would be if I was a dumbass. But I’m not. I’m someone with eyes and ears, and I have been ever since I was a child. The evidence is right in front of us. Have you seen this party? It’s like a pimp house on steroids. So no. That’s not what I’m here to unpack.</p><p><em> “</em>I’m here to talk about the fact that I can’t control my suggestions. And that’s not an <em>emotional</em> problem. It’s a wiring issue. Like, there are circuits in my brain that are firing without my consent, and, like an itch in the middle of your trapezius muscles, I can’t scratch it on my own. So I just need you to shut up, do your job, and unplug whatever cords are crossed in there.”</p><p>Agatha finished her tirade with a click of her tongue, crossing her arms in satisfaction. The room was beyond spinning at this point—and the hallucinated screams she was hearing from downstairs had reached levels that would burst the eardrum on even a bloodhound—but the words flowed out of her regardless, like bile.</p><p>His stupidly kind blue eyes and grossly well-cropped goatee studied her for a second, and Agatha foolishly thought that meant that he was listening to her. </p><p>“Thank you,” he said instead, and gave her a small smile. “That popped things right open.”</p><p>Before she could ask what the hell that meant, he was pressing a hand to her forehead, and she was tumbling backwards into the interior of her own mind.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned. “Why the<em> fuck</em> are we in Riegersburg?”</p><p>It was a strange sensation, being yanked down the road of your own memory. Usually she was the one shepherding the way, picking the right moments to showcase, which ones to stuff in closets. But now she had access to none of the controls. She just blinked open her eyes, and was suddenly staring into an empty corridor in the castle she’d grown up in.</p><p>Strange’s hand clapped over her mouth. “Quiet,” he whispered. “Watch.”</p><p>She chomped down on his palm, but her teeth vanished straight through it, like a bite from a phantom. And a phantom was exactly what she was, she realized, when she saw a small girl, no older than six, run down the corridor, little leather shoes pockmarking the grand red carpet. The little girl was holding a doll, and giggling to herself.</p><p><em>That’s me, </em>Agatha realized with an eerie sense of deja vu. Because she didn’t remember this day. Or that doll. Or even the outfit she was wearing. And she had only owned so many clothes when she was younger—the only outfits she had plenty of were ballgowns.</p><p>“You did a really good job, Elisabeth,” her younger self said reverently, petting the doll’s raven hair. “You did such a good job hiding in the chest with me like we practiced. You didn’t breathe too loud. You were as quiet as a little mouse.” She sank down onto the carpet, and began to dance the doll along it. “Even with all the dust.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach clenched.</p><p>She didn’t remember this, but she did remember the chest. The one all the way in the back of the attic. She’d hide in there when she’d done something bad, and her mother was looking for her. It was never a foolproof solution—punishment always found her eventually—but it gave her a feeling of control, to be able to delay it.</p><p>As for the choice of name, Elisabeth had been their maid. The wife of their doorman, Nicholas. Like him, she was a thrall, but an even less obedient one. She fought Evanora’s commands in secret, interpreted them in ways that only benefited Agatha. Delivered milk and cookies to Agatha’s room in the night. Took her to town when Evanora was away.</p><p>She’d died early in Agatha’s life. Agatha could never remember why. Or when.</p><p>“I don’t see why this is important,” Agatha muttered against Strange’s hand. “Yes, my mother was terrible. That’s been historically established. But I’m over it. She’s <em>dead.</em>”</p><p>At the very same moment, a small light shone from the doorway at the end of the corridor, and quiet footsteps echoed through the hallway. Young Agatha was too consumed in her play to notice at first, singing softly to herself as she paraded Elisabeth the doll back and forth on the carpet.</p><p>But Agatha, real Agatha, in all her hundreds of years of <em>being over it,</em> still felt the dread and the fear so powerfully that it almost dropped her to her knees. Her body acted without her input—her lungs constricted; her breaths came short and scattered in her chest; she began to scratch at the wall, shake her head furiously back and forth. </p><p>“No. No fucking way. I don’t want to see her again. I’m <em>not</em> seeing her again.”</p><p>“It’s only a memory, Agatha. It can’t hurt you,” Strange said. “It’s part of the process.”</p><p>“Fuck your process,” Agatha snarled at him.</p><p>She stepped over her oblivious child self and ran toward the other end of the hallway. The door there was closed, and she yanked it hard, but it refused to open.</p><p>“Open, you stupid, useless piece of bark! Let me out!”</p><p>She propped her heel on it and pulled with her whole bodyweight, screaming and shouting. When nothing worked, she punched a hole straight through the wood, relief momentarily filling her chest when her fist emerged on the other side—before she saw what was awaiting her.</p><p>Nothingness. Void.</p><p>She blinked. Her lungs tightened.</p><p>“<em>No,</em>” she said hoarsely.</p><p>She was trapped.</p><p>Strange’s voice echoed from behind her.</p><p>“It’s okay, Agatha,” he said calmly. “All you have to do is witness it, and then you can be free of it.”</p><p>Agatha blinked again. Everything took on a hazy, de-personalized feeling as the weight of her reality crushed her. She wasn’t leaving. There were no exits.</p><p>She turned just in time to see her mother lording over the child’s back. And there was a moment, a naive, crushing moment, where Agatha thought she could save herself. But even in her own mind she was powerless. Powerless to watch Evanora yank that child by the hair, throw her at the wall, then take the doll into her hand, and begin using it like a puppet.</p><p>“Oh, so you think Elisabeth is your real mother, is that right?” Evanora hissed, waving the doll around, dropping into a cruel, mocking tone. “I love you, Agatha. You’re my real daughter, Agatha. A lowly human peasant just like me. That’s what you want to hear, is it?”</p><p>Evanora slapped her so hard that the wall shook, and Agatha could feel the phantom pain on her own cheek.</p><p>“Here’s a very simple lesson. Greedy children don’t get told those kind of things. You can’t avoid all your responsibilities to the court, untie the laces on Count Wilhem’s boots, break free Lady Gladimir’s thralls, fraternize with the visiting human children as if they’re your friends, and seriously expect <em>love</em> in exchange. Love is not earned by disobedience.”</p><p>Younger Agatha shook her bruised head over and over, tears streaking down red, too-young cheeks.</p><p>Watching with enough fury in her chest to kill an army, Agatha clenched her jaw. “Don’t say sorry. Don’t you fucking say sorry to her.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, mother,” the child whimpered. Agatha flinched. “Can I have my doll back?”</p><p>Evanora’s sickly sweet smile twitched. </p><p>“Of course you can, dear.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands turned to fists; she clawed into her own palms so hard they bled. “Don’t listen to her,” she whispered at herself. “Don’t. She’s lying. She’s—”</p><p>Then, abruptly, like a slow motion sequence in a movie, the framerate in her memory dropped to a snail’s pace. Evanora’s hands lowered slowly, centimeter by centimeter; and Agatha—older now, but, she realized, no more <em>over it</em> than she was nine hundred years ago—began to remember, with a hollow emptiness in her chest, exactly what happened next. </p><p>It was something she’d been repressing for a very long time. Something she didn’t even realize was there. Like a nail sewn into the sole of a shoe.</p><p>“Hi, Agatha,” the doll said, a far-away voice emerging from its tiny wooden chest.</p><p>Younger Agatha startled, jumping slightly at the surprise, before looking to her mother—naively, innocently—to explain what she couldn’t understand.</p><p>“Did the doll just speak?” she asked quietly.</p><p>Her mother nodded. “I put a little spell on it,” she said, touching the back of the doll’s hair. Faint red magic emanated from her fingertips. “It can talk now. It can say whatever you want it to say. So go on. Give it some lines, my dear. You’re a good little actress. Make it say whatever you want it to. All you have to do is use your Suggestion.”</p><p>Younger Agatha’s eyebrows screwed together. </p><p>Even at her young age, she was a skeptic. But she was also a child. And children, vampires or otherwise, always want to believe their mothers know best.</p><p>So she turned her glassy red eyes toward the doll.</p><p>“Hi, Elisabeth.”</p><p>The doll parroted back,“Hi, Elisabeth.”</p><p>Young Agatha’s ears turned red in delight.</p><p>“Come on,” Evanora sing-songed, “You can do better than that. This doll is your thrall now, Agatha. Did you know that thralls are the only thing in existence that can love us unconditionally?”</p><p>Young Agatha frowned, confused.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes. Really,” Evanora said, squatting down so she was eye-level with her child. “As long as you let someone have their agency, they can always leave you, betray you, distrust you. Once you take that away, they’ll do anything for you. Every whim, every desire. There is no love purer than complete obedience. That is why I love my thralls very much. I love them dearly.”</p><p>Evanora pinched the doll’s head. </p><p>“So I’ve given you the perfect tool for practice.”</p><p>“Practice what?”</p><p>“Control. You want this doll to love you, don’t you? Then make sure it does.”</p><p>Processing what she’d learned, the child’s eyes slowly traveled from Evanora to the doll.</p><p>“Go on,” Evanora said, “Be a good girl. Tell her what to say.”</p><p>Preening under her mother’s praise, Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Elisabeth,” she addressed the doll, blushing as she whispered, “Say… I love you, Agatha. Please.”</p><p>The air went cold for a moment, the doll silent, before Evanora tapped the back of its head again, and the doll’s blue, glassy eyes turned abruptly red—and swirled.</p><p>“I love you, Agatha,” the doll said. “Only a thrall ever could.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Young Agatha sat there for many minutes after, stock-still, eyes swirling, the Suggestion digesting into her system, perpetuating itself like a virus, bleeding into every cell. Evanora hummed to herself, snapped the doll in two, and left her in the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, nine hundred years later in a villa in Iceland, found herself rocking back and forth on the floor, unable to think, to move, to cry. </p><p>The pain was too acute, like someone had slowly driven an icicle straight into her heart. </p><p>
<em>Only a thrall ever could. Only a thrall ever could. Only a thrall ever could.</em>
</p><p>All she was aware of was that she was still alive, her knees hugged to her chest. It was the only thing she <em>could </em>do—the only coping mechanism she’d had since she was small.</p><p>Vaguely, she was aware of Doctor Strange getting up off the floor, and brushing off his robes. He was holding a piece of parchment and a quill, and etching symbols into the paper.</p><p>“I must admit, Ms. Harkness, your mind is a fascinatingly depressing place to be. I thought my mother was harsh, but at the very least she didn’t have the vampiric skill of Puppetry. Being able to direct Suggestions through the body of another…. A frightening skill. No wonder she was able to develop the Mass Suggestion method,” he said, his eyes never once leaving the page. “Anywho. I do thank you for letting me intrude for a bit. I hope it was as helpful to you as it was to me.”</p><p>He turned the page, and Agatha, even through her haze, understood what he was writing. It was a Mass Suggestion contract. The kind that only her mother—and her—possessed the ability to write. A Harkness family blood-heirloom. Now apparently passed on, unwittingly, to the man that was headed for the doorway.</p><p>He seemed as if he was about to open it, before his hand stilled on the doorknob. </p><p>He frowned, looking at the door frame as if he could see through it, sensing something on the other side. </p><p>The staircase in the hallway had begun to rattle, the chandelier above them shaking. Someone—something—had breached the second floor. Footsteps landed like shocks of thunder, pound, pound, pound, before all the commotion abruptly stopped—silence hung in the air for a moment—and then, quiet as a mouse, there was a gentle knocking at the door.</p><p>Eyebrows furrowed, Strange began to open the door.</p><p>“Leonard?” he said. “I just finished up. But you really didn’t make this session very easy, with all that commotion downstairs.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath fell out of her when she saw not Leonard, but <em>Rio</em> walk in the door.</p><p>Rio, covered in blood from head to toe, hair matted and wet with sweat like she was fresh from a shower, someone else’s organs dragging around her ankles. Rio, whose once-beautiful dress suit was torn clean in half, so she was reduced to just a black bra, ripped pants, and bare feet; Rio, who was holding a sparkling, black cane that Agatha didn’t recognize.</p><p>Strange went silent—just stared at her, frowning, his face completely unreadable.</p><p>“I see,” he said. “Well then—”</p><p>Rio took once glance at him, then one glance at Agatha, her knees pressed to her chest, her cheeks red with tears, her mouth unspeakably quiet, and made a very easy decision. </p><p>She dropped the cane onto the floor, yanked Strange up by the collar, walked him to the window, and smashed his head right through it. </p><p>Then she grabbed the handcuffs she’d borrowed from the couple downstairs, looped one around her own wrist, another around Agatha’s, clicked them, and stared into her eyes in a way that cut through the noise—and made everything come into sharp focus.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, touching her wet, bloody hand to Agatha’s cheek. “What happened?”</p><p>And somehow, of all the things Agatha’s mind could have pinpointed to focus on, she focused on the handcuffs—the cold silver, now linking them together.</p><p>“Why… these?” she said, shaking them slightly. </p><p>Rio bit her lip, almost shyly.</p><p>“I just killed every last man in this building,” she mumbled, like it was embarrassing on the same level as slipping on ice in the winter. “And I’m afraid if I’m not literally linked to your person, I might kill whatever poor uber driver picks us up in twenty minutes.”</p><p>Before Agatha could open her mouth, Rio was extracting a cellphone from her pocket. One that definitely didn’t belong to her, and was as soaked in blood as everything else. On the screen, it blearily stated: “Uber for Leonard Bianchi, expected in 19 minutes.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth fell open.</p><p>For a moment, just looking at Rio’s face, and digesting the fact that she’d completely annihilated—without a thought—the most powerful men on earth, just to protect her, Agatha felt so much love in her chest that she almost didn’t feel the ache anymore.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Because Rio was still a thrall. And Agatha had made her one.</p><p>Because deep down, she knew now, she’d believed her mother.</p><p>Agatha’s throat swelled up, and she took in a shuddering breath as Rio’s hands absentmindedly rubbed her shoulders, her arms. Rio’s perfect brown eyes studied her face like it was the most important canvas on Earth. With complete, undivided devotion.  </p><p>And Agatha was about to fall into that pit again, that terrible pit, because her mother was right—no one loved like a thrall loved, no one would love her except someone she commanded into doing it—until she remembered all the times Rio had looked at her like this. </p><p>And… Oh.</p><p>Six hundred years, and Rio had been staring at her like this the entire time, hadn’t she?</p><p>Goosebumps zipped up and down Agatha’s arms. Rio was currently a servant to the most deadly psychological spell a vampire could endure, and yet she was looking at Agatha <em>exactly</em> the same way as she had the entire time they’d known each other. She talked to her the same, touched her the same, with the same care, and attention, and— oh god—</p><p>Agatha was an idiot.</p><p>“Ten minutes now,” Rio said, looking down at the phone. “You’re going to have to give me a command to get us down to the car, by the way. My mind is pretty much stuck on a murder loop right now. It’s like <em>kilkillkill </em>over and over like a broken tape recorder, even though there is <em>literally</em> no one left to kill. I don’t think the whole Thrall thing gels well with my OCD. Or maybe it gels <em>too </em>well. Kind of unclear. I should take my medication once we’re back at the hotel. Shit, did I even bring it? Wait, Agatha? What’s wrong?”</p><p>Agatha pulled Rio by the handcuffs, laid her hand on her cheek, and brought her into the most desperate, honest kiss she’d ever given anyone.</p><p>She nearly died when Rio whimpered into it. She nearly confessed everything when Rio’s hands trembled where they were cupped around her shoulders.</p><p>But she wasn’t going to tell a thrall that she loved her.</p><p>She was going to tell Rio that.</p><p>She could taste her own messy, happy, grief-ridden tears when she whispered against Rio’s lips, “Here’s your command. Get me to the car. Then get me to the hotel. Then get me in the bathtub. In that order, and quickly. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha regretted the ‘and quickly’ when Rio nearly broke both their arms off.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The uber driver pulled up to the villa, grunting quietly when he heard the music blaring from inside the yard—<em>Bodies </em>by <em>Drowning Pool, </em>stuck on an endless loop, only bookmarked occasionally by a Spotify ad—playing much too loudly for 3 o’clock in the morning.</p><p>“Rich tourists,” he muttered as the car doors swung open, and his clientele slumped in.</p><p>He adjusted his rearview mirror just in time to catch two women—one, covered every inch in blood, and the other, a little dazed, clinging to her side with a smirk on her face.</p><p>“Is that blood?” he said.</p><p>The woman laughed. “Halloween party.”</p><p>“Isn’t Halloween in October?”</p><p>The blood-covered woman shrugged, and the one next to her just rolled her eyes, picked out a cigarette from her pocket, and placed it between her lips.</p><p>“Just drive,” she said, then chuckled. She looked almost sheepish when she added, as a throwaway joke, “Or my wife might eat you.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The murderous loop in Rio’s brain finally quieted by the time they got back to the hotel. Rio tipped the uber seventy dollars from Leonard’s account—hopefully enough that he wouldn’t immediately call the police—and shuffled into the lobby, where a twenty-something concierge was busy thumbing through his phone.</p><p>Very aware of their appearance, Rio tried to move as quietly as possible towards the elevator, dragging a still very sedated Agatha behind her, each of her footsteps leaving giant red imprints on the carpet. It was only when she began to rapidly poke the elevator button that the boy seemed to look up, the steady stream of Tiktoks on his phone abruptly quieting.</p><p>“Oh, shit,” he whispered. “Are you guys okay?”</p><p>Rio could hear him approaching them, and the back of her mind began to light up again, the cords of her muscles tightening. <em>Shit, shit, shit. </em>She really didn’t want to turn the hotel lobby into a scene from The Shining. </p><p>She squeezed Agatha’s forearm in a way she hoped communicated <em>please do something.</em></p><p>“We’re fine,” Agatha cut in immediately. Even drugged to oblivion, she could turn it on in a second. “My wife had a little slip.”</p><p>
<em>My wife.</em>
</p><p>Rio had thought it was maybe a one-off in the car. But she’d let it slip twice now.</p><p>And it made Rio’s heart ache. </p><p>Because in the single minded state she was in right now, she couldn’t lie to herself, there was simply no energy to; she didn’t want it to be a performance anymore. </p><p>She wanted to be Agatha’s wife all of the time. </p><p>A thought she kept very much to herself as Agatha managed to Suggest the boy out of their business—which was a real achievement, even for her, given that they were one, handcuffed, and two, covered in buckets of blood—but one gentle <em>click</em> later, the elevator door shut closed behind them, the noise from the street drifted away, and they were bathing in soft, fluorescent light, alone.</p><p>And if Rio’s heart was hurting before, it cut even deeper when Agatha immediately sagged against her, her fingertips starting to shake, like her body was coming down from a high. She pressed her mouth to Rio’s collarbone, resting her forehead on her throat. Rio could feel her take shallow breaths against her skin.</p><p>“My head hurts so badly,” Agatha mumbled. “I think that asshat might have actually poisoned me.”</p><p>Rio’s instinct to kill immediately flared again. But as Agatha’s grip around her tightened, her arms slinking around her waist, that part of her brain went quiet.</p><p>Vengeance wasn’t going to help this situation. Plus—there was quite literally no one left to take it out on. Maybe except the nineteen year old at the front desk.</p><p>Rio cradled the back of her head, and Agatha made a soft, barely audible noise in response, sinking further into her. Rio’s entire body felt like one livewire.</p><p>“Just preserve your energy,” Rio whispered into her temple, hoping her voice didn’t betray just how scared she felt. “You can feed from me when we’re back in the room, okay?”</p><p>Rio knew Agatha was in bad shape when she couldn’t even muster a joke in reply. The wait between floors felt immortally long, and when the doors finally opened to their room, Rio whisked Agatha into her arms bridal style, laid her shivering body carefully on the bed, and went to run a bath. </p><p>She squatted by the edge of the tub, running her thumb to check the temperature. Every so often she’d glance back at Agatha, still stock-still on the mattress. The only thing that kept Rio calm was the steady beat of her heart. She could hear it from the other room loud and clear, thumping to its usual stubborn pace. </p><p>
<em>She’ll be fine. She’ll be fine.</em>
</p><p>When the temperature was finally suitable—not too hot, not too cold—Rio returned to the bedside to find Agatha notably, terrifyingly <em>absent. </em>She nearly started panicking before she spotted the woman crawling awkwardly on the floor, stabilizing herself with one hand as she rummaged through one of her suitcases.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio exhaled. “Why are you not in bed?”</p><p>Agatha scowled when she dropped the book she was holding. It was a heavy one, nearly textbook size, and her trembling hands couldn’t keep it up. Rio dropped to her knees beside the suitcase, scooping the book up for her. Agatha looked at her expectantly, as if she was about to give it back, to which Rio just—lovingly—glared at her.</p><p>“You can read when you’re not actively <em>dying.</em>”</p><p>“I need to—to un-enthrall you,” Agatha said, her brow knitted in determination as she gripped her hands around the book in Rio’s hands, tugging it uselessly. Rio refused, which only made Agatha double down, practically climbing on top of her. “Give me that. <em>Rio.</em> Hand it over.”</p><p>“Agatha, <em>no.</em>” Rio got another painful zap to her cerebellum when she disagreed, but her Thrall mind knew as well as her real one that the only thing Agatha needed right now was rest, and blood. A lot of blood.</p><p>Agatha made another clumsy but aggressive swipe, and Rio’s back hit the floor. They were both startled to find themselves in the position they ended up in—Agatha on top of Rio, straddling her, breathing heavily; Rio, beneath, holding onto the book like a stubborn bull. Their faces inches apart.</p><p>Agatha’s frenzied expression faded, replaced with a soft frown.</p><p>Rio knew what she was considering, and she nodded instinctually, bringing her hand to wrap around the back of Agatha’s neck. </p><p>“Agatha, do it. Feed from me. You need it.”</p><p>To exacerbate her point—and her willingness—she craned her neck to the side, and pulled down the bloodied lip of her shirt. She could see the desire in Agatha’s eyes when they went faintly red. But there was a hesitance there, too. </p><p>One that made her look away, toward the bathroom.</p><p>“The water is probably getting cold,” Agatha said instead of biting her. “Give me the book, I’m going to get into the tub and find the right passage.”</p><p>Before Rio could contest it, her body was handing over the book, and watching Agatha struggle to her feet. She instinctively helped her up, her hand encircling Agatha’s stomach as she helped her limp towards the bathroom.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said quietly, when Agatha refused to look at her. “You’re being—” <em>An idiot. Stubborn. Suicidal. </em>“Why won’t you feed from me?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply. Not until they were at the lip of the tub, and Agatha’s body was shaking so badly her knees were giving out. And if there was a way that Rio could cut herself open and feed herself to Agatha on a stick, she would. Because she was being ridiculous, and Rio was getting nervous, and frustrated, and terrified.</p><p>“Help me out of this,” Agatha instructed when her arms proved too weak to shrug her dress out of them. Rio, in a mix between following instructions and malicious compliance, ripped the back of it open with a fingernail, tearing it in two.</p><p>Agatha turned her head around to glare at her. And Rio realized if Agatha ever did die someday, that would be the face she’d be making in the end.</p><p>“I liked that dress.”</p><p>“And I like you alive. But we don’t seem to agree on everything.”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“It looks worse than it is.”</p><p>“It looks like you have the death rattles.”</p><p>Reluctantly, Rio helped Agatha in, the water splashing up and onto the tile before Agatha was fully submerged. She sat in the tub with her neck pressed to the edge, her entire body vibrating under the water. Her heartbeat was starting to steadily increase.</p><p>Feeling helpless to do anything else, Rio squatted by the tub awkwardly. “Your heart is hammering.”</p><p>“Hand me the book.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s brain was teetering on the edge of insanity. She felt her muscles twitch, demanding to follow orders, but she knew those orders were stupid and ludicrous and the longer Agatha forwent blood, the closer she was risking something irreparable.</p><p>
<em>Fuck it.</em>
</p><p>It felt like dragging an anchor with her bare hands, but she forced her body away from Agatha, towards the small minibar by the bed. Her nerves screamed at her to turn around and <em>What are you doing? Follow orders, follow orders, </em>but she refused—grabbing a martini glass, smashing it against the wall, and then picking up a large slice of glass.</p><p>Agatha’s frail—and yet still demanding, always, up until the very end—voice echoed from the bathroom. “Rio? What are you doing?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer her with words. She slid back into the bathroom, under the soft, glowing lights, and shucked her bloodied clothes off. Agatha’s eyes watched her in astonishment as she climbed into the bathtub, water splashing again onto the floor. </p><p>She settled in on her knees, centimeters away from Agatha’s trembling legs.</p><p>And brought the sharp line of glass up to her own neck.</p><p>She expected Agatha to react badly to this. But what she didn’t expect was the tears that immediately welled up in her eyes. Rio frowned.</p><p>She didn’t want to make her cry. She just wanted her to not <em>die.</em></p><p>“Put that down.”</p><p>Rio’s hand twitched at the command. But she kept it there.</p><p>“Agatha, I— you <em>need</em> to drink. Either I feed it to you myself, or you come drink from me. I don’t know why you’re resisting this.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth shivered open, then closed. Then, finally, she looked up at Rio, her glassy eyes glowing in the dark.</p><p>“My mother used to drink from her thralls,” she said. A single tear streaked down her cheek, joining the wide pool between them. “They would die right after.”</p><p>A beat passed, the red light above them flickering. It painted a gorgeous blush across Agatha’s face, down her neck, caressing the sliver of her chest not submerged under the water—and Rio felt like she was in the presence of the ocean’s most stubborn siren. The type to lure sailors out of their ships just to yell at them.</p><p>With a sigh, Rio set the glass down on the side of the tub.</p><p>“Okay,” she said, nodding slowly as she waded closer to Agatha, so their bodies were pressed flush together. “And are you planning on killing me?”</p><p>She raised a hand to Agatha’s cheek, and Rio watched Agatha’s chest shudder. Goosebumps spread across her arms, across the flesh of her neck.</p><p>Agatha stared into her eyes with so much fear, it nearly made Rio’s heart break in half. </p><p>“No,” she said. “But what if I do it without meaning to? What if that’s just how it works? What if there’s something I’m missing—something I haven’t read yet?”</p><p>Rio smiled at her; smiled so she wouldn't do what she really felt like doing—which was cry. </p><p>Because, for as many years as she’d known Agatha, it was only in that moment that she pieced together why she was such a voracious learner, an obsessive planner; why she read so obsessively, through the night and into the morning, illuminated by nothing but a tiny nightlight; why she always needed to be the smartest person in any room.</p><p>It wasn’t just ego. It was also, terror.</p><p>Deep and unshakeable doom.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Rio said quietly, stroking her fingers around the back of Agatha’s neck. “I don’t mean to injure your gigantic ego, but don’t you think if I was that easy to break, the most powerful vampires on Earth would have managed?”</p><p>She dragged her free hand down Agatha’s side until it was under the water, then skimmed it along Agatha’s hip until it found her nervous hand, and squeezed it tight.</p><p>Agatha shivered beneath her, but managed to laugh darkly all the same.</p><p>“You should never underestimate the monstrous size of my bad luck.”</p><p>“And you should stop underestimating just how much I’d fight to stay alive if it means spending one more precious, stupid second with you.”</p><p>Agatha looked startled by that confession. Rio did, too; it lurched out of her with the same certainty she’d handed Agatha the book, or helped her into the tub.</p><p>But when Agatha recovered, it wasn’t fear in her eyes.</p><p>It was something that looked dangerously like—</p><p>“You have <em>no </em>self preservation instincts,” Agatha said, shaking her head, but she was leaning towards her.</p><p>“I guess that makes us two peas in a pod.”</p><p>And Rio expected Agatha to bite her, then—it would have made sense, with her fangs peeking out from between her teeth, and the flush on her face—but instead her trembling wet hand snaked around Rio’s neck, and she kissed her, hard.</p><p>The kiss went on, and on, Agatha losing herself in it, her fingers itching in the back of Rio’s damp scalp, her naked chest sliding against Rio’s. And because Rio couldn’t resist, and also because she needed to nudge Agatha gently back to reality:</p><p>“I thought we weren’t supposed to do that,” she whispered.</p><p>And because Agatha could be on her deathbed and still be insatiably, incurably curious, she asked against Rio’s lips, “Do what?”</p><p>“Kiss outside of … sex.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck <em>off.</em>” Before Rio could reply, Agatha drew away, and looked at her in a way she had never looked at her before—there was a freedom there that was hard to describe, trapped usually under so much fear. “I never meant that seriously.”</p><p>Rio licked her lips, her heart hammering. “I’m a stickler for rules, Agatha. You can’t just say something and not mean it.”</p><p>“Fine. New rule, then.” She looked briefly terrified, but she seemed to swallow it down, a hard shot of liquor followed by a new confidence. “Let me kiss you forever, whenever I want to. And I’ll try to start being okay with wanting it.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip nervously. Rio’s heart veered on implosion. </p><p>But before she could say something incredibly stupid like <em>Are those wedding vows? </em>Agatha’s eyes went wide, and she clutched her chest.</p><p>“Oh shit,” she muttered. </p><p>Rio shot up in alarm. </p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Rio could hear Agatha’s heart skip several beats. Her pulse, which was normally like a comforting gong, had started hiccuping. Stopping altogether for a few milliseconds at a time. Rio knew vampiric hearts could take more of a beating, but this—</p><p>“Hm,” Agatha said. “Yeah, that’s not great.”</p><p>Looking at the light fade, almost casually, in Agatha’s eyes, Rio felt more alarmed than she’d ever felt in her life.</p><p>An indescribable fear that made her human again.</p><p>A fear that made her a little girl again, hiding behind the door, knuckles turning white as she watched Wilhelm take her father, then her mother.</p><p>Watched their bodies drop to the floorboards, bloodless, their mouths still open wide, like they’d died in the middle of the sentence. </p><p>Saw them shuffled away like dust into coffins hours later by the priests. </p><p>She had gone through life for so many years feeling powerless to death. Mystified by how easy it was to cause it—but how impossible it felt to prevent.</p><p>“Agatha. Bite me,” she begged, holding the back of Agatha’s head. “<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>Agatha shook her head vehemently, even as she clenched her chest. </p><p>“I can’t do it,” she said, through stuttering breaths. “I don’t trust myself.”</p><p>“Well, <em>I do.</em>”</p><p>Rio drew her own fangs down, and bit into her lip so hard it drew blood. A <em>lot</em> of blood. Dribbling down to her chin, curling around the base of her neck. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes immediately darkened to near-black. </p><p>She could see the other woman fighting every instinct in her biology. </p><p>And Rio suddenly knew what Agatha needed to hear. </p><p>“You’re not her, Agatha,” Rio pleaded quietly, tears streaking down her face. “You’re not bad. You’re not beyond saving. You’re not unloveable. And you won’t kill everything that… that loves you.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. </p><p>She took in a long breath, and Rio could see the battle behind her eyes. One that had been waging for a long, long time.</p><p>But that was the funny thing—sometimes things that seem like they’ll go on forever can end in a single blink.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I know.”</p><p>And she leaned in.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And nothing could have prepared Rio for the feeling of it.</p><p>Agatha tucked her trembling fingers into the side of Rio’s face, and sucked on her lip like it was life-or-death—and Rio supposed it was—but it felt only like heaven as she felt her blood flow into Agatha’s open mouth. Agatha whimpered at the taste of it.</p><p>“I need to unwind you,” she said, voice breaking. “We can’t do it like this.”</p><p>Rio brought both arms around her, clinging to her so close that their bodies felt like one warm, damp, creature drowning in a pool. </p><p>“We have all the time in the world,” Rio said. “As long as you stay <em>alive.</em>”</p><p>Eventually, after a few minutes, the blood went dry from Rio’s lip, and as much as she wanted—needed—to keep kissing Agatha, she had other priorities. </p><p>“Mouth’s not enough,” Rio breathed haggardly. “Drink from my neck.”</p><p>“Mouth’s <em>plenty.</em>”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>With a groan of protest, Agatha moved to kiss her cheek, then her chin, blood streaking across Rio’s skin as Agatha slowly made her way down to her neck. Rio thought—sensibly—she would stop there, but she kept going.</p><p>“What are you…”</p><p>“Lean back.”</p><p>Rio’s Thrall brain obeyed instantly. And she cursed herself when she felt water splash onto the floor, felt her body sag into the tub, vibrating, suddenly, with <em>want.</em></p><p>Agatha kissed down her chest, hands scraping at her sides. Rio felt her thighs squeeze involuntarily when Agatha reached her stomach, kissing past her navel.</p><p>“Agatha, I said, <em>bite me</em>,” Rio groaned.</p><p>And it must have been something in her tone—because Agatha <em>finally </em>obeyed. Her fangs sunk in quick and fast into the flesh of Rio’s thigh, and they both moaned in unison.</p><p>Something in that action—in Agatha obeying <em>her</em>—made a part of the veneer clouding Rio’s mind crack. Like taking a mallet to a piece of hard plastic. </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio moaned, letting her head hang back against the edge of the tub as Agatha’s hands cradled her hips. “We’re not going to need that book.”</p><p>Agatha’s fangs slunk out of her at her words, big cerulean eyes clouded as she looked up at Rio in a daze. </p><p>Rio decided in that moment that there would be nothing more beautiful than Agatha Harkness—hair drenched, naked in a blood-red bathtub, looking at Rio like she decided the fate of everything—ever again.</p><p>“What did you say?” Agatha whispered, her breath cool against Rio’s thigh.</p><p>Rio noticed that she was shivering much less. Just a few goosebumps left on her skin then. And her heartbeat was coming regularly now, beat after beat. </p><p>
<em>She’s okay. She’s okay.</em>
</p><p>So, with quiet relief, Rio said, “I think I figured out how to unwind myself.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened.</p><p>“You did?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Don’t be so cryptic,” Agatha huffed—and oh, she was definitely feeling better, the audacity was coming back in waves—“How?”</p><p>Rio blushed. She looked away, toward the purling red water, which was rippling with every shallow movement Agatha made.</p><p>Rio took in a long breath.</p><p>“This might get a little weird.”</p><p>“We’re swimming in a bathtub full of other people’s blood, Rio.”</p><p>“Fine. Do you trust me?”</p><p>Agatha’s wordy mouth stilled. She laid her head against Rio’s thigh, staring up at her with a quiet intensity as the bath water lapped the blood from her lips.</p><p>“Completely,” she whispered, like she was in a confessional.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, threading her hands through Agatha’s hair, and tugging it slightly, so she was looking completely at her. </p><p>She tugged deep into her own chest, past the anvil that was sitting over her heart, and she willed her own eyes to turn lightly red.</p><p>“Kiss me,” she said.</p><p>Instantly, Agatha understood. She snaked up her body, and shoved Rio backward into the back of the tub—compliant, obedient, but never easy.</p><p>“Bite my neck,” Rio ordered softly next, and felt her mind strain to get the command out. But each time Agatha obeyed, it hurt less; like Rio was a creature crawling in the sewers, rapidly approaching the light seeping through the grates.</p><p>“Yes, baby,” Agatha murmured into her ear, and Rio groaned.</p><p>“Fuck. Call me that again.”</p><p>“Baby?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“My baby,” Agatha moaned, fangs pinching into her neck; then Rio’s nape, her collarbones. Rio felt herself get wet even in the bath. Everything felt warm, and gooey, like she was passing through something—passing back <em>into</em> something. </p><p>“Go down,” Rio said. “I want—”</p><p>
<em>Your wants don’t matter.</em>
</p><p>“No, they do, I want—”</p><p>
<em>You don’t matter. You’re nothing. You’re just a toy.</em>
</p><p>“No,” Rio hissed, and Agatha stopped. Rio shook her head. “Not you, fuck. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t—we shouldn’t do it this way.”</p><p>Agatha withdrew, and Rio expected her to tell her it was okay, to say something placating, to tell her to just <em>not worry about it</em>, but she didn’t do any of that.</p><p>“Rio,” she said softly. “Take your time. There’s no right way to do any of this.”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>Her whole life, long before she’d been Turned, her compulsions had ruled the way she lived. She did things obsessively or not at all. Punished herself for things that looked arbitrary to other people. Dealt with nonsensical thoughts that looped over and over.</p><p>And even though Agatha had always been understanding, Rio had, in turn, always tried her best to hide that part of herself—to do the counting in her head, practice her rituals while Agatha slept—because she thought, at some point, if she exposed to much of her raw strangeness, Agatha would realize she was irredeemably wrong, and give her an ultimatum.</p><p>Rio had always felt like she was hiding a monster inside of a large trench coat. That if she minimized her—always irrational, she thought—desires, and kept them hidden and out of sight, then maybe she could keep Agatha forever. </p><p>She was starting to feel very foolish.</p><p>And her brain was starting to feel a lot like <em>hers</em> again.</p><p>“I know what I want,” Rio said softly. “And it isn’t to boss you around.”</p><p>Before Agatha could get a word out, Rio pushed her gently back against the other side of the tub. She pressed her lips to Agatha’s, and used her free hand to trail down Agatha’s stomach in the water, then paused, right at her thigh.</p><p>She felt Agatha squirm, pressing her hips up, and Rio almost gave her what she wanted immediately. But this was about what <em>she</em> wanted, too.</p><p>Rio pulled back slowly, watching Agatha’s eyes as she took a long breath in, readying herself.</p><p>“I want to make you feel good, because… I am in <em>love</em> with you, Agatha. I’m in love with you as a person, as myself, not a thrall, not a pet, not a toy,” Rio said, and Agatha’s eyes widened—a smidge with panic, but she didn’t pull away, didn’t stop her, didn’t interrupt—so Rio continued, feeling the words come up her throat like needles, but she needed to say them, she needed to force them out. “And I need… I <em>deserve</em> to know if you love me, too. So please. Just tell me. Whatever the answer is.”</p><p>Rio watched Agatha’s bobbing throat, her wide pupils, her frozen mouth, and waited for, at worst, another Suggestion, or at best, a quiet rejection. Because Rio didn’t know if Agatha loved her. She hoped, sure. But she didn’t know.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said. And it wasn’t <em>I love you</em>, because with Agatha it was never that simple, but it wasn’t a <em>no</em> either. It wasn’t running.</p><p>“Okay?” Rio asked, quizzically.</p><p>Agatha nodded again. Then she leaned in, pressed her lips to Rio’s and whispered, shallowly, “Touch me.”</p><p>“...Touch you?”</p><p>Rio’s mind reeled. Was this Agatha avoiding it? Was this her taking the reins and putting them back somewhere safe, somewhere she could understand—sex, and nothing more than that? But before she could ask, Agatha’s hand found hers again.</p><p>“Trust me,” she said, repeating Rio’s sentiment from earlier. “Okay?”</p><p>And Rio would trust her with the world, so she did.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>She slid her hands down Agatha’s stomach, and quickly found her center, dipping inside. It was warm, otherworldly warm—and Rio nearly broke completely, forgetting everything she ever wanted, when Agatha immediately bucked up against her. </p><p>“Oh wow,” Rio mumbled, awe-struck no matter how many times Agatha let her touch her, no matter the circumstances. “You’ve been this wet for me the whole time?”</p><p>”Of course I have,” Agatha hissed. “I’ve been wet since I saw you walk into Strange’s room, dripping in blood. I’ve been on the verge of coming since we left the party.”</p><p>Rio kept her fingers circling, exactly the way she knew Agatha liked it, and she was rewarded within moments with a moan.</p><p>“Oh god, Rio. <em>Rio.</em> Baby.”</p><p>The pet name made her groan, and Rio nestled into Agatha’s chest, pressing kisses to her collarbones, then descending down to her breasts.</p><p>“Can I—”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes. <em>Please.</em>”</p><p>Needing no more encouragement, Rio sucked a nipple into her mouth, and she felt Agatha get impossibly wetter, melting around her fingers.</p><p>“Oh god,” Agatha moaned, her hips seizing around Rio’s palm. “You feel way too fucking good—I can’t—you need to catch up—”</p><p>Rio could faintly hear Agatha muttering nonsense in the background, but she was too consumed with the feeling of Agatha in her mouth, Agatha around her <em>fingers</em>, to notice, that was until Agatha took her by the hair and gently dragged her off her breast.</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>Rio looked up at her, momentarily afraid she’d done something wrong, but she wasn’t afforded much time to worry about it—because Agatha was forcing her down into the water, climbing over her so her center was gliding against Rio’s leg, and her hands were suddenly dragging down Rio’s stomach, towards—</p><p>Rio moaned impossibly loud.</p><p>She nearly came the moment Agatha touched her. If there was one remnant from the thrall still living at the very edges of her brain, it was that Agatha owned her body like it was her property—she could just dance her hand around Rio’s thigh and she’d probably come just at the thought of it, clenching around nothing.</p><p>But she wasn’t clenching around nothing. </p><p>Agatha’s fingers were melting around her clit, and Agatha’s mouth was pressing incessantly to her lips, then her cheeks, then her forehead, just sowing adoration into Rio’s skin.</p><p>Rio’s hips jittered. She felt herself falling apart. If this was Agatha’s version of a love confession, she’d take it. She didn’t need the words.</p><p>“Don’t come yet, baby,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio groaned. “You’re making that really difficult.”</p><p>Agatha laughed lightly against her skin. She slowed her hand, and Rio was about to protest, but Agatha didn’t give her time to.</p><p>She leaned back, so she could look into Rio’s eyes, and she said, quietly, with a storm that Rio couldn’t quite comprehend lurking behind her gaze, “Bite me.”</p><p>Rio crinkled her brow, but she was in too deep to question anything at this point, and Agatha was still twitching her finger against her, teetering her off the edge of a cliff, so she nodded, and sunk her teeth softly, carefully, into the skin of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Oh god,” Rio cried out, and she knew instantly that it was too much. That she wouldn’t be able to hold on. “I’m going to—”</p><p>But then Agatha’s teeth, like a guillotine finding its victim, sunk into <em>her </em>neck.</p><p>And Rio understood.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha’s teeth entered her throat, and Rio saw oblivion.</p><p>For a moment it was only white. Pure, hospital wall white, accompanied by a shrieking ringing in her ears. She almost swore it was death—that Agatha had finally managed to kill her. </p><p>Not a terrible way to go, all things considered.</p><p>But at the very edges of her consciousness she could still feel the soft lapping of the bath water; the electrocuting feeling of Agatha’s warm, insistent leg pressed against her center, the ridge of Agatha’s nose grazing against her jawline as she drank.</p><p>Rio gripped the side of the bath, her vision pulsing in and out. She saw a blurry glimpse of Agatha as she retracted her teeth. Felt Agatha’s wet hand cup the side of her cheek, her pointed red acrylics scraping along her neck, circling the bite mark. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes stared at the bite nervously, then looked at Rio, who was blinking slowly, like a patient coming out of a sedative. </p><p>As Rio’s eyes cleared, Agatha slowly began to once again have one head instead of two, the hundreds of tiny black floaters that had once cluttered her vision fading.</p><p>And in their absence was a woman, drenched in blood and bath water, looking more stunning than any other creature of God’s invention.</p><p>“Did it work?” the beautiful creature whispered. Rio remembered that her name was <em>Agatha</em> a moment after, her brain catching up with reality.</p><p>Rio whispered back, still stunned, “Did what work?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “I don’t feel it either,” she said, pressing lightly at the two indents in her own neck. “Maybe I executed it wrong somehow.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, leaning over the tub and reaching for her book.</p><p>“Stupid, egregiously specific vampire rituals. Stay there. Give me one second to read the passage again.”</p><p>The deep disappointment—and relentless persistence—in Agatha’s voice sent shocks down Rio’s spine when she realized what she was talking about. </p><p>Agatha had meant to marry her with that bite.</p><p>And “oh, ok,” was all Rio could muster, pathetically, to address the situation.</p><p>The situation being that she was beginning to feel very warm and very cold at the same time. A fever spread across her forehead and through her limbs. She felt like she was throbbing all over. Inside, outside. She began to shiver, her arms trembling.</p><p>Agatha didn’t notice her slow physical spiral for a whole five seconds, her brow knitted and her mouth made up in a determined scowl as she paged through the spellbook. </p><p>But when Rio’s foot kicked her on accident, her leg spasming from the shaking, Agatha looked up at her again—as if remembering she was there at all—and her mouth opened. Concern frantically shot through her features.</p><p>“Oh Jesus.”</p><p>Rio glanced down at her vibrating arm. “Is this not normal?”</p><p>“No idea. Out of the tub. Now.”</p><p>Agatha shoved her hands under Rio’s arms, dragging her upward. Rio was about to insist she could do it herself, but the moment she tried to put weight on her legs, they almost gave out underneath her. </p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio said, coughing. Was that… congestion? Her nose felt suddenly swollen, like she was ten again with a cold. “Must be allergies.”</p><p>Agatha did not appreciate her input. Or <em>hear</em> her input, really. She was too busy with her favorite activity, which was chastising herself.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have been so rash,” Agatha muttered as she lifted Rio over the edge of the tub, and grabbed a towel with her free hand. She led Rio over to the wall, still not looking at her. “Fuck me for trying to be romantic. Last time I’ll try that again.”</p><p>Rio’s heart shuddered in her chest. She couldn’t recall a single time in six hundred years that Agatha had mentioned an intention to be romantic.</p><p>She softly propped Rio against the wall and began to methodically drag the towel over her trembling shoulders. At first she was pure focus—trying to dry Rio off as fast and efficiently as possible—but slowly Agatha softened, her fingers stalling, and her eyes lifted to meet Rio’s own as she pressed the towel to Rio’s collarbones.</p><p>“I’m shit at this, aren’t I?” Agatha said, and Rio wasn’t sure exactly what she was talking about—using a towel, being in love. </p><p>Rio could guess which one.</p><p>“No one is perfect at anything on their first try, Agatha. Even you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes crinkled with emotion, her fingers tightening around the wet cloth. </p><p>“I’d like to be something above desperately bad at it, though.”</p><p>Before Rio could inform her, for what felt like the hundredth time, that she was not <em>bad</em> at anything—that Agatha had probably come out of the womb unnaturally talented at most things (breathing, screaming, crying, putting the fear of god into medical doctors)—she was being transported somewhere else.</p><p>After ensuring she was dry enough to not ruin the sheets, Agatha carried her to bed, carefully laid her down, and covered her in a truly stifling amount of comforters.</p><p>She then proceeded to do what Rio could only describe as Agatha’s very specific brand of ADHD problem solving—which meant attacking a problem with as many simultaneous solutions as possible. The tea kettle whistled, the mini fridge door slapped open and shut, and slippers furiously padded around the room.</p><p>A whirlwind of seconds later a warm compress was being slapped over her forehead, a cup of chamomile tea perched on the bedside table, and the other side of the bed was sinking with new weight; Agatha, now half-dressed in her purple robe and a black lace bra, was propped up beside her with the book again in her hands.</p><p>Rio recognized two things quietly then, as she studied the space between the two cups in Agatha’s bra, where pale, unblemished skin was taunting her. One, she felt the urge to sneeze, which she hadn’t felt in over a thousand years. </p><p>And two, she didn’t know it was possible for her to want somebody else so much.</p><p>“Human-flu-like symptoms may set in for the recipient within sixty to one hundred and twenty seconds,” she read off the page, then frowned. “Of course these buffoons would regale this incredibly important information to a <em>footnote</em>. It’s barely readable. Two-point font. I missed it entirely.”</p><p>Rio found it overwhelmingly endearing and absolutely on brand that Agatha, instead of verbally recognizing the fact that she’d just bit Rio with, again, <em>the intention to marry her, </em>was instead treating this whole thing like an impersonal science experiment. </p><p>As if a college student in a lab coat had come into the room—asked her “left arm or right arm?”—injected some mysterious chemical into her shoulder, and then told her to sleep it off and see what happens. Maybe she’d wake up with four heads, maybe she’d wake up pregnant with Agatha’s children.</p><p>Rio turned on her side.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said. Agatha didn’t hear her. “<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>Agatha finally looked up from the book.</p><p>“Yes?” she said quietly. Rio could hear her heart beating a marathon in her neck.</p><p><em>This idiot. </em>“What <em>is</em> supposed to happen now?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened, then closed. Her eyes drifted to the page, but Rio could tell she wasn’t actually reading it. She obviously already knew the answer.</p><p>Finally, she cleared her throat. “The book says we have two options.”</p><p>Rio’s brow creased. “Options.”</p><p>“Yes. Either I go get you some blood from that Tiktok-addicted twig downstairs, and all of this blows over in around three hours, or you drink from me until the sun sets, and the shivering stops, and…” She sucked in a sharp breath. “You spend the rest of your life needing to drink from me every full moon. Again and again until the end.”</p><p><em>Again and again until the end. </em>Goosebumps sprouted all over Rio’s body. An effect that only got worse when Agatha reached for her trembling hand underneath the comforters, and intertwined their fingers. Squeezed Rio’s palm softly.</p><p>And Agatha—Agatha looked utterly terrified. As if there was a chance on Earth that Rio would pick the first option. As if that was a<em> likelihood.</em></p><p>Rio inhaled slowly, squeezing Agatha’s hand back. </p><p>“So, this whole ritual causes us to be… what, exactly? Permanently addicted to each other, like two codependent mosquitos?”</p><p>“That’s certainly a way to put it. But yes.”</p><p>“That’s all?” Rio said, as if that were some small, unobtrusive thing. “Does it have any other lasting effects?”</p><p>This time Agatha seemed to look at the page in earnest.</p><p>“The description leaves a lot to be desired,” she muttered. “But it alludes to the fact that our own powers will be triply enhanced, especially during the full moon; something about an increase in, um, <em>passion, </em>on a cyclical basis; and then another thing, in small print in the footnote section, but it's too faded for me to read. It just says <em>in extremely rare cases… </em>then I can’t parse the rest.”</p><p>“<em>Extremely rare cases. </em>Whatever that part is, it’s definitely happening to us, then.”</p><p>“Naturally.”</p><p>Rio laughed, rickety and throaty through her congestion, and a crack ripped through Agatha’s facade, too; she grinned, fangs peeking out.</p><p>Rio let the gentle silence envelop them for a few more seconds, thoughts stewing behind her eyes, before finally breaking it with a whisper.</p><p>“It seems a little pointless, doesn’t it?”</p><p>She surprised both herself and Agatha with the statement. But she didn’t let Agatha pull away. She held her hand firmly, even through the trembling. </p><p>“I just mean, if we miss a month, we suffer for it. If you die, I’ll be caught in some sort of endless feral cycle, and vice versa. And, not to be immodest, but we’re already the most powerful vampires on Earth, so we don’t really need the extra power.”</p><p>To Rio’s surprise—and relief—Agatha, after the initial shock, nodded her head, and chuckled. She turned on her back to face the ceiling as she spoke.</p><p>“No, you’re right,” she said. “It’s completely pointless. Disturbingly pointless. It’s the peak of the vampiric tendency toward performative, masochistic symbolism. We gain nothing from it except the knowledge that we both wanted each other so badly that it seemed rational at the time to become each other’s blood-thralls.”</p><p>Rio breathed shakily at the half-confession in that sentence. </p><p>“Right,” she said.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, sighed—as if in defeat—then turned back to face Rio.</p><p>“The problem is, I<em> do</em> want you that badly.”</p><p>Rio’s entire body went cold, Agatha’s words like an icicle falling from the ceiling of a cave and striking her right through the chest.</p><p>“You… what?”</p><p>“I want you that badly,” she reiterated, quietly, but surely. She was looking at Rio with complete, devastating honesty. “I’ve spent six hundred years skirting around loving you. You can say it was my mother’s fault. You can blame my powers misfiring. But the truth is, no matter which way you frame it, it’s still cowardice. Because I could have bitten you much sooner. Instead I slept with mortals and called them Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s heart swelled and twisted. With happiness, with jealousy, with every utensil in the emotional kitchen sink.</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“No, listen— Just let me—”</p><p>Agatha sat up in bed with a huff, pushed the covers aside, and slipped over Rio’s body, so she was straddling her, her thighs pushing Rio into the mattress, her arms coming to rest on Rio’s shoulders. </p><p>She locked eyes with her, and let out a shuddering breath.</p><p>“You know I’m allergic to the truth, so don’t make me repeat it twice, okay?”</p><p>Rio laughed so she wouldn’t cry. “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha nodded—maybe to Rio, maybe to herself—settled in Rio’s lap, dragged her hands down to Rio’s hips, and held them like they were anchors.</p><p>And Rio felt it coming like a tidal wave. Call it foresight, call it inevitability.</p><p>“Here it is,” Agatha said. “I’ve been in love with you for six hundred years, in twenty-two different countries, speaking six different languages, causing three revolutions, destroying two empires, beheading fifteen monarchs—and it has been the most exquisitely painful experience of my life. And the achingly pointless part of it is, even if you forgot it all again right now, I’d repeat it in a heartbeat.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were swollen with unshed tears as she laughed, bright and beautiful and wrecked. Rio’s heart tried not to burst in her chest.</p><p>“I’ve always considered myself the anti-romantic, because I don’t like poetry or pop music or Notting Hill or Shakespeare or the Old Testament,” she continued. “But I actually think I might just be overqualified in the subject. Because if romance is about finding the point in pointlessness, I found it very early, and latched on like a dog. You are the point to me, Rio. You create meaning in this big, sloppy, pointless soup.”</p><p>She lowered herself down to Rio’s face, a breath away. “So, yes, maybe I’d like to be a vampire about it, and show it with my teeth. But if you don’t want to, that’s okay. I’ll probably ask you again in another millennia. It turns out I’m deceptively patient for the right woman.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught thickly in her throat, tears threatening to spill from her eyes, because she knew Agatha meant it. Knew it from the aching softness in her gaze. Knew it from the way she wasn’t leaning forward, wasn’t forcing her into any corner. </p><p>Agatha loved her. Agatha loved her, and, somehow even more significantly, she was inviting Rio into something she had, throughout her life, had very little access to—</p><p>Choice.</p><p>The ability to say no, and still be loved the same in the aftermath.</p><p>But Rio didn’t want to say no.</p><p>Rio wanted to stay something stupid, because she was in love, deliriously in love, and for the first time in her life, absolutely aware of it. Consequences be damned.</p><p>Because if everything is pointless, why not make wonderful mistakes? </p><p>She looked up at Agatha, hanging above her with that big, stupid, evil, conniving, <em>wonderful</em> smile on her face, and laughed.</p><p>“Just put your fangs in me already.”</p><p> </p>

<p>Rio was no economist. She had hardly graduated primary school before she got an early career in professional bloodsucking. But something she probably could have seen coming was that, when you completely wipe out the elite council of vampires that secretly control the majority of the world’s economy, things can look a little different when you get home the next day. </p><p>Especially when that home is New York City, the penthouse of capitalism.</p><p>The first clue came when their plane landed in the LaGuardia terminal and the moment everyone got their cell phone service back, phones started ringing off the wire. People were crying, screaming, squirming in their seats, bulldozing each other with their suitcases. Rio didn’t put two and two together until Agatha pinched her brow and scowled.</p><p>“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” she paused. “I think I might have to do something about this.”</p><p>Of course what Rio <em>thought</em> Agatha meant was that she was going to start eating people in order to get to the front of the plane. Agatha hated waiting in lines. </p><p>But when Agatha instead just continued watching Finding Nemo on the in-flight entertainment screen until everyone left, Rio got confused. Rio got even more confused when they exited the plane, hauled a cab, and Agatha called someone on the phone. </p><p>“Wanda,” she said. And then Rio felt both jealous and bewildered at the same time. “It’s seven AM. We’ve just landed back home. They’re all dead. Even Leonard. Wall Street is pissing itself. The president is probably going to announce a recession next afternoon. I don’t give a flying shit about any of it, but I figure you and your cheap data plan do. Fix this mess for me and I’ll owe you one, sweet cheeks. Anyway. I’m starting my honeymoon in twenty five minutes. Don’t contact me unless New York City is about to go underwater. Bye.”</p><p>Of course, all Rio heard was honeymoon.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>It was all she could seem to say, too.</p><p>“Honeymoon?” Rio repeated, skeptically, aloud as the door shut behind them. The airbnb was pretty much in the state they’d left it. The curtains drawn, no light escaping in. Takeout boxes open on the table. Their fake passports and fake visas splayed on the couch.</p><p>Agatha plucked off her heels—heels she’d been traveling in, because she was, unless it wasn’t clear, a psychopath—took off her jacket, and opened the fridge. She reached into it and plucked a nip of cherry vodka from the cold plastic. She took a quick, blink-and-you-miss-it swig of the pink liquid, and sighed as she placed it on the counter.</p><p>Rio was about to question her—what could she possibly need liquid courage to say to her after they’d spent twenty-four hours attached by the teeth—but then she slowly turned back to Rio, and cleared her throat. </p><p>“Yeah. I’d like to take you away somewhere nice,” she avoided Rio’s gaze but she couldn’t avoid the betraying blush on her cheeks. “If you’re up for it.”</p><p>And, oh god—Rio’s heart lurched in her chest. Agatha was <em>serious.</em></p><p>The subsequent adoration that flooded her chest pushed a stream of memory straight through her. Memory about what had happened in the last seventy two hours.</p><p>She’d drank from Agatha until the sun set, and just as Agatha had predicted, the shivering eventually stopped. Her body had relaxed, her muscles had softened. They kissed and fucked and smothered each other until the sun danced over the Icelandic water in the early morning, and Rio slowly became overcome with this foreign sense of… being completely alive.</p><p>It’s hard to notice you’ve only ever been half-present until you experience what it’s like to not be. But ever since her parents had died—and Rio had become immortal all in one traumatic summer morning—time, for Rio, had come to a standstill. As if an outside force had come rummaging through her living room with a spear, and struck it through the old grandfather clock, stalling its gears permanently. </p><p>Having her memories repressed hadn’t helped that situation either. She knew Agatha hadn’t done it intentionally, but the ramifications had been the same. A part of Rio had always been stuck in the past. Lodged like a clot in a vein, begging to be released.</p><p>But twenty four hours ago, when she found out Agatha loved her, when Agatha buried her teeth in her and promised her eternity, it was like the watch finally started ticking again. And she understood why she hadn’t heard the clockhand for years.</p><p>“Take me anywhere you’d like,” Rio said, stepping forward, slinking her hands around Agatha’s hips. “Except backwards.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Forwards, apparently, meant California.</p><p>Wanda had wired fifty thousand dollars in their account—Agatha hadn’t bothered to ask where the money came from, but Rio had her ideas when she started hearing about insider trading on the radio—so naturally they’d booked the most expensive, most air-conditioned bungalow off of Malibu beach.</p><p>The room had a giant double King sized bed, a panoramic view of the shore, and three bottles of complementary champagne tucked into the comforter. As soon as they got in, Agatha opened all the windows, kicked off her shoes, and began to uncork the bottle.</p><p>“Isn’t it a little early for daydrinking?” Rio asked. The salty sea breeze oozed in as she finally set down Agatha’s two suitcases, each of which easily weighed two hundred pounds. The floorboards screamed when she lowered them. “Jesus. Did you pack freeze-dried corpses in these?” </p><p>“It’s never too early for champagne,” Agatha said, matter-of-fact, as she drained the bottle, “And two, no, but that’s a great idea. I’ll remember to vacuum seal a few bodies for next time. I didn’t see anything about human remains on the TSA prohibited items list.”</p><p>Ignoring her—admittedly funny—deflection, Rio nonetheless unzipped one of the bags. Shoes upon shoes upon shoes slopped out of the suitcase and onto the floor. All of them had heels that were at least six inches. Rio stared at them in bewilderment. They were at the beach, and Agatha hadn’t even packed flipflops. She had packed four hundred heels and—oh—<em>more</em> alcohol.</p><p>Rio raised the Fireball bottle up so Agatha could see it. It was one of six bottles in the bag. And that wasn’t counting all the whiskey and vodka. This suitcase was basically a mobile bar.</p><p>“What?” Agatha scoffed, perching herself up on her elbows. “Just because you pack light doesn’t mean I need to.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but snort in disbelief. <em>This woman is unbelievable.</em></p><p>“Agatha. There’s packing for a trip, and then there’s packing like America just re-entered the prohibition period. These are different things.”</p><p>Rio shucked off her shoes and climbed onto the bed. The sheets were deliriously soft, and Agatha even softer as Rio ran her hands up the other vampire’s arms. Goosebumps raced across her flesh, sprouting wherever Rio touched. She slunk up her body until she hung like a bat above Agatha’s face, hearing both their heart rates increase at the proximity.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio repeated breathily.</p><p>“Yes?” Agatha said quietly, pupils dilated into discs.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to speak, but she wasn’t sure exactly what she wanted to say. Sometimes something is so obvious that it feels almost silly—almost <em>pointless</em>—to acknowledge it. Like when you let mold grow for too long, and suddenly it’s in the ceiling, and the floors, and the walls, and it feels fruitless to try and fix any one room without tearing out the entire foundation. </p><p>For as long as Rio had known Agatha, Agatha drank. But it wasn’t just drinking. She smoked, she gambled, she went clubbing, she killed, she played with every vice in the book of humanity.</p><p>Bottomline, where a distraction was available, Agatha abused it until it was boring. Of course, she had good reason to. For hundreds of years she’d been living in a version of reality that was poisoned by a curse her mother put on her. Rio would have drunk herself dry, too.</p><p>It was a small miracle that she’d gotten Agatha to admit her feelings to her at all. It was a bigger miracle that she hadn’t run away ten minutes after. But Rio could see now that <em>this</em> was a form of running. Drinking then kissing Rio. Drinking then holding her hand. Drinking then sleeping with her. This was the last stand of Agatha’s defenses in a very long, long war.</p><p>“Don’t think so hard,” Agatha said, smiling shallowly. “Skewer me with it already.”</p><p>“Skewer you?” Rio laughed, narrowing her eyebrows in concern. “Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha bulldozed ahead, “It’s okay if you’ve gotten cold feet. I get it. You were high on adrenaline. I mean, you killed how many people? Not to mention the fainting. The almost dying. Quite frankly you were not in your right mind to make the kind of decision you made. And then I shipped us off on some kind of insane honeymoon like we’re just a couple of—”</p><p>“Agatha. That is not—I can’t even believe—I’m not getting cold feet,” Rio said, shaking her head. “My feet are very warm.” She made her point by pressing one to Agatha’s thigh. The other woman squealed when they were in fact as cold as ice. </p><p>“You don’t need to numb yourself anymore,” Rio said quietly. “I don’t <em>want</em> you to numb yourself anymore.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. Rio felt the other woman’s skin grow cold and clammy.</p><p>“I’m not numbing myself.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio narrowed her eyes. “You’re literally drunk<em> right now.</em>”</p><p>“I wouldn’t say <em>drunk.</em>”</p><p>“Okay. Tipsy.”</p><p>“Maybe a…” Agatha bit her lip in concentration. “Maybe a <em>tad </em>tipsy<em>.</em>”</p><p>“Uh huh.” Rio cupped her stupid, perfect cheek. “Sober you would never say the word <em>tad.</em>”</p><p>“Wrong. I tad-illy would.”</p><p>Agatha grinned at her, wide and stupid and, yes, <em>obviously</em>, drunk. And Rio was, of course, in love with her. Even when she lied.</p><p> Maybe <em>especially </em>when she lied.</p><p>Before Rio could get another word out, Agatha flipped them over. The part of Rio that was ready to sit down and have a real conversation quickly crumpled as Agatha’s red lips pressed to her neck, and bit. “Agatha,” she whined. It was only a nip—barely teeth through flesh—but she felt it spread across her body like an infection.</p><p>“God. Nothing makes me feel more like an addict than your body,” Agatha breathed into Rio’s neck. “I’ll put down the vodka and never visit a casino again, for the rest of my immortal life, if you let me undress you right now. Promise.”</p><p>“You <em>never</em> keep your promises.”</p><p>“I really don’t,” Agatha admitted into her skin. “But I really want to undress you.”</p><p>Rio wanted to let it happen. She really did. Because she loved Agatha, because Agatha was the sexiest woman to grace Earth in a millenium, but mostly because when Agatha bit her again, she felt something entirely new.<em> </em></p><p>It brewed low in her stomach, a hunger like nothing else she’d experienced before, as a human or a vampire. This ravenous instinct to consume, to press so close to Agatha that they might slip and fold and, in some odd cosmic accident, become each other<em>. </em>It made no sense, and yet she felt herself yearning for it, wrapping her hands around Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>“I feel strange,” Rio whispered. </p><p>For all of Agatha’s bravado, that small admittance caused her to immediately withdraw, hovering over Rio with a frown on her face. There was that immediate guilt again.</p><p>“You didn’t do anything wrong, baby,” Rio said, cupping her cheek. Agatha sunk into the touch and sighed, red eyes dulling to green. “But I don’t think we should do this right now. I think I have a… headache, or something. I don’t know.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s the sun. It’s leaking through the blinds.”</p><p>Agatha was up in a flash. She tucked all the light out of the room, paced around adorably, then came back to Rio’s side and put a hand over her forehead.</p><p>“A fever, maybe? You’re very warm.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “You were just trying to have sex with me. Of course I’m <em>warm.</em>”</p><p>Agatha smiled greedily, letting her hand wander down toward the top of Rio’s boxers.</p><p>“I wonder where else you’re warm.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>“Sorry. <em>Sorry.</em>”</p><p>“Are you?”</p><p>“Not usually. This time, kind of.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her longingly in the dark, her pupils adjusting with vampiric focus to discern Rio’s features even without a light source. The soft, worried expression on Agatha’s face made Rio’s heart tighten with a terrible, aching fondness.</p><p>Agatha was clearly in love. She wasn’t trying to hide it, either.</p><p>She was just, predictably, really bad at letting herself experience it without a chaser.</p><p>Rio found Agatha’s hand under the sheets. It was warm and nervous, and Agatha held on tightly to Rio’s fingers as soon as they were close enough to attach to.</p><p>“What are you scared of?” Rio whispered. “What’s still lingering?”</p><p>Agatha’s pupils immediately dilated. In fear, in adrenaline. She chuckled darkly.</p><p>“It’s stupid.”</p><p>“It can’t be that stupid if you’re pushing it down with four hundred dollars worth of vodka.”</p><p>Agatha glared at her, but Rio just squeezed her hand more tightly. Agatha took in a long breath, then closed her eyes, as if she couldn’t say it and look at Rio at once.</p><p>“What if now that I finally have what I want,” she paused. “I end up ruining it?”</p><p>A beat passed. Rio could hear Agatha’s heartbeat rabbeting louder than the tide outside. Rio shook her head. Because, God, this woman—</p><p>“Just for the sake of entertaining this thought spiral, how could you possibly ruin it?”</p><p>Startled to find her confession met with a <em>joke, </em>Agatha blinked, her mouth stuttering.</p><p>“I’m serious, Rio. What if I—what if I just—”</p><p>Agatha trailed off. Rio cleared her throat. “Yes? I’m waiting.”</p><p>“God, I don’t know,” Agatha groaned. Apparently, saying the fear out loud had unboxed it like a Christmas present—and she found a whole lot of nothing inside. Yet, she continued to pull at strings nonetheless, “What if I make you fall out of love with me? What if the honeymoon phase ends, and you realize all that yearning was a lot more fun than actually being with me?”</p><p>“That will not happen.”</p><p>“How can you be sure that won’t happen?”</p><p>“Because… Agatha,” Rio sighed. “I think you would sooner have to drill a hole to the center of the Earth, wrap me in steel chains, attach me to a five thousand pound weight, and drop me to burn there, than ever, in a million years, try to get me to fall out of love with you. It’s a settled manner. I’m in love with you, I’ve been in love with you. You get to choose what you do with that information. But I’d hope you wouldn’t drink yourself out of missing the opportunity.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened, then closed. Then opened again; closed again. She crossed her arms, as if defensively posturing herself to evade that insane declaration of loyalty. But ultimately, when Rio said nothing more, just stared and stared and <em>stared, </em>Agatha’s arms weakened.</p><p>“I don’t want to miss the opportunity,” she repeated quietly, defeatedly.</p><p>“I was hoping so,” Rio said, with an affectionate laugh. “Because I don’t actually think I have a headache. I think…” She trailed her hands around Agatha’s hips, and breathed in.</p><p>Agatha seemed to know what she was thinking without her evening saying it.</p><p> “That the blood pact we committed to hastily in the middle of the night in Iceland—while romantic—might, in fact, have been a mildly stupid idea?”</p><p>“<em>Yup.</em>”</p><p><br/><br/></p><p align="center"><b>FIVE MONTHS LATER</b></p><p> </p><p>“Oh, god. Devil. Merde. Muie. Scheiße,” Agatha hissed, her back burning against the carpet as Rio thrust down and into her. Her shoulders were probably as red as lava, but she couldn’t even feel it, not when— “Oh god, fangs. Rio. Now. <em>Now. </em>Before I break something.”</p><p>Rio was not faring much better. Unable to find any actual words to turn into speech, she just whimpered in response. Because even though this was their fifth time fucking today—they hadn’t even managed to leave the living room—it felt more unbearably good each time.</p><p>Taking a balancing breath in, she held onto the other vampire’s hips, where Agatha’s lacy black underwear had been pushed aside in favor of Rio’s silicone dick. Rio steadied herself as she lowered her lips to Agatha’s neck, and sunk in. Inside Agatha, two-fold.</p><p>“Oh <em>god,</em>” Rio moaned into her neck. “Fuck.”</p><p>She meant to brace herself with a hand against the floorboards, but she ended up applying so much pressure to the wood, her fist shot straight through it.</p><p>“Did you just punch through the downstairs neighbor’s ceiling again?”</p><p>Dazed, Rio slowed the pace of her hips, and raised her head to look at Agatha. The other woman was already biting down a laugh. Before Rio could respond, she saw the bald head of their seventy-two year old neighbor appear in the circle of missing flooring.</p><p>He had his phone tucked in the crook of his neck, and, as he glared up at Rio, he said to whoever was on the other line, “No, Martha, I already tried calling the building superintendent. And the police. That didn’t work. I think I’m just going to seal it up with duct tape this time.”</p><p>***</p><p>Agatha had kept her promise. She hadn’t touched a vice—except her cellphone, and her stock investing app—since their conversation at the beginning of their honeymoon, which was obviously great for multiple reasons. One, it made Rio feel very appreciated, and two—even if she hadn’t kept her word, Rio wasn’t sure she would have been able to keep her hands off of her.</p><p>Because, yes, the blood pact had obviously been more than just a romantic gesture. Rio still had no idea what the hell its vampiric purpose was, but all she knew was that since coming back from their honeymoon, their collective sex drive had reached an elevation that far exceeded Mount Everest. And the moon. And the sun. And the Milky Way Galaxy.</p><p>Rio felt completely insatiable, and predictably, Agatha was somehow even worse. </p><p>They would fuck the moment they woke up, and sometimes even before it; Agatha had Rio sleep with the harness on, and on the days she woke up earlier than Rio—which was almost every day since this all begun—she would start dragging her hand up and down Rio’s dick until Rio woke up unbearably hot, her blood pooling so hard in her lower half that she’d feel dizzy.</p><p> They’d both come at least twice before getting out of bed, but the urge would return with a ferocity only ten minutes later. </p><p>Agatha had proposed a frankly insane idea to counteract this, which was that she insisted Rio would fuck her while she was doing just about anything else. Sometimes she’d sit on Rio’s lap while they watched Jeopardy, Rio thrusting into her lazily, with no real pace, and Agatha would drag her red acrylics across Rio’s arm every time she stopped.</p><p>“Are you sure you like this?” Rio would say, feeling self-conscious.</p><p>“<em>Like </em>this?” Agatha would say, as if it was some truly unbelievable question. “Frankly, I don’t think I ever want to watch tv without your dick inside me again.”</p><p>Which of course, one thrust later, made Rio come, pathetically, on the spot.</p><p>And, Rio slowly learned, once you get into a habit like this, it infects everything you do. Agatha insisted Rio fuck her while they folded laundry, while she scrolled through her daily digest of the news, while she purchased stocks—all based on insider info Wanda fed her, naturally—and even, or, well, especially, while she was in the shower. </p><p>It was—as Agatha put it—a convenient place for Rio to wash her hair, condition it, bite her neck <em>and </em>fuck her, after all. All the suds and blood went down the drain.</p><p>The second consequence of this blood pact, which happened to intersect very frequently with the first, was that Rio found it increasingly difficult to control her powers. </p><p>She’d spent hundreds of years working on how much force she let out, and within a couple months, she’d lost almost complete control of it. </p><p>There were an untold number of holes in their bedroom wall. The bedframe had been replaced so many times that they’d started to sleep on a mattress. The couch was missing an entire cushion. One of the windows was shattered, and then repaired, and then shattered again. Rio didn’t even register the time she broke the microwave.</p><p>“It feels like I’m losing control of myself,” Rio said, as they lay on the living room floor, panting after a session—maybe their fourth, or their fifth. “But at the same it feels like…”</p><p>“Like it’s building towards something, isn’t it?”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shot up, as she rolled herself to the right to face Agatha. An episode of the X-files was playing on the TV in the background, the morose detective music a strange and amusing contrast to their naked, blood-soaked bodies.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, reaching out to cup Agatha’s jaw. “You feel it too?”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>“Any ideas, vampire historian?”</p><p>Agatha had been digging through the few historical texts that she could get her hands on, but there wasn’t much except what they’d already found. </p><p>At least, that’s what Rio thought. Until she saw the look on Agatha’s face now. It was weirdly… sheepish. Not quite the same guilt and distance and worry she’d seen months ago, back in California, but a flash of something unfamiliar.</p><p>“I do have… a theory, yeah.”</p><p>“What is it?” Rio said softly, dragging her finger across Agatha’s lower lip.</p><p>Naturally, Agatha broke the news in the most Agatha way possible. She laughed sharply to herself, and then said, as if she’d already resigned herself to fate:</p><p>“How do you feel about children?”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Rio didn’t believe her at first. </p><p>How could she be expected to? </p><p>Agatha loved doing two things: lying, and making Rio go absolutely insane. Because what the fuck did she mean <em>how do you feel about children. </em>How did she<em> feel? </em></p><p>How did she feel about having a family with Agatha?</p><p>How did she feel about carrying Agatha’s child? About Agatha carrying hers?</p><p>How did she feel about creating something with the woman she loved so much that she’d burned inside of her own skull for six hundred years?</p><p>She wished Agatha had asked her something more rational, like <em>how do you feel about the sun exploding. </em></p><p>But what her mind did in response to that question broke the television.</p><p>Like, actually broke it. Not metaphorically. She didn’t even touch the screen. It just shattered, the X-files music puttering out, and Rio’s jaw hanging open.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t take back the joke. She was so serious about it, in fact, that they didn’t have sex for a whole other five hours—which seemed like a lot at the time.</p><p>They actually sat normally, politely, on the couch, ignoring the broken TV, ignoring the man downstairs talking loudly into his cellphone about his car’s extended warranty, and just sitting with the question.</p><p>“Are you… are you pregnant?” Rio said, hardly believing the words were leaving her mouth. Then she looked in disbelief down at her stomach. “Am <em>I </em>pregnant?”</p><p>“God no,” Agatha laughed, rolling her eyes. But then her expression grew more focused. She bit her lip. “At least I don’t think so. Not yet, at least. God knows the lack of literature on the subject is torturing me. Not even Wanda and all her fucking money can produce an actual piece of evidence outside some farytails about how vampire babies are born. But I’m pretty sure if we continue as we are… it will happen. Eventually. Probably. Soon.”</p><p>“And you want that? You… want to have kids with me?”</p><p>In six hundred years, Rio could not have imagined, in her wildest dreams, she would even be able to kiss Agatha. She’d been circling around her like a fly trying to get into a glass bulb. Now she felt like she’d been transported directly inside the very volt of electricity.</p><p>She expected Agatha to say something dismissive. But she didn’t.</p><p>She just shrugged.</p><p>“I know this sounds so pretentious, but I think I’d like the opportunity to be the mother I didn’t have,” she said quietly. “And if I end up failing at that, which I would not be surprised by, then the kid won’t be a total fuckup, because they'll have you. And you’re, well, perfect.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her shyly, and Rio just stared back. Disbelief was the only thing she felt.</p><p>Well, disbelief and the other thing.</p><p>“But if you don’t want kids, it’s fine,” Agatha continued, biting down on her lip. “We can just put ourselves in time out for a few weeks, until this weird heat thing passes—”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, took Agatha by the collar of her night shirt, and kissed her.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>When it happened, it didn’t happen like Rio expected it to.</p><p>It was two weeks later, and they were in bed. An actual bed—Rio was too old to be sleeping on a box-spring—and they’d just finished dinner. </p><p>A few minutes before, they were drinking blood out of wine glasses and listening to Erykah Badu on the vinyl player, slow-dancing like a couple of newlyweds under the ceiling light. Eventually, they got tired, settled into bed, and Agatha had turned over to kiss her.</p><p>“Are you too tired, or…?” she began, her hands on Rio’s stomach. Rio answered her with a kiss to her neck; she bit down, fangs sliding out, and Agatha moaned. “Apparently not.”</p><p>With that encouragement, Agatha’s hand journeyed down to Rio’s center. She slid her fingers under the harness she was wearing, and groaned.</p><p>“God, you’re already so wet.”</p><p>“Have been,” Rio choked as she drank from Agatha’s next. “For weeks. Doesn’t stop.”</p><p>“Let me help you then, baby.”</p><p>At the pet name, Rio whined, and started rocking into Agatha’s hand. Their pace was slower and sweeter than it had been since the change, with less frenetic urgency. Rio fed from Agatha’s neck as Agatha slipped two fingers inside of her, and it was nothing short of divine. </p><p>An hour passed of them just fucking, kissing, breathing. It didn’t end in anything explosive; there was no big moment. No hurrah. All Rio knew was that when she hugged her arms around Agatha at the end of the night, she felt the same way she always did.</p><p>She wanted to love her forever. </p><p>And that would extend to anything else born of her, too.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>All of this culminated in a very 21st century way.</p><p>With a trip to CVS.</p><p>Agatha suggested the cashier into letting her “handle” the transaction—i.e. Agatha slipping behind the register, printing out a bunch of coupons, and not paying for a damn thing—while Rio walked out with every single pregnancy test on offer at the store.</p><p>When they went home, both of them took one just to be safe.</p><p>But lines only appeared on one of them.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p><b>GINGER DRACULA: I’m sorry, you got RIO pregnant?</b></p><p><b>AGATHA: Your first mistake was doubting me.</b></p><p><b>AGATHA: Anyway, do you think I could borrow some more money? We’re broke again, and I’m not sure I want Nicky growing up in an Airbnb.</b></p><p><b>GINGER DRACULA: Oh, for fuck’s sake.</b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
