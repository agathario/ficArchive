<div class="userstuff">
  <h1 align="center">
  <span>CHAPTER 1</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio Vidal sat down at her kitchen table with a glass of cannabis infused soda. She swept her black hair over her shoulder as she had misplaced her hair tie. Her brown eyes sweeping the space once more before finally giving up on its whereabouts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s agent Lilia Calderu, an old woman with more experience in the business than anyone could ever hope to have, had sent her the draft of a script for the interview tomorrow. Rio appreciated being able to preview the content, and this interview was going to be one of her favorites, unhinged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thirst Tweets. That’s what the kids were calling them these days. Rio wasn’t particularly old but she wasn’t one of the 20 somethings running around using the latest terms. She smirked as she opened the doc with screenshots of social media post after social media post – all discussing what people dreamt about doing to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She skimmed the usernames first, entertained, and then a bit alarmed at the creativity of her fans. She rolled her neck as she scrolled back to the top ready to read. Her eyes flicking quickly over the words, her eyes crinkling. Wow. How many people wanted her to “rail them” or run them over with a car? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She snorted. Sometimes, even when she prepped for these interviews, things had a tendency of slipping from her brain to her mouth. Rio bit her lip as she read a particularly good one and snorted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Oh how she wished they knew that she didn’t want to dominate others, but that she wanted to be dominated herself. She sighed, everyone was always so disappointed with that fact in real life. The fact that the characters she played weren’t much like her real self seemed to really underwhelm people. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She skimmed the next few. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Please Rio Vidal, stab me with a knife.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Please Rio Vidal, drown me in your bathtub.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I know what Rio Vidal can do with my holes...</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio continued to read, her responses coming to mind as she wondered what might be too unhinged for this media outlet. She looked back at the top of the page and saw it was with Rain Media Group and shook her head as she took another sip of her drink. Rain wouldn’t mind her unfiltered responses, they would capitalize on it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She made a few notes, but her eyes froze as she made it to the next post. The profile image seemed to be of a beautiful woman, a very beautiful, mature, woman.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness, @downyourroad: Fuckkkk. Miss Vidal! I want to remain respectful, but how can I when you look like THAT? I don’t want to sound too crazy, but gods, bend me over my couch and spank me already.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile widened, she clicked the link to the actual post and navigated to the woman’s profile picture. Her mouth opened slightly. Fuck, she </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> beautiful. Menopause had hit her with a beauty stick. It didn’t look like she altered much of anything. Maybe there was some light botox or filler usage, but Rio had to admit, the slight lines on her skin really did something for her. She flipped through some photos and took notice of the way this woman’s hands were always dancing in every image. Rio whistled low. Damn, how she would like </span>
  <em>
    <span>this </span>
  </em>
  <span>woman to bend her over her own couch and show her what those fingers could do…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took another sip of her drink. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha</span>
  </em>
  <span>, what an interesting name. Sounded witchy, and she loved witchy things. Her eyes glancing around at her decor, she wouldn’t mind adding more flair to her space. Her case of crystals sat prominently near the entrance to her kitchen, a good location for her since she spent a lot of time in this space.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes looked about. While she had been able to afford a home, being a woman of mixed race in Hollywood meant that she didn’t always get paid the same as her peers. Her house was modest and close as possible to where the interviews and studios were located, but it certainly wasn’t the sprawling mansions of her peers. She was lucky she even had a yard at all for her dog. She had thought making it big would mean her art would one day afford her any type of life she wanted, how that had been far from the truth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She leaned back in her chair, tipping it on its feet, something her mother had tried to train out of her at an early age, and eventually had just given up and told her that if she wanted to split her head open, that it would be on her own medical bills. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes devoured Agatha Harkness’s posts before remembering she was supposed to be working. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She left the page open behind another window so she could come back to it later, and went back to the finer details of tomorrow's press event. Her head tilted when she saw information she had missed. She was going to be creating fake profiles to talk to some of the thirst commentators, her mind drifting back to Agatha, she would be fun to respond to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She finished her drink and closed her laptop. She needed to go to sleep and get her beauty rest for tomorrow– unfortunately with Agatha’s cheekbones in her mind’s eye, she knew when she found her bed, she would be doing very little sleeping.</span>

  <span>Chapter 2</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Rio took her phone back from the security guard as she drove to the designated slot for her parking pass. She parked and took a long sip from her overly sugary drink. People always assumed she took things black, like her soul, but she was a real sucker for sweet things. She rolled her neck hearing it pop more than a few times, last night had been a late one. She had gone back years in Agatha’s profile and the woman surely didn’t disappoint, especially this one two piece swim number, Rio had practically been drooling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let out a deep breath and opened her car door, a modest car by any means for someone in her line of work – she didn’t feel the need to splurge, though she did enjoy a good sports car. Her car was… practical. Besides, why blow all your money on a car when you could invest it and grow your net worth?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took one step outside of the car when a young girl ran right into her, knocking her drink out of her hand, luckily not into her outfit. Rio stood there stunned, she waited for the kid to realize who they ran into and start to profusely apologizing when the girl face-palmed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The visitor’s parking is in the back </span>
  <em>
    <span>right </span>
  </em>
  <span>corner of the lot.” She grumbled, “Now there’s coffee all over my shoes…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes widened slightly. “Okay… well…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The girl raised a hand. “Look, this is all fun and games for you, I am sure, but some of us actually work here and don’t get paid much to do so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked about. “So…yeah, I totally get the struggle, I really do. I’ve been there, but,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The girl huffed as she brought out her walkie. “I’ll page Carl to come escort you to wherever you’re going.” The radio started to crackle as Rio placed her hand over the girl’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look kid, there’s no need. I have a meeting with Vic, this door,” Rio indicated with the nod of her head, “13 is where I am supposed to meet her, my agent said…” She moved to unlock her phone when the girl's eyes narrowed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Vic? Really? And what business do you have with her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes and started walking, pocketing her phone. The girl followed behind her. Rio speaking, yet ignoring her gaze. “I’m trying really hard not to flip out on you and pull the whole ‘Don’t you know who I am card’ but you are making it </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span> difficult.” Rio rounded on her. “I get it. You’re in LA chasing your dreams, that’s great, some of us do make it and you never will unless you’re a little delusional – maybe even crazy – but you </span>
  <em>
    <span>really </span>
  </em>
  <span>need to learn the players before one of us gets you fired.” She eyes shifted as a door opened, she saluted coffee girl as she saw Vic walking through the door and waving her over, coffee girl’s mouth hung open as she about shit her pants. “You’re the interview?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed as she plastered a smile on her face for Vic, Lilia had been telling her she needed to smile more and as Vic was one of the people she worked with the most in the industry, for press, she knew she wouldn’t mind her trying something new.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey.” She leaned forward and hugged the older woman quickly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio, my goodness, what happened to your shoes, they’re splashed in mud!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The black haired beauty cringed a little at herself as she searched for a lie. “Coffee actually. I’m so clumsy.” She saw coffee girl slinking up behind her as Vic cast her a narrowed glance. “Well, get Miss Vidal another coffee! We can’t have her falling asleep on set.” She wove her arm through Rio’s and took her through the set door. “How was the drive in?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “You would have thought there was an award show this morning, but I made it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Vic smiled a genuine smile. “Oh you poor thing. You have a bit of a drive too. Well, we have everything set for you and I remembered how you loved gummy worms so I have some good snacks for our breaks. Did you get the posts I sent Lilia?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded as her hand was taken and her fingers were wrapped around a new coffee. Coffee girl avoiding her gaze. She softened her tone. “Thanks sweetheart.” She saw, coffee girl practically jump, but she didn’t have time to deal with her now. She took a sip of the cup as her eyes fell on the small set. “Minimal, just how I like it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Vic swept her arm over the scene. “I wanted you to be the focus.” She showed Rio to her seat and desk. “Will this chair do? It’s my son’s gaming chair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pressed her finger to the seat. “Perfect.” She moved to sit and pulled herself closer to the table as hair and makeup descended upon her. Vic grabbing a folder and reading a script, her hand flicking in their general direction. “Just a slight touch up,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried very hard not to move as fingers swept over her face and hair, she noticed with a slight blush that the woman working on her face momentarily froze when she got to her eyes. Rio offered a warm smile and touched her hand lightly. “I like my eyes dark.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman blushed and moved to add a bit more black around her eyes when Rio smiled, she knew she could get her number if she wanted, and perhaps she would. Her internal monologue slowing down to silence as her eyes came upon the posts on the laptop in front of her. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha.</span>
  </em>
  <span> She would get to see her again. As her face was released, she turned and winked at make up and hair and uttered a quiet thank you as her eyes dove back to the screen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Vic walked over, causing her dark eyes to look up. “Okay, so no rules on my end, we can fix anything in post. Let us have it, baby!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tipped her head. “You got it, coach.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Vic barked some orders and more people filtered into the room, Rio was used to forgetting other’s were there with her, it was part of the craft. She waited for the cue and on ‘Action’ she began.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I’m Rio Vidal, and this is Your Talking to Rio Vidal. Really.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She made an account and read over the first poster's comment, nearly barking out in laughter at reading it over again. “Well, @sandyfeet69, I think you and me could have a good time in the back of your truck. Call me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes flipped to the next, reading it out loud. “Rio Vidal could cut off my balls and stomp on them and I would still say thank you.” Rio dead panned the camera as her voice went flat. “I would cut off your balls, Fred.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let her eyes glide over the next two – delivering some decent one liners when Agatha’s post arrived. She paused, her heart rate picking up, she swallowed the saliva collecting in her mouth and licked her lips, forgetting there were others in the room. She read this one quietly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness, @downyourroad: Fuckkkk. Miss Vidal! I want to remain respectful, but how can I when you look like THAT? I don’t want to sound too crazy, but gods, bend me over my couch and spank me already.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes didn’t lift as she poked her tongue into her cheek in thought. Her mouth lost its filter. “Why don’t you bend </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span> over your couch and we see where the night takes us, Miss Harkness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard laughter from in front of her, her dilated eyes looked up to catch the man behind the camera smirking, before he mouthed ‘sorry’. She raised a hand and gave him a thumbs up, knowing a second later that they would probably do something with that in post, </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She shook her head and continued on. She made another account and really hammed it up with the responses, but her brain was split, and the other half of her mind was solely on Agatha Harkness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat smoking a joint in her living room, a large air filter promptly on the table, because she may have enjoyed the effects of weed, but she was never going to allow her home to smell like a stoner’s den. She was taking in the notes from Vic today, the woman ecstatic with the content, promising to send a draft over to Lilia as soon as it was done.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes lingered back on the socials she had left open since the night before. Agatha’s post hovering in the background. She looked up her new fake profiles and sighed. Damn, that was some of her best work, but the moment this dropped she definitely couldn’t be found using those accounts. Her fans would go rabid, her phone would blow up from all the messages. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had her professional socials linked to her assistant’s email and that poor gay boy had seen and read it all. Billy was a good kid. She wished she could take him on as more than an intern, but unfortunately she only could stretch her spending so far. He was an investment in her career and image building, and hoped she would be able to bring him on forever after her next role – whatever that would be. Her income was steadily trending up and up with every project.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She bit at her lip as she contemplated it. She </span>
  <em>
    <span>did </span>
  </em>
  <span>have a lot of fans, if she wanted to, she could get lost amongst them…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She opened incognito and pulled up a social media site. She </span>
  <em>
    <span>could</span>
  </em>
  <span> just create another account. Her finger hovered over the Sign Up screen before she finally clicked. She stared at the account name box, twiddling her thumbs. Something that said Rio Vidal’s fan, not the person herself. She smirked when she thought of the thirst posts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“@RioVidalsWhore.” She clicked enter and it flashed red.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was already taken. She grunted as she tried again. “Rio Vidal’s Whore… 69?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It flashed blue. She smirked. “Perfect”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved to the interwebs to grab a sexy photo of herself and an unhinged one for the banner image. She smiled, she really liked that silly photo, she had been cackling like a crazy person with her best friend at a premier. She leaned back into her sofa and began to follow a few other fan accounts so she wouldn’t seem too crazy, though her page was new and that should be a red flag on its own. She looked back at her page and edited her description.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio Vidal can run me over with a horse.” She clicked save and admired her page. It seemed very in line with what she had seen others make. Her fingers hesitant as she looked up @downyourroad, her eyes lighting up in glee as Agatha’s face appeared, reading her bio once more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m just a hole for sexy women I will never meet.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. What a forward woman, she wondered if she was that way in person. She clicked follow and was surprised with the speed at which the woman added her back. Her eyes were left blinking in shock. So she was online right now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s stomach started to tighten as she clicked the message, her fingers tapping on her computer as she thought of what to send before she accidentally typed some gibberish, and accidentally hit send. “Fuck.” She muttered as she moved to smack her hand on her forehead. The ping of her computer had her prying her eyes open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Did you summon me? Lol</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The words shot straight to Rio’s core. She was in trouble. She started to let her fingers fly.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I’m glad it worked. Though I must admit that’s… not what I meant to say.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes watched as three dots appeared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I take it you’re after some new Rio content? I haven’t drawn in a few days, I know… how annoying.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. How had she missed that she was an artist?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Is it terrible to pretend that’s not what I was after?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I suppose not. It is always nice to pretend I’m appreciated for being a real person. Alas we can skip the pretense, good job finding my personal profile. While it’s on brand with my interests I don’t think I linked this page to my art page.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio got more comfortable. Letting herself lean onto her side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I’m pretty good at sleuthing. But I must say, you yourself are quite the vision, my lady… if that wasn’t too forward.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes crinkled as she read the next response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Oh a charmer! I haven’t gotten a compliment on my beauty in years, I appreciate the attempt. I’m just lucky I appear to be aging well, though I don’t always recognize myself in the mirror anymore. Early menopause symptoms suck. But thank you… Miss RioVidalsWhore69 for your kindness.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s shoulder’s dropped a bit at the woman’s self deprecation – did she not realize how truly stunning she was? Rio shook her head, trying to get them back on track.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: So I read your thirst post for Miss Vidal, I must say, I can relate.</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sent back a bunch of laughing emojis. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: You saw that did you? Well, she’s quite the beauty, what’s a girl to do at the mercy of her aesthetic? I’m just a single mom wishing for things I can never have… speaking of I feel like I’ve read every fanfiction out there about the woman. Do you have any recommendations I might have missed?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart rate sped up, she was talking about her! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course she was… Agatha was a fan. She rolled her eyes at herself. Her eyes reread the comment again and her eyes took in the extra piece of information, quickly disclosed as if it was a throwaway fact, she had a son.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat back, her fingers disappearing from her keyboard. She wasn’t the best with kids, she tried to be kind, but they really did scare her quite a bit. She reached for her joint that lingered in her makeshift ashtray. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well that was fun while it lasted. But before she could shut down the page, she took a drag of her paper lined stick, letting the smoke out slowly. Her eyes drifted back to Agatha’s conversation. She watched as bubbles came and went, nothing more was sad. She had been having a good time, something that was rare for her. She set her joint down and tapped her foot, there was no harm in continuing to talk to a hot mom, was there? It wasn’t like she was going to end up ever meeting her kid. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sat back into the couch and pulled her blanket over her lap, grabbing her laptop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: you’re pretty hot for a mom.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The emoji was immediate. A laughing rolling face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Thank you.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A blushing emoji was added a moment later. Rio smirked, she still had it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: And lucky for you I’m writing a new story, it’s a good one too, it’s Rio’s last character, the agent, with that woman who was a social worker. Real steamy sort of thing. There’s a lot of ass smacking… would you be into that?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was nothing wrong with a little white lie. She was a creative person. She could come up with something if needed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: oh color me intrigued. Tell me more…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio set her jaw as she reached for some creative inspiration. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: It’s them locked in the office all night for a case. They get up to a little fun, chaos ensues, they ruin evidence, Rio’s character is ready to lose her job for this girl…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thankfully Agatha interrupted her writing before she had to continue about this made up storyline… that she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>most definitely</span>
  </em>
  <span> not about to write for this woman… Was she?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Okay, you have me. Let me know when it’s finished. I hate the suspense of a work in progress. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: you got it, baby.</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 3</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sauntered into Lilia Calderu’s office as she stretched her arms high over her head. “So what’s the verdict? Did I lose you as my agent?” She threw Lilia a smile knowing that the woman was always at least entertained by her antics.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia tried to suppress a smile. “Rio, you’re a scary bitch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio giggled. “Awe, Lilia, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.” As Lilia waved her off, she sat in the chair opposite Lilia’s desk and placed her elbows on top, then her head in her hands. “Did you see that I smiled for you princessa?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia now did smirk. “Yes, though it was a bit… much.” She sat in her chair and leaned back looking Rio up and down. “You’re a lot of work, you know that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio blew out a breath leaning back and letting her arms collapse out to the sides over the top of the chair, her head tilting up. “It’s exhausting being me.” Her face snapped forward a moment later. “Okay, real talk, how was the clip?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lila’s eyes glanced sideways to her laptop, then back. “You nailed it, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio fist pumped the air, “Yes!” Her eyes shifted to Lilia’s notebook. “Now maybe someone will give me another read for something big. It’s…” her voice lost some of its playful edge. “Been a moment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia reached forward and patted Rio’s hand. “I’ve got a few things in the works, I’ll let you know soon I promise.” Her eyes looked at her locked door. “Sharon reached out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat up straighter. “Sharon… as in Sharon Davis of Monument Pictures? That Sharon Davis?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia snickered. “Rio, keep your voice down before neither of us ever work in this town again. Yes, that… woman.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio put her finger to her lips, then zipped her mouth shut, waiting for Lilia to continue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s got a project, something groundbreaking, no clue what yet of course. Wants you to read for it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her bottom lip, shaking her head slightly. “They won’t want me Lilia…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lila knocked on her dark oak wooden desk. “Hey, don’t curse us. She reached out to </span>
  <em>
    <span>me.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio ran her hand through her hair. “Just… keep me posted, yeah?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia nodded. Her face softened. “How is Ruffland?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled at the mention of her dog. “Weird as his mother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia smiled. “You should bring him by to play with Benny this weekend, we’re thinking about going to the beach…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio opened her mouth to speak but her phone beeped chirpily at her. “What the hell…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes looked at an account she didn’t recognize before her sober mind started to fill in the pieces. </span>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad </span>
  </em>
  <span>had sent her a message. Her face split into a smile when she heard the older woman sigh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio, sweetheart, what did you do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up as if the teacher had caught her cutting off the girl in front of her’s ponytail… she had never really known how to flirt appropriately, despite how much she had studied social interaction as a child. She shrugged and tried to school her face. “Nothing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, I’m going to need you to try that again.” She rubbed at her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted uncomfortably in her seat. “I’m just talking to someone new… that’s all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia’s hand slowly lowered. “Do you need an NDA drafted?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio furrowed her eyebrows and shook her head. “No… it’s…it’s not that serious.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia cast a pointed look in her direction and Rio opened her mouth offended. “She doesn’t even know it’s me….”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia just about facepalmed. “Rio…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tapped at the back of her phone. “We’re just… admiring women in the industry together…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At a sharp sigh, and words that Rio practically heard in her head like Lilia had placed them there, she conceded. “Yes, I kinda, met her through that interview thing.” Her eyes took a strong interest in Lilia’s blue waved carpet. Her eyes trailed up slowly when Lilia was silent. “I promise it’s just a bit of fun…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia stood and walked over to her window, gazing out at the skyline of LA. “It’s never just a bit of fun, Rio, not when someone of your status is involved.” She turned crossing her arms. “The very </span>
  <em>
    <span>moment </span>
  </em>
  <span>she knows it’s you, I need her to sign a waiver.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio closed her mouth and nodded. “Yes, Lilia.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia leaned on her windowsill. “You deserve some happiness kid, but I can’t have you disappearing on me before this big role.” She pointed a finger at her. “It’s a big opportunity for both of us. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio closed her car door as she slipped her phone from her bag, her lips ticking up at the message.</span>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: got any chapters written? Today was a rough day and I could really use some escapism in my life. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s finger’s stroked at her phone in thought. She needed to guide them away from the story idea, and she was finding that there was a budding curiosity about Agatha’s life under it all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: What happened?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched as the dots appeared then stopped, her eyes looking for their appearance, and right before she sent another message they started up again.</span>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: You sure you want the real story? We could just talk about all the dirty things we want to do to Rio Goddess Vidal instead? ;)</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes drifted to the passenger seat in her car. It had been a long time since she had had a heart-to-heart with another human being, even Lilia. Her eyes relocated to her phone and she started typing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I mean we can do that as well – but I wouldn’t mind hearing about your day, we’re online friends, right?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She waited while she let Agatha contemplate digging up her story, and her body relaxed when the woman started to type again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Moral of the story is don’t trust beautiful women in power. My… now ex… wife, really took me for a ride. Left me with a son she refuses to claim, a divorce I can’t afford, and moving back in with my mother who views me as the devil’s incarnate. If it weren’t for Nicky I am sure I would be living on the street somewhere, starving to death, or dying of hypothermia.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest constricted a bit, even though she told herself this was just some online person she was never going to meet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: damn. I’m sorry. What is it you do for a living, if you don’t mind me asking?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The dots seemed to dance as Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I’m a washed-up theater kid, double majored in theater and scriptwriting, however, there’s not much of that going around in my little backwoods Illinois town. Don’t have the experience either as my wife snatched me up right after graduation. She wanted a housewife so that is what I became. I lived in a big city in her penthouse until six months ago. Never thought she would leave me, but honestly, I should have seen it coming, the writing was on the wall.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha continued to write.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: It’s impossible trying to explain things to Nicky, where his mother went. She decided since we used my genetic material that in the end he was my problem. He deserves so much more than her.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt tears begin to collect in the corners of her eyes, this was worse than those fans that told you how some small part you played saved their lives. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: To answer your question I work at a hardware store in town. It’s not glamorous and I barely make any money after I scrape together healthcare and food for Nicky, but it’s something.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: See why I need your story now?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio deflated, she took a deep breath and blew it out slowly. Agatha was going through it, if a small story about a character she had played could make things even a little better for her, who was she to not deliver. </span>

  <span>Chapter 4</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio flopped onto her bed after a long day of interviews and trying to schmooze executives that wanted into her pants. She had hoped Sharon would be at one of the events, but that woman rarely went to these things, she should have never hoped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She flipped over to her back and stared at the ceiling. Being an actor was exhilarating and thrilling at the best of times, and fucking lonely and suffocatingly boring at the worst of times. Rio needed to find a project soon or she was going to go crazy. Ruffland licked at her foot and she jolted out of her head. “Bro…” She lifted her head and looked down her body at her gimpy-looking border collie, husky mix, the man was one big fluff ball. “I know… you like me being home all the time, but wouldn’t you rather go back and see your buddies? Have pack walkies? Hm?” She flopped back and had the wind knocked out of her when her dog tackled her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ow…” her voice whistled out. She caught her breath and smiled. “At least I have you.” The dog turned and jumped from the bed, retrieving his red toy. Rio’s eyes narrowed. “You just wanted a snack?” She sat up taking the toy with an exaggerated eye roll. “I’m glad this is true love for you.” The dog bounced happily by her side as she wandered to her little kitchen to fill the container with cheese and a few bones. Giving it to Ruffland he took it to his big fluffy bed and left her alone. She rolled her eyes. She had gotten him for depression, and honestly, he was good for that, she had even had him professionally trained so that he could be a service dog but she didn’t need him much outside of the house, just within her four walls when her mind would swallow her whole.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She walked over to her black and white pup and ruffled his hair, he didn’t even falter from his snack. She leaned forward and kissed him when her phone pinged. Her mind hoping it wasn’t Lilia deciding she needed another lecture. She stood carefully her knee cracking, as it had done since she was thirteen. She wandered back to her room and saw that Agatha had written her again. She was feeling a bit emotionally raw from the last time they chatted but she picked up her phone anyways, because what if the woman needed her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sat on her bed and opened the message, her eyes went wide.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: wanna play a game tonight?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio licked her lips and looked towards her door, she should probably close that in case this was going where she thought it was going. Her fluffy child didn’t need to see her on all fours fingering herself to the woman on her screen. She stood and shut the door, locking it, because one of Ruffland’s stupid tasks was opening doors. Mainly so she couldn’t shut him out in a depressive episode.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She returned to her phone and took her cotton shirt off as she got comfortable, Leaving her lace bralette and her jeans firmly in place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: A game? Do tell.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes scanned the phone as Agatha sent her a photo. Her body was covered by a dark silk robe, one that ended at her upper thighs, barely covering her panties… if she was even wearing any. Rio let out a low whistle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Well, shit. I didn’t know a robe could make me think such dirty thoughts, Harkness.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio unbuttoned her pants and unzipped her jeans when the next image came through. Her teeth tugged at her bottom lip at the sight of Agatha slipping the robe off of one shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I just got word that Miss Vidal herself saw my tweet. I’m freaking out, and so horney. Maybe… you could help me with that?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t think too hard before she messaged back, cringing at her words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: the studio contacted you?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well shit. She sat up, her hand pressing to her chest, this had been why Lilia was worried because she knew that Rio was an idiot, a teenager at heart. She closed her eyes and took a steading breath. There was no way Agatha would think it was really her, certainly plenty of people knew how these things worked in Hollywood – didn’t they?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes opened as a ping echoed in her room, her breath caught in her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: yeah, isn’t that crazy? Omg. Was it too cringy? It was cringy wasn’t it…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s fingers typed quickly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: it was… sweet. Really. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She cursed under her breath and added on quickly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I’m sure she at least was flattered.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She tried to run her hand through her hair when her hand caught in her ponytail. Of course, she had forgotten to take her hair tie out, the little traitor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Well she’s certainly out of my league, but… I remembered there was someone else who seemed to think my aging body might be worth a look…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s face fell. Agatha really didn’t know what she looked like, maybe she had been told she was aging too quickly by her ex. Maybe… her ex had left her for a younger woman.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: She didn’t deserve you.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes looked over her message, wondering if Agatha would divine the correct meaning given the conversation, but she shouldn’t have worried.</span>
</p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: well, she certainly thought she upgraded with that blond bimbo from New York… </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I don’t want to talk about her tonight… Just fucking Rio Vidal… and maybe… you?</span>
  </em>
</p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I’m game with anything that includes you… losing some clothing.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted when Agatha sent back a devil face emoji.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: What is it that you would like to see?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio practically groaned, talking to herself out loud. “If I asked you to take it all off, would you?” Another message quieted her thoughts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Do you think Rio likes to fuck women over couches or tables?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit down on her hand. This woman was going to be the end of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Hm, she seems freaky. What if she wanted you to bend her over your couch? Do you think you would oblige?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes bugged out of her head when she saw a voice message, followed by an image of what she assumed was taken by Agatha’s own hand, if the neck, naked breasts and toned stomach, followed by the cut off at her hip bones was anything to go by. </span>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took a moment to rip her pants from her body as she leaned back against her pillows. Damn, and she didn’t even have to drop the famous card for any of this. She felt her chest flutter, honestly, that was a huge fucking relief. She clicked play then closed her eyes, Agatha’s voice was better than anything she had come up with in her head. It was deep but not too deep and slightly raspy, with the hint of a childhood lisp that was never completely corrected. But damn it all worked for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would most definitely bend Rio Vidal over my couch and fuck her raw…” She snorted, and Rio’s heart fucking melted. This girl was just her type. Sexy, dominant, … dorky, and she prayed a bit awkward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know…” Agatha's voice cleared, “If I could ever get over the sheer shock of her winding up in my living room…” Her voice trailed off sadly. “In… my mom’s living room…” She cleared her throat before she ended the memo.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes looked up at two more photos she hadn’t seen come through. One of Agatha’s chest in the air, and one she had no idea how the woman had taken of her ass – crotch pressing into her white sheets.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled at her phone, her panties already wet without her even touching herself. Her fingers typed wildly. So uncoordinated that she had to correct a few mistakes in her words.</span>
</p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Damn, Agatha. If only she was so lucky.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stood on shaky legs as she moved to her bathroom, turning on her camera app and snapping a picture of her outfit, shoulders down of course, her tattoos luckily on her neck behind her ear and her arm which were out of shot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She saw Agatha’s dots disappear and she snickered. Her hands landed on her sink, her hips rocking forward at the image of Agatha bending her over her couch. She sighed. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked down and saw that it had been a few minutes and Agatha had finally written her again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: You heard me, now let me hear you.</span>
  </em>
</p><p><br />
<span>Rio’s breathing stopped. Should she send a clip of her breathing? She froze. Her hands coming to cover up her chest, her dark eyes – pupils wide, gazing back at her in the mirror. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This </span>
  </em>
  <span>is what Lilia was afraid of. She clenched her thighs at the wetness that had pooled there, her lace thong now sticking to her uncomfortably. She flipped her phone over and leaned back against her wall, her fingers reaching into herself – and fucking herself into oblivion.</span>

  <h1 align="center">Chapter 5</h1><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her heartbeat slow down, RioVidalsWhore69 hadn’t responded again. At first she smiled thinking it was only due to the fact that the other woman had gotten off, but as the moments stretched on, she felt the crushing reality that the woman had ghosted her. She sat up slowly, her phone still clenched in her hand, her hair draped over her shoulder. Why did no one want her like she wanted them?</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes shot to the door as she reached for a blanket to cover herself with, a key turning in the latch. The bright blue eyes of her son looked at her a moment later in confusion, as her mother glared from behind him.</p><p> </p><p>“Mommy… why are you naked?” He proceeded to run and jump up on her pull out couch bed. Because of course Agatha got the basement couch while Nicky got a room, it’s not like they couldn’t share but Evanora was pissed that Agatha was once again being a burden.</p><p>Agatha pulled on her robe under her mother’s scrutiny. “I was just about to take a shower, Nicky.” She moved to run thin fingers through his chin length hair. She loved how soft it was. Her mother tutting from the background as if she knew its length brought her joy.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora sneered from the doorway. “Nicky has a haircut scheduled for tomorrow. You’ve really let your child rearing go, Agatha, you’re lucky I’m still around to take care of things for you.” It was said as if she were incompetent.</p><p>Agatha wanted to argue that she hadn’t left her wife; it had been the other way around, but she swallowed her pride as she pulled Nicky into her lap for support. “Thank you, mother.” Her voice was quiet. Nicky giggled as her breath tickled his ear. She felt like every day they stayed here her son slipped a little further away, as if one day she might wake up and he would be gone, leaving her here all alone with her mother. Thank god her mother didn’t have the funds to send him away to boarding school because to get back at Agatha she totally would.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky leaned back and kissed his mama’s cheek. She could tell he wanted to ask more questions but knew that Agatha was generally reserved around her own mother. He instead snuggled tighter to her. Evanora blanched at the open affection.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky, don’t smother your mother, you’re a big boy now. It’s time for bed.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky pouted, turning to his mom. “I wanna stay with momma tonight, we can have a sleepover.” He turned big eyes on her as Agatha felt the anger radiating off of her own mother. She took her hands and cupped Nicky’s face. “Baby, I would love that, but perhaps not tonight, you do need your sleep. You had,” She looked at her mother briefly, “A big day with grandma.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky sighed and crossed his little arms, Evanora slapping her thighs. “Agatha, this is on you for raising him wrong. He really is such a sweet child, your wickedness is corrupting him.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to cry as her mother moved to pick Nicky up, the boy old enough that he could surely walk, and she wasn't quite sure how her mother managed it. Her eyes watering as she tried to keep her voice steady. “Good night, Nicky, I love you…” She watched as he was dragged from her sight and she gripped at her chest at the invisible pain. Why was sorrow the only thing that followed her? Growing up with her mother had been a nightmare, then all her failed relationships one after the other. Her failed body and how her wife grew angrier and angrier after each infertility treatment. She covered her mouth as a sob escaped. She didn’t want there to be any chance that Nicky might hear her.</p><p> </p><p>Her hang moved back to her phone and she looked to see if her new online friend had responded, she hadn’t. She closed her eyes as her tears fell down her face and she tried very hard to believe that the woman had just passed out after getting off. She curled onto her side on the uncomfortable bed and wept, her hands itching to type again. And though she knew her friend probably wouldn’t care, she decided to spill her secrets anyway.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>
  <em> @downyourroad: I know you’re probably asleep… but I… I just needed to tell someone this, and who better than my online friend that I’ll never meet. Ever since I moved home to my mother's, she's started a campaign to poison my son against me. I feel powerless to stop her, because of her, he has a roof over his head. My job won’t pay for a place for us, it won’t even cover my lawyers fees for my divorce. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She sniffed as her nose started running.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> @downyourroad: Sometimes… a lot of the time, I just want to disappear. Nicky would probably be better off without me, but I can’t let my mother raise him, she can be absolutely horrible. And his other mother… well I told you she moved on from us. I wish I could give Nicky the life and family he deserves.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She curled even tighter into a ball.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>
  <em> @downyourroad: thanks for… the fun tonight. I needed that. Good night.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She set her phone aside knowing no one was coming for her and fell into a fitful sleep. Somewhere in the night she woke to her arms around Nicky, the boy having snuck into the cold basement to be with her. She pressed her face into his hair. She wondered how long he would still love her for before he too decided she just wasn’t worth loving.</p><p> </p>

  <span>Chapter 6</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes blinked open and she stretched, letting her arms flop to the side as she took in the time on her clock. 8AM. She smirked as the images of Agatha came to mind, she rolled over and cuddled her pillow before her eyes shot open. She had been having a good time with Agatha, a very good time. All until the woman had asked for an audio clip from her and she had run like a coward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sat up and face planted into her pillow, letting out a feral yell. Why did she do that? Now that she was fully awake, she one hundred percent knew she could have just sent the woman a quick clip of her breathing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stupid… stupid… stupid.” She mumbled. She turned her head just as she finished her tantrum to look for her phone, she found it on the nightstand face down. She set her chin in her hand as she contemplated how long she wanted to torture herself before seeing what Agatha had written her when she left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before she could reach for her phone Ruffland was thundering across the house, sensing that she was awake. The thirty five pound body was yeeted at her in the blink of an eye. She yelled as she tried to dive under the covers, knowing a kiss attack was coming. Her dog, trying hard to find his way into her covers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No! No! Not yet!” She laughed as she tried in vain to outmaneuver him, eventually she lost. She gave up her struggle at the first lick, letting go of the struggle as she blew fallen hair from her face. “I swear your breakfast time is eight thirty, why are you bothering me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The dog booped her in the hand multiple times with his stupid grin and she rolled her eyes. “Fine, but just this once.” She threw off the sheets and her son went running for the kitchen to wait at his bowl. She shook her head and finally reached for her phone, feeling nauseous a moment later. Agatha had written her multiple times, including an extra message early this morning, just a few hours ago.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I’m sorry I asked to hear your voice. I shouldn’t have done that, we barely know each other. I made a decision to share mine and I’m sorry to have put pressure on you, and for… oversharing. I can do better. - Agatha</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pursed her lips, her head falling backwards. If she had been a normal person, she would have never ghosted Agatha last night. She chucked her phone at her pillow, frustrated. She had flirted with fans sparingly in the past, it never went well. She tried to stamp down the urge to explain herself. Lilia wouldn’t be happy, and she knew better than to think the conversation would go anywhere good. She sighed. Agatha had a new photo of her… she wondered how long it would be before she saw that one end up online too. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stood, moved to her dresser, and threw on a long t-shirt. She almost left the room, but then she hesitated, like she felt that if she left her phone behind it was just as good as leaving Agatha to rot. She took a step towards her phone when it went off. Another message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I guess I scared you off. Thanks for talking with me for a while. I hope your story about Rio’s character goes well – I’ll keep an eye out for it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio deflated, she shouldn’t talk to her anymore, she knew she shouldn’t, but she had always been a sap for a beautiful woman. Her exes had done a number on her, and yet when she found someone she was interested in, she really threw herself into it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She opened her message on the app while she walked to the kitchen, nearly killing herself on one of her dog’s toys. She made it to the fridge and before pulling out her dog's food, sent a message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Morning Beautiful. I would say ‘I hope you slept well’ but I already know the answer. I had a good time last night, if you couldn’t tell by my absence. You’re absolutely breathtaking. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned and leaned her ass against the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I must admit, I did get a bit nervous from your request, but not for any of the reasons you think.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved to set her phone down then wrote one more thing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I would really love the chance to explain things to you, if I haven’t messed things up already. I’m coming to Chicago soon. I know you don’t live super close to the city from what you told me, but I would love to meet up. Maybe you could come to the city for the weekend? My treat? </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now Rio locked her phone and moved to get her dog's food. She needed to calm her nerves. They were already skyrocketing, why was she the one in charge of her? Someone needed to watch her at all times.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was sitting at the kitchen table, her porridge so runny it was sliding off her spoon. Her mother told her she was getting fat and no man would ever want her. She rolled her eyes, her mother knew she was gay since Agatha was thirteen, when she had caught her and Jennifer Kale making out in the woods – how her mother had found her there, she would never know. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stirred at the sludge, wishing for Nicky to ramble on, but the kid was sent away to a church retreat this morning, something she had definitely not okayed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had wanted to go retrieve him, but she knew she had to be at work in an hour. Her mind drifted to a dark place she would rather go to. Her phone buzzed and her mother growled from the stove. “Agatha, are you listening to me? It’s important we get Nicky into a good christian school, lord knows you almost lost his soul…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes shot down to her phone, defeated but then when her eyes widened. “I… I need to get ready for work.” She moved quickly to retreat from the room, leaving her food behind. Her eyes not wanting to stray from the message alerts, in case they were a fever dream.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved down the stairs quickly, nearly tripping, making it to her door then quickly locking it behind her. Her online friend didn’t leave her, never to return again. Her heart fluttered. Her eyes devoured every word again and again. This woman, with an incredibly hot body, wanted to see her. She felt her skin buzz with the promise of something new, when her mind tried to squash any and all hope. There was no way this woman was serious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha started to pace her room, maybe this woman was a serial killer… things like that still happened, didn’t they? She scrolled up in their messages and found the photo of her body again, how did she know for sure that was this person’s body? Or that she really was a woman. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She scratched at the back of her neck as she let out a breath she was holding. Did she even want to go to Chicago? Was it worth the risk?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She walked into her bathroom and splashed some water on her face, patting it dry with a raggedy old towel. Her blue eyes were red under the fluorescent lighting. She gripped the sink tightly, letting her head dip down. She needed to be better for Nicky, maybe that started with her trying to shock her system with a trip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked over her shoulder at the phone on her bed and she went to pick it up with careful fingers, rolling her fingers down as she enclosed them around the phone. Rio had messaged her again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Did I scare you off now?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled as she began to type. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I don’t know why you want to see me, but… if you’re serious, I could meet you in the city. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had to swallow her pride. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I was serious about not having any money though, I know it’s awkward.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes took in the new message as it appeared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I make a decent living, don't worry about it. Just shoot me your venmo when you get a chance and I’ll send you the money – if you don’t mind booking it all?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit her lip. She wasn’t sure how she was going to explain her sudden trip to her mother, but she would come up with something, even if she had to tap into her useless degree to make up a believable tale.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Gods she owed so much money in student loans. She cringed. It was only a matter of time before her ex realized that she was still paying for them and cut off those funds too. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Sure, I… I can manage that. It’s Harkness73.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She blanched a bit at the number, wondering if her friend would realize her age and rethink their meeting, but the next moment her phone beeped. A boy named Billy had sent her $600 for </span>
  <em>
    <span>hotel reservation.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth went dry. Billy… was that her friend's name? Shit. </span>
</p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I had my intern send you the money. I'm good with anywhere decently central. I’ll have my card with me in case there’s something you want to do over the weekend. I’m just excited to meet you in person.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit the tip of her tongue, what was she getting herself into?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Is this… like a pretty woman situation? What do you even do? I thought people in our fandom didn’t have money?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her blue eyes watched as her friend struggled to land on a response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I wish, but I don’t make enough for that kind of thing, but I do have enough to show you a good time, without all the designer gifts. I hope that’s okay. And I’m in entertainment, I make an okay living. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She hummed as she sat on her bed. She didn’t need a sugar momma, she had had one before and she knew how that went, with her used and abused. She figured her friend seemed low key enough that it might be a fun weekend, if she was careful. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha accepted the money and instantly started looking up hotels, wondering if there was anything left over if she could get a small gift for Nicky, when her app for cash beeped again. Billy had sent her two hundred dollars titled </span>
  <em>
    <span>for Nicky</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Agatha placed her hand over her mouth and reached for her bed to settle herself in before she couldn’t see anymore. What the hell was happening?</span>
</p>

  <span>Chapter 7</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio whistled as she and Ruffland walked up the long drive to Lilia’s cottage in the hills. Lilia had said to come out back for their dogs to get started on their play date while they talked shop. She took the side gate into the yard and gave Ruffland his cue. “Go Play, Ruff.” The dog took off without a second thought. She placed her hands in her pockets as she went looking for Lilia, the woman just inside through the kitchen window. Rio entered the open back door. “Can I help you with anything?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia smiled at her, “Just grab us each a drink and I think these chicken kabobs will be just seasoned enough to eat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio ducked past Lilia and found her way into the fridge, grabbing them each some fruity health drink and followed Lilia as she went to sit under her gazebo. Rio set the drinks down and settled at the edge of her plush garden seat as she spread her legs and leaned on her elbows. Lilia rolling her eyes at her nervous tell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Out with it.” Lilia motioned with her hand as if she could conjure the girl to speak, and the scary thing was, she usually could.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged her mind trying desperately to remain blank. “I’m fine…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia snorted her gaze looking off at the dogs then back into Rio’s face. “Sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio clapped her hands together before they tilted up to the sky for divine guidance, already feeling like she had done something stupid. “So… I invited her to meet me in Chicago.” Her eyes that avoided Lilia when she made the admission now drifted to see the damage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia was calm but her gaze was sharp. “Okay. Have you explained your NDA to her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes. “I haven’t… told her it’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>me </span>
  </em>
  <span>yet.” Lilia sighed and Rio jumped in to defend herself. “I thought it would be better to tell her in person!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia grabbed her drink and opened it, taking a sip. “When has that </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever</span>
  </em>
  <span> worked out for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio crossed her arms trying to remember how she had felt leading up to asking Agatha to meet, and tried to forget her track record with doing anything similar. “I don’t want to freak her out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia leaned back in her chair. “She’s going to find out, kiddo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>RIo glanced at the ground, annoyed, grumbling. “I know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you?” Lilia leaned forward to tap at Rio’s leg. “Look, baby, I’m sure she’s a nice girl, but no one likes being lied to. You should tell her now…” At Rio’s hesitance she let her eyes flutter shut. “She have anything on you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rubbed at the back of her neck. “Not really. A single photo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia inclined her head as she filled in the gaps in her head. “A naked photo?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, her eyes wide. “No! Just… lingerie, no face. It was tasteful, yet … suggestive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia hummed as she relaxed. “Well take the NDA with you if she shows.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up, her brows furrowing, skeptical. “That’s all?” Normally Lilia would give her a lecture about her choices and remind her of the past, but today she didn’t do any of that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked around the yard, it wasn’t like Lilia to let things go this quickly. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia smirked. “I have a meeting with Sharon on Friday, while you’re at the convention in the morning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio seemed to perk up as she sat forward more. “Lilia…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The older woman raised her hand. “It’s nothing for sure, Rio, but she was determined to meet with me before the month is over. Even if it’s not this project, it’s good for you and my other clients if her and me are speaking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded her hands worrying in her lap. “I hate being the last to know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia patted her hand as the two dogs came running by. “I know, but we’ll get through it, we always do.”</span>

  <span>Chapter 8</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had taken Nicky out for ice cream and now he laid in her bed with her watching a movie on her computer. Her eyes staring forward without really absorbing what was happening on the screen, her hands running through Nicky’s now shorter hair. Her mind had been running like crazy ever since she took the money. She had found a decent four star hotel in her budget and saved a bit of money for gas. Hopeful that her old car would get her there any back, and that they would even let her stay at the hotel with the old piece of metal, the paint had been chipping since her divorce, which was just perfect timing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her lawyer texted her again, outlining her fees, but Agatha ignored the message, her account was low since the last payment and she figured she was going to need to give up her suit soon. She texted her online friend the information about the hotel and waited for a response. Her eyes drifted back aimlessly to her computer where her son continued to watch his show. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t fight the way her face lit up when she got a message. </span>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Sounds great. Can’t wait to see you. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit down on the end of her thumb. The trip was next week and she still was missing the most important piece of information. Her friend’s name, she couldn’t very well call her RioVidalsWhore69 to her face. She pondered how to bring up the topic when she saw another message incoming. </span>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: So I do need to talk to you about something. Let me know when you have a moment?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha patted at Nicky’s back as she moved off the bed and into her bathroom, shutting and locking the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Alright, I am alone. What did you need to discuss with me?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned on the water in the shower to try and relax, she had hoped the sound of water would be soothing, but she found it continued to heighten her anxiety instead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Well, this is a bit awkward, and I need you to keep an open mind as to why I didn’t tell you sooner.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat down on her closed toilet seat, her heart thundering. She waited, hoping this mystery woman would put her out of her misery. She hated surprises. When her ex wife had popped the question she had burst out crying not from joy but from unexpected panic – that alone should have clued her into something wasn’t right. Her eyes moved back to the screen as her phone pinged with another message. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I wanted to tell you in person but my agent told me I should do it now. So… you know how I said some stuff about Rio Vidal’s preferences? I might have known a bit more than I let on….</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s blue eyes narrowed. How could she know about the woman’s sexual preferences? Had she hooked up with her before? That would be wild. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lucky bitch.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Okay this is like really hard to say, uhm</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's body tensed. What could be that hard to explain? Was she married? Agatha bit her tongue in frustration. Of course she would be talking to someone that was fucking unavailable, she just had an energy about her that screamed come fuck me over, it’s my kink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: would you just spit it out?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She held her breath as the next message appeared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I am Rio. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Vidal.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes scanned the message over and over again, waiting for the punchline. But her friend remained silent. Her eyes filled with angry tears. She scoffed as she felt her anger rising. Who did this woman think she was?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: No, you’re not.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned as she heard the springs in her bed shift as Nicky moved around. She turned her phone on silent and she bared her teeth when the stupid thing vibrated. She wanted to chuck it at the wall but she knew she definitely didn’t have the money to buy a new phone and this one needed to stretch it’s life to its fullest potential. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: while I understand the reaction, like I do get it, it must be very confusing and a bit wild, but I can assure you, that’s the name I was born with.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. What did this woman take her for? An idiot, that’s what this person thought of her. Just because she spent her time soothing her shitty life with expertly woven tales didn’t mean she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>naïve and stupid. This sounded like a terrible fan fiction story – perhaps this was the plot of the one her friend was writing and this was her work shopping if people would actually be interested in reading it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: so you're a con woman. What did I even get myself into? You have some nerve, I am so not drawing anything for you now.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her online buddy tried again. Attempting to double down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I can prove it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed. She didn’t need this. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Save it. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I could send you that voice memo? Or… another photo in the same underwear set that has my face in it? Or… I don’t do live videos but if that would ease your mind we could… or hop on a call?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha locked her phone and did end up chucking it into the shower curtains. Nicky arrived at the door, knocking urgently when he heard the commotion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mom? Mom, are you okay in there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to breathe through her nose. “I’m fine, Nicky, just give me a moment.” She heard her son hesitate, hovering near the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She knew nothing good could happen to her. She snorted at the cash sitting in her bank account, well it was too bad the woman had sent it to her, she was keeping it. Maybe one day Agatha Harkness would learn to not be so god damned gullible. When she finally calmed down, she opened the door to find Nicky passed out on the bed, she curled around his small body, pressing her face into his hair. She was never ever going to try and do something for herself again. She was done trying.</span>

  <span>Chapter 9</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Rio groaned, it had been days since Agatha had responded to her. Every message she sent continued to be read but there never was a response. Rio bit the inside of her cheek hard, tasting blood. Why were women like this? Why was she like this with women? Why couldn’t she be normal?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She facepalmed her phone and cursed at the pain, okay she was so not doing </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked around her room, what could she do to get Agatha to believe her… She felt her phone vibrate and was disappointed to see that it was just a text from Lilia, letting her know her interview was dropping tomorrow. She sighed, locking her phone before her eyes slid slowly back to the black brick. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wait.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The Thirst Posts Interview.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She scrambled for the link. She could send that! She could tell Agatha something she had said in the interview, that literally next to no one would even know about. She opened her messages with the woman and sent the link.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: The interview I did with your Thirst Post, it drops tomorrow.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to rack her brain for a bit of hidden information. What had she responded with to Agatha’s post? She closed her eyes and started to flip through her memories as best as she could. Agatha had said she had wanted Rio to bend her over her couch… and Rio herself had said…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Why don’t you bend ME over your couch and we see where the night takes us, Miss Harkness.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That was it! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: remember how I said in our conversation, ‘what if Rio wanted you to bend HER over your couch’? I said that in the interview! That I wanted you to bend ME over your couch. It drops tomorrow at 11AM, just… watch it, please?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She saw that her message was read but there was no response. She closed her phone and grabbed her keys. She needed to hit the gym, she would text her personal trainer on the way to let him know her body needed a few ass kicking sessions before her event.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's eyes remained skeptical as she saw “Rio’s” recent message. Why couldn't she just block her? It was beyond her understanding. She sat in the bathroom stall at the hardware store, hiding during her shift. She had asked for the next Friday off, and she had debated if she was still going. She had the room all paid for, it would be stupid to waste it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But on the other hand, it would be stupid to go, now that her stalker knew exactly where she would be. She should have just pocketed the money and run.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio Vidal’s interview was indeed coming out tomorrow morning, but anyone who followed her closely already knew it was dropping tomorrow, you didn’t have to actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>be</span>
  </em>
  <span> Rio Vidal to know that. She closed her eyes as she heard Frank, her boss, opening the lady's room door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This room is for women only, Frank.” She heard the door start to close, then not quite shut all the way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Come on, Agatha, you’ve been in there fifteen minutes, we have customers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her jaw ticked. “I can’t fucking rush my bowel movements, jack ass, it takes the time it takes. Do you want me to poop at the register? Jesus…” she heard the door click shut then as she let her body fall forward onto her legs. What was she going to do?</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had gotten up early, before her mother, and taken Nicky to the park this morning. Where the two had been running around and Agatha had been able to pretend that her life wasn’t a huge pile of shit. They played make believe and Agatha tapped into her acting skills, her son giggling at her antics.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Momma, use your purple!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved her hands in a swirling motion before pretending to throw blasts at her son as he shrieked ducking down across a rickety bridge. Just as she was going to begin her monologue against her prince, her phone alarm sounded, her nerves getting the best of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nicky…Nicky, come down here. We need to go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her son’s eyes narrowed in thought as he contemplated arguing. His eyes zeroed in on something as he sighed and walked back down the playset to her. Her eyes wide in shock. Her son rolled his eyes and grabbed her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your hands are shaking.” He started to pull her along on the walk home. “You didn’t tell me you didn’t feel well, Momma, we could have gone home earlier.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked behind her at the park. They had been having a good time, did she really need to watch this interview and see if the response the woman had told her was true? After all, this woman could have been someone from the crew that had knowledge of the interview and still wanted to use her for nefarious reasons.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky sighed loudly. “Momma, it’s fine, we can go back to the park tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned her analytical gaze on her son. “I’m not sick, Nicholas.” She never used his full name, that was reserved for his other mother, a woman who was always far too hard on him. Nicky’s eyes pierced right through her when he looked up, assuring her there was nowhere to hide from this conversation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your mind is sick. I know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her eyes drop to the ground to watch where she was going. After a few steps she tried to reach out. “Nicky. You don’t need to worry about me…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy grunted, it sounded very much like when she was being indignant, he was </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span> her son. “I’ve seen the pills you keep in your bag. I looked them up. Your brain is bad.” He added the last part with the simplicity of a child.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt like she was indeed going to be sick now. She felt the moment Nicky went to drop her hand, and she held on tight. His eyes didn’t return to her, but his hand gripped hers back as well. They walked home in silence, and as they arrived at her mother’s home, she saw the old woman planting some flowers. Ones that aided in warding off evil, all along the front yard. That had to do with her presence no doubt. She sighed as she lightly encouraged Nicky forward. “Go help your grandmother, I have to go check on something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky turned his little eyes to her. “Is it about…” his voice dipped low. “About mommy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took an unconscious step back. “No, Nicky. It’s… not about her.” She waited for more questions but her son nodded as he let her hand fall and he wandered off, like she had asked. She watched him go and when she saw him start to assist his grandmother in the garden bed, she retreated to the basement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took off her dark jacket and placed it on the hook by her door, her hands rubbing quickly to heat themselves up before she turned on the space heater for warmth. She pulled out her laptop and clicked on the link she had saved from her online friend… well ex-friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched as a countdown initiated for the premier of the video, she had made it back just in time. As the screen dimmed, it was just as quickly replaced with Rio’s smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey, I’m Rio Vidal, and this is </span><em><span>You’re Talking to Rio Vidal.</span></em> <em><span>Really</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, okay this was a bit on the nose. She watched as posts were brought up and she felt a bit self conscious with the fact that hers was coming. She didn’t know how actors watched themselves in playback, because she was wanting to crawl out of her skin waiting to hear some words she had thoughtlessly typed and sent out for the whole internet to see.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched as Rio’s signature charm came forward as she had fun, enjoying the game she was playing with these posts. Finally, Agatha’s post came up and she felt her breath catch as Rio began to read.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness, @downyourroad: Fuckkkk. Miss Vidal! I want to remain respectful, but how can I when you look like THAT? I don’t want to sound too crazy, but gods, bend me over my couch and spank me already.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes didn’t lift as she poked her tongue into her cheek in thought. Her mouth lost its filter. “Why don’t you bend </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span> over your couch and we see where the night takes us, Miss Harkness.” Her eyebrow raised expertly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart stopped. What had the mystery woman said exactly? She flipped back to the messages and read the words line for line. Her eyes flashing between her phone and the computer quite a few times. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>There was no fucking way.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s phone lit up with a message. She had been trying to occupy her mind since watching the interview. Trouble was all she did was find a whole bunch of mediocre fanfiction stories online and none of them were doing it for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pouted, why was this woman trying so hard to talk to her? Why create this elaborate scheme when Agatha had already enjoyed talking to her? As well as agreeing to meet her in Chicago…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She picked up her phone, resigned to having a conversation with the woman finally.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: So… did you watch it yet? It’s out.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her eyes drift to her laptop. She had watched it twice actually.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Is this about me lying to you? Because that’s fair. I just… I can’t really go around, like, announcing myself all of the time. That doesn’t go well for me… well, apparently, neither did this.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bright blue eyes scanned the message, looking for hidden meanings, when she came up empty, she started to finally compose a message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: You expect me to believe you, after the fact that there were probably at least 20 people working on that set? You could be anyone.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She practically felt the charged energy between her and the other woman waft through her screen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: There were only seven, actually. Me, Vic, the camera guy, hair, makeup, the DP, and Vic’s intern. It was a small production, just like I prefer.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed, this woman was laying it on thick with the details.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: Nevertheless, this is an elaborate joke. What do you get out of it at the end of the day? My suffering? I’ve told you my life is hell and… well I know no one cares, but I thought I at least held some value in my photos.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt her stomach drop. What value? She was aging, her ex-wife didn’t want her either.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The response was slow this time as the woman seemed to have a lot to say.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Agatha, I’m not trying to do something terrible. I just really enjoy spending time with you on here and I thought that maybe… we might hit it off in real life. I’m in Chicago for a convention. Look it up – I go on Friday morning, then I am free the rest of the weekend. Did you… want me to use a code word in the panel? I know plenty of fans will be recording and uploading it right after. Would that ease your mind?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes darted away from her phone. What could the woman even say that wouldn’t be used in conversation. As if on cue – fake Rio had a suggestion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: How about Te Veo?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes glanced over the Spanish. She had taken a brief course at one point, but she certainly didn’t remember what the two words meant. Language wasn’t her strong suit, she only remembered a few phrases at best. Her mood slipped easily into her words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: What the hell does that even mean?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She saw the bubbles appear then disappear, but only for a moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: It’s a bit hard to explain, languages function a bit differently from each other. I’m bilingual since I’m part Puerto Rican, but essentially… It means I see you. But it’s deeper than just the physical. It’s like I see your soul, that sort of thing.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart hurt. Why would this woman suggest such a phrase?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I’ll use it, you’ll see. Will you come to the city? Just in case I do?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha wared with herself. Not only did she not want to be disappointed, but she also was becoming increasingly terrified that maybe the woman on the other end of this conversation might be exactly who she said she was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I’ll consider it. </span>
  </em>

  <span>Chapter 10</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha held Nicky close as she tried not to cry. “Momma’s just going on a short trip, baby, I’ll be right back.” Her son gripped her tighter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked up at her with the biggest smile. “I hope you get the job, Momma, but it’s okay if you don’t. Just do your best.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha couldn’t quite speak around the lump in her throat, so she nodded and leaned down to kiss him once more. Agatha had never really been away from Nicky before, more than a few hours for work. “Be good for grandma.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky reached up and bopped her on the nose. “For good luck!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha ruffled his hair as her eyes lifted to her mother’s, the woman’s arms were crossed and her face set in a hard glare. “I don’t think moving to Chicago would be the best idea for Nicolas. There’s so much sin and filth there, Agatha…” Her eyes looked her up and down in disgust. “You would know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gripped her duffle. “They sent me gas money, and a hotel reservation. Mom, I need to at least… hear them out. You never know, plus, I can’t work at the hardware store forever…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her mother stepped forward sighing. “Agatha, you need to stop wasting your time and marry a decent man. Nicky needs a father, and then there would be no need for you to be whoring yourself out…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha growled. “No. Nicky <em>doesn’t</em> need a father, mother.” She clenched her fists. “He was born from two <em>women</em>…” The distinction mattered to her. She had been gay her whole life and she wasn’t about to give an inch to the woman who thought her feelings for the fairer sex were just a phase she would one day outgrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her mother laughed, mocking her. “Please, that woman didn’t give you any sperm, you used a donor. I saw your divorce paperwork…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed. “I thought you said my marriage didn’t exist?” Her mother had said that, she had said more than that actually. She had called Tori horrible things but none of those words were as bad as the ones she had called Agatha in private. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanora rolled her eyes. “In the eyes of God, Agatha.” As if her daughter should realize the world of man was full of lies and sin and that the true word could only be found in an old dusty book, written by uneducated men. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened the door as her mother ground out a last minute attempt to make her daughter rethink her quest. “You should just leave Nicky with me if you move, he deserves so much more than you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her vision blurred. She didn’t remember leaving and she didn’t stop moving until she got in her car and locked the doors. The worst thing was that she believed her mother was right. That Nicky did deserve so much better than her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sipped at an energy drink as she waited to go on stage. Her eyes flicking around at the commotion behind the curtains. She was in a single panel this morning, it was just thirty minutes with her and the fans, answering questions. She took another sip and checked her phone again. She had no idea if Agatha had made it to the city, she had been buzzing with energy ever since she got on the plane for her red-eye this morning. She was trying to be hopeful that she wouldn’t be stood up, cause that would just </span>
  <em>
    <span>suck</span>
  </em>
  <span>.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She closed her eyes and tried to breathe. It would be fine, either she would meet Agatha after this, or she wouldn’t. She would be okay, wouldn’t she? Her eyes opened as she heard her name announced. Would they keep talking even if Agatha didn’t come to the city?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt her heart rate pick up, she needed to remember to say her special phrase or she knew there would be no chance of meeting Agatha later. The problem was, she hadn’t exactly planned out when she could say it. She felt the production assistant tap her arm and she nodded, moving through the curtains and under the unforgiving lights.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She smiled, feeling out of place the moment she hit the stage. Her eyes tried to adjust as she waved, finding it hard to see the crowd. She took the offered mic and pointed at the back of house staff. “Hey, can we turn the lights down a bit,” She smiled a real smile as her request was granted. “Thank you.” She smirked as it dawned on her, and she found the perfect place to drop her code phrase. “Ah, there you are beautiful people! Te veo!” The crowd erupted into applause and Rio found a camera recording her and threw a wink into its direction, just for good measure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat in her hotel room in Chicago, feeling like a fraud. She could never afford this place on her own, not with the way her divorce was currently panning out. She sat with her bags still packed, ready to bolt. The people downstairs hadn’t given her any trouble, but she felt her cheeks burn with embarrassment anyways. As if everyone knew she hadn’t paid for this, she was being bought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sat staring at her phone, refreshing her socials, hoping that someone would post videos of Rio’s panel sometime soon. Her eyes lifted to the room phone and she contemplated ordering alcohol to calm her nerves when she remembered, it wasn’t mystery woman’s card that was on the line for this weekend should she spend more than just the room, it was hers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She jumped as she got a social media message from herself, her mouth finally finding a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha H: Hey.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She rolled her eyes, how like Nicky to steal her laptop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness: I thought Grandma didn’t want you on electronics?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She could practically hear her son giggle. He was a good boy, but he sure did have a mischievous streak and a thing for toeing the lines when it came to the rules. He was so her son. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha H: she’s asleep.</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt her shoulders loosen, if only a bit. As much as she wanted him to listen, she also loved that when it came to his grandmother’s rules, he would still break them for his mom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness: You’re being naughty, Nicky.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was swept up in her love for her son when she remembered one very important detail. One that made her chest seize briefly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness: Nicky, you’re grounded if you read my messages. There are adult conversations in there. Only talk to me on here, okay?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt her palms sweating, she really didn’t need her son having questions about what she and some person named @riovidalswhore69 were discussing. She cringed, nor did she need questions about what that particular name entailed. She blew raspberries into the air. It was too late now. She just needed to pray for divine intervention that he wouldn’t go looking too far into things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky replied with a side eye emoji. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m not snooping. I just missed you and wanted to know if you got there safely. I can go back to watching my show now if you are busy. I only have so long before Grandma wakes up.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head at her son’s attitude. It did warm her heart a bit that he had chosen to speak with her over watching his precious show, he was a little kid after all. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Well, I wouldn’t want you to miss tv time. Call me later?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes lit up at the response. Her stress melted away. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I will. Love you momma.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt tears prickle around her eyes, as they always did even after all these years with her son in her life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Love you too, Nicky.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she exited the chat she got a ping. And then another from Nicky.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Who’s RioVidalsWhore69?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She literally smacked herself in the face, of course he would see it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>A Friend, Nicolas. Don’t snoop, go watch your show.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched the chat for a tense moment, hoping this was the end of that conversation. When nothing more was said, she breathed a sigh of relief as she opened a different message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: So I am hoping something gets posted soon. I don’t see anything yet, but I’ve been done for about forty minutes. I’m… really hoping to see you today.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes darted around the room before she responded, realizing that maybe a small hotel room wasn’t the safest way to meet anyone. She wanted to kick herself for not thinking about that detail a little sooner. She was a mom, she had a son to make it home safe to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: We should meet in public.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes watching as fake Rio tried to come up with a response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: That’s going to be a bit challenging when there are hundreds of people around the city that are on the lookout for me today, knowing I’m in town. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rubbed at her stomach. Even if this woman was somehow who she said she was, the fact was, she didn’t know her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I’m a woman alone in a hotel room. I don’t know what kind of idiot you take me for, but I won’t be getting murdered so easily.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stood and walked to the door to make sure she engaged the extra latch. That would at least give her time to call for help if some big dude showed up to try and kidnap her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: look, it’s far easier to get people alone than you think. But if that is a condition… I am sure I can think of something. I was just about to head out actually. Want to grab coffee, maybe? I’ll need it to be decently far from this hotel the convention is at. Do you mind taking a cab?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her shoulders as she typed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I drove. I can take my car.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>An eye roll emoji was sent back.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Sweetheart, then I would know your license plate. I have a decent photographic memory, let’s not tempt me. I texted my friend, she has a cafe in Rogers Park, near a small university. Will that suffice? It’s public, plenty of kids around… might be bad for me, but we’ll see how long I last – you’re worth the risk. I can attempt a disguise if needed.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed. Her fingers typing slowly, reading over her words a few times before hitting send. Her mind told her to calm down, there was no way this was the real Rio Vidal, but she was about to meet somebody. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I told you I don’t have any money. I’ll have to drive.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A response was almost immediate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I’ll send a car. Be down stairs in ten. And yes, I’ll send you money for your trip back in case we don’t go together.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And just about as soon as the message was sent </span>
  <em>
    <span>Billy </span>
  </em>
  <span>was wiring her two hundred dollars. Agatha’s eyes went wide. This woman had said she didn’t make a lot, but she was sure throwing money at her as if she did.</span>

  <span>Chapter 11</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to never wear her glasses in public, they were big and she felt like a nerd about to be shoved into a locker with them on, but she wanted her eyesight to be sharp as she watched the people come and go in the café. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mystery woman had indeed sent her a car to this address. It was quiet and there were bookshelves everywhere with old and new books for sale, as well as an eclectic coffee and tea selection. She pushed her glasses higher up her nose as she watched the door open yet again, her eyes glancing down at her phone, though it hadn’t indicated any activity. She navigated to her messages and there was nothing more from fake Rio. Was she about to be stood up?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had thought about ordering, but she panicked at the last second that that might be rude. She should wait, shouldn’t she? It’s not like she should be buying herself a latte when she could spend that extra eight dollars on Nicky later. She leaned back in her plush chair, her fingers effortlessly finding the window where Rio’s panel video was still up, it had finally posted in the car on her way over. She clicked play to watch it again, jumping as her phone speakers crackled to life. Her fingers moved quickly to silence the video. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had to hand it to her mystery woman, she was good. Rio had opened this morning by saying “Te veo” nearly one minute into her appearance. She rolled her eyes, there had to be an explanation for this. Her body tensed as some kid in a dark hoodie with large sunglasses sat across from her at her little table. She grumbled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m waiting for someone.” When the person didn’t move, she let her eyes flick up from her phone. A woman with a hood pulled over her dark hair and dark glasses staring back at her, now with a smirk firmly in place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m aware.” Her face seemed to take in Agatha, pointing at her own face. “Cute glasses.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The voice was quiet but Agatha’s eyes widened. Her mouth opened just slightly before it closed, her eyes narrowing. This had to be a trick. “Come again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The person in front of her, in sweats, shook her head before pushing her hood back and lifting her glasses up onto her head, her dark eyes taking in Agatha’s blue for the first time in person. “I mean… I was trying to be discreet, but if the lady needs me to be more clear,” She took a sip of her drink without breaking eye contact. “Hey, gorgeous.” She winked as she leaned forward. “Sorry I’m late. There’s some stupid convention in town and it was a bit crazy getting out of the city center.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha froze. Her eyes were not grasping what she was seeing. Was she hallucinating?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio side-eyed her for a moment before her dark gaze drifted to the menu over at the ordering counter. “Did you want something to drink or eat? It’s a little late for brunch, but I think we can make an exception.” Her eyes drifted back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes dropped to her lap, her cheeks flaring red. She tucked some fallen hair behind her ear. Her mind tried to block out the encounter as if it were some traumatic event. She jumped when her phone buzzed her eyes looking down at a new message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: You okay? Did you want a drink or something?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes lifted to Rio, the woman looking down intently at her phone, continuing to type.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: Alice says that the cinnamon drink tastes like Christmas, but I’ve yet to try it. Do you like sweet? My drink is vanilla and loaded with sugar… you can try it if you want?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt like she might faint. She heard Rio move but didn’t register that she had left, until she came back with a bag of ice, gently taking Agatha’s wrist and placing the plastic baggie covered in brown paper towel over her veins.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This should help,” Her voice was soft, her eyes trained on Agatha’s skin, a private smirk lighting up her whole face. “I knew your skin would be soft.” Her eyes remained low, allowing Agatha to take her in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes darted down to the ice and Rio’s hand on her as she swallowed and tried to speak. “What… what are you doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio repositioned the ice and shrugged. “This is one way to fight a panic attack.” Her eyes lifted. “I don’t think drugging you would be a good way to calm you down. We’ve only just met, and I know how concerned you are about strangers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed her mouth and nodded. Her eyes flitted around the room. “T-Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “So, drink?” She took Agatha’s other hand and placed it over the bag of ice. “Just keep that on a few more minutes, until your nerves balance out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes looked at the menu, speaking as if on autopilot. “I like cinnamon.” She kept her eyes far from Rio’s, the ice helping her stay present. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded and bounded over to the barista to place the order. The woman’s eyes widening as they took her in. Rio leaned on the counter and flirted a bit before she walked away with another cup. She set it down gently in front of Agatha. “My lady.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a breath. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “So… you’re a bit… quiet in person.” She sipped more of her drink as she tilted her head. “Not what I expected from the things you said to me… nor sent me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s bit her lip, flushing. Wanting to die on the spot. “I… I’m a bit </span>
  <em>
    <span>unfiltered</span>
  </em>
  <span> online.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, her smile intrigued. “Oh, I know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took her cup and sipped the drink for something to occupy her hands with, her eyes flashing as the drink really was good.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha set the bag of ice on the table before tapping her fingers nervously on her thigh, one finger at a time in quick succession. “So…  you–you wanted to meet me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio flicked her long side bangs from her eyes. “Yeah,” she smirked. “I did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha lifted her hand to the back of her neck as she massaged at the tight muscles as her mind started to flood with a million questions, most notably – why her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes watching with interest. “I could help you with that later, if you wanted?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned her eyes on her, brows furrowed. Rio indicated her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your neck. I’m pretty good with my hands.” The moment after the words left her mouth she cleared her throat, clearly affected. “I mean… Well, both ways actually.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to slow her breathing as her heart rate jumped a bit. “I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tilted her head, contemplating Agatha’s behavior. “Did Nicky keep you up late?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth opened in shock then she let it fall closed. She shook her head slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “Is it better or worse, meeting me in public?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha indicated the cup, “I wish there was alcohol in there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, her hand coming up to cover her mouth to muffle the sound. “That can be arranged.” She looked around briefly. “You wouldn’t be trying to blow my cover, would you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was indeed aware of how unique Rio’s laughter was. She shook her head, her voice rough. “No,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned back. “Good.” Her eyes glanced at the shelves of books, taking in the titles. “So… “ Her eyes drifted slowly back to Agatha’s. “Does your hotel room have a couch?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes glanced down at her outfit, knowing all too well what lay underneath, and that there was nothing about it the woman across her would find sexy. “I didn’t… prepare,” She licked her lips. “Anything for… </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” She let her fingers tap on her coffee cup. Her eyes looked out the front windows. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck </span>
  </em>
  <span>she should have brought at least one nice set of underwear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached out and touched Agatha’s hand. “Sweetheart,” Her eyes looked her up and down as if accessing what was on display, “It’s not your clothes I’m…” her voice trailed off as her voice tried to remain steady. “Interested in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha slumped in her seat. “You’re… serious? About… with me.” She pointed at herself, her eyebrows raised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip. “Deadly serious.” She shook her head. “Sorry, bad joke.”</span>
</p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gasped as her back was slammed up against the wall. Her head thudded quickly after as Rio sucked on her neck. She pulled Rio to her firmly, the tension on the ride over had been heavy. Rio’s gaze made her so hot she desperately wanted to fan at her face to keep from sweating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now with her back against the wall, and Rio’s lips on her, she didn’t have time to think past the growing pressure building in her lower abdomen. She hadn’t even taken any clothing off yet. Her head lowered to watch Rio as she pushed her jacket from her shoulders, pulling at the bottom of her sweater. Agatha nodded her head before she could think better of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio removed it quickly, her fingers warm and hurried. Her dark eyes taking in Agatha’s old bra with interest, the older woman took the pause to move her long hair in front of half of her body. Her eyes were hesitant as Rio’s fingers came up to hold her face as she brought her lips back to hers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha groaned as she felt Rio’s fingers grab handfuls of her breasts, her mouth opening as she tried to apologize for what she was wearing, but expert hands had her quickly forgetting what she was about to say.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s tongue slid into her mouth and drew paths of pleasure Agatha hadn’t realized existed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes closed as her breathing picked up. Rio’s hands found her bra clip and released it, helping the fabric to the floor, before her hands started to work on her pants. Agatha’s hands coming to slow Rio’s down. Dark eyes looked up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved her hands to Rio’s face, and with careful hands, moved her hair away, her eyes dipping down to look at her. “You’re… wearing too much.” She watched as Rio quickly ripped her top off, her pants pooling at her feet a moment later, the same lace ensemble she had sent Agatha a photo of was currently gracing her body as if she were poured into it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Better?” Rio raised an eyebrow as Agatha nodded. Rio brought their lips back together before Agatha could think for too long, before whispering against her lips. “Are you… a top, or bottom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha froze, her breaths coming hard. “She…” they both instantly knew she was speaking of her ex. “She didn’t like me… to take control.” Her eyes watched Rio’s carefully.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lifted Agatha’s hand to her throat, and helped her close her fingers around her delicate skin. “If you want to be in control, you can be.” She went to kiss Agatha, but the woman tightened her grip, Rio’s eyes flashing with excitement at the element of danger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you… sure?” Agatha’s voice darkened. She was riding a high from Rio’s hands and lips being on her body, and she wasn’t aware where this sudden surge of confidence was coming from. Perhaps a need to not let this woman in front of her down and meet her expectations. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded enthusiastically. “I’m sure.” She lifted her hand back over Agatha’s and pressed down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha walked her backwards until her legs collided with the bed, Rio dropped to her ass. Agatha’s eyes going feral. Her hands framing Rio’s hips as she moved her lips to Rio’s ear, hearing the shuddering breaths the younger woman was taking. “Get on your hands and knees.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scooted backward slowly, her eyes not leaving Agatha’s, assuming the requested position. Agatha’s eyes locked on her. “I don’t want you to move.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span>Rio inclined her head, Agatha walked around the bed until she was kneeling behind Rio’s ass. “I think someone is trying </span>
  <em>
    <span>very </span>
  </em>
  <span>hard to be good.” Agatha’s fingers slipped the lace aside and entered Rio slowly, the other woman gasping, her head thrown back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked. “Atta girl.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted her hips backward. Agatha laughed. “Greedy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, her voice coming out as a hiss. “Yesss.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled Rio down so she was sitting back on her heels now, Agatha’s fingers still deep inside her twisting. Agatha’s voice, dark. “This what you wanted?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio mewled as she tried to press Agatha's fingers deeper.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmmmm.” Words were becoming hard for Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha withdrew her hand before wrapping it around Rio’s stomach, restarting her descent to her panties slowly. “Is this what you thought about when you read my post?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio released a guttural groan, shaking her head. Agatha almost faltered when Rio spoke again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No…When I,” She gasped, “Saw your photo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned her chin on Rio’s shoulder to look down at the expanse of her body, watching how Rio's chest and stomach quivered with each touch. “Hm…” Agatha mused. “Interesting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio whined. “It’s…” she gasped. “true.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha licked up her throat before she bit down below her ear, sucking firmly, Rio’s hips bucking into her hand. Agatha’s voice practically growled. “What did you see me doing to you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to catch her breath. “Agatha… please…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman faltered, the spell cracking, her eyes looking around her at the state she had worked herself and Rio into. Her throat clearing, her voice unsteady. “Tell…. Tell me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached her hand down to cover Agatha’s as it entered her panties, then pressed two of Agatha’s long slim fingers into herself as she just about died. “I… I saw you bending me over a couch in my head,” She cried out briefly… her mind losing focus. “Then I fucked myself raw to photos of you.” She threw her head back on Agatha’s shoulder as she tried to breathe. “Please, Agatha…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The older woman moved her hand harder and faster into Rio’s heat, the woman begging her not to stop. Her body tightening as she came, a quiet scream was for Agatha’s ears alone, as a rush of liquid coated her fingers, and Rio’s body collapsed against her. Rio’s face turned inward towards Agatha’s neck to nuzzle into her, and after a moment, she kissed her lightly there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s chest was heaving, she was so turned on, but at the same time, her caregiver instincts came into play as she moved Rio’s hair away from her neck. “You, okay?” She removed her fingers from the woman and that alone made an obscene noise that almost had Agatha coming, well, maybe she did a little.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned slightly. Cuddling further into her. “Let me rest a moment, then I’ll be ready.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha wrapped a gentle arm around the woman in her lap, scared to move. “Take all the time you need.” Her voice was soft. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her wife had never let her hold her like this. It was always just sex, and it was generally always focused on her wife’s own pleasure. As long as Agatha was following orders the fun could continue, she was never allowed to go off script. But Rio seemed to like what Agatha did when unleashed. Her thumbs rubbing gently at Rio’s exposed skin. Before she knew it, the woman was softly snoring in her arms, her head dipping down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved carefully to reposition her on the bed, sitting back and taking in all that was Rio Vidal, unguarded. She felt as if she shouldn’t be allowed to see this, that this woman was far too special for her peasant eyes, so she reached for a blanket and pulled it up Rio’s body, effectively tucking her in. “Good night.”</span>
</p><p><br />
<span>She moved to her phone, seeing a good night message from Nicky, and she smiled. She got ready for bed and stood on the other side from Rio’s sleeping form. When it appeared the woman wasn’t going to wake up any time soon, she slipped under the covers and decided to rest her eyes, sure that this had all been one hell of a dream.</span>

  <span>Chapter 12</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha woke with a start when she heard someone opening and closing a door, her eyes flashed open as she held a sheet to her bare chest. Her eyes looked around wildly until they landed on Rio, now wearing a white fluffy robe. Dark eyes sparkled when they landed on her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Morning.” Rio’s smile was wide as she placed a tray down on the bed. “I ordered breakfast.” She sat across from Agatha, her fingers grabbing some fruit. “I got some smoothies too, wasn’t sure what you liked, so I got three. Have whatever you want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked about the room, flashes of the night before coming back to her in pieces, she rubbed the sleep from her eyes and found that Rio still sat there staring at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is there something on my face?” Rio’s fingers lifted to wipe at her lips, a bit concerned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “No… you’re good.” She held the sheet firmly, glancing down. “So… we…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned forward her eyes looking Agatha up and down before her fingers pressed a fresh raspberry to Agatha’s lips. The woman unsure about taking the fruit when her lips parted slightly and Rio placed the fruit on her tongue, followed swiftly by her own lips. As they kissed, Agatha's brain just about exploded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pulled back when she could, her eyes looking at Rio skeptically. “Get everything you wanted?” She raised an eyebrow, her walls already starting to build themselves up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip as she sat back, shaking her head once, “No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widened in alarm. “I’m…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached forward and played with a wavy strand of brunette hair. “I have more plans for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed, causing Rio’s smile to grow wider. Rio’s voice was soft as her thoughts came tumbling out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit, Agatha, you’re everything I hoped you would be.” Her eyes searched Agatha’s face for something, clearly perplexed at the stiffness she saw residing there. “We should…” She licked her lips, letting her eyes drop to Agatha’s. “Do this again sometime.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “I think you forget I don’t live nearby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio waved her hands in the air as if the distance wasn’t a concern. “I travel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached her hand out to grab a piece of fruit, her fingers running into Rio’s and before she could take her hand back, Rio encouraged her fingers to take the fruit, as she moved on to another. Agatha slowly brought the piece to her lips, savoring the sharp flavor as she chewed it slowly. Her shoulders shrugged. “You live in LA I take it, not the closest location, even to Chicago.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio watched her for a time, her voice silent, she watched her so long Agatha became a bit unnerved. Eventually Rio spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think we could figure something out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed. “I have Nicky.” Her self defense going up. She was a mother and a mother first. Rio needed to understand that about her. She needed to make that clear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her smile fall as she got more serious. “I know that, Agatha, you’ve told me about him, remember?” Rio played with a piece of fruit. “So… is he upset you were gone for the weekend?” Her shoulders drew in slightly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched Rio’s fingers, a bit distracted before shaking herself awake. “He…I told him I was going for a job interview.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile returned. “Ah, did you get the job?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s shoulders dropped. “No. I’m heading home Sunday with no plans to return.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s head tilted in thought. “Are you… looking for a job?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha glared at her. “What do you think? I have a college education and I work at a hardware store.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “There are always options.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head quickly, her eyes fading. “Not for people like me,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes were left searching Agatha’s face. “You don’t go home until tomorrow. Let’s try and enjoy our time together, we can discuss our next meeting later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The older woman raised an eyebrow. “And who says we’ll meet again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes didn’t leave hers as she reached out her fingers and lifted Agatha’s wrist, locating her heart rate quickly. “This.” She smiled, haughty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took her hand back. “You’ll be bored of me by the end of the weekend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scooted closer. “I highly doubt that, but I know…” Her eyes lifted slowly. “I’m not bored of you now.” She leaned forward and let her lips ghost over Agatha’s skin before she hesitated, Agatha noticing the shift before drawing back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat back and looked a bit guilty. “So there’s… this, form.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes traced Rio’s face confusion written all over hers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was wondering, if you wouldn’t mind…” She pushed air out of her lungs quickly. “Signing my NDA?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit her lip. “Hm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio ran her hand through her hair. “I know it’s,” her eyes flashed to Agatha’s to continue to gauge her reaction, “Awkward. But Lilia gets really annoying about these things…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s brows came together. “Who’s Lilia?” A hint of jealousy coloring her tone, which Rio ignored.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tapped her fingers on the tray. “My agent.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her hair fall like a vail across her face. “Ah. Yeah that…” she tried to steady herself. “Makes sense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted her weight. “It’s not like I think you’re going to do something… horrible. I just… it protects me.” Her fingers gripped the little table. “It’s not like I can make you sign it…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes lifted under long lashes, she shrugged. “I can sign it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s body relaxed, she looked relieved. “Cool.” She moved to get the form from her bag, and it took her a moment to find a pen. “It’s just basically that you won’t tell anyone about our time together or do any interviews about me. Or share photos or videos of me… that sort of thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took the pen but froze. “So… Nicky has access to my computer and I don’t think he knows it’s really you, but if he reads through our conversation…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged, forgetting the finer details of those conversations. “I’m okay with Nicky knowing it’s me, if he can keep a secret.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s face softened. “Thank you, I… I don’t like lying to him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took the pen and added the adjustment with her initial. Giving the pen back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha signed the papers quickly, handing them back. Rio rolled them and placed them back in her bag. Coming back and sitting on the bed. “So what do you want to do with our remaining time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You’re not going to keep me hidden away all weekend?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “Not that I wouldn’t want to spend the weekend holed up in this room with you, cause I totally would, but I thought… maybe you would want to go out tonight?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat back a little. “I thought </span>
  <em>
    <span>this,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>She pointed at Rio then herself.</span>
  <em>
    <span> “</span>
  </em>
  <span>Was a secret?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took another piece of fruit and plopped it into her mouth. “Please, every publication loves to forget I’m gay. They’ll peg you as my friend the moment they see you.” Her eyes lingering on Agatha’s lips, “Even if we’re caught kissing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed. “That’s… convenient.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded happily. “Yep.” She looked around the room before she looked back at Agatha. "Do you… want to go shopping?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, sighing. Her eyes lifted. “No money, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brown eyes flashed with recognition. “Right.” She chewed at her lip. “Well, I can’t very well take you on a date if I didn’t have you pack for one. We should go get you something anyway, my treat.” Before Agatha could protest, Rio jumped in. “It’s really for my benefit. I’m the one who’s going to be enjoying it for the evening.”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER 13</h1><p> </p><p>Rio pulled up her hood and slid her sunglasses back on before entering the Water Tower with Agatha. She’d been here plenty of times before on her travels and knew what store she wanted to start with. Something fancy but not insanely expensive. She let her eyes drift to Agatha a few times on the way there, wanting to reach out and take her hand but not sure if she was reading the other woman correctly, maybe the other woman didn’t like a lot of physical contact, so she decided not to risk it. </p><p> </p><p>As they arrived at the first store, Rio ushering her through first with a hand on the small of her back, Rio indicated that Agatha should start looking. “I’ll hang out by the changing rooms.” She turned and Agatha grabbed her arm. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t… I don’t know what you like.” She licked her lips, looking around her nervously. </p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced at the register and saw that the woman was watching her with careful eyes, so they did assume she was going to steal something, she rolled her eyes and turned her gaze back to the woman of importance. “I assume you know what <em> you </em>like, don’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her lip taking a step back. “I… I wouldn’t know.” Her eyes looked about, a bit overwhelmed. “My…ex… she chose what I wore.” She crossed her arms tightly, “The only time I wore anything like this was for her work events.” She looked like she wanted to run. “I only had a handful of nice dresses.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed, she grabbed Agatha’s hand and led her back to the changing area and indicated that she sit down. “I’ll pull a few things. Color?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged, but when Rio didn’t move and only held her gaze, she conceded.</p><p> </p><p>“I like purple.” Her voice was quiet and distant. Rio inclined her head and took off. Her eyes shifted through the styles at record speed. Pulling three dresses that would look good on Agatha’s body. She figured they could dip into a shoe store after. She tried not to let her anger rise as one associate continued to follow her around, poorly concealing what she was doing. The other associate simply played on her phone without a care in the world. She wandered back to the changing rooms and handed the dresses to Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Try these.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman nodded and stood to enter a room, closing the door. Rio waited patiently, her fingers retrieving and flipping her phone in circles. Her eyes lifted when Agatha emerged. A dark purple dress that sat barely off the shoulders and was form fitted, draped delicately over her skin. </p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes looked down at herself. “Well?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes took in the color, it complemented Agatha’s skin tone nicely. Only problem was the woman looked extremely uncomfortable. “You look great, but let’s try the other two to be sure.”</p><p>Agatha’s face was tense as she nodded, she returned to the room and Rio could hear the clothes shifting before the woman appeared in the next dress. It was black and strapless, pale hands moved to smooth out the fabric. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice was unsure, “Is this one better?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let her eyes take in her lover. She looked less uncomfortable but she wasn’t strutting like she knew she was hot shit. <em> Not that one either then </em>. Rio’s eyes looked about the room once more, was it that she wanted something a bit less red carpet or fancy dinner party and a bit more revealing? Rio stood and Agatha lifted her eyes. “Let me grab a different style.” She indicated the dressing room with a look. “Go ahead and try the last one, I’ll be back.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio did another round of the store and found a dress that showed more skin, then on a whim she grabbed a silk halter top, dark purple. Her eyes watched how it shimmered in the light, she smirked. This would look amazing with Agatha’s bright blue eyes. She wandered back over to the dressing room, seeing Agatha poke her head out a minute later. She looked at Rio desperately and the woman approached. “Did you need a different size?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blushed. “I think this one is a bit, complicated, for me.” Her eyes shifting back into the room and Rio made the connection, she didn’t know how to put it on.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Okay, no worries. Try these two then.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at the top, then at Rio. “Well, are you coming in to see that one?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged. “I mean… I can. If you don’t mind?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dipped back in and when she didn’t close the door, Rio slipped in behind her, shutting it herself. Agatha had everything neat and tidy, two dresses that Rio assumed were no’s were on one hook, the black dress that had been okay sitting on the hook on the right. Agatha set the other two pieces on the third hook. Her bra and underwear on full display her cheeks red. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll just… yeah.” She turned to pull on the next dress and Rio saw the discomfort again, she cleared her throat. “Yeah, forget that one, try the shirt.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers froze, then moved slowly to the shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice cleared. “Do you like that color? Cause if you don’t, that’s okay…” She let her voice trail off as blue eyes took in the fabric. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, her fingers lightly trailing across the top, moving to take off her dress then put it on. After she donned the purple she turned and looked at herself in the mirror. Her eyes took a closer look. Rio had to admit she didn’t mind the fit, Agatha half dressed in an expensive top and her black cotton underwear was giving Rio ideas she should definitely <em> not </em> be having in a public dressing room.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes took in the planes of Agatha’s face in the mirror. She seemed more relaxed in this piece, comfortable even. Rio stood as she noticed the other woman was lost to her reflection. “I think you look great. Let’s get that one.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned. “I don’t think I can just wear this tonight.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked her up and down, smirking. “Can’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smacked her on the arm, when she saw the way Rio was openly checking her out, scandalized one moment then nervous about her display of familiarity the next. The quick action caused the dark haired beauty to burst out in laughter, she hadn’t been smack at in a while, not in a playful manner. “Alright, alight. Maybe not tonight, but we should get it anyway. It looks…” Her voice warmed. “Very nice on you.” She tilted her head. “Gives me an idea.” She shook her head. “Get changed. Let’s get that and try the next store.”</p><p> </p><p>The other woman nodded, taking off the top carefully and putting her own clothing back on. A plain white tank top, a sweater and a black coat, followed by a pair of jeans. When she was ready she slung her purse over her shoulder as Rio led them to the register. Agatha stood awkwardly by Rio’s side as she bought the top, the younger woman noticing how Agatha’s hand pressed at her stomach. Rio frowned, she hadn’t thought the top was that expensive, she would have to make sure Agatha didn’t see the price tag at the next store. As they left, Rio hooked her arm through Agatha’s, leading her to their next destination.</p><p> </p><p>As they arrived, Agatha’s brows furrowed. This store was certainly a bit more expensive. Rio walked about and started to browse. Picking up two pairs of pants and two feminine fitted jackets with a latch in front.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed her glasses up on her head, holding the pieces out in front of Agatha. “I think these should fit.” She indicated the way to the dressing rooms. “Go on and try them with the shirt.” Agatha shook her head. “I don’t think we should get me something from here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes took in Agatha’s gaze carefully, it didn’t stray from the pieces, she definitely liked them. Rio started for the changing rooms, knowing Agatha would follow. “I just want to see these on you. Plus, I have a feeling you might like them.”</p><p> </p><p>She opened the door and Agatha walked past her slowly, she turned her face back towards Rio. “Help me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, her hand placed on Agatha’s lower back. “Of course.” She followed her in and started to hang the suit pieces, opening their bag and taking out the purple top and handing it to Agatha, the woman putting it on quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved up behind her and placed her hands on her hips, noticing how Agatha’s breath hitched. “Did you need help taking these off, Or…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha practically jumped. “No… no, I can… do that.” She stepped away a step and took her pants off before flushing when she realized she had just bent over in front of Rio and her eyes located said woman checking out her ass. </p><p> </p><p>The first pair of pants were extended to her on Rio’s fingers when she turned around, with a smile that was far too upbeat, Rio clearly was enjoying herself. “Here you go.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned and pulled them on, her eyes noticing movement when Rio held out the fancy jacket for her arms. She slipped in and pulled the jacket over her shoulders. It was a perfect fit. </p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a low whistle. “Damn, Miss Harkness.” Dark eyes watched as Agatha stood a bit straighter. “I take it, you like this look?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached to find the tag when Rio intercepted her hand. “Oh honey, you don’t wanna know. And I prefer you didn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned around, forgoing her mirror image. “Why a suit?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio poked her tongue into her cheek, “Because you look damn good in it.” She let a smile blossom on her face. “I won’t know how to keep my hands to myself with you looking like that…” Her eyes looked up seriously. “Fair warning.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned and looked at herself in the mirror once more, fluffing her hair a bit. “I’m not sure what you see…” </p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back against the dressing room wall and closed her eyes, letting out a quiet moan. “Oh, trust me. It’s hot.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “Well, whatever works for you. This isn’t what I would choose…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio opened her eyes, watching as Agatha couldn’t take her eyes off her outfit. Rio smirked, but instead of calling Agatha out on her bullshit, she let her keep up the facade of being indifferent. “Well, I appreciate you wearing it for me tonight. I feel honored.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned and started to disrobe, “It’s your weekend, I’m just along for the ride.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio made Agatha wait outside the shop as she paid, the cashier holding her up for a moment to get a photo, which she gladly provided given the girl's quiet request.</p><p> </p><p>She walked out of the store and handed the bags off to Agatha. “Let’s go back and get dressed, I have the best idea for where to start our evening.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took no time to get dressed but struggled to get her wavy hair to sit how she wanted it to, running some water and mousse through it once more before giving up. Her fingers taking Rio’s black eyeliner and doing her eyes. She hoped the woman wouldn’t notice that she had used it. She touched up her face with some concealer and powder before stepping out of the bathroom, Rio was sitting on the vanity, her face leaned into the mirror. Her eyes were now lined in green and black eyeshadow, the green in particular making her brown eyes pop. Her hair was straightened and shimmered with the light, sometimes almost looking red. Agatha looked away when Rio’s eyes caught her staring. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you like it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Your makeup looks nice.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio finished up and then turned around. Her top looked like a black bralet with very thin straps, and on bottom she wore a black skirt that had a very scandalous slip up the side. “Ah, so you like my face?” She folded some dark hair behind her ear. “I’ll take it.” She bit her lip trying to suppress a smile. “And here I thought you were only interested in my body.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flicked some hair over her shoulder trying not to feel too out of place with this gorgeous woman standing in front of her. “I like that too.” She cleared her throat. “The photo you sent has gotten…” She nodded her head in thought, deciding to be truthful. “A lot of use.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “Agatha! Did you get yourself off to my photo?” The mock outrage descended into laughter as she walked up to the other woman, her hand’s playing with Agatha’s suit jacket. “You know… now that you signed the NDA, I could… send you more photos.” She leaned forward and whispered in Agatha’s ear, feeling her body quiver. “Better photos.”</p><p> </p><p>She sighed in Agatha’s ear and moved back before they didn’t make it out for their evening. “But let’s see where the night takes us.” She winked as she moved to grab a clutch from her suitcase and her coat. She pulled on her shoes as her eyes noticed Agatha stood unmoving. “What is it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hands clasped in front of her, her fingers restless. “I… hope my shoes are alright with this?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio wanted to face palm, they had forgotten to get Agatha shoes. Her eyes looked into the corner at Agatha’s black and white converse. Her eyes looking between them and Agatha, it would be a statement, and she honestly didn’t think it would look bad. “I’m sorry, I totally forgot to swing by and get shoes. But…” She moved to retrieve Agatha’s. “These will look decently rock and roll, I think you’ll pull off the look.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as Rio squatted before her to put on her shoes. She moved to take over when Rio pushed her back lightly, Agatha was squatting one moment then on her ass the next, her mouth hanging open. “Hey!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio ignored her as she took Agatha’s right foot and moved to put her shoe on. The woman tried to cover up her discomfort with humor.</p><p> </p><p>“I can tie my own shoes, <em> mom </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved to place the other shoe. “Well, I didn’t see you rushing to do it, and we gotta go.” She let her eyes settle on Agatha’s, dipping to her lips briefly as she finished tying. “There.”</p><p> </p><p>She stood and held out her hand. “Let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gripped her hand and wasn’t sure how the other woman was going to pull her up wearing heels. Rio had no issue.</p>

  <span>CHAPTER 14</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes took in the dark room with a multi-colored neon glow that accented the space well. Where were they? Her face stuck trying to take in the space. Rio moved to the counter to pay for something, picking up items as she came away with what looked like a green and purple ball. She handed the purple one to Agatha. “My lady.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pursed her lips wondering what she was meant to do with this, when Rio grabbed her free hand. “We need to pick out our weapons…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth opened as she tried to form a coherent question but none came out. As she was dragged along, they made it to a stand that held different types of putters. Rio let go of her as she examined the devices, Agatha just grabbing the first one she saw. Rio’s appraisal seemed to take longer as her eye for these things seemed to be a bit technical.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tapped hers on the ground as she waited. “What are you, a connoisseur of golf sticks?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio ignored her attitude and continued her search until she came upon the one she wanted. “I played golf growing up.” She cocked an eyebrow at her date. “Any fan of mine would know that.” She took a step towards Agatha sizing her up. “Did you lie about being a fan?” She looked her up and down. “Cause, I’m not going to lie, I could be into that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her shoulders. “I know plenty about you. You are correct, anyone should remember that fact, you certainly talk about that </span>
  <em>
    <span>interesting </span>
  </em>
  <span>fact enough.” She sniffed. “I just… forgot.” She pursed her lips then when Rio only stared, her blue eyes rolled. “Your golfing abilities aren't my favorite thing about you, so sue me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio relaxed. “Hm, I’ll have to find some other way to impress you then, but I’m hopeful my game here does, at least a bit. I’ve got a wicked trick shot.” She winked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha followed Rio as she moved to the first hole. The neon pinks, greens, and purples made the landscape feel foreign, like they had been transported to another world. And one thing Rio hadn’t exaggerated about was the fact that she was good, too good. She went out of her way to trick shot every single hole and Agatha had to admit, it was pretty impressive, even if she fought the way her facials were threatening to show it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha herself hated playing golf. She got frustrated and gave up on the first two holes but soon after that Rio took it upon herself to help. Her body coming up to mold to Agatha’s, her hands helping her grip the pole. “So you need to tighten your grip, but not too tight. Relax for me and just feel how I do it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s breathing was heavy in her own ears as Rio guided her through a stroke. Her head grew dizzy with Rio’s warm body against her own. She had forgotten where they were and what they were doing when the ball sailed over the barriers and hit three points before dropping into the hole. Agatha’s eyes looked down at Rio’s hands in utter bewilderment. “I have no idea how you did that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio gripped her harder, her body pressing firmly into Agatha’s. “I can show you again, if you’d like?” Her voice dipped and promised of other things that were yet to come. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha released the putter, closing her eyes a moment later at the sound of the thing clattering to the floor. Blue eyes cringed at the noise in embarrassment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bent to pick up the putter as she lightly tugged on Agatha’s wrist. “Let’s go grab a table and some snacks.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was left at a small table, taking in the designs in the cafe room. Her eyes watching the waves of colors, the lights rippling across the walls. Rio returned with three baskets and scooted into the seat across from her. “Okay, so I got cheese sticks, chicken nuggets and sliders.” She removed two soda’s from where she was holding them in her arm. Extending one root beer to Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The brunette smirked at the choices, she had never imagined that any point of tonight would be so down to earth. It was comforting. “Works for me.” She took her drink and opened it, taking a sip and relaxing, her fingers locating a cheese stick she started to eat, Rio quickly joining in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes watched Rio, not quite sure how to figure her out. “So… I had to get dressed up, in expensive clothing, for this place?” She let her eyes land on Rio’s. “Or just for a date with you?” Her hand covered her mouth as she took another bite. “Not that I’m complaining, this is probably the best date I have been on in a long time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shoved a chicken nugget into her mouth shaking her head before chewing slowly and swallowing. “It’s for where we are going after, this is just the dinner portion.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes widened. “There’s more to this date?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her shoulder’s fall. “Unless… you didn’t want to do anything else?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked down at the table, frustrated that she didn’t know how to engage in such a delicate dance. Flirting during a first date was hard, not something she excelled at. And doing said date with a celebrity that constantly was giving her mild heart palpitations was another challenge entirely. “I didn’t say I wanted the night to end, I was… merely curious.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio seemed to try and perk back up. “I have an in with a nightclub near your hotel, figured we would eat then go for a bit of dancing… would you… like that?” her voice sounded a bit uncertain at the end, as if she was worried she might not be sure of Agatha’s preferences. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha inclined her head. “Sure, that sounds fun.” She hadn’t been to a club in years, but she had enjoyed dancing when she was younger. She tried not to think about if she was about to embarrass herself. She continued to eat as she looked about the room, not sure what else to say, her mind feeling as if it was rushing to find questions, but she kept coming up blank. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio watched Agatha like she was the most interesting thing in the room. More than satisfied to sit in the silence, but finding herself wanting to know more about the woman in front of her. “So washed up theater kid, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha just about choked on her food. Coughing before Rio rubbed at her arm</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded as she finished the end of her coughing fit. “Yeah… I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her hand trail down to Agatha’s forearm that peaked out from her sleeve when she bent her arm, “I don’t know if you know this… but I started out in theater, too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “You don’t say?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded enthusiastically. Aware that they were playing up a bit of ignorance. “Yeah, I played Elphaba in my school's version of Wicked.” She added, then tacked on more information in a hushed tone. “I also scored big with Erin Meadows on opening night,” She inclined her head. “She played Glinda.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Okay, I knew about you doing Wicked, but I didn’t know about you banging the good witch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio swelled with pride. “See there are still some things you don’t know about me.” She leaned her chin on her fist. “Tell me something else I don’t know about you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her eyes drift to where Rio was still drawing patterns on her arm. “I… my first play was Beauty and the Beast.” Rio smiled but Agatha rushed on. “I played the old hag.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes crinkled. “That’s fantastic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I have a decent cackle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand moved to hold Agatha’s and play with her hands. “I would love to hear it sometime.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes narrowed. “You most certainly are </span>
  <em>
    <span>never </span>
  </em>
  <span>going to hear that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “We’ll see.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha and Rio walked hand in hand on the way to the club when Agatha’s feet slowed for a moment, her chest constricting. Rio’s dark eyes followed her gaze, reading the sign.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Karaoke?” Rio asked intrigued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes looked back at Rio, not really sure why she had stopped herself. “I just… haven’t seen a place like this in a while is all.” Her eyes lingered on the windows that were covered in fun lights. “I used to be good at this.” She sighed before shaking her head. “I don’t know why I stopped, I’m sorry, I don’t need to relive my college days.” As she moved to continue on, Rio kept her feet grounded, pulling her back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, alright then. I will say that I’m not the best at this, but I am willing to give it a go. Just, don’t make fun of me when I fail to hit the notes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes looked back at the establishment. “We don’t have to go, Rio… you had a plan for tonight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyebrow raised in challenge. “And now we have a new one.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked down the street then back at Rio. “We don’t have to…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved to get the door and held it open for her. “Let’s go. Show me what you got, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers flipped through the booklet, taking in the newer songs, she at least knew some of them. Her eyes were trying to note at least three numbers she wanted to do. Rio leaned in close, looking over her shoulder, already too comfortable in her space. Which Agatha tried to pretend was fine, but she was freaking out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll do whatever songs you want.” Rio offered up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, shifting slightly. “You have to choose too. I don’t even know what kind of music you listen to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. “Oh no! More secrets you’ll have to uncover. It’s almost like I’m a real person.” She mock gasped as she placed a hand to her own chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “I still don’t know that this isn’t all a dream.” She felt as Rio slid her arm around her waist, leaning her body in close. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll pick some Brittany. Keep it classic.” Her eyes continued to glance over the titles. “Does that work for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha forgot for a moment what they were doing when Rio’s warmth took over her senses, before the girl leaned away and ordered some more food and drinks. Agatha discretely shook herself out of her daze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked when the sake and snacks arrived, shrugging as if to say, </span>
  <em>
    <span>you didn’t think I was going to do this sober, did you</span>
  </em>
  <span>?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha plugged in the song list while Rio poured the drinks, music quickly filling the room as the two women moved to down a shot before they rushed to get singing. Agatha taking the lower part and Rio taking the higher one. Rio giggled when she messed up the words even though they were on the screen. She might have missed them because she had been looking at Agatha in her element. She would have rather just watched Agatha all night, using her voice to convey a practiced emotion – Rio could relate to feeling at home pretending. Though she was impressed with how genuine the words to the songs were when they left Agatha’s lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the song was over, they did another and another and before Rio knew what had happened, Agatha turned to her after the last song and started to kiss her. Rio’s eyes fell closed as Agatha held her firmly by the back of the neck. Rio loved that Agatha enjoyed taking charge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They made out for a good while before the room gave them a warning that their time was almost up, Agatha taking Rio’s hand and setting the course back to the hotel, with no room to mistake what she wanted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When they entered the room Agatha slowed Rio down as she carefully took off the expensive clothing she wore. “Don’t want to mess these up, that way you can return them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s face fell. “Agatha, those were a gift. You’re taking them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifted uncomfortably. “I don’t know how to explain where I got them from to my mother and my son.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “Tell them that the training program requires clothing and that you got them from a friend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cleared her throat, her emotions a bit wired with the alcohol in her system. “I don’t have friends…not anymore,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved forward, and moved Agatha’s hair out of her face. “I’m your friend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t know what to do with Rio’s kindness so she took control of the situation before Rio could say anything else even remotely sentimental, and smashed her lips into the other woman’s.</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 15</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha jolted awake as her phone started ringing. She frantically escaped Rio’s arms to locate it and as she did she felt her breath catch in her throat. “Nicky?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard her mother sigh and she squatted to the floor closing her eyes, feeling off balance. “Mother?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanora clicked her jaw. “Nicky’s sick. You need to come home, </span>
  <em>
    <span>now</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I am doing what I can, but this filth you’ve allowed into his soul is hard to clean and it’s rotting him from the inside out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rubbed at her forehead. “H-has he thrown up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard her mother grumbling. “Of course the child has, didn’t I say he was ill? Honestly, Agatha, you didn’t get your lack of brains from me. Why weren’t you up already? It’s nearly eight in the morning...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt soft hands rub at her back, her body relaxing, if only a bit. “I’ll head home right away.” Her breath hitched as the call went dead. She felt a warm body encasing her fragile form.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice was soft as she inquired. “Is Nicky okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, not quite present. “I… I shouldn’t have left him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “You can’t always be there, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman shook her head. “I… I need to get home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio caught her chin and turned it towards her. “Can you drive, right now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth opened and closed before she could land on her response. Finally locating one. “I’m going to have to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “I’ll drive you, then get a taxi back,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit her lip. “I can’t ask you to do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged, “You're not. Don’t worry, it’s not like I am trying to meet your kid, I’ll be discreet. We should stop and get him a few things on the way, I know I hate feeling sick. I’ve got a few tricks up my sleeve for a quick recovery.”</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <span>Rio had driven while Agatha slept. The other woman knocked out quickly the moment they got settled in the car. Rio tried not to watch Agatha dream, but occasionally her eyes darted over to take in the woman curled up against the window. She couldn’t help it. Rio’s eyes tried to stick close to her phone as she navigated to Agatha’s hometown. When she was about fifteen minutes away, she pulled off the road to stop at a pharmacy. She had just taken off her seatbelt when Agatha woke up, hitting the window.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” She looked around her as if she didn’t know where she was, her eyes doing a double take when Rio was sitting in her driver's seat. The dark haired woman pointed at the store.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was just going to run in real quick and get Nicky a few things…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha, looked around then back at Rio shaking her head, her anxieties seemed to be rushing back now that she was conscious. “No… I need to get home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes slid to the store, noting the brunette’s panic. “I guess… I can drop you off, then go get a few things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha ran a hand through her hair, readying herself to plead. “Nicky… he needs me,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio put her seatbelt back on and started to back out of the parking space. “Okay, I got it. I’m sorry, I misunderstood. You’re right. Let’s get him his mom, I’m sure that will help him feel better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When they arrived at Evanora’s house, an old woman with wavy silver hair stood glaring from the doorway in a burgundy cloak. Rio blatantly ignored the tension as she followed Agatha in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanora snarled as her daughter entered the home. “Was there even a job interview?” Eyeing Rio as if she were wearing something provocative and not her simple sweats. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened her mouth when Rio placed a hand on her back, inquiring softly about what mattered at the moment. “Nicky?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head and took a step back from Rio, her eyes not leaving Rio’s steady brown gaze. “Mom, is Nicky upstairs?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanora grunted and Agatha took off up the stairs. Her feet quickly took her to her child. Rio kept at a slower pace behind her and saw the moment the boy came into view. He was sitting in a large bed, blankets piled high and pillows behind his back. His eyes lidded. “Momma?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Upon further inspection, the child’s skin looked too pale, his eyes glassy. Rio’s fingers pressed at her own chest as it ached. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat gingerly on the bed next to him. “Nicky, I am so sorry I wasn’t here.” She wrapped her arms around him. “What hurts, baby?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky wrapped his arms back around her. He groaned. “Everything. I threw up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha started to run her hands through his short hair, clearly forgetting it wasn’t longer anymore, as her fingers hovered in the air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stood silently by, watching this woman do her mom thing. Rio took in Nicky’s pale skin with worry and cleared her throat, announcing herself. “Hey kid, how much did you throw up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s eyes lifted, his eyebrows furrowing as if he hadn’t noticed there was another person in the room yet. He tilted his head but answered. “A few times…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to smile. “Well, that’s not good.” She turned her attention to Agatha. “We should take him to get checked out. I am sure he at least could use some fluids,” Her dark eyes watched as Agatha hesitated, clearly uncomfortable with the idea. Her body, tightening, but before she could protest she bit her cheek and nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes found Rio’s, “Could… could you sit with him a second while I… find his insurance card?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to offer up a smile but she wasn’t sure that it was comforting in any way. “Sure. I don’t mind.” Agatha’s face was so upset Rio knew she worried she would say no. Rio indicated quickly that she would do as asked, nodding her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned forward and kissed Nicky’s hair as she stood. “This is… my friend, Nicky, she’s going to stay with you for a moment.” The little boy nodded and Agatha weaved around Rio, her footsteps thundering down the hall as she frantically disappeared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a step towards Nicky, “Hey, I’m Rio. Is it okay if I sit next to you, or would you prefer I stay over here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The little boy looked down and shrugged before he patted the space next to him, Rio sliding in next to him and taking out her phone a moment later. “Do you like games? Or is there something you wanna watch?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The little boy smiled and took her phone, starting to flip through the apps he leaned against her, causing Rio’s heart to seize in her chest. This was the kid she was never going to meet, that fact felt like a warning sign was flashing in her fucking face. She tried to keep breathing, she leaned her arm across his back as she settled in to watch a game the boy had opened and started playing. The sounds and movements helping keep her calm. It wasn’t a big deal, she was just keeping him company, this was just one time, then she was never going to see him again. She could do this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha returned a few moments later panting as she now had her purse and a medical card gripped tightly in her hand. “We should go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. Standing as she noticed Nicky’s hand lifted to his head as he tried to move. She leaned forward and scooped him up, the kid wrapping his arms around her neck, his head buried into her. Blue eyes grew large as she tried to step forward to take her six year old son, when Rio shook her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can carry him. I work out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked like she wanted to protest but gave in instead, leading the way back to the car. Rio opened the door and set the kid in gently. When Nicky placed his hand over his mouth, she slid in and grabbed a plastic bag from the ground, just in time, before his face tipped forward into the bag and he vomited. His whole body heaving, before the shivering started.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio helped him hold the bag, before taking one hand to help him fix his seat belt. Her eyes lifted. “Agatha, I got this, drive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes looked towards the wheel as she turned the key and the car roared to life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The urgent care had been a just down the road, luckily it wasn’t too busy and they were put back into a room right away. The doctor came in to ask questions about what was going on. Agatha chewed at her lips as she took breaks between her answers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s been unable to stop vomiting…” Her body was shaking, but not so gently that Rio didn’t notice. The woman silently helped her sit down besides Nicky, before speaking herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We need some IV fluids with electrolytes, he can’t keep anything down. Maybe some anti nausea meds? Also, I think we’ll be wanting a full blood panel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes looked to the ground like she was going to be sick herself. The doctor simply nodded at the routine request. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll need to place an IV. But none of this should take too long. The man leaned on his knees before taking a lollipop from his jacket and giving it to the boy. “Here, save this for later when you are feeling better, I have a feeling you’re a very brave boy and you’re going to do awesome today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky took the lollipop and handed it to his mother. “Thank you.” He said to the doctor quietly, while his eyes looked to his Mom, wanting to know how badly everything was going to hurt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>While the nurse appeared and started to get set up, Rio watched as Nicky eyed the tools. Rio stepped in to disrupt his line of sight. “So, Nicky… I do this thing sometimes at hospitals. I’m like… the hospital witch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s eyes looked up and for a moment, the child seemed distracted. “What’s a hospital witch?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio clasped her hands and looked around her real quick to see how long the nurse might need to get ready, gauging the amount of time the child needed to be entertained for. “Well, I grant wishes to brave little kids. You get to wish for something that you really want and if you’re really brave, you get your wish.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s eyes seemed to come a little more into focus as he struggled to push his brain to think. “Anything I want?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head as if waking up. “Nicky.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled at the kid nodding. “Basically.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy tapped his finger to his chin as his eyes shot back to her. “A puppy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes just about popped out of her head as she shook her head at Rio over her son.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to school her features. “A puppy is sort of hard to come by, it could take a long while for me to locate one… is there anything from the store?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky seemed to think harder. “Well, if Momma goes away again, it would be good to be able to talk to her… without getting in trouble.” He looked at his mom briefly. “Do they still have iPads in the store?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t look at Agatha as she nodded. “Sure they do, if you are really brave, we can grant your wish after today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s eyes lit up, his face setting into a look of determination, his eyes locking with Rio’s. “I’m going to be so brave, you just watch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled and kept her eyes far from Agatha’s gaze, she could already feel the frustration wafting off of her. She figured Agatha could set rules down about the device, what was the harm in her getting it for the boy if it made today, and future trips Agatha might take, easier on him?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved as the nurse scooted her rollie chair closer. “Okay, Nicolas, we’re going to place this thing in your arm real quick. It will hurt but only for a few moments. We’ll use this heat pack to relax your arm and get a good vein then we will place this ice to relax your arm when we’re done with our tests. You ready?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s little pale face nodded. His eyes drifted to Rio’s as the woman took his arm. Rio inclined her head. “Keep breathing, Nicky.” Dark eyes lifted and watched as Agatha’s grip on Nicky tightened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy's eyes widened as he grunted. “Ow.” He looked down at the plastic in his arm and bit his lip. The nurse moved efficiently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good job, that’s done. Here’s the heat pack. Hold that there while I take some blood.” Nicky’s hands took the pack and quickly held it to his arm, his brows releasing slightly as the sting faded a little. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio crossed her arms. “That was pretty badass little dude. Not even one tear?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky smirked. “Nope.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lifted her fist out and the kid bumped it. “Cool.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched as Nicky’s arm was hooked up to an IV drip and the nurse finished up. “Ok that is going to go for about forty minutes. Then we should be able to get you out of here.” Her eyes lifted to Agatha, “You’ll get an email about the results within a day. If there’s an issue you can follow up with his normal doctor or bring him back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded her understanding as the woman snuck Nicky a hot wheels sticker and left. Nicky handed his mother the ice pack. “I wanna keep using the heat pack, this is cold.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took off her jacket and placed it around Nicky’s shoulders. The little boy smiled up at her. “Can I keep playing that game on your phone?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha went to shake her head when Rio handed over her cell phone. “You got it.” Messing the little boy’s hair a bit as she teased him. He took the phone in his hands and became engrossed in the activities.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands shaking as she released her son. “I should… go deal with the bill. Can you?” She indicated her son with her gaze and Rio nodded. “Of course.” The older woman slipped out of the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat with Nicky watching him play when it seemed like Agatha was gone for a while. The little boy spoke as if he heard her thoughts. “Momma isn’t leaving me forever, is she?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s concerned gaze returned to the boy in front of her. “Nicky, why would you think that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His little shoulders shrugged as he didn’t look away from the phone. “Mommy did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt the bile want to come up her throat, but she tapped it down. “Well, your Momma is not her.” She felt as Nicky leaned into her once more. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio ran her hand through his hair, the child sighing softly. Rio’s eyes taking into account that over half the IV bag was empty. “Are you feeling any better?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded. “Yeah, I’m hungry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled. “Okay, well why don’t I go find your Momma and we get going soon so we can feed you?” Nicky smiled and looked up at her. “Can I pick lunch?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio flashed her eyes at him. “Sure.” He giggled and she left him with her phone, taking note of the room number as she wandered back towards the front desk, her face scrunching as she heard Agatha’s voice frantic on the phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean you won’t cover the blood test?” She groaned quietly, muffling her voice, “He’s sick, it’s needed to rule out if it’s something serious… I just talked to that department…” She sounded like she was on the verge of tears. “What is the point in this stupid insurance if it forces me into poverty when I need to use it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio approached and reached out light fingers to touch Agatha’s shoulder, the woman flinching away from her, not knowing who was touching her. Rio stepped back as if burned. Her eyes lifting to the staff that were throwing pitiful looks Agatha’s way. Rio sighed and walked up to the desk speaking softly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How much does she owe?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman let her gaze look towards the mother on the phone before Rio tried again. “I’m going to pay it for her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman let her shoulders relax. “It’s $522.” Rio nodded then produced a card discreetly. “Here.” She kept her voice low. “If we can get a receipt, we'll file with the insurance later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman nodded, running the card and printing a receipt. “I included the claim codes, I hope that helps her.” Rio nodded as the woman took a deep breath. “I know this is inappropriate…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes looked between Agatha still on the phone and the woman at the desk. Her face was tense. “What is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked off towards the front doors. “Is there any way I could get your autograph? And you can totally say no…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, smiling softly. Normally this would frustrate her, but the fact that things were so quiet and that they were the only people in the waiting room eased her mood. “I suppose I could do that real quick, just don’t be telling anyone else I’m here, alright?” She lifted an eyebrow and the woman broke out into a smile. “Oh, I won't, I'll keep it real hush hush.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took the offered paper and pen and glanced at the woman’s name plate writing a quick note. “Thanks for helping us today.” She handed the paper over as the next patient came through the doors, approaching the line to speak with the desk. The woman held out the paperwork for Rio, indicating to give it to Agatha. Rio took it with a quiet </span>
  <em>
    <span>thank yo</span>
  </em>
  <span>u before she wandered back over to her friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha, we should probably get back to Nicky.” Rio spoke softly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes lifted to her as her voice cracked. “I need to figure out how to … pay for this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio handed her the receipt and paperwork and Agatha’s hand with the phone lowered, the insurance agent still making their excuses down the line, none the wiser that Agatha was no longer listening. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took her free hand. “Let’s get back to Nicky. She put the codes on there to fight the insurance on this later. It wasn’t a big deal, I wanted Nicky to have the blood tests.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha followed blindly as Rio guided them back to the room, Nicky’s face lighting up the moment he saw both of them, color finally back in his cheeks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky practically jumped out of the car the moment it stopped moving. Agatha shouted. “Nicky, don't run!” She rolled her eyes. “You would have never known two hours ago he was on death’s door.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “Fluids can do a lot, I’m glad he’s feeling better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands gripped the steering wheel. “You didn’t need to run into the store on the way back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lifted the bag. “He needed this stuff, he’s had a rough day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed her eyes. “Don’t get him the iPad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand fell. “Agatha, he was brave today…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes cut to her. “You need to stop,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her stomach drop. “Stop, what, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman shook her head angrily. “You should go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip. “Yeah… I know. I’ll just… call a ride.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands slid to the bottom of the steering wheel. As she tried to even out her breathing. She managed a quiet, </span>
  <em>
    <span>thank you</span>
  </em>
  <span> after a moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio folded her hair behind her own ear. “Of course.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s blue eyes took her in when she thought she wasn’t looking, as if she was trying to memorize her face up close. Rio wanted to ask when they would meet again but Agatha’s words had seemed so final. Agatha didn’t ask her to get out of the car and they sat there in silence until Rio’s ride she had ordered arrived. As she went to exit the car she heard Agatha quietly speak, almost too quiet to hear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let me know when you get home safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She nodded and closed the door.</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 16</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio spent the rest of the day researching the ins and outs of iPads. She had noted Agatha’s address and while she had seemed embarrassed about Rio buying her son a gift, the kid had been brave, and made a good point of needing the device.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She input Agatha’s address and hit purchase, it would be delivered within a day. And if Agatha really didn’t want him having it, she could deal with that herself. Before she could move on from her phone, she saw a text from Billy mentioning that Agatha was trying to send her money back. Rio rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Decline her offer.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sighed as she looked up and saw that they were approaching her home, her eyebrow lifting as Lilia’s car sat out front. Lilia was watching Ruffland but she had taken him to her home, why were they back at Rio’s already? She was going to pick him up tomorrow as it was getting late.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She grabbed her suitcase, thanking the man as she took off towards her gate, inputting the code it clicked and she walked through, her suitcase needing to be yanked over the threshold. She made sure the gate secured itself then wandered to her front door. Her eyes rolled as it was already unlocked. Benny and Ruffland tore across the house barking up a storm as she smiled at their antics.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey psychos.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Benny acted like he didn’t remember her for a second, before he sniffed her. Her baby in contrast, instantly sat at her feet, prancing like he really wanted to jump up on her, but knew better… while they had company.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She leaned forward and petted them both before ditching her bags in the main hall, she could unpack later. She walked back towards the kitchen and found Lilia sitting at the table on her laptop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One moment, kiddo.” Lilia continued typing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved to the fridge and got herself a drink. Her hand gripping the top of the can as she moved to sit across from Lilia. The woman finished what she was doing then closed her laptop, leaning forward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have news.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted uncomfortably in her seat. “You didn’t contact me all weekend…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia waved her off. “I knew you were taking some personal time. How did that go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged, her face sullen, Lilia’s lips dipped downward as well. “Oh, Rio. I’m sorry. Was it the NDA? Did she not want to sign it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned her head on her hand and shrugged. “No, she signed that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia looked about, as if trying to decipher what had happened. “She didn’t think you were enough like your characters?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “No… she seemed cool with it just being me. Well,” her eyes looked off to the side in thought. “After her panic attack.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia leaned forward and patted her arm. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her cheek. “I met her kid, it was a bit fast. I think she didn’t like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia squeezed her arm. “Look, </span>
  <em>
    <span>you’re </span>
  </em>
  <span>a good kid. You’re human, there aren’t rules for these things. Some people just don’t remember you’re just a person too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes watered as she sniffed. “I’m not ready to talk about her. It's… fresh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her mentor hummed. “That is fine, because in a moment, you won’t even remember this weekend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes lifted skeptically. “Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia’s face broke out into a shit eating grin. “This is why I came by.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat up straight. “You met with Sharon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia nodded, trying to keep herself from bursting with the news, “I did!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt like she was going to pass out. “And? Is the script good?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia smirked. “It’s more than good, baby. It’s barrier breaking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned closer, her hand reaching for the laptop. “Well, I should prepare for the reading…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia trapped her hand on the table. “She asked me what it would take to get you on the project. They won’t be taking no for an answer.” She just about screamed. “You did it, Rio! You landed a Monument Pictures role!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand covered her mouth as the tears came. “No…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She rubbed at her face as Lilia navigated around the table, ready to wrap her arms around her, Rio standing and launching into the embrace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia giggled. “I know!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook and suddenly Ruffland was headbutting her hard. Her eyes looked down at his worried face. “It’s… a happy panic, dude, I promise.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia released her and indicated the floor. “Let him do his job.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat down carefully, using her dog to get to the floor, then once she was settled Ruffland plopped into her lap and scooted back into her chest. Rio wrapped her arms around him and placed her face in his soft fur as she tried to breathe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio heard Lilia return to her laptop. “It’s a show about witches, queer witches.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snuggled closer to her dog as she continued to listen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The only hiccup is they're struggling to find someone to play your costar and love interest.” Rio’s head lifted slowly. Her mind starting to dissect the details.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia had said they had to have her. Could she make a counter offer?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She cleared the emotions from her voice, “I want something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia’s fingers stopped. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “They said they had to have me. I want… to pick my costar.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia about shit herself, her tone turning to scold the younger girl. “Rio!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “It’s a counter offer…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia groaned. “Do not mess this up for us, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned her best puppy dog eyes on Lilia. “It’s just a request… they can say no…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia grumbled. “They can also decide they don’t want you as badly as they thought they did, at just the drop of a hat…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a breath. “She’s good, Lilia, I’ve seen a small glimpse of her playing with her emotions, she’ll do good work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman leveled her gaze. “Who?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt a little sick. “Agatha Harkness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia’s brows raised. “Who the fuck is </span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness?</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sharon had wanted a self tape of this mysterious unknown that Rio wanted to work with. Rio had pondered for days how to reach out to Agatha again. She hadn’t heard anything further from the woman since she had left, though she had confirmation that the iPad was delivered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She opened her messages with @downyourroad and felt her body tighten with anticipation of reaching out. She sighed. She knew this wouldn’t be an easy sell, and that nothing was guaranteed, but if there was even a chance at getting Agatha out of her situation, and closer to Rio, then she needed to at least try.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She typed a message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I made it home. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched as the message was instantly read.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: days later?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes. Fine so she was pissed. So she didn’t message her right away, she had been busy since she got back. Negotiations with Monument took a second, especially if you were stupid enough to actually come back with terms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: I was busy. I’m sorry, about the late message. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched as Agatha started and stopped typing a few times.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: My son wanted to thank the hospital witch. I tried to return the gift, but there was no way to give it back, apparently.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: He deserved it. It was a present, so he could talk to you without stealing your computer.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: So it was a selfish gift?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore19: whatever helps you sleep at night.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She practically felt the other woman huffing from across the internet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: My son hasn’t stopped talking about you. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled a little at that. She had never thought she was good with kids, but Nicky was different, he was easy to talk to, even when he was sick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: He’s a good kid. I was glad he was feeling better. Speaking of, did you ever get the results?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wondered if she was pushing too much, but apparently inquiring after Nicky was the right thing to say.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: He has a few numbers we need to follow up on, but ultimately he is doing alright now. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip at that concern she felt, but moved to continue on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVialsWhore69: I’m glad he’s relatively okay. Not to change the conversation, but I needed to talk to you. Do you think we could hop on a phone call?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She saw as her message was read and then how nothing came. She blew out a breath. Okay, so Agatha was going to be difficult today.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved to make herself coffee and by the time she was done her phone was beeping with an alert.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyourroad: I tried to send the money back. If you didn’t accept it, that’s on you. I’m not able to stop my whole life for you, until you figure out what you want.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes narrowed…”What I want?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sent back her number, and waited.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had to hand it to Agatha; she really knew how to stonewall her. She moved to her couch and turned on her tv, assuming she wouldn’t be hearing back from Agatha for a while when her phone chirped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@downyouroad: You’re reckless. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked as she sent back a juvenile reply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>@RioVidalsWhore69: You’re reckless.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her phone instantly started vibrating in her hand as she answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard Agatha huff on the other end. “Well, what did you want from me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes. “It’s nothing bad, Agatha, relax.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I signed your stupid paper, what did you do? Lose it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laid down. “No. I filed it with Lilia.” Her eyes drifted to the tv. “Why? Were you planning on doing a tell all interview? Sign a book deal?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She smiled as she heard Agatha scoff. “Please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio played with a piece of her hair. Her voice showed a rare dip into vulnerability. “It wouldn’t be the first time it’s happened to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard the other woman let out a sigh. “Well, too bad I signed that paper then. Anyway, if it’s not about that, then why did you want me to call?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rubbed at the tattoo behind her ear, its presence a reminder of strength, bringing her the comfort she needed right now. She was feeling raw. “Am I not allowed to miss you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s voice was firm. “No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “I don’t think you get to make those decisions for me.” She moved forward before they could continue arguing. “Anyway, I have a proposition for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard the other woman practically deflate. Her voice was careful. “Okay…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio closed her eyes. “I need you to read for a role.” She opened one eye to look at the phone to see if it were disconnected, the clock was still running, staring her back in the face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s voice was hard. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio licked her lips. “Look. I… I saw how you can play with your emotions, the night at the karaoke bar. You’re decently good. There’s this role…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha barked out a laugh. “No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried again. “It’s just a self-tape.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha ground out her words. “I shouldn’t have told you </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything </span>
  </em>
  <span>about me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to center herself, rubbing at her forehead. “Agatha, do you even know why you are so angry with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard the other woman grunt. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Alright, then. Let me have it. What did I do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gasped. “Well, if you don’t know, then I’m not going to explain it to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio closed her eyes again thinking through the weekend. “Was it because I ordered Nicky a blood test? Because I paid for that. I just wanted to make sure he was fully checked out…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha made a sound that appeared to be a poor attempt to cover up a quiet sob. “No… no, I’m not… mad about that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled her knees up to her chest. “I’m sorry. For whatever I did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s breathing was all she heard for a time after that. She let herself listen to the sound and tried to feel comforted by the fact that the woman was still on the phone with her. “Hey, look, it’s a good role, and it’s not like you would have to take it if by some miracle they offered it to you. But you’re good, Agatha, I don’t mind throwing a few auditions your way if it would help you and Nicky move on…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gasped, sounding like she was growing angry. “Stop.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “Agatha. I’m not trying to hurt you. It’s just one video. It’s a short scene. I just need you to read for it. I won’t even watch the video, we can pretend no one ever will if that’s what you want. I just… have a good feeling about this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was quiet as she listened to the sounds of Agatha sobbing. Her heart was pinching. She tried to find more words for the woman, but found her mind had gone blank. After a while she heard Agatha disconnect the call. Her fingers itching to say something else, but not knowing what wouldn’t make it worse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the end, she sent the script. Turning off her phone, she went to take Ruffland for a walk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes burned. Why would Rio send her a script? She didn’t have any experience, she had a college degree. She shook her head. She shouldn't look at it, that part of her, the creative part, died a long time ago. When she had met her wife, and that woman had hated that she wanted to be an actor and a writer. She hugged herself, hoping to stop the creeping prickling feelings that crawled up her spine when she thought of how calculating and manipulative her ex was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had been told she sucked, that her emotions appeared false, even her real ones. She shook her head. What had Rio thought she had seen in her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her fingers inched back over to her phone, opening the script. The words that were seemingly random at first, clicked and suddenly they were jumping off the page when she finished the excerpt. She knew nothing about the character and yet, with this brilliant writing, she felt she knew her intimately. She found that she wanted to know her story.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked around the room. She wasn’t going to do this… but if she did… where could she even film?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky came bounding down the stairs. His bright smile now firmly back in place as he had fully recovered from his illness. “Hey, Mom!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled for his sake, even though she felt like vomiting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nicky. I got… another interview.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy paused. “Oh…” He tried to smile. “Well, that’s great!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked down at her phone then back at him. “They need me to do it today… do you think… that you could distract grandma for a while?” She felt pride swell in her chest as her son looked back up the stairs, his mind already working. “I think I know just the thing.”</span>
</p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span>Agatha came upstairs to grab a glass of water, when she found Nicky bouncing around his grandmother. “I just can’t wait to go to confession today, Grandma! There’s so much sin in the world and my little heart just wants to be good. I hope god listens to my apologies.” He stuck out his bottom lip for good measure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanora patted his cheek as if he was the son of god himself. “My child, you make me so proud. Of course we can go at once, just know it takes time to confess properly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha almost snorted at her son’s faked emotion, he was good. “Grandma, we can be there all </span>
  <em>
    <span>night </span>
  </em>
  <span>if we have to, I just want to learn to do it right.” He grabbed her hand and they began to walk towards the front of the house. Agatha watched them go in awe of her son’s manipulation tactics. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nicolas, where are you off to?” She tried to sound nonchalant. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He grabbed his coat and pulled it on as he took a steading breath. “To clean my soul, Momma. I will pray for you too while we are there. I hope one day the devil leaves us alone. Right, Grandma?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanora held his hand and grabbed her keys scooting them out the door. “You are most certainly a child of god my boy, let us go to the house of the lord.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was left with her mouth hanging open as the door rattled from the slam.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shook her head, her son had surely gotten the acting gene from her, she looked back towards the basement. She wouldn’t have all day. Confession couldn’t take more than an hour or two. She grabbed a glass of water and hustled to the basement. Her closet seemed like the logical place for sound quality. She read the script over and over again, she set up her laptop to record and spent some time work shopping the different ways she could say the lines. She made up her own story in her head for the character as well. She didn’t know the relationship between the two women, but in her head, the scene was heavily charged with sexual chemistry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She cleared her throat and began saying the lines out loud. Imaging Rio on the other end of her harsh planned out words. She delivered the lines until they felt natural and felt like hers. Then she actually recorded. She did three takes and sent the files to Rio, closing her computer down after.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her blood pumping as the creative bug bit her. She had missed this rush, she loved school and all the classes she had to take, the actors and writers she had learned from. She just wasn’t sure it was worth the debt it left her in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked at herself in her bathroom mirror as she tried to ignore the lines that had begun to crease her face. She wished Rio would appear and tell her how beautiful she was, because she didn’t believe the sentiment right now. She reached for her flimsy makeup bag and grabbed a deep red lipstick and drew on her lips. Her eyes flashing in recognition as she felt a surge at dressing up, even just her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took her eyeliner and drew on dark lines, Her blue eyes popping with the stark contrast. She rubbed at her forehead, trying to relax the tension there that was making the lines look more prominent than they really were.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She reached for her phone and took a few photos of her face, her camera painting images she couldn’t see in the mirror. The woman on her phone looked striking, she wondered if that was how Rio saw her. An illusion of herself. Before she could think better of it, she sent the photos off to Rio as well – and watched as Rio read her messages.</span>
</p><p><br />
<br />
<br />
</p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned her phone back on hours later. A few pings caused her to raise her eyebrows. Agatha had gotten back to her. Three audio files, and three video files sat in her inbox. She paused what she was about to do, and clicked play on the first video. Agatha was hiding in a closet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was nervous, but quickly transformed her face and her voice into whoever she was trying to be. Rio was impressed at the switch. She watched as Agatha had guessed right, that the scene was Sapphic in nature. Her lines appeared to drip with tension and frustration. Rio lost herself to the scene and was left blinking as it ended. She shook her head to wake herself up and she watched the next clip, with a similar effect, but it was the last one that broke her heart. The way Agatha’s eye’s bored into the camera, made Rio want to rip out her own heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She downloaded the files and sent them to Lilia, another ping came through. Agatha had sent her photos. She tilted her head, were these comp shots? They were clearly her in the mirror but she looked amazing. Rio sent those too. Manifesting that Agatha would impress Sharon and the Writer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she saved the photos for later. </span>

  <span>CHAPTER 17 - Chemistry </span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to pay attention as Nicky explained to her how confession worked as they sat on the couch in the living room. Agatha combing through his hair with her fingers, praying for the day it was long again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s eyes dropped back towards where his grandmother was cooking as his voice got quiet. “How was the interview, Momma?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let the couch hold her up as she shrugged, “Who knows.” But she leaned forward and kissed Nicky on the head. “Thank you for helping me. We… have a chance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky beamed, whispering. “Anytime, Momma. I’m always by your side.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha ruffled Nicky’s hair as her boy laughed. Evanora appeared in the doorway. “Dinner is almost ready. Nicolas, could you please set the table so we can pray?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky bounded from the couch. “Okay!” Agatha was left shaking her head and covering up her smile at her child’s antics.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanora gave her a hard stare. “You would do well to learn from the boy. He might be able to help you, if anyone can. You should pay attention.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “I was listening to him, Mother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evenora turned her back on her and Agatha groaned quietly. She wasn’t sure how long she was going to make it if she didn’t get out of this house some day soon. Just as she was about to go help her son with the table, her phone rang. She quickly took the route to the basement, locking her door before hiding in the bathroom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman on the other end sounded thrilled she had picked up. “Agatha, I’m glad I caught you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She tapped her nervous fingers on her sink. “I take it you received my files the other day? Are we… done?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio faltered. “Done?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned and sat on the sink. “Yeah… with whatever reason you needed me to do this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “I thought you would be good for the role, </span>
  <em>
    <span>that’s </span>
  </em>
  <span>why I did this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha drummed her fingers harder on the porcelain. “Well, I did it, so it’s time we moved on with our lives.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Are you breaking up with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes flew open. “What? We’re not…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed. “I mean it’s not like you’re my girlfriend or anything, but I had thought we were… seeing each other.” Rio sniffed a bit. “So… you’re seeing someone else, then? That was quick…” her voice hardened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha blanched. “I’m not talking to anyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “What do you call what we did?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “You’ve got to be kidding me. You’re the one that wanted an NDA, it never happened, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice was raw. “I never said that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned her head back against the mirror. “Rio… this is never going to go anywhere…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to clear her throat but did a poor job of it. “Understood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pressed at her chest, why did she feel like she was having a heart attack. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, just… stick to reality.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio couldn’t contain herself anymore she blurted out her news. “They want a chemistry read.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was silent, then her voice was barely audible as she responded. “They…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed, she said it slower. “They… want… a… chemistry read.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gulped. “But I just broke up with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “So, we were a thing. I figured.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rubbed at her forehead. “Why are you telling me this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t hesitate. “Because I want you to get the job, idiot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth opened in shock. “Well… who am I reading with?” She bit her lip and quickly noticed that she tasted metal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Me.” Rio’s voice was steady once more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha clicked her tongue. “Ah.” Her phone started to ring with a face call and she hesitated before accepting it. Rio’s splotchy face coming through. Okay, now Agatha felt worse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We need to do it soon. Shouldn’t be too hard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes darted away from the screen. “I would need to have Nicky get my mom out of the house or… wait until she goes to sleep.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “I don’t have any plans tonight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha jumped as she heard her mother bang on her door. She cursed. “Fuck. Rio, I… I have to go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes rounded. “Will--Will I hear from you tonight?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked back at Rio’s face before she decided, nodding. “Yes, I’ll… message you when the coast is clear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat up with Nicky playing cards in the living room. Evanora had just disappeared to her room for the night. Agatha’s eyes were glued on the hall for so long that Nicky took notice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s the mission?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifted. “Nothing.” She placed her next card on the pile, indicating Nicky. She didn’t know why but she wanted Rio to have to wait on her, like she had needed to wait to hear that Rio had gotten home safe. She had been worried sick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky rolled his eyes. “Is this about… Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes flicked up to meet his. “Why do you think this is about her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He rolled onto his side on the floor, looking at his cards above his head. “Cause, you get moody when you think about her.” Nicky lowered his cards. “Are you in love?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted, throwing a card at her son. “No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky giggled, shaking his head so his hair was less in his eyes. “She’s pretty cool. I like her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You like her because she buys you things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky glared. “I like her because she helped me feel better.” He grumbled. “I worked hard for the iPad so I could talk to you when you leave. You didn’t want me stealing </span>
  <em>
    <span>your</span>
  </em>
  <span> laptop. Remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked back at her cards, releasing a breath, she pondered what she could tell her son. “Rio is helping me look for a job.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s voice brightened. “Cool!” He tilted his head. “Wait, where does she live? Chicago?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged. “Somewhere further.” She tapped the pile for Nicky to place another card. The kid rolled his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay…. So are </span>
  <em>
    <span>we</span>
  </em>
  <span> moving?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed and set her cards down. “I don’t know anything yet, Nicky. She’s just a friend and while she’s been very kind to us… it doesn't mean we can trust her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky let his shoulders drop. His voice was hesitant as he tried to reach out. “Momma?” Agatha hummed and he continued. “She’s not Mommy. She wouldn’t hurt you like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes looked for something in Nicky’s brown ones. “Nicky…” her voice cracked and her son continued.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s your friend. She wants to help you, just… let her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pressed at her temples – if only it were that simple.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky had gone to bed and promised not to interrupt her call with Rio. Agatha grabbed her laptop and moved to her closet, hopeful that the battery would hold for at least a while. She texted Rio and a moment later was sent a link. She followed it on her computer and saw Rio’s face appear on the screen, sitting in what looked like her kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey.” Agatha rolled her shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes roamed all over her screen. “It’s good to see you again.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat with her back against a dresser, “Should we get going?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “I know my lines.” She tapped her head. “Got that photographic memory – remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted, shifting to try and get comfortable on the concrete floor. “That must be nice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, looking a bit sad. “It can be.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha noticed the uncomfortable energy that crackled between them. “Rio… earlier….”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The other woman cleared her throat. “Let’s just get to the reading.” Effectively cutting her off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As you picked up on, this is a Sapphic scene. My guess is that these two are exes, this scene seems charged with a past.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to smile. “Well, I wasn’t aware we were preparing for a role that weekend.” Her smile dropped as Rio leaned her head on her hand, her voice quiet. “We weren’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers navigated to her keyboard as she found the lines. “So how do we do this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was stuck looking at her phone. “We'll read it together a couple times, then record.” She looked up. “Ready?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, she took her hair out of her ponytail and let it fall, tucking one side behind an ear. Launching right in. “What is it that you want?” Her eyes lifted, her voice held such devastation and desperation. She swallowed hard. “I came when you called.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her eyes linger on the phone before her, her eyes tried to lift but failed to rise. Eventually they lifted, “I needed you.” Her voice held a bit of whine to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt the now familiar throbbing in her chest and she pressed down over her heart, hard. “It won’t make a difference.” Her voice took on a quality like she was trying to hold back waves of emotions. “I can’t forgive you for…” her voice cut off as she gasped, her breath coming quickly. “You didn’t need to…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lifted her chin. “Yes. I did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked away. “It doesn’t matter anymore. This power… it’s running out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio watched her carefully, her eyes wandering about her face presumably. “You will die if you don’t stop…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha screamed, to hell with her mother waking up. “Then I do! Who cares!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat back in her seat, taken aback. “I just…” she shook her head. “I do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snarled. “Do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes lifted clearly missing making eye contact. “Care.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes watched as Rio didn’t move. Blue eyes worried after her. She was about to ask if she was alright, she lifted her hand ready to reach out – when she noticed the blinking red light. When had Rio hit record?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes lifted defiantly. “In the end – I always did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio licked her lips. “Scene.” The red light stopped. The screen faded to black. The video call telling Agatha that the meeting had ended and a recording was being created.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was left with her heart racing. Desperately wanting to reach out to Rio and talk to her, but she was too much of a coward and slipped under her covers and closed her eyes, trying to forget the broken way Rio had looked at her and the realization that it wasn’t just about the character she was playing.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER 18</h1><p> </p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s absence. She opened her phone multiple times a day just to see if she had missed anything from the woman, always feeling more disappointed when there was nothing new. She had upset Rio and the woman had still done the chemistry read with her, for <em> her </em>benefit. She sighed as she exited her car, her eyes looking up at her mother’s white home. She wondered if she was ever getting out, a thought that kept affronting her daily since arriving back. She took off her jacket from the hardware store. She let the cold remind her that she was still living. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky had been very good at going undercover with grandma so that she could chase this job Rio had handed to her. She blew out a breath, it would be a miracle if she landed the role. She watched as Nicky waved at her from the window, her chest warming as she waved back. She moved towards the house and tried not to let her steps falter as her mother appeared in the front hall for her arrival.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Mom.” She closed the door and hung up her coat. “It was a cold one today.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora muttered a bible verse under her breath and Agatha toed off her shoes. Trying to avoid a confrontation. Sticking to her child was always a safer topic. “Nicky’s been busy this week.”</p><p> </p><p>Her mother lifted her chin up, as if gloating about the wonderful job she was doing with the boy. “Yes, he’s being confirmed as a member of the church soon.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded as she removed her scarf. “Ah. I see.” She of course didn’t approve of Nicky’s adventure into religion, but they did need a roof over their heads, so what was she going to do but stay silent on the matter? </p><p> </p><p>As she moved past her mother, she threw practiced words over her shoulder. “I’m going to take a quick shower, then I’ll be up to help with dinner.”</p><p> </p><p>Evanora quickly jumped in. “I left you something on your bed. Don’t… rush back.” She left without looking at her again and Agatha knew something was off. She knew it wasn’t going to be something kind, but she figured she could just ignore whatever it was. As she opened her door she felt the breath leave her lungs. Something shiny sat on her bed with a note. She closed her door and locked it. What was her mother playing at?</p><p> </p><p>A small revolver sat on top of her sheets, a note to the right. Her fingers clenched into a fist, not wanting to know at first what her mother was implying. She shook her head and went to shower, her mind not once leaving the weapon sitting idly by in her room. She washed her hair and then poured the soap into her hands, a memory coming up of another time when her wife would join her. She shifted, trying to get away from the memory. “No.” She turned and no one was there. Her hand coming up to her chest. She turned the water hot so that it would burn her. When she couldn’t stand the heat any longer, she made it cold. So cold she was shivering in seconds. </p><p> </p><p>She forgot to rinse her hair and stepped from the shower, letting it run, a towel wrapping around her body. She let her feet carry her back to her bed, not bothering to turn on the space heater though she was freezing. She plopped down and let her fingers reach for the note. No doubt it would be something horrible. She felt ill the moment she started to read.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha, Nicky is finally with god now. Let him have the life he deserves so that one day he will go to heaven. He really deserves so much better than you. I had hoped you would have chosen your way out sooner, but I must ask you to please do what is best for the boy.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The gun has a single bullet. I can keep him busy tonight. May God have mercy on your soul. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha picked up the gun. She moved it to the top of her dresser, after a careful inspection there was only one bullet. She removed it and shook her head. She didn’t want to leave Nicky… did she? She moved to her phone calling the only person she had. </p><p> </p><p>She moved to the opposite side of the room and hid herself between her nightstand and the wall. “Please… pick up… please…” Her mantra got her past the first couple rings when a voice came over the line.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>She tried to keep breathing. “Hey… I’m sorry to be calling…” her ears took in the sounds of people and music. She was trying to come back to reality, but her mind wasn’t right. “Where… Where are you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed. “Out. There’s a new club in LA and I’m… giving it a go.” Agatha felt the tightness in her tone. Maybe Rio wouldn’t miss her either. “Did you… need something?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped, trying to mask her upset. “No… no. I–I’m sorry I bothered you.” She heard Rio cut her off not even a second later. </p><p> </p><p>“Let me find somewhere to talk.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gripped the phone tightly as she pulled her knees to her chest. All she had to do was keep breathing, that was all. She wasn’t alone with her thoughts or her mother’s words, Rio was here with her now. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly the phone went quiet and for a brief moment she panicked that Rio had let her go.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice was hesitant but it was there. “So… what <em> is </em>going on?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha found it hard to speak to her for the first time. Her mind was yelling at her for bothering the important woman. “I’m probably overreacting.” </p><p> </p><p>She heard Rio try again as if the woman was sensing her desperation to hang on. “It’s just me. You can talk to me.” She tried to lighten the mood. “We’re still friends, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, becoming more aware of herself by the moment. Why had she called Rio? “Are we?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio came down the line, her voice firm. “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled. “Okay.” She let one leg stretch out away from her, loosening her grip. “My mother… has requested… that I leave this plane of existence.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gasp was a crack in Agatha’s soul, “That’s not the worst part.” She chuckled sadly. “She would like me to do it tonight… with the … gift she left me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice was low. “Get Nicky, and get out. Now.” Her voice, deadly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s body froze at her tone, she had never heard her like that in real life, maybe in a movie once. She tried to reason with her, “Rio…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio boomed down the line. “Agatha. Get the fuck out of there!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes started to burn as she tried to calm the woman on the other end of the phone. “I don’t… have anywhere to go…” she was cut off.</p><p> </p><p>Rio growled. “I don’t care. I’ll drag you out of that house if I have to, myself.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her lip. “I don’t…” but Rio didn’t let her finish.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re leaving. I’ll get you a room. Matter of fact, you need to be out here in case the job comes through.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook. “But what if it doesn't?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio made an effort to breathe, which seemed like it took a monumental effort. “There will be other roles, you’re good. Like really good, you have a gift. Don’t waste it.” </p><p> </p><p>All Agatha heard in the quiet room were her own soft breaths. Rio’s voice appeared once more, begging her. </p><p> </p><p>“Come to LA.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed lightly. “I don’t have money, remember?” Her head lay on her knee.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t listening to excuses anymore, she was fed up. “You and Nicky will stay with me. Just… get to a hotel close to Chicago tonight and I will do the rest.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her mouth go dry. “Rio, I can’t keep taking from you…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice quieted down, as if she realized that if she didn’t do this right that Agatha might not make it past tonight at all. “You’re not taking, honey. I can give you whatever I want. And what I want to give you, is a way out of that hell hole.” She blew out a breath. “If you don’t leave tonight, I’m flying out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked about the room. “Where… where do I go?” Her mind was racing so fast she couldn’t think. She needed help. What was the next step?</p><p> </p><p>Rio was on the move, voices and sounds filling the phone again. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpered. “Rio… where are you going?” Suddenly the sounds changed to cars honking.</p><p> </p><p>“Home, I need to get you out of there. Just… go find a hotel and I’ll give my card over the phone or something. I’ll book you guys flights for the morning as soon as I get home.”</p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes looked about the room fearful of the future, her eyes locating the gun. “Rio… what do I tell… <em> her?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice was deadly. “I don’t give a fuck what you say to her. Tell her you got the role and have to be there by morning. Or tell her to go fuck herself. Just get out of there or you will see how fucking crazy <em> I </em>can be.”</p><p> </p><p>She stood slowly. “I… will get dressed, grab my things.” She moved to tell Rio she would call her when the woman’s voice was firm.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you dare hang up. Keep me on the line.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha placed her on speaker as she looked around and started to gather her few items, throwing them in her suitcase with abandon. She grabbed her phone and her laptop and moved upstairs quickly. Nicky sat at the kitchen counter making cookies when he looked up and saw her, his face falling.</p><p> </p><p>She stood tall and lowered her voice. “Nicky. Grab your things.”</p><p> </p><p>The boy opened his mouth to ask, then thought better of it. He flew up the stairs, drawers banging as he rushed.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora stood at the counter glowering. “Agatha, think about what you are doing.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice was firm, dropping into her skills she learned in college. “I got the job. We have to be there by morning.” Rio’s lies lingering at the front of her mind. Her head tried and failed to not see the gun in her mind’s eye as she looked away. </p><p> </p><p>Evanora gasped. “You’re not taking Nicolas!” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, practically cackled. “Like hell he is staying with you!” She heard as Nicky dropped his suitcase down the stairs, frantically rushing to get back to his mother. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry!” Nicky said. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pointed at the door. “Get your coat, get in the car.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky nodded and moved quickly, pulling his suitcase along.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to follow him out, grabbing her bags, when Evanora came bursting after her. “What will you do Agatha? You think this friend could actually love you? Your wife didn’t even love you! No one ever could!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze was hard as she stepped into her mother, the older woman bumped back. “I don’t need anyone to love me mother, you taught me that.” She looked her mother up and down as she sneered. “I’ll see you in hell.”</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, she left her mother’s house for the last time.</p>

  <span>CHAPTER 19</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha was exhausted as she arrived at the hotel Rio had located for her. The night was young, but all Agatha wanted was to pass out and forget. She kept moving and going through the motions until the moment when she opened the door to their room, then she finally felt it all hit her. She didn’t want to break in front of Nicky, but her mind was done. She collapsed into a heap on the floor. Nicky’s eyes wide, he quickly called Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman picked up on the first ring and tried to soothe him. “Nicky, listen to me, don’t panic. Your mother will be okay. She just needs to calm down. We just need to be here with her. Can you hold her hand for me? I know you always make things better for her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The little boy quickly grabbed his mother’s hand, holding on. “I got her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio slowed her voice. “Good job. I promise I’ll help you with her. Just hang on for a little bit longer buddy.” The little boy heard typing as Rio tapped on her computer. “Can you put on one of your shows for you and your mom? Can you find the wifi password for the room?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s eyes looked around before his eyes flashed in recognition. “I see the card for the wifi, I’ll get my iPad.” He let his mother’s hand go while he booted up his electronic and navigated to a show, pressing play. He crawled into his mother’s lap, pulling her arms around him, feeling her body shake. “Momma, look we're going to watch a show. Just like old times, for bed, remember? Just to settle down before sleep.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His mother didn’t speak, but she tried to stop sobbing, which took effort. But eventually she was just breathing, holding him tightly, as Rio sat on the phone beside them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nicky?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The kid lifted the phone, “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to have you and your mom do a late check out. I think you’ll both need the rest. If you can remember, tell your mother your flight is tomorrow evening. I’ll send a car to take you and your mother to O’Hare. I’ll have someone from Alice’s cafe pick up your mom’s car…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Little brown eyes stared at the phone, foregoing his show. “Okay. I think I can remember that.” He sighed as he felt his mother lean against the wall, her head dipping slightly. His voice lowered so he wouldn’t wake her. “Hey, Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman on the phone stopped typing. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky had so many questions, and he wanted to ask them all, but when he landed on what he really wanted to say, it wasn’t any of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio's voice was gentle. “You’re welcome, kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky was quiet for a while, his eyes watching the cartoon without taking it in. “Hey, Rio?” He heard a sleepy hum. “Did Momma really get the job?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cleared her voice. “We don’t know yet. Hopefully we will know soon. But it doesn’t matter because you are going to come stay with me for a while until your mom finds something.” After a beat Rio continued. “I have a dog… do you… like dogs? I know you had wanted a puppy…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky smiled. “I never got to have a dog before. Does it… know tricks?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice lifted. “Yeah, he does. His name is Ruffland. He’s funny. I think you two will get along.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky looked up at his mother, scooting out of her hold to grab a pillow and the sheets from the bed, laying her down gently on the floor and covering her up before he slid in with her, propping up the iPad so he could keep watching the colors and movement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m excited to see you tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio practically smiled through the phone. “I’m excited to see you, too.”</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 20</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped out of the back of her taxi with her son. Her eyes staring up at a gated home she didn’t know. Her stomach was in knots. This had been the address Rio had given her. It was in the hills, though Rio insisted that its location near the bottom meant that it wasn’t anything to be impressed with. Agatha let out a puff of air. This house easily cost at least a few million. She tried to settle her feelings but found that she was going to be sick if she so much as breathed too much.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky grabbed his bag and nudged his mother, her eyes finally drifting down to him, his smile bright as he took her hand. “She has a dog!” He pulled his mother and suitcase along as Agatha snatched up her bags with her other hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had been quiet since her breakdown. She found that her hand shook as she reached to call Rio, Nicky taking over without a fuss. Her eyes burned with embarrassment. Maybe once she was able to settle in, she would feel more normal. Her hand rubbed at her chest, relying on another person wasn’t something she was used to, nor did it normally go well, but Rio had said this was temporary. She was just helping her get on her feet. She closed her eyes and prayed to her patron goddess that this was about to go well. When she saw Rio come walking out the front door with a shy smile on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey you two!” She opened the gate and Nicky wrapped his arms around her looking up with a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Rio.” She ran her hand through his hair and stuck out her tongue. The boy repeated the motion back before giggling. Agatha stood quietly by, watching the interaction with intrigue. Her son wasn’t normally so open with others. She watched as Nicky moved to help himself into the house and Rio turned to let her eyes connect with Agatha’s. “Can I help you with that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth opened but before she could protest, Rio took the handle and threw the duffle over her shoulder. “How was your flight?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The other woman walked quickly behind her. “It was fine. I…slept.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio inclined her head as she led them inside, finding Nicky on the floor petting Ruffland. Rio nodded at her son. “Ruffland.” She whistled and the dog looked up panting, Rio pointed. “This is Agatha,” then she pointed at Nicky. “And you met Nicky.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took their bags, “I’ll put these in your rooms.” Agatha looked at Nicky with the dog and upon her analysis that the dog wouldn’t eat her child, she took off her shoes and quickly followed Rio down the hall. “Rooms?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio kept moving, “Yeah, I figured you and Nicky needed your own space. It’s just down the hall,” Her head indicating some stairs up ahead. “My room is up there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha placed her fingers to her lips then raised them to reach out when Rio opened her door and set her bag and duffle inside. “I didn’t have much time to prepare the space, but I hope it’s okay.” Her eyes turned to Agatha while her hands found her back pockets. “It’s got a bathroom.” She looked around, “Did you want me to set up your laptop on the desk?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “I can do that…” She watched as Rio ducked out of the room past her, moving Nicky’s bag to the next room down the hall. Between Agatha’s room and another downstairs bathroom. “Nicky’s room is right here, I grabbed a couple of things, I didn’t know what he would like. We can still take him to the store later…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha peaked into the room and rubbed at her neck. “Rio… when you said you didn’t have money…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “I don’t… in comparison to my peers. I can’t,” She let her eyes widen for a moment, “Like go </span>
  <em>
    <span>crazy</span>
  </em>
  <span> or anything. I have to watch my budget.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved her long hair behind an ear. “I’ll pay you back once I find work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio closed her eyes. “Agatha, I’m fine. None of this has been outside my spending limit. Trust me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lifted her arm to lean on the doorway. “I can’t like… afford a bigger place than this. I put most of what I make into investments and I try to live off of that.” She shrugged. “I just can’t jet off on vacations and wear only designer brands. I didn’t…” she shrugged, looking at the floor. “Want you thinking that I could give you whatever your heart desired… cause I have totally dated </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>girl.” She scooted past Agatha. “I’ll get started on lunch, are pizza rolls okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned back against the wall. “Yeah… that sounds great.” As Rio left her on her own, she moved into the room and sat down on the bed. The sheets were soft, the comforter cozy. She decided she would just lay down for a moment, when she fell into a dreamless sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was dark when Nicky woke her up, his little lips kissing her on the temple. “Goodnight, Momma. I’m going to go to bed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked around confused but nodded. “Goodnight, Nicky.” As he left, she pushed herself up, the room feeling slightly less foreign than earlier. She opened her suitcase and grabbed a pair of sweatpants and a cotton shirt. Hopeful that a shower would help her feel more at ease. She wandered into the bathroom and found that the towels were all purple, her eyebrows rising at the detail before discovering that Rio had stocked the bathroom with essentials. She turned on the water and hopped in, taking in the scents that had her mind jumping back to her night with Rio. Her stomach tightening. Her eyes closed as the only sounds in the bathroom became her breathing. She let her hand start at her neck and slide down to her chest. Her body coming back online.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She groaned as she grabbed at her own breast. Her mind had clocked Rio’s couch as she walked in, the same couch the woman had imagined Agatha bending her over on. She mewled. She wanted to do that, but she also wanted someone to take control of her right now. Her life felt so out of control since her wife kicked her and Nicky out. She just wanted someone to make sure she didn’t fall any further.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let her hand drift down her stomach when she heard a sound in her room, her door opening. She felt her heart rate speed up further. Rio was looking for her. She turned to the shampoo and quickly moved to clean her hair. She knew she had had a long travel day and she didn’t need Rio seeing her like this. She moved quickly even as her crotch was throbbing in need. She moved to soap herself, finding a fresh razor she cleaned up her body. She rinsed off and conditioned her hair. Wondering where Rio had gone to, or if she was waiting in her room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved to turn the water off as she wrapped herself up in a fluffy towel. Her hair still dripping as she moved to peek out of the bathroom, her room was undisturbed. She closed the door and started to dry off, quickly locating some hair lotion then wrapping her hair back in a towel. She moved to set her suitcase on the floor as she found clothing. She pulled out her lace thong and left herself braless as she pulled on her t-shirt and her sweats. This would have to do. She toweled off her hair until it was mostly dry, then she went in search of Rio, needing a distraction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat in her bed reading on her phone, a new story had just dropped. Did Agatha still wish for her to write her one? Because she could…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard her door open as she saw Agatha slip into her room, a smile on her face. Rio set her phone aside. “How did you sleep?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged. “I would assume well if I was out for hours.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved closer to the end of the bed. “Did you wanna… talk?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. She leaned down and grabbed Rio’s face with both hands, capturing her lips. Rio gasped as she let herself be kissed for a moment before she pulled back. “Agatha… you ended things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes rolled. “And now I’m in your house…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “We can be friends.” Brown eyes settled on the bed as her fingers played with the sheets.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat down searching her face, taken aback. “You’re over me? Just like that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip as she tried to tame her smile at the insinuation. “I’m not over you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha seemed to like that answer as she moved to straddle her lap, as Rio leaned back on her hands. “Agatha…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman on top of her lifted a hand to cup her jaw, a thumb brushing over Rio’s lips. “I don’t want to think tonight.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio raised a hand and ran it up and down Agatha’s side. “Okay…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman leaned forward and captured her lips again, and as she ground into Rio’s lap the dark haired beauty let out a quiet moan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled into her lips, relieved. “So you </span>
  <em>
    <span>did </span>
  </em>
  <span>miss me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes were lidded as she nodded at her, her mind rushing with feelings. Feelings Agatha didn’t want to deal with, she knew that, so she kept her mouth shut and kissed her. Her lover quickly noticed that she was distracted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you need, Rio?” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked her eyes rapidly as she shook her head. “I’m just glad you and Nicky are okay.” She swallowed. “I’m open to whatever you need right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat back, moving off of Rio’s lap. “You don’t want sex?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “I’m down if that’s what you need, but we could also just… relax. Or… cuddle.” She bit her lip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted, crossing her arms. “I don’t cuddle.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “Well, I know that’s not true.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned back and Rio grabbed her wrist. “Don’t go… please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman froze then settled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes were wet. “The couch is just in the other room you know,” She tried to lighten the mood but wasn’t successful, “but I don’t think we should do that while Nicky’s home.” She tried to smile at her joke and her hand quickly lifted to wipe away her own tears, though the brunette had seen them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes watched her with sadness. “You…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “You scared me, alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat there watching Rio for a few moments before she pulled her lover to her. Rio’s face pressing firmly into her shoulder. Agatha was never great at words, so she just held Rio, finding that maybe she needed this too. Her mind settled as she was pulled down to the bed. The other woman was laying her head on her chest. Agatha’s hand came up to play with her hair as she stared at the ceiling, long after Rio had begun to snore.</span>

  <span>Rio opened her eyes, feeling around for Agatha. Upon noticing that the space beside her had gone cold, she wondered if Agatha and Nicky were even there with her or if all of that were some weird dream. Her eyes glanced at her partially opened bedroom door. Ruffland never let her sleep in this late. She stood and grabbed a hoodie, padding down the hall towards the kitchen, soft sounds starting to come into focus.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Momma, do you think Rio would let me play with Ruffland in the yard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes landed on Agatha, who was cooking at the stove. It wasn’t like she minded, though she did wish she would have been around to be a part of the morning routine. She wouldn’t have minded helping.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha addressed Nicky. “You’ll have to wait until she’s awake to ask her. Did you find the dog's food?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded. “The food in the fridge had his name on it. I wasn’t sure how much to give him so I only gave him a little.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cleared her throat and all eyes in the room fell to her. “Morning.” She smiled as Ruffland came over and licked her hand. Her eyes crinkling at the affection. “Hey baby, did someone feed you this morning?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky came over and bounced on his toes. “Is Ruffland allowed to play ball in the backyard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. She had a feeling her dog had found his new best friend. “Yes, did you two want to go play?” He nodded and took off for the back door, the dog hot on his heels. Rio crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow at the woman at the stove. “I could have made us something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned back to what she was cooking, trying to keep busy. “I figured I could help, especially with you letting us stay here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved to her side and rubbed at her back, noticing how Agatha twitched. Rio took her hand away and cleared her throat. “Sorry, I ruined the mood last night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged. “It’s fine. You had a rough night.” She continued moving food around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip, she hoped she wasn’t messing things up already. “I think it was you who was having a rough night.” She moved to get the juice from the fridge, wondering desperately if there was more she could be doing to help the Harkness family feel at home. “Is there anything else you and Nicky need?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s shoulders dropped, her voice going quiet. “You’ve done enough.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her hair fall forward, leaning against the counter. Her shoulders shrugging. “I don’t mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved the plate of eggs off of the burner next to the pancakes. “I’m not used to… kindness.” She wrung her hands as she avoided Rio’s gaze. “I’m trying to understand.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved to get the plates and fix the kitchen table, making herself useful. “I didn’t always have the easiest life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha crossed her arms a thought hitting her. “I must admit, you are pretty stingy on personal details in interviews.” Blue eyes studying the dark haired beauty at the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes, wiggling her fingers at Agatha. “I cast my spell, people laugh, everyone’s happy. And no one knows too much about me.” She took a deep breath, letting it out slowly as her eyes moved back to plates. “I like it that way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved the rest of the food to the table. “I can understand that. I don’t like to talk to people about my life either. Too many opinions if you talk to other people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned up and kissed Agatha on the corner of the mouth, the woman turning slightly to chase the feeling before Rio smirked and moved away. So she did want some physical affection, Rio took notes. “I’ll go get Nicky.” She ran her hand down Agatha’s arm as she disappeared to get the boys.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat down feeling off center. Rio let Nicky pick where he wanted to sit, then gave Ruffland a bit of a snack. Breakfast was decently quiet, Nicky and Rio had an in depth conversation about bugs in California, as Agatha zoned out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio noticed her phone flashing out of the corner of her eye and raised a hand indicating she would just be a moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lilia, hey, what’s up…” she started to leave the room when she paused in the doorway. “She’s here, actually.” Her eyes returned to the woman at the table. She walked quickly back, putting the phone on the table on speakerphone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes flashed at hearing her name. “He-llo?” She fought to quickly swallow the food that was in her mouth, trying not to choke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman over the phone came through again. “It’s Lilia, Rio’s agent. How are you, dear?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She ran her hand through her dark brown hair. “I’m… I’m good. How… how are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia dove right in. “We need to discuss some details about your audition. Do you have an agent, dear?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes lifted to Rio who was talking quietly with Nicky, trying not to listen. Agatha shook her head. “No… Ma’am. I sort of… haven’t found anyone yet. Rio only suggested I start reading for things recently.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia tutted. “Well, this role is a very big deal, Miss Harkness. Rio has been working very hard to land an opportunity like this one. Perhaps we should speak in private.” Rio raised an eyebrow but Agatha didn’t look her way instead, she stood on unsteady legs and took the woman off speaker as she wandered into the tv room. “I understand. I have… moved to a different room.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Miss Harkness, since you are starting out, my fees are higher than they are for Rio. She’s been a client for a very long time, but on her word that you possess a great talent, I would like to represent you.” </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>Agatha’s hands shook. “That, that would be great. Thank… thank you very much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia snorted. “Rio, is a dear friend of mine. Don’t hurt her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt sick. “I… I won’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia tutted. “Good. This role, should you book it, is directly opposite her. As you can imagine, if you book this, a lot is about to change. Everyone wants to be famous, Miss Harkness, no one understands what that actually means until they are in it. Before we continue, you won't be able to live life as if you are invisible anymore. Someone will recognize you no matter where you go, your son will be recognizable, despite our best efforts. Your association with Rio will be speculated by some and ignored by others. Speaking of, what are your intentions with Miss Vidal?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt like she was meeting Rio’s mother all of a sudden, the realization crashing all around her like treacherous waves in a storm. “I… I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia’s voice hardened. “Don’t lead her on, Miss Harkness. If you don’t love her. Keep it moving, keep it professional.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha remained quiet as Lilia spoke again. “I have a meeting with Sharon tomorrow. I will hopefully know something about their decision on your involvement. If it’s a no, I have two other projects I would like you to read for, but I want to keep you available for this one first.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha almost asked who “Sharon” was, but held her tongue. “Yes, Ma’am.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia started typing. “Good talk. I need to go. Tell Rio I said I will see her tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. “I will.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia sighed. “How long will you be staying with her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stalled, but before she could find an answer, Lilia excused herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh hell, what is Taryn doing? I gotta go. Talk tomorrow.” The line went dead.</span>

  <span>Chapter 22 </span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha had been in her head the rest of the day. She had cleaned up the kitchen then retreated to her room. Rio and Nicky had asked if she wanted to watch a movie with them, but she declined, saying she didn’t feel well, that she had a headache. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She received a text soon after, a photo showing her that Rio had left her painkillers and fluids outside her door. She rolled her eyes as she retrieved them. Settling in bed, she grabbed her laptop and pulled up a search for apartments, the amounts on even the studios were quite a bit outside of her assumed range. She wished she had asked Lilia how much the role paid, but figured it didn’t matter as long as it was something better than she was making before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She cuddled under her blankets and quickly nodded off again. She sighed upon waking, realizing that she had never felt this tired before in her life. She wondered if it was because for once, she felt she could breathe and let her guard down to sleep. She blew her hair from her face as she checked her phone. A photo of food in the fridge, for her, warmed her heart. Rio had taken care of Nicky again. She bit her lip. She wasn’t hungry. Not yet, but she started to text Rio, cringing at the time. How had she slept that late?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Thank you for making dinner. I’m… sorry I slept the day away… again.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio: It’s alright. Nicky helped me cook. Then he took a shower and went to watch a movie in his room. I checked on him a while ago and he’s knocked out. You two deserve some good rest.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha settled back into the bed wishing she knew what to write to keep the conversation going.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio got ready for bed and saw her phone flash. Agatha was writing to her again. She sighed when she noticed the woman was wanting to make an effort to engage but wasn’t sure how. She glanced toward her bedroom door before she responded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Did you want me to come keep you company? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stopped writing and Rio let her head fall back slightly. She didn’t know what the right answers were when it came to Agatha. She locked her phone and decided to make some tea, then seek her out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She knocked on Agatha’s door not long after the kettle had boiled enough for tea. When the woman didn’t appear, she tried the door knob, it opened. She ducked her head in and saw Agatha leaning up against the headboard watching her phone intently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a step inside and noticed Agatha jump at the sound. “I made you something to drink.” She offered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes looked about trying to make room for her, scooting over slightly. Rio smirking at the attempt, before going to hand Agatha her drink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you want company?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged. “You’re already here. I’m not going to tell you what to do in your own home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes as she slid in next to Agatha, the woman tensing as Rio looked at her phone. Her eyes took in a very different version of Agatha. “Is that when you were carrying Nicky?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took in a shaky breath. “Yeah… I looked…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned her shoulder into Agatha’s. “Cute.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gaped at her. “Cute? Ew. No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio giggled. “I’m pretty sure you looked normal, I hear people have to accommodate a living being in their body to have a baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha glared at Rio as the raven haired woman lifted her hands in surrender. “Hey, it’s not an interest of mine, but…” she took a sip of her drink, shrugging. “Your kid’s cute.” Her eyes flashed in panic. “Not that I want one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “Ah, so you haven’t been trying to knock me up? Could have fooled me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. “No.” Her eyes drifted back to the phone, taking it and flipping through the photos, even though Agatha pouted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How was it, carrying Nicky?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned her head back on the headboard, her shoulders collapsing. “Painful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes lingered on the phone. “Well, I hear that’s normal, too. At least you got what you wanted in the end.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked around carefully before she whispered her admission. “I… didn’t want children.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes turned to her, her lips turning downward. “Then why…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha clasped her hands in front of her before studying her fingers. “Tori… did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand reached for Agatha’s. “Then why did you,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to swallow her tears. “Isn’t that what you do when you love someone?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes drifted back to the phone, her heart stopping. More pieces of the woman before her clicked into place in her mind. Her voice was soft as she reached out. “No, Agatha. That’s not the only way to love someone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s finger flipped to a different photo, trying to distract from her darker feelings. Deep down she knew Tori’s love was wrong, that things weren’t right. She never felt great, but she had thought that was just love. That she needed to just live with it, because someone had finally taken an interest in her. And Tori had been beautiful and powerful, and she had loved Tori so much that she was willing to hurt herself to prove it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pointed at the next photo hoping to distract Rio, “I was huge.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “I stand by what I said. You’re still adorable.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cringed. “The hormone injections really got to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes continued to study the images, realizing that Agatha didn’t seem happy. “IVF?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. “Yep. Tori wasn’t… happy that I struggled to have Nicky. We really pushed the limits on what my body could handle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tapped on Agatha’s thigh, trying to take it all in. Her own admission slipping past her lips. “So, I don’t… like kids.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widened. “I… I’m sorry. Nicky can stay in his room… I’ll make sure his things are always put away.” She threw off the covers to make sure that Nicky’s things were out of sight, when Rio caught her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha. Stop. That’s not what I meant. I… I like Nicky.” She held her gaze, “A lot. He’s different.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes were wary. “Children are a lot, and I don’t want to burden you.” She finished off leaving plenty unsaid. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “Let me try that again. I like </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>child.” She handed Agatha her phone back. “He reminds me of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her eyes fall to the bed. “You’re…very good with him.” She bit her cheek. “Makes me jealous sometimes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “I’m just new, and a big kid at heart. I’m just his friend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rubbed at her arms. “I’m sorry we invaded your life. I promise we won’t stay long…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio crossed her legs and leaned back on her hands. “Don’t do that. I was going to ask you to come anyway. Both of you, I just… got nervous.” She shrugged when Agatha’s eyes grew wider. “You thought I was already overstepping when I met him. I was worried you would stop speaking to me altogether if I suggested you move here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rubbed at her face. “It isn’t the easiest thing to do.” She closed her eyes as she felt Rio’s hands weave into her hair. Her voice fading as she was taken over by the feeling. “I’m sure I’ll get used to the idea.” She moaned as Rio started to scratch at her scalp.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re a good mom, Agatha. Nicky is lucky to have you.” She continued her movements as she took in Agatha up close, the lines of her jaw, the soft and long lashes at her eyes, the way she tried to swallow down her emotions. How she wished she could see her crystal blue eyes right now, but she wasn’t about to take away Agatha’s comfort, not so she could have what she wanted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes tried to memorize everything about Agatha, from her hair color, the multiple dimensions to it, to her skin tone, to the lines on her skin – which had lessened since she had gotten more sleep. Her heart clenched, as visions of a future she desperately wanted came uninvited. Her mind making sure the connection to her mouth was severed, she didn’t need to be scaring this woman off the moment she got there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened her eyes and caught Rio staring, her cheeks flushing. “Stop looking at me like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes settled on Agatha’s bright blue. “Like what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt as Agatha’s eyes pierced into her soul. “Like you want me here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio affirmed her worst fears. “I do want you here.”</span>

  <h1>
  <span>CHAPTER 23 - Congrats</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stretched and felt around the bed. The sheets felt slightly different than she was used to. Her messy bed-head popped up to take in her environment. One of her guest bedrooms… No. It wasn’t anymore, it was Agatha’s room now. Her eyes froze on Agatha’s back sitting at the desk bathed in sunlight. Hunched over her head resting in one hand as she drew with a pencil in the other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried not to breathe her eyes watching in awe as Agatha created in her drawing book. She noticed how Agatha tensed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You stopped snoring.” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s face lit up amused. “I don’t snore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed quietly. “You do.” Her eyes didn’t leave her work.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio figured since Agatha already knew she was awake, she could push her luck and try and get closer. She crawled across the bed on her hands and knees, before shifting her legs off the bed to stand. She walked the couple feet to Agatha and wrapped her arms lightly over her shoulders. Her eyes taking in the artwork, her breath unsteady.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha continued to draw though her body relaxed under Rio’s warmth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha, that’s amazing.” She fought the urge to touch the image. “You really made my eyes look… alive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman continued to trace the graphite around the paper. “Your eyes are prettier.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned her chin on Agatha’s shoulder. She didn’t see how that could be possible. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Your</span>
  </em>
  <span> eyes are prettier.” She pulled Agatha’s hair away from her neck as she added a kiss to her sensitive skin, feeling her twitch slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked back at the image. “Which of my characters is she?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's hand drifted down to her drawing’s neckline, no outfit revealing that detail yet. Her lips hesitated before she let the truth out on a whispered breath. “You.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved to kiss her cheek. Agatha shifting away. “She’s not done yet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The younger woman squeezed her shoulder as she moved. “Well, I can’t wait to see when she is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She left Agatha to her creative solitude as she readied herself for the day back in her bathroom. Nicky found her quickly enough. “Hey, Rio?” She lightly jumped at the sound, her hand pressing on her chest to still her heart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He shuffled his feet, “Sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned around leaning on her vanity. “Don’t sweat it, I’m cool. What did you want to talk about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He chewed at his lip before he spoke. “Your phone has been ringing. I was going to tell you sooner… but you and Momma were… cuddling.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes went wide. “Oh. Thank you, Nicky. I’ll check it in just a moment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He nodded as he bounded off. A moment later she heard Ruffland play growling, he must have tricked Nicky into a round of tug-o-war. She shook her head, her dog was a master manipulator. She finished what she was doing and wandered to the kitchen, where the boys were playing as she picked up her phone, her hand covering her mouth quickly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh my god.” She saw the moment Nicky turned, concerned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lowered her hand. “Nicky… you can’t say a word to your mother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The little boy held her gaze. “I can keep a secret.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio motioned for him to come to her as her eyes watched the hall. “Okay, so this is like a very big deal for your mom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded, looking at the phone and seeing too many words. “Okay. Did she get the job?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded excitedly. “She did!” she squealed quietly. “We should… find a special way to tell her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded, placing his finger to his chin in thought, before he raised it. “A cake.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stood then shrugged. “That’s as good of an idea as any. We should run to the store.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she was about to tell Nicky to grab his coat, Agatha came wandering in, her steps quiet. “What is everyone doing in here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s lips pursed as she tried to think up a lie, while Nicky excitedly started to bounce. “Rio said we can get stuff to make a cake!” He ran up to his mom and threw his arms around her. Her bright blue eyes went even bluer, unless Rio was hallucinating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh she did, did she?” Her eyes turned to Rio’s. “What’s the occasion?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged, keeping her face clear of emotion. “Kid said he liked cake.” She pointed towards the front room. “If you’re coming, you better get your coat.” The little boy bounded off. Rio adjusted her hair. “Figured you could use the peace and quiet to keep drawing while we did the boring stuff at the store.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes fell. Her hand moving her hair behind her ear. “That’s nice of you.” Her fingers playing with her lip. “I was… going to take a break.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio watched as Agatha faltered. “Did you, want to come?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes lifted. “I mean… if you two wouldn’t mind? I was… getting lonely. I have spent quite a bit of time sleeping.” Her pointer finger indicating her room down the hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio readjusted Agatha’s hair behind her ear as it had fallen, blue eyes looking up at her. “Totally cool.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands landed on Rio’s hips but quickly slipped away the moment Nicky came thundering back. Her eyes closed, “Nicky, walk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy slowed immediately as he heard her tone. “Sorry, Momma. Sorry, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned Agatha around. “You need to go grab your coat too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes rolled. “It’s like sixty degrees out, I’m practically melting as it is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorting at the Midwesterners in her kitchen. “Okay, well </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> am putting a coat on, at least grab one of my hoodies from my dresser, I promise it will be chilly out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha disappeared down the hall as Rio moved to the coat closet, taking out a dark green puffer jacket. Her eyes glanced up to thank whatever gods or goddesses were listening for her little comment, because the sight of Agatha in her black hoodie was the cutest thing she had ever seen. She kept her thoughts to herself as they got in the car and ventured to the store. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She noticed Agatha felt out of palace as they shopped, Nicky and Rio trying hard to get her input on the cake. Blue eyes trying to remain passive but Rio could tell something was bothering her. Did it have to do with their conversation last night?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s dark eyes clocked a flower and gift shop as they drove home. She texted Billy that she needed him to pick up a few things. Some flowers as well as place an order for a watch she had seen recently that had been totally Agatha, and in her favorite purple. She would try and swing by and pick both up from him later, that was unless he had time for a delivery. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio and Nicky set to work in the kitchen, shooing Agatha away as they started to bake. The woman looked a bit hurt as she stood in the doorway for a while before heading off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio and Nicky created an array of different purples for the layers, infusing sprinkles of blue moons and stars everywhere they went, both getting very messy in the process. The icing was a bit runny but they made it work. Finally drawing vines and roots all over the cake. Nicky bit his tongue as he focused, endearing him even more to Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When they were done, they high fived and Rio found some paper for them to make a card, setting Nicky loose at her desk in her room while she cleaned up the kitchen and waited for Billy. Her eyes glued to her phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt her before she heard her, her lover hovering by the kitchen entryway. “Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The girl didn’t look up as she gave some small vocal indication that she had heard her. Her eyes finally saw the note from Billy that he was almost there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did I do something wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes shot up as Agatha’s voice trembled. “Because…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “Stop, what has gotten into you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “Maybe it’s the hormones…” She took a step back. “Menopause.” she shrugged. She rubbed at her stomach. “I just can’t shake the feeling that…” her words faded as the doorbell rang. Her eyes chasing the sound. “Were you expecting someone?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved forward and patted her arm in passing, “Stay here, we’re not done with this conversation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio opened the door and chipper little gay boy Billy stood bouncing on the balls of his feet. “Morning, Rio!” After a quick glance at his watch he shook his head laughing. “Or afternoon! So I picked it all up, then… I added something a </span>
  <em>
    <span>little </span>
  </em>
  <span>extra.” He grinned. “This little bunny plush was just </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>cute I couldn’t stand it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. Well, she hopped Agatha like rabbits. “Sweet, Billy, Thanks for doing that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He handed it over carefully, “No problem! So the flowers are exactly what you asked for, minus, the one I had to swap out because you totally asked for a flower that meant death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cringed. “Ah, again?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy nodded. “Yeah, not very, congratulations my love. More like, I’d like to see you six feet under, horizontal, in a grave.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Fair enough.” She let her nose sniff the bouquet as she set the present bag down that presumably held the watch and bunny. She sighed. “This is wonderful, good teamwork.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She leaned on the doorway. “So… where is boyf today?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>BIlly blushed, “Across town in studio city, at dance rehearsals.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio winked. “Eddie is a lucky guy, I hope he’s working hard. You guys have any plans this weekend?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, we’re going to check out that Ocean Club in Santa Monica, the back room with your connection.” He tried to suppress his grin. “Just like… try not to need me tonight?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio crossed her heart. “You got it. I’ll make myself scarce.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy looked up when he saw the woman he had Venmoed enter the hall. He gave a little wave. “Ah, so you did get her to yourself after all?” He winked. “Classic, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She rolled her dark eyes before pushing at his shoulder. “Get out of here, I’ll introduce you another time.” He saluted her as he skipped to his car. Rio shook her head and closed the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s chin was raised as she avoided her eyes. “And who is </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Her voice ticked up at the end, in thinly veiled alarm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio hid the flowers behind her back and scooted the present under the entrance table. “No one.” Her face was tense. “Go back to the other room.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked her up and down before she spun on the balls of her feet, bypassing the kitchen and heading for her room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s mouth dropped open as she set the flowers down on the table. “Agatha!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman didn’t slow down and Rio watched as she moved her hand to wipe at her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span>“Agatha, would you stop!” Rio’s voice was frustrated. “It’s just Billy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned with her eyes narrowed. “Just, Billy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stopped where she was as she felt that Agatha would launch at her if she came any closer. “Yeah… my assistant?” She pointed at Agatha. “The same kid that wired money to you, for me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha crossed her arms. “How nice for him. Is he even legal?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio raised her eyebrows as if Agatha had gone insane. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman gripped herself tighter. Rio raising a hand. “Okay, I don’t know what </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>was but…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha started to tap her foot. “You’re hiding things.” She pressed her fingers to her forehead. “He brought you flowers…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a step towards Agatha, her hands held out in surrender. “Yes, as I asked him to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tensed as Rio moved closer still. “Why would you ask him to?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her fingers lightly wrap around Agatha’s arm when she got close enough. “Me and Nicky have a surprise for you. Can you… just give me a chance to show you before you bite my head off about my affections for my </span>
  <em>
    <span>very gay </span>
  </em>
  <span>assistant?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha deflated. “He’s gay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Could you not see his eyeliner from down the hall? He’s wearing pink eyeshadow today too.” She deadpanned. “Just my type, a fairy twink.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I just thought…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned forward into her space and cupped her cheek. “Stop thinking.” Agatha huffed and Rio eased the other woman’s arms from around herself. She lifted her voice and called out for Nicky who yelled back from down the hall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Almost, ready!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers came to her mouth as she started to bite at her nails, but Rio intercepted them before she could cause damage. “Come with me.” She took her back down the hall and placed her at the kitchen table. Leaving her there as her and Nicky gathered the items. Moving to place them on the table in front of Agatha, as blue eyes looked on in horror. Rio was not accustomed to her emotions, but if her son’s reactions were anything to go by, then it seemed Agatha would be alright momentarily.</span>
</p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha settled her hands in her lap as she looked expectantly at the two people before her, waiting. Nicky looked to Rio and with a nod he handed the card to his mom, before he grunted taking it back quickly and shoving a pen into Rio’s hands, she quickly understood and signed it before handing it back to him. He then shoved it back into his mother’s outstretching fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There. Read it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha couldn’t breathe, why had they done this for her? She opened the card and her eyes scanned the words not quite understanding. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Congratulations? For what?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Her eyes lifted to her son and Rio, shrugging. “What is this for?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio patted Nicky on the back and he blurted out. “You got the job, Momma!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She froze, her eyes blinking steadily. “What…” Her gaze lifted to Rio’s. “What does he mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio squatted before her, taking her hand. “I got an email from Lilia this morning, asking if I wanted to tell you the news. So… welcome to The Forest with me, Agatha!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood immediately, her hands covering her face. Nicky wrapped his arms around her as Rio leaned in and the moment Agatha’s hands fell away she kissed her lips. Rio’s face was momentarily stunned when she realized she hadn’t asked if she could in front of Nicky, she relaxed a second later when Agatha pulled her back in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sound of Nicky gagging brought them back to the present. “Ew. Grown ups are weird.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha kept her hand on the back of Rio’s neck as she glared at her son. “You’re weird.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He turned and pointed to the flowers. “Rio and me picked these for you! And we made a cake! And Rio got you a gift.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled as she continued to cry. “Oh… that was… sweet.” Rio rubbed at her back as if sensing her need for touch in the moment, being proven right the moment Agatha leaned into her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled the chair back out and helped her settle into the seat. “My… darling.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha noticed the hesitation, as if Rio had meant to say something else, she let it go. Watching as her son pointed to the flowers and Rio recited their meanings. She placed the bag in Agatha’s hands as everyone sat around the table. Careful fingers removing the tissue paper with care. Blue eyes lighting up when she saw the stuffed bunny, bringing it up to hug it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky looked at Rio with a smirk. “Momma loves bunnies.” Rio wanted to fucking high five Billy for the impulse buy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers dipped back in slowly and came away with a small rectangular box, her fingers hesitant to open it. Rio waited expectantly, holding her breath as she did. A thick deep purple watch with a silver face staring back at her. Rio took the watch from the box and turned around the device so Agatha could see the inscription. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness. The Forest. 2024.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers ghosted over the engraving. Her eyes lifted to Rio’s as they creased. Rio moved to fix it to her wrist as Nicky got out candles for the cake. Agatha’s lips quivered with words she didn’t know how to say when Rio took the offered lighter and lit the candles. “Make a wish, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bright blue eyes shown with a happiness they had never known before as she closed her eyes, savoring the moment, then blew them out.</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 24 </span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat on the couch with one knee up in the air. Her fingers dancing across the keyboard as her eyes took in the prices on the rentals around LA, she would be lucky if her and Nicky could even afford a studio in Sherman Oaks. Though she wondered if she could afford the gas because while the travel to the studio seemed like it shouldn’t take that long, every time she looked up the commute it was well over an hour. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She chewed on her lip, about ready to bust it open when she heard Rio come in the front door. As her blue eyes looked up she noticed that the woman was preoccupied flipping through her mail. Agatha’s eyes went back to her laptop to continue falling into her panic when Rio plopped down on the couch beside her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you looking at?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged, her teeth releasing her lip. “Just, trying to plan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brown eyes took in the apartment search before her. “Ah, yeah those are… about right for the area. You don’t want to live there though, the commute is way too far.” She patted Agatha’s thigh as she stood. “Won’t be a good idea once you have fans either, way too accessible.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched her wander off to the kitchen before she herself closed her laptop and followed, trying to sound aloof and failing miserably.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So… when… when do we get paid?” she crossed her arms and leaned against the doorway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved about grabbing some weed soda from a top shelf, turning, she handed one to Agatha. “Generally, a few months after filming. Usually a lump sum, but sometimes they put us on a payment schedule.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved to wander towards the backyard when Agatha followed close behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So… how do people, live, while they wait for that money to come in?” Agatha was starting to wonder if this all was a good idea. From what she was understanding it seemed like she would be relying on Rio for quite some time, and she wasn’t sure how comfortable she was with that idea. She was growing nauseous. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s gaze lifted as she opened her soda. “Well, sometimes your agent floats you, sometimes your friends do, and sometimes you write it into your contract.” She took a sip looking Agatha up and down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you need something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked away playing with her watch. It wasn’t lost on her how expensive it must have been, everytime she looked at it she wondered why Rio had bothered. She did love the color though, she just wished it didn’t make her feel so quilty that Rio had spent her hard earned money on something so beautiful. She bit the inside of her cheek as she worried about whether she should have declined Rio’s gifts. Eventually the woman would get tired of her. “I just… don’t want to overstay my welcome,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest fell. “Agatha.” She noticed Agatha hadn’t opened her drink and she swapped hers for the unopened one and Agatha instantly gulped some down, Rio’s eyes bugged out. “I gotta say, these hit hard if you chug them, maybe be careful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed at the drink in her hand, blanching at the words. “THC?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “Yeah… it helps me relax. I’m sorry, did you want something else?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose. “Great.” She shook her head, lifting her drink to cheers, then drank more. Luckily weed didn’t make her anxious so that was one less problem she needed to worry about. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached for Agatha’s arm, her movement hesitant. Her thumb moving across Agatha’s skin in a soothing gesture. “Did you… not want to stay here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes avoided hers as she lifted one shoulder. Feeling uncomfortable bringing up the rest of her concerns. “It’s not just about where to stay, I have other… expenses.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, watching Agatha carefully. “Okay. Like?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed as she noticed she had Rio’s full attention. She nodded her head down the hall but kept her voice quiet as she indicated her son. “Him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes drifted towards where Nicky was. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed her eyes. Her muscles tensing as she thought through the rest of her financial obligations. “I have student loans…And my divorce with Tori.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes were taking her in carefully as she nodded, blue eyes eventually finding hers. Rio shrugged. “I can cover all that for now. I have a lawyer on retainer actually. I can see if their firm has someone and can work you in, I spend plenty, it shouldn't be an issue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “I’d want to pay you back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved past her, letting her go. “Fine, once you’ve been paid, we can discuss it. For now. Get me all of your info and I’ll send it to my people.” She turned back around when Agatha didn’t follow. “Was there something else?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head and Rio disappeared without further comment.</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 25</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio had told Agatha they could go for their initial promo shoot together. Rio drove as Agatha’s hands danced nervously in the space before her face, trying and failing to dispel any of the excess energy that was driving her insane. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re going to do fine.” Rio took a moment to divert her gaze from the road to check in on Agatha’s facials – </span>
  <em>
    <span>yep, still panicking</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha slammed her head back into her headrest. “I don’t even know Lilia,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “She’ll do great with Nicky. She is… fun… creative, and very good at maintaining control, especially with children.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed. “At least she’s watching him at your house. I have no idea if hers is even childproof.” Rio’s eye browns raised at that statement. Nicky wasn’t super young and surely knew not to put things in his mouth or forks into sockets, whatever Agatha was anxious about. She watched as Agatha tapped at the car door giving Rio concerning images of the woman flinging herself out on the highway to get back to her child. Rio heard the click as she engaged the child lock. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked at the affronting sound in her door as Rio’s eyes drifted back to the road. “I’m worried you’re going to fall out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tilted her head in question. “I have my seatbelt on?” She pulled on it quickly so that it engaged, accentuating her point that it would keep her in place should the door fly off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “I mean you can disarm it, but I would prefer you didn’t. You’re pretty jittery right now and I don’t need to have to explain to Nicky later what happened to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes before flopping back in her seat. “Fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled as her shoulders relaxed. “Thank you. I know it’s silly, but I promised Nicky I would take care of you today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes slid to her, her voice ticking up a little. “You did?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded as her eyes remained focused on the road. “This stuff can be a lot and I think he understood that. He was worried about how you would do on your first day. Well, it’s just the photo shoot today but it is your first so I want to make sure I’m there to help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sniffed as she crossed her arms. “I’m a big girl, Rio, I can handle it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “I know, Agatha. I know you can. I just remember how overwhelming everything seemed when I first started and I… want things to be easier for you.” Rio looked like she wanted to say more then stopped herself. Agatha tapped her short nails on the doorframe before she finally got herself to ask.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” Her voice sounded softer now, she indicated Rio should share the moment Rio took a moment to glance her way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The dark haired woman took a steading breath. “What wasn’t wrong my first time.” She snorted. “I think the main takeaway was that I was an ugly eighteen year old.” She checked her map app before signaling that she was turning off the highway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes softened. “I’m sure you were never ugly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “Well, I was told I was. My skin was too tan, my hair was too dark, my eyes looked soulless… the woman went on and on, you would have thought she would have known better than to talk to a young girl like that, but she didn’t.” She shifted uncomfortably. “People can be extremely rude. Lilia sorted it a few days later, I wouldn’t let her go with me to the shoot, I didn’t need her to hold my hand, but eventually she got it out of me.” Rio tapped on her phone to check how long it would take, they were almost there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha weighed back in. “Well, the world thinks you’re gorgeous now, so I wouldn’t worry about her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled softly as she tried to reassure Agatha about their shoot. “Anyway, I’m sure everything will be fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed out a laugh. “Ten bucks says they tell me I’m too old for the part.”</span>
</p><p>

  <span>Agatha sat down in a chair, a man she had never met descended on her hair. Her bright eyes watched him with trepidation. She wasn’t used to people getting this close to her, nor knowing what to do with her wavy hair. She was extremely uncomfortable. Her eyes wandered over to Rio, who was… falling asleep. Her hair was finished and a makeup artist tried to do her face while she slept, Rio’s nose twitching occasionally.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes rolled. Well, she was never going to get </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>comfortable with all of this. She closed her eyes as she tried to settle herself. She was just getting her hair done, like she had at the salon a handful of times. Times when Tori had wanted her to look perfect at her side for a photo op, or to impress a major client with her wife in the finest and her hair done just right.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand drifted to her stomach, pressing down as she felt like she might be sick at any moment. Her makeup artist turned around and her eyes widened. Any fears about the shoot instantly poofed into thin air as she came face to face with her past. A tall, attractive, black woman with a shaved head. Her name was blurted out with haste. “Kale?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s brown eyes narrowed, her mouth dropping open. “Oh, fuck no. Harkness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bolted upright at Agatha’s tone, her eyes looking towards the confrontation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was now leaning all the way back in her chair. “Do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> touch me, Jennifer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tall woman with the shaved head tossed her invisible hair. “Please, as if I would ever </span>
  <em>
    <span>want </span>
  </em>
  <span>to.” She coughed out </span>
  <em>
    <span>again </span>
  </em>
  <span>and Agatha’s mouth dropped open in shock at the woman’s nerve.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s head tilted at Agatha in question as blue eyes glanced over to hers, a blush invading her cheeks. Rio cleared her throat looking between the two women. “Is there a problem here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s eyes lifted to Rio and turned about to make sure she was being addressed before responding. “Me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, her concern appeared to be growing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jennifer smiled awkwardly before giving Rio a little wave. “Uh, hey, girl. Big fan.” Her eyes darted to Agatha then back. “I’m supposed to do </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> makeup.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes slid to Agatha, the raven-haired woman standing from her chair now, and moving to place her hand on her lover’s shoulder. “I take it… you two have met?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen looked away angrily. “Oh, we’ve met.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her hand tighten on Agatha in warning to the makeup artist. “Well, whatever she did, I do need my costar to have a face at the end of this.” She walked in front of Agatha and looked Jen up and down. “Can I trust you to take care of her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen laughed awkwardly with Rio so close to her. “Y-yeah. Totally got her. She’ll look ageless when I’m through with her.” Agatha saw Rio’s back twitch at the dig. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned her head to look back at Agatha through the mirror, her voice soft. “She’s already beautiful.” She looked back at Jen and pleaded quietly. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Please</span>
  </em>
  <span>, don’t hurt her.” She was about to say more when her name was called, Rio quietly cursed under her breath. Her hands reaching out and taking both of Jen’s, lifting them to her mouth and kissing lightly. “Thank you, for taking care of her.” She offered Agatha a smile as she wandered off with her own makeup artist, the man trailing after her in case she needed a touch up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched Jen’s hands as if she were about to stab her in the chest or the eye socket with one of her little makeup brushes. The darker woman rolling her eyes. “I don’t know what spell you’ve put over Miss Vidal, but I am not about to get fired over your dusty ass.” She snapped her fingers. “Sit up straight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “I’m dusty? What happened to you? You were going to own your own business,” Her tone grew to mocking. “Weren’t you, Jen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tall woman smacked a hand on Agatha’s chair and the woman flinched. “I can’t do this with you, Agatha. I need this job.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes glared through the mirror. “You never did know what to do with my face.” She smirked until Jen spun her around to face her and her own fell. A sharp eye pencil in the cafe colored hand before her as Jen’s eyes narrowed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How do you know Rio?” Her had moved inward swiftly, Agatha twitching but otherwise not moving. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We crossed paths.” She held her breath and Jen sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look, Agatha, high school was a long time ago…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes narrowed as she scoffed, insulted. Quickly interrupting. “It was middle school, </span>
  <em>
    <span>please</span>
  </em>
  <span>. My brain started to function by high school. Not my fault you were the only decently looking girl around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen rolled her eyes as she continued to work. “Fine, but it wasn’t just </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>ass your mother reamed for catching us in the woods. She told my mother, the school board, the church, my coach... it was a nightmare for me too.” Agatha avoided brown eyes as she crossed her arms, trying to refuse Jen’s attempts to move on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened her eyes as Jen moisturized, then painted on her lips. She couldn’t help herself as she snarked. “It was a waste, you didn’t even know how to kiss.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen scoffed and raised an eyebrow. “Agatha, there’s more to kissing women than shoving your tongue down their throats and your hand down their...” She sat back tapping the back of the brush to her chin as she pondered something, her words trailing off. “Is that what you’ve been doing with Miss Vidal?” Her eyes watched for hints across Agatha’s features as she dug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha just about choked. She cursed the flushing in her face. “What?!” Her voice going up too many octaves. “Oh please. Rio would never…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen pointed towards the way the woman had gone. “You did arrive together… I wonder what that means.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha glared at the floor, her top lip twitching, “Would you just finish my face?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen shrugged. “I’ll get it out of one of you, eventually.” She took some eye shadow and indicated Agatha closed her eyes. It was dark blue. “She not your type? I would have thought she would be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed. “She’s… nice. I guess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen clicked her tongue letting the next phrase drip with innuendo. “I’m sure she </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Kind of surprised you’re her type though, she seems like a super top.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes flashed open. Jen was still musing to herself before she looked back at Agatha. “I mean, if she’s not yours… then you wouldn’t mind if I…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha flicked her hands at Jen. “Don’t care what you do, Jen. Never did. Glad you took Cindy off my hands too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen sprayed Agatha’s face with setting spray, the lack of a heads up leaving Agatha coughing. Jen grabbed a few items for touch ups as she grumbled about how they were already running late.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was effortless at this process. Her face doing everything she wanted it to do, and her body was made for the pieces of fabric that were draped across her. Agatha had to admit it, if only to herself that she was very jealous. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s outfit was a tightly wrapped black dress that was a second skin, with bug wing-like shoulder pads. She felt like she could barely breathe in the thing. Agatha’s hair was down and only slightly wavy now, her eyes a dark blue eyeshadow, dusted with gold flecks. She hated to admit it, but Jen had done a great job on her face, but then again, Jen had always done well with her own makeup.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She smoothed her dress out as she waited to be called forward. Jen sighed at her side, already picking up on her nervous energy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll do fine.” She offered up gently before she smirked. “Wanna go make out in the backroom after this? I’ll let you use all the tongue you want? For old times sake.” She knocked their shoulders together lightly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gagged and Jen laughed. Blue eyes were stuck on Rio, the woman now moving off of the stage and heading straight for her – to where she must have found her lurking off in the shadows with Jen. Rio practically beamed as she skipped over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m feeling witchy.” She wiggled her fingers at Agatha and the other woman smacked her hands away, causing Rio’s laughter to grow. “Your turn,” She turned Agatha toward the stage and smacked her ass as the woman walked forward, stumbling a bit, she turned around to glare back at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen blushed and looked away for a second. “So, you two seem… close?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes didn’t leave Agatha. “We’re friends.” Her voice was low and just for Jen. “You did a good job on her makeup. And look at that, she’s still in one piece.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen beamed at the complement. “So you know Agatha from?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes slid over to Jen’s. “Around.” She tilted her head to the side. “And you know her from?” Her eyes rose in a silent challenge as she wondered if this woman was competition, despite the frosty reunion, because Rio had to admit, Jen looked good. Like good enough to steal her girl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s eyes lifted back to Agatha on the set as the flashes continued. “School. We’re from the same small town.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes followed Jen’s. “Ah, outside of Chicago, right? It’s… quiet there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s mouth lightly dropped open. “So… you’ve been?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “Once, yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen nodded along as if she was trying to figure out why on earth Rio had been to their small town if they weren’t a thing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lifted her hand lamely indicating the woman in question. “Her eyes really pop with the black dress and dark makeup.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen hummed. “Yeah, blue’s a fun color to work with. And Agatha’s eyes are… sharp.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cleared her throat as she crossed her arms. So Jen did remember Agatha’s eyes. “They’re unique.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen rubbed at the back of her neck. “She’s… a lot but, not a terrible person.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned to Jen, assessing her. “Well,” She broke out into a smile. “I don’t mind a lot.” She stuck out her hand. “Sorry, I’m Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen tried to shake herself awake. “Jennifer Kale. Makeup artist.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, trying to relax. “Well I’m glad she has a friend here, besides me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen opened her mouth to say something but a slight commotion on set drew their attention back to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to keep up as the photographer gave her directions, turn this way, tilt your chin. Laugh, smolder. She wasn’t sure what she had done to piss him off when he stopped abruptly and flipped through his photos, leaving her to falter. His voice was indignant when he griped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They didn’t tell me you were pregnant, </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>would have been nice to plan for.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s face dropped. “I’m… not.” Her mouth was left hanging open as her eyes fell to the floor, her hand trying to hide her midsection. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man lifted an eyebrow. “Please. What did you do, eat the whole buffet this morning? It’s amazing you could even fit in that dress.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, she hadn’t even noticed her figure in the mirror before they had moved to set because she had been so nervous. She felt like it was suddenly too hot in the chilled room. She was considering bolting when Rio stepped up into her view, dark eyes wide having noticed the shift in Agatha’s facials, even from across the room. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The cameraman huffed. “I wasn’t ready for both of you yet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio raised a hand and the man cried out frustrated. Her hand reached for Agatha’s face but the woman shifted away. “Don’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice was quiet. “What did he say?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “Just… go. I’m fine.” Her voice, trying to shut Rio out. The embarrassment wafting off of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s body tightened as she whipped around at the man with the camera. “What did you say?” Her voice was dangerous her booted stomps echoing in the empty space as she advanced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He scoffed and tried to hide how unnerved he was by her. Agatha couldn’t blame him, she looked deadly. “She’s sporting a food baby, what am I supposed to do with </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Fix every angle in post?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio growled. “Do your </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking </span>
  </em>
  <span>job.” She pointed at herself. “You think you won’t be touching </span>
  <em>
    <span>me </span>
  </em>
  <span>up in post? It’ll take you two minutes to fix that dark dress, I doubt you’ll barely even see the need to fix much.” She paced back and forth, her eyes not leaving his.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You think we should just not eat? Is that it? Should I starve to make </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>job easier?” She looked his body up and down. “Thank gods </span>
  <em>
    <span>you’re </span>
  </em>
  <span>not the one in front of the camera. No inch of you looks ready to be on a fifty foot billboard!” She clenched her fist to try and get her anger under control. Her voice dipping to a respectable level but lower. “Take a walk before I make you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man threw up his hands and stormed from the stage. Rio was not impressed with his bitch fit, her mood plummeted. She walked back to Agatha, her frustration not quelled in the slightest and though she didn’t mean to take it out on her she did. Her voice came out a bit harsh when she did speak. “Go to the bathroom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widened, opening and closing quickly. So Rio had noticed too. Her mind flooded with images of stick thin women in Hollywood, how she had never thought she would become one of them. She should have thought about the fact that her body wasn’t ready for something like this. Her eyes taking in Rio and her slightly smaller frame. Her voice was hesitant as she tried to confirm what her lover wanted her to do. Though she figured she already had a pretty good idea. “You want me to… throw up?” Her voice trailed off at the end. She never had before… but she guessed there was a first time for everything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s jaw ticked, annoyed and a bit hurt, if Agatha was reading her correctly. “No. Just, sometimes it helps, a little, if you… pee.” Agatha’s arms crossed over her chest as her eyes looked up to the ceiling fighting back the tears. Rio tried to soften the blow from her words. “You’re just bloated,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took off from the stage, not wanting to hear another word about what Rio thought of her appearance, her hands quickly coming to cover her mouth when Jen caught up with her. Agatha whipped around unsettled by hearing someone breathing beside her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Agatha, woah, there. Don’t… mess up more of your makeup.” Jen’s hands fluttered over her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Slim fingers blotted under her eyes. “Where… where’s the bathroom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen placed her hand on the small of her back and led her down the hall, moving to go in with her. Agatha’s gaze turned on her when the room was a single bathroom. “I’m not in the mood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen rolled her eyes. “I don’t need to worry about what you might do in here. Just… go pee, and we’ll head back out and I’ll touch you up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha slapped at her thighs as she angrily stomped to the toilet, realizing a moment later that she couldn’t figure out how to get her dress off, her eyes stinging in frustration. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen approached to help, shushing her as she assured her she had this covered. Agatha’s breasts came free as her dress was folded down, Jen squatting to hold the bottom of the gown off the ground. “Just hurry up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat down and they both listened as she used the restroom. The pads of her fingers occasionally wiping at her face, though Jen didn’t chastise her again. When she was finished, Jen helped her back into her dress and started to clean up her makeup. Grabbing her shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s a little bitch. He doesn't know you, Aggie. As much as I hate to admit it, ya look good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried not to smile. “Be careful you don’t say something nice to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen licked her finger and brushed at dark eyebrows. “Oh, I would </span>
  <em>
    <span>never</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha groaned. “Ew.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen smirked. “Get used to it, they booked me for your show. We’re going to be spending a lot of time together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her shoulders. “The bad news just keeps coming.” Jen smacked her on the arm, getting a small smile out of the other woman.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Jen opened the door, Rio stood before them, her hand lifted in the air about to knock. “Hey.” Her eyes slipped between the two women. Her dark eyes landed on Agatha, pleading for the woman to speak to her. “You alright?” Clearly feeling guilty. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded and tried to lighten the mood. “Yeah, I guess. I’ll just have to stop eating is all.” She smiled at her joke, but Rio sighed, staring her down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t do that.” She handed over a bottle of water.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s brows furrowed but she moved her hair over her shoulder, taking the water. Rio stepped up to move the rest of it over her other shoulder. Imparting her wisdom up close as her hands trailed over Agatha’s arms. “You don’t stop eating. You eat smarter. Liquids before events, solid food after. I… wasn’t thinking this morning, I should have told you. I’m sorry that’s my fault. Water will help remove the bloating if you sip at it slowly.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pressed at her own forehead to try and control her emotions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen tilted her head as Agatha caught her eyes over Rio’s shoulder as the black woman mouthed, “This morning?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, Rio was going to blow this all on her own.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked back towards the stage. “I don’t know if he’s coming back. We’ll give it a few minutes, then we can go.” She looked Agatha up and down with a private smile. “I like this dress on you.” She ran her hands over the fabric, unintentionally lighting Agatha’s body on fire.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cleared her throat and wiped at her nose as she sniffed. “It’s… fine.” She tried to smile but it fell flat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tilted her head. “Fuck it. Let’s get out of here.” She took Agatha’s hand and her eyes lifted to Jen. “Can you cover for us? I… got sick.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen jumped a bit at being addressed again by the A-list actor. “Yep. Of course. You… all over the toilet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved forward and hugged Jen, the darker woman’s cheeks going pink. “Thank you.” Rio whispered. She leaned back and laid her hand on Agatha and led her back to the prep room to get their things. And after a quick stop to get burgers, they headed home.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER 26 </h1><p>Agatha had another photoshoot and Rio had offered to watch Nicky. She had felt confident about the decision until the moment her lover had left and she was left with brown eyes staring up at her. She noticed for the first time how much the boy looked like he was hers. Brown eyes, darker hair, his complexion more easily matched hers than his mother’s. She tried to ignore the special brand of anxiety that raced through her veins when she thought of Nicky being hers. She watched as he shifted from foot to foot smiling up at her. </p><p> </p><p>“Can we have snacks?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded when she heard her dog ringing his bells to come in, Nicky took off towards the back door before she could say anything. “I’ll get him!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed. She could do this. Kids were just smaller people. She liked Nicky, they always had an easy time together, she could totally do this. She moved to her fridge and opened it, staring off into the potential options inside. She assumed Agatha would probably prefer something healthy for her child. She contemplated if Nicky was old enough to think vegetables were a snack or a punishment.</p><p> </p><p>She heard a ball bouncing and she saw Nicky with the soccer ball she had gotten for him and Ruffland to play with, the boy dribbling it with his feet. Rio glanced at the glass cabinet behind the boy. “Hey, Nicky, let’s not play with that in the house.” She tried to keep her voice soft, she didn’t need him thinking she was yelling at him. </p><p> </p><p>The boy nodded as he turned to pop the ball up into his hands, misjudging the distance, he accidentally sent the ball flying into the crystal cabinet. The bottom layer of glass windows blowing out in a fraction of an instant. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky froze, Rio moved quickly around her kitchen counter, seeing her dog come running from the other room she raised a hand, “Sit!” Her dog dropped into a down stay instead at her tone. She placed a hand on Nicky’s shoulder. Her heart racing, her voice quiet, her heart pounding.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky?”</p><p> </p><p>The boy shrieked. She quickly lifted her hand off of him in alarm. “What?” She moved to look him over, kneeling. “Where does it hurt, baby?” She started to tremble. Of course she would be left alone with Agatha’s son for all of five minutes and he would get injured in her care. She felt like she was getting light headed, she couldn’t faint, not right now, not when she was watching Nicky! When Nicky collapsed down on the floor, sobbing, she found that she was able to push through her panic. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, Mommy!” His eyes were distant, no longer focused on the cabinet.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes grew large in horror. <em> Mommy? </em> Not <em> Momma </em>. He was referring to Tori. Rio used her hand to brush fallen glass away from his feet, though they looked unharmed. Rio tried to keep her voice even as she spoke trying to avoid things escalating, especially with glass all over the floor. </p><p> </p><p>“Buddy, you’re okay. It’s not a big deal…”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky whimpered, shaking his head. “Don’t yell at Momma! It's not her fault. I-I did it!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio cupped Nicky’s face, trying to get him to look at her. “Hey… I’m not going to yell at Agatha. It’s alright. She didn’t do anything wrong.” She ran her thumbs under his eyes, trying to wipe away his tears. “You had an accident. It happens to all of us sometimes. I’m not mad, Nicky.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky attempted to wipe at his nose and Rio lifted the sleeve of her black sweater to help. “Does anything hurt?”</p><p> </p><p>The boy shook his head. His voice now disappeared completely. Rio wasn’t sure yet if that was a good or a bad thing. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at the glass. “Good. Here’s what I need. I need you to go take a shower, very carefully. I need you to make sure that if there is any glass, that it’s washed off of you. Get into your comfy clothes, and then come let me know when you’re done and if you need help with anything.”</p><p> </p><p>The boy nodded his understanding and Rio rubbed at his back. “I’ll get this cleaned up. Go get your shower, buddy. I’ll see you soon.” He thundered down the hall the moment she removed her hand. She sat there for a long moment after he had gone, sighing. She took Ruffland to her room and settled him in bed for a nap before she returned to the kitchen. She retrieved a broom and tray and began to sweep up the glass.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky’s quiet crying was heard from the doorway when she was about halfway through her task, the child now dressed in his pajamas and his hair wet. Her heart sank at the sound. “R-rio?”</p><p> </p><p>She turned, he had moved to bite at his nails. Rio not loving how they started to grow red. “I’m… really sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio indicated the mess. “It’s not a big deal. See? I’m almost done.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky moved forward and Rio yelled. “No!” She closed her eyes for a moment. “No… I don’t want you to get hurt.” She indicated the floor. “I’m not sure I got it all yet.”</p><p> </p><p>The boy stood still, his eyes taking in the mess as Rio finished collecting the glass. His little eyes looked up at her. “Could we tape up the cabinet with paper for now? I could go grab some paper from your desk?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned against the counter. “That’s a great idea, let’s try that.” Nicky walked carefully down the hall before returning a moment later with paper and tape. He walked gingerly to the cabinet and started taping up the sides. Rio got a hand vacuum to get the pieces that had shattered into the case.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky’s little fingers picked up a crystal that had broken into two, his eyes ready to start crying again. “I messed it up.” His voice was quiet but his eyes held so much anger Rio wondered where it had all come from at such a young age. He looked so much like his mother in that moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky, it’s fine. Sometimes we have to… divine meaning from things that have happened.”</p><p> </p><p>His sharp glare held her in place. “What meaning could a broken crystal even have?” He huffed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kneeled next to him and took the crystal from his hands, both pieces. She looked at them for a moment, then took the smaller piece and placed it gently back in Nicky’s palm. “I think, this all happened because that piece wanted to be yours.” She closed his fingers lightly around the rock. “Maybe this happened so we can remember our time together. You are the little piece and I am the bigger piece.” The green stone sparkled in the light as Nicky turned it, taking it in. “We’re part of the same stone?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, “We share the same space and time so, maybe, in a way.” </p><p> </p><p>Nicky looked up at Rio, settling further. He bit his lip contemplating something before voicing it. “You would be a good mom.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt the air leave her lungs, she let her eyes linger on the ground. How did she explain things to a child? She tried to be careful with her words. “Not everyone… wants to be a mom.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky took this in and tried to place his hair behind his ear but it was too short still. He shrugged looking down at the rock. “I think I want to be a mom.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled, her hand going to his head to hold his hair back from his eyes for him. “I think you mean <em> dad </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>He shook his head, his eyes narrowing. “No… I mean a <em> mom </em>.” He sighed, his whole little body heaving with emotion. “Rio… can I tell you something?”</p><p> </p><p>She sat all the way down and crossed her legs, her hands gripping at her knees, sensing the gravity of the moment in the air. “Sure.” Her eyes opened and her body language was as relaxed as she could force it to be. It was moments like these that she was glad she was an actor. On the outside she seemed calm, but on the inside? She wasn’t fine at all. She tried to trick herself into believing everything was fine. What could Nicky even possibly have to tell her...</p><p> </p><p>Nicky looked her in the eyes, looked to the floor, then locked on her gaze. “I’m… a girl.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio schooled her features. She was floored, but didn’t need the kid knowing that and having residual trauma from this conversation. As her mind scrambled to understand she stalled. “What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky sat down mimicking her posture, small hands playing with the little green stone. “I like my hair long. It’s pretty, like Momma’s.” Nicky shrugged. “I don’t wanna look like a boy. Grown men look gross.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio picked up her crystal for something to fiddle with. “How… long have you… felt this way?” She offered up a hesitant smile. Was this something she should be discussing with Nicky? She really didn’t understand the rules around children. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky took their crystal and placed it on top of hers. “Always.” The child exchanged the rocks. “I-I started crying when Mommy would get my haircut pretty young, she started leaving it long.” Nicky reached out and twisted their fingers in a strand of Rio’s hair that had fallen from her ponytail. “I like your hair, it’s pretty too.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. “Thanks.” She rolled Nicky's stone between her fingers. “Have you told your Momma that you feel like you’re a girl?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky rubbed at their little face. “No… she has a lot going on.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tapped at Nicky’s knee, a genuine smile finding her face this time. “That doesn’t mean that you’re not important.” </p><p> </p><p>Nicky nodded. </p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, “So… are we talking like new names? New pronouns?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky’s brows furrowed. “What’s a pronoun?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth fell open as she floundered, trying to think of how to properly explain it. “It’s… like, how we talk about if someone is a girl, a boy… an other…”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky’s brows lifted. “What’s an other?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio cringed. “Nonbinary, like not a girl or boy.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky’s face nodded in determination. “Okay… Well, I don’t care about that. I just want to look like a girl, forever.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorted. “Dude, me too.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky handed her the bigger rock. “I put good feelings into this for you.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heart cracked. She took her stone and placed it on her leg, her hands holding Nicky’s piece between them as she closed her eyes a moment then opened them and placed the smaller piece into the little child’s hands. “I put some good vibes in there for you, too.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky smiled. “You asked about my name. I like my name actually, but maybe… my longer name can change?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “You just let me know what you want me to call you when you decide.” She let her mind drift to Agatha. “Maybe we wait until your mom starts her new job to tell her?”</p><p> </p><p>The little kid sighed. “Yeah, we can do that.” Little brown eyes connected with Rio’s. “Can you be there when I tell her?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached out and held the small hand before hers. “I would love to.” She cleared her throat. “Now, how about we go get some ice cream? I think we need to celebrate our great job cleaning up.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky stood and pocketed their rock, reaching out their little hands for Rio and trying with all their might to help her up, which they did to Rio’s surprise.</p><p> </p>

  <span>CHAPTER 27</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha returned home sipping on an extra large smoothie Rio had prepared for her that morning and it was a good thing too, because it had gotten her through her shoot. Rio had pulled some strings and her friend Alice, who owned the little coffee shop in Chicago and was an accomplished photographer, had flown out to finish the photos. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alice was creative and had a firm vision, one which Agatha appreciated. She never once made Agatha feel less than and on the contrary, actually made her feel more powerful, giving her prompts for each set of photos and being patient as she brought up the feelings required. Alice seemed to know how to call forth the divine feminine energy that was needed for this particular shoot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha set her bag on the counter in the kitchen as she went to ponder lunch, noticing the cabinet was taped up. Her eyes surveyed the bottom layer of the cabinet and clocked that it was missing its glass panel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her mind didn’t form conscious thoughts after that, her heart threatening to either beat out of her chest or stop beating all together. She quickly went in search of her son and Rio, as if she might lose them if she didn’t find them at that moment. She almost missed them as she passed the family room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio yelled playfully. “Ah, cold!” Agatha saw a smudge of brown ice cream on her nose and saw her son with his outstretched finger. Her mind flashing to the cabinet, Nicky had to have broken it, she knew he had. She felt like someone had poured something that burned into her veins, she couldn't breathe. They were going to lose everything. She had gotten too comfortable and now everything was going to fall apart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nicolas!” her voice boomed and Rio and Nicky both turned abruptly, their smiles falling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The little boy shrinking under her tone, she never yelled at him. “Hi.. Momma.” His voice was quiet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's face hardened, her hand sweeping to the hall. “Go to your room!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s eyes were wide. “But we were watching a movie and picking out a new cabinet for Rio’s rocks…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stormed around the couch to grab him when Rio’s arm caught hers. “Agatha. Stop.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Icy blue eyes turned on her. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>You </span>
  </em>
  <span>don’t tell me how to handle </span>
  <em>
    <span>my son.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes flashed with hurt, but her hand remained gripping Agatha’s wrist. “He’s fine. It was an accident. Everythings okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha growled. “Get, Your Hands. Off. Of. Me!” As the last punch in her words was delivered, Ruffland appeared growling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stumbled back a few steps, terrified, her hands outstretched and shaking. Rio dropped her hand, pointer finger down in a firm motion and Ruffland hit the floor. The dog laid his head between his front feet, no longer in protection mode. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook as she tried to contain her anger, attempting to keep her voice from rising. “Do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> scare my dog.” Her eyes indicated the hall. “Go cool off, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed. “Or what?” She knew she was pushing Rio, that’s what she was good at. pushing people over the edge, pushing people away. There was a reason she was alone. She tried to ignore how her son’s face was crushing with every moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved slowly, her body going to stand before Agatha, her arms crossed. “I don’t want to fight with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sneered, inching closer to Rio until she was in her face. “You. Don’t. Control. Me.” She hissed the last part into Rio’s ear like a threat. She leaned back slowly, her eyes locked onto Rio’s. “Nicky. Get your things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy didn’t move. “No.” His face was defiant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cringed. Nicky </span>
  <em>
    <span>always </span>
  </em>
  <span>chose her. He always listened when it was important. She turned to him, her eyes wide. “Nicolas…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He shook his head. “No, Momma. I’m not leaving. I like it here. Rio is </span>
  <em>
    <span>nice </span>
  </em>
  <span>to us. I promised her I would help pick out a safer cabinet, since I messed up the other one. I want to help fix what I broke.” He continued to ramble. “Plus, we got ice cream and we got your favorite for you. It's in the fridge…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a step back from Rio, her body going numb. It had happened, Nicky had turned on her. She didn’t even have him anymore. Rio had done this. Agatha wanted to grab Nicky and drag him from this house, even if she had to do so kicking and screaming. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lifted her hands up in surrender. “Agatha, let’s all take a breath. We can talk about this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman shook her head, eyes darting quickly to make sure the dog wouldn’t get to her, then she ran. </span>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha disappeared down the hall and Rio heard her opening and closing drawers in quick succession. Her eyes fluttered closed as she felt the situation slipping out of her control. She didn’t want Agatha and Nicky to leave, it was just a stupid cabinet and some rocks. It wasn’t the end of the world. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky flopped onto the couch with a huff, Ruffland jumping up and placing himself across the child’s lap. Nicky’s little fingers quickly found the dog's soft fur and laid it down with each stroke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio wanted to ask what was going on, but felt like her tongue had been cut from her mouth and she couldn’t find the ability to speak. After some time, Nicky offered up information and Agatha’s door didn’t reopen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mommy always yelled at her. Sometimes she would throw things.” Nicky wiped firmly at their face. “One day she screamed at Momma to get out. That… that she didn’t love her anymore and that… I wasn’t even hers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand landed on her stomach. “Nicky…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The kid leaned back against the couch. “She wasn’t a very good Mommy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved slowly to squat in front of the child. “Is that why you panicked about the cabinet?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A little face nodded in the affirmative. “Yeah… I didn’t want someone to hurt Momma again because of something I did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio ran her hand through Nicky’s brunette hair. “I’m not going to hurt her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky smiled. “I know. You have a good heart. You love her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand faltered. “I…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky smirked. “I know you love her, I can tell.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her hand fall back to Ruffland. “It’s a bit early for love, Nicks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The kid shrugged. “You two stare at each other like you’re in a movie.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky rubbed at their nose. “Momma is scared of dogs cause a dog ate her rabbit when she was little and she got bit trying to save it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio frowned. “That’s awful.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky agreed. “Yeah, I wouldn’t want my bunny eated either. But Ruffland is nice, I hope he wouldn’t eat a bunny.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted trying to stop the snot that threatened to run down her face. “Some dogs don’t mean to hurt other animals but they do. He wouldn’t do it on purpose, but it’s important to watch him when we are outside. He listens well if you tell him to leave it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky inclined their head. “I’ll help him make good decisions.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. “I appreciate that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky sighed, and Rio tried to reach out with her words. “Your mom was pretty scared I would kick you guys out, huh?” Wondering if she had landed on the reason Agatha had panicked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her suspicions were confirmed when Nicky nodded, yawning now. “Yeah… she probably needs a hug. I should get up soon.” The kid laid down on the couch, cuddling into the dog. “Maybe five more minutes.” Rio pulled a blanket over them. “I think you deserve a rest. I’ll put the ice cream away then go check on her.” Little eyes were already fluttering closed as she moved to exit the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved the ice cream to the fridge then started off towards Agatha’s room. She lifted her hand to knock when she thought better of it and opened the door quietly. Agatha sat on the floor with her back to her, head buried in her knees. Her open suitcase filled with random things of Rio’s that she had been wearing for comfort. Her shoulders shook as she continued to cry. Rio’s stomach twisted. The fact that Agatha could still be crying after the time it took her to come looking for her, was a knife to her heart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a step into the room and the floor creaked, she cursed under her breath, she had forgotten about that. She watched as Agatha gripped her knees tighter, attempting to make herself smaller. Rio closed the door most of the way as she moved to sit behind her on the floor. She reached out a hand and ran it down her back, Agatha whimpered but didn’t shift away from the touch. Rio moved a little closer and started to play with dark locks of hair. After a few minutes, Agatha had gone quiet, her head starting to tilt back at the feeling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio finger combed her hair for a while then braided it for her. When she was done, Agatha had let her legs fall crossed, her hands in her lap. Rio wrapped her arms around her waist and pressed her cheek into her back, listening to the broken sounds of Agatha’s breathing unevenly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry.” Rio held her tight. “I should have called you about what happened with Nicky, but I promise, Agatha, he’s not hurt.” Her mind flashed with memories of her talk with Nicky, but they weren’t telling Agatha yet, and she needed to fight to keep that straight in her mind, even if the child wasn’t. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head turned, Rio shifting to look at a face that had been rubbed raw. “I’m the one who hurt him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shushed her, wiping tears away from crystal blue eyes. “You panicked,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha coughed out a sob. “I’m sorry, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cupped her cheek. “It’s alright,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s broken voice cut her off. “It’s not.” Her eyes drifted away. “Even I know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned forward and kissed her softly. Agatha chasing the affection and attempting to steal her air, escalating things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s shaky hands tried to reach for Rio’s clothing but the girl stood swiftly, Agatha looking up at her confused, contemplating if Rio was going to reject her. A hand was offered to her, Agatha clearly didn’t feel like she deserved it if the look in her eyes was any indication, but placed her palm in Rio’s anyway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was lifted up and moved to sit back on the bed, while Rio moved to lock the door. When she returned she leaned forward and started to leave open mouthed kisses on her lover’s neck, the quiet mewling sounds catching her off guard momentarily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha dug her nails into Rio’s back, anchoring her in place, with her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned forward and whispered in her ear. “Lay back, I’ve got you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha complied instantly, not her usual style. Rio moved to lay her body on top of Agatha’s, to ground her, her lips seaking out Agatha’s and kissing her lazily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha groaned as she tried to roll her hips into Rio's, frustrated by the lack of movement options. Rio helped her to sit so she could take off her shirt, Agatha hesitated. But before Rio could ask, Agatha took a breath and took it off anyway, her eyes searching Rio’s face for something. The woman prompted her with a single question. “Do you want to be in control?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “Not today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded as she leaned back in, her mouth claiming every inch of Agatha‘s chest, before she dipped down to kiss her stomach. A tear rolling off of Agatha’s face. Rio removed her own clothes before tugging off Agatha's pants and underwear, noticing that Agatha watched her, the woman making no move to protest their positions. Rio moved back in and started to kiss Agatha again, her tongue running over Agatha’s bottom lip before sucking on it lightly, the older woman’s mouth parting as soft panting sounds started to come from somewhere deep within her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was spurred on by the way the sounds hit her deep in her core. She was gentle with Agatha, something they hadn’t done to this degree before. As the woman held on to her, Rio’s fingers played with Agatha to make sure she was wet enough before she slid inside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked at some joke playing in her mind as Rio couldn’t help but smile back. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed. “Don’t get me pregnant, it’ll ruin filming.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes. “I’ll try, baby, but you know that I can’t make any promises.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed. “Well, that’s on you to explain to production… and Lilia.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “You would tell my stage mom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pressed Rio’s hand deeper into her. “You bet I would.” She gasped. “Her little girl’s not so innocent anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rocked her body forward and started to suck at Agatha’s pulse point, the woman going feral with her sounds. “I wasn’t ever innocent, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt as Agatha’s body started to convulse, she kept up her slow pace until she felt Agatha hump into her a few times before her body gave up, going still. Rio leaned forward and kissed her forehead before she crawled off of her. Agatha’s lidded eyes followed her as she moved to grab a long concert tee from the drawer, bringing one over for Agatha later. She crawled in beside the brunette and pulled both ends of the sheets over them, to tuck them in as they fell into a restful sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio woke up to a dark room with a single light on at the desk, Agatha was drawing again. She didn’t turn around as she heard Rio stir. Her voice was quiet as she breathed her tale into existence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tori didn’t always find me beautiful. I was more of a… convenient body.” The tiny scratches on the paper were all that was heard in the silence. “She liked my body, but I don’t know that she liked anything else about me.” Her hand came up to scratch rhythmically at her head, Rio shifted to take over that job. Agatha leaned into the touch as she kept drawing, a new image. This one was dark, a female figure broken into pieces.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She hated my smile. She was worried Nicky would have it. Though she loved to remind me that he would have come out better if he was formed from her DNA.” She sighed. “She couldn’t carry him because her job was too important. She couldn’t risk slowing down, that’s what I was for… there were so many things I was for.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sucked in air. “I was a punching bag when she had a bad day. I was her body when she wanted to create a life or wanted to get off. I wasn’t allowed to create or be playful… She was so </span>
  <em>
    <span>angry </span>
  </em>
  <span>we had to use my eggs when hers ran out. She was so mad I wasted all of hers. Mine didn’t fare much better.” Tears started to splash down onto the page. “I thought if I could give her a child, that she would finally love me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s gentle fingers lowered and started to massage Agatha's neck. The woman whimpered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She made me do the appointments alone after a while. She made me do the shots myself as if it were my punishment for not having any of </span>
  <em>

  <span>biological children.” She shuddered. “She was almost happy with Nicky…when he was a baby, then he was too much like me.” She sniffed to try and stop her nose from running onto the page, Rio taking a blanket and wiping the residue away. Which only made the tears come harder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what made her </span>
  <em>
    <span>hate </span>
  </em>
  <span>me, I don’t know what made my own mother hate me, but they both seemed to be on to something. But… how could Nicky have come out so caring and </span>
  <em>
    <span>good</span>
  </em>
  <span> if I was only bad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned forward and kissed Agatha’s head. Agatha closed her eyes, her body laying down across her drawing. Her head turned, her tears a river onto the page. Rio’s hand rubbing between her shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek before she stood to leave the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled on the concert tee that Rio had left for her and let the feeling of being in Rio’s clothing keep her warm. Though, when she thought about it longer, her mind was providing unhelpful thoughts about how she had shared things with Rio only for the woman to leave her alone. She had probably shared too much. She wiped at her eyes angrily. She was always too much. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she returned to bed and moved to turn that light off, she heard a light knock at the door. When she turned, Nicky stood there rubbing at his eyes, not fully awake. Agatha’s throat tightened as she looked at him. She opened her arms slowly, not sure that she deserved his cuddles. The boy quickly moved into her arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, Nicky.” She kissed the top of his head and he cuddled closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I forgive you, Momma. I know why you yelled. It’s okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned back with Nicky in her arms, pulling the covers over them. “Did you have a bad dream sweetheart?” Her hands ran through his hair, attempting to soothe them both.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He shook his head. “No… Rio said you needed me, so I came in here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s chest felt like it might burst. She wasn’t sure when everything inside of her finally settled, but with the action of unburdening some of her story onto Rio earlier, and with her son safe in her arms. She finally fell asleep.</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 28 scene one</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha had been on the set for less than a day when the first note appeared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rail me like one of your French girls.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes bugged out as she ripped the note off her chair. Her eyes glaring at Jen as she wandered in with two cups of coffee, one presumably Agatha’s order. Dark eyes rolled and she walked past the actress – deciding that whatever Agatha was doing with her face was so above her pay grade this morning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached a hand out and Jen placed a coffee cup in it. They drank in silence for a few minutes before Jen started in on Agatha’s hair. It would be styled lightly wavy for the episode and would be shifted up and down for different sequence progressions today. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt the edges of the note that were crumbled into her hand. If it wasn’t Jen, who the hell had left the note? She chewed at her lips before twitching as Jen flicked her in the face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey!” Agatha’s hand quickly covered where Jen had touched. The woman before her sighing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then don’t fuck with your lips. I need to fix those too, don’t make my job harder.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha grumbled. “I can’t believe they have you doing my hair now too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen faked a smile. “Well, I </span>
  <em>
    <span>am </span>
  </em>
  <span>qualified to do curly hair. Even your lame ass one C hair pattern.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, knowing that not everyone actually knew </span>
  <em>
    <span>how</span>
  </em>
  <span> to work with curly hair. And though she knew Jen most likely did, it still made for an easy argument. “It’s easily a 2a hair pattern. I rest my case.” She threw her hands in the air, frustrated. “You don’t know what you’re doing!” She tried to stand when Jen’s hand pushed her easily back into the chair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen placed a single finger to her own forehead. “The mother give me strength. Look, Agatha, I know you and your woman must have gotten into a tiff or what have you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes looked about the room frantically, as if trying to find a place to stash her secrets. Why could Jen always read her so well? It wasn’t fair, it was like the woman could read her mind. They hadn’t even been that close growing up. She had been the angry loner kid and Jen had plenty of friends to choose from to keep her time occupied. She never understood why the girl had tried to befriend </span>
  <em>
    <span>her </span>
  </em>
  <span>of all people.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s voice trailed off as she noticed Agatha’s nerves. Starting over. “Your hair will look good. I got you. It </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>my work that’s on the line.” She squeezed some lotion into her hands. “Let’s see if we can bump up those waves a bit.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifted uncomfortably as Jen worked with her hair. Avoiding Jen’s attempt to make eye contact. If there was no window into her soul maybe Jen could keep out of her thoughts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen tried to ease the tension by trying to reach out. “You know, I signed a non-disclosure too, to work on this set. I can’t talk about anything I see or hear. So, you might as well tell me the tea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha jerked her head to the side a bit as if Jen was trying to pull information out of her. Her jaw, ticking. No, Jen would get nothing from her. She didn’t need friends, and she especially didn’t need Jen in that capacity.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen twisted some hair around her finger, a satisfied smile appearing on her face when it bounced back into its correct shape. “I think you guys are cute together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, grumbling and taking the bait. “It’s not like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The darker woman raised her eyebrows, looking for Agatha’s eyes in the mirror. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>She</span>
  </em>
  <span> wants it to be.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes looked up at Jen, unsure. Why was Jen being so </span>
  <em>
    <span>nice?</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Is this to get back at me for letting you take Cindy? Everyone knew that girl was full of diseases…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen rolled her eyes. “No, Agatha, and we didn’t even get that far,” Her eyes flashed. “Luckily.” She grabbed Agatha’s head and encouraged her to face forward as her head had drifted to the side to look at her directly. Jen moved to change the subject. “I heard you had a kid, Harkness. How old is he?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged, her mind trying to stay on guard, but her tone warming as she loved talking about Nicky. He seemed to be the only thing she had ever done right. “He’s six, about to be seven.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen nodded, her shoulders relaxing. “Ah, I have a niece that age. Good for you dropping a baby and all, I guess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman in the chair let her body dramatically drop back into her seat, giving up on trying to freeze Jen out. “It was a thing to do.” Jen was annoyingly persistent. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen shifted brunette hair with her hands as she checked the curl patterns, picking up pieces and pinning them in different styles, per the script instructions for today. Her voice softened. “I heard you went through a divorce, too?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged, not offering up more as the subject hit a sore spot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen continued, sensing her energy. “I heard she’s a real witch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked, feeling her mind release some of her walls. “She is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen squeezed her shoulder as she moved to grab her brushes. “So… Rio. Should I slip her my number?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled wider, snorting. “I would love to see you try.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen smirked. “So, how long have you two been together?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha fingers in one hand tapped in succession against the thumb. “You would need to ask her what the story is there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen tilted her chin upward in thought. “She’s… attentive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed her eyes as Jen brought the brush to her eyelids. “She’s just a nice person.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does your kid like her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head nodded once and Jen hummed. “That’s good. Sort of assume you two are a packaged deal. I heard it’s hard dating with a kid.” She dusted a brush over Agatha’s face. “Spray, hold your breath.” A fine mist coated Agatha’s pale skin before Jen continued to apply other things to her face. Agatha nearly nodding off with her eyes closed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Jen finished up, she cleared her throat. “Better get to set, don’t wanna waste that masterpiece on you, you might start crying again.” She turned and Agatha opened her eyes taking in how she looked in the mirror. Her face looked striking, she couldn’t help but be impressed with Jen’s art. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen turned to her bag. “A bit of advice? Don’t starve yourself on set. I heard it makes you actor types a nightmare to work with. Just small meals, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood and nodded, she was about to leave when Jen slipped a bag of trail mix into her hand. Blue eyes staring at it in confusion. She looked up into dark eyes and Jen shook her head and pointed. “Get going.” Agatha turned and walked out of the trailer with a bit more confidence in her step, her hands opening the bag and placing a raisin in her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was ushered into wardrobe and found herself confused when they only handed her a robe. The coordinator indicated her underwear. “That all comes off. We'll apply tape and paper on set.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shivered. She crossed her arms, not ready to just get naked at this person’s word. “I thought we were shooting the scene in the cabin today?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman looked down at her clipboard. Then checked her phone for clarification. “Nope, a flashback sex scene first.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stiffened, her skin prickling. “I wasn’t aware… I didn’t prepare anything for that…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman shrugged. “Not really any speaking parts, the intimacy coordinator will have a better explanation for you when we get to set.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed hard. “Who… who is the scene with?” Her eyes tried to look over the woman’s shoulder at her clipboard. The girl flipping through her papers, “Vidal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s face fell. Rio was at home asleep, wasn’t she? She had left her phone in her bag with Jen, the moment she sat down this morning. She wished she had it now. The girl turned around and she changed quickly. Placing her clothes on the chair as she put the robe on and double knotted it. She didn’t feel good about this. She felt exposed even with the robe on. The girl placed her hand on her back and ushered her to the stage they were filming on. When they arrived, it was a small intimate setting. Leaves covered the ground and Agatha’s eyes tried to adjust to the dim lighting, assuming they would probably turn it up when they started to film. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She hadn’t felt the need to go over the contract with Lilia or ask for more details, figuring that the woman knew what she was doing, but now Agatha wished she had a bit of a heads up. It would have been nice to know that there was nudity. She crossed her arms and walked about the space as everyone seemed too preoccupied to speak with her yet. Her hands came up to rub at her temples. If Rio had come in to work, then where was Nicky?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Someone walked up behind her and she had assumed it was the girl who had brought her in, hoping there had been a mistake. She turned around, coming face to face with Rio. Her eyes wide, taking in Rio’s matching robe. The girl smiled brightly at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey gorgeous.” She walked up and placed her hands on Agatha’s hips bringing her slightly closer. “You look great. I love what Jen did with your eyes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha twitched, her body aware of the other people in the room, and their proximity. She cleared her throat, and licked her lips. “Where… where’s Nicky?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes held Agatha in place attempting to reassure her. “He’s hanging out with Jen for a bit, just dropped him off. I’m sorry, I didn’t have time to find a more appropriate sitter. I didn’t have time to ask Lilia before I had to be on set. You know Jen though, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed. Her mind easing a little. “She’s my middle school hookup. I don’t know how well I know her…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio dropped her hands as she looked uncertain. “I-I can go grab Nicky… I know he shouldn’t be here for this scene, but I’ll see if he can stay in one of our trailers and lock himself in. I’m so sorry…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha uncrossed her arms, putting her hands in her robe pockets. “Rio.” She waited for dark eyes to meet hers before she continued speaking. “Jen is fine. I’m just… getting used to her again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio paused, her eyes unsure. Her voice lowered. “I messed up.” She bit her lower lip. “They asked if we could go on and shoot this scene first and I wasn’t thinking…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s shoulders drew in, “I could have used a heads up. It’s… my first time being naked in front of a room full of people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, her body tense. “Sorry.” She wrapped her arms around herself. “It won’t happen again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes looked about the room. “How… does this work, exactly?” her voice wavered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tilted her head, a small smile coming back to her face. “Don’t tell me they didn’t prep you for this in college? What, no nude modeling class?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha grunted, annoyed. They both knew there was no way any school had prepared her for this. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lifted her hand and placed soft fingers on Agatha’s wrist, feeling for her pulse point, attempting to not make any more assumptions. She tried to not show her concern at Agatha’s racing heart. “It’s really simple.” She started to rub her thumb across Agatha’s wrist. “It’s choreographed. They’ll tell us where our hands go, and we generally try not to deviate from the path, though… because it’s you, I don’t mind if you get a little creative if you are feeling it.” She winked. She lowered her voice to a whisper. “Just don’t actually fuck me while the cameras are rolling.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s cheeks heated up. “Are we… just… naked?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes widened. “Well, no, not fully.” She looked around for something, but when she didn’t find it, she shook her head. “We’ll put these pasties on our nipples, which like, if you don’t want to with me, totally cool I don’t mind. And there will be a paper between our,” She circled her own crotch region.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bounced a bit on her toes as she must have started to grow a little cold. “It’s not a long scene, they just need some footage for flashbacks of our relationship.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved to rub at her arms. “Okay… I think I can do that.” Her eyes looked Rio’s body up and down, hyper aware of what the woman looked like without clothing on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “You’re really getting ready for the scene…” When Agatha looked at her with vacant eyes, Rio cleared her throat. “You’re kind of…” She mimicked Agatha by looking intensely at the other woman’s robe, Agatha feeling the need to cover herself with her hands despite her body already being hidden away from prying eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio gave a small smirk. “Yeah, that’s how you were looking at me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked away. “Not my fault you keep harassing me with your naked body at home.” She huffed and Rio invaded her space, her arms still crossed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that what I keep doing? Cause I could have sworn it was you that keeps insisting </span>
  <em>
    <span>I </span>
  </em>
  <span>get naked.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You’re so annoying.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile grew wider, “Only for you, my love.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's mouth fell open at the term of endearment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio indicated the room. “I’m getting in character…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed, feeling a bit embarrassed. Of course Rio hadn’t called </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> that. “Right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “Ah, Ash is ready, come on, they’re great, I’ve worked with them before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand and walked her over to the intimacy coordinator. “Hey Ash!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their eyes drifted to Rio and Agatha’s joined hands, before they traveled up to Rio’s face, a knowing smirk. “Well… will there even be a need for me today? Or will you two just?” They mimicked scissoring with their fingers, and while Agatha’s mouth ran dry, Rio laughed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, we’ll need you. We’re just cool.” She bumped her shoulder into Agatha’s. “So what's the plan?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash took some pasties out of their pocket and handed them over. Ash’s eyes looked between the pair of women in robes. “So these go on, unless…” They raised an eyebrow and Agatha took the stickers and lifted them in the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash nodded. “Okay. So it’s a real, like, romantic feel. I want Rio looking deep into your eyes, caressing your face, her hand will be out of shot here.” She tapped at Agatha’s hip. “That way it’ll look like she’s getting you off and I need you to just kinda… feel like you’re in the moment.” Ash pointed at Rio. “You two can discuss if it’ll be more helpful for you to tap or rub at her hip so you two can be in tune with each other.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash raised their hands in surrender. “No judgments if you actually get off. We’re all human and the body does what it wants to do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked at Agatha then back at Ash, “We’ll get set then discuss a few things. I am sure we’ll be ready to rehearse soon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash took off towards the cameraman to go over the vision.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned to Agatha, “Did you want help placing those?” Her eyes indicated the stickers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes widened in alarm. “No… No.” She watched as Rio shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay.” She walked away behind a curtain and Agatha was left floundering, Ash wandered back over. “So, I’m sure Rio will let you know, but like… no actual sex on my stage today, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha just about choked on her saliva. Ash patted at her back. “Sometimes people get a little overzealous with my choreo, but I promise, you will know where her hands are at all times. And you’re lucky you’re working with her. Rio’s totally respectful. I have had to intervene plenty of times when actor’s hands have wandered.” Ash patted at Agatha once more. “Good on you for taking a punt and going for a sex scene off the bat. Getting the first one out of the way is always a good idea.” They took off to check out where the two would be lying and Rio came back from the curtain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes staring at Agatha’s hand holding the stickers. “Those.” She pointed, “Go here.” She indicated where Agatha’s nipples must be under her robe. Agatha huffing and storming off to the same curtain to place them before reappearing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes taking note that her robe was no longer knotted. Agatha looked down at herself, growing too aware of her state of minimal dress. “What? Don’t I have to take it off in a moment?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes lifted as if she hadn’t heard a thing she had said, pressing her lips into a tight line as she hummed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pointed at Ash when they were waved over. “Duty calls, I guess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio followed her, a hand to Agatha’s lower back and Ash pointed where they would be. “Agatha, you are on your back, here. You can go ahead and take the robe off. I’ll slide the paper in place once you’re set.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers were quick as she undid her robe, sliding it off her shoulders she felt the chill in the room. Her heart was thundering until she saw Rio move to block the camera’s direct line of sight to her. Ash smiled. “See, a pro.” They patted the ground and Agatha laid down. Ash adjusting her hair, Jen rushing over to help.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes were wide as Jen got close to her. “Uh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen gave the same energy back as she set her hair just right before rushing off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes were trained on the ground as Agatha got set up, Ash moving to hand Agatha the paper. “Drape this where your underwear goes.” Agatha’s shaky fingers took the paper and placed it where she assumed it went. Jen ducking back over with quick fingers, adjusting it slightly. Giving her a thumbs up as she waited for something.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes glanced up and she took to her knees, sliding her robe from her shoulders and holding it out for Jen to take. She made sure her eyes didn’t stray from Agatha’s. Letting her know she was there with her the whole time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash indicated where Rio should lay and she carefully climbed on top of Agatha, her chest through her thighs pressing firmly into the other woman. Agatha tried to suppress a groan but failed, her eyes closing in embarrassment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, her voice quiet. “It’s fine. I have a hard time with beautiful women, too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes opened as Ash placed Rio’s arm on her right hip. Rio’s eyes flashed. “Shit. I’m sorry, did you want me to tap? Swipe my thumb? We forgot to discuss.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes lowered. “Swiping is fine.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded seriously. “Got it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash checked the placement. Then nodded at Agatha. “Tell her if you need her to stop. You can say stop or red. We’ll pull you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She licked her lips, she was panicking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash took Rio’s hand and placed it on Agatha’s chest. “I want this to start here, like you have to feel that it’s beating.” Agatha watched as Rio’s face took on the requested emotion. Ash nodded. Agatha shifted uncomfortably, there was no way Rio wasn’t noticing how quickly her heart was beating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good. Then I want you to lean forward and kiss her hungrily. Then count to maybe twenty. Then let's have that hand cup her face before drifting down her neck. Then I want your face to go here, right below her ear. You can puff some air there, or if you both are comfortable actually press your lips down. Then I’m thinking a bit of a throat grab, if we’re okay with that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both sets of eyes looked at each other then at Ash. Ash looked to Agatha first. “I’m thinking we pause there. Any questions? Anything we’re not okay with?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, Rio chiming in, “Seriously, Agatha, was there anything…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cleared her throat, needing to get started and have this over with before she either came or fainted. “No, I’m good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio relaxed, Agatha taking on her full weight. Rio didn’t lift her eyes as she mentally ran over the choreography before she spoke. “Okay. I’m good, Ash. I think I got the sequence.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash stepped away to check that Camera had the shot lined up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned forward to whisper in Agatha’s ear. “It’s just us…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “And like ten other people.” She shivered as Rio’s rumbled laughter reverberated in her body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe a few more than ten. No matter. I have an important question for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widened. “At a time like this?” She hissed and when Rio nodded she conceded “Okay…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked like she was having too much fun. “Have you never thought of having me like this? In a room full of strangers?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s breath was shallow, as that thought shot electricity straight to her crotch. “No…” it came out with a bit of a whine. She hadn’t thought about that before, but now that this was happening, she didn’t need Rio knowing she understood the appeal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio used her hand to stroke at her cheek, locking eyes with her. “Hm, that’s disappointing… because I have.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes were wide in shock and momentarily forgot where they were, and what they were doing. Rio’s husky voice came through her haze. “Follow my lead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“3….2….1….action!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes held Agatha in place before she dove in to kiss her, the kiss forceful, as if she was trying to subdue the woman below her. Agatha had never felt this kind of domination from Rio before. She fought the urge to fight back, to take control, as Rio continued to try and steal her breath. When Rio released her, her smile was gone, her eyes were now dilated as she cupped Agatha’s cheek for just a moment, as something that felt like lightning flashed between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand trailed a nail down her neck, her dark eyes, now pools of black, watching in anticipation. Agatha’s hips rolled and she almost broke the scene to apologize, luckily Rio dove into her neck, sucking lightly, feeling Agatha’s body slam back to the ground. Rio whispered lightly in her ear. “Keep going.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio panted into her skin as her hand gripped Agatha’s hip, rubbing a rhythm into her skin, Agatha started to move in time with it, it was actually driving her crazy. She started to pant, Rio whispering in her ear once more, quiet enough that the mics wouldn’t pick it up. “A little louder, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha complied and her head tilted back as she didn’t have to try hard to imagine Rio touching her a little further to the left. Rio lifted up a bit to look her in the eyes, her own mouth gasping a bit louder than normal as she laid her forehead down on her chest, Agatha’s hand coming up to hold the back of her head as she felt little puffs of air against her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The director’s cut was met with an unmoving Rio. Agatha felt as Rio’s hips jerked briefly. Ash gave them another moment before heading over and telling sound to move the boons, which they did, quickly, to give them a break.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash squatted for a moment. “Okay, that was gold. Let me go watch the playback and see if we need to run it again.” She took off a moment later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s head still rest on Agatha’s chest, her body heavy on Agatha’s own. Agatha hoped beyond hope that they wouldn’t need to move, because she was pretty sure she might have come from everything Rio had done. If the wetness dripping down her thighs was any indication.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash started to walk back over and Rio lifted her head, her breathing had evened out. “Well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ash smiled. “That was sick dude. Do you need a towel? I think that’s a wrap.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “Sweet.” She nodded and moved to remove herself from Agatha, Ash handing them their robes and two small hand towels. Rio held out Agatha’s robe so she could put it on first. Their fingers touching lightly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes avoided Rio’s as she hastily pulled on her robe and contemplated what to do with the paper beneath. Rio extended her hand. “Want me to deal with that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, her voice firm. “No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Pretty sure I came all over that, so it should be me that throws it away…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s chest turned red but she felt marginally better with Rio’s admission. She had been so gone that she hadn’t noticed how Rio had responded. She pushed her hair out of her face and shrugged. “I’m pretty sure I did too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio poked her tongue into the inside of her cheek as she looked at where she knew the paper was hiding. Agatha moved back slightly when Ash arrived with gloves, holding their hand out, Agatha awkwardly handing it over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Next time just let me take it off, so there's no risk of exchanging fluids. You should go wash your hands.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was nearly giddy. “Yeah. Agatha, you don’t know </span>
  <em>
    <span>where </span>
  </em>
  <span>I’ve been.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes at Rio’s antics. “I can just use a wet wipe if you have one?” Ash produced one on command. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You two, be good now.” They winked as they left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached a hand out to Agatha when she stood. “Wanna have lunch in your trailer?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s back hit the mattress and it wasn’t even a full moment later when her head snapped back, her back arching as she felt Rio tongue lick up the length of her slit. She was panting heavily as she tried to pull Rio in harder with her heel to the other woman’s back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s tongue swirling in an infinity pattern, if Agatha was able to track her correctly, which she had no idea if she was. One hand found Rio’s hair, and threaded her long fingers through soft black strands, while her other reached behind her and pushed at the wall. Her teeth were biting at her lip. “Yes, there.” She gasped as Rio hit a sensitive spot and she just about screamed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s head bobbed as she switched up the pattern she was making and Agatha let out a guttural groan at the change. She couldn’t think, couldn’t breathe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio blew on her and her breath hitched. Agatha attempted to lift herself to look at Rio but cried out instead. “Please, inside.” She gasped. “Inside.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was quick to follow her instructions and slipped three fingers easily into Agatha in her current state. The woman biting down on her lip, the metallic tang of blood heightening her arousal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio wiped at her chin as she focused on her fingers. “This is even better than on set.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha whimpered. Her body was tightening and she felt like everything in her would snap, and a moment later, she collapsed. She struggled desperately to bring air back into her lungs. Rio still deep inside of her. Agatha’s head fell to the side as full body tremors took over. “Stop.” She tried to push at Rio, but was too uncoordinated. The other woman abruptly slowed her movements before carefully extracting her fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes were lidded as she looked down at Rio, the woman locking eyes with her as she licked the wetness from her hand. Agatha’s eyes closed as she groaned. “I can’t go again yet, stop torturing me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio giggled as she crawled up her body and cuddled up with her. Agatha’s hand came to rest on her back. Rio tracing patterns on her chest. “See, you do like to cuddle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “Shut up.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio ducked her head and kissed lightly at Agatha’s chest. “We should probably go get Nicky from Jen soon. Think he’s torturing her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The older woman sighed. “Dear god I hope so.” Agatha’s mind was starting to wander back from their escapades when a thought nagged at her, like something was clawing at her brain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This how these scenes always end with you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio continued to kiss across Agatha’s skin. “Sometimes. Not always.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifted to get more comfortable, Rio sat up, sensing the real question. “I’m not seeing anyone else right now. How could I be? I’m always with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked off at the wall. She knew this wasn’t the time nor the place for this conversation, and yet, she couldn’t help herself. “I didn’t ask you to be exclusive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand came up to her naked chest. “No… you didn’t have to.” She folded her hair behind her ear as her eyes fell. “Did you want me to see other people?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved slowly to grab her robe. “What you do isn’t my business, Rio.” When she looked up again, she wished she hadn’t. There was a lot of depth behind the dark eyes before her, and she wasn’t sure she wanted to explore their meaning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “I don’t want to see other people. I’m sort of a one woman girl.” She looked at Agatha expectantly. “Do you want to see other people?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes panicked. “Rio…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman stood abruptly to gather her own robe. Agatha now freaking out for a whole different reason. This conversation was one thing, Rio leaving when she was upset was another entirely. “Where… where are you going?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio raised a hand. “Agatha, I need a moment. Just… let me go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood quickly moving to block the door. Her mind flashing warning signs. “No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes narrowed. “No?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded her head. “No… we’re. We’re not finished speaking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, her hand moving to cover her mouth as her eyes closed, seeking strength. “You just told me you want me to…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, angrily. “I didn’t! That's not what I said.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice rose so that she was yelling. “Then what the hell did you mean, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman leaned her back against the wall. Her heart was beating so rapidly that it hurt. She thought Rio would move her, toss her aside so she could escape, but she didn’t. She waited. When no one moved, Agatha looked around the room. Feeling guilty that she had upset Rio when she was aware it was her own insecurities at play. “I asked if me and Nicky are allowed to live here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s nostrils flared. “Cool.” Her tone was sharp.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised her hand before her. “Please, let me finish. I asked because I wanted to give you a way out. In case… you wanted your space back.” Her eyes pleaded for the woman to tell her there was no reason to stay somewhere else. “Would you, want your space back?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted, her body tensing as she thought she understood the message loud and clear. “You want to end things with me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes started to water, that was the last thing she wanted. “What are we even doing, Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “Nothing.” Her eyes glaring when they lifted. “I guess we’re not doing anything.” She indicated the door. “There, you’ve said your piece, now let me leave.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. How had this all gone down hill so fast? All she wanted was to know if Rio wanted her. If this was something different for the other woman, or if Agatha was just a phase she would move on from. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes widening, her voice exasperated. “You can’t have it both ways, Agatha!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha whimpered. Her shoulder’s drawing in. Her eyes flooded with tears. Rio took a step back, trying to ground herself. “Is this what you do? You push people away who care about you? Is this what happened with Jen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth was left hanging open before she landed on words. “Jen wasn’t… she was just for fun…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio growled. “Like me? What is it, Agatha? Are you only attracted to people who treat you like shit? Is </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>what gets you off?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand covered her mouth as she sobbed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stopped. Everything stopped. She moved forward on instinct, she pressed Agatha against the wall with her body, her hands gripping her face. “What do you want me to say?” her voice was quiet, verging on snapping the last shred of patience she held for her lover. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth opened and closed, she tried again but that’s all she could do. Her voice refused to come from her mouth. She felt as if she was being strangled and she couldn’t breathe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a calming breath, her eyes fluttering closed. “I love you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head fell back against the wall. Her eyes scrunching shut. “I don’t deserve that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, her eyes opening and her hand caressing Agatha’s cheek. “You can’t believe that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes fluttered open, her head rolling side to side. “You met my mother. I’ve told you about Tori. Why would something suddenly be different? Because it’s you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took her chin and brought it back to her, looking for something between her eyes. “That is exactly what makes things different.” Rio released her face. “Do you have feelings for me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha whined. “Stop…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “I can’t…just, tell me the truth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed her mouth shut as she couldn’t say the words but she nodded. Her hands grabbing at Rio’s hips. A quiet sound releasing past Agatha’s trembling lips. “Please.” She didn’t even know what she was begging Rio for, but the woman gathered her up in her arms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay.” Rio took a deep breath and blew it out quickly, her body releasing some of the tension. “Okay.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha held her in a vice-like grip. Her heart felt like it was about to stop beating from the pain she felt deep in her chest. She held on and waited for Rio to untangle herself and leave, but she never did. She just stood there holding Agatha as if she was never going to let her go.</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 29</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha had just arrived home from work and was exhausted. She felt more than heard her son and Rio’s dog come booming down the hall. Agatha planted her back foot, a bit worried one of them would take her down. But they both stopped, to her surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her son’s brown eyes shining up at her as he panted. “Hey, Momma!” He turned to pet Ruffland as he tried to catch his breath. “Do you know where my orange shorts went? I wanted to take them with me tonight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head drifted back in confusion, not remembering any plans. “And where is it that you think you are going tonight, Mister?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky tilted his head. “I’m spending the night at Lilia’s, she’s coming to get me within the hour.” He pointed at Ruffland. “He’s coming too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand lifted to twist around the necklace at her throat, another gift from her lover. “Hm… did Rio need the house to herself tonight?” She tried to dig without letting her son know she was internally unsettled. It would be when she started to settle in, that something would go wrong. Her mind drifted through too many scenarios about why Rio would possibly need the house cleared for. However the one thought she kept coming back to, made her feel as if she had eaten rotten fruit. Because why else would you need your roommates gone unless you didn’t want them to hear what you were doing?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her face fell. She had tried not to think too hard about it, but she thought things had been going well with Rio. She figured they weren’t officially a thing, but the other woman seemed to be getting what she needed out of their little situationship. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well maybe she had guessed wrong, read into things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As if summoned, Rio wandered out into the hall, pulling her hair up into a hair band, “Okay, Nicky, you guys have forty five minutes, what else do you need?” Her eyes lifted when she saw Agatha and she leaned into her space to give her a kiss on the cheek. Agatha felt a small fracture appear in her heart. This is how Rio was going to treat her before asking her to go somewhere else tonight?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand came up to run through Nicky’s hair as he babbled on about the tricks he was going to teach Ruff and Benny, Rio listening intently. “Those sound good, I can’t wait to see them.” As he hustled down the hall, Rio’s hands moved to try and take Agatha’s jacket from her shoulders, the woman turning quickly out of her hold. “Won’t I be needing this?” She raised an eyebrow and Rio’s eyes looked her up and down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Considering we are staying in? No, I don’t think so. Unless, you had somewhere to be?” She held out her hand and Agatha removed her arms from the jacket slowly as she locked her gaze on Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why is my son going to Lilia’s?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took her coat and turned to hang it in the coat closet. “I thought it would be nice for us to have a night to ourselves.” When she turned back around and saw the anger flashing in blue eyes she paused. “I… wanted to surprise you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha crossed her arms. “By sending my son away to go stay with a stranger?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “You’ve had Lilia watch Nicky plenty of times…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha interrupted. “Not overnight!” Her hands lifted in the air like she was trying to hold the world back from finally crushing her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio ran her hand through her hair. “I didn’t know you would have an issue with Lilia watching him. In all honesty, I did ask Jen first, but she was busy later tonight…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes widened. “Why would you ask </span>
  <em>
    <span>Jen</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rubbed at her forehead as she wandered to the kitchen, Agatha hot on her heels. “Because she’s an old friend of yours, and she has </span>
  <em>
    <span>also</span>
  </em>
  <span> been watching Nicky plenty on set.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “Jen is </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> my friend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took out the water pitcher from the fridge, casting a look over her shoulder at the other woman. “Really, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha plopped herself down into an island chair. “First my mother wants to take my son away… and now you </span>
  <em>
    <span>send </span>
  </em>
  <span>him away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned. “It’s for one night, and if it bothers you that badly then tell me he’s not allowed to go, and be done with it.” She flicked her hand at Agatha and her dramatics. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pouted and let her eyes fall to the marble countertop. She knew Lilia would take good care of Nicky, hell, she even knew Jen could, but what she couldn't fathom was why Nicky would need to be out of the house. What had caused Rio’s mind to change so suddenly? Why was he no longer welcome? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know you probably want a break from having a child around. It’s not for everyone. Me and Nicky can go stay in my trailer for a few days. Or I can talk to Lilia about…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “What the hell are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha chewed on her lip as she pointed down the hall. Her voice lowered so her son wouldn’t hear her. “You don’t want him here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, letting her back fall against the counter, her arms gripping the marble, looking like she was struggling to maintain control of her volume. “Agatha, it's not that I don’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>want </span>
  </em>
  <span>Nicky here tonight… it’s just probably better that he’s not here for what I have planned.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head landed in her hand. Her face was full of hurt when Rio moved across the kitchen to lean over the countertop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry I didn’t ask. I wanted… to see if you wanted to try… out the couch. And Nicky definitely shouldn’t be here for that.” Her hands trying to reach for Agatha, sure that now the woman would stop freaking out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s face tensed. “I’ve been on the couch…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio just about smacked herself in the face. Instead, she shook her head and lifted Agatha’s chin with a single finger. “Not while you bent me over it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s underwear suddenly felt… uncomfortable. “Excuse me?” She shifted, thinking she must have heard Rio wrong, and now her mind was in the gutter. And her panties were ruined, </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>was fast. Though it had been a few days since they…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio watched her gaze, realizing either Agatha was clueless or playing dumb. “Your post? I figured we could… have some fun. You’ve had a long week at work, and I know it’s been a big adjustment for you. Coming to LA and getting right into an intense filming schedule but…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes finally looked up, flashing with understanding. “You wanted to try…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, her hand moving to Agatha’s arm and rubbing gently. “A naughty night in? Yes. But we don’t have to.” She moved to leave the table when a pale hand caught hers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nicky can… go to Lilia’s,” She caught herself as she quickly adjusted her statement, “Just for tonight. I want him back first thing in the morning.” Her eyes looked guilty. She hadn’t been away from Nicky often, and leaving him made her feel like she was failing as a parent. She didn’t want him to feel neglected, not like she did growing up. Having one terrible mother was enough, Agatha didn’t need to rise to the occasion and give Nicky two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “Whenever you want us to get up and go get him, is fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers traced the lines in the marble. “So you want me… to be in control?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned her elbows on the counter, knowing her tank top showed some cleavage. “I would like that, yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth felt dry. Her mind started to conjure visions of Rio’s ass, if she had the pleasure of bending her forward over the dark green couch. She was getting lost in the idea when unhelpful thoughts wandered in to cock block her. Would Rio be done with her after tonight? She shook her head and was about to speak when the doorbell rang. Rio’s head turning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, that will be Jen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat back in her seat. “Jen? I thought Lilia…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded as she moved around Agatha to the front door. The latter jumped up quickly to follow her. “Yes, Lilia is taking Nicky and Ruff, but I thought… we could use a little glam tonight.” She moved to open the door, not giving Agatha even a moment to run and hide.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jen, thank you for coming.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tall black woman swept in gracefully. “No worries, thanks for the extra gig. I’m sure you ladies have some very important event to get to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pursed her lips and nodded as Rio shrugged. “Not really.” She pointed at Agatha. “I just know this one feels more confident when she’s all made up. Did you two need anything or should I just, go get myself ready?” Her eyes floating between Agatha and Jen, Jen taking the lead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope, we’re all good here. I’ll have her all ready for you in about an hour.” She smiled and Rio’s hand glided across Agatha’s back before she retreated down the hall and up to her room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s eyes settled on Agatha. “There’s totally nothing going on </span>
  <em>
    <span>there</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha crossed her arms, scoffing. “There’s not. She’s… just my roommate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s eyes narrowed. “Really? Roommate? Are we going with </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>stereotype?” Agatha shrugged and Jen rolled her eyes. “Where are we doing this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned and pointed to the living room just off the foyer, clearly a split second decision. “There.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s hand came to rub at her face. “Agatha, I'm doing hair and makeup. I need lights, outlets, mirrors,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s arms crossed. “This is Rio’s private home, Jennifer, I don’t think it's a great idea for you to be creeping around all over it…” Her mouth was left open as Jen started to take off down the hall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The bathroom is this way, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha floundered as she trailed after her. “Jen! This is inappropriate…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Brown eyes were more focused on figuring out where they needed to go than on Agatha’s tantrum. “I’ve signed an NDA as I keep reminding you, relax. Her brows lifted at an open door with a bag she recognized as Agatha’s hanging on the door knob. “Ah, here we go…” She wandered in and started to move things off of the chair at the desk, when her eyes landed on a sketchpad. An image of Rio, sans clothing, lying open in the middle of the wooden desk, her eyes widening as Agatha dove in front of her and closed the book. “Would you, get out…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen snorted. “Once I have you looking like you are about to go walk a red carpet, gladly.” She narrowed her gaze. “Clean up your shit so I can work.” She wandered to the bathroom to grab a few things, leaving Agatha to tidy the desk. Jen called her into the bathroom a moment later, “Just bring your chair in here, the lighting’s better. Agatha just about snarled. Why was it she had to go through her things in the first place if they were just going to wind up in the bathroom?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She brought the chair and dropped it with thud. Jen closing her eyes to try and hold her sanity within her. “Rude.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha plopped into the chair. Her hands out with a flourish and her legs parted, “You don’t need to be here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen picked up a brush and spray bottle. Ecstatic to spray down Agatha’s hair, getting plenty of water all over her face. “Jen!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The other woman smirked. “Well, you could just hop in the shower and wet this down for me. If you want? Or I can continue to drown you, your choice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha glared. “Really? Me, get naked, with you, in Rio’s own house…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen took a step towards her, Agatha scooting back in her chair. “Why does it matter if I see you naked? One, I already have, plenty of times, and two,” Her eyes analyzed Agatha’s facials, “You two are just… friends, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood abruptly, ripping off her clothes, casting them about the floor and moved past Jen to start the shower, barely waiting for it to be warm enough to get in, a sharp breath echoed against the walls as the chill of the water hit her lungs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A creak in the chair let Agatha know Jen had sat down. She washed her hair quickly, then let the conditioner sit while she shaved. She hissed as she miscalculated the pressure and a tiny cut on her ankle sent blood trickling across the bottom of the shower into the drain. Jen spoke up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You better not be killing yourself in there…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stuck her head out of the shower briefly. “You. Wish.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen shook her head. “Agatha. Could you be an adult for like five minutes. I have never hated you that badly.” Jen’s gaze held something that almost looked like an ounce of fondness lived in her soul for Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The brunette, not wanting to figure out what that actually meant, grunted. “Could have fooled me.” When Jen didn’t say anything further, she rinsed off and flung the curtains open before grabbing a towel, Jen’s eyes narrowing in on her cut before she moved to grab a wad of toilet paper to staunch the bleeding. “Sit down, Harkness. My gods you’re a mess!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha limped a little to sit in the chair. Jen raising her foot and placing it on the toilet. “Let’s hope you don’t bleed out before we’re through.” Her eyes lifted as she heard the tell tale sounds of her son’s arrival, Nicky’s little hands opened the bathroom door gently. “Hi, Auntie Jen.” His voice was bright and caused the other woman to smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Nicky.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha wanted to rip her child away from Jen. Who did she think she was telling him she was his aunt?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky climbed up on the sink and sat swinging his legs. “If you paint momma’s nails can I get the same color?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved to speak, but so did Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen ignored Agatha, “If we don’t have time tonight, I’ll make sure we do them the next time you’re on set.” She added a wink and the little boy brightened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can I get eye shadow too?” And before Agatha could respond, Jen tapped Nicky on the nose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You bet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The little boy giggled, his eyes looking to the hall as he heard Rio calling for him. “I gotta go make sure I’m ready.” He took off and Jen shook her head fondly. “He’s so cute… and… eccentric.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s tone darkened. “Call him gay and I’ll cut out your tongue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s eyes widened, surprised. “Agatha… </span>
  <em>
    <span>you’re </span>
  </em>
  <span>gay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The brunette mumbled something unintelligible and let her eyes focus on the red droplets that were tinting the toilet paper. Jen started in on her hair, running some product through her long chocolate strands before she got out a diffuser. “We’re going to make these pop. I think that will really compliment your wild look.” As Agatha remained quiet, Jen focused on her work. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Brown eyes noticed the way Agatha tried to sink into her chair. Her eyes were not even glancing up to see Jen’s progress in the mirror. Jen’s empathy must have been stirring because when she looked at Agatha’s defeated body language, she couldn’t not say something to try and lift her spirits. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t take this the wrong way, given our history, but you’re pretty good looking, Agatha. I mean, there’s a reason I went to the woods with you that day.” As she felt the woman relax a bit Jen couldn’t help her teasing streak. “It’s such a shame about your personality, though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned and launched like she was going to throttle her. When Jen screamed, a smile firmly appeared on her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m just messing with you! Goddess.” She batted her away and Agatha fought the smile that threatened to appear on her own face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop being mean.” Agatha settled back into her chair, attempting to get comfortable this time, her eyes hesitated as she looked up into the mirror. Her eyes taking in the way her waves seemed to have come to life, as if the world had never beaten her down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen took a look at Agatha’s pleased smile and couldn’t help herself. “If y'all make a baby tonight, it better be named after me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's face ended up in her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky had kissed his Momma and Rio goodnight before he left with Ruff and Lilia. As the door closed, Agatha felt her stomach tighten. How were they about to do this? Would Rio expect her to take over right now? She was left staring at the closed door when Rio reached forward and took her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wanna get high?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s body relaxed at the invitation, that would definitely help her with enjoying herself tonight, and getting her in the right headspace to give Rio what she wanted. She needed to not be self conscious for what she was about to do.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio walked Agatha back to her office and released her hand as Agatha sat looking around the room. Rio moved to open a box high on a shelf. “Thought this should get moved out of the way with Nicky here.” She held up a few bags. “Edible? Blunt?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha walked forward and took the rolled up paper. Rio smirking. “Okay, but we smoke it into the air filter, don’t need the house smelling like weed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes looked over at the filter in question. “Got a lighter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded as she moved to pull one from another drawer near the filter, also producing an incense tray. She let her hand linger on Agatha’s a moment as she placed the lighter in her outstretched hand. “Light her up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a step towards the filter and snapped the flame to light, her other hand bringing the paper to the flame. The smoke already fanning to life, Rio quickly moved her closer to the filter laughing. “Agatha, get closer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She smirked. Lifting the blunt to her lips and letting her eyes drink in Rio tonight. She wore a deep green swimsuit top with a lime green netting over it, not hiding much from sight. On bottom she wore a tight pair of fitted black shorts. Agatha took a long drag and held the smoke in her lungs for a while before she turned and pressed her lips to the machine, releasing the smoke into the filter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Okay, you didn’t need to make out with her in front of me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Why? Are you jealous?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand and brought the weed to her mouth, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s as she sucked. When she leaned back she blew the weed toward the filter but not directly into it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha glared. “Okay, that is not going to help the air quality in here.“ Rio waved her off. “That thing is plenty powerful, trust me.” She took the blunt from Agatha and took more and then more again, the other woman genuinely surprised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“More already? Afraid I won’t be that good?” Agatha flipped her hair out of her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio licked her lips as she took in Agatha’s outfit. The shimmery purple top, her hair back in a low but wild pony, and her black slacks were making it hard for the woman to keep her mouth closed. “Oh, I know you’ll be good, honey.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took the blunt from Rio’s fingers and took another hit, blowing out the smoke closer to the machine. “Are there any ground rules?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat up on her desk. “If I ask you to stop, then stop. I won’t though… ask you, I mean.” She let her eyes zero in on Agatha’s fingers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha walked up between Rio’s parted legs, her head already feeling floaty. Her hand coming up her map Rio’s jaw line. “You’re brave.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her thighs clench around Agatha, she shrugged. “You won’t hurt me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned forward, so that her breath was ghosting over Rio’s ear, the vibration alone causing the woman to shiver. “Are you sure?” She felt Rio take in a sharp breath but incline her head in the affirmative nonetheless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pouted. “Darling, it’s no fun if you know that. A little fear is healthy.” She lifted a hand and gripped Rio’s throat firmly. The younger woman gasped slightly, Agatha’s hand increasing her grip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think I like this sound.” She groaned as Rio's eyes started to roll back from pleasure. Agatha’s hand loosening and before she could release her, Rio’s hand covered hers to keep it in place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s breath came quickly. Her eyes searching Agatha’s blue before dipping to her lips, Agatha let her lean forward and capture the kiss, letting Rio hold the reins for a moment before she grabbed a letter opener that sat on the corner of the table and put the blunt end to Rio’s throat. Feeling Rio’s body tense under the pressure of the moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How much do you trust me?” Agatha hissed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hips bucked into her even as she tried not to move. Rio didn’t speak at first, her eyes closed as she smiled, like there was some inner joke she shared with just herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice came out steady when she did speak. “Miss Harkness, you could probably stab me with that little knife you have there… and I would thank you.” She chuckled. “Isn’t that what the kids say?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned the knife around and carefully pressed it to Rio’s skin, the woman going completely still. Dark eyes looked up at Agatha unwavering. Her playful jokes were gone, but she didn’t ask the other woman to stop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her voice deepen. “And now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand came up to grab Agatha’s wrist. “I’d let you.” She swallowed thickly, Agatha had to be careful not to cut her. “If you wanted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand came away and Rio heaved a breath. “Fuck, Agatha…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman set the item inside the desk drawer and Rio whimpered, clenching her thighs. “Couch. Now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled, “Someone is needy.” Rio stood on shaky legs a bit too quickly, Agatha catching her around her waist so she didn’t stumble.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The dark haired woman, once righted, pulled Agatha from the room and down the hall, turning and forcing Agatha’s face to hers as they entered the tv room. Rio walked backwards until the top of her thighs hit the back of the couch, promptly sitting. Her hands a mess in Agatha’s hair not wanting her to get away for even a moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s body was on fire but it wasn’t lost on her how badly Rio wanted her. There was no way this woman could be this good of an actress for as high as she was right now. This had to be real. Rio groaned when Agatha bit down on her lip. Rio’s hands grabbed Agatha’s and tried to move them to her pants when Agatha shook her head, keeping her voice quiet. “No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest heaved as she tried to come back to herself. “No?” Eyes flashing with uncertainty. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. Placing her hands on the couch, on either side of Rio’s hips. Leaning forward, close enough to kiss her. “That’s not what you want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked down at Agatha’s hands. “You’re wrong. I really want those,” She clenched her thighs. “Inside me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked, her smile cruel. “I didn’t say you wouldn’t have them.” She took a step back and beckoned Rio to her, “Come here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stood carefully and took a step toward Agatha, the woman halting her. “Take off your pants.” Rio’s hands moved quickly, shoving the cloth from her hips. Agatha circled her for a moment taking her in, “Well..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s breath was coming out in short puffs, she tried to swallow, Agatha placed a hand behind her back and turned her around to face the couch, stopping her before she could tumble forward. Agatha gently moved her hair away from her neck as she bent down and sucked below her ear, Rio tipping her head back to give her access. Agatha chuckled as she released her skin, her legs spreading to trap Rio against the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand pressed just above Rio’s lower back. “Down.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a moment before she bent forward. Her ass on full display, her face turned and her cheek pressing against the pillows. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha grabbed her hips. “Hm, You’re right. I do like this position.” Blue eyes took in the moment when Rio’s thighs tried to rub together, Agatha kicking them apart. Pale hands came up to massage Rio’s ass, the woman releasing a guttural groan and collapsing the rest of her weight against the couch. </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>Agatha smirked. “You’re so </span>
  <em>
    <span>dirty</span>
  </em>
  <span>. And to think that everyone thinks you would be the dominant one. You wouldn’t would you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “No. Not… for everyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt that one in her chest. She felt like it was torture to not know. “Who would you be willing to dominate, Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shifted uncomfortably as her voice was strained. “You… if you wanted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt her stomach clench. She loved that Rio would do it for her, but she loved the heady power Rio allowed her to take up in their dynamic even more. Agatha let one finger start at Rio’s clit, feeling her tremor, and trailed it back up. “You like to be submissive, don’t you?” Rio gasped. Agatha tilted her head musing. “All that wasted bravado, who’s that for?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pressed her hips backward. “Please, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The other woman let out a breath as she bumped her clothed crotch against Rio’s open legs, unplanned. Sighing when she heard Rio begin to beg.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked down in front of her, letting one hand trail down Rio’s spine. “Do you like to be spanked?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to get her words out. “I don’t… know. I’ve never…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha trailed a single nail up her back. “We can see.” She closed her eyes as she let the pads of her fingers take in Rio’s soft skin. “Pressure?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio mewled before responding. “Firm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. Her hand clicked back before firmly colliding with Rio’s right cheek, not too hard, but firm. Rio gasped. “Shit.” Her face pressed down into the couch. Her voice came out muffled as she made her request. “More.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved her hand sharper this time, still making sure she was holding back from creating actual pain. Rio yelped this time, her hips bucking hard into the couch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rubbed at the spot. “I have something else I would like to try.” She reached forward and massaged at Rio’s lower back, feeling that the muscles were tense under her touch. “I think you’re about done in this position.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. “Where are your toys?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brain took a moment to come back online, but she found the information. “My closet. The tall dresser. Top drawer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed. “I’ll be right back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She walked down the hall slowly. She took the stairs with care, as she didn't need to go tumbling up or down them when she had better things to do than spend the night at the ER. When she got to Rio’s room, she had hoped she would find a strap, but what she found, was even better. A feeldoe. This would do nicely, if it didn’t slip out of her. She groaned at the mental image of placing it with how aroused she already was. If this was going to be her last night with Rio, she was going to make it count.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She grabbed the wand and ventured back downstairs. Her smile reappeared when she saw that Rio’s ass remained in the air, just where she had left her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood behind her, not touching her. “Good girl.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted. So she </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>still awake. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Good.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Agatha’s hands moved to undo her pants and let them slide to the floor. Her fingers gripping her thong without a care and pulling it down her body, her eyes coming face to face with Rio’s ass. She took a steadying breath before she stood. She moved to insert one end of the device, the bulb, into herself and as predicted, it went in fairly easily. Luckily it was big enough that once it slipped in, it wouldn’t just be falling back out. Agatha sighed. Her eyes looking down at Rio, as if forgetting she was there. “Ah, you.” She leaned forward and felt how Rio’s entire body tensed when she felt the toy against her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned forward and pulled Rio’s hips back to her, the woman weak as she lifted her body up and away from the couch, slowly. She walked Rio around the couch, her eyes clenching with each step, as the toy shifted. “Fuck.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laid down on the sofa, completely exhausted. Her warm eyes looked up at Agatha as if she were everything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes had to look away because she was worried Rio’s eyes might have the power to destroy her. She worried that the looks cast her way might make her float off into space. She held the thing between her legs as she straddled Rio and placed it at her entrance, Rio's hips shifting back a bit. Her eyes lidded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It might. Be too big.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Did we reach red?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio thought about it for a moment, then shook her head. “No, just… slowly?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her game loosening a bit at Rio’s request. “Of course.” She leaned forward slightly and Rio took a big breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want to…” her voice desperate and on the verge of apologizing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. “Let me see if I can help. “She leaned forward and shifted one of Rio’s swimsuit cups out of the way, leaving her nipple poking through the net webbing of her top. Her tongue swiped over it before taking the whole thing into her mouth and sucking gently. When fingers threaded into her hair and pulled, she sucked harder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped into the air, letting her know it was having its desired effect on her. Agatha let a hand drift between her legs and found renewed wetness, her hand gripping the toy and giving slight pressure to see if it wanted to go in. Rio’s head snapped back as it slid into place, her scream echoing off the walls.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “Yeah… I get kicking my kid out now. The neighbors probably heard that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes were shut tight. “Shut up, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thin lips smirked. “Make me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes tried to open, but they lost their battle, but Rio </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>successful in lifting her hips, the shockwave that went through Agatha was almost immediate. Her mouth fell open as she panted. “Rio… ah…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman on bottom snorted. “Got ya.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head lowered to her chest as she rolled her hips to thrust into the younger woman, her own part of the shaft plunging deeper within herself. “Shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pressed her body down on the device and tried to ride it herself, Agatha lost to the feeling of the thing moving inside of her. Neither was sure who came first, only that there were matching screams that reverberated around the room before they both collapsed, the toy still holding them intimately together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t know how to slow her breathing, and gave up trying as she fell in and out of consciousness. At some point, the toy became too annoying in her sensitive body, everytime she breathed she felt an electric pulse, so she moved to slowly remove it from her lover. Taking care to make sure it came out without causing pain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once it slipped out of Rio, she took a moment to relax and coax it out from herself as well. She laid down next to her lover, her own body now a heap on the couch. She tried to find her bearings in her post sex high.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before she could try and move or even try and speak, she felt Rio curl into her and she felt her chest constrict. Rio flung a leg over her as her body twitched at the contact. The younger woman’s arms circling Agatha like a koala. Agatha’s hand came up to play with Rio’s hair as she let her other arm caress Rio’s trembling back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her voice was quiet as she let her insecurities get the best of her. “Was that okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “That was fucking evil, Agatha. I loved it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s chest swelled with pride as she held on to Rio. “Better than I imagined it in my head when I wrote that post, that’s for sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nuzzled into her. “It was better than in my dreams, too.” Her hand blindly reached for the blanket that was somehow still on the couch and pulled it down over them. And as Rio started to snore on Agatha’s chest, Agatha also found herself drifting into a deep sleep.</span>

  <h1>
  <span>CHAPTER 30 </span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha’s glasses sat prominently on her face as she sat in bed reading through the next part of the script. The flashback scene with Rio had her tensing her grip on the papers so tightly that her knuckles popped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was Rio’s character in the scene that begged Agatha’s for a baby. Her eyes continued to read as a crawling feeling invaded her system. Her mind drifted to the moment Tori had told her they were having a baby. She shivered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She also knew how Rio felt about children. She couldn’t imagine shooting this scene and how uncomfortable it would make Rio. How could they navigate this? She set the script aside as she pondered how to navigate the sensitive topic. The woman in question must have been summoned by her thoughts alone, as she came bounding into the room. Flopping onto her bed, with a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey you.” Her voice was light but her smiled fell the moment she found Agatha’s eyes. “What’s wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha removed her glasses, Rio taking them and gently placing them on the nightstand. Her hand indicated the script. “I see you’re hard at work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, folding her hair behind her ear to stall. “I’m trying to prepare.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat up. “Okay, did you need help with something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand landed on Rio’s thigh, her hand moving back and forth, a bit shocked that she could do this now. Not only that she felt like she could reach out and touch the woman in front of her, but that she was even allowed to. Her eyes watched as her nails turned to scrape lightly at Rio’s skin. “Did… you read the next script?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved a bit closer to Agatha, indicating that she enjoyed the feeling and the other woman should keep going. “Yeah, I did.” She didn’t give any indication that anything was off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha lifted her gaze. “You don’t have a problem begging me for a child? You don’t like them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes. “My </span>
  <em>
    <span>character</span>
  </em>
  <span> asked your </span>
  <em>
    <span>character</span>
  </em>
  <span> for one. I’m an actor, it doesn’t bother me. I know what’s real.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifted her eyes searching. “Do you?’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “Most times.” She shrugged, taking Agatha’s fingers and playing with them. “Sometimes I don’t know what I want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s brows drew together. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes looked away. “I just…yes, this job can get confusing. At times I can get lost in a character, lose touch with myself a bit. I’m… good at manipulating my emotions. And also,” she bit her lip waring with some secret she was scared of unearthing. “I might be beginning to understand what you did for Tori. I may… understand how you were feeling when...” Rio let her voice trail off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head tilted. “Meaning?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to scoot back, but Agatha gripped her leg. “Tell me.” Her eyes begging Rio to speak. “Please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The girl looked up and laughed at herself as she looked away. “I just… have been thinking… about freezing my eggs.” She shrugged. “It’s not a big deal and I just… know you don’t want more kids and didn’t want to freak you out,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widened, her voice cutting Rio off. “Neither do you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, slowly. “Yeah… that’s what I thought.” She tried to smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “What if you wanted another…someday.” Her eyes lifted. “I would want you to have everything you wanted.” Her shoulders, drawing in. “We’re getting older and what if one day you decided you want another but we… can’t. I mean…” She looked at Agatha sadly. “You are a little bit older than me, and you already did the hard part once, I feel like it would be my turn to… if you wanted Nicky to have a sibling.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head shook. Her feelings all over the place. “Rio…” It’s not like she hadn’t thought about it. She hadn’t wanted children, but she loved Nicky. And she often worried about leaving him alone in the world if something happened to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her cheek. “It just, gives us options.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha couldn’t hold her own flood of emotions anymore. Rio didn’t even know the half of what her and her ex-wife went through. “Me and Tori did try for another baby after Nicky.” Her breathing speeding up. “I…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s gaze locked on Agatha’s face, concerned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed her eyes and her voice was so quiet Rio almost couldn’t hear her and that was by design. “The hormones were worse the last time.” She gripped the covers. “I thought it would fix things. If the second baby was less like me. We had just found out after she met…” Her voice took on a gravely tone, “Heather.” She let out her breath slowly, her eyes remaining closed, she felt she was calmer this way if the world was dark. “She knew we were pregnant when she told me and Nicky to go… I ended up in the hospital, losing the baby.” She took another breath. “Nicky… he was there with me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shook her head. “I can’t have you repeat my mistakes, Rio. It’s selfish,” Her eyes shone with tears. “You don’t… you shouldn’t want that with me, not because of me.” She opened her eyes and Rio’s eyes were raw. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It has nothing to do with her, or making you love me. I…” she bit her tongue before she lost her temper. “I know you love me… even if you can’t say it. I just… want that with you, sometimes. So what is the issue with just having the option?” Rio sighed when Agatha shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked away. “I already have an appointment to pick up the hormones.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands fell, despair in her eyes. “Oh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rubbed her face. “Do you want me to stop?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand covered her eyes as she sucked in air. “What I want is for you to not go through what I did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached out slowly, just lightly placing her hand on Agatha’s ankle. “It’s just extracting eggs, my love.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha whimpered. “That’s not fun, I…would know.” The pain, the loneliness, the suffocating ripple of the hormonal fluctuations, everything was flooding back to her as if it might drown her this time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rubbed her thumb up and down. “I don’t want you to worry. I can do the process on my own, you don’t have to see any of it. Then… one day… if we need them, we have them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to keep breathing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio removed her hand. “Are you scared I’ll use them?” Her eyes took in the very physical reaction Agatha was having to this conversation. Verging on a panic attack. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened her eyes. “I don’t want you to get hurt.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cupped her face, offering her a quiet smile. “My love, you can’t protect me from everything.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached for her lover’s hands. “Just let me do this much. Please?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifted, she tried to suppress a whimper. It hurt almost as much as if Rio had asked her to carry another baby. Perhaps worse because what if something happened to Rio because of her? Agatha’s voice was quiet when she spoke. “If you… must do this… I’ll be there.” Her eyes lifted, full of tears. “Please, let me be there.” Her hands gripped Rio, worried she would disappear before her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned forward and kissed her. “Of course. If you want to be a part of it, I won’t stop you.” She let her hands hold Agatha’s face as her thumbs wiped away Agatha’s tears, neglecting her own. “We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. We don’t have to use them. Just let me make sure we have the option.”</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 31 </span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second sext-IT came when Agatha had finally made it to her trailer after many hours of filming, desperate for a nap. The same colored lime green sticky note staring her in the face as she went to open her trailer and noticed it on her door. She ripped it off, her eyes scanning the letters. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm feeling horny. I think I’ll do you.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gulped. Okay, these were getting worse. Is this what it was like to have fans? Cause she felt like she had a stalker. Her hands were unsteady as she unlocked her trailer – luckily a keycode she had chosen and only one other person knew. On second thought she changed it. Couldn’t be too careful with the post-it sexter on the loose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She almost cried when she dropped onto her bed. Her call time had been 4AM and she had wanted to shoot herself. Rio had gotten to sleep in until nine and have breakfast with Nicky. She was so jealous. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha popped her neck before she pushed up on her elbows, her makeup still firmly in place from the scene she had just shot with Rio. The way they bounced off of each other was competitive. The exes going for each other's throats had Agatha feeling exhausted as she walked away to go relax in her trailer. She hadn’t even paused to check in with Rio after the scene. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sat up and started to remove what she had been wearing for the scene when there was a knock at her door, her hands coming up to cover her chest as she moved from the bed and found her robe, tying it quickly before answering the intruder. When she opened it, Rio quickly let herself in and closed the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her eyes were red, searching for something in Agatha’s gaze. The older woman looked around a bit confused, wondering what Rio was needing at the moment. They had just been together and she had said nothing to her as they were told it was a wrap. She had assumed she would have disappeared to her own trailer, but apparently the woman had dropped by hers instead, after retrieving her clothing from wardrobe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio, still wore her green eye makeup. She stood twisting the ends of her sleeves in her hands. “Can we…” she gulped. “Talk?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widened as she turned and swept her arm at the couch. “Sure.” She watched as Rio brushed past her and collapsed onto the furniture. Her sniffles gnawing at Agatha’s heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha wanted to know what was going on and though she thought they had just done a pretty good job back on set, she couldn’t quite get herself to ask if Rio was unsatisfied with their performance. She crossed her arms and tapped her fingers on her elbow, waiting and waiting until she felt like she was about to snap. And when she did, she let one arm sweep the room. “Well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio curled herself tighter on the couch as she sucked in air. “That was… a lot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widened. “It was a fight between two ex-wives. I think we did a pretty dynamic job with the script.” She sighed exasperated as she moved to get a makeup wipe to clean her face. “What was wrong with it?” Her stomach going sour at what she assumed was going to be a critique of her constructed emotions. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio blew out a breath, her voice rough. “Did you have to go so hard with the punches?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes lifted to see Rio through her mirror, her eyes were begging Agatha to turn around and see her, really look at her, and give her her undivided attention. Agatha turned slowly, sensing that something was definitely off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The scene called for it… Do you think I was over acting? I thought my performance was believable…” She had been very insecure starring opposite a seasoned vet like Rio. Most days she was waiting for someone to tell her that her being on set was one big joke and to leave. She had only played around with acting in school and at first found it hard to give it her all in front of her lover, as if Rio might laugh at her. When in reality, once they got into a scene, Rio made her feel safe enough to actually play with her emotions and reach for the deepest parts of her soul to deliver her lines.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her cheek, “It was believable alright.” She dug her heel into the couch. “I could have sworn the scene was actually about me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes took in Rio’s posture, the way she sat, the way her words were less direct then normal. How the woman clearly felt hurt by the words that had been hurtled at her. Words that were written on a page in their current script. They seemed to have hit on a much deeper level than she should have been to locate in Rio’s heart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved to kneel on the floor, placing her hands on Rio’s legs, trying to encourage them to settle from where they were tensely pulled to the other woman’s chest. As she ran her fingers up and down, she was able to get Rio to release some of the tension in them, her legs dropping into a crossed formation. Agatha’s hands slid up to cover her thighs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio… We </span>
  <em>
    <span>were </span>
  </em>
  <span>just acting.” Her voice was a bit surprised that this situation had occurred at all. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A sharp retort was delivered louder than was necessary. “Were </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t remove her hands but her eyes dropped down to watch their path before she looked back up, licking her lips before she nodded. “Yeah… I was.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand came up to cover her face, Agatha softly hushing her. “Rio… it’s okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When blue eyes saw fat tears starting to roll down her lover’s cheeks, she tried again. “Rio, this is just a job…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman groaned. “Sure it is. Manipulating your emotions is a totally healthy and normal thing to do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned up on her knees and placed her hands on either side of Rio’s waist. “It’s sort of… what you have been doing for a while now, yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked away angrily as if she would rather look anywhere than at Agatha. “I don’t do </span>
  <em>
    <span>this. </span>
  </em>
  <span> I don’t pretend I hate the person I am secretly seeing. Wishing they were dead. I don’t…” She gasped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cupped her cheek but Rio moved out of her reach. “Rio, have you never had a scene like this before? Because I swear you have fought with people on screen in a romantic manner…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shouted. “Not with someone I’m in love with!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat back on her heels. Her eyes wide, taking in Rio’s red rimmed eyes. The weight of the hurt settled in Agatha’s stomach, making her sick. “I hurt you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed. “Yeah. Sex scenes create a physical reaction and it would seem that yelling at someone might create some kind of emotional consequence as well.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled sadly. “I’ve never cared enough about anyone before to… fuck Agatha, we have to go home after this, and I can’t get the words you yelled at me out of my head!” She dipped her head down covering her ears with her hands before she moved to smack her palm to her forehead so loud that Agatha quickly grabbed her wrist, afraid she would do it again or do something worse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop… stop. I’m sorry.” She frantically grabbed both of Rio’s hands when the woman struggled in her grasp.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha…” Her tone was a warning, but Agatha dug deeper. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There has to be something else… I… I do understand, okay? Me saying those things… they hurt you. I am sorry about that. We should start prepping for scenes with more care. I don’t want to hurt you again. But this…” She realized she was walking into dangerous territory. “Seems… a bit extreme.” She felt as Rio ripped her hands out of her care, the older woman landing on her ass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It always feels like this! I just don’t normally </span>
  <em>
    <span>care </span>
  </em>
  <span>so much.” She started to sob now when Agatha sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let Rio go for a few minutes while she tried to find a way forward. Her voice was steady as she tried again, as steady as it could be. “Rio, what else is going on? You were on edge even before the scene.” Her chest heaved as she added. “I just… want to help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes looked down as she shook her head. “You’re going to think it’s stupid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved to stand, wincing slightly as she moved to sit a cushion away from Rio, but still close enough that she could close the distance if that was needed. “I won’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grabbed one of the pillows on the couch and pressed it firmly into her stomach. Her face scrunched in frustration. “I started the hormones.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes were steady, if a bit sad. “Okay…I know they can be really intense. I’m sorry.” She moved to tuck Rio’s hair behind her ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sorted. “You didn’t even want me doing them.” She wiped angrily at her eyes. “I couldn’t even figure out how to do the stupid shots, so I just took the pills.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands landed in her own lap as she wished she could reach out and hold Rio. “All the fertility stuff was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. It’s really bad, I do remember. I didn’t… I didn’t want you to go through that. Especially when…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio whimpered and Agatha stopped speaking. “I’m just so </span>
  <em>
    <span>sad</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed. “I know, baby.” She leaned forward and tried to touch Rio’s arm, this time the woman let her. “And I am sorry I had to be extra horrible today on set. Would it help if we did more to prepare, would that make it easier?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged petulantly before she must have realized she was doing too much and nodded. Agatha moved a bit closer. “We can do that, it’s no problem. And…” She hesitated but set her eyes to search for Rio’s brown. “I can help you with the shots tonight, alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “I don’t want to upset you, this is my problem.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her head lean against the couch. “I kind of think you’re my problem now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio wiped at her nose. “How bad do they hurt?” Her eyes not connecting with Agatha’s yet, but clearly wanting to reach out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shrugged. “It’s better if you do them in your stomach then your ass, I also know some tricks and… we can cheat the dose a little. We just need to watch what you are wearing for filming because it will bruise.” She brushed Rio’s hair from her face. “I know this is important to you.” She shifted closer still. Her voice now thick with emotion. “I’m sorry I was so horrible, even if it was as my character today. I want… I want to help you.” She leaned in and kissed Rio’s cheek. “I’ll be better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes scrunched tight. “Uh, I am such a mess. This is stupid.” She remained still as Agatha wiped her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think you are </span>
  <em>
    <span>beautiful</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Rio. And what you are doing… it’s beyond anything anyone has ever done for me before.” She continued to trace her fingers across Rio’s skin when she noticed that the touches were making the muscles beneath them relax. “You can always stop, I won’t be mad.” When Rio shook her head she nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha and the woman held her firmly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It will be okay. When’s your extraction?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio mumbled a reply into Agatha’s shoulder. “Next Friday.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rubbed her hands up and down her back in a move she hoped was soothing. “I’ll make sure I’m not working, I’ll take you. We can… see if Jen or Lilia can take Nicky for the day.” Rio wound her arms tighter around Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I just feel so off.” She pressed her face into Agatha. “How did you do it? Was Tori there in the beginning?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed. “For a few days. Then she, well, she became busy and it was my job to handle the process on my own.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio curled into her, “I feel so sick.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned down and kissed her head. “You can stop whenever you want to, Rio, this is about what you want. It’s your body, baby. We could adopt if you want more children, we could…” She hesitated but then she spoke anyway. “I’ve already done the process before, multiple times, the last one right before my divorce. I’m fairly certain I have more eggs. I could always...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled back at once, her voice hard. “No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes softened. “Rio… if I still have eggs…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No way, you’re not doing that again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled sadly, her body relaxing. “Where were you to tell me I didn’t need to hurt myself for someone to love me?” She shook her head. “I’m glad I have Nicky… I love him so much. But if I never had to go through what I did… I’m not sure I would do it all over again, unless… “ She sighed. “I just want you to be happy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, her finger reaching to play with Agatha’s hair. “I don’t know why I’m like this. I’ve always panicked about what ifs.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gripped Rio’s hand. “Do you feel that way about me and Nicky? That you’re unsure.” Her voice cracked as she tried her hardest to keep her own emotion out of it, and failed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes were deadly serious. “No, Agatha. I know that I want you and Nicky… I just don’t know, what else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes watered. “Okay.” She wiped at her own face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands grabbed Agatha’s and started to play with her fingers. “You were always worth loving, Agatha, some people just suck.”</span>
</p><p>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>COntinued. uh, Kathryn dressed in rio green and in Agnes hair! The weirdness of Dolby theater being in a mall and parking 5 levels underground and getting a migraine. Watching an episode on such a big screan with the dolby surround sound was nuts. Omg the queer and gay energy in that room and on stage was magic. THe room was so narrow but so tall! tried so hard to watch the people and not the big screen . took just a few photos that i'm posting on my socials. Pinkpillow19 on twitter, grainsofexcellence on tumblr, realkelpy IG, maybe some tiktok under realkelpy. If anyone finds a video of my wife crutching through please let me know i know she would die to see it lol. oh the grand starecase in the dolby theater was cool. i took a few photos of the theater itself im posting too. Its where the oscars are at every year so that was wild it didnt look like enough space. Loved that they brought up AUbrey multiple times and gave her props loved that Kathryn was so giving to the other actors always letting them answer first and sharing the spotlight. The way she was petting the chair and her leg was very distracting in the beginning tho lol. Went home after and our friends we were staying with continued watching Agatha for the first time so we got more Agatha after paley! The red carpet inside in a basement was sureal. shoutout to the worker who helped our accomodations with the kick ass colorful "attention" glasses! I'll add more if I think of things :) Thanks for reading my little story and showing it love as well!</p></blockquote>

  <span>CHAPTER 32</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had taken care of Nicky and explained that Rio wasn’t feeling well. As she sent him off to bed, she had Rio shower and get changed into comfortable underwear. Then she took the stairs to meet her in her bedroom with supplies. Rio was laying with her back on the bed, staring up at the ceiling, trying to settle herself. Her fingers tapped lightly on her stomach. “I should learn how to do this myself.” She moved to sit up and Agatha caught her shoulder and pushed her back down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up and relax. I’ve got this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes but kept her mouth shut.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled. “See, you can be quiet when you want to be.” She took a seat and opened some alcohol wipes, cleaning a sizable area, before putting on gloves. Her eyes inspected the syringes and selected the first one, removing the needle cap. She pinched at the area she was about to inject, her eyes connecting with Rio’s as the woman tensed. Knowing this wouldn’t be pleasant. “Relax. Look away. And keep breathing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a deep breath, her eyes focusing on the deep green paint color in the room. Agatha remembered she had once told her it was painted to remind her of the forests she loved to hike as a child. Rio took another breath when Agatha counted her down. “Three, two, one.” Rio hissed lightly as Agatha stabbed her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman smirked. “That was the easy part. Now don’t move. I’m going to do this slowly, because this is what hurts.” Her hand pushed the medicine into Rio’s skin at a glacial pace, the other woman breathing slowly through it. When Agatha was done she removed the needle, recapped the device, then blotted at the puncture until the blood slowed. Agatha moved to crack the ice pack, shaking it gently before applying it to the area. “There, done.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “One out of like twenty.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes rolled. “We’ll do them all. Be patient.” She moved the ice pack slightly to check the wound before placing it back. “How did it feel?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “I can tell it could have been a lot worse.” Her eyes lifted as she went to apologize for earlier in the day. “You really took your time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. “I remember the injections, Tori… she would just shoot me up, it hurt like a bitch,” Agatha’s mind took her back to a time when she was bent at a ninety degree angle, her arms crossed on the sink, her head laying on top. Her eyes pinched shut as she waited for the sting and the searing pain of the injection.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes fluttered as she came back to herself. She tried to shake herself awake. She wasn't back with Tori, she wasn’t the one receiving the injections this time. And she was going to make sure this was easier on Rio. She cleared her throat, trying to wipe the last bits of the flashback from her mind. “It hurts. But… after a while, I realized I didn’t have to do them as quickly as she did.” She again lifted the ice pack to check Rio’s skin. “Hopefully the bruise isn't too bad, we should use the heat pack after and see if we can get ahead of breaking this up.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, her hand reached to place itself on top of Agatha’s. “Agatha, I’m sorry about today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved to lay down beside her, removing her hand. “I know, and it’s okay. I get it. We just… need to watch you for bad thoughts now is all.” She was quiet as she admitted to her memories. “Those almost got me the last time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes watched Agatha, understanding fresh in her gaze. “What kept you here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached a hand out and placed it gently back on the ice pack. “Nicky. I couldn’t leave him with Tori. She wasn’t a good parent and she would have been all he had.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded her understanding, swallowing down her emotions. “I’m glad you’re still here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled, her voice cracked a bit as she replied. “Me too.” She looked up into dark eyes. “I never realized how hard your job was until I was doing it myself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, “I mean, it’s not widely publicized. Need kids to grow up and become performers. It’s all a part of this messed up circus.” She paused as a thought struck her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m… really sorry I brought you into this world.” She let out a breath. “It was selfish.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “It’s better than where I was. And I’m using my degree, so I should be thanking you for that…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “I know better, and I still… brought you here.” She groaned. “You don’t even know how bad it can get yet. The interviews, the fans… I don’t… know how to protect you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned forward and placed her head on Rio’s chest. “We'll figure it out. You’re going to be there with me the whole time. I’ll find my way.” She lifted her head. “You won’t let me get lost in the drugs and women…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “You better not find any other women.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked. “There’s my girl.” She winked, trying to lighten the mood. “I like when you’re jealous.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned into Rio and kissed her lightly. She felt as Rio’s body rippled with exhaustion. “Just a few more days to go. Then we'll have what you want and it’ll be like none of this ever happened.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Agatha came to, she realized she was still in Rio’s room, as she looked for what had woken her up from her deep sleep, she saw Nicky standing before her, glaring. His eyes trained on the bag of needles that still lay on the bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved quickly to get them out of sight. “Nicky… I can explain,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His little body shook with anger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved off the bed, hopeful to calm him down, or at least make an attempt to move him from where Rio was resting before he exploded. But as she got to his side, she realized it was far too late for that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is wrong with you! Do you want to hurt her like mommy hurt you?” He yelled his little lungs out, Agatha not even remembering Rio still lay in the room anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Baby…” her voice was broken. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No!” Nicky shook his head. “Are you going to hit Rio, too? Are you going to throw things at her until something makes her bleed?” He pointed at the medicine angrily. “That stuff is bad! It makes people do bad things! Do you remember how sick you were?” His voice raised in pitch. She tried to grab him but he shrieked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You almost died!” Nicky stood there huffing as he tried to get his mother to wake up and remember.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. Oxygen was becoming harder to find, her voice fading. “Yes, Nicky. I remember.” She worked hard to stamp down the echoes of the hospital machine’s beeping as Nicky had softly cried. Her voice was hesitant. “I remember it all.” She placed her hand over her own chest as she tried not to break down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky glared daggers at her, it hurt her heart in a way she didn’t know it could ever hurt again. The boy looked right through her as if she were responsible for all the pain in his young life, and it wasn’t like he was wrong. Her poor decisions did end up with him suffering too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky looked past his mother, at Rio, who sat on her bed looking guilty, with a welt firmly in place on her stomach. His eyes roamed over the injury with such disgust. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s fingers moved to cover it as Nicky stomped to the bed and broke open another ice pack, shoving Rio’s fingers out of the way before holding it to her stomach himself. His voice didn’t even complain as the cold bit at his fingers. His nose twitched as he tried to control his emotions. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s mouth gasping at the action. “Nicky. It’s not your mom’s fault and it’s not your job to…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He let his eyes cut to hers. “Of course it is her fault. She’s just as bad as mommy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s breathing stopped. She tried to move and found that on her third attempt, she could. She moved to the bed and went to take over from Nicky when he shoved her away. Her hands came to press at her abdomen where he had pushed her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grabbed Nicky’s hands. “Honey, Stop. No, Nicky.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was breathing hard as he stared Agatha down. The woman tried not to respond, not to let her child see her falter, not again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a moment to try and even out her voice. “Nicky… I can’t tell Rio what to do. She’s an adult, and it’s her body…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky screamed. “Like mom couldn’t tell you what to do? Only she did, and you always did what she said. Didn’t you? Even when she was horrible to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha crossed her arms. “Nicky, this is not the way to discuss your feelings about any of this…” She hated him seeing her as the bad guy, as his enemy. It had been just them for so long, but Rio didn’t deserve his ire for this, not when it was perfectly reasonable for herself to want to preserve her options.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried again. “Rio, might want a baby one day….”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s voice was quiet as it became laced with tears. “Then stop her. Before she gets hurt.” He rubbed his eyes. “You hurt her, didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grabbed Nicky’s arm. Her voice was thick. “No.” She tried to explain. “No…your mother didn’t. I… I just…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky shook her off. “Why aren't we good enough for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked at the bag of needles across the room. “You… are enough, Nicky.” Her eyes strained. “I just… wanted to make sure that if your mom wanted a baby one day, and if you wanted a sibling, that I could… I would </span>
  <b>
    <em>want </em>
  </b>
  <span>to be able to give that to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s fingers wove into the sheets. “I know it doesn’t make sense… but I’m getting older, Nicky, and women… can’t have babies forever… our… eggs, go away. I just wanted to make sure I saved a few. Just in case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s arms loosened on himself slightly. “You’re not making a baby?” His voice turned hopeful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “No, not right now.” She indicated his mother. “Your mom was helping me so it </span>
  <em>
    <span>wouldn’t </span>
  </em>
  <span>hurt me like it did her. And she is </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> your other mother, Nicky. She didn’t want me doing this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He chewed at his lip as he took in her words. Rio continued on. “Agatha is kind, Nicky. She’s a beautiful person, and I just want her to have everything she didn’t before. I know I’m not great at knowing what she needs, or what you need yet, but I want to learn.” Her voice trailed off. “And I never want to hurt you, either of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heaved in a breath. “I started a new medication and was not very nice to your Mom today, and yet, she still wanted to help me.” Rio shrugged. “I was having a bad day. It wasn’t her fault.” She tried to keep her tears from falling. “Please, don’t yell at her because of me. She didn’t do anything wrong.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s little hands shook. “I just found you, Rio. I don’t want to lose you.” He rubbed his face on his sleeve.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “You won’t lose me, buddy. You and your mom are taking great care of me. I’m alright.” She leaned on her arm looking down at her stomach. “Would you like to help me, too? That way you can see nothing bad is going to happen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s eyes appeared from behind his arm. Rio patted the bed and Nicky moved to sit beside her, her arm coming around him. “What if… we explain everything that’s happening. You’re a big kid, and very smart, I know you can understand.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded. “I’m almost seven,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, “Yeah, that’s a big age.” She pointed at the needles. “Those are a medication that is supposed to help get the eggs to come out. So that maybe, one day, they could make a baby. Because if I don't take them out, all my eggs will just disappear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky sighed. “You don’t want to be a mom.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “Yeah, I don’t. But I get scared sometimes that I might change my mind. So, I just wanted to save a few eggs. Do you think that would be okay?” Dark eyes watched as Nicky thought about things. “If this really upsets you, I will stop.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky looked at Rio’s stomach again. “Momma’s not going to hurt you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “No. She’s not. Not like your other mom hurt her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The kid’s shoulders deflated. Little brown eyes looked at Agatha as she stood frozen. Seeming like she very much wanted to rip out her own heart. “Momma?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes met her son’s. “I promise I won’t hurt her, Nicky. I really… care about her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky extended his hand for Agatha and she quickly moved to take the offering before her child could take it away again. Nicky looked to the space next to him and at Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat carefully as if she wasn’t sure she was really allowed to be there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky sighed. “I’m sorry, Momma. You’re… not mommy. I know that.” He looked up, seeming disappointed in himself. “I just got scared.” He moved to hug her and Agatha wrapped her arms around him tight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, baby. You shouldn’t have found out this way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand lifted to Agatha’s back, holding her lightly. Nicky looked between them. His face, thoughtful. “Is… Rio going to be my new mom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth dropped open and Rio smiled. “Let’s not give your mom a heart attack, kid. Let’s leave </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>talk for another day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha held on to Nicky, worried he would never willingly enter her arms again, when the kid cuddled into her. “I just feel like we would make a good family.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tapped at his arm. “Hey, we are a family. Even if we are different than all the others you see, there’s no right way to be a family.” He nodded, nuzzling into his momma.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes looked into Rio’s over her son. Though she couldn’t tell her yet, this was everything she had always wanted. </span>

  <span>CHAPTER 33 </span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes were a bit bloodshot from her lack of sleep. She had been up all night worrying about Rio’s procedure. The woman waved her off that it was just minor surgery and that she would be just fine, and for Agatha to stop panicking because </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> was freaking her out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had been so tightly wound that Nicky had to drag her away from the waiting room. He held her hand as they wandered over to a window with bushes. “Should we get Rio flowers?” Nicky’s brown eyes took in the colors outside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand gripped his back, trying not to think of her lover coding in surgery. She knew it wasn’t likely but accidents did happen. She ran her hand through Nicky’s hair. “That’s a good idea.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky moved to grab Rio’s phone, unlocking it and texting Billy, Agatha’s eyes narrowing. “You know Rio’s password?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s eyes widened in alarm. “Uh, maybe?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned in, her arms crossing. “Did you watch her open it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He nodded. “Yeah. Billy got your flowers. I figured he could help us. Since we have to wait here for Rio and all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifted her weight into her left hip. She opened her phone and checked her bank account before locking the device. “I have some money left, we could pay him back…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky brightened. “What kind of flowers?” His little eyes staring at the screen as he typed away. He bounced up and down as he got a reply. “Billy is free! He said he can head to the florist now, what did we want?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened her phone and searched for </span>
  <em>
    <span>strange flowers</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Rio did have a unique taste. Her eyes crinkled as they landed on a flower. “What about these, Nicky, it says they attract butterflies.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His brown eyes studied the image, Agatha for the first time noticed how he and Rio had the exact same eye color. If she didn’t know, she would have assumed that her son had Rio’s DNA and not hers. She wondered what the odds of that were before she came back to herself, waiting on his response on the suggested flowers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded. “I like them. I think Rio will too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mind drifted to her favorite flower and she tapped Nicky’s shoulder. “Have him add black roses.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was pacing the waiting room when Billy arrived, her eyes landing on the young man who still looked like a teenager, as if he had just walked out of a Hot Topic with his mom. She smiled and held up her phone. “How much do I owe you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy waved her off, “Please, you’re keeping my boss busy </span>
  <em>
    <span>and </span>
  </em>
  <span>happy. That’s enough for me…” He scratched at the back of his neck. “Eddie says thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyebrow lifted. “Who’s Eddie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy blushed. “My boyfriend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She nodded. “Well, I’m glad you two are able to enjoy more time together, but I would really like to pay you for these. I would like to give them to her, just from me, if that’s okay?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy rolled his eyes. “They were like eighty something. Keep the change out of it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted, shaking her head good naturedly. “I’ll get it out of you eventually.” She typed out eighty in the cash app and hit send. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy narrowed his eyes. “Would like to see you try.” His gaze landed on Nicky and he waved. “Hello.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky waved back. “Thank you for helping us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy saluted him. “Anytime, Rio’s kinda the best. I had no idea she was having a procedure done. I hope she’s okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pursed her lips and shrugged. “It’s nothing serious, it’s for vanity.” An instant later wanting to facepalm as she made it sound like Rio was either having her nose done or a boob job.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy scoffed, his hand coming to his chest scandalized. “Wow, I had no idea that she… well, she looked great before, I’m sure whatever she decided on will be good too.” He waved awkwardly as he departed. “You two give her all of my best and let me know if you need anything else!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha held the vase of flowers awkwardly and Nicky leaned over to smell them. “I love roses,” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His mother smiled softly. “I love them too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes were drifting as she came in and out. She groaned and Agatha’s chest physically hurt. She had flagged down the nurse more than once to try and get them to give her something when they assured her that if she woke up telling them things hurt, then they would deal with it. Agatha didn’t like their lack of preparation and it was up to Nicky to keep her calm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand rubbed at her stomach, the small incision clearly noticed even as her mind hadn’t caught back up yet. Her eyes staring longingly at Agatha. “You’re here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat at her hip, and cleared her fallen hair from her face as the woman tried to pull her closer. “Dear… you need to not pull on your incision. I’m not going anywhere.” She eased Rio back down and noticed her pout.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> “I want you to hold me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “We can discuss that once we get home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky leaned onto the bed. “Hey, Rio!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman smiled lazily. “Hey, Nicks.” She looked up and stared at the flowers. Nicky turning and pointing. “We got you flowers! Billy helped. Me and Mom choose which ones.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes softened before they scrunched, her hand coming to cover her mouth as she suppressed her laughter. Wincing a moment later at the pull she must have felt in her abdomen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s face scrunched as he looked to his mom to explain what was happening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised her arms, shrugging. “I think she’s still drugged.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “No… Well, yes, but that’s not why I’m laughing.” She pointed lazily at the flowers. “Those are the ones I wanted to get for you, too.” She snickered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took them in thoughtfully. “Black roses are my favorite, I’ve always found them striking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. Her mind still reeling with her own knowledge, information that, without a filter, she decided to share. “They mean death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes shot to her. “Come again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up innocently at her as she nodded. “Yep, Billy told me when I tried to order them for you.” Her head tilted towards the other flowers as well. “Well, that’s not good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha face-palmed. “What isn't? These attract butterflies. What do you have against butterflies?” She was flushing with embarrassment over her choices. Of course Rio would have a special interest in flowers, it was just her luck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio closed her mouth. “Oh. Okay, I won’t say anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky tapped on her arm without the IV. “Rio, I wanna know. What do they mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes looked at Agatha. “I’m not mad. Can I tell him what it means? It’s just flower meanings anyway. It’s all made up…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her face fall into her hand as she swept the other forward as if to tell her </span>
  <em>
    <span>fine go ahead, embarrass her and ruin her son’s innocence</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio whispered loudly. “Those mean </span>
  <em>
    <span>let me go</span>
  </em>
  <span>. But if you meant </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>I don’t think you would be here, so I think this is </span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span> some type of misunderstanding.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed. “Great.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. She giggled into her pillow, her eyes fixating on the flowers. “I like them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky smiled and Agatha snorted. “You would, you freak.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes widened, looked at Nicky, then back at Agatha, misunderstanding her use of the term. “We can’t talk about the couch stuff in front of him!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha blanched. “What? No, I didn’t mean….Uh. Nicky, close your ears.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky tilted his head. “I can’t actually close my ears, Mom.” When he received a glare, he covered them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned close to Rio’s face. “No couch gymnastics until you’re better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “But after?”</span>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <span>Agatha shrugged. “We can talk about it.”</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 34</span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha kept watch over Rio in her room. There was no way she was taking Rio up to hers with the way she hissed every time her abdomen stretched, pulling on her new incision.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had tried to keep busy tidying up the space, but in the end she had done little since Nicky went to bed, aside from sit and keep watch over Rio. The woman in question had been relatively peaceful since arriving home. Only occasionally groaning and asking for more pain meds. Agatha kept a sharp eye on the clock and the pills were kept in the kitchen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pushed fluids every time Rio was awake and it was just about time to wake her up to go to the bathroom. Her eyes watching the shadows in the room, as if something was about to walk out of them and show her something to really be scared of. Like taking Rio away. Her mind was starting to wander to waking nightmares with such little sleep, but the moment she heard Rio waking up, her fears shattered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved closer from her position in the chair. “Honey, I’m here. What did you need?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes found her without much of an issue. The woman in bed sighed, taking in Agatha sitting before her. “Why don’t you sleep in my room?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes scrunched in confusion. “Because I have my own room.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyebrows furrowed. “That was a dumb idea on my part.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “It’s fine.” She moved to brush her hand through Rio’s hair, the woman leaning into the touch. “If we shared a room, you would miss out on all the fun of sneaking into my room at night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand. “My room is right upstairs… you could just as easily…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned against some pillows. “Nicky is down here, what if he gets scared?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a moment to contemplate Agatha’s concerns before speaking, clearly becoming more self aware and less medicated. “I have no problem with him slipping into my bed…we’ve… already all slept in yours.” Rio's teeth dug into her lip. “Were you not alright with that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cupped Rio’s face gently, letting her thumb move back and forth across Rio’s cheek. “It made me happy that Nicky felt comfortable enough to climb into bed with you there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, relaxing again. “Then let me move in here with you.” Her eyes were pleading. “Though, just remember, I have a bigger bathroom…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her eyes fall to the mattress. “My bathroom is already set up…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes. “I can make room. And we can go slow. This room and your precious bathroom aren't going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes scanned the desk. “I like drawing in here, that spot has really good lighting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to scoot closer to Agatha and hissed, her hand went to her stomach but not before Agatha found it first. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio, be careful.” Her voice was firm and the dark haired woman rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s a small incision, it’s not going to kill me if I rip it open.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha glared. “No twisting and let’s not test that theory.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her head fall back dramatically before she rolled her head to the side. “Move in with me, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted, her eyes lifting. “I already live with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “Keep this room as your office. Just… sleep in mine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha blew out a breath. “You can’t even get up to your room right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “For a couple days.” She worried her lip. “Would you let me stay in here with you? If you decided you really didn’t want to stay in my room?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes looked about the room. “I think… we could figure that out.” She laid back on the pillow, her face looking up at the ceiling. “This is starting to feel awfully domestic.” She swallowed back down the bile that threatened to come up her throat. “What if I’m not ready for… all of that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached for her hand but let her eyes also stray to the ceiling. “We try one night at a time. If you need your space… you take it. I won’t be mad.” She sighed. “I miss you when you’re not in bed with me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned on her side, facing Rio, her eyes taking her in. Things with Rio just seemed </span>
  <em>
    <span>easy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She wondered why that was. It was like Rio seemed in tune with her, every little touch or reassurance came right when she needed it. Agatha couldn’t understand why Rio even wanted to make the effort, why she chose to love </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> when there were so many other women on the planet. Her mind wandered and she didn’t exactly mean to blurt out her question, but once it was out she found that she did really want to hear Rio’s answer. “Why did you want me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned her face to Agatha, glaring at her. “Are you trying to get information out of me because I’m high?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged, a smile tugging at her lips. “Maybe?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. “Well,” Her face shifted into a look of concentration. “I was working on that Thirst Post interview and I was reading a lot of… questionable comments,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cringed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lifted her arm to hold out her hand for Agatha's as it had slipped away; the woman took it in record time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I got to yours and… your photo.” She whistled. “Damn, honey, your eyes, your face… your nose, your lips, your… hands.” She sighed then giggled like a little girl. “Then the thing you said about the couch?” She groaned lightly. “It was just everything. You were beautiful, sexy… and already into me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Agatha could form words, Rio continued. “I went to your page right away and started to flip through your photos. I hadn’t seen your art account, and you hadn’t posted in a long time, but your photos, the pictures of you laughing and smiling… I felt like there was just this warmth to you that was infectious. I knew I would be missing you forever if I didn’t shoot my shot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit her lip. “And what did you think when we… met?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked, a bit mischievous. “You were </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>nervous.” She played with Agatha’s fingers as her mind traveled backwards in time. “I honestly thought you were going to faint.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed, feeling her chest flush. “I was.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “Yeah, I barely got the ice in time. Could have used it as an excuse for a daring rescue though, now that I think about it. But I gotta say, you did handle it pretty well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes took in Rio’s face and how happy she was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The way you talked about Nicky, that really hit me. The way you… took something that hurt you so badly like your time with Tori, and made it beautiful instead with the family you have with Nicky, that made my heart want you more. You’re a survivor, Agatha. You’re so strong.” She laughed quietly. “Plus, the sounds you make when you get wet are </span>
  <em>
    <span>unholy</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed and smacked Rio on the shoulder, her body vibrating from the love Rio poured over her so easily and how she soothed the discomfort of too many sentimental feelings with her humor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed. “Fine. I’ll… share a bed with you. For now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “Is it because you don’t want to trek up to my room tonight, nor sleep on the couch?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha deadpanned. "Yes, because you obviously have nothing to do with it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio beamed. “Of course, we can’t have that.” She let her fingers drift to Agatha’s pulse. Agatha swallowed thickly as Rio closed her eyes and focused on her heart beating.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I love this feeling. It reminds me that you’re real and that you’re actually here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed her eyes. “I am here. For…” She felt her heart speed up as she ventured to make a confession. “For as long as you want me to be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “And if I want you forever?”</span>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <span>Agatha felt like she might faint or throw up, it was a very good thing she was already laying down. “Then I guess I’m stuck with you forever.”</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 35: Sharon Davis </span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sharon Davis hadn’t done much since Mr. Davis died. She had retreated from her role as an executive at Monument. While many men in her position simply postured and got blowjobs all day long, Sharon had always been passionate about what they created. Stories that touched people on a deeper level. Stories that not only inspired others, but made some realize they did have a heart. It was how she had met Mr. Davis in the first place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had been such a grouchy middle aged man. While Sharon had been a rising star in the industry due to her own parents’ connections. She had crossed paths with him multiple times before they were trapped at a horribly dull work event together. Sharon had been sitting next to him when she decided he wasn’t worth her concern, and she had started to write her latest script idea on a napkin, Mr. Davis’s eyes wandered over to peek at her notes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His eyes had widened as he read on, shocked that Sharon was a gifted storyteller, and not just another suit spinning corporate jargon. He had made her jump when he leaned in further to continue to read when she had adjusted her napkin further away. Both nearly having a heart attack as their eyes connected. They had both burst out laughing, and when someone across the table had too much to drink and knocked over their water, Mr. Davis snatched up Sharon’s script to save it. Sharon was head over heels ever since.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mr. Davis was also the first person she had told that she was bisexual. In a time when being gay meant you had a disease of the mind, he quietly confessed he was as well. The couple had an instant connection over their love of stories as well as their queerness. They soon teamed up as angel investors for queer productions all over Hollywood. Hopeful that one day something would make it to Monument’s doorsteps and they could push it through. Sadly, Mr. Davis hadn’t lived to see the day.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They had a wonderful forty years together. Mr. Davis one rainy day had a stroke on his way home from work, and that had been the end of it. Luckily, he had written a letter to be given to Sharon should anything happen to him and his thoughtful words were one of the only reasons she didn’t completely fall apart. He encouraged her to continue to push for their dreams. That something she wrote needed to be seen by the world. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This had sent her ripping through her greatest works like a person consumed by madness. She went through all of her husband's notes on her manuscripts until she found the perfect one. A show about queer witches. Ex-wives. Something that even the straight audience could understand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Over the years their paychecks and investments had amounted to a sum that Sharon could do just about anything she wanted. But going out on such a limb with the hard earned money the two had set aside had her pushing the studio to finance the project with a measly budget. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She figured, should it become what she wanted, she would dump a good deal of her riches into the marketing. First, she just needed to make sure she struck gold. As she ripped through editing, she tried to envision who could bring her main character to life. She needed someone unexpected, known, with a strong occult following, but not so big that she couldn’t reach them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She spent the next six months pouring over tv shows and movies, driving herself insane trying to see each and every actress as her star. None were right – until she saw Rio Vidal’s work. She had seen her before but had forgotten about her. The last time she had seen her work was ten years ago, some small support role in a school drama. She watched as Rio’s acting had matured, how she had the depth now that Sharon was looking for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sharon read the script, hearing it in Rio’s voice loud and clear, also seeing places where she should adjust the wordings to really capture Rio’s quirkiness. She could be funny, she could be dramatic. She could make you cry and want to rip your heart out with just a look. That, was her star.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had found Lilia quickly enough. At first when she reached out and she had played it coy, knowing the woman must be shitting herself to be hearing from her. Then as she felt the energy building at Monument, her team agreeing to give Sharon her little show with some unknown writer and producer, she went in for the kill.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia had been ecstatic, ready to bend over backwards for Sharon, not that the woman minded that image, Lilia had certainly been her type at one point in her life. She had met with her one Friday afternoon to discuss the logistics of the show, and her own secret involvement. Lilia, as a queer woman herself, was overjoyed with her little plot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sharon hadn’t expected Rio to ask for anything. But in the end, she was so glad she did because it had landed Agatha Harkness in her inbox. The woman’s acting was as natural as breathing, and a complete unknown would mean they could meet their budget easily. Her offers weren’t the best of the best, but she knew Rio’s offer was in line with around what the woman was making nowadays, well, almost. And she made Agatha a similar offer. Her mind was not sitting in the details of how she felt that all made sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had been checking emails about how everything was shaping up on set when she saw an unusual email from Lilia Calderu appear in her inbox.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>“Request from Agatha Harkness”</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pursed her lips. It was a bit late in the game for the unknown actor to be making requests at all. She opened the email to find a quick forward by Lilia before she opened a letter from Agatha herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>To Our Fabulous Writer Producer and Team,</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hi, my name is Agatha Harkness. I know you must know me from my audition tapes, and first of all thank you so much for seeing this witch in me. I am truly grateful and this role is about to change my life. I find this role to be incredibly fulfilling as an actor, she is quite the challenge, as well as at times, I feel I am on a healing journey of my own through her eyes. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What I wanted to ask is if there were any way we could do table reads for a few of the episodes we have left, in particular for the major ex-wives scenes. I have found that at times I have not been able to give everything I want to give to the scene for fear of the mental health of my fellow scene partners. I know it is our job to adjust our emotions to be believable on screen, but this at times can leave a toll on us performers when it is not properly prepared for. And in corporate terms, this affects the budget in delays. If we are able to do our homework together, for lack of a better term, I know we can finish with making this the groundbreaking piece it was meant to be. I myself as a queer woman have cried many times reading over the script and finally seeing myself so clearly in something. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m not requesting that we do table reads for every episode or scene going forward, or that the table reads would need to be in person, but even just a remote workshop of the bigger scenes would be much appreciated. Again, I love the two main characters with my whole heart and I hope I am bringing justice to your vision.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>With the utmost respect,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha Harkness</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sharon sat back in her chair with a smile. She hadn’t thought about any of this from the point of view of the performers before. She had never been this close to something she had written, usually passing it off as an unknown writer and handing it to a trusted producer. She had a co-producer for this project that sat on site and reported back, but this letter from one of her actors was eye opening. She figured there was space in the timeline to work in a few remote table reads, she could approve that. They were halfway through filming and she really wanted to amp up the piece because if all went well, she was totally submitting this for award season.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wrote some notes, and made some calls. Agatha Harkness was getting those table reads.</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 36 </span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha sat in Lilia’s backyard, on an outdoor couch in her gazebo, while Nicky, Benny, and Ruffland ran around like crazy. Lilia and Rio were in the kitchen making lunch and had shooed her away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia had wanted to have a lunch meeting with the two, and Agatha had a sinking feeling it had to do with the request she had made. She tried to ignore her skin prickling as she thought about the words she had typed up, knowing that this would either go very well or not at all. She tried to refocus her attention on something else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched everyone play and found that she couldn’t help but smile. Nicky’s happy yells as he raced around the yard brought a lightness to her chest that she needed in the moment. Her eyes scanned the yard and she realized she hadn’t seen Rio’s dog for a few moments, her smile into a look of concern. When she looked down, she almost jumped as Ruffland lay quietly at her feet. When had he gotten there? Her eyes looked around, unsettled. She didn’t have a good track record with dogs. She had been respectful of Rio’s baby but hadn’t wanted to force anything. The dog seemed to understand that she was nervous and stayed clear of her most of the time. On the rare occasion that she needed to let the dog in or out or feed him, she did so without complaint, and Ruffland was fairly well behaved, but they didn’t really interact much.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had always loved animals, but the fact that a dog had not only bitten her as a kid, but also eaten her pet rabbit, kind of had her scarred for life. Her blue eyes watched Ruff as he watched her. She slowly tried to raise her legs up onto the couch, hopeful to put a few more inches between them, when the thing stood and placed his front paws on her leg. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let out a yelp of panic, fear flooding her body at the potential of another attack. When Ruff laid his head in her lap, her heart just about leapt from her chest. Her son’s feet came thundering her way. “Ruff! No.” Agatha closed her eyes and tried not to pass out. How embarrassing would it be to faint in front of her agent? All because of a dog she currently lived with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice cut through her mind. “Nicky, I got it.” The woman rushed over as Nicky stood by with his lip between his teeth. Rio’s hand came to rest on his shoulders. “Remember how I told you Ruff does work for me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded, brown eyes not leaving Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rubbed at his back. “He’s working for your mom right now. I’ll go make sure she’s okay. You and Benny keep playing.” The little boy did look up then, unsure if he should put the fun down and go take care of his mom, but as he looked back at Rio, he let his shoulders sag, he nodded, showing he trusted Rio with his mom, and stooped over to pick up a ball for Benny. Tentatively going back to play fetch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved purposely over to her lover and dog. “Hey, you alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes closed tight. “I didn’t think he liked me.” She tried to laugh, her voice was quiet to not startle the dog on her lap. Rio nodded, taking a seat beside Agatha. She moved Agatha’s hand to Ruff’s fur, helping her pet him. “He’s tasking for you.” Her voice was incredulous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened her eyes slowly, her voice still a whisper. She wasn’t sure why Ruff had suddenly decided to take care of her as well. Surely she had done nothing to warrant this sort of attention from him. She rarely even played fetch with him that was left up to Rio and Nicky. “I thought he was trained to task for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head in surprise. “He is… he must have bonded to you as well.” Her eyes connected with Agatha’s softly. “He seems to think you’re experiencing a panic attack.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled softly. Her mind tried to remember what she had been worried about before Rio’s dog had shut down all other thoughts with his alert. Landing on the letter when she remembered where she was. Her heart tried to speed up again at the reminder. “He… would be right.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand came up and wrapped her arm around Agatha’s shoulders. “What’s wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged, trying to breathe. She wondered if it would be less painful to just pass out and start fresh. “I asked Lilia for something, and it might have been stupid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned over and kissed Agatha on the cheek, causing Agatha to relax into her a bit. “We all ask Lilia for insane things. She wanted to murder me when I requested the audition for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand found its own rhythm petting Rio’s dog. She did find his soft fur soothing, when he wasn’t scaring the shit out of her. “Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “We had a pretty good relationship, but the look she gave me made me wonder if she was going to drop me as a client. She didn’t, though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned back into Rio’s hold. Forgoing her fears of public displays of affection, she needed this. “I just…thought something could be done better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cringed. “Woah, that’s a big swing. Maybe Lilia </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>going to kill you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Thanks for being so supportive.” Her eyes fluttered shut.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grabbed Agatha’s face and held her steady, coaxing her eyes to open and focus on her lover. “No matter what happens, I’ve got you. Even if you made us lose our jobs.” Rio’s head nodded resolutely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “I don’t think it went that far…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged, biting her lip. “These executive types can be… quite sensitive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gulped as Lilia set some plates down as she arrived. She held her breath as she waited for the news. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Luckily for both of you, I have a little finesse with the presentation, and Agatha here wrote a </span>
  <em>
    <span>very </span>
  </em>
  <span>heartfelt letter.” Lilia smiled warmly at the woman and Agatha flushed red.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I just want the project to be successful,” Agatha mumbled as she tried to disappear into her seat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia’s gaze was thoughtful. “You did more than that, dear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio eyed both of them before she grew frustrated. “Is someone going to tell me what is going on?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia grabbed a printed paper. “Here’s Agatha’s letter.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The older woman gasped. “Lilia! Rio, don’t read that, it's stupid.” She reached for the paper, but Rio held her back with a hand as she read. Her dark eyes scanned the page quickly. At first she didn’t move but as she finished reading she took a deep breath. Her eyes lifted to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You wrote this… because of me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes were trapped in Rio’s gaze as she uncomfortably admitted to it. “Yeah. Yeah, I… did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia cleared her throat, waiting for both eyes to land on her before speaking. “Your request was granted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyebrows raised. “We’re getting the readings?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia nodded, plopping a raspberry in her mouth. “Yes. Starting tomorrow, for every major scene.” Her eyes took in Agatha. “I underestimated you.” She looked at the brunette, apologetically. “Sharon also wants me to discuss a slight raise in your contract, should this go well. We should speak on that later. In private.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked confused but didn’t push. Seeming to know it wasn’t her place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “You can tell me in front of Rio. I’m sure she makes a heck of a lot more than me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia sighed. “Unfortunately, for someone like Rio, this industry isn’t always… fair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes faded as she understood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gripped her hand. “What does she mean?” Her eyes trying to find Rio’s as the woman before her deflated. Her eyes cast out to the hills. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What Lilia means… is I am not, making a lot more than you.” Her gaze drifted back ashamed. “How much more is Agatha making?” her voice was no longer steady.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth dropped open, not in shock, but in anger. “Rio, there’s no way I’m making more as an unknown…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia raised her hand to stop her. “Rio is making more… but not by much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s form retreated. Agatha’s body missed the warmth, luckily the dog was still on her lap. “Why would they do that? Rio’s been building her career over a decade. I’m just in one show, my first show. How is that even possible?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia shrugged. “Rio is a woman of color, technically. She’s Scottish and Puerto Rican. This happens with a lot of my non-white clients, Agatha. They’ll offer you more because you’re white. Also, if Rio taking this role was contingent on your involvement, they had to have you. Rio is… exotic looking, but you, you are what the industry would consider a “classic beauty” easily marketed. It’s a miracle Rio was cast as the lead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia sighed. “Rio is a brilliant actor, but that doesn’t always matter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s stomach dropped. “Well, that’s not right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia shrugged, “Nothing ever is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio had been quiet on the drive home, Nicky and Ruff passing out the moment they got in the car then again after they had both dragged themselves in the house. Agatha waited anxiously for Rio to speak to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes avoided her. “Agatha, this isn’t about you, please don’t make it something it’s not. I’m not mad. I’m frustrated by the situation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha wrung her hands. “Just tell me how to make it right. How do I fix this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, finally looking at her. “You can’t. I just was dealt the cards I was and that’s the end of it. I still make a good living. I can afford a house, healthcare, and investments. I just… can’t pay people to take me more seriously.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha grabbed her arm. “This… this show is going to make an impact. People will be looking at you for their next projects…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled sadly. “They’ll be looking at you, too. She raised her hands to map it out in the air. “Agatha Harkness, breakout star.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrunk under the backhanded compliment, and Rio dropped her hands. “Ignore me, I’m being an ass.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “You’re really not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. She moved forward and wrapped Agatha in her arms. “It means a lot to me that you would want to make things right.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gripped her back harder. “I’ll give you whatever amount you think is fair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “Just use it to buy the kids a bigger yard when the time is right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned back, her head tilted in question. Rio rolled her eyes. “I mean ya know, if we stay together and want to look for something bigger.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth parted slightly. “Are you talking about if we… get married or…” She must be misunderstanding. Rio had never once mentioned a desire to get married, but once the question was out of Agatha’s mouth, Rio’s eyes searched her pale face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah… I was.” Her eyes blinked in shock that Agatha made the leap. She took Agatha’s hand. “Did you… not want to get married again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth dropped. “I…I don’t think I’m ready.” She cringed. That was the response she was going with? Hadn’t she been worried about how temporary everything could be? If they were married it would be a little harder for Rio to just walk away. Why was she self sabotaging at a time like this?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. “Well, I wasn’t asking you this moment.” She shook her head, a smile returning. “But… is that something that might be possible?” Her eyes were hopeful and that feeling, of being wanted more permanently, made Agatha uncomfortable. Because what if things went wrong?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She crossed her arms. “I’m really not sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded her understanding. “We wouldn’t have to, you know? But I would like some claim on you, before we go off to our next projects and some other woman decides to shoot her shot with you between takes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed. “Like anyone would even be interested.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile fell. “You really don’t know how beautiful you are, do you?” She felt brown eyes dark to her lips before taking in the rest of her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s skin crawled, she hadn’t ever been one to receive compliments well. They had been so rare in her life that when she did get them, she didn’t believe them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “Evanora did a number on you.” She reached up and ran her hand through dark chocolate hair. “I love your hair, I think it’s the perfect color.” Rio bit her cheek. “And your eyes, it’s rare to see that color blue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes fell to the ground. “Oh, come on, there are about a hundred girls within a mile of here that are far superior to me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “Not one of them is as beautiful as you. Inside or out.” She leaned forward and kissed Agatha sweetly, not escalating things at all. She patted her on the cheek. “I’m locking this down. If we can’t get married, how about tattoos?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged a small smile gracing her face. “Aren't tattoos cursed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. “Only if I get your name. I’ve got a few ideas that shouldn’t condemn us.”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER 37 - COMING OUT</h1><p>Agatha had made a cup of coffee and settled into the couch to review her next script. She donned her glasses before taking a sip of her drink as she waited for Rio to join her, which took all of only a few minutes before the raven-haired woman came bounding in. Leaning in to take a sip of Agatha’s coffee before Agatha snorted.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you want me to make you one?” The brunette raised an eyebrow at her partner in challenge. </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowned. “Is it not okay if I share?” She licked her lips as she set the cup down and tried to make her excuses. “I just really like how you make yours… and I don’t think I want a full cup but, if that would be easier, I can go make…” Her voice trailed off as Agatha picked up the mug and pressed it back into Rio’s hands. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s fine.” She watched Rio blush as she took a sip before handing it to Agatha for her to take a turn. Blue eyes rolled. She hadn’t shared a lot in her life, but she found that she didn’t mind sharing now, as long as the person she was sharing with – was Rio.  “For the record,” She kept her voice quiet. “I don’t mind sharing with you.” She felt her skin warm at the admission. Seeing Rio’s bright smile as her lover got comfortable on the couch eased her embarrassment, the awkwardness dissipated.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio had been quietly reading their scripts for a while, both marking up the pages and working out different inflection options, slightly altering the end feeling of their performance.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tapped Agatha and showed her her notes, Agatha hummed, considering the options before she circled one. She was becoming more confident in making decisions regarding her work, and it helped her confidence grow that Rio seemed to not only want her opinion, but value it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled at her suggestion and nodded her agreement as she continued working silently. Agatha’s eyes couldn’t help straying to the woman beside her, the one who chewed on the end of her pen as she tilted her head at the paper, lost in thought. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was once again hit with a deep feeling in her chest when she looked at this woman. She wondered if she would always find Rio this adorable. She tried to shake herself awake from those thoughts and decided she needed to get herself to focus back on her work before her mind took a turn for the worse. </p><p> </p><p>As they continued to brainstorm, Nicky arrived in the living room, standing before them. Both sets of eyes lifting up at the same time. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Momma, can I talk to you?” Nicky tucked a fallen piece of his long brunette hair behind his ear as he held his mother’s gaze. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took her glasses off and set them and the script down on the coffee table. Feeling a bit confused as her son seemed on edge. She hated it when her baby was stressed and moved to try and ease the tension. “Of course, Nicky, what’s going on?” She made sure her focus was only on her kid. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky’s eyes went to Rio, and the woman took a moment before her eyes widened in understanding. “Oh.” Agatha cast a side-eyed glance at the woman, wondering what all <em> that </em>was about. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky nodded at Rio. “Is now a good time?” The kid indicated with a raise of their eyebrows that it was indeed a conversation Rio knew something about. </p><p> </p><p>The dark-haired woman turned to Agatha, placing her hand on her thigh, running her thumb back and forth slowly before turning slightly to address her. “Agatha, Nicky has something really big to discuss with you. I want you to just… take it in. You don’t need to respond right away. I know you might need some time…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked between them in alarm. Rio’s fingers took in the slight tremor coursing through her body. “What is going on?” Her words came out measured, though internally, she wasn’t calm at all. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky rocked on his feet. His hair was finally getting longer, and he had started to pull it back in ponytails again. He cleared his little throat and took a deep breath before he spoke. “Momma. I like my hair long.” He eased in gently. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face furrowed. This wasn’t a secret; she remembered the tantrums every time there was a haircut. “I know, sweetheart, I like it long too.” She offered up a smile, letting her son know that she really did agree with him. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky smiled. “It’s dark, like you and Rio’s. I hope it gets darker. I would really like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her gaze. “Well, I think it’s a bit early to start dying your hair; you're only six.” Making a guess about what this conversation might really be about. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky rolled his eyes, shaking his head. “I’m almost seven.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. “That’s right, <em> only </em>seven.” She raised a brow at her child, indicating that she was not going to be easily swayed on the subject. Nicky had the rest of his life to dye his hair and put chemicals into his scalp, he didn’t need to start this young, in her opinion. And given his age, her rules still mattered. </p><p> </p><p>Rio placed her hand on Agatha’s back, and her pulse jumped. <em> What could they have to tell her that was such a big deal? Was this not about Nicky’s hair at all? </em></p><p> </p><p>Nicky tried again. “So my favorite color is purple like yours, Momma. Purple and… pink.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded; she had noticed those colors were Nicky’s preferences, that hadn’t escaped her. She had always paid close attention to what had brought Nicky joy. She was always trying to make a smile appear on her child’s little face. She hadn’t been able to make Nicky’s life perfect, but she had been able to infuse a lot of joy in his young upbringing. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky scratched his arm. “I wanna be a mom one day when I grow up. Just like you.” The child waited for Agatha to have some sort of reaction. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha inclined her head. “I am sure you will be a great parent, sweetheart. You’re very loving and kind. I am sure that if that’s what you really want, then you will make it happen. I hope you find a partner that wants the same things in life…” She noticed that her child’s brows furrowed, her pulse rising once again. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky blew out a breath, and Agatha trailed off. Noting that she had somehow lost the plot once more. She wished Nicky would just put her out of her misery; the attempt to finish the puzzle on her own was causing her anxiety to gnaw at her. “What is it?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky stood his ground. “I want to be a <em> mom </em>.” He enunciated the word as if its meaning was obvious. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, confused. <em> Why was Nicky so upset? </em> She had always told him that he could be whatever he wanted to be, and she had meant that. She would always fight for his happiness. <em> Why was he suddenly acting like she had told him he couldn’t do something? </em> “I… fully support that, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky facepalmed, looking at Rio for a little help. Rio tilted her head toward Agatha, speaking softly. “Nicky is trying to share that… Nicky has differing ideas about Nicky’s identity then uh, <em> she </em>was given at birth.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to Rio, nonchalantly correcting her. “He.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, continuing to rub her hand across Agatha’s back. “No, honey… not he.” Her eyes lifted. “Is that right, Nicky? I’m sorry, I know you haven’t told me pronouns yet…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brain went blank. She wasn’t following. Nicky nodded at Rio. “I think I am ready for she. I don’t like, hate he, but I want to try it out. Ultimately, I just want to make sure I never have to look like a man, cause… ew.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand covered her mouth. The words used started to seep past her clueless mind. Things were starting to click into place. Her eyes looked to Rio. Brown eyes holding her steady. She felt like she was falling, her hands moving to grip the couch cushions covertly. </p><p> </p><p>Rio spoke slowly. “Agatha. You don’t need to say anything right now. Just tell Nicky you love… them.” Rio cringed as she tried to help Agatha transition. She chanced a quick look at Nicky, and the child’s smile let her know that the kid didn’t mind, and she smiled gratefully at that. This would be an adjustment for all of them, but one they could conquer together.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's mind raced with too many questions. Before she voiced any of them, Rio’s hand pressed into her. Reminding her that maybe now wasn’t the time to speak them allowed, shaking her head slightly. Agatha rubbed her hands on her legs. “Oh… okay.” Her voice was quiet as she tried to think through things, but her mind kept going blank.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky relaxed, seeming like a weight was lifted off of her shoulders. “Cool. So I still like Nicky for my name, but I think I want to change Nicolas. Maybe Nicole or something? I’m not sure yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice rose in pitch as her surprise took over. “Oh.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio started to massage her back as she took over. “Thank you, Nicky, you keep us updated when you decide. Is it okay with you if your mom helps you pick out a new name? Or did you want to do that on your own?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky beamed. “I would love mom to help me,” She turned and flashed her a smile, and that was the first time during this whole conversation that Agatha’s smile met her eyes. Being included helped. She tried to keep breathing until it was safe to fall apart, feeling as if her world had been shifted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. “That’s very sweet, Nicky. Maybe you and your mom can work on some ideas this week, and we can trial a few for a while until you land on what you like.” </p><p> </p><p>Nicky nodded and turned to go. “I think I’m going to go watch my ballet show.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. “Don’t forget we’re going to go pick up pizza in an hour.” Nicky nodded as she bounded off.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath she had been holding escaped her the moment her child was gone. “What…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio squeezed Agatha. “Be careful with what you say around her. But you can talk freely with me as you work through this. I know this must be… a lot to take in. Just, let’s make sure Nicky isn’t around when you work through it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands came up to cover her mouth, keeping her panicked voice low. “Did I… do something wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, taking Agatha’s hands away from her face. “Honey, you did something right if that kid feels comfortable being herself so young.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I’m a bit… overwhelmed with all of this.” She found that her hands were shaking, her mind racing to remember every moment she had spent with her child. The memories mixed with a healthy dose of self-loathing that she hadn’t noticed herself, that she hadn’t been a better parent. </p><p> </p><p>Rio ran her thumbs over Agatha’s slim fingers. “That’s understandable.” She inclined her head. “If it makes you feel better, you’re her hero. She wants to grow up to be just like you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flooded with tears. Her voice was like gravel. “Why would…. <em> She… </em> .” She measured the word out slowly. “Want to be anything like me?” Agatha felt her breaths come faster. She wasn’t anything to be proud of. She had only recently found a career and started a relationship that wasn’t abusive. Nicky had spent her entire life watching idly by, seeing Agatha’s examples of what not to do. <em> Why would she want to be anything like her mom? </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes started to fill up as well. “Because you <em> are </em>a great mom.” Her hand moved easily through Agatha’s dark hair. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned into Rio. “I don’t want to mess this up.” The weight of the situation was crushing her. She didn’t know how to do this, how to raise Nicky as a girl. She felt woefully unprepared.</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere in her panic attack, Rio kissed her head. “We are going to mess this up; that’s inevitable. But we are going to <em> try. </em>And we will listen to her and give her all the support she needs. We’ll learn,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. Her voice gasped out as if someone was strangling her. “How are you so calm about all of this?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, blowing out a breath. “Oh, I wasn’t when she first told me. My gods, Agatha, I've been trying so hard not to out Nicky for a while now. It’s been torture every time we talk about…” She slowed to watch herself. “Her.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, biting at her lip. Her eyes held onto Rio’s like they could keep her from drowning. The realization that her child had gone to Rio first wasn’t lost on her. She wondered briefly if she was jealous, but quickly realized it wasn’t Rio she was mad at, it was herself. Because if she had done better, then Nicky would have felt comfortable coming to her first, right? </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a few calming breaths before continuing the conversation. “I guess… this all makes sense. If I…think about it.” She groaned. “My gods, Tori and my mother are going to have a stroke.” She pressed at her forehead as she felt a headache coming on. If things were bad with her mother and Tori before, this surely wasn’t going to help the situation. </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed. “Good, let them crash out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her tongue. “Do I let him…” She cringed; she had already messed up. How was she going to get this together in front of Nicky when she couldn’t even do it right in front of Rio? She adjusted her word choice. “Do I let <em> her… </em> dress up like a girl now?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged. “When she’s ready. She’s pretty androgynous in her style, but who knows, that may change. She’s a bit of a tomboy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yeah. She is.” Her chest heaved, and her hand moved to rub over her heart. “Wow, this is hard.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “It is. It’s even harder for Nicky.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes dropped, feeling that truth hit her in the face. She bit her lip to try and tamper her emotions. “I want Nicky to be happy.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled Agatha into a hug. “She will be.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took another breath as she returned the hug. Her eyes pinched shut. Rio’s warm and sturdy presence allowed her brain to start functioning, and she voiced her first thought.  “Maybe we take…. Her… to get her nails done? She really likes her nails painted.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. “That’s a great idea. Maybe we can even just start painting them at home? Could be a fun activity for all of us to do together.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cuddled up with Rio, praying she wouldn’t point out their current position right now because she couldn’t handle the overthinking that would also cause. “I would love that.”</p>

  <span>CHAPTER 38 </span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>The third post it note arrived in Agatha’s car that morning, on her steering wheel. She nearly screamed in frustration. </span>
  <em>
    <span>How was this person getting into her car now?</span>
  </em>
  <span> At her own home… well, Rio’s home. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Shit</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She drove to work so tense her shoulders were up to her ears. When she arrived, she burst into the hair and makeup trailer like a thunderstorm. Her emotions swirling and cracking, begging for the energy to unleash itself onto someone, anyone. Jen, unfortunately for her, was sitting innocently in her chair, enjoying her coffee. Having a quiet moment before the start to her day, a quiet moment that Agatha had now shattered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen let her head fall back as she let out a disgruntled groan. “No. No, no.” She whined. “Why did you have to come see me first with that attitude?” She moved to stand, and as she did, Agatha’s hand slapped a group of green notes to her chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is this a game to you?” Agatha’s eyes were pleading with Jen. Hoping she would admit this was just her playing some prank on Agatha, just like they used to do in school; that way she could move on with her life and not need to worry that someone was lurking too close to her family. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen set her coffee down as her hand held the notes, lifting them to her eyes. She read them slowly, her mouth dropping open in shock the more she read. Until finally her hand covered her mouth in horror. She lowered her hand as her eyes lifted. “Shit, Agatha, this is bad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes rolled. Agatha started pacing her, hand rubbing at her lips, the skin there already running raw with her worry. “So, it’s not you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen shook her head slowly. “These… this is probably a fan, but nonetheless, you should go to the police. Where do you keep finding these?” Dark eyes continued to read the words transcribed on the little papers as if perhaps there might have been some clue she had missed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha crossed her arms feeling ill at east. Her voice grew quieter, eyes looking around to see if there were hidden cameras she could spot. Her shoulders fell. Her eyes indicated the first location. “That chair.” Her eyes pointed to where Jen had been sitting, watching as her friend’s eyes only grew rounder. Blue eyes lifted to the door. “Another, on my trailer door.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sighed, pointing at the one Jen was now reading. “That one was on my steering wheel this morning, greeting me on my way to work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s eyebrows shot up. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>In </span>
  </em>
  <span>your car?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded as she took the notes back and read over the most recent one once more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>So how do you feel about back seats? ;)</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s eyes looked up as a thought struck her. “Why didn’t we try my backseat instead of the forest floor…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha growled. “Jen! Not helping.” She wanted to remind Jen that they had been stupid, hormone riddled children when they had hooked up, but getting on Jen’s nerves was not the priority right now. She could work on that task later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen waved her off, as the severity of the situation sunk in. “Okay, okay. Let’s think. Who has access to this room… and how did they get access to this set?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit her lip. “I have no clue.” Her fingers started to twitch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen leaned on the chair, her hands crushing the backing. “You have to tell Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes wandered about the room before they landed back on the notes. “I know. I just… don’t want to worry her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s jaw dropped. “Well, it’s better than one of these days she just finds you dead from a stalker, or hell, Agatha, what if something happens to Nicky or Rio!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha placed her hand on her chest, rubbing firmly. Her mind provided an unhelpful vision of Rio and Nicky all dressed in black before an image of coffins dominated her mind’s eye, and… was that Jen with snot running down her face in the corner of her vision, at the funeral? She jolted back to the present when Jen grabbed her arms, shaking her back into the present. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wake up, Harkness, this shit is </span>
  <em>
    <span>bad</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, her frame slightly shaking, her voice quiet. “Fuck. I hoped it was just you messing with me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen pulled Agatha to her and Agatha momentarily tried to fight the embrace. “Jen! Jen… what are you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman ignored her protests. “Shut up, Agatha. You’re not going anywhere alone until we figure this out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed and puffed, but in the end, she gave up and hugged Jen back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen had been Agatha’s shadow at work for days, they were inseparable. The cast and crew threw sad glances Rio’s way, when they all drew the same conclusion, that Agatha had moved on with Jennifer Kale. Rio rolled her eyes at the sympathy, Jen and Agatha weren’t cheating on her… at least, she assumed they weren’t. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As her eyes trailed them as they walked by, their attitudes became a bit cagey when their eyes caught her staring. Agatha opened her mouth as if she were about to say something before Jen smacked her in the arm with a muffled, </span>
  <em>
    <span>not in front of everyone</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Rio couldn’t help her laughter at their panicked expressions. They looked at her, not like they were trying to hide something, but as if they couldn't find a way to talk to her about what was on their minds.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, she knew they would come to her eventually. Whatever those two were up to, she was sure it wasn’t about to break her heart. She knew their history and she knew Agatha, she trusted her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen followed Agatha into Rio’s house. Her hands tapped at the air. “Okay, we need to write up everything you remember about where you found these… and take photos. You also should hide these in a safe place,” She handed over the green slips of paper. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded as she led the way to her room, well, to her and Rio’s room now. She still wasn’t ready to move upstairs, and it seemed that Rio wasn’t ready to start sleeping without her again. Agatha went to place the notes into her desk when she saw another neon green note on her pillow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fucking hell…” She picked it up. Her fingers were shaking. They had been in her house, in her </span>
  <em>
    <span>room</span>
  </em>
  <span>, her room </span>
  <em>
    <span>with </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio. She shook her head, nearly tripping over her chair as she backed away from the bed, wondering if they were still in the space with her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I hope your dreams include me ;)</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head as she spit out a harsh reply, just in case anyone was listening. “They definitely won’t.” She went to place the notes in her drawing book, anxiously watching her back, when her hand dropped the book open. A green sticky note sat promptly on the inside cover.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Finish drawing me yet?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No. Fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <em>
    <span>They knew she was drawing people?</span>
  </em>
  <span> She tried to scream for Jen but her voice gave out, fear winning. She moved to her door, just in time to hear Rio come down the stairs that lead to her own space, effectively trapping her in her doorway. Brown eyes went wide at finding Agatha home so early.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, a bit confused, and stepped up to kiss Agatha on the cheek. “Honey, you’re home early…’ Her voice drifted off as she heard Jen coming down the hall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There was nothing on the security cam…” Jen’s voice dropped off quickly. “Rio.” Her airway constricted. Looking between Agatha and Rio, her face desperately trying to ask Agatha if she had said anything. Her eyes indicated the woman was right there and she should go on and spill.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s arm came up to hold her other, scratching lightly. “Why would you need to check the security footage?” The woman looked like she might hurl, her voice coming out strained. “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes looked at Jennifer, then to Rio. There was no way she was getting out of telling Rio now, but she could stall. “You wanted me to have friends over, look it’s Jen.” She waved at the woman, as she turned and fled back into her room, trying to take a second to formulate her confession. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio followed and shut the door in Jen’s face before her own back fell against the steady wood structure. Her eyes searched for Agatha’s attention, her voice attempting to clear the emotion from her vocal chords. “I’m trying not to freak out right now…” She offered up a nervous smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed, placing her hands on her desk, her head dropping forward. “Then don’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed, her patience breaking like a twig. “In my own home, Agatha? And… with… Jen? Really?” Rio’s eyes closed as she attempted to gather herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned and sat on the desk, crossing her arms. “I don’t really have any other friends, Rio.” She widened her eyes in challenge. “Did you want me to just conjure some?” She flicked her hand up in the air as if she were doing magic. She then ran her hand through her hair, “You said I could be friends with Jen…” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Was Rio really choosing now to get possessive? Should she have seen this coming?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grunted. “So what was this? Second chances? A fateful encounter years later that just </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> to mean something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tilted her head, her eyes widening further. “What are you talking about?” Now it didn’t sound like they were talking about Jen anymore. She had missed something…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio licked her lips. “What </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>it about her? Is it that she’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>mean </span>
  </em>
  <span>to you? Cause…” Her voice shifted, moving from anger to desperation. “I–I can try that…if that’s what you need,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes took in Rio, her face was taught, pleading for her affection. Rio got on her knees. “What is it you want? I’ll … I’ll do it.” She grabbed Agatha’s pants and the woman stopped her. “Woah, Rio. Jen is right outside! What are you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand covered her face as she sobbed. Agatha’s mouth gaping. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What was going on?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio…” Agatha’s hand reached for Rio’s hair, the other woman shaking her head. Agatha withdrew her hand, figuring Rio didn’t want to be touched right now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead Agatha sat down carefully in front of her. Her mind told her to hurry up and speak before things got any worse, before this shifted into something she couldn’t fix. “I have a stalker.” She blurted it out so quickly that she wasn’t sure if the words had made any sense. She bit her lip as she waited for a reaction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s face lifted, her lip trembling. “A… stalker?” Her tone hinted at feelings of disbelief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> “The show hasn’t even aired yet. How could you already have a stalker?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged, her skin prickling at the feelings of being mocked. “You told me there were things I didn’t understand yet about this line of work. You were right, okay? Is that what you want to hear? I’m freaking the fuck out…” Her hand pointing to the hall, in exaggeration. “I even told Jen!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio deflated, her head dropping to the side to the mattress beside her. “You told Jen, but not me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged, “You kept insisting she was my friend… I thought… that’s what you wanted. For me to have, like, a play date or something. Here she is, and you slammed the door in her face.” Agatha rubbed at her forehead, wondering if it had been a good idea to involve Jen at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped, exasperated. “Only because, I thought you were trying to fuck her in </span>
  <em>
    <span>our </span>
  </em>
  <span>home!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s body stilled. Her mind reviewing what things might have looked like from Rio’s perspective, and still came up blank. As well as the fact that… Did Rio just call it </span>
  <em>
    <span>their</span>
  </em>
  <span> home? She leveled Rio with an exasperated stare. “Baby… it’s… Jen!” She said it as if the joke made all the sense in the world. “It’s Jenny Kale,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sniffed, her nose starting to run. “I thought so too… but then… Why did you need to check the security footage? And you two have been inseparable for like a week…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pointed to the notes on her desk. “Because, Rio – I have a stalker that's been in our house!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s honey colored eyes glanced to the desk and found the neon green notes. Her face went blank. “Your… stalker?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed. “Yes… look, I’m sorry, Rio, but I think we need to go to the police. This has been going on a while now, and I didn’t want to worry you, but I think it’s too late for that.” She reached forward and grabbed Rio’s face. “All I care about is that you and Nicky are safe…” She rolled her eyes as she heard the floor creak in her hallway. “Okay and maybe Jen needs to survive too. I don’t know yet, that’s debatable at this point…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her shoulders cave in, her breath leaving her in a puff of air. “You’re an idiot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled back an inch, hurt coloring her tone. “Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio wiped at her face and stood, storming towards the door. When she opened it, Jen practically fell forward as she had been eavesdropping.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey girl… I so didn’t sleep with her.” She shook her head wildly. “I know what it looks like, but I totally ship you two.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned and looked at Agatha. “Come here. Now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scrambled to get up. Rio never demanded things of her, and she was indeed a bit scared by what Rio’s tone might mean.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her hand was grabbed when she came close. Rio’s eyes locking onto Jen. “You too.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio guided both women upstairs into her bedroom and dropped Agatha’s hand in the doorway. “Honestly, you two have a wild imagination. How would someone have gotten in Agatha’s car, let alone in here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen and Agatha looked at each other before Agatha shook her head. Speaking as if it made sense. They weren’t crazy. “Someone else has to have access to set that shouldn’t, I’m sure of it… and </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>car and our </span>
  <em>
    <span>home? </span>
  </em>
  <span>How do you explain that, Rio? I’m fucking terrified…” her voice trailed off as Rio ripped open her desk drawer and dropped stacks of neon green sticky notes on top. A black eyebrow arching up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It couldn’t have possibly been the </span>
  <em>
    <span>one</span>
  </em>
  <span> person who has had access to every single place you mentioned. That would be too simple.” She indicated the paper with the flick of her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What now Nancy Drews?” Rio inquired. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen’s mouth was gaping like a fish, Agatha’s face had gone blank. “Why… why would you leave those?” Agatha’s voice had gone quiet like she had been scolded and unfortunately with her upbringing, that had happened quite a lot and she was used to the feeling that now stabbed her between the ribs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s cheeks flushed, as she twitched nervously. “I wanted to leave you… thirst posts… like you left me.” Her eyes held a level of vulnerability that Agatha hadn’t witnessed in her lover before. She looked crushed and beyond embarrassed. “I was… trying… to flirt with you and I thought… that you were into it and saving them.” Her eyes started to fill with tears due to the misunderstanding, striking a nerve. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha placed her hair behind her ear. Taking in Rio’s upset as if it were a slash to her chest. “Why didn’t you just tell me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio crossed her arms, lashing out. “I didn’t know you were </span>
  <em>
    <span>stupid</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted, words flying from her mouth before she could think about what she was doing. “You know I </span>
  <em>
    <span>am</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen raised her hand. “I… could have told you that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio glared at both of them. “Well, I guess that explains why you never wrote me back…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen closed her mouth and Agatha turned to make her excuses. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio growled. “I swear to god if you tell Jen </span>
  <em>
    <span>one </span>
  </em>
  <span>more time we’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>fucking. I might just end things with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned on her heels and rushed into Rio’s space, livid. “You had me sign an NDA!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped. “That was months ago and please, if you won’t even tell the one person you </span>
  <em>
    <span>could tell </span>
  </em>
  <span>then what are we even doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked taken aback. “I can… I can tell Jen?” She pointed at the tall black woman as if Rio had no idea who she was referring to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio closed her eyes and sighed. “In what world does Jen not already know, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen raised her hand. “I knew all along…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned and glared, her voice sarcastic. “Thank you, Jen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned back to Rio as the woman closed herself off. The tell tale signs of being mortified flushing her chest. Blue eyes shifted as something caught a ray of light streaming in through the window. A small open box sat beside the mounds of green sticky notes. The stupid thing sparkling away as if there wasn’t a showdown of egos in the room to be upstaged by.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It took Rio a moment to release her arms, her eyes drifting to where Agatha’s eyes must have wandered and her heart visibly sank, her hand coming up to rub at the side of her neck. “It’s… nothing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stomped forward, bypassing Rio, and stared down in shock at the very clear engagement ring sitting in Rio’s drawer. The other woman shifted in front of Agatha to close the desk. “I told you it’s nothing. Don’t freak out.” She watched as Agatha sat back on her bed, her hand covering her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why… Do you have that?” A pale hand shook as she moved to point at the offending object. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes. “Because I’m madly in love with Jen, and we’re going to run away together.” She was clearly joking, yet Agatha’s eyes shot daggers at her love. Perhaps it was Rio’s fault for the deadpan delivery.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha exploded. “What!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed. “Agatha, it was a </span>
  <em>
    <span>joke</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The brunette was not finding the humor in the situation. “Sure, make fun of me because I thought that maybe… just maybe, you wanted to spend the rest of your life with me, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m </span>
  </em>
  <span>the idiot.” She accentuated her words by the violent thuds her hand was making on her own chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pinched her nose before she let her hand fall to her side. “I already told you that I wanted to spend my life with you. Do you ever </span>
  <em>
    <span>listen </span>
  </em>
  <span>to me? I asked how you felt about getting married again and I got the message. I haven’t asked, and that thing has stayed safely stowed in that drawer…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen pointed out into the hall. “I’m just… going to wait downstairs.” She peaced out as the other two women continued on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rubbed firmly at her eyes. “Well, I didn’t think you </span>
  <em>
    <span>meant </span>
  </em>
  <span>it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat beside her and waited until Agatha could suck in enough oxygen to breathe. Rio looked at Agatha a few times, losing her nerve and looking away before she finally got up the courage to speak. “I’m … sorry. The notes were supposed to be … cute. I know, I’m weird.” She ran her hand through her hair. “I’ve heard it before.” She placed her hand gently on Agatha’s back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted through her tears; everything was hitting her, and it was all too much. “I thought someone was going to kill me. Or worse… hurt you and Nicky.” She sobbed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her hair fall in front of her face, eyes scrunching shut. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Shit</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Her hand stayed connected with Agatha’s back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha blew out a breath, her eyes moving to the drawer and fixating on it as if a question had been asked. Her voice was quiet as if she might be scared of her own answer. She tested it out hesitantly, softly. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rubbed at her forehead. “Okay. I know… shit. I fucked up with the notes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, her finger pointing at the desk. “No, not that.” She swallowed, her saliva thickening as if she was about to be sick. “Yes…to that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up, shaking her head. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took in a deep breath, and when she failed to form words, she took in another. “Yes. I want it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes followed Agatha’s line of sight. “The desk? I thought you liked the one you had downstairs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed. “The ring.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyebrows went sky high. “I haven’t asked you yet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged. “Then you shouldn’t have let me see it.” Agatha huffed, growing impatient. “Ask me.” Her blue eyes were staring unwavering into Rio’s brown ones. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stood and left Agatha where she was sitting. “Well, you can’t have it yet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha glared at the drawer that contained the ring as if it were the object's fault for the rejection she was currently feeling. She stood. “Then I’ll… I’ll buy </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>a ring.” She chewed at her lip as her voice wavered. “As soon as I get paid…” Money was still an issue. Her eyes lifted, showing Rio how scared she was of being rejected. “Would you say, yes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned and crossed her arms. “I don’t think that’s how you ask someone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha put a hand in her hair then fisted it, hard. “I just…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio plopped onto her bed, her own eyes staring at the drawer. “Since when did you know you wanted that with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha groaned, “Since you wanted to fuck Jen!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio's eyes narrowed as she stood, her arms remaining crossed. “I don’t want to fuck Jen. I thought you did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha growled. “No, I want to fuck you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nearly screamed. “Agatha! You already have sex with me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes widened as her arm swept out to the side. “And I love you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both stopped. Agatha let her hands fall, no longer fighting. Her body was losing its tension because she gave up. Everything she wanted now, were things she wanted with Rio. “I love you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She bit her lip as her tears started falling. “Maybe our conversation did hit me hard. Maybe I have been thinking about what being with you forever would be like. Maybe I want a claim on you before the premier, when suddenly everyone will be looking at you once again and wanting to take you away from me…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to reach for Agatha but the woman stepped backward. “I’m sorry I saw the ring. I wasn’t looking through your things, </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>opened that drawer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Brown eyes looked at every inch of Agatha’s face before she grabbed her arms. “Okay, I’m really happy you told me that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged, trying lamely to pull away. “It doesn’t matter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes and grabbed Agatha’s face. “It means </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span> to me.” Agatha’s hands came up and pinned Rio’s hands where they were. Rio continued. “I have had a plan to ask you, can you let me do that? It will take a little time, just know it is coming, even if it’s not today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tilted her head in thought before she nodded. “As long as you don’t go anywhere.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. “I literally come home to the same house as you.”</span>

  <span>CHAPTER 39 </span>
</h1><p>
  <span>Agatha had been banned from Rio’s room while she worked on her proposal. Nicky was still able to come and go as she pleased, but had to swear she would never speak about what she saw Rio doing in the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled out her glasses; no one knew she wore them. She could normally get away without them, but tonight her eyes were just too tired. A quiet knock came at her door, and her hand lifted to remove them from her face when she paused and shook her head. It was just Nicky, Nicky could know her little secret. She cleared her throat. “Come in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky opened the door, her eyes flashed, taking in Rio’s new look. “Cute glasses.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio wrinkled her nose. She was about to swear Nicky to secrecy about their existence when she realized maybe she didn’t care about people knowing anymore. She took in the child before her. Nicky’s smile was bright, her hair had grown a little longer, and they had gotten layers cut in at Rio’s hair stylist. She would have gotten Agatha an appointment too, if Jen wouldn’t have taken care of her long hair one day in frustration. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen had bullied Agatha into arriving an hour early to set one morning so she could fix up her long layers before they were styled. Jen was a little hurt they didn’t have her cut Nicky’s hair, but there was always next time. Jen was becoming a prominent part of the family, and Rio often joked that she was their second kid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio waved Nicky over, and she ran up and plopped on Rio’s bed, scooting across to sit behind Rio’s desk. The woman fully turned, and a warm smile came over her as she took in the child’s nails. “Wow, green today?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky shrugged, full of glee. “Yeah, it’s your favorite color. I thought I would try it.” She held her nails up in front of her, “I like it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt a warmth spread through her chest. “It looks great on you, Nicks.” She leaned forward and ran a hand through Nicky’s hair. “Your hair is getting long, I bet it will be as long as your Momma’s soon.” She flashed her eyes, and the child shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I hope so.” Her brown eyes drifted over to Rio’s computer. “Still working on Momma’s story?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, leaning back in her chair, swiveling it back and forth. “Yeah… a bit stuck at the moment, but I am sure that will pass.” She raised an eyebrow. “She still trying to get information on my plan?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded. “Yep.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked. “And what did you tell her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky smiled. “Nothing. I avoided the question.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio high fived the kid. “Good girl.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky crawled over into the bed and snuggled down in the covers. “Is Momma’s story a happy one?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned and tapped at her desk. “It is in the end. I hope it doesn’t make her too sad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky yawned. “She’ll love it, cause you made it for her. She likes it when people make her things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. Turning to jot down a thought as Nicky continued speaking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio, can we get Momma a bunny for her birthday?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s head turned over her shoulder, her head tilting. “Honey, it’s almost </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>birthday, we should be thinking about what to get you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shrugged. “I wanna get Momma a bunny. That’s what I want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “We need to see how Ruff does around them, We should take him to the pet store and see. Though if we get her a bunny, we are getting a rescue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky wiggled her little feet. “Okay, can we go to the pet store soon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “Of course.” As her eyes slid back to her laptop, she heard Nicky mumbling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can you read me the kid-safe parts again? I love your story.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved slowly to unplug her laptop and moved around the bed to the other side, Nicky snuggling in with her, her dark eyes closing as Rio kissed her head. “I’ll always read to you, Nicky.” She grabbed her phone from the bedside table and let Agatha know she was reading Nicky a bedtime story, and she would bring her down when she was asleep. Agatha texted her back that it was okay if Nicky slept upstairs tonight. Rio settled in and felt Nicky twitch against her. Though she wasn’t sure if she was even awake anymore, she started to read her tale.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat on the couch. She had been lonely last night, since Rio and Nicky had a sleepover in the room that was totally off limits to her. She had been on her laptop scrolling for a while and had been looking at wedding dresses for a good two hours already this morning. She sighed as she added another to her list when she heard someone behind her and she just about shit herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Morning,” Rio said sweetly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha jolted, her hand closing the laptop a bit too hard and cringing, hoping she hadn’t broken it. She turned to see Rio’s eyebrow raised and her tongue poking at her cheek. Her hand was pointing at her. “So, early morning porn sesh?” she took a step forward then paused, a look came over her face and she got nervous. “Did you… Need me to go, so you can finish?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head abruptly. “It wasn’t porn.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved around the couch and sat down gently. “You know it’s okay if it was, right? I’m sorry I was gone all night. Nicky’s snoring totally put me to sleep, she sounds just like you do…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tapped her fingers on her laptop as she opened it slowly, her face flushing. “I was… just looking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes stayed with Agatha until she scooted a little closer, her thighs flush with Rio’s. “You can look, but I’m embarrassed for the record. I didn’t…” she sighed. “Do this last time. Tori just picked everything. It didn’t matter to me because I wanted her to have the wedding of her dreams. I know we’re not… engaged, I just… I don’t know.” She shifted uncomfortably. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took in the screen and melted. Agatha was looking at wedding dresses. Well, they looked more like lingerie tops with a long lace skirt, but they would look beautiful on her, giving Rio a few ideas for what she wanted to wear as well. If she didn’t wear a feminine suit, she would totally find something in this style for herself to match. Was that too much?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She leaned into Agatha, one hand wrapping around a pale arm, nails scratching lightly, as Rio moved to scroll down the page of images Agatha had collected. “These would look stunning on you.” She rested her head on Agatha’s shoulder. “Did you find one you had to have?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head. “I don’t know what I can afford yet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked at the prices she could see and shrugged. “We could figure it out. I might need to see you in one of these… for science, of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “Yeah.. we’ll see. Someone still hasn’t asked me yet.” The dig set off a spark in Rio. She adjusted her head away from her shoulder perch. Her mouth running away from her and mumbling without her brain’s consent. “Someone needs to finish their divorce.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s body deflated, and Rio sat up, holding on to her. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, letting out a long sigh. “It was my fault for marrying her. And the divorce was finally about to go through when she got wind that I might be coming into some money. Don’t know why she cares, she has plenty.” She sighed, flipping through images. “I didn’t even ask for much, just money for Nicky.” She looked back at the dresses, defeated. “I don’t know when I’ll be able to afford that house upgrade you wanted…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned in and kissed her shoulder, “We already have a house. We’re fine. I didn’t mean it. I like my house. It’s just big enough for us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned back into the couch. “It is a nice house.” Blue eyes flicked to Rio, then were drawn back to her computer. She bit at the tip of her tongue in thought as Rio smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Patience, Agatha.” She patted her leg, “You’ll get what you want. Just… wait.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <span>CHAPTER 40</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shut the passenger side door as Rio came around and grabbed her hand. Blue eyes looked around and took in their studio lot, biting her cheek subtly. Her mood instantly fell with the temperature outside of the car. “Rio, it’s cold. What are we doing here?” She had wanted to stay home and have a quiet night in, but her… she guessed </span>
  <em>
    <span>girlfriend </span>
  </em>
  <span>now, had mentioned that she had forgotten her favorite sweatshirt on set and that they had to go retrieve it… right this instant, before she never saw it again. Luckily, Lilia had been available to rush over and take care of Nicky.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip, clearly nervous. “I don’t want someone to take it, Agatha. I left it on the set, you know there are so many people who come through here daily...” She pulled her along as Agatha rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We know most of the people.” She sighed. “I am sure someone would have grabbed it for you, noticing it was yours.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha followed Rio, briefly dropping her hand as her partner entered the code for the side door and they stepped into a pitch black set. Well, nearly pitch black, there were some emergency lights that glowed around the perimeter. Rio turned and placed her hands on Agatha’s shoulders. “I’ll go get it, you just wait here. We don’t need both of us breaking our ankles.” She smirked as she took off, illuminating the space before her with her phone’s flashlight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shivered as she watched her go. It wasn’t much warmer in the building than outside, but at least it wasn’t wet. She looked around the familiar space, noticing the outline of the trees they filmed with frequently were ahead of her as her eyes adjusted. As the moments continued to stretch, she wondered what was taking Rio so long. She had expected a quick “got it” to ring out within the first few minutes they were here, but the set remained silent aside from the hum of the emergency lights. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe Rio really hadn't even left her sweatshirt on set and it was sitting at home in the laundry this whole time. She had asked her multiple times if she had checked everywhere before she had agreed to get into the car, she wondered now if she should have double checked herself. Come to think of it, she didn’t really remember the sweater that Rio had described to her, she wondered why she hadn’t seen it before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bounced on her toes as she tried to warm up. Rio had brought Agatha her green puffer jacket, but she had left it in the car, knowing that they wouldn’t be here long. She started to wonder if she should go back and get it. Her eyes shifted to the forest as the lights had just come on. Rio must have needed a bit more light for her search. Blue eyes rolled, so she </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> forgotten where she left her sweatshirt. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Typical</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let her eyes take in the flickering of purple, green, and blue lights. She tried to hold on to her frustration but the beauty that surrounded her was hard to ignore. She figured she might as well wander over through the forest and help Rio look, after all apparently this sweatshirt was important to her lover. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her hands came up to brush the trees and shrubs that packed the area. She glanced around, but Rio was nowhere in sight. “Rio? You find it?” She continued to watch her step as she moved through the foliage. A soft track of bugs and water started playing, and she smiled. This really was starting to feel magical, like she was really in an enchanted woods. She was glad production had gone for a more practical approach because it made believing where you were so much easier when you were immersed in it and could really </span>
  <em>
    <span>see</span>
  </em>
  <span> it all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she drew closer to the center of the “forest,” she heard Rio reading… </span>
  <em>
    <span>had she wanted to do an impromptu reading over their next scene?</span>
  </em>
  <span> They weren’t due for that until the day after. She continued to creep closer still.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was wearing a plain forest green cotton t-shirt, one of Rio’s, her black ripped jeans and her hiking boots covering her feet. She smiled as a realization struck her while contemplating her borrowed shirt. She had watched Rio’s body of work for years and she had sworn that if she ever had the opportunity to love this woman, that she would love her with all she had.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had worried in the beginning that if Rio was who she said she was, that she would never be able to keep up, or get over her shock. But that wasn’t the case. The more time she spent with Rio, the more it made the woman so much smaller than she used to be in Agatha’s mind. Rio wasn’t this entity that could never be reached, she was just a normal person. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha’s </span>
  </em>
  <span>person. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was weird. She was funny, awkward, sweet, and definitely more beautiful up close. Agatha's chest warmed at the fact that few got to see Rio the way she did. That the real Rio was often contemplative and gentle, and loved to be bossed around in the bedroom. Agatha bit her lip, she was also kind and took good care of her and Nicky, always anticipating their needs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha wondered how Rio had gotten so good at it all. From what she knew, Rio only interacted with Lilia and her friend Alice. But despite spending a whole day with the photographer, she hadn’t gotten much information out of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mind went back to an early conversation with her lover. Rio had mentioned she was selective about what she shared and was strategic about how she wielded her humor, so no one really knew all that much about her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha faltered. Did she really </span>
  <em>
    <span>know </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio? She knew what she had read online, before she knew Rio, but as far as the Rio before her? She found she really couldn’t recall much information when she thought about it. Her heart started to beat a bit faster. Would Rio ever open up to her? She continued to spiral. Had it been long enough that she could ask? Or had it been too long, and now questions that were staring her right in the face would be too painful to search for, months into a relationship?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mind tumbled while she listened to Rio’s voice, her mind finally starting to tune into the words she heard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The agent hadn’t seen her in days, her heart clenched as she saw the woman she was secretly pining for, drenched in the rain. Light eyes locking with hers, but neither saying a word…” Rio read.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tilted her head. This was a story about one of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Rio’s </span>
  </em>
  <span>characters, </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>The Forest. She had never heard this scene before… This story must be new, she had read most of the stories about the agent. She moved closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice grew louder as she approached. “They had been dancing around each other for so long, neither knew how to take the next step. But as the rain poured down, Agent Carter took one step forward…” Brown eyes lifted as Agatha entered the little clearing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes looked about the area as Rio trailed off. Agatha’s voice was quiet as it joined the surrounding space. “Reading to the plants? Will it help them grow?” She let her lips tick up into a smile, she gestured around with a single finger. “They’re fake, you know. Well,” she continued to look at the foliage, “most of them.” Rio stood from her place on a gigantic artificial tree root. Tapping what looked like a script on her hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Something like that.” She offered it to Agatha as she got close. “I wrote your story.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands just about dropped the stack of papers when they were handed to her. “What?” She almost lost them, but Rio swept in to help steady the sheets in her hands, her smile widening. “Don’t lose those!” She giggled. “This is some of my best work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s body felt like all the air had been drawn out of her lungs. Rio had actually written her the story? She had assumed there would never </span>
  <em>
    <span>be </span>
  </em>
  <span>a story. “Are you even a writer? I thought this was just part of your carefully constructed plot to get me into your bed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “It wasn’t a thing, until… recently.” She pressed the papers to Agatha’s chest as she leaned in to kiss her lips, Agatha meeting them gently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Rio pulled back, there were already tears in Agatha’s eyes, her voice rough yet quiet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio… no one… no one has ever written something for me. I...” She wiped at her own tears, now a bit embarrassed at the display of emotion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands shook as she took her arms, and Agatha’s eyes widened in concern. Was Rio alright? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Should she have her sit down?</span>
  </em>
  <span> She turned quickly to look for somewhere for her to go, and when she turned back around to grab her, Rio took to her knees, a single ring cupped in her hands. “Agatha…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha froze, her body, this moment, nothing felt real. “What are you doing?” It was rhetorical, of course, she knew exactly what was happening. She thought she was going to have to wait months for this moment, and at first, she had been so anxious every day that </span>
  <em>
    <span>this </span>
  </em>
  <span>might be coming around the corner. Then, when it never did, she started to forget about it. She had fallen back into her routine. The show was wrapping soon – something she definitely wasn’t ready for, and yet she had been just busy enough to forget that this was coming.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio gulped. “I am so… </span>
  <em>
    <span>nervous </span>
  </em>
  <span>right now.” She took a deep breath, and it came out shaky.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved to kneel before her, Rio looked awfully pale, like she might pass out any moment now. She leaned forward and placed a hand on Rio’s leg. “You don’t have to do this.” She heard herself offer up the words, and she both wanted to slap herself for trying to sabotage this on the verge of getting what she wanted, but also was a little proud of herself that she wanted to make sure that this was what Rio wanted </span>
  <em>
    <span>more</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed quietly. “Oh, I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t want to. I have been on edge for weeks. Ever since you told me…you wanted this with me.” She watched as Agatha set her script on the ground. “Agatha, I don’t know what I should say here, and honestly, my mind is pretty blank since writing that story for you, but I know that I want you and Nicky in my life, for a long time. Forever, if you’ll allow me to have that. So I guess, uhm.” She closed her eyes. “Will you marry me?” Her eyes flew open. “Like someday, it doesn’t have to be soon…I know you’re still warming up to… the idea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned forward and grabbed Rio by the back of the neck, locking eyes with her, her gaze dipping to Rio’s lips, watching as her pink tongue came out briefly to wet them. Blue eyes looked back up into dark brown eyes sparkling in the glow of the lights, and she nodded before she closed the distance and kissed her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled her to her quickly, dropping the ring. She quickly pulled back, patting around for it. Agatha found it easily and held it up. “This for me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted. Her smile widened. “Yeah, can I?” She pointed at Agatha’s hand, and the woman blushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure… I guess.” She tried to sound unbothered, but she was elated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took the ring more carefully this time and slipped the small circle over Agatha’s ring finger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes widened in recognition. “Wait. I bought a ring.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes scrunched, trying to decipher Agatha’s words. “For yourself?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Yes.” She huffed. Rio’s shoulders dropped slightly before she amended. “No, for you. It’s… at home…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled. “Well, now I’m excited.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s smile fell a bit. “I wish Nicky were here,” She cleared her throat and folded her hair behind her ear with careful fingers, wondering if that was the wrong thing to say.  “Is that weird?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “No… and that’s actually good, because…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Little feet came thundering down the stage. “Did she say yes? I couldn’t tell!” Nicky yelled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes were wide as she took in her son… no, her </span>
  <em>
    <span>daughter</span>
  </em>
  <span>, then Rio. Her love shrugged as the little girl tackled her mother. “I figured you would need her here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gripped Nicky hard to calm down when she heard Ruffland prancing over to his mother, plopping across her lap the moment he found her, and a few sets of footsteps approaching. Lilia, Jen, Alice, and Billy all came walking up from the same path.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alice with a camera around her neck. “I got some great shots!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jen sighed, looking Agatha over. “I tried to do your glam, but Rio was worried that you would know it was coming. Shame you’re going to be ugly in the photos.” Agatha smiled, and Alice smacked Jen on the arm, already fast friends. Jen smirked as she looked over at Rio. “Nice story by the way, you should submit that somewhere.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio blushed, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy was already crying and just kept squealing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia walked over and held Rio’s shoulder as she leaned down to kiss the top of Rio’s head. “You did great, kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky leaned back and looked up at her Momma. “Rio is ours now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled. “Rio is ours now.” Her eyes lifted to Rio as she brushed her hand through Nicky’s long hair. “She promised.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky threw herself towards Rio, the woman catching her easily and holding her close. “Thanks for the help, Nicks.”</span>

  <h1 align="center">
  <span>CHAPTER 41 </span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat in the backyard alone. Her hand firmly gripped her hair as her eyes couldn’t see straight. The ring on her finger felt heavy. What if she messed it all up? </span>
  <em>
    <span>She had before, hadn't she?</span>
  </em>
  <span> By tying herself to the wrong person? What if her mother was right and she was cursed?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha wore a black cropped tank top that didn’t even come to the bottom of her ribs, a long black skirt with tooling that looked like the night sky in the light, covered her legs from the slight chill in the California night air. Her feet were bare but with a dark blue nail polish that Nicky had chosen and wanted the three of them to wear when they had all done their nails the day before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Nicky</span>
  </em>
  <span>… she was going to need to start hormone blockers soon. Agatha rubbed at her scalp. Were those better than the hormones she had let ravage her own body? She knew literally nothing about transitioning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stood and walked further into the yard, her hand releasing her hair and her eyes looking up at the moon, surprised it was visible in the Los Angeles night sky. She sighed. Everything was moving too fast now. The end of the show, getting engaged, Nicky’s transition, her divorce. She felt like she was spinning and might fall at any moment. She walked a bit further before she found that she had to lay down, her hair sprawling out around her. She looked for stars, but they were hard to find. She did enjoy the nighttime clouds, hopefully, they were clouds and not pollution.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took a deep breath and let it out. She did so again. And again. She closed her eyes, one hand on her chest the other on her stomach, she practiced her breathing. She had a plan. She had gotten dressed, she allowed her hair to air dry with a mouse that Jen had sworn worked wonders for her curls, and it really had. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had donned jewelry for the evening. She wore small golden hoop earrings. She had done her makeup, dark eyeliner with purple eyeshadow, her lips with a soft pink. She lifted her hand in front of her face and opened her eyes, a beautiful ring now sat on her hand most of the time. Well, sometimes, because at times, she was too terrified to wear it and feared she would lose it – other times, she feared it wasn’t real and found she had to keep it on to ground herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She curled on her side and noticed that while she had been panicking, she had completely missed that Rio had joined her outside, brown eyes were wide staring up at the sky. Agatha held Rio in her sight as if the moment she looked away, Rio would finally fade, an illusion, and she would be back in her mom’s basement. Rio’s hand reached out and grabbed hers without looking, dark eyes continuing to watch the stars.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re worried.” Rio whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. Her voice was thick with all of the things that weighed heavily on her mind.  “What if it doesn’t last?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. Her head turned to look at Agatha “What if it does?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit her lip. “You got your next role, didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “It films in LA, my love. I’ll be home every night…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed. “I won’t get to see you very much.” She blew out a breath. “I know how much you work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rhythmically squeezed at Agatha’s hands as she tried to reassure her. “Agatha, they’re looking at giving us a season two and the show hasn't even aired yet. Be patient, my love, this is just another pilot season.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha kept their hands intertwined as she came closer. Her head ducking into Rio’s shoulder. Rio wrapped an arm over Agatha’s and started to play with her hair. “Te veo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha knew she did. Rio knew her too well most of the time. She only wished she knew the dark haired beauty as much. “Will you love me when I’m… older?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, entertained. “Baby, I’ll be older too. And of course I will.” She kissed Agatha’s dark hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha breathed in her scent, there was something about the way that Rio smelled that she found could always calm her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio let her relax for a while when she finally spoke. “Okay, as beautiful as this is, I don’t think either of us want to wake up in morning dew so,” As Rio moved to sit up, Agatha bolted upright.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat up slower, but didn’t move to stand. Waiting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat with her legs under her, her ankles out to one side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cupped her face. “You look beautiful tonight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The brunette snorted, as if she didn’t quite believe her. “Honey, everything looks good on me.” She joked as she let her eyes drift away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned her chin back to her and locked with her gaze, nodding her head seriously as her brown eyes darted down to Agatha’s pink lips and back to crystal blue. “It does.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised her fingers nervously to her lips. “I wanted to talk to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached out and held a pale hand, and this time it wasn’t for Agatha’s benefit. “Okay…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes looked around the yard, a glow coming from the garden lights. It wasn’t as impressive as on set, but she wasn’t really sure how to do this. Agatha let her head fall forward a bit before she lifted her eyes. “I… don’t know how…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brows furrowed. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved to slowly cover Rio’s eyes, “Maybe if you just… there.” The other woman getting the idea and playing along. Rio sat there with her eyes closed, her body relaxed and trusting, the only indication that she was nervous was her tight grip on Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached into her bra and breathed a sigh of relief that the ring was still there. She shifted onto her knees and placed it in her lap, her hands finding Rio’s face and kissing her softly. Rio gave into her instantly, melting into her, as Agatha’s hands moved swiftly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Quickly taking Rio’s hand and guessing at the finger, slipping the ring on. The kiss broke the moment it slid into place. Her eyes opening, sitting back just far enough that she could see Rio’s reaction. Dark eyes opened, lowering to the ring and lingering. It was agonizing during the long moments that Agatha waited for Rio to say something.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman was stunned for quite a few heartbeats, then a smile bloomed across her face. The green and black gems contrasting nicely with the white gold. “Sweet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed. “Sweet. Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “Well, what am I supposed to say? You haven’t asked me anything yet.” She teased quietly before she leaned forward. “It’s beautiful.” Rio’s head tilted in question. “How did you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s shoulders pulled in a little. “Lilia loaned me the money, said she would just add it to her cut. She… tried to pay for some of it, but I told her I wanted to pay for it all. She… helped me figure out how much I should spend…I made sure it had your favorite colors,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes started to water. “I’m going to take good care of you and Nicky. I promise.” Her voice was a bit unsteady as she fought back tears. “Shit. I didn’t think I was going to cry again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes started to water as well, but she held the tears back. “Thank you, I know you will.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grabbed her suddenly and kissed her again, pouring her whole soul into the kiss with Agatha. As if she also needed confirmation that Agatha was really there and wasn’t going anywhere.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When they took a breath, Rio’s eyes looked towards the house. “This is so cute, but I really am getting cold, can we?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded and she stood, extending a hand to Rio, the woman taking her hand gently. “Wow, what a gentleman.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Agatha pulled her up with a grunt, she shook her head when Rio didn’t release her hand. “Only for you, mi amor.” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <span>Walking back to the house hand in hand, Agatha didn’t have all of her questions answered, but she knew that her and Rio were going to be together for a long, long, long time. She hoped that one day, when it all inevitably came to an end, that Rio’s face would be the last one she would see before it all went dark. </span>

  <h1 align="center">
  <span>CHAPTER 42 The Premier</span>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio held Agatha’s hand in the back of the car that was taking them to the premier. Rio whispered quiet promises about how Agatha looked beautiful and that she would do great. They had done another practice shoot with Alice to simulate the photos taken on the red carpet, but Rio knew that the practice would pale in comparison to the chaos and the people that would be shouting your name to get a photo for their publication. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There would be videos taken and screaming fans that wanted a photo or autograph. She watched as they pulled up, the press for their show had generated a larger crowd than she had thought imaginable. Her skin tingled under the anticipation, wishing she could take Agatha far away from here. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In her mind she sighed, this was Agatha’s big night, just as much as hers. Her love deserved this. Rio had seen the way they marketed the show, and although Rio was the main character, somehow, Agatha got more promo shots displayed and was larger on the billboards, dwarfing her. She loved her partner, but wished things were different. People would definitely be a bit confused when they tuned in and the story focused on Rio, but she knew the key to success was doing whatever it took to get people to watch. What was important was that they got a second season and she got more time to craft worlds with her fiancé.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>How weird that was still, her </span>
  <em>
    <span>fiancé</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Rio had secretly always hoped she would find someone, but never thought it would actually happen. Agatha had been a whim, an impulse she couldn’t stop. There was just something about her that drew Rio in and kept her utterly obsessed. She reached out to adjust her lover’s hair and Agatha blushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, I’m such a mess.” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes shifted behind her. “Just smile and wave. Take a few photos if you are ready to, and don’t let them see you sweat.” She leaned forward and kissed Agatha hard as the driver moved around the car to open the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes were wide as she chased Rio’s retreating lips a moment later. “You get the rest when we get inside… we’ll find somewhere.” Her eyes looked up at the man and nodded before looking back at Agatha… “Now go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned as the door opened before her, she panicked and turned back, showing her back to the crowd. “Wait, do we tell people that we’re… Do I keep this on?” She held up her hand indicating her ring. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile was bright. “Well, I didn’t buy it for you to remain your dirty secret.” She nodded, winking. “Go let them know you're taken.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha beamed and turned to exit the car, not taking the man’s hand as she did, and surprising Rio when she turned back and took Ro’s hand and helped her from the car. Rio surprised herself by keeping their hands together as they walked the carpet. She led the way, taking photos and pulling Agatha with her to take photos with a few fans, many wanting photos with both women together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They took turns doing their single shots in front of the cameras and Rio waited for Agatha with an outstretched hand when she was done. “Good job.” She pulled her inside and towards where the bathrooms were hidden in the back of the house. She had luckily been to this venue before. Rio’s voice lowered. “Now you get your reward.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha relaxed when it was a single room. The door locked with a click and Rio checked the sink before she lifted her partner and hiked Agatha’s dress up, quickly slipping her silk thong to the side. Agatha’s head hitting the mirror behind her with a force that Rio thought might cause a headache to appear, but Agatha pressed her hips forward into her fingers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, baby, </span>
  <em>
    <span>please</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I’ve been so good.” Her voice a low whine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked as she bent down, her makeup be damned, she had brought some to reapply for a reason. Her face dove between her fiance’s thighs, Agatha groaning at the contact.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, Rio!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The raven-haired woman bobbed her head, playing with her pressure. They didn’t have a lot of time, but she wasn’t going to rush this, the start of the viewing be damned. She licked up Agatha’s juices as she became lost in the feeling, forgetting where they were, until Agatha’s hand moved into her hair and pulled, as she came hard into her mouth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio welcomed the rush of fluid as she tried to lick Agatha clean. Knowing she didn’t need to be dealing with a wet dress the rest of the night, though, thankfully, they were both wearing long dresses with sheer black tooling over dark blue. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was breathing hard as she whimpered at her overstimulation. Rio knew she was sensitive so she went slow. She moved to grab some toilet paper when Agatha started to shake, knowing the other woman would be a mess if she kept going. When she appeared with the tissue Agatha took it gently and cleaned Rio’s mouth and chin first before moving to clean herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your makeup is still flawless… goddess bless Jen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio blushed. “I wouldn’t mind if it wasn’t.” She smirked. “That was worth it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifted, wincing as she continued to clean herself up. After Rio helped her off the sink, Blue eyes looked at Rio expectantly. “How long do I have to… take care of you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “It’s so cute that you think I didn’t come already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes were wide.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “You’re really hot. It does things to me when you enjoy yourself that much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m touching you when we get home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio lit up. “Promise?” She winked before she checked herself over in the mirror. She turned to adjust Agatha’s hair. “Perfect.” She shifted and opened the door, luckily no one was waiting for them. She took her woman’s hand and guided her back to the theater. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They chatted briefly with Sharon Davis on the way in and the woman held a sneaky smile. “So what did you girls think of the script?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both women started on a jumbled, but passionate, review of the artistry of the script. Both admiring how raw and deep with emotion the piece was able to go. Sharon’s face couldn’t have been happier. She was practically bouncing on her feet when she looked at Agatha. “The table reads did just the trick, Harkness! I’ve got my eye on you for producing one day. I’m going to need talent like that in my corner for future projects.” She smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That would be wonderful… but honestly, Rio is the one that gave me the idea. She really has the creative eye for process.” Agatha offered softly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes widened as Agatha gave her credit. Sharon turned her gaze to the star of her show. “Well, Miss Vidal, it seems we have some work ahead of ourselves for you as well. You did a great job with the protagonist. I must say, I see why Agatha sings your praises. Ash said you adjusted a few things with the choreo and I must say, I loved how personal and intimate it felt.” Her eyes lingered on Rio’s ring finger where it was wrapped around Agatha’s waist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are we just friends, or do I spy something on that finger, Miss Vidal?” Her blue eyes casting a not so sneaky glance at Agatha’s hand and smirking when she saw a ring on her finger as well. A purple amethyst surrounded by small diamonds sparkling away as it caught the lighting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “I had to have her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sharon nodded. “Ah, and how did we meet? I assume you already knew her if you were ready to barter for her involvement in this project?” She addressed Rio but then her eyes also slid to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha wasn’t sure what she was allowed to say, so she looked at Rio, hopeful that she would take the lead and the woman did.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was an interview I did actually. I saw Agatha and I just, had to know more.” She blushed lightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sharon patted Rio’s shoulder. “You have an eye for talent indeed, my dear.” The lights flickered and they assumed Sharon Davis would take her seat, but she turned back to them excitedly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not really telling anyone this, but… I wrote this piece.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both women’s jaws hit the floor. Rio stumbled. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>You…</span>
  </em>
  <span> you’re serious?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sharon smirked and nodded. “I drew from my own experiences with women, and from my dear husband and his experience with men.” She looked behind her as she saw the MC wave her over. “Oh drat, I have to go give a little speech. I will be chatting with you two later.” She pointed at them. “You better both be available for a second season, I heard whispers in the wind that I am going to finance it.” She shrugged. “Just don’t get too busy.” As she turned to leave, Rio turned and practically jumped into Agatha’s arms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Baby! Oh my gods, did we just get another job?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled, knowing that while another credit to her body of work would be great, she had already won by securing Rio in her future. “I’m thrilled, honey.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled back, a smile permanently on her face as she sat to watch the first episode, her hand playing with Agatha’s the whole time. As the lights dimmed, Rio’s face came on screen, larger than life, and Agatha was projected back to the same feeling she got every time this woman’s face came on screen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She would devote the rest of her life so that this woman knew how special and precious she was. She couldn’t believe that Rio had pursued </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span>, but she wasn’t going to take any of it for granted. As she sat there in the theater, with her own face coming up on screen, she tried to lose herself in the story so she wouldn’t cringe nor critique herself too hard for the choices she had made.</span>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <span>The flashback was steamy. Agatha was blushing and </span>
  <em>
    <span>hot</span>
  </em>
  <span> for the rest of the premier. Wishing desperately that they didn’t need to stop at the after party, so she could just take Rio home and undress her. But this was Rio’s night in the spotlight and she would help her shine as brightly as she could, because not only did she love her but Rio fucking deserved it. </span>
