<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“I want to devour you,” Rio whispered. “I want you to scream my name until the walls collapse. I want to fuck the control out of you.”</p><p>Agatha shivered – but didn’t give in.</p><p>She ran one hand down her stomach, teasing herself just enough to let her breath hitch, watching Rio’s restraint crumble molecule by molecule.</p><p>“Next time,” Agatha said, using her finger still slick with her arousal to lift Rio’s chin. “When I want you to taste… when I want you to fuck me… I’ll ride your mouth like a throne.”</p><p>She stepped back, leaving Rio on her knees, ruined and breathing hard.</p><p>And smiled like sin incarnate.</p><p>“But not tonight.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello! I feel like we needed the dark romance mafia au vibe with these two. The darkness of their original characters in the show (minus nicky) I feel should be explored more. Please let me know what you think in the comments!!</p><p>Also I HIGHLY HIGHLY you suggest you listen to the song in that scene😘</p><p>Enjoy:)</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The corridor to the audition room throbbed red, like the inside of a body. Shadows clung to the walls. The lightbulbs flickered, not from faulty wiring but as if protesting her heartbeat. Everything here breathed with hunger – slow and patient.</p><p>Agatha walked the hall with the precision of someone trained to kill ad conditioned to seduce. Evry click of her hells was a choice. Every swing of her hips, rehearsed.</p><p>She was twenty-five. A legacy hunter with a spine of steel and a dagger sewn into her thigh-high boot.</p><p>But tonight, she was <em>Raven</em> – wide-eyed, honey-voiced, and ready to bare herself before the monsters.</p><p>The Coven didn’t pretend to be anything other than what it was – a den. Its reputation was whispered in hushed tones even among seasoned hunters. It was both a lure and lair. A stage for girls who though they were the main act, unaware they were meat in mascara.</p><p>Agatha knew better.</p><p>She knew what the club was.</p><p>And she knew who owned it.</p><p>Agatha had grown up on stories of the Originals – vampires so old they no longer bled, who slept in cities built beneath cities, who watched the world pass like empires made of mist.</p><p>
<em>Rio.</em>
</p><p>That was the name whispered in hunter circles, always in warning. No photos. No known aliases. Just a sigil once carved into the heart of a corpse that took three hunters to kill, and none of them survived long enough to explain what it meant.</p><p>
<em>Do not engage. Do not enter her territory.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio.</em>
</p><p>The name tasted like smoke and sin. The oldest of them. The one her mother warned her about in stories that ended with open throats and bodies found drained, smiling.</p><p>She hadn’t seen Rio yet.</p><p>But she could feel the presence of her.</p><p>The velvet curtain moved with a whisper.</p><p>“Name?” asked the woman with the clipboard, eyes like a hawk’s.</p><p>“Raven.” Sultry. Smooth.</p><p>“Experience?”</p><p>“Private clubs. Underground circuits. European mostly.” Lies, all of them.</p><p>The woman didn’t blink. She motioned toward the stage. “Whenever you are ready.”</p><p>The platform was small – a perfect circle under a single overhead light. The pole rose like a dagger from the center. The rest of the club beyond it was drowned in darkness. It was a void, velvet-wrapped, lined with unseen watchers. Probably the club’s management.</p><p>Agatha felt them. One in particular.</p><p>The air shifted – a quiet stretch of silence.</p><p>Then the music started.</p><p>Something slow and throbbing. The kind of bass that kissed bone. A song that wasn’t meant to excite but <em>consume.</em></p><p>Agatha stepped into the light. She didn’t start with movement. Not right away. She stood there. Let the light paint her curves. Let the darkness <em>watch.</em></p><p>She could feel a gaze – just one. Heavy. Cold. Patient. It curled around her ankles, dragged up her thighs, slipped like a breath beneath her ribs.</p><p><em>You’re here,</em> she thought.<em> Good.</em></p><p>Agatha moved – not rushed, not flashy. Her hips swayed side to side, a lazy roll like honey sliding down a spoon. She raised her arms slowly, letting her fingertips drag over her collarbones, down the sides of her waist, before gripping the pole with deliberate reverence.</p><p>She didn’t look like a girl trying to impress.</p><p>She looked like a woman who was born to wield seduction.</p><p>One hand lifted, fingers looping the pole. She arched, spine bowing like a feline. She let her hair fall forward, lips parted just slightly. The lights kissed her skin – warm amber on pale shoulders, carving the way her toned body moved with an unmatched elegance.</p><p>Halfway through the arc, she locked her thighs and flipped herself upside down. Her body stretched long – arms above her, back curved, one leg split high in the air, toes pointed like a prayer. She slid halfway down, stopped short, and held.</p><p>She didn’t look at the room. She looked at the darkness.</p><p>And then she smiled.</p><p>The kind of smile that said <em>I know you are there.</em></p><p>The kind of smile that said <em>Come and get me.</em></p><p>She descended, rolled to her knees, and crawled to the edge of the light – hips swaying, hands delicate, each move so slow it bordered on obscene. Her eyes marked the face of someone sitting up front, everybody’s jaws on the floor as she held the eye contact.</p><p>Her back arched. She dragged her palms up her thighs, over her stomach, between her breasts, finally touching her own neck.</p><p>That’s when it happened.</p><p>A chill slid down her spine like ice, kissing the back of her skull.</p><p>The room didn’t get colder – she did.</p><p>Her skin raised.</p><p>That presence, the one she’d sensed since the music began, <em>leaned in</em>.</p><p>Closer now. A breath away. Closer than it had any right to be.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, involuntarily. Her hands stilled at her collarbone. Her neck bared like an invitation.</p><p>She exhaled slowly. Shifted again.</p><p>Knees apart. Back arched. Arms stretched above her as if to offer herself. Her hips rolled – slow, deep, arching. The motion rode the music, not just with rhythm but with <em>intention.</em> She wasn’t just dancing.</p><p>She was <em>summoning.</em></p><p>A low chuckle floated from the shadows – soft and rich, the low timbre doing something to Agatha she would never admit.</p><p>She didn’t freeze. She didn’t even blink. Instead, her eyes rose. Staring into the darkness, reading it as she continued.</p><p>She dropped onto her side and curled, legs folding like a ballerina’s, one arm under her head, the other brushing her mouth.</p><p>The song wound to a close.</p><p>Agatha lay there, still.</p><p>Breathing.</p><p>Flushed.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>No applause. Just silence so thick it was a presence itself.</p><p>Then: “Not bad,” said the woman with the clipboard standing up from the audience. Her voice came like a whip snapping her out of the spell.</p><p>Agatha pushed herself up. Swung her legs over the edge of the stage. Her knees wobbled, but her face was cool.</p><p>“Do I pass?”</p><p>The woman nodded once. “You’ll start Friday. Stage two. Get here an hour before open. 9 sharp.”</p><p>Agatha offered a slow, appreciative smile, like she hadn’t just danced on a razors edge.</p><p>As she stepped down, the sensation behind her returned – heavier this time.</p><p>Someone unseen had step closer. Past the curtain. Past the rules.</p><p>The darkness <em>watched</em> her walk away.</p><p>She didn’t turn around. But her body felt the gaze like a heat that hadn’t touched her yet – lingering where she glowed under the light. The back of her thighs. The slope of her spine. The pulse in her neck.</p><p>“You moved like you know who’s watching.” A voice behind her said – dry, amused, and too clear for the hazy red hallway.</p><p>Agatha turned slightly.</p><p>The speaker leaned against the mirrored wall, arms crossed, lips painted wine dark. She was tall and feline, all lazy posture and sharp bone structure. Her reflection lagged by a breath – just enough to make Agatha’s skin crawl.</p><p>The girl arched an eyebrow. “That was either brave or suicidal.”</p><p>Agatha gave a faint smile. “As long as it gets me hired.”</p><p>The woman smirked, unimpressed. She stepped forward, boots soundless even on the tile, and offered a hand tipped in matte-black nail polish. “Jen.”</p><p>“Raven.” Agatha replied, shaking it.</p><p>Jen’s eyes flicked down, taking her in again – not the way men watched dancers, but like she was cataloguing something dangerous. “You don’t look like the others.” She spoke. “Most girls come in here trying to act sexy. You came in like your name was next to the word in the dictionary. You own the room.”</p><p>“I was just playing the part.”</p><p>“That wasn’t a performance.” Jen said, head tilted. “That was provocation.”</p><p>Agatha held her gaze. “Did it work?”</p><p>Jen’s expression didn’t change, but something in her posture did – a subtle shift, like she was remembering to be careful.</p><p>“Oh, it worked.” She said softly. “Now you’ve got her attention.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach tensed. “Her?”</p><p>Jen didn’t blink. “Don’t play dumb. You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t already know what this place is.”</p><p>A silence settled between them – not quite hostile but charged.</p><p>“She’ll want to see you soon.” Jen added. “Up close.”</p><p>“I look forward to it.” Agatha said.</p><p>Jen gave her a once-over, as if testing the weight of the answer. “You shouldn’t,” she said, and started walking away.</p><p>Then she paused at the end of the corridor. “You’re not afraid, are you?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was steady. “No.”</p><p>Jen didn’t smile/ She turned her head enough for Agatha to see the sharp edge of her cheekbone in profile.</p><p>“Good,” she said. “It’s more fun that way.”</p><p>Then she vanished around the corner.</p><p>Agatha stood alone, the dim hallway suddenly too still. She could still feel that gaze – not Jen’s. The <em>other </em>one. Heavy. Cold. Curious.</p><p>She walked the rest of the hall toward the dressing room. Her heels clicked with careful rhythm. Her heartbeat didn’t speed up until the door clicked shut behind her.</p><p>Only then did she sit, beneath a tarnished mirror that distorted her shape just enough to feel wrong.</p><p>She started into, breath steady, jaw clenched.</p><p>No one stood behind her.</p><p>And yet – the linger she stared the more she felt it.</p><p>
<em>You were seen.</em>
</p><p>Not by Jen. Not by the clipboard woman.</p><p>But by <em>her. </em></p><p>
<em>Rio.</em>
</p><p>By the one Agatha came here to find.</p><p>
<strong>One Month Later</strong>
</p><p>Despite everything whispered about The Coven – the disappearances, the monsters cloaked in flesh, the impossibly old owner no one had ever seen clearly – the place ran with military precision and the cleanliness of a five-star resort.</p><p>No blood on the floor. No drama backstage. No feeding without consent.</p><p>The bouncers were faster than they looked. The private rooms had cameras, even if no one ever saw them. And the staff – dancers, barbacks, coat-check, everyone – was treated with reverence that bordered on religious.</p><p>It was a predator’s den, yes.</p><p>But the dancers?</p><p>They were royalty.</p><p>Agatha, especially.</p><p>A month in, <em>Raven </em>wasn’t just a stage name anymore – it was a brand. Her face was on the digital flyers. Her schedule was booked weeks out. Mortals lined up just for the chance at a lap dance. Vampires did too, but they kept their distance.</p><p>Because she wasn’t like the others.</p><p>She was fire wrapped in silk. Danger in 7 inch-heels. And even if no one could quite name it, every monster who watched her dance felt it – that something beneath the surface. That shadow in her smile.</p><p>No one touched her unless invited.</p><p>And no one ever was.</p><p>She’d learned the rhythm of the club fast – the way the floor pulsed when the crowd surged, the scent of magic that came of the bar’s absinthe in waves, the hum of eyes from above that didn’t blink like human ones.</p><p>She felt <em>her</em> sometimes, the club’s owner.</p><p>The presence that lingered like thunder before a storm.</p><p>
<em>Rio.</em>
</p><p>Agatha had never seen her close. Not fully. A glimpse of a silhouette behind a tinted window in the balcony suite. A cold awareness when she danced that told her something old was watching her with interest too still to be human.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed as she sat at her usual mirror in the dancer’s lounge. She tightened the strap of her garter and checked the shine of her boots. Everything was in place. Everything in place. Everything perfect. Her face, a painted weapon, her body wrapped in black lace and onyx crystals like the prize of a dark altar.</p><p>She could feel the other girls watching her – some admiration, some with jealousy, most with both. She didn’t care. She hadn’t come here to make friends.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Jen appeared beside her, as always, like smoke drifting in from a private fire.</p><p>“You really are a menace.” Jen said, leaning one hip against the counter, arms crossed. “Do you ever tire of destroying everyone’s ego?”</p><p>Agatha gave a soft, amused snort without looking up. “If it’s that easy to destroy, it wasn’t worth much.”</p><p>Jen arched a brow. “That’s exactly the kind of thing <em>she</em> would say.”</p><p>Agatha paused her lipstick. “Who?”</p><p>Jen didn’t take the bait. She just smirked and said, “Your fan on the balcony.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair. “Still watching?”</p><p>Jen nodded. “Always. Same time every week. Same suite. Same glass of untouched wine.”</p><p>“She doesn’t drink it?”</p><p>“Not that I’ve seen.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Then why order it?”</p><p>Jen’s eyes glinted. “Because sometimes it’s not about the drink. Sometimes it’s about the ritual.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, another voice cut in – lower, with a musical rasp that clung to the air.</p><p>“She’s talking about <em>Her Majesty</em> again?” a redhead asked as she sauntered across the room in platform boots that made her legs look a mile long. “Jesus, Jen, do you get paid extra to whisper about her like she’s Dracula dominatrix?”</p><p>Agatha glanced up.</p><p>The woman – Wanda – was tall and curvy, with hair the color of fresh blood and a face too expressive to belong to someone sane. She dropped into the chair beside Agatha and proper her hells on the counter, unapologetically loud and impossible to ignore.</p><p>“Wanda.” Jen drawled. “Jealousy’s not a good color on you.”</p><p>“Please.” Wanda smirked. “If I wanted the balcony’s attention, I’d get it. But I like to keep my neck intact.”</p><p>Jen turned to Agatha. “Wanda’s one of our long timers. Legend, really.”</p><p>“And modest too.” Wanda chimed in.</p><p>“I’d say she’s seen it all, but…” Jen paused, gaze flicking to Agatha’s reflection in the mirror. “You’re something new.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “New doesn’t mean better.”</p><p>“No.” Wanda said thoughtfully. “But <em>dangerous</em>? That’s another story.”</p><p>Agatha met her eyes. “You think I’m dangerous?”</p><p>“I think you’re being watched very closely,” Wanda said. “And she doesn’t watch lightly.”</p><p>Jen cut in. “You’ve got the midnight slot. Full house.”</p><p>Agatha turned back to the mirror and smoothed a curl behind her ear. “I assume the balcony’s reserved?”</p><p>“Of course it is,” Jen said. “Same as always.”</p><p>Wanda whistled. “Damn. You’re about to make all the girls obsolete.”</p><p>“I’m not here to compete.” Agatha said.</p><p>“No,” Jen murmured, “you’re here for something else.”</p><p>Silence dripped like a velvet curtain. Even Wanda didn’t quip this time.</p><p>Agatha stood slowly, her presence shifting the air like perfume.</p><p> </p><p>The music started with a low pulse, like the hum of something sleeping just beneath the floorboards.</p><p>Agatha waited behind the curtains, breathing slow, centered. Er hands rested on her thighs, fingertip just grazing the dagger she kept sewn into her garter. A relic, silver lined. Not that she’d ever needed to use it.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>The velvet parted.</p><p>The spotlight was already waiting for her – sharp, soft-edged, like moonlight filtered through the smoke.</p><p>Agatha stepped into it.</p><p>Every step was deliberate. Every inch of her body curved in worship of the silence. The audience barely dared to breathe.</p><p>Above her – far above, in the shrouded balcony box – a silhouette moved. Just once. Barely more than a flicker.</p><p>But Agatha <em>felt</em> it.</p><p>Her.</p><p>The hair on her arms stood up.</p><p>She reached the center of the stage and paused. Let them look.</p><p>Her costume glittered – black and bone-hugging, sheer where it needed to be, defiant where it didn’t.</p><p>The music deepened – strings now, and something pulsing steady as a heartbeat.</p><p>Agatha placed a hand to the pole like she was greeting a lover, then turned and twisted into a slow climb, muscles stretching, skin gleaming. She lifted herself until the world narrowed to the feeling of tension and control – then let go and spun downward in a slow spiral.</p><p>The crowd didn’t cheer. They watched. Hypnotized.</p><p>She landed low, legs spread, hands dragging over her thighs. Her head rolled back. Her eyes stayed half-lidded, never meeting theirs.</p><p>She wasn’t dancing for them.</p><p>
<em>She never was.</em>
</p><p>A hand slid into her hair. She tilted her head, lips parted, breath shallow – but she wasn’t undone.</p><p>She was laying the bait.</p><p><em>Come closer,</em> she thought. <em>I’m ready now.</em></p><p>She moved with more purpose now, a slow grind that moved up her spine and down through the line of her hips. The stage lights caught the sharp edges of her smile – hungry, knowing, controlled.</p><p>She dropped again, landed on her knees, back arched so far, the light painted the whole line of her neck.</p><p>Up in the balcony, the figure stood.</p><p>Only for a moment.</p><p>Then vanished.</p><p>But not before Agatha felt it – deep in her blood.</p><p>Contact.</p><p>No words.</p><p>No face.</p><p>But for the first time, the attention on her wasn’t passive.</p><p>It reached for her.</p><p>Claimed her, just for a second.</p><p>As the music ended, Agatha knelt at the center of the stage, hair hanging over the one shoulder, chest rising and falling.</p><p>She stayed there for one beat. Two.</p><p>Then stood – slow and regal – and turned her back on the crowd.</p><p>Because it wasn’t about them.</p><p>It never had been.</p><p> </p><p>The envelope hadn’t been there a minute ago.</p><p>But now it sat neatly on her vanity – black matter paper, sealed in deep red wax. A serpent coiled into the shape of an eye stamped on front.</p><p>Agatha didn’t touch it right away.</p><p>She didn’t have to. The message was already clear.</p><p>
<strong>You’ve been summoned.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>The room swallowed sound.</p><p>No music. No crowd. No glitter.</p><p>Only velvet-draped walls, obsidian candleholders, and the scent of roses that had bloomed too close to something dead. The candles flickered low, casting gold over black satin and shadows. It smelled like blood under perfume. Like something holy turned indecent.</p><p>In the center of the room sat a chair – tall-backed, throne-like.</p><p>And it in, the woman masked in silk.</p><p>She was still as a statue, legs crossed, hands resting lightly on the arms of the chair. She didn’t speak. Didn’t move. But the air pulsed around her like something alive.</p><p>Agatha stepped into the room without hesitation. Closed the door behind her without looking back.</p><p>She could feel it immediately. <em>This </em>was the mystery woman.</p><p>Not just the presence. The gravity.</p><p>Every hair on her arms stood on end.</p><p>She smiled slowly. “Bit theatrical,” she said, voice languid, amused. “Are you always like this, or is this special treatment?”</p><p>The masked woman didn’t answer at first.</p><p>Then – so low it felt like it bloomed inside Agatha’s chest –</p><p>“I thought you like theatrics,” She murmured. “You perform like someone who wants to be seen.”</p><p>That voice.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched before she could stop it.</p><p>It wasn’t just beautiful – it was <em>designed</em> to unravel. Warm. Deep. Smooth as satin across bared skin, with the kind of restraint that promised it wouldn’t stay gentle long.</p><p>Agatha licked her lips, composed herself, and stepped further into the room.</p><p>She didn’t go to the chair.</p><p>She circled it.</p><p>Slowly.</p><p>Heels clicking faintly on velvet-soft floors, like a countdown. Like a warning.</p><p>“You always sit like that?” She asked lightly, “Like you’re waiting for a meal to seduce itself?”</p><p>A quiet laugh followed her – low and knowing.</p><p>“If I were hungry, you’d already know.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile curved wicked.</p><p>So, it is her.</p><p>She passed behind the chair, then to the other side. Closer now. Close enough that the hem of her sheer robe ghosted along the tips of Rio’s polished shoes.</p><p>“But you summoned me,” Agatha said, voice dipping. “That’s not hunger?”</p><p>“It’s curiosity.”</p><p>“You want to see if I’ll dance for you.” Agatha paused just behind Rio’s shoulder, lowering her mouth toward the curve of her ear. “Or if I’ll bite first.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>A shift in air pressure.</p><p>Then Rio’s voice again, lower than before.</p><p>“I already know how you’ll taste.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled – quiet and sharp.</p><p>She moved in front of her at last. Slow. Deliberate.</p><p>But she didn’t sit.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Instead, she leaned down and placed one hand on each armrest of the chair, boxing Rio in without touching her. Her chest hovered inches from the woman’s knees, her mouth a whisper away from Rio’s covered jaw.</p><p>“You always hide behind masks,” Agatha said, watching her like a cat watches a twitching mouse. “Or am I just special?”</p><p>“You’re different,” Rio replied. “Most girls come here to be wanted. You came here to <em>be recognized</em>.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Is that what you see?”</p><p>“I see a hunter with blood under her nails and silver on her thighs.”</p><p>She still hadn’t moved.</p><p>Still hadn’t touched her.</p><p>But the stillness was deliberate. Tense.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>Agatha leaned closer; her voice honeyed now. “You know what they say about women like me?”</p><p>Rio said nothing.</p><p>Agatha’s smile deepened. “That we’ll let you think you’re winning… right until we pull your spine out.”</p><p>This time, Rio’s breath left her softly, like a laugh made of smoke.</p><p>“That’s what I like about you,” she said. “You threaten me like you want me to enjoy it.”</p><p>Agatha slowly straightened up. Turned. :et her rob slip from one shoulder. Just a glimpse. A warning.</p><p>She stepped between Rio’s knees at last.</p><p>Still not sitting.</p><p>Still not dancing.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>“Maybe I want to see how long you’ll sit there,” she murmured, “letting me lead.”</p><p>“Maybe I am letting you.” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha smirked.</p><p>“Letting me?” she echoed. “You think I don’t see you gripping the arms of your chair like if you touch me, you’ll ruin the taste by rushing it?”</p><p>Another flicker of amusement behind the mask.</p><p>“You’re clever,” Rio said.</p><p>“I’m deadly,” Agatha corrected, leaning down, her mouth grazing the edge of silk. “And bored.”</p><p>Rio inhaled slowly – sharp and steady.</p><p>“Then dance.”</p><p>Agatha paused.</p><p>Stared at her.</p><p>Then – finally – she turned around. Lowered herself backward into Rio’s lap, slow and heavy like smoke pouring into a glass.</p><p>She didn’t grind.</p><p>She rolled.</p><p>She didn’t pant.</p><p>She exhaled like sin made breath.</p><p>Her back arched. Her hands skimmed over her own waist, her chest. Every inch of her moved with control, grace, intention.</p><p>She made herself something to <em>crave. </em></p><p>But she never looked at Rio again.</p><p>Until –</p><p>Rio shifted.</p><p>Just slightly.</p><p>And Agatha smiled like a woman who had struck oil.</p><p>She leaned in, lips near her jaw.</p><p>“Is this what you wanted.” She breathed. “Something alive. Something you didn’t make.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“I wanted to see what you’d do.” Rio said softly. “If I didn’t touch you.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head.</p><p>And whispered, “Coward.”</p><p>That’s when Rio moved.</p><p>Her hand – controlled and precise – brushed lightly along Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>And her other hand lifted to her mask.</p><p>She peeled it back.</p><p>Agatha looked.</p><p>And stopped breathing.</p><p>Rio peeled off the mask with the kind of grace that said she was used to people waiting for her.</p><p>The black silk slipped away, and Agatha’s whole body went still.</p><p>That face.</p><p>It wasn’t just beautiful – it was <em>devasting</em>.</p><p>The kind of beautiful that made you forget what language was. High cheekbones carved with impossible precision. Full, sensual lips painted a color darker than blood. Tanned skin that looked like it would be golden in the light. Silky brown hair that fell loosely around her. And eyes – oh God those eyes – obsidian at the center, rimmed with a warm brown and framed by lashes that had no right being so soft on a creature so sharp.</p><p>She looked like sin wrapped in skin. Like a cathedral turned carnivorous.</p><p>She looked <em>exactly</em> like the kind of mistake Agatha did not willing come here to make.</p><p>Agatha parted her lips to speak, to joke, to regain control.</p><p>But then Rio moved.</p><p>No warning.</p><p>Her hand slid up Agatha’s thigh – <em>bare</em>, smooth, and warm. Too warm.</p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath, spine stiffening at the sensation.</p><p>“You’re warm.” She murmured, almost accusingly.</p><p>Rio’s smile was slow and satisfied. “You expected cold.”</p><p>“I expected…” Agatha faltered as fingers dragged higher, stopping at the bare skin above her garter. “… something less… human.”</p><p>“I’m not human,” Rio said. Her thumb traced the sensitive skin inside Agatha’s thigh, just a whisper of pressure. “But I’ve always liked wearing the illusion.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to move. Wanted to shift the balance.</p><p>But Rio was already leaning in, one arm sliding around her waist to draw her close –<em> closer</em> – until their bodies touched, hips to chest, nothing between them now but breath and heat and rising tension.</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply. “I didn’t say you could touch me.”</p><p>Rio’s lips brushed the edge of her jaw, the corner of her ear.</p><p>“You didn’t say I couldn’t.”</p><p>Her voice was warm smoke, curling around Agatha’s ribs like a promise and a trap. Her other hand slid up Agatha’s spine, fingers splaying over the small of her back. Her touch wasn’t demanding. It was precise. Possessive.</p><p>And it made Agatha tremble.</p><p>She hated how easy it was for Rio to feel it.</p><p>“You think I’m going to fall apart for you?” Agatha whispered trying to sound dangerous.</p><p>Rio’s nose skimmed her cheek. Her mouth hovered over Agatha’s jaw, breath threading over skin like silk.</p><p>“I think,” Rio said quietly, “you already are.”</p><p>Then her hand moved – down, guiding Agatha’s hips forward, dragging her slowly into a grind against the center of Rio’s lap.</p><p>Agatha gasped.</p><p>Heat flared across her face and chest, her breath catching as her hips moved again – not on command. On <em>instinct</em>.</p><p>Rio smiled.</p><p>There it was.</p><p>The break.</p><p>Agatha tried to speak, but Rio cut her off – not with a kiss, not yet.</p><p>With a soft whisper against her throat.</p><p>“You came here with knives,” she murmured. “Now you’re shaking on top of me like you forgot how to hold them.”</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw.</p><p>She rolled her hips again, slower now, grinding against Rio’s thigh, using the motion to reclaim something, anything.</p><p>But Rio didn’t let her.</p><p>Her hands took control – bare, warm, firm – sliding to Agatha’s waist, gripping it, guiding the rhythm.</p><p>“You like control,” Rio said, her lips ghosting the curve of Agatha’s throat. “You wear it like a costume.”</p><p>Her teeth grazed skin sharp and accurate – not biting, no fangs. Just <em>showing them</em>.</p><p>“And I like watching you take it off.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. Her fingers tightened around Rio’s shoulders, nails digging into flesh.</p><p>“You think you know me?”</p><p>Rio’s voice dropped to something sinful. “I know you are wet.”</p><p>Agatha shuddered.</p><p>Rio’s hand slid under the sheer fabric at her hip, palm across the curve of her ass now, <em>pulling </em>her down, right against the heat building between them.</p><p>“You want to be worshipped,” Rio murmured. “But only by something that could destroy you.”</p><p>Agatha’s head dropped to Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“Fuck.” She breathed.</p><p>“Not yet.”</p><p>Rio tilted her face up by the chin, just one finger beneath her jaw. “Look at me.”</p><p>Agatha obeyed.</p><p>Her eyes glassy. Her lips parted. Her body – aching, caught, trembling.</p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“I want you to remember this part,” She whispered. “The moment you stopped performing. The moment you started <em>feeling</em>.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t move.</p><p>Could barely breath.</p><p>And Rio didn’t press any further.</p><p>She just held her there – bare hands-on bare skin, eyes dark and unreadable.</p><p>There was a soft knock at the door that broke the spell.</p><p>Someone was coming.</p><p>Rio still instantly, hands dropping from Agatha’s waist in a motion so fluid it could’ve been premeditated. She straightened in the chair, cool and collected, as if she hadn’t just had Agatah grinding in her lap like a woman ready to be devoured.</p><p>Agatha stumbled off her.</p><p>Literally <em>stumbled</em>.</p><p>Her knees buckled slightly when her feet hit the floor, and her robe slipped halfway down her arms, leaving her half-bared chest heaving, skin flushed like she’d been fucking her instead of dancing.</p><p>Rio extended a hand, steadying her before sitting back in her chair, crossing one leg over the like a queen after a sacrifice.</p><p>There was another knock.</p><p>A pause.</p><p>Then the door creaked open.</p><p>One of the floor managers – Alice, maybe – peeked in.</p><p>“Apologies,” She said smoothly, “Ma’am, your 1am appointment has arrived.”</p><p>Agatha barely registered the words. She was already backing up.</p><p>Already burning.</p><p>Already breaking into pieces.</p><p>Rio’s voice came low and smooth behind her.</p><p>“Send them in.”</p><p>Agatha turned to look at her – and regretted it immediately.</p><p>That face.</p><p>That fucking face.</p><p>Satisfaction, restraint, and something cruelly tender resting behind her stillness. Like she’d known exactly how this would end. Like she wanted it too.</p><p>Agatha shook her head. Her chest ached.</p><p>No.</p><p>She had to leave.</p><p>She yanked her robe back over her shoulders, wiped her mouth even though no one had touched it, and fled the room like something was chasing her.</p><p>Maybe it was.</p><p>The dressing room door slammed behind her. Agatha pressed her back to the wall just inside, trying to breathe. It didn’t work.</p><p>She could still smell Rio on her skin. Still feel her bare hands, warm and firm, still hear that voice wrapped around her name like silk and fangs.</p><p>Her pulse thundered in her ears.</p><p>She’d come with a plan. She was supposed to seduce, tease, manipulate. Get close.</p><p>Not melt.</p><p>Not <em>grind</em> on her.</p><p>Not <em>nearly come</em> from the sound of her voice.</p><p>She slammed a fist against the wall.</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>“Woah.”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up.</p><p>Jen stood across the hall near the emergency exit, wide-eyed, holding a cigarette she’d clearly forgotten to light.</p><p>“Jesus, are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Just pushed off the wall, fists clenched, trying to walk straight.</p><p>Jen’s eyes followed her, widening when she saw the state of her.</p><p>Hair mussed. Robe half-wrung. Skin flushed. Chest still rising and falling like she’d run ten flights of stairs.</p><p>“Oh shit,” Jen said softly. “She fed on you?”</p><p>Agatha stopped.</p><p>“No,” she snapped.</p><p>Jen blinked. “Wait. No? Not even a taste?”</p><p>Agatha turned to her. “Would I be walking out here on my own if she had?”</p><p>“No, I mean…” Jen stepped closer, voice dropping. “She <em>let you leave</em>?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply.</p><p>Her jaw clenched. Jen looked genuinely rattled now. She lowered her voice even further, eyes flicking back toward the VIP door.</p><p>“She’s never like that. Ever. I’ve worked here two years, Agatha. That woman doesn’t summon anyone. She doesn’t touch anyone herself. If she calls a dancer in, it’s for termination… or whatever else, but it’s fast. Impersonal.”</p><p>Agatha stayed quiet.</p><p>Jen kept going. “She’s never watched someone like that. Not even Wanda. And Wanda has practically served herself up on a silver platter.”</p><p>Agatha flinched. She hated how much those words cut.</p><p>She hated how much she wanted <em>more</em>.</p><p>Jen stepped back, giving her space now. Her voice softened.</p><p>“Hey. You’re okay.” She said, “Seriously. You’re okay.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands were still trembling. She didn’t tremble.</p><p>She looked down at them like they belonged to someone else.</p><p>“She didn’t even kiss me,” Agatha whispered, and instantly hated that she said it.</p><p>Jen blinked.</p><p>“…You wanted her to?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>She turned and stormed down the hallway, muttering curses under her breath, needing distance. Needing cold air. Needing a blade in her hand and a reason to be angry that wasn’t lust.</p><p>But she even as she stalked down the hallway, she still felt it.</p><p>The weight of Rio’s hands on her hips.</p><p>The brush of her breath against her throat.</p><p>The sound of her voice whispering her name like a sin worth savoring.</p><p>And worst of all –</p><p>The fact that Rio hadn’t taken anything from her.</p><p>No blood.</p><p>No kiss.</p><p>Just a look that said, <em>Next time you’ll beg</em>.</p><p>Agatha steeled her resolve.</p><p>She’d make Rio beg.</p><p>
<strong>One Week Later</strong>
</p><p>“You broke the floor,” Jen said tossing a towel over Agatha’s shoulder like a coach after a prizefight. I saw a man choke on his cocktail.”</p><p>Agatha laughed breathlessly and ran the towel along her collarbone, skin still humming with adrenaline.</p><p>“I hope he tipped well.”</p><p>“He tipped,” Wanda purred from the chaise lounge. She was nursing a neat glass of absinthe and watching Agatha like she was a dessert she hadn’t decided how to eat yet. “They all tip when it’s you. The stage barely has time to cool in between sets.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and flopped into her chair, unhooking one heel. “You’re just mad I get your best booths now.”</p><p>“I’d be madder if it wasn’t so fun to watch,” Wanda said, rising with a stretch that made her corset creak. She wandered closer and leaned down, brushing hair from Agatha’s shoulder with too-gentle fingers. “You ever think about pairing up?”</p><p>“For a set?”</p><p>Wanda’s voice dipped, playful, “Or more.”</p><p>Jen made a strangled noise from the lockers. “Okay, let’s not fuck on the powder counter. Again.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, but Wanda’s hand stayed just a second too long on her neck.</p><p>“You’d like it.” Wanda whispered.</p><p>“I’d like the tips.” Agatha murmured back, but her eyes were watching herself in the mirror not Wanda.</p><p>She saw it again – the flush that hadn’t left her chest since Alice’s clipboard made its quiet announcement.</p><p>Room Four.</p><p>Her first private assignment.</p><p>Wanda and Jen were still bantering in the background when Alice stepped into the room like she always did – gaze lingering on Jen.</p><p>“Agatha. Lilia wants a word before your session.”</p><p>“Session?” Jen arched a brow.</p><p>Alice just smiled. “Room Four.”</p><p>Jen whistled.</p><p>Wanda’s brows rose. “She pulled you?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, grabbing her bottle with a hand that didn’t quite shake.</p><p>“She assigned you someone,” Jen said, walking over and lowering her voice. “She never does that before you’ve been working for 6 months.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head. “High rollers or high risks. Or both.”</p><p>“I’m not worried,” Agatha said, standing. “I’ve handed worse.”</p><p>She meant it.</p><p>But her stomach still twisted as she stepped into the corridor.</p><p> </p><p>The air I this part of The Coven always felt different.</p><p>Thicker. Quieter. Like sound itself knew to behave here.</p><p>Agatha walked the corridor with her usual prowl – hips loose, shoulders back, mouth still smudged from lipstick she hadn’t bothered to fix. Her robe hung low on her arms, exposing enough skin to raise any temperature.</p><p>She was almost at the door.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Until the scent hit her first.</p><p>Not perfume.</p><p>Not blood.</p><p>Her.</p><p>Agatha slowed.</p><p>Then stopped.</p><p>Rio stepped out from the shadows like she never left them. Her dark blouse was half-unbuttoned, her hair slicked back into a tight bun, shadows curling at the edges of her body like obedient wolves. No guards. No entourage. Just her presence. Enough to command gods.</p><p>Agatha didn’t blink. “So,” She said, voice silk-wrapped steel, “you do still exist.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curved faintly. “I never stopped.”</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know.” Agatha said, starting to walk again, slow ad predatory, like she was circling prey. “You vanish for a week, ignore every set I headline, and then suddenly appear the night I get my first private VIP dance?”</p><p>She stopped just in front of Rio. Her mouth curved wickedly.</p><p>“Let me guess,” she whispered. “Jealous?”</p><p>Rio raised a brow. “You think I’d waste envy on mortals?”</p><p>Agatha reached up and brushed something off Rio’s collar that wasn’t there. Her fingers lingered – light, unbothered. “Only the ones I dance for in your club. In your chairs.”</p><p>Rio’s hand moved as if to catch hers – but Agatha pulled back first, deliberate and smug.</p><p>“You could’ve staked your claim,” Agatha said. “But you didn’t. Now someone else gets me in a private room. Must burn a little.”</p><p>Rio said nothing, but the silence sharpened. Darkened.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, mouth brushing just beside Rio’s jaw. “Or maybe it’s not jealousy,” she murmured. “Maybe it’s regret.”</p><p>Rio’s voice dropped low, husky. “For what?”</p><p>“For letting me slip between your fingers without tasting me first.”</p><p>The air between them crackled.</p><p>“I know it’s been centuries since you’ve had a taste. The girls talk.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed darker – just briefly, like an eclipse passed through her.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t retreat.</p><p>“You have a millennium.” She said softly. “I have youth. Hunger. Heat. And an audience that worships me.”</p><p>She tilted her head. “Still think I’m just a mortal?”</p><p>Rio’s voice was velvet smoke. “I think you enjoy provoking ancient things.”</p><p>“I think ancient things need to be reminded they can still be provoked.” Agatha shot back.</p><p>She leaned closer again – this time pressing a kiss just beneath Rio’s jawline. Not sweet. Not soft.</p><p>A claim.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>It was tiny. Almost invisible.</p><p>But Agatha saw it.</p><p>And smiled.</p><p>“Someone else is waiting for me,” She whispered. “You had your chance.”</p><p>She pulled back, turned on her heel, and walked down the corridor like she owned it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heels made no sound on the velvet carp, but her heartbeat echoed in her chest like thunder.</p><p>Room Four was unlike any other VIP suite in The Coven.</p><p>No gaudy mirrors. No gold trim. No cheap thrills.</p><p>This room was pure stillness.</p><p>It felt like a chapel long abandoned. Velvet-lined walls in wine and charcoal, furniture draped in shadow, candles flickering like gasps. The only light came from a chandelier that hung low, like it was eavesdropping.</p><p>And in the center of it all – was a man.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>He sat on the fainting couch, arms stretched across the back like he’d been waiting far too long. Mid-40s, fit, dressed like wealth trying to look causal. No visible weapons. But Agatha knew how to clock a shoulder rig when she saw one.</p><p>He didn’t rise when she entered.</p><p>He just looked at her like she was both a threat and a question.</p><p>“You’re not what I expected,” he said.</p><p>Agatha let the door swing shut behind her. “I usually aim higher than that for a first line.”</p><p>His mouth twitched, but not in amusement. He reached into his coat – slow, telegraphed – and pulled out a silver coin. Flipped it once. Let the light catch on a symbol that made her stomach tighten.</p><p>The mark of the Order.</p><p>Agatha’s spine straightened. Her pulse spiked – but she didn’t show it. Didn’t move, didn’t blink.</p><p>The man let the coin fall back into his hand and tucked it away.</p><p>“So,” he said quietly. “You’re the legacy.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Her fingers curled slightly at her sides.</p><p>He tilted his head. “We’ve been watching. You’re popular. Almost too popular.”</p><p>She walked towards him slowly. “If you came here to slut-shame, you’re in the wrong room.”</p><p>“I came here to remind you why you are here.” He said, voice cooling. “You think we approved this op so you could get off grinding on the oldest thing this side of hell?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched into something colder than a smirk. “That ‘thing’ is Rio Vidal. You don’t seduce an apex predator by handing her a crucifix and a fucking memo.”</p><p>The man’s jaw tightened. “You’re playing with fire.”</p><p>“I know exactly what I’m playing with,” Agatha said, stopping just in front of him. “The point is to get close. Closer than anyone. That’s how we find her cracks.”</p><p>“Assuming she has any.”</p><p>“Oh, she does.” Agatha’s voice dropped. “I’ve seen the way she looks at me.”</p><p>The man didn’t flinch, but something flickered in his eyes.</p><p>“You think that gives you power?” he asked. “You think she won’t gut you the moment you stop being useful?”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer. “That’s why I’ll never stop.”</p><p>“Don’t mistake attraction for leverage.” He snapped. “That woman’s been alive since the stars first sang. You think you can outmaneuver that?”</p><p>“I don’t have to,” Agatha replied cooly. “I just have to make her believe I can.”</p><p>For a moment, neither of them spoke.</p><p>Then the man stood, suddenly far too close.</p><p>He lowered his voice. “You’re the only hunter that has gotten this close. The others…”</p><p>“I know.” Agatha said, her voice like a blade. “I read the reports. Blood in hotel bathtubs. Ash in silk sheets.”</p><p>“Then why are you smiling?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, meeting his stare without blinking.</p><p>“Because she wants something she can’t have.”</p><p>He stared at her, searching for the girl behind the confidence. She didn’t let him find it.</p><p>Finally, he nodded.</p><p>“We’ll be in touch,” he said, and stepped toward the private door that exited discreetly into a back stairwell.</p><p>He paused at the threshold.</p><p>“If she starts to unravel you…”</p><p>“She won’t.” Agatha snapped.</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p>The silence that followed was absolute.</p><p>Agatha stood alone in the center of the room. Her body still humming from Rio’s voice in the hallway, her skin too hot under her robe. She could deal the trap closing in from both sides.</p><p>The Order wanted her to crack Rio open.</p><p>Rio wanted to crack her in half.</p><p>And she had just the idea on how to bait her into doing it.</p><p>
<strong>The Next Night</strong>
</p><p>The mirror lights flickered like candle flames, catching the sheen of sweat already starting to pearl at Agatha’s collarbone.</p><p>She ran a hand slowly up her thigh, adjusting the sheer black garter belt that hugged her hips like a promise. Her robe hung open, nothing beneath it but a bodysuit made of shadows and illusion. On her lips, a red so deep it bordered on black.</p><p>And behind her Wanda was getting dressed.</p><p>The redhead stood by her own mirror, clad in silver that hung to her body like it had been poured. Her long legs gleamed, her hair an unruly flame pulled into a high twist.</p><p>Agatha watched her reflection for a moment.</p><p>Then she turned.</p><p>Deliberate and unhurried.</p><p>“Do you ever get tired of being the second-most dangerous woman in the room?” she asked, voice velvet-wrapped sin.</p><p>Wanda didn’t even blink. “Depends. Who’s the first?”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, dragging her fingers lightly down her own collarbone as if making a point. “Me.”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “Arrogant.”</p><p>“Honest.”</p><p>Their eyes locked.</p><p>The space between them thickened.</p><p>Wanda tilted her head. “You’re hunting something tonight.</p><p>“I’m always hunting,” Agatha murmured, trailing one finger up Wanda’s arm. “But tonight… I want to be devoured.”</p><p>Wanda leaned into the touch. “You’re always devoured.”</p><p>“Not like this.” Agatha stepped behind her now, letting her fingers graze Wanda’s ribs as she leaned in, mouth brushing the shell of her ear. “I want to put on a show.”</p><p>Wanda shivered under her touch. “A solo?”</p><p>“A duet,” Agatha purred, “I want you with me.”</p><p>Wanda turned, slowly, their bodies brushing. “Trying to make someone jealous?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes gleamed. “That would just be a bonus.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled low, eyes raking down Raven’s frame. “Why me?”</p><p>“Because you know how to touch without breaking.” Agatha’s voice dropped. “And you look like temptation when you take control.”</p><p>Wanda’s breath hitched just slightly.</p><p>Agatha leaned in further, lips grazing the edge of her jaw. “I want to writhe in your lap and let the whole damn house think we’re going to fuck. I want to feel your hands around my throat while a certain someone watches from the dark and pretends to be uninterested.</p><p>Wanda’s fingers dug into Agatha’s hips now, firm and curious. “You always get what you want, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Only if I ask nicely.”</p><p>“Is this you being nice?”</p><p>“It’s me inviting you to play.”</p><p>Wanda exhaled like she’d been holding her breath.</p><p>Then she grinned, sharp and wicked. “What are we wearing?”</p><p>“Lace and nerve.”</p><p>“And the music?”</p><p>“Something slow. Filthy.”</p><p>Wanda nodded once, lips brushing Agatha’s jaw just barely. “You’re going to start a war.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back; pupils blown wide. “Then you better dance like you want to survive it.”</p><p>Wanda laughed, breathless. “God, I love when you’re feral.”</p><p> </p><p>The house lights dropped. The velvet curtains trembled.</p><p>A hush fell across the club – like everyone in the coven had been punched breathless at once. Then the beat started.</p><p>Slow. Sinister. A heartbeat drenched in heat.</p><p>The Crazy in Love Remix began to slither through the speakers – moody, hypnotic, dripping with decadent sin.</p><p>And then they emerged.</p><p>Agatha, all shadow and silk, took the lead. Her robe floated behind her like smoke clinging to fire. Her heels struck the stage with lethal grace, every step made to command. She moved like a woman carved for worship – bare legs catching the blue light, leather bodysuit laced to expose without surrendering. She looked like a hymn turned profane.</p><p>Wanda followed.</p><p>Silver and sin.</p><p>Hair in a scarlet crown. Boots like weapons. Her movements slower – measured – like she was stalking something she already owned.</p><p>The crowd didn’t cheer. They gasped.</p><p>The anticipation clung to the air like perfume.</p><p>And above it all – Rio watched.</p><p>From her high balcony in the shadows, body half-draped across the velvet like a predator disinterested in the feast, her eyes glinted like obsidian set in fire.</p><p>Raven didn’t look up.</p><p>But she felt her.</p><p>That presence. That pull.</p><p>It dragged across her skin like invisible claws.</p><p>The song growled low as Agatha dropped to her knees before Wanda.</p><p>Not submissive. Intentional.</p><p>A dark offering.</p><p>Wanda gripped a fistful of Agatha’s hair, tilting her head back. The crowd moaned.</p><p>But Wanda wasn’t looking at Agatha.</p><p>She was staring at Rio.</p><p>And smirking.</p><p>Her hips rolled forward, pressing against Raven’s mouth, miming what they weren’t quite doing – yet. Agatha’s hands slid up her thighs, possessive and slow, then lower again, wrapping around Wanda’s calves like a worshipper claiming a god.</p><p>Onstage, they looked like they were fucking.</p><p>Because they were.</p><p>Just with their eyes, their hands, their rhythm – every touch staged but saturated with heat.</p><p>The music pulled tighter.</p><p>Agatha rose, twisting up Wanda’s body like a serpent, curling behind her, chest flush to her back, hips rolling in sync.</p><p>Wanda leaned her head to the side, baring her throat. Agatha’s mouth hovered just above it – teasing.</p><p>Agatha didn’t bite.</p><p>She licked.</p><p>The crowd gasped.</p><p>Wanda laughed.</p><p>And locked eyes with Rio.</p><p>A challenge in every blink.</p><p>

<em>Because I do.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And she’s wrapped around me like she’s read to burn.</em>
</p><p>Agatha turned her face upward – just slightly – until she found Rio’s silhouette above.</p><p>And then she smiled.</p><p>Slow. Dangerous. Direct.</p><p>As if to say, <em>Come and take it baby.</em></p><p>Wanda slammed Agatha against the pole.</p><p>Agatha arched up into it, gasping, one leg wrapped around Wanda’s hip, riding her thigh with every bass beat like she was close – too close.</p><p>Wanda gripped her throat lightly and whispered something against her ear the crowd would never here. “Gods Agatha, I might just strip you bare on this stage.”</p><p>Agatha’s answer was a breathy, feral laugh – like flame on alcohol.</p><p>She twisted in Wanda’s arms, letting herself be turned, bent forward, pulled up again – all smooth, coiled motion. Every inch of her moved with intention.</p><p>And every time her hips rolled her hands slid low; she looked at Rio.</p><p>As if pulling her in. Daring her.</p><p>
<em>Touch me.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Claim me.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prove you can.</em>
</p><p>Wanda circled her like a queen devouring the stage, only to drop low and let her tongue trace the air an inch from Agatha’s inner thigh. She didn’t make contact, not really – but the crowd screamed.</p><p>Agatha’s head dropped back; lips parted. Her body shuddered like she’d been kissed by lightning.</p><p>She locked eyes with Rio again.</p><p>
<em>You watching this?</em>
</p><p>
<em>You still pretending your above this?</em>
</p><p>Wanda straddled her from behind now, chest to her back, grinding slow and punishing. Their hands intertwined over Agatha’s chest like lover’s mid-climax.</p><p>Agatha turned her head. Her lips brushed Wanda’s jaw but didn’t kiss.</p><p>Wanda moaned anyway.</p><p>The lights pulsed red and gold.</p><p>Agatha dropped again, this time on all fours, crawling toward the center stage like a lioness in heat. Wanda followed, dragging her up by the hair and into a kiss that didn’t quite land. Their lips hovered – close enough to burn.</p><p>The music clawed toward climax.</p><p>Raven spun with Wanda in a brutal rhythm, colliding into her body like a tide with nowhere else to crash. She let Wanda press her to the stage floor, one thigh between her legs, their mouths centimeters apartment.</p><p>Wanda bucked her hips once – hard.</p><p>Agatha moaned.</p><p>And Rio flinched.</p><p>Not visibly.</p><p>But enough.</p><p>Enough to make Agatha grin against the floor.</p><p>Enough to make her roll her hips in reply.</p><p>Wanda leaned in, lips brushing Agatha’s ear. “She’s going to kill me.”</p><p>Agatha answered, “Then fuck me like you want to be resurrected.”</p><p>Final beat.</p><p>They rose like goddesses from flame.</p><p>Wanda turned Agatha and slammed her against the pole again, this time lifting her – Agatha’s legs wrapped around her, her body flush to pale skin, their mouths<em> almost</em> touching as they spiraled once more.</p><p>Then –</p><p>Blackout.</p><p>Both women dropped to their knees, Agatha’s head falling against Wanda’s shoulder, Wand’s hand pressed between Agatha’s thighs as if claiming territory.</p><p>The crowd erupted.</p><p>Bills flew like feathers.</p><p>And above it all –</p><p>Rio sat like stone.</p><p>But her eyes…</p><p>Her eyes burned like she’d been fed fire.</p><p> </p><p>The curtain dropped. The house thundered.</p><p>Agatha barely felt the floor beneath her heels as Wanda dragged her down the back stairs, both laughing, breathless, glowing. Her pulse hadn’t settled. Her thighs ached in the best way. She could still taste Wanda’s perfume, feel the memory of Rio’s eyes like a touch on her spine.</p><p>They burst into the dressing room, the door swinging wide with force and heat.</p><p>“Holy fuck.” Wanda gasped, flopping onto the velvet chaise lie she’d just finished something much dirtier than a dance. “You were about to come on my boot.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, catching her breath as she peeled her thigh-highs down, one slow drag at a time. “I think I did. Sorry about the patent leather.”</p><p>The girls looked up from their makeup stations and all but howled.</p><p>“Oh my God,” Natasha said, flicking her cigarette out the cracked window. “That wasn’t dancing. That was borderline criminal offense.”</p><p>“That was visual penetration.” Valkyrie declared, twirling a lipstick between her fingers like a dagger. “My girlfriend the bartender texted me mid-performance to ask if she should leave. She thought she was interrupting.”</p><p>Agatha laughed; breath still ragged. “You’re welcome.”</p><p>Wanda gave a mock bow, blowing kisses. “We accept tributes in cash or orgasms.”</p><p>Jen walked in, lollipop in between her lips and a too-knowing glint in her eye. “You two just brought in more money in six minutes than the bar has pulled since New Year’s.”</p><p>Wanda winked. “You’re welcome for <em>that </em>too.”</p><p>Jen crossed her arms, gaze jumping from Wanda to Agatha. “You sure you weren’t trying to get someone killed up there?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, all faux innocence. “Whatever do you mean?”</p><p>Jen’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t play. We all saw you making love to the stage while staring into the balcony shadows like they owed you a blood debt.”</p><p>“She couldn’t look away,” Wanda added smugly, unzipping her boots with a satisfied sigh. “Your vampire queen was frozen up there like a statue with blue balls.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She shrugged off her robe, heat still crawling across her bare shoulders. “She doesn’t own the stage.”</p><p>“No,” Jen said pointedly. “But she sure as hell looked like she wanted to own you.”</p><p>“That set was <em>filthy,</em>” Natasha declared, curling onto the floor like a cat basking in the sin. “I haven’t been that turned on in ages.”</p><p>“I feel like I should smoke a cigarette,” Valkyrie added. “And I don’t even smoke.”</p><p>Wanda leaned over toward Agatha, voice dipped low and teasing. “You sure she’s not going to call you up tonight and fuck the soul out of you?”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, lips brushing Wanda’s ear as she murmured, “Why baby, you jealous?”</p><p>And that’s when the door creaked open.</p><p>Not slammed. Not flung.</p><p>Just a slow, careful creak.</p><p>The room stilled.</p><p>Like prey scenting a predator.</p><p>Rio stepped inside.</p><p>She wore black from throat to heel, a silhouette of midnight and menace. Her hair fell in loose waves, and her lips – painted the color of fresh blood – were drawn into a line of quiet fury.</p><p>She didn’t scan the room.</p><p>Didn’t blink.</p><p>Her gaze went directly to Agatha.</p><p>And stayed there.</p><p>The silence cracked like thunder.</p><p>Then:</p><p>“Out.”</p><p>Just one word.</p><p>Low. Commanding. Laced with something ancient and sharp.</p><p>Everyone moved.</p><p>No one questioned.</p><p>Natasha grabbed her cigarettes. Valkyrie didn’t even pause to collect her lashes. Wanda hesitated, just long enough to glance at Agatha with something bordering on concern – but even she slipped out with a flounce.</p><p>Only Jen lingered.</p><p>“Boss,” she started. “We good or…”</p><p>Rio didn’t look at her. “Out Jen.”</p><p>Jen didn’t argue.</p><p>The door clicked shut behind her.</p><p>The dressing room was quiet now.</p><p>Too quiet.</p><p>The scent of sweat and perfume lingered, heavy and sweet. Agatha turned slowly to face her; the hum of tension tight against her ribs.</p><p>Rio stood like judgement made flesh.</p><p>Unflinching. Unreadable.</p><p>But her hands were at her sides, clenched just slightly.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up right away.</p><p>She heard the door click, felt the shift in the air, and smiled to herself in the mirror.</p><p>“You finally get the courage to say hello outside of passing in a hallway?”</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Of course not. Rio never rushed the game.</p><p>Agatha reached up, twister her hair into a knot, exposing the long line of her throat.</p><p>Purposefully.</p><p>A dare.</p><p>When she turned, Rio was already halfway across the room.</p><p>Stillness in motion.</p><p>Dark hair falling loose over her shoulders, black shirt unbuttoned at the collar like temptation had gotten tired of pretending it wasn’t danger.</p><p>Agatha dragged her gaze from head to toe, slow and biting.</p><p>“Didn’t think I’d see you again,” she said, arms crossed, legs bare where her robe had slipped open. “Did you get bored or just jealous?”</p><p>Rio said nothing.</p><p>Only took another step.</p><p>Agatha leaned back against the vanity like a lounge chair, lips curled.</p><p>“Oh, that’s it,” she drawled. “You saw me on stage. Wrapped around Wanda like sin and glitter, and now you’re spiraling.”</p><p>Still, Rio didn’t react.</p><p>Didn’t speak. Just watched her with those eyes – black and bottomless, a storm barely tethered.</p><p>Agatha shrugged one bare shoulder. “It’s okay. Jealousy’s a normal reaction to realizing you’re not the center of the universe.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, slow and feline. “You think you’re clever.”</p><p>“I know I am,” Agatha shot back. “What I don’t know is why you’re standing there like you haven’t already decided whether you want to fuck me or bleed me dry.”</p><p>Rio’s voice, when it finally came, was like silk over steel.</p><p>“Who says I haven’t decided both?”</p><p>Agatha’s blood burned.</p><p>Still, she didn’t let it show. She stepped forward instead – one, two, until they were toe-to-toe.</p><p>She leaned in, deliberately letting the edge of her robe brush Rio’s thigh.</p><p>“Is that your thing?” she whispered. “Drag girls into the dark, strip them down, leave them begging, then vanish like some moody Victorian ghost?”</p><p>Rio’s gaze dipped to her lips. “You didn’t beg.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha murmured, “but I think you want me to.”</p><p>And finally – finally – something shifted.</p><p>A flicker.</p><p>A fracture.</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched, her hands twitching at her sides. Her control – lengendary, perfect, centuries old – shivered.</p><p>Agatha saw it.</p><p>And smiled like a goddamn devil.</p><p>“Poor thing,” She murmured, brushing the collar or Rio’s shirt with one finger. “Must be exhausting watching me twist around another woman while you sit up in your balcony doing shady business and watch like a good little voyeur.”</p><p>Rio moved.</p><p>Fast.</p><p>Inhumanely fast.</p><p>One hand slammed against the vanity beside Agatha’s head.</p><p>The other fisted on her robe, yanking her body flush against her own with bruising precision.</p><p>“You think I won’t tear this room apart?” she growled, voice wrecked velvet. “You think I won’t bend you over this mirror, <em>actually fuck you</em>, and make you forget every name but mine?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered – but she smirked through it, teeth flashing.</p><p>“So, you do speak.”</p><p>Rio’s grip tightened.</p><p>Her thigh shoved between Agatha’s, pressing upward until her breath hitched again, hips twitching without permission.</p><p>“I should let you keep pretending,” Rio hissed, mouth at her neck, fangs scraping against skin, “Keep playing queen in your little court of glitter and smoke. But then you come in here, stinking of another woman’s perfume, and look at me like I’m just one more name in the dark.</p><p>Agatha gasped – half at the words, half from the strong thigh flexing between her legs.</p><p>“You’re not just one more name,” she breathed. “You’re the mistake I’ll crawl back into hell for.”</p><p>Rio groaned – guttural, deep – and shoved her harder against the vanity.</p><p>Her hand tangled in Agatha’s hair. Not gentle.</p><p>“You want a reaction?” she snarled. “You want me to lose control?”</p><p>Agatha moaned as teeth grazed her throat, as Rio’s free hand slid under the open slit of her robe and palmed the curve of her thigh.</p><p>“No,” she whispered. “I want you to snap.”</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Rio kissed her.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>Like a damnation.</p><p>Like she meant to drag Agatha under and never let her up again.</p><p>Their mouths collided, violent and unrestrained, bodies smashing together with the kind of hunger that had nothing to do with blood and everything to do with want.</p><p>The vanity rocked.</p><p>Glass rattled.</p><p>Agatha arched up, grinding against her leg, biting back a scream as Rio’s hand slid up – too hot, too firm, too much – claiming every inch she touched.</p><p>“You mouth off like you’re in control,” Rio growled.</p><p>“I am,” Agatha purred back, nails clawing at Rio’s shoulders through her shirt.</p><p>So did Agatha.</p><p>Her body pinned between Rio and the vanity, legs parted around the vampire’s thigh, one hand tangled in silk sheets of hair, the other braced against polished wood. Her robe hung open and she was bare underneath – barely clinging to one shoulder, exposing sweat-kissed skin and the racing pulse at her throat.</p><p>Rio’s lips dragged down her jaw, her throat, her collarbone. Kissing wasn’t even the right word. It was closer to consumption – a worship twisted in torment.</p><p>“You talk like you’ve got me on my knees,” Rio breathed against her sternum. “But you’re the one dripping for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s hips bucked at the truth of it.</p><p>“Maybe I like putting on a show,” she rasped. “Maybe I want you to watch me fall apart.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m not watching. Rio’s voice dipped into smoke, her hand sliding up Agatha’s inner thigh, dragging slow and deliberate over the slick heat between her legs. “I’m orchestrating it.”</p><p>Agatha moaned – sharp and helpless – and Rio grinned like the predator she was.</p><p>“That’s right,” she whispered. “You dance for them. But you break for me.”</p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha gasped.</p><p>Rio kissed the words from her mouth. Rough. Demanding. Possessive.</p><p>“You want to.” She said it like a command, not a question. “Say it.”</p><p>Agatha tried to resist – but her hips told a different story, grinding into Rio’s hand, chasing more, chasing ruin.</p><p>“Say it,” Rio murmured again, her thumb brushing tight circles over her, fingers pumping shallowly, only teasing and never giving enough.</p><p>“You think you’re the one seducing me?” She purred. “You think I haven’t dreamt about tearing that little stage persona off you like paper?”</p><p>Agatha moaned as Rio slid three fingers into her – hot and slow, like she was savoring every reaction.</p><p>“You wear control like a costume,” Rio said. “But your body knows who owns it.”</p><p>Agatha’s legs trembled.</p><p>She bit her lip to keep from screaming.</p><p>“You’re soaked,” Rio whispered in her ear. “And we’ve barely started.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand clawed at the back of Rio’s neck, pulling her hair tighter, lips catching hers in a kiss that tasted like surrender and blood and power tangled together.</p><p>The mirror had fogged. The vanity shook behind her. But it wasn’t enough.</p><p>Agatha’s blood throbbed in her ears like a drumbeat, hips slick and trembling around Rio’s fingers. Her breath came in ragged bursts, skin flushed from chest to throat.</p><p>But the moment she felt Rio start to dip lower – mouth hovering like a promise above her thighs – Agatha snapped.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>She pushed.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>Caught off-guard, Rio stumbled back – barely – but the shock of it showed in her eyes. Like she had never been denied before.</p><p>And Agatha used the split second to advance. One hand pressed to Rio’s chest, the other grabbing her shoulder, she shoved her down to her knees like commanding a monster to heel.</p><p>Rio dropped – graceful even in her fall but burning more than ever.</p><p>A slow dangerous smile touched her lips as she looked up.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t smile.</p><p>She stepped forward, spreading her legs slightly, letting the robe fall completely open now. Exposing skin flushed, glistening, desperate.</p><p>And just as Rio reached for her hips – hungry, eager, worshipful –</p><p>Agatha planted her heel on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>A warning.</p><p>A claim.</p><p>A throne.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Her head tilted slightly, lashes lowering, but she didn’t move again.</p><p>Not until she was told to.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her like a goddess’s who had finally caught the devil and found her unimpressive.</p><p>“Did I say you could taste?” she murmured, voice a velvet whip.</p><p>Rio inhaled slowly.</p><p>Her hands were still at her sides, muscles taught beneath her skin. Her pupils were blown wide, mouth parted, every inch of her screaming restraint.</p><p>“I thought you like games,” She rasped, voice lower than ever. “I’m playing.”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, her hand tangling in Rio’s hair, tilting her head back to expose her throat.</p><p>So warm.</p><p>So wrong.</p><p>So, wanting.</p><p>She bit down. Hard. Hard enough that it would have drawn blood on anyone but the immortal. Rio nearly buckled at the feeling, growling in response.</p><p>“You like pretending you’re the one in control,” Agatha said, her breath ticking Rio’s lips. “You think because you’ve lived for centuries that I should kneel?”</p><p>She dragged her heel down Rio’s shoulder, over her chest, leaving a smear of heat in its path. The pressed it lightly, against her sternum.</p><p>“I don’t kneel. I don’t submit.” She whispered. “I make monsters beg.”</p><p>Rio growled softly – but stayed still.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Agatha leaned down slightly moving her leg, so it was over Rio’s shoulder bringing her slick heat, so it hovers just above Rio’s mouth but never touched.</p><p>“<strong>Say it</strong>.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes burned into hers.</p><p>“<strong>Say you want a taste.</strong>”</p><p>“I want to devour you,” Rio whispered. “I want you to scream my name until the walls collapse. I want to fuck the control out of you.”</p><p>Agatha shivered – but didn’t give in.</p><p>She ran one hand down her stomach, teasing herself just enough to let her breath hitch, watching Rio’s restraint crumble molecule by molecule.</p><p>“Next time,” Agatha said, using her finger still slick with her arousal to lift Rio’s chin. “When I want you to taste… when I want you to fuck me… I’ll ride your mouth like a throne.”</p><p>She stepped back, leaving Rio on her knees, ruined and breathing hard.</p><p>And smiled like sin incarnate.</p><p>“<strong>But not tonight</strong>.”</p>

<strong>Rio’s POV</strong>
</p><p>She’s gone.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>One heel clicks, one smug little smile, and Raven – no that couldn’t be her real name – vanished behind the dressing room door like she hadn’t just ripped Rio apart from the inside out.</p><p>Rio stayed there.</p><p>On her knees.</p><p>Hands clenched at her sides, chest rising and falling in tight, measured inhales. She wasn’t panting – vampires didn’t pant. But she was close. Closer than she had been in more than a thousand centuries.</p><p>Centuries she had walked this world, watched empires rise and rot, watched kings beg and killers burn.</p><p>But this <em>mortal</em>?</p><p>This 25-year-old blade in glitter and lace?</p><p>She had stopped Rio with a heel to the chest and a voice like a challenge carved in obsidian.</p><p>
<strong>“Did I say you could taste?”</strong>
</p><p>The words still echoed.</p><p>They lived in her bones now.</p><p>Rio hated –<em> hated</em> – how much her body still throbbed with the ghost of them.</p><p>How slick the heat still was in the air, how hard her fangs ached against her lips from the scent of arousal she hadn’t earned.</p><p>Her own.</p><p>And Raven’s.</p><p>
<em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>Raven’s scent lingered on her hands, her skin, her <em>mouth</em>.</p><p>That scent – sweet, spiced sweat and hot mortal want – clung to Rio like an offense she didn’t know how to absolve.</p><p>She should’ve moved. She should summon a drink or a victim or a distraction.</p><p>But she stayed there.</p><p>On her knees.</p><p>
<strong>What have you done to me?</strong>
</p><p>No one had ever spoken to her that way.</p><p>Not with that smirk. That certainty. That body pressed against hers like worship wrapped in violence. Not with a hand in her hair and a voice whispering, “Did I say you could taste?” Like a leash around her throat.</p><p>Her body still hummed from where Raven had bitten her.</p><p>She had ruled kingdoms. Burned cities. Turned saints into shadows and shadows into servants.</p><p>But she had never been handled like <em>that.</em></p><p>Her jaw clenched.</p><p>She could still feel the tension of Raven’s heel on her chest, that perfect balance of power. Rio could’ve broken it, of course. Could’ve taken her – flipped her, fucked her into the floor, tasted every inch she wanted. She was older than empires. Her strength was legend.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>She’d obeyed.</p><p>Sat there on her knees like a beast at heel, eyes locked on the mortal who knew <em>exactly</em> how to command her.</p><p>Not because she was weak.</p><p>Because Raven had earned it.</p><p>And that was the most dangerous part.</p><p>Not the infatuation. Not the obsession. Not even the hunger.</p><p>It was… <em>recognition</em>.</p><p>She didn’t just want Raven. She saw her. Under the glitter and teasing and bravado, she saw the flame of something terrifying: purpose.</p><p>Raven hadn’t come here to just dance.</p><p>She had come here to dismantle her.</p><p>And Rio was going to figure out who she was and why.</p><p>Gods help them both.</p><p>
<strong>Agatha’s POV</strong>
</p><p>The second the door closed behind her, Agatha pressed her hands to the cool brick of the hallway wall and exhaled like she’d been holding her breath underwater.</p><p>Her pulse was thunder.</p><p>In her throat. In her wrists. Between her legs.</p><p>She hadn’t meant to go that far.</p><p>She hadn’t meant to go in at all.</p><p>
<em>What the hell was that?</em>
</p><p>She dragged a breath, but it didn’t help. Her lungs felt bruised. Her skin itched, electric from the heat of Rio’s touch – <em>her knees, her hands, her voice</em> – and her own traitorous response to every inch of it.</p><p>This wasn’t the plan.</p><p>It had seduced her. Kill her. Bring her head back to the Organization.</p><p>She wasn’t supposed to want her.</p><p>She wasn’t supposed to <em>grind on her lap like a fucking offering and then make her kneel like a sinner.</em></p><p>“Goddamn it,” she hissed, shoving herself off the wall. This wasn’t about Rio.</p><p>Get in. Get close. Get her to trust you.</p><p>Uncover what the others couldn’t.</p><p>Only now, every time she closed her eyes, she didn’t see a monster. She saw Rio’s mouth opening around a plea. She felt <em>want</em>, not wickedness. <em>Restraint</em>, not threat. <em>Heat</em>, not the cold.</p><p>She’d stripped that vampire down to her barest form – and instead of recoiling, she wanted to taste it.</p><p>She pushed into the dancer’s bathroom like a firestorm, fingers twitching. Her reflection caught her before she could avoid it – robe crooked, chest flushed, hair mussed like she’d just come backstage from a midnight tryst.</p><p>Not the mission.</p><p>Not the kill.</p><p>A sin.</p><p>“Fuck me.” She muttered.</p><p>She needed to get redressed and back out onto the floor.</p><p>Gods help her.</p><p>
<strong>Two Nights Later</strong>
</p><p>The dressing room was thick with perfume and smoke, mirrors swimming in golden bulbs throwing soft halos over half-dressed bodies. Agatha sat at her station, brushing out her hair, her expression carved in porcelain coolness – though inside, her pulse still tripped.</p><p>Rio had vanished.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Two nights since she had put her on her knees in front of this very desk Agatha was working at. Since that voice curled around her like silk and sin.</p><p>And now – silence. Again.</p><p>“She’s gone again,” Wanda remarked, sprawled on the vanity next to Agatha’s, lazily lacing her thigh-high boots pointed, feline smile. “Our ghost queen disappears as fast as she arrives.”</p><p>Jen, lounging nearby as she touched up her eyeliner, let out a sharp breath. “Maybe she’s finally gotten bored.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing, but her fingers tightened slightly on her brush...</p><p>Bored? No.</p><p><em>Ancient coward</em>? Yes.</p><p>“She doesn’t get bored,” Wanda added, eyeing Agatha with a slick flick of her lashes. “She gets <em>hungry. </em>And when she does…” Wanda’s mouth curved slowly, meaningfully. “Well. You know.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed, but she didn’t raise to the bait.</p><p>Wanda grinned wider, delighted. “Still no sign of her?”</p><p>“Maybe she’s dead,” Jen muttered dryly, flipping her makeup compact closed with a snap. “One can hope.”</p><p>“Please.” Wanda snorted, leaning back in her chair, crossing her legs with deliberate, sultry grace. “That woman’s older than the dirt under this club. She’s not going anywhere until she wants to.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth quirked slightly, though her chest still ached with something heavier, sharper.</p><p>Then –</p><p>The door swung open.</p><p>Lilia entered.</p><p>Every woman in the room went still.</p><p>Because Lilia never came downstairs unless it was serious.</p><p>She was elegance personified – dressed deep blue velvet, her silver hair twisted into a crown, eyes dark and unreadable as she surveyed them with the weight of a queen weighing pawns.</p><p>“Raven.” She said first, voice cool as steel under silk.</p><p>Agatha straightened instinctively, ever nerve going taut.</p><p>Wanda’s brows lifted, curious now.</p><p>Jen simply froze, watching.</p><p>But Lilia didn’t stop there.</p><p>“You. Wanda. Jen.” Her gaze flickered between them, sharp and expectant. “You’re wanted upstairs.”</p><p>That made the air snap.</p><p>Wanda blinked. “Upstairs? As in the <em>VIP wing</em> upstairs?”</p><p>Lilia’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. “That’s what I said.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach knotted.</p><p>Even she – new as she was – knew what upstairs meant.</p><p>The VIP wing wasn’t for dancers. It was for clients throwing bills for private dancers. It was for… business. Dangerous business. Deals forged in blood and shadow. Rumors swirled that bodies disappeared on that floor.</p><p>And Rio ruled her kingdom from there.</p><p>Jen’s mouth tightened. “Why us?”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze landed on Agatha, lingering too long.</p><p>“She didn’t say,” Lilia replied, coolly vague – but Agatha swore there was something knowing in her eyes. “Only that you are expected. Now.”</p><p>Wanda whistled low, sliding off her chair and adjusting her corset with an almost playful grin, though there was tension under it.</p><p>“Well,” Wanda purred, glancing at Agatha with deliberate heat. “Guess we’ve been summoned to the Queen’s Court.”</p><p>Agatha rose slowly, smoothing her robe, masking the thrum of her heart.</p><p>Lilia’s voice followed them as they moved to the door.</p><p>“Be polite,” She warned softly. “And don’t ask questions you don’t want answers to.”</p><p>Agatha met her gaze, steady and unreadable.</p><p>“I never do.”</p><p> </p><p>The upstairs corridor didn’t look like the rest of The Coven. It wasn’t velvet and neon and glitter. It was marble and obsidian and silence.</p><p>Sound didn’t travel here. It absorbed.</p><p>Even the air felt different – older, sharper, like something ancient had soaked into the walls and now watched you move.</p><p>Agatha’s heels clicked softly as she followed Wanda and Jen down the corridor, past double doors guarded by two silent creatures in black suits with eyes darker than the obsidian door the guarded. The second they opened –</p><p>Heat. Cigar smoke. Bloodwine.</p><p>The VIP wing looked like a casino owned by a god. Tables of gleaming onyx and crimson velvet, gold cages suspended from above with dancers slowly moving inside them. The lighting was low and decadent, casting every shadow like it had something to hide.</p><p>The clients were creatures of power. Vampires old enough to have seen kingdoms rise and fall. Wolves with bones carved from battles. Demons in tailored suits. The air thrummed with <em>deals</em> – the kind that rewrote borders, ended lives, and tipped balances of power.</p><p>And in the center of it all –</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She sat on a black velvet chaise, legs crossed, one hand draped elegantly along the armrest, a wine glass the color of heartache dangling from her fingers. Her mouth was stained dark as sin. Her eyes – when they lifted – scanned the room like a predator deciding what to devour next.</p><p>She hadn’t even glanced at Agatha.</p><p>Not once.</p><p>Agatha scoffed internally. She was right. <em>Ancient coward</em>.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized how tightly her stomach had knotted until it twisted further.</p><p>“Damn,” Wanda murmured next to her, eyeing the crowd as she adjusted the tray of drinks in her hands. “This isn’t just some elite table. This is cartel-level energy.”</p><p>Jen nudged her, voice low. “We’re not here to talk. Just deliver. Eyes down, smiles on.”</p><p>They split, each gliding toward a separate area.</p><p>Agatha’s was in the corner – smoke curling from the ashtray, bottle of rare Bloodwine already uncorked. She kept her steps even as she approached, holding a tray high and steady.</p><p>A man – no, a wolf – lounged in the booth. Muscled, golden-eyed, with too many rings and a voice like crushed gravel.</p><p>“Well, well,” he growled, raking his gaze up her frame like he was checking the price of meat. “What did they send me tonight? A dancer with knives in her eyes.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, not kindly.</p><p>“Just here to pour drinks.”</p><p>“I bet you pour really sweet,” he said, tilting his head. “What’s your name, sugar?”</p><p>She set a glass down in front of him. “Raven.”</p><p>“Raven.” He echoed, like he wanted to bite it. “Pretty bird. You fly fast?”</p><p>Before she could answer –</p><p>A new voice cut in, cool and feminine.</p><p>“Back off, Fenris. She’s not yours.”</p><p>The woman who spoke slid into view like she was stepping out of smoke.</p><p>She was tall. Impossibly tall. Long, dark hair fell down her back like ink, and her green eyes glittered like poison in a goblet.</p><p>She didn’t just walk – she <em>commanded</em>.</p><p>Agatha stiffened instinctively. This wasn’t someone low on the totem pole. This was someone powerful.</p><p>“Don’t be rude,” the woman murmured, resting manicured fingers on the wolf’s shoulder. “You’ll scare the help.”</p><p>Fenris grumbled but leaned back with a lazy grin.</p><p>“I was just being friendly.”</p><p>The woman ignored him, turning her full attention on Agatha – and <em>staring</em>.</p><p>Agatha held still under the weight of it. That gaze was heavy. Interested.<em> Possessive</em>. Like Agatha owed her, her soul.</p><p>“I haven’t seen you before,” the woman said, voice slow and deliberate. “And I know this club.”</p><p>Agatha offered a professional smile. “I’m new.” A pause. “And I dance downstairs.”</p><p>“Mmmm,” The woman stepped closer, her voice velvet and danger. “What do they call you, new girl?”</p><p>“Raven.”</p><p>“Of course they do,” she murmured, like the name tasted good. “Dark. Sharp. Beautiful. Like you.”</p><p>The way she said it made Agatha’s skin crawl. Not with fear. With something worse.</p><p>Interest.</p><p>Wanda appeared then, placing a tray on the neighboring table, eyes flickering briefly to Agatha before narrowing on the woman beside her. Recognition, wariness. “Evening, Hela.”</p><p>Ah.</p><p>So that was her.</p><p>The name hit like a match to kerosene.</p><p>Hela.</p><p>Agatha had heard it whispered by dancer’s backstage, always in low, reverent voices. The head of one of the oldest vampire clans – one that didn’t deal in clubs or Bloodwine or stage lights. One that dealt in wars. One that burned kingdoms.</p><p>She was Rio’s second-in-command.</p><p>And she was watching Agatha like she’d just found her next campaign/</p><p>Hela’s smile curled.</p><p>“You should dance for me some time,” she said softly. “Just me. Just us.”</p><p>Before Agatha could reply, another voice – low and cold – cut through the air behind her.</p><p>“She’s working.”</p><p>That shudder, that presence, that plagued her when she was dancing.</p><p>Those eyes that seemed to burn her skin and light every nerve ending on fire.</p><p>The voice that had her dripping two nights ago.</p><p>It didn’t rise above conversation level. It didn’t need to.</p><p>Agatha’s <em>body temperature </em>changed.</p><p>Every head turned.</p><p>Rio stood at the edge of the table, her black suit immaculate, her shirt unbuttoned just enough to show the elegant lines of her collarbone. Her hair was swept back. Her lips panted blood.</p><p>And her eyes – those impossible, obsidian ringed eyes – were locked on Hela.</p><p>Hela didn’t look surprised. Just amused.</p><p>“Darling,” she drawled, “I didn’t know she belonged to you.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched – not a smile.</p><p>“She doesn’t.”</p><p>Her eyes flicked to Raven for the first time.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t breathe.</p><p>The tension curled like a knife between them. No one moved. Even Fenris looked like he was holding his breath.</p><p>“Upstairs.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “I’m – working.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze didn’t waver.</p><p>“I’m not asking.”</p><p>She didn’t wait for agreement. She turned on her heel and disappeared toward the upper balcony.</p><p>Agatha’s blood roared.</p><p>Every part of her screamed not to follow.</p><p>And every part of her obeyed anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s legs carried her up the staircase before her mind could catch up.</p><p>Her blood roared with fury, heat, and something worse – humiliation.</p><p>The whole room had watched.</p><p>Watched her be summoned like a pet. Watched Rio stake her claim like it was nothing.</p><p>Agatha’s teeth ground tighter.</p><p>She reached the top of the stairs, just behind Rio, and found herself in front of a tall, black door carved with symbols she didn’t dare decipher.</p><p>It opened for her without touch.</p><p>Of course it did.</p><p>She stepped inside.</p><p>Rio’s private quarters weren’t what she expected.</p><p>They weren’t decadent or overly adorned like the rest of the club. O velvet. No gold.</p><p>It was shadowed, sleek, and cold – marble floors, dark wood, and towering windows overlooking the city’s dead heart. A fireplace flickered low in the corner, casting faint gold across polished stone and leather chairs.</p><p>And there, standing by the glass wall, was Rio.</p><p>Her back was to Agatha, one hand in her pocket, the other holding a glass still half-filled with something dark and vicious.</p><p>Agatha’s anger ignited hotter.</p><p>“You really think you can just summon me like some fucking lapdog?”</p><p>Rio didn’t turn.</p><p>“You followed,” she said, voice quiet.</p><p>“Because I didn’t want to cause a scene.” Agatha stalked further into the room, her heels stabbing the floor with every step. “Though clearly that ships sailed.”</p><p>Rio’s head tilted slightly, amused as she finally glanced over her shoulder. “You didn’t mind causing one downstairs.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Oh, I see,” she bit out, crossing her arms over her chest. “This is about her.”</p><p>At that, Rio finally turned.</p><p>Her gaze was calm, but beneath it was a storm.</p><p>“She wants you.” Rio said simply, the words like smoke slipping between her teeth.</p><p>Agatha laughed – sharp, venomous. “What’s the matter, Rio? Jealous that someone else saw through your little trick and decided I looked worth tasting?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened.</p><p>“You think that’s what this is about?” Her voice lowered, dangerously smooth. “That this is about jealousy?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart thundered – but she didn’t back down.</p><p>“No.” She spat, stalking closer. “I think you like it. Watching someone try to stake their claim on me. Watching me being pulled in like some fucking toy. So that when you try to claim me it feels like I’m some fucking trophy.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze burned hotter, but she didn’t flinch.</p><p>“You like it too much,” she said, deadly soft.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled, slow and cruel. “Being wanted by monsters.”</p><p>The words hit like a slap.</p><p>“You want us to look at you like we would destroy ourselves for you.” Rio went on, stepping forward with that liquid, stalking grace. “You dress like bait. You dance like a goddamn flame daring every moth to burn.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse kicked hard, but she stood her ground.</p><p>“You think you’re the first mortal to come crawling in her with a power kink?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, but Rio kept going, her words laced with quiet, brutal precision.</p><p>“You get off on it. The idea of us begging for you. You want to be worshipped by creatures older than your entire bloodline.” She stopped inches from her, her breath grazing Agatha’s lips. “It’s pathetic.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand shot out before she could stop herself, shoving hard against Rio’s chest.</p><p>The vampire barely moved – but her gaze flared, surprised.</p><p>“Pathetic?” Agatha hissed, her voice shaking with rage. “You’re the one who knelt before me, drooling to taste me, and then vanished like a coward.”</p><p>The words landed like gunfire.</p><p>Rio’s body went still. Her expression blanked, cold and unreadable.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha laughed bitterly, her chest heaving. “What’s the matter? Don’t like hearing it out loud?”</p><p>Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse roared.</p><p>“You’re afraid,” She snarled, stepping into Rio’s space, pushing harder. “Afraid that if you take one fucking bite, you’ll actually feel something for once in your ancient, miserable like.”</p><p>Still, Rio didn’t speak.</p><p>Agatha kept going, reckless now, driven by fury and something dangerous.</p><p>“You like playing the predator, but you ran away from me,” She taunted, every word sharper than the last. “You’re nothing but an ancient coward hiding behind a pretty face and expensive suit.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed.</p><p>But her hands?</p><p>Her hands stayed loose at her sides.</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded faster – too fast – but she didn’t stop.</p><p>“Tell me I’m wrong.” She dared, voice lower now, dripping with venom and heat. “Tell me you didn’t disappear because you <em>love</em> the fact that I am the one in control here.”</p><p>Ro’s eyes flashed.</p><p>In a blink, she moved.</p><p>Rio’s hands were everywhere – rough on her hips, her waist, dragging her closer, pressing her against the cold marble wall like it was a punishment. Her mouth was feverish, biting, devouring, but Agatha gave as good as she got – nails raking, lips bruising, every clash of their bodies more vicious than the last.</p><p>“You want this,” Rio growled against her mouth, her voice molten dark. “You want to be ruined.”</p><p>Agatha let out a low, dangerous laugh between breaths, tilting her chin defiantly. “You think I haven’t been touched by worse than you?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed, something savage sparking behind them.</p><p>“You’re dripping for me,” she sneered, her voice dripping with heat and venom, dragging her hands down Agatha’s thighs, squeezing hard enough to bruise. “Don’t lie to yourself.”</p><p>Agatha gasped, but she didn’t yield.</p><p>Instead, she shoved Rio hard – slamming her back into the opposite wall, the force rattling the frames on the stone.</p><p>“You talk too much,” Agatha snarled, her breath hot and ragged. “All that ancient wisdom, and all you are is a coward who runs when she’s afraid to lose control.”</p><p>Rio’s breath was rough now, her chest rising and falling as she let herself be pinned – but her eyes glittered like a storm waiting to strike.</p><p>“You want me to lose it?” Rio’s voice was almost a growl, low and curling like smoke around Agatha’s throat. “Fine.”</p><p>Her hands shot out grabbing Agatha’s wrists, yanking them both above her head, forcing her against the wall with brutal ease.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught as her body arched, hips slamming into Rio’s.</p><p>“You’d look divine begging beneath me,” Rio hissed, her words like silk-wrapped knives, dragging her mouth down Agatha’s neck, not biting – but close, her sharp canines ghosting over her skin. “All fire until you’re screaming for more.”</p><p>Agatha’s legs trembled – but not from fear.</p><p>From <em>rage</em>. From <em>need</em>.</p><p>“You think I’ll beg for you?” Agatha gasped, trying to pull free – but Rio’s grip was unrelenting, iron-wrapped heat.</p><p>“I think,” Rio whispered against her throat, “you <em>like</em> it when I hurt you a little.”</p><p>Her nails dug into Agatha’s wrists – enough to sting, to leave faint marks – but never fully breaking skin.</p><p>A moan slipped from Agatha’s throat before she could catch it.</p><p>Rio <em>smiled</em>, slow and predatory, hearing it.</p><p>“There she is,” Rio purred dragging her teeth along Agatha’s collarbone, not biting – but scraping enough to make her shudder. “My pretty little masochist.”</p><p>Agatha’s rage flared white-hot.</p><p>In a swift, vicious motion, she twisted her wrists free, flipping their positions with a snarl – slamming Rio back against the wall again, this time with Agatha’s hand wrapped around her throat.</p><p>“You think I am the one who likes the pain?” Agatha’s voice was molten now, dark and wicked, her nails digging down Rio’s chest, leaving faint, angry red lines through the silk of her shirt. “You’ve been chasing it since the second you saw me audition.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes dilated – black, wide, devouring.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, her lips barely grazing Rio’s/</p><p>“You want me to ruin you,” Agatha whispered, her tone dripping with mockery, grinding her hips against Rio’s with slow, punishing pressure. “You want to be stripped down, dragged low, worshipped like a goad and used like a toy.”</p><p>Rio’s breath shuddered.</p><p>But she didn’t pull away.</p><p>Agatha smirked – dark and victorious.</p><p>“You’re addicted to it,” she crooned, her nails digging deeper into Rio’s skin, dragging a sharp gasp from her. “The way I don’t bow. The way <em>I make you feel</em>.”</p><p>She pressed her thigh between Rio’s legs, grinding up with brutal, deliberate force.</p><p>Rio <em>moaned </em>– a sound so raw so undone, it made Agatha’s head spin.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha purred, delighting in the sound, “That’s it, isn’t it?? That’s what you’ve been running from.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted, panting now, her hands trembling slightly where they gripped Agatha’s hips.</p><p>Agatha’s grin sharpened.</p><p>“You like being degraded,” she whispered, biting at Rio’s ear, dragging her teeth along the shell. “You like knowing mortal me could <em>destroy</em> immortal you.”</p><p>Rio’s only answer was a choked sound that sent heat pooling between Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Agatha’s control snapped tighter, more dangerous than ever.</p><p>“You’re pathetic,” she hissed, dragging her nails down Rio’s chest again, this time <em>tearing </em>the silk shirt, leaving welts behind staking her claim. “All this power, all this age – and you’re nothing but a desperate little thing begging for it now.”</p><p>Rio’s whole-body shook – but not from rage.</p><p>From arousal.</p><p>“Say it,” Agatha demanded, grinding harder, crueler, until Rio’s hips bucked, “Say you love it.”</p><p>Rio’s voice was hoarse, breathless – but it came, raw and unguarded.</p><p>“<em>I love it</em>.” She rasped.</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded.</p><p>“You love being used,” she taunted, dragging her hand between their bodies, cupping Rio through her slacks, squeezing hard enough to make Rio gasp. “Say it.”</p><p>Rio whimpered – whimpered – as Agatha’s fingers tightened, her face flushed and wrecked.</p><p>“I love being used,” she choked out, every word dripping with lust and degradation.</p><p>Agatha’s power surged, her body lit with triumph and need.</p><p>“Good girl,” she purred, her voice like a whip, dragging her nails up to Rio’s throat again. “My good, obedient little monster.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered, her body shuddering against the wall – but still, she didn’t bite.</p><p>She couldn’t.</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t allow it.</p><p>Agatha’s grin turned razor sharp.</p><p>“No teeth,” She whispered, dragging her hand into Rio’s hair, fisting it tight, yanking her head back. “You don’t get that part of me.”</p><p>Rio moaned, the denial hitting her like a brand.</p><p>Agatha kissed her then – hard, claiming, violent – biting Rio’s bottom lip until she tasted copper between them.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Not hers.</p><p>But enough.</p><p>Agatha’s body shivered at the taste, kissing her deeper, sloppier, reveling in the dark metallic heat of it.</p><p>Rio gasped into her mouth, hips grinding, desperate for more.</p><p>Agatha <em>owned</em> her.</p><p>Agatha <em>devoured </em>her.</p><p>Her hands were everywhere – clawing at Rio’s silk shirt, ripping it open without mercy, buttons scattering across the floor like discarded armor. She grabbed fistfuls of that pristine fabric, dragging it down Rio’s arms, exposing the smooth, sculpted planes of her chest and shoulders.</p><p>“Look at you,” Agatha hissed, dragging her nails down the line of Rio’s sternum, leaving red streaks in her wake. “All that power and I have you pinned like a fucking doll.”</p><p>Her fingers slid lower – slow at first, cruel in their control – trailing over Rio’s abdomen, tracing every hard ridge of muscle as if she were mapping every weakness.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, her head tipping back against the wall, eyes fluttering shut.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t finished.</p><p>She grabbed Rio by the jaw, forcing her to look <em>directly</em> at her.</p><p>“No.” Agatha growled, her voice dark silk. “You <em>watch</em> me while I ruin you.”</p><p>Rio’s pupils were blown wide, her breath ragged as she obeyed.</p><p>Agatha’s hands drifted lower, dragging over the waistband of Rio’s tailored pants, teasing just above where the heat throbbed between her legs.</p><p>“You want this?” Agatha taunted, her voice dripping with venom and heat. “You want me to take you apart?”</p><p>Rio let out a ragged desperate sound.</p><p>“Say it.”</p><p>“I… want…” Rio’s voice broke on a moan.</p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for her to finish.</p><p>With brutal precision, she slipped her hand inside Rio’s pants, fingers dragging over soaked silk beneath – slick, hot, <em>ready</em>.</p><p>“Oh, you’re pathetic,” Agatha purred, biting down on Rio’s lip hard enough to draw another bloom of blood. “Already soaked from just a little rough play.”</p><p>Her fingers slid over Rio’s slick folds, teasing her deliberately, barely giving her what she wanted – circling slow, cruel, making Rio grind helplessly into her hand.</p><p>Agatha’s grin widened.</p><p>“Beg for it.”</p><p>Rio whimpered, hips arching involuntarily.</p><p>“Beg.” Agatha demanded again, twisting her fingers just enough to make Rio shudder violently.</p><p>“Please,” Rio gasped, breathless and utterly undone. “Please Raven – please touch me.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Agatha stated, too lost to remember exactly why she was Raven.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio moaned even louder, clenching around relentless fingers.</p><p>Agatha rewarded her instantly.</p><p>She shoved her fingers deeper inside, filling Rio with no warning – rough, claiming, relentless.</p><p>Rio screamed, her head slamming back against the wall, her hands gripping Agatha’s hips like she might fall apart.</p><p>Agatha’s pace was merciless.</p><p>She fucked her with brutal precision, curling her fingers deep inside, finding every spot that made Rio cry louder, harder, shameless in her pleasure.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha cooed darkly, voice hot against Rio’s ear as she thrust faster, grinding the heel of her palm against the swollen bundle of nerves above.</p><p>Rio was shaking now, her body wracked with pleasure and overstimulation, every nerve fraying under Agatha’s touch.</p><p>“You love this,” Agatha growled, biting down on Rio’s neck – not to break skin, but hard enough to bruise. “Being taken part. Being owned.”</p><p>Rio’s body convulsed, her orgasm building dangerously fast, her legs trembling as Agatha drover her relentlessly toward the edge.</p><p>“Come for me,” Agatha demanded, her voice pure dominance, dragging her fingers deeper, faster, harder.</p><p>Rio shattered.</p><p>She came with a cry so raw and violent it echoed through the entire room, her hips jerking wildly, body writhing as she rode the waves crashing through her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t stop.</p><p>She fucked her through it, dragging every aftershock, every twitching spasm from Rio’s limp, shuddering body, until she was utterly spent – wrecked, flushed, panting.</p><p>Only then did Agatha finally pull back, her fingers slick and shining as she dragged them slowing over Rio’s trembling thighs in a possessive caress.</p><p>She licked her lips, eyes burning with triumph.</p><p>“Pathetic.” Agatha crooned, leaning down to press a slow, taunting kiss to Rio’s trembling mouth. “You will never forget this.”</p><p>Agatha smiled – dark, victorious.</p><p>But she could feel it.</p><p>The <em>shift</em>.</p><p>Agatha didn’t have more than a heartbeat to revel in her victory before the air shifted.</p><p>It was subtle – but deadly.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to gasp before Rio’s hands moved – lightning-fast, devastatingly strong.</p><p>One moment, she was pinned to the wall, breathless under Rio’s iron grip.</p><p>The next, Rio had lifted her – effortlessly.</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp, startled sound as her legs were hooked around Rio’s waist, her wrists caught and pinned b one of Rio’s hands above her head, her back arched as she was carried like she weighed nothing at all.</p><p>“Look at you,” Rio growled, her voice thick with hunger and dark delight, her stride purposeful as she carried Agatha across the room, toward the massive bed draped in black sheets and shadows. “Still pretending you’re not already mine.”</p><p>Agatha thrashed – halfhearted, desperate – but Rio held her firm, her supernatural strength absolute.</p><p>“You can fight,” Rio murmured, dragging her lips along Agatha’s neck, making her shudder. “It only makes it sweeter when you break.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded, her body burning under the heat of Rio’s breath.</p><p>“You’re not afraid of me,” Rio whispered, her fangs grazing. – but never biting – as she reached the bed. “But you <em>should</em> be.”</p><p>She dropped Agatha onto the bed – not harsh, but deliberate.</p><p>Agatha bounced against the soft sheets, breathless and wide-eyed as Rio crawled over her, her body moving with the grace of a predator stalking its prey.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled in a taunt, breathless but defiant.</p><p>“Then fuck me like you mean it, Rio,” she dared, her voice ragged and dark with need. “Or are you still afraid you can’t handle me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flared.</p><p>Then she pounced.</p><p>In a blur, she pinned Agatha’s wrists above her head again, her other hand dragging down her body, slow and possessive, making Agatha writhe under her touch.</p><p>“Oh, I’ll handle you.” Rio promised, her voice a sinful purr, pressing her weight down until Agatha was fully trapped beneath her. “I’ll ruin you.”</p><p>She dipped her head, her lips brushing Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“And I’ll make you love every second of it, Agatha.”</p><p>The name struck deep – stripping away every mask, every shield.</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered – but Rio didn’t give her time to recover.</p><p>Her hand moved lower – fast, sure, rough in all the right ways.</p><p>“You’re perfect,” Rio murmured as her fingers found their mark, dragging over Agatha’s slick heat, making her gasp. “So strong… so eager for me.”</p><p>Agatha let out a choked moan, her hips arching helplessly as Rio’s fingers slid inside her – deep, claiming, merciless.</p><p>Her pace was brutal.</p><p>Relentless.</p><p>She fucked Agatha with supernatural precision, dragging every sound, every shudder from her body with expert ease.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio purred, her voice molten silk, eyes locked on Agatha’s flushed, desperate face. “Taking me so well… look at you… falling apart so beautifully for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s head thrashed against the pillows, her body shaking under the overwhelming force of Rio’s praise and her devastating touch.</p><p>“Say it,” Rio commanded, her voice low and dark, curling like smoke in the air. “Say you want me to ruin you.”</p><p>Agatha gasped – half-lost already – but still defiant.</p><p>“I – want…” She choked, breathless, her pride crumbling under the weight of her own desire.</p><p>“Say it, Agatha,” Rio demanded again, thrusting harder, her strength holding Agatha perfectly in place. “Beg for it.”</p><p>Agatha broke.</p><p>“I want you to ruin me,” she sobbed, her body arching, desperate and burning.</p><p>Rio’s smile was pure sin.</p><p>“Good girl.”</p><p>She pushed Agatha harder, faster, her praises wrapping around every thrust.</p><p>“My beautiful girl… so perfect… look at how gorgeous you are when you fall apart for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s climax hit her like fire – violent, consuming, leaving her gasping, sobbing, writhing under Rio’s unrelenting hands.</p><p>Rio didn’t let go.</p><p>She held Agatha through it – strong, steady, possessive – her hands still moving as she whispered in her ear.</p><p>“That’s it, Agatha.” Rio purred, kissing her temple as her body shuddered beneath her. “All mine.”</p><p>Agatha’s body was still trembling from the aftershocks, her breath ragged against the soft pillow beneath her. But even as her limbs quivered and her pulse roared, something deeper began to coil within her again.</p><p>Heat.</p><p>Hunger.</p><p>Control.</p><p>She opened her eyes, meeting Rio’s dark, burning gaze – still looming over her, still holding her like a prize claimed.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t done.</p><p>Not even close.</p><p>With slow, deliberate purpose, she reached up – curling her fingers tight around Rio’s jaw, forcing her to look her directly in the eyes.</p><p>“Flip over,” Agatha commanded, her voice low, rough with satisfaction and something far darker beneath.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flared, something primal sparking between them – but Agatha didn’t flinch.</p><p>She tightened her grip, her nails dragging ever so slightly along Rio’s skin as she tilted her chin higher.</p><p>“Now.”</p><p>It was not a request.</p><p>A slow, dangerous smile curved across Rio’s lips.</p><p>And then – without breaking eye contact – she obeyed.</p><p>Graceful as ever, she shifted back, retreating just enough to roll onto her back, her body sprawled against the dark sheets like a felled deity awaiting sacrifice. Her long hair fanned out around her, her throat bare, her chest rising and falling in steady, deliberate breaths.</p><p>She wasn’t resisting.</p><p>She was <em>offering</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded – but this time, it wasn’t from submission.</p><p>It was from the thrill of having Rio beneath her.</p><p>She straddled Rio’s waist, dragging her hands down the vampire’s bare chest, with slow deliberate reverence – like she was mapping every inch of territory she now owned.</p><p>She teased at exposed nipples before tracing over the tattoos that she was finally getting to see.</p><p>Now exposed, winding along Rio’s torso and arms, intricate vines seemed to bloom across her sun-kissed skin – deep green and gold, weaving in delicate, mesmerizing patterns that seemed almost alive in the low light.</p><p>They weren’t ordinary ink.</p><p>They shimmered faintly as though breathing with her pulse – ancient, beautiful, dangerous.</p><p>Agatha’s hands moved before she could stop herself, tracing along the curling vines winding from Rio’s hip up to her ribs, watching the way the tattoos shifted with every breath.</p><p>“Beautiful,” Agatha muttered under her breath, her voice husky, unable to hide the awe tangled in her hunger.</p><p>Rio’s gaze burned with dark amusement, her voice a low, molten murmur.</p><p>“They mark every sin I’ve survived,” She whispered. “Every life I’ve taken. Every promise I’ve kept. They normally hide themselves.” Rio looked up her eyes burning with heat and desire. “But they seem to dance for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingertips followed the delicate lines up over Rio’s ribs, then down the curve of her breasts, claiming each inch as her own.</p><p>“Their mine now,” Agatha said, her voice rough, possessive.</p><p>Rio let out a soft, knowing hum – but didn’t speak.</p><p>Agatha straddled her, slowly, deliberately, feeling the steady tension of Rio’s body under her own.</p><p>With the tattoos revealed, Rio looked even more otherworldly – like something that wasn’t meant to be touched, much less claimed.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t afraid.</p><p>She leaned down, lips brushing the edge of one of the vines curling along Rio’s collarbone.</p><p>“I told you that I would ride your mouth like a throne,” Agatha whispered, her breath ghosting over the ancient ink. “I think it’s time I kept that promise.”</p><p>Her voice was steady, dripping with authority.</p><p>And Rio… smiled.</p><p>That dark, knowing, reverent smile that sent heat coiling through every inch of Agatha’s body.</p><p>Without waiting, Agatha moved higher, claiming her seat with slow, dominating grace – every movement purposeful.</p><p>She tangled her fingers into Rio’s dark hair, gripping tight, tilting her head back just enough to force eye contact.</p><p>Her smirk was wicked, triumphant.</p><p>“You’re my throne.” She purred; her voice thick with satisfaction.</p><p>And Rio’s answering look – half hunger, half devotion – told her everything.</p><p>This wasn’t surrender.</p><p>It was worship.</p><p>Agatha had never felt more powerful.</p><p>Agatha moved with deliberate grace, fully aware of every breathless movement as she settled above Rio – claiming her place, claiming <em>her</em>.</p><p>There was no hesitation now.</p><p>Only certainty.</p><p>Her hands gripped tighter in Rio’s hair as she began to devour Agatha starting with broad strokes, Agatha guiding her with firm control. The power that surged through her veins, heady and intoxicating.</p><p>And Rio – ancient, powerful Rio – didn’t resist.</p><p>She let Agatha take everything.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s firm hands gripped her thighs – not to control, but to steady, to anchor, to <em>worship</em>.</p><p>That’s what this was.</p><p>Worship.</p><p>Reverence.</p><p>The vampire beneath her looked up with hunger and something far deeper than desire – something bordering on devotion. Something deeper. Those dark eyes shimmered with the weight of it, burning through Agatha’s every barrier.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled in a wicked, breathless smile.</p><p>“Good,” she whispered, voice rough with command and exhilaration, her body arching as she rode the waves of pleasure and power. “Stay right there… tale everything I give you.”</p><p>Rio’s hands tightened; her mouth eager, obedient.</p><p>Agatha moved with increasing ferocity – each roll of her hips a deliberate act of dominance, each sound that escaped her throat a gift, and Rio took it all, worshipping her with relentless, aching precision.</p><p>It was maddening.</p><p>Agatha’s head tipped back, her fingers tightening in Rio’s hair as her body began to tremble again – every nerve ending aflame, every muscle drawn tight with the promise of release.</p><p>She could feel it building – sharp and scorching, draw higher by Rio’s unyielding worship, the vampire’s moth working with the kind of reverence that would destroy Agatha.</p><p>“Mine,” Agatha gasped, breathless, eyes fluttering shut as she gave herself over to the rising, inevitable edge. “You’re mine – <em>all mine</em>…”</p><p>Rio groaned beneath her, the sound low and ragged, and it sent Agatha hurtling into the fall – her climax slamming through her like wildfire, consuming everything in its path.</p><p>She cried out, her body shuddering violently, every muscle locking as she rode the wave down, breathless and trembling, completely undone by the sheer worship of the woman beneath her.</p><p>Even as she came down, Rio didn’t let her go.</p><p>She kept holding her, steadying her, her touch almost tender now – her hands smoothing along Agatha’s trembling thighs, grounding her with quiet, possessive reverence.</p><p>Agatha finally collapsed forward, chest heaving, her body spent but still tingling from the intensity of it all.</p><p>For a long moment, neither of them spoke.</p><p>They were tangled together in the quiet aftermath – sweat-slicked, breathless, and wrecked in the shadows of that bed.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse was racing as she let her weight sink into Rio’s chest, her cheek resting against the cool skin etched with those ancient vine tattoos.</p><p>She could feel Rio’s heartbeat beneath her – slow, steady, and impossibly calm, like she had all the time in the world.</p><p>Rio’s hands slid up her back, slow and reverent, fingertips tracing the curve of her spine in a way that felt too far gentle for what they had just done.</p><p>Silence stretched between them – thick, heavy, but not uncomfortable.</p><p>Agatha’s body still hummed from the storm they’d unleashed, listening to the steady thrum of the vampire’s heartbeat beneath her ear.</p><p>It was slower than she expected.</p><p>Calm.</p><p>Ancient.</p><p>Rio’s fingers traced idle, delicate patterns along her bare back – unhurried, as if savoring the quiet just as much as the chaos that had come.</p><p>But Agatha’s mind wasn’t quiet.</p><p>Not even close.</p><p>Her throat worked as she swallowed, staring at the black sheets tangled around their legs.</p><p>“You’re quiet.” Agatha murmured; her voice low, almost wary.</p><p>Rio’s hand drifted lazily along her back, soothing but distant, as if she were slipping behind some inner walls again.</p><p>“I don’t feel the need to fill the silence,” Rio said softly, her voice calm, her lips brushing Agatha’s hair.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t satisfied with that.</p><p>She lifted her head, shifting just enough to meet Rio’s dark eyes in the dimness.</p><p>There was something hidden there.</p><p>Something guarded.</p><p>“You’ve been watching me like you’re afraid I’ll vanish,” Agatha said, her voice sharpened by curiosity. “Why?” she asked breathless now – not from lust, but from the weight of the question.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away.</p><p>Her fingers continued tracing slow circles against Agatha’s skin, thoughtful, as if debating whether to speak at all.</p><p>And when she finally did, her voice wasn’t cold.</p><p>It was quiet.</p><p>Almost reluctant.</p><p>“I knew.” Rio said, the words slipping out like smoke curling into the night. “From the first moment.”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Her heart stumbled, her breath catching as she searched Rio’s face.</p><p>“Knew what?” she whispered, though she already felt the answer tightening around her throat.</p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed along her collarbone, a strange tenderness in the gesture.</p><p>“That you’re a hunter,” Rio admitted, her voice soft – but there was no menace in it. “I knew the second you walked onto that stage.”</p><p>Agatha’s body went rigid, her throat tightening.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“I could smell it on you,” Rio continued her eyes steady and calm, like she was stating the weather. “Old magic. Worn like second skin. The weight of your kind… it clings.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath was ragged now, adrenaline surging again – but Rio’s touch stayed gentle, soothing in a way that made her chest ache.</p><p>“And yet,” Rio murmured, her voice dipping lower, more vulnerable than Agatha had ever heard it, “I didn’t kill you. Couldn’t kill you.”</p><p>Agatha stared, unable to speak.</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked, a faint shadow of a smile – but there was no humor in it.</p><p>“Do you know why?” Rio asked, though she didn’t wait for an answer.</p><p>Her thumb brushed across Agatha’s lips, slow and deliberate.</p><p>“Because something else happened first.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse roared in her ears, but she stayed still – caught in the gravity of those words.</p><p>“I’ve lived a long time,” Rio said gently, her voice tinged with something weary. “I’ve seen wars, kingdoms, lovers, betrayals. Nothing surprises me anymore.”</p><p>She paused.</p><p>“But then… you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath shuddered.</p><p>“There’s a bond,” Rio continued, her voice soft, as if afraid to speak it too loudly. “Rare. Dangerous. One that snaps between souls not meant to be apart. A bound between souls.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>Rio’s gaze darkened, something haunting in her expression.</p><p>“It only clicks into place between vampires,” She said, almost bitterly, “But the moment I saw you… I felt it spark. The beginning of something I haven’t felt in my millennia alive.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened painfully.</p><p>“You’re lying.” She said, but the words came out as little more than a broken whisper.</p><p>Rio’s smile was faint – sad, almost.</p><p>“I wish I were.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t breathe.</p><p>“But you’re mortal,” Rio continued softly, brushing her knuckles along Agatha’s cheek. “It can’t fully snap. Not yet.”</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>The words struck like lightening.</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded violently, her body caught between fear and something hotter, something more terrifying.</p><p>Want.</p><p>“I can’t let you go.” Rio said, her voice dropping lower, barely a breath.</p><p>The confession sat between them, burning and inescapable.</p><p>Agatha’s voice shook, but she couldn’t stop herself.</p><p>“What happens if I don’t run?”</p><p>Rio’s answer was soft.</p><p>Almost reverent.</p><p>“Then I’ll burn with you.”</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>One Week Later</strong>
</p><p>It started the moment she looked in the mirror.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers traced the small bruises on her inner thighs, still faintly tender from where Rio had gripped her too tightly – marking her, claiming her. She could feel the echo of it still, a burn that had nothing to do with pain.</p><p>Her reflection stared back, pale and flushed, lips still swollen from the last time they kissed.</p><p>She hadn’t meant to get this deep.</p><p>But Rio was in her bones now.</p><p>Worse – Agatha could feel it under her skin, threaded through her body like silk and smoke.</p><p>The bond.</p><p>Invisible, but tightening. Begging for her to turn to complete it.</p><p>Her mind was flooded with flashes where she almost asked Rio to bite her. Turn her.</p><p>
<em><br/>Her back against silk sheets, Rio’s hands spreading her wide, her voice rough and reverent as she growled, </em>
<em>“You were made for this, Agatha.”</em>
</p><p>
<em><br/>Pinned against the wall, her wrists bound by Rio’s hands, gasping as the vampire whispered against her throat, </em>
<em>“I’m never letting you go.”</em>
</p><p>
<em><br/>Agatha on top of her this time, riding Rio with brutal, unrestrained hunger, both swearing and clawing at each other like animals starving for another taste.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t stop thinking about it.</p><p>Couldn’t stop<em> feeling</em> it.</p><p>She could hear Rio’s voice in her ear, dark and tender. “<em>You’re mine, little dancer</em>.”</p><p>And worse – she didn’t want to stop.</p><p>She sucked in a breath, dragging herself back to the present – but her thighs squeezed together instinctively, her pulse racing.</p><p>“You’ve been vanishing a lot lately.”</p><p>Wanda’s teasing voice snapped her out of it, slicing though the haze like a blade.</p><p>Agatha glanced sharply to see Wanda watching her from across the dressing room, a wicked grin curving her lips.</p><p>“I’ve been busy,” Agatha muttered, schooling her face to calm as she pulled her robe tighter around her body.</p><p>Jen’s snort was immediate. “Budy? That what we’re calling it now?”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “Come on, Raven. You’ve got that look.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, reaching for her lipstick with steady hands. “What look?”</p><p>“The look of a woman whose been absolutely ruined and loved every second of it.”</p><p>Wanda purred, lounging back in her chair like a cat in the sun. “You’re practically glowing.”</p><p>Jen smirked, swinging. Her legs up onto the vanity as she lit a cigarette. “Glowing – and walking like she’s been thoroughly fucked backstage.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed despite herself, but she refused to rise to the bait. “You two need hobbies.”</p><p>“Oh, but this is our hobby,” Wanda said with a wicked smile, leaning over and dragging a teasing finger along Agatha’s thigh, right where a faint bruise peeking out from under her stocking. “Especially when you leave us such obvious clues.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, but she shoved Wanda’s hand away with a glare that had no real bite.</p><p>Jen whistled low, taking a long drag. “She’s marked you.”</p><p>“Like hell,” Agatha said, her voice sharp – but it sounded weak even to her own ears.</p><p>Wanda’s grin only grew sharper. “Oh, darling. She’s <em>claimed </em>you.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse hammered, but she kept her expression icy.</p><p>Jen’s eyes flickered toward the mirror, catching Agatha’s flushed reflection.</p><p>“Still,” Jen said slowly, voice curling with amusement, “I’ve got to hand it to you, Raven. You’re got her hooked too.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped.</p><p>Wanda let out a low, appreciative hum. “Mmmm, yes. Our elusive club own Rio hasn’t been this present in weeks – and somehow, every time you disappear, she’s suddenly nowhere to be found either.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, standing abruptly and grabbing her heels. “You two should start a tabloid.”</p><p>Wanda’s laughter followed her, soft and sultry. “Maybe we should start a betting pool instead.”</p><p>Jen’s grin widened, her voice dropping just enough to be dangerous. “Already did.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Lilia’s voice came crackling though the speaker above the door, sharp and smooth.</p><p>“Ladies. You’re needed on the floor.”</p><p>Saved.</p><p>Agatha stalked towards the door, hair flowing behind her.</p><p>Wanda called after her, laughter still in her voice. “Don’t get lost on the way, sweetheart.”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>Because as she walked down the hall, her skin buzzed.</p><p> </p><p>The club was already alive, smoke curling thick around gilded lights, bodies swaying under the pulse of low, seductive bass.</p><p>Agatha stepped onto the floor with Wanda and Jen, forcing her mind back to work.</p><p>But the moment she glanced up –</p><p>She froze.</p><p>There she was.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Perched at her usual spot at the highest balcony, shrouded in shadow and soft lamplight, her figure draped in black velvet and silk. One arm rested casually along the rail; her wine glass untouched in her hand.</p><p>She wasn’t smiling.</p><p>Her gaze locked on Agatha – unblinking, steady, possessive.</p><p>And a promise to all the things she whispered she’d do to her.</p><p>It wasn’t subtle.</p><p>It was a warning.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse kicked up – but she met that gaze, refusing to show how much it made her burn under her skin.</p><p>Before she could think too long about it, a new presence slipped through the crowd.</p><p>Subtle.</p><p>Precise.</p><p>Hela.</p><p>Unlike Rio’s looming, silent power, Hela moved like smoke – deliberate, slipping between dancers and clients until she was suddenly just there, beside Agatha, close enough to brush shoulders.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to stiffen before Hela’s low, silk-smooth voice unfurled against her ear.</p><p>“Hello gorgeous.” Hela murmured close to Agatha’s ear, “Guess why I am here tonight.”</p><p>Agatha kept her expression smooth, her voice as calm as glass. “I don’t waste time on obvious answers.”</p><p>Hela’s low laugh was soft and slow, curling around them like smoke.</p><p>“Oh, but this one’s worth hearing.” She murmured, her emerald gaze sweeping over Agatha’s figure, deliberate and slow.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved in the faintest smirk, cool and unimpressed. “You’re here to watch me.”</p><p>“Mmmm.” Hela’s smile deepened, delighted by her sharpness. “Smart girl.”</p><p>She took a step closer – invading space, not touching but close enough to make it intimate.</p><p>“I’ve never seen you dance.” Hela admitted, her voice dropping low. “But tonight, I came downstairs for one reason.”</p><p>Agatha’s tone stayed calm, clipped. “Curiosity?”</p><p>Hela’s lips quirked. “Hunger.”</p><p>She let the word linger between them, slow and deliberate.</p><p>Wanda and Jen were watching from nearby, their smiles gone – both tense, alert, sensing the shift in the air.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t show even a flicker of discomfort.</p><p>“I don’t dance for just anyone.” She replied smoothly.</p><p>Hela’s eyes glittered, amused. “Oh, but you’ll dance tonight,” she said softly, her gaze sliding toward the stage, then back to Agatha. “And I’ll be watching every second.”</p><p>Her gaze sharpened, studying Agatha’s composed face.</p><p>“You wear your secrets well,” Hela said, voice low enough that only Agatha could hear. “But there’s always a crack.”</p><p>Agatha remained still, utterly unreadable under her steady mask of indifference.</p><p>Hela tilted her head, intrigued.</p><p>Her eyes flicked – purposefully – upward.</p><p>To Rio.</p><p>Still watching.</p><p>Still burning.</p><p>And something clicked behind Hela’s eyes.</p><p>The corner of her mouth curled, slow and wicked.</p><p>“Oh,” she breathed, delight sparking in her voice. “So that’s it.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow arched, mild and unbothered. “Something amusing you?”</p><p>Hela’s gaze lingered between them, savoring the invisible thread stretched tight across the room.</p><p>“Nothing yet,” she said, her voice silken with promise. “But I’m starting to see what makes this game worth playing.”</p><p>Before Agatha answered, the lights changed, signaling it was ten minutes before her set.</p><p>“Show me something unforgettable, little flame,” she purred, before gliding back into the crowd with catlike grace.</p><p>Agatha turned toward the stairs, unhurried, calm.</p><p>She felt every gaze that followed her.</p><p>Hela’s sharp and calculating.</p><p>And Rio’s – hot enough to scorch the air, possessive enough to devour. The bond almost a visible thing between them.</p><p>And still, Agatha moved with cool, effortless grace.</p><p> </p><p>The lights dimmed, thick shadows slithering over the stage.</p><p>The first haunting notes of Skin dripped from the speakers, slow and heavy, laced with heat.</p><p>Agatha stepped into the glow – wrapped in deep emerald lingerie, the straps curling over her skin like the vines inked into Rio’s skin, hugging every curve, winding around her thighs, waist, and chest like they were made for her.</p><p>Like they’d been spun from temptation itself.</p><p>The crowd fell silent, breathless under her presence.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t dancing for them.</p><p>She was dancing for the ghosts she’d dragged onto this stage with her.</p><p>And she felt every single one of them.</p><p>She moved slowly at first – rolling her hips to the low beat, her hands tracing along her own skin as if she were savoring herself, as if every inch of her body were a secret with unveiling.</p><p>The vines bit softly into her flesh as she moved, and she let it fuel her.</p><p>Then the memories began to bite deeper.</p><p><em>Her body pinned down, helpless under Rio’s weight, her wrists locked above her head by hands that knew exactly how to hold her down. That low voice dripping heat into her hear,</em> “I would beg just for the chance to touch you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched in time with the music, her body swaying sharper now, fingers ghosting along her thighs as she let the memory bleed into her.</p><p><em>On her knees, face pressed against the velvet sheets, while Rio towered behind her – dominant, devastating, the edge of the strap pressing between her legs, teasing. The slow, taunting drag of it making her burn as Rio’s voice purred darkly,</em> “Take it, little hunter.”</p><p>Agatah’s hips rolled harder now, her hands dragging down her body with deliberate filth, showing everything to the crowd – but her mind was somewhere else.</p><p>Her fingers grazed over the curve of her breasts; her movements sinuous, wicked – just like that night.</p><p><em>Bent over Rio’s desk, her outfit ripped off her body, Rio fully clothed behind her, every inch of her brutal, relentless – her voice a low, guttural command,</em> “You’ll come for me like this… over and over.”</p><p>Agatha let her head tip back, arching to the beat as her hair spilled down her spine – dancing for them, but consumed by the past.</p><p>The music pulsed harder – thicker, darker.</p><p>Her thighs tightened as she dropped to the floor, spreading her legs in a slow, devastating split, dragging her nails up her inner thighs in full view of everyone.</p><p>But no one in this room could touch her.</p><p>Not even Hela, watching from her dark corner, licking her lips like she wanted to sink her teeth in.</p><p>Because the only one who could scorch her had already burned her alive.</p><p><em>Straddling Rio’s lap, her pale skin was slicked with sweat as she rode her hard, their bodies crashing together with bruising force – Rio’s nails raking down her back as she growled, </em>“We were made to break for each other.”</p><p>Agatha’s body moved faster now – sharper, more reckless, as if the music itself was carrying her.</p><p>She crawled across the stage on her hands and knees, slow and sultry, her eyes half-lidded but blazing with heat, her every step like a predator stalking prey.</p><p>Her lingerie shimmered under the lights – emerald and gold, curling like ivy across her flushed skin, wrapping her in temptation and danger.</p><p>The crowd was hypnotized.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t looking at them.</p><p>Her gaze lifted, slow and deliberate, locking onto the balcony above.</p><p>There she was.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Watching.</p><p>Burning.</p><p>The bond between them was molten now – begging to snap into place, as if it was a living thing that pulled taut between them, dragging her toward the inevitable.</p><p>Agatha smirked as she spun slowly, her back arching, her body moving in time with the final, decadent beats of the song.</p><p>She let every inch of her body drip with control – showing Rio exactly what she’d done to her.</p><p>And what she could still take.</p><p>As the last notes trembled through the room, Agatha rose to her feet – head high, shoulders back, every inch the untouchable queen.</p><p>Her skin glistened in the heat of the stage lights, curling around her bod like Rio’s hands, like fate itself.</p><p>She dipped into a slow, mocking bow – her eyes never leaving the balcony.</p><p>And in the smoky dark, she swore she saw Rio’s lips cur into something feral.</p><p>Possessive.</p><p>Dangerous.</p><p>But Agatha’s heart stayed steady, her body thrumming with triumph as she rose again.</p><p>Still untouchable.</p><p>Still in control.</p><p> </p><p>The dressing room was quiet.</p><p>Muted bass thumped somewhere beyond the thick velvet walls, but inside it was all soft lamplight and the faint scent of perfume and smoke.</p><p>Agatha sat at her vanity, fingers steady as she touched up the smudge of lipstick on her mouth – still flushed, still swollen from her performance.</p><p>Her reflection stared back at her – cool, composed, but her eyes burned beneath the surface.</p><p>She could still feel the lingering fire from the stage.</p><p>Still feel Rio’s eyes watching her from the shadows above.</p><p>The door creaked open.</p><p>Soft.</p><p>Deliberate.</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to turn.</p><p>She already knew.</p><p>The click of the lock followed – slow, quiet, final.</p><p>Then silence.</p><p>Her gaze met her reflection’s, steady and unreadable, as Rio appeared behind her in the mirror – dark suit immaculate, obsidian eyes drinking her with quiet, devastating hunger.</p><p>Neither spoke.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Rio stepped closer, slow and smooth, until the heat of her body hovered behind Agatha’s chair – dangerously close but not touching.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled, slow and sharp.</p><p>“Didn’t know you slummed it in dressing rooms still.” She drawled, her voice low and sweet as poison.</p><p>Rio’s chuckle was soft, curling around the room like smoke.</p><p>“Tonight,” Rio murmured, her gaze searing through the mirror, “I decided I wasn’t going to be patient.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse fluttered, but she didn’t blink.</p><p>She kept applying her lipstick – calm, controlled, as if Rio’s standing there, watching her like prey.</p><p>Rio’s voice dipped lower.</p><p>“That dance of yours,” she said, her words gliding over Agatha’s skin like silk and steel, “you’ve been begging for my attention all night.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, her smirk wicked as she capped the lipstick and slowly swiveled in her chair to face Rio fully.</p><p>“Didn’t look like you were suffering.” She taunted, her gaze dragging deliberately down Rio’s frame, lingering on the tailored lines of her suit.</p><p>Rio’s lips curved, dark and knowing.</p><p>Then, without a word, she moved.</p><p>Closing the distance between them in a single, smooth step – her hands bracing on either side of Agatha, caging her in, her body pressed hard enough against Agatha’s back that she could feel it.</p><p>That unmistakable pressure.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>Deliberate.</p><p>Right between them.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched – barely – but her eyes gleamed as she met Rio’s stare, bold and burning.</p><p>She let her thigh shift, slow and deliberate, pressing lightly against it – testing, teasing.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>It was no illusion.</p><p>The hardness beneath that suit was unmistakable.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, her breath catching on a quiet, involuntary exhale – but her smile was slow, feral.</p><p>She tilted her head, voice soft and dripping with dark delight.</p><p>“Handsome,” she purred, dragging the word out like a sin between her teeth. “Is that all for me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened, her gaze molten.</p><p>“For you,” she confirmed, her voice thick, deep, dangerous.</p><p>Her hand slid along Agatha’s jaw, tilting her chin just enough to claim every inch of her attention.</p><p>“You looked too pretty out there,” Rio murmured, her breath ghosting over Agatha’s ear as they made eye contact through the mirror. “All that skin, all that heat… acting like you don’t already belong to me.”</p><p>Her words weren’t loud.</p><p>They didn’t need to be.</p><p>They sank deep, curling around Agatha’s spine.</p><p>The bond between them stretched taut – begging to snap into place.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, but she didn’t pull back.</p><p>She leaned her body against Rio’s instead – slow, daring – her lips brushing the side of her neck, just enough to taunt.</p><p>“Then prove it.” She whispered, her voice low and daring.</p><p>Her hips shifted again, grinding slightly against the hard press between them – teasing, provoking.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched – but only for a heartbeat.</p><p>Then her composure shattered. One hand gripped the back of Agatha’s head by her hair, pushing her to bend over the vanity. The other rested on her hip possessively.</p><p>The mirror reflected everything – the flush on Agatha’s cheeks, the sharp glint in her eyes, and the feral hunger carved across Rio’s face.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Rio rasped, her hands already trailing down Agatha’s body, slow and possessive, fingers teasing the edge of her lingerie.</p><p>Her hips pressing forward, grinding that thick, hard weight against Agatha’s ass – taunting her with the promise of what was coming.</p><p>“I intend too.”</p><p>The mirror framed it all – the flush high on Agatha’s cheeks, the way her breath came quicker, the sharpness of her gaze locked with Rio’s.</p><p>The room was suffocating.</p><p>Rio’s hands dragged slowly down Agatha’s sides, deliberate, commanding, her grip firm enough to bruise if she wanted to.</p><p>And her hips –</p><p>God, her hips.</p><p>Rio landed a sharp smack to Agatha’s ass, ripping a moan from Agatha’s lips. Smiling, dark and possessive, she undid her belt, teasing Agatha’s entrance as she held eye contact.</p><p>“You’re quiet.” Rio murmured, voice a low rasp against Agatha’s ear, her lips brushing soft but dangerous. “That’s not like you.”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft, breathless laugh, defiant even now.</p><p>Her eyes gleamed as she met Rio’s in the mirror, her voice dripping in dark honey.</p><p>“Too busy enjoying the view,” she purred, letting her hips shift, slow and teasing, dragging herself against the hard toy between her and Rio. “You wear it so well.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, but her grip only tightened.</p><p>Agatha smirked, bold and wicked, every inch of her taunt.</p><p>“Handsome.” She added, voice rich with wicked delight, drawing the word out like silk between her teeth.</p><p>That did it.</p><p>Something feral flashed in Rio’s eyes – dark, bottomless, hungry.</p><p>Her restraint snapped as her hips pushed forwards, bottoming out in one go.</p><p>It shoved Agatha forward, ripping a moan from her body as Rio set a rough pace that stole every breath from her lungs.</p><p>“You’ve been pushing all night,” Rio growled, her voice molten, grinding harder, making Agatha gasp against the vanity.</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered, but her smirk never faltered.</p><p>“I like seeing how long you’ll last.” She taunted; her voice breathless but sharp.</p><p>Rio’s hands gripped her hips tighter, her body moving with brutal grace as she rolled her hips deliberately – slow, heavy, deep enough Agatha knew she would feel it for days.</p><p>Agatha’s moans slipped out, head tipping back, her lips parted, eyes dark with heat.</p><p>“You act like you’re in control,” Rio rasped, her voice low and rough against Agatha’s shoulder, dragging her teeth along the skin without biting – yet.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught – but still she pushed back against Rio’s hips, grinding herself harder against her.</p><p>“Then why are you the one shaking?” Agatha moaned out, her words cutting like silk and smoke, her body teasing every inch of Rio’s restraint.</p><p>Rio’s breath stuttered – but her hands never faltered.</p><p>She grabbed Agatha’s wrists, dragging them behind her back in one fluid motion, holding them easily in one hand – pinning her in place.</p><p>Agatha’s chest heaved, but her lips curled in a slow, dangerous smile.</p><p>“Good boy,” She purred, letting the words drip out, thick with mockery and dark delight.</p><p>Rio’s body tensed – sharp, immediate, as if the words struck somewhere deep and primal.</p><p>Agatha could feel it – the shudder, the way Rio’s grip tightened just enough to make her pulse quicken.</p><p>“That’s it, isn’t it?” Agatha whispered, her voice low and viciously sweet, tilting her head just enough to brush her lips near Rio’s ear. “You like it when I call you that.”</p><p>Rio’s growl rumbled deep in her chest – low, guttural, animal.</p><p>She slammed her hips forward, pounding relentless into Agatha with brutal, punishing precision that made Agatha gasp, her body arching in helpless response.</p><p>The sound that toe from Rio’s throat was dark and possessive, her breath hot against Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“You think you’re still in control?” Rio rasped, her voice shaking with hunger, her hands moving to tear the lingerie from her body, baring Agatha to the waist, every touch reverent and rough all at once.</p><p>Agatha’s head tipped back against Rio’s shoulder, breathless but still smiling, her voice shaking with dark glee.</p><p>“I think you love it,” she breathed, rolling her hips in time, dragging sharp, strangled sounds from the vampire’s throat. “You love when I make you break.”</p><p>Rio’s control was hanging by a thread – but she didn’t let go.</p><p>She leaned in, dragging her teeth along Agatha’s throat – close, so close – but no biting.</p><p>“Keep begging for it,” Rio growled, her voice almost trembling with restraint and dark delight. “See what happens.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart thundered.</p><p>The bond between them was molten – burning, suffocating, begging.</p><p>Her breath came faster, her body shaking from the intensity, but her defiance stayed sharp, razor-edged.</p><p>“I always get what I want.” Agatha moaned out, breathless and wrecked – but still pushing.</p><p>Rio’s hands moved again – sliding down her body, rough and reverent, exploring every inch of exposed skin with bruising obsession.</p><p>“Then ask for it,” Rio moaned, her voice molten against Agatha’s skin, every word a dagger. “Say it.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, every nerve ending lit up like wildfire as Rio’s hands gripped her hard, pounding hard with punishing slowness.</p><p>Her pride fought it – but her body craved it.</p><p>The bond seared.</p><p>Her voice crack, but she gasped it out – hoarse, desperate.</p><p>“Bite me.”</p><p>Rio’s movements slowed, almost as if she wasn’t expecting it.</p><p>Agatha met her gaze in the mirror, her eyes dark and wild, her lips swollen and parted as she panted, every inch of her wreck and desperate.</p><p>“Please,” Agatha whispered, the word like a broken prayer, her voice shattering under the weight of it. “Bite me, Rio. I want it.”</p><p>Her plea wasn’t soft.</p><p>It was raw.</p><p>Feral.</p><p>The breaking point.</p><p>Rio’s eyes blackened, something deep and ancient awakening beneath the hunger.</p><p>Her lips curled – sharp and triumphant.</p><p>And her voice, when it came, was low, dark, and full of possession.</p><p>
<strong>“Good girl.”</strong>

<strong>Rio’s POV – 4 Months ago</strong>
</p><p>The bloodwine had gone cold.</p><p>Rio hadn’t touched it since Lilia started talking.</p><p>Not that she was being rude – well, not deliberately. But whatever Lilia was rambling about – supply routes through the northern quarter, something about the Sokolov clan and their fragile egos – none of it could compete with the deadening hum behind Rio’s eyes. A quiet numbness she hadn’t been able to shake in decades.</p><p>Rio leaned back on the velvet couch, her fingers trailing idly along the rim of her glass. Her suit was immaculate, her shirt was unbuttoned just enough to tease at the collarbones carved by the gods that created her. The shadows of the VIP lounge curled around her like worshippers, like pets. And yet… she felt nothing.</p><p>Not boredom.</p><p>Not hunger.</p><p>Just the familiar cold of too many centuries.</p><p>Across from her, Lilia exhaled sharply and crossed her legs. Her slit gown shimmered like emerald oil, and the dagger sharp arch of her brow could have pierced a lesser creature.</p><p>“You could at least pretend to care,” Lilia drawled, waving around her hand.</p><p>Rio’s gaze slid to her, slow and disinterested. “You’re better at pretending.”</p><p>“I’m better at everything,” Lilia said with a smirk. “But that’s not the point.”</p><p>Rio said nothing.</p><p>Lilia gave her a look. “You’re distracted.”</p><p>“No. I’m unimpressed.”</p><p>“With the clans?”</p><p>“With all of it.”</p><p>Lilia lifted her wine to her lips, taking a long sip. “You’ve been listless for too long.”</p><p>Rio’s smile was faint, a curl of smoke. “You say that like it’s a phase.”</p><p>Lilia leaned forward slightly; her voice velvet dark. “You are the original vampire. You could set the world on fire with a whisper. But instead, you sit here every night like you’re waiting for the end.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head.</p><p>“Maybe I am.”</p><p>Lilia went quiet. Her eyes searched Rio’s face, but she found nothing there. No warmth. No want.</p><p>Nothing new.</p><p>Just the quiet, dead weight of immortality. Forced to live in solitude.</p><p>Until –</p><p>Everything changed.</p><p>A breath.</p><p>A shift.</p><p>Not sound. Not sight.</p><p>A pulse.</p><p>There – again.</p><p>It hit her like a slap.</p><p>Quieter than breath. Deeper than a heartbeat.</p><p>Something in the air had changed.</p><p>And then –</p><p>A scent.</p><p>Not blood.</p><p>Not fear.</p><p>Like azaleas and grave dirt.</p><p>The two didn’t belong together. And yet, they were perfectly entwined. Floral and rot. Bloom and decay.</p><p>It licked through the air like smoke from a sacred fire.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Her senses recoiled, then reached – stretched out across the lounge like a predator sniffing the wind.</p><p>She knew this.</p><p>No, not this scent. Not this exact configuration.</p><p>But what it meant.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Hunter blood.</p><p>Not new. Not amateur.</p><p>Legacy.</p><p>And threaded through it like gold in a dying sun – magic.</p><p>Old magic.</p><p>The kind even Rio didn’t taste often anymore. The kind that lived in bones and bloodlines. The kind that whispered spells in its sleep.</p><p>Her eyes snapped to the velvet curtain that divided the VIP lounge from the balcony overlooking the lower floor.</p><p>“Something’s wrong.” She murmured.</p><p>Lilia tensed. “What is it?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer.</p><p>Couldn’t.</p><p>Because the scent had already swallowed her whole.</p><p>She stood in one fluid motion, nearly tipping the wine glass with the force of it.</p><p>Lilia blinked. “Rio?”</p><p>But Rio was already moving.</p><p>The curtain pulled back beneath her fingers.</p><p>And there, down on the floor, lit in the amber glow of the stage –</p><p>She was there.</p><p>At first, she was just a silhouette.</p><p>But Rio’s body reacted before her mind caught up.</p><p>The bond – <em>the bond</em> – snapped like a taut wire. Not complete. Not yet.</p><p>But it <em>begged</em>.</p><p>Real.</p><p>Agonizing.</p><p>The girl stood under the single spotlight, dressed in a dark purple lingerie that clung to her like smoke to a fire, drunk on heat. She didn’t fidget. She didn’t scan the crowd.</p><p>She owned the silence.</p><p>Then she moved.</p><p>Rio’s world narrowed.</p><p>Every flick of her eyes. Every lazy, deliberate swing of her arms. Her hair failing like a wild curling curtain across her shoulder. Her legs parting like she’d been carved pen.</p><p>Not a girl trying to seduce like most dancers that came to audition.</p><p>A woman born to rule every person she laid eyes on.</p><p>And she did.</p><p>The air around Rio cracked like lightning without sound. She gripped the marble railing, her fingernails digging into the stone.</p><p>“She’s… something.” Lilia said behind her, voice lowered.</p><p>Rio didn’t respond.</p><p>Because she couldn’t.</p><p>That scent was in her blood now.</p><p>In her chest.</p><p>In her fangs.</p><p>She could feel the magic in this girl’s bones from up here.</p><p>She could smell the hunter’s lineage – silver-threaded and defiant – but there was no fear.</p><p>None.</p><p>And worse –</p><p>She danced like she knew Rio was watching.</p><p>Like she could feel the weight of her gaze.</p><p>“She’s not afraid,” Rio breathed.</p><p>“She’s brilliant,” Lilia replied, intrigued. “Gods, she might be the next star.”</p><p>Rio leaned further.</p><p>The girl flipped upside down, her thighs catching the pole like it had been made for her, her spine arching, breasts pushing towards the heavens.</p><p>And then –</p><p>She looked up.</p><p>Into the dark.</p><p><em>At her</em>.</p><p>Not directly.</p><p>But Rio felt it.</p><p>That look.</p><p>That smile.</p><p>It undid something inside her.</p><p>
<em>You see me.</em>
</p><p><em>Come claim me</em>.</p><p>Rio’s grip tightened.</p><p>The bond pulsed.</p><p>Not whole. Not complete. This girl was still mortal. The thread between them frayed by life and death.</p><p>But it tugged.</p><p>So hard it felt like bleeding.</p><p>So deep it made Rio dizzy.</p><p>“She smells like danger,” Lilia murmured, sensing something, but not everything.</p><p>Rio’s voice cracked. “She smells like me.”</p><p>The girl one stage – purple wrapping around her like smoke, mouth parted like a spell half-cast – was the first thing Rio had felt in a <em>millennium</em>.</p><p>She felt hunger.</p><p>She felt rage.</p><p>She felt <em>possessive</em>.</p><p>But beneath it all –</p><p>She felt recognized.</p><p>The music wound down.</p><p>The girl curled to the floor, slow and elegant, chest heaving, lips flushed.</p><p>She didn’t bow.</p><p>She waited.</p><p>For what?</p><p><em>For her</em>.</p><p>Lilia looked at Rio, brow raised. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes never left the stage. “Not a ghost,” she said. “A flame I thought I might never see.”</p><p>“Do I need to worry?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio whispered.</p><p>The girl rose.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>The bond trembled.</p><p>And Rio –</p><p>For the first time in a millennium, <em>burned</em>.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>3 Months Ago</strong>
</p><p>“Still ignoring me?” Lilia asked, swirling her wine as she leaned against the balcony railing beside Rio, looking down at the floor below.</p><p>“I’m not ignoring you,” Rio said, her voice low, silk over steel. “I’m tolerating you.”</p><p>Lilia gave a wicked grin. “Be still, my unbeating heart.”</p><p>Rio didn’t smile. Her eyes stayed locked on the crowd below, searching.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>“She’s going on soon,” Lilia said, tone suddenly sharp.</p><p>Rio gave a slow nod. She didn’t need the reminder. Every inch of her was already tuned to the moment Raven stepped onstage. The scent was already there – just faint, a tease of something lush and haunted.</p><p>Fire. Death. Magic. Blood.</p><p>A contradiction. Something beautiful growing out of something ruined.</p><p>It always hit first like scent – but it wasn’t her perfume. It was older. Older than the girl could possibly be. A pulse that didn’t match the club’s thumping speakers.</p><p>It hit Rio like the taste of a spell she wasn’t supposed to remember.</p><p>“She’s more than a dancer,” Rio murmured, half to herself.</p><p>“She’s a storm,” Lilia said. “And you’ve been staring at her like you’re waiting to drown.”</p><p>Before Rio could answer, the door to the private lounge opened behind them.</p><p>Boots.</p><p>Confident.</p><p>Quick.</p><p>Familiar.</p><p>Alice.</p><p>Rio didn’t turn. “Well?”</p><p>“She’s prepping in the dressing room,” Alice said, her voice low and clipped. “Black lace tonight.”</p><p>“That’s not what I meant.”</p><p>Alice joined them at the railing, her all-black outfit – half tactical gear, half catwalk ready – hugging her like armor. Her red and black streaked hair pulled tight; her knives sheathed at her thighs.</p><p>“Nothing suspicious yet,” she said. “But she’s alert. Watchful. She carries herself like someone trained.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes cut sharp. “You think she’s here to kill you?”</p><p>“No.” Rio murmured. “If she was, she would’ve tried.”</p><p>“She might be waiting for something.” Alice said. “Or someone.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw ticked. “She wouldn’t be the first hunter to walk through my doors.”</p><p>“She’d would be the first to make you hesitate.”</p><p>Lilia raised a brow. “You’re slipping.”</p><p>Rio snarled at that straightening her posture as she stood.</p><p>Alice tensed slightly. Lilia smiled.</p><p>Only old friends could get away with saying it.</p><p>Rio didn’t look at them. She didn’t need to. because the lights were shifting now – amber bleeding across the stage like dusk falling too fast.</p><p>And there she was.</p><p>That little hunter. A flame in black lace.</p><p>She stepped into the spotlight, hips rolling like slow sin, legs encased in glitter and command. She didn’t perform like someone begging to be seen.</p><p>She danced like she owned every eye.</p><p>“Is she smiling up here?”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, “She’s daring me to come down.”</p><p>Agatha arched, her hands dragging over her ribs, her head rolling back as the stage lights kissed her throat.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>Lilia studied her carefully. “You feel it, don’t you?”</p><p>Rio didn’t reply.</p><p>“The bond.” Lilia added. “But it’s incomplete.”</p><p>“She’s mortal,” Alice said, “It shouldn’t even exist.”</p><p>“But it does,” Lilia murmured.</p><p>“It aches.” Rio admitted, whispering it.</p><p>They were silent a beat too long.</p><p>Rio’s hand tightened on the railing as Raven flipped over, thighs locked, her spine a long curve of temptation. She was wrapped in black like smoke clinging to the wind, ad her ace – gods that face – was set in serene focus.</p><p>“Her scent,” Rio said hoarsely. “It’s like flowers and death and like someone lit incense at a funeral.”</p><p>The music deepened. The woman dropped into a slow spin, descending from the pile like smoke.</p><p>And then –</p><p>She looked up again.</p><p>Not directly.</p><p>But Rio felt it.</p><p>The bond begged for her to complete it.</p><p>Impossible to ignore.</p><p>Just for a second, Agatha’s smile sharpened like a blade.</p><p><em>She sees me</em>.</p><p>“Do it,” Lilia said.</p><p>“No,” Rio murmured.</p><p>“She’s a spark.” Lilia pressed, “And you’re sitting in a room made of matches.”</p><p>Rio’s lips barely parted. “That’s why I can’t.”</p><p>“Bullshit,” Alice said, arms folded. “You’ve waiting longer than anyone in here has been alive to feel something. Don’t waste it because it scares you.”</p><p>Agatha dropped to her knees below, head tilted, chest rising. The room watched her like worshippers at a sermon.</p><p>“She’ll ruin me,” Rio said softly.</p><p>“You were already ruined,” Alice said. “Let her make it worth it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak again.</p><p>She watched the end of the dance in silence, every second of it etching itself behind her eyes. Her breath, her posture, the way she turned her back on the crowd like she was above them all.</p><p>And maybe she was.</p><p>Rio rose from her seat.</p><p>Alice glanced up. “Where are you going?”</p><p>“To write a letter,” Rio said.</p><p>Lilia smirked. “Summoning her like royalty?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said, already walking towards her private office. “Summoning her like a starving woman finally admitting she wants to eat.”</p><p>**</p><p>
<strong>Rio’s POV – Present</strong>
</p><p>Agatha’s voice cracked like thunder inside Rio’s skull.</p><p>“Bite me, Rio. I want it.”</p><p>The words curled around Rio’s ribs, sank into her spine, and shattered everything.</p><p>Not just desire.</p><p>Not just control.</p><p><em>Everything</em>.</p><p>Her name on Agatha’s lips. Her permission – no, her plea – was enough to drop Rio straight into the oldest part of herself.</p><p>That part buried beneath centuries of restraint.</p><p>The part that wanted.</p><p>And the bond – gods, the bond.</p><p>It pulsed like a second heart inside her chest. It burned where their skin touched. Where Agatha’s hips pressed against hers. Where her lips had just breathed a prayer meant only for monsters.</p><p>Rio leaned in, her lips brushing Agatha’s pulse point. That perfect, delicate neck – glowing with heat, flushed from Rio’s doing, scent soaked in sweat and fire and flowers.</p><p>She didn’t speak.</p><p>She didn’t ask again.</p><p>She just sank in.</p><p>Fangs pierced flesh like silk tearing. Clean. Deep.</p><p>And Agatha gasped – not from pain.</p><p>From something deeper.</p><p>Something brighter.</p><p>Her back arched violently, her body trembling as the venom hit her bloodstream.</p><p>Not turning her.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>This was different.</p><p>This was pleasure.</p><p>Rio moaned into the bite as Agatha writhed beneath her. The taste –</p><p><em>Gods</em>.</p><p>It was everything.</p><p>Wild. Ancient. Sweet. Sharp.</p><p>It tasted like spells cast in blood, like wildflowers blooming in a graveyard, like fire eating through velvet.</p><p>She fed slow, reverent.</p><p>Each pull of blood more sacred than the last.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched; caught on every sound she’d tried to swallow. Her body ground against Rio’s, seeking friction even as it surrendered completely.</p><p>“Fuck,” she gasped, voice half broken, half lost in euphoria.</p><p>Rio’s hands gripped her tighter, her thumb brushing the curve of her waist in time with every stroke of her tongue.</p><p>She could feel it – Agatha’s body giving in, letting go, collapsing into something beyond touch.</p><p>The venom rolled through her, lighting every nerve like gold on fire.</p><p>And Rio felt it.</p><p>The way Agatha’s heartbeat raced and slowed and surged again.</p><p>The way her breath stuttered in soft, shatter moans.</p><p>The way her body begged for more – not out of need, but devotion.</p><p>This wasn’t just feeding.</p><p>It wasn’t even sex anymore.</p><p>It was something so unholy it would burn them both.</p><p>Rio pulled back slowly, fangs slipping free with a wet sound that made Agatha whimper. Her lips were red. Stained. Glossed with the blood of the woman that was fated to her.</p><p>She met Agatha’s eyes in the mirror.</p><p>What stared back at her almost ruined her.</p><p>Eyes glassy. Cheeks flushed. Lips parted. Still trembling.</p><p>But even now – <em>still defiant</em>.</p><p>“I said,” Agatha rasped, voice low and shaking, “fuck me like you mean it.”</p><p>Rio growled.</p><p>Low. Reverent. Possessive.</p><p>And then she obeyed.</p><p>With every thrust, she kept one hand tangled in Agatha’s hair, dragging her back against her chest, forcing her to watch herself in the mirror.</p><p>She whispered against the bite mark – still bleeding faintly.</p><p>“My good girl,” she purred. “So sweet for me… so perfect…”</p><p>Agatha shuddered.</p><p>“Say it again,” Rio growled, pounding harder, deeper, until the vanity shook beneath their bodies. “Say you are mine.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth parted, but no sound came.</p><p>Just a moan – high, needy, wrecked.</p><p>Rio grinned against her throat.</p><p>“Mine,” She whispered. “Every inch of you.”</p><p>Agatha let go – completely – head falling back, hands gripping Rio’s arms like anchors.</p><p>She was shaking. Drenched in sweat. Soaked through the arousal.</p><p>And still, Rio didn’t stop.</p><p>Not until Agatha screamed.</p><p>Not until her climax tore through her like wildfire and left her sagging, gasping, half-collapsed against the vanity.</p><p>Only then did Rio slow.</p><p>Her hands softened.</p><p>Her hips gentled.</p><p>And her mouth – her bloodstained mouth – kissed the nape of Agatha’s neck like an oath.</p><p>“You, okay?” she murmured, holding Agatha against her.</p><p>Agatha gave the barest nod, eyes still closed, body still trembling.</p><p>The silence in the dressing room was heavy with spent desire.</p><p>Agatha lay half draped over the velvet lined vanity, her breath shallow, her legs still shaking. Her skin glowed with the aftermath – of the bite, of the venom, of the sex that had left her undone.</p><p>But it was the look in her eyes – half lidded, dazed, soft – that caught Rio in the throat.</p><p>That broke something deep in her.</p><p>She pulled out carefully turning Agatha to face her, tucking a hand under her knees and the other around her back.</p><p>“You’re trembling.” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha blinked once. “You’re the one who bit me.”</p><p>There was no heat in it. Just softness. Honesty.</p><p>“I’m taking you out of here,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “You don’t…”</p><p>Before she could protest, Rio was already lifting her – effortlessly, as if her body weighed nothing.</p><p>Agatha’s words faltered as she curled into the vampire chest.</p><p>It was the way Rio held her.</p><p>Not possessive. Not arrogant.</p><p><em>Careful</em>.</p><p>As if she was made of glass.</p><p>As f Rio had broken things she couldn’t bear to lose again.</p><p>The club’s corridors were quiet, bathed in low gold light and lined with black marble. Alice was the only one waiting by the back door when they passed. She said nothing, but her eyes lingered on the two of them – on the curve of Agatha’s arms around Rio’s neck, on the way Rio’s jaw stayed clenched too tight to speak.</p><p>Then the shadows of the world swallowed them whole.</p><p>**</p><p>
<strong>Agatha’s POV</strong>
</p><p>The sheets were too soft.</p><p>That was the first thing she noticed.</p><p>Not the heat between her legs or the ache in her thighs or the place on her neck that still hummed like it remembered teeth.</p><p>Not even the cold side of the bed next to her.</p><p>No – first, it was the absurd, almost decadent softness of the sheets.</p><p>Her fingers curled in them instinctively as her mind swam back towards consciousness.</p><p>The second thing she noticed: the silence.</p><p>Not nightclub silence. Not the hush between songs or the muffled backstage bassline.</p><p>This was natural silence. Vast. Deep. Broken only by the low percussion of rain on a roof and the occasional growl of thunder echoing through the distance.</p><p>She sat up slowly, dragging the blanket with her.</p><p>The bed was huge – obscene, really. Mahogany carved posts, silky green sheets, and a comforter heavy enough to quiet a scream.</p><p>The windows – from floor to ceiling – were slightly fogged, showing just enough of the world outside.</p><p>Pine trees. Dozens. Maybe thousands.</p><p>The forest outside was dark and wet, cloaked in mist and rain, like something out of a fairy tale people didn’t survive.</p><p>She blinked, heart ticking up a notch.</p><p>Where the hell –</p><p>A flash of a memory.</p><p>
<em>Lips. Fangs. A bite that made her see stars. Rio’s hands holding her down. Her voice murmuring “Good Girl” against skin that had never burned like that before.</em>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>She pushed the covers back and slid out of bed, her bare feet touching polished wood planks that were warm underfoot.</p><p>She wasn’t wearing much – just an oversized black t-shirt that definitely wasn’t hers and smelled faintly of dirt and pine trees. Rio’s scent.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>She took stock of the room as she moved. It was rustic, almost shockingly so. Not what she expected from a vampire who ran the most dangerous underground club in New York City.</p><p>The walls were timber. The floors dark and glossy. Shelves lined one side of the room, filled with old books and older artifacts – daggers, stone tokens, iron rings that pulsed faintly with magic.</p><p>A fireplace cold and empty on the far wall, and there were thick velvet curtains over a door that probably led to a balcony.</p><p>The whole place was… warm. Lived in. Real.</p><p>She wasn’t sure what unsettled her more – that she liked it, or that she could imagine herself here longer than a night.</p><p>She found the hallway after a few quiet steps and followed the smell that had just started teasing her senses.</p><p>Bacon. Eggs. Rosemary. Coffee.</p><p>The kitchen opened like a dream – massive windows looking out over the rainy forest, mist curling against the gals. Cast Iron pans on the stove. Mismatched mugs drying in a rack. A wood-burning stove oven against one wall. A long table in the center, scarred and beautiful.</p><p>And at the stove, barefoot in black slack and a loose gray sweater, hair pulled back, eyes focused –</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>She hadn’t heard her once.</p><p>Rio looked softer like this – still sharp-edged, but in a way that felt dangerously domestic. She was stirring eggs with one hand, a steaming mug already poured beside her. The coffee pot hissed low behind her, thunder rolling faintly overhead.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p>Rio turned.</p><p>Her expression barely shifted, but something flickered behind her eyes. Relief, maybe. Hunger.</p><p>Something more ancient.</p><p>“You’re awake.” Rio said simply.</p><p>“You cook?” Agatha asked, arms folding over her chest.</p><p>“I do other things, too,” Rio replied, the corner of her mouth twitching. “Want a list?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her lips twitched. “Thought vampires didn’t eat mortal food.”</p><p>“Surprise,” Rio said with a smile. “This is for you.”</p><p>She gestured toward the second mug. “Coffee. Black. Two sugars. I guessed.”</p><p>Agatha stepped forward and took a sip, trying not to flinch at how perfect it was.</p><p>She leaned against the counter. “You kidnapped me.”</p><p>“I carried you out because you could barely walk.”</p><p>“Same difference.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look at her.</p><p>She kept stirring the eggs like it wasn’t a war in her chest.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to ask the question.</p><p>She didn’t want to make the moment anything more fragile than it already was.</p><p>But it was there, in the space between them. In the warmth of the kitchen. In the smell of rosemary and rain and the lingering sting of fangs in her throat.</p><p>She met Rio’s gaze and asked softly, “Why did you bring me here?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer at first.</p><p>She just looked at her – long and quiet, like she was trying to pick her words out of the mist still rising off the forest outside.</p><p>“Because” Rio said, “You are my fated.”</p><p>The words landed between them with the weight of something old. Something inevitable.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Fated,” she repeated. “That’s a bit dramatic.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curved amusement playing at her face.</p><p>“It’s not drama. It’s what we are,” she said, her voice low, steady. “The bond hasn’t snapped into place yet – because you’re still mortal. But it’s there. It’s been there since the second your scent invaded my senses.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, something tight blooming in her chest. “You smelled me?”</p><p>Rio let out a breath – more a chuckle than exhale.</p><p>“You walked on stage in that ridiculous black lace,” she said, her eyes softening with something just shy of a smile, “and I smelled… fire. And flowers, but deadly ones. And dirt after a fresh rain. And I knew I was fucked.”</p><p>Agatha looked down into her coffee mug. “That’s… poetic.”</p><p>Rio leaned against the counter, folding her arms.</p><p>“It’s not. It’s torture.”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up.</p><p>Rio met her gaze, unflinching. “The bond is driving me insane.”</p><p>She said it so casually, so plainly, like she wasn’t unravelling at the seams.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “How?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “I can feel you when you’re not in the room. When you’re dancing, my fangs ache. When you laugh backstage, I hear it over everything else. I wake up and check my clothes to see if your scent still clings to them.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her.</p><p>“And now?” she asked softly.</p><p>Rio’s voice didn’t shake. “Now I bring you coffee and make you eggs and pretend I don’t want to devour you all over again.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed. “You’re really bad at pretending.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said. “Because I’m not going to stop pretending, I don’t care. But I also am not going to say it.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Say what?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes gleamed, dark and ancient and unbearably tender.</p><p>“Not yet.”</p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p>Then Agatha lifted her mug, smirking. “So, I’m your fated. And you cook.”</p><p>“Don’t spread it around,” Rio murmured, straight-faced. “I have a reputation to protect.”</p><p>Agatha smiled behind the rim of her mug.</p><p>And outside, the storm rolled on.</p><p>Inside, for just a few minutes longer, the kitchen stayed warm.</p><p>And quiet.</p><p>And not quite love – but something dangerously close.</p><p> </p><p>The fire cracked softly, casting golden light across the deep cedar walls and the plush wool rug sprawled in front of the hearth. Agatha lay curled at one end of the couch, legs tucked beneath her, a throw blanket pulled over her lap. Rio stretched beside her, head pillowed gently in Agatha’s lap, one arm draped lazily over the edge of the couch, the other resting across her own ribcage.</p><p>Outside, the storm continued, distant thunder echoing through the trees like an ancient drumbeat. Rain slid down the broad windows, painting shadows in long streaks of silver across the walls. The whole cabin smelled like pine and woodsmoke and the faintest trace of cinnamon from breakfast.</p><p>They hadn’t spoken much in the last hour – just occasional glances, small, wordless touches. But something had shifted.</p><p>Rio tilted her head a little, cheek pressing against Agatha’s thigh. “You’re quiet.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look away from the fire. “Just thinking.”</p><p>“Dangerous,” Rio murmured with a smile.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, brushing a hand absently through Rio’s hair. It was softer than she expected. Still damp from the shower, smelling faintly of cedar soup.</p><p>“I’m not the one who brought a girl home after biting her and then made her pancakes.”</p><p>Rio chuckled low in her chest. “Would’ve made waffles, but I didn’t trust your mortal heart wouldn’t give out from the decadence.”</p><p>“That’s funny,” Agatha said dryly, “because I distinctly remember you not caring about my mortal heart when you were wrecking me against that mirror.”</p><p>Rio opened one eye, the amber burning a little brighter. “Ah, so that’s what’s bothering you. Regret?”</p><p>“no.” Agatha said honestly. “Just… recalibrating.”</p><p>There was a quiet beat.</p><p>Rio’s smile faded. “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers paused for a moment in her hair, then resumed. She looked down at the vampire in her lap and searched her face.</p><p>“Have you ever turned someone?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Straight to the hard stuff, huh?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged one shoulder. “It’s been on my mind.”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, sitting up just enough to brace herself on one elbow, eyes locked with Agatha’s.</p><p>“I haven’t,” she said softly. “Not once. Not in all the centuries I’ve been alive.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Seriously?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “It’s not… I don’t take it lightly.”</p><p>“I figured with how old you are, you’d have turned like, half a dozen lovers.”</p><p>Rio laughed, warm and surprised. “Is that your way of calling me ancient?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I mean, you probably predate democracy.”</p><p>Rio gave a playful growl and dropped her head back onto Agatha’s ap with dramatic flair, nipping at the bare skin there. “Cruel little mortal. I should bite you again for that.”</p><p>“You could try,” Agatha teased, but I think my thighs would kill you first.”</p><p>They shared a soft laugh, the warmth folding over them like the firelight.</p><p>But then Rio turned serious again, her voice gentling.</p><p>“I meant what I said. I’ve never done this before. Any of it.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, brushing a lock of hair away from Rio’s temple. “Done what? Brought someone here?”</p><p>“Yeah. That too.” Rio paused. “But I mean this. Laying here. Talking. Letting someone in.”</p><p>The confession hung between them like mist, delicate and sincere.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened slightly. “Not once?”</p><p>“I’ve had flings,” Rio said. “Connections. Powerful ones, even. But this? It’s different.”</p><p>“Because of the bond?”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “Because of you.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her. “And what if I don’t want to be turned?”</p><p>Rio held her gaze for a long, long moment. “Then I’ll live with that.”</p><p>Agatha studied her. “You say that like it is easy.”</p><p>“It’s not.” Rio’s voice was quiet. “The bond – its’ like a thread strung between us. Taut. Singing. I feel it every time you breathe. It’s only half-formed now, but it’s still there. Pulling at me. Whispering your name in my chest.”</p><p>“Does it hurt?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p>“Not in the way you think.” Rio’s lips curved faintly. “It’s not pain. It’s longing. It’s… the sense that something’s just out of reach. That you’re mine, but not fully.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Her hand stilled in Rio’s hair.</p><p>“I don’t know what I want,” She whispered.</p><p>“That’s okay.” Rio’s voice was a murmur, full of tenderness Agatha hadn’t expected. “You don’t have to decide now. Or ever.”</p><p>“I thought I’d come here to kill you,” Agatha said suddenly. Her voice didn’t tremble, but her fingers curled faintly where they rested on Rio’s shoulder. “I told myself I’d find out what you were planning, that I’d get close and wait for the opening.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said quietly. “I knew what you were the moment I scented you.”</p><p>“Then why let me in?”</p><p>Rio leaned her head back to rest more fully in Agatha’s lap again, gaze tracing the arch of her collarbone.</p><p>“Because” she said, “you’re my fated. It was worth it to me. Just to be near you. And the bone… it’s driving me insane.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>Rio looked up at her with raw honesty in her gaze. “You feel it too. I know you do.”</p><p>Agatha looked away, her throat working. “I’m not ready.”</p><p>“I’m not asking you to be.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a while. The storm outside had softened into a steady rhythm, rain whispering through the pine needles like a lullaby.</p><p>Agatha reached for the throw blanket and pulled it higher over both of them, tucking Rio more securely against her lap.</p><p>“You always this dramatic?” she asked lightly.</p><p>“Rio smiled into her thigh. “Only when I am madly obsessed with a hunter trying to kill me by calling me <em>handsome </em>when she’s trying to make me lose my mind.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed slightly, but she smirked.</p><p>“Well,” she said, brushing her fingers through Rio’s hair again, “you make a pretty good pillow.”</p><p>“I’ve been told I excel at being under you.”</p><p>Agatha gave a snort of laughter. “You’re insatiable.”</p><p>“And you’re irresistible,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha sighed through a reluctant smile.</p><p>“What is it?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>Agatha hesitated; her gaze fixed on the flames.</p><p>For a moment, Rio didn’t think she’d answer.</p><p>But then – barely above a whisper, like it cost her something to say it – Agatha murmured, “She tried to kill me.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Who?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice dropped even lower. “My mother.”</p><p>The room stilled.</p><p>Rio sat slowly, no longer resting in Agatha’s lap, but beside her, facing her, legs crossed beneath her. She didn’t touch her. Not yet. Not until she knew it was okay.</p><p>Agatha stared into the fire like it might erase the memory if she looked hard enough.</p><p>“She was a hunter. Not just any hunter – she came from one of the oldest lines. Revered. Respected. Feared.” Her mouth twisted. “And obsessed. Obsessed with purity. With power. With the idea that we were born to kill monsters, and that anything less was weakness.”</p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed; her jaw clenched tight. “She hurt you.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a bitter laugh. “That’s putting it lightly.”</p><p>“Tell me.” Rio said softly, but with an edge in her voice – something sharp and dangerous simmering just beneath the velvet.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked to her.</p><p>“I trained from the moment I could hold a knife. No toys. No friends. Just silver, salt, and discipline. I didn’t ask questions. Didn’t push. I wanted her approval more than anything. And then, when I was sixteen, I hesitated.”</p><p>Rio was still. Listening.</p><p>“There was a vampire girl. She couldn’t have been more than seventeen when she was turned. Alone. Starving. Weak. I stopped my mother from killing her.” Agatha’s voice was thin now.” Just for a second.”</p><p>“And that was enough?” Rio asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>“She said I was born evil. That she should have killed me the moment I left her body. The bloodline had failed. She dragged me to the ritual chamber and locked the door. Said she was going to burn it out of me.”</p><p>Rio’s fists clenched where they rested against her thighs.</p><p>“I escaped,” Agatha said. “Barely. I took the dagger she gave me when I was initiated with and ran. But it was also the reason I came after you.”</p><p>Rio’s voice was low, strained, dangerous. “Is she still alive?”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly. “Last I heard, she went underground. She’s been quiet. But I know she’s out there.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, but it sounded more like a growl. “If she ever comes near you again, I’ll kill her myself.”</p><p>Agatha looked over, startled – not by the words, but by the conviction in them.</p><p>Rio’s expression was unreadable, but her eyes burned with something primal.</p><p>“You’re mine,” Rio said, voice thick. “No one lays a hand on you. Not even your past.”</p><p>Agatha blinked – something sharp stinging at the edges of her vision.</p><p>“You don’t even know me,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened just enough.</p><p>“I know you carry fire and shadows in equal measure. I know your laugh is real even when your smile is fake. I know you haven’t stopped watching the windows since we got here, like you’re still waiting to be hunted.” She paused. “And I know that if your mother ever comes back, I’ll make her regret everything she ever did to you.”</p><p>A tear slipped down Agatha’s cheek before she could stop it. She swiped it away quickly, trying to turn her face – but Rio caught her chin gently and turned it back.</p><p>“No hiding,” Rio murmured. “Not with me.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>And then she whispered, almost too quiet to hear. “She said love was weakness.”</p><p>Rio leaned in until their foreheads touched, her breath ghosting over Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“She lied.”</p><p>They sat like that for a long moment, the fire crackling, the storm a hush beyond the walls. Agatha’s breath slowed, her shoulders easing for the first time in what felt like years.</p><p>Rio finally pulled back just enough to meet her eyes.</p><p>“You’re safe now.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled – deep and shaking. “Are you sure?”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “I’d stake the rest of my long, endless life on it.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly – wet, bitter, real.</p><p>“That’s a hell of a thing to promise.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers brushed the tear track on her cheek. “I don’t make promises lightly.”</p><p>Agatha watched her for a long moment, then reached up and cupped Rio’s face in both hands, thumbs tracing the sharp line of her jaw.</p><p>“I don’t know what this is yet,” she said softly. “But I don’t want to run from it.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened, but her voice stayed low.</p><p>“Then stay.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in until their lips brushed – just the barest graze.</p><p>“I will.”</p><p> </p><p>The backstage dressing room of The Coven smelled like lavender oil, warm skin, and faint traces of spilled absinthe. The buzz of curling irons and whispered laughter mingled with low-tempo house music drifting in from the main floor. Velvet robes rustled. Glitter clung to every surface.</p><p>Agatha stood at her usual mirror, haunted by the things Rio had done to her against said mirror, methodically pinning up the last strands of her dark hair. She wore her ritual calm like a second skin – serene, unreadable, lethal in heels. Black lingerie’s wrapped around her like vines, the corset laced so tight it looked carved into her. The dark plum lipstick she dragged across her mouth gleamed like bloodwine.</p><p>She sat before her vanity, one leg crossed over the other, a soft smile tugging at the corner of her lips as she dabbed highlighter onto her collarbone. The music from the floor echoed faintly through the walls, but all she could feel was <em>her</em>.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>The bond was growing. No longer a whisper, but a slow, curling heat under her ribs. She didn’t need to see her to truly feel her anymore – just the thought of Rio sent a tingle through her chest, something warm and sharp, like the hum of electricity before a storm. It made her thighs clench. Made her heart ache.</p><p>She’d told herself she could play both sides. That she could earn back her mother’s legacy, wear being a hunter like a second skin while slipping into Rio’s world like silk.</p><p>But the more time was passing, the more her center titled.</p><p>Toward Rio.</p><p>Toward the way she looked at her like the world had ever offered her anything worth craving – until now.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, exhaling slow.</p><p>She was falling for her monster.</p><p>And she didn’t want to stop, her mother be damned.</p><p>Behind her, a familiar click of platform boots announced trouble.</p><p>“Okay. Rave. Babe. Goddess,” Wanda drawled, flopping dramatically into the chair next to her. Her robe slouched off one shoulder, revealing shimmering crimson straps beneath. “I need you to say yes.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow without turning. “To what, exactly?”</p><p>“A joint number,” Wanda said, fluttering her lashes like it was obvious. “Us. Together. Again. On stage.”</p><p>Agatha set her lipstick down. “Last time we did that, I had to slap your thigh and pretend I was going to bite you in front of a bridal party.”</p><p>“And we made over twenty grand in tips,” Wanda shot back, propping one leg on the vanity like a siren mid-song. “Twenty. Grand. You want me to repeat that?”</p><p>Agatha turned, finally facing her, arms crossed beneath her bust. “Yeah, but I walked off stage with glitter under my tongue and a torn garter.”</p><p>“Correction,” Wanda said, grinning like a wolf. “You walked off the stage like a goddamn religion.” A short pause. “Plus, you got some very wanted attention.”</p><p>Agatha tried to hide her smirk, but it tugged at the corners of her mouth anyway. You just want to ride my lap again.”</p><p>Wanda clutched her chest, scandalized. “How dare you accuse me of such honesty.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and sighed, leaning back in her chair stretching, “Why now?”</p><p>“Because it’s Saturday. Because my solo crowd’s getting stale. And” Wanda leaned in closer, dropping her voice, “because when you and I share a set, the room stops breathing.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a long second.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes glittered – sincere now, underneath the mischief. “Come on Raven. You know it’s magic when we dance together.”</p><p>“You mean chaos.” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>“Same thing.”</p><p>Agatha turned back to the mirror, running a fingertip down the hollow of her throat, inspecting the way the shimmer caught on her collarbones.</p><p>“I’m doing my solo at midnight.” She spoke.</p><p>“Right. Your ‘smoke and sex and secret identity’ set,” Wanda teased. “Perfect. You open with that, and then the two of us burn the place down right after.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a sidelong glance. “You just want a front-row seat to the balcony watching.”</p><p>Wanda’s grin widened. “Guilty. But seriously – think about it. We build it slow. One char, one lap. You come out first, all dangerous and dark. I play sweet and smitten. Then you flip the dynamic halfway through. Throw me down. Straddle me. Make them scream.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched. “You’ve clearly rehearsed this in your head.”</p><p>“Every night since the last time,” Wanda said. “You were born for center stage, Raven. I just want to orbit a little.”</p><p>There was something honest in her tone now – almost reverent.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Fine.”</p><p>Wanda blinked. “What. Did you just -?”</p><p>“You get ten minutes. One song. My choice. You stay on rhythm and off my neck.”</p><p>Wanda squealed like she’d just won a bidding war for sin. “Deal.”</p><p>Agatha raised a warning brow. “And if you grind too high again, I will leave you on the stage with your tits out.”</p><p>Wanda made a Solem X over her chest. “Scout’s honor.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You were never a scout.”</p><p>Wanda winked. “No, but I’m great at tying knots.”</p><p>They both laughed.</p><p>Lilia’s voice cut in from the doorway, holding a clipboard under her usual cool stare. “I assume this chaos is going on the schedule?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “One duet. After my solo.”</p><p>Lilia scribbled something now. “I’ll notify sound. Raven you’re still on at midnight. Wanda, fifteen after. You’re lucky Rio likes you both.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse jumped slightly at the name, but she kept her expression smooth.</p><p>Wanda leaned over, stage-whispering to Agatha. “Did you hear what she said?” Likes me. That means I won’t die before spring.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled.</p><p>As Lilia disappeared back down the hall, Wanda gave Agatha a softer look – playful but not mocking.</p><p>“You’ve been good for this place,” she said. “Whether you meant to or not.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at the sincerity in her voice. “I’m not here to fix anything.”</p><p>“I know,” Wanda said, standing. “That’s what makes it work.”</p><p>And with that, she was gone – disappearing into a cloud of perfume and crimson.</p><p>Agatha stared at the empty mirror for a long moment.</p><p>Then she reached for her lipstick again.</p><p> </p><p>The lights dimmed, drowning the club in velvet silence.</p><p>A bass line slithered in like smoke – low, grinding, unmistakable. The opening notes of Six-Inch Heels licked the walls, slow and menacing. It wasn’t music so much as a pulse – dangerous and slow, like something that threatened to creep up your spine.</p><p>The stage lit in blood-red, a throne in the middle of it.</p><p>And then Agatha stepped around it.</p><p>Tall. Poised. Drenched in shadow, wearing sheer black and emerald lace that clung to her curves like vines with intention. Her heels hit the floor like punctuation marks. Her hair swept in a low arc around her shoulders as she moved forward, every step carved from seduction and control.</p><p>Wanda stepped around the other side of the throne, perching herself on it. She wore a crimson mesh and thigh high leather heels, legs crossed, mouth curled in that smirk of hers that dared the room to disobey.</p><p>But it wasn’t Wanda the crowd watched.</p><p>It was Agatha.</p><p>Always Agatha.</p><p>Because the way she walked wasn’t for the mortals lining the velvet rail, or the vampires in their private booths.</p><p>It was for one.</p><p>She knew exactly where Rio was.</p><p>She could feel her.</p><p>The bond sang with pressure and fire, tugging like invisible threads that shimmered with want. And Agatha answered it the only way she knew how – through movement, through heat.</p><p>Through power.</p><p>She didn’t smile.</p><p>Didn’t wink.</p><p>Didn’t need to.</p><p>Because when she moved – slow, deliberate, stepping one leg over the other like the air itself bent for her – it was worship. Violence wrapped in rhythm.</p><p>Six-inch heels.</p><p>She dropped her weight to her hips, rolled her body like smoke, then rose again in one long fluid arc that made the lights kiss every inch of her skin.</p><p>Wanda stood.</p><p>Her eyes sparkled like fire opals, but even she didn’t reach for Agatha. She just leaned back against the throne, letting Agatha stalk towards her.</p><p>The beat dropped.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers found Wanda’s shoulders and pushed her back into the throne with effortless grace. She swung one leg over Wanda’s lap and sank down – not straddling, not riding, but owning.</p><p>Her back arched. One hand slid behind her own neck. The other grazed between the swell of her breasts. She didn’t grind. She writhed.</p><p>Like a spell being cast in flesh.</p><p>Wanda’s hands went to her thighs, gripping instinctively, but not daring to move further.</p><p>Because this wasn’t for her either.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, brushed her lips close to Wanda’s ear, whispered something – but her eyes never left the dark above the balcony.</p><p>Where Rio watched.</p><p>Where Rio burned.</p><p>And Agatha performed.</p><p>The lap dance wasn’t a dance at all. It was a claiming. She moved like a serpent, grinding slow and deep on Wanda’s lap, but her gaze was locked somewhere else entirely – on a hidden silhouette above, on the ancient one who hadn’t taken her eyes off her once.</p><p>Agatha dragged her fingers down her ribs, then lifted them to Wanda’s jaw, tilting her head, exposing her throat like a mirror of submission.</p><p>But it wasn’t real.</p><p>She was in control.</p><p>Every brush of her thighs, every sway of her spine, every roll of her hips – Agatha painted pleasure like a weapon.</p><p>The bond between her and Rio twisted tight with heat. She could feel it throbbing just beneath her skin, reacting to every sinuous motion, every whispered lyric.</p><p>And Rio –</p><p>Agatha could<em> feel</em> her.</p><p>Could almost taste the way her breath had caught.</p><p>How the bond crackled, ravenous.</p><p>A low, teasing smirk pulled at Agatha’s mouth. She dragged one hand slowly down her own inner thigh, as though touching herself just to show Rio what she wanted.</p><p>Then she twisted around in Wanda’s lap – face to face, her back arched, dragging over Wanda’s thighs as she bent forward.</p><p>Her hair spilled across her shoulder.</p><p>Her breath fogged the air.</p><p>And when she rolled her hips again, she knew what it looked like from the balcony – knew what it felt like, to be unable to touch but forced to watch.</p><p>Agatha threw her head back, gasping as she ran her hands up her torso, palms flat against the heat of her stomach and breasts. She was lost in it now. Not just dancing.</p><p>Channeling.</p><p>The hunger. The lust. The want.</p><p>Not just hers.</p><p>Rio’s.</p><p>The song wound down into something molten and slow.</p><p>Agatha stood up, reaching for the pole in front of the throne. Her body stretched long as she stood, grinding once more against Wanda with a sigh that trembled between indulgence and cruelty.</p><p>Then, slow as silk over skin, she turned.</p><p>Faced the crowd.</p><p>Faced<em> her</em>.</p><p>Agatha didn’t smile.</p><p>She didn’t bow.</p><p>She just walked away – hips swaying like a secret, the set lights flickering behind her as if the stage exhaled.</p><p>Wanda was still seated, wrecked and flushed.</p><p>And Agatha?</p><p>She walked like she was on fire.</p><p>Because she was.</p><p>She was burning.</p><p>And she was going to find Rio.</p><p>The hallway outside the mainstage pulsed with residual bass, shadows curling in the crimson-tinted light. Agatha’s skin still hummed from the performance, each nerve ending charged and alert. She moved like she was still dancing – like her hips remembered the rhythm of Rio’s gaze more than the music. Every step toward the private staircase felt inevitable, like gravity was pulling her to her vampire.</p><p>But someone stepped into her path.</p><p>A man. Broad-shouldered, middle-aged, wearing an inconspicuously tailored black suit and shoes too polished for a place like this.</p><p>“Agatha,” he said, low and firm.</p><p>She didn’t stop right away.</p><p>Didn’t flinch.</p><p>She took one more step before lifting her eyes, finally letting them settle on his face. She knew it before he even opened his mouth. The scent. The stance. The polished blade holstered just beneath his jacket.</p><p>A hunter.</p><p>One of her mother’s.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, slow and sharp. “You have three seconds to get the fuck out of my way.”</p><p>He didn’t move. “Your mother sent me.”</p><p>“Of course she did.” Agatha’s voice was ice-edged now, her whole body still coiled tight from the performance, from the bond. “I’m not going back.”</p><p>“You don’t have to,” the man said evenly. “Not yet. But she’s giving you a way to come home. You bring her the head of Rio Vidal…”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “Think about this, Agatha. You’re playing dress-up in a den of monsters. You think they care about you? That one up there” – he flicked his chin in the direction of the stairs – “she’s using you. She smells the hunter in you. She’s just waiting until you’re soft enough to bleed.”</p><p>He had no idea about the bond.</p><p>“You don’t know her,” Agatha snapped. Her voice low, but fierce – coiled tight like a whip ready to strike.</p><p>“I know her better than you think. She’s the oldest of them. The hungriest. She has killed thousands of hunters. Our organization was created because of her and the ones like her. She’s not your lover, girl. She’s a weapon. And when she’s done with you…”</p><p>“Don’t.” Agatha’s voice dropped an octave. Her eyes were dark now, dangerous. “Don’t talk about her. Not like you know a damn thing.”</p><p>“She’s a sin, Agatha. And you…” he looked her over, disgust curling his lip, “you were a legacy. You were born to wipe their kind from the earth. Now look at you.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha took a step closer, her voice venomous and steady. “Then tell my mother to go fuck herself.”</p><p>The man’s jaw clenched.</p><p>“I’m serious. You tell her this is over. I’m not her soldier. I’m not her daughter. I’m not a hunter anymore. I’m done.”</p><p>“You don’t get to be done.” He hissed. “This is blood, Agatha. This is a vow. You can’t run from it.”</p><p>“I’m not running.” Her smile was slow. Cruel. “I’m choosing. That’s what she hates. That I didn’t choose her.”</p><p>“You think she’s chosen you back?” he asked, suddenly cold reaching out to grab Agatha’s wrist. “You think you matter to her? That your little mortal body and wet thighs mean anything to a creature like that?”</p><p>That was the wrong move.</p><p>The second his hand landed on her wrist; Agatha moved.</p><p>She twisted his arm, caught his hand by the fingers and <em>snapped</em>. The sound was wet and sharp.</p><p>The man cursed, dropping to one knee as he cradled his broken hand.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, slow, calm, fire in her voice.</p><p>“Next time, I take the whole fucking arm.”</p><p>Then she stepped around him, without looking back.</p><p>The hallway narrowed and curved toward the private stairwell. Her heels clicked with a purpose. Her blood still sang from the dance. From the bond. From fury.</p><p>She reached the top of the stairs, shoulders rising and falling, breath hot, eyes glowing.</p><p>The door to the VIP lounge swung open without a knock.</p><p>Agatha stepped inside like a storm had taken human form – quiet thunder in devastating heels, the fire of her rage cloaked in black and emerald lace and sweat-slicked skin. Her eyes locked onto Rio instantly.</p><p>And froze.</p><p>Rio was standing across the busy lounge, and she wasn’t alone.</p><p>The woman beside her was elegant, mid-conversation, leaning just a little too close. Her hand rested casually on Rio’s arm, her fingers lingering. She had the kind of beauty that came with age and vanity – perfect red lips, sharp cheekbones, a laugh like poisoned wine.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hear the words.</p><p>She didn’t need to.</p><p>She felt everything else.</p><p>The man’s voice echoed from her memory. <em>You think she’s chosen you back?</em></p><p>Something primal tightened in Agatha’s chest, curling inward before it snapped.</p><p>She let out a low, involuntary growl.</p><p>Rio’s head jerked up at the sound.</p><p>Her eyes locked with Agatha’s – startled at first, then darkening with something unreadable.</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>She heard behind her. But Agatha didn’t stop.</p><p>Didn’t speak.</p><p>She turned sharply on her heel, her hair fanning behind her like a whip as she stormed past the patrons and headed toward the private staircase leading to the residence above.</p><p>She didn’t look back.</p><p>Didn’t wait to hear Rio’s explanation.</p><p>All she could hear was the blood rushing in her ears, the fury churning hot in her chest, the pressure of the bond pulled so tight it felt like a blade against her ribs. The possessiveness burning in her gut.</p><p>She didn’t know what the fuck she was thinking anymore.</p><p>The heavy door slammed shut behind her.</p><p>Agatha stormed into the loft, body burning with adrenaline and fury, her breath shallow, teeth gritted. Her heels hit the hardwood with staccato violence, each step sharper than the last. Her fists curled at her sides, knuckles white, her whole-body humming with rage that had nowhere to go except outward.</p><p>At her mother. At Rio. At that woman that had the audacity to touch what was hers.</p><p>The luxurious suite blurred around her – the velvet furnishings, the glowing sconces, the linger scent of old wood and cloves and Rio. None of it mattered.</p><p>Because she couldn’t stop replaying what she saw downstairs.</p><p>That woman. Her hand on Rio’s arm. The easy lean of her body, the way she smiled at Rio like she had a right to her.</p><p>And Rio – gods, even the vague look of amusement on her face had made Agatha’s throat close.</p><p>She barely registered cross the floor when the door behind her opened again.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Agatha whirled, eyes wild, and slammed both hands into Rio’s chest, shoving her back with a force that surprised even herself.</p><p>Rio stumbled one step – only because she hadn’t been ready.</p><p>“What the fuck?” she snapped, blinking, jaw tightening as she found her balance. “Agatha what the hell was that?”</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha snarled.</p><p>“Don’t what?” Rio stepped forward, her voice low, warning. “Don’t follow you when you’re stomping around like a goddamn thunderstorm?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. Her body was trembling now, not from fear – but from how much she hated the way her throat was closing, the tightness in her chest.</p><p>“You looked real cozy,” she hissed, “with whoever the fuck that was.”</p><p>Rio’s face tightened, eyes narrowing. “You mean my client? The one trying to buy out half the city?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t stop. “You let her touch you.”</p><p>“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Rio growled. “You think that’s what I want? After what we…”</p><p>“Maybe I don’t know what you want!” Agatha exploded, stepping in again. Her voice cracked high and unsteady, but full of fire. “Maybe I’m just a warm body until something shinier drapes herself across your lap.”</p><p>The air snapped with tension.</p><p>Rio’s eyes went black.</p><p>She moved.</p><p>Fast.</p><p>Caught Agatha’s wrists and yanked her in, their bodies colliding with a brutal thud. Her grip was unrelenting, like iron cloaked in velvet.</p><p>“Don’t ever talk about yourself like that again,” she said, low and shaking. “Don’t fucking do that.”</p><p>Agatha twisted in her hold, struggling to push back – but Rio held firm. They collided with the wall, Agatha’s back thudding against the cool plaster.</p><p>But she wasn’t scared. She was incandescent with fury.</p><p>“You’re not my fucking owner.”</p><p>“And you’re not thinking straight,” Rio barked, pinning her again, voice nearly cracking with restraint. “You don’t get to throat a tantrum when someone speaks to me.”</p><p>“Then maybe you shouldn’t act like you are available.” Agatha hissed back.</p><p>Rio’s snarl cut the air in half. She grabbed Agatha’s hips, spun her, and slammed her back against the wall – hard.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>Agatha growled and shoved her elbow into Rio’s ribs. They grappled, tangled limbs and grinding hips, until Rio twisted her arm around Agatha’s back and pulled them both to the floor in a heap of snarls and limbs.</p><p>Agatha threw her weight against Rio, trying to pin her. Rio flipped her with a grunt, locking her thighs around Agatha’s waist, forearm pressed across her throat.</p><p>They breathed hard, faces inches apart, both flushed and panting.</p><p>“This is what you want?” Rio rasped, eyes burning into hers. “You want it rough? You want me to break you down?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, feral. “You’re all talk.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes gleamed.</p><p>She rolled her hips downward – deliberate, possessive.</p><p>Agatha gasped.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said darkly, lips ghosting the shell of Agatha’s ear. “Not so brave now, are you?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip – hard – but she didn’t back down. Her nails scraped along Rio’s scalp, dragging through her dark hair, yanking hard.</p><p>“You love this,” she whispered, “You love that I fight you.”</p><p>Rio laughed, low and hungry. “You make me fucking crazy.”</p><p>And then they were kissing – hard and brutal, teeth clashing.</p><p>Their clothes came off like casualties. Agatha’s corset was the first to go, torn down the middle. Rio’s blazer was shoved from her shoulders, shirt buttons popping as Agatha dragged it open.</p><p>Agatha gasped when she felt the press of the strap between them – hard, thick, right where she wanted it.</p><p>“You’ve been walking around with this all night?” she growled.</p><p>Rio nipped at her lip. “For <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s head tipped back, thighs clenching. “Fuck.”</p><p>Rio took advantage, dragging her down to the thick fur rug near the hearth. The firelight painted their skin in gold and shadows.</p><p>“You want to be mine?” Rio whispered, lining herself up, voice shaking with restraint.</p><p>Agatha met her eyes.</p><p>“I <em>am </em>yours.”</p><p>That was all it took.</p><p>Rio slammed forward, bottoming out, her hand gripping Agatha’s throat again – firm, not cruel, just enough to make her <em>feel</em> it. Enough to tell her she <em>wasn’t</em> in control anymore.</p><p>Agatha moaned, loud and broken.</p><p>They moved like animals – no rhythm, no tenderness, just need. Skin slapped. Breaths caught. The smell of sweat and sex filled the air.</p><p>Agatha clawed at Rio’s back. “Harder.”</p><p>“You’re going to feel me for days,” Rio growled.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Their bodies collided in brutal rhythm. Rio thrust harder, deeper, hand tangling in Agatha’s hair, the gripping her hip so tightly it would bruise.</p><p>“You think I care about anyone else?” she rasped. “Look at me.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open.</p><p>“You think <em>anyone</em> else could survive you?”</p><p>Agatha reached for her – gripped Rio’s face, kissed her like she was sealing a vow in blood.</p><p>“Then ruin me.”</p><p>Rio did.</p><p>She made her scream.</p><p>Again. And again.</p><p>Until Agatha was limp beneath her, wrecked and wild, tears leaking from the corners of her eyes as her final orgasm ripped through her.</p><p>Rio collapsed beside her – breathing hard, still trembling with restraint.</p><p>For a moment, they didn’t move.</p><p>Agatha lay on her back, staring at the ceiling, chest heaving.</p><p>Rio brushed hair off her sweat-damp face.</p><p>Only when Agatha finally rolled to her side, curling against Rio’s body, did the silence break.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her voice barely a whisper.</p><p>“He found me.”</p><p>Rio blinked, turning her head slowly. “What?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. “The hunter. One of my mother’s men. He was downstairs, before I came up here.”</p><p>Rio sat up slowly, her expression freezing.</p><p>Agatha still couldn’t meet her eyes. “He said if I brought her your head, I could come home.”</p><p>Rio was deathly silent.</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily. “I told him to go fuck himself. And then broke his hand.”</p><p>Rio stared.</p><p>And then, finally, she exhaled – slowly – and chuckled laying back down beside her, pulling Agatha close.</p><p>The silence between them pulsed like a second heartbeat.</p><p>Rio’s fingers brushed along Agatha’s cheek, reverent no, trailing down to trace the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“I want you,” she said quietly, voice still thick with desire and something else – something softer. As mine. Not just like this. I mean it. Be my girlfriend.”</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>Then she let out a hoarse, incredulous laugh.</p><p>Rio froze. “What?”</p><p>Agatha covered her face with one hand, giggling now – like something inside her had cracked open and poured sunshine. “Did you just ask me that like a high schooler?”</p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed, though her mouth twitched. “Well, excuse me for trying to be direct.”</p><p>“Direct?” Agatha laughed harder, rolling onto her side. “God, you’re so old. Who even says girlfriend anymore? What happened to seduction? To mystery?”</p><p>Rio leaned over her, propping herself on one elbow. “I just railed you into the floor hard enough to bruise your soul. Forgive me if I’m skipping mystery.”</p><p>Agatha caught her breath and looked up at her, the teasing still dancing in her eyes – but something deeper behind it now. “You’re serious.”</p><p>“I am.” Rio’s gaze didn’t waver. “You’re in my blood, Agatha.”</p><p>A long pause. The fire crackled softly in the distance, shadows dancing along the ceiling.</p><p>Agatha’s smile dimmed, then returned as something gentler, quieter.</p><p>“I think I fell for you.” She said, voice barely more than a whisper.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to,” Agatha continued, her fingers brushing the line of Rio’s jaw. “I tried not to. I tried hard to fight it.”</p><p>“You fought hard,” Rio murmured with a crooked smile.</p><p>“But I lost,” Agatha admitted. “I’m in love with you.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, just for a second. When she opened them, they glowed – soft, ancient, raw. “Good.”</p><p>“Good?”</p><p>“Because I’ve been in love with you since the moment you danced like the world was watching and you didn’t give a single fuck.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a shaky laugh and leaned in, brushing her lips over Rio’s.</p><p>“Yes, I will be your <em>girlfriend</em>, Rio.” She smiled as she leaned in, kissing her soft and slow.</p><p>When they finally parted, Rio looked at her with a new edge to her gaze – like she was preparing for battle.</p><p>“There’s something I want to ask you.” She spoke.</p><p>Agatha quirked a brow. “I’m not marrying you, vampire.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Relax. Not yet.”</p><p>She cupped Agatha’s cheek, serious now, but not soft. There was something resolute in her gaze – feral, possessive, ancient.</p><p>“I want you off that stage,” Rio said, her thumb brushing the corner of Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“Not because I’m trying to protect you. Not because I don’t love watching you command the room as you walk out on that stage.”</p><p>She paused, gaze darkening.</p><p>“But because I want you beside me. In my world. As my partner.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>“This empire I’ve built,” Rio went on, voice low, threading between them like smoke and promise, “The covens, the syndicates, the blood networks, the cities I own in shadow – it means nothing if you’re not in it. With me.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, the words landing like thunder behind her ribs.</p><p>“You’re asking me to walk away from everything,” she said slowly, searching Rio’s eyes for the catch, the trick, the trap she was sure would come.</p><p>But there was none.</p><p>Rio leaned in, forehead resting against hers. “No. I’m asking you to walk into something bigger. With me. To build something neither of us could do alone.”</p><p>And Agatha – chaos in heels, sharp as silver, wildfire barely contained – just stared at her.</p><p>Not as a dancer. Not as a hunter.</p><p>But as someone who could stand at the helm of the dark with someone who already ruled it.</p><p>Her lips parted. Her hand slid around Rio’s wrist.</p><p>And for the first time, Agatha felt the ground steady beneath her feet.</p><p>Not because she was staying.</p><p>But because she knew exactly where she was going.</p>
