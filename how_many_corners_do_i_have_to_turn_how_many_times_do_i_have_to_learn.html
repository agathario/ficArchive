<div class="userstuff">
<p>The night before she takes over her aunt’s restaurant, Rio Vidal dreams of a zoo.</p><p>She knows it’s a dream because she’s had this particular one before.</p><p>She’s standing outside an enclosure, fingers gripping the mesh as she watches a leopard, belly close to the ground, stalk an unsuspecting impala.</p><p>There’s usually a little more fuss before this, watching giraffes eating before her eyes grow fuzzy and she’s watching elephants bathe their calves. Then her eyes blur over again until she sees this; a leopard and an impala sharing the space.</p><p>Straight to the point, for once.</p><p>Rio knows this is a dream, but she still can’t help the way her throat tightens as she tries to get the impala’s attention, the cry dying on her tongue. She should know better by now. She’s never been able to save it.</p><p>All she manages is a weird gurgling whine as the leopard closes in, knuckles white, skin pulled taut as she grips the mesh.</p><p>The leopard makes its move, jaw already open wide.</p><p>And Rio is too late.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t like not knowing what to expect.</p><p>And she usually knows exactly what to expect when starting a new job. A clear structure. Communication with whoever is in charge, letting her know when to start, what will be expected of her; and none of these things are ever surprising.</p><p>The executor of her aunt’s estate was a man Rio never had the pleasure of meeting in person. The whole thing was very quick, mostly done over the phone, and a few weeks later the deed to a restaurant was emailed over to her, along with a phone number.</p><p>She’d tried calling a few times but was always greeted with an automated voice that she couldn’t figure out how to bypass.</p><p>It should be the first glaring sign that the transition from sous chef to restaurant owner won’t be a smooth one.</p><p>It never would have been Rio’s first choice—she’s never loved having total control. She’s good at her job, yes. Rio doesn’t think it’s conceited of her to say she’s a talented chef, but she’s never had the burning desire to open up her own place or even take up the many offers from many places to be their head chef. Rio’s a rule follower, through and through.</p><p>A little Googling led her to a review page where Rio left what she’s sure is their strangest message to date. </p><p>
<em> (Hi, I’m Rio Vidal, Estella’s niece—) </em>
</p><p>And received the strangest reply from one <em> Estella Vidal, owner, Sage &amp; Scythe </em>.</p><p>
<em> (Hello Rio. May I offer my condolences to you—) </em>
</p><p>She’d briefly chatted with this impersonator, Lilia, she found out, explaining who she was and her plan to take on the restaurant rather than sell it.</p><p>
<em> (If you’re in the area, this may be a better conversation to be had in person. Feel free to come down any ti—) </em>
</p><p>Well. Rio Vidal had been in Italy, not exactly in the area of Westview, New Jersey, but she had to work with what she’d been given.</p><p>Obviously, like any sane person would, she quit her job at the three star Michelin restaurant she’d worked at for four years, sold her apartment in Rome, and booked a flight.</p><p>Okay, Rio knows this isn’t the behavior of someone who has their life together, and yes, there’s probably something to be said about the way she’s disrupted her entire life’s balance for something she’s never really wanted, but the thought of selling her aunt’s restaurant to a stranger, and letting the last solid piece of her family slip between her fingers was an excruciating enough thought to get her step out of her comfort zone.</p><p>Sage &amp; Scythe is right in the heart of Westview’s town center, though not the easiest to find. Out of all the green coloured storefronts in Westview, and there are a few, the restaurant oddly isn’t one of them.</p><p>The dilapidated corner building she’s been walking past back and forth for the past five minutes is what she’s been looking for. In Rio’s defense, the individually hung letters now read Sag     c th , so sue her for not noticing sooner.</p><p>Garish is the cardigan Rio sees draped over the woman standing behind the bar when she opens the door. Rio clears her throat, hoping to get her attention from the doorway. It doesn’t work. She tries a second time, stepping a little closer, to no avail.</p><p>Rio glances to the side and notices a few of the tables have empty glasses on them. Did they not close down properly last night?</p><p>“Sorry, excuse me—” The woman spares a glance at her over her shoulder.</p><p>“I heard you the first time, dear, but we’re not open.” She pauses before turning slightly, pointing the tip of the pen at Rio, “Unless you’re here for a reading. I can always make time for you then.”</p><p>“A… reading?”</p><p>“You look like you have questions that need answering. I’ve got cards that want divining. Looks like we can help each other out,” A puckish grin plays on the woman’s lips. She holds a hand out for Rio to shake, a little awkward since she has to wait for Rio to cross the rest of the way across the room to be within touching distance. “Lilia Calderu, bartender and tarot consultant. Some here call me the Sage Oracle, though I think that’s a little extravagant.”</p><p>Cool, so Lilia’s insane.</p><p>And the bar looks sticky. Rio lets a pinky finger press against it to confirm. She was right.</p><p>“You must be the woman impersonating my recently deceased aunt on Tripadvisor.”</p><p>A look flashes across Lilia’s face and her smile drops slightly, less ‘customer service’, “You must be Rio. We didn’t think you’d get here so soon.”</p><p>Rio shrugs, “The timings worked out.”</p><p>They didn’t really. It was kind of a pain to sell her apartment on such short notice.</p><p>Wait, did she say—</p><p>“You do readings here? Like, do they make this place money?”</p><p>“They do, actually. I host psychic nights on occasion. Drives foot flow like you wouldn’t believe. I presume I’ll still be allowed to run them once you take ov—”</p><p>A cardboard box is slammed down onto the bar between them, the contents clinking together inside loudly, effectively cutting their conversation. The interruption is a younger woman. A chef, she realizes belatedly, noticing the white jacket she’s wearing, though it’s completely unbuttoned, showing off a tight black tank top underneath. Rio’s eyes linger on her exposed collarbones before flitting down to the hint of cleavage on display.</p><p>
<em> For fuck’s sake, look away. </em>
</p><p>A knife deftly cuts through the tape on the box and the woman dips a hand inside, half pulling out a bottle to show the older woman what she’s holding. “Lilia, please, for my sanity, can you find the password for the online order system? We do <em> not </em>need this many bottles of vodka on autodrop every week. Sort it out or it’s going in my pasta.”</p><p>When Rio’s eyes start taking in this woman’s face—she’s undeniably gorgeous with her striking features, she realizes she’s staring right back, lip twitching in a near smirk as she looks at Rio looking at her, and <em> fuck </em>Rio realizes she was essentially staring at this woman’s chest for a time. Rio’s not sure ‘I was just looking at your chef whites’ is a good excuse.</p><p>“Penne alla vodka is pretty good, actually.” Rio finds the words spill from her lips before she can even think to stop them. She feels an awful compulsion to keep this woman’s attention on her.</p><p>“And who are you, handsome?”</p><p>Rio’s pretty certain she’s experiencing the human equivalent of the blue screen of death. No one has <em> ever </em>called her that before.</p><p>Before Rio’s brain kicks back into gear, Lilia cuts in with a sharp look, “Agatha, this is Rio Vidal, the new owner.”</p><p>
<em> Agatha. </em>
</p><p>Rio watches as something in Agatha’s easy expression shifts and leaves her feeling like she’s being appraised. Rio scrambles for something to say; why does a conversation feel like something she can lose.</p><p>“Lilia was just telling me about her psychic nights.”</p><p>“Oh fuck no, Lilia!” Agatha points a finger at the older woman who groans, “She’s been pushing for this for years, don’t give her what she wants, Vidal.”</p><p>“I don’t know why you’re so against it. Just stay in the kitchen where you’re <em> supposed </em>to be when I do my readings.”</p><p>“I like to know what’s going on.”</p><p>“You like sticking your nose in places it doesn’t belong, and avoiding doing any work. Look, you’re even doing it now.” Lilia says and gives Agatha’s shoulder a little shove—familiar.</p><p>“That’s so rude,” Agatha shakes her head, turns to Rio and brandishes the knife she’s been holding the whole time at her, the tip of the blade dangerously close to Rio’s throat, “You’d never treat me like this, would you, boss?”</p><p>Oh, this woman is going to cause issues. This isn’t the first time a chef has threatened Rio with a knife though. Chefs are notoriously quick to anger and very defensive. The way Lilia’s hardly blinked at this display has Rio thinking it won’t be the last time.</p><p>“Like you said, I’m your boss, so I guess we’ll see.”</p><p>There’s a beat. Agatha looks at Rio curiously, not saying anything.</p><p>“Agatha, won’t you be a dear and show Chef Vidal to the kitchen. You can give her a tour while I finish up here.”</p><p>Agatha looks like she wants to argue, even opens her mouth to do so, but a look from Lilia silences her. </p><p>Agatha finally pulls her knife away with a little smile, like there was a joke in there this whole time. She turns on her heel and strolls away.</p><p>Rio thinks this might be the biggest mistake of her life.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio trails after Agatha, weaving around possibly the worst designed kitchen she’s ever stepped foot in. As far as she can see, there’s not a single hand sink next to any of the possible food prep areas, which Rio adds to the list in her mind as something she’ll need to address with the head chef when she meets them.</p><p>“Corner!” Rio calls out when she rounds a standing fridge, and it’s a good job because somehow Agatha forgets to. Or, thinking back to how she was so free with that knife, maybe she just doesn’t care so much about kitchen safety. It’s a concern.</p><p>The fridge, for some fucked up reason is tacked onto the end of the island counter, which is right next to a swing door (super safe) and she’s pretty much fucking body slammed with a gastro tray of prawns as the boy carrying them, tries to grab onto her with one hand, sending the tray tipping out of his grip.</p><p>Whether he’s trying to save her Rio doesn’t know, but he may as well not have bothered because she gets sent floundering to the floor along with the prawns he’s sloshed all over the place.</p><p>It’s a brilliant start to her new job.</p><p>“Oh my God, I-I-I I don’t know what happened, I didn’t even see you!” The kid stammers. He seems a little terrified but still offers Rio a hand up, which is more than she can say for Agatha, who is holding open the swing door with a foot and examining her fingernails like Rio is wasting her time.</p><p>“I mean, yeah, that fridge is a safety hazard.” Rio dusts herself off, giving her hands something to do so she doesn’t start wringing her fingers like an embarrassed child. “Didn’t you hear me call the corner?”</p><p>The boy looks to Agatha for help that she’s obviously unwilling to give.</p><p>Cultivating a reputation that she belittles teenagers she doesn’t know isn’t part of her restaurant action plan, so she lets it slide with a shake of her head. She'll come back to it when she feels less humiliated by the whole <em> falling on her ass </em>thing.</p><p>“It's fine. Just get it cleaned up.”</p><p>“Ten second rule, Billy, okay?” Agatha calls over her shoulder when Rio starts following her again.</p><p>Rio whips round, “Kid, no!”</p><p>The kid—Billy, she presumes, is already kneeling on the floor, hands cupped ready to gather the fallen prawns. He stops mid scoop and looks at Rio, and then at Agatha as she pivots back around. Agatha releases a ridiculous long-suffering sigh.</p><p>“Do <em> not </em>put those prawns back.”</p><p>“A little dirt never hurt anyone. It’s good for the immune system.” She’s only known her like, ten minutes but Rio can already picture Agatha rolling her eyes.</p><p>“I’m not serving floor prawns to my guests.” Rio shouldn’t have to spell this out.</p><p>“Oh!” Agatha raises an eyebrow at Rio. “They’re <em> your </em>guests, are they?”</p><p>“My name is on the deed so I’d say so, yeah.”</p><p>“Agatha…” Billy groans out.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t heed Billy’s unspoken warning; a staring contest has broken out, and Rio has always prided herself on her ability to enter a thousand yard stare like she’s being paid for it. She once was told by a woman at the end of a date, during what she’d dubbed her ‘review period’ that it was off putting how little she blinked. Rio had taken it as a compliment and never saw the woman again, so she’s sure that wasn’t the intention.</p><p>Agatha looks away first, and it feels like winning until she remembers it’s just floor prawns. And if Agatha is willing to fight her on this, there will be more to come.</p><p>“Throw out the ones on the floor, Teen.” Her tone is mocking. “Come on, Vidal, we’re losing daylight here.”</p><p>Through the door, Agatha points out a prep room with, thankfully, its own sink.</p><p>“That’s Alice.”</p><p>Alice hasn’t noticed them. Her chef jacket is nowhere to be seen, wiry muscles on display as she peels potatoes in a tank top, hair half-heartedly tied back as a red-tipped fringe falls over her eyes. She’s humming to herself as she works.</p><p>Rio opens her mouth to introduce herself, but Agatha gets there first, “Don’t say hi, she has headphones in.”</p><p>“I wasn-”</p><p>“I saw you, you were gonna say hi.”</p><p>Rio snaps her jaw shut and her tongue finds the inside of her cheek.</p><p>“Aw, you’re embarrassed, that’s cute.”</p><p>“The tour, please, chef.”</p><p>A smile pulls across Agatha’s lips. She was right, of course.</p><p>Agatha continues her tour, a bored quality taking over her voice, quickly pointing out the dry store, the fridge, the freezer through the back of the fridge—that’s a new one, it’s like fucking Narnia. She says as much to Agatha who side eyes her with a curl of her lip. She’s keeping her thoughts to herself next time, thank you.</p><p>And oh, now Agatha’s staring at her.</p><p>They’re face to face and Agatha is staring like Rio’s missing something.</p><p>Agatha lets out a huff and then closes in on Rio.</p><p>What the fuck.</p><p>Her mind and body must be disconnected because her inner thoughts are screaming at her to move, but her body is still like the useless sack of potatoes Alice was peeling.</p><p>She’s close enough now that when Rio takes a steadying breath she gets a hint of lavender, only faint underneath the unfortunate kitchen smell.</p><p>Agatha turns her body to the side so her back is pressed up against the shelf, and—oh my God, she’s trying to leave.</p><p>Rio’s cerebellum kicks back in—she hopes it enjoyed its sabbatical, and she shuffles out of the way to let Agatha pass. What is wrong with her?</p><p>Small mercy, and surprising from what she’s learnt about her so far, but Agatha doesn’t bring it up but she does look worryingly pleased with herself.</p><p>“So we’ve got another fridge outside—”</p><p>“Outside?”</p><p>Agatha yanks open the back door and kicks the fly screen out of the way, muttering as it crashes against the wall.</p><p>“You’re going to break that if you’re not careful.” Rio warns.</p><p>“Meh-meh-meh.”</p><p>Which, okay. Rio knows Agatha’s younger than her but now she thinks she may be younger than she originally thought, the mocking painting her immature. Though she’s poised in a way she’s only seen in people that vaguely have their shit together—usually at thirty and upwards, Rio’s now remolding the image of Agatha she has in her mind.</p><p>“We keep a lot of the fruit and veg out here,” Agatha points to the fridge, “Less expensive to replace if someone breaks in.”</p><p>“Has that happened before?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t meet her incredulous look, and bats away Rio’s question with a flourish of her hand.</p><p>“Chef?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Oh, so she’s playing dumb now.</p><p>“Nevermind.” Rio’s never been a ‘the less you know, the better’ kind of girl, but one conversation with this infuriating woman has her rethinking her values. She needs to talk to someone who isn’t going to give her a heart attack.</p><p>Rio turns on her heel—maybe fresh air is bad for her, she feels like she’s losing herself. She can feel Agatha tailing her.</p><p>“Any chance of meeting the head chef?”</p><p>Agatha sucks on her teeth, “Yeah, about that.”</p><p>Never been Rio’s favorite way to receive information.</p><p>This doesn’t feel like a conversation she wants to have in front of the rest of the team so she heads to the dry store and gestures for Agatha to continue.</p><p>“So, Phil—that’s the head chef.”</p><p>“Yeah, I got the context clues, thank you.”</p><p>“Or, well, <em> was </em>the head chef.”</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>“We had some,” Agatha purses her lips and Rio can tell she’s delaying this specifically to piss her off. “Shall we say. Collaborative differences.”</p><p>“What’s collaborative about him being head chef, and you… not?”</p><p>“I don’t respond too well to being told what to do.”</p><p>“Oh, perfect.”</p><p>“Yeah, he didn’t see it that way.”</p><p>“Surprising,” Rio sighs, “So you just… annoyed him into leaving?”</p><p>There’s possibly never lived a more dramatic woman, and there might never again, because Agatha quite literally presses a hand to her chest, “Who, me?” She keeps her jaw dropped in faux shock. Rio kind of wants to strangle her. She restrains, however, and quirks an eyebrow in question.</p><p>“Well, there’s no <em> proof </em> he left because of me, just saying. There <em> is </em> proof of him mismanaging the stock sheets though—let me tell you, that man was <em> not </em>good with stock control. It’s a good job I had a look over them. Your aunt, may she rest in peace, wasn’t too good at catching that sort of thing.</p><p>“He, uh, didn’t like me coming in early and making changes to the desserts and stuff. Something about undermining his authority, I don’t know. Oh, there was also the thing with his wife, and him ‘allegedly’ cheating on her—don’t worry about that one.”</p><p>It’s her first day. All she wanted to do was introduce herself, get to know the building, the menu, the staff. Instead, she’s dealing with a bubbling deep in her stomach that feels concerningly like rage mixed with attraction whenever Agatha opens her mouth. She speaks like she knows people hang off of her every word, and maybe it’s as true for others as it is for Rio.</p><p>Rio restrains the urge to run a hand through her hair. Can’t show it’s getting to her.</p><p>She thinks she’s going to regret asking, but, “Who’s in charge here, then?”</p><p>Agatha gestures to herself, shocker, a small grin plays across her lips.</p><p>“So, you can’t actually <em> promote </em>yourself, is the thing.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression doesn’t change. She really, truly believes she has the upper hand. Like Rio isn’t her new boss. Like she knows Rio is attracted to her.</p><p>Which is distinctly annoying for someone who is never attracted to anyone upon meeting them, because of course the one time it happens would be someone like Agatha, who she definitely can’t have, and who will use this to her advantage. She hopes it dies as quickly as it was born.</p><p>“You’re right, maybe Teen should be at the helm,” Agatha’s eye contact is intense, “I was the only viable option, you’ll realise that. I did what was necessary and stepped up.”</p><p>“There’s a process here,” Rio manages to keep her voice level, <em> nice </em>, “I appreciate you taking initiative but this is my restaurant and I can’t have my staff making the decisions for me. You understand that, right?”</p><p>“So you’re demoting me?”</p><p>“Uh, I don’t think you were actually ever promoted.”</p><p>“Technically.”</p><p>“Agatha, you have to <em> earn </em>a promotion.”</p><p>Agatha wets her lips, leans in close. Rio’s eyes track the movement before she has time to realize, and she has nowhere to go, back pressed against the many tins of chopped tomatoes on the shelf. She tries to keep a neutral expression. Unfazed. Possibly unsuccessfully.</p><p>“So I’ll earn it.”</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>As soon as the tour is over, Rio escapes back to Lilia in time for the lunch service to start and is suitably busy introducing herself to the front of house staff. Jen and Vision are polar opposites but they seem to work well together.</p><p>She scopes out the office herself and starts rifling through the masses of papers that are on the desk. Rio hasn’t seen her aunt since she was a child but she’s privately pleased that the chaotic, free spirit she remembers might not have been totally conjured up.</p><p>Rio manages to get through the rest of the day without another Agatha sighting, but when she leaves the office to go back to the bare bones apartment she’s just started renting, she hears a loud, unrestrained laugh coming from the kitchen. There’s not a doubt in her mind about whose it is.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t get any less infuriating over the coming days. In fact, sometimes Rio feels she creates scenarios specifically to get under her skin.</p><p>Like when the reservations list for the evening mysteriously disappeared from the bar, right after Agatha had come out of the kitchen just to harp on at her about Jen trying to micromanage the kitchen.</p><p>(“If she wanted to argue over who should be on what section she shouldn’t have switched to waitressing.”</p><p>“Agatha, as much as I usually enjoy hearing you get wound up over the littlest thing, I do actually have a restaurant to run here, and I’m sure you have tickets on.”</p><p>She’d turned to the guests who’d witnessed the whole thing, gave them a tight smile, and tried to stop her eye from twitching when she realized her list had disappeared.)</p><p>Or the time the heating was switched on in the middle of service on an already sweltering day, leading to guests walking out, Rio gradually taking off items of her uniform (tie gone, top two shirt buttons undone, sleeves rolled up), and Lilia walking right back out the door when she was due to start her shift. When confronted, Agatha pointed to herself and said, “Moi? I would never.” Which told Rio all she needed to know.</p><p>Most recently she’d had to physically restrain Agatha from attacking a guest after he’d complained about her food. In her defense, Vision should have known better than to tell Agatha word for word what he’d said about her sea bass fillets.</p><p>Her food isn’t really cause for concern, to Rio’s growing surprise. The taste of it, anyway. The reviews she sees coming through generally say the same, <em> food tastes great, but presentation is poor - looks like the chef threw it on the plate </em>. She’ll get to that eventually but as long as it’s edible she’ll take the win.</p><p>The tension in the kitchen is unlike any Rio’s ever worked in; which is saying something since she’s not actually working in this kitchen.</p><p>The only person who seems willing to provide help to anyone who gets swamped on their section is Wanda, and she’s seen Agatha almost bite her when she tried to grab more pasta out of the dry store for her. Wanda barely blinked and left her to it.</p><p>(That’s another thing Rio’s not used to—families. The places she’s worked in for the last fifteen years required insane amounts of training and recommendations that it was rare anyone knew each other past having trained together or under someone.</p><p>She first met Wanda when she was dropping Billy off for his shift. She’d kissed him on his head—which he looked appalled by, and headed over to Rio.</p><p>“I’m his mom.” She’d said by way of introduction, and Rio had thought it was weird how involved she was in her son’s life to the point where she felt the need to say hi to his new boss, though she didn’t have much to compare it to. She was even more confused when she walked in with Vision the next day, both of them clocking in one after the other. Rio averted her gaze when Wanda leaned up to give Vision a quick kiss.</p><p>“Disgusting isn’t it,” Rio jumped away at the sound of Agatha’s voice so close to her ear, her chin close to being hooked over Rio’s shoulder. “It was bad enough when it was just the two of them but since they got jobs for their nepo baby spawn, they’re inescapable.”</p><p>“Billy?”</p><p>“And Tommy. Twins.” Agatha shuddered but she was grinning. “He’s got way too much energy so I put in a request for Billy. He’s the lesser of two evils.”)</p><p>It’s been a struggle not to feel useless now that she’s not cooking and she’s trying her hardest to stay out of the kitchen and let Agatha prove she can do her job. And if asked, yes, that’s definitely the whole reason. She’s taken to working behind the bar through the midweek daytimes when it’s not busy and there’s no designated bartender. It makes her feel like she’s actually helping when the servers don’t have to make their own drinks, and she finds she likes just mindlessly making drinks when the tickets come through as she does her paperwork.</p><p>What Rio doesn’t like is taking orders and the realization is hitting as she’s in the middle of doing it. She’s done it a few times, mostly when she seats a table and can see the servers are busy, so she’ll make very bad small talk and take a drink order.</p><p>She’s seriously considering cutting out the whole ‘how’s your day going’ part of the conversation and jumping straight into ‘you look like wine people’ when a guy starts complaining about losing his job before she’s even got her notepad out. He gets redder and redder in the face, barely stopping for breath and Rio just stands and watches. She can’t relate to him; she’s never been fired from any job she’s had so she waits until he’s tired himself out.</p><p>She gives him an awkward laugh when he finishes his rant, “I’ll give you guys a few minutes to decide then, shall I?” And slinks off back to the bar, already feeling a headache coming on. It’s only 3pm.</p><p>When Rio sees Jen drop off a pile of plates onto the bar and head to another table she thinks her brain might throb out of her skull in annoyance.</p><p>“Jen, I swear. How many times do I have to tell you to stop leaving shit on the bar?” Rio can feel herself bubbling like that man who lost his job.</p><p>“And I told you I’m trying to minimize my kitchen time.”</p><p>“You were serious about that?”</p><p>“Um, you’ve seen Agatha when I walk in there, right? She’s like a feral dog, I swear she’s growled at me before,” Funnily enough she can actually picture it. Agatha, teeth bared and snarling when Jen walks into the room. “I try to stack my plates so I can make less trips.”</p><p>“This is ridiculous. People are walking in, the first thing they see is the bar and a load of dirty plates on it. It makes us look bad.”</p><p>“I hear what you’re saying but she’s a nightmare to work with. You try working one shift in that kitchen and you’ll see what I mean.”</p><p>Not one to be intimidated, Rio picks up the stack of plates, clenches her jaw, and heads to the kitchen.</p><p>Usually a kitchen is where she feels most comfortable. She feels so foreign forcing conversation that she craves the organized chaos of the kitchen. She gets to switch her brain off and focus on what she’s best at.</p><p>This kitchen is not that oasis.</p><p>There’s a cacophony of noise as soon as she nudges the door open with her foot, even more than usual. There’s a speaker kept in the kitchen and Rio has been mostly accommodating of it; she’s not the one working there and they all seem to work better to the music. This, though, is ridiculous.</p><p>She doesn’t know what she’s hearing when she first walks in, the sound so overwhelming. There’s music coming from two speakers; Eminem and Stevie Nicks are at war.</p><p>Rio slams the plates down by the bins. “What the <em> fuck </em>is going on?”</p><p>Even shouting she can barely be heard. Only Billy looks over at her, stopping spraying down plates.</p><p>“They do this sometimes.”</p><p>“Who’s they?”</p><p>“Well, A—”</p><p>“Yes, Agatha and who else?”</p><p>“Ralph.” Billy reaches to the plates she’d slammed down and starts scraping the food off of them.</p><p>“I’ve been here for weeks. Who the fuck is Ralph?”</p><p>As if perfectly on cue, a man Rio hasn’t met comes bounding in from the back of the kitchen. His chef whites are more greige and he has a cigarette hanging from his mouth as he mumbles along to ‘Rap God’. He tries to slip past Agatha but she opens the fridge door with ferocious speed, slamming it into his shoulder.</p><p>“Nah, that’s cool, I’m gonna be the bigger person and assume that was an accident.” He pushes the door back and heads to the stove, holding the cigarette to one of the empty rings to light it.</p><p>“No, no, no.” Rio speeds over to this ‘Ralph’ and grips his wrist, “What the fuck are you doing?”</p><p>“Uh… taking a break?”</p><p>Is Rio being punished for something? She’s saved her aunt’s restaurant from being turned into a Starbucks or some shit and this is her reward?</p><p>She drags Ralph by his wrist to the back door, slamming it open, the fly screen she’d once warned Agatha about snapping off its hinges with the force. She’ll deal with it later.</p><p>“Don’t <em> ever </em> let me see you smoke in this building again, or you’re gone. You hear me?”</p><p>She doesn’t wait for his response and storms back inside, pushing through the stupid swing door back into the kitchen. The sound of the music still blaring only boils her blood further. The kitchen staff jolt back into action when they see her. Rio follows the music, grabbing both speakers in turn and switching them off, keeping them in hand as she turns to Agatha, finally able to hear herself think.</p><p>“What were you planning on doing there, Chef?”</p><p>Agatha side eyes Rio when she approaches, “I try to ignore Bohner as much as I can, he really messes with my inner peace, you know?”</p><p>“<em> Bohner?” </em></p><p>“Hey, don't look at me, I didn't name him.”</p><p>But Rio doesn't want to think about Ralph <em> Bohner </em>anymore.</p><p>“You’re the kitchen manager. Manage your staff or I <em> will </em>take this position from you.” Agatha grunts her assent but doesn’t let on anymore, walking away to grab bowls. Rio steps into her space so she can’t be ignored. “Hey, listen to me,” Agatha looks at Rio like she couldn’t think of anyone worse to be speaking to. It’s stupid, Rio feels her stomach churn at the idea. “I know it wasn’t an accident that you hit Ralph with that door, but seriously, you guys need to communicate or someone will get hurt.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, scooping pasta into the bowls. “Why the fuck do I need to announce my presence? These morons should look where they’re going.” She says, walking her pan to the sink, around that stupidly placed end fridge and colliding with Billy, who’s rubbing his wrist.</p><p>“This fridge needs moving, it’s a hazard.”</p><p>“The fridge is fine, boss.”</p><p>“I’m fine too, if anyone cares.” Billy gives them both a tight lipped smile.</p><p>“See? Teen will muddle through with his ickle bruise,” Agatha reaches out to pinch his cheek, “Look how big and brave he is.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Billy whines, “I’m not a kid.”</p><p>“Yeah? This is what you get when your mommy gets you a job where half of us have seen you in diapers.”</p><p>“I was like ten when you met me, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs, mouth tugging down into something like disgust, “And you still look like you’re gonna piss yourself in fear when you’ve got more than a couple of plates to wash.”</p><p>“I’m keeping these,” Rio interrupts, she needs to get out of this hellscape, “You get your music back when you learn to talk to each other.”</p><p>Agatha pouts and reaches up to Rio’s face, and fuck if Rio’s gonna let her take back what control she’s managed to scrape together, so she bats her hand away before it reaches its target. “So mean to me.”</p><p>Rio swallows heavily. There’s gotta be something wrong with this woman. She turns on her heel, not deeming that necessary of a response and walks out of the kitchen, putting the speakers on the small office desk down the hall.</p><p>She takes a few calming breaths before heading back out front.</p><p>It’s going to be a long day.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>There’s a flat above the restaurant that her aunt had lived in when she was alive. Rio hasn’t been up there yet. It’s easy to put off; there hasn’t really been enough time and she hasn’t taken a day off since she started.</p><p>It’s calmed down considerably though, and Rio’s granted herself the relief of a lie in most mornings so she can stay to do the close down checks. She’s noticed Agatha can be kind of lax about thoroughly cleaning when she gets tired.</p><p>And she must be tired a lot, because Rio’s seen her on every single one of her shifts.</p><p>It’s weird—Rio’s there because this is <em> her </em>restaurant now. If it fails, it’s on her.</p><p>But Agatha? She doesn’t even seem to <em> like </em>her job. She complains about it at any given moment to anyone who’ll listen.</p><p>But she’s there consistently; not even short shifts either. Rio’s seen her in the morning, prepping in the kitchen before anyone else gets in, has said goodbye to her after the lunch rush has ended, and then has seen her back again that same evening, even staying til the bitter end.</p><p>It’s Agatha who actually brings up the flat.</p><p>“What are you going to do with it?” Agatha says, spraying down her work surfaces for the <em> second </em>time, Rio notes, barely managing to hide her smile at Agatha actually listening to her about the merit of two-stage cleaning.</p><p>She’s so distracted by the strange fuzzy feeling that seeing Agatha clean is giving her, fucking hell—<em> what </em>, that she has to replay the conversation in her head so she remembers where they’re at.</p><p>“Oh, uh. I hadn’t really thought about it. I haven’t even been up there yet.”</p><p>“You haven’t?”</p><p>“It’s not like I need it. I’m renting an apartment a few blocks away until I buy something. I’m thinking of turning it into, like, an office, store room type thing.” Rio says and leans against one of the walls by where Agatha’s working. She’d only come in to grab a spoon for her granola but got caught up in conversation when she’d spent too long staring at Agatha, bewildered by her <em> actually </em>cleaning without being told.</p><p>It’s nice actually. The early mornings when she sees Agatha are quite peaceful. Rio’s learnt that Agatha needs at least two coffees before she starts running her mouth, so on the days where Rio comes in early to get paperwork done and to sign off on orders—yeah she sees right through Agatha’s stock bluffs, the pair often just exist in each other's space.</p><p>“I don’t get it, there’s a perfectly good flat up there that you already own.”</p><p>“I’ve always maintained a ‘don’t shit where you eat’ policy.”</p><p>“I thought that meant no fucking your colleagues?”</p><p>Oh shit, <em> does it? </em></p><p>Fuck, it does. How many times has she said that before? She hopes to God that it’s never.</p><p>Face flushed, Rio says, “Well, I’m not doing that either.”</p><p>She forces herself to look at Agatha, thinks it’ll probably make her look more guilty if she avoids her gaze. Regrets it when she sees Agatha, eyes a deeper blue than usual—not that Rio spends any time waxing poetic about Agatha’s eyes, bottom lip pulled between her teeth. “What a shame.”</p><p>Rio’s breath stutters. Trust Agatha to up her flirting into something that can’t be mistaken. There it is—she has her proof that Agatha knows Rio’s attracted to her, and Agatha’s playing her, wants her to make a fool of herself so she can feel smug about it later. Probably has a lover her own age she can laugh about this with.</p><p>She has to look away. “No one’s sleeping with any colleagues, and I’m not living upstairs.”</p><p>“I mean we have evidence to prove Wanda and Vision have fucked at least once, and I’m super upset that you’ve made me think about it.” Agatha gags, “Oh fuck, they probably only do it in missionary, too.”</p><p>“Christ, alright, <em> I’m </em>not sleeping with any colleagues—employees, even. And I’m not living upstairs.” Rio doesn’t think she’s coming out of this alive.</p><p>“I just can’t believe you’d rather pay rent than live somewhere you already own.”</p><p>“It sounds stupid like that.”</p><p>“Then tell me how it sounds to you.” Agatha brushes past Rio, a hand glances her hip to steady her, which is just—why, Rio thinks, does she make moving round this kitchen harder for herself? She watches as Agatha heads to one of the fridges to grab salad ingredients. The fridge that was on Agatha’s side where she was just cleaning. It took twice as long to get there by going past Rio.</p><p>Rio shakes her head, “I don’t know. I mean, I think I’m scared that if I clear all her stuff out then that’s her gone, you know? If I go up there then I’ll start making lists of what needs to be done and then I’ll do it, I know myself.” Rio taps the spoon she’s been holding awkwardly against the palm of her other hand, “And then it’ll be empty and it’ll just be me.”</p><p>Agatha, to her credit, doesn’t stop chopping, just goes slower than normal. Maybe, Rio thinks, chest tightening a little, she knows if she stops and looks at Rio while she speaks that she’ll lose her nerve, won’t share.</p><p>“You don’t want to take over her space.” Agatha says, like the truth it is.</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer. She clears her throat, holds up her spoon, metal warm in her hand. She’ll have to get another one now so it doesn’t feel weird in her mouth, “I’ll be in the office.”</p><p>She throws the spoon into the cutlery tray to be washed and grabs another. The time it adds bolsters Agatha into speaking again when Rio’s hand is on the door.</p><p>“Why did you take it over? You clearly miss being a chef.”</p><p>“I couldn’t sell it.” Rio blinks rapidly. This is what she’s been trying to avoid since she got here.</p><p>“Your dad wouldn’t have taken it on?”</p><p>At that, a cloud settles over Rio’s mind, obfuscating anything in there besides <em> they’re all gone, they’re all gone, they’rea ll go ne th eyr e a ll gone. </em></p><p><em> Fuck </em>.</p><p>She tips forward, pressing her forehead to the cold of the door.</p><p>
<em> Breathe. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Good. </em>
</p><p>She claws back up before she gets lost in her thoughts. It’s been… a long time—now’s not the time to remind herself that it’s been so long that the number doesn’t come naturally anymore. It’s been a while since she got this upset and it almost feels silly, she’s really perfected joking about death in the way someone who has lost everyone can.</p><p>She stands up straight once more, forces a laugh but it comes out wet, embarrassing. “My dad’s been dead for like twenty years, Agatha. I think he’s a little past his prime in the hospitality industry.”</p><p>She doesn’t know why her aunt never mentioned that.</p><p>“Fuck, what?”</p><p>“Yeah, there’s uh, there’s no one else. No one else could have taken it over and I couldn’t sell it.”</p><p>“But your aunt—”</p><p>Rio spins round, “Yeah it’s weird she never told you that he’s gone, that they all are, but here we are, I guess.”</p><p>“But,” Agatha pauses like she doesn’t know how to voice what she wants, “She talked about them all the time like they were still here.” Agatha puts down her knife and comes closer, “She used to tell us where you guys were going on holiday, about your brother’s new job—”</p><p>“Okay, well he was fourteen, so.”</p><p>“Fuck, Rio. I had no—”</p><p>The door slams into Rio’s back, and she drops her fucking spoon. Agatha backs away to her section.</p><p>“Shit, Rio, are you okay?”</p><p>It’s Wanda, coming in to start her shift.</p><p>Wanda’s hands hover over her body like she wants to inspect her like she’s seen her do with Tommy when he got his hand trapped in a dumbwaiter drawer.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine.”</p><p>“Aren’t you the one always telling us not to stand in front of the door?” Wanda says, hint of amusement in her voice.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t have anything smart to say, like she usually does, getting back to her prep.</p><p>“I’m gonna,” Rio gestures to the door with a thumb, “Got stuff to do.” And makes her escape.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Later, hours into service, Rio brings up Agatha’s lack of time off.</p><p>“You’re pissed at me wanting to work?” Agatha pulls a tray out of the oven and slams it down, “Bohner! Bohner, what the fuck is this?”</p><p>“Uh—”</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh,” Agatha mocks, getting in his face. She slams a hand down next to the tray of what Rio thinks may have once been mac and cheese, narrowly avoiding burning herself. “It’s burnt, you useless cock!”</p><p>Rio tries to stifle a laugh at that but doesn’t fully manage, pushing her tongue into her cheek to hide it. She watches Agatha check the tickets she’s got on the rail. “Boss, I’m gonna need you to speak to tables 14, 3, and 6 about the mac and cheese sitch.”</p><p>Yay, Rio loves doing that.</p><p>“I will if you agree to take a few days off.”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>It’s incredibly frustrating to have a conversation with someone while they’re mid-flow. She wonders if the servers she'd speak to while she worked felt the same awkwardness she does now, watching them while she just feels like she’s getting in the way.</p><p>“Agatha, God knows why, but you’ve literally not taken a day off since I started. I don’t know if it’s the head chef thing or what but you’re gonna burn yourself out.”</p><p>“You don’t take days off either, so don’t play that card with me.”</p><p>“As you keep pointing out so helpfully, I’m your boss. Take a break. Just one day.”</p><p>Agatha slams a pan down onto the hob, “Fucking fine!”</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t come in the next day.</p><p>It’s a lot quieter, the way Rio’s used to restaurants being.</p><p>There’s no back chat when Jen asks how long her orders will be.</p><p>There's no one coming out of the kitchen just to ask her stupid questions just to get out of work for five minutes.</p><p>No ridiculous flirting.</p><p>The chefs don't miraculously change though. Rio half thought that without Agatha there to taunt them they'd work better. The lack of her seems to be having the strangest negative effect, like they don't know how to work without her.</p><p>It all feels.</p><p>Off balance.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't turn up the day after either.</p><p>They probably should have talked properly about how many days she'd take.</p><p>The weird off balance feeling remains, a black pit forming in her gut when she remembers Agatha’s not there.</p><p>She stays out of the kitchen as much as she can, even sending Lilia home early so she can take over the bar and have something else to occupy herself with that isn’t sitting in the office in silence, trying to remember how Agatha’s laugh sounds through the walls.</p><p>She can't help but feel she's done something wrong.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio's never been more relieved to see someone than she is to see Agatha on the third day.</p><p>She's in later than usual; Wanda has already done most of her prep and Alice has put the delivery away by the time she rolls in.</p><p>She has wired earphones in and she doesn't take them out when she walks through the front door. Agatha offers Rio a small wave, just a finger wiggle really. And Rio knows somethings not quite right with her then, the other woman is usually much showier in her actions, like a silent film actor.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t stop to talk to her, clocks herself in and walks through to the back without even looking at Rio again.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s not <em> avoiding </em>the kitchen but she hasn’t really gone in much today. She hasn’t needed to; it’s been a slow day. The novelty of new ownership in one of the few restaurants in Westview has clearly worn off on its residents.</p><p>She’s about to go home, earlier than usual but there’s not much need for her.</p><p>She always says goodbye to her team. In every place she’s ever worked she’s done the same. It’s polite.</p><p>So why does she feel nervous about it?</p><p>Time to put on her big boy pants and get it over with.</p><p>Rio slips into the kitchen, saying goodbye to the guy washing pots, to Vision who’s in there polishing cutlery, and to Alice.</p><p>She tries not to look too obvious as she cranes her neck for a glimpse of Agatha.</p><p>“She’s outside.” Alice’s voice cuts through.</p><p><em> Jesus </em>, Rio comes super fucking close to snapping her neck with the speed she turns her head to Alice.</p><p>And why, Rio thinks, does Alice know who she’s looking for?</p><p>Red raw heat creeps up the back of Rio’s neck which is stupid because she’s not doing anything wrong. Why her body feels the need to react like she’s been caught stealing a piece of the apple pie Alice baked this morning, she has no idea.</p><p>Briefly, Rio thinks about playing dumb. Thinks about telling Alice she doesn’t know who she means. But giving Alice reason to think more on this doesn’t seem worth it. She mumbles her thanks and heads to the door, taking care to be gentle with the fly screen she’s only just screwed back in.</p><p>She finds Agatha sat bent nearly in half on an overturned bin, smoking and scrolling on her phone.</p><p>“You’ll regret that when you’re my age.” Rio says, enjoying the way she catches Agatha off guard for once. Agatha jumps, and swivels in Rio’s direction.</p><p>“I really don’t need you preaching about my smoking.”</p><p>Rio approaches, sees how typically fidgety Agatha stills. She reaches out, wanting to prolong this new, winning feeling and takes the cigarette between her thumb and forefinger. Agatha’s fingers relax, letting Rio take it. Rio smiles down at her, brings the cigarette to her own mouth and inhales. Agatha doesn’t blink even as she takes it back.</p><p>“I meant your posture.”</p><p>Rio has the pleasure of watching Agatha correct herself straight away for the first time. Like with the two-stage cleaning, Agatha usually waits until Rio’s gone before she acts on her advice, like she doesn’t want to give her the satisfaction. She’s done it when Rio asked her to rotate her stock properly; Agatha had rolled her eyes at the time and Rio hadn’t seen her do anything about it, but the next day she came to grab milk for her coffee and found the fridge had been reorganized how she’d asked.</p><p>“How old are you anyway?”</p><p>“Almost forty.” She wonders, briefly, if Agatha will offer up her own age, but the silence lingers for long enough that she knows the opportunity has passed.</p><p>“Have you enjoyed the peace and quiet then?” Agatha asks, sniffing haughtily.</p><p>Rio thinks about lying, but says “No.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond. Maybe she wasn’t expecting Rio to be so honest. Maybe she wasn’t expecting Rio’s honest answer to be ‘no’. Instead she looks away from Rio to a bird hopping around, pecking at the ground, and Rio is afforded a brand new view of the two fresh hickies on the side of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>She can’t help herself, “Did you enjoy your time off?”</p><p>Agatha shifts around where she sits. “Not really.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrows, “No?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs, takes in Rio’s appearance, jacket on, backpack slung over her shoulder. “Were you leaving?”</p><p>“Yeah, just coming to say bye.” Agatha nods. “See you tomorrow?”</p><p>“I’m sure you will.”</p><p>Rio spends the walk home trying not to think about those hickies, about how far down they might go, about who she was with, and about if she was lying when she said she didn’t enjoy being off work.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>In the next couple of weeks, working with Agatha doesn’t put the same stress on Rio as it previously did—maybe she’ll be able to spend less money on box dye now. Sure, she still flirts with Rio at every opportunity she’s afforded but she seems to be putting more of an effort in.</p><p>Rio once caught her calling a corner and she’s been riding that high ever since.</p><p>Jen doesn’t avoid the kitchen as much as she did before, Agatha’s food is consistently good, and sometimes even looks like she’s put an effort into how it looks on the plate. Billy has even come up to her to privately thank her for making Agatha take some time off.</p><p>“She clearly needed a break.” He’d said.</p><p>Rio’s not sure that’s the reason for Agatha’s abrupt turnaround. More likely it’s because she knows Rio has the power to force her to go home again.</p><p>“So when are you going to listen to your own advice?” It’s Agatha, standing in the doorway of the office. Her chef jacket is open and she’s wearing a tank top again. Rio’s been in there for hours, sorting through loose pages of stock sheets, order forms, even old pay slips, into different boxes, ready to be taken upstairs when she’s ready. It might have to be sooner than she’d planned because she’s running out of space for the spare mops, plates, and glasses she’d had to order.</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“You sent me home but you’re yet to take a day off. Things are better now, right?” She pauses, seems to weigh it up, “Well, they’re not any worse.”</p><p>Rio huffs at the idea. She reaches up to rub at her temple. Is her oncoming headache because her hair is too tight, or is it Agatha’s presence? She pulls her hair tie out, just in case, and shakes her hair loose. “I’ve got so much to do. You know I’m kind of learning on the job, right?”</p><p>“The restaurant won’t fall down if you’re not here, Rio.”</p><p>“Oh, pot meet kettle.” Rio laughs.</p><p>Agatha folds her arms across her chest with an eye roll and leans against the door frame, “Come on, you made me stay off. It’s only fair that I make you. Take tomorrow off. When’s the last time you had a lazy Sunday?”</p><p>“I’m <em> your </em>boss. You can’t tell me what to do.”</p><p>“Can’t I?” She lowers her crossed arms slightly so that she’s pushing up her breasts. She watches Rio closely with a smirk. Rio so badly doesn’t want to give her the reaction she’s clearly looking for but her eyes drop at the last second. Agatha’s grin widens.</p><p>Rio knows she’s been played when Agatha makes a show of buttoning her chef jacket back up before she leaves.</p><p>Maybe a day away from Agatha will be good for her.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Even on her days off Rio has never been the type to lounge in bed all morning. She doesn’t set an alarm but her body clock wakes her up early anyway. She goes for a run around the neighborhood, avoiding Sage &amp; Scythe just in case she’s tempted to go in, which is unfortunate really because she’s really been wanting to grab breakfast at the coffee shop over the street. She settles for a slice of toast and instant coffee back at her apartment.</p><p>She’s not sure this qualifies as the ‘lazy Sunday’ Agatha was talking about but she does feel more relaxed than usual.</p><p>It’s 1pm and she’s just about to settle on the sofa with a book she’d bookmarked on the tenth page about five months ago, when her phone rings.</p><p>She hesitates to answer it but when she checks the screen and sees a number she now knows by heart, she picks up.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>“I really wouldn’t be calling if this wasn’t like, an emergency.” Agatha’s voice crackles through over the shitty restaurant landline phone.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“I swear I’ve had a look but I can’t find the number anywhere.”</p><p>“Agatha, you have to tell me what’s wrong or I can’t help.” Rio enunciates to try and get through Agatha’s uncharacteristic rambling.</p><p>“The dishwasher’s broken.” She says, bluntly, “I can’t find the number in the office for the repair place.”</p><p>“What’s that you said about the place not falling down?”</p><p>“Whatever, don’t help then.”</p><p>“Agatha, it’s Sunday, it’s gonna cost double to call them out.”</p><p>Rio can hear thudding on the other end of the line as Agatha shouts <em> fuuuuuuck. </em></p><p>“We’re gonna have to hand wash everything.” Rio’s already put Agatha on loudspeaker, beginning to change out of her sweatpants, into loose jeans and a t-shirt.</p><p>“We?”</p><p>“It’s too much for Billy to do by himself, I won’t ask that of him.” Rio checks herself in the mirror, still bare faced from her run this morning. It’ll have to do. “I’ll be there in a few minutes.” She buttons the call before Agatha can respond.</p><p>So much for her lazy Sunday.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>The kitchen looks like it’s been ransacked when Rio gets there. They’re only over an hour into service and already Billy’s hair is sticking up in places like he’s been stress tugging on it.</p><p>She speeds through the kitchen quickly acknowledging everyone she passes with a quick hello, pulling her old chef apron over her head, <em> Chef Rio Vidal </em>embroidered in cursive over her left breast.</p><p>Agatha bursts in a few moments later, hair wild, with her arms full of sponges, rubber gloves, and scourers. She leans over the counter top and lets everything fall into a heap. “Have at it.”</p><p>When Rio’s finished tying her apron around her back, she reaches over and touches Agatha’s elbow lightly, to get her attention. “Thanks for calling me.”</p><p>Rio’s hand falls when Agatha reaches up to re-tie her hair—she must have let it down to go to the shop. She’s already mourning it; Agatha looks beautiful with her hair down, locks hanging around her face, even in her uniform. “Yeah, well, you’ll have to thank Wanda. I didn’t want to call.”</p><p>“She can be very stubborn.” Wanda calls over her shoulder from the other side of the kitchen.</p><p>Before Rio can get away, Agatha leans in, presses her forefinger to the fleshy part in between Rio’s clavicle, murmurs softly, “Almost didn’t recognize you without one of your little gay ties.”</p><p>Rio swallows harshly, watches Agatha’s lip quirk as she can surely feel her throat bob under her touch.</p><p>Mercifully, Agatha pulls away like nothing happened.</p><p>“Looks like you’re with me.” Billy smiles hesitantly at her when Rio throws a pair of rubber gloves his way.</p><p>“It’ll be fun.” Rio hopes by speaking it, it will manifest itself into the truth.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Lilia’s not as batshit as she seems with her superstitions because Rio finds, even hours of hand scrubbing pots later, that she’s actually having fun. She doesn’t know whether she’s always managed to catch the kitchen at a bad time or whether they’re putting on their best behavior for her, but after getting through the original build up of dishes, she finds herself laughing, hooked on gossip, like she’s just another part of the team.</p><p>“I heard a rumor that Alice went on a date on Friday night.” Wanda hip checks Alice as she walks past her.</p><p>“What the hell?” Alice says, voice coming out pitchier than normal.</p><p>“Oh my God, is that why you got Darcy to cover your shift?” Billy chips in, excitedly.</p><p>“I did not go on a date.” Alice grits out, grumpily punching numbers into the microwave.</p><p>“Oh sure, you’re just wearing a turtleneck under your whites because it’s super cold in here, what with all the ovens on and everything.” Agatha chips in.</p><p>“Well, at least I have the decency to cover up!”</p><p>“Aha!” Agatha points at Alice in glee, having tricked her into a confession. “See, Teen,” She winks at Billy but he’s shoulder-to-shoulder with Rio so they can both fit their hands in the sink, and Rio can almost imagine it was directed at her. “We didn’t even have to resort to your little ‘true or false’ game.”</p><p>“Hang on,” Billy pulls his hands from the sink, flicking the water from them as he turns to face Agatha, leaning his back against the sink. “Don’t discredit the system just yet. Darcy told me you were going for drinks with Jen on Friday and that’s why you had to get cover. So, Alice, <em> drinks </em> with Jen was actually code for <em> date </em>with Jen. True or false?”</p><p>Alice spends so long panicking over her answer that it becomes an answer in its own right.</p><p>“I’ll give you that one, Teen.”</p><p>When Jen comes in to drop off plates not long after, the whole kitchen becomes a mass of stifled laughter.</p><p>“Got a <em> Kale </em>salad on order for you, Alice.” Agatha taunts.</p><p>To her credit, Jen catches on pretty quickly and grabs a fork, holding it up to Agatha’s face like a threat. “You want me to do your other elbow, Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha barks out a laugh, “With a fork?”</p><p>“You know I could do it.”</p><p>“Jen, the dishwasher is headache enough without having to dig out the injury log book.” Rio comes up behind Jen, grabbing the fork out of her hand. Jen lets it go, brushing away the soap suds Rio’s left on her.</p><p>“Can you and Jen seriously not work together without threatening bodily harm?” Rio asks once Jen leaves.</p><p>“Oh it’s not just a threat,” Agatha says, rolling up the left sleeve of her chef jacket, “Paring knife to the elbow.” There’s a thick, white scar running down her elbow, “We used to both work in the kitchen but your aunt split us up after this. She said she only kept me in the kitchen because Jen has more <em> people skills </em>than I do.”</p><p>“True or false, boss.” Billy asks when Rio returns to the sink. “You’ve cut another chef with a knife before.”</p><p>“False.” Rio answers straight away; Agatha’s <em> boooooo </em>can be heard from where she’s putting orders under the heat lamps. “I’ve definitely wanted to though.”</p><p>“Well, some say it’s the thought that counts.” Billy grins, his eyes crinkling.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>There’s an ache in Rio’s body that she hasn’t felt in years when the day finally ends. She excuses herself to the office when Agatha’s making her final kitchen checks so she can send everyone home, just to sit down for a moment. She closes her eyes, head tipped back with a groan, massaging the back of her neck.</p><p>Agatha’s voice interrupts her brief relief, “Drink?”</p><p>Rio peels open an eye to see Agatha holding an opened bottle of whisky up. She’s dressed in leggings and a t-shirt and the sight has Rio feeling a little bit insane. She’s not a highly sexual person, she can’t even remember the last time she took another woman home, so why can she feel her brain cloud over at the view of Agatha’s legs?</p><p>She holds her hand out to receive the bottle, “I hope you haven’t stolen this from the bar.” Rio takes a long sip anyway.</p><p>“Call yourself the owner and you don’t even know we don’t sell this.” Agatha tuts, lets herself step into the office and sits on the edge of the desk.</p><p>“Do I even wanna know why you have it here, then?”</p><p>Agatha swipes the bottle back, taking a sip before holding a finger to her lips, playfully, “A girl’s gotta have some secrets.” Which is funny because she’s not exactly an open book; Rio thinks she must have tons of secrets.</p><p>The silence they find themselves sitting in feels charged, and the lack of talk only offers more time for them to drink. Rio already can feel her brain getting heavier, her limbs getting looser.</p><p>“True or false,” Rio hears and belatedly realizes she’s the one speaking. Too late to stop now, she supposes, “You’ve been flirting with me.”</p><p>It mustn’t have been what Agatha was expecting to hear because she takes a moment to respond, “True.”</p><p>“You need to stop.” Rio takes the bottle from Agatha because it doesn’t look like she’s going for a sip and she’s on a roll now, but she needs some encouragement to make it through this, “It’s not fair.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I’m attracted to you, okay? And I’m guessing you know that. You’ve probably known that since I got here and it’s not fair to me to use that against me when it’s not reciprocated.”</p><p>“Rio, what?”</p><p>“I know you probably think it’s fun to flirt with me because I’m older and I’m your boss, but I don’t appreciate being made fun of.” Fuck, she sounds like a petulant child.</p><p>Agatha intercepts her hand when she goes to bring the bottle back up to her mouth. She puts it on the desk, out of reach.</p><p>“Rio, I’m not making fun of you.” One of Agatha’s hands reaches out to cup her jaw. Rio’s eyes flutter at the touch.</p><p>Slowly, Agatha leans closer, “I’m not making fun of you.” She reiterates, and she’s so close Rio can feel her whisky tinged breath on her own lips.</p><p>Rio’s not sure which one of them closes the gap in the end, but they come together in a clacking of teeth, all slow movements abandoned to a feeling of urgency.</p><p>Rio ends up pushing Agatha back when she runs out of breath. “You’re young,” She pants, “You don’t know what you want.”</p><p>Agatha snarls, gripping the back of Rio’s neck, nails digging into the skin there, “I’m twenty six, I’m capable of making my own choices.” She drags Rio back in for a messy kiss, “I want you.” She mutters into the kiss.</p><p>“<em> Fuck </em>.” Rio goes a little brainless at Agatha’s words. She stands up from her chair with such speed that it rolls away from her. Rio crowds Agatha on the desk, pulling her in by her hips.</p><p>Agatha brings her legs up to wrap around Rio’s waist and she moans into the kiss. “Do you even know how hot you look in those stupid flannel shirts and those <em> stupid </em>ties?” She licks into Rio’s mouth, “You’re like something out of one of my wet dreams.”</p><p>Rio had no idea that for as much as she’s been checking Agatha out, she’s been doing the same.</p><p>Agatha trails kisses up Rio’s neck to her ear, “So fucking handsome.” She pushes up Rio’s t-shirt with cold hands, eliciting a shiver when she scrapes her nails over her stomach.</p><p>Not wanting to feel left out, Rio does what she’s been desperate to do since she first saw Agatha and cups both her breasts in her palms over her shirt, moaning into the kiss.</p><p>Rio feels Agatha reach down and pop open the button on her jeans, and she’d have no qualms about that usually, but the months of teasing she’s had to endure has her acting a little selfishly. She stops Agatha before she can pull down her zipper with a hand around her wrist.</p><p>“Do you not li—”</p><p>“I do.” Rio quiets her with a kiss, “I do, but you make me feel so insane. I need to touch you.” Rio nudges Agatha’s chin with her nose to get her to tip her head back, exposing her throat where Rio sucks on the sensitive skin. Agatha grabs Rio’s head and pulls her back.</p><p>“Ask nicely.”</p><p>Rio should have known she’d be like this.</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>“You can do better than that.”</p><p>“I want my mouth on you,” Rio breathes out. Dirty talk isn’t part of her usual repertoire but the way Agatha’s pupils are blown out as she watches Rio speak has her questioning why. “I want your cunt in my mouth, want to feel you come on my tongue.”</p><p>Agatha looks pleased, drags Rio back into an open-mouthed kiss, “Better.” She practically purrs as she pushes Rio back with a finger.</p><p>Rio pulls back, hands going back to Agatha’s hips so she can pull her leggings down. Agatha keeps a hand around Rio’s neck to steady herself as she lifts her hips, helping Rio undress her.</p><p>Rio slips her shoes off so she can pull her leggings off entirely and when she stands back up, Agatha’s wasting no time, fingers hooked in the waist of her underwear, ready to pull them down. Rio smacks her hand away before she can get very far. “I want to do it.”</p><p>She replaces Agatha’s hands with her own, watching close as she peels the material away from Agatha’s cunt. There’s a string of slick that connects her underwear to her pussy and Rio’s mouth drops open as she watches it stretch as she continues slowly undressing her, until it breaks.</p><p>She whines, a sound she’s never heard herself make before and she pulls the material the rest of the way down, quickly.</p><p>“Are you going to be a good boy and get on your knees for me?”</p><p>Rio is slowly losing track of what’s going on, why being called <em> that </em>settles part of her that she didn’t know needed settling, and why Agatha somehow knew it would.</p><p>She nods, it’s not worth debating now, and drops to her knees with a thud that she knows she’ll regret in the morning.</p><p>Rio drops a little kiss to Agatha’s stomach, over a silvery stretch mark as Agatha spreads her thighs for her to settle between. Agatha pushes her head down with one hand, and spreads her cunt lips with two fingers with the other.</p><p>Unblinking, Rio watches as she’s offered a front seat view to how Agatha’s slick cunt clenches around nothing. She licks her lips. Agatha drags a finger through her parted folds, up to her clit that she rubs in a few tight circles, before dipping back down and gathering up more of her own wetness. She offers this to Rio who takes the finger deep into her mouth like the gift it is.</p><p>When Rio’s satisfied there’s none of Agatha’s taste left on her finger, she tips forward and buries her face in her pussy, indulges herself on the taste from the source. Agatha’s hand flies down to grip the back of her head.</p><p>Rio is hooked in an instant, not even wanting to fight Agatha’s desperate pulling of her head to get her closer. If she passes out, she passes out, she supposes.</p><p>Rio lets herself get messy with it. She’s usually precise when it comes to this but Agatha’s moans grow louder the more Rio drags her tongue around with no sense of pattern or rhythm.</p><p>When she bends a little lower, hands going to Agatha’s thighs to spread her wider for better access, she dips her tongue into Agatha’s cunt, as deep as she can get it, nose brushing against her clit and Agatha lets out a high pitched whine.</p><p>“So good, you feel <em> so </em>fucking good.” Agatha’s moan is gravelly as she grinds her hips into Rio’s face and Rio can tell she’s close, she’s getting restless with it. She strokes two fingers up the inside of Agatha’s thigh before reaching her cunt. She pulls her tongue out from inside her, resting her head on Agatha’s thigh so she can watch her own fingers stroke her, dipping teasingly inside, before pulling back out. She does it again.</p><p>“<em> Rio. </em> ” Agatha moans, hips searching for her fingers when they pull back once again. “Rio, <em> baby </em>, please, want you inside, want to come on your fingers, please Rio.”</p><p>Rio can’t deny Agatha anything when she hears her babbling like she has no idea what she’s even saying. She slips both fingers in easily, filling Agatha up in an instant. Rio can already feel her clenching around her. She fits her mouth back to Agatha, rapidly licking her clit as she pumps her fingers inside her.</p><p>“Close, so close.”</p><p>Rio’s maybe just as desperate as Agatha is for her orgasm and she accidentally scrapes her teeth over Agatha’s clit in her bid to get in closer. Before she can even think to pull back and apologize, Agatha gasps, slamming the hand that isn’t holding the back of Rio’s head against the desk as she comes.</p><p>Rio fucks Agatha through her orgasm, lowering her head from her clit when it seems to get too much and licking around her fingers still buried inside Agatha, for the come that leaks from her.</p><p>Once Agatha settles, grip loosening from Rio’s hair, she slowly slides her fingers out. She’s about to bring them up to her lips to clean them when Agatha intercepts her, leaning down shakily as she pulls Rio’s fingers up to her mouth. She takes her fingers deep, humming at the taste; her cheeks hollowing as she sucks and Rio doesn’t think she’s ever been a part of anything so mind-numbingly hot.</p><p>When she’s done and Rio’s fingers slip from her lips, she pulls Rio up for another kiss.</p><p>She’s gentler this time when she holds Rio’s face, the orgasm must have calmed her.</p><p>“I’m going to need to clean this desk.” Rio says and Agatha’s laugh is infectious, makes Rio descend into her own laughter.</p><p>Agatha pulls away, eyes soft, “Let me.” She pushes Rio back so she can stand up from the desk, reaching for her clothes. Her nose scrunches up adorably when she sees the wet patch she’s left on the desk. “You go home and I’ll lock up, alright?”</p><p>Rio kind of wants to fight her on it but Agatha’s gaze hardens, “It’s <em> my </em>mess, Rio.” Then she kisses her, the softest one of the night, and Rio knows she’s doing what Agatha does best, playing her—but she allows it. Agatha must see it on her face. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio says with a nod. She’s about to leave when Agatha’s fingers hook on her belt loop. She watches as Agatha tuts, fastens the button on her jeans.</p><p>“Could have been embarrassing for you.”</p><p>Rio flushes hot. She grabs her jacket from the back of the office chair and slings her backpack over her shoulder. She thinks about asking Agatha not to tell anyone what they did, but she knows she doesn’t need to.</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p>“Night, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>That night, when Rio sleeps, she dreams of the zoo.</p><p>Except when her hands curl around the mesh of the enclosure on instinct, she finds the leopard asleep in a sun patch, and the impala grazing on a patch of grass, and wakes up well rested.</p>

<p>When Rio was fifteen she had her first kiss. She’d managed to avoid having the experience tainted by any of the science nerds who’d asked her out in class, dodged her cool neighbor when she was thirteen—he was moving out of state and he’d leaned in when she said she had a goodbye gift for him. She’d even managed to steer clear of every member of the football team, who’d for some reason made it their mission to get through every girl in their year at their celebratory post-win house parties. And yes, Rio had managed this, mostly on account of never being invited to any of these parties—she’d kind of always been overlooked, not that she’d minded.</p><p>Instead, Rio had her first kiss with the prettiest girl in her math class.</p><p>This girl had invited her over for help on her homework. She’d turned around when they’d been given their pop quiz results back to roll her eyes at one of her friends who sat beside Rio. Her eyes had caught the <em> 96% keep up the good work! </em>on Rio’s paper and said, “Wow, Raquel! I never knew you were so smart.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t even corrected her on her name, all motor function going into trying not to dribble down her chin at having this girl’s attention on her.</p><p>“Maybe you could help me with my homework?”</p><p>So Rio had gone home with her.</p><p>They were lying on their bellies on the bed, side by side, legs kicked up in the air. They’d only gotten halfway through the worksheet when the girl leaned over and kissed Rio.</p><p>It was quick. Just a press of their lips together.</p><p>She hadn’t said anything as Rio leaned back in for a second, much longer kiss.</p><p>It all got a little blurry after that, just flashes of memories—a trauma response, her therapist had suggested, back when she was twenty five and still <em> going </em>to therapy.</p><p>The girl’s parents walked in, she remembers that.</p><p>The walk home took hours because she’d got lost, unable to see through her tear soaked vision, she remembers that.</p><p>She sobbed in her mom’s arms when she’d gotten home, <em> “Mi amorcito, you’ve had me worried sick. Where have you been?” </em>She remembers that. She doesn’t remember her face though.</p><p>She’d skipped math after walking past the girl and her friends, <em> “Oh my God, she’s such a freak, she kissed me out of nowhere. She’s probably a lesbian.” </em>She remembers that.</p><p>That sick feeling she’d had going into school that morning is scarily close to what she’s feeling now, hand on the front door to Sage &amp; Scythe.</p><p>She doesn’t necessarily think she’s going to walk in to whispers from her employees as Agatha kisses her dumb boyfriend right in front of her, but she does wonder if now that Agatha’s had what she wants from Rio, she’ll be tossed to the side.</p><p>She wishes she’d spent less time fretting over it when getting dressed this morning so she could have got in early enough to speak to Agatha on her own. It's too late now. Any time not spent swallowing to keep her breakfast from coming back up her throat was spent agonizing over her outfit choice. Should she dress like normal, stupid flannel shirt and <em> stupid </em>tie, knowing exactly how Agatha feels about that? Or should she wear something different?</p><p>If Agatha’s planning on never speaking to her again it might be embarrassing to wear an outfit she knows she likes, like a preening peacock who can’t find an interested mate. But if she <em> isn’t </em>planning on avoiding Rio for the rest of her life, and maybe even wants a repeat performance, who is she to deny Agatha what she clearly wants?</p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p>She put on the flannel and gay little tie.</p><p>“Are you going in?” It’s Wanda who breaks Rio out of her thoughts, hand on her shoulder. “You look a little frozen. Is everything okay?”</p><p>Rio wheezes out a laugh, “What? Yeah, everything’s fine. Normal, even.”</p><p>Oh my God, stop talking.</p><p>Rio pulls the door open, standing to the side to let Wanda through first—she’s a gentleman, you see. She sees the look Wanda gives her out of the corner of her eye as she slips in past her. Her heart beats a little quicker than normal and fuck, she thinks she’s just unlocked a new fear because her dumb little brain just gave her the idea that looking into Wanda’s eyes will allow her to read her thoughts.</p><p>She forcefully thinks of puppies, just in case.</p><p>Rio refrains from going into the back right away. Instead she goes behind the bar and busies herself with making a coffee that she probably won’t end up drinking because this would make it already her third one of the day. The process is mundane enough to calm her down a little, at least.</p><p>Mug in hand, Rio heads to throw her jacket and bag in the office. She makes it all the way to the closed door before she’s assaulted with the memory of last night, when she was knuckle deep in Agatha’s cunt with her dripping all over the office desk.</p><p>The kitchen door squeaks open loudly and Rio jumps into some kind of movement to keep her from looking like she’s developed an overnight fear of closed doors. She quickly swings her bag off one shoulder, fingers reaching for the zip like she’s looking for something so there’s no witnesses to her going back to the scene of the crime.</p><p>“Wanda said you just came in.”</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Caught between a rock and a hard place, Rio gives up the charade and looks up.</p><p>“Oh. Hello. Yes.” Rio says, like a loser.</p><p>There’s a pause. Rio can’t tell if it’s awkward or not.</p><p>“Maybe we should t—” Agatha begins at the same time Rio says, “I called the repair company.”</p><p>Agatha squints at Rio but doesn’t finish her thought. “Yeah, they got here about twenty minutes ago. Shouldn’t be too long, they said.”</p><p>Rio nods, “Cool.”</p><p>“Look, Rio.” Agatha takes a step forward, a strange look Rio hasn’t seen before on her face, “We’re good, right?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio hurries to say, “Everything’s fine, just…” She trails off when the kitchen door opens once again and Alice walks past wearing a knee length puffer jacket that she’s being swallowed by—she must be putting the delivery away in the freezer. Alice gives them a brief glance, but if she thinks it’s weird her and Agatha are standing ten feet apart in silence, she doesn’t say. Rio nods in the direction Alice went in when she disappears from sight, “You know.”</p><p>Agatha looks to where Alice had gone, then back to Rio. Any uncertainty she might have felt is gone from her expression. “Fucking hell, Rio, they can’t smell it on you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen, “Ag—”</p><p>“Oh shush, I’m not saying anything.” Agatha looks down the hall, then takes a couple more steps to Rio, lowers her voice and says, “I like the outfit,” A grin appears, “You wore it for me, right?”</p><p>Rio can’t help but let her eyes drop to Agatha’s lips, and then once there, drops them further and sees a light mark on Agatha’s throat. That’s <em> her. </em>That’s the shape of her mouth on Agatha’s skin. She regrets not spending very long on it now.</p><p>God, what was the question again?</p><p>Agatha breaths out a laugh through her nose, “That’s okay, I don’t need an answer. Catch you later, <em> Rio. </em>” And she walks back into the kitchen.</p><p>So the good thing is Agatha clearly neither regrets last night, nor wants to keep it a one time thing.</p><p>The bad thing is Rio has no idea how she’s going to last the day without spontaneously combusting if she has to deal with Agatha’s flirting now she knows it’s real.</p><p>Rio shrugs her jacket off, pushes the office door just slightly, then throws her bag and jacket in together, before slamming the door shut again, like she’s just thrown a grenade in there.</p><p>Paperwork can wait a little longer. No need to overwhelm herself so early in the day.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Mondays are slow. Dishwasher fixed, delivery put away and signed for, lunch service out the way, all without bumping into Agatha at all. There’s only so many times she can do laps of the restaurant before the few guests they have start to feel like they’re being watched.</p><p>She even lets Lilia do a palm reading on her, sitting at one of the many unused tables.</p><p>“If you just let me showcase my talent, maybe you’d be more willing to host a psychic night some time soon.”</p><p>Rio agrees since all she’s doing is avoiding Agatha and it’s not very productive.</p><p>She almost wants to scold herself for getting so absorbed in Lilia telling her she’s a realist; that she’s a lover of rules and a fair person. That she’s practical and responsible, but also cautious when faced with big decisions.</p><p>“Now, looking at your love line,” Rio’s fingers twitch involuntarily and she sees Lilia’s lip quirk a little at the movement, “Hm. You may be easily manipula—”</p><p>Rio pulls her hand away and clenches it into a fist on her lap.</p><p>“Sorry, just uh…”</p><p>“Cramp?” Rio can’t tell if it’s a blessing or not to have Lilia give her an out like this.</p><p>“Yes.” She looks away and then remembers, “Wait, Lilia, you’re not even on the rota today. Why are you here?”</p><p>Lilia rolls her shoulders, the picture of ease, “Oh, I wasn’t sure. I lost my copy. You have one in the office, don’t you?” She makes a move to stand up and Rio smacks a knee on the underside of the table when she jumps into action to get up quicker. She has no idea what state Agatha’s left the office in and Lilia cannot be the one to find whatever may or may not be in there.</p><p>“I’ll get it. Needed to stretch my legs anyway.” Rio says and all but runs away before Lilia can convince her otherwise.</p><p>Rio must have racked up some good karma because Agatha hadn’t lied when she said she’d clean up. Her swivel chair is neatly tucked under the desk, which looks like it’s been wiped down since it was… defiled. The bottle of whisky they’d shared is nowhere to be found, and any loose papers have been put in as neat a pile as Agatha has probably ever tried to make.</p><p>The only things that look out of place are her bag and jacket which she’d lobbed in there earlier.</p><p>Thank God, Rio breathes a sigh of relief.</p><p>She collapses onto her chair and wipes a hand over her face.</p><p>Right. The rota.</p><p>Rio leans over and pulls open the middle drawer under the desk. A luminous green sticky note with a smiley face drawn on it grabs her attention. She reaches in and her fingers get caught on the fabric the note is attached to. She pulls them both out and instantly regrets it.</p><p>Because now she’s sat at her desk, holding Agatha’s underwear—the ones she’d peeled down her legs last night.</p><p>Rio drops her head on the desk, thuds it a good few times, just to be sure she can’t wake herself up.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>She looks over to the drawer again. At the top is this week’s rota. She looks from the rota, to Agatha’s underwear, and then back to the rota. She stuffs the underwear back in the drawer, slams it closed and angrily pushes the power button on the computer.</p><p>Guess she’s printing a fucking new rota out.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>At the end of the day, Agatha makes an appearance.</p><p>“Did you like my gift?”</p><p>Rio scratches the back of her head, just for something to do before she swivels round. Today, Agatha wears wide-leg jeans and a t-shirt. It’s simple, yes but Rio’s never seen her dressed like this before; all the chefs usually opt for comfort when they get changed after a shift—Agatha sure had yesterday. Rio’s chest warms, did she dress up for her?</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Agatha licks her lips and steps inside the office, closes the door behind her and stands next to the desk. She looks down and presses a finger to where she was sat yesterday, taps it there in an almost mindless fashion, but Rio has learnt very quickly there’s not a lot of Agatha that isn’t deliberate.</p><p>“That’s funny, because Lilia said she’d see me on Wednesday when she left earlier,” She smiles at Rio like she’s about to dismantle her, “And she only specifies which day when she’s just had a look at the rota, which I know for sure she’s not carrying round in her purse, so…”</p><p>God, she’s good.</p><p>Agatha puts a foot between Rio’s and nudges. Rio acquiesces, spreads her legs.</p><p>“Why would you lie to me?” She says, stepping between Rio’s spread legs. She looks down at her before reaching out to grab Rio’s tie. Gentle, she pulls it up. She doesn’t pull Rio, just runs the length of the tie between her fingers. “After you were such a good boy for me yesterday, too.” She pouts.</p><p>And though her tie is still hanging loose in Agatha’s hand, the noise Rio makes is strangled nonetheless.</p><p>“Oh, Rio.” Agatha coos, “You’ve waited all day for everyone to go home, haven’t you?”</p><p>There’s no point in lying. Agatha can see right through her.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Tell me something,” Agatha lets go of her tie so she can run a thumb over Rio’s bottom lip. Rio tries to catch it in her mouth but Agatha’s much quicker. “Did you touch yourself when you went home last night?”</p><p>Lungs heavy, Rio breathes, “No.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I—” Rio knows there’s a right answer here and it’s the one that’s the truth so she says, “I wanted it to be you.”</p><p>She knows she’s right when Agatha pounces. She draws Rio into a kiss, hands on both her cheeks. Rio feels a little less self-conscious about her desperation because she can tell that for all of Agatha’s teasing, she’s been waiting for this just the same.</p><p>Agatha kisses her like she’s been starved of it. She kisses her like she’s spent all her previous lifetimes learning the shape of Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“Love that I get to do this with you dressed like this,” She speaks against Rio’s lips, “You looked good yesterday but this?” She does pull Rio up by her tie this time, melding them closer, “You look so hot all dressed up.”</p><p>“So do you.”</p><p>Agatha pulls back, “You noticed, huh?”</p><p>Rio nods, head spinning like she’d gulped down the same amount of whisky she’d had last night, except this time it’s all Agatha. “I notice a lot about you.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression is unreadable for just a split second, but then she leans back in and Rio doesn’t think any more of it.</p><p>Their mouths are attached for so long Rio starts to feel a crick in her neck. It’s something she wouldn’t have complained about when she was younger but she’s thirty nine now, and she respects her body’s needs too much. As though they share a hive mind, just as Rio is about to pull back, Agatha drops to her knees between Rio’s legs, albeit much more gracefully than Rio had yesterday.</p><p>“I kinda don’t even wanna undress you.” Agatha says, running a hand down Rio’s chest.</p><p>“I’m not sure I feel great about being naked at work, so that works for me.”</p><p>Agatha seems to consider that. The way she’s knelt between Rio’s legs makes her think she’d been planning to eat Rio out but there’s not really a way she can do that without undressing her.</p><p>“Stand up,” She says, and she gets up as well, pulling Rio when she lags. She pushes Rio against the desk, much like Rio had her yesterday. She pulls Rio’s shirt from where it’s tucked into her pants, strokes lightly over the skin on her stomach before dipping down to touch the fastening of her pants. “This okay?”</p><p>Rio nods, and Agatha pops the button on her pants. Their eyes meet when Agatha starts pulling down her zipper. Once all the way down, Agatha rests her hand just under Rio’s bellybutton, thumb brushing over the small strip of hair on her lower stomach, her fingers touching the thick waistband of Rio’s underwear. Agatha breaks eye contact to look down, “Are you wearing boxer briefs?”</p><p>Rio’s face heats up, “They’re comfy.”</p><p>But she doesn’t think Agatha was looking for an actual response because she instantly latches on to Rio’s neck with a groan, hand slipping past her underwear, brushes past her pubic hair and dragging her fingers through Rio’s cunt.</p><p>Open-mouthed, Rio lets out a moan and Agatha bites into the side of her neck in response. She slides her fingers up, slicking Rio’s clit up and rubbing it in circles.</p><p>“Fuck, yes.”</p><p>“You like that?” Agatha detaches from Rio’s neck to watch her. It’s a little overwhelming and Rio has to close her eyes.</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>Agatha keeps on circling her clit, and Rio can feel herself hurtling toward her orgasm much faster than she’d like. To regain some leverage, she reaches for Agatha’s jeans, unbuttoning them with a serendipitous amount of ease. She slides her own hand into Agatha’s underwear as she jerks on Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>Agatha moans when she reaches her destination, and her free hand comes up to grip Rio’s cheek. “This is about you.” She says through a moan.</p><p>“You can’t multitask?” Rio manages to say, and then they’re both rubbing each other's clits and breathing into each other's mouths.</p><p>When Rio slips her fingers down to tease Agatha’s entrance, Agatha sighs out, “Yeah, inside.” And the hand from her cheek reaches down to hold her arm, as if to reinforce her words.</p><p>The angle is so fucking terrible for her wrist but how can she say no? So she slips two fingers into her cunt to the best of her ability and lets Agatha lean her further onto the desk.</p><p>Rio grinds herself into Agatha’s fingers in time to the fingers inside Agatha and a moan mixed with a chuckle leaves Agatha’s mouth. “That’s it, Rio, fuck me.”</p><p>It’s not possible with how clothed they are but Rio can almost picture Agatha properly riding her fingers, just like this and she whines, barely even caring how close she is anymore, she just wants to come. Her movements become jerky and she loses her rhythm a little and Agatha must know because she grips Rio’s jaw and says her name.</p><p>Rio meets Agatha’s gaze and sees that Agatha looks about just as wrecked as she feels, face flushed and loose strands of hair stuck to her face, “Good boy, come for me.” And Rio does, just like that. As if she’s been trained to do it on command.</p><p>It’s the most powerful orgasm she’s had in a long time and she nearly feels bad about losing all ability to move, to keep fucking Agatha, until she feels Agatha clench around her fingers with a loud moan, before she slumps into Rio’s neck.</p><p>They stay like that for a moment, just breathing together. It’s Agatha who moves first—she could have put money on that. She presses a kiss to Rio’s neck before she rises; Rio lets her fingers slip from her cunt with a wince when her wrist pops at the motion.</p><p>“So,” Agatha says. She brushes back the little hairs that stuck to her forehead. “I’m thinking we should do this again,” She looks into the air with a pout, like she’s seen people thinking and is replicating it. Rio’s sure this isn’t a new thought for Agatha, “I’m thinking we should <em> keep </em>doing it.”</p><p>“Okay, Agatha.” Rio pants, trying to stop herself when she sees Agatha isn’t. Shit, is she old?</p><p>Agatha looks pleased. “Don’t avoid me tomorrow, alright? If we’re going to do this you need to learn to have a bit of discretion.”</p><p>Rio’s not convinced Agatha knows the meaning of the word, but nods anyway.</p><p>Agatha removes her fingers from Rio’s pants, sliding them into her own mouth, humming at the taste. “Maybe I’ll get to taste you properly next time.”</p><p>And well, thank fuck Rio’s leaning against the desk because she feels her knees go a little weak at the thought.</p><p>“I’ll clean up again?” Agatha poses it like a question but her eyes say there’s no room for argument.</p><p>“Alright.” Rio nods and starts collecting her things. “Oh, and you can take your <em> gift </em>back, thank you.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, “You’re no fun.”</p><p>“<em> Goodbye, </em>Agatha.” Rio gets a finger wiggle in response and she tries not to think about how those same fingers had just made her come. She fails, clearly.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>So Rio takes Agatha’s advice and doesn’t try to avoid her after that. But if Rio thought Agatha’s flirting was bad before, it’s even worse now.</p><p>Rio’s in the kitchen talking to Alice, “So I was thinking,” Alice is very expressive; she talks a lot with her hands. Not in the way Agatha does, like it’s a spectacle, but because Alice is passionate about a lot of the things she talks about. “What about adding a new dessert to the menu?”</p><p>Rio likes that she’s being consulted about these things, she <em> is </em>a chef who has worked in Michelin star restaurants around the world so she does kind of know what she’s talking about. She likes that at least part of her team is willing to try new things, is shapeable in some way. She wouldn’t have thought so when she first started.</p><p>“Go on…”</p><p>“Well, you know how we have shit loads of vodka from when we couldn’t figure out how to stop the order?”</p><p>Yes, Rio remembers. More accurately, she remembers seeing the figures on her profit and loss sheet and nearly losing her eyeballs out of her skull when she saw how much money she was spending on that auto-vodka.</p><p>“Vaguely.”</p><p>“Well I was thinking maybe I could put it in a cake or something—adults only, of course—”</p><p>Rio’s mind spins deadly fast, “Vodka, pineapple and chilli sponge cake, yes absolutely, make it happen.”</p><p>Alice looks like she might vibrate out of her skin with excitement and Rio catches her shooting a grin past her shoulder. Rio whips round to see Jen, eyes softened like she’s never seen on her before—it’s not meant for her, she knows, Jen is staring right past her, at Alice.</p><p>Rio imagines Alice has used Jen as something of a soundboard for this idea—can picture Alice’s frantic rambling and Jen’s total engagement in whatever she has to say.</p><p>Jen’s eyes shift, harden, when she realizes Alice isn’t the only one looking at her. “Creep.” She directs at Rio.</p><p>Rio shrugs. Fair enough.</p><p>She turns to leave as Agatha bustles past behind her, “Hot, behind.” She calls and it stops Rio in her tracks. Is Agatha actually… accurately using kitchen code?</p><p>She looks over her shoulder and sees Agatha carrying a tray of uncooked mushrooms. “Just ‘behind’ will do, Chef, though I appreciate you making the effort.”</p><p>Before she gets very far, Agatha comes up behind her, leans in close and speaks in a low voice, “Was talking about your ass in those pants.” And promptly walks away without another word.</p><p>This, on top of the, “True or false, <em> boss </em>? You like pussies.” And a subsequent picture of a black cat shown on Agatha’s phone from a couple of days ago, and the, “Oh Rio never has fun. Please don’t accuse her of it.” Said with an accompanying wink after Rio had just been pressed up against a gastro of blooming steaks in the walk-in fridge, Agatha’s tongue in her mouth, days before that, has Rio near losing her mind.</p><p>They don’t have sex every day.</p><p>Though Agatha would probably encourage it, what with her never-ending well of libido, Rio has been trying to draw as little attention to their new relationship as she can, and that means sometimes going home when she’s finished work so as not to look like she’s hanging around, waiting for Agatha.</p><p>They are having <em> a lot </em>of sex though.</p><p>Unfortunately, so that suspicions aren’t raised, all of this sex has been happening mostly clothed in the restaurant office after work. Strangely it’s still some of the best sex of Rio’s life.</p><p>No wonder Agatha’s so fixated on her ass—she’s never even properly seen it.</p><p>All of this comes to a head when Rio puts in a call to get new security cameras fitted. When the cops had turned up a few days ago, trying to find evidence of a vandal, she’d shown them into the office, pulled up the security footage screen on the computer with only a little bit of a struggle, thank you very much, and had been mortified to be informed that they were pretty much just there for show and that none of the cameras were actually <em> recording </em>any of their footage.</p><p>Fucking fantastic.</p><p>So she’s having to shell out on having a whole new system fitted.</p><p>She’s listening to this guy—John, maybe, explaining to her how to use it, how to pull up the live feed, how to zoom in on footage from just one of the cameras, how to pull up the recorded footage in the future, and believe her, Rio is a very good listener. But out of the corner of her eye, she sees from the camera in the bottom corner of the screen, Agatha, waving an arm in front of the camera to grab her attention from where she’s standing by the outside walk-in fridge.</p><p>And because Rio has grown well acquainted with Agatha’s particular brand of insanity, she kicks a leg out, making contact with John's bag, sending the contents spilling out onto the floor. He mutters and bends down to collect his things.</p><p>Rio’s eyes never leave the screen where she sees Agatha unbutton her chef jacket, and lift her t-shirt up over her tits.</p><p>She’s not even wearing a bra.</p><p>As quick as she’d done it, she covers herself up again and Rio watches her light a cigarette and pull her phone out of her pocket like nothing ever happened.</p><p>And for as much as Rio is annoyed by the display, she’s also made so very aware that she’s desperate to have Agatha completely bare for her. Wants to lay her out and worship her properly.</p><p>(Later, when she gets Agatha alone she tells her, “You cannot do that again.”</p><p>She has Agatha on her lap on the desk chair. Agatha bites Rio’s lip then sinks down onto three fingers, taking them deep, “You gonna punish me, big boy?”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, “Yeah, I’ll spank you later.”</p><p>“Promise?”)</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>As luck would have it, a solution presents itself to Rio only days later. There’s a single silver key with a faded photograph keyring attached to it of her aunt with her dad from when they must have been in their twenties. Rio hasn’t tried it but logic tells her this must be the key to the flat above the restaurant.</p><p>She’s ready, she thinks. Rio’s been working here long enough now that this feels like <em> her </em>restaurant rather than her aunt’s and so resolves to open the final door to her final family member’s home.</p><p>She tells Agatha this when she walks past her with an empty cardboard box, ready to fill it with old paperwork so she can finally be rid of it. There’s no one else to share with and maybe telling Agatha will stop her from putting it off any longer.</p><p>To her surprise, “I’ll take an early break. You finish packing your boxes and I can start taking things upstairs?” Agatha offers her assistance.</p><p>Taking advantage of Rio's shock at her selfless act, Agatha picks up one of the boxes from just inside the doorway as Rio fumbles around to find where she put the key.</p><p>Agatha’s lips quirk into a strange sort of half-smile. She's gone by the time Rio has the keyring looped around one finger, with a, “Gotcha.” She grunts and darts out from the corridor and into the restaurant, to where Agatha is heading towards the flat door.</p><p>“Don’t you need these?” Rio smirks. It’s not often she can one-up Agatha.</p><p>“Oh,” Wide-eyed, Agatha shifts her grip on the box and holds her hand out for the keys. “Must be losing brain cells with all those mind-numbing orgasms you’ve been giving me.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head, no she's not responding to that.</p><p>She’s packed two boxes and Agatha still hasn’t come back from her first trip. Rio bites the inside of her cheek. Yeah, she should have guessed Agatha would be a snoop, really.</p><p>She picks up a box—she should have done this herself to begin with, and heads to the flat entrance.</p><p>From the bottom of the stairs she can hear Agatha shuffling around, but when she pushes open the door at the top of the staircase, she’s nowhere to be seen. The box Agatha had carried up is on the floor just a few steps into the living room. Rio tuts and puts her own on top of it.</p><p>The living room is cute, if basic. Rio’s love of plants must come from her aunt and she smiles at the addition to the image of Estella she’s been curating in her mind. Rio steps over to a cluster of them, fingers stroking over a dead leaf, berating herself for not coming up sooner. If she had, these plants may still have had a chance.</p><p>Rio forces herself to look away—can’t think like that.</p><p>Her attention is caught on a cupboard in the corner of the room. Apart from the dead foliage it’s the only thing that really stands out, one of its doors ajar. She hears a muffled clunk from down the hall somewhere and Agatha saying <em> fuck </em>but her attention has shifted now, and Rio’s a little like a dog with a bone.</p><p>When she opens the door, half of the contents promptly spill out like they’d been haphazardly stuffed inside. A half-zipped duffle bag lands on her feet and she can see that it’s full of clothes. Rio’s eyes catch on a lace thong, and she’s not one to judge but she can’t imagine it’s something her 75 year old aunt was wearing.</p><p>It is painfully familiar though.</p><p>She looks back up, unable to stop herself and she tugs out a quilt. With it, as though it had been wrapped up inside, she finds a stuffed rabbit. Rio holds it in her hands, it’s fur soft under her touch. She strokes the back of a finger over it, in the direction the fur sits, all the way down to one of its feet. The material changes and Rio tips the foot up to see a name embroidered on the bottom of it.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha breathes from somewhere behind her.</p><p>Rio turns and the expression on Agatha’s face is unlike any she’s seen on her before. Her eyebrows are knitted together, her skin is pale, even more so than usual, and her mouth opens and closes a few times, like she’s starting, then restarting, trying to find the most logical excuse.</p><p>“It’s not what it looks like.” Is what she settles on—which is weak.</p><p>“So you’re…” Rio looks away from Agatha’s face and, with a clearer picture than when she first came up, sees a pillow on the sofa that Agatha must have missed in her rapid tidying, “Not living up here?”</p><p>Agatha swallows—Rio can hear it. “Okay, so maybe it’s exactly what it looks like.”</p><p>Rio nods, and looks around again, trying to recollate her memories of Agatha from the time she’s known her.</p><p>Yes, it does make sense now why Agatha never leaves.</p><p>She tugs her lip between her teeth with a hum.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha says again.</p><p>“Just… give me a second.”</p><p>Agatha nods, and then she refocuses her line of sight to the rabbit in Rio's hands. Rio looks at it again too. It's in good condition for something that must be quite old now. With the way it was tucked up with the quilt, Rio can imagine Agatha as a child, hugging this rabbit under her chin as she falls asleep.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>“Alright?” Agatha repeats back. “Alright what?”</p><p>“This is fine.” At Agatha’s incredulous look, Rio clarifies, “You… staying. It's fine.”</p><p>The look on Agatha’s face doesn't change but Rio doesn't know what else to say to make her understand.</p><p>“Just like that?”</p><p>This gives Rio pause, “Like what?”</p><p>Rio’s not sure Agatha even knows what she’s trying to say as she watches her gesticulate. She reaches up to her head and when she realizes she can’t bury her hands in her own hair with it being scraped back for work, she lets out a growl and balls up her fists. “Why?” She says.</p><p>“Agatha, I need this to store paperwork. You…” Agatha is clearly unhappy and Rio doesn’t know whether vocalizing the situation will make it worse, “It’s not a hard choice, is all.”</p><p>Agatha still looks flighty, so Rio changes tactics. “Hey, this just means we have somewhere other than the office to… you know.”</p><p>Agatha snorts, “Rio, you’re forty, you can say we’re fucking.”</p><p>“I’m thirty nine.” She says but she can’t be mad if it gets Agatha out of her own head.</p><p>Rio watches Agatha with a small smile, sees how her face changes, body relaxes. She steps toward Rio, eyes glinting, “Does this mean I finally get to eat you out?” She says once she’s within distance of sharing the same breath.</p><p>Rio looks down when she feels a tugging from her hand, sees how Agatha is trying to pull the rabbit toy from her grip. She can’t help the teasing grin that makes its way onto her face. “So, did <em> you </em>name the bunny Nicholas or did he come like that?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look embarrassed at her mention of her bunny toy as Rio thought she would. She sucks in a breath and tugs a little harder. Rio loosens her grip so she doesn’t accidentally cause any damage to him.</p><p>“Do you want me to eat you out or not?” Agatha presses a palm to Rio’s hip.</p><p>And, well, Rio’s only human so she lets all thoughts of the rabbit slip from her mind in favor of leaning into Agatha’s touch, hips pressing forward in lieu of an answer.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t waste time, then. She tugs Rio in with that hand on her hip, her other going to Rio’s neck, lips smashing together in a meteoric kiss.</p><p>It feels big, this moment. Rio realizes it when Agatha brings her hands to Rio’s tie, loosening it. It barely hits the floor before Agatha is making a start on her shirt buttons, and she registers how she’s going to be bared for Agatha to see.</p><p>Rio rips open the buttons on Agatha’s chef jacket, not wanting to let this moment pass her by, both of them shrugging out of their layers when they’re fully undone, as Rio blindly starts pushing Agatha in the direction of the sofa, not wanting to break the kiss.</p><p>“Wait, wait.” Agatha mumbles and Rio backs out of the kiss.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Agatha kisses her nose, an oddly sentimental gesture that she looks only slightly disgusted with herself for doing. “No, nothing, just,” She glances towards the sofa, “I have to sleep there, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s brows furrow and she stifles a laugh, “There’s no bed?”</p><p>“Rio, I haven’t been sleeping in your aunt’s bed. What the fuck?”</p><p>Rio can’t stop the laugh bubbling up from her stomach, “You’ve been breaking into her flat every night but sleeping in her bed is too far?”</p><p>“It just feels a bit…” She shivers dramatically.</p><p>“Remind me to buy you a new bed.” Rio takes the break in their kiss as an opportunity to start pulling up Agatha’s t-shirt. Agatha helps, raises her arms to get it over her head, then reaches for the fastening on Rio’s pants.</p><p>She shoves them down Rio’s legs, then says, “Lie down.” And before Rio has a chance to ask where, Agatha pushes her shoulder, “Floor.”</p><p>So Rio drops to the floor and she thinks she’d feel a lot more exposed about being near naked on her back on a rug in the middle of the living room but Agatha drapes herself over her while the thought is only half-formed.</p><p>Rio spreads her hands over Agatha’s back as they meet in another kiss. She’s had her hands on Agatha before but never without a shirt. Her fingers catch on Agatha’s bra and she hurries to unhook it, moans when she succeeds and drags the straps down Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>Agatha seems unwilling to break the kiss just yet so Rio settles for getting her hands on Agatha’s back once more; it feels different, more real, and she digs the tips of her fingers into the skin there, desperate to feel every part of Agatha bend to her will.</p><p>Agatha eventually pulls away, pushes herself up and Rio doesn’t have the self restraint it would take to not look down at Agatha's breasts. Maybe she’d feel guiltier if her only previous view hadn’t been on a grainy security camera, but alas.</p><p>Rio fits her hands between their bodies, cups Agatha’s breasts in both hands, fingers splayed to hold as much as possible, thumbs flicking out over her nipples. Rio smirks as Agatha’s elbows go a little weak and she falters, head drooping, nose pressing to the space between Rio’s brow.</p><p>When she recovers from Rio’s move, Agatha starts to shift, dropping kisses to Rio’s exposed skin as she makes her way down her body. She scrapes her teeth over Rio’s hip when she starts to pull her underwear down, lets out a breathy chuckle at the shiver it produces.</p><p>“You too.” Rio chokes out, and gestures to Agatha’s pants when she raises a brow. “Please.”</p><p>Agatha shimmies out of her work pants but keeps her underwear on. Before she returns to Rio she grabs the pillow that had been left on the sofa, taps Rio softly, “Hips.”</p><p>Rio lets Agatha slip the pillow under her and whines when Agatha comes back, licks a strip up her lower stomach that ends in a small bite. She shuffles down, leaving more kisses as she goes, settles between Rio’s spread legs.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio,” Agatha sighs, bringing a finger up to lightly part her cunt, “I haven’t even touched you and I can see how wet you are.” She adds a second finger, and Rio props herself up on her elbows to watch how Agatha spreads her open with those fingers, eyes zeroed in on her cunt.</p><p>It doesn’t take long for Rio to grow restless; having Agatha’s eyes on her is intoxicating and when she blows out air, Rio nearly knocks her hips up into Agatha’s chin. “Agatha,” She says, shifting her weight onto one elbow so she can reach down to touch Agatha’s head, “Agatha, please.” Her fingers twitch but she’s unable to find purchase.</p><p>And Agatha, because she always knows what Rio wants before even Rio does when it comes to this, rags the tie from her hair, allowing it to cascade around her face. Rio groans, sinks her fingers into the thick mass of hair.</p><p>In her distraction, Agatha slots her mouth to Rio’s cunt and—<em> fuck </em> it’s insane how desperate Rio already feels just from the first touch of Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>She gasps out, fingers tightening in Agatha’s hair as she drags her tongue hot and heavy over Rio’s clit, then backing away when Rio bucks her hips into her touch.</p><p>“Stay still.” She murmurs but the words are said with her lips pressed to Rio’s clit and the vibrations have Rio collapsing onto her back, hips seeking more, more, more.</p><p>“Can’t—” Rio brings her other hand to Agatha’s hair, pulling her in and Agatha dips her tongue down briefly to where she’s dripping—<em> shit, </em> she’s <em> so </em>fucking wet, Agatha’s going to be covered in her when they’re done.</p><p>But as quick as the touch came, it is quickly taken away. She looks down through hooded eyes and sees Agatha smirking up at her, licking over her lips at the wetness Rio’s left on her. She bites the inside of Rio’s thigh, “Needy thing.” She says, voice deep—Rio swears she feels it in her spine.</p><p><em> Fuck, </em>she needs to get Agatha’s mouth back on her before she comes just to the sound of her voice.</p><p>“I want—<em> please. </em>” She hears herself say, hears how pathetic she sounds, and watches how Agatha preens as she sees just how desperate Rio is for her.</p><p>Thankfully, Agatha doesn’t make her wait any longer, licks into Rio, drags new slick up to her clit and then <em> sucks. </em></p><p>Rio survives, just barely, that first bid for her orgasm, but loses instantly the moment Agatha, still with her mouth around her clit starts flicking over it with her tongue, and she comes, Agatha’s name butchered on her breath.</p><p>Agatha hums and then when Rio’s stopped shaking under her, presses a kiss to Rio’s pubic hair before pushing her way back up Rio’s body.</p><p>Rio pulls her down into a wet and messy kiss, tasting herself on Agatha’s tongue.</p><p>“Good?” But Agatha looks smug so she knows the answer already.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes.</p><p>“What?” Agatha grins, mouth still shiny, “You’re always saying we should strive for positive feedback.”</p><p>Rio tips her head back with a groan, “On your food, dumbass.”</p><p>“I mean, <em> I </em>ate.”</p><p>While Agatha is distracted laughing at her own joke, Rio rolls them over so she has Agatha pinned beneath her.</p><p>“You’re very annoying.” She says, but she can feel herself smiling so it’s probably not as effective as she’d like.</p><p>“I do try.”</p><p>Rio kisses her softly to stop her from saying anything else.</p><p>“We should probably head back down.”</p><p>Rio fishes around for her pants, pulling her phone from one of its pockets. “Fuck, we’ve been gone way too long.” She rolls off of Agatha and reaches for the rest of her clothes with a grimace when she feels the wet patch on her underwear, but she has no choice but to put them back on.</p><p>She sees Agatha redressing out of the corner of her eye and that’s when she remembers—</p><p>“That time I sent you home,” Agatha hums, not looking at her as she rebuttons her jacket, “Where did you go?”</p><p>When Agatha looks up she’s not quite looking at Rio but somewhere else—a memory perhaps. “Eastview.” She finally says.</p><p>“Who do you know in Eastview?”</p><p>“Hm?” Agatha looks so caught up in her thoughts that it takes her a second to register Rio’s words, “Oh, uh, no one.”</p><p>She finally looks at Rio, must see the confusion laid out on her face, “That was kinda the point. I, uh, went home with someone.”</p><p>Yes. The hickies.</p><p>Rio’s never really been one for casual sex, feels like maybe it’s not normal to feel this hot flash of jealousy when she remembers Agatha is well within her right to sleep with whoever she wants.</p><p>(Rio’s beginning to think this might not be <em> just </em>sex for her.</p><p>She squashes the thought down before it can take hold and make her do something stupid.)</p><p>“This is going to sound so dumb but I didn’t exactly have a plan so I just went home with first girl who showed me any interest and, uh,” Agatha scuffs her foot across the floor, a rare moment of real embarrassment, “I managed to convince her to let me stay the next night too.”</p><p>Rio nods—knows logically that Agatha slept with someone else that night, had seen the evidence for herself, but that doesn’t stop her skin from prickling.</p><p>“Yeah, no, that,” Rio clears her throat, “Makes sense.”</p><p>“Rio—”</p><p>“No, no I’m serious, I’m glad you weren’t just like… on the street.” She pushes her tongue into her cheek at how stupid she sounds; then before Agatha can respond to whatever the fuck that was, she holds out the keys to the flat, “Here. They’re yours now.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha takes them, “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio nods once, decisive, turns to head to the door, “Oh, I do still need you to store some things up here for me though.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“And we should,” Rio reaches for the door handle, “Probably head down separately.”</p><p>“But <em> boss </em>,” Rio’s already rolling her eyes, preempting her response for the shit about to leave Agatha’s mouth, “I was just helping you with your paperwork.” She gasps, eyes sparkling in delight, “Isn’t that why you called me up here? Do I need to contact HR, boss?”</p><p>Rio leaves, slamming the door behind her. She can still hear Agatha’s cackle as if she were in the room with her.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>For as much as having the conversation about Agatha’s lack of accommodation seemed to be the worst thing Rio had ever done to Agatha at the time, it did make her much happier in the following weeks.</p><p>She was actually able to work shorter shifts, not working both the open <em> and </em>the close in the same day now that she wasn’t trying to hide where she was living from Rio. She was a lot less short-tempered with her staff and she seemed to enjoy having somewhere that wasn’t a cramped office to have sex in—not that Rio would have thought otherwise.</p><p>As for her own time off, Rio had been able to justify shutting the restaurant on Mondays as a compromise to be able to take a break without having to worry the roof would blow off while she wasn’t there.</p><p>All in all, everything is going well.</p><p>On the approach to Mother’s Day, Rio sees an uptick in bookings—definitely one of the busiest days for them so far, though not as many as she would have thought.</p><p>It’s Wanda that has to remind her, “Most men are useless and forget when Mother’s Day is until they’re reminded the day before. It’ll get busier.” She’s doing prep work this morning, happy to take some of those shifts from Agatha when the rota was being changed.</p><p>“Oh that reminds me—” Rio stops herself, hand pausing on the fork she’s polishing, “Not that—I’m not saying—” She swallows and restarts, “That was poorly timed, I’m not saying Vision is…”</p><p>Wanda stays silent, rests her knife on the chopping board and waits, like she’s <em> enjoying </em>watching Rio fail at the English language.</p><p>“No, go on.” She smiles, serene. Rio hates how she can keep her cool like that. She’d call her a bitch if she weren’t her boss.</p><p>“Just, I keep meaning to offer you the day off, that’s all.”</p><p>“And do what?” Wanda laughs, picking her knife back up, terrifyingly calm mask dropped, “No, seriously. My whole family works at the only decent restaurant in Westview. What would I do if I don’t come in?”</p><p>And when Mother’s Day rolls around, Rio’s so fucking glad Wanda didn’t take her up on her offer.</p><p>Like Wanda had predicted, there are a lot of walk-ins and last minute bookings, presumably made by the mothers themselves after realizing their partners hadn’t done it for them, and the restaurant is running on frenzied energy.</p><p>Rio’s hosting today as well as acting as a runner when the servers are too busy to collect their orders, which is a lot.</p><p>“Hands!” At least she gets to hear Agatha <em> actually </em> using kitchen code today. “Fucking <em> hands </em>! Oh my God, it’s like talking to a fucking brick wall.” Well. At least she’s trying.</p><p>Ralph makes a grab for the plates on the pass and Agatha roars at him, “Not you, you’ll ruin every mother’s day by showing your face out there.” She reaches through to the other side of the pass and grabs hold of one of his ears. “Come on, Wanda, is he ruining your day?”</p><p>Rio steps in, taking the plates herself, “I think he’s ruining <em> your </em>day.”</p><p>Agatha grumbles and turns away from her.</p><p>When she goes back to the kitchen a little later she’s shocked to find Lilia there, standing in the back corner of the kitchen with Agatha, heads close together as Lilia says something to make her laugh. She almost goes over there to send Lilia back out front—they’re getting absolutely slammed on wine orders today, when she sees Lilia cup Agatha’s face in her hand, thumb brushing over her cheek.</p><p>What compels her even further to keep watching is the way Agatha doesn’t shrug her away.</p><p>Lilia leaves right after that, “I’m going, I’m going.” She holds her hands up to cement her innocence as she walks past Rio.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio says, voice quiet to Agatha.</p><p>“Hm?” Agatha doesn’t spare Rio a glance as she checks on her linguine. “Oh, Lilia?” Agatha’s voice is loud in her response, meant to draw attention, “Yeah we were just talking about my <em> bitch </em> of a mother. Kinda ruined this day for me, but it’s not like I’m the only one with <em> mommy </em>issues in this kitchen, I mean, Jesus, fuck. Is there anyone here with a mother that’s still alive?”</p><p>She’s turned to the rest of the staff at this point, hands raised in question as she looks around the room.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye Rio sees Billy start to raise his hand, but then must think better of it, redirecting his movement to look like he’s itching his head.</p><p>“Your mother’s dead?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha says, resolutely. But then she side eyes Rio, “No.” And then she rolls her eyes—last one, now, “Maybe. Who cares?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t wait for an answer.</p><p>“No, actually. I <em> do </em>care.” She slams a deep plate down onto the counter, glares at it when it chips, pushes it to the side and grabs a new one. “I hope she’s dead,” She says, “And I hope it was painful.” She adds, for good measure.</p><p>Rio nods, watches Agatha reach for the pan of linguine, stops her with a hand on her wrist as she’s about to pour it onto the plate. “Can I?” She nods at the pan. Agatha doesn’t respond but she also doesn’t move to carry on so Rio darts to grab a pair of tongs. She picks up the linguine with the tongs and twists it as she plates it up in the center of the dish. “I hope that too.” She says when she’s done, meeting Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>It’s maybe not what Agatha was expecting. She just watches Rio like she’s waiting to catch her in a lie.</p><p>“You’re so weird, Vidal.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio smiles, no teeth, wants to make her mouth soft for Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes drop to her lips and for a split second she rocks forward—catches herself before she incriminates herself and shakes her head, trance broken.</p><p>“Rio, there’s a guy at the bar <em> swearing </em> he made a booking weeks ago,” Tommy says from somewhere to the left of her. When Rio looks over he looks a little sweaty, like he’s been running around out there all day—he probably has. “ <em> I’m </em> pretty sure he’s a damn—”</p><p>“<em> Tommy. </em>” Wanda’s voice rings out from across the kitchen.</p><p>“—liar.”</p><p>Rio grits her teeth and hopes her face falls into something resembling niceness by the time she gets out there.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>It’s a late finish that night with how busy they had been all day. Rio’s helping Lilia close the bar down when Agatha walks past, carrying her chef jacket under her arm. She sends a smirk Rio’s way and very plainly delights in the way Rio nearly drops the glasses she’s putting away. Rio watches her until she’s out of sight and—is she swaying her hips more than usual?</p><p>It’s only when Agatha rounds the corner to where the flat entrance is that she notices Lilia staring at her pointedly, but ultimately—<em> blessedly </em>doesn’t say anything.</p><p>Rio chokes on her own spit and looks away. She is absolutely not having whatever conversation Lilia so clearly wants to have.</p><p>When they’re finished shutting down, Rio grabs her things from the office, walks Lilia to the door and makes a show of setting the alarm and pushing the key in the lock.</p><p>She groans, patting herself down with the hand not holding the keys, “Damn, I left my phone in the office,” She turns the alarm off, “Lilia, you can go if you want, I don’t want to keep you.”</p><p>Lilia purses her lips for a moment, then says, “I hope you know what you’re doing.”</p><p>Rio gulps, hopes Lilia can’t see it in the dark of the night, “I don’t—”</p><p>“Have a good night, Rio.”</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>Rio can’t even meet her eyes as she slips back in, and when she sees Lilia leave, locks the door and sets the alarm from the inside.</p><p>She looks at the flat door for a second, fist raised, about to knock and thinks she might have made a big mistake leaving this up to chance—Agatha probably won’t be able to hear her knock from down here. She tries it anyway, not one to be put off quite that quickly. The door nudges open when her fist connects and Rio forces a smile back so Agatha doesn’t think she’s too happy to see her. She heads up the stairs and knocks on that door.</p><p>She only has to wait a second before the door opens, like Agatha has been waiting for her. God, she’d <em> love </em>to make fun of her for it, doesn’t want to push her luck though.</p><p>All thoughts go out the window however, when she sees Agatha, hair messy and free, dressed in a large t-shirt, ending on her thighs, and as far as she can see, nothing else.</p><p>“Any room at the inn?” Rio says because she’s stupid, and having her eyes exposed to <em> that </em>much of Agatha’s legs clearly isn’t good for her, “That’s something people say, right?”</p><p>Agatha is wonderful though, because even though her eyes are telling Rio she’s crazy, she humors her, “I don’t know if I’d class Mary, mother of the Lord, as one of <em> the people, </em>but maybe if you’re carrying the second coming of Christ, I’ll consider it.”</p><p>Rio pulls her mouth into an exaggerated awkward smile, “I have something to tell you,” She puts a hand to her belly, rubs it a little, “And he’s yours.”</p><p>Agatha barks out a laugh, “You severely lack understanding of our dynamic if you think I’m the one getting <em> you </em>pregnant.” She reaches out, grabs Rio’s wrist and pulls her inside, “Oh, that reminds me—”</p><p>“How did <em> that </em>remind you of anything?”</p><p>Agatha, still leading Rio through the flat, sends a wink over her shoulder and opens the door to the bedroom.</p><p>Agatha lets go of her and leaves Rio to look around as she starts rummaging through a chest of drawers.</p><p>The room is pretty bare from not having long moved out her aunt’s belongings, and Agatha doesn’t have a lot to fill it with. The bed she convinced Agatha to let her buy takes up a lot of the space, plain bedding covering it, a deep purple throw blanket over the top. Agatha’s stuffed rabbit is on top of her pillow.</p><p>When she looks at Agatha, she sees her holding a nondescript box. “For you.” She holds the box out for Rio to take.</p><p>She only has to open the lid for a brief second to know what it is.</p><p>“Agatha,” She can feel how hot her face is, has to close the lid again, “What—”</p><p>“It’s a strap on.”</p><p>Jesus Christ.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio coughs a little, “I can see that.”</p><p>“I wasn’t sure if you’d have one,” She licks her lips and closes in on Rio. “Don’t think I could convince you to bring it to work even if you did.”</p><p>Because Rio is an adult capable of having these conversations, she opens the box back up. Agatha pulls it out before she can work up the nerve to.</p><p>“Oh,” She says when she gets a proper look at it, “It’s uh—it’s big.”</p><p>Agatha hums, “It suits you.”</p><p>Rio takes in a shaky breath at that. No other words come to mind. She’s just standing, staring at the silicone cock Agatha has her fingers wrapped around.</p><p>“Is it okay?”</p><p>And Rio knows the question is ‘is it okay that I bought it?’ and not ‘do you like it?’ but the answer to both is ‘yes’ so she nods, not trusting her own voice.</p><p>“Have you used one before?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head.</p><p>“God, Rio. Who the hell have you been fucking?” She says, more to herself than to Rio, then asks, “Would you like to?”</p><p>Rio jerks her head up to finally look at Agatha, nods again.</p><p>And that’s when Agatha strikes—her voice lowers, her eyes lock in on Rio, she creeps in closer, hand brushing against Rio’s.</p><p>“Yeah? You gonna fill me up with your cock?”</p><p>Rio can’t take any more of <em> that </em>without getting her hands on Agatha. She throws the box onto the bed and pulls Agatha in to a kiss, hands frantically sliding up the hem of her t-shirt to cup Agatha’s ass and—fuck she’d been right, Agatha isn’t wearing anything besides that shirt. She palms Agatha’s ass, pulls her closer until their hips are pressed together.</p><p>“Take your clothes off.” Agatha says, a little breathlessly when she pulls back. She drops to the edge of the bed. Rio likes to think she’s just as worked up about this as she is.</p><p>Obediently, Rio strips under Agatha’s keen eye, and only when she pushes her underwear down does Agatha rip her t-shirt over her head. She beckons Rio over to her and reaches for the box to pull out the harness. She helps Rio into it and then secures the cock in the o-ring.</p><p>In a move Rio couldn’t have predicted, Agatha leans down and presses a chaste kiss to the tip of the cock—<em> her </em>cock, and she whines, letting her eyes slip shut.</p><p>“Baby—” Her voice is breathy.</p><p>“Hm, I was gonna give you a blowjob but I don’t want you to come too soon.”</p><p>Rio opens her eyes to see Agatha with a hand wrapped around her cock.</p><p>“Oh, shit.” She moans, hips jerking involuntarily.</p><p>Agatha laughs because she’s cruel, “Yeah, see that’s what I’m talking about, baby.”</p><p>Rio lowers herself to her knees, careful not to drop too heavy and hurt herself like she’s prone to doing. She’s gentle as she pushes Agatha’s legs apart, doesn’t need to try, she spreads them willingly.</p><p>Agatha knows what she wants, she doesn’t need to say it. A hand is pushed into her hair and she’s dragged to Agatha’s cunt.</p><p>She brings Agatha to a quick, dirty orgasm on her tongue—she’s not trying to drag this one out, before pushing inside her with two, then three fingers, wants to make sure she’s ready.</p><p>“Fuck, <em> fuck, </em>Rio, that’s it.” Agatha starts moving along with Rio, trying to get her fingers in deeper, and that’s when Rio knows she’s ready.</p><p>She reluctantly pulls her mouth from Agatha’s clit, feels her cunt pulse around her fingers in protest as she starts to slowly slide out of her.</p><p>“No, no, no, Rio, I’m close.”</p><p>Rio wipes her mouth on the back of her hand, leans down over Agatha to press her lips to her ear, “Thought you wanted my cock?”</p><p>The whine Agatha lets loose is needy and desperate and she claws for Rio’s body, “Yes, I need it, Rio please.”</p><p>God, Rio’s never heard her sound like that before. She pulls away and taps Agatha’s hip, “Move up a bit.”</p><p>Agatha, heavy-limbed, does as she asks. She startles after a second and reaches to snatch the bunny off of her pillow, putting him softly face down on the floor. It’s a little funny to watch, Rio didn't think Agatha would be the type to worry about the feelings of a stuffed animal.</p><p>She shakes herself out of the thought, needs to get back into the right headspace.</p><p>“Do you have lube?”</p><p>“Don’t need it.” Agatha snaps.</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Fucking hell,” Agatha drapes an arm over her face, “Top drawer.” She flails her other arm vaguely in the direction of the chest of drawers she grabbed the strap on from.</p><p>Rio retrieves it, pops the cap and pours a healthy amount into her palm, slicks up her cock with it. God, the visual even just of this is, yeah…</p><p>She returns to Agatha, drapes herself over her body, aware of how her cock presses between both their bellies. Agatha pulls her in for a kiss, “Please fuck me, Rio,” Her legs come up to wrap around Rio’s hips, “I want you inside me.”</p><p>Rio’s brain honestly feels a little fuzzy and she nods, reaching down to grip her cock, brings it to Agatha’s entrance a little clumsily—hesitates.</p><p>Agatha doesn't let her overthink it; she reaches down between them and wraps her own hand around Rio’s and guides her inside.</p><p>Rio watches how Agatha’s jaw drops open as she pushes further inside, taking care to go slow, slow so she doesn’t hurt Agatha as she makes these gasping moans.</p><p>Her hips meet Agatha’s at some point and she looks between them, sees how she’s all the way inside and lets out a moan of her own. She’s <em> inside </em>Agatha.</p><p>“Please, Rio, you can move, please, please—”</p><p>She’s cut off when Rio slides out, watching as she does it, fuck—<em> how </em> can she fit inside Agatha like that?</p><p>When she pushes back inside, Agatha wraps her arms around Rio’s neck and jogs her hips to meet Rio’s, “I can take it, I want you so bad.”</p><p>So Rio starts up a steady pace, pumping deep inside as Agatha whimpers into her neck. “Fuck, Agatha, you take me so well.” She chokes out.</p><p>“Yes, yes, <em> fuck </em> your cock feels so good inside me, Rio,” Agatha’s voice is filthy in her ear, “ <em> Such </em> a good boy—filling me up so well.”</p><p>Rio can’t help herself, they’re like her trigger words. Her hips speed up and Agatha begins to lose the ability to form complete sentences then, just repeating <em> yes </em> and <em> Rio </em>over and over.</p><p>When Rio shoves a hand between their bodies, fingers seeking out Agatha’s clit, it only takes a few messy circles before Agatha tenses, fingers tightening her grip on Rio as she comes. Rio swears she can <em> feel </em>it.</p><p>When she finally comes down, untucking her flushed face from Rio’s neck, Rio presses a kiss to her forehead.</p><p>She doesn’t know if it’s that they’re not rushing for the first time since they started having sex, but when she takes in Agatha’s face and how she’s subtly still grinding her hips against Rio, she realizes her orgasm has barely even taken the edge off.</p><p>Rio’s <em> so </em>glad they’re doing this in a bed, not having to rush. She pulls out, much to Agatha’s visible dismay though it quickly disappears when Rio grins, says, “Turn over.”</p><p>Agatha’s response is a moan when she realizes what Rio means. She rolls over onto her stomach and then pushes herself up onto her elbows, ass in the air.</p><p>Rio inhales shakily, watches how Agatha’s dripping cunt is on display for her like this, watches as it clenches, begging for her.</p><p>With a lot more confidence this time, Rio lines herself up to Agatha’s cunt and watches in real time as it stretches to accommodate her as she slowly pushes back inside. Her hands instinctively go to Agatha’s hips, gripping tight.</p><p>“You look so good like this.”</p><p>“Mmm, you like seeing your cock inside me?”</p><p>Rio bites her lip as she tries to keep a firm grip on the situation, wants to make this good for Agatha, like she clearly needs.</p><p>“Like seeing how you stretch around me.” She grits out when she gets her hips pressed against Agatha’s once more.</p><p>Agatha pushes her hips back firm into Rio, even though she’s as deep as she can get. Rio pulls all the way out, eyes flickering between Agatha’s cunt and her own wet cock. In a moment of headiness, Rio slams her hips back into Agatha’s with a lot more force than she’d intended, and instead of telling her to slow down, Agatha’s head drops to the bed, back arching further as she chokes out a broken moan.</p><p>“Oh God—<em> yes </em>, like that.”</p><p>Rio can feel her brain fizzing as she fucks into Agatha harder, and then, when Agatha asks for it—<em> begs </em>for it, fucks her faster, watches as her body melts into the bed.</p><p>Rio moves one of her hands to the small of Agatha’s back, stroking over it as she fucks her; and when she hears Agatha’s breathing get a little jagged, like she’s not taking in enough air, she leans over her back, moves that hand to Agatha’s stomach and holds her as she keeps her pace.</p><p>“You’re doing so good, baby.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands are fisting the sheets and her voice is muffled from where she has her face pressed into the mattress. Rio has no idea what she’s saying, only that she sounds desperate.</p><p>She leans over and strokes over Agatha’s hair as she tries to get her to turn her head, “Tell me again, sweetheart.”</p><p>The words have barely finished leaving her mouth when Agatha’s response comes back, wet and needy, “Come inside me. Come inside me, Rio, <em> please </em>, I wanna feel you, wanna feel you come—”</p><p>Fuck. <em> Nothing </em>could have prepared Rio for that and her hips falter slightly as she tries to process it. She can picture it, sees herself filling Agatha up fully and her vision goes foggy.</p><p>Feeling her slow down, Agatha sobs, sounds almost distressed, “Rio, baby, please, do it for me.”</p><p>Rio wrenches herself out of her thoughts at the sound, Agatha’s desperation breaking through to her; she wants—<em> needs </em>to give Agatha everything she wants. She slides the hand on Agatha’s belly down to her clit, stroking over it lightly as she picks up her pace again, sliding deep inside Agatha, and presses over her back so she knows Agatha will hear her.</p><p>“Gonna come so deep inside you,” Agatha’s relief is apparent and she sucks in heavy breaths, “Gonna fill you up, just how you deserve.”</p><p>A few more strokes over Agatha’s clit has her near screaming as she comes around Rio’s cock. She slows down as she fucks her through it, doesn’t want to overwhelm her.</p><p>When Agatha stops shuddering and her hands loosen their grip on the sheets, Rio stops her motions, stroking over Agatha’s stomach to soothe her.</p><p>“I’m gonna pull out.” She says, after a moment, waits for Agatha’s hum of affirmation and slowly pulls out, Agatha collapsing fully onto the bed when she’s empty.</p><p>Rio makes quick work of shucking the harness down her hips, letting it fall to the floor—she’ll deal with it later, and climbs onto the bed, careful not to jostle Agatha too much.</p><p>She lies on her side, propped on an elbow, and reaches out for Agatha, who shivers under her touch.</p><p>She lets her hand spread out over as much skin as she can and pulls gently to get Agatha to roll off of her face. Agatha goes without much fuss, letting Rio spoon her, Agatha’s head resting on the arm Rio fits under her.</p><p>They lie in silence for a bit until Rio feels the patch of skin on her arm where Agatha has her head grow a little damp, hears how Agatha tries to hold back soft sobs.</p><p>“Hey,” She presses a kiss to Agatha’s shoulder, “Are you—” She starts, “Was it—” She cuts herself off again, “I didn’t hurt you, did I?”</p><p>Agatha’s sob becomes a wet laugh and she rubs her eyes dry on Rio’s arm, not bothering to hide it now she’s been caught.</p><p>“No, Rio, it was… you were so good,” She stays facing away from Rio, “I just, it was a little overwhelming—emotionally,” Her voice quietens on the last word like she’s self-conscious about it, “But it was good, you were perfect,” She bites Rio’s arm a little as if trying to distract her from the warmth of her words, “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio kisses Agatha’s shoulder again, letting her lips linger, mumbles against her skin, “Thank <em> you. </em> I… I never knew it could be like that.” She understands why Agatha kept her back to her now; it feels weirdly vulnerable to say out loud.</p><p>She doesn’t get a reply right away, feels around with her feet for the throw blanket and pulls it up to cover them with.</p><p>“I’m glad it was me.” Agatha says, eventually, words coated in sleep. Rio feels herself drifting off as well, lets it happen.</p><p>(Rio has to borrow one of Agatha’s shirts the next morning, light blue, soft and flowy.</p><p>If anyone notices, they don’t say.)</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>In the days that follow, Agatha says things that have her brain back-firing.</p><p>This wouldn’t usually be a problem for Rio, who’s been learning how to deal with Agatha’s outrageous flirting since day one, with only minimal damage to her psyche.</p><p>But this… this is different.</p><p>Because half the things Agatha says, she doesn’t even seem to be aware of. She’s not sending silly over the top winks Rio’s way when she says them, not biting her lip, nothing.</p><p>(Rio walks into the kitchen to find Agatha banging her head against the fridge. She watches—it goes on for longer than she thought it would, side eyes Alice, concerned.</p><p>“Delivery company forgot to put pasta on the truck,” Alice whispers, eyes also on Agatha. She’s still bashing her head. “Either that or Agatha forgot to order any and doesn’t want to take the blame, anything’s possible.”</p><p>For fuck’s sake. She kinda gets it now, almost wants to bash her <em> own </em>head against the nearest wall.</p><p>“Pasta is like half our menu.”</p><p>Agatha hears her, stops her banging and pulls away with a groan. When she turns round there’s a red spot on her forehead.</p><p>“Oh, is it?” She says, her words <em> drip </em> with sarcasm as she stalks toward Rio, hands exaggerating her every word, “Alert the press! This is <em> brand new </em>information.”</p><p>After a moment, she drops her hands to her sides, has the decency to look a little ashamed at how she snapped at Rio.</p><p>Rio watches her, tongue pushed into her cheek as she refrains from retaliating, “This is fixable.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha snaps her fingers, then points at Alice, “You go buy the pasta.”</p><p>“From <em> where? </em>Nowhere’s gonna have enough to fully stock us.”</p><p>“Which is why you’ll have to <em> drive </em>to the big boy shop to buy it.”</p><p>“Ooh, uh—” Alice is suddenly <em> super </em>interested in the ceiling, “If you mean CityMart I’m like 90 percent sure I’m banned from there.”</p><p>“What the fuck? For wha—nevermind, we’ll come back to this,” She pivots and points to Billy, who’s only just walked through the door, “Teen, you’re up!”</p><p>“We need a shit ton of pasta from the city.” Alice fills him in.</p><p>“You mean—no, no, no. The nearest big shop is… no, I can’t go.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re banned too?” Rio’s sort of concerned about the sort of people she unwillingly has employed.</p><p>“No! It’s just—”</p><p>“Oh for God’s sake, is this some gay thing?”</p><p>“Agatha, that’s offens—”</p><p>“Quiet, Teen. <em> You </em> have a crush on that kid that works there, uh, Eddie or Teddy, or something equally <em> gay </em>.”</p><p>Billy’s face is flushed, “Why don’t <em> you </em>go?”</p><p>“I don’t have a car.” Agatha says, like it’s obvious, and maybe it is because she works most days through the week and lives upstairs. She clicks her tongue on the roof of her mouth, “You’re up, babe. I’ll pay you back. Maybe.” And walks away, like that was totally normal.</p><p>Like Rio’s brain isn’t ringing out, <em> babe, babe, babe. </em></p><p>There’s a beat of silence.</p><p>“True or fal—”</p><p>Rio doesn’t give Billy the chance to finish, “No, absolutely not.”)</p><p>And then there’s the <em> other </em> half—when she says something like that, and <em> does </em>notice.</p><p>(Rio’s in the kitchen grabbing a ramekin of ketchup for a kid who spilled his all down his dinosaur t-shirt. A true travesty, in Rio’s personal opinion.</p><p>She rolls her eyes when she looks the bottle over in search of its product label, doesn’t see one.</p><p>She lets out a noise of frustration, “Agatha, can you please date the ketchup?”</p><p>Agatha groans and leans across Rio to grab one of the labels, swiping Rio’s pen from her breast pocket, uncapping it with her teeth. “I’d rather date <em> you </em> ,” She mumbles around the pen lid, then freezes and glows <em> bright </em>red. “Uh, I mean. Not that I wanna, um, date you or anything. It was just a silly joke—you know?”</p><p>She gets through all that without so much as glancing in Rio’s direction.</p><p>“Sure,” Rio says, keeps her voice extra casual, “Silly joke.”)</p><p>And this doesn’t even account for Agatha’s reactions to Rio’s conversations with other people.</p><p>(“Did you ever want kids?”</p><p>Rio’s instinctive answer is <em> no </em>, but she’s struck with the sudden realization that she’s never considered it.</p><p>Unbidden, an image forms—her coming home to excited squealing after a long day at work, cooking a meal for her family, not for work, not out of necessity, but out of <em> love </em> and the want to provide for her family the way she knows how. A <em> family. </em>She could have a family again. She sees herself kissing her child’s forehead before they go to sleep, padding back downstairs to sit with her… her…</p><p>She pictures Agatha, the mother of her child, belly rounded with their sec—</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio blinks heavily out of her daydream, willing her cheeks not to heat up.</p><p>Agatha, terribly timed, drops a cast iron pan on her foot, and she's not a clumsy person at all, so it <em> must </em>be related to the question.</p><p><em> Fuck </em> , now she has to worry about <em> Agatha </em>reading her mind. Between Wanda’s question and Agatha’s reaction—both of them she now suspects of having mind-reading abilities—she looks at her own hands in case she gives herself away.</p><p>“I’ve never really thought about it.”</p><p>She has a feeling it’s <em> all </em>she’ll be thinking about for days.)</p><p>So yeah, it’s getting harder and harder to just brush these instances under the rug but Rio’s not about to put her heart on the line for someone who genuinely might not want her back. What they have is enough.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>In what might be Rio’s biggest mistake to date, she agrees to close down the kitchen early one Friday night and give in to Lilia’s pestering.</p><p>Yes, Sage &amp; Scythe is holding its first psychic night.</p><p>Honestly, it’s not as bad as Rio had imagined; Lilia’s set herself up on a table in a far corner of the restaurant to have a little privacy, while Vision takes over bar duties. Most of the staff have stayed in support—not that it’s totally necessary, the people of Westview clearly put a lot more stock in clairvoyance than Rio had given them credit for—and are treating it mainly as an excuse to sit, drink and talk about anything other than work.</p><p>They’ve pulled tables together and are squashed in close to one another, one of Rio’s legs pressed up against one of Agatha’s, and Wanda only has to <em> look </em>at her husband before a whole new round of drinks is brought over.</p><p>Rio has to cover her mouth to hide a smile when she sees Agatha, leaning further into the table to cover herself, push her beer bottle in Billy’s direction while Wanda is distracted.</p><p>And because it’s Agatha and she can’t be seen doing anything nice without receiving some sort of payment, she loudly says, once she has her bottle back in hand, “<em> So, </em>Billy. That kid you were too scared to speak to came in the other day, asking for you. Did you take him round the back of the restaurant for some privacy, like I suggested, or did you chicken out?”</p><p>From across the other side of the table, Wanda stops mid-conversation with Alice, her question of, “Billy, you have a boyfriend?” Goes unanswered as Billy buries his head in his hands and Tommy does some weird frat-boy-esque whooping in the background.</p><p>“Oh no, sorry. Let me rephrase,” Agatha looks positively giddy as she speaks, “You kissed him up against the wall outside the restaurant the other day. True or false?”</p><p>Billy makes some unintelligible noises from where he’s pressed his face into the table, some of them sounding like Agatha’s name.</p><p>“Oh, it’s okay, you don’t have to tell me,” She reaches across and puts a hand on his arm, “It’s all captured on those fancy new security cameras Rio got fitted. Let me know if you want a copy, alright?”</p><p>Wanda’s staring at them, slack-jawed from across the table, and Rio can see Tommy rapidly relaying all this through laughs to Vision, who looks like someone’s paused him mid-cocktail shake.</p><p>“Make it stop.” Billy groans, the first comprehensible words.</p><p>“Oh honey, this is great,” Wanda gets up to give him a hug from behind, “You’ll have to invite him over so we can meet him.”</p><p>Agatha sits back, destruction suitably caused and winks at Rio, who melts ridiculously at this show of confidence.</p><p>“Rio, can you fire her?” Billy whines at her.</p><p>“Good luck with that.” Alice scoffs from the opposite end of the table as Jen leans into her, shushing her through giggles.</p><p>Which—okay, maybe this whole thing between Agatha and herself is less discreet than she thought. She’s just gonna ignore that in the hopes it goes away.</p><p>“Wait, wait, wait, I just remembered,” Jen says, sitting fully up and leaning in, “Was this the kid who had like, four nervous cups of coffee and stared at the kitchen door the whole time? I thought he was planning to dine and dash, I was like, staring at him trying to psych him out. I feel kind of bad now.”</p><p>“See this wouldn’t be an issue if you fitted them all with tracking devices, like I’ve been saying.”</p><p>“Agatha, what the fuck?”</p><p>“Oh God, we needed that with you,” Jen points at Agatha and laughs, the alcohol doing wonders for their arguing tonight. She looks at Rio, “This one dined and dashed like five times when we met her, I don’t know why Estella never banned her. We only caught her the last time because she was <em> literally </em>eight months pregnant.”</p><p>Wait. What? Rio looks at Agatha, expecting her to laugh, <em> something, </em> but she doesn’t. She doesn’t even <em> look </em> at Rio, <em> can’t </em>look at Rio.</p><p>The table falls into a kind of silent shock, but Jen doesn’t seem to notice, caught up in telling her story, “I don’t know how quick of an escape you thought you were making, you were waddling everywhere, it was very noticeable.”</p><p>When she’s finished, Jen must notice no one laughing along with her and sobers quickly, realizes what she’s done.</p><p>“Wait, Agatha, I didn’t—shit, Agatha—”</p><p>Agatha’s staring at Jen and Rio can see her working her jaw like she’s grinding her teeth. Whatever she’s thinking doesn’t come out though and she bolts from the table, heads for the exit.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to,” Jen starts, “I’m just, I forgot you didn’t know.” She says to Rio, who shakes her head. She can’t hear this from Jen.</p><p>“It’s, um,” Rio swallows, “I need to find her.”</p><p>She doesn’t have to look far; Agatha is a little down the street, heaving into Westview Books’ flower display. She straightens up when she hears Rio coming and wipes her mouth on her sleeve. The tear tracks on her cheeks glisten under a streetlamp.</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>“Don’t,” She still doesn’t look at Rio, “Please just go back inside, Rio.”</p><p>“Agatha, I can’t—I can’t leave you like this.”</p><p>“Rio, please. I can’t talk about him right now.”</p><p>“We don’t have to talk.” Rio takes a step toward Agatha, breathing a sigh of relief when Agatha doesn’t distance them again, “We don’t have to do anything you don’t want.”</p><p>“I want,” Agatha’s voice is shaky so she swallows and restarts, “I want to go to bed.” She casts a glance down the street to look at the restaurant. There’s no way to get to the flat upstairs without going through the restaurant.</p><p>“Okay, it’s okay. Just let me—just wait there for me, okay?”</p><p>She doesn’t wait for Agatha’s reply as she speeds back to the restaurant, gathers up her jacket and bag, then throws her keys at Wanda, “Lock up for me, okay?”</p><p>Agatha hasn’t moved from where she left her. Rio throws her jacket around Agatha’s shoulders and reaches out with a tentative hand to take Agatha’s into her own and she nods when Rio asks if she’ll come home with her.</p><p>The walk doesn’t take long and she leads Agatha straight upstairs, pushing some long-sleeved pajamas and an unused toothbrush into her hands. Rio gets herself changed and waits on the end of her bed, biting the skin on her thumb until it’s red and raw.</p><p>Agatha comes quietly out of the bathroom and, without a word, lies down on her back on top of the bed. Rio follows suit so that they’re side by side, feels Agatha’s fingers tangle with her own.</p><p>Rio doesn’t want to be the first to speak, has no idea what to say, so she waits for Agatha. She’ll wait as long as Agatha needs.</p><p>“Señor Scratchy.” Is what Agatha eventually says.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“The rabbit. His name’s Señor Scratchy.” She tilts her head to the side and meets Rio’s eyes for the first time since she bolted out the restaurant, “Nicholas is my son. Was my son. Your aunt bought him the rabbit.”</p><p>Rio thinks back to the rabbit. Thinks of the embroidery on its foot, thinks of it wrapped up in Agatha’s quilt, and on top of her pillow. A soft, plush toy for her son.</p><p>“Oh.” She says, regrets it instantly. She’d once wanted to know everything about this labyrinth of a woman, but now was face to face with something she hadn’t prepared for and found she had no idea how to approach this.</p><p>“You can ask.” Agatha says, and Rio’s heart doesn’t know how to hold all this trust.</p><p>“I don’t know if I know the right questions.” Rio says, quiet, and watches Agatha’s eyes flutter shut, fuck, she doesn’t want her to retreat. Before she loses her chance, Rio asks, “What was he like?”</p><p>Agatha takes a moment, but before Rio can consider that she’s maybe asked the wrong thing, Agatha rolls onto her side, facing Rio; Rio follows. “I don’t know,” She says, “He died.”</p><p>It feels too heavy to ask something else after that. Rio sits with it and Agatha ends up speaking before she can ask anything else.</p><p>“He came out silently and I knew straight away,” She sniffles, rubs her nose against one of the pillows, “I knew because he’d always been so annoying when I was growing him,” She says with a little laugh, “He, um, he kicked a lot, and he had a lot of opinions on my music taste. He should have come into the world the same way but…”</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Rio brushes a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, holds her hand there on her face, “You must’ve been so young.”</p><p>“Mm, yeah—twenty.” Her eyes go a little glassy like they do when she’s really thinking, “My mother, she was—well she was cruel. She never liked me, not even as a child. The whole lesbian thing just made it worse. And I just, I was <em> so </em>upset the last time I saw her and I don’t know why but I was still dying for her approval and—” Agatha sucks in a sharp breath, “Well, I’m guessing you can put the pieces together.</p><p>“I wasn’t going to keep him. Not at first. But then I think somewhere, some part of me knew I could do it, could be a good mother because I knew how it was to have a bad one. I guess it didn’t matter.”</p><p>“It does matter. I think you’d be an amazing mom.”</p><p>Agatha has a curious look on her face. Maybe she’s never been told that before. She brushes her nose against Rio’s and slowly leans in to kiss her. They stay pressed together like that for some time, slowly kissing, just for the sake of it, not for it to lead anywhere.</p><p>When they part, they lie in comfortable silence, foreheads pressed together, breathing in sync. Rio can feel herself drifting off, thinks Agatha might be too until, “I would have told you. I just… we have a good thing going and I didn’t want to turn this into something it isn’t with all this heavy baggage and <em> feelings </em>.”</p><p>Rio’s heart thumps in her chest; she thinks maybe it’s rising slowly up her throat, “I think maybe… it’s okay for us to have some feelings. You know, if we both have the same ones.”</p><p>Agatha squints, “Just… so we’re on the same page here. You know I’m not talking about my son anymore, right?”</p><p>“Yes, or I, uh, hoped you weren’t anyway.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha says, traces Rio’s lips with her thumb, “Tell me.”</p><p>Oh God, it’s right there—her heart, on the tip of her tongue.</p><p>“I like you, Agatha. I really like you. I never expected you, and I don’t like surprises. But I like you.”</p><p>The words have barely left her mouth before Agatha presses her lips to Rio’s once more, a noise of contentment in her throat.</p><p>“Say it back.” Rio says against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Agatha laughs through her nose, “Rio, that was <em> so </em>gay.”</p><p>“Hey, say it back, asshole.”</p><p>“Hm,” Agatha says like she’s thinking about it, “I like you a lot.”</p><p>Rio can’t help herself, “So when you got all flustered the other day with the ketchup… you <em> actually </em>wanna date me?”</p><p>Agatha puts a hand over her mouth and rolls on top of her, keeping her hand in place through her laughter, “Shut up.”</p><p>They fall asleep not dissimilar to that position, Agatha on top of Rio like a weighted blanket, breathing heavy into her neck.</p><p>Early next morning, while Agatha is still asleep, Rio phones the restaurant number and gets through to Wanda, who must be going in to start her prep shift. She apologizes, tells Wanda to tell Jen not to worry, tells her that they’re both okay but that they won’t be coming into work today.</p><p>They have time, and the restaurant won’t fall down without them.</p><p> </p>
