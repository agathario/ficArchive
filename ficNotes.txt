Yeah, I love cupcakes.  

April snatches the phone out of his hand, say "Ellis hates you, and he has herpes", and tosses the phone in the trash. 

"Hey, what's your problem?" 

My problem is you, Smellis.  Ben told you to finish the website,  and if you don't do it, I swear to God,  I'm gonna m*rder you in your sleep. 

"I know where you live. 14th street, right?"  She starts to whisper menacingly, "I'm gonna get a melon baller and scoop your eyes out and eat them, and your congressman uncle is gonna have to buy you a dog to drag your eyeless face around.  Do you understand me?"  

Yes.  

kisses his nose
slaps him

Do it.

Jen Barkley didn’t eavesdrop. Not intentionally, anyway. She just happened to be walking by the break room in the campaign office when she heard Ellis’s high-pitched, slightly panicked voice. It wasn’t unusual; Ellis had a tendency to sound like that under pressure. But what made her pause was the sudden, commanding interruption that followed.

“Give me the phone,” April Ludgate demanded, her voice low and cutting. There was the muffled sound of resistance, but it was brief. Then April again, with the kind of tone that could slice through steel, “No, you listen to me. If you think you can call here and whine about something that doesn’t matter to anyone but your fragile ego, you’re sadly mistaken. Do you know what we’re doing here? Trying to win a campaign. Not babysit your feelings.”

Jen leaned against the wall just out of sight, her eyebrows shooting up in amusement. 

April’s voice dropped further, like the growl of a panther circling its prey. “If you ever call back to waste our time again, I will personally make sure you never get another moment of anyone’s attention. Got it?”

There was a pause. Then, a clipped “Good.” A sharp click as the call disconnected. 

“Wow,” Ellis muttered, half in awe and half in terror. “That was… effective.”

“You’re welcome,” April deadpanned. Jen could almost hear the smirk in her voice. 

Jen leaned against the doorway, her lips curving into a sly smile. 

“Ellis,” she called, breezing into the room with her signature confidence. He jumped like a startled rabbit. “Why don’t you… go do literally anything else?”

Ellis bolted, leaving Jen and April alone. April leaned casually against the counter, twirling the office’s ancient landline phone cord around her finger. Her dark eyes flicked to Jen, unreadable as always. 

“That was impressive,” Jen said, her lips curving into a sly smile. “Remind me never to get on your bad side.”

“Too late,” April replied flatly, but there was a faint glint of mischief in her expression. 

Jen chuckled, stepping closer. “Seriously, though. You have a talent for… evisceration. I like that in a person.”

April shrugged. “I’m just here to keep Ellis from ruining everything. If that involves scaring some losers over the phone, that’s a bonus.”

Jen found herself watching April more closely than usual. There was something captivating about the way she carried herself—that effortless blend of apathy and intensity. It was rare to see someone so young with such a finely honed instinct for power. 

And, okay, maybe Jen had always appreciated April’s particular brand of deadpan humor and unflinching honesty. But this was different. This felt… distracting.

“Well, whatever you’re doing, keep it up,” Jen said, forcing her mind back to the present. “We need all the firepower we can get.”

April tilted her head, studying Jen for a moment. “You’re weirdly nice today. What’s your angle?”

Jen laughed, a little louder than she intended. “What, I can’t just compliment my staff?”

April’s lips quirked into a small, skeptical smile. “Sure. Whatever helps you sleep at night.” She pushed off the counter and brushed past Jen on her way out of the room. “Try not to scare Ellis too much. He’s fragile.”

Jen turned to watch her go, feeling an unfamiliar warmth unfurling in her chest. She shook her head, trying to dismiss it. This was ridiculous. She was Jen Barkley, for crying out loud. She didn’t get distracted by brooding twenty-somethings with a penchant for sarcasm.

But as she returned to her office, Jen couldn’t shake the image of April standing there, utterly fearless and undeniably magnetic. Maybe, just maybe, she’d underestimated how much April Ludgate could get under her skin.

---

Over the next few weeks, circumstances forced Jen and April to work more closely together. April’s blunt efficiency paired surprisingly well with Jen’s high-energy, sharp-tongued approach to the campaign. They quickly developed an unspoken rhythm: April would cut through the noise with her no-nonsense attitude, and Jen would finesse the details to keep things moving smoothly.

One late evening, as the office buzzed with the frenzy of an approaching deadline, April and Jen found themselves alone in the conference room, sorting through a pile of campaign materials. Jen, usually the master of small talk, found herself unusually quiet, stealing glances at April as she methodically sorted papers.

“You’re staring,” April said without looking up, her voice tinged with amusement.

Jen blinked, caught off guard. “I am not.”

April finally looked up, one eyebrow raised. “Sure you’re not. What’s your deal?”

Jen leaned back in her chair, attempting nonchalance. “Just trying to figure out how someone so young can be so… competent. It’s unsettling.”

April smirked. “Maybe I’m just better at this than you are.”

Jen laughed, the sound lighter than she expected. “Maybe you are. Guess I’ll have to keep you around and find out.”

April’s smirk softened into something almost genuine. She returned to her task, but Jen noticed the faintest hint of color rising in her cheeks.

---

The turning point came one night when April lingered after everyone else had gone home. Jen was still in her office, catching up on emails, when she heard a soft knock at the door.

“Busy?” April asked, leaning against the doorframe.

“Always,” Jen replied, gesturing for her to come in. “What’s up?”

April hesitated for a moment before stepping inside and closing the door behind her. “I… just wanted to say thanks. For not being a complete tool, I mean. You’re not as awful as I thought you’d be.”

Jen grinned, leaning back in her chair. “High praise coming from you. Should I be flattered?”

April rolled her eyes but didn’t leave. Instead, she sat down across from Jen, fidgeting slightly. “It’s weird working with someone who actually gets stuff done. Usually, people just screw everything up and make it my problem.”

“Well, I aim to please,” Jen said, her tone light but her gaze steady. “And for the record, you’re not as terrifying as you pretend to be. You’re actually kind of… inspiring.”

April’s eyes widened slightly, and for once, she seemed at a loss for words. The silence stretched between them, charged and heavy, until April finally spoke.

“You’re not so bad yourself,” she muttered, her voice barely above a whisper.

Jen’s smile softened. “Careful, Ludgate. If you keep being nice to me, I might start to think you like me.”

April looked up then, her dark eyes meeting Jen’s. “Maybe I do,” she said, the words hanging in the air like a challenge.

For once, Jen was speechless. And for the first time in a long time, she didn’t mind.

I’ll continue with the evening escalating further, exploring their gravitation toward each other as the night unfolds. Let me know if you have any particular direction you'd like it to take! Here's the next part:  

---

As the man disappeared into the crowd, Jen felt the warmth of April’s hand still at her waist. She couldn’t help but smile, her usual sharp wit momentarily dulled by something softer. “You know, if I didn’t know better, I’d think you were actually enjoying yourself tonight.”

April snorted, finally letting her arm drop, though she stayed close. “Don’t push it. This place is a nightmare.”

Jen’s eyes sparkled. “And yet, here you are. Is it the free booze? Or the company?”

April shrugged, taking a sip of her drink. “Maybe I just like seeing you squirm.”

“Oh, please.” Jen smirked, stepping slightly closer. “I don’t squirm. I thrive.”

April tilted her head, her lips curving into a small, amused smile. “If you say so.”

The air between them grew heavier, the noise of the fundraiser fading to a dull hum. Jen wasn’t used to this—feeling genuinely intrigued, almost off-balance. She thrived on control, on being three steps ahead of everyone else in the room. But with April, it felt like she was constantly trying to catch up, and for once, she didn’t mind.

“Dance with me,” Jen said suddenly, her voice low and inviting.

April blinked, caught off guard. “What?”

“Dance with me,” Jen repeated, holding out her hand. “Or are you too cool for that?”

April hesitated, glancing around the room. “This is a terrible idea.”

“Probably,” Jen agreed, her grin widening. “But since when has that stopped you?”

After a moment, April sighed, setting her drink down. “Fine. But if you step on my toes, I’m leaving.”

“Deal.”

Jen led April to the edge of the dance floor, where couples swayed to the soft strains of a jazz band. It was the kind of scene Jen usually found tedious, but tonight, it felt different. She rested a hand lightly on April’s waist, the other clasping hers. April’s touch was hesitant at first, but as they found their rhythm, she relaxed, her usual sharp edges softening.

“You’re not terrible at this,” April muttered, her gaze fixed just over Jen’s shoulder.

“High praise,” Jen teased, her tone light, though her heartbeat felt louder than the music.

They moved together in silence, the tension between them crackling like static electricity. Jen couldn’t remember the last time she’d felt this… alive. She studied April’s face, the way her guarded expression had given way to something almost tender.

“You’re staring,” April said, her voice quieter now, more vulnerable.

“Can you blame me?” Jen replied softly, her usual bravado tempered by something deeper. “You’re kind of incredible.”

April’s eyes flicked to hers, wide and uncertain. For a moment, neither of them spoke, the weight of unspoken feelings hanging between them. Then, as the song ended, Jen felt April’s hand tighten slightly on hers.

“Come on,” April said abruptly, pulling Jen off the dance floor. “Let’s get out of here.”

Jen followed without hesitation, her pulse racing. Wherever this was headed, she wasn’t about to let it slip away.

Would you like me to continue with what happens next, or adjust the tone or pace?

After the man disappeared into the crowd, Jen and April stood there, the air between them heavy with something unspoken. April’s arm lingered around Jen’s waist a beat too long before she finally pulled away, shoving her hands into the pockets of her dress. 

“Guess I saved you,” April muttered, looking anywhere but at Jen.

Jen tilted her head, studying April with a mixture of curiosity and amusement. “You know, most people would say ‘thank you’ and leave it at that.”

“I’m not most people,” April shot back, though her voice lacked its usual bite.

“No, you’re not,” Jen agreed, her voice softer now, almost thoughtful. She glanced around the room, noting the cluster of politicians and donors still engrossed in their conversations. None of them seemed to notice the magnetic pull keeping her rooted here, beside April.

April shifted on her feet, clearly uncomfortable under Jen’s gaze. “What?”

“Nothing,” Jen said, though the smile tugging at her lips suggested otherwise. “Just trying to figure you out.”

“Good luck with that,” April said, crossing her arms. But even as she spoke, her defenses seemed to falter, her posture softening just slightly.

Jen chuckled, the sound low and warm. “You know, for someone who claims to hate these kinds of events, you’re pretty good at navigating them. Even if your methods are... unconventional.”

“Someone’s gotta keep you from getting hit on by idiots,” April muttered, a faint blush creeping up her neck.

“And I appreciate it,” Jen replied, stepping closer. “Really. Though I have to admit, your timing was suspiciously perfect. Jealous, maybe?”

April’s eyes narrowed, though the faint flush in her cheeks deepened. “You wish.”

Jen’s smile widened, her usual sharpness tempered by something softer. “Maybe I do.”

The words hung between them, heavy and electric. For a moment, neither of them moved, the noise of the fundraiser fading into the background. Then, almost imperceptibly, April took a small step closer, her gaze flickering to Jen’s lips before darting away.

“We should probably…” April began, her voice trailing off.

“Yeah,” Jen said, though neither of them made any move to leave.

The moment stretched, the tension between them crackling like static. It would have been so easy for Jen to close the distance, to lean in and finally give in to the pull that had been building between them for weeks. But she hesitated, her usual confidence tempered by the unfamiliar weight of what this might mean.

Before either of them could speak again, a sharp burst of laughter from a nearby group shattered the moment. April stepped back, her mask of indifference snapping back into place.

“Right. Back to the grind,” April said, her tone forced and flat. She turned and started to walk away, but Jen reached out, her hand brushing against April’s arm.

“Wait,” Jen said, her voice soft but firm.

April paused, looking over her shoulder. For a moment, her dark eyes betrayed a flicker of something vulnerable, something hopeful. But then she blinked, and it was gone.

“See you around, Barkley,” April said before slipping into the crowd, leaving Jen standing there, her heart pounding and her mind racing.

For once in her life, Jen Barkley didn’t have a plan. But as she watched April disappear into the sea of people, she realized she didn’t need one. Not for this.

Would you like to dive into their thoughts after the moment, or fast-forward to the next major development in their relationship?
----
---

Jen sat in her office later that night, nursing a glass of wine and replaying the moment on the dance floor over and over in her mind. It wasn’t the almost-kiss itself that had her rattled—she was no stranger to close calls or electrifying moments. It was the way April had looked at her, as though Jen was something worth seeing, something more than the polished, calculating campaign manager everyone else saw.  

She swirled the wine in her glass, her thoughts unraveling in a way she wasn’t used to. She was Jen Barkley, for God’s sake. She didn’t get stuck on moments or people. And yet, every time she closed her eyes, she saw April’s guarded smile, the softness in her dark eyes that she rarely let anyone glimpse.  

April was magnetic in a way that wasn’t loud or obvious—it was quieter, sharper, like a blade hidden in shadow. Jen hadn’t seen it coming, and now she wasn’t sure how to unsee it.  

She sighed, setting her glass down and leaning back in her chair. For once, she didn’t have a plan. And it scared her just as much as it thrilled her.  

---

April lay on her bed, staring at the ceiling, her fingers absently twisting a loose thread on her sleeve. She hadn’t meant for the night to end the way it did, hadn’t planned on stepping in or saying those words—“She’s taken.” But the moment she’d seen that guy leaning too close to Jen, laughing too loud at nothing, something inside her snapped.  

She could still feel the warmth of Jen’s waist under her hand, the way Jen had looked at her afterward, half amused and half… something else. Something April couldn’t quite name but that sent her heart racing in a way that was both infuriating and exhilarating.  

What was wrong with her? She didn’t do this—didn’t care enough to get jealous, didn’t swoop in like some ridiculous knight in shining armor. But with Jen, it was different. Jen got under her skin in a way no one else ever had, and it was driving her crazy.  

April groaned, throwing an arm over her eyes. She’d been so careful, keeping her distance, pretending this was just another job. But now… now she wasn’t so sure.  

Because as much as she wanted to blame the moment on the free booze or the charged atmosphere of the fundraiser, deep down, she knew the truth.  

She didn’t want Jen to look at anyone else the way she sometimes looked at April.  

And that terrified her more than anything.

Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into their reflections or shift focus to their next interaction!
-------

The next morning, the campaign office buzzed with its usual chaos, phones ringing off the hook, staffers darting between desks, and the hum of printers filling the air. Jen arrived late, coffee in hand and sunglasses perched atop her head, looking every bit the unbothered professional.  

April was already at her desk, typing something with her usual mix of efficiency and disdain. She didn’t glance up when Jen walked by, but Jen didn’t miss the way her typing faltered for a split second.  

“Morning, sunshine,” Jen called breezily as she set her coffee down at her desk.  

April muttered something unintelligible in response, her gaze fixed firmly on her computer screen.  

Jen smirked and sauntered over, leaning against the edge of April’s desk. “Riveting conversation, as always. Didn’t anyone ever tell you it’s polite to greet your boss in the morning?”  

“You’re not my boss,” April shot back, finally looking up. Her dark eyes were as guarded as ever, but there was a flicker of something else—something that made Jen’s heart skip in a way she wasn’t ready to examine.  

“Technically, I am. I’m running this campaign,” Jen said, crossing her arms.  

“Technically, I could quit anytime,” April countered, though there was no real heat in her voice.  

Jen chuckled, straightening up. “Touché. But you won’t, because you’re good at this. And you like working with me.”  

April rolled her eyes but didn’t argue.  

Jen took a step back, her usual air of confidence faltering for just a moment. “About last night…”  

April stiffened, her fingers pausing over the keyboard. “What about it?”  

Jen hesitated, a rare occurrence for her. She wasn’t used to uncertainty, but the memory of April’s arm around her waist and the unspoken tension between them made her pause. “Thanks for stepping in. That guy was…”  

“A tool,” April finished, smirking. “You’re welcome.”  

Jen smiled, a little more warmly than she intended. “Well, if I ever need a fake girlfriend again, I know who to call.”  

April snorted, the sound unexpectedly endearing. “Don’t push your luck.”  

As Jen walked back to her desk, she felt April’s gaze linger for just a moment longer than usual. And for the first time in a long time, Jen Barkley wondered if she’d finally found someone who could match her step for step.  

---

Would you like the story to build slowly from here or have their next interaction push them closer to that tipping point?    
=======

The next day, the usual chaos of the campaign office felt strangely muted. The clatter of keyboards and the hum of phones blended into white noise as Jen arrived, her sunglasses perched on her head and her usual air of effortless control firmly in place. But beneath her polished exterior, her thoughts were anything but composed.  

April was already at her desk, her dark hair pulled into a loose bun, fingers flying over her keyboard. She didn’t look up as Jen passed, but Jen caught the faintest hesitation in her typing.  

“Morning, sunshine,” Jen called out as she set her coffee down at her desk.  

April responded with a barely audible grunt, her gaze fixed on her monitor.  

Jen smirked. So, they were playing it cool. Fine. Two could play that game.  

The morning dragged on, each meeting and phone call blurring together. But every so often, Jen found herself glancing toward April, who seemed determined to avoid her gaze.  

By lunch, Jen decided enough was enough. She sauntered over to April’s desk, leaning against it with the kind of casual confidence that could only come from years of mastering the art of confrontation.  

“Ludgate,” she said, her voice low enough that no one else could hear. “Do we need to talk about last night?”  

April finally looked up, her expression carefully neutral. “What about it?”  

“Oh, I don’t know,” Jen said, waving a hand airily. “Maybe the part where you swooped in like some kind of brooding knight and scared off that guy. Or the part where you pretended to be my girlfriend.”  

April’s lips twitched, but she quickly schooled her features back into indifference. “I was just doing you a favor. You looked like you wanted to punch him.”  

Jen laughed, the sound a little sharper than usual. “Fair enough. But let’s not pretend it was just about him.”  

April’s eyes narrowed slightly, and for a moment, the mask slipped. “What are you getting at?”  

Jen leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a near-whisper. “I’m saying that maybe we’re both pretending a little too hard.”  

The tension crackled between them, and for a moment, Jen thought April might actually admit something, anything. But then April leaned back in her chair, her smirk firmly back in place.  

“Pretending’s kind of my thing,” she said lightly. “But nice try.”  

Jen straightened, brushing invisible lint off her blazer. “Alright, Ludgate. We’ll play it your way. For now.”  

She walked back to her desk, feeling April’s gaze follow her. This was far from over.  

---

That evening, as the office emptied out and the hum of fluorescent lights replaced the chatter of the day, April found herself lingering. She told herself it was just to finish up some loose ends, but deep down, she knew better.  

Jen was still in her office, the glow of her desk lamp casting long shadows as she typed away. April hesitated by the doorway, her stomach twisting with an unfamiliar nervousness.  

“Got a minute?” she asked, her voice breaking the quiet.  

Jen glanced up, her expression unreadable. “For you? Always.”  

April stepped inside, closing the door behind her. “I just… wanted to say thanks. For not making a big deal about last night.”  

Jen leaned back in her chair, studying April with that piercing gaze that always seemed to see right through her. “Oh, it was a big deal, alright. Just not in the way you’re thinking.”  

April’s breath hitched, but she quickly masked it with a scoff. “You’re impossible, you know that?”  

“And yet, you’re still here,” Jen said, a slow smile spreading across her face.  

April didn’t respond, her mind racing with every reason why this was a bad idea. But as Jen stood and crossed the room, stopping just a few feet away, those reasons felt less and less convincing.  

“We don’t have to pretend anymore, April,” Jen said softly, her usual bravado replaced with something raw and real.  

April looked up at her, and for once, she didn’t have a sarcastic retort. Instead, she took a shaky breath and let herself meet Jen halfway.  

“Maybe I don’t want to,” she admitted, the words barely audible but carrying the weight of something undeniable.  

Jen’s smile softened, and for the first time, they stood on equal ground, the distance between them shrinking with every passing second.  

Neither of them knew what came next, but for now, the unspoken understanding between them was enough.
