<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha gently shook her head, giving up. “She’ll be here in an hour. But you have to promise me to behave yourself.”</p>
<p>“What do you think I’ll do?”</p>
<p>“Hit her?” Agatha almost grinned, “Mark your territory and intimidate her?”</p>
<p>“It’s my wife and kid we’re talking about–”</p>
<p>“Ex.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, a certain pain lingering behind the aqua. “Ex wife, Rio. I’m your ex wife, you're my ex wife.”</p>
<p>“I said that.”</p>
<p>“No,” She blew out a tired breath. “You didn’t.”</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Agathario have been divorced for 3yrs and Rio has never fully accepted it, until Agatha gets serious about someone else. Rio has to move and acknowledge that they're out of time and the best days are behind them...or does she?</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>They met in 2007 at a bar after Rio had just gotten off an absolutely hellish shift at the hospital. She had walked in for the cheap drinks, being a resident meant she never had <i>any</i> money. Her student loan debt alone was enough to make her question why she decided to become a doctor. Rio smoothed out her black muscle tank and jeans as she found a stool at the bar. It was a random Tuesday night, the patrons few and far between. She ordered her usual, a god awful $4 beer, and alternated between sipping and anxiously peeling at the label.</p><p>“Surgeon?” A raspy voice asked, the scent of iris and amber enveloping her senses.</p><p>Rio whipped around, taking in the owner of the voice. A woman, probably not much younger than Rio. Wild waves cascading down to her stomach, sly quirk of full lips, eyes that resembled aquamarine with pale green right around the pupil. Her nose alone had Rio smiling back. The woman was holding a drink, low rise jeans showing off a sliver of lower stomach where her green baby tee ended.</p><p>“Uh-” Rio cleared her throat, “Yeah. How’d you know?”</p><p>The other woman climbed onto the stool next to her. “Other than the fact that this is the closest bar to Mass Gen, your hands.”</p><p>“My hands?”</p><p>“Your fingers, specifically.”</p><p>“You were staring at my fingers?”</p><p>“Well,” She tilted her head, blush coating her cheeks, aquamarine glinting with mischief. “If it makes you feel better I was also staring at your ass.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek, grinning. “I’m sitting down.”</p><p>“So you should be flattered by my effort.”</p><p><i>Okay, she’s a spitfire</i>, Rio thought. “What about my fingers?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“What about my fingers made you decide I was a surgeon.”</p><p>She tutted her tongue against her teeth, sliding her free hand across the lacquered wood of the bar, her index finger barely brushing against the back of Rio’s hand.</p><p>“The way they moved.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Slow. Methodical. Attentive.”</p><p>“It’s a sticker off a beer bottle.”</p><p>“And yet every piece has been taken off in precise, uniform detail.” She pointed to the pieces of damp paper on the bar, all the same shape and size to a fault. “So it was either surgeon or serial killer.”</p><p>“I could be both.”</p><p>“Doubt it.”</p><p>“”Why’s that?”</p><p>“Your eyes are too kind.” She quipped, finger now idly tracing the back of Rio’s hand. “My guess is something with kids, right? You seem like the type of nerd to give them a dino toy when they’ve been brave.”</p><p>Rio blinked a few times, bewildered, because that’s <i>exactly</i> the type of nerd she was. “Do you work at the hospital?” Though she would kick herself if she had been in proximity to this gorgeous and interesting of a woman and never noticed.</p><p>The fucking siren in front of her snorted and Rio considered it one of the most beautiful sounds to ever grace her eardrums. “No, god no. I’m a teacher.”</p><p>“So you’re also the type of nerd that works with kids?”</p><p>“Technically, but I teach high school English.” Her smile only got wider. “I only come here to troll for hot, rich doctors.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Then you picked the wrong one. I’m poor, embarrassingly so.”</p><p>“Who said I picked you?”</p><p>“So you just watched my hands and my ass for no reason?”</p><p>“Well you’re not loaded, so yeah, apparently.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “You’re quick.”</p><p>“No, I’m Agatha.” She let her finger drop to Rio’s wrist right over her pulse point. “And your name?”</p><p>“Why do you wanna know it?”</p><p>“It’s usually courtesy to have someone’s legal name before screaming it in bed,” She fully turned her body towards Rio’s. “But I can always just shout out random ones if you’d prefer. Like Dani or JJ,” She studied Rio for a bit longer, half guessing and half joking. “Ana?”</p><p>Rio’s face flushed, her chest felt warm. “You hit on all your women by calling them what I am assuming are your ex’s names?”</p><p>“Only the ones who make me work for it.” She raised a single eyebrow in a challenge.</p><p>“You don’t even know if I’m into women.”</p><p>“You’re looking awfully nervous for a straight girl.” Her stare raked over Rio’s body, studying her. “The tattoos on your arm and the Docs don’t help your case either.”</p><p>Rio had a sleeve on her arm, mostly vines with flowers woven throughout. It was Boston so most hospitals didn’t care if their doctors were tatted, and on the rare occasion where she had to cover them, she just wore a long sleeve under her scrub top or her white coat on top.</p><p>Yeah, also a reason she never had any fucking money.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She swiveled her stool, her body now facing Agatha. “Rio.”</p><p>“De Janeiro…?”</p><p>“No, my name. It’s Rio.”</p><p>“Mmmmh.” She contently hummed, gaze locking in on hers. “Dr. Rio.”</p><p>“Dr. Vidal.” Rio corrected, “Pediatrics.”</p><p>“Knew it.” Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes. “Nerd.”</p><p>The confidence, the razzing, the way this woman carried herself–</p><p>Angels don’t exist, signs from the universe are lies people tell themselves, there is no magic number that someone can wish on and get everything they've ever wanted. Rio knew that, but looking at those two pools of pale blue, she almost wished she didn’t.</p><p>“Mrs. Agatha.” Rio shot back, grinning and taking a sip of her beer.</p><p>“<i>Miss</i> Harkness.” She emphasized the part of her name that let Rio know she wasn’t married. “But let’s not distract ourselves with formalities.”</p><p>“Oh? What should we distract ourselves with?”</p><p>Agatha suddenly stood, leaning down to whisper into her ear. “With the fact that I’m going to go to the bathroom, and maybe I forget to lock the door.”</p><p>She looked up at her, at the woman who looked like she was going to eat Rio whole, and gave a dazed nod. She watched as Agatha walked away, the sway of her hips, the swell of her ass in those fucking jeans.</p><p>A beat later, Rio got up, walking down the compact hallway and reaching the door to one of two bathrooms. Both single stall, both with lockable doors. It’s like they were asking people to fuck in them, that’s how Rio reasoned it anyway.</p><p>June 2nd, 2007, Rio met her wife. She didn’t realize it at the time, she didn’t get Agatha’s info after shoving those very methodical fingers into her jeans while the other woman moaned as she sat atop the sink. No, it wasn’t until a few weeks later, when Rio went back to that bar after another long shift, that Agatha waltzed in a few minutes after.</p><p>Lucky four leaf clovers and wish-granting shooting stars are made up ideas sold by con men, but Rio could live with that if it meant fate brought them both back to that shabby hole in the wall bar at the same time, on the same night. And yes, Rio got her number that time, taking her out on their first date the following week.</p><p>They got married on June 2nd, 2010.</p><p>They bought their home in 2011.</p><p>They had their daughter in 2012.</p><p>Yeah, the universe did not work in mysterious ways, Rio knew that as a medical professional. Nobody’s life is saved by a higher power, it’s saved by science and professional training.</p><p>However, she could overlook that for her wife and daughter, for the milestones. For the memories of a pregnant and miserable Agatha choosing a color scheme for the nursery and Rio building all the furniture. Their daughter being born happy and healthy at the same hospital Rio was now an attending at, the smiles and the tears as they held Nicky for the first time. Rio falling asleep with Nicky on her chest during late night feedings and diaper changes. Agatha helping her toddle over the hardwood floors of their townhome near downtown and take her first steps. Rio helping her to learn how to ride a bike with the residual ice and sleet of a late Boston spring. The birthdays, the anniversaries, the promotions and good grades.</p><p>Rio let herself believe in fate for that part of her life, foolishly apparently.</p><p>They finalized their divorce in 2022.</p><p>She remembers signing the paperwork, the ink spilling out the tip of the pen and ending her marriage in a broad stroke. Fifteen years together, twelve married, thirteen where they were happy, and one kid. And a dotted line just undid it all.</p><p>Agatha kept the townhouse, Rio got a nice loft near the hospital. They split custody of their daughter, who hated them and the back and forth, and Rio really couldn’t fault her for it. They alternated weeks and holidays, they were cordial enough. On the outside looking in, they were amicable. And even if it did kill Rio on the inside, Agatha told her they were done, so she respected her wishes.</p><p>They never truly felt over, even in the three years since the divorce, Rio still wore her wedding ring. She’d gone out on a few dates, but nothing compared in her mind, nobody ever would. And it made her feel pathetic, because while Rio pined from a distance, her ex wife (which she despised that ‘ex’ part of ‘wife’ with every fiber of her being) dated and went out and lived her life.</p><p>There had been a few steady girlfriends, all of which Rio wanted to violently murder but didn’t out of respect for Agatha and their child. The inbetween, the post-break up eras is where Rio thrived. 	Where she’d drop Nicky off at her former home and be able to look at Agatha and just <i>know</i> she’d get a call the second their daughter left to hangout with friends or for her tutoring gig. Where Rio would come over and pin her ex wife to the nearest wall, ruminate in the familiar taste of Agatha’s lips, cherish the feeling of Agatha’s soft skin beneath her hand, fucking memorize the sounds Agatha made as she came around Rio’s fingers or tongue or strap.</p><p>Fifteen years hadn’t been long enough, she needed more and Rio would take it however she could get it. Even if it meant only being a warm body for the meantime, even if it meant leaving at Agatha’s word so Nicky wouldn’t catch them and get confused.</p><p>And Rio understood, she didn’t blame Agatha for ending things, not after everything that happened. Things she couldn’t take back. She hoped that time would heal the wound, the one they both shared, the child they lost. But it didn’t, so Rio focused on the child they did have, she focused on her career despite the part it played in ending her marriage. She worked more and more hours when they were separated, before the custody arrangement had been finalized. Rio basically lived in that on-call room more than any other doctor in that fucking hospital.</p><p>Now, three years had passed since Rio signed that stupid fucking dotted line, and she was worse off. She had friends, though they were also Agatha’s, lesbians and their tight knit friends were a curse. She had hobbies, she had her garden, she had her daughter two weeks a month. But she didn’t have her wife– dammit, ex wife. Three years and she still made that mistake, still felt wrong when another woman hit on her, still recoiled at being touched in a way that only Agatha had done for fifteen years.</p><p>Her and Agatha were off currently, she hadn’t gotten a booty call in well over six months. Some ginger chick that Agatha had been seeing, according to Nicky the woman was nice enough, kind of pretty. Rio wanted to ply her daughter for more information but knew it’d get back to her ex if she did, so she left it alone and waited for Agatha to call.</p><p>Because she always did.</p><p>No matter how long it had been, or who she had just been with, Rio always came back when Agatha needed her. And not to pat herself on the shoulder, but Rio was pretty confident no other woman could fuck her wife like she could. Their sex life had vanished in their last couple years of marriage, but once those papers were filed, something clicked back again. Which, thank god because she had missed throwing her wife around like a rag doll and eating her out until her legs involuntarily shook. It wasn’t exactly the same as before. The sex was more detached and Agatha never let Rio see or feel her abdomen. She’d always wear some sort of shirt that’d never leave her body because she didn’t want Rio to look at or touch the angry scar on her lower stomach. Which Rio lived with. She had learned to live with a lot. So, Agatha could have her fun, because Rio never truly worried that another could take her ex.</p><p>Until their daughter’s 13th birthday party, held at that same fucking towhome. It was Saturday in early September, she came bearing cake as was her responsibility according to her ex. She still had a key so she let herself in, baggy blue jeans sitting low on her waist, a tight heather gray tank adorning her torso. Her hair was pulled back into a messy bun, having chopped it last month because at forty-five years old, she didn’t want to fucking deal with it anymore. And if her tattoos were on full display and she had forgone a bra, who would notice?</p><p>Agatha, hopefully.</p><p>She made her way through the house, Agatha had redecorated a few things over the years, but ultimately it was mainly the same. She made idle chitchat with their shared acquaintances before grabbing a beer and heading out to the deck, her daughter bounding up to her.</p><p>“Mami!”</p><p>Rio opened her arms as their bodies collided, smiling against the crown of her daughter’s head. “Hey, teddy.”</p><p>“I missed you.” Nicky spoke, squeezing Rio tight, face pressed into her shoulder.</p><p>Rio pulled back, looking down fractionally because Nicky had shot up over the summer like a fucking weed. “I missed you too, but you saw me Sunday.”</p><p>Monday to Sunday was their routine, tomorrow night Rio would pick Nicky up and take her back to the loft. Not perfect but it was the best they could do with what they had done to their life.</p><p>“Mom’s looking for you.”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Rio didn’t ask why, her eyes fell to her daughter’s neck, her fingers plucking the dainty gold chain and accompanying stone. “¿Qué es esto?”</p><p>Nicky didn’t wear dainty, overly feminine jewelry. Wherever this came from, it didn’t scream her daughter’s vibe. Nicky still wore Rio’s old Paramore shirts, the one from their Riot or Brand New Eyes era, claiming they were “vintage”. Which yes, made Rio feel ancient. Nicky wore ripped jeans and thrifted band tees, not preppy princess bullshit. Not that it would be a bad thing if she did, they’d support Nicky no matter how she dressed. But Rio had to admit, her daughter was stupid fucking cool. It looked to be real gold with a sapphire pendent, Nicky’s birthstone. Her and Agatha had a general rule of not buying their kid expensive gifts since Rio heavily out earned her ex financially.</p><p>“Wanda me lo dio.” Nicky scoffed, rolling her huge brown doe eyes.</p><p>“Wanda?” She scrunched her face, “Who the fuck is–”</p><p>“Rio!” Alice’s voice called from where her and the rest of the gang sat in the backyard. “How the hell are you here? Thought you were in surgery?”</p><p>“And miss my daughter’s birthday? No fucking way.” Rio shouted across the way, a few guests turning their heads.</p><p>“Language, please.” Lilia, who for all intents and purposes was Agatha’s mom, scolded. “My grandchild is thirteen, not twenty.”</p><p>“I know the word ‘fuck’, nona.” Nicky called over to the table before looking back at Rio. “I think it quite a lot around <i>that woman</i>.”</p><p>“Nicola Camila Vidal...” Lilia warned.</p><p>Rio scrunched her face. “What woman?”</p><p>“Wanda!”</p><p>“Who is Wanda?!”</p><p>Her ex wife’s voice bellowed from behind her. “My girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio whipped around, and Agatha looked beautiful, she always did. She was carrying the cake, fingers bare of a wedding ring unlike Rio’s. She stood with an annoyed expression on her face, a simple blue sun dress on her frame. And yes, they were celebrating their daughter’s birthday, and yes, they were divorced. But if she still had Agatha, if she still had her perfect life, Rio’s head would currently be under that dress.</p><p>Instead of dropping to her knees on the deck that she fucking built herself in front of their friends, Rio swallowed and quirked her eyebrow. “Since when?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes the same way she did in that bar eighteen years ago. “Help me with the cake.” She hissed before turning around and heading back into the house and into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio followed, knowing damn well her ex did not need help with the cake, closing the sliding glass door behind her. The kitchen was empty as Agatha stood at the island, very aggressively sticking candles into the cake.</p><p>“I told you <i>months ago</i> I was dating someone.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, approaching the opposite side of the island. “I didn't think it was serious enough that she was giving my daughter presents.”</p><p>“You think I would bring a complete stranger around Nicky?”</p><p>“I just–” Rio sighed, setting her beer down on the counter. “I figured it’d fizzle out, it always does.”</p><p>Agatha peered up from her task like she was attempting to murder Rio with just a glare. “Thanks.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean it like that.” She explained, “I meant that neither of us has had a serious partner since…everything.”</p><p>“Well, I do.”</p><p>“So where is she?” Rio waved her arms around, challenging a non-existent woman. “I don’t see Big Red anywhere.”</p><p>Rio could only insult the woman so much with the very little info she had on her.</p><p>“Not here yet, we went out to dinner with Nicky last night because I don’t trust you to meet her.”</p><p>“Why’s that?”</p><p>“Because,” Agatha gripped onto the side of the counter, shoulders tensing. “I know that you’d probably try to scare her off.”</p><p>“That’s not true.”</p><p>It was.</p><p>“Rio, you don’t date. You don’t go out. You work and take care of Nicky.”</p><p>“How do you know that?”</p><p>“Our daughter isn’t stupid, she knows you’re lonely.” Agatha tilted her head. “And I didn’t think it’d be good for her if I rubbed salt in your wound. Maturity and all that bullshit.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t lonely, she was perfectly content beside the constant ache in her chest for her old life back.</p><p>“How long has this been going on?”</p><p>“Nicky’s worrying or Wanda?”</p><p>“Wanda. Nicky doesn’t need to worry about me, I’m fine.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look convinced at that last part, but she answered anyway. “Nine months, almost ten?”</p><p>“Nine?” Rio cocked her head, “No, because it was a few days after Valentine’s day when you called me and we–”</p><p>“I know.” She interrupted, not wanting to rehash the night they spent fucking a few days after Valentine’s of all holidays. “We weren’t exclusive then.”</p><p>“That’s so funny,” Rio smirked, deciding to pick at the issue until it was raw. “‘Cause I distinctly remember you saying something along the lines of me being the best you’ve ever had while you were sitting on my face. And come to find out, you had another woman on the side.”</p><p>“She wasn’t on the side!” Agatha snapped. “You were! It was a moment of weakness that, believe me, will not happen again.”</p><p>Her gut twisted at being the other woman to Agatha, the placeholder.</p><p>“Oh, I’ve heard that one before.” She bitterly chuckled. “What makes this time so different?”</p><p>“It’s serious, it’s- it’s more.” Agatha looked directly into her eyes as she verbally slit Rio's throat. “We talk about marriage, about the future.”</p><p>Goal achieved because Rio’s windpipe constricted, her wife never failing to say the exact right thing to break Rio down into pieces that she’d promptly stomp on. “Marriage?”</p><p>“Yup.” Agatha sighed.</p><p>“You’d get remarried?”</p><p>“Maybe.” She shrugged noncommittally. “If she asked.”</p><p>“Then I want to meet her.”</p><p>“Rio–”</p><p>“You’re telling me this woman could be another parent to my kid and I don’t deserve to meet her?!” Rio nearly shouted, and though it appeared as rage, it was nothing more than anguish.</p><p>Agatha gently shook her head, giving up. “She’ll be here in an hour. But you have to promise me to behave yourself.”</p><p>“What do you think I’ll do?”</p><p>“Hit her?” Agatha almost grinned, “Mark your territory and intimidate her?”</p><p>“It’s my wife and kid we’re talking about–”</p><p>“Ex.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, a certain pain lingering behind the aqua. “Ex wife, Rio. I’m your ex wife, you're my ex wife.”</p><p>“I said that.”</p><p>“No,” She blew out a tired breath. “You didn’t.”</p><p>“Does Wanda know we had sex while you two were together?”</p><p>“No, and she doesn’t need to.” Agatha picked up a lighter, setting the wicks of the candles aflame. “Last thing I need is her thinking you still have a shot with me.”</p><p>Her eyes went glassy, quickly blinking back the tears. “Right.”</p><p>“Let’s just focus on Nicky today, hm? Soon she’ll be a full fledged teenager who hates and resents us.”</p><p>“She already resents us.”</p><p>“Builds character.” Agatha huffed, picking up the cake again and making her way back to the door. “Can you open the door?”</p><p>Rio walked over, body next to Agatha’s as she undid the latch of the handle. “The track needs some WD-40, it’s sticking.”</p><p>“I’ll buy some.”</p><p>Rio tugged, the door barely moving. “I can bring some over when I pick up Nicky tomorrow.” She angled her body, stepping into Agatha’s personal space as her ex lifted the cake out of Rio’s way. “It’s just–”</p><p>“Sticking, I know.”</p><p>Rio looked up from the handle and was unaware until that current moment just <i>how</i> close they were. Her face a breath away from Agatha’s. “I can, um, I can fix it…tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha’s pupils dilated and Rio could hear her swallow before speaking. “So you’ve said.”</p><p>The door was glass, so everyone outside could currently see them, but it wasn’t like they were doing anything inappropriate. It’s not like Rio was leaning in further and Agatha was letting her, or that the amount of eye contact being shared was completely unnecessary…</p><p>No, of course not.</p><p>Rio half-heartedly pulled again, barely using any strength as her gaze stayed on her wife. “I think we’re trapped.”</p><p>“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Agatha smirked.</p><p>“I–”</p><p>A set of footsteps entered the room, a casual voice following. “What’s going on here?”</p><p>They both whipped their heads over, Agatha taking a few steps back. “Wanda.”</p><p>The woman wasn’t kind of pretty like Nicky said, she was gorgeous.</p><p>And the complete opposite of Rio.</p><p>Where Rio opted for masculine clothing, hard lines and dark colors, Wanda went the other way. She stood in the foyer with her red hair down and curled, not an eyelash out of fucking place. She had on a pair of jeans that looked to be vintage, white linen blouse and heeled boots to finish the ensemble. Rio buffered as she stared at the woman, suddenly the pretty princess bullshit Nicky was currently wearing made sense.</p><p>Wanda smiled, setting her designer handbag down on the counter as she walked over to them.</p><p>“I- I thought you weren’t coming until later.” Agatha stumbled over her words.</p><p>“My meeting got done early, thought I’d surprise you and the birthday girl.”</p><p>Yeah, her daughter had mentioned Wanda was some marketing executive or something. That made Rio seethe because Wanda couldn’t have been more than thirty-five, and here she was, wildly successful.</p><p>“Hon, this is Rio.” Agatha tilted her head towards Rio, “My ex.”</p><p>Wanda extended her hand, long acrylics perfectly manicured, her tone cheery. “I’ve heard so much about you from Nic, it’s good to finally cross paths.”</p><p>
<i>Nic?</i>
</p><p>Oh, this fucking bitch.</p><p>Rio kept her grip on the handle, giving a disingenuous smile. “You too, kinda have my hands full.”</p><p>“Do you want me to try?” Wanda offered.</p><p>As if Rio would let her, using the rage she had currently bubbling inside her body, Rio yanked the damn thing again with all her strength. Finally, it budged, sliding down the track.</p><p>Rio bit back a snide laugh, giving them both one last glance before heading back out onto the deck.</p><p>“I got it. Thanks.”</p><p>Motherfucking ginger cockblock.</p>

<p>The rest of Nicky’s party went fine. They sang Happy Birthday and had cake, Nicky opened presents, Rio kept her mouth shut. Agatha really only cared that Nicky had a good time, so long as her child was happy. The party wrapped up, leaving Wanda, Nicky, Rio, Lilia, and herself.</p><p>Agatha began cleaning up, Rio and Wanda helping and actively avoiding one another at all costs. Nicky was with Lilia in the kitchen starting dinner, her daughter’s one request was to have her nona cook her famous Busiate alla Trapanese. Agatha wasn’t much of a cook, never had been. She had a few dishes she could do well and rotated them often, Rio was the chef between the two of them and her daughter never let her forget that fact. Especially when they had first separated and Nicky would complain about how much she missed her mami’s cooking.</p><p>So Agatha obviously agreed to a family dinner when Nicky had asked, except–</p><p>“Can mami stay for dinner?” Nicky asked as she stood next to Lilia by the stove, weaponizing those damn puppydog eyes she got from Rio.</p><p>“Teddy, I don’t know if she can stay–” Agatha said, tossing paper plates into the trash.</p><p>“I can stay.” Rio spoke, coming in from the deck with a garbage bag full of wrapping paper.</p><p>“There might not be enough food,” Agatha flitted her eyes over to her mom, screaming silently for help. “Right, ma?”</p><p>Lilia looked at her, knowing exactly what she was trying to do and smiling. “I’m Sicilian, of course there's enough food.” She then looked at Agatha’s ex. “I don’t see you nearly as much as I’d like to anymore, stay.”</p><p>Her ex grinned victoriously. “You’re too kind, Lilia.”</p><p>“Okay, I think that’s all the streamers.” Wanda announced as she stepped inside, hands full of colorful paper. “No sea turtles choking on my watch.”</p><p>“I wish <i>you</i> would.” Nicky muttered under her breath, causing Lilia to lightly elbow her.</p><p>“Nicola.” Lilia whispered in a warning.</p><p>“What?” She shrugged, stirring whatever her nona had told her to.</p><p>“Um, Rio’s going to stay for dinner.” Agatha looked at her girlfriend, who was trying and failing so miserably to fit in.</p><p>Wanda discarded the streamers, giving a diplomatic smile. “Great.”</p><p>Rio seemed to be annoyed at the very thought of Wanda breathing, looking at Agatha. “You got any wine?”</p><p>Oh right, alcohol!</p><p>Invented for situations just like this one.</p><p>“Yes, thank fucking god.” Agatha mumbled, bolting to the fridge and grabbing a bottle. “How many glasses?”</p><p>Yeah, every adult in the room agreed to wine.</p><p>No surprise there.</p><p>Lilia and Nicky finished cooking while Agatha, Wanda, and Rio all retired to the dining room. Wanda set her glass on the table and sat down, Agatha placing down her own reaching for the chair next to her girlfriend. As she did so, a hand shot out, pulling out the chair for her. Agatha paused, licking her lower lip as she looked at Rio who simply just stood waiting.</p><p>“Old habits.” Rio chirped.</p><p>Yeah, Rio always did shit like that. Held the door open, used her own jacket as a makeshift umbrella for Agatha whenever it rained, pulled out the chair for her at the table. Yes, Agatha had married a gentleman once upon a time, and Rio would never let her fucking forget it.</p><p>Agatha glared, but sat down as Rio pushed in the chair for her. “Thanks.”</p><p>Rio took the chair opposite Agatha, gingerly sipping her drink, copper eyes flitting between the two. “So how’d you guys meet?”</p><p>Wanda perked up. “Oh, uh at a bar actually. New Year’s eve.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against the side of her cheek, a mannerism that their daughter inherited. “No way, us too.” She waved her finger between herself and Agatha.</p><p>“Yeah,” Wanda nodded, “She just saw me and went for it. Very brazenly, I might add.”</p><p>“Ahhh,” Her ex agreed, “She’s brazen, this one.”</p><p>And Agatha knew what Rio was doing, trying to get under her skin. Making polite conversation with her girlfriend who Agatha was aware Rio already despised. She knew her ex’s tones like the back of her fucking hand, and this one was the fakest in her repertoire.</p><p>“Anyway…” Agatha said, attempting to shift the conversation.</p><p>“Did she pull the bathroom move?” Rio raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“Fucks sake.” She hissed, staring daggers at her ex wife across the table. “Could you not?”</p><p>“Bathroom move?” Wanda echoed.</p><p>“Ya know, maybe she goes to the bathroom and ‘forgets’ to lock the door.” Rio explained, wine in one hand. Sure, she’d had one beer during the party, but Rio wasn’t a lightweight, she wasn’t drunk or even tipsy. She was just being a dick. “I lost track of  the amount of times she did that while we were married. It’s a miracle we’re not banned from most public places in Boston.”</p><p>“Um, no…?” Wanda responded, she turned her head to Agatha in confusion. “Am I missing something?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio widened her eyes dramatically. “You’re missing <i>a lot</i>.”</p><p>“That’s enough.” Agatha declared, “And not helpful.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need to know the details of how Agatha and Wanda came to be, or when they fucked, or how they fucked. It wasn’t her place, and Agatha would remind her of that every chance she got.</p><p>Sure, her and Wanda’s sex life wasn’t as great as her and Rio’s is–</p><p>Was.</p><p>But it didn’t mean it was bad, it was fine.</p><p>“Did you two spend Valentine’s together?” Rio continued, taking another sip.</p><p>Agatha felt her blood pressure skyrocket, the silent insinuation dangling between the three of them.</p><p>“Yeah,” Wanda said, “We went to Yvonne’s over on Winter Ave.”</p><p>“Swanky.” Rio nodded, “Good food?”</p><p>“Oh my god, it was delicious.” Wanda replied, trying to engage in a seemingly safe topic of conversation. “We were both stuffed afterwards.”</p><p>“Something tells me Agatha wasn’t….” Rio muttered against the rim of her glass.</p><p>“Hmm?” Wanda furrowed her brows, not having caught it.</p><p>But Agatha did.</p><p>“Rio, kitchen.” Agatha barked, standing up from the table. “Now.”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, beginning to get up. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>As soon as she was in close enough range, Agatha grabbed her by the wrist and yanked her out of the room. She completely bypassed the kitchen where her mom and daughter were, instead shoving her into the bathroom off the den.</p><p>She locked the door, whipping around to face her ex. “What the fuck is your problem?!”</p><p>Rio pointed at the lock. “Look at that, you remembered this time!”</p><p>“Can you just not be a total asshole for one evening?”</p><p>“I thought I was being nice.”</p><p>“You were antagonizing her.”</p><p>“Not my fault she’s too dumb to recognize that.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath before lashing out and strangling Rio, mostly because she knew her ex would fucking love it if she did.</p><p>“For our daughter’s sake, can you please just play nice?”</p><p>“Our daughter’s sake? Nicky doesn’t like her either!”</p><p>“And she never will if you keep trying to start a pissing contest!”</p><p>“Please, like ginger spice could compete…”</p><p>“See! Shit like that is not going to foster a good relationship between the two of them.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “Oh no.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha took a step closer. “We are over. I know that’s hard for you to comprehend but I am not a prize to be won or an object to be owned. We are both free to do whatever we want with whoever we want.”</p><p>“And you want <i>her?</i>”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Wanda was sweet, caring, and funny enough. She was intelligent enough that Agatha wouldn’t get bored, she had a good job, she put in effort with Nicky. On paper, Wanda was perfect. And most importantly, <i>not</i> Rio.</p><p>“Just answer me one thing, and I’ll drop it.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, far from convinced she would drop anything. “What?”</p><p>Rio licked her bottom lip before her lips curled up into a sinister smile. “When did you become a top?”</p><p>She reared her head back as though she had been punched square in the face. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“I saw her nails.”</p><p>“Plenty of queer women have long nails.”</p><p>“Yeah, but like, <i>all</i> of her nails were long…”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So, if my memory serves me correctly you’re a taker.” Rio pointed past her, referring to the woman currently waiting at the table. “And she sure as shit is not a giver.”</p><p>Yeah, because Agatha didn’t feel comfortable being that vulnerable with anyone but her ex. Despite the fact that she was hellbent on her and Rio never fucking again, Agatha knew she’d never have that trust with someone else. Because Rio took care of Agatha in a way that another person couldn’t. Some connection, some bond that no matter how hard she tried, never broke.</p><p>“Maybe you don’t know me as well anymore.”</p><p>Rio didn’t even blink, just chuckled. “Baby, we both know that’s a lie.”</p><p>She ignored her heart skipping a beat at the pet name, keeping her face neutral. This was so much easier when she could just get her way by batting her eyelashes or flashing her tits and making Rio’s brain go blank.</p><p>But that was no longer an option, so words it was.</p><p>“Just be civil, just for today. That’s all I’m asking.”</p><p>“I haven’t hit her, have I?”</p><p>“Yes, but it’s very clear you’d like to.”</p><p>“Sue me.”</p><p>“I did.” Agatha smiled knowingly. “Took half of everything you own.”</p><p>Not that it had been difficult. Throughout the entire process of their divorce, Rio had responded to every negotiation with “Give her whatever she wants.”</p><p>Not that Agatha wanted a lot, she didn’t marry Rio for her money or lack thereof when they first met. Hell, Agatha had even refused spousal support. The only money she actually received was monthly child support and that was because she made peanuts compared to her ex. The public education system, may god bless it, did not pay its teachers well. Barely enough to live, actually.</p><p>“You could’ve kept everything I own.” Rio said quietly. “Could’ve kept me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath constricted in her ribcage, acting as a ribbon caught on bone. “I didn’t act alone.”</p><p>Rio’s face fell at the accusation, because even if Agatha was the one to serve Rio the papers, there were two people at fault for the end of their marriage. Not that their daughter saw it that way, however. No, Nicky resolutely saw Agatha as the one who broke up the family and Rio as the victim. It’s why she worried so much, it’s why she hated Wanda, it’s why she had distanced herself from Agatha ever since the divorce. And yeah, it had crushed her to lose one child physically and another emotionally in the span of a couple of years. But she told Rio they were done, and her ex just…listened.</p><p>So now they stood in front of one another, in the bathroom of their once shared home, fighting. Fighting about Wanda and petty shit because this was their reality now. But Agatha wouldn’t go back, she couldn’t.</p><p>“I know.” Rio’s voice was gentle. “I know.”</p><p>“Then don’t blame me when you fucking know.” Agatha bit out, refusing to let tears well. “I get enough of that from my mom and our daughter.”</p><p>“Lilia?”</p><p>She definitely wasn’t fucking referring to Evanora.</p><p>“Please, do you think I ever heard the end of it with her?” She bit her trembling lip. “Everyone pities you and hates me. I don’t need you making this any harder than it already is.”</p><p>“Lilia and Nicky don’t hate you. They would never.”</p><p>“You know Nicky doesn’t even hug me anymore?” Agatha’s voice broke. “She doesn’t look at me the same way. You’re her hero and I’m the villain.”</p><p>When Nicky had just ran up to Rio today the minute she saw her? It cut. It fucking bruised. To see her daughter overcome with so much relief and joy at the sight of her ex, only to sigh and scoff around her. To know that she blamed Agatha for everything wrong in her life and see her as evil, when she had worked so fucking hard to ensure her daughter would see her as anything but. Especially after what her own mother put her through, especially after her own childhood.</p><p>“Agatha–” Rio’s eyes went soft with sympathy.</p><p>Wanda never looked at her like that, and she was so fucking grateful for it. It was easy with Wanda, no baggage or painful past. When Wanda looked at Agatha, she saw <i>Agatha.</i> When Rio looked at Agatha, Rio saw the past eighteen years. And though most of it had been fucking amazing, the bad parts just hurt too much.</p><p>She sniffled, uninterested in receiving Rio’s comfort. “So, please. Just be fucking cordial.”</p><p>Rio nodded, surrendering the fight. “Okay.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha breathed out, turning and opening the door. She hastily wiped her eyes, ignoring the pain in her chest. She stopped in the kitchen when Lilia announced dinner was ready, offering to carry one of the many dishes to the table.</p><p>Rio followed behind with plates and cutlery, Lilia and Nicky in tow with the last of the food. Once everyone was seated and the meal was laid out, the conversation flowed well enough. Lilia asked Nicky about summer camp, Rio and Agatha talked about work.</p><p>“Eighth grade good so far, teddy?” Rio grinned at their daughter who had opted to sit next to her.</p><p>“My English teacher is a moron, but besides that…”</p><p>“Well, that’s because we raised you to be pretentious about literature.” Agatha snorted. “Probably my fault.”</p><p>“Isn’t it always.” Nicky looked down at her plate, absently pushing the pasta around.</p><p>Having a teenage daughter was <i>so fun</i>.</p><p>“Mija.” Rio’s voice went serious, but not unkind. “Apologize.”</p><p>Her daughter rolled her eyes, briefly peeking up at Agatha. “Sorry, mom.”</p><p>“You can do better than that.” Rio spoke, “Like you mean it.”</p><p>Nicky fully looked up, eyes on Agatha. “I’m sorry for saying that, mom. It was disrespectful."</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha said, moving on for now. “What don’t you like about your English teacher?”</p><p>“The assigned reading is all men, and I know he was able to make it himself because it’s not dictated by the curriculum! He just chose all men!”</p><p>“Did you ask him about it?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Of course I did.”</p><p>“And what’d he say?” Rio prompted.</p><p>“That I can read whatever I’d like in my spare time, but as far as he’s concerned, the list isn’t changing.”</p><p>“Oh, so he is a prick.” Agatha set down her fork. “Great call on that one, teddy.”</p><p>“What’s teddy?” Her girlfriend’s voice broke through. Oh fuck, that’s right. Wanda was here. “You guys use it so often but I’m not actually sure what it means.”</p><p>Rio smiled, nostalgia washing over. “Uh, when Nicky was little, she was a clinger.”</p><p>Agatha’s own smile matched her ex’s. “She used to get so tired after running around that when you picked her up, she’d snuggle one of us immediately. Her chubby little hands would grab our hair and she’d tuck her face against our necks. She’d just burrow like–”</p><p>“A teddy bear.” Rio finished, eyes misting. “The name just stuck.”</p><p>“One time, she fell asleep while Rio was giving her a piggyback ride to the car.” Agatha lightly chuckled. “We kept bickering over where we had parked.”</p><p>“I thought it was row B, Agatha thought it was row F.” Rio supplied.</p><p>“Turns out, it was row D.” Nicky added, “And it was Disneyland, that was a big day for five year old me.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips at the memory of that vacation. “You looked so cute in your mouse ears meeting Captain Hook.”</p><p>“Captain Hook?” Wanda giggled. “Not Tinkerbell or Cinderella?”</p><p>“I don’t care much for bimbos.” Nicky snarked, mean-mugging Wanda. “Fictious or real.”</p><p>“Who the hell taught you the word bimbo?” Lilia gawked.</p><p>“Bigger issue, ma.” Agatha held up her hand to dismiss her mom. “Don’t say that to people, especially women, and especially not to Wanda.”</p><p>At that, Nicky groaned, standing from the table. “All I wanted was a <i>family</i> dinner!” She then pointed at Wanda. “She’s not family.” Nicky finished her outburst by fisting a hand around the chain of the necklace that Wanda had gifted her, and tugging. The chain broke free from her neck before she carelessly dropped it onto the table.</p><p>“Nicky–” Agatha stood.</p><p>“Mija–” Rio stood too.</p><p>“Don’t bother.” Their daughter huffed, turning on her heel. “I’m already going.”</p><p>The clunky boots Nicky always wore stomped off and up the stairs, the finale being the slamming of her bedroom door.</p><p>The silence following could've been sliced with a fucking machete, nobody saying a word. Rio’s copper locked onto Agatha, an understanding passing between the two of them. Agatha quickly ducked down to Wanda, “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“Should I go?” Wanda asked like she had done something wrong.</p><p>“No, we’ll handle it.”</p><p>“Be right back.” Rio started off towards the stairs.</p><p>Agatha gave Wanda a chaste kiss of reassurance, her ex’s eyes lingering on the interaction. She then began to follow Rio out of the dining room, her mom calling a quick “Good luck.” as they left.</p><p>They made their way down the hall, family photos still hung up on the walls. She noticed as Rio stopped for a moment at the door to what used to be their room. Now, Agatha slept in it alone. It was open and Rio usually never came up here, her curiosity getting the better of her.</p><p>Agatha had repainted the walls, switching the sage green for a darker hunter  green. The duvet, once earth toned botanicals, was now black and white pinestripes. The area rug and end tables had been swapped out too. Now, taking it in through Rio’s eyes, the room looked…colder? More impersonal. Like whoever used to sleep in this room died, the new occupant simply using it as a place to exist rather than live.</p><p>Which wasn’t far off, if Agatha were to be honest with herself.</p><p>“It’s…different.” Rio stated, taking a couple of steps into the space.</p><p>“Needed a change of pace.” Agatha spoke, waiting in the doorway.</p><p>Her ex’s jaw tensed, fighting back a comment or perhaps an emotion. “I get it.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio’s hands fell to the dresser, picking up a picture frame that sat on top. It was the three of them on Nicky’s 7th birthday, the last one before everything broke down. When things were good. Agatha came up next to her ex wife, peering down at the photo. If she really looked, she could see herself just starting to show. The slightest swell of her stomach as Nicky smiled over her cake, Rio lifting her up to help blow out the candles as Agatha watched on fondly.</p><p>“That was a good day.” Agatha said, “I think that’s the year we got her the Build-A-Bear you can write on and then wash.”</p><p>“She fucking loved that thing.” Her ex spoke, face contorting like it hurt to recall such an item. “That poor bear had so many Spanish cuss words on it.”</p><p>“You’re the one who taught her ‘perra’.”</p><p>“It’s a female dog!”</p><p>Agatha took the frame from Rio and set it back down. “One of the few photos we got with the whole family.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio shoved her hands in her pockets, uncomfortable at the explicit mention of their second child.</p><p>The child they never truly talked about.</p><p>“We should go check on Nicky.” She offered, pushing down the anger at her ex wife’s refusal to acknowledge their youngest kid. The kid that Agatha spent nine months making, the kid that didn’t get to take a breath or cry or even blink.</p><p>Agatha could unleash the fury she felt in that moment, or she could focus on the child that needed her. She left the room, hearing the soft steps of Rio following. Agatha stopped at Nicky’s door, closed of course. She lifted her hand and gently knocked. “Sweetheart?”</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Rio knocked then, her voice cutting in. “Mija?”</p><p>At the sound of her mami’s voice, Nicky opened the door. She had her backpack slung over her shoulder, headphones on her neck, and her laptop in hand.</p><p>“I wanna stay at mami’s tonight.”</p><p>Agatha blinked a few times in confusion. “What?”</p><p>“I wanna stay with mami.” Nicky repeated. “She was gonna pick me up tomorrow anyway.”</p><p>“That’s not the arrangement, hon.” Agatha said, tone close to guilty.</p><p>“If only there wasn’t one!” Their daughter snapped. “If you hadn’t kicked mami out then you wouldn’t have to worry about this.”</p><p>“Hey.” Rio interjected. “I know you’re upset and you’re not wrong for how you feel. But your mom hasn’t done anything wrong and you’re being hurtful.”</p><p>No matter how bad things got, they were a united front when it came to Nicky. Their daughter was not a bargaining chip or a way to get the upper hand, she was their kid who they loved. She was a person.</p><p>“She’s inviting her fucking girlfriend to family dinners and expecting me to act like everything's fine.” Nicky ranted. “It’s not fine. <i>We’re not fine</i>!”</p><p>“Language.” Rio said in a way that mimicked Lilia. “We use swear words casually, not to insult people.”</p><p>“Teddy–” Agatha started.</p><p>“Don’t.” Nicky replied, voice like venom. “I’m old enough to decide where I want to be, and right now, it’s not here.”</p><p>A bullet would have been easier to take.</p><p>Rio sighed, “Nicky…”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Agatha rasped, her throat feeling tight. “She can go with you. It’s okay.”</p><p>Her ex cocked her head. “Really?”</p><p>Keeping her here wasn’t going to help, she needed to rebel and Agatha would rather her do it safely. She’d always be safe with Rio. And after Evanora, Agatha wanted her daughter to feel as though she had autonomy over herself, that her voice was heard.</p><p>Agatha looked at her daughter. “You need time to cool off, I get it. This will not be a regular thing, but one night won’t be the end of the world.”</p><p>Nicky nodded, a microscopic smile etching her features. “Thank you.”</p><p>“But you are apologizing to Wanda as you leave.” Agatha firmly stated. “And I’m sure your mami agrees with me.”</p><p>Their daughter looked at Rio, obviously expecting her not to agree. However, Rio knew better than to go against Agatha’s parenting. “I think that’s a great idea.”</p><p>Nicky’s jaw dropped. “What?”</p><p>“You want to sleep at my place tonight, then you’re apologizing.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes–</p><p>Again with fucking eyerolling, did she get that from Agatha?</p><p>Did Agatha really roll her eyes that often?</p><p>“Fine, I’ll apologize to el diabla.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small breath. “Maybe a good start would be not calling her the devil.”</p><p>“It’s how I feel. I thought my feelings were valid.” Nicky quipped, smirking at the work around.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio clapped her hands together. “Let’s hit the road, shall we?”</p><p>They all trudged downstairs, briefly stopping in the dining room so Nicky could apologize, which she did. Wanda was a good sport, accepting it with a light-hearted chuckle and offering to get the chain of the necklace repaired. Nicky didn’t seem enthusiastic about that prospect but didn’t lash out either.</p><p>Agatha walked them to the door, saying her goodbyes. She outstretched her arms in the faintest hope her daughter might actually take her up on a hug. “Happy birthday. I love you, hon.”</p><p>Her daughter just pulled her headphones on, ignoring her plea for contact and saying a single “Love you.” before stepping outside and down the pathway to the street where Rio had parked.</p><p>Again, she’d rather take a bullet.</p><p>She loathed when her daughter did that. Negate the ‘I’ part of ‘I love you’. It was on purpose. It was said out of obligation, not genuine emotion.</p><p>“Told you.” Agatha glared at her ex and let her arms drop.</p><p>“I can hug you, if that’ll make you feel better.”</p><p>No physical contact was the safest option. Less probability of a fuck-up occurring.</p><p>“It won’t.”</p><p>It would.</p><p>“Fair enough.” Rio fished her key out of her pocket, forearm flexing.</p><p>Yeah, Agatha noticed shit like that. The tattoos on full display, the lack of bra, the way her fucking muscles moved. She should feel guilty, but they didn’t divorce because either of them were unattractive. After all, Agatha had eyes.</p><p>“I’ll bring the WD-40 over tomorrow.” Rio said, halfway out the door.</p><p>“You’re still gonna do that?”</p><p>“Of course I am. I won’t sleep well knowing something’s wrong. Have a good night, Agatha.”</p><p>She closed the door, letting herself slump against it for a moment.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t remember the last time she slept well.</p><p>“I should probably head out too,” Wanda said, grabbing her bag. “Feels like you need a minute.”</p><p>Agatha crinkled her brows. “I need years.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, “She’s thirteen, she’ll get over it.”</p><p>“Maybe I rushed things–”</p><p>“Babe, you waited seven months before you even introduced us.” Wanda placed a delicate hand on her wrist, reassuring her. “She just needs time. God knows I was horrible at her age too.”</p><p>Nicky wasn’t horrible, she was confident and sure of who she was. Agatha wasn’t raised in a home where she could be loud, or speak her mind. Even if it did come out in less than ideal ways, she was proud Nicky was able to stand up for herself. But explaining all that was too much, so she settled on the safer response.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“I had thicker eyeliner, but the sentiment was the same. Mad at the world, angry at my mom.”</p><p>“You were emo?”</p><p>“Hot Topic got so much of my money.” She chuckled before leaning in and kissing her goodbye. “I’ll get the necklace fixed but I won’t pressure her to wear it.”</p><p>“You’re nice.” Agatha grinned. “I’m sorry for everything tonight.”</p><p>“Like I said, I get it.” Wanda kissed one more time before opening the door. “Dinner? Monday night?”</p><p>“Sounds good.”</p><p>“Night, babe. I love you.”</p><p>“Love you.” Agatha said as she closed the door behind her girlfriend.</p><p>See? Perfect on paper.</p><p>Yeah, Agatha wouldn’t be sleeping well tonight.</p><hr/><p>The drive home was silent, Rio periodically looking over to her daughter in the passenger's seat. Her headphones were blasting some angsty teen music, her head turned to look out the window.</p><p>When they got home, Nicky stalked off towards her bedroom. And Rio probably should’ve left it alone, but that ache that never left her chest began to pulse. She followed after her daughter, finding Nicky already slumped on the bed.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio tapped her ear to signal that Nicky needed to take off the headphones.</p><p>She did so, furrowing her brows in the same obtuse way Agatha always had. “What?”</p><p>“Could you be a little bit more chill?”</p><p>“I am chill.”</p><p>Rio nearly keeled over in astonishment. “You, daughter of mine, are anything but chill.”</p><p>“I thought I reacted appropriately given the circumstances…”</p><p>“You called Wanda a bimbo.”</p><p>“<i>Tehcnically,</i> I implied she was a bimbo. Not my fault if everyone at the table immediately agreed that she was the bimbo in question.”</p><p>“Stop saying that word.”</p><p>“I learned it from you!”</p><p>“Yeah, because I didn’t realize you were within earshot when I was ranting to your aunt Alice on the phone!”</p><p>“Again, not my fault.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath. “Listen, I know this sucks–”</p><p>“It sure fucking does.”</p><p>“<i>But</i>,” Rio kept speaking, “I need you to be nicer to your mom.”</p><p>“I’m plenty nice.”</p><p>“You could improve.”</p><p>“I went out to dinner with her and Wanda last night, I wore that fugly necklace today.” Nicky sat up. “What else does she want from me?”</p><p>Rio sat down next to her. “Maybe a hug…?”</p><p>Nicky averted her gaze. “Hugs are meant to show affection. I don’t feel particularly affectionate towards her.”</p><p>“Okay, but she did literally use her own body to create yours,” Rio raised her brows, sucking some air through her teeth. “So find it within yourself to cut her some slack.”</p><p>“I don’t know why you’re always defending her. She left you.”</p><p>Thank you to her child for reminding Rio of that.</p><p>“No, she didn’t. She asked me to leave and I did.” Rio brought her hand up to card through her daughter's hair.</p><p>“Why did you?”</p><p>“Oh, mi vida.” Rio ignored her own wound to nurse her daughter’s. “Sometimes things happen, and it’s hard to fix them.”</p><p>“You’d think losing Alex would’ve brought you guys closer.”</p><p>Fuck, if that name didn’t want to make her crumble on the spot.</p><p>“Doesn’t always work out that way.”</p><p>“I don’t like her. I’m never going to.” Nicky said, referring back to Wanda.</p><p>“You don’t have to, but you have to ease up on your mom. She loves you just as much as I do.”</p><p>“Fine.” Her daughter grumbled, “But I want a real family dinner, no outsiders or bimbos.”</p><p>“‘I’ll call your mom tomorrow and see what we can do. Fair?”</p><p>“Fair.”</p><p>“Good.” Rio got up, walking towards the door. “I love you, teddy.”</p><p>“I love you too, mami.”</p>

<p>Agatha was sprawled out in bed, hair splayed against the pillow, sweat beading in her hairline. Agatha’s back arched closer to her mouth. “<i>Rio! Fuck!</i>” She groaned, one hand clutching the headboard and steadily creeping closer to her third orgasm.</p><p>The room was quiet, soft light filtering through the blinds and projecting onto the bed. Gentle sun peeking through, an outside world that had long since been discarded by the pair. Clothes littered the floor, torn off without a thought and leaving them both naked.</p><p>Rio was <i>thriving</i>. Four of her fingers working inside her love, tongue pressed against her clit. She’d buried herself here if it were allowed. Agatha’s thighs shaking around her head, her fingers tangled in Rio’s hair, urging her on. The subtle creaking of the bedframe being the only sound other than Agatha’s curses.</p><p>“Missed this.” Rio husked in between licks, “Missed you so, <i>so fucking much</i>, mi vida.”</p><p>“Missed you too, been too long.” Agatha moaned, veins of her neck straining against the skin. “I’m close.”</p><p>A wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon.</p><p>
<b>It was November, 2009.</b>
</p><p>And for the record, it had only been seventy-two hours.</p><p>Rio had pulled a double at the hospital, disappearing nearly all weekend before coming back to her place and crashing. She fed herself, showered, and knocked the fuck out for several hours. She rented a shitty and rundown house with Alice, and had since they were interns. Jen moved in last year, followed by Agatha moving in about four months ago.</p><p>Her girlfriend had been home all weekend, hanging out with (or terrorizing) Jen or grading papers. She’d let Rio sleep in before waking her up by making her come on her tongue, Rio roused and immediately rolled them over.</p><p>Which is how they got here, fucking all afternoon and ignoring anything else. Over two years together and it was still the honeymoon stage. Well, kind of. Sure, they budgeted groceries and had both held each other’s hair back when they were sick and puking, but that’s love. It was a kind of love that Rio wanted forever.</p><p>“Baby, jesus fuck!” Agatha cried, slamming her legs shut as she came and involuntarily crushing Rio’s head like a grape.</p><p>There was no better feeling than those thighs threatening to decapitate her, Rio could fucking bet on it. She kept going until the aftershocks subsided, slowly pulling out her fingers, now glistening with remnants of her girlfriend’s orgasm. Rio popped them in her mouth, moaning at the taste.</p><p>“Mi amor, Jen and Alice are going to hear you.”</p><p>“Jen and Alice spent all of Saturday fucking like bunnies, be grateful you weren’t home to listen to any of it.”</p><p>Rio made the crawl up Agatha’s body, leaving lingering kisses on her bush, and stomach, and tits, and neck, and cheek, before arriving at her lips. The kiss was simple but filled with affection, a content hum leaving Agatha’s throat. Rio could feel the smile Agatha was biting back as Rio’s tongue licked into her mouth.</p><p>“I love you.” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha brought a hand to her cheek, brushing away the stray hairs in front of her face. “I love you too.”</p><p>She nuzzled her nose against her girlfriend’s for a beat before pulling back. “Close your eyes.”</p><p>Blue eyes did not close. “What?”</p><p>Rio got off the bed, still buck naked, and walked over to the dresser. “Close your eyes.”</p><p>“Baby, if this is about you not liking me watching while you put on the strap, I told you I don’t look and–”</p><p>She pulled open the top drawer, where they kept their strap, but also their socks. “It’s not. Just close your eyes, woman.”</p><p>Agatha huffed but did so, slinging her forearm over her face for good measure. “Fine.”</p><p>Rio made her way back over, the box secured in her grasp. “Hold out your hand.”</p><p>“I <i>also</i> told you that we need to buy better cuffs. That locking mechanism is child's play–”</p><p>“Hand.”</p><p>Agatha whipped out her left arm, hand gingerly dangling. “Better be good.”</p><p>“It is.” Rio opened the box, sliding the cool metal against skin. “Open.”</p><p>Her girlfriend moved her forearm, eyes fluttering open and focusing on the ring now adoring her left ring finger. She furrowed her brows in an obtuse manner, lips pouting. “What’s this?”</p><p>“A ring.” Rio grinned, admiring the way the stone sparkled in the light.</p><p>“Yes, I realize that. What is it doing on my finger?”</p><p>“Thought it would look good there.”</p><p>“Riiiiight…” Agatha sat up, inspecting the jewelry. “So is this a ring with diamonds or a diamond ring?”</p><p>“Well, it’s actually a green tourmaline. Way more ethical, and in my opinion, prettier than a blood diamond that somebody mined while being exploited for cheap labor.”</p><p>Dark green stone, emerald cut, thin gold band, <i>just</i> over a karat, and vintage. Rio saw it last month in a shop window on her way back to the hospital after grabbing some local and not terrible coffee (the only place on campus was a Dunkin’), and just knew she needed to get it on Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“The latter.”</p><p>“I don’t recall you proposing.”</p><p>“I thought I was doing that right now…?”</p><p>“You didn’t ask.”</p><p>“Agatha Evelyn Harkness,” Rio started, her girlfriend groaning at the use of her middle name which she hated. “Will you marry me?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, tilting her hand and making the stone refract the beams of sun. “I suppose, since it’s already on my hand and everything–”</p><p>Rio shot forward, tackling Agatha and pining her to the mattress. “You wanna be my wife so bad.”</p><p>“I do not!” She chuckled, barely putting up a fight.</p><p>“You do! You wanna be Mrs. Agatha Harkness-Vidal so bad, it makes you look stupid!”</p><p>Her fiancee blushed, fighting to speak through her belly laughs. “I’m not hyphenating, I’m gonna be Mrs. Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s heart ticked up in speed, a genuine curl of her lips forming. “Mrs.Vidal?”</p><p>“It’s not like I’m in love with Harkness.” She snorted. “Besides, I like the thought of our kids being Vidals. It’s a good family name. <i>The Vidals</i>.”</p><p>“Dr. and Mrs. Vidal.” Rio said, getting a feel for their future. “I like it, sounds right.”</p><p>“Mmmh.” Agatha craned her head up, connecting their lips in a sweet kiss. “Now…celebratory engagement sex?”</p><p>“Fuck yes.” Rio jumped up, retrieving the strap for real this time. Her girlfriend propped up on her elbows and staring. “Okay, but…can you actually not watch?”</p><p>She flopped back down. “Oh my god!”</p><p>“What?! I feel awkward!”</p><p>“You’re ridiculous…”</p><p>“Mmmhh.” Rio fastened the harness, weaving the strap through the o-ring. “And you <i>love</i> me!” She then jumped onto the bed, settling herself on top of her fiancee.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks pulled tighter, her smile big and face rosy. “Sure.”</p><p>“Admit it.”</p><p>“I am fond of you.”</p><p>Rio lightly jabbed her side, right where she knew she was ticklish. “Admit it.”</p><p>“Rio!” She jerked, clumsily swatting Rio’s hand away through her giggles. “Ri- stop! Rio!”</p><p>“Admit it!”</p><p>“I love you!” She chuckled, finally relaxing once Rio pulled her hand away. “I love you.”</p><p>“Knew it.” Rio leaned in, her lips brushing Agatha’s. “I love you too. So much.”</p><p>“So much.”</p><p>A week later, Rio was parking her 1999 Subaru Forester in front of Agatha’s mom’s house. It was thanksgiving, the first they’d spend together since usually Rio was at the hospital. However, being newly engaged meant needing to actually <i>meet</i> her fiancee’s mom. Rio had never done so, despite Lilia and Agatha calling one another every week and spending a bare minimum of an hour on the phone every single time.</p><p>Rio didn’t particularly get along with her own parents, and didn't talk to them much. They were religious and conservative and proud of her for her education and career but not her ‘lifestyle choice’. They were part of that damned 44% of latinos that voted for Bush, so…enough said.</p><p>But it didn’t matter, because Rio was good with parents. Charming even. And any woman who produced someone as perfect as Agatha couldn’t be bad. As they walked up the frosted walkway to the door, Agatha stopped at the front door and hesitated. Her winter jacket swallowed her as she turned to face Rio.</p><p>“Listen, there’s a few things you need to know before we go in.”</p><p>Rio gave a nervous smile. “Like what?”</p><p>“My mom is loud, and completely lacking in boundaries, and <i>will</i> try to force feed you cannoli."</p><p>“How terrible…?”</p><p>“She’s also not…technically my mom.” Agatha raised her hands in defence at Rio opening her mouth to question. “Like, in every way she is. Just genetically, she didn’t birth me…”</p><p>Rio had assumed, like most people do, that Agatha was blood related to Lilia. She felt kind of douchey to have assumed that now, but her fiancee also never brought it up in the over two years they had been together.</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me you were adopted?” Rio tilted her head, genuinely just trying to understand.</p><p>Agatha let out a long breath. “Because I wasn’t.”</p><p>“I’m <i>so</i> lost.” She scratched her head through the knit beanie Agatha had made for her, a burnt orange color.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha let her shoulders drop, the tension leaving her body. “I grew up in foster care from when I was fourteen til’ I aged out. I don’t like talking about it because obviously it conjures <i>supper happy</i> memories and feelings...” She grimaced, “I bounced around about six different homes until I was placed with Lilia, which thank god, because she was the only one who was patient enough with me. She never formally adopted me, she offered, but by that time I was already about to turn eighteen and just didn’t want her to go through all the effort.”</p><p>Rio blinked a couple of times. “You grew up in foster care?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”</p><p>“I don’t know…Lilia’s my mom and it’s good enough for me.” Her posture shrunk. “Didn’t want to answer questions as to <i>why</i> I was in the system to begin with.”</p><p>“You don’t have to explain anything to me.” She smiled, taking the hand that had the sparkly green stone. “Honestly, I’m just glad she’s not a republican.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I think she’s still got her Obama ‘08 button somewhere.”</p><p>“<i>And cannoli</i>? Fuck, I lucked out in the in-law department.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, placing a chaste kiss against her lips. “I think I’m the lucky one.”</p><p>“Querida–”</p><p>The front door swung open, an older woman in flowy, patterned clothing appearing. Her hair was gray and curly and sitting atop her head in a rushed bun. “I waited as long as I could but you guys were taking too long and I got antsy.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away. “And to think I just called you patient.”</p><p>Lilia opened her arms. “You never visit, c’mere!”</p><p>Her fiancee huffed but threw her arms around her mom, letting the older woman engulf her. Her eyes then zeroed in on Rio, a grin spreading across her face. She let Agatha go, almost pushing her out of the way.</p><p>“The doctor!” Lilia then grabbed Rio, pulling her into a hug before she could react. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p><p>Rio brought her arms up, hugging back and looking at Agatha. “A lot, huh?”</p><p>Seven months later, they got married. They signed the paperwork and filed the marriage license in Massachusetts, one of the few states at the time where they could get legally wed. But, because they were young and in love, they also had one of those kitschy chapel weddings in Vegas. Agatha wore a $20 slip dress, short and off-white. Rio thrifted a suit, not bad for a men’s petite, honestly. Jen and Alice accompanied them, the trip costing most of their savings but very worth it for the memory alone. After leaving the chapel, tipsy and giggly, they passed a tattoo parlor. It was a little seedy, but they did $10 flash pieces. Leading Agatha to getting a cursive <i>R</i> on the side of her ribcage, Rio getting a cursive <i>A</i> in the same spot. It was a fucking miracle neither of them got a staph infection from it.</p><p>Around 2AM, the four of them were aimlessly wandering around their resort casino, when Agatha stopped at the craps table. Jen and Alice were playing slots as Rio supported her wife in her frivolous endeavor to spend money that they didn’t have. She leaned over the table, dress riding up and a cheap veil still stuck to her head.</p><p>“Blow.” Agatha held up the dice.</p><p>“Baby…”</p><p>“It’s good luck!”</p><p>“This is not luck, it’s chance.”</p><p>“We met by chance, we met again by luck.” Agatha pouted, still holding up the dice. “Blow me, baby.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek. “Sounds familiar.”</p><p>“You’re not gonna blow your wife?” She cocked her head. “It’s for a good cause.”</p><p>Rio smirked, quickly blowing on the sticky looking dice. “Happy?”</p><p>“Ecstatic.” Agatha turned, underhand throwing the dice along the felt of the table.</p><p>“Seven.” The casino guy called, clearing the table. “Congrats.”</p><p>Agatha, still not sober, blinked as he handed her a chip. Rio peered over her shoulder to see how much she had won.</p><p>“$5,000?!” Rio nearly screamed.</p><p>Agatha scrunched her nose, pursing her lips in victory. “Not bad for a $300 buy-in, huh?”</p><p>“My apologies to lady luck.”</p><p>Agatha slung her arms over Rio’s shoulders, drunkenly leaning into her. “Wanna take lady luck back to the room, handsome?”</p><p>“Fuck yes.”</p><p>The casino payout, mixed with a loan from Lilia, paid for the down payment of their home the following year. The housing market still recuperating after the 2008 recession also helped <i>temedously.</i></p><p>Wishbones being broken doesn’t guarantee luck and fortune to whoever got the bigger part. Throwing salt over one’s shoulder does not protect them or dissipate some non-existent bad karma. Black cats don’t signify death approaching.</p><p>Rio knew this, and yet, she felt like the luckiest woman alive.</p><hr/><p>“Mami!” Nicky called down the hall, her voice clipped.</p><p>Rio hastily put on her scrub top, walking down the hall to her daughter’s room. “What?”</p><p>“Have you seen my green button up?”</p><p>“The kinda olive toned one?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows. “No, but that's probably because it’s your mom’s and you keep stealing it from her.”</p><p>Agatha had that button up since before they started dating, Rio could quite literally count the times she shucked that shirt off to, well–</p><p>Not the time to think about that.</p><p>It was mid October, the usual morning panic occurred as Rio got herself ready for work and Nicky ready for school. She leaned against the doorframe. “You need it that bad?”</p><p>“Yes!” Nicky threw up her arms, currently dressed in jeans and a tank top. “I had a vision for this outfit.”</p><p>“A vision…sounds pretty serious.”</p><p>“I think it’s at mom’s place.”</p><p>“Sorry, teddy.”</p><p>“Can we stop there on the way to school?”</p><p>“Mi vida–”</p><p>“Please.” Nicky asked, using those huge amber eyes to her advantage.</p><p>“You literally have a whole closet of flannels, maybe too many. And I say that as a lesbian.”</p><p>“C’mon, if we leave now, we can stop with plenty of time.”</p><p>Rio sighed, “Fine. Text your mom, I'll throw something in the toaster for us to eat on the go.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” She dismissed, pulling out her phone.</p><p>“Hey, breakfast is important for a reason, and it is my legal obligation to feed you.”</p><p>After scarfing down frozen waffles, Rio diligently drove her daughter to the townhouse. She parked her 2025 Subaru Forrester on the street and watched as Nicky ran up the steps, using her key to get inside. Five minutes later, and no Nicky. Rio turned off her car, making her way up to the front door and letting herself in.</p><p>As Rio entered, she could feel the rage of her daughter before locating her. The kitchen and living room were empty, so she jogged upstairs, the sounds of voices becoming clearer.</p><p>“Seriously?!” Nicky shouted.</p><p>“Baby, I know you’re upset.” Agatha tried to soothe.</p><p>Rio scrunched her face, her gut swirling to signify danger. She walked to the open door of Agatha’s room, popping her head in.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio could’ve gone her whole life without this image seared into her head. She’d need to bleach her eyes later, this was too cruel of an image.</p><p>Agatha speaking to Nicky as Wanda laid in bed, fucking mortified. She should note that they were both fully clothed, but it still made her nauseous. Agatha hadn’t even switched out the mattress before sleeping with another woman in a room they once used to share.</p><p>“I texted you and you couldn’t have moved your bimbo!” Nicky groaned, tears welling.</p><p>“Nicky, I didn’t see it.” Agatha, dressed in a robe and hair wild, spoke. Rio remembers when she’d get to wake up to that sight, of Agatha sleepy with her bedhead. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>To be fair, it was Rio’s week and this was sprung on her ex wife with little notice.</p><p>“Can I just-” Nicky's voice broke. “Can I just have the shirt so I can go?”</p><p>Agatha’s own blue glazed over with tears, a somber smile appearing. “Yeah, yeah of course.” And opened the door to the walk-in closet, now half empty where RIo’s clothes used to hang.</p><p>Rio sucked in a harsh breath, accidentally making eye contact with her wife’s girlfriend. “Wanda.”</p><p>The red head winced, her hand covering her face. “Rio.”</p><p>Agatha flung the hanger back into the closet, handing the shirt to Nicky. “Hon–”</p><p>Nicky snatched the shirt and bolted out of the room, stomping down the stairs.</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio. “Really?”</p><p>“I told her to text you! How was I supposed to know Wanda would be here?”</p><p>“A call would’ve been nice.”</p><p>Rio wanted to scream that she shouldn’t have to call her own fucking wife, but that wasn’t reality. She bit back the bile in her throat. “Dually noted.”</p><p>Agatha’s face was stone. “Thanks.”</p><p>“Have a good day molding young minds.” Rio said, turning to leave.</p><p>“Have a good day saving babies.” Agatha murmured.</p><p>And Rio was aware of the connotations, the verbal jab. She didn’t take the bait though, going back downstairs and out to her car. She got in, her daughter trying very hard not to cry.</p><p>“Nicky…” She spoke, “Whatever you’re feeling is okay.”</p><p>“I hate her.” Her daughter said, tears spilling down her face. “I <i>hate</i> her.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes closed, willing the tears to stop. Thank god she hadn’t said that to her ex wife’s face, it would pulverize Agatha to hear it.</p><p>“No, you don’t.”</p><p>“I do!”</p><p>“No.” Rio said softly. “You don’t. She didn’t do anything to hurt you.”</p><p>“She–”</p><p>“I know. But it wasn’t on purpose, mija.</p><p>“It feels like she doesn't care.”</p><p>“She does. She cares <i>so</i> much.”</p><p>“Could’ve fooled me.” Nicky openly sobbed, using the back of her hand to wipe the snot. “I thought they were done. Hadn’t seen that <i>puta</i> in a month.”</p><p>Yeah, Rio was aware that Agatha had pulled back on integrating Wanda into family activities. They did that family dinner, just the three of them, last month. It was surprisingly tame, no yelling or fighting. But Rio was also aware that Agatha hadn’t ended things with Wanda, much to her own despair.</p><p>“Her dating doesn’t mean she doesn’t care about or love you. She’s a person outside of being your mom, teddy.”</p><p>“I know, I just-” Nicky cried, “I just thought that if she was single then…”</p><p>Then they’d get back together.</p><p>Her daughter just wanted her parents together.</p><p>Not a crazy thing to ask, or to want.</p><p>Hell, Rio would rip her own heart out of her chest and physically give it to her ex if it would mean they could go back to how they used to be.</p><p>“Oh, baby.” Rio cooed, pulling her daughter over the center console and hugging her. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Nicky’s frame shook in her arms, her mascara almost definitely staining Rio’s scrub top. They sat there for a few minutes until Nicky pulled back, wiping her eyes and pulling on Agatha’s shirt. She sniffled, shaking her head. “Can’t fucking belive her.”</p><p>“Mija, I'm just as guilty. You’re not being fair to her.”</p><p>“But you haven’t moved on! You’re not trying to replace your marriage with a woman almost a decade younger!”</p><p>Agatha was forty-two and Wanda was thirty-five so by no means was it midlife crisis territory, but Wanda being younger didn’t necessarily help Rio’s growing resentment.</p><p>“What happened between us had nothing to do with you.”</p><p>“Can we get coffee?” Nicky asked out of the blue, changing the topic of conversation.</p><p>Jesus, if only she recognized just how much her and Agatha were alike.</p><p>Rio turned the key in the ignition, starting the car. “Yeah, I think we’ve earned it this morning.”</p><p>Once her teenage daughter was irresponsibly caffeinated and dropped off at school, Rio got to the hospital. She made her rounds, but her smile grew when she got to her favorite patient.</p><p>William Kaplan, six years old, preferred to go by Billy. He had been coming to her almost since he was born, around the time she’d lost a kid of her own. He had leukemia and had endured more surgeries than anyone should in their life, let alone someone so young.</p><p>So, naturally, Rio felt a type of kinship with him.</p><p>She walked in, chart in hand. “Billy!”</p><p>“Rio!” He chirped, dinosaur stuffy in his clutches. Rio had given it to him over a year ago and he still held onto it as a symbol of pride. A reward for being brave.</p><p>“How are we feeling today, dude?” She asked, giving a nod to his parents. “I’m not saying I don’t like you guys, but I would <i>love</i> to stop seeing you here.”</p><p>“Feeling is mutual.” Rebecca said, face gray and tired.</p><p>“I feel okay.” Billy informed, his small body propped up on the bed. The chemo and cancer had stunted his growth, causing him to look much younger than he actually was. “Tommy’s ear is falling off.”</p><p>Tommy, the dinosaur, did have a loose ear.</p><p>“I keep meaning to sew it but–” Rebecca started.</p><p>“Oh, it's fine.” Rio said, gently taking the dinosaur and inspecting it. “I think he just needs a small surgery.”</p><p>“Like me!” Billy smiled.</p><p>Rio grinned. “<i>Exactly</i> like you.”</p><p>The rest of the day was fine, she got Billy’s surgery on the books and scarfed down what she could in between running around. Being a surgeon didn’t exactly mean getting to clock in and out at an exact time, so around 3PM, she called her ex. Agatha usually picked up Nicky or their daughter took the bus, however she didn’t anticipate being late today.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Can you pick up Nicky? I’m not getting out of here anytime soon.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Why do you sound surprised? She is my child.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know that, I guess I just figured you’d still be pissed.”</p><p>“I am, but not at her.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio worked her jaw. “I’m sorry for this morning, I thought you knew.”</p><p>Silence from the other end for a minute, then a sigh. “I’m sorry too. I didn’t want you or her seeing that.”</p><p>She bit her lip for a moment, never knowing when to leave well enough alone. “Yeah, me too.”</p><p>“It wasn’t on purpose!”</p><p>“I know. I just–”</p><p>Love you and wish you loved me back.</p><p>Want our family back.</p><p>Want you back.</p><p>Hate seeing our daughter cry.</p><p>“I’ve just had a long day.”</p><p>“I’ll pick up Nicky and bring her back to yours.” The line went dead immediately after, no room for argument.</p><p>Rio’s hand dropped from her ear, her phone going black.</p><p>“Fuck.” She muttered.</p><hr/><p>Nicky didn’t speak to Agatha as they drove home, her daughter decidedly keeping her mouth in a straight line. If she could go back in time to this morning, she would've happily kicked her girlfriend out before her daughter and ex arrived.</p><p>She’d beaten herself up for the past month, wondering if she should cut her losses and break up with Wanda. Sure, Wanda was attractive and smart, but she wasn’t worth the emotional toll it was taking on Nicky. But Wanda was also easy. Easy to be around, easy to spend time with, non offensive. And if she could just check out of the reality of her life for a tiny bit, should she have that right?</p><p>Wanda didn’t know about Agatha’s mother, or her upbringing. She wasn’t there when Agatha woke up in a hospital room, recovering from being sliced open and her baby missing. She didn’t witness Agatha rotting away in bed for weeks after, physically too frail to walk farther than the bathroom.</p><p>Wanda was just <i>simple</i>.</p><p>They got to Rio’s loft, Agatha holding the door open for a very grumpy thirteen year old. When Nicky started for her bedroom without saying anything, Agatha stopped her.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Agatha said, dropping her keys on the kitchen island. “Teddy, I’m really, <i>really</i> sorry.”</p><p>Her daughter, backpack still slung on her shoulder, olive green shirt still on her body, looked at her. “I never understood why mami always took your side. I thought maybe she was just a doormat. But then I really thought about it, why she would defend you no matter what.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say a word, she wanted to know what her daughter was thinking.</p><p>“And then I realized, all those times I left the house and came back to you in a better mood. When I’d spend the day with friends and get back to your place and see you changing the sheets.” Nicky’s eyes went glassy. “And it was <i>always</i> after a break up….”</p><p>“Nicky.”</p><p>“You guys were hooking up, right? You didn’t want me to know but I do and now you’re keeping mami on hold again.”</p><p>Way more than a kid should ever know about their parents.</p><p>And Agatha wasn’t keeping Rio on hold.</p><p>“Your mami is free to see whoever she wants.”</p><p>“And you know she won’t!” She dropped her backpack. “I’m not stupid, I watch you guys just as closely as you watch each other. She loves you and you let her. You date Wanda before mami can even <i>think</i> about someone else. You lost Alex and you fucking threw mami out!”</p><p>Agatha knew being a teenage girl, the anguish and the rage. But shit, if her own daughter wasn’t demolishing her bit by bit right now. She understood she couldn’t just smother Nicky with love, a pine tree doesn’t grow in a shotglass or whatever the fuck. But the need to reach out and make everything better was going haywire in her brain, to stop her baby’s pain.</p><p>“I understand that I’ve not been perfect, I get it. But, I’m not trying to cause you or mami pain.”</p><p>Nicky scoffed, cocking her head. “You don’t have to, you’re just naturally talented at it.” She picked up her backpack, running upstairs and shutting her bedroom door.</p><p>Agatha dropped her head into her hands, setting her elbows on the kitchen island. The tears stung as they escaped, stifling any sound so her daughter wouldn’t hear. She didn’t need Nicky feeling guilty, she just wanted her daughter to not hate her. She must’ve been standing there for twenty, thirty minutes.</p><p>The door gently shut and she whipped her head over at the noise, her ex standing there with a pizza. Rio set down the pizza, face etched with concern.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>And Agatha didn’t have the words, so she just reached out, grabbing her ex and burrowing her head into her shoulder and sobbing. “She hates me.”</p><p>“Second Vidal to cry on me today…” Rio’s arms reacted on instinct, embracing her. “She doesn’t. She’s thirteen.”</p><p>“I hated my mother at thirteen.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio pulled back fractionally, grabbing Agatha’s face and gently cradling it. “You’re <i>nothing</i> like your mother.”</p><p>“I’m fucking everything up.” Agatha sniffled, “I-I’m a terrible mom.”</p><p>Because that’s what it felt like, her relationship with her daughter collapsing because she couldn't just move on and get past Alex. Because Agatha let it consume her, let it eat her alive.</p><p>Her ex wife’s face scrunched, a cute frown forming. “You’re a great mom.”</p><p>“Great moms don’t have screaming matches with their kids.”</p><p>“I doubt it was a screaming match. You’re always louder, cariño.”</p><p>Against her better judgement, Agatha released a small chuckle. “I should go.”</p><p>“Why? It’s Friday, there’s pizza. I have booze.”</p><p>“Tempting.” Agatha grabbed her keys. “But I think I need to wallow alone. Nicky doesn’t want me here.”</p><p>Rio’s face fell. “Okay.”</p><p>“Hug her for me?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Agatha opened the door, leaving her daughter to her solitude. “She knows about us fucking periodically, by the way.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>“Yeah, so…have fun with that.”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>“Do you want me to go up there with you? See what happens?” She quirked a brow. “Really?”</p><p>Rio exhaled a breath. “I see your point, and while I don’t like it, I do respect it.”</p><p>“See you Sunday.”</p><p>As Agatha closed the door she heard “See you Sunday.”</p><p>As she got in her car Agatha slumped in the seat, her phone pinging at the same time. She lifted her hips, blindly fishing it out of her pocket and reading the text.</p><p><b>Wanda, 5:22:</b> Drinks? My place? We can drown in a bubble bath together.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, which wasn’t fair considering her girlfriend wasn’t privy to what she’d just endured from her daughter. If Agatha couldn’t spend the night with her daughter, she’d just rather spend it alone.</p><p><b>Agatha, 5:24:</b> Swamped with grading. Raincheck?</p><p><b>Wanda, 5:25:</b> Sure, I love you.</p><p>Agatha locked her phone, running a stressed hand through her hair. Ignoring her girlfriend because she couldn’t get her brain off Nicky. Maybe ending things would be for the best.</p><p>Maybe being alone would be better.</p><p>Then her mind flashed to hugging her ex wife, how safe it felt. How it remedied everything all at once. How she could’ve stayed there for longer, as long as Rio would’ve allowed.</p><p>No, she was not supposed to think that.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She could fix it, this problem could be solved.</p><p>She opened her phone again, thumbs flying across the screen.</p><p><b>Agatha, 5:29:</b> On second thought, I can be there in an hour…</p>

<p>“That’s the last of it.” Jen groaned, haphazardly dropping the box and kicking the front door closed.</p><p>Agatha rushed over, inspecting the wood of the door. “We <i>just</i> got the place, could you not?”</p><p>Jen cocked her head. “We’re helping you move all your shit in for free. So no.”</p><p>“You get the place checked for mold? It’s ancient.” Alice gawked, peering around the corner into the living room.</p><p>“Of course.” Rio said, digging through a box, “Not exposing my wife and future children to that.”</p><p>“Good.” Jen replied, running a hand over the century old banister of the staircase. “Because once that shit’s in your lungs…”</p><p>“Oh, I know.” Rio huffed, “Last thing I need is neurological issues twenty years down the line–”</p><p>“Oh my god.” Agatha snapped, pushing past the lot of them towards the kitchen. “Fuck, I will <i>not</i> miss living with three doctors. Fucking nerds.”</p><p>
<b>January, 2011.</b>
</p><p>And they had just spent the day trekking through snow and sleet to get everything moved into their new home. The one they <i>owned</i>. Agatha was pretty sure that was a first for a Harkness woman. Evanora just bounced from apartment to apartment until they evicted her ass, and subsequently, Agatha’s too.</p><p>They had gotten it at a bargain, the townhome being a little rough around the edges. Meaning, it was old and in desperate need of several thousand updates and repairs. But, Agatha’s hot and sexy wife swore she could do most everything herself with the exception of the ensuite bathroom off the master bedroom.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know much about the bathroom but did nearly keel over at the puny size of the closet in that same bedroom. Do people just not shop? Do they not need a different pair of jeans for each individual outfit? For the love of god, who owns less than ten pairs of shoes? Rio might call her a clothing hoarder, Agatha liked to think of herself as a curator. The fact that most of her life had been contained to a garbage bag or less for most of her adolescence might have something to do with it, but she digresses.</p><p>Rio promised to build her a walk-in, additionally, she also promised to line their living room with bookshelves for Agatha’s ever growing collection of literature. She <i>was</i> an English teacher after all, Rio knew what she was getting herself into.</p><p>They had a very precise budget to stick to, sure Rio was an attending now, and Agatha had taken on teaching an AP lit course to make more income, but money was still tight. Hence why they bribed their friends with the promise of beer and pizza if they helped them move. Jen and Alice didn’t keep the old house once Rio and Agatha announced they had found a place, instead they opted to get a swanky apartment near the hospital.</p><p>Alice was in pediatrics with Rio, Jen had one more year as a resident since she was in obstetrics and gynecology and had one more year of residency to complete. Probably the reason why they weren’t engaged yet, Jen wanted to be an attending before planning a wedding.</p><p>“Fine,” Jen smirked, “But the next time you have a UTI–”</p><p>“That was <i>one</i> time!” Agatha defended, opening the fridge and grabbing four beers. “And you can thank my lovely wife for that.”</p><p>Rio had kept her tied to the bed too long, consensually of course, but they probably should’ve taken a break for Agatha to pee.</p><p>Her wife grinned. “That was a good anniversary…”</p><p>“Gross.” Alice scrunched her face, taking a beer for her and Jen from Agatha’s hands.</p><p>The next couple of months proceeded with Agatha and Rio spending nearly every night and weekend working on the house. And she had to admit, there was something sick about her wife drilling and hammering shit in a beater tank. Agatha would diligently stand there, holding whatever for Rio, all the while drooling over how Rio’s arms fucking flexed. She pulled <i>so well</i>, those tattoos glistening with sweat as Rio ripped out drywall or lugged heavy shit around.</p><p>Needless to say, they got distracted.</p><p><i>A lot</i>.</p><p>She was pretty sure they had christened their new home fairly quickly, no room went unscathed. One memory in particular, of them installing the new counter tops before Rio bent her over said countertops, would always stay implanted in her brain. It’s not her fault their sex life was fucking addictive, it just <i>was</i>.</p><p>Agatha always felt her most powerful during sex. She felt strong and desired and she didn’t feel shame in that. Her wife felt the same way, apparently, dutifully falling to her knees when Agatha dropped her voice even slightly. Rio fucked Agatha like it was a privilege, which sometimes, she decided it was. She would make Rio beg and plead to just go down on her.</p><p>See? Powerful.</p><p>It was early spring when her wife texted, asking if Agatha could drop off some dinner since Rio would most likely be stuck at the hospital all night. Agatha agreed, getting off the couch and saving the spot in her book. She threw on her wifes Red Soxs hoodie and some leggings before heading out, she had been to the hospital a multiple times, but it was a still fucking maze.</p><p>She eventually stumbled upon the pediatric wing, lunchbox in hand. Agatha found the nurses station, making sure to drop them off some homemade cookies because while she wasn’t a great cook, she could bake pretty damn well. And the cookies ensured they were all nice to her wife, and everyone should be nice to Rio lest they be beaten very violently with a rock by Agatha. Once she chatted with them for far longer than she had actually wanted to, she went on the hunt for her wife. She knew Rio wasn’t in surgery because as a doctor’s wife, she had learned the routine. Nothing on the board indicated that she had anything scheduled, also, Rio’s lucky scrub cap was still on their dresser. It was one that Agatha had gifted her their first Christmas together, black and white with Snoopy patterned all over it and yellow Woodstocks.</p><p>She stopped briefly at the observation window where all the newborns laid in their small plastic bassinets. All soft, and squishy, and safe. She pouted her bottom lip, her brows furrowing as if the mere sight of a baby was going to make her burst into tears.</p><p>No.</p><p>Her and Rio had agreed to wait a few more years before starting their family, not ideal because Agatha was almost thirty and wanted her kids to be kind of closer together in age, but it was what they landed on. Rio had made it clear early on that she wanted kids, just had no interest in carrying. Which was fine by Agatha because despite her own upbringing, she actually liked the idea of being pregnant. Maybe something inside her wanted to give her kid the childhood she never had, which scared the fuck out of her. Because what if that was the same thought her mother had when she was pregnant with Agatha? Shouldn’t it have been? To bring a child into the world wanting to love them?</p><p>One of the babies cooed, a bundle of mush that would grow up to be an actual human. Agatha gently shook her head, she had to find her wife before she went crazy. She kept moving, the sterile smell of antiseptic burning her nostrils. She kept wandering until she hit the NICU, spotting her wife through the window.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Rio was holding a baby, a premie at that, slowly swaying in a rocking chair and nonsensically whispering. The hand with her simple gold wedding band cradled the tiny body, a soft smile on her face, her hair frenzied and scrubs wrinkled.</p><p>
<i>Is it wrong that the sight turned Agatha on?</i>
</p><p>Maybe it was a biological impulse but all she could think was how her wife needed to get her pregnant, as soon as humanly possible preferably. Agatha raised her hand, gently tapping her knuckles on the glass, watching as Rio’s eyes trailed up and met her own. Her wife’s smile grew, her gaze somehow softening even further.</p><p><i>I need to have her baby.</i> Agatha’s obviously hormonal brain helpfully supplied. <i>Biblically.</i></p><p>Once the baby was back in their crib, safe and sound, Rio met her in the hall. Her wife sprung forward, resting her hands on her waist as she kissed Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>“Thank you for dinner.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head towards the window. “Patient of yours?”</p><p>“Yeah. Her mom is a single parent, works late. She’s getting stronger medically, but I try to make sure she gets some physical touch. Babies don’t thrive without it.”</p><p>Yeah, neither did Agatha.</p><p>“Is that why you’ve been staying late so much recently?”</p><p>Rio flushed, slightly embarrassed. “I always earned high grades in bedside manner.”</p><p>Agatha handed her the lunchbox. “You have a minute?”</p><p>“Yeah? You wanna have dinner together?”</p><p>She smirked. “In a way.”</p><p>Eight minutes later Agatha had her wife pinned against the door of an on-call room, greedily groping at her body through her scrubs.</p><p>Rio’s hand fisted in her hair, biting her lip not to moan. “Where’d this come from?”</p><p>“You with a baby, mostly.” Agatha husked, one hand traveling underneath the waistband of Rio’s pants, the other wedging itself in her wife's sports bra. “So fucking hot.”</p><p>“I wor- work with babies a lot, cariño.” Her wife rasped as Agatha mouthed along her neck, as fingers lightly pinched her nipple. “Christ–”</p><p>“Yeah, but <i>seeing</i> it?” Agatha had to hold back her moan, her fingers brushing over trimmed hair. “God, I need to fuck you.”</p><p>Rio raised her arm, glancing at her watch. “I have ten minutes to eat before they’ll get suspicious.”</p><p>“I only need five.”</p><p>Two orgasms and six minutes later, her wife lounged on the twin bed, languidly eating the pb&amp;j sandwich Agatha had made her. There was also a bag of chips, some celery and baby carrots, a sugar free redbull, and a homemade cookie.</p><p>Agatha happily laid next to her wife, ignoring her own arousal for the time being and letting Rio scarf down enough to keep her going.</p><p>“So, are you actually going to tell me what that was about?” Rio asked, sucking some peanut butter off her thumb.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Guess seeing you like that did something to me…”</p><p>“Seeing me like what?”</p><p>“I don’t know…maternal?”</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>It wasn’t the right time, they should wait. Agatha already knew what Rio would say, and she’d rather not hear it. So, she shifted gears.</p><p>She quickly leaned over, giving Rio a chaste kiss before sitting up. “I should go, it’s 9PM and I have school tomorrow.”</p><p>Her wife sat up too. “Okay.”</p><p>She stood, kissing her once more. “Try to be home at a reasonable hour?”</p><p>“No promises.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Enjoy the food and the post-sex glow.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yeah, you should visit me at work more often.”</p><p>“Mmhhh.” Agatha hummed, quirking a brow. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go home and masturbate furiously in our marital bed before passing out.”</p><p>Rio’s face twisted forlornly. “Mi amor!”</p><p>Agatha opened the door, throwing a wink as she left. “Have a good night saving babies.”</p><p>She kept her word, enjoying three self induced orgasms before falling asleep, idly noting her wife crawling into bed around two o’clock in the morning. Agatha could smell the cedar of Rio’s perfume and that familiar antiseptic. A warm hand grazed her hip, fingers playing with the waistband of her underwear. Agatha was a big advocate for the big shirt and no pants combo when she went to bed, her wife knew and absolutely loved this.</p><p>“Mornin’.” Agatha grumbled, only half awake. She turned over, peeking her eyes open enough to see Rio grinning.</p><p>“Morning.” Her wife said, hand now fully sheathed in Agatha’s panties.</p><p>“How are you horny at this hour?” She gasped as Rio trailed her fingers through her already wet cunt.</p><p>“Thought I’d return the favor.” Rio reasoned, lurching forward to kiss her. “And we need to talk.”</p><p>“Right now?” Agatha asked, raising her own hand to tangle in Rio’s t-shirt. “C-can it wait?”</p><p>“You’re more honest when you’re about to come.”</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers steadily worked her up. “What got into you tonight?”</p><p>“I-uh,” Agatha swallowed. “You looked good.”</p><p>“I always look good to you, there’s more.”</p><p>Curse this woman for always seeing through her, and fuck her for knowing an orgasm was like a truth serum on Agatha.</p><p>She arched her back and hiked her leg over Rio’s hip once she felt two fingers find her entrance. “You…with a baby, it- it did something for me.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft moan as Rio started thrusting. “Thought about you with our own…”</p><p>“Our own?”</p><p>“Baby. Our own baby.”</p><p>Rio’s thumb came to her clit, massaging it. “Our kid, huh? Your eyes and attitude in a tiny body?”</p><p>“Y-your eyes.” She corrected, her stomach swirling. “And your tooth gap, your crooked smile–”</p><p>“You wanna have my babies, mi alma?”</p><p>Fucking obviously.</p><p>“The- the attitude though should be mine. You’re too nice.”</p><p>“Oh that kid would rule the world.”</p><p>“Yeah.” She breathed out, so fucking close.</p><p>And of course that was the exact moment Rio stopped, ignoring Agatha’s whine in protest. “Should we get started on that?”</p><p>Agatha’s brain worked to play catch-up. “We said we’d wait.”</p><p>“Doesn’t seem like you want to.”</p><p>“Do you?”</p><p>“I think you’d look so <i>fucking good</i> carrying my baby.” Rio said, starting to pump again. “The image alone–”</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha whimpered, walls clenching around her wife’s fingers. “Fuck, fuck–”</p><p>“That’s it, baby.”</p><p>Her body tensed, body going slack once her orgasm dissipated. “We-we don’t have the money for a kid.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers stayed buried inside of her. “Straight people have kids with no money all the time. We’re already doing a lot better than most of them.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>Rio rolled onto her back, taking Agatha with her. She placed a hand on the small of Agatha’s back, helping her to get situated on top. “Not to brag, but my medical insurance is pretty kickass.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha purred, hips rolling. “Keep talking dirty to me, love.”</p><p>“Covers IVF, genetic testing, fertility appointments…”</p><p>“Say shit like that and I’m gonna come again.”</p><p>“Almost nothing out of pocket…”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha came twice more that early morning, leaving her exhausted the rest of the day. But, it was worth it.</p><p>Rio saw Agatha in a way no one else ever had, or ever would. She was patient and loving, and spent those traits on Agatha for whatever deluded reason. She was cherished by her wife, and Agatha secretly thanked the universe or some unknown god for that every day.</p><p>Fate brought them together, and Agatha was grateful for it for fifteen years.</p><p>Well, thirteen.</p><hr/><p>“Mrs. Vidal?” The voice on the other end asked.</p><p>Agatha sat at her desk in between periods, physically recoiling at the use of her last name. She kept meaning to change it after the divorce, but just kept putting it off. She never liked the last name Harkness, it was her mothers.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha answered, leaning back in her chair.</p><p>“I’m calling from your daughter’s school, we’re going to have to ask you and Nicky’s other mom to come down here.”</p><p>Her spine stiffened, shooting forward and leaning on her desk. “What’s wrong? Is she okay?”</p><p>“She’s fine, but she is in trouble. The principal is asking you to meet her as soon as possible.”</p><p>Trouble? Nicky got straight A’s. What fucking trouble?</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Mrs. Vidal…she punched another student.”</p><p>Her daughter got Agatha’s fucking attitude alright.</p><p>She let out a sigh. “I’ll be there in an hour.”</p><p>After begging and pleading for one of her coworkers to watch her next class, Agatha hauled ass to her daughter’s middle school, striding down the hall towards the front office. She had called Rio, but no answer. Typical.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders back, cracking her neck before bursting through the door. Immediately seeing Nicky sitting in a chair near the secretary’s desk, ice pack on her knuckles. Across the room, another kid sat. Yikes, his face was <i>messed up</i>.</p><p>Agatha crouched down in front of her daughter. “You okay?”</p><p>Nicky, being her daughter, just nodded. She looked somewhat remorseful, but not upset. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“What the hell happened?”</p><p>“That guy was being a dick.” Nicky tilted her head towards the injured boy. “Pissed me off.”</p><p>“Easy there, scrapper.” Agatha grinned, “We only use violence when we know we won’t get caught.”</p><p>Nicky’s face pulled into a small smile, a light chuckle following. “Thought you’d be proud, I think I broke his nose.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, placing a soothing hand on Nicky’s knee. “I really hope his parents don’t sue.”</p><p>A door opened, the principal popping her head out. “Mrs. Vidal? A word?”</p><p>Working in the same district that her daughter was enrolled in, meant that she was already acquainted with most of the faculty. Including Nicky’s principal, Valentina Allegra de whatever. Agatha didn’t particularly care for the woman, her superiority practically leaked out of her.</p><p>She gave her daughter's knee a reassuring squeeze before following the  principal into her office, the door shutting behind her.</p><p>“Please, have a seat.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but did so.</p><p>“I’m sure you can understand why we called.”</p><p>She chuckled. “Yeah, I have a few ideas.”</p><p>“I won’t keep you long, I know it’s the middle of the school day.” Valentina insincerely smiled. “We just–”</p><p>The door clambered open, Rio sprinting through in her scrubs and jean jacket. Fuck, it was Novemeber and she wasn’t even in a winter coat yet.</p><p>“I’m here!” Rio announced, taking a seat next to Agatha. “Sorry, sorry.”</p><p>Valentina smirked. “That’s okay, <i>Dr. Vidal</i>. I know you’re busy saving lives.”</p><p>Agatha fought not to roll her eyes again, the amount of times women openly fawned over or hit on Rio throughout the years made her nauseous. Even while they were married, Nicky’s teachers, coaches, tutors, made their interest clear. Yes, Rio was a doctor, made good money, owned a nice loft, and was amazing in bed. But did every woman with a beating vagina have to recognize that?</p><p>“I was–” Rio laughed at herself. “I was actually performing surgery on a dinosaur.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha cocked her head.</p><p>“My patient, his stuffed dinosaur’s ear was loose. I sewed it for him so he could have it with him during his own surgery.”</p><p>Valentina fucking gushed at that. “That is <i>so</i> thoughtful of you. Those kids are lucky to have a doctor like you.”</p><p>“Yup, uh huh.” Agatha said. “So our daughter?”</p><p>“Right.” Valentina answered, though her eyes stayed on Rio. “She punched another student today during lunch.”</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked.</p><p>“The reason is unclear, but what is, is that your daughter is struggling.”</p><p>“Like, academically?” Agatha scrunched her face.</p><p>“No.” Valentina said. “We’ve noticed a change in Nicky over the past couple months, she’s more frustrated, quick to anger. Is something going on at home?”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Agatha’s body deflated against the chair. “Uh, yeah.”</p><p>“Agatha’s been seeing someone.” Her ex wife happily supplied. “It’s been hard on Nicky.”</p><p>Valentina gave a sympathetic frown. “Poor girl.”</p><p>“Yes, we’re aware.” Agatha groaned.</p><p>“I’d recommend seeking some help.”</p><p>“Help?” Rio echoed.</p><p>“A therapist or counselor."</p><p>“You think Nicky needs therapy?” Agatha squawked. "She's not crazy.”</p><p>Valentina shrugged. “Therapy after parents splitting up and a new partner being introduced could help her. She’s always been an excellent student, so we’re willing to cut her some slack this time. But, I would urge you both to explore some resources.”</p><p>“Great.” Agatha hissed, standing. “Is Nicky free to go?”</p><p>“We’ll have you take her home today, but she’s welcome back tomorrow.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio chirped, standing and following Agatha out.</p><p>“Thank you, <i>doctor</i>.”</p><p>Keep it in your pants, lady.</p><p>Rio closed the door, exchanging a look with Agatha. Fuck, she thought the therapy was a good idea. Agatha shook her head, silently saying that they’d discuss it later.</p><p>It was Agatha’s week, so after calling the high school to let them know she’d be taking a half day, they collected Nicky and headed out to the car. Agatha unlocked it, letting Nicky get in the passengers side, hanging back to talk to her ex.</p><p>“You <i>honestly</i> think she needs therapy?!”</p><p>Rio cocked her head. “She’s yelling at you, she’s punching people…yeah, I do.”</p><p>“She’s a kid who’s going through something!”</p><p>“Yeah, and she shouldn’t have to do it alone, Agatha!”</p><p>“All a shrink will do is tell her that I ruined her life, which she is already aware of.”</p><p>Rio brought up a hand to rub her temple. “You didn’t ruin anything, a shrink could help her to see that. Hell, maybe it’d fix your relationship with her. I can’t be the bridge between you two forever.”<br/>
</p><p>And she knew it was mean but, “Like you don’t take a little pleasure in being her favorite.”</p><p>“No, I actually don’t!” Rio whisper shouted, mindful of Nicky in the car. “I hate it, Agatha! Our daughter is hurting, she’s struggling and we need to get her some help!”</p><p>“I can’t afford therapy.”</p><p>“Good thing I can.”</p><p>She fucking loathed when Rio did that, threw her money around. It made Agatha feel inadequate, like she couldn’t provide for her own child. It was bad enough she took money from Rio every month, now she needed to depend on her for this.</p><p>“Thank god for kickass insurance, right?” Agatha muttered, reaching for the door handle. “I’ll talk to her about it.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Rio checked her watch. “I gotta get back to the hospital, but call me tonight?”</p><p>“Can’t wait.” Agatha replied in a sickly sweet voice. “I look forward to it.”</p><p>Her ex wife just sighed, running around to the other side of the car and saying goodbye to Nicky before walking to her own car. Agatha got in, dropping the keys in her lap and looking at her daughter.</p><p>“Okay, seriously. What happened?”</p><p>Nicky held the melting ice to her bruised knuckles. “Nothing.”</p><p>“Teddy, I’m not mad, I just want to understand.”</p><p>Nicky turned her head, letting out a deep breath. “He was bullying a non verbal autistic kid, okay? Calling him names and slurs. And the teachers weren’t doing shit. And sue me, it pissed me off. He shoved the kid against the wall and nobody was doing anything!”</p><p>“Jesus, that’s some Disney villain shit.”</p><p>“I know! The kid started crying and no one blinked. I j-just got angry, okay? I won’t do it again.”</p><p>“Did you tell any of the teachers?”</p><p>“It was the first thing I did, but they said it was just ‘roughhousing’, boys will be boys type of stuff…”</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha mumbled, cautiously reaching out and placing her hand on Nicky’s forearm.</p><p>“It’s 2025, who bullies people in real life anymore? Have the decency to do it behind a screen, at least.”</p><p>“Assholes.”</p><p>“Am I in trouble?”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “No, but your mami and I do think it’d be good if you talked to someone.”</p><p>“Talked to someone?”</p><p>“A therapist, maybe.”</p><p>Nicky blinked, processing the information. “Why?”</p><p>“Teddy, things haven’t been okay lately, and I get why. But, you’re lashing out more, you’re angry all the time. It can’t be healthy.”</p><p>She expected her daughter to yell, to take offense, maybe even storm off. Miraculously, however, none of those things happened.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>Nicky shrugged. “Better than being grounded.”</p><p>“Grounding would insinuate I don’t agree with your actions, I would’ve done the same thing.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Agatha picked up her keys, putting them in the ignition. “Oh, you have no clue the amount of men I’ve punched.”</p><p>“You sound proud.”</p><p>“I am, specifically of you.” She reached for the gearshift. “Let’s say we get some ice cream for you, bruiser.”</p><p>Nicky giggled. “I don’t think you’re supposed to reward me for this.”</p><p>“Definitely not and don’t tell your mami.”</p><p>“So, I get out of school early and get ice cream? Damn, mom. Thanks.”</p><p>And did her heart flutter at her daughter being nice to her? Sure. Was she being the best parent right now? No way in hell. But she had to take the small wins where she could get them. As she began backing out, her phone rang, bluetooth connecting to the screen on her dash, displaying Wanda’s name.</p><p>Fuck, this woman and her timing.</p><p>“What does Ethan Slater want?” Nicky muttered.</p><p>Agatha clicked the decline button. “Doesn’t matter.”</p><p>She’d call Wanda back, but right now, she had her kid. Nicky actually wanted to be around Agatha for the first time in months, she was holding onto this moment with a fucking chokehold.</p><p>Nicky fiddled with the screen, trying to find music. “How much Stevie Nicks have you loaded into this thing?”</p><p>“Just like every album, single, and live performance…”</p><p>“That might be gayer than your marriage to a woman.”</p>

<p>Rio rattled her keys around her finger, basically slumping up the steps to her townhouse. Her shift had been awful, losing a patient on hour thirteen of a fifteen hour shift. It was 7pm, the front porch left on by her wife for when Rio came home. The ice on the second step nearly taking her out completely, fuck she’s gotta salt that tomorrow.</p><p><b>December, 2011.</b></p><p>She slid her key into the lock, taking a moment before turning it. It’s not that she was avoiding going home, she was always happy to leave the day behind and focus on her wife. But they had been going through the process of getting Agatha pregnant for all of summer and fall. Rio had suffered through the hormone shots so they could go through with the egg retrieval, ending up with six embryos from ten eggs. The first embryo didn’t stick and they shrugged it off, knowing the likelihood of Agatha getting pregnant wasn’t high.</p><p>They had both gone through testing just to make sure they were healthy and wouldn’t run into any trouble trying to conceive. And while technically Agatha <i>could</i> carry, Jen was clear it would be harder for her. Rio was shocked, her wife had a normal cycle, nothing out of the ordinary, so when they got the news it made her falter.</p><p>There were things about her wife’s past that Rio knew she wasn’t aware of, Agatha’s childhood specifically. There were hints, the way Agatha’s left wrist was jutted out just <i>slightly</i> more than considered normal. To the common eye, nothing looked different, but Rio was a doctor, she knew what a broken bone that never healed properly looked like. There was the way Agatha ate, Rio would obviously never comment on it, but her wife did eat like her food would be snatched from her at any second. There was the way Agatha’s whole body went rigid whenever someone clapped even kind of near her head.</p><p>Rio never said anything, the context clues were enough.</p><p>But she did silently vow to herself that if she ever came across Evanora Harkness, that cunt was going to leave the scene in a fucking bodybag.</p><p>Because if Agatha was malnourished as a kid, it could explain why her body was struggling to carry a child now. So, they did another implantation with the second embryo–</p><p>No dice.</p><p>Rio comforted Agatha, letting her know it was nothing wrong with her and it would happen when it happened. And it worked up until the third embryo, when that test came back negative? Rio held Agatha on their bathroom floor as her wife sobbed, totally discouraged. And it hurt, it that Rio couldn’t fix it for her. She was literally a doctor, she fixed people for a living. But she couldn’t fix this.</p><p>So, as Rio stood with her key in the lock, she took a deep breath. They had just done another implantation with embryo number four and agreed to take the test together after Rio got home from work today. Hence her apprehension to go inside her home right now.</p><p>She was already so drained, having a child die in front of you kind of does that to a person. And she didn't know if she could be a good support for Agatha if another test came back negative. Working in pediatrics was great most days, kids are far more resilient than adults, but it also made the losses so much harder to take. There was a fine line between letting herself grieve appropriately and letting herself be consumed by it. Couldn’t go numb, but couldn’t get too invested either.</p><p>She turned the lock, opening the door and wiping the snow off the soles of her boots on the welcome mat.</p><p>“Baby?” Agatha’s voice called from the kitchen.</p><p>Rio took off her beanie and jacket, followed by her boots. “Hi.” She called back, shuffling down the hall.</p><p>“How was your day?”</p><p>“Fucking awful.” She turned the corner into the kitchen, finding her wife at the stove of all places. “You’re cooking?”</p><p>“I <i>do</i> know how.” Agatha quipped, dressed in a Mass Gen hospital sweater that she’d stolen. Rio got a lot of freebies with the hospital’s logo, which meant that they had Mass Gen mugs, mouse pads, sweaters, and pens. “Beer?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah.” Rio blinked, her wife seemed perky for whatever reason. “Special occasion?”</p><p>Agatha closed the fridge walking over and handing Rio the bottle, her face all rosy and cheery. “No, just felt like making sure you come home to a warm meal.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her gaze, twisting off the cap. Agatha didn’t really cook, she threw frozen shit in the oven and called it a day. And Rio <i>loved</i> her wife, hand to god, but anything Agatha did make was usually very underseasoned. Not her fault, she doubts that the monster who birthed Agatha knew how to properly season chicken, but Rio was cautious about whatever Agatha was about to serve.</p><p>“What are we having?” Rio asked, it smelled good in here, like garlic and herbs.</p><p>“My mom very graciously gave me her lasagna recipe.” Agatha checked the oven, setting the timer. “Don’t tell her I used store bought sauce, though.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, taking a sip. “Your secret is safe with me.”</p><p>“Why was today awful?” She asked, finally walking over and greeting Rio with a kiss.</p><p>“Lost a patient.”</p><p>Agatha’s face crinkled. “I’m sorry, baby.”</p><p>“Four years old.”</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>“Yeah, so…” Rio lifted her beer. “Good call on this.”</p><p>“Well, I think I know something that’ll cheer you up.”</p><p>“Cariño, I love you, but sex will not fix my mood–”</p><p>“It’s not that, c’mon.” She grabbed Rio’s wrist, leading them into the living room. It was the holiday season, so they had the tree up as well as all the kitschy Christmas decor.</p><p>Agatha sat Rio down on the couch, grabbing a small gift bag from underneath the tree. It had tiny dinosaurs with Santa hats printed all over, red tissue paper sticking out. She held it out in front of Rio, a small grin on her face.</p><p>Rio set her beer down, grabbing a coaster of course, Agatha didn’t appreciate rings on her Pottery Barn side tables. “Christmas isn’t for, like, three weeks.”</p><p>She shrugged. “Santa came early.”</p><p>Rio took the bag, quirking a brow as she did so. “Is this a pity present?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha chuckled, staring intently.</p><p>Rio pulled out the tissue paper, something fabric wrapped underneath all the layers. She set the bag aside, pulling at the paper. “New scrub cap?”</p><p>“I thought you liked Snoopy?”</p><p>“I <i>love</i> Snoopy. I’m just trying to figure out what you could’ve gotten me that would be <i>this</i> small.” Rio threw the rest of the paper elsewhere, a neatly folded square of white cotton revealed.</p><p>Rio’s fingers hooked under the fold, making it unravel. Her eyes widened as she read what the fabric said—</p><p>What the onesie said.</p><p>It had a drawing of Snoopy hugging Woodstock on the front, font below saying <i>The Vidals, est. 2012.</i></p><p>The onesie was for a newborn, meaning–</p><p>Rio finally looked up, tears in her eyes as it clicked. “You’re…”</p><p>“I ordered it when we first started trying.” Agatha’s smile took up her whole face, blue orbs going glassy as she nodded. “I couldn’t wait and I took a test this morning.”</p><p>Her jaw dropped, the tears coming out faster now. “You’re pregnant.”</p><p>“I’m pregnant.”</p><p>Rio dropped the onesie next to her, pulling at Agatha until she was in her lap. “<i>You’re pregnant.</i>”</p><p>Agatha laughed through her own tears. “We’ve established this.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you wait for me?” Rio questioned, her smile matching Agatha’s.</p><p>“I didn’t want to put you through all the crying again if it was negative.”</p><p>“Baby, you didn’t put me through anything.” She reassured, before trailing her gaze down to Agatha’s stomach. She splayed her hand on her wife’s lower abdomen. “My kid’s in there.”</p><p>Agatha only laughed harder. “You know damn well it’s only a bundle of cells in here.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio looked at her wife, who was currently sitting on her lap. “But it’s <i>our</i> bundle of cells.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands shot out to cradle Rio’s face. “I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too, mi alma. <i>So much</i>.”</p><p>“We have to come to a consensus about names now.”</p><p>“I just don’t see what’s so wrong with Luna.”</p><p>“I’m not naming my child after the moon!”</p><p>“The moon is cool!”</p><p>“Then you should’ve knocked up a different woman.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, bringing her hands to her wife’s hips. “No, I think I knocked up the right woman.” She smirked, dragging Agatha closer. “In fact, let me knock you up again.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I don’t think that’s how that works.”</p><p>“No, it is. I’m a doctor, trust me.” Rio said, gently pushing Agatha so she was on her back, climbing on top of her. “If I work fast enough maybe we can go for twins.”</p><p>Agatha beamed, pulling her close. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep, my love.”</p><p>“Never.” Rio whispered, connecting their lips as her hand trailed under the waistband of Agatha’s sleep shorts. “Can’t let down the mother of my child.”</p><p>“I’m holding you to that.”</p><p>“Please do.”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha definitely did. Pregnancy did not treat Rio’s wife well. Throughout the following nine months, Rio never broke her promise. Agatha picked out nursery furniture? Rio built it. Agatha woke up in the dead of night craving a crunchwrap supreme? Rio drove to Taco Bell at 2am. Agatha was horny? Well, Rio was more than happy to oblige. Agatha was horny again? Rio was there, <i>happily</i>. Agatha was horny–</p><p>Yeah, pregnancy made Agatha kind of feral when it came to sex. Literally morning, noon, and night. Eventually it got to the point where Agatha would just greet Rio after work by telling her to go put on her cock. Which, Rio did <i>not</i> complain about. Her wife was fucking beautiful before pregnancy, but during? Yeah, it was a miracle they didn’t have to pry Rio off with a crowbar.</p><p>The downside was everything else. There were numerous occasions where Rio had to scoop Agatha off the bathroom floor and take her to the ER for dehydration. Her wife’s morning sickness was so intense that Agatha would drink something, and it would come back up still cold. Getting Agatha to keep anything down was also a challenge, Snoopy didn’t seem to like most food.</p><p>They called the baby Snoopy until they settled on a name, which took until month eight. Agatha was sprawled in their bed, huge shirt straining against her belly as Rio massaged her feet because those always ached. It didn’t help that Agatha’s third trimester was during the hottest time of the year. They didn’t even go to pride that year, Agatha was too uncomfortable standing in the sun.</p><p>“Camila.” Rio offered, thumbs digging into Agatha’s heel.</p><p>“Mmmm.” Agatha moaned, hands resting on her bump. “I like it, it’s pretty and it can be gender neutral as a nickname.”</p><p>Rio’s face scrunched. “Cam?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Nope, never mind.”</p><p>“Okay, Artemis?” Agatha offered, “Artie for short?”</p><p>“What’s up with you and Greek names?” Rio tilted her head. “And Artemis is terrible.”</p><p>“Fine.” She huffed. “I’ll keep thinking.”</p><p>“What about boy names?”</p><p>“We’re having a girl, my love.”</p><p>They found out as soon as humanly possible. Jen was Agatha’s OB and she very excitedly announced that they would not be contributing to the male population, which Rio was a little relieved by. She didn’t know how men worked, she had one brother but that was it. A girl was safer, she could relate to a girl.</p><p>“I know, but maybe we could pick a name from that list and make it work.”</p><p>“I liked August, but then I got an August assigned to my class and he’s a total prick. So, that name is ruined forever.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio laughed, still massaging. “I always liked Milo. We could do Mila?”</p><p>“That’s basically Camila, we’re back to square one.”</p><p>“Well, Snoopy is going to need a real name soon.”</p><p>“Oh my god!” Agatha sat up. “A few years back, I had a Nicholas in my sophomore English class and he was the sweetest boy ever. Kind, smart, considerate. Seriously, an angel. I had Nicholas on my list ever since then, but didn’t think we could use it. What about Nicola?”</p><p>“Nicola.” Rio tested it out, grinning. “Nicola Vidal.”</p><p>“Nicky for short, still gender neutral…”</p><p>“I think I’m stuck on Camila.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “What if Camila is the middle name?”</p><p>“Why does my pick get middle?”</p><p>Agatha cocked her head. “Sorry, who’s growing this child?”</p><p>She tucked her tongue against her cheek. “You are.”</p><p>“And will she not <i>also</i> have your last name?”</p><p>“She will.”</p><p>“So,” She raised a single brow, “I think that entitles me to the configuration of the name.”</p><p>“Nicola Camila Vidal.”</p><p>“Nicola Camila Vidal.”</p><p>“Sold.”</p><p>Nicky was born in September 2012, seven pounds, nineteen inches. Her wife’s labor was only a few hours, Rio joked that it was because Nicky had Agatha’s impatience. Agatha responded by crushing Rio’s hand, her <i>surgical</i> hand, on the next push. So labor is not a time for jokes, got it.</p><p>They laid in the hospital bed after, Agatha sweaty and shaky as she cradled their daughter, hair stuck to her face. Rio was next to her, peering down at their <i>perfect</i> baby girl. Her eyes took up most of her face, sparse brown hairs clinging to her head. Agatha trailed her index finger along Nicky’s cheek, smiling so hard Rio wondered if her face hurt. It must’ve, because Rio was wearing the <i>exact</i> same smile.</p><p>“Hi, little girl.” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“You did amazing, baby.” Rio said as she kissed her wife’s cheek. “She’s perfect.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze stayed glued to their daughter. “You let me down.”</p><p>“What?” Rio looked at her.</p><p>Agatha turned her head, giggling to herself. “Not twins.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, letting her body sink further into the bed. She might’ve let Agatha down, but as she watched her wife and child, something told her that it didn’t matter. They were everything to Rio–</p><p>And they always would be.</p><hr/><p>Agatha made a mental checklist in her head.</p><p>Nicky’s next dentist appointment.</p><p>Department meeting.</p><p>She <i>had</i> to go grocery shopping tomorrow.</p><p>And, shit, Nicky’s therapist left a message in the patient portal and Agatha hadn’t fucking read it yet.</p><p>“Are you close?” Wanda asked, popping her head out from between Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Oh fuck, that’s right. Her moans must’ve stopped when she got distracted.</p><p>She was currently sprawled out in her bed, naked, with her girlfriend down on her knees and tongue between her thighs. This was <i>after</i> Agatha had so lovingly supplied her girlfriend with three ‘good morning’ orgasms, because fuck Rio, Agatha could be a giver.</p><p>Now, usually, Agatha had no problem speaking up when someone wasn’t fucking her correctly. But, it wasn’t even Wanda’s fault, any woman post-Rio couldn’t get the job done. Hell, it was why the booty calls occurred the second Agatha would become single again. It was never the woman, it was never the technique. It was her motherfucking ex wife.</p><p>“Mmmhh.” Agatha hummed, slinging an arm over her eyes. “Sorry, sweetheart.”</p><p>“It’s okay.” Wanda’s voice pitched higher, a lie.</p><p>Agatha would let her go for a couple of minutes before faking it and waiting for Wanda to disappear so she could get herself off. Any orgasm not induced by Rio, was due to her own hand or vibrator. Honestly, Wanda might stand a chance in hell in actually wringing an orgasm from Agatha if she clipped those damn talons and used her fingers. Some women didn’t like penetration, Agatha fucking <i>loved</i> it. She loved being full, she loved being <i>fucked</i>. But, Wanda didn’t want to wear a strap or cut two nails shorter, so that thought was a dead end.</p><p>“You want me to keep going?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Um–” Agatha’s phone rang, saving her from having to make the decision. She looked over, Rio’s caller ID lighting up her phone. “Shit, I gotta take this.”</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Need I remind you of the last time I ignored my phone and my daughter and ex wife barged in?”</p><p>Wanda stood, completely naked and hair mussed. “I’m going to shower. Join me after?”</p><p>Agatha gave a salute in acknowledgement, watching Wanda disappear into the bathroom and answering the phone. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Did you see the message in the patient portal from Nicky’s therapist?”</p><p>Therapy had been going well, Nicky had been seeing a doctor she really liked for a little less than a month now. The results spoke for themselves, she was less prone to lashing out, she fought Agatha less. Nicky was even able to be in the same room as Wanda and not insult her. Well, not insult her loud enough for Wanda to actually hear. It wasn’t a magical fix, but there was progress.</p><p>“Good morning to you too.”</p><p>“Morning.” Rio said, smiling. Agatha couldn’t see her, but she could still hear her ex wife’s smile crystal clear. That inflection, that tone.</p><p>“No, I didn’t.” Agatha let her free hand rest on her lower abdomen, brushing her scar. “Why, are we in trouble?” She grinned.</p><p>“We’re being asked to come in for her next session.” Rio said, “I think we’re being sent to the principal’s office.”</p><p>“What the fuck did we do?”</p><p>“Who knows, but I’m sure it’s all our fault.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Of course not, the parents are <i>never</i> to blame…”</p><p>“I don’t know, I think we kind of knocked it out of the park with Nicky.”</p><p>“She’s not fully formed yet.”</p><p>“She’s half you, she’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. If they were going by genetics, Nicky was not half Agatha. Nicky was half Rio and half an anonymous donor, but Rio never made it feel that way. And their daughter might be a spitting image of her ex wife, but Nicky’s personality? All Agatha. It’s not like biology was especially important to Agatha given that Lilia had no involvement in her creation, but she was still <i>her mom</i>. Just like Agatha was still Nicky’s mom and had the stretch marks to prove it.</p><p>“Where’s our child now?” Agatha asked, knowing it was Rio’s week.</p><p>“She went to Kamala’s house, they had a sleepover last night.”</p><p>So, their daughter was gone.</p><p>As was Wanda.</p><p>A horrendous, insane, and borderline creepy thought popped into her head. Her hand drifted further, fingers brushing the hair of her mons. Agatha was still worked up, and Rio’s voice was right here…</p><p>“So what did you do with your freedom?” Agatha quipped, pads of her fingers dipping lower.</p><p>“Uh, me and Alice went to a bar and had a few beers.”</p><p>“Mmmhhh.” She hummed, middle finger idly circling her clit. “Sounds riveting.”</p><p>“Oh, you have no clue.” Rio chuckled. “Afterwards, I came home and worked on my new LEGO set.”</p><p>“You animal.” She husked, running her middle and ring fingers through her slit collecting the wetness. “What set?”</p><p>God, is this what her life has become? Secretly jacking off to her ex wife’s voice, conversing about LEGOs just to get off?</p><p>“Five thousand piece Titanic.” Rio obliviously said. “The mast was a bitch.”</p><p>Mast.</p><p>A pole.</p><p>Long, hard, thick.</p><p>Fuck, yeah, this was pathetic.</p><p>She slowly sunk her digits into herself, picturing Rio’s instead. It didn’t mean anything, she was just trying to get herself off. Nothing more. It was better than cheating…right?</p><p>The shower was running, so she knew Wanda was occupied.</p><p>“W-why was it a bitch?” Agatha pumped her fingers. Finally, feeling close to full.</p><p>“It was in a billion tiny pieces, they could’ve made it in a way that just made more sense.”</p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut. “Hey, Rio?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“You remember when we took that cruise? I think Nicky was, like, three.”</p><p>Her ex wife laughed. “Fuck, and you got <i>so</i> sunburned.”</p><p>“Was bright red for a week.” She sped up her hand, canting her hips up.</p><p>“You pulled it off…especially in that bikini.”</p><p>“You kept calling me a MILF.”</p><p>“You were.” A beat of silence. “You <i>are</i>.”</p><p>Agatha curled her fingers, biting her lower lip not to moan. Her other hand clutching the phone like she was trying to strangle the damn thing. This was very morally gray, and for some reason, it only turned her on more.</p><p>“Thank god Jen and Alice went with us, I think they watched Nicky for a quarter of the trip just so we could–” She cut herself off. <i>So we could fuck like bunnies all over that fucking cruise ship.</i></p><p>“Yeah.” Rio agreed, her voice a little hoarse.</p><p>“Yeah.” She breathed out, adding a third finger and keening at the stretch. Her fingers were soaked, her legs were shaking. She was so <i>fucking</i> close. “Pretty sure I lost that bikini top in the Atlantic.”</p><p>“It was offending me.”</p><p>She curled her digits, hitting her g-spot over and over. “Rio.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Her stomach coiled, ready to snap.</p><p>She didn’t say anything, pretty certain her heavy breathing was taking up the conversation. She arched her back, her hand driving.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio’s tone went lethal. “What are <i>you</i> doing right now?”</p><p>“Bed.” She panted, “In bed.”</p><p>“Alone?”</p><p>“Mmmhh.” She confirmed, smothering another moan.</p><p>“And what are you doing…in bed….<i>alone</i>?” Rio knew, of course she fucking knew. She had spent fifteen years memorizing Agatha’s sounds.</p><p>“I- I’m resting.” She said, chest fluttering, breathing uneven.</p><p>“You’re a horrible liar when you’re about to come.”</p><p>“What are you insinuating?”</p><p>“You, my love, are touching yourself.” Her voice went gravelly, deep like it would when she <i>actually did</i> fuck Agatha. “Aren’t you?”</p><p>“You can’t prove that.”</p><p>“How many fingers?”</p><p>Eh, fuck it.</p><p>“Three.”</p><p>“<i>Shit</i>.” Rio whimpered, and Agatha could picture her ex perfectly. Probably in a tank top and boxer, still in her pjs. Maybe in her kitchen brewing coffee, or in bed reading. “What are you wearing?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>Rio must’ve felt physically pained by that, she hadn’t seen Agatha fully naked in years. Not since–</p><p>Well she preferred not to think about that right now.</p><p>It wasn’t that the scar made her insecure, Agatha was hot regardless. It was Rio plus the scar. She didn’t want Rio to look at or touch it, for what reason she couldn’t be sure, but her brain knew it was wrong.</p><p>Agatha was <i>dripping</i>, lewd sounds emitting into the room. “We- we shouldn’t do this.”</p><p>And it made it so much hotter.</p><p>“You started it.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah I did.”</p><p>“You wanna stop?”</p><p>“We <i>should</i> stop.”</p><p>“Not what I asked.” Rio went quiet for a moment before speaking again. “You pretending those fingers are mine?”</p><p>“Don’t ruin it.”</p><p>“C’mon, let me hear one moan.” She could picture Rio’s smirk. “You always sound so pretty.”</p><p>Involuntarily, a moan ripped from her throat. She threw her head back, neck vein popping. “<i>Rio</i>.”</p><p>“That’s it, angel.”</p><p>“Fuck, I gotta be quiet.”</p><p>“She nearby?”</p><p>“Shower.”</p><p>“Remember that time I fucked you in the shower at our old place? You were bent over, fucked out, gripping that bar…absolutely wrecked.”</p><p>“Yeah.” She nodded, reaching that edge, ready to fall.</p><p>“Pretty sure you took my whole fist, you were so <i>fucking</i> tight.”</p><p>She whimpered at the memory, wanting to relive it. “I still am.”</p><p>“Oh I know, querida.” Rio rasped. “You’re always so good, so perfect.”</p><p>“Say it again.”</p><p>“You’re so <i>good</i>.”</p><p>Agatha's body started to convulse. “Oh, fuck–”</p><p>“<i>My good girl</i>.”</p><p>Those words shouldn’t affect her anymore, they should mean zip. Because Agatha wasn’t hers, and Rio wasn’t Agatha’s. Not anymore. Not for years. She was dating someone else, she was having sex with someone else less than ten minutes ago. And yet—</p><p>Agatha dropped the phone, landing with a soft thud against her shoulder as she came. She shuddered as her walls clenched around her fingers, letting out a silent scream so as not to alert her girlfriend in the shower.</p><p>“Baby?” Rio’s voice faintly spoke, the phone languidly sliding into the crook of her neck.</p><p>What the fuck was Agatha doing?</p><p>She just used her ex wife to come.</p><p>And her ex wife was aware.</p><p>With her girlfriend in the fucking shower.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>She shot up, sliding her fingers out and–</p><p>Shit, they were drenched.</p><p>Dammit, shit, fucking bitch–</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio spoke again.</p><p>Agatha picked up the phone with the one not saturated in her own arousal, clearing her throat. “Sorry.”</p><p>“Sorry?” Rio echoed. “I’m not.”</p><p>“That was fucked up, to say the least.”</p><p>“But you feel better.”</p><p>It wasn’t a question. Rio already knew.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then there’s nothing to be sorry for.”</p><p>“No, I- I shouldn’t have done that to you. I’m not putting you on hold.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nothing.” Agatha sniffled, suddenly feeling very vulnerable. “Nothing, I should go.”</p><p>Rio didn’t even try to hide her disappointment. “Oh…okay.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“See you in therapy.”</p><p>Agatha almost laughed at the absurdity of it. “Yeah, see you in therapy.”</p><p>“Bye.”</p><p><i>Wish you were here.</i></p><p><i>Wish it had been you.</i></p><p><i>Wish it was you in that shower.</i></p><p>No. Absolutely not.</p><p>“Bye.”</p><p>Agatha hung up, throwing her phone like it had burned her skin.</p><p>“Babe?” Wanda called out. “You coming?”</p><p>Well, for the first time in a long time–</p><p>Agatha actually had.</p><hr/><p>Rio stared at her phone long after the screen had gone black. She stood in the kitchen, coffee machine beeping to signal her coffee was ready. But her brain didn’t register it, too focused on what the fuck had just happened with her ex wife.</p><p>Was it pathetic that Rio was really turned on right now?</p><p>How could she not be?</p><p>Was it wrong to go upstairs and furiously masturbate to the memory of that call?</p><p>Or was that desperate?</p><p>Agatha had sounded <i>so desperate</i>.</p><p>Which made her wonder what the everliving fuck Wanda was doing to her wife in bed. Yeah, Rio was already more than sure that Wanda couldn’t be what Agatha needed, but seriously? The sex was <i>that</i> bad?</p><p>Nicky wasn’t home…</p><p>Wouldn’t be for hours…</p><p>Eh, fuck it.</p><p>Rio bolted up the stairs, taking them two at a time and rushing into her room. She flung herself down, shoving her hand in her boxers. It was a better alternative to thinking about Agatha probably hopping in the shower with Wanda at this current moment.</p><p>Or whatever the fuck “I’m not keeping you on hold” meant.</p><p>No, instead she thought about that cruise and that bikini and how Agatha must’ve looked working her hand between her thighs. Rio bet she looked so fucking good, she was sure of it.</p><p>She thought about the sounds Agatha made, how Rio could tell she was close just from her breathing pattern. If Rio were there, the orgasm would’ve been better, more intense. Hell, she’d give her more than one.</p><p>And Rio wished she didn’t feel this fucking pathetic, didn’t feel this way about a woman who had no fucking interest in her. But then her mind reeled, replacing the guilt and the shame with Agatha. Agatha moaning and whining, whimpering and arching. Agatha’s face, her body.</p><p>Stupid fucking Wanda, she’s not worthy of seeing Agatha naked. That ginger obviously does not know what she’s doing, Agatha deserved better.</p><p>And then Agatha apologized after, like it was a bad thing.</p><p>Yes, Rio was taking scraps, but there wouldn’t be any scraps if Agatha was actually satisfied.</p><p>She gave that relationship two more months before Agatha got  too frustrated to pretend any longer. Rio could wait. She’d always wait for her wife.</p><p>Rio came in under three minutes, hand buried in her boxers, cursing a single name as she did so. “<i>Agatha.</i>”</p><p>The next day, Sunday, Rio and Nicky met Agatha at the therapist’s practice. Their daughter didn’t hug Agatha, but she did smile, so that was progress.</p><p>“Can I throw my bag in your car, mom?” NIcky asked, backpack slung over her shoulder. They figured since it was Sunday, Nicky would just go home with Agatha after the session.</p><p>Agatha handed her the keys. “Sure, hon.”</p><p>It was December and the parking lot was freezing, but that wouldn’t stop Rio. “How was your weekend?” She asked, grinning.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha said, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>“Get good <i>rest</i>?”</p><p>“Rio.” She warned.</p><p>“I know I did, I think I <i>rested</i> three times after our call.”</p><p>Her ex wife’s pupils dilated, her breath hitching. “Good for you.”</p><p>Sick freak, Agatha was definitely turned on.</p><p>“You know, when I find that <i>resting</i> by myself is easier than <i>resting</i> with another person, I tend to analyze why that might be.” Rio smirked. “Maybe it’s a sign.”</p><p>“And who the fuck have you <i>rested</i> with lately?” Agatha narrowed her gaze in disbelief.</p><p>No one, literally not a single soul.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t know that.</p><p>And this could speed up Ronald McDonald getting the fuck out of the way so Rio could have her wife back.</p><p>After all, Agatha had always been a pretty jealous spouse. Not that she needed to be, Rio never so much as looked at another woman while they were married. Honestly, she still hadn’t. She was <i>stuck</i>.</p><p>“No one serious.”</p><p>“You’re dating?”</p><p>“I don’t know if one night stands count as dating, but…”</p><p>Bald faced lie.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes quickly shifted from lust to rage, maybe envy. “Nicky hasn’t said anything.”</p><p>“I’m not going to tell my daughter when I’m getting laid.”</p><p>“Well…” Agatha crossed her arms, blue winter coat on her body. “Happy you’ve moved on.”</p><p>“Figured it’s time.” Rio’s smile was sickeningly sweet. “Time to find <i>my</i>  Wanda…since you two are <i>so</i> happy.”</p><p>“Fuck you.”</p><p>“Name a time and place, baby.”</p><p>Agatha took a step forward. “I’m going to choke you out, so help me god.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, their respective spaces vanishing until they were almost flush with one another. “Please do.”</p><p>Agatha's car a few rows away beeped, Nicky having locked it with the key fob. “Okay!” Nicky called over. “Let’s do this shit.”</p><p>Agatha sobered at their daughter’s voice, taking a step back. “Yeah.”</p><p>Rio nodded, ignoring the longing that had calcified in her chest years ago. “Yay. Therapy.”</p>

<p>Smoke from a candle is flammable, the steady stream containing vapors. If you blow out a candle, then apply a match to the smoke, it ignites again. Even if the flame does not touch the wick again, its immediate combustion. This unsuspecting thing, lying seemingly dormant, ignited and lit aflame once more.  The fire burning bright and steady.</p><p>That was her and Rio.</p><p>Agatha kept striking a match, holding it out as the smoke curled and coiled around, threatening to catch flame. And if that smoke succeeded?</p><p><i>Combustion.</i></p><p>So, it was actually a good thing that ten minutes prior she had discovered her ex wife was fucking other women. Because that’s what she wanted, to be free. Agatha was adamant that Rio needed to stop pursuing her, so Rio fucking random sluts was great. It was the best thing for their co-parenting relationship, for Nicky, for their family. She just prayed that Rio didn’t actually like one of the bimbos enough to bring her to the next family dinner. And if her ex wife got an STI, well, maybe that’s a lesson learned.</p><p>“Thank you for coming in today, I know it is the weekend.” The psychiatrist greeted, sitting across from the three of them in a chair. “It is nice to get a background of the family.” She said, a thick Russian accent saturating each word. “I am Dr. Melina Vostokoff, as you know.”</p><p>Now, Agatha was in a relationship, and Wanda was obviously gorgeous. But this woman? <i>Fuck</i>. Full lips, big brown eyes, high cheekbones, luscious head of hair. If Dr. Vostokoff were Agatha’s doctor; she'd never miss a therapy session. She was also her <i>daughter’s psychiatrist</i>, so there were many reasons not to do anything about how hot this woman was, but Agatha could appreciate beauty.</p><p>“I have already met you,” Dr. Vostokoff pointed to Rio who was on the opposite end of the couch from Agatha, Nicky wedged in the middle. “Briefly.”</p><p>Rio had dropped Nicky off at her first appointment, and Agatha idly wondered if her ex wife <i>also</i> thought Melina was attractive. Shit, maybe Rio could sleep with her too. Since apparently she was just pulling women left and right.</p><p>Her ex wife politely smiled. “Yeah, hi.”</p><p>“You are mami, correct?” The doctor asked, a note pad in her lap and glasses on her nose. “The doctor?”</p><p>“That’s me.”</p><p>“Excellent.” Melina then pointed to Agatha. “And you are mom?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips spread into a straight line. “Yup.”</p><p>“Great.” Melina took off her glasses, straightening her posture. “My goal here today is to learn more about you. Nicky has graciously agreed to share her time and I hope that we can have a productive conversation about what your daughter has been struggling with. I will ask questions and for the sake of progress, please answer honestly.”</p><p>“Got it.” Rio nodded.</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha chirped.</p><p>“Now, I have heard Nicky’s perspective, but what would you two say caused your divorce?” Milena tilted her head.</p><p>Okay, so this woman had the delicacy of a flamethrower.</p><p>“Fuck, you don’t beat around the bush.” Agatha gawked.</p><p>“I find it counterproductive to waste time.” The doctor responded. “So, the reason for the end of your marriage?”</p><p>Agatha blew out a breath, noncommittally waving around her hand. “Irreconcilable differences.”</p><p>“Rio?” Melina checked.</p><p>Her ex wife simply said “I’d agree with that.”</p><p>“Liars.” Their daughter muttered.</p><p>Agatha looked at her, the fucking narc.</p><p>Milena raised her eyebrows. “Nicky.”</p><p>“It’s not true.” Nicky said, crossing her arms. “They were fine until Alex.”</p><p>Wow, she really thought she’d get more time before their dead kid was brought up.</p><p>Obviously, Dr. Vostokoff had the context of who Alex was, because she then flitted her gaze between her and Rio. “Is your daughter correct? Was the loss of your child the cause?”</p><p>Neither of them spoke, which didn’t shock Agatha because Rio hadn’t even uttered Alex’s name afterwards, she never fucking talked about Alex. When the room became heavy with silence, Melina sighed. “It is not uncommon for a marriage to suffer after the death of a child. Grief often perpetrates isolation, fear, rage, loneliness. And if what Nicky has told me is true, which I have no reason to question, you two had…unusual circumstances working against you.”</p><p>“What has she told you?” Agatha crinkled her brows.</p><p>“You should ask your daughter, not me.” The doctor nodded towards Nicky.</p><p>She turned her body, looking at her daughter. “Teddy?”</p><p>Nicky uncrossed her arms, her hands resting in her lap as she began to pick at her nails. “Just what happened, like, after…”</p><p>Rio turned her body too. “It’s okay, you can tell us.”</p><p>Nicky let out a breath. “I just…I just talked about how things went once Alex was gone. The house was quieter and even the sunny days were dark. Mami was always working and mom couldn’t get out of bed for, like, two months. I think nona basically raised me for a while.” She swallowed, voice going taut. “I know I was little, but you guys treated me like I was oblivious. And all the adults kept whispering, like a kid can’t tell when something is wrong. I guess… everyone was talking <i>around</i> me, but not <i>to</i> me.” She looked at Melina, silently asking if she should say the rest.</p><p>“You are doing great, keep going.” The doctor instructed.</p><p>“I think that I resented you guys.” Nicky’s voice broke. “And I think I still kinda do. You both lost a kid and each other, you both lost two people. But I lost my parents <i>and</i> my sister, I lost three people and neither of you acknowledged that. How I would feel about it. All I was told was that Alex had gotten sick and her body stopped working, I didn’t know what that meant or where my sister was.” She wiped a tear running down her cheek. “And my parents were there, but they <i>weren’t</i>. Mami stopped playing music when she cooked, and mom didn’t do the voices in the bedtime stories anymore. Hell, she couldn’t even tuck me in for, like, a month after.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes burned, the tears in her eyes matching her ex wife’s as their gaze met one another’s as Nicky kept going.</p><p>“I know it was hard on you guys, I get that. But I wasn’t stupid, I knew when mami started sleeping on the couch. I knew when mom spent her days sobbing in bed.” Nicky sniffled. “I remember one day, nona had picked me up from school and when I got home, I ran upstairs to show mom this picture I had drawn. And when I walked in,” Her daughter looked at her. “You were just hunched over, crying until you noticed I was there. You smiled and pretended everything was fine, and I <i>knew</i> it wasn’t.”</p><p>Her breath unintentionally caught at Nicky remembering <i>that day</i>, because Agatha remembered it too, and it broke her heart that Nicky picked up on it.</p><p>“I love you guys,” Nicky said. “But I <i>need</i> you to be honest. You didn’t stop loving each other, and it wasn’t irreconcilable differences. It was Alex. You guys aren’t who you used to be. Mami’s hiding shit, mom doesn’t even speak to aunt Jen anymore. I feel like my family isn’t mine, like even the good memories are from a different life.”</p><p>Fuck, that’s heavy for a thirteen year old.</p><p>And she hadn’t even been aware her daughter was feeling this way.</p><p>Agatha’s chest ached, like a dagger was just plunged into it. She wiped the tears brimming, sniffling and nodding. And though it hurt like a bitch to hear, the kid that was here now needed her. “Okay, hon.” She murmured, reaching out to squeeze Nicky’s hand.</p><p>“Of course, mi vida.” Rio agreed, a gentle hand on their daughter’s back.</p><p>“That was excellent, Nicky.” Melina smiled. “Did it feel good?”</p><p>Their daughter grinned slightly, using the back of her free hand to dry her face. “Yeah, it did.”</p><p>“So,” Melina plucked a tissue from a box, handing it to Nicky. “I will ask you two again, what caused the end of your marriage?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled everything in her lungs. “Alex’s death.”</p><p>The doctor looked at Rio. “Would you agree?”</p><p>“I think there’s more to it, but if we’re trying to find the root cause, then yeah.” Her ex wife spoke.</p><p>Agatha whipped her head. “What <i>else</i> could it be?”</p><p>Rio looked at her, face scrunched. “You blamed me.”</p><p>"Who else was there to blame?!”</p><p>“No one! There was no one person at fault!”</p><p>Agatha chuckled at the absurdity of that claim. “We had a deal, you broke it. We could’ve had time with our <i>child</i>, but you chose to take that away from me!”</p><p>“She would’ve died when she did, or a few days later! She would’ve been born sick, lived sick, and died sick.” Rio shot back, rage lacing each word. “And you blamed me because you needed to blame <i>someone</i>.”</p><p>“You don’t know she would’ve died! You’re not god!” Agatha stood off the couch, floodgates opening. “You fucking let me down! You were a coward!”</p><p>Rio stood up too. “I didn’t apologize for knowing better and it pissed you off! Your body was recovering and you <i>hated</i> that I was the person to depend on. You <i>hated</i> that I couldn’t fix things. You hated <i>me</i>!”</p><p>“Yeah, I might feel a little resentful of my wife who was supposed to protect our kid! Instead, you fucking took her from me!” Agatha screamed. “And you kept saying how sorry you were for Alex dying, but you never apologized for being the one to make the call!”</p><p>“I’m not!” Rio yelled, throwing her arms up. “I’m not sorry! I’m not going to apologize for making the correct decision! <i>Medically</i>, I made the right choice.”</p><p>“Fuck you! You <i>weren’t</i> the one cut open, and you <i>weren’t</i> the one who spent months making another body from scratch!”</p><p>“Excuse me!” Melina shouted, eyes darting towards their daughter on the couch. “I do not think that this is productive for Nicky.”</p><p>Nicky was hunched over, face in her hands. Her body was shaking as she cried, refusing to look up.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped. “I’m sorry. I’m-” She softly spoke as she sat back down. “I’m <i>so</i>  sorry, teddy.”</p><p>Rio slumped next to their daughter. “I’m sorry, mija.”</p><p>Nicky didn’t say anything, just let her hands drop before shooting her arms around Rio and burying her head into Rio’s chest. Which made Agatha feel <i>fine</i> and <i>normal</i> and not at all gutted that her daughter didn’t seek comfort from her. No, that was reserved for Rio who had never done anything wrong <i>ever</i> in Nicky’s eyes. Agatha bit her lip, crossing her arms and tearing her focus away from her ex wife consoling their daughter.</p><p>“It’s okay.” Rio whispered, placing a kiss to the top of Nicky’s head. “It’s okay.”</p><p><i>Fuck her</i>.</p><p>Fuck Rio and her superior bond with Nicky.</p><p>Fuck Rio and the women she was sleeping with.</p><p>Fuck Rio and her non-apology.</p><p>Melina’s eyes zeroed in on Rio’s hand cradling Nicky’s head. “I was unaware you were remarried.”</p><p>Rio looked up from their daughter. “I’m not.”</p><p>“You have a wedding band on your left finger.” Dr. Vostokoff noted.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t say anything.</p><p>“It’s my ring from…” Her ex trailed off. “I just feel comfortable wearing it.”</p><p>“Interesting.” Melina said, tone neutral. “Agatha, how do you feel about Rio wearing her ring?”</p><p>“I think it’s fucked up given the situation.” Agatha nearly snarled. “I think it gives Nicky false hope. I think it guilt trips me. I think Rio does it to look even more like a martyr.”</p><p>Did Rio keep it on when she had sex with other women? Where had that ring even been?</p><p>“Martyr?” The doctor echoed.</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. “Everyone thinks that I’m in the wrong, that I’m the heinous bitch and Rio is the sad puppydog who was kicked out into the cold.”</p><p>“Are you referring to your daughter?”</p><p>Nicky looked up from Rio’s chest, brown eyes bloodshot.</p><p>Agatha weighed her options. She didn’t want to make her daughter feel worse, she didn’t want Nicky blaming herself. The word <i>Yes</i> was on the tip of her tongue, but she choked it back. “No.”</p><p>Melina squinted at her, pen scribbling. “We will say that, <i>for now</i>, your divorce was caused by the loss of your child.” She put her glasses back on. “How has the addition of a partner changed your family dynamic?”</p><p>God, another thing that would just circle back to Agatha?</p><p>“Um, not <i>positively</i>.” Agatha bit out, body rigid. “As I’m sure you can tell, neither my daughter nor ex care for my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Why do you think that is?”</p><p>“‘Cause she’s a bimbo.” Nicky muttered under her breath.</p><p>And she fucking <i>saw</i> Rio fight a smile, lips twitching.</p><p>Agatha scoffed, suddenly feeling like the punching bag in this session. “Because Nicky wants Rio and I back together.”</p><p>“Do you think that has something to do with you two relapsing into bed after break ups?” Melina inquired, surprisingly not judgmental in her questioning.</p><p>Agatha worked her jaw. “<i>Possibly</i>.”</p><p>“And why do you think that pattern occurs?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“What triggers it?”</p><p>Her daughter was in the fucking room for god’s sake, she couldn’t just say that she was in need of an orgasm and Rio was the most gratifying way to get one. She looked at Rio, who just looked back. Oh, so she just wasn’t going to be of any help?</p><p>Fanfuckingtastic.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Melina’s gaze trailed along all three of them, analyzing them. “Okay, here is what we will do.” She waved her pen around like an orchestra conductor. “I will continue to see Nicky every Wednesday and we will do family therapy on Sunday.”</p><p>“What?!” Agatha squawked.</p><p>“Wait-” Rio began.</p><p>“Additionally, I’d like to do a couple sessions with just the parents.” Dr. Vostokoff, ordered. “I recognize not everything is suitable for a child to hear.”</p><p>“You <i>think</i>, doc?” Agatha hissed.</p><p>“I do not usually focus on couples, more so the whole family unit.” Melina sighed. “But, to be frank, I think you need it.”</p><p>“How considerate and not at all patronizing.” Rio deadpanned, Nicky finally releasing her.</p><p>“I think it’d be good.” Nicky chirped.</p><p>“Hon, it won’t mean that we’re getting back together.” Agatha warned.</p><p>“God!” Nicky stood, grabbing her jacket. “And you just <i>love</i> reminding me of that!” She opened the door, storming out and slamming it behind her.</p><p>“The emotional impulses at her age are quite strong, it is not <i>always</i> a reflection of your parenting.” The doctor tried to comfort. “Emotions are big at that age, situations like this only amplify them.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped. “Sorry, what the fuck are we paying you for? As far as I can tell, I just spent the past thirty minutes being told how shitty I am!”</p><p>“Who said that, Agatha?” Melina calmly asked.</p><p>“It was implied!”</p><p>“Therapy is not a cure all. There is work you have to do.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck this. I’m finding my daughter and taking her home.” Agatha threw on her coat and rushed out the door, not even looking back to see if Rio was following. Honestly, she was probably hanging back to apologize for Agatha’s behavior.</p><p>The irony of Rio having the ability to apologize and just cherry picking when to do so.</p><p>Agatha stalked out of the building, scanning around for her daughter, finally finding her near Rio’s car. Nicky was pacing back and forth, clearly pissed.</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha said as she approached.</p><p>Nicky peered up, eyes filled with venom. “Living the dream.”</p><p>“Teddy, I didn’t mean to make it sound like I was rubbing salt in your wound.”</p><p>“Literally, all I did was agree, and you <i>had</i> to remind me that you still don’t want mami! Or our family back for that matter!”</p><p>“That’s not fair.” She shook her head. “I want us to be okay again, I came here today to try and be okay with you-”</p><p>“No, what’s not fair is you screaming at mami before she could even explain herself!”</p><p>And therapy was supposed to <i>help?</i></p><p>Also, Rio yelled too. Why was her thirteen year old only scolding her?</p><p>“I shouldn’t have raised my voice, you’re right.” Agatha deflated, sprawling out her arms. “But, Nicky, what do you want from me?”</p><p>“I want you to pretend you actually care! About me, and mami. <i>I want my family back!</i>”</p><p>“Baby, I care about you more than anything else in the universe. And I’ll always care about your mami.” Agatha gently told. “But you can’t punish me like this forever. You’re entitled to what you feel, but it’s unrealistic to blame me for everything. Your mami is an adult, she’s moving on. I’ll do therapy for the rest of my waking days if that's what you need, but I- I can’t just act like nothing happened. I promise you, we’d be worse off.”</p><p>Nicky shoved her hands in her coat pockets. “And you get to make that call? You get to decide everything for us? You decide when it’s time to move on? You decide when a stranger comes to family dinners and how I behave?”</p><p>“No-”</p><p>The crunch of the snow beneath Rio’s boots ceased as she reached the two of them. “Everything good?”</p><p>Nicky huffed. “I’m staying at mami’s tonight.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to rip out her own hair. “No, you’re not.”</p><p>“Yes, I am.”</p><p>“No, I told you, staying over there when you know it’s my week would not be a regular thing.”</p><p>“Another thing <i>you</i> decide!”</p><p>“It’s what the custody agreement decided.” Agatha raised her brows. “Take it up with Massachusetts family court.”</p><p>Nicky looked at Rio, pleading. “Mami, <i>please</i>.”</p><p>“When has that <i>ever</i> worked?” Rio narrowed her gaze. “It’s not my night, you’ll go with mom.”</p><p>“I don’t want to, I wanna stay with you.”</p><p>At what point does Agatha give in, admit she’s a terrible mom, and accept defeat? Perhaps she was just predisposed to be an awful parent, something in her genetic code that makes Harkness women miserable hags. Maybe the answer to that will be at the bottom of a bottle of wine later tonight, she wistfully thought.</p><p>“Mija, you have been with me the whole week and your mom misses you.”</p><p>“How? I’m sure she had that walking Cheeto to keep her company all week!”</p><p>“Okay!” Agatha shouted. “Enough! We’re going home, which is where you are legally bound to be for the next seven days. You’re angry, congratulations, so am I. You can be pissed at me all you want in your room at <i>my</i> house.”</p><p>“Seriously?!” Nicky yelled, searching for Rio to help.</p><p>Her ex wife shrugged. “Seriously.”</p><p>“So that’s it?!”</p><p>Agatha unlocked her car a few rows down. “No, it’s not. Get your ass in the car while we work out a schedule for therapy.”</p><p>“Neither of you even care how I feel!” Nicky stomped off, flipping them the bird as she did so. “Fucking fascists!”</p><p>“Inaccurate insult, hon!” Agatha called after.</p><p>Once the car door had been very <i>loudly</i> slammed shut and her daughter could no longer see them, Agatha crumpled, rubbing her temples. “When do things get better?”</p><p>“About 10 years from now when she realizes how much of a dick she’s being.” Rio chuckled, reaching out to place her hand on Agatha’s arm.</p><p>She flinched, pulling away. “Don’t…don’t touch me.”</p><p>Rio’s hand recoiled, her face morphing into hurt. “Sorry.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” She dismissed. “I just think we should stop.”</p><p>“Stop what?”</p><p>“This.” She motioned between the two of them. “Therapy might be a bitch, but one thing that has become <i>painfully</i> obvious is that we can’t do this back and forth. It’s too hard on Nicky, and it confuses her.” It also really confused Agatha. “I’m sorry for yesterday and I’m sorry for all the other times prior. I’m with Wanda, you’re seeing people. It’s- it’s not healthy.”</p><p>Her ex wife’s face went blank, devoid of emotion. “Got it.”</p><p>“Rio, I really am sorry.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio unlocked her own car. “Maybe just text me about the therapy schedule. I’ll see you next week.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Have a good night.” Her ex wife said, walking away. “Don’t forget, Nicky’s piano teacher moved her lesson from four to five on Tuesday.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio got into the car, starting it and backing out before it even had time to warm up in the Boston winter.</p><p>She groaned, rolling her shoulders. How the fuck was she in a worse place with both Nicky and Rio after less than an hour? Why the fuck was everything her fault? And they have the audacity to wonder why she might want a moment in her life with someone who didn’t see her as the cause of all of life’s problems.</p><p>Wanda didn’t do that. Wanda listened and was sweet and did make her feel bad. And why would Agatha discount that? So she can get off? It wasn’t worth the risk of doing more damage to the relationship with her daughter, the shambles she had left anyway.</p><p>And Rio was spending her free time in stranger’s beds, Agatha might as well be a drop in the fucking bucket. Rio was a big girl, she’d get over it. Shit, Agatha could fucking <i>feel</i> the hot flash starting boil beneath her skin, a lovely symptom of early onset menopause. Another <i>amazing</i> genetic predisposition that the Harkness women harbored. She ran a hand through her hair, slowly making her way to the car. She got in, put the key in the ignition, and put the heat on blast. For Nicky’s sake, not hers, she was ready to tear her jacket to shreds in t-minus two minutes.</p><p>Her daughter was looking out the window, fists rolled tight.</p><p>“Chinese sound good for dinner?”</p><p>Nicky scoffed. “Gross.”</p><p>“You love Chinese.”</p><p>“No, I don’t.”</p><p>Yes, she did.</p><p>“Fine, I think there’s a pizza in the freezer.”</p><p>“Not hungry.”</p><p>“You gotta eat.”</p><p>“I think I’d just throw it all up.”</p><p>“Well, try.”</p><p>“That’s rich coming from you.”</p><p>God, Agatha was going to regret asking this, but “What’s that mean?”</p><p>“Telling me to try when all you’ve done is give up.”</p><p>She switched the gearshift, shoving down the urge to bawl because her teenage daughter was being mean to her. “Chinese it is.”</p><p>Later that night, after dinner (which Nicky barely ate), Agatha got into bed. She was reading her book with a glass of wine in her hand when her phone rang on the nightstand. She reached over and picked it up, pressing the phone to her ear. “Hi, hon.”</p><p>“Hey.” Wanda greeted. “Rough day?”</p><p>“Why do you say that?”</p><p>“Something in your voice.”</p><p>“Therapy was…<i>a lot</i>.”</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>“Oh the usual, I’m a witch who’s responsible for the downfall of everyone's life.” Agatha bitterly joked, pushing her glasses to sit atop her head. “I think I’m failing at this.”</p><p>“At what?”</p><p>“Motherhood. My own daughter hates me.”</p><p>“She doesn’t hate you, babe.” Wanda said. “She just doesn’t know what you went through. And grief lingers. I remember when I lost my brother, I’d lash out on anyone who tried to help me. It’s temporary. And I know without a shred of doubt, you love that girl more than anything.”</p><p>Her lips curled upwards, the much needed praise going to her head quicker than the wine. “I really wanna believe you.”</p><p>“Agatha, trust me, the way you care about Nicky is one of your most attractive qualities.”</p><p>“Oh?” She smirked. “Go on, tell me more.”</p><p>“Your hair, for one-”</p><p>Agatha idly heard the sound of the fridge being pried open downstairs and the footsteps of her daughter walking upstairs. The final noise being the soft <i>click</i> of her bedroom door. Taking it as a win that Nicky was eating the leftover lo mein, even if she thought Agatha wouldn’t notice.</p><p>So she laid back, letting someone who loved her fawn over her. She let Wanda make her feel better. Agatha was done. She was putting the matches back in the drawer and letting the smoke dissipate. She was walking away altogether, leaving the candle to gather dust. She was leaving Rio behind and looking forward, onwards to a life where she wasn’t always the villain, where she didn’t have the weight of the fucking world on her shoulders.</p><p>And maybe that life was with a beautiful woman, one who was happy to ease her suffering. Maybe that life was with Wanda, and maybe it was good.</p><p>Either way–</p><p>Agatha was <i>finished</i> playing with fire.</p>

<p>Agatha was covered in various fluids, all courtesy of her infant daughter, gently swaying back and forth in the rocking chair. And while Agatha knew having a newborn wouldn’t be <i>easy</i>, she also didn’t consider that she’d feel like she was constantly fucking everything up. Nicky cried? Agatha ran through the list of every possible need she could fulfill. Nicky still cried? Agatha tried the soothing methods in the parenting books she had spent the last nine months memorizing. Nicky <i>still</i> fucking cried? Well, that's when Agatha would cry too.</p><p><b>November, 2012.</b></p><p>It didn’t help that Rio was at work for twelve to fifteen hours at a time. Her wife had taken off a month before going back to work, Agatha opted to just return to teaching after Christmas break. Not the ideal solution, but the public school system offered shit maternity leave and at least Rio’s paycheck would keep them afloat for a few months while Agatha stayed home. Yes, she recognized the privilege in her partner making enough to support the three of them, but being the primary caregiver was fucking exhausting.</p><p>Her mom came over often to help, Lilia was retired and would be watching Nicky most days when Agatha went back to work eventually. Agatha’s mom worked a boring corporate job for most of her life until one fateful day in 1980 where she took a chance on some brand new stock from an obscure tech company. The company? Apple. At twenty-two dollars a share, no less. Inflated for 2012, that’s sixty-one dollars a share. Needless to say, Lilia was comfortable. She then used her money to invest in more start-ups, weirdly finding the most success with a leggings company. Lilia had explained to Agatha that since she was loaded, she started fostering since she never had any kids of her own. Hence how she became gifted with Agatha’s presence in her life.</p><p>Or cursed with.</p><p>Lilia had gone home hours ago, making sure Agatha was fed before she did so. Her mom <i>loved</i> and <i>fawned</i> over Nicky constantly, but never let Agatha forget “You’ll always be <i>my</i> baby, tesoro mio.” Which she rolled her eyes at because she was a thirty year old woman, but let the sap make her lunch anyway.</p><p>Her head lolled back against the soft cushioning of the chair, keeping it swaying lest her daughter realize and get pissed enough to wail again. Nicky was a good baby, she was, but she was particular. She always needed to be in physical contact with someone, her bassinet was a personal offence to her for some reason. And Agatha was more than happy to let her daughter drift off to sleep in her arms, god knows Evanora let Agatha rot away in her crib until she had the ability to crawl or walk. She didn’t take for granted that she had her daughter safe, slumbering against her chest, the house quiet though an absolute mess.</p><p>After how hard pregnancy was, after her body struggled to do the one thing Agatha wanted it to do, she was grateful. However, that didn’t mean her tits weren’t aching from breastfeeding, or her stomach wasn’t rumbling because she hadn’t had anything to eat since her mom left. Or that Agatha’s hair was greasy and tied up because she didn’t have any energy to wash it, or that the t-shirt she currently wore didn’t have spit up, milk, and possibly pee on it.</p><p>She glanced over at the clock in their bedroom, they’d transition Nicky to the nursery in a few months, it was just after 9PM. Rio’s shift had started at five this morning, so she should be home any–</p><p>The front door creaked open downstairs, soft shuffling noises followed by the squeaking of the steps as her wife ascended the staircase. Rio appeared a minute later, the light from the hallway bleeding into the nearly dark room. Her wife had changed back into her street clothes, smiling as she locked her gaze onto Agatha and their daughter.</p><p>“There are my girls.” She whispered, delicately walking over so as not to wake Nicky.</p><p>“Hi.” Agatha said, voice laced with fatigue.</p><p>“Hi, mi amor.” Rio crouched down in front of the chair, giving Agatha a kiss before placing one on Nicky's head, greeting their daughter with “Hi, princesa.”</p><p>“How was work?” She asked, eyes heavy.</p><p>Rio noticed, of course she did. “It was fine. What about your day? When was the last time you slept? Or ate?”</p><p>“Uhhhh,” She tried to think back. “I don’t…honestly, the hours blur together.”</p><p>“Okay,” Her wife gently nodded. “How about I take Nicky and you lay down.”</p><p>“No, it’s–”</p><p>“You lay down, and when you wake up I’ll make you something to eat.” Rio’s hands covered her own where she was supporting Nicky’s body.</p><p>“You just got <i>done</i> taking care of babies for sixteen hours–”</p><p>“Yeah, and now I’m going to take care of my own.” Rio said, taking Nicky into her arms. “Plus, you” Rio looked down at their daughter, half asleep now. “are my favorite baby in the whole wide world.” Rio’s hand cradled the back of her head, thumb running along Nicky’s scalp. “Isn’t that right, mi vida?”</p><p>Agatha deflated in the chair. “I think I’ll nap here.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You’re gonna fuck up your neck and back.”</p><p>“At least it’d distract from how sore my tits are.”</p><p>“You use the nipple cream?”</p><p>“Oh, you mean the <i>one thing</i> that gives me any sort of relief?” She gasped in faux shock. “Gee, I hadn’t thought about that. You should be a doctor or something.”</p><p>Her wife simply blinked at her, a small grin playing at her lips.</p><p>“God.” Agatha sighed. “I’m tired.”</p><p>“So, sleep.”</p><p>“There’s laundry, and dishes–”</p><p>“I got it.” Rio stated, swaying her body in place to coax NIcky back into sleep. “I’ll sterilize your pump so you can stockpile some milk after you eat…and maybe shower.”</p><p>“I think she peed on me at some point but I don't know when.”</p><p>“Sleep, eat, pump, shower.” Her wife listed off. “Get some rest, baby. You deserve it.”</p><p>“What about you?”</p><p>“I was able to get a little sleep in the on-call room, I’m good.”</p><p>She stood, shuffling to their bed. Shit, she forgot to wash their sheets today. “I love you.”</p><p>Rio climbed in on the other side, situating Nicky on her chest. “I love you too.”</p><p>Agatha’s head hit the pillow, dead to the world the minute it happened. Unaware of how fucking exhausted she was until she woke up a few hours later, around midnight. Her eyes begged to close again, but her stomach growled and her breasts hurt in a way that let her know they would explode if she didn’t get the fucking milk out soon. Rio wasn’t there anymore, but by the grace of god, Nicky was sound asleep in her bassinet.</p><p>She cautiously rose, tiptoeing across the hardwood floor and out into the hall. The first thing she noted was the smell of something cooking, her wife was a fucking amazing chef and Agatha was ready to devour whatever the hell was being made with the ferocity of a lion consuming its prey. Agatha went downstairs, sleepily walking into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio had music lowly playing, standing at the oven. Agatha looked over to the sink, now free of dishes, the baby bottles cleaned and left to dry nearby. She sat at the island, her wife peeking behind her to look at Agatha. “Good morning, hermosa.”</p><p>Her face hung slack with sleep. “I do not feel gorgeous.”</p><p>“Too bad.” Rio pulled out a few bowls from the cabinet. “You look it.”</p><p>“Where’d you put my pump? I think I’m going to start leaking soon.”</p><p>“In the bathroom off the den,” Rio scooped some food into a bowl, sticking a fork in the macaroni and cheese she had made. She put it in front of Agatha before taking off. “I’ll grab it. You eat.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and picked up the fork, taking a bite. And Rio didn’t just make boxed mac n’ cheese, no, she had obviously made some sort of roux with different blends of cheeses and spices to then pour over the noodles. Fuck, the salt and carbs were just what she needed in this very pitiful moment.</p><p>Her wife returned, setting the pump down. “Good food?”</p><p>She nearly moaned. “So good, thank you baby.”</p><p>Rio got a bowl for herself before sitting next to her, watching as Agatha lifted her shirt and situated the pump on her breast, then let her shirt drop back down before shoveling more food into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha was peacefully eating whilst being milked like a cow when she felt her wife’s gaze, she turned her head, a muffled “What?” coming out through the pasta she was chewing.</p><p>“You’re a vision, you know that?”</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p>“I mean it! You’re kind of kicking ass at the mom gig.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, a light blush forming on her face. “Shut up.”</p><p>There was a soft sound from the baby monitor and they froze, waiting for a cry. After a beat, it seemed Nicky was just stirring for a second, the monitor going quiet again.</p><p>“Fuck, that was scary.” Agatha murmured.</p><p>“Getting her in that bassinet was like defusing a fucking bomb.”</p><p>“I’ll take it as a compliment that she clings to us, but damn, we’re living in terror from a two month old.”</p><p>Rio smiled, shrugging. “Just means she loves us.”</p><p>“I hope she never stops.”</p><p>“What? The clinging or the love.”</p><p>“Both. Either.”</p><p>“She won’t, she could never.”</p><hr/><p>So, therapy is a fucking scam.</p><p>Rio was striding down the halls of the hospital on Monday morning, replaying all of yesterday. Growing up, Rio’s family suppressed their emotions. Angry at someone? Keep that shit bottled up, it would go away eventually. So, therapy wasn’t really her schtick. Rio could appreciate it, she was glad her daughter felt comfortable participating. But that fucking doctor? Oh, Rio couldn’t fucking stand her. She had told Dr. Vostokoff as much after Agatha had left the room to chase after Nicky. Telling her how inappropriate she thought it was to rehash their divorce in front of their daughter. The therapist simply shrugged and told Rio that therapy wasn’t always easy.</p><p>Yeah, Rio had gotten that much from just one session. She appreciated that Nicky could voice her concerns, but everything else? Disaster. Rio also didn’t appreciate how everything was insinuated to be Agatha’s fault, sure Rio had gotten a little heated, but nobody was at fault. And Rio might despise Wanda, but she didn’t need to see her wife raked over the coals for it.</p><p>And possibly the worst atrocity to come out of therapy, Agatha cut Rio off. Rio supposed she should take it on the chin and agree, because it wasn’t healthy nor was it good for Nicky. But damnit it all to hell, Rio <i>really</i> enjoyed having sex with her wife. And though she was not confident Agatha would keep her word, Rio would respect it anyway. She’d always wait for Agatha, even to her own detriment, even to a fault.</p><p>She turned a corner, hands in the pockets of her white coat, ready to forget yesterday. The hospital was her happy place. Whatever was going on outside of it could be ignored, Rio could fix people when she couldn’t fix her life. A way to set down her baggage and do some good for other people. And maybe it was how draining yesterday was, but Rio needed to do some good. Her whole body was kind of achey, her hands clammy, and her stomach nauseous. A very probable physical manifestation of being denied the prospect of ever fucking Agatha again.</p><p>Holy shit–</p><p><i>What if</i> she never fucked Agatha again?</p><p>That was a reality Rio did not want to live in.</p><p>Okay, she had to stop thinking about that and focus on today. And today was a very good day, it was Billy’s surgery day. The boy had waited two months to come back and get this bone marrow transplant, the Kaplan’s health insurance fighting tooth and fucking nail not to cover it. Additionally, Billy’s parents both worked around the clock to pay off the astronomically high medical bills and commuted from New Jersey so that they could see Rio. The American healthcare system, what a gem that it was.</p><p>She ignored her body’s internal temperature burning her alive and plastered on a smile even though it wouldn’t be seen because of the mask sitting on her face. Due to Billy’s high amount of chemotherapy, his immune system was fragile, meaning everyone masked up. Rio had made a joke to Alice about masking up vs. already being ‘masc’d up’...Alice didn’t laugh.</p><p>Rio and Alice didn’t work together on <i>all</i> cases, but most. They had a good work flow, they trusted each other. Additionally, they’d also have a resident assisting today.</p><p>“Hey, little dude, how are we feeling?” Rio asked as she approached Billy’s bed in his room.</p><p>The boy was small, gray, and bald. Though, kids are much more optimistic than adults, so he smiled beneath his own mask and said. “Good.”</p><p>“That’s good.” She chirped back, shuffling over to introduce the resident next to her. “This is my friend, Dr. Belova. She’s going to be helping me today with your surgery.”</p><p>Yelena was a strong resident, competent and capable. Though her disposition with other staff and adults was blunt and frank, she became surprisingly gooey around kids. “Hi, Billy.” Yelena waved and pointed to the stuffed animal he was clutching against his chest. “That is a <i>very</i> cool dinosaur.”</p><p>He beamed, holding it up for her. “Rio gave him to me and she fixed his ear! He got surgery just like me!”</p><p>“You two have so much in common!” Yelena matched his excitement. “You must tell me his name.”</p><p>“Tommy.” He said very matter of factly.</p><p>“That is an excellent name.” Yelena tilted her head.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “We’re gonna let them prep you and then we’ll see you later, okay?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rebecca sat next to him, trying to sound polite though Rio couldn’t blame her for being exhausted. “Thanks, Dr. Vidal.”</p><p>“Anytime.”</p><p>As Rio left the room, she felt woozy, the world tilting on its axis. She stumbled, slumping against the wall in the hallway. Fuck, was she that pussy whipped? Was this withdrawal symptoms? Yelena tried to steady her, pulling down her own mask to speak. “Are you okay, Dr. Vidal? You don’t look so good.”</p><p>She pulled down her mask, a waterfall of spit in her mouth. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“You are sweating.” Yelena raised a hand and placed it on Rio’s forehead. “And you are burning up.”</p><p>“No, I- I’m-” She tried to swallow, but it had the opposite effect. She scrambled, sprinting to the nearest trashcan as her gut twisted mercilessly. She dropped her head, upchucking into the garbage as Yelena gave her back a pity pat.</p><p>“I think you are sick.”</p><p>“No, no I’m not.” Rio heaved out before vomiting again.</p><p>“Oh, so this is normal? You do this everyday?”</p><p>“I <i>can’t be</i> sick. Billy is long overdue for this fucking–” Her phone in the pocket of her scrub pants rang. Rio pulled it out, reading Agatha’s caller ID. She groaned, using her sleeve to wipe the excess saliva from her lips and answering it. “Yeah?”</p><p>“I just picked up Nicky from school.” Her ex wife informed, obviously on speaker phone in the car.</p><p>“Did she punch someone again?!”</p><p>“What the fuck?” Nicky’s voice carried.</p><p>“No,” Agatha breathed out. “She threw up during fourth period, she’s got the stomach flu. And if <i>she</i> has it, then…”</p><p>“Oh, fuck.” Rio whined, leaning against the wall and ripping off her mask. “Damnit.”</p><p>“Kamala also has it.” Nicky croaked.</p><p>The sleepover.</p><p>“Yeah, so.” Agatha spoke. “Just wanted to let you know since I thought you wouldn’t want to be patient zero in the PEDs wing.”</p><p>“Thanks, I uh–” She looked at Yelena. “I’m gonna have to go home.”</p><p>“You upchuck?” Agatha asked, a teasing lilt to her voice.</p><p>“...Yeah.”</p><p>“You cannot drive like this.” Yelena said. “Can you get a ride?”</p><p>“I’ll be fine. I can–”</p><p>Yelena snatched her phone. “Hello, Dr. Vidal’s ex wife, you need to come get her.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha said.</p><p>“She is vomiting everywhere and should not operate an elevator let alone a vehicle.”</p><p>“Yelena!” Rio scolded.</p><p>“I will walk her out front, I assume you know the location.”</p><p>“God.” Agatha sighed. “Yeah, gimme ten minutes.”</p><p>Yelena hung up the phone and gave it back to Rio. “Dr. Wu-Gulliver and I can handle Billy, go home.”</p><p>And Rio could’ve fought, but there was no point. She agreed and slowly made her way to go change out of her scrubs, Yelena escorting her out of building to wait out front for her fucking ex wife to pick her up. Besides not being there for Billy, having to get a ride from Agatha was easily the worst part of today. Rio didn’t want to see her, she had planned not to see her for another six days in order to give herself time to not seem so utterly pathetic. Because she’d always be there, ready and willing, letting Agatha drag her around at her leisure. And while the metaphorical leash <i>hurt</i>, Agatha snapping that tether altogether was akin to cracking Rio’s chest open.</p><hr/><p>Agatha pulled up to the curb, her ex wife and a blonde woman she had never met before standing out front. Rio looked like shit, pale and sweaty, glassy eyes. She unlocked the doors as Nicky climbed in the back, literally flinging herself over the center console.</p><p>She looked at her daughter. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“I need to lay down.” Nicky said, sprawling out.</p><p>“Oh, <i>suddenly</i>, you need to lay down?”</p><p>Nicky grinned big despite her appearance matching Rio’s. “Yup.”</p><p>Rio opened the door, gingerly sitting in the passenger seat. “You didn’t need to move for me, mija. I could’ve taken the back.”</p><p>“I don’t mind.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her shoulders back. “So, your place?”</p><p>Or would her ex wife rather be dropped off at a hypothetical girlfriend’s apartment so <i>that</i> woman could nurse Rio back to health?</p><p>Rio sniffled. “Yeah, that’s fine-”</p><p>“No.” Nicky quickly sat up. “Mami’s coming home with us, we can quarantine together.”</p><p>“Hon.” Agatha started, pulling away from the curb.</p><p>“Nicky.” Rio began at the same time.</p><p>And as soon as Agatha got onto the road, Nicky clutched her stomach. “Well, I don’t think I’m gonna make it another stop before I ralph again…”</p><p>“Mi vida, I beg of you, do not throw up in the car.” Rio groaned, holding back a gag. “If you do, then I will–”</p><p>“Nobody is puking in my car!” Agatha told. “Fine, we’ll go home and you can both spew your guts out there.”</p><p>“How are you not sick?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’m a teacher, I’m exposed to every strain of every germ in the greater Boston metropolitan area on a daily basis.”</p><p>“Or you’re in the incubation period.” Her ex muttered.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>She chose to ignore that, and Rio’s presence until they got home, ushering two very sickly Vidals into the townhouse. Rio immediately sprinted to the bathroom in the den while Nicky bolted upstairs for the bathroom up there. Honestly, it was better for them both to be in a place with three bathrooms as opposed to the loft where they had to share just one.</p><p>Agatha climbed the stairs, finding Nicky in the hall bathroom keeled over the toilet. She knelt down, collecting her daughter’s hair and rubbing her hand on her back. “Sorry about the Chinese, that lo mein cannot taste good right now.”</p><p>“I may never eat it again.” Nicky murmured before another wave hit.</p><p>Once her daughter was done, Agatha helped her up, guiding her to her bedroom. Nicky sunk into the bed, ripping off and curling into a ball. She kind of reminded Agatha of how she'd sleep when she was little, knees pulled up to her chest.</p><p>“You want me to put on Twilight?” She smiled, grabbing her daughter’s laptop.</p><p>“Of course, how else am I supposed to survive these conditions?”</p><p>The Twilight saga was Nicky’s comfort series whenever she got sick, having read the books long after they were popular. And if that’s because Agatha owned said books, well, that’s not important. She queued it up, setting the computer down on the bed. “I’ll go order some ginger ale and bring you a warm washcloth. I’ll try to find the flu meds.”</p><p>It was when she was almost across the threshold that she heard a small voice come from her daughter. “Mama, can you stay?”</p><p><i>Mama.</i></p><p>Agatha froze, she hadn’t gotten a ‘mama’ in <i>years</i>. She couldn’t even recall the last time Nicky called her that, definitely before the divorce. Part of it was that Nicky was growing up, another part being her daughter no longer wanting to call her something sappier than ‘mom’. She turned on her heel and kicked off her shoes, her heart kind of warm and fuzzy. She cautiously got into bed next to her daughter, assuming that she’d just sit there beside her. Surprisingly, Nicky rolled over, situating herself so that her head rested on Agatha’s chest and her arm was slung around her stomach.</p><p><i>Clinging to her</i>.</p><p><i>As a source of comfort</i>.</p><p>Was it because she was sick? Yeah, probably.</p><p>But Agatha was going to take the touch anyway.</p><p>She had her baby on her chest, seeking out affection from <i>her</i>.</p><p>Agatha grabbed the computer, placing it on her lap and pressing play. She had to act casual about this, if she made it a big deal, Nicky might take it back. Her daughter was like an aloof cat, Agatha couldn’t say she wanted the touch, she had to be cool. Agatha placed a kiss to the crown of her daughter’s head, resting her cheek there as the movie began.</p><p>A few minutes later Rio stumbled in, wrapped in a throw blanket from the couch, shivering. She looked at the two of them, a smile forming. “I’m gonna crash on the couch, I think any nutrients have left my body.”</p><p>Their daughter glanced up from the screen. “No, mami, c’mon. We’re watching Twilight.”</p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed. “The vampire movie?”</p><p>“The whole saga.” Agatha corrected.</p><p>Her ex wife shuffled over, flopping down on the other side of Nicky, curling against her. “Aren’t these Mormon propaganda?”</p><p>“Not if you watch it ironically.” Their daughter yawned.</p><p>So, that’s how they spent the rest of the morning into the afternoon. Agatha didn't think the three of them would ever do something like this again, waste a day with one another. But having her ex wife there wasn't terrible. As they moved on from movie to movie, the little jokes and comments became more and more common.</p><p>“Why does the blond one look like that?” Rio asked during New Moon.</p><p>“Who? Jasper?” Agatha peered over.</p><p>“Yeah. That guy.”</p><p>“Unsolved mystery.” Their daughter answered. “Dude looks constipated.”</p><p>The day morphed, Nicky’s bed becoming an island of tissues and meds, both her ex and daughter drifting in and out of sleep. After Eclipse, they all changed into pjs, Agatha loaning Rio some sweatpants and a Red Sox hoodie that Agatha still wore often even though it technically belonged to her ex.</p><p>It was about half way through Breaking Dawn when both Rio and Nicky had passed out, her daughter drooling on her chest the same way Rio was currently drooling on a pillow. The sun had set already and Agatha was eerily calm, letting herself close her eyes and doze off as before Bella gave birth. She was actually tired, but she also didn’t need to watch the labor and delivery scene.</p><p>Her eyes only opened at a loud noise from the laptop, she had turned over in her sleep, an arm slung over her waist. She roused, blinking a few times and peeking down at what she assumed was her daughter’s limb. Her face fell as she recognized the hand that was limp against her abdomen, as she recognized <i>that ring</i>.</p><p>She flipped over, too quickly, causing Rio next to her to wake up. Amber eyes came into focus, her ex wife pulling her arm back as though it would be sliced off for touching Agatha.</p><p>“Shit.” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha looked around but didn’t get up. “Where’s Nicky?”</p><p>Her ex paused the movie and slumped back against the pillow. “No clue.”</p><p>She should get up, she should put distance between them because right now they were mere inches apart. “I never ordered ginger ale.”</p><p>“Probably for the better, that shit is awful.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, looking over Rio’s shoulder at the clock. “I should probably make dinner. You know, soup or something…”</p><p>And Rio’s lips curled up. “Okay.”</p><p>Yet, Agatha still didn’t move.</p><p>They weren’t touching.</p><p>They weren’t doing anything but talking.</p><p>Nothing untoward was happening.</p><p>She scooted in, just fractionally, just to get comfortable.</p><p>Rio mirrored her and moved in too, their knees brushing one another.</p><p>“Did,” Rio swallowed. “Did you want me to head out?”</p><p>Her gaze naturally followed the slope of her ex wife’s nose, down to her cupid’s bow, stopping at her lips. Rio was sick, her breath could not be appealing now more than ever, but the day had been so good and nostalgia is an effective drug.</p><p>“No.” She responded, tilting her face and letting the tip of her nose graze Rio’s.</p><p>“I thought you wanted to stop.”</p><p>“We’re not doing anything.”</p><p>“This feels like <i>something</i>.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s hand fall back to her waist, just resting, not gripping. “So, we should find Nicky?” She offered as a way out for the both of them.</p><p>“If you think we should.”</p><p>They should, they definitely should.</p><p>“I-”</p><p>Agatha was cut off by a knock on the front door downstairs, pulling away like she was escaping a fugue state. She scrambled off <i>their daughter’s</i> bed for fucks sake, bolting away and down to the first floor. She ignored the phantom sensation of Rio’s fingers as she opened the door, a cold blast of December air hitting her body. Just as effective as ice water being dumped over her frayed nerves.</p><p>Her eyes landed on Wanda on her front step, holding up a case of ginger ale. “Figured you could use this.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Wh- Wanda, what?”</p><p>Her girlfriend brushed past her. “I got your text that Nicky was sick, so after work I stopped at the store.”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha had texted her <i>this morning</i>, having abandoned her phone after all three of them got back home. “That’s- that’s really sweet of you. You didn’t have to do that.”</p><p>“I wanted to.” Wanda smiled. “Plus, I need the brownie points.”</p><p>Her daughter turned a corner from the kitchen, a sleeve of Saltines in her hand as she was drowning in a Mass Gen hoodie. Her girlfriend looked at Nicky, giving a wave. “Hey Nic, feeling any better?”</p><p>Her daughter squinted her eyes, stopping mid chew to scowl before audibly <i>hissing</i> at the woman in their foyer.</p><p>“What the fuck?” Wanda murmured as Nicky kept on walking.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “It’s been a day.”</p><p>“Yeah–”</p><p>“Wanda?” Rio spoke, languidly coming down the stairs, wrapped up in that throw blanket again.</p><p>Her girlfriend looked at her ex wife then back to Agatha. “Rio’s here?”</p><p>“Well, Nicky got her sick and then she couldn’t drive herself home from the hospital, so I gave her a ride…” Agatha rambled. “It just made sense for them to be sick in the same place.”</p><p>Wanda cocked her head. “<i>Right</i>.”</p><p>“Believe me, I’ve been surrounded by vomit all day.” She quipped. “Hardly something I planned.”</p><p>Her girlfriend nodded, though clearly unconvinced. She held out the ginger ale. “Well, I’ll leave you guys to it.”</p><p>“Wanda–”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Wanda dismissed, leaving and closing the door behind her.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha set down the soda, grabbing a coat and her snow boots to follow. She didn’t miss the way her ex watched as she did so. She slammed the door behind her, doing a half jog to catch up to her girlfriend down the walkway. “Wanda.”</p><p>“I said it’s fine.” Wanda repeated as she stopped. “I just would’ve appreciated the heads up.”</p><p>“Hon, it was a last minute thing. I didn’t invite her, Nicky did.”</p><p>She chose not to point out that she also hadn’t invited Wanda either, probably wouldn’t help the situation.</p><p>“Agatha.” Her girlfriend blew out a breath. “Do you understand how I feel? I know how your daughter sees me, I know how your ex sees me. And I’ve been patient, I’ve brushed it off. But I need you to be honest with me.”</p><p>“I have been.” She lied, her breath visible beneath the street lamps.</p><p>“I see that way Rio looks at you.” Wanda bitterly chuckled. “Am I wasting my time here? Because…I thought we were really going somewhere. It’s been almost a year, I’m serious about you.”</p><p>“What? No. Wanda,” She took a step forward, curling her fingers around the hem of Wanda’s jacket. “I’m with you. My ex wife is…she’s always going to be in my life but I’m <i>with</i> you.”</p><p>“So you can honestly say that you don’t feel anything for her?” Wanda tilted her head.</p><p>And Agatha had to be smart here, because today was a glitch.</p><p><i>Today</i>, Nicky liked her. And <i>today</i> was nice. But tomorrow? Tomorrow she’d go back to being the reason why Rio lived on a different street. Tomorrow she’d go back to being the reason Nicky had her life scattered between two homes. Tomorrow she’d go back to being the reason why they weren’t a family anymore.</p><p>But Wanda was the same as she was yesterday, today, and how she’d be tomorrow. And Agatha needed that, the consistency. It’s not that she didn’t like Wanda, she just needed to redirect her focus onto her and away from Rio.</p><p>“I can honestly say, <i>I don’t want her</i>.” Agatha lied again. “I want you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t <i>want</i> to want Rio.</p><p>Agatha <i>wanted</i> to want Wanda.</p><p>“You mean that?”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>And she really hoped she would someday.</p><p>Her and Rio weren’t sustainable, not after everything. Agatha needed to get her shit together for the sake of her daughter and her relationship with Wanda. A clear boundary drawn with her ex. She needed Rio as a co-parent, not a back up whenever she felt like it. She needed Wanda as a partner, not someone to cry to when she felt sad.</p><p>Agatha leaned in. “I haven’t been fair to you, and I’ll be better about it. I should’ve told you Rio was here, but Wanda, I swear nothing happened.”</p><p>Which was true.</p><p>They hadn’t kissed.</p><p>There had been no adultery of any kind.</p><p>“Thank you.” Her girlfriend breathed out in relief. “I know I must sound insane-”</p><p>“It’s okay.” Agatha pulled her in, giving her a quick kiss.</p><p>Wanda wrapped her arms around Agatha’s shoulders, kissing her back. “Can I ask you something?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“What the fuck was the hissing about?”</p>

<p><b>December 31st, 2024</b></p><p>Agatha sat in the booth, giggling over her second vodka soda because tequila made her take off her clothes. It was New Years Eve and Nicky was with Rio, meaning she and a few friends from work went out for drinks. There was Maria, the principal and technically her boss. Sharon, old as dust but a good time after a few drinks. She’d been teaching English since Agatha started nearly twenty years ago. Add finally Kate, a literal fetus. The twenty-five year old had joined the staff last year and Agatha took pity on her, mostly because she was the only other lesbian on the teaching staff, but also because she was easy to bully into buying drinks.</p><p>After the divorce, Rio had kept most of their shared friends, including Alice and Jen. Not that Agatha had spoken to Jen in years, not since Alex. But nevertheless it forced her to socialize with new people. So, she made friends with her boss because Maria was kind of a bitch and Agatha could appreciate that. And with Sharon, who Agatha leeched off of for school supplies.</p><p>“I’m serious!” Kate laughed, flailing out her hands, clutching a beer bottle. “She said she was only on Tinder to find a third for her and her boyfriend!”</p><p>“Fuck, that is so depressing.” Maria murmured. “Thank god I’m married.”</p><p>“Not all of us are so lucky.” Agatha raised her brows. “Give my love to Nat but also fuck you both.”</p><p>“Agatha, you could pull so easily on Tinder!” Kate shook her. “There’s so many younger lesbians who want a mean MILF!”</p><p>“Gah!” She gagged. “I do not need some frat dyke thinking she’s god gift to my vagina when she can’t even rent a fucking car.”</p><p>“Where’s Sharon?” Maria peered around the bar.</p><p>Agatha knocked back the rest of her cocktail and pointed. “She’s over by the jukebox waiting to play ‘I Will Always Love You’ for the twentieth time tonight.” She started sliding out of the booth. “Anyone want anything while I’m up?”</p><p>Maria perked up. “Uh, yeah-”</p><p>“Great.” She turned around, pushing through the crowd of bodies packed into the bar. She was not a fan of holidays like these, forced to endure another human’s sweat and body heat, but it beat celebrating home alone. Her ex had offered to do something, all three of them, but booze and Rio did not mix.</p><p>Their arrangement had grown more frequent since her last relationship ended a few months ago. Agatha knew herself, and as soon as Nicky went to bed, she’d fucking maul her ex wife. And Rio would let her, and they’d end up breathless and shaking in bed. And Rio would know all the right things to do, all the right things to say. And there’d be this voice in her head, one that would say <i>I’ve missed this, I’ve missed you</i>.</p><p>No.</p><p>Not again.</p><p>So, she shoved past people, reaching the bar. Agatha was trying to flag down the bartender when she noticed the woman on the stool next to her. A redhead no less. The stranger was drinking alone, mindlessly tracing her finger around the rim of her glass, mouth in a straight line. Sad girl without anyone on New Years? Easy pickins.</p><p>The ginger was more feminine than Agatha usually went for, but acceptable enough for a one night stand.</p><p>She leaned over the bar, pulling her shirt down just a fraction to show more cleavage. Agatha planted her elbows on the lacquered wood, waiting a beat before jutting her elbow out <i>just</i> enough that–</p><p>The woman jolted out of whatever stupor she was in, realizing she’d been bumped into. Agatha gasped, reaching her hand out on the woman’s arm. “Oh, hon. I’m so sorry, I think someone shoved me.”</p><p>No one had shoved her.</p><p>The woman waved it off. “It’s fine, don’t worry about it.”</p><p>“Let me buy you a drink to say sorry-”</p><p>“No, that’s too much-”</p><p>“Nonsense, I want to.” Agatha smiled, angling her body. “Plus, you’re alone, somebody’s gotta buy a pretty girl a cocktail.”</p><p>“Oh, they do?” Green eyes looked at her, a tiny grin forming.</p><p>“I don’t make the rules.” She sighed. “I usually don’t follow them either, but I’ll make an exception for you.”</p><p>“I don’t think I’d make the best company tonight, but I’m flattered.”</p><p>“Oh?” She raised a singular eyebrow. “Why’s that?”</p><p>“I’m commiserating."</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>The redhead shrugged. “Uh, my brother’s death mostly.”</p><p>And, god help her, Agatha fucking laughed.</p><p>Audibly.</p><p>She covered her mouth with her hand. “Sorry, sorry. That’s- I’m sorry to hear that.”</p><p>Okay, so she’s not getting laid tonight.</p><p>The woman blinked, and for some reason, laughed back. “Don’t be.”</p><p>“Is it his anniversary today?”</p><p>“Ten years tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha looked down for a second, inexplicably offering something of herself back. “I get it. My daughter’s is coming up next month, so…I just- I get it.”</p><p>“I’m sorry-”</p><p>“Don’t apologize. I always hated hearing it.”</p><p>“Right! Like it’ll bring them back.”</p><p>“<i>Exactly</i>.”</p><p>They remained next to one another for a minute, neither of them speaking. The woman then smiled, holding out her hand. “I’m Wanda.”</p><p>Agatha licked her bottom lip. “I don’t shake hands.”</p><p>“Oh,” Her acrylic nails disappeared. “Sor-”</p><p>“You need to stop saying sorry, sweetheart.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head, a blush forming at the pet name. “Do I get your name?”</p><p>“Depends.”</p><p>“On?”</p><p>“You into women, Wanda?”</p><p>“You’re forward.”</p><p>“No, I’d just rather do more than shake your hand.”</p><p>The younger woman swallowed, maybe uncertain or taken off guard. “I am. Into women, that is.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled up, leaning in. “The name's Agatha,” Her hand dropped to Wanda’s knee, lightly teasing. “<i>Lovely</i> to finally meet you, dear.”</p><hr/><p>Rio stood in the bathroom, fixing her sweater, hoping it was bulky to swallow her whole. She tied her hair back and applied some concealer to the dark circles under her eyes. She was never one for makeup, but the wallowing and lack of sleep had caught up with her. Two weeks since the stomach flu debacle, since almost kissing her ex wife, and Rio was worse off.</p><p>Christmas had been fine, they were amicable for the day and Nicky’s sake. It also helped that Wanda wasn’t present. Therapy had continued, much to her dismay. There hadn’t been any big breakthroughs but Nicky hadn’t bolted out of any more sessions either. Rio bit her tongue most times, not wanting to fan the flames that had incinerated her family and marriage. It wasn’t worth the screaming. She could only defend the choices she made for so long before the fight turned futile.</p><p>Rio had spent last night, New Year’s Eve, at the loft with her daughter. It was Agatha’s night but her and Garfield had anniversary plans. Not that big of a deal, last week Nicky had to stay with Agatha for three nights despite it being Rio’s week. She had been pulling more overnight shifts, hence the lack of sleep.</p><p>Billy’s transplant rejected, which meant they needed to do another one. The only problem being how frail the boy was, his body growing sicker by the day. So, Rio stayed with him whenever she could. They played Connect4 or cards, she just couldn’t get him out of her brain. She didn’t know why, but he meant more than the average patient. She had been seeing for over five years, invested half a decade in him getting better. And it wouldn’t matter if it killed her, she’d fucking fix him.</p><p>It was New Year’s day, a Sunday, and since it was a holiday, they were free of family therapy for the now. However, Dr. Vostokoff still requested that they spend time together as a family. The hitch? Wanda would be at said family time, or well, dinner. Melina was adamant that Nicky needed to at least try and be civil, especially because Agatha swore that her marriage to Rio was <i>over</i>.</p><p>So-</p><p>Her six year old patient was deteriorating rapidly.</p><p>Her wife had chased after her girlfriend after they had almost kissed.</p><p>And now, Rio had to endure her wife’s girlfriend’s presence at family dinner.</p><p>She slammed the mirrored cabinet shut, her own reflection making her sick.</p><p>Rio didn’t recognize herself, not like this.</p><p>The concealer helped minimally, enough that she hoped Agatha wouldn’t comment about it.</p><p>She ran her hands along the knitted wool of her sweater, trying and miserably failing to get her shit together. Would everyone be able to tell Rio was having a mid-life crisis? Would her ex wife see her and stare in pity? Seeing Agatha was one thing, Rio could handle that. But add in that fucking Barbie? Kissing Agatha and calling her ‘babe’? Vile.</p><p>Well, that settled it, Rio’s getting drunk at this dinner.</p><p>She whipped out her phone, requesting an Uber ride when a knock came at the door. Rio closed the cabinet beneath the sink too, pulling her sweater one more time for good measure and grimacing at her reflection.</p><p>“Mami.” Her daughter said. “You’ve been in there forever, can we go?”</p><p>Rio opened the door. “Last time I checked, you don’t pay the water bill.”</p><p>“What were you doing in there?”</p><p>“Wallowing.” Rio deadpanned, her phone pinging. “Get your coat, our ride will be here in five.”</p><p>“Why are we getting a ride?”</p><p>“Because, mija,” Rio sighed. “I need alcohol to get through this dinner and I’m smart enough not to drink and drive.”</p><p>“That’s not fair, I don’t get to drink to endure <i>that</i> woman.”</p><p>She shrugged. “Should’ve been born sooner.”</p><p>Nicky’s brows furrowed. “You chose when I was born!”</p><p>Rio began to walk downstairs, grabbing her keys from the table in the hall. “Can’t hear you!”</p><p>Her and her daughter arrived at the townhouse twenty minutes later, letting themselves in. She heard the voices of Agatha and Wanda in the kitchen, but couldn’t make out what was being said. The place smelled good. Maybe Wanda was cooking? Oh fuck, Rio couldn’t like the food then.</p><p>“Hello?” Rio called out, taking off her jacket and shoes, their daughter doing the same.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha groaned, her voice perking up on a dime. “Hi!”</p><p>Her wife appeared a minute later, sweater and jeans on her frame, hair wild and long, but–</p><p>“How was New Year's?” Agatha asked, motherfucking glasses perched on the tip of her nose.</p><p>Nicky shrugged. “Watched the ball drop, made mami a Tinder.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha tilted her head.</p><p>Last night, Nicky had stolen Rio’s phone to make the account. She didn’t really care, it’s not like she’d use it. Her daughter’s reasoning was that it’d make Agatha jealous and then her wife would want to get back together. And she didn’t have the heart to tell Nicky that Agatha clearly wanted nothing to do with her, so she let it happen. There had been one moment where Nicky almost clicked on the file in her photo gallery labeled <i>A</i>, which led Rio to smacking the phone out of Nicky’s hand.</p><p>She didn’t need to traumatize her daughter with half or fully naked photos of her mom…or their past sex tapes.</p><p>“The dating app.” Nicky explained. “I figured if I have to deal with la diabla on a regular basis, might as well give her a little competition.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze slid over to Rio. “You good?”</p><p>Oh, her mouth was wide open and there was drool pooling at the corners. Yet, of all the things she could’ve said, she went with “Glasses.”</p><p>Her wife self consciously pushed up the frames. “Oh yeah, got them a few days ago. All the letters on my computer look like squiggles now. I’m getting old.”</p><p>“I-” Rio cleared her throat. “I like them.”</p><p>“Thanks, I think Wanda hates them. Says between the glasses and my hair she can barely see my face.”</p><p>She’d strangle the bitch.</p><p>“No, I think they actually compliment your bone structure really well.” Rio said, trying to remain platonic about the thoughts swirling in her brain with those glasses.</p><p>“Well-”</p><p>“Rio!” Lilia’s voice boomed, the woman striding down the hall. “There’s my favorite daughter-in-law!”</p><p>Rio saw how Agatha visibly tensed at those words, her hands curled up in her sleeves.</p><p>“Hey, Lil-”</p><p>Her mother-in-law grabbed her arm. “Put your shoes back on and come with me.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Lilia leaned in, whispering low enough so no one else could hear. “I have weed.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her boots, looking between her wife and daughter. “We’ll be back.”</p><p>They stood on the back deck, right in the corner where they couldn’t be seen, passing the joint back and forth. It was cold as shit, but Rio didn’t turn down free weed, especially right now. Lilia passed the joint back to her, exhaling a hit.</p><p>“There’s something there.”</p><p>Rio perched it between her lips, curiously looking over. “Something where?”</p><p>“Wanda.” Lilia peeked over her shoulder, making sure the coast was clear. “There is something about her that just…<i>bugs</i> me. And you know me, I-”</p><p>“Have a sense about these things.” Rio blew out the smoke, immediately taking another hit. Lilia had a tendency to be slightly ‘woo-woo’ about things. Claiming when people had bad energy or not trusting their auras. “What’s wrong with her?” Other than the fact that she was the reason she couldn’t have her wife or family back, other than her being the one obstacle keeping Rio from being happy again.</p><p>“I can’t explain it.” Lilia took the joint back. “Don’t hog it!” She inhaled, speaking as she let it absorb into her lungs. “It’s just a feeling. I had one about you too.”</p><p>“You didn’t like me?”</p><p>“No, dear. You were a <i>good</i> feeling. Her?” Lilia shook her head. “I know my daughter, Wanda is not what she needs.”</p><p>“What does Agatha need?” Rio chirped, silently hoping for a specific answer.</p><p>“Right now?” Lilia cocked her head. “To <i>heal</i>. She hasn’t done that,” Her mother-in-law raked her gaze over Rio’s form. “Neither have you.”</p><p>“Kinda hard to heal when everything hurts.”</p><p>“Aw,” Lilia’s free hand cupped Rio’s face. “Bambina. You’re doing great despite it all.”</p><p>“Agatha hates me, I think.”</p><p>The older woman huffed out an incredulous laugh. “She still looks at you how she did the day she first brought you over. That ain’t hate.”</p><p>“Feels like it.”</p><p>Lilia took one last hit, passing the rest over. “That’s a gift for you, I’m going to make sure Agatha doesn’t need help. I love her but I’m scared of a kitchen fire.”</p><p>“Wait, Agatha’s cooking?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Lilia walked over to the sliding glass door. “Said it was a special occasion. Must want to make something nice for the girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio stuck the joint between her lips, inhaling as much as possible. Why the fuck does Wanda get a special dinner?</p><p>Once the joint was smoked down to the end, Rio flicked it off the side of the deck. Catching a glimpse of what <i>used</i> to be her garden. Now just a sad patch of dirt, sleet and snow melting atop of it.</p><p>How fitting.</p><p>She shuffled back inside, immediately sitting at the table. Rio sat in silence by herself for several minutes, her mouth becoming more dry, her anxiety simply floating away. Shit, Lilia had <i>good</i> weed.</p><p>Her stomach growled, everyone else funneling into the dining room. She kept her head low, not wanting to give away that she was absolutely <i>stoned</i>. For family dinner. On New Years day.</p><p>Nicky sat to the side of her and Lilia at the end of the table, there was an empty seat and then Wanda across from Rio. Meaning, once Agatha sat down at the head of the table, she’d be in between her ex wife and her girlfriend.</p><p>Rio giggled to herself about it, about the woman she loved being with someone else. At a certain point, she had to admit how comical her situation was. Wanda, a woman ten years younger than her. Wanda, the complete opposite of who Rio was as a person. Wanda, a fucking fem marketing exec who probably couldn’t make Agatha come for shit.</p><p>“Mami?” Nicky whispered. “You good?”</p><p>Rio wiped away a stray tear, her laughing came out harder now. “I’m- I’m great. Where’s dinner? I’m fucking starving.”</p><p>“Don’t get your hopes up too high, it is Agatha after all.” Wanda quipped, raising her brows.</p><p>Rio stopped laughing, tucking her tongue against her cheek. What the fuck was that supposed to mean?</p><p>“And before I forget,” Wanda stood, picking up a small giftbag from where it sat next to her purse on the entryway table. “Merry Christmas, Nic.” She extended her arm out, handing the bag to Nicky.</p><p>Her daughter’s face contorted in confusion, cautiously taking the gift. “...Thank you?”</p><p>“Hopefully you like it, I know all the girls your age go crazy for these.” Wanda brightly smiled.</p><p>Nicky pulled out the tissue paper, revealing the object at the bottom of the bag. Her daughter swallowed, her eyes widening in horror though her mouth tried to smile. “Wow.” She said in false joy, plucking the item out. “T- thanks.”</p><p>Rio stared at the demon baby in her daughter’s hand. “What the fuck it that?”</p><p>“It’s–” Nicky started.</p><p>“It’s a labubu.” Wanda finished. “It’s the next hottest thing, all the young people want them.”</p><p>Nicky looked pained to be holding the damn thing, but politely nodded. “It’s very…it’s <i>something</i>.”</p><p>“I’m so happy you like it! It’s so hard getting one of those.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio asked, because it was a fucking keychain, was it not?</p><p>Wanda chuckled. “It’s like $70 and there’s these drops and scarcity marketing–”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha walked in, serving plate in hand. She sat it down in the center of the table, the sides all scattered around it. “It’s a rosemary roast chicken, and if it sucks, don’t tell me.”</p><p>“You made roast chicken?” Lilia gawked.</p><p>“I did.” Agatha proudly told, pushing her glasses to sit atop her head. “Happy New Years.” She picked up the carving knife, leaning over to cut into it.</p><p>Rio watched and couldn’t fucking handle it, Wanda was just sitting and sipping her wine. Not even going to offer to help? Jesus fucking Christ. Rio stood, “Here, I can carve. You cooked.”</p><p>Agatha relinquished the knife and sat down, letting Rio cut the damn thing since Wanda wasn’t going to. It was just a courtesy to offer to help after your partner cooked a meal, was it not? Once everyone had some chicken on their plate, and passed around the sides, Rio took her seat again.</p><p>She tucked into her food, pretty fucking good considering it was Agatha’s first attempt. It might’ve been a little-</p><p>Wanda coughed lightly, reaching to sip her wine. “Chicken’s a little dry, babe.”</p><p>Agatha’s face fell, more than a comment like that should’ve caused. “Oh, sorry-”</p><p>“I think it’s delicious.” Nicky harshly stabbed a piece of chicken with her fork for emphasis. “Great job, mom.”</p><p>Then Agatha looked confused, the compliment bewildering her. “Thanks, teddy.”</p><p>Rio was more than happy to shovel a bite into her mouth, adding “Fucking scrumptious if you ask me.”</p><p>Her ex wife stared at her, like <i>really</i> stared at her. She whispered “Are you fucking high right now?”</p><p>She swallowed, whispering back “It’s fine, Nicky doesn’t know.”</p><p>“Yes, I do.” Nicky spoke, eating her meal without complaint.</p><p>“Don’t do drugs, mi vida.” Rio said, looking back to Wanda and bearing her teeth like a rabid dog ready to pounce. Serves her right for telling Rio’s wife the chicken was dry, it was Agatha’s first try, she should be supported.</p><p>Nicky giggled, mimicking Rio’s actions and bearing her own teeth.</p><p>Wanda sighed, clutching her wine glass tighter. “Yeah, that makes sense.”</p><p>Lilia at the end of the table was in her own world, just as stoned, yet unaware of the dynamics at play. So, innocently she asked “How was everyone’s New Year’s Eve?”</p><p>Wanda sat up straight, grinning. “As a matter of fact-”</p><p>“Fun.” Agatha interrupted. “Dinner, drinks. Fun.”</p><p>The ginger worked her jaw for a moment in obvious annoyance. “You wanna tell them what happened at dinner?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip in frustration. “No, because we agreed to wait-”</p><p>“I proposed and Agatha said yes!” Wanda interjected, grabbing Agatha’s left hand and forcing it up for everyone at the table to see. “We went to my brother’s grave this morning to show him, and I thought we should show you guys too.”</p><p>Agatha snapped her arm back, hiding her hand in her lap. “I said to give me some time.”</p><p>“Well, what’s it matter if it’s now or a month from now?”</p><p>And Rio was feeling a lot of emotions at her wife agreeing to marry another woman. Heartbreak, sorrow, grief, fear, rage, pain-</p><p>“What the <i>fuck?!</i>” Nicky screamed, standing. “You’re marrying this fucking Teletubby?”</p><p>“Okay, slow down.” Agatha said, raising her hand. “Nothing is happening right away, I promise.”</p><p>Nicky picked up the carving knife from the serving plate, slamming it down into the demon baby’s body and stabbing the damn thing in defiance. The knife stuck up from where it was wedged into the wood of the table through the labubu.</p><p>“Fuck you!” Their daughter pointed at Wanda. “And fuck your gift! You don’t even know me well enough to give me shit. You’re just a stranger who’s the reason my family’s broken.”</p><p><i>Broken</i> was a strong word.</p><p>Rio reached out, gently tugging her daughter to sit back down. “Mija, take a beat.”</p><p>Nicky huffed, but slumped back into her chair, crossing her arms.</p><p>Agatha got up, clearly holding back tears. “I’m going to get wine.”</p><p>“There’s already a bottle-” Wanda said.</p><p>“I’m getting <i>more</i> wine.” Her wife snapped, stomping off and into the kitchen out of sight.</p><p>Rio threw her napkin down, speaking to Wanda before following after Agatha. “That was <i>really</i> shitty of you. Just so you know.”</p><p>Lilia was comforting Nicky so Rio left the room knowing her daughter was being cared for, she found Agatha bracing her hands against the counter, back turned to her. Rio walked in, clearing her throat.</p><p>“Wanda, I don’t want to talk right now.”</p><p>“Not Wanda.” Rio said, slowly approaching Agatha. She couldn’t really comfort her how she <i>wanted to</i>, her high brain telling her that letting her fingertips twirl the ends of Agatha’s hair was platonic enough.</p><p>Her wife’s head tipped back, a soft <i>moan</i> drifting out into open air.</p><p>Rio sucked her lower lip into her mouth, waiting as Agatha turned around.</p><p>“Let me see it.” Rio quietly demanded, holding eye contact.</p><p>Agatha held up a shaky hand, the ginormous diamond reflecting light. Rio grabbed her palm, bringing it closer. Oval stone with a silver band? This ring said <i>Wanda</i>, not <i>Agatha</i>. “Ugly fucking ring…”</p><p>Her wife didn’t say anything in return, taking her hand back and crossing her arms. “It probably cost a small fortune.”</p><p>“Are you <i>happy?</i>”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her, her head stayed down. “Yeah.”</p><p>Rio’s vision blurred, the tears forming without her knowledge or consent. Because somewhere in the deep recesses of her mind, Rio thought all of this was temporary. She had convinced herself that Agatha just needed time. That the divorce was some elaborate punishment. That, one day, Agatha would wake up and let Rio come home. She’d let Rio be her wife again. She’d let Rio be a family with her and Nicky again.</p><p>The tears fell as she realized just how much of a fool she really was.</p><p>How could one person be so fucking stupid?</p><p>Rio would wait forever.</p><p>And as she stayed rooted in place, her wife ran from her.</p><p>Her <i>ex</i> wife.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio’s voice broke, wrapping the pads of her fingers around the thin piece of metal on her own left hand. She pulled it free, her hand bare. Rio peered down at the gold band, a few scratches and knicks from the eighteen years of use. She grabbed Agatha’s palm again, dropping it there. “Then I concede."</p><p>“What?” Agatha’s eyes clouded, her own tears forming.</p><p>“You’ve made it clear you want me to stop pursuing you. You want something else, someone who couldn’t be further from me. So,” Rio’s throat went tight as she motioned to the ring. “Sell it, throw it out. I- I can’t do this. I’ve given it almost two decades and everything I have in me. I love you, and I can’t do this to myself. I can’t do it to our daughter. It’s over and I’ll have to be okay with that in time. I’ve got to let you go.”</p><p>“Rio, you’re stoned, I don’t want you doing something you’ll regret.”</p><p>“I won’t.” She sniffled, taking a step back. “I’ve never regretted anything about you, baby.” Rio turned around, wiping her face as she trudged through the home she had built herself. The one for her wife and daughter. The home that had their love cemented in every corner.</p><p>And she had to get the fuck out.</p><p>Rio pulled out her phone, storming back into the dining room. “Nicky, go say bye to mom, we’re going home.”</p><p>Their daughter nodded, slinking out and heading for the kitchen.</p><p>Rio ordered the car, tucking her phone away. “Lilia, good seeing you. Thanks for the joint.”</p><p>“Anytime, hon.” Lilia winked, trying to make light of what felt like a tragedy.</p><p>“Wanda,” Rio began, finding nothing nice to say. “Night.”</p><p>She collected her daughter, it was the official start of her week after all, and swiftly left that den of horrors. They waited together in the cold for a minute as the car pulled up.</p><p>“I can’t believe she’s marrying her.” Nicky sniffled.</p><p>Rio blinked back another wave of saltwater burning her eyes.</p><p>“Yeah. <i>Me either</i>.”</p>

<p>Agatha stood behind Nicky’s highchair, collecting the strands of her daughter’s hair. Her wife sat in front of their infant daughter, making Nicky giggle, keeping her distracted while Agatha tied a green elastic around half her locks. Their daughter reached out a chubby hand, a cheerio hanging on for dear life as it was smushed up against Rio’s lips.</p><p>Her wife happily took it, swiping her tongue out to collect it. “Thank you for sharing, mi vida!”</p><p><b>August, 2013.</b></p><p>Agatha smiled to herself as she combed up the other half of Nicky’s hair, it was thin but there was so much of it for an 11 month old. She quickly took a purple elastic and secured the other pigtail, not caring about the mismatching of colors because at least her daughter’s mane wouldn’t be in her face.</p><p>It was the morning, on a Sunday, and they were lazily going about their routine. Rio was dressed in some boxers and a tank top while Agatha had on some shorts and a big sleep shirt. School didn’t start up again for a couple more weeks and Rio had the day off, so they made plans to go to the park.</p><p>“Ma-mi.” Rio slowly spoke. “Princesa, puedes decir mami?”</p><p>Nicky made sounds and syllables, but had yet to say her first word. Rio was hellbent on it being ‘mami’ while Agatha just wanted to hear anything at all. Although, it would be fun to rub it in her wife’s face that she got a ‘mama’.</p><p>Their daughter belly laughed again, mumbling gibberish.</p><p>Rio slumped, a pout forming on her lips. “Por favor?”</p><p>No dice.</p><p>“She’ll talk when she’s ready.” Agatha snorted, rounding the chair and picking Nicky up. “And when she does, I’m hoping it’ll be something vulgar. Maybe fuck, or shit.”</p><p>Rio covered Nicky’s ears. “Baby…”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “I’m getting her and myself dressed, then the park?”</p><p>“I’ll clean up this-” Rio motioned to the cheerios Nicky had flung onto the floor. “Massacre.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her wife’s cheek, then looked at her daughter. “Let’s go, hon.”</p><p>“No teaching her naughty words!”</p><p>“Of course not!” Agatha smirked, walking away with Nicky bouncing in her arms. “Can you say puta for mama?”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>An hour later they were dressed and sprawled out on a blanket in the park. Agatha had her hands clasped around her daughter’s as she took a few goofy steps, then fell. She’d smile and say “Good job!” before picking Nicky up again and starting the process all over. There were toys scattered about, Rio keeping her engaged without overstimulating her. Her wife was kind of a nerd about Nicky’s development, tracking every milestone. Agatha, on the other hand, was more relaxed. She knew that Nicky would walk or talk when she was <i>ready</i>.</p><p>It was around noon when the storm clouds started to roll in, her wife picking up any garbage and running it to the trash. Agatha waited near a bench, softly lulling her daughter to sleep, hoping she’d nap in the car. She was blissfully unaware of the <i>actual</i> storm making its way over.</p><p>Nicky’s cheek was pressed against her shoulder, eyes heavy, when a voice came from behind her.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p><i>That fucking voice</i>.</p><p>Her chest as well as the hold she had on her daughter tightened, her pulse spiking. Agatha’s body went static, not even realizing she was turning around until she was faced with her mother. Not her mom, her <i>mother</i>.</p><p>The warm wind picked up, humid as it whistled through the leaves of the trees. Any sunlight now clouded over, leaving her vision dull and gray.</p><p>“I didn’t realize you still lived in Boston.” Evanora smiled, but it was a false sense of security. Agatha knew that much, remembered that much.</p><p>She tried to find her voice but it eluded her, her hands beginning to shake out of instinct. Her lungs struggled for air, every inch of her light up. Agatha’s stomach dropped as she took in her mother. Her hair was long, stringy, and gray with age. Her skin withered from chain smoking, frame thin and frail.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened but no sound came out, her head seemingly pushed underwater so no one could hear her scream. Nicky was ignorant to Agatha’s tensing body language, thank god.</p><p>Evanora’s gaze shifted to Nicky-</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>A hand reached out, intending to touch her daughter. “And who’s this?”</p><p>Agatha took a step back, her body might not defend its own self, but it had the instinct to protect her child. She swallowed, and still, couldn’t form a fucking word.</p><p>“Is she yours?”</p><p>Agatha could make out foot steps approaching behind her.</p><p>“Looks…<i>ethnic</i>.” Evanora’s face scrunched in disgust. “Is your husband ethnic?”</p><p>Rio must've heard because she was next to Agatha in a second. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Evanora didn’t seem deterred, still watching Agatha. “Where <i>is</i> this husband of yours?”</p><p>Rio, clearly pissed, took a step forward. “I’m her fucking husband, who the hell are you?”</p><p>Her mouth’s lips turned twisted into a cruel smirk. “That’s no way to speak to your mother-in-law.”</p><p>Her wife cocked her head, understanding washing over her features. “Last time I checked, my mother-in-law is a kooky Sicilian lady who makes a mean baked ziti and spends too much money on crystals.”</p><p>Evanora looked past, or rather, through Rio. “Do you need permission from this raging <i>bull dyke</i> to speak, or can you do that yourself?”</p><p>Rio curled her hands into fists at her side. “Hey! I’m about two seconds away from committing assault if you don’t get the <i>fuck</i> away from my wife and child.” She took another step forward, nearly crowding her mother. “And I’d get away with it too because the sheriff is close personal friend, took out his daughter’s tonsils last year. I’m an upstanding member of this community and you have a record. How do you think a judge will take you harassing the daughter you lost custody of?”</p><p>The sheriff was not a close personal friend and Rio loathed cops, but Evanora didn’t know that.</p><p>A rain droplet splattered to the ground below them, Evanora looking between the two of them. She didn’t look particularly intimidated, but said nothing else. Rio turned around, grabbing Agatha’s waist and leading her away. Her breathing was labored, her eyes brimming with tears. Why the fuck hadn’t she said anything? She’d dreamt of that moment, of facing her again. Telling her exactly what she thought of her and maybe inflicting a <i>fraction</i> of the pain Evanora had on her.</p><p><i>A broken wrist when she was seven</i>.</p><p>One that never healed right because Evanora refused to take her to the hospital.</p><p><i>Too many bruises to count</i>.</p><p>Ones that Agatha had to learn how to cover up from a young age.</p><p><i>A dislocated jaw when she was fourteen</i>.</p><p>The first injury of many that made Agatha scream so loudly, the neighbors called the cops.</p><p><i>Two cracked ribs as officers barged into the apartment</i>.</p><p>The way they ached as she begged her mother to stop.</p><p>Rio took Nicky, getting her into the carseat. She guided Agatha to the passenger side, buckling her in too since Agatha’s body was paralyzed with fear. Her wife started the car, a gentle hand on her knee.</p><p>“Cariño?” Rio asked, <i>so</i> fucking softly.</p><p>The downpour of the rain coincided perfectly with the tears finally overflowing. Sheets of rain ricochet off the windshield, Agatha dropping her face into her hands as the sobs ripped from her throat. Why the fuck hadn’t she said anything? Stood up for herself? Smacked the bitch?</p><p>Rio’s other hand carded through her hair. “Oh, mi amor…”</p><p>Agatha raised her head, sniffling. She forced the tears to subside, whipping around to check on Nicky, who was peacefully asleep in the carseat. “Is she okay?”</p><p>“Nicky’s fine, baby.” Rio soothed. “She’s good.”</p><p>“She- she didn’t touch her, right?” Agatha croaked, and she <i>swore</i> her wrist started aching from the storm.</p><p>“No.” Her wife tilted her head. “She’s safe. You kept her safe. Are <i>you</i> okay?”</p><p>She wiped her eyes out of humiliation, nothing had even happened, she was just being <i>fucking dramatic</i>. “Can we go home?”</p><p>“Yeah. Yeah, of course.” Rio’s hand left her hair, but one remained on her knee. Her wife shifted gears, backing out of the parking lot. “I think we’ve earned it.”</p><p>Once home, Rio got out first and opened an umbrella, holding Agatha’s door open for her. Her wife kept her dry as she grabbed Nicky’s carseat, scrambling into the house. Whether it had been the short jog from the driveway to the front door, or the thunder now cracking like a whip through the sky, something caused their daughter to stir.</p><p>She set down the carseat, undoing the numerous clips and scooping Nicky up as her daughter cried. ‘Yeah, me too, kid’ Agatha thought as she pressed a kiss to Nicky’s forehead. Her daughter wailed, tiny hands clinging to her shirt and hair. “It’s okay, sweetheart. You’re okay.”</p><p>Her daughter gulped down some air in between another sob, a hiccupping “<i>Mama</i>.” said in a small voice. Rio froze next to her as Agatha’s eyes went wide.</p><p>“Did she just-” Her wife started.</p><p>“She said mama.” She smiled, genuinely. Her daughter, presumably scared, had said her first word in reference to Agatha. She couldn’t remember a time growing up and asking for her mother when she was scared, mostly because it was Evanora she was terrified of. “She said mama!”</p><p>Rio chuckled, looking at their still crying infant. “Traitor.”</p><p>Nicky burrowed her head into Agatha’s neck, fingers tangled in her mama’s hair.</p><p>“At least it wasn’t fuck.” Agatha grinned.</p><p>“A miracle.” Rio said, placing her hand on the small of Agatha’s back. “Seriously, are you okay?”</p><p>No, but she was safe. “Better now that I’m the favorite.”</p><p>“‘Uh’ sounds are much easier for babies than ‘ee’ sounds, plus it’s a repetitive word!”</p><p>“Don’t be a sore loser, baby.”</p><p>“Do you wanna talk about it?” Rio offered, gigantic eyes filled with sympathy.</p><p>“Later.” Agatha held Nicky as close as possible. “I just want to enjoy this.”</p><p>Her wife nodded, letting the subject go temporarily. “Okay.”</p><p>Their daughter’s cries quieted, now small whimpers. “Mama.”</p><p>Agatha’s face lit up as she pressed her cheek atop Nicky’s head. “You tell ‘em, hon.”</p><p>“Now it just feels like she’s rubbing it in.”</p><p>“She has her mama’s wit!”</p><hr/><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>Her ex wife’s voice rang in her head, rattling and echoing. Agatha threw another dish into the sink, hearing the shattering of the bowl and not really giving a fuck.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>Who's truly happy nowadays anyways? The Amish? She scraped the rest of the <i>dry</i> chicken into the garbage can, hurling the very nice serving plate into the sink. Another sound of ceramic being broken.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>And then Rio and Nicky left, her daughter barely giving her the courtesy of an actual glance. “Don’t marry her.” was the sage advice her thirteen year old gave her, doe eyes reddened to match Agatha’s own. Notably, <i>no</i> hug. Not that she particularly blamed her daughter after the events of tonight's dinner.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>Who asks that?! She could fucking <i>feel</i> Rio’s wedding ring burning a hole in the pocket of her jeans. What the fuck did she expect Agatha to do with it? Why was that now her responsibility?</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i><br/>
<i>Are you happy?</i><br/>
<i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>She flung the silverware into the metal basin, a horrible clanging sound reverberating throughout the kitchen. Agatha found her wine glass on the counter top, chugging it in one go and wincing at the taste of fucking <i>chugging</i> merlot.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>“Can I help?” Wanda chirped from the threshold of the hallway, a tight and unconvincing smile on her face.</p><p>“I think you’ve done enough.” Agatha scoffed, crossing the room to the fridge and grabbing another bottle.</p><p>Wanda walked in, setting her hands on the counter. “How was I supposed to know Nicky would lash out like that?”</p><p>Agatha ripped the cork out of the bottle with her teeth, spitting it out. “Her birthday dinner? Therapy? The fact that I asked you for some fucking time? I don’t know, it feels like there were context clues, <i>hon</i>.”</p><p>Her girlfriend rolled her eyes. “It’s adolescent rage, it's a phase! And you’re the one who lets her thirteen year old bully and manipulate everyone else around her.”</p><p>“Manipulate?!” Agatha cocked her head. “She’s not being mean for shits and giggles, Wanda! She feels like nobody is listening to her, that her feelings don’t matter. That’s why I wanted to fucking wait, which I explicitly told you last night! You don’t get to talk about <i>my</i> daughter like that when you just folded her world in on itself.”</p><p>Public proposals should be outlawed, all those people staring as Wanda got down on one knee in the middle of the restaurant. Agatha hadn’t even said <i>yes</i>, she just nodded and smiled and then before she knew it, the fucking ring was on her finger. She specifically told Wanda when they got back home that she needed time to <i>actually</i> accept.</p><p>Agatha knew why Wanda proposed when she did, two fucking weeks after she thought something happened between her and Rio. Insecurity breeds competition. And yeah, Agatha didn’t consider herself <i>ready</i> for marriage, but at least someone fucking wanted her. That was a miracle in its own right. At least Wanda showed up and actually did things to prove she <i>wanted</i> Agatha.</p><p><i>I love you, and I can’t do this to myself.</i></p><p>Then fight for me.</p><p>Rio didn’t do anything but leave, had done the same after Alex. Saying ‘I love you’ wasn’t enough, it didn’t guarantee anything. And then, in the most predictable and ironic turn of events, Rio left again tonight.</p><p><i>Then I concede.</i></p><p>Fight for me.</p><p><i>I can’t do it to our daughter.</i></p><p>Fight. For. Me.</p><p><i>Then I concede.</i></p><p>As if she hadn’t given up long before that.</p><p>Always the victim.</p><p>Always the poor puppy Agatha had kicked to the curb.</p><p>Rio conceded the day Alex was born, she had given up the second things got tough. She stopped fighting for Agatha that day, happy to withdraw completely. She left Agatha to grieve <i>alone</i>. To mourn <i>alone</i>. Rio checked out and didn’t check back in until Agatha had served her the fucking papers, and by that time it was too late.</p><p>“You jumped the fucking gun to stake your claim on me!” Agatha shouted, wildly gesturing.</p><p>“That’s ridiculous!”</p><p>“Is it? You’re jealous of Rio, you’re convinced something happened between us-”</p><p>“She still wears her fucking wedding ring, Agatha! <i>She’s</i> Nicky’s mom! How the hell am I supposed to compete with that?!”</p><p>“I’m not asking you to!” She dug in her jeans for the ring, holding it up. “And she doesn’t!”</p><p>“Maybe that’s the problem! You don’t seem to care about how your ex or daughter treat me. You’re ashamed of the engagement-”</p><p>“You can’t be in control of everything, Wanda!” Agatha snapped. “You’re acting shocked that Nicky isn’t connecting with you, when you don’t know her. She’d be your stepchild and can you even tell me her favorite color?!”</p><p>“Oh my god.” Wanda shook her head. “I can’t believe you’re not even trying to see things from my point of view.”</p><p>“I can’t quell your jealousy, validate Nicky’s dreams, and soothe Rio’s breakdown all in one night! It’s too much!” Agatha all but fucking screamed. “I’m just one person, and everyone fucking needs something from me! And somehow, no matter <i>what</i> I fucking do, I’m still the bad guy!” She slammed down Rio’s wedding ring onto the counter. “It’s <i>too</i> much! It’s too hard! I can’t do it!”</p><p>Her girlfriend blinked a few times, impassively raising her eyebrows. “You are being so <i>fucking dramatic</i>.” Wanda rolled her shoulders back in annoyance, looking unconvinced to be having this conversation. “I thought that there’d be at least one person happy for us tonight, I’m sorry.” Her tone came out mildly frustrated. “We’re not going to make any progress when you’re like this-”</p><p>“Like what?” Agatha sharply asked.</p><p>Wanda huffed, turning to leave. “Impossible and throwing a temper tantrum like a little kid!”</p><p>“I’m not throwing a temper tantrum, there’d be a lot more broken shit if I were!”</p><p>“I’ll call you tomorrow, hopefully you’ve calmed down by then.” Wanda quietly spoke, striding down the hall. Agatha placed her elbows on the counter, slumping over in frustration. The crashing sound of her wine glass falling onto the floor timed perfectly with Wanda slamming the front door closed.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>The sobs came out quick and short, her ribs wracking as the tears burned down her cheeks. She sniffled, pushing off the counter and surveying the damage done. The wine glass scattered across the hardwood, wine bleeding into the cracks. Agatha crouched down, not thinking twice about picking up the shards. She collected the bigger pieces and chucked those into the sink too, only then realizing the open cut on her palm.</p><p>Deep, almost black, crimson seeped out along her skin.</p><p>She hadn’t even felt the pain of being cut.</p><p>Maybe the emotional agony was much too consuming.</p><p><i>Are you happy?</i></p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha roared into the desolate room, no signs of life, not even in herself. Wanda was mad at her, Nicky hated her, Rio gave up on her. She wiped her runny nose with the back of her hand, grabbing a tea towel and wrapping it around her bloodied palm.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to eavesdrop-" Lilia began, spawning out of nowhere. “But it was kind of hard not to overhear.”</p><p>Agatha curled in on herself, hunching over the sink, weeping. “Sorry.”</p><p>Her mom came up behind her, a gentle hand on her shoulder. “You don’t need to apologize, not to me.”</p><p>Shit, it had just become second nature to say sorry.</p><p>She hastily turned, collapsing into Lilia's arms, because of course they were already stretched out for a hug. Agatha set her chin on her mom’s shoulder as she cried, her own arms wrapped around Lilia like a lifeline. “I think I’m fucking everything up, and I- I don’t know why.”</p><p>Lilia’s hand cradled the back of her head. “You’re not fucking up anything, Agatha. You’re doing your best.”</p><p>“My best <i>sucks</i>.”</p><p>The older woman chuckled, lightly pushing Agatha to look at her. “You need to be kinder to yourself,” Lilia grabbed Agatha’s face, thumb brushing away the tears. “And maybe analyze why it is you and your kinda-fiancée are screaming at each other in the kitchen.”</p><p>“Ma, please. Couples fight-”</p><p>“I don’t appreciate how she talks to you, and I know you wouldn’t tolerate that if you were actually doing well.” Her mom grinned. “You’ve punched people for worse.”</p><p>“That foster dad <i>did</i> grab my ass!”</p><p>“I know.” Lilia raised her brows. “My daughter doesn’t take shit from anyone, so why’s it happening now?”</p><p>Lilia had been the only one to believe her, when she was marked as a violent foster placement, a kid who was difficult and disobedient towards authority figures. She got to her house and Lilia had asked her why she punched the foster father at her last home, so she told her, thinking Lilia would be like any other adult and dismiss her. Lilia didn’t. She called and got that foster family’s license revoked and encouraged Agatha to make a formal report.</p><p>Her mom had been the first and, for a long time, the only person to see something more in Agatha. Something good, something that didn’t have to be beaten or punished out of her. Lilia always said that she saw Agatha’s file and her picture and told the caseworker that Agatha couldn’t be all bad, that there had to be more to that young girl.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Agatha’s voice came out weak, her lip trembling.</p><p>“Tesoro, the pain on the inside won’t go away until you do something about it. I’ve bitten my tongue and tried to support you where I can, but…you can’t outrun yourself forever. Eventually, you gotta face that you’ve been putting a bandaid on a bullet wound. I love you, but you worry the shit outta me.”</p><p>She nodded, taking a deep breath.</p><p>“Now,” Lilia’s hands dropped from her face. “I’m going to help you clean this up and then we’ll have another glass of wine because my buzz is kind of fading.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, swallowing the spit and snot back. “Okay.”</p><p>Monday night, Wanda called, apologizing for how she went about things at family dinner. Agatha accepted, more so out of convenience. She hung up the phone after talking for a while, throwing her phone onto her night stand. She slid off her engagement ring, examining it. Agatha hadn’t really done so in the forty-eight hours since being proposed to.</p><p>It wasn’t really her style, but it wasn’t fair to compare it to her first engagement ring. She had put her first engagement ring, along with hers and Rio’s wedding bands into her jewelry box atop her dresser. Agatha looked at the ring, oval and silver, weighted from the size of the stone. With her first ring, she couldn’t stop staring or smiling at it. Now though? She groaned, shoving the damn thing back on her finger and clicking out the bedside lamp.</p><p>The house was always so quiet without Nicky, so empty. Agatha never slept well on the nights where her daughter wasn’t down the hall. In fact, she hadn’t slept well in years. Almost six to be exact.</p><p>On Tuesday, she showed up for therapy. Not <i>family</i> therapy, the session with just her and Rio. She thought about bailing, but Lilia’s words had already taken root in her mind. Winter break wasn’t over for two more days, so she sat in the waiting room around noon, stomach churning at seeing Rio again. Nicky was spending the day with Lilia before piano, and she hadn’t heard from her daughter since Sunday. Agatha got the message, Nicky didn’t want to talk to her despite the texts and missed calls. She couldn’t force her daughter to speak to her, she’d do it when she was ready.</p><p>Agatha anxiously twirled her engagement ring around her finger, once then twice then thrice, over and over–</p><p>“You’ll blind someone with that thing.” Rio said, face sunken in as she sat next to Agatha, hands tucked in her jacket pockets.</p><p>“Sorry.” She murmured.</p><p>Damnit, knee jerk reaction.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“How’s Nicky?”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek, refusing eye contact. “About as good as you can imagine…given the circumstances.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>Melina’s door swung open, the doctor giving a curt smile and waving them in. Agatha rose first, taking off as if her legs could carry her away from here. She sat down on one end of the couch, Rio on the other. Melina sat in front of them, grabbing her glasses.</p><p>“How have you two been since the last session? Anything you would like to start off with today?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Sweet, soul-crushing silence.</p><p>The absence of sound.</p><p>Dr. Vostokoff looked between the two. “If you’d prefer, I can ask about your childhoods-“</p><p>“Agatha’s engaged.” Rio interrupted, body language rigid. “Told us on Sunday. Nicky’s crushed.”</p><p>She didn’t correct Rio, what would the point even be?</p><p>“And what about you?” Melina questioned, her pen scribbling. “How do you feel?”</p><p>Rio bitterly smiled. “Fanfuckingtastic.”</p><p>“I understand you are being sardonic, however given you still wear your wedding band, I would like a real answer.”</p><p>Her ex wife pulled her hands out of her pockets, flashing them off to the therapist. “Took it off.”</p><p>Melina blinked in surprise. “That is a big step.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Eh, we still have our matching tattoos, so at least that’s <i>forever</i>.”</p><p>“Matching tattoos?”</p><p>“I have an <i>A</i>, <i>Agatha’s got an R</i>.”</p><p>“I don’t have a tattoo.” Agatha finally spoke.</p><p>“Yes, you do.” Rio looked at her. “On the side of your ribs.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes remained on the doctor. “No, I got it removed when we got divorced.”</p><p>“You did?” Rio’s voice clipped.</p><p>“Yup.” Agatha breathed out.</p><p>Rio couldn’t check and wouldn’t know if she was telling the truth or not, anytime they fucked after the divorce Agatha’s shirt remained on.</p><p>Melina cleared her throat. “Is the fiancée aware of you two having sex after the divorce?”</p><p>“No.” She answered. “And she’s jealous enough, Wanda doesn’t need to know.”</p><p>“Oh, Pennywise is insecure?” Rio mockingly pouted. “How healthy for a relationship and new marriage.”</p><p>“When was the last time you two had intercourse?” The doctor asked, unbothered.</p><p>“Uh, almost a year ago, last February.” Agatha said, ignoring Rio’s side-eye.</p><p>“And what triggered it?”</p><p>Nobody spoke, then her ex opened her mouth. “I think that’s a question for Agatha since she’s always the one to initiate.”</p><p>“God, are you on the rag or something?” Agatha snapped. “Why the fuck are you on my dick right now?”</p><p>Rio grinned, hands motioning to her but looking at the doctor. “I’ll be surprised if get an answer out of her because I haven’t been fucking able to in years!”</p><p>“Alex’s anniversary was a few days after, you prick.” Agatha sneered. “And you never come to her grave, and you never wanna spend time with me or Nicky on that day, so fucking you was the only way I could feel somewhat close to our dead child!”</p><p>Now that, that was all <i>painfully</i> true.</p><p>Rio slumped back against the couch, mouth closing. Agatha waited, hoped, prayed for a response—</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Melina wrote some more down. “And the other times? Were those also Alex related?”</p><p>“I don’t fucking know.” Agatha said, resting her head against her hand. “Felt lonely, wanted an orgasm. Why else do people fuck?”</p><p>“Rio,” Melina started. “Why is it that you go quiet when Alex is mentioned? Do you harbor guilt?”</p><p>“I just prefer not to.” Rio spoke, adding nothing else.</p><p>Melina sighed. “Fine, is the sex the same as it was during your marriage?”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha cocked her head. “Perv.”</p><p>“Agatha doesn’t want me touching her stomach, she stays covered up.” Her ex wife willingly told.</p><p>“Fuck you.” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“What’s the purpose for staying covered?” The doctor scrunched her face.</p><p>“I- I have a scar…from Alex. I don’t want it touched.”</p><p>“Does your current partner respect that? Staying covered?”</p><p>“Oh, no.” Agatha smiled, making sure the information stung. “Wanda gets to see and touch it all she wants.” Her eyes flew to Rio. “She’s not the reason it’s there.”</p><p>“And Rio is?”</p><p>“Rio’s not the reason I had a C-section. She’s the reason Alex didn’t <i>survive</i> the C-section.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m also the reason <i>you</i> survived that C-section.” Her ex mumbled under her breath.</p><p>“Elaborate for me.” The therapist’s eyes bounced from her, to Rio, and back. “<i>What happened to Alex?</i>”</p>

<p><b>February, 2020.</b></p><p>“Rio, wake up.” Agatha shifted in bed, her thighs feeling sticky and warm. “I- I’m bleeding.”</p><p>Her wife shot up in the blink of an eye, not surprising since Rio had been on edge this entire pregnancy. She even had the nerve to suggest Agatha terminate when they got the news that Alex wouldn’t survive outside the womb very long. It was actually a miracle that Alex had survived <i>inside</i> the womb this long. Most triploidy cases ended in miscarriage. It was still too early though, she wasn’t even thirty-four weeks yet.</p><p>Agatha’s body had been slowly deteriorating along with Alex’s. Preeclampsia that she had to take several thousand meds for, blurry or black spots in her vision, fainting. She couldn’t even go back to teaching after Christmas, couldn’t even chase Nicky around the house. Agatha endured it all, it wasn’t Alex’s fault. If Agatha’s body was the one to make her daughter sick, Agatha should be the one to suffer for it.</p><p>Her eyes wetted, the clock on the night stand reading <i>7:55AM</i>, a low groan exiting her lips. The sheets were definitely stained, her hands cradling her bump. “It’s too soon.”</p><p>Rio was already getting dressed, phone in hand. “I’ll call an ambulance-”</p><p>“Don’t, I don’t want to wake up Nicky. The sirens will only make her think something’s wrong.” Agatha writhed as more crimson pooled beneath her. “Call Jen, I’ll call ma so she can stay with teddy.”</p><p>“Baby, you’re bleeding-”</p><p>“I’m aware, just-” And right on fucking time, her gut twisted. Not like a contraction, she knew what those felt like, this was something else. “Just make the call. Help me to the car.”</p><p>Rio looked weary of the plan, but Agatha’s scheduled C-section wasn’t for another week, so it was the best they could do. Another seven days and she would’ve been at eight months, not ideal for any delivery, but at least Alex would get a few breaths in that way.</p><p>Twenty minutes later Lilia arrived and Rio helped her to the car, she sat on a fucking towel as what she only assumed was more blood and amniotic fluid gushed out of her. She softly banged her head against the window, the tears unabashedly flowing. Agatha had accepted the fact that Alex would die, it was the reality of what would happen. But, she’d die before giving up completely on her daughter. Nobody protected Agatha growing up, so she had to be the one to protect Alex.</p><p>Time, she just wanted <i>time</i>. To hold her daughter in her arms and be there as Alex’s body slowed to stop. To make sure she knew, albeit for even a minute, that she was loved. That she had people who wanted her in this world, even if she’d have to depart early. That her moms <i>wanted</i> her. <i>Fought</i> for her. That she was a physical manifestation of their love. Agatha wanted her daughter to know that, even if for just a fleeting moment. She wanted Alex to die at peace, with some respect.</p><p>And if that meant Agatha went with her, if Agatha’s body paid the price? Then fine. She was a burden beared for so long, and if this was the end, there’d be no better way to go than for the sake of her child.</p><p>She understood Rio didn’t agree, but it wasn’t Rio’s body or choice. Her wife tried over and over again to make Agatha see the light, pleading with her. She couldn’t, she couldn’t give up on Alex like so many people had given up on her. Their daughter’s full name, Alexandria, had been picked for that specific reason. Meaning strength or protection, an epithet of the goddess Hera. Agatha saw it fitting to name her daughter in accordance with the deity entrusted with protecting childbirth and family. A kernel of comfort she could send her child off with into the afterlife.</p><p>She was greeted with a wheelchair when they arrived at the hospital, rolled to a room, and left to wait for Jen. She’d been Agatha’s OB for Nicky, she had been the one to deliver the news about Alex. She had walked into the exam room during Agatha’s first trimester, doing another scan since the ultrasound tech left the room concerned and pale. Jen looked apologetic as she told her and Rio that Alex wouldn’t live, not long at least. That there’d be risks to their daughter. Early labor, congenital heart disease, seizures, underdeveloped organs, cystic kidney disease. That Alex wasn’t meant to live.</p><p>The next step offered was a medically necessary abortion, which Agatha refused. Not out of some moral or religious stance, but out of love. She made this body from scratch, and she would continue to do so for as long as she could. Rio watched, watched as Agatha got bigger, as her breaths grew short, as climbing the stairs became dangerous out of fear she’d lose her balance. Rio was worried about Agatha’s life, Agatha was worried about Alex’s.</p><p>Jen burst into the room, trying to smile. “How are we feeling?”</p><p>Agatha felt like the life was slowly being drained out of her, her lungs heavy and her heart palpitating. She was aware that her body wasn’t doing well, that the blood loss and numerous other issues were steadily becoming critical. “Great, I want to push.”</p><p>Her wife by her bedside, already frazzled, jumped up. “No, you’re not pushing.”</p><p>“Yes, I am. I’m here, I’m going to push.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said. “What Rio means is, you <i>can’t</i>. Not with your body already struggling to keep you and her alive. Your blood pressure alone has told us that much. If you deliver vaginally, it could be fatal to both you and her. We need to do a C-section, they’re prepping the O.R. right now.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, she thought the one bright spot in all of this would be not having to go through with a C-section. She <i>knew</i> what would happen. Her biggest fear. That she’d wake up with her child gone.</p><p>She looked over to Rio, her voice thick. “You have to <i>promise me</i> that if I wake up, Alex will be waiting for me.”</p><p>Her wife’s brows knitted together. “Mi amor, you’ll wake up-”</p><p>“Not at the cost of her.”</p><p>“Alice is on standby for whatever Alex will need.” Jen placated. “She’ll be in good hands.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t let her eyes leave Rio’s. “<i>Promise me</i>.”</p><p>“Baby,” Rio grabbed her hand, lacing their fingers together. “Jen’s going to get Alex out, Alice will get her to the NICU, you’ll wake up.”</p><p>“Not at the cost of her.” Agatha repeated. “I want her to go knowing one of us,  and if I’m not here, then it’s got to be you.”</p><p>“I won’t let anything happen to you, Agatha.” Rio’s eyes brimmed. “I’m not trading your life for hers.”</p><p>She whipped her head over to Jen. “If anything happens, save Alex.”</p><p>Jen’s face fell. “Agatha, when you’re under, your next of kin decides. And medically-”</p><p>“I don’t care!” She hissed, suddenly feeling sick. “You save her.” Agatha’s gaze swept back to Rio, tears making her vision blur. “Please.” She whispered. “Please, my love. Please let her live. You have to-”</p><p>“Nothing’s going to happen, cariño. You’ll be fine.” Rio gently told, unconvincingly she might add. “I promise, as soon as you wake up, we can see her, okay?”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>Another pair of scrubs informed Jen the O.R. was ready, a flurry of medical personnel gathering. “We gotta go.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand, placing a kiss on her forehead. “I’ll be in the gallery. I’ll be there the whole time. Nothing bad is going to happen.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, the salt of her tears beginning to stain her skin. “I’m…I’m scared.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I want more time.” She hiccupped, her fingers splayed on her swollen stomach. “I want more time.”</p><p>Rio smiled, though it was one devoid of joy. “If I could break all the rules of nature to give that to you, I would.” Her eyes flitted to Agatha’s monitor, obviously seeing something that worried her. “But they’ve got to go now, any longer and neither of you-” Rio cut herself off, clearing her throat. “They’ve got to go now.”</p><p>She gave a small nod, her bed starting to be rolled away after they gave her some drug to knock her out. Her hand slipped from Rio’s, her other still holding her bump. Agatha was given a cap for her hair, Jen making a little joke on the way about how the hell she’d fit all of it in there. She felt the drowsiness hit her as they approached the double doors of the operating room. In her last vestiges of consciousness, she looked down at her daughter inside her, whispering “Your mom loves you so.” in case she never got the chance.</p><p>Agatha woke up, her stomach smaller than it had been in months, feeling like a fucking semi had hit her. The sun coming through the blinds of her hospital room indicated it was probably sometime in the afternoon, how long had she been out? Her lids fought to close, scanning the surroundings. She saw Rio and Jen through the window, they stood in the hallway, speaking in hushed tones.</p><p>She was alive.</p><p>She was alive, meaning Alex was too.</p><p>A small smile graced her features, relief spreading through her body. Physically, she <i>ached</i>, a dull pain lingering. Emotionally, she beamed. She’d get to hold her daughter soon, or at least see her if Alex’s state was too fragile to be touched. She could get an estimate on how long they had with her, maybe long enough for Nicky to see her.</p><p>After a minute of waiting, she got impatient, swallowing through a very dry mouth and croaking out “Baby?”</p><p>Her wife looked at her through the window.</p><p>No.</p><p>The amber of Rio’s eyes had been reduced to a burnt crisp, no emotion other than sorrow stood out against the irritated red of tears. Her mouth was in a straight line, unable or unwilling to form anything but. Shoulders tensed, body rigid, almost as though she were scared.</p><p>No.</p><p>Her gut wretched, being torn in two as she read everything on Rio in a second.</p><p>Her wife walked in, Jen close behind.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, praying and hoping she was wrong. “Where is she?”</p><p>Rio’s voice broke. “Baby-”</p><p>“Where is she?” Agatha interrupted, holding back a sob. “Where is she?!”</p><p>“Alex-” Rio wiped her face of the wetness already trickling down. “Mi amor, Alex didn’t make it.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha uttered, throat tight. “No, no, no-”</p><p>“You were losing too much blood-”</p><p>“No! No, no, no!” Agatha openly wailed, her hands gripping at the scratchy blanket of her bed. “No! We had a deal! You fucking <i>let me down!</i>”</p><p>Rio rushed over, trying to offer comfort. “Agatha-”</p><p>“Don’t!” She yelled, sobs wracking through her. “Don’t <i>touch</i> me.”</p><p>“I- I’m sorry. I’m <i>so</i> sorry.”</p><p>She bawled, gasping for air when there felt like there wasn’t any. “<i>I know</i>.”</p><hr/><p>“That must’ve been hard, to go through that and know your child wasn’t meant to live long.” Melina said after Agatha had recounted every harrowing detail. “The guilt in outliving your daughter.”</p><p>Agatha sat in the exact same spot on the couch, in therapy, using her sleeve to dry her face. “Yeah.”</p><p>Rio sat in the exact same spot as well, silent and looking down at her hands.</p><p>“You alluded to the fact that it was your fault Alex was sick.” The doctor checked over her notes. “Why do you say that?”</p><p>“It’s true.” Agatha breathed out. “My one job was to keep Alex safe and I failed at it, I couldn’t heal her. I barely made it through my pregnancy with Nicky.” She bit her lip for a moment. “I- I should’ve been the one to go that day, Alex should’ve had time.”</p><p>“Triploidy is a chromosomal abnormality, it’s not something developed from the carrier of the child.”</p><p>“<i>Thank you.</i>” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. “Oh, now you have something to add?”</p><p>“I’m just agreeing with Dr. Vostokoff-”</p><p>“No, you were undermining me.” She accused. “I know you think that I’m stupid for wanting to prioritize Alex, but did you even take her into account?!”</p><p>“Did you take me or Nicky into account?” Rio countered, voice quiet but lethal. “Did you take into account the people you were ready to leave behind? Did you consider Nicky growing up without her mom? Did you?”</p><p>“Oh!” Agatha theatrically gasped. “There you go again, pretending that Nicky is the only one who matters!”</p><p>“What the fuck does that-” Rio began to ask, when her phone buzzed. She pulled it out, reading a text and shoving it back in her pocket. “I have to, um, I gotta go.”</p><p>“Really?!” Agatha cocked her head, watching as Rio stood.</p><p>“It’s work, I’m sorry.” Rio answered, clearly frustrated. “There’s only ten minutes left of the session anyways.”</p><p>“It’s <i>always</i> work! It’s <i>always</i> your job!” Agatha shot off the couch, increasingly becoming more pissed. “That’s all you ever fucking do! Things get tough, you bail!”</p><p>“Are you <i>trying</i> to pick a fucking fight right now?”</p><p>“Yes! Oh my god, yes! I would <i>love</i> to fight! I would love to hear you scream or yell at me! Anything but sitting there like a wounded dove, fight with me! Fight for fucking something! Say something, speak up! Talk about our kid, say her fucking name!”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Agatha, that won’t get us anywhere. You’re the mother of my child, I’m not-”</p><p>“<i>Children!</i>” Agatha screeched, hands furiously gesturing. “The mother of your <i>children</i>! Am I crazy? Did we not have two?! Did I hallucinate everything I just told our doctor? You make me feel insane! Say something!” Agatha finally shot a hand out, nudging Rio’s shoulder. “Say something! Say you feel bad or sad or upset! Say. Her. Fucking. Name!”</p><p>She nudged Rio again, pestering, pushing. Her ex wife grabbed her wrist, the hold was tight but not uncomfortable. “Fine! You want a fucking fight?!” Rio’s eyes narrowed as she set her jaw. “I’ve thought about her everyday for almost six years. I dissect every choice I made that day, I think about what I could’ve done differently. It’s the first thing I remember when I wake up, it’s my last memory before I sleep. Every single fucking day for almost six years, that’s-” Rio thought for a beat. “That’s 2,190 days where I analyze the decisions I’ve made and find a way to live with them!”</p><p>She dropped Agatha’s wrist. “And the worst part is, I wouldn’t change a fucking thing. I wouldn’t go back and do anything differently. I’d choose you time and time again. And that guilt eats at me, it keeps me up at night.” Rio fixed her jacket, taking a step back and reaching for the doorknob. “That enough for you? You feel better now?” She opened the office door, “Now, if you’ll excuse me, a little boy that I <i>can</i> save needs my help. I have to go.” and slammed it shut.</p><p>Agatha sniffled, rolling her shoulders back and taking a seat again. “Notice how she didn’t say Alex’s name?”</p><p>Melina quirked a brow. “Yes, I have noticed a lot.”</p><hr/><p>Rio sprinted through the halls of Mass Gen, ignoring therapy with her ex wife thirty minutes prior. She wasn't even on-call today, but Jen had texted her out of nothing more than being a good friend. Alice was supposedly working on him as he crashed, which made no sense. Rio had been here yesterday, he was weak, sicker than he’d ever been, but no indications of him being on the brink.</p><p>She ran through the PEDs wing, still in her street clothes. She narrowly avoided colliding with patients and faculty, lungs burning as her feet pushed harder. Maybe if she got there, she could save him, do something. He couldn’t die, he wouldn’t. Rio had been seeing him for nearly six years, month after month, day after day.</p><p>Rio halted as she wheezed for air at the threshold of his door, people already filtering out.</p><p>Billy laid still on the bed.</p><p>Cold, unmoving.</p><p>No.</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>She caught Alice’s arm, pulling her aside as Jeff held a wailing Rebecca. Rio furrowed her brows in confusion, Alice looked at her. “Pnuemonia. He must’ve caught a cold-”</p><p>“No.” Rio panted, unwilling to accept this. “No, I was here yesterday.”</p><p>“The chemo took too much out of him, his fever spiked too fast-”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Who was on-call this morning?”</p><p>Alice sighed, “Yelena. I sent her out of here when he took a turn, she couldn’t deal.”</p><p>“But-”</p><p>“Rio.” Alice was gentle in removing Rio’s hand from her arm. “He’s gone.” She left the room, leaving Rio to stare as two parents grieved their child.</p><p>She felt her legs begging to melt, to let her drop, but she resisted. Rio took a step forward, then another. She didn’t let herself look at BIlly, at the dead  six year-old curled up on the bed. Rebecca held the stuffed dinosaur, Jeff trying to console her.</p><p>Rio approached, her voice barely audible over the bloodrush in her ears. “Rebecca, I’m-”</p><p>She peered up, direct but not unkind in her words. “Do you have kids, Dr. Vidal?”</p><p>“I do.” Rio chirped, holding her own self by crossing her arms.</p><p>“Ever lost one?”</p><p>Her eyes welled. “I have.”</p><p>Rebecca slowly shook her head, weeping. “So you know your apologies don’t help anything.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say more, just gave a nod, intending to leave. “He was a good kid.”</p><p>“Wait.” Rebecca sniffled, holding out the dinosaur. “He’d want you to have Tommy.”</p><p>“No, Rebecca. I can’t take that-”</p><p>“You know what this reminds me of?” Rebecca stopped her. “My son, sick and-” Her voice shattered into a million tiny pieces. “Sick and dying. This dinosaur is his illness and not getting to be a kid with the little time he had. It’s him getting w- weaker. It’s him being cut open. It’- it’s- I hate this fucking dinosaur. So, if you can see something happy in it, <i>please</i> take it.”</p><p>Her hand, though shaking, took the plushie. “Okay.”</p><p>Rebecca didn’t say more, her head falling against her husband's chest once again. Rio stumbled out of the room, holding back a wave of unshed tears.</p><p><i>Bottle it up.</i><br/>
<i>Bottle it up.</i><br/>
<i>Bottle it up.</i></p><p>A cry bellowed through the hall, not Rebecca’s. Rio cautiously made her way farther down until she reached the on-call room, opening the door. She poked her head into the room, Yelena sat on the bed, shaking as she wept. Rio cleared her throat, the blond looking up and rapidly blinking to hide her tears.</p><p>“Dr.-”</p><p>“Don’t.” Rio said, clutching the dinosaur how Billy once had. “Grab your coat, we’re getting a drink.”</p><p>“It is two in the afternoon.”</p><p>“Yup,” Rio sadly grinned. “Sure is. Let’s go.”</p><p>And there Rio sat, at the same bar where she had met her wife eighteen years ago, drinking with her resident to drown every emotion in her body. Her phone had been silenced, the hours passing.</p><p>It was around seven at night, both of them several drinks deep, Yelena still looking like a sad puppy.</p><p>“I should have caught it sooner.” Yelena sulked, throwing back another shot. “I killed-”</p><p>“Don’t finish that sentence.” Rio lightly scolded, carefully peeling at the label of her beer. “It’ll eat you alive if you think like that.”</p><p>Yelena deflated in her stool. “How’d you know about this place?”</p><p>“Closest bar to Mass Gen.”</p><p>“Mmh.”</p><p>“It’s also where I met Agatha.”</p><p>“Is that the ex wife who you are still clearly in love with?”</p><p>“Who told you that?”</p><p>“Alice and Jen love to gossip.”</p><p>“Great.” Rio groaned. “And yes, that’s her.”</p><p>“Why’d you get divorced if you love her so much?”</p><p><i>I killed our daughter</i> was the first answer that came to mind, Rio picked at the label faster as she responded. “We, uh, we lost a kid.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m s-”</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>“Do you miss her?”</p><p>“All the time. Hurts like hell.” Riot turned her head, glancing at Yelena. “She just got <i>engaged</i>.”</p><p>“Okay so, maybe my problems <i>are</i> smaller.”</p><p>“Couldn’t save Billy, or my marriage, or <i>her</i>.” Rio listed off, fingernails ripping at the beer label. “Couldn’t fix anything, couldn’t be who she needed me to be, can’t even be honest with myself. I’m living every day lying to myself and other people because I’m too afraid of what would happen otherwise.” She chuckled, the damp paper collected atop the bar. “I’m so fucking scared that I just swallow everything down.”</p><p>The resident raised her eyebrows, whistling. “I think it is time we call it a night.”</p><p>“Sorry for putting all my shit on you, that wasn’t fair.”</p><p>“Eh, nothing about today was fair.” Yelena got up, pulling out her phone. “I am broke, so I assume the drinks were on you, yes?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>The blond smiled before becoming serious, genuine. “Thank you, for this.”</p><p>“No problem.”</p><p>After Yelena left, Rio finished her beer and had another. Not quite drunk, not <i>not</i> tipsy. She opened her phone to order a ride when-</p><p><b>Lilia, 5:44PM:</b> Just picked up Nicky from piano, dropping her at yours?</p><p><b>Lilia, 5:49PM:</b> Rio?</p><p><b>Princesa, 5:55PM:</b> mami,,,,text nonna back</p><p><b>Lilia, missed call, 5:56PM</b></p><p><b>Princesa, 5:58PM:</b> mAmI</p><p><b>Lilia, missed call, 6:19PM</b></p><p><b>Lilia, 6:22PM:</b> I’m going to drop her off at Agatha’s.

Ma said she couldn’t get a hold of you</p><p><b>Mi Amor💜, 6:41PM:</b> We have a child together, Rio.

Please let me know you’re okay.</p><p><b>Mi Amor💜, missed call, 7:03PM</b></p><p>About ten million more missed calls and texts, the time now reading a little past 8PM. Shit, that’s right, she had a child in her care at the moment. Rio rubbed her temple, her thoughts jumbling together in an especially pitiful cocktail of self-loathing. She ordered the Uber for Agatha’s, silent in the backseat.</p><p>Rio idly twirled the stuffed dinosaur’s ear around her finger, the seam she sewed shut pulling with each go around. She doubled down. Again and again. The thread breaking more and more. The ear going slack, looser and looser. Rio knew how the stuffy must feel, its thread being pulled taut, its insides falling out. Again and again.</p><p>Couldn’t save Billy.</p><p>Couldn’t save Alex.</p><p>Couldn’t save her marriage.</p><p>Her fingers wrapped around the ear, ripping it off.</p><p>Couldn’t save Billy.</p><p>Couldn’t save Alex.</p><p>Couldn’t save her marriage.</p><p>The stuffing tumbled out across her legs.</p><p>Can’t keep bottling shit up when someone yanks it out of you.</p><p>The car slowed and Rio got out, standing at the end of the walkway and letting her sight trail across the home. She had fucking built this place. Not the bricks but everything inside, and now, Wanda would live here? Maybe?</p><p>God, she should’ve drank more, that way she could wretch up that thought along with the contents of her stomach. Rio dangled the dino from her hand as she made her way to the door, knocking. She darted her tongue out as something hit her lips. Oh, saltwater. Tears. Amazing.</p><p>She knocked again after a minute, the sound of someone undoing the locks. Agatha opened the door, glasses atop her head, dressed in her robe. Fuck, she always looked so soft and pretty like that. Relaxed and bare faced. Rio exhaled and her ribs heaved, trying to get more oxygen as she seemingly sobbed on her ex wife’s door step.</p><p>“You better have a good explanation, I’ve been sitting in the hallway outside Nicky’s door in the hopes she’d talk-” Agatha said as she opened the door, before she got a good look at her. “Rio?”</p><p>Couldn’t save Billy.</p><p>Couldn’t save Alex.</p><p>Couldn’t save her marriage.</p><p>Rio looked up through her lashes, her voice small and inexplicably delicate. “Billy died today.”</p><p>Agatha’s aqua flew from her face, to the dino, then back up to her. Her ex’s wife's face crinkled in confusion, because she didn’t know who the fuck Billy was, but there was also a hint of something else.</p><p>Empathy.</p><p>“Rio?” She asked again, gentle.</p><p>“Billy, h- he died.” Her shoulders hunched forwards, the warmth of the house inviting, the chill of the January air biting.</p><p>Agatha blinked, her hands carefully coming up to cradle Rio’s face. “Okay.”</p><p>She lunged forwards, throwing her arms around Agatha. “Billy died.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand rested on the back of her head, her arm wrapped around her waist. Her ex wife’s voice and touch was a familiar and deeply missed comfort. “It’s okay. It’s okay, baby.”</p><p>She clung to Agatha, the tears lessening as her ex held her. “Agatha?”</p><p>Her ex wife pulled back fractionally to look at her. “Yeah?”</p><p>“<i>Alex</i> died.”</p><p>Her daughter’s name felt foreign on her tongue, having refused to say it for the better part of a decade. Rio couldn’t explain why, but she had seen it as disrespectful.</p><p>Agatha let out a nearly indiscernible gasp, so slight it was quick to miss. But Rio knew her ex all too well, and saw how Agatha’s eyes flicked to her lips for one millisecond before correcting herself. “Yeah.” Her voice wavered. “Yeah, <i>she did</i>.”</p><p>“Alex’s gone.” Rio peered down at Agatha’s lips, the ones she’d kiss too many times to count, before looking back up. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath fanned over her face as she responded. “I know.”</p><p>The booze, the grief, the day, it was all swirling together. Making her say the things she shouldn’t. “I’ve missed you.”</p><p>Another “I know.” was said, heavier and holding weight that Rio didn’t know still existed. Her hands softly tugged at Agatha’s waist, pulling them flush. Her ex didn’t shy away, didn’t tell her to stop.</p><p>“No, you don’t.” Rio uttered, her nose brushing Agatha’s as she leaned in. “You don’t.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a breathy “No. I <i>know</i>.”</p><p>Her ex’s skin was hot, her mouth an inch away. “I can’t fucking stand it. I can’t-” Rio rasped, diving forward and letting her lips meet Agatha’s. Her ex shifted closer, the hand in Rio’s hair scrunching and keeping her planted. Rio dropped the stuffy, a light <i>thud</i> emitting into the room along with the sound of a quiet moan from Agatha.</p><p>Rio didn’t realize how badly she <i>ached</i> for this, how much she <i>craved</i> it. She angled her head, deepening the kiss as one hand dropped lower. Agatha writhed closer as Rio grabbed her ass, licking into her mouth. Her ex let her, she let Rio’s tongue move against hers, let Rio’s hands grope at her. It was too intoxicating.</p><p>Agatha’s taste and her scent and how deeply they were engrained into every part of Rio. Agatha was carved into every inch of her, a silent brand burned across her flesh, gnawing at her bones. An agony so sweet, the <i>lack</i> of pain felt painful. And she wouldn’t do anything different, couldn't. Not while standing in the home she built, her wife devouring everything Rio had left to give.</p><p>She kissed Agatha like it could very well be the last time, she wanted it to count if tomorrow her ex deemed it a mistake. What a shame, for something so perfect to be seen as wrong. There was nothing bad here, there was only love. Love that had been missed, love that had been discounted, love that had been ignored. Love that had been broken down, beaten black and blue, but still worked all the same.</p><p>And if she truly knew that, without a shred of doubt, why the hell didn’t she have it? Agatha’s free hand twisted in her jacket, finally <i>pushing</i>. Rio begrudgingly pulled back, her heart beating out of time. Her eyes fluttered open to see Agatha, her ex’s lips slightly swelled.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha whispered, not out of remorse, but reverence.</p><p>“I’m…” She wasn’t sorry, and wouldn’t say it. But she was something, if only she could find the word. “I’m going to do better.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands left her, the sensation already missed. “I’ll um, I’ll keep Nicky tonight. You can take the couch. I don’t feel comfortable with you being alone right now.”</p><p>She’d much rather sleep in bed with Agatha, she longed for even simple things like that again, but she wouldn’t push for that with their daughter down the hall. The only other bedroom in the house was the nursery that had been left to gather dust for the past six years.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “I’ll grab you a pillow and some sheets.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Her ex cautiously left, going upstairs to the linen closet. Rio took off her shoes and jacket, placing them in the same spots as she did when she lived here. She closed and locked the front door. Agatha came back downstairs, handing off the blankets and pillow.</p><p>“Well, you know where everything is, so…” Agatha said, slightly awkward. “I’m going to go to bed.”</p><p>“It’s 9PM.”</p><p>“Bed.” Agatha repeated, making a move towards the stairs.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Do you still have any of that chicken from Sunday?”</p><p>“No, I threw it out.”</p><p>Rio threw the linens down on the couch, shrugging. “Damn. I thought it was pretty good.”</p>

<p>“You wanna pick which flowers we give to mama?” Rio sneakily asked her daughter as they gardened together. Well, Rio gardened, Nicky toddled around in rainboots, overalls, and a bucket hat because Agatha was worried about her face getting burnt.</p><p>“Yeah!” Nicky squealed, her little legs carrying her around to different bushels of flowers.</p><p>Rio watched with a lazy grin as her three year old fisted her hand around stems and <i>yanked</i> them free. She chuckled to herself, crouching down with a pair of cutters and helping to sever the stems of the azaleas. “Good choice, princesa.”</p><p><b>May, 2016.</b></p><p>Nicky giggled, jumping up and down, braids jostling as she ran to a different plant. Rio diligently followed, repeating the same motions of cutting the stems so Nicky could hold the growing bouquet.</p><p>“Do you know why we give mama flowers?”</p><p>Her daughter pursed her lips in confusion, shaking her head. “No.”</p><p>“Because she’s pretty and deserves pretty flowers, right?” Rio answered, lightly poking Nicky’s stomach to make her daughter laugh again.</p><p>“Bonita!” Nicky said, her brain making the connection. She wasn’t as fluent as Rio would like, but was getting better each day.</p><p>“Buen trabajo, mi vida.” Rio gently took the flowers, walking over to the shed to grab some twine. “Crees que le gustaran?”</p><p>Nicky trailed after through the back yard. “Bonita mama!”</p><p>“Well…yes.” Rio considered, wrapping the string around the bundle and tying it off. She leaned down, handing them to her daughter. “You wanna give them to her?”</p><p>Nicky snatched the bouquet, taking off without actually answering. She followed her daughter as she climbed the stairs of the deck, hurling open the sliding glass door. Agatha was on the couch, laptop on her legs as she entered in grades. Her wife looked over at their daughter excitedly sprinting towards her. Agatha hastily moved her laptop to catch the child flying her way.</p><p>“What did I tell you guys about tracking mud in the hou-” Agatha began, their daughter breathlessly colliding with her. “<i>Mmhph</i>.”</p><p>“Mami and me got you flowers!” Nicky held up the bouquet like a prized possession. “They’re pretty like you!”</p><p>Agatha blinked before snorting, laughing and cautiously taking the bouquet. “Thank you, sweetheart.” She looked up to Rio. “Thank you, baby.”</p><p>Her wife studied the flowers, speaking to Nicky as she did so. “Do you know what kind of flowers these are, teddy?”</p><p>Nicky clueless shook her head, shrugging. “White.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha chuckled. “But they’re azaleas.” She grabbed Nicky, placing her on her lap as she explained. “They can mean love or joy, beauty, even good luck.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Ah, the curiosity stage of raising a child. Where even the most mundane or straightforward things required elaboration. If Rio had a nickel for every time Nicky asked <i>Why?</i> in a day, she’d be rich…like Zuckerberg rich.</p><p>“Because sometimes, we have <i>so</i> much to say to someone, that showing is better than telling.” Agatha told, “Like when we hug or kiss you or each other, it shows how much we love you.”</p><p>“A lot.” Nicky threw up her hands, motioning them wide. “Soooooo much.”</p><p>That came from their goodnight routine, where Agatha would do the voices in the bedtime story and Rio would tuck her in, and they’d say they love her <i>soooooo much</i>.</p><p>“Exactly.” Agatha said, giving Nicky a quick squeeze. “Should we put these in a vase?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha got up, keeping one arm around their daughter to situate her on her hip. “Let’s see if mama can keep these alive for more than a few days this time.”</p><p>“She won’t.” Rio murmured, raising her eyebrows knowingly.</p><p>“I can keep our daughter alive, can’t I?” Agatha shot back, walking into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio was about to respond when her phone rang, answering the call from her brother. “Vic, qué pasa?”</p><p>“Rio.” Her brother said, his tone already heavy. “I’m…good. Wedding planning and all that…”</p><p>She turned around, heading out onto the deck and closing the door behind her. “Who died?”</p><p>He nervously laughed. “Nobody. No one. Why’d you go there first?”</p><p>“Because you sound exactly like you did when you were twelve and threw that baseball, and shattered the kitchen window before blaming it on <i>me</i>.” Rio deadpanned. Her and her brother weren’t necessarily <i>close</i>, but they had a neutral relationship despite their parents opinions on Rio’s ‘lifestyle’.</p><p>“Papà would’ve believed it too if he didn’t think girls couldn’t throw that hard.”</p><p>“Yes, thank god for misogyny. Is there a reason you called?”</p><p>Victor sighed, guilt lacing his words. “Sofia and I finally set a date.”</p><p>“Okay…?” Rio spoke, confused as to why this required a call. “Usually people just send out those ‘Save the Date’ things.”</p><p>“I wanted you to hear it from me, I think I owe you that.”</p><p>“Owe me what?”</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, voice sullen. “Mamá and Papá said they won’t pay for the wedding if you’re invited.”</p><p>Rio momentarily pulled the phone from her ear, deciding her brother didn’t need to hear her trying not to cry. It wasn’t a shock, Rio and her parents hadn’t spoken for years, <i>especially</i> after she and Agatha got married. They didn’t see Rio’s parents on holidays, they had never met their granddaughter, and basically refused to acknowledge Rio’s existence.</p><p>There were a few things at play for Victor Sr. and Isabella. One, Rio’s sexuality. They were conservative and catholic, their ambitions for Rio stopped at her having 2.5 kids with an equally conservative and catholic man. Two, Rio’s gender presentation. Sure, she got away with being a tomboy as a kid, but once she went through puberty? Isabella spent a lot of time trying to fight Rio into being more feminine. She’d yell and cry, <i>”Mira, Rio! No man will want a woman who dresses like a boy!”</i>, until Rio agreed to whatever her mom wanted. Third, Agatha and Nicky. They didn’t particularly like that Agatha was a woman, or that Nicky wasn’t carried by Rio even if she did biologically come from her. She knew all of this, and spent most of her time trying <i>not</i> to know it. Rio didn’t regret any of the choices she had made in life, wouldn’t go back and do anything differently.</p><p>Rio choked all of that back, speaking again. “Victor, you’re <i>forty</i>, you can’t pay for a wedding on your own?”</p><p>“Sof has expensive tastes.”</p><p>“Maybe that’s because she’s twenty-eight!” Rio snapped.</p><p>“Listen, I just- I have to think about what’s best for the family. I want my kids to know their grandparents in the future. Nicola doesn’t-”</p><p>Nicola doesn’t have that, is what he stopped himself from saying.</p><p>Even at the cost of his relationship with her.</p><p>Rio scoffed, brushing away a stray tear. “Right.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Yeah, you should be.”</p><p>“We can always do a dinner, the four of us. You and Agatha, me and Sof.”</p><p>“No, I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“I don’t need to worry about you judging my family or marriage.”</p><p>“C’mon, Rio. You know <i>I</i> don’t think like mamá and papá, I’m fine with you being gay.”</p><p>“But it’s enough for you to discount me from your life.” She breathed out. “And it’s not enough for you to stand up to them.”</p><p>“That’s not fair.”</p><p>“Isn’t it?! You’ve never done anything wrong in their eyes. You’re the oldest, you’re Victor Junior. You’re the boy, the one that got all of the credit even when I out achieved you.”</p><p>“That’s just how they are.”</p><p>“Yup.” Rio tilted her head. “And you’re choosing to benefit from it.”</p><p>“Rio, please.” He whined, as if she were the one making things hard. “This doesn’t need to be a whole thing.”</p><p>“You’re right, it doesn’t. I’ll make it easier for you. Don’t worry about me or anything related to my family.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Victor said in relief. “I’ve got enough on my plate as is.”</p><p>“Great, so then this is over.”</p><p>“What’s over?”</p><p>“Our relationship. I’ve looked the other way about you spending holidays with them and pretending they haven’t disowned me, but I won’t do that any longer. Don’t worry about your sister,” Rio’s voice wavered. “You don’t have one anymore.”</p><p>“Ri-”</p><p>She jammed her thumb against the screen, shoving her phone back into her pocket. Rio opened the door just enough to shout “I’ll be in the garden!” and her wife to give an “Okay!” back. She put a lid on the fact that she had just cut off the last of her family, opting to instead focus on how her roses could be more spry.</p><p>Later that night, after doing Nicky’s bedtime routine, she laid in bed as her wife climbed in beside her. Agatha was discussing what Nicky’s ballet teacher chose as the spring recital.</p><p>“Which, call me crazy, but Nicky’s natural charm and intellect is wasted as a tree.” Agatha joked, looking over. “You’ve been quiet tonight.”</p><p>“I’m always quiet.”</p><p>“Yeah, but you’re <i>brooding</i>.”</p><p>“I am not.”</p><p>“You are.” Agatha rolled over on her side, fingers idly tracing Rio’s stomach. “Something happen?”</p><p>“Victor called.”</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>“He…he’s not inviting me to the wedding because of our parents.” Rio repeated the information, really <i>hearing</i> it. “I- I cut him off.”</p><p>Agatha’s face fell. “Oh, baby-”</p><p>“It’s fine. Just sucks.”</p><p>“He’s a prick.” Her wife’s hand came to her face, cupping her cheek. “And, you’ve always got me and teddy. Forever.”</p><p>“I know, mi amor.”</p><p>“And we love you.” Agatha leaned down, kissing her. “Sooooo much.”</p><p>Rio smiled, deciding to focus on the family she <i>did</i> have rather than the one she left behind. She grabbed Agatha’s hips, rolling them over. “Yeah, how much?”</p><p>“I’m beginning to think you need me to <i>show</i> you.” Her wife innocently batted her eyelashes. “How <i>ever</i> will I do that?”</p><p>She pushed up Agatha’s sleep shirt, sliding down the bed to nip at the stretchmarks that now adorned her wife’s hip. Agatha had always been beautiful, but something about her postpartum body just <i>did</i> things to Rio. “I got a few ideas.”</p><p>Agatha lightly pulled at her chin, tipping Rio’s head up. “Hey, <i>really</i>, are you okay?”</p><p>“I will be in time.” Rio softly said. “I don’t wanna talk about it.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha let go, relaxing against the pillow. Her wife never pushed her to talk about things when she wasn’t ready, Agatha also probably knew that Rio would warm up to the possibility of a real conversation after a few rounds. Sex, while <i>very</i> fun, was also a resource for them to be vulnerable with one another. Not to say they had to fuck in order to talk, but it did soften the both of them for deeper communication. “Well then, get to work, pretty boy.”</p><p>“Fuck.” She groaned, pawing at Agatha’s underwear. “Try to keep it down, Nicky definitely heard us last time and I had to tell her you fell off the bed and that’s why you were screaming.”</p><p>“In my defense, you <i>did</i> literally have my legs behind my head and I was coming and cramping at the same time.”</p><hr/><p>Rio was getting too fucking old to crash on couches, she realized as she woke up to the harsh light of day. After last night—</p><p>The night she had tipsily broken down about her dead child.</p><p>On the porch.</p><p>To her ex wife.</p><p>Before kissing her aforementioned ex wife.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Rio yawned, rubbing her hands over her face to try and wake up, head minimally pounding from a slight hangover. Her eyes focused on the coffee table, a glass of water and some Advil laying atop. She sat up, chugging the water and swallowing the meds, some noise coming from the kitchen. Could the sun tone it down for a second? Jesus, it was frying her brain.</p><p>There was some shuffling, her ex entering the living room with two mugs. Agatha didn’t look <i>happy</i>, but all things considered, she didn’t look completely enraged either. Agatha stopped in front of her, extending a mug. “Coffee.”</p><p>Rio cautiously took it, peering into the mug for a beat.</p><p>“It’s not poisoned.” Agatha huffed, sitting on the table in front of her, the fabric of her robe riding up just a fraction.</p><p>She didn’t allow herself to objectify the sliver of thigh, instead taking a sip. “Fuck, this is perfect. You remembered?”</p><p>“How you take your coffee?” Agatha quirked a brow. “I made it for you almost every morning for over a decade. Teaspoon of sugar, an obnoxious amount of half n’ half, cinnamon.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Least I could do before I kick you out.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I don’t want Nicky seeing you. She’ll think something happened.”</p><p>“Something <i>did</i> happen. A lot happened.”</p><p>“Yeah, and you were drunk and sad-”</p><p>“I meant it.” Rio set down the mug. “I meant everything.”</p><p>Agatha got up, waving her off. “Rio, I can’t-”</p><p>Rio followed after, pleading her case. “You kissed me back! You obviously felt something too.”</p><p>“Shock that you said Alex’s name for the first time since…I’m happy you made some progress. But,” Agatha raised her arms aimlessly, coffee swinging. “Nothing’s fixed, nothing’s different.”</p><p>“Things could be.”</p><p>“I cannot believe you are making me defend therapy right now, but nothing will change unless we keep doing that bullshit.” Her ex wife narrowed her gaze. “And are you trying to win me back? Did you think you could admit our child died and my legs would just magically part?”</p><p>No, but wouldn’t that make everything so much simpler.</p><p>“In a perfect world.”</p><p>“I won’t do that to Nicky. She’s frustrated enough as is, she needs consistency. Besides the fact that you’ve only just begun to <i>talk</i>, it’d be too hard on her.” And then, as an obvious afterthought. “And I have Wanda to think about.”</p><p>“Really? Wanda? Could’ve fooled me.”</p><p>“What the fuck does that mean?”</p><p>“Why the fuck are you with her? She treats you like shit, she doesn’t know Nicky, and she obviously can’t satisfy you!”</p><p>“She doesn’t treat me-”</p><p>“I’d <i>never</i> treat you like that. I never did. And I’ve held off smacking her out of respect for you!”</p><p>“You’ve moved on too. The one night stands and Tinder.”  Agatha tilted her head. “Sometimes it’s just nice to know someone will be there, <i>always</i>.”</p><p>Stupid fucking Tinder.</p><p>“So, you’ll marry a lukewarm body, but refuse to give me a chance?”</p><p>“Do you even want one?!” Her ex stormed into the kitchen, slamming the mug down. “You haven’t said so, you just <i>look</i> at me like that’ll fix everything! You stare and you wait because you’re so fucking chivalrous, but god fucking forbid you actually do something about it!”</p><p>“What do you want! You want me to get on my knees and beg?!” Rio shot back, genuinely trying to understand. “I tell you I love you and you get engaged. I come over and prove I’m starting to work on shit and you kick me out!”</p><p>“Fucking <i>do</i> something! You left after Alex, you were gone, you gave up!”</p><p>“You pushed me away! You didn’t want me, Agatha!”</p><p>“No, I wanted you to <i>fight for</i> me! You were too focused on pretending nothing had happened! Alex died and you couldn’t fucking deal! You shut down and <i>left</i> me in the cold!”</p><p>“How was I meant to fight, when in your eyes, I killed our kid?!”</p><p>“I <i>never</i> blamed you for killing Alex!” Agatha reared her head back. “I blame you for taking her time, for disregarding my wishes because of your own feelings.”</p><p>“Should I not feel?! Should I not have feelings about my wife staying alive?!”</p><p>“I told you what I wanted, you ignored it!”</p><p>“Do you honestly think that I made the decision <i>lightly</i>?” She asked, venomous in her tone. “Do you think it was easy for me? I knew exactly what would happen <i>as</i> it happened. I saw Alex, when Jen got her out. I saw your body hemorrhaging blood. I saw <i>all</i> of it.” Rio took a few steps forward, backing Agatha against the counter. Her hands came to rest on the counter on either side of her ex, bracketing her in. “And somewhere in the back of my mind, I was <i>sure</i> we’d move past it. I knew you’d resent me, maybe even hate me. But when you said <i>forever</i>, I thought you meant it.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were locked onto her own, overflowing with too many emotions to count. “At the time, I did too.”</p><p>“Are you going to keep punishing me? How long til’ we accept the inevitable?”</p><p>“Which is?”</p><p>“You don’t love <i>her</i>. Not like you love me, at least. And you never will.”</p><p>Agatha worked her jaw, swallowing <i>hard</i>. “That’s not true.”</p><p>“Then why’d you let me kiss you last night? Why’d you kiss me back? Why’d you call me last month just to get yourself off?” Rio lowly spoke, getting closer. “Why do you keep me coming back?”</p><p>Agatha seemed tempted for a moment, her breath hitching as she broke away, shoving past her and creating space. “Because you’re a good lay.” She pointed to the hall. “I’ll drop Nicky off later today. I’ll see you Sunday for therapy.”</p><p>Rio deflated, following the direction. She walked past Agatha, leaning in as she whispered, “The best you’ve ever had. The credit is important.”</p><p>“Oh my god, get out!”</p><p>She took her leave, shouting a quick “Heard that one before.” as she slipped on her jacket and shoes, shutting the front door behind her. Wait, damnit. Rio walked back in, rushing to the living room to grab her coffee and Billy’s dinosaur. “I’ll return the mug on Sunday.”</p><p>Agatha made a face of annoyance, but said nothing more.</p><p>“Te veo.”</p><p>As Rio stepped out into the crisp air of a winter morning, she strangely felt <i>lighter</i>. She didn’t feel cocky, per se. That’d be inappropriate considering her breakthrough was an inebriated tantrum about her dead daughter on the stoop of the love of her life, but she felt <i>freer</i>. As if she had taken the first step needed, long overdue, but a feat nonetheless.</p><p>She gingerly sipped her coffee, damn, Agatha always made it right. Maybe it was it being made <i>by</i> Agatha that made it so good. Rio ordered an Uber home, finishing her coffee by the time she got back to the loft. She showered the night off, brushing her teeth and trying to look presentable before Nicky came home. Before <i>Agatha</i> brought her home.</p><p>Rio saw the merit in her ex’s argument, because last night truly hadn’t solved anything. But for the first time in six years, there was that light at the end of the tunnel. She’d have to claw her way there, but she would do it if it meant they could reconcile. Really reconcile. It didn’t need to be sex, though that would be nice. It didn’t need to be Agatha bearing her scar, though that would be fucking heavenly. It didn’t need to be physical. She’d settle for an honest talk.</p><p>Holy shit, Rio went stiff in realization.</p><p>She <i>wanted</i> to talk.</p><p>Had the floodgates opened?</p><p>Did therapy and the death of her favorite patient finally shatter something within her?</p><p>Oh, that’s insensitive.</p><p>Agatha said Rio hadn’t fought for her–</p><p>Rio didn’t know that was fucking allowed.</p><p>Okay, fine.</p><p>She’d fucking fight.</p><hr/><p>“Do not fight for her.” Melina said, annoyed.</p><p>To her credit, she was probably bothered that Rio had shown up early for therapy on Sunday. Nicky was still in the waiting room and Rio had <i>barged in</i> needing to tell <i>someone</i> about kissing Agatha. The doctor, dumbfounded by the audacity, had said “I have other patients!”</p><p>To which she scanned the empty office and asked “Where?”</p><p>Melina gave in and heard Rio out, which is how they got here now.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Dr. Vostokoff cocked her head incredulously. “She is engaged, for one. Additionally, what if it doesn’t work out <i>again?</i> What will you tell Nicky? How will your daughter take it?”</p><p>“Doc, I can’t just <i>give up</i>. That was my problem to begin with. I’m- I’m ready to do the work.”</p><p>“You are an avoidant.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll be honest. Psych class was boring as shit and I didn’t pay attention-”</p><p>“You think with logic first.” Melina spoke, waving her pen around as she did. “You push everything down and haven’t faced <i>six</i> years of trauma, of grief.”</p><p>“Ouch.”</p><p>“Agatha is an anxious. She feels first, then calculates how to respond after. She pushes away to be two steps ahead. It is how she protects herself.” The therapist dropped her pen. “Until you are both on the same page, which you aren't, reconciliation would not be my recommendation.”</p><p>“You got that from one month of seeing us?”</p><p>“It’s only my life’s work.” Melina deadpanned.</p><p>The door opened, producing Agatha. “Why is our daughter watching Tiktok in the waiting room?”</p><p>Melina stared her down. “Close the door. Sit.”</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face, slightly offended. “Okay, you might be hot but-”</p><p>“Sit.” The doctor repeated.</p><p>Her ex rolled her eyes, huffing and stomping before sitting next to Rio, notably closer than in previous sessions. Which could mean nothing. Melina took off her glasses, rubbing her face in frustration.</p><p>“I have been practicing for nearly three decades, and in <i>all</i> my years, I have never seen a family with such messy dynamics.”</p><p>“I don’t think-” Rio chirped.</p><p>“Not a question.” Melina held up a hand. “You two have <i>so</i> much to work through and we have only just begun to see the tip of the iceberg. It is apparent to me that you both <i>deeply</i> love and care for Nicky. You are good parents.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha grinned.</p><p>“<i>But</i>, you do not talk. Nicky lashes out, anxious. Then she bolts, avoidant. Your child reflects your behavior.” The doctor continued, “Out of curiosity, how did you handle conflict while you were still married? How did you make it through difficult times?”</p><p>“Um,” Agatha’s voice pitched higher. “We- we had tools.”</p><p>“Like?”</p><p>Rio sunk further into the couch in embarrassment. “Sex.”</p><p>Dr. Vostokoff raised her eyebrows in disbelief. “So, sex was a means of communication? Not uncommon, can be useful.” She nodded to herself, connecting the fucking dots for them. “Tell me, what was the first instance of your marriage breaking down after Alex?”</p><p>“The sex going out.” Agatha answered in shame.</p><p>“So we should fuck again?” Rio asked.</p><p>“NO!” Melina shouted as if there were a flood or fire nearby. “No! What medical professional would prescribe that?!”</p><p>“I don’t know!” Rio defended. “I thought-”</p><p>“You two need to work on communicating without sex being used as a crutch. My god! You’re educated women and you cannot see this! It is clear as day!”</p><p>Agatha pouted, crossing her arms in defiance. “We haven’t even had sex in a year.”</p><p>“10 months and 26 days.” Rio corrected.</p><p>“You keep <i>count?!</i>” Agatha squawked.</p><p>“I think I’m a bit off, but yes.”</p><p>“This is not healthy!” Melina groaned. “If you two want to be together, consequences be damned, then fine!”</p><p>“I never said that!” Agatha said like a little kid who was in trouble. “I have a girlfriend!”</p><p>“Fiancée.” Rio corrected, yet again, out of spite.</p><p>Agatha nearly growled “Fiancée.”</p><p>“I should’ve stayed straight!” Melina ground out, leaning against her chair. “Lesbians are <i>so</i> emotional!”</p><p>Agatha smirked, wiggling her eyebrows. “So you play for our team, huh doc?”</p><p>“She is our child’s therapist!” Rio scolded. “And ours!”</p><p>“You are so lucky that my hourly rate is astronomical and I make boocoo bucks off you.” The doctor sighed, trying to compose herself once again. “Do not touch each other, do not initiate anything. I am serious. It would not be wise. You both are carrying an exorbitant amount of baggage that you have not unpacked. And more so, do you even want to be together? Do you see your relationship as viable?”</p><p>Well, that sucked all the air out of the room.</p><p>The tone turned heavy.</p><p>Because Rio knew her answer.</p><p><i>Yes.</i></p><p>But Agatha’s?</p><p>Rio didn’t know if she could hear her wife disregard her again.</p><p>At the lapsing and prolonged silence, Melina scoffed, pointing between the two of them. “Point made, hopefully.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha haughtily raised her chin. “Kinda ruined the vibe there.”</p><p>“Let’s bring in Nicky.” Melina muttered, picking up her pen again. “This is <i>family</i> therapy after all.” Then, under her breath, “<i>Tupiye ublyudki</i>.”</p><p>Okay, so Rio needed to translate that from Russian later, because that had to be derogatory. The rest of the session went marginally better, and by better, Rio meant that at least nobody screamed or cried. There was a moment, right at the tail end, where Nicky was explaining how Agatha wasn’t being fair. How Agatha getting engaged was selfish, and well, other things that RIo didn’t particularly <i>like</i> hearing.</p><p>“She just does whatever she wants, doesn’t even care about me.” Nicky said, sandwiched in between them again.</p><p>And Rio saw, she saw in real time her wife <i>react</i> immediately, then calculate the next two steps. She watched as Agatha tensed, then averted her gaze, then set in jaw. The initial sting, followed by the defense of shutting down.</p><p>God damnit, Melina had a point.</p><p>“Teddy, that’s not fair.” Rio stopped her daughter from saying more. “Your mom isn’t selfish for living her life.” At some point, Rio had to take responsibility for her part in everything rather than claiming that it was no one’s fault.</p><p>There was fault.</p><p>On both sides.</p><p>Rio let out a deep breath. “Mija, after Alex, I wasn’t okay. I was gone, I used work as a distraction.” Nicky looked at her, surprised Rio had said her sister’s name. “Your mom and I both had our own issues and instead of fixing them, I took the easy way out. The reason nonna was around so much afterwards was because <i>I</i> was absent. I wasn’t there when she needed me most. I should’ve said this sooner,” She looked past her daughter to her wife. “I should’ve said this sooner. We both did a lot of shit wrong, and I don’t even think I realized how it affected me until a few days ago. I was so focused on time healing every wound, I forgot that you have to actually <i>tend</i> to the wound first. I wanted to move on to spare you the pain, and in the process, I inflicted more.” Rio’s eyes landed back on her daughter. “Your mom is doing the best she can. And you can dislike Wanda, but your mom isn’t selfish. She cares about you more than you’ll ever know.”</p><p>All three sets of eyes <i>stared</i> at Rio.</p><p>Her head swiveled to look at them all. “What?”</p><p>Melina rapidly blinked. “I think that is the most I’ve heard you talk all in one go.”</p><p>Yeah, the death of a six year old will do that. “I talk!”</p><p>Agatha uncomfortably cleared her throat. “Thank you.”</p><p>“How about we end it there today? On a good note?” Melina snapped her notebook shut. “I have an opening next month if you two are smart enough to do another joint session.”</p><p>And nobody would fight that prospect, the three of them getting up and shuffling out of the office. Was there more to say? A literal fuckton. But Rio was proud of herself for taking that leap, for actually taking some responsibility. They filed out into the hallway, her daughter hugging her goodbye, the ritual of her starting her week with Agatha.</p><p>Her ex handed her keys to Nicky. “Could you go start the car, hon? We need to schedule our next session.”</p><p>Their daughter took the keys, her face holding <i>some</i> guilt. “Yeah.”</p><p>Once Nicky was out the door of the practice, Agatha fisted her hand into the hem of Rio’s shirt, all but dragging her into the bathroom. “What the hell was that?!”</p><p>Rio steadied herself, her wife letting go. “What was <i>what?</i>”</p><p>“You told our therapist we kissed, and then to make things worse, you <i>actually</i> participate in therapy?!”</p><p>“You are so fucking confusing, you know that?!” Rio snapped, feeling a lot of emotions at once. “You wanted me to fight, I’m fighting!”</p><p>Agatha popped her hip, an accusatory finger in Rio’s face. “You fucking ratted us out! And now-”</p><p>“Are you pissed that Melina knows or that you’re not <i>actually</i> pissed?” She challenged, catching Agatha’s wrist. “I watch you, Agatha. Just as closely as you watch everyone else. This engagement is already on <i>thin</i> ice, and it’s hard to ignore that hunger when I’m doing what you want me to. Right?”</p><p>Her wife tried to pull her limb back, but Rio didn’t allow it.</p><p>She pulled her close, backing her ex against the nearest wall. “Admit it.”</p><p>“Fuck you.”</p><p>“I’d bet you’d love to.”</p><p>Agatha’s tongue darted out, wetting her lower lip. “Mmh, now who’s the taker? All those women you fuck turn you into a bottom, baby?”</p><p>There it was again, that pet name.</p><p>Agatha had said it Tuesday night, even through the mental anguish Rio had noticed it. And now, again.</p><p>Rio smirked, pinning Agatha’s hips to the wall with her own, pressing herself against her ex. “We both know that you’re too fucking greedy, mi amor.” The hold she had on Agatha’s wrist dropped, opting to thread her fingers through her wife’s hair. Christ, she had missed the feel of it. “Admit it. Admit you want me. Admit this isn’t over.”</p><p>Those eyes, the ones resembling aquamarine, lingered on Rio’s before dragging down to her mouth. Her lashes fluttered as Rio’s nails raked across her scalp, lips parting, pupils dilating. “Did you even bring back my mug?”</p><p>Motherfucker.</p><p>Rio buckled her knee forward, wedging her thigh between Agatha’s. “Nope.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered, but she didn’t move. Not even a fraction.</p><p> “Why’d you bring me into the bathroom?” She leaned in, her lips brushing the shell of her ex’s ear. “It’s right there, Agatha. It’d be so easy to take. To feel. You deserve that, baby.”</p><p>Her wife’s head rolled back, landing against the wall with a light <i>thud</i>. Agatha’s chest rose and fell as if she were gasping for air, an internal struggle happening somewhere in her mind. Rio could help with that, Rio could make it so simple for her.</p><p>She placed a searing kiss just below Agatha’s ear, right on that sweet spot that made her ex weak. “When’s the last time someone made you feel <i>good?</i> Made you feel every ounce of pleasure you’re entitled to?”</p><p>A thread snapped, Agatha’s weight hitting Rio’s thigh with a soft moan. Her ex’s hands pulled at Rio’s hair, something to anchor to. She smiled against Agatha's neck, flexing her leg to give her wife something sturdier to grind on. Hips instinctively rolled, Agatha keening at the pressure which must’ve been hitting her clit the way Rio had intended.</p><p>And while she’d certainly like to do more, time was of the essence here. The seam of Agatha’s jeans was helping, her fingers scrunching in Rio’s locks. She dipped her head down, mouthing along Agatha’s throat. Luckily, her ex had opted for a loose button up with a few undone at the top, plenty of collarbone on display. Agatha had always presented more femme when they were younger but, throughout the years, had progressively incorporated more masculine styling into her wardrobe. The blazers and slacks, the button ups, all if it was so fucking delicious. She still wore dresses or skirts on occasion, dwindling back and forth between femininity and masculinity. Very fucking hot by the way.</p><p>“That’s it, cariño. Take what you need.” Rio murmured, nipping at her clavicle. These perfect little sounds dripped from Agatha’s lips, small breaths, low whimpers. Shit, Rio wished they had more privacy, she longed to hear Agatha’s actual sounds again. Loud and unrestrained.</p><p>Rio wrapped her finger around one of the belt loops on Agatha’s jeans, tugging her along and helping Agatha to get herself off on Rio’s leg. Her ex got the message, her movements becoming messier, needier. “Aw, love.” Rio cooed, “You’re so fucking desperate for it, aren’t you?”</p><p>She looked up, Agatha’s eyes were heavy and barely open, a small nod given in response. Rio victoriously grinned, placing a chaste kiss to her jaw before turning her attention to full, pouty lips. Her wife met her half way, a whine reverberating into Rio’s mouth at the first touch. Agatha’s jaw unhinged, a clear indicator that she wanted more. Rio obliged, licking into her mouth as she pulled at Agatha’s hips more incessantly. She wanted to consume her, ensure that her wife wouldn’t forget this anytime soon.</p><p>“<i>Fuck</i>.” Agatha mumbled, her voice breaking. “Oh god, baby-”</p><p>“Feel good?”</p><p>“So <i>fucking good</i>.”</p><p>“Just my thigh, mi amor? Shit, she hasn’t been fucking you right if you’re pathetic enough to hump my leg.” Rio tilted her head, a condescending tone seeping into her words. “Has she <i>ever</i> made you come, or is that right reserved for me and your own hand?”</p><p>Agatha’s hips snapped, the degradation only fueling her. “Rio.”</p><p>“Are you going to think about this for the next time? When she’s fumbling around, unable to get the job done?” And because she knew Agatha’s needs like the back of her own hand, she let her fingers slither from Agatha’s hair down to her neck, <i>squeezing</i>. “I want you to.”</p><p>Her wife’s face flushed pink, eyes glazed over with lust, black eating away any blue.</p><p>“I want you to think back to this moment that next time she’s on top of you.” Rio husked. “About me choking you while you grind against me. How fucking needy you are. How my voice drives you fucking insane. I want you to remember it all. Because we both know that’s the only shot in hell she’s going to have at making you feel anything.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck-”</p><p>“Do you have to think about me just to get wet?” Rio asked, grabbing at Agatha’s ass because…well, because she could. “‘Cause I doubt that cabrona does it for you the way I do.”</p><p>A nearly silent cry ripped from Agatha’s throat, muted by the pressure Rio had on it. “Please.”</p><p>“Does she beg for you? She know how pretty you sound when you beg? God, such a fucking waste.” It almost physically pained Rio, to know that Agatha was willingly denying herself that. “You’re so beautiful when you cry, and plead, and fucking <i>beg</i>.”</p><p>She knew her wife had to be close, Agatha’s hips becoming uncoordinated, thrusting faster and faster. Rio could also feel how warm Agatha was at the apex of her own thighs, shit, she had to be drenched by now. Rio reached up, grabbing Agatha’s jaw and disingenuously pouting. “Oh, mi vida, are you close?”</p><p>“Y- yeah.” Agatha said, breathy as her fingers nearly ripped out Rio’s hair. “So close. So, so…fucking close.”</p><p>Rio smugly curled her lips. “Admit it, then.”</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p>Rio’s hand dropped, both returning to Agatha’s hips “That’s a shame.” and <i>pushing</i> back. She removed her leg, locking her knee again. Rio peered down, the faintest wet spot on her own pants. She bitterly chuckled, running her index and middle finger over the stain and holding it up. “You soaked through.”</p><p>“What the fuck?!” Agatha hissed, clawing and trying to pull Rio back.</p><p>She took a step back, disentangling. “Don’t be mad, at least I got you farther than Wanda ever has.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped in shock. “Rio-”</p><p>“You’ll get to come when you admit this isn’t over,” She popped the digits into her mouth, the taste almost nonexistent but definitely <i>there</i>. Rio moaned, fucking aching to drop to her knees right here, right now and eat Agatha out. “Wouldn’t want to do anything untoward with a taken woman.”</p><p>Her ex stood there, gobsmacked and blue balled. “You fucking asshole!”</p><p>Once her fingers were clean, she shrugged. “Maybe your fiancée could help.” She reached for the doorknob. “Or <i>should</i>, at least.” Rio swiftly left and let the door shut behind her, wondering if Agatha would take the loss or endure the humiliation of having to rub one out in a public bathroom.</p><p>She supposed it didn’t matter. Yes, it was fucking agony not to see Agatha come in her pants from something as juvenile as dry humping, but it would pay off in the long run. Her wife needed a wake up call, one that Rio lovingly supplied. Because her ex was the type to let her frustration get bigger than her, so stubborn that it’d bite her in the ass eventually. And Rio was good at waiting, and had been doing it for long enough.</p><p>Melina didn’t know how badly this was needed, if the sex came back, so would the communication. Rio was sure of it, plus, sex with Agatha was always a bonus. She stepped out of the practice feeling great, hopeful about what was to come, namely, Agatha.</p><p>Rio stopped at her wife’s car on the way to her own, knocking on the passenger side window to speak to her daughter. Nicky rolled down the window, heat blasting. “God, took you guys long enough.”</p><p>“I need you to do a favor for me.”</p><p>Nicky’s brows furrowed. “Okay?”</p><p>“Be nicer to your mom. She’s a little….<i>pent up</i> right now. I meant what I said in there, she’s doing her best. I know you’re hurting, but that engagement isn’t going to last. Your mom is trying to do what she thinks is best, just give me some time.”</p><p>“Do I have to be nice to The Crimson Chin?”</p><p>Rio barked out a laugh. “Not my purview, I’m focused on <i>our</i> family.”</p><p>Her daughter crossed her arms, considering. “Fine, deal. But can you up my allowance for New York with nonna next month?”</p><p>“Sold.” Rio smiled, shoving her head through the window to kiss Nicky’s.</p><p>“Mami!” Nicky blanched. “I’m too old for that.”</p><p>“No you’re not, <i>princesa</i>.”</p><p>“You know I hate that name.”</p><p>Rio stood up straight again. “And yet you’ll always be <i>mi princesa</i>. Funny how that works.”</p><p>“Nerd.”</p><p>“Love you too.” Rio called back, walking to her own car and starting it. She waited to see Agatha leave the practice before pulling out of the spot, her ex looking no different; unsatisfied. Her guess was that Agatha had denied herself <i>yet again</i>.</p><p>Damn, Rio was hoping for public masturbation.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha was splayed on her back, stomach contracting, legs shaking. Her body covered in sweat as her hands burrowed in the head of hair currently bobbing between her thighs. Every inch of her on high alert as warm, soft lips sucked at her clit. She arched her back, a hand slithering up her body and grabbing her breast, methodical fingers rolling her nipple as she cried out.</p><p>Completely naked and <i>wanting</i>, holding on as though her life depended on it. She heard herself, her sounds, how they’d give a pornstar a run for their money. And yet, she couldn’t stop. Her eyes screwed shut as liquid heat swirled <i>low</i> in her belly.</p><p><i>When had Wanda gotten fucking fantastic at this?</i></p><p>Two fingers worked inside her, pumping and curling just how she needed them to. The stretch felt <i>divine</i>, her mouth dry as she gulped down oxygen. At the addition of a third, Agatha pried her eyes open. Her lips forming an ‘O’ shape as she moaned, hips undulating with need. <i>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</i></p><p>“Feel good?”</p><p>Agatha, too focused on her impending orgasm, just responded– “So, so good.”</p><p>Wanda stopped, pulling back.</p><p>She flicked her eyes down.</p><p>The hair weaved through her knuckles was <i>not</i> red.</p><p>The eyes staring back at her were <i>not</i> green.</p><p>The smirk of her ex wife, charming tooth gap.</p><p>The contracting of her walls around slender, familiar fingers. Fingers with blunt and dull nails, no acrylics.</p><p><i>Rio.</i></p><p><i>”Admit it, then.”</i></p><p>She flinched back, scrambling to the other side of the bed in shock. “Fuck!”</p><p>Rio simply blinked at her, rather curiously. Her lips still shiny, still curled up in victory. <i>”Admit it. Admit you want me. Admit this isn’t over.”</i></p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. Her heart racing more now than it had two seconds ago on the brink of climax. Fully aware she was <i>naked</i>, she grabbed at the sheets, they were the ones they had while they were still married, and covered herself. The walls were the lighter green they once were, the room bathed in a warm glow. Comforting. Safe. Like how everything used to be.</p><p>Her ex wife crawled onto the bed, a gentle hand cupping her cheek. <i>“When’s the last time someone made you feel good? Made you feel every ounce of pleasure you’re entitled to?”</i></p><p>“I- I don’t know.”</p><p><i>“I’ve missed you.”</i></p><p>Agatha’s throat constricted, bubbling with something heavier than sorrow. “I’ve missed you too. I’ve missed this.” She grabbed Rio’s wrist, holding it.</p><p><i>“Why do you keep me coming back?”</i></p><p>“I…”</p><p><i>“Why do you keep me coming back?”</i></p><p>“I-”</p><p><i>“Why do you keep me coming back?”</i></p><p>Agatha woke up drenched in a cold sweat, disjointed as she snapped up in bed. 3AM, room pitch black save for the moonlight spilling in through the blinds. Heart thrumming against her ribs, lungs heaving. She clutched at her chest, eyes wandering to the other side of the bed.</p><p>A bundle of red hair spilled out onto the pillow next to her, Wanda’s body faced away. “Babe, there’s no bassinet, there’s no baby crying. It was just a dream, go back to sleep.” Wanda slurred, half asleep.That was referring to her <i>other</i> semi-regularly occurring dream. The one where Agatha unraveled a bundled infant, only to find the bassinet devoid of her child.</p><p>She preferred the Rio dream.</p><p>Agatha got up, linen pants and wool sweater on her frame, her underwear sticking to her. Every fucking night. That same dream. It always ended the same. And Agatha never gave an answer to the Rio in her mind. Over a month since the bathroom at the therapist’s office, over a month since she’d <i>almost</i> felt something.</p><p>There’d been no more instances of touching.</p><p>She implemented rules for herself.</p><p>Number one: Never be alone with Rio. Not without Nicky or someone else there. No bathrooms, no closets, no cars, <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>Number two: Keep conversation to therapy or Nicky. Only two topics of discussion they should be having anyways. And Rio had <i>tried</i>, tried goading her, making her crack. Her ex seemed to have been growing a fancy new backbone over the past six weeks. Didn’t really help rule number one since the fighting back was inexplicably hot. Seriously, Rio being mean was arousing to a very concerning degree.</p><p>Number three: Absolutely <i>no</i> touching. None. Not a hug, not a handshake, not a push or an accidental bump. Nothing. Zip. Zero. Nada. Couldn’t tempt her if she never touched her.</p><p>Six weeks and her rules had not failed her yet, although, she would be remiss not to mention how horny breaking said rules made her. Additionally, now Rio was forbidden by an authority figure, that being their therapist. Do <i>you</i> know how satisfying it is to defy authority? Agatha sure fucking does.</p><p>However, she ignored the bigger issue. Which was why she wanted her ex wife so damn bad. Why Rio consumed her thoughts, took up space in her brain. She technically always had, always would. But that didn’t mean Agatha had to like it. In fact, it was really inconvenient.</p><p>She also kept Rio and Wanda separate, not wanting to find out if her ex was petty enough to say something incriminating to her girlfriend. Fiancée. God damnit. Wanda was her <i>fiancée</i>, it should be easier to remember that with how annoying Wanda was about planning. There was a reason Agatha eloped for her first marriage, weddings are fucking stupid and a waste of money.</p><p>But, Wanda wanted the works. Big wedding, long guest list, a whole spectacle. She was overwhelmingly traditional in that sense, much to Agatha’s chagrin. She shuffled downstairs, the house eerily absent of sound. Nicky had left for New York with Lilia yesterday, a yearly tradition. Her mom liked Broadway musicals, and Nicky liked getting out of Boston. They usually went for a long weekend as a small vacation, which was important, especially post-Alex. Agatha and her ex wanted to make sure that Nicky didn’t feel like she was living in the shadow of her younger sibling. So, missing a day of school to play hooky with her nonna was fine.</p><p>Agatha grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge, swallowing the cold water in the hopes of stoking the broiling coals inside of her. Everything about that day in the bathroom was…wrong, technically. Wanda didn’t deserve that. It was also, most unfortunately, the best she’d felt in <i>a while</i>. She considered breaking things off with Wanda afterwards, but one day didn’t change much, she needed to see Rio actually keep her word.</p><p>And for the last month and a half, her ex had. Rio had been more vocal in the past six weeks than in the past six years. Participating in therapy, challenging Agatha and pushing back. There had been one day, about a month back, where Rio picked up Nicky in a motherfucking <i>suit</i> of all things. Black, perfectly tailored,<i>hot</i>. Her ex explained she had attended Billy’s funeral and didn’t have time to change. Agatha hastily handed over their child before bolting upstairs and opening her phone and pulling up her hidden <i>R</i> folder.</p><p>Listen, Agatha knew it was bad. She is not unaware of her actions. But she needed to feel a sense of security with Rio again if she was even going to contemplate leaving her current relationship, and that hadn’t manifested yet, so, she stayed with Wanda despite the woman getting on her nerves to no fucking end. No, Agatha did not care about the difference between eggshell and cream table linens. She didn’t entertain Wanda’s whining about an engagement party or the wedding, because she was steadfast in the belief that they wouldn’t get <i>near</i> that altar until Nicky was onboard.</p><p>Or until Agatha was fully onboard, if she were to be honest with herself.</p><p>Although Nicky had been shockingly better towards Agatha, her opinion and behavior towards Wanda didn’t move an inch. Her daughter seemed to have been slowly coming around to the fact that life after Alex had been harder for Agatha than she once thought. That perhaps her mami wasn’t a saint. Obviously Nicky knew that Agatha had suffered physically and was sad for a long time, but maybe the whole ‘abandonment’ aspect made something click in the thirteen year old’s mind. No hugging occurred, but there were less meltdowns.</p><p>Therapy had <i>some</i> benefits, she supposed.</p><p>Speaking of, Agatha groaned aloud, capping her water bottle. The snow fell fast and heavy outside, a blizzard forecasted for this weekend. Perfect weather for therapy with your ex in twelve hours. On Valentine’s day of all days, dumb fucking Melina and her booked patient calendar. Yeah, who wants to go to fucking therapy on Valentine’s? She felt a smidge of guilt at first, but then Wanda told her she had a work conference in California anyway. They had gone out to dinner last night, Agatha going through the motions of playing a loving partner.</p><p>They didn’t have sex, though. Hadn’t in six weeks. Agatha chalked it up to her early onset menopause killing her libido. A lie. If anything, her libido had been on fire. Rio had messed with her mind and now she couldn’t ignore everything swirling around in there. Wanda was understanding at first, but the longer it went, the more frustrated she became. The small comments and annoyed sighs when Agatha denied her, not enough to cause an actual fight, just enough to let Agatha know she was pissed.</p><p>She looked down at her engagement ring, scowling. Maybe she just needed to recommit to her relationship with Wanda, it wasn’t fair to keep her <i>and</i> Rio on hold. Melina’s words rattled around in her head <i>Do you see your relationship as viable?</i></p><p>With Rio?</p><p>Oh, who fucking knows.</p><p>With Wanda?</p><p>Eh…maybe?</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Agatha deflated, leaning against a countertop in near darkness. She heard the creaking of footsteps coming down the stairs, Wanda sleepily walking into the kitchen with a small smile.</p><p>“Why are you up?”</p><p>Wanda yawned, grabbing the water from Agatha and taking a sip. “Monica’s picking me up for the airport in an hour. We had to move our flight up to get out of the city before the blizzard hits tonight.”</p><p>“Monica?”</p><p>“Yeah, my co-worker. I told you this, she’s like my work wife.” Wanda laughed. “We’re carpooling.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows, still tired. “Beats having to drop you off at the gate.”</p><p>Wanda’s smile faded, anxiously rolling the water bottle between her hands. “Are you going to miss me?”</p><p>“What?” Agatha forced a chuckle. “Of course I am, hon.”</p><p>“Doesn’t feel like it.”</p><p>“I’m just grumpy.” She lied. “Not looking forward to therapy this afternoon.”</p><p>“You’ve been grumpy a lot lately.” Wanda muttered.</p><p>“Is that code for ‘you won’t fuck me’?”</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>“What.” Agatha said, but not as a question.</p><p>“You won’t!” Wanda raised her hands defensively. “I know you can’t control it, but I just miss it, okay?”</p><p>“How about you make me feel <i>more</i> guilty about it? That’ll definitely yield the best results-”</p><p>“Oh my fucking god. Nevermind.” Wanda rolled her eyes, turning to leave. “I have to pack and get dressed.”</p><p>“Love you too.” Agatha sniped, rubbing her temples.</p><p>Her girlfriend whipped around, snapping. “So you <i>really</i> want to instigate shit right now?!”</p><p>And no, she didn’t, she was too fucking tired.</p><p>And not just bodily.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Wanda scoffed, turning the corner. “That’s what I thought.”</p><p>An hour later, a very nice woman named Monica collected Wanda, her girlfriend kissing her cheek like nothing had transpired earlier. “Remember to start getting your half of the invite list drafted up.”</p><p>Agatha bit her tongue, it was going to start looking like a pincushion soon. “Yup.”</p><p>“I love you.” Wanda slung her designer duffel over her shoulder, opening the door.</p><p>“You too.” Agatha said, the door shutting a moment later.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around herself, completely alone.</p><p>No Wanda. No Nicky. No one.</p><p>She climbed the stairs, intending to try to go back to sleep. When she got to the top, her eyes hovered at the end of the hall. To the right was the master bedroom, Agatha’s. A few steps down to the left was Nicky’s room, then a bathroom. And at the very end of the hall was the nursery. It had been Nicky’s when she was a baby, most of the furniture just recycled for their second child. Though they had chosen a different color scheme, repainted the walls, personalized it with different stuffies or ‘A’ decor.</p><p>Agatha might as well have sealed that door shut, welded off the hundred fifty square feet in her brain. But, her feet kept her moving towards <i>that</i> door. Her hand tremored as she turned the knob. The audible <i>creak</i> of the hinges echoed in her skull, the nursery coming into view. There was a thick layer of dust coating everything. The pale periwinkle they had chosen appeared dull on the walls, the crib still as empty as the day she came home from the hospital.</p><p>She and Rio had redone it when they first found out Agatha was pregnant, ignorant to even the possibility of something happening. Agatha slumped against the doorway, ingraining every detail that she had already memorized. The small dino plushie in the rocking chair, the changing table that remained stocked with diapers and wipes, the hand-painted <i>Alexandria</i> on the wall above the crib, done by Agatha herself.</p><p>Nicky’s color scheme was pink, they kind of went overboard on the girly girl bullshit. Sue them, it was 2012. But Agatha always associated Alex with purpley blue, perhaps because she was a winter baby and so cool toned colors made sense. Agatha’s crossed arms felt like steel against her ribcage, the pressure soothing. Her lower lip trembled, the tears welling but not falling.</p><p>She didn’t come into this room, never had the courage. One day she’d pack it up, one day she’d make something better of it. But, for now, this was enough of a step for her. Simply <i>looking</i> at her child’s room. The one made just for her, even if she was never an occupant.</p><p>Agatha sniffled, grabbing the knob and letting the latch softly <i>click</i> shut.</p><hr/><p>“Okay, see?” Jen whined. “This is why I hate being exiled! I don’t know anything!”</p><p>Rio chuckled, sat at a table in the hospital cafeteria with Jen and Alice. She glanced down at her watch, needing to leave soon for therapy. “Alice <i>isn’t</i> exiled and I only just told her a couple days back.”</p><p>Jen side eyed her wife. “And you didn’t tell me that she was having some homoerotic game of chicken with Agatha?”</p><p>Alice mumbled “Sorry.” through a bite of her muffin.</p><p>Jen scoffed but turned her attention back to Rio. “And she hasn’t cracked yet?”</p><p>“Nope.” She sighed. “Six weeks and <i>nothing</i>. I’m pretty sure she’s avoiding me whenever she’s not using our daughter as a human cockblock.”</p><p>“Damn, Raphael has her whipped.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows knitted together in confusion. “Wha…?”</p><p>“Like the ninja turtle.” Jen smiled. “And speaking of Nicky, how is my god daughter whom I never get to see?”</p><p>“She is with her nonna in New York. They’re seeing a play called Death Becomes Her?”</p><p>“Oh, a gay classic.” Jen nodded.</p><p>“I guess.” She stood, grabbing the two hot chocolates. “I gotta go get my head shrunk.”</p><p>“You go get your wife who’s already engaged to another woman!” Jen shouted in support. “Happy Valentine’s!”</p><p>“You too, lovebirds!” Rio moved both cups to one hand, using her free one to flip them off as she walked away. The snow was a pain in the ass to drive in, her SUV working its hardest not to skid. The blizzard wasn’t supposed to pick up until tonight, but at this rate, most of Boston would be snowed in way sooner. She got to the practice in one piece, careful not to lose her balance in the parking lot. Rio waltzed into the waiting room, spotting her ex in one of the chairs.</p><p>She approached, holding out a cup. “M’lady.”</p><p>Agatha peered up from her phone in confusion, grabbing the cup. “Thanks…?”</p><p>“You’re very welcome.” Rio sat beside her, sipping her own. “Thought it might brighten up the day.”</p><p>“Is it spiked with anything?” Her ex asked, popping off the lid and sniffing.</p><p>“No, of course not.”</p><p>Agatha fisted the cap back on, pouting. “That’s a shame.”</p><p>“I think I have some tequila back at home...”</p><p>“Good for you.”</p><p>Rio chuckled to herself, looking at her wife. “So, you wanna tell Melina about the bathroom, or should I?”</p><p>“We’re not telling her dick.”</p><p>“Oh? We’re not?”</p><p>“Nope. Doubt it would result in anything but another verbal lashing.”</p><p>“I still have to look up what she called us last time.”</p><p>“Stupid bastards.” Agatha answered, taking a swig of the hot chocolate.</p><p>“How do you know that?”</p><p>“Russian and Sokovian have a lot of overlap. Wanda’s big into women’s soccer, swears like a sailor at the TV.”</p><p>Ah, and back to Wanda.</p><p>“How is the fiancée?”</p><p>“Great.” Agatha said way too quickly.</p><p>“She all broken up that you’re spending Valentine’s with me?”</p><p>“She’s on a work trip, some marketing conference.”</p><p>“What could that possibly entail?”</p><p>“I don’t know. They go to a convention center, get a bunch of free shit, drink, and go home.”</p><p>“Fuck, I chose the wrong career path.”</p><p>“My thoughts exactly-”</p><p>Melina appeared in the doorway, ushering them in. “Guys.”</p><p>They both stood, reluctantly entering and taking their usual seats.</p><p>Their doctor smiled, waiting.</p><p>They stared back.</p><p>Melina clasped her hands together patiently.</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha side eyed Rio.</p><p>“What?” Her wife finally barked.</p><p>Melina crinkled her face. “I was waiting for you two to start.”</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked.</p><p>“It is your time.”</p><p>“Sounds like someone doesn't wanna do their joooooob.” Agatha sing-songed under her breath.</p><p>Rio snickered, quickly trying to hide her reaction.</p><p>“Fine.” Melina kept her mouth in a straight line. “How have things been since the kiss? Does your partner know about your infidelity?”</p><p>Agatha grimaced. “No. Why would I tell her?”</p><p>“Honesty is usually good for a relationship.”</p><p>“C’mon, doc.” Rio simpered. “That can <i>grind</i> on a burgeoning marriage. Especially ‘cause it’s me. Could <i>rub</i> Wanda the wrong way. I wouldn’t want to create a <i>hump</i> for them to have to get over. The last thing they need is a <i>rut</i>.”</p><p>Agatha choked on her hot chocolate, sputtering out “I don’t think it’d be productive.”</p><p>Melina sighed, pen in hand. “Okay, let’s come back to that. I want to get into something else today anyways.”</p><p>“Like what?” Rio tilted her head, suddenly anxious.</p><p>“I want to hear your recount of the day Alex was born.” The doctor said, no sympathy in her tone, direct.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Oh, that shouldn’t be hard, right? What, with all your <i>progress</i>.”</p><p>Rio’s face fell, giving a cold glance to her ex before responding. “Why? You heard Agatha explain everything.”</p><p>“Yes, but there are two of you. Alex was your child together. Agatha is not the only one who suffered a loss that day.”</p><p>She cleared her throat, shifting in her seat. “Uh, fine.”</p><hr/><p><b>February, 2020.</b></p><p>“Rio, wake up.” Her wife strained out. “I- I’m bleeding.”</p><p>And since Rio hadn’t slept a fucking wink throughout Agatha’s entire pregancy, she shot up and out of bed on a dime. It wasn’t a lack of love for Alex that made Rio resent the pregnancy, it was the disregard Agatha had for her own life. Her wife had spent nearly eight months incubating their child who wasn’t bound to live more than a week at best. And though Rio wanted their second child, she couldn’t justify Alex at the cost of Agatha. Rio wanted Alex, but not at the cost of Agatha.</p><p>That killed Rio on the inside, the guilt slowly gnawing at her, taking chunk after chunk out of her. Because what mother would think that way? She had worked in the medical field long enough to see the scene play out. Mother’s life sacrificed by fathers for the sake of the child. She had operated on premies who would never know their mother, never truly understand what she went through so they could breathe. She’d witnessed the husbands, teary eyed and broken, mourn his partner while simultaneously resenting his child.</p><p>Rio didn’t resent Alex, but she felt a way she couldn’t describe. Or maybe she was just too afraid to acknowledge that, internally, she’d kept her attachment to her daughter at bay. The entire pregnancy, Rio ignored the grief, put it in a dark corner along with her connection to Alex. Because their daughter wouldn’t live, and she might take Agatha with her.</p><p>Rio felt selfish, she felt evil. But all she could contemplate was how’d she tell their seven year old that mama’s not coming home. Replay in her mind what Agatha’s grave would look like, how the hell Rio was meant to raise Nicky alone. She needed her mom, Rio couldn’t be the both of them. The next twenty years flashed through Rio’s mind. Nicky’s high school and college graduation, looking for her mom in the crowd, only to find Rio standing alone. What about Nicky’s wedding? Agatha had to be there to take her dress shopping. What about grandkids? Agatha would never meet them.</p><p>And what about Rio? What if Rio needed Agatha just as badly? What if she needed her wife? They were supposed to grow old together. They were forever. The end wasn’t here yet, and Rio couldn’t go on if it was. Was that selfish? It was Agatha’s body, it was her autonomy. Rio’s rage had been at a low simmer for the better part of a year. Because Agatha had made peace with abandoning them, leaving Rio and Nicky behind.</p><p>But Rio was the strong one, the one relied upon, so she didn’t voice any of that.</p><p>She did her job.</p><p>Rio called Jen, then the hospital so that everything would be ready shortly after their arrival. She sat by Agatha’s hospital bed, knee bouncing, eyes trained on her wife’s monitor.</p><p>Jen burst into the room, trying to smile. “How are we feeling?”</p><p>Agatha, pale and trembling, pursed her lips in defiance.  “Great, I want to push.”</p><p>That had Rio standing up. “No, you’re not pushing.”</p><p>“Yes, I am. I’m here, I’m going to push.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said. “What Rio means is, you <i>can’t</i>. Not with your body already struggling to keep you and her alive. Your blood pressure alone has told us that much. If you deliver vaginally, it could be fatal to both you and her. We need to do a C-section, they’re prepping the O.R. right now.”</p><p>Agatha looked over to Rio, her voice thick. “You have to <i>promise me</i> that if I wake up, Alex will be waiting for me.”</p><p><i>If?</i></p><p>Rio’s brows knitted together. “Mi amor, you’ll wake up-”</p><p>“Not at the cost of her.”</p><p>“Alice is on standby for whatever Alex will need.” Jen placated. “She’ll be in good hands.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t let her eyes leave Rio’s. “<i>Promise me</i>.”</p><p>She <i>couldn’t</i>.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio grabbed her hand, lacing their fingers together. “Jen’s going to get Alex out, Alice will get her to the NICU, you’ll wake up.”</p><p>“Not at the cost of her.” Agatha repeated. “I want her to go knowing one of us,  and if I’m not here, then it’s got to be you.”</p><p>How was Rio expected to focus on ferrying Alex’s soul when Agatha’s would be in the balance?</p><p>“I won’t let anything happen to you, Agatha.” Rio’s eyes brimmed. “I’m not trading your life for hers.”</p><p>Her wife whipped her head over to Jen. “If anything happens, save Alex.”</p><p>Jen’s face fell. “Agatha, when you’re under, your next of kin decides. And medically-”</p><p>“I don’t care!” She hissed, suddenly feeling sick. “You save her.” Agatha’s gaze swept back to Rio, tears making her vision blur. “Please.” She whispered. “Please, my love. Please let her live. You have to-”</p><p>What about us?</p><p>“Nothing’s going to happen, cariño. You’ll be fine.” Rio gently told, trying to sound convincing. “I promise, as soon as you wake up, we can see her, okay?”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>Another pair of scrubs informed Jen the O.R. was ready, a flurry of medical personnel gathering. “We gotta go.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand, placing a kiss on her forehead. “I’ll be in the gallery. I’ll be there the whole time. Nothing bad is going to happen.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, the salt of her tears beginning to stain her skin. “I’m…I’m scared.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I want more time.” Agatha hiccupped, her fingers splayed on her swollen stomach. “I want more time.”</p><p>Rio smiled, though it was one devoid of joy. “If I could break all the rules of nature to give that to you, I would.” Her eyes flitted to Agatha’s monitor, heartbeat getting sluggish, blood pressure high. “But they’ve got to go now, any longer and neither of you-” Rio cut herself off, clearing her throat. “They’ve got to go now.”</p><p>She savored the last touch of Agatha’s fingers in hers, holding on until the bed was finally rolled far enough away. Rio made her way to the O.R. gallery, Mass Gen was a teaching hospital so observation rooms were fairly common. She didn’t like not being in the O.R. but Jen had made it clear back when they scheduled the original C-section, Rio was not permitted in there. And she understood why, Jen was worried about her being in that close of proximity and backseat operating. Emotions get in the way with surgery, the attachment can cloud judgement.</p><p>Rio took her seat, fingers clasped together, elbow resting on her knees. Seeing her wife cut open, while not ideal, didn’t bother her much. After so many years in medicine, you train yourself when to look through a medical lens. Besides, C-sections only take forty-five minutes or less. She inhaled a heavy breath through her nose, Agatha would be fine, Alex would be as fine as possible. Everyone would be <i>fine</i>.</p><p>Alice was off to the side along with a few pediatric nurses, diligently waiting for the hand off. Jen worked as quickly as she could, mindful that Agatha had already lost a substantial amount of blood on the way over here.</p><p>And yet-</p><p>Rio jumped up, fifteen minutes in and Jen hadn’t gotten Alex out, she banged on the glass. Jen peered up at her, barely shaking her head.  She bashed the intercom button. “What the hell are you doing?”</p><p>“LUS is too thick, I can’t-”</p><p>“Jen, get Alex out. Agatha is losing too much blood, I can fucking <i>see</i> it.”</p><p>“Oh, thank you, I hadn’t thought of that!”</p><p>“Agatha’s going to hemorrhage if you don’t-”</p><p>“I am aware!” Jen hissed, “The fetal malformations, Alex is too sick and the low uterine segment is too thick. If I pull Alex out now, I risk losing them both.”</p><p>“If you keep Alex in, Agatha’s gonna bleed out.” Rio barked, because either way, Agatha wouldn’t fare well. The longer she was open, the worse the outcome. Her body was too weak for the surgery to begin with.</p><p>Alex wouldn’t have more than a day with how premature she was, those hours would be spent in unending pain. And shouldn’t a mother protect her child from that? From agony?</p><p>“I can’t let Alex die.”</p><p>“You can’t let <i>my wife</i> die!”</p><p>“Agatha said-”</p><p>“Jen!”</p><p>“Agatha said-”</p><p>Rio set her jaw, making the decision before she realized she had. “Agatha is unconscious and I am her next of kin. I am telling you to save her. Legally and medically, you know I am right. Viability and quality of life. You are under an obligation to listen to my wishes. You save <i>Agatha</i>. Now!”</p><p>“And there’s the hemorrhage." Jen looked up one more time, shoulders slumping. “Alice, get ready.”</p><p>Shit, Rio had to get down there. If Alex wasn’t going to make it for Agatha, Rio had to be there for their daughter. She took off, sprinting down a floor and into the O.R., Alex had to go knowing one of them. If she hadn’t respected Agatha’s first wish, she’d try like hell to respect this one. She grabbed a mask, a cap, and a gown, throwing them on, running through the doors.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a beat, opening them and still seeing her worst nightmare. Rio walked past Agatha on the table, Jen shouting too many orders all at once. Honestly, the whole world sounded like white noise. Going deeper and deeper into the room, approaching Alice standing over Alex. And it was already over. Rio couldn’t have been more than a minute or two, but Alice–</p><p>Her best friend, voice shaking, uttered “Time of death,” and peeked at the clock on the wall. “<i>11:11</i>.”</p><p>The irony in angel numbers.</p><p>The cruelty.</p><hr/><p>Rio dug the heels of her palms into her eyes, trying to stop the sobs. “Fuck, sorry.”</p><p>Melina handed her a box of tissues. “It is okay.”</p><p>Agatha’s face was streaked with tears, her teeth gnawing at her lower lip.</p><p>“I would’ve crawled on my hands and knees, begging to the gods to have another way.” Rio said, voice breaking. “But, I- I couldn’t- I couldn’t let Agatha die.”</p><p>“What happened after?”</p><p>“Uh, Agatha got some blood transfusions-”</p><p>“Not to Agatha. To you.”</p><p>“I held her.” Rio nearly whispered. “Hoped that she’d still feel it somehow.”</p><p>Agatha sniffled, silent.</p><p>Melina looked at her ex wife. “Have you ever heard Rio’s side before? From start to finish?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha swallowed. “I knew she held Alex but, I guess I filled in the blanks myself.”</p><p>“I also didn’t correct it.” Rio added.</p><p>The doctor bounced her gaze between the two. “So, Agatha blames herself for Alex’s illness, Rio blames herself for Alex’s death.” She tilted her head, eyes narrowing. “Do you blame each other for either of those things?”</p><p>“Of course not.” Rio answered.</p><p>“No.” Agatha responded.</p><p>“Agatha,” Melina zeroed in. “Do you think you might harbor a grudge over Rio’s denial of your autonomy?”</p><p>“It was a necessary surgery-”</p><p>“Medical or not, the body holds trauma.” Melina interrupted. “So do you?”</p><p>Agatha wiped her face, looking down at her lap. “Yes.”</p><p>“Rio, you mentioned feeling resentful of Agatha. Do you think you still feel that way? You were scared and angry that she was at peace with dying, did you feel left behind?”</p><p>“I understood where she was coming from-”</p><p>“Did. You.”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio croaked. “And I think I still do.”</p><p>Melina opened her mouth to speak, a blaring alarm sounded out from all three of their phones. Everyone scrambled for their devices, the national weather service declaring the blizzard unsafe and urging people to stay home, along with road closures being released. Rio groaned, Agatha’s own following.</p><p>The therapist sighed. “Okay, it looks like we have to cut this session short. Not ideal considering I’m sure you’re both feeling very vulnerable. I promise, I will schedule another one in a few days, even if I have to stay late. However, unless we all want to be snowed in together, I suggest we hightail it out of here.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha’s voice clipped, throwing on her jacket. “Thanks.”</p><p>Rio steadied herself, standing and following her wife out. “Will you get home alright, Dr. Vostokoff?”</p><p>“Oh, I live around the corner. Why do you think I take patients on the weekend?”</p><p>“Goodnight.”</p><p>“Get home safe.”</p><p>Rio caught up with Agatha, looking out the double doors of that practice at the snow whipping around. “Fuck, that picked up fast.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, palm out. “Give me your keys.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I’ll drive you home. Your car will do better on the roads anyways.”</p><p>“I- I can drive.”</p><p>“No, you can’t. You’re crying. Just,” She made a ‘gimme’ motion with her hand. “Let me take you home.”</p><p>“I’m fine, I promise.”</p><p>“Rio,” blue eyes like stained glass burrowed into her. “I don’t want you to be alone right now. I know how it feels, it sucks. The thoughts that come after reliving that day, they-” She sucked in a breath. “I don’t want to be alone. Just give me your damn keys.”</p><p>“How will you get home?”</p><p>“Guess I won’t.” Agatha shrugged. “There are worse places to be trapped. Plus, I hear there’s tequila awaiting me.”</p><p>Rio weakly smiled, finally giving her wife the keys. “Don’t kill us.”</p><p>“I’m a good driver!”</p><p>“No, baby. You’re not.”</p><p>“So you don’t want me to donuts in the parking lot? The adrenaline will make you forget your sadness.”</p><p>“My car is insured but that’s not a free pass to crash it.”</p><p>Agatha opened the door, wind howling. “No, I think it is.”</p><p>“Agathaaaaa-”</p><p>“I’m joking!” She grinned. “...A little.”</p>

<p>“Hon, please be careful with the knife! I know it’s plastic, but-” Agatha gave up halfway through that request, watching as Nicky chased her mami around with a fake knife. Agatha snorted as Nicky, currently dressed as Wednesday Addams, successfully stuck Rio with the tip of the faux blade, causing it to retract.</p><p>Her wife, dressed in a pinstripe Gomez suit, gasped, pretending to fall. “Mi vida! Whyyyyy?”</p><p>Nicky laughed, jumping up and down. “Mami, get up.”</p><p>Rio sat up, fixing her pocket square and running a hand through her slicked back hair. “Just for the future, you can’t stab people and tell them to get up. It’s rude.”</p><p><b>October 31st, 2018.</b></p><p>Agatha playfully rolled her eyes, waltzing into the living room, her Morticia gown half done in the back. “My love, I need a zip.”</p><p>Rio looked over at her, eyes going wide as she clutched her chest. “<i>Cara mia</i>.”</p><p>“Calm down, Gomez.” Agatha grinned, turning around for her wife to get the rest of the dress closed. “Can’t go trick or treating like this.”</p><p>Her wife came over, zipping the dress the rest of the way and placing a chaste kiss to her neck. “You look beautiful, mi amor.”</p><p>“Worthy of dying for?” She quipped.</p><p>“What bliss as long as it was by your hand.”</p><p>“<i>Really</i> leaning into the character, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio spun her, grabbing her waist and pulling her in and lowly speaking against her lips. “Specifically the Raul Julia interpretation.”</p><p>“Aw, what a shame. And here I am, a little more Tim Curry under the dress.”</p><p>“Like…Dr. Frank n’ Furter Tim Curry?” Rio’s voice strained, turned on.</p><p>“Mmmh,” She winked. “Stockings and corset and all, baby.”</p><p>Agatha and her wife usually went big for Halloween. The house decked out and decorated, elaborate costumes, even more elaborate lingerie. It was their holiday. They had lucked out that Nicky liked it too, the free candy most likely helped.</p><p>“Fuck.” Her wife kissed her, then again. “I-”</p><p>“Eww.” Their six year old whined, not amused by her parents in the slightest. “Can we gooooo?”</p><p>Rio let go of Agatha, collecting herself and straightening her lapel. “I suppose this is what we get for dressing you as Wednesday.”</p><p>“C’mon, teddy. Let’s get you irresponsibly high on sugar.” Agatha laughed, grabbing her daughter’s jack-o-lantern themed candy bucket.</p><p>“Mama,” Nicky protested, “The fake blood!”</p><p>“Ah,” She nodded. “How could I forget?”</p><p>Agatha walked into the bathroom off the den, grabbing the tube of fake blood. She crouched down in front of her daughter, dabbing a bit on her cheeks, which in turn, made Nicky manically grin. “Definitely the cutest serial killer on the east coast.”</p><p>“Yay!” Nicky ran over to the closest mirror, observing the new addition.</p><p>“Are we bad parents? She seems <i>really</i> into this.” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. “I think it means we’re raising a really cool person.”</p><p>“Let’s go!” Nicky declared, grabbing one of Agatha’s hands and one of Rio’s, tugging. “I wanna see Kamala’s costume and stab her!”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha frowned. “Maybe don’t phrase it like that…”</p><p>“Told you so.” Rio muttered.</p><p>After a couple hours trick or treating and shivering their asses off, they returned home. Lilia met them there, dressed in a costume of her own despite just babysitting. Agatha opened the front door to her mom in a big pink dress, crown on her head. “Oh, Galinda-”</p><p>“Glinda.” Lilia corrected. “She changed her name after-”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.” Agatha motioned her inside. “I’m more of an Elphaba girl myself.”</p><p>Lilia walked in, Nicky bounding up to her. “Nonna! I got so much candy.”</p><p>Her mom leaned down, wiping some chocolate off their daughter’s chin. “I see that. You’re going to crash <i>so</i> hard tonight, bambina.”</p><p>“Should be a pretty easy gig, then.” Agatha said, shouting up the stairs for her wife. “My love! Let’s go!” She then knelt down, arms outstretched. Her daughter flung herself into her mama’s hold. “I love you, baby. Sooooo much. Be good for nonna, hm?”</p><p>“I love you too, mama.” Nicky said, arms strangling Agatha. “Soooo much.”</p><p>Rio jogged down the stairs, looking no different even though she said she was going to change. “I’m ready.” Her wife hugged Nicky goodbye, giving the same farewell that Agatha had. “And no stabbing your grandma.”</p><p>Nicky pouted. “Okaaaay.”</p><p>Lilia nudged Nicky’s shoulder. “Wanna watch The Nightmare Before Christmas and pig out on the couch?”</p><p>That cheered up their daughter, suddenly sprinting towards the living room. “Yeah! Yeah!”</p><p>“Have fun tonight.” Lilia smiled, following Nicky. “There’s a grandma tax, teddy! Hide your Snickers now or forever hold your peace!”</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they were at Jen and Alice’s for a Halloween party. Jen and Alice threw one every year without fail, a great excuse for a date night. Agatha and her wife didn’t get out much, not after having Nicky. A lot of gay culture was surrounded by drinking and nightlife, which Agatha had absolutely participated in when she was younger. But now, she was more than content to stay in her happy little domestic bubble.</p><p>Agatha was in the kitchen talking to Jen, who was dressed as Donna Summer, when she felt her wife come up behind her. First it was Rio’s hand, then it was her <i>bulge</i>, and ah, that’s what she was doing upstairs before Lilia came over.</p><p>She kept focused on what Jen was saying, leaning into the hold inconspicuously, nodding along. “Jesus Christ."</p><p>Jen was wildly gesturing her hands. “The <i>biggest</i> baby I have ever delivered. Twelve pounds!”</p><p>Agatha grimaced. “That poor woman’s vagina…”</p><p>“Mi alma,” Rio whispered in her ear. “Bathroom.”</p><p>“I know! And her husband-”</p><p>“Jen.” Agatha cut in, feigning an apologetic tone. “Gimme a sec, we need to call ma and make sure Nicky went down alright.” Not waiting for an answer and hauling her wife away and into the nearest bathroom. “You couldn’t wait?”</p><p>Rio had positioned Agatha against the counter, immediately pawing at her dress. “I behaved all night, you’re driving me fucking <i>insane</i> in this costume.” She said, mouthing along her neck.</p><p>Agatha smirked, letting Rio have her fun because she <i>adored</i> being worshipped. She held the back of Rio’s head as the other woman moved lower, licking over her collarbones. Her breath hitched at the exact same moment she said “I think we should have another kid.”</p><p>She had been thinking about it for the past year, she just hadn’t brought it up. She knew how her wife would feel, unsure if Agatha should carry another child when they’d had so much trouble conceiving Nicky.</p><p>Rio looked up, bewildered. “What?”</p><p>“We always said kids. Like, multiple.”</p><p>“Did the twelve pound baby story make you-”</p><p>“No,” Agatha chuckled. “No. I just love you and I love our daughter, and I love our life. Imagine another you running around. Imagine Nicky as a big sister. We still have those two embryos waiting on ice.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio’s brows furrowed. “Do you remember how hard pregnancy was on you the last time?”</p><p>“Do <i>you</i> remember how horny I got?”</p><p>“Baby, I just- just don’t want you to go through all that again. Plus, you’re getting older-”</p><p>“What the fuck?! I’m thirty-five, that’s hardly barren.”</p><p>“No, I know. I just mean that you were younger with Nicky and those nine months were still rough.”</p><p>“Maybe it’ll be different this time.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look convinced, worried even.</p><p>Agatha’s hand snaked away from Rio’s head and down her neck, then her torso, finally reaching her crotch. She cupped the bulge, her voice a sultry purr. “You remember how good I looked when I was pregnant? You couldn’t get enough.”</p><p>“<i>Fuck</i>.” Rio whimpered. “This- this isn’t fair.”</p><p>“When do I ever play fair, handsome?”</p><p>“This is not a yes.” Her wife defended, face flushed. “I’ll think about it.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, slowly dropping to her knees and reaching for the zipper of Rio’s trousers. “You think all you need to, baby. I can be <i>very</i> persuasive.”</p><hr/><p>“Okay, thanks ma.” Agatha said, hanging up the phone and throwing it onto Rio’s kitchen island. The drive, however short, was a pain in the ass. But, for the record, Agatha didn’t get so much as a scratch on that car. “Ma said she’s good, Nicky’s good. They’ll probably be stuck at their hotel for the foreseeable future, but at least they got to see the show first.”</p><p>Rio was at the fridge, yanking open the freezer drawer and pulling out the tequila. “Wanda reach out yet?”</p><p>She shook her head, not shocked. “Nope. She’s probably drunk and enjoying the sun.”</p><p>“Mmh.” Her ex hummed, then opened the fridge door. “I think I have some OJ in here…”</p><p>Agatha sat at the island, weighing her options. Technically, she had only broken one of her rules. There had been no discussion of topics outside of Nicky or therapy, and they hadn’t touched, not once. Yet, both of those rules would probably be broken if she drank. See, tequila always had this adverse effect of making Agatha need to get naked and laid, Rio knew that and had benefited greatly from this fact throughout their marriage.</p><p>“You got any food?” Agatha asked. “It's six and I’ve barely eaten anything all day. Best not to drink on an empty stomach.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio blinked, eyes still bloodshot. “Um, yeah. Good idea.”</p><p>She wasn’t going to harp on Rio’s tears, she knew her ex didn’t like it pointed out. Agatha couldn’t even explain why she had offered to take her home, some compulsion she couldn’t ignore. She knew what it was like to be alone with the thoughts Rio was currently having, and had been alone with them for six years. She just felt some need to make sure Rio was okay, that she wasn’t isolated. Back when Agatha was isolated, she–</p><p>Not important.</p><p>“I have a vegan pizza somewhere in the freezer.” Her ex offered. “Sorry, I need to go grocery shopping.”</p><p>“You’re not vegan…”</p><p>“I know but I saw it and thought I’d make a change…I did not.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Fine with me.” She got up, wandering around her daughter’s second home. Despite Rio having lived here for three years, Agatha wasn’t too familiar with the space. Besides dropping off Nicky from time to time, she didn’t spend much time here. Her hand brushed along the bookshelves in the open floor plan of the living room, some works she recognized, others she didn’t. There was also a massive shelf unit with many a LEGO set on display.</p><p>Agatha pointed to the Titanic, calling over. “You weren’t lying. This shit looks like a headache.”</p><p>“I actually did lie.” Rio called back, preheating the oven. “It was nine thousand pieces, I just didn’t want to sound like a nerd.”</p><p>“Right, and five thousand is so much <i>sexier</i>.” She grinned, hearing her ex chuckle in response. Agatha kept walking, her sock-clad feet making the floorboards creak below her, finding her ex’s media center. Cassette tapes, vinyl records, CDs, any physical media were stocked along the expansive shelves. She knelt down, scanning the collection, most of them bought while they were still married.</p><p>She wedged her index finger between two CDs, pulling one out. Agatha stood again, holding up her finding. “You kept it.”</p><p>Rio peeked over her shoulder, giving a nod. “Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>“Because it’s our wedding song.” Agatha answered. Well, the CD itself was a ‘Best of Frank Sinatra’ album. The song she was referring to was <i>My Way Of Life</i>, the song bellowed through the casino hall at their shitty little resort after they got hitched. Vegas and Frank Sinatra impersonators, she couldn’t explain it. Other than Elvis, Frank was synonymous with the city.</p><p>“Still plays, figured there was no reason to get rid of it.” Rio popped the pizza in the oven, shuffling over. Her ex took the CD, putting it into the player. Rio fiddled with the sound before turning it up. She skipped to the correct song, holding out her hand. “Wanna see if we still got it?”</p><p>“Still got it?” Agatha raised her brows. “By that, do you mean that you can drunkenly dip and almost drop me?”</p><p>“I didn’t almost drop you,” Rio grabbed her, an arm around Agatha’s waist, her hand clasped around Agatha’s. “I added a romantic flare.”</p><p>The music started playing, Agatha ignoring that she had now broken rules two <i> and</i> three. Slinging an arm around Rio’s shoulders and relaxing her hand in Rio’s grasp.</p><p><i>Gotta have you near all the time<br/>
With your dreams wrapped in mine</i></p><p>“You almost dropped me, you can admit it. It’s been nearly two decades.” Agatha cackled, feeling Rio press her close and begin moving to the music.</p><p><i>Nothing in the world that I do<br/>
Means a thing, without you</i></p><p>“I bought this CD in the gift shop.” Rio answered, as if Agatha wasn’t by her side while she did so. “I thought the song was so perfect. I thought it was fate.”</p><p><i>You are my way of life<br/>
The only way I know<br/>
You are my way of life<br/>
I'll never let you go</i></p><p>“You don’t believe in fate.” Agatha noted, forgetting about the proximity while she looked into honeyed eyes.</p><p><i>Never let you out of my sight<br/>
Be it day, be it night<br/>
You belong to me that's the way it has to be</i></p><p>“Yes, <i>I do</i>.” Her ex quietly admitted. “Because how else do I justify the last eighteen years?”</p><p>Agatha sadly smiled. “You think Alex was fate?”</p><p>“God, I hope not.”</p><p><i>I don't need the crowd at my door<br/>
The applause from the floor<br/>
All I need is you and the love that we once knew nothing more</i></p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because that means we were fated to end, and even if we’ve been over, I can’t accept that.” Rio’s voice quivered, the hand on the small of Agatha’s back tensing.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, not accusatory but curious. “You didn’t fight for me, though. You left me all alone.”</p><p><i>You are my way of life<br/>
The only way I know<br/>
I'll never let you go<br/>
Because I love you so</i></p><p>Rio tucked her cheek against Agatha’s. The eye contact was gone as they danced, but Rio’s voice pressed against her ear. “I thought I’d already lost you.”</p><p>“You-” She spoke so quietly, “You didn’t mourn Alex. You didn’t grieve for her.”</p><p>“I didn’t know that I could.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back, tilting her head in question.</p><p>Rio explained. “You carried her, Agatha. You went through the most bodily trauma. She was yours-”</p><p><i>You are my way of life<br/>
The only way I know<br/>
Make me your way of life<br/>
Don't ever go</i></p><p>“She was <i>ours</i>.” Agatha interrupted. “She was <i>our</i> daughter. I wanted you there.”</p><p>The instrumentals swelled, lights flickering for a beat.</p><p>“Didn’t feel like it.”</p><p>Agatha let go of Rio’s hand, cupping her ex’s cheek. “I <i>wanted</i> you there.” Her ex wife’s hands snaked around her waist, pulling her as close as possible, their face naturally gravitating towards one another.</p><p><i>You are my way of life<br/>
The only way I know<br/>
You are my way of life<br/>
I'll never let you go</i></p><p>Rio leaned in, her nose brushing Agatha’s, their breaths shared. “I should’ve fought.”</p><p>And maybe it was their wedding song, maybe it was therapy, but Agatha found herself leaning in too. The lights flickered again, the music stuttering, not that either of them noticed. The snow and wind banged against the glass of the windows, a stark contrast to how she was currently warm and wrapped up in Rio.</p><p>“I shouldn't have pushed you away.” Agatha whispered.</p><p>And just as her resolve was about to <i>snap-</i></p><p><i>Never let you out of my sight<br/>
Be it day-</i></p><p>The lights shut off completely, swallowing them into darkness.</p><p>The music silenced.</p><p>Agatha looked up instinctively, the overhead lights now dead. “Shit.”</p><p>Rio let her go, pulling out the flashlight on her phone. “Well, there goes dinner.”</p><p>“It was probably going to taste like cardboard anyway…” She followed suit, cautiously walking over to the island and grabbing her phone. “Candles?”</p><p>“Um, I have a few in my room. The others are stowed away in some fucking closet somewhere.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat constricted, her brain shifting gears from a minute ago. “Okay, I’ll grab the ones from your room, you hunt down the others.”</p><p>“Got it.” Rio agreed, awkwardly disappearing down the hall.</p><p>She exhaled, rushing up the stairs. What the fuck was that? The dancing and their fucking <i>wedding song?!</i> Openly talking about Alex?! What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck. Agatha found her ex’s room, minimalist but drenched in earth tones. Yeah, that checked out. She spotted a few candles on the dresser, pinching them between her fingers. She halted at the picture atop the dresser.</p><p><i>Halloween, 2018</i>, when they were a happy family. Before Agatha proposed a second child, before Rio had agreed. The way they looked at each other in that photo–</p><p>Did they look at each other like that still?</p><p>Had Rio had this picture on her dresser all these years?</p><p>Did she have more?</p><p>“Found ‘em!” Rio shouted from downstairs.</p><p>“Yup!” Agatha yelled, “Me too!” She met Rio back downstairs, shoving the candles onto the island and immediately reaching for the tequila. “Okay...”</p><p>“What-”</p><p>Agatha threw the cap, taking a pull and wincing. Fuck, after having kids, liquor really burned. She swallowed, handing the bottle to Rio as she choked down the healthy shot. “Lighter?”</p><p>Her ex stared for a beat, but must’ve felt the same. Rio knocked back the bottle, grimacing. “This is why I proposed the OJ.”</p><p>Agatha nervously mussed her hair, something to do with her hands. “Yeah, so…lighter?”</p><p>Rio handed back the booze, scurrying around from drawer to drawer. “Damn it.”</p><p>“Mmmh?” Agatha questioned, already taking another shot.</p><p>“I can't find one.” Rio sighed, rummaging more and more. “I think- Ah! Here!” She came back over, handing Agatha a matchbook of many.</p><p>Agatha took it, looking down at it, one of those that bars give out. She looked up, a disbelieving chuckle leaving her lips. “This is from Emmet’s.”</p><p>The bar they had first met at.</p><p>They stopped giving out matchbooks <i>years</i> ago.</p><p>“Yup.” Rio nodded, taking the bottle, a matchbook, and a few candles. “I’ll disperse a few around.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha said, slightly dumbfounded. She distracted herself by placing a few candles in the kitchen.</p><p>Did Rio just keep everything related to their marriage? What kind of sentimental hoarder was her ex wife? And why the fuck was it so endearing?</p><p>So, Agatha struck a match.</p><p>Physically <i>and</i> internally.</p><p>Vowing not to play with fire had obviously gotten her nowhere, so, why not see what happens? Rio seemed more open than she ever had been before. They were definitely making progress…right?</p><p>Agatha blew out the first match once the candle was lit, repeating the same process a second time. She hopped up on the counter and waited for Rio to return, her ex coming back a minute later.</p><p>“Okay, the living room and hall are lit. I also put one in the bathroom.”</p><p>Agatha took back the tequila, decidedly taking a small sip. “What do you think Melina would say if she saw us right now?”</p><p>Rio lightly laughed, leaning on the counter next to her. “Um, probably call us dumb cunts or something.”</p><p>“Tupiye pridurki.” She said, her accent mimicking their therapist’s. “Means dumbasses.”</p><p>“Ooohhh, say it again baby.” Rio smirked.</p><p>The alcohol was doing its job, her chest feeling kind of warm and fuzzy.</p><p>Or maybe that was Rio.</p><p>“Or, uh, dalbayoby.” She grinned. “Fuckheads.”</p><p>“Russian suits your tongue.”</p><p>“Mmh, my tongue is <i>very</i> talented.”</p><p>Her ex’s face flushed, she could see it even in the dim lighting. Rio swallowed, slowly gravitating to stand in front of her. “Don’t have to remind me.”</p><p>Oh, that fucking metaphorical match in Agatha’s hand, the smoke coiling around her hand. She cleared her throat, her legs relaxing and parting, innocently leaving space for any human that should want to stand between them. “You still think about my tongue?”</p><p>“I still think about a lot of you.” Rio said in earnest, her hands delicately placing themselves on Agatha’s thighs, body between her legs. “Do you think about me?”</p><p><i>I dream of you.</i></p><p>“Far too often.” Agatha admitted, “You- you kinda root yourself, right in the back of my brain. You <i>haunt</i> me.”</p><p>“I <i>haunt</i> you?”</p><p>“You <i>linger</i>. You’re always there, always will be.”</p><p>“Do you say that with contempt?”</p><p>Agatha felt every atom in her body stand on edge as she spoke. “No. No, I tried hating you, <i>really</i> hating you for a long time after.” She gently shook her head. “Didn’t stick.”</p><p>“Why not?” Amber eyes bore into her, so pure in their pursuit for answers.</p><p>Agatha huffed, overwhelmed and too fucking hot. She pulled off her sweater, throwing it onto the island behind her, leaving her in a tank top. “The electricity is out, how the hell is it so damn hot?”</p><p>See?</p><p><i>Tequila.</i></p><p>“Back up generator keeps the heat on.” Rio didn’t waver in her questioning. “Why not?”</p><p>That smoke? The one coiling around her knuckles, around the open flame of the match?</p><p>“Because,” God, she felt defeated. Surrender seemed so much better. “Because–”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Engulfed that flame, dropping right onto the wick and reigniting a fire she had long since smothered out.</p><p>“Because this <i>isn’t</i> over.” Dripped from her lips, a confession she never thought she’d utter. “I don’t think it ever was.”</p><p>And there was no further discussion, just Rio’s lips on hers. One hand gripping her thigh, the other already carding into her hair. Agatha returned the kiss, eagerly. It felt like more than coming home, it felt more than right. It felt inevitable, that Rio’s taste and touch was something written in Agatha’s fucking marrow. Her fingers groped at her ex’s waist, trying to get as flush as possible.</p><p>Rio’s tongue swiped against her bottom lip, Agatha happily complying and moaning at her wife consuming her. The world could wait, it was under siege anyway. She reached down for the buckle of Rio’s belt, hastily undoing it. Fuck, Agatha needed more, she need her <i>wife</i> back, she needed Rio again. And not just physically, but emotionally. She’d been denying herself out of spite and forgotten, or perhaps ignored, just how good she could feel.</p><p>And just like that, without another thought or trace–</p><p><i>Combustion.</i></p><p>Agatha waited for the guilt, was preparing to feel like the most awful person to ever live, but it never came. Wanda was in a different state, in a different timezone, drunk and bathing in the fifty degree weather. Plus, it was Valentine’s day after all…</p><p>Rio grabbed, she fucking dragged, Agatha to the edge of the counter. Agatha threw her arms around her wife’s shoulders in response, neither of them daring to break the kiss. Well, <i>kiss</i> was putting it kindly. More accurately, they were making out like horny teenagers. It was all tongue and teeth and jaw, a desire or a connection simply lying dormant for a year. Her brain felt deliciously blank, it usually did whenever they did this.</p><p>However, unlike the last several times they had fucked since their divorce, Agatha didn’t have that voice of caution in her head. The one that said to not show how much she wanted this, the vulnerability of the night had already softened her. The barrier of distrust had receded, letting Rio’s hands mold her because, honestly, she knew her wife would take care of her.</p><p>Rio dropped her head down, kissing and nipping along the expanse of Agatha’s throat. Which she allowed, having missed the worship more than she realized. Her hands twisted in Rio’s shirt, a strangled “<i>Baby–</i>” escaping from her mouth. Subconsciously her hips began grinding against the front of Rio’s jeans, something, literally anything, to ease the increasing ache in between her thighs.</p><p>“I know, cariño.” Rio rasped in between soft bites and harsh kisses, working towards Agatha’s collarbones. “I know.”</p><p>No, Rio didn’t know. Because as of right now, Agatha needed to be thrown against a wall, but she’d settle for through a mattress. “Touch me.”</p><p>Her wife’s fingers fumbled with the button of Agatha’s pants for a moment before undoing the closure. Rio’s hand hesitated, nearly all-black eyes peered up at her, a small “My- my hand might brush <i>it</i>. Like, over your tank.”</p><p>“‘S fine.” She breathed out, the seclusion of her scar was not her top priority. “You can take it off, if you want…”</p><p>Again–</p><p><i>Tequila.</i></p><p>Rio sobered a bit, pulling away fractionally so Agatha wouldn’t miss a word. “I want you to make that decision when you know the full weight of it.” Her wife’s voice was thick and honest and all too tender. “It means something to you. I don’t want to take advantage of that and have you regret it tomorrow.”</p><p>Why did that make her want to take her shirt off <i>more</i> than she did a second ago? But Rio was most unfortunately a gentleman, and right in her justification. So, Agatha nodded, instead leaving Rio’s body for just a minute to tuck her thumbs under the straps of her tank top, pulling it down and letting it pool at her ribs. She usually didn’t allow Rio access to any part of her torso, but this step felt safe. It was <i>her</i> choice. Her wife’s eyes lit up like she’d just won the jackpot, a huge grin on Rio’s face.</p><p>“It’s fine if you brush it, just please <i>fuck me</i>.” She whined, her hands returning and desperately grabbing, one in particular pushing the back of Rio’s head towards her chest. “<i>Por favor, mi amor. Te necesito.</i>” <i>Please, my love. I need you.</i></p><p>Yeah, no more encouragement was needed, especially when it came to Agatha speaking Spanish. She didn’t do it often anymore, maybe as another way to sever her connection to Rio. Aside from speaking it with her daughter once in a blue moon, Agatha had ceased. She also wasn’t as fluent as Rio or Nicky, but that didn’t mean she didn’t remember how.  Rio’s hand <i>finally</i> sheathed itself inside Agatha’s underwear at the exact same moment her lips landed on one of her tits.</p><p>Her wife murmured “Estás empapada–” around her nipple before sucking the hardened nub, skilled fingers lightly working her clit. <i>You’re soaked</i></p><p>“<i>Fuck</i>.” She keened, wrapping her legs around Rio’s hips and digging her nails into her love’s back. Shit, even this, which was basically just their fucking foreplay, felt <i>amazing</i> compared to anything in the last year. “Te extrañe, te extrañe   esto.” <i>I missed you, I missed this</i></p><p>Rio switched to the other breast, hand palming the one she had just lavished. She looked up momentarily, a thin, glistening string of spit connecting her lips to Agatha’s nipple. “I missed you too, <i>so much</i>.” Rio said, fingers dipping ever so slightly at Agatha’s weeping entrance. “You want it?”</p><p>Stupid fucking question.</p><p>Agatha angled her hips, trying to give Rio the most access possible. “Please, please. Please, I want it.” She nearly cried, “Please, please, please…”</p><p>“I’ve barely done anything and you’re already begging?” Rio pouted, “Aw, <i>pobrecita</i>.” She sunk one finger in, smirking at Agatha’s resulting gasp. “Was I the last one to properly fuck you?”</p><p>One measly finger and she was already vibrating, Agatha used to have some fucking dignity. “Yes–”</p><p>Rio pumped a few times, returning with a second digit. “Shit, you’re swallowing me, baby.”</p><p>The stretch alone had Agatha gulping for air, almost melting out of her mortal form when Rio’s fingers curled <i>just</i> right and rubbed her g-spot. “Oh- oh my god!”</p><p>Her wife scattered hickeys along her chest, tomorrow’s problem. Her fingers kept thrusting, filling Agatha in a way nobody had since her. The repeated pressure hitting her in all the right ways, pushing her farther and farther. It was only a minute later when Rio came to a dead halt, mouth leaving Agatha’s skin.</p><p>Agatha whimpered, frustrated and overwhelmed yet nowhere near satisfied. “No dejes de follarme, no te detengas.” <i>Don’t stop fucking me, don’t stop</i></p><p>Her wife didn’t hear her, entranced by something else off to Agatha’s side. A warm hand ghosting from her breast to her ribcage, snaking around to trace over the cursive <i>R</i> still permanently embedded in her skin. “You kept it.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha snapped, frankly a little pissed. “I lied. Obviously, duh.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers withdrew from her cunt, despite her clenching. “You kept it.” Was repeated in awe, two pools of caramel shining with what could only be described as hope mixed with some cockiness.</p><p>Good fucking god, Agatha was going to murder her wife before they even properly worked out their shit. “Yes, we’ve established this. Now, kindly make me come before I fucking <i>off</i> myself in front of you.”</p><p>Her wife’s jaw set itself, a new resolve igniting, a dominance which Rio had obviously been holding back. She shot forward, ferociously kissing Agatha, hands tangling in her hair. And Agatha couldn’t do anything else but submit, didn’t really <i>feel</i> like doing anything else either.</p><p>She broke apart from Rio, her breathing labored as she requested “Take me upstairs.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, tongue tucked against her cheek as she replied “Take off that tacky ass engagement ring.”</p>

<p>Rio stared, aroused and a little impressed, as Agatha stared back with her left ring finger currently in her mouth. A dramatic compliance of Rio’s order, as the tip of her finger must’ve hit the back of her throat. No gag, of course, Rio’s wife had trained that out long before they even met. Agatha let her finger go, now wet and missing a diamond. Her wife pursed her lips, literally <i>spitting</i> out the ring to somewhere unknown off to the side. A soft <i>clink</i> of it presumably hitting the ground, Rio didn’t fucking know, she was too busy <i>looking</i> at her wife. She smugly smiled, pompous in her actions.</p><p>“Take me upstairs.” Agatha repeated.</p><p>Rio wasn’t going to deny her, not after she ripped off that monstrosity to the earth off of her hand with her bare teeth. No, she actually ached to give Agatha everything she wanted and more, give and give until Agatha physically couldn’t take any more. Rio hooked her hands under her wife’s ass, lifting her. “Grab a candle.”</p><p>“Jesus-” Agatha gasped, hastily gabbing a candle with one hand while the other clung to Rio. “Don’t drop me.”</p><p>Rio frowned, offended. “I’ve never dropped you.”</p><p>“Yeah, but you’re getting old.”</p><p>She grinned, she’d remember that for later. Rio quickly and <i>safely</i> whisked them upstairs to the bedroom, Agatha was fairly light so it wasn’t necessarily a strenuous task. Once they got to the bedroom, Agatha blindly set the candle on the dresser, more caught up in keeping their mouths on one another. Rio kicked the door closed, the room dim with only the singular light source. She threw her wife down onto the bed, hard enough to knock the wind out of Agatha for just a second. Fuck, she had missed throwing her wife around like a ragdoll so <i>fucking</i> bad.</p><p>She tucked her thumbs into the waistband of Agatha’s pants, pulling them free from her wife’s legs. Rio dropped to her knees in an instant, literally <i>ripping</i> the satin of Agatha’s underwear off her person and throwing the useless scrap of fabric over her shoulder.  They had done the talking, Rio wanted to stop talking, enough with the fucking <i>talking</i>.</p><p>“I haven’t shaved." Agatha warned.</p><p>Rio’s face twisted, a scowl forming. “And?”</p><p>Her wife blinked, a sudden realization etched on her features. “Shit, impulse. Wanda always wants-”</p><p>“So she expects you to groom for her and she still can’t get you off?” Yeah, enough talk, because Rio would feel nothing but rage if they continued on having this conversation. “<i>Cabrona…</i>”</p><p>Her mouth had better uses anyway, for example, eating out her wife. She shot forward, stuffing her face between Agatha’s thighs tongue first, moaning at the taste of Agatha’s slick which was already pooling out of her. The feeling of her bush against Rio’s cheeks, the coarse thatch of hair brushing her nose. After a year of being deprived of this, Rio wasn’t going to stop unless there was a natural disaster…blizzards excluded.</p><p>Her wife arched off the mattress, fingers fisting in Rio’s hair as she shouted “<i>God, Rio!</i>”</p><p>Rio <i>was not</i> God, but felt pretty damn close with her wife’s legs slung over her shoulders and clit between her lips, Agatha’s <i>scent</i> flooding her nostrils. Rio’s hands reached up, purposely avoiding Agatha’s lower abdomen where her scar was located and greedily grabbing her tits. Obviously, Rio wanted to see the scar, touch it, fucking worship it. But Agatha needed to make that choice herself and for no other person but herself. Neither of them were drunk, but the addition of the booze didn’t make Rio feel good about taking off Agatha’s shirt.</p><p>If Dr. Vostokoff was right, and Agatha did feel violated by Rio’s lack of respect for her autonomy, though medically necessary, Rio wasn’t going to disregard the weight that decision held. The scar was a physical reminder, not just of Alex, but of the betrayal Agatha felt. She wasn’t going to dismiss that, not when they were finally getting somewhere. Rio had to earn some trust back, fair enough.</p><p>Rio’s lips wrapped around her wife’s clit, sucking and enjoying the sensation of Agatha’s thighs tensing around her head. Her fingers came below her chin, two slowly sinking back into her wife, a resulting whine emitting into the room as Agatha’s hips bucked for more.</p><p>“Baby, fuck! Rio, want-” Agatha began, getting cut off by her own squeal at Rio’s digits curling. “Want the strap.”</p><p>She let Agatha’s clit go with a lewd and wet <i>pop</i>. “You almost passed out over two fingers, mi amor. Gotta get you ready first.”</p><p>“I’m fine-”</p><p>Rio scissored her fingers, smirking against her wife’s cunt as Agatha screamed out. Rio considered it music to her ears. “Eres tan apretado, cariño.” <i>You’re so tight, darling</i></p><p>“Sí, no me digas.” <i>Yeah, no shit</i> Agatha panted, walls already contracting. “Come up here.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers kept pumping as she threw herself over Agatha, lips reconnecting. Her wife whined at her own taste on Rio’s lips, jaw going slack as Rio pulled her hand back, reentering with three.</p><p>“Rio, Rio-”</p><p>“C’mon, sweetheart.” She grinned, too fucking giddy. “Use my <i>proper</i> name, I know you want to.”</p><p>The vein in Agatha’s forehead popped out, a sign she was close. That, and her pussy clamping down on Rio’s fingers. Her wife was usually quick to come, or at least quick to come for Rio, but the added denial of her needs for over a year might’ve sped up the process.</p><p>“S- so close.” Agatha choked out, eyes fluttering and head tilting back.</p><p>“Say my name and you can come.” Rio said, bringing her thumb to Agatha’s clit, pressing down in the <i>exact</i> way she knew Agatha needed. “Say it.”</p><p>Her body went taut, eyes screwed shut as she finally whimpered out “<i>Daddy.</i>” and <i>shattered</i> beneath Rio. Agatha’s muscles shook, her grip on Rio becoming possessive, back bowing, a feral cry tearing from the back of her throat.</p><p>So fucking perfect. So gorgeous and beautiful, it made Rio feel insane. Because how hadn’t she had this in almost twelve months? Why had they ever stopped? They had to have been fools, probably still were.</p><p>Rio pressed a kiss to her overheated cheek, keeping her fingers moving to help her wife ride out the high. “<i>Good girl</i>.”</p><p>Agatha splayed her hands on either side of Rio’s jaw, pulling her in and kissing her in a shockingly tender show of affection. It caught her off guard, all things considered. And she let herself lean into it, the simplicity of the aftermath. It wasn’t until she felt Agatha’s hand drop to the hem of her shirt and tug on it did the little alarm bells go off in her head.</p><p>Shit, she had not thought this part through yet when daydreaming of fucking her wife again. How had she not gotten to the part where she would <i>also</i> have to undress? For a doctor, Rio kind of felt like a dumbass in this current moment.</p><p>She pulled her fingers out of Agatha, using them to coil around her wife’s wrist and pin it to the mattress, a band aid solution at best. Agatha didn’t seem discouraged, nipping at Rio’s lower lip and using her free hand (she did have two after all) to paw at Rio’s t-shirt once more. She huffed, pinning that hand down too.</p><p>And then “Okay, what the fuck.” Agatha breathed out, not in question or confusion but as an accusation. “Is this because I won’t take off mine? ‘Cause I <i>just</i> offered-”</p><p>“What? No.” Rio let go, shuffling off the bed and standing up.</p><p>Agatha propped herself up on her elbows, chest marred with marks. “Why aren’t you taking off your clothes?”</p><p>“I am.” Rio defended, pulling her jeans down her legs, leaving her in some boxers and her top. “See?”</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed. “Why are you acting weird?”</p><p>Rio forced out a chuckle. “I’m not, I just thought I could focus on you. God knows you need it.” She raised her eyebrows. “The Bride of Chucky must be a very unsatisfying role.”</p><p>Her wife tilted her head. “So I can’t touch you?”</p><p>Oh, Rio wanted to <i>sob</i>. Sure, she loved giving but that didn’t mean she didn’t also like to receive. And she meant what she said about Agatha’s tongue earlier, she dreamed of her wife’s mouth on her again. But she couldn’t just <i>take off her shirt</i>. Rio would have to face too many truths at once.</p><p>“Um…”</p><p>Agatha sat up fully, trying to hide her disappointment. “Is it the other women? Like, your preferences have changed?”</p><p>“Of course not.” Rio squawked. “There’s no-”</p><p>“So then what is it? Is it <i>me?</i>” Her wife asked, a tremor in her voice. “You don’t <i>want</i> me to fuck you? I’m not enough or something? You don’t feel safe receiving?”</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>“I’m just trying to understand!” She snapped, not angry but clearly hurt. “I thought we were making progress and if we have another issue, then I’d like to know now.” Agatha pulled up her tank top, covering herself, a physical shield for her emotional wound. “Is it Wanda? I’m…” She swallowed. “God, I hate even thinking this because of the patriarchal implications alone, but do you think I’m <i>used up?</i>”</p><p>Oh fuck, that made Rio want to spew out her guts.</p><p>She cocked her head, crouching down in front of her wife, reaching out and gently running the pads of her fingers along Agatha’s thighs. “No, baby. Fuck, no. I don’t think any of that. You’re <i>perfect</i>. Always have been.”</p><p>A tear fell from Agatha’s eye as she spoke, tone frail and frighteningly delicate. “Then why can’t I <i>touch</i> you?”</p><p>Rio exhaled everything from her lungs. “It’s just complicated.”</p><p>“Then simplify it.”</p><p>She sighed, “Fine.”</p><p>If Rio had to tell someone, it might as well be Agatha, even with the risk of an adverse reaction. Who else was Rio going to tell? Well, any cockiness had just vanished from her body in .2 seconds as she stood up again.</p><p>“After Nicky’s birthday, I- I got curious. Obviously not <i>because</i> of Nicky’s birthday, I’m just giving you a timeframe. I did a little research and it seemed easy enough and it makes me feel comfortable-”</p><p>“Curious about what?”</p><p>Fuck it, anything she’d say was going to sound cheesy and sappy and gay.</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, gripping the bottom of her shirt and yanking it off. The fabric hit the floor as Agatha’s face crinkled. Was that shock? Disgust? Disdain? Blue eyes softened, a small smile gracing full lips.</p><p>“Your big secret is that you’re binding?” Agatha snorted.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio crossed her arms over the tape on her chest, feeling self conscious.</p><p>“Oh, no, baby.” Her wife reached out, grabbing Rio’s arm and hauling her closer. Agatha looked up, her fingers slowly ghosting across Rio’s abs. “No, not like that. I just mean, a <i>lot</i> of lesbians tape or bind. Why were you so scared?”</p><p>“I don’t know, what if you didn’t like it? Found it unattractive?”</p><p>“Why would you think that?”</p><p>“You’re engaged to a supermodel Barbie doll.” Rio said, “Figured that’s what you’re into now.”</p><p>There was also the repressed catholic guilt that stemmed from childhood, Rio’s mother would rather she die in a tragic car accident and see heaven than live life happily in sin. And Rio should be over that by now, but she just <i>wasn’t</i>.</p><p>“My love,” Her wife grinned. “I quite literally could not be more wet if I physically tried, which is a compliment to you considering the menopause.” Rio chuckled at that. “I’m into you. Whatever makes <i>you</i> feel confident is what makes you attractive to me.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>A boulder had just been lifted off Rio’s back, gaining the courage to continue. “I, uh, haven’t told anyone else, but…” Agatha watched, listened, waiting for Rio to continue. “I’ve kinda been thinking that she/her doesn’t really suit me.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>“What were you thinking?”</p><p>“It’s kind of silly, right? I’m forty-five years old-”</p><p>“Nonbinary people have been around for a while, I doubt you’re the first. Don’t flatter yourself, handsome.” She winked, toying with the waistband of Rio’s boxers. “You’ve always leaned more into masculinity, it’s why I hit on you in the first place.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio smiled.</p><p>“You’re a hot butch doctor and I have eyes.” Agatha pursed her lips. “Would they/them make you feel better in yourself?”</p><p>Rio nodded, feeling too much to verbalize.</p><p>“Then that’s what I’ll use.” Agatha’s thumbs hooked into their boxers. “Now, can I take these off and make you come in my mouth? Because, I’ve gotta say, I <i>need</i> to fuck you as soon as possible.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yeah, the tape is really doing things to me.” She husked, pupils so dilated, one would think she was on ecstasy or some type of club drug. “Te ves tan guapo.”</p><p>“This doesn’t change anything?”</p><p>Agatha’s tongue darted out, wetting her bottom lip as a coy smirk appeared. “That depends…” She quirked a single brow. “Are you still my <i>good boy?</i>”</p><p>Holy shit, their knees nearly fucking buckled. Nothing but a pathetic whimper came out of Rio’s mouth, their cheeks flushed.</p><p>She yanked Rio’s boxers down, her knees landing with a soft <i>thud</i> onto the floor. “Thought so.”</p><p>Rio’s grip on the power dynamic loosened temporarily, they enjoyed being in charge, enjoyed knowing Agatha trusted them enough to do so. But when their wife got like this, they crumpled faster than a five dollar bill, brain turned to utter mush. They stepped out of the boxers, kicking them off into the darkness of the room.</p><p>“Lean against the dresser.” Agatha said, watching as Rio took a few steps back, uncoordinated like a calf fresh out of its mother. Their wife followed, seductively crawling after, an assuredness that mimicked a lion hunting its prey. Rio had longed to see Agatha like this, hadn’t since they were married.</p><p>Their wife always derived some sort of power from sex. When they were married, that meant Agatha usually reducing Rio down to a whimpering mess whenever she saw fit. Now that they were divorced, it meant Agatha initiated the sex and subsequently dismissed Rio. As for power dynamics, they usually fought for it now, because control for Agatha meant trust, and she didn’t trust Rio anymore.</p><p>Except for tonight, apparently.</p><p>The use of Rio’s title had been a long shot, but their wife miraculously complied. And that held meaning, so Agatha <i>crawling</i> over and biting along their inner thighs before laving her along Rio’s weeping cunt as her hands gripped at their ass, meant a <i>fuckton</i>. Agatha had no problem asserting her dominance, but her willingness to give showed that this hook up wasn’t like the rest. If it was, she’d have just stripped Rio naked, had them wear the strap, and fuck her into oblivion.</p><p>The sex post-marriage was always cold, it was detached.</p><p>This was startlingly warm and intimate.</p><p>“<i>Mierda, Agatha.</i>” Rio yelped, their wife’s tongue <i>also</i> startlingly warm and intimate. Agatha’s tongue was a little longer than average, which– thank god. But it was also very dextrous, Rio always said that’s why she was always so sharp linguistically. That <i>fucking</i> tongue.</p><p>Rio burrowed their hands in Agatha’s mane, their wife responding with a muffled “Mmmh.” Her hands remained on Rio’s ass, nails digging in. Rio was never one for penetration, vaginally at least, ass play was a different story. They liked a couple of fingers on occasion and Agatha knew them well enough that she was able to sense when those occasions would be, but she seemed to be too invested in her current meal to think about moving her hands. Fuck, Rio would definitely have markings in the shapes of crescent moons left on their ass tomorrow. A wonderful souvenir from tonight.</p><p>“God, baby-” Rio husked, lungs heavy as Agatha’s tongue zeroed in on their clit, sucking in perfect accordance with her tongue rapidly flicking the bundle of nerves. “I’m- I’m not going to last.” Because they’d been on the brink since they’d had their mouth on their wife, proud of themself that they hadn’t come just from eating Agatha out like a teenage boy coming in his pants during foreplay.</p><p>Their hips bucked, knocking against the dresser and causing the objects on top to jostle. And, oh. Rio’s hand shot out, shakily flipping over the picture frame with the innocent smile of their then six year old daughter from Halloween. Nicky didn’t need to see this. They also batted the candle away from the edge, though their legs were trembling from the exertion.</p><p>They slapped their hand down on the dresser, a low moan leaving their lips as Agatha sucked <i>hard</i>. And this time, Rio’s knees did <i>actually</i> buckle as they came. Agatha kept going whilst also keeping them upright, keeping Rio from falling.</p><p>Blue eyes, heavy and clouded in lust, blinked as she pulled back. “That was <i>pathetic</i>.” Agatha purred, licking her lips. “Always were a quick trigger.”</p><p>Rio’s heart hammered against their chest, <i>snapping</i> Agatha’s head back by pulling on her hair. They smiled, “You don’t have to be a brat just to get my cock inside you, baby.”</p><p>Agatha whined, the tension on her roots causing a deliciously dull pain. “Then put it on.” She grinned viciously, “Or do you need me to look away?”</p><p>They scoffed, using the leverage they had and literally <i>dragging</i> Agatha back to the bed, flinging her onto the mattress unceremoniously before sauntering over to their nightstand. “Remeber when I used to gag you?” Rio snidely commented “That always worked like a fucking charm.”</p><p>“Unless you’ve been into kinky shit with your Tinder bitches, you don’t have one.” Agatha remarked, working her top back down so that her stomach was covered but her tits were free again. “I kept both of ours.”</p><p>Rio grabbed a harness and one of their multiple straps, the smallest one. “Don’t tell me you’ve been using it on <i>her</i>.” Say what you want, but in Rio’s opinion, sex toys were one and done if the sex was had in a long term relationship. New partner, new toys.</p><p>Agatha cackled, raising her brows. “As if she’d want me to.”</p><p>They fastened the harness, securing the strap through the O-ring. “So what, you just scissor with the lights off and cuddle?”</p><p>Their wife’s eyes gazed at the strap now protruding from Rio’s pelvis. “I knew you stole that one!” She accused, pointing. “You said you didn’t know where it went!” Whenever they had sex before, it was always with a strap that Agatha had kept from their marriage, it was always at their old home, it was always on her terms.</p><p>“Yeah, I lied.” Rio parroted Agatha’s earlier words. “Obviously, duh.”</p><p>“You’re not using that on me if you’ve been using it on other women.”</p><p>Rio was about to explode if Agatha kept bringing up these mythical women who never existed, but onto the more important point–</p><p>“You think I’d desecrate the sanctity of our marital strap?”</p><p>“Our <i>marital</i> strap?”</p><p>“I can assure you, we are its only recipients.” Rio said, walking over and stopping just shy of Agatha. “You sure you can even take it, cariño?”</p><p>Their wife nearly snarled, grabbing them by the strap and pulling them on top of her. “Your dick is <i>mine</i> in the first place. Always has been, always will be.” She used her own slick, seeping down her thighs, and coated the silicone. “It’s <i>mine</i> to take. <i>You’re</i> mine to take, pretty boy. Nobody’s gotten you like this, as your real self, that’s for me. You’re for me, got it?”</p><p>Um, motherfucking god in heaven, Rio’s brain broke. “Y- yes.”</p><p>Agatha fastened her fingers around the nape of their neck, using her other to guide the strap towards herself. “You belong to me, right? You’re so fucking desperate for it.”</p><p>Yeah, of course they were. It’s why they hadn’t moved on, it’s why they still had the <i>A</i> on their ribs, it’s why they had pursued Agatha for the better part of a decade. “Yours, mi amor. I’m all yours.”</p><p>They let her have this, this <i>adorable</i> little power trip, it was fleeting anyhow. Rio notched the tip of their cock at Agatha’s drooling entrance, waiting a beat. “And you’re <i>all mine</i>.” They drove their hips forward, staring in utter delight as their dick spilt their wife in half.</p><p>“<i>Oh fuck!</i>” Agatha screamed, scratching at Rio’s neck. “Gimme- ah. Gimme a minute. Estás enorme.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio kept pushing, enjoying the small whimpers coming from their wife. “Angel. This is the smallest one.” They wrapped their hand around Agatha’s neck, squeezing at the sides. “I thought it was yours to take, princess.”</p><p>She gasped as Rio finally bottomed out, “Don’t, don’t call me that.”</p><p>“Really?” They reared back, pulling out almost completely, before <i>thrusting</i> back in and noticing the resulting <i>gush</i> of wetness from Agatha’s pussy. “Seems like you like it just as much as you used to.”</p><p>“G-god!”</p><p>“You used to take eight inches no problem, querida.” Rio’s hip drove, “How the mighty have fallen.”</p><p>Agatha writhed, frustrated. She tried flipping them over, attempting to take back control, but with Rio’s hand choking her and them being stronger in general, she had nowhere to go. “R- Rio-”</p><p>Some evil and dark energy overtook them, wanting to see Agatha struggle and submit. Rio viciously snapped their hips, smiling at the force making their wife’s tits bounce. “Tu coño es <i>mio</i>.” <i>Your cunt is mine</i> “Gonna fuck you until your pussy is molded to my dick. How’s that sound, sweetheart?”</p><p>“Please!” Agatha screeched, her free hand returning to Rio’s ass, nails scratching against the flesh. “Oh, fucking- fuck, please!”</p><p>“See, all you need is my cock filling you up.” They tugged on Agatha’s neck just enough to make her arch, sliding their arm under her back and pulling their chests flush. “Cockdrunk slut can’t be a fucking brat when you’re clenching around me.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth fell open into an <i>O</i> shape, the head of Rio’s strap hitting her g-spot. “N- next time wear the one that hits my cervix.”</p><p><i>Next time?</i></p><p>“Ask nicely.” They said, speeding up their hips.</p><p>“Please, <i>daddy</i>.”</p><p>“Mmh, there are those manners.” Rio slowed, not wanting to give Agatha their full energy yet. “So greedy you forgot your place.”</p><p>She mewled at the decreased pace, but dumbly nodded. “Please, I’ll be good. I can be good.”</p><p>Rio angled Agatha’s jaw, their teeth grazing the soft spot right below her ear. Lowly speaking “You’ll be good for <i>me</i>. No one else. That’s me on your ribs, that’s me inside you. Nobody can have you like I can.” Their hips came to a stop, instead grinding the length. It was mutually beneficial, the pressure pressing against both of their clits simultaneously, the shaft rubbing along Agatha’s walls. “Say it.”</p><p>“Nobody can have me like this.” Agatha whispered, eyebrows knitted together in pleasure. “Nobody has.”</p><p>And <i>that’s</i> when Rio quickly reared back, <i>brutally</i> stuffing themself back in. They rest their forehead against Agatha’s as she hiccupped out a sob, fucking into their wife with reckles abandon. “Who owns you, baby?”</p><p>“Y-” Agatha’s breaths came out short, staccato, and broken. “You. Y-ou own me.”</p><p>They nearly cried at Agatha’s submission, her brain going fuzzy in response to Rio’s dominance. “Your pleasure, your pussy. ‘S mine.”</p><p>“<i>Harder! Pleasepleaseplease-</i>”</p><p>So Rio did, the lewd sound of skin slapping filling the room. The crude noise of Agatha’s cunt taking it over and over. The clanging of the headboard against the wall in perfect rhythm with Rio. The grind pad felt fucking amazing on their clit but it was nothing compared to the pornographic moans leaving their wife. “That’s right, mi amor. Beg for my cock, beg to come.”</p><p>Agatha’s face was bright red, not from the choking, but from how damn hot they both were. Their skin was sticking to each other, sweat beading along Agatha’s hairline. “Love your cock, n-need it.” She babbled, words jumbled and shattered. “Please, my love, I’m close.”</p><p>“Whose pussy is this?” Rio prompted, approaching their own peak. “Admit it.”</p><p>“Yours.” Agatha freely confessed, body trembling. “Este coño es tuyo.” <i>This pussy is yours</i></p><p>Rio’s hand left their wife’s throat, wedging it between their bodies and bringing two fingers to her clit. “You come when I say so.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes slammed shut, chest wracking with these pathetic and indiscernible noises. “No, please-”</p><p>“This isn’t a negotiation. If you come without permission now, you’re done for the night.”</p><p>Their wife clung to them, resigned to her fate, a bleated “Yesssss-” slipping from between her teeth, which were bared in frustration. Agatha’s body was ablaze, Rio almost swore there was steam rising off her skin. The constellation of freckles on her chest, now marred blue and purple with hickeys and drenched in crimson from the heat of her flesh. “Daddy, please. I’ve been good.”</p><p>She had been, that was true. But Rio liked to <i>push</i> see how far they could take Agatha before she imploded, before she was <i>so</i> malleable that she’d sob through her orgasm.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio husked through ragged breaths, fingers administering tight circles on Agatha’s clit. “You can beg all you want, and please do, you know how it turns me on. But, you’re not in charge, are you?”</p><p>Her eyes cracked open just a bit, glassy and feral. “No.”</p><p>“C’mon, cariño. Let those tears fall for me, you’re so beautiful when you cry ‘cause of my cock.”</p><p>The twin pools of endless stormy ocean welled, tears brimming over and down Agatha’s cheeks. Her voice fractured and sitting at the back of her throat, nothing coherent. Rio watched as the trails of saltwater brushed over the highpoint of her cheekbones, groaning aloud before dipping their head down. Their tongue ghosted along Agatha’s face, collecting the tear and pressing a kiss where it once was. Their eyes almost rolled back in their fucking head, shit, they weren’t going to last long either.</p><p>“Good girl.” They praised, though new waves had already begun to trek down their wife’s face, the face that was sculpted from motherfucking ivory. For how perverted they were, Rio really liked any position where they could appreciate Agatha’s beauty. Her nose, her lips, her eyes, the tiny crinkle in her forehead. Rio was sure she was the most ethereal creature to have graced the planet.</p><p>Rio picked up their hips, along with their fingers, whispering “Come for me, mi alma.”</p><p>And the very second they said it, Agatha wailed out. Her body went rigid, her mouth open as a sinful howl filled the room. Rio didn't stop, wouldn’t, because even if Agatha was still actively coming, if they just ground down like so-</p><p>“<i>OH MY FUCKING GOD!</i>” Agatha shrieked, fucking <i>clawing</i> at any part of Rio she could reach, catapulting her into her <i>next</i> orgasm. Rio should probably check to see if their back was bleeding, it fucking felt like it. Not really a problem to them if she had just sliced them open, they’d wear the rageful lines around like a badge of honor.</p><p>“That’s it, angel.” Rio cooed, finally letting themself fall off the edge of the peak. “You <i>deserve</i> it.” They shuddered for a moment, head dropping into the crook of Agatha’s neck as they gasped for air. They could smell her shampoo, it hadn’t changed in well over a decade, eighteen years to be exact. Iris and amber and home.</p><p>They both laid there for a minute, Rio gathering themself and popping back up after a moment. They gently pulled out, Agatha’s cunt still spasming and puffy and flushed. Then Rio looked at the strap, shiny and dripping with their wife’s arousal. “You okay?” Rio murmured softly, hands resting on her hips.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open, lips swollen and chest rapidly rising and falling. “Perfect.”</p><p>“Great.” They pulled, flipping her over like one does with a fucking pancake. “‘Cause I’m not done with you. I’m not stopping until you’re boneless.”</p><p>“Promises, promises…” Agatha propped herself up on her knees, feebly pushing her torso up and resting her weight on her hands, posed on all fours. “Don’t be gentle.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, harshly <i>smacking</i> her ass and groping the tender flesh immediately after, making their wife <i>keen</i>. “Wasn’t going to be. See,” Rio brought the head of their cock back to Agatha’s entrance, pushing in with no resistance. “You can fool that polly pocket all you want. Pretend that you don’t love being treated like the whore we both know you are. You can deny yourself, you can ignore what you really want.” They fisted a hand in her hair, leaning down to speak directly in her ear. “But,” Rio clicked their tongue against their teeth. “You’re only lying to yourself.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twisted in the sheets, the candle projecting a shadow onto the wall above the bed. “Vas a follarme, papi? O vas a seguir hablando?” <i>Are you going to fuck me, daddy? Or are you going to keep talking?</i></p><p>Rio spanked her again, this time harder, making sure their handprint would be left behind. “Cockslut.” They kept their grasp on her mane, winding their hips back and <i>ramming</i> back into their wife. Agatha crumpled, her forearms dropping to the bed and leaving her on her elbows. Rio snickered, pushing her head down to meet the mattress. “What was that, baby?”</p><p>Their wife whined, “N- nothing.”</p><p>“Thought so.” They smugly replied, beginning a vicious pace. The bedroom groaned, the headboard banging the wall once again. When they were married, Rio had reinforced their bedframe, digging Agatha out of the mattress as it swallowed her whole had become a far too regular occurrence. This bed was <i>not</i> reinforced because Rio hadn’t been fucking anyone. But, it should probably be fine, right?</p><p>Yeah, not the top priority as Agatha flailed around, her body bouncing with each return of Rio’s length. The recoil of her ass alone made Rio feel like the most blessed dyke to have ever lived.</p><p>“Don’t stop.” Agatha whimpered, her hips pushing back for more. “Fingers.”</p><p>Rio spanked her one more time, just for good measure, before hauling Agatha up so her back was pressed to Rio’s chest. Agatha was fully sat on their dick, reflexively riding as they reached around. Bringing two fingers, the one that had been inside her earlier, and tapped her bottom lip. Agatha opened, mouth enveloping the digits and sucking. Rio couldn’t <i>see</i> her cheeks hollowing but felt it.</p><p>Rio kept pounding into her as their fingers hit the back of her throat, spit trickling down and pooling onto their knuckles. “Get ‘em ready, baby.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands grabbed onto Rio’s thighs on either side of her own, bruising in her intentions of staying upright. “Mmmhh.”</p><p>Now, they <i>may</i> have pushed a little further in than necessary, causing Agatha to sputter around the fingers essentially throat fucking her, but nobody could <i>prove</i> that. Rio pulled their fingers free, immediately dropping them between Agatha’s thighs, working her clit and nipping at her neck. As much as Rio would <i>love</i> to leave a hickey there, it was a nonstarter. No, not because of that fucking Teletubby Agatha was wasting time with, but because of their daughter. Even if this was a true step towards reconciliation, Nicky could never know about this. And a huge blooming bruise on her mom’s neck would be a dead give away that Agatha had slept with someone and, god forbid, it was assumed to be Wanda.</p><p>“Rio!” She wheezed, hips going stiff. “Gonna- f- fuck.”</p><p>“It’s okay, you can come.”</p><p>Agatha fell forward as she screamed, face planting onto the bed while her body twitched. Rio could feel her pussy contracting around their dick, greedily taking as much as possible. Which was perfect for what Rio was about to do. They left her clit, it was probably <i>throbbing</i> and needed a break anyway. Rio let go of Agatha’s hair, pressing on the small of her back to make her arch, which of course she did.</p><p>Even through an orgasm, Agatha was still searching for more. Oh, how Rio had missed this. They pursed their lips, letting the saliva drop right at the top of Agatha’s ass, groping her cheeks and spreading them. “Even with my cock you’re still not full enough, your ass miss me too?”</p><p>Agatha, shuddering and coated in sweat, shakily nodded. “More.”</p><p>Rio complied, bringing only one finger to the tight ring of muscles, slowly easing it in. Agatha wasn’t prepped for more, not right away. “Stuffed to the brim, I know baby.”</p><p>Agatha arched further as she took the welcome intrusion, cunt pulsating at the added stimulation. “Sooo, so good.” She slurred, any inhibitions vanishing. “More, baby. Please.”</p><p>Rio’s cock and digit thrust in sync with one another, slower than before to give Agatha time to adjust. “Give yourself a minute.”</p><p>Her head popped up, looking back at them. “Rio, I want you to <i>fuck</i> me. I want you to break me. I want to walk with a fucking limp tomorrow. Give. It. To. Me. Métemela. <i>Now!</i>”</p><p>They tilted their head, grinning. “Whatever you say, princess.” Rio returned with two fingers, gently pushing despite the resistance, bathing in Agatha’s resulting mewl. “My little fucktoy finally full?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened, but nothing came out.</p><p>“I’ll take that as a yes.” They said, starting to move once more, gentle at first before gaining the confidence to thrust faster. With Rio’s cock in her cunt and two fingers in her ass, Agatha seemed to be subdued, eyes glazing over like there wasn’t a thought in her head.</p><p>“Yesyesyesyeysyesyes-” She chanted, reaching out an arm to steady herself against the headboard, Rio’s brutal impalement causing her body to shoot forward. “J- just like that.”</p><p>The bed started straining again as they went through round after round, making Agatha come over and over. She obviously started to wane after orgasm number five, or maybe six, who knows, Rio lost track after a while. They currently had Agatha on her back, head dangling off the side of the bed, legs slung over Rio’s shoulders, and essentially folded in half.</p><p>She was still just as flexible, Rio would give her that.</p><p>“One more, mi alma.” Rio said, fucking thier wife at a rate which only bunnies could envy.</p><p>“C- can’t. Can’t.” Agatha responded, gripping onto the bed so as not to fly off the edge.</p><p>“Oh, <i>porbecita</i>. That wasn’t a question, it was a command.” Rio’s thighs <i>burned</i>, their breathing mimicking a professional runner’s. “If you can still speak, that means I haven’t done my job.”</p><p>She cried, she whined, but <i>didn’t</i> call red. Rio hadn’t even gone over safewording because there was nothing overly kinky about what they were doing. Agatha could speak, move, and had full and free use of her hands. No toys other than the strap, no restraints, no gags.  They knew that Agatha was tiring, though, so this would have to be the last one. What a shame, that evil witch had taken Agatha’s orgasms and her stamina.</p><p>Rio sheathed themself back into Agatha’s mess of a pussy, drooling and leaking. Too focused on the singular goal of fucking their wife with the carnal ferality of a wild animal, furiously plowing her, when a single, echoing <i>snap</i> caught their attention. The first thing that happened was the tilting of Agatha’s body, followed by her literally falling to the floor, Rio following since they weren’t going to let go of their wife.</p><p>They both landed on the area rug below, the wood of the frame splintered and broken in half like a fucking toothpick. Rio looked down at Agatha, cradling the back of her head. “Mi amor, are you alright? Did you hit your-”</p><p>“Keep going!” Agatha growled, pulling them closer. “I was almost there!”</p><p>Oh, okay.</p><p>Rio hooked their hands under her knees, spreading her legs as wide as possible and tugging her toward them. Rugburn? Probably. Rio split her open, Agatha holding onto their shoulders, every other part of her gone slack.</p><p>Rio remained cradling Agatha’s head, subtly feeling for a bump. “You sure you’re good?”</p><p>“Stop playing doctor.” Agatha pouted, pelvis tilted upwards for more access, tank top clinging to her sweaty flesh. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“You could have a concussion-”</p><p>“How about this, fuck me first, then you can fondle my skull all you’d like.”</p><p>Rio laughed, genuinely, Agatha giggling back. “Okay, baby. Okay.”</p><p>This time was leisurely, unhurried as Rio took their time. Agatha had to be oversensitive by now, Rio had only come thrice and they were oversensitive. They spent the time peppering chaste kisses along her jaw, and chest, hands gentle and loving. Their wife, in turn, languidly ran the pads of her fingers along Rio’s back, their abs, their sternum and tape. Agatha came with a quiet and severed whimper, face twisted in pleasure and pain.</p><p>Rio stilled, whispering a “Good girl. You did so well for me, cariño.”  and intending to start pulling out.</p><p>Agatha caught her breath, gravelly speaking. “Can you just stay for a sec?”</p><p>“Are you sure? Must hurt.”</p><p>“It does.” Agatha murmured, “But in a good way.”</p><p>Their eyes locked onto their wife’s, too much love for that sentence not to have a deeper meaning.</p><p>“Whatever you need.” They agreed, letting their full weight relax atop Agatha.</p><p>And Rio did just that, playing with her locks, content moans given in response. After a few minutes, Rio got up, helping their wife do the same. Agatha’s legs didn’t really work, so they sat her on the non-sunken part of the bed, the right side, as they undid the harness. They quickly ran down the hall, throwing the strap in the bathroom sink and returning to Agatha slumped on the mattress half awake. Rio smiled, softly shaking her. “Mi amor, we gotta get you ready for bed before you pass out.”</p><p>Agatha grunted, allowing Rio to haul her back upright. They rummaged through their dresser, plucking out an oversized t-shirt, one that said <i>Mrs. Vidal’s AP Lit Class of ‘16</i>. “Here, I’ll help.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. “That’s <i>my</i> shirt.”</p><p>“Yeah, I also have class of ‘13.” Rio chirped, scrunching it up. “You still have my Red Sox hoodie.” They walked over, holding it up for Agatha to shove her head through. “I won’t look.” They turned their head away, watching the wall as they heard the shuffling of Agatha working off her tank top. She popped her head through, t-shirt engulfing her body and stopping at her mid-thigh. Rio looked back at her, “Cozy, right?”</p><p>She looked pitiful, hair wild and shirt hanging off her frame. “Mhm.”</p><p>“You want help to the bathroom?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, exhausted, stretching out her arms. “Don’t drop me.”</p><p>“I’ve never-”</p><p>“You just did.” She quirked a brow, motioning to the broken side of the bed.</p><p>“No, you <i>fell</i>. It’s different.”</p><p>Rio threw on some boxers, scooping up their wife for the short walk down the hall. They lent Agatha a toothbrush, both of them peeing and going through their routines. It felt strangely domestic, like old times. They helped Agatha back to the room before going downstairs and grabbing some waters. Rio made sure she drank at least half of one before they curled around her.</p><p>The side not tarnished by their deviant sex would suffice for a night, Rio happily spooned their wife as she drowsily wiggled closer. They could talk more tomorrow, but right now, they were snowed in and warm. Something had to give after tonight. Rio yawned and gently tugged Agatha as close as possible, drowning in their wife’s hair, arm slung over her waist. Their wife’s hand rested atop their own, her fingers making the move to lace their fingers together. Rio’s eyes closed as their fatigue set in, exhausted and content. Content to have Agatha in their arms, legs tangled up with one another, breaths in perfect sync.</p><p>Agatha’s lips grazed their knuckles in a featherlight kiss, body limp against their hold. Soft and sweet and earnest in her actions, nuzzling back as Rio’s nose buried itself in the crook of her neck. Everything right, everything good. Like how it used to be, how they used to sleep. Agatha safely nestled in their arms, relaxed. Like how they used to go to bed when they were married, before Agatha was an ex and Rio made the call that would ruin the life they’d spent years building together. Before they’d lost Alex and lost each other in the wake.</p><p>The candles had been blown out, the loft dark and quiet. A singular, sleepy “<i>I love you.</i>” drifting out into the open air. The snow swirling outside, the wind rampaging–</p><p>A world under siege.</p>

<p>She had fallen asleep to Rio whispering a soft “<i>I love you too.</i>” in response. Agatha had <i>woken up</i> to her own drool running down her chin, cheek pressed against Rio’s collarbones. They were already up, fingers toying with her hair, which was beyond snarled. She went rigid for just a fraction of a second, flashes of the night racing through her mind. The dancing, the sex, the confessions. Agatha relaxed, opting instead to burrow closer to her wife. Or…spouse? Husband? Something to touch on later.</p><p>“Morning.” Rio spoke, a smile evident in their tone.</p><p>“Mmmmh.” She whined, the light leaking into the room through the massive window across the way. Good for the numerous plants Rio had scattered about, but horrendous for a sleepy and slightly hungover Agatha. “Shhhhh.”</p><p>Her head swayed as Rio laughed, their chest rocking her. “I’m a little shocked that you didn’t bolt while I was still knocked out.”</p><p>And though it was said with an air of humor, Agatha could see through it. She grinned, her lips moving against their neck. “I’m trapped, where would I run?” Rio hummed in acknowledgement, saying no more. Agatha wasn’t <i>totally</i> emotionally inept, she did have some self awareness, too much actually.</p><p>There were a few reasons Agatha didn’t run. She was snowed in and without a car, so she wouldn’t get very far. That was fine, she knew what she was agreeing to when she offered to drive Rio home from therapy. Additionally, she wasn’t going to abandon Rio after they had shared something so intimate with her, no not the sex, but who they are. Agatha was privy to Rio’s experiences with their family, so for them to say <i>anything</i> was a monumental step for them. Agatha didn’t want them to feel rejected or unsupported in their identity. Their very hot and confident identity that made her wonder how Rio had somehow made themself <i>more</i> attractive when she didn’t realize that was even possible. And finally, she <i>didn't want</i> to run. For the first time in what felt like <i>eons</i>, she didn’t want to flee. She was steadfast in the choices she had made, they weren’t done so on a whim. Though, the tequila did give her some courage.</p><p>She yawned, adding “Why would I wanna run?”</p><p>“I guess I just don’t know what last night was-”</p><p>Agatha groaned, propping herself up on her elbow. “Listen, I will do the emotional touchy feely bullshit, but can I <i>please</i> have coffee and a shower first?”</p><p>They looked at her, eyes incredibly kind for how bent out of shape Agatha must look right now. “Yeah, yeah, that seems fair enough.”</p><p>She scanned the room, clothes everywhere, objects on the dresser left askew, half of the bed sunken into the floor with bits of wood poking out. “Oh, shit. Forgot about that.” Agatha deadpanned, slumping back down. “That’s not an easy fix, is it?”</p><p>“It is not.” Rio sighed, tongue tucked against their cheek. “I’ll order a new one.”</p><p>“I mean, why mass produce something that can’t withstand lesbian sex?”</p><p>“That’d be a good way to test structural integrity.”</p><p>“If a company figured out how to sell that?” She wiggled her brows. “Whole new niche in an oversaturated market.”</p><p>“You’ve been spending too much time around that marketing exec.”</p><p><i>Wanda</i>.</p><p>“Tell me about it.”</p><p>They both laid there in comfortable silence for a minute before she reluctantly climbed out of bed, “I should-”</p><p>Rio’s hand shot out, hooking around her waist and pulling her down and into their lap so her back was pressed to their chest. “Noooooo-”</p><p>“My phone is downstairs, what if teddy called? Or ma?” She snorted, Rio’s fingers knowing <i>just</i> where to poke to make her jerk, that god forsaken ticklish spot just below her ribs. “R- Rio!”</p><p>“Yes, baby?”</p><p>Rio’s hand stopped, letting her catch her breath through her laughter. “Coffee, shower-”</p><p>“Sex?”</p><p>“My love, I’m still sore from last night.” She grinned, “There’s a reason the bed is in the floor.”</p><p>Rio’s hand drifted, leaving her waist and slowly dropping to her thigh. “I can stay on the outside, nothing internal.”</p><p>She bit her lip, heat immediately pooling in her belly. “Now who’s greedy?”</p><p>They swept her hair to one side, mouthing along the side of her throat. “I’m not ashamed to say that I wanna fuck the hottest woman alive any chance I get. I’m very proud of that fact, actually.”</p><p>Her stupid fucking heart fluttered at the sincerity, because her wife really meant it, that much was clear. And crucify her, being doted on felt amazing, she didn’t get it elsewhere. So, “Five minutes. Then coffee or I’m going to become homicidal.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, hand disappearing beneath the fabric of the shirt. “Deal.”</p><p>Five minutes, turned into twenty, which turned into an hour.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>They both came up for air, Rio metaphorically and Agatha <i>literally</i> because she wanted to have her butch for breakfast. Again, judge away, she was having a great time. She gingerly made her way downstairs, muscles beyond tight, bones heavy, Rio’s arousal staining her lips. The media console was still playing Frank Sinatra when she clicked it off, the power having come back on in the early morning hours. She peeked out the living room window, observing the <i>mountains</i> of snow on the street. Cars buried, the city blanketed a crisp white.</p><p>Rio was in the kitchen, bashing buttons on the coffee maker, wearing their tape and boxers. Agatha was still in the t-shirt, no move had been made during their morning…<i>activities</i> for it to be taken off. She met her wife in the kitchen, a <i>sharp</i> twist of pain shooting through her foot. “God fucking damnit!” Agatha hissed, jumping back.</p><p>Their wife looked over their shoulder. “You okay, mi amor?”</p><p>She plucked the engagement ring off the ground, dropping it onto the island. “Hurt more than a fucking LEGO.”</p><p>“I’d never leave my LEGOs lying around, warps the pieces.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, finding her phone near the sink. “Diamonds are worse on flesh than plastic, baby.” She unlocked it, numerous notifications loading at once. A few texts from Lilia, a few from Nicky, <i>two</i> from Wanda.</p><p><b>Wanda, 12:02am:</b> We should deffintiley have Aviation giin @ the wedding it’s Ryan Seacrest's COMPANY</p><p><b>Wanda, 12:05am:</b> ryan REynolds. I may havee had to much</p><p>Agatha deeply exhaled, disappointed but not at all surprised. She closed out her messages, dialing her daughter. The line trilled a couple times, Nicky’s voice, laden with sleep, crackling on the other end. “Mmh, hello?”</p><p>“Hey, hon.” She smiled, leaning against the counter, the scent of brewing coffee wafting into the air. “How’s New York?”</p><p>“Cold.” Nicky rasped. Agatha could picture her still bundled up in bed, it was 8AM and their daughter was never much of a morning person. “Show was good though.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah, I got you guys merch.”</p><p>“Baby, you didn’t have to do that. It’s your allowance.”</p><p>“I wanted to, I got you a tote bag for all your work papers and stuff. Mami gets a magnet because after the tote and a hoodie for me, I was running low on cash.”</p><p>Agatha giggled, flattered even. “I just wanted to check in, make sure you and nonna are good.”</p><p>“Nonna is still snoring in the bed next to mine, that woman needs a sleep apnea mask or something. She sounds like a foghorn.”</p><p>“I imagine the snow is pretty bad there too?”</p><p>She heard some shuffling in the background, Nicky getting out of bed to look out the window. “The city is basically a snow globe, one from which there is no escape.”</p><p>“Same here. I don’t think the plows are going to be able to get out until later this afternoon. On the bright side, no therapy and almost definitely a snow day on Monday.”</p><p>“Fuck yeah.” Nicky murmured.</p><p>“Jesus, fuck!” Rio huffed, rapidly whipping their hand around, scalding hot coffee spilling over their knuckles. They walked over to the sink, drenching their hand in lukewarm water. “Mother-”</p><p>Agatha clapped a hand over their mouth, Rio’s face falling in sudden realization.</p><p>“What was that?” Their daughter asked.</p><p>“TV.” Agatha lied, glaring at her wife. “I should go, I gotta shovel the walkway.”</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky rasped, climbing back into bed by the sound of it. “Oh, have you heard from mami? She hasn’t called or texted me back all night or this morning.”</p><p>“Um, they- she’s” Close one, that was going to be a mental fuck until Rio told their daughter. “She’s probably just sleeping. Therapy yesterday really took it out of us.”</p><p>And the fucking like bunnies.</p><p>“I’ll try her again later.”</p><p>“Okay. I love you, teddy.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Nicky yawned, “Love you too.”</p><p>Hey, she got a “too”, one step closer to a genuine “I love you too.”</p><p>“Get some sleep, hopefully you can get out of New York tomorrow.”</p><p>“M’kay.” Her daughter said, ending the call.</p><p>Agatha threw her phone down, letting go of Rio’s face. “What the fuck, you almost blew our cover!”</p><p>They pouted, innocently holding up their reddened hand. “You can’t be mad at me, I’m injuuuured.”</p><p>She playfully rolled her eyes. “Nicky’s fine. She got us presents and mine is better than yours, so suck it.”</p><p>Rio smiled wide, turning off the sink. “Keychain?”</p><p>“Magnet.”</p><p>“I’ll live.”</p><p>“I’m gonna hop in the shower, I need to brush my teeth before the coffee.” Agatha gagged. “I don’t know how you kissed me, my morning breath is atrocious.”</p><p>“You kissed me with mine.”</p><p>She grabbed her phone just in case Nicky called again or, god forbid, Wanda. Agatha cupped Rio’s cheek. “Yeah, and yours is <i>worse</i>.” She gave them a peck on the lips, heading to the bathroom.</p><p>She brushed her teeth and, upon stripping, gasped in the mirror. Agatha knew Rio had gone to town like an overzealous puppy, but <i>jesus</i>. Her tits looked like they owed someone money, her hips had light bruising in the shape of fingers. She turned around, craning her neck, and sure enough, a faint handprint on her ass. Well…Agatha couldn’t say she was <i>mad</i>. Her fingers brushed along her scar, a numb sensation following. She didn’t have much feeling there, it kind of came and went. The offer to uncover her scar last night had absolutely been the tequila, and it didn’t elude her how Rio had taken that into account. How they had taken care of her, treated her with a delicacy she hadn’t received in a while. She swallowed, getting in the shower and spending numerous, numerous minutes detangling her hair with the closest conditioner within reach.</p><p>Agatha grabbed a towel, wrapping herself up and finding a comb to start on the fucking knots left in her mane. A knock came on the door, Agatha opening it to reveal Rio on the other side, mugs in hand.</p><p>“I don’t mean to brag, but I powered through my devastating burn. I think I’ll make a full recovery.” They handed her the mug, repeating the same thing they’d said yesterday before therapy. “M’lady.”</p><p>“My hero.” She deadpanned, taking the coffee in her <i>own</i> mug and setting it on the counter.</p><p>“I’m <i>very</i> brave, correct.” Rio smirked, sipping their own and waltzing in. They stood next to her, looking in the mirror and picking at their tape. “Son of a bitch.”</p><p>Agatha stopped what she was doing, watching as this dumbass tried to dry peel their tape. “Baby.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio asked, not looking away from their reflection as they flinched.</p><p>She sighed, batting their hand down. “Okay, I can’t-” Agatha grabbed them, turning them away from the mirror. “Sit on the counter.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Do as I say, pretty boy.” She muttered, scavenging the cabinet under the sink, bypassing the roll of tape shoved deep in the back behind some tampons. “You have any oil in here?”</p><p>“Uh, Nicky has some jojoba oil for her hair.” Rio replied in confusion, perched on the counter.</p><p>She found the bottle, standing up, adjusting her towel, and situating herself between Rio’s legs. “Did you not research how to take <i>off</i> the tape?”</p><p>They shrugged. “I just figured that it’s supposed to hurt, like a band aid.”</p><p>“You have tattoos, you know the saniderm is a bitch to get off dry.” Agatha cocked her head in abject horror. “You have a <i>medical</i> degree and you didn’t think that there was a better way?”</p><p>“Well, when you put it like that…”</p><p>She took a rag, getting it wet with a healthy amount of oil, and placed it along one side of Rio’s chest when the tape sat. “You have to soak it in oil to break down the adhesive, you’ll fuck up your skin otherwise.”</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>“I’ve had a few trans students, a couple years back one of them came crying to me because their skin was blistering and they couldn’t focus. I sent them to the nurse’s office but they were too embarrassed to go alone because their parents didn’t know they were binding. One of the many perks of being an openly gay teacher, all the little queers imprint on you.” She pulled back the rag, pouring some oil on the small corner that Rio had already picked at, gently massaging it in. “I went with them and overheard the nurse telling them how to get it off. Made sure the nurse kept the <i>incident</i> between us.” Agatha shrugged, slowly peeling the tape, making sure not to tug. “Info came in handy, apparently.”</p><p>She successfully got the tape off, nearly gasping at the fucking <i>state</i> of her wife’s skin. “Baby, how long has your skin been like this?”</p><p>“Couple weeks, it’s just dry.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha scolded, “<i>You’re</i> blistering.”</p><p>“It’s fine.”</p><p>You know the saying <i>doctors are the worst patients</i>? Very fucking accurate.</p><p>“Okay,” She worked her jaw. “I’m taking off the other, you’re showering, then we’re gonna put some soothing lotion on you. We can look into some better tape options, this stuff obviously isn’t worth shit.”</p><p>Rio nodded, eyes big and brimming with emotion. “Thanks.”</p><p>She got the rag wet again, giving them a stern look and repeating the process. “You need to take care of yourself.”</p><p>Rio nearly cackled, head thrown back. “Oh, that is <i>rich</i> coming from you.”</p><p>“You’re being awfully brazen for someone whose tit is in my hand.”</p><p>“You’re being awfully blasé for someone engaged to a Muppet.”</p><p>Touché.</p><p>She got the other one off, throwing both pieces in the trash. “All done.”</p><p>Rio hopped off the counter, kissing her cheek. “Really, thank you. For this and, uh… being cool about it.”</p><p>“You don’t have to thank me for being a decent person.” She responded, picking up the comb. “And, um, I should thank you.”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“Not listening to me about my shirt.” Agatha didn’t look at them while she spoke, because it was fucking embarrassing. “I wasn’t ready for…<i>that</i>. So, thanks-”</p><p>“You don’t have to thank me for being a decent person.” They echoed, giving her arm a squeeze before turning the shower back on.</p><p>Her eyes followed them, snickering as she saw their back. “Oh, my love.”</p><p>Rio took off their boxers, face scrunched. “What?”</p><p>She stifled her resulting chuckles. “No, nothing. Nothing.”</p><p>They got in the shower, an immediate “Agatha!” following.</p><p>“I didn’t know I scratched that hard!”</p><p>“My back is on fire, cariño!”</p><p>“Consider us even for my tits!”</p><p>Rio sadly groaned, wincing as the hot water hit their back, which looked like it had survived a fight with a cheese grater. “Fine.”</p><p>Later, after Agatha had gotten dressed in some of Rio’s sweats and an old Mass Gen sweater, after she had applied some aloe to their irritated skin and they threw on some matching sweats and a loose t-shirt, they both sat at the island. Her hair was still damp, as was Rio’s, both clutching their mugs.</p><p>She knew they had to talk, but fuck, it was awkward for some reason.</p><p>“So…” Rio prompted.</p><p>“So…” Agatha said back.</p><p>“What was last night, or this morning?”</p><p>“Fuck if I know.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>She raised her hands in defense, throwing them up. “I don’t know! What was it for you?”</p><p>Rio fidgeted with the handle of their mug, thumb rapidly tapping the ceramic. “I thought it was <i>more</i> than the other times.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her own cup. “Yeah, I thought so too.”</p><p>“Okay, good.” They exhaled a breath of relief. “I do have a question, though.”</p><p>“I would’ve expected more than one, but shoot.”</p><p>Rio gazed at her, hope scribbled all over their features. “Did you do that to…to feel close to <i>Alex?</i>”</p><p>The air in her lungs vacuumed out, reeling from that proverbial gut punch. “Huh?”</p><p>“It’s almost her anniversary, you said to Melina that you only fucked me last year to feel close to Alex.” Rio explained, voice inexplicably small. “So, it stands to reason…”</p><p>She chewed on her lip for a minute, trying to decipher if that <i>was</i> the reason for last night. Was it? She hadn’t thought about Alex, while they were doing what they were doing. Was it some subconscious plea to feel close to her daughter? Last year, she knew what she was doing, but this time…this time it didn’t cross her mind.</p><p>“I don’t think so.” Agatha gave Rio the courtesy of eye contact. “I think I did it to feel close to <i>you</i>.”</p><p>They offered their hand, setting it on the counter. “Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha placed her own in theirs, fingers intertwined. “I <i>miss</i> you.” She admitted, feebly trying to keep her voice steady. “I know we have <i>so</i> much shit to work on, I know that. But, it doesn’t feel…impossible this time? I don’t think I've fully forgiven you, and I don’t know how I’ll get there. But I want to try.”</p><p>Her wife’s lips curled upwards, tears pricking amber. “I wanna try too. I want to do that work. I want us to be good again. I want <i>our family</i> back.”</p><p>Agatha sniffled. “I don’t think we should tell teddy, though.”</p><p>“Oh, god no.” Rio furiously shook their head. “No, not until we’re concrete in our plans.”</p><p>“And Melina?”</p><p>“Maybe she could help? If not, we’re adults, we can make our own choices.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, then said “I’ve been considering what you said last night.”</p><p>“Was my dirty talk out of line? Because I promise I didn’t mean ‘I own you’ in, like, a ‘I have no regard for your autonomy’ kind of way-”</p><p>“No.” Agatha softly ran her thumb along Rio’s pulse point. “No, what you said about Alex and her not being fate. I think she might’ve been,” She choked out, “And we just learned the wrong lesson.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“We should’ve been better for each other, she would’ve wanted that. I can’t imagine she’s proud of how we turned out. I pushed and pushed,” Agatha’s voice broke, going taut as she wept. “I made it <i>so</i> hard on you. I made it hard on Nicky and ma-”</p><p>“Mi amor.” They interrupted, cupping her face, a loving comfort. “It wasn’t just you. I bailed. I gave up and let you push. I was your wife and I let you grieve alone. I was so terrified of facing the gravity of it all, that I-” Rio stammered, “I <i>ignored</i> it. I ignored what you were going through, what I was going through. I ignored Alex for six years.”</p><p>“I wish I could’ve seen her.” It was a choice made in the moment, to have Alex prepped and buried as soon as possible. She was offered the chance to see her, but her body would’ve been cold, face blue, eyes shut. Agatha regretted that choice most days, but while she was wrapped up in her early grief, she didn’t think she deserved it. She didn’t even fully believe she deserved it now.</p><p>“She, um” Rio’s hand left her face, wiping their own. “She kind of looked like Nicky, but her nose was a little longer.”</p><p>Agatha had never asked, and couldn't bring herself to for a long time.</p><p>The tears seared into her skin like angry waves of fire, but against all logic, they felt cathartic. “I should’ve held her.”</p><p>“No, you didn’t do anything wrong-”</p><p>“All I wanted was for her to know she was loved, and I didn’t even fucking <i>hold</i> her.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio sobered, purposeful with their words, empathetic in their delivery. “She knew you loved her. She felt that every day for almost eight months. She knew, baby. You held her longer than anyone else, you <i>carried</i> her. She knows.”</p><p>And the dam <i>flooded</i>, the steady stream of tears morphing into these hideous sobs that wracked through her ribs. She wasn’t sure if that’s how it worked, a mother’s love known from the body alone. Not applicable to her and Lilia, or Rio and Nicky for that matter. If Alex could know intrinsically, despite logic, that she <i>tried</i>. Agatha <i>tried</i> to bring her into this world, that the months spent growing her daughter were out of nothing more than her endless, and perhaps fruitless, love. Her wife pulled her in, strong arms encircling her, tenderly whispering “It’s okay, baby. It’s okay.” over and over.</p><p>What made a child loved? The hours spent in agony over their wellbeing? The stress and anxiety about the milestones? The support and encouragement that was bestowed unconditionally? The willingness to rip your chest cavity open, the offering and burial of your own heart if it meant your child would be okay? What made a child loved? Did Agatha do enough? Could she have done more? Did she let Alex down? Did she let Nicky down? <i>Is</i> she letting Nicky down? Had she spent so much of her energy on the child that passed, she disjointed her relationship with the one living?</p><p><i>What made a child loved?</i></p><p>“Stop it.” Rio quietly said, holding her as she undoubtedly cried and snotted all over their shirt. “I can <i>hear</i> you tearing yourself apart. It doesn’t help. You did everything you could for her, mi alma.”</p><p>“Then why does it never feel like enough?” <i>Why did Agatha never feel like enough?</i></p><p>Rio’s response was watery, fractured and tattered. “I wish I had an answer for you.”</p><p>The silence fell easily, a piece of silk clinging to everything laid beneath. It wasn’t bad, holding one another with no solution in sight. Because they didn’t have to figure out every answer today, they had time. For the first time in six years, Agatha and Rio could breathe. They could both sit with what Alex’s death meant, what the side effects were. If they were long-term or short-term, if the emotions they carried were just temporary or scarred into them for the long haul. If the cuts were superficial or down to the fucking bone, if the wounds needed air to breathe or tending to close.</p><p>After a few hours and Nicky calling Rio, the roads were semi cleared, Agatha dressing in the clothes she had arrived in and pulling on her jacket. They both agreed that it would be important to spend the night separate, they couldn’t just fall back into a relationship. If this was something real, something tangible, they needed to have boundaries. And though she’d secretly love to stay in the safety of Rio’s loft, she also needed to face the fact that she had things to take care of. Namely, an engagement to call off.</p><p>She pocketed the engagement ring, putting it in her coat pocket on their way out the door. Rio frowned as they watched. Agatha chastely kissed them, as much of a smile as she could muster gracing her lips. “I need to tell her in person, give her the ring back face-to-face. I owe her that much.”</p><p>“Better than me, I’d block the bitch and pawn it.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Rio drove her back to the practice, helping her unearth her car. She got in, starting it and letting it defrost. Her wife leaned their forearm on the open driver’s side window, saying goodbye.</p><p>“Are you going to tell Nicky?” Agatha asked, heater on full blast. “Not that you have to if you’re not ready.”</p><p>Rio didn’t seem worried, grinning. “Yeah, I think she’ll take it well. Now that you know, it’s slightly less…”</p><p>“Scary?”</p><p>“I was going to say petrifying, but yeah.”</p><p>“Are you going to be okay being alone?”</p><p>“Are <i>you?</i>”</p><p>No.</p><p>“I’ve survived this long, haven’t I?”</p><p>“We both have.” Rio said, leaning in for a kiss.</p><p>She shot a hand up, stopping them. “What if Melina sees?”</p><p>“Mmmmh.” Rio hummed, dramatically checking to make sure if the coast was clear. “Think we’re good. Also we’re two consenting adults-”</p><p>“Shut up.” Agatha muttered, yanking them by the collar and kissing them. She let it linger for far longer than need be, but she didn’t know when she’d get the chance again. This was uncharted territory, there was no guide on repairing your marriage after six years apart, after the death of a child. So, nothing was guaranteed. Agatha pulled back, letting go. “Go home and fix your bed, pervert.”</p><p>Rio smiled, dazed and loopy. “Text me when you’re home safe.”</p><p>Agatha flipped them off, Rio clutching their chest like cupid’s arrow had just speared them. She giggled to herself, rolling up the window and switching the gearshift. “Loser.”</p><p>She got home around 1PM, texting Rio before throwing herself into the task of <i>actually</i> shoveling the walkway. Her phone rang, Wanda’s ID on the screen, she declined the call. Agatha would wait until she was back in town tomorrow before saying something. The air was <i>beyond</i> frigid, but as the sun finally broke through the clouds and beamed down, she was at peace. Not <i>because</i> of Rio, but the things that had been left unsaid were out in the open, and that was farther than she’d ever thought she’d be.</p><p>Agatha finished the walk <i>and</i> driveway after an hour and some change, half assing the job enough that it was close to done. She minimally fed herself, stripping off her jacket and tossing the ring onto the entryway table as she went upstairs to take a bath. Her body was covered in sweat from shoveling and her body was <i>aching</i> from the manual labor and the night prior.</p><p>She’d never been more tired or satisfied in years, the mental load taxing but strangely rewarding. She stewed in the water until it went cold, eyes closed and heart calm. The grief had a light at the end of the tunnel, it was a keyhole, but it was there. Her wife texted her intermittently, not suffocating, not detached, a good balance. When the sun set and the house went ominously quiet, Agatha stood at the end of the hall in front of Alex’s door.</p><p>Agatha’s hand rested on the knob, metal latch retracting and letting the door creak wide open. She stood at the door frame, arms crossed and holding herself. Eyes scanning the space. She blew out a short breath, placing one foot across the threshold. Agatha froze, waiting. Almost as if she expected something to happen, someone to smite her down upon entry.</p><p>She blinked back any tears, she was sick of crying. Her other foot caught up with her first one, now barely in the nursery.</p><p>And Agatha–</p><p><i>What made a child loved?</i></p><p>She couldn’t do it, not yet. She whipped back around, moving into the hall like a coward. The door was still open, maybe she didn’t have to close it. Agatha could accept it as part of the house again. She could view without engaging and, eventually, she’d be able to go <i>and stay</i> in the room. Yeah. Yeah, that’d work. That’s something. It’s not <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>No.</p><p>It was pathetic.</p><p>This is what she made of her daughter’s memory? A dusty mausoleum. A creepy shrine of the life Alex was supposed to live. Fuck, her daughter would be so ashamed. The daughter still alive was ashamed, ashamed of <i>Agatha</i>. She slumped against the wall, her brain forging too many atrocities at once. The thoughts produced and faded too quickly for her to discern.</p><p><i>What made a child loved?</i></p><p><i>“Telling me to try when all you’ve done is give up.”</i></p><p>No, no, she was doing better.</p><p>She was at peace.</p><p><i>“Then I concede."</i></p><p><i>“You are being so fucking dramatic.”</i></p><p>The day had been so good.</p><p><i> “I think I’m fucking everything up, and I- I don’t know why.”</i></p><p><i>“Mi amor, Alex didn’t make it.”</i></p><p>Stop it.</p><p><i>“You pushed me away! You didn’t want me, Agatha!”</i></p><p>Stop it.</p><p><i>“Babe, there’s no bassinet, there’s no baby crying. It was just a dream, go back to sleep.”</i></p><p><i>What made a child loved?</i></p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Agatha pushed herself off the wall, hyperventilating.</p><p>She was alone.</p><p>She couldn’t <i>be</i> alone.</p><p>Agatha ran downstairs, grabbing her keys and leaving the house before her mind had caught up to her body’s actions. The roads weren’t <i>great</i>, but she’d survive, after all, she <i>always did</i>. Nobody had to worry for Agatha because nobody as stubborn as her could hurt. Nobody as fucking difficult as her could drown inside thier own head. Nobody who ended her marriage and punished her family for her own faults could be as weak as Agatha felt in the current moment.</p><p>After parking, she used the key that hung from her keychain to let herself in, pressing the button of the elevator to take her to Rio’s floor. Maybe she was clingy or desperate. Maybe Rio would tire eventually, from having to clean up the mess she was. But she couldn’t <i>be</i> alone. Barreling down the hall, Agatha roughly beat her knuckles on Rio’s door, hearing movement.</p><p>She rolled back her shoulders, praying her current mental state wasn’t noticeable just from her appearance. The lock turned, the door opening.</p><p>“I-” Agatha began, ceasing when a stranger stood before her.</p><p>“Yeah?” A blond woman, at least a decade younger than Agatha, greeted. Her beauty should’ve been the first thing that struck Agatha, but that’s not what knocked the fight out of her.</p><p>What did?</p><p><i>Mrs. Vidal’s AP Lit Class of ‘13</i> scrawled across the woman’s <i>ample</i> chest, Rio’s sweats on her legs. Her mouth opened, nothing came out.</p><p>“Can I help you?” The woman with a thick eastern European accent prompted. The 29? 30? Year old tilted her head, giving Agatha a real glance. “Have we met?”</p><p>Yes, that’s right, they had.</p><p>Over the phone when Rio was sick.</p><p>She <i>worked</i> with Rio, Agatha had seen her when she picked them up.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Her ex had been seeing other women, and went as far as to see one right after she and Rio had–</p><p>It didn't matter what they had done together.</p><p>Clearly it didn't matter to Rio.</p><p>They were <i>fucking</i> their colleague.</p><p>Or going by this woman's age, they were fucking their subordinate.</p><p>She wanted to fall to her knees, scream and wail and find out why she couldn’t get anything, even just <i>one</i> thing right.</p><p><i>Why did Agatha never feel like enough?</i></p><p>She cleared her throat, lying her ass off. “Is John home?”</p><p>The blond knitted her eyebrows together, bottom lip jutted out in a small pout. “No John here, sorry.”</p><p>“Wrong unit.” She croaked, stuffing her keys in her pocket to hide the evidence. “Sorry, have a good night.”</p><p>“You too.” The younger woman smiled, softly shut the door, leaving Agatha–</p><p>Alone.</p><p>Agatha pulled on her sleeve, using it to cover her mouth as a cry clawed its way from her vocal cords, her free one clutching her stomach in an attempt to regulate her breathing. Her feet carried her back down the hall, collapsing into the elevator. She jammed her thumb against the <i>Lobby</i> button, doors shutting.</p><p>She steadied herself using the bar mounted to the wall as the engine whirled, vision hazy from the fluorescent lighting and tears. She’d dug herself into a cave, believing it’d protect her. Confusing the reality of the situation with her own fucking delusions.</p><p>What made her so hard to love?</p><p>What made her so easy to dismiss?</p><p>And how–</p><p>How was it <i>all</i> her fault?</p><p><i>What made a child loved?</i></p><p>Was she just too cold?</p><p>A baron wasteland.</p><p>Uninhabitable.</p><p>Something wrong and twisted at her core.</p><p>Stiff to the touch.</p><p>Her very being, hardened and stone.</p><p>Evil.</p><p>The doors opened, sending her tumbling out the front door. Agatha stood trembling in front of the building, the sky blackened and lifeless. Her nerves numbed to the bite of the winter weather.</p><p><i>What made a child loved?</i></p><p>Nothing Agatha ever fucking did.</p><p>The siege had lifted, Agatha surrendering.</p><p>Succumbing to what remained true–</p><p>That a burden, no matter how compliant or apologetic, will <i>always</i> be just that.</p><p>A burden.</p>

<p>The line trilled, Agatha letting fate decide. She sat in the driver’s seat, phone to her ear, keys in her trembling hand. If the other end picked up, great. Missed call and she’d drive her car into the closest ditch. No, not really.</p><p>Well…</p><p>“We’re almost packed, booked tickets for the first train out tomorrow.” Lilia answered, the sound of <i>The Real Housewives</i> playing in the background. “And yes, I’m rotting your daughter’s brain, but that’s what grandmas do-”</p><p>“<i>Mom?</i>” Agatha’s lower lip wobbled, voice worn from sobbing. <i>Mom</i>. Not Lilia, not ma. She needed her <i>mom</i>.</p><p>Lilia’s tone switched, now laced with obvious concern. “Agatha? Sweetheart, what's wrong? Where are you? What happened?”</p><p>All questions Agatha would ask if Nicky called her in the same state. “I- I’m <i>so alone</i>.”</p><p>There was shuffling on the other end, Lilia most likely moving into the hall to continue the conversation. “Agatha, <i>where</i> are you?”</p><p>“In my car.” She choked out, fresh waves of saltwater hitting her cheeks. “It’s… bad again.”</p><p>Lilia sighed, not out of frustration, but perhaps sympathy. “Okay, it’s okay. I’m right here. Can you breathe for me like I taught you?”</p><p>There had been numerous occasions growing up when Agatha suffered night terrors, they had started up shortly after being placed in the system, and didn’t let up until about a year after she had begun staying with Lilia. A teenage Agatha would thrash in her bed, wailing and screaming. Lilia would rush in and soothe her back down until she was able to sleep again, gently rub her back and bring her water. The woman was a saint.</p><p>“Y- yeah.” She nodded, though nobody could see her.</p><p>“So, you’re going to even out your breathing and turn on your car. Do not drive until you feel strong enough to do so, I’ll stay on the phone with you the whole time. You’re going to go slow, and you’re going to tell me when you’re home.”</p><p>“You’d do that?” Agatha sniffled, shrunken and shivering in her seat.</p><p>“I’ll stay on the phone with you all night if that’s what you need.” Lilia’s words were tender, and genuine.</p><p>God, she just <i>had</i> to subject Lilia to taking care of her.</p><p>“Okay.” She whispered, taking a deep inhale through her nostrils.</p><hr/><p>“Who was it?” Rio muttered, screwing the damn joint together. There had been <i>one</i> open furniture store within a thirty minute radius, Rio had bought a new frame and spent their afternoon and evening breaking down the old one before building the new one.</p><p>“Wrong unit.” Yelena answered, walking back in, throwing her hospital ID badge on the dresser. The resident had asked to come over, her mental health leave ending tomorrow. Billy was the first patient death that she had felt personally responsible for, having taken off the past month because she was struggling to operate. She and Rio had met up regularly over that time, Yelena was like a stray kitten in their eyes. She just needed someone there for her that could relate, and the two of them were unfortunately bonded in that aspect.</p><p>Rio groaned, rolling their neck. “Could you hand me the mallet? The fucking thing won’t align, I’m gonna use brute force.” And because Yelena was here, they put her to work in helping them build the new frame.</p><p>The resident picked up the tool, handing it over. “How did you break your bed in the first place?”</p><p>They chuckled, “Ummmm.” lining up the beam to the joint socket. “Hold the other side for me?”</p><p>Yelena shuffled over, grabbing the other end of the wooden plank. “So?”</p><p>Rio whacked the thing, pieces connecting. They tugged, ensuring stability. “You remember my ex?”</p><p>“Yes…” Yelena cautiously answered.</p><p>Rio looked at her, motioning around the room. “Yeah.”</p><p>“I thought she was engaged.”</p><p>“Not for long, hopefully.”</p><p>Yelena’s jaw dropped, climbing over the frame and lightly shoving them in shock. “You sly guy! You are back together!?”</p><p>“No,” Rio smiled, dropping the mallet and flipping to the next page of the instruction manual. “No. We’re…on the way to <i>possibly</i> starting the process of getting back together. At least, I think.”</p><p>“You are back togetherrrrr!” She squealed, grinning like she was the one who had just won the love of her life back. “You won’t be so sad and grumpy anymore!”</p><p>“I am <i>not</i> grumpy.”</p><p>“You are not <i>happy</i>. Or were.” Yelena giggled, raising her eyebrows. “How did it even happen? And what were you undoing that you <i>broke</i> the bed?”</p><p>“Snow storm and , uh, <i>mating press</i>.” They coughed out awkwardly. It felt like they were discussing sex with their daughter, Yelena was sixteen years older than Nicky, but still a fucking fetus to Rio.</p><p>“But how…” Yelena scrunched her face, brain trying to understand the positioning.</p><p>“Like, legs over the shoulders.” Rio quickly spoke, grabbing the other bags of screws. “But a gentleman never elaborates, so that’s all I’m saying.”</p><p>She pouted, shoulders slumping. “I want an ex wife to win back and seduce.”</p><p>Rio snickered, rolling their eyes. “Maybe make your goal <i>getting</i> a wife first.”</p><p>“Where?!” She wildly flung her hands around. “Boston has no queer women that aren’t already enmeshed with their ex or closer to my <i>mother’s</i> age. And, not to be ageist, but I do not have mommy issues. Why is every lesbian forty-five and divorced?!”</p><p>They slowly turned to look at her, cocking their head, quirking one brow.</p><p>Yelena’s face fell. “Oh, not you. No, you’re different.”</p><p>“Doesn’t your generation use dating apps?”</p><p>“I’ve seen them all, dude. It is <i>bleak</i> out there.”</p><p>“Have friends set you up or something…”</p><p>Yelena pinched her lips, shrugging. “I don’t really have many.”</p><p>“What? You’re young. Don’t you, like, go out and–”</p><p>“I was sort of a shark in med school, obsessed with being the best. The other students didn’t really like that. Then I was so focused on surviving being an intern…” She briefly glanced down at her hands. “Other than you and Gulliver and Kale, I’m tapped out. And well, my mom, but that’s kind of sad to say.”</p><p>Stray fucking kitten worming her way into Rio’s heart.</p><p>“I’d kill to have my mom like me, if it helps.”</p><p>“I just want to meet someone like you met Agatha, at a bar or by kismet. Something cute and adorable.”</p><p>“It’ll happen. I am by no means a relationship expert but you have nothing to worry about. You’ll get there.”</p><p>The dryer downstairs buzzed, the cycle ending. Rio held one screw in between their fingers, the other pinched between their teeth. “Can you get that, it’s your clothes.”</p><p>“And your sex sheets, apparently.”</p><p>“You spilled the beer,” They pointed out, grabbing the screwdriver. “Not my fault you’re a surgeon with the hand eye coordination of a drunk toddler.”</p><p>Yelena got up, little stomps following. “<i>Cyka.</i>”</p><p>“I heard that!” Rio called after her, “I don’t know what it meant, but I <i>heard</i> it!”</p><p>An hour later, after Yelena had left, Rio cleaned up the rest of the room. Putting on the new sheets, throwing the old frame in the dumpster out back, fixing the slew of shit knocked over on the dresser. They tried calling Agatha before bed, but no answer. It was fine, she’d probably already gone to bed. Rio brushed their teeth, rubbing in a new layer of lotion on their blisters, and found the still dirtied t-shirt Agatha had worn for most of the time she had spent here. They put it on, it still smelled like her.</p><p>Saturday night had felt like the anguish and the grief and the dissolution of their marriage had vanished. It had all clicked back and they were just…Rio and Agatha again. No asterisk, no contingencies. Like coming home, like the clouds breaking after a storm, like no time had passed.</p><p>Rio walked into their bedroom, stopping on their way to bed to fix the picture frame. They propped in back up, the faces of their wife and daughter smiling back at them. Rio’s <i>family</i>, nearly back together. They gently placed it back atop the dresser, slinking into bed and turning off the light, the happiest they had been in years. The shirt drenched in their wife’s scent drowning them and lulling them into a deeply needed sleep.</p><p>Monday morning rolled around, Rio had been up and dressed for around an hour before Lilia and Nicky appeared at Rio’s door. Their daughter smiled, hugging them and going into a full blown recap of New York. The magnet was…<i>nice</i>, Rio dutifully put it on the fridge and thanked her. When Nicky ran upstairs to put her stuff away, their mother-in-law pulled Rio aside.</p><p>“Have you heard from Agatha?”</p><p>They furrowed their brows, trying to play it cool. “Not since yesterday.”</p><p>Lilia licked her lips, speaking in a hushed tone. “I don’t know what happened this weekend, but Rio, she’s not doing well.”</p><p>Rio cocked their head. “What makes you say that?”</p><p>“My daughter called me crying last night having a panic attack.” She narrowed her eyes, giving Rio a mom look. “I asked her what happened and she wouldn’t tell me. Did something go on between you two?”</p><p>“Wha-”</p><p>“In therapy. Did you fight or…” She blew out a breath. “What was said that I had to talk her down from a ledge? I haven’t seen her like that since right after Alex passed. She was-” Lilia shook her head, finding the words. “It was scary, to say the least.”</p><p>“Is she okay?” Rio’s brain reeled to catch up, because they fucking <i>knew</i> they shouldn’t have separated yesterday. Logically, it made sense. They could not be codependent on one another, but why didn’t Agatha call them? Rio would’ve dropped everything if their wife needed it.</p><p>“I got her to go to sleep, but…” She swallowed, softly shaking her head. “I’m worried.”</p><p>Well, that settled it.</p><p>“Mija!” They shouted, “Grab your mom’s gift, we’re gonna run over and give it to her!”</p><p>“”Kay!” Their daughter called back.</p><p>They needed to <i>see</i> Agatha with their own two eyes. Maybe she was regretting what they had done the night prior? Maybe it drudged up old feelings? Honestly, it could be a multitude of things, but Rio just wanted to know she was alright. With no Nicky, and presumably no Wanda, Agatha would spend the next six days isolated. Which, even without specifics, Rio knew was a bad idea.</p><p>That’s what family did, they were there for one another.</p><p>And what if Rio <i>had</i> done something wrong? What if Melina was right, that sex would only make things more complicated. Did Rio take advantage, the grief and vulnerability blurring the lines? Did Agatha pretend to be okay with their identity only to spare Rio’s feelings? No, that wouldn’t make sense, Agatha wouldn’t. Would she? Rio looked at the facts like puzzle pieces.</p><p>Therapy, blizzard, sex, reconciliation.</p><p>Therapy, blizzard, sex, reconciliation.</p><p>Therapy, blizzard, sex–</p><p>No, everything fit together.</p><p>Nothing that gave them an ounce of pause.</p><p>Agatha had been texting back, she didn’t seem distressed. What would’ve triggered a panic attack after so much progress? They’d taken the first step, they’d vowed to take more. There had to be more. Had Wanda said something, <i>done</i> something? Rio just needed to get to their wife.</p><p>And exactly half an hour later, Rio did indeed get to their wife. The townhome door opened, Agatha greeting the three of them with a fake smile. Her eyes vacant and accentuated with dark circles messily hidden with some make up. Her hair tied up, face dull and hollowed with exhaustion. Lilia said she got Agatha to sleep but it could not have been a restful one. What Rio focused on immediately, though, was the diamond now adorning their wife’s left hand.</p><p>Footsteps came just a second later, a lithe hand wrapping possessively around Agatha’s waist. “The whole cavalry!” Wanda quipped, now standing beside Rio’s wife. “Perfect timing.”</p><p><i>Fuck.</i></p><p>“Mierda, Wanda está aquí?” Nicky groaned, dragging her feet and walking in.</p><p>“Good to see you too, Nic.” Wanda let go of Agatha. “I got you something!”</p><p>Their daughter scowled. “Really, you really wanna try again? Haven’t we done this song and dance enough?”</p><p>Wanda, undeterred, held up a hand in a show of surrender. “I know I haven’t gotten it right in the past, but let me try and redeem myself.”</p><p>Rio’s body went numb, an alternate reality playing out in front of them. They darted their gaze to Agatha, their wife not giving them even a modicum of attention. Lilia nudged Rio, silently telling them to walk inside, which they did even if their feet were currently dead weight.</p><p>Wanda disappeared for a moment, Nicky turning her focus to Agatha. She held up the tote bag, presumably ignoring whatever Wanda was about to give her. “Should be big enough to shove all the student work in, there’s even a pocket inside for your laptop.”</p><p>Agatha took it, nearly clutching it to her chest. “Thank you, hon. I love it. I’m going to use it all the time.”</p><p>Their daughter preened “Good, it was either that or a mug and you have too many as is.”</p><p>“So, you had a good time?” Their wife checked, not acknowledging Rio’s very existence.</p><p>“Oh,” Lilia winked. “We painted the town red.”</p><p>Wanda waltzed back into the foyer, something in her hands behind her back. “So, while I was in LA, we had a meeting with this record company. <i>Huge</i> contract, big artists, the whole nine yards. After some schmoozing, we got the account settled, a miracle considering how hungover I was.” The redhead explained, though Rio wished she’d shut the fuck up. “<i>But</i>, I recognized one of the artists they represent. Not because she was there, but because” Wanda smiled at Nicky. “You’re always playing her very loudly in your headphones to drown me out, which I get, no hard feelings.”</p><p>“Does this story have an end?” Nicky deadpanned.</p><p>Wanda brought her hands out in front of her, a poster rolled up in a rubberband. “I twisted a suit's arm and he gave me a PR freebie after I told him my future step daughter was a fan.”</p><p><i>Future step daughter</i> might as well have been Wanda snapping Rio’s neck.</p><p>Nicky took the poster, skeptically unrolling it before gasping in shock. “Is this <i>signed</i>?!”</p><p>Rio leaned over, sighing at the signed poster.</p><p>Shit, that was a good gift.</p><p>“Olivia Rodrigo, right?” Wanda asked, though it was apparent she already knew.</p><p>“Wait, what the fuck.” Nicky murmured. “Why is this actually good?”</p><p>“I will ignore the ‘actually’ and just take the win.” Wanda laughed. “I may be able to score us some tickets when she tours next, if you’d like that.”</p><p>“I’m not stupid, am I?” Nicky smiled, like genuinely. “Mami and I went last year but we sat in the nose bleeds.”</p><p>Not Rio’s fault that Ticketmaster is evil.</p><p>“I can work my magic and get us VIP.” Wanda said, looking over to Agatha proudly. “We could go as a family.”</p><p>Rio’s wife gulped, a thin and weak curl of her lips following. “Yeah, could be fun.”</p><p>“Mami, look!” Nicky shoved the poster in their face, too excited to notice the disdain in their demeanor. “I’m gonna frame it.”</p><p>“That’s really cool, mija.” Rio politely spoke before glancing at the reason they were even here. “Agatha, can I talk to you in the kitchen?”</p><p>Agatha tensed. “About what?”</p><p>“Dr. Vostokoff emailed me something about the insurance payment not going through.” Bullshit, an utter lie, but a necessary excuse. “Should figure it out before Nicky’s next session.”</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha muttered, giving Nicky’s shoulder a squeeze before sauntering off.</p><p>Rio let the three of them talk amongst themselves, striding into the kitchen. “What the ever living fuck?” They whisper-shouted. “I thought you were ending things?!”</p><p>Agatha whipped around, clearly pissed. “Oh? Why would I do that?!”</p><p>“Uh, gee, I don’t know…because of this weekend?” Rio threw their arms up, keeping their voice quiet for their daughter’s sake.</p><p>She scoffed. “I didn’t realize that meant anything to you.”</p><p>“Why the hell wouldn’t it?”</p><p>“You tell me.”</p><p>Rio pinched the bridge of their nose in frustration, calming down before proceeding. “Did something happen?”</p><p>“Nope.” Agatha crossed her arms, nonchalant in her response.</p><p>“Okay, baby-”</p><p>“Don’t call me that.” Agatha raised an accusatory finger. “You lost that privilege.”</p><p>“Why?” They took a step towards her, pleading. “What the fuck did I do?”</p><p>“<i>Guess.</i>” She hissed. “What <i>did</i> you do?”</p><p>“You fucking tell me! I was under the impression we were getting somewhere!”</p><p>“Yeah, me too! And I was so fucking stupid to believe otherwise!” Agatha’s voice thundered, well, for a whisper at least. “Tell me, were you just placating me?”</p><p>“Where is this coming from?! <i>Talk</i> to me, use your fucking words!”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha defiantly grinned. “Here’s some words. <i>Fuck you!</i> This weekend was a mistake and no amount of sex can fix what's broken. I trusted you and you screwed me over.”</p><p>Rio twisted their lips, taking the verbal jab. “I didn’t screw you over, you can trust me, Agatha. I’d never…” They swallowed the hurt, they always did. “What did I <i>do?</i> Just tell me and I can fix it.”</p><p>“Why don’t you ask one of your girlfriends.” She spat, eyes welling.</p><p>“Jesus fucking christ! There’s no women, Agatha! There never was! I said that to make you jealous!”</p><p>“God! Is this fun for you? Do you get off on it? The lies?”</p><p>“No, you’re actually breaking my fucking heart. <i>Again</i>, I might add!”</p><p>“Always the fucking victim.” Agatha bunched her fists, bringing them to her head like she was about to rip out her hair. “You broke mine! You took advantage of my vulnerability, I should’ve known better.”</p><p>“I didn’t take advantage…” Rio stumbled back, because they hadn’t right?</p><p>“I was tipsy and sad and you played that god forsaken song…” Her voice wobbled. “It wasn’t real, any of it.”</p><p>The tears <i>stung</i> but they were nothing compared to Agatha’s words. “Is this about me? What I told you?”</p><p>“Don’t be so self righteous.” She said, lethal and purposeful. “You’re hardly in any position.”</p><p>Rio’s resolve had been <i>slashed</i>, mangled and turned to dust. “Why don’t you <i>want</i> me?”</p><p>“We both know if it wasn’t for Nicky, we would’ve been strangers by now.” Agatha looked away, the admission seeming to hurt her as much as it aimed to wound Rio. “We can’t keep beating what’s dead.” And then, as if the coffin wasn’t already sealed, Agatha nailed it shut. “We died with Alex, it’s futile to keep torturing each other.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped. “That’s not true.”</p><p>“We weren’t fate, we weren’t something written in the stars. It was just chance, and we should stop pretending otherwise.”</p><p>“We can work this out in therapy-”</p><p>“I’m done with that,” Agatha sniffled, tears dribbling down her face. “I’ll do family sessions with teddy, but I don’t see a reason to continue with ours.”</p><p>“<i>Mi amor</i>,” Rio damn near begged, “<i>Please</i>, don’t push me away again.”</p><p>She shrugged, arms holding herself. “I can't live like this, Nicky deserves more."</p><p>“Nicky deserves her parents back!”</p><p>“Well, you ruined that, didn’t you?”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, blinking back the tears. “You know, I take <i>a lot</i>. I swallow and swallow,” They deflated, shaking their head. “But sometimes you just cut too fucking <i>deep</i>, Agatha.”</p><p>“You say that like it’s <i>shocking</i>.” She somberly chuckled, biting in her delivery. “You knew who you married, you knew who you divorced, you <i>knew</i> who you fucked on Saturday night. Right?”</p><p>“<i>What</i> happened in the last twelve hours to make you think that- that I’m some fucking monster?”</p><p>“Came to my senses.”</p><p>Rio’s heart beat, but it was out of time, the organ made of glass in Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“I really thought this time was different.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>“You said you loved me.”</p><p>“That was before I knew better.”</p><p>Dropped carelessly onto the floor, fracturing into too many pieces to count.</p><p>Their stomach twisted, their insides gnawing. “And Alex’s anniversary?”</p><p>“You and Nicky can go, I’m sitting this year out.” Their ex said, wiping her face.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>So, Lilia had every cause for concern, because Agatha <i>never</i> missed visiting Alex’s grave. Even if Rio didn’t attend, they knew from their daughter that Agatha held that day as something sacred. But, Rio didn’t know how to help. They couldn’t heal her with their love, they couldn’t fix what was wrong, they couldn’t <i>save</i> any of it.</p><p>The salvageable parts of their marriage, the scraps of their family, all crushed into a fine powder and swept up and blown away, winding through the air as something Rio couldn’t help.</p><p>“We’re not going without you.” Rio murmured, even if Agatha didn’t want them, they were still a family, right?</p><p>“Rio, leave it alone.” Agatha stood straight and rigid. “Just…leave <i>me</i> alone.”</p><p>Can you really fight for someone who’s telling you to give up? Do you throw down your sword and accept what’s right in front of you? They didn’t even understand what they had done wrong, yet they were taking the loss just the same.</p><p>They didn't have a response, couldn’t formulate one. Rio turned on their heel, a booming “Mija, it’s time to go.” tumbling out of their mouth. Nicky confusedly rolled the poster, shouting her goodbyes to Agatha. Sure, dick move not to have Nicky say a proper goodbye but Rio <i>couldn’t</i> deal. So they collected their daughter and went home, Lilia had driven separately anyway. Obviously Agatha needed her mom more than the piss poor comfort Rio could provide. Hell, maybe Wanda could soothe Agatha better than Rio ever fucking could.</p><p>Yes, there was a petty little voice in the back of their mind, one saying <i>tell Wanda about how you had her fiancée sobbing in bed this weekend, tell her to check Agatha’s chest and hips, tell her exactly how many times Agatha came and what she said during each and every orgasm.</i>, but that wouldn’t get them anywhere. Rio could be the secret, Rio could be the warm body only useful for a night. Because the alternative? That they were less, that they were nothing in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“Were you guys fighting?” Their daughter asked in the passenger's seat on the way home. “In the kitchen?”</p><p>“It was nothing.” They lied, keeping their focus on the road.</p><p>“Is it about the gift? Because, I swear, I don’t suddenly <i>like</i> Wanda now. If it makes you mad, I can give the poster back.”</p><p>Rio’s chest ached for their daughter. “No mi vida, it’s yours. We’re gonna frame it and I’ll hang it wherever you want.”</p><p>“So, what was the fight about?”</p><p>“Nicky, can we please just drop it? It’s not even noon and it’s been <i>a day</i>.”</p><p>“I hate when you guys do that. Treat me like a kid.”</p><p>“You <i>are</i> a kid.”</p><p>“But I’m not dumb.” She mumbled, fidgeting with the rubberband binding the poster. “You guys aren’t as sneaky as you think you are.”</p><p>What the fuck did that mean?</p><p>“Sneaky about what?”</p><p>“Nothing.” She swallowed.</p><p><i>Nicky swallowed</i>.</p><p><i>“Your child reflects your behavior.”</i></p><p>Rio pulled into the loft’s parking garage, killing the engine and turning to face their daughter. “You’re right.” They nervously tapped their fingers against the steering wheel, anxiety flooding their veins. “You’re not dumb, and I should be honest with you.”</p><p>Nicky turned her body too, eyebrows shooting up her forehead. “Seriously?”</p><p>“Seriously.” Rio said, eyes darting between the console and Nicky. “There’s something I haven’t been telling you, and I should. You deserve to know, and I want to share that with you.”</p><p>“Mami…” She prompted. “I can handle it.”</p><p>“Mija,” How do you come out to your daughter? Shit, they should’ve Googled this beforehand. “There’s something… <i>about me</i>. Not bad. But <i>different</i> than what you’re used to.” Better to bite the bullet now. “I’ve never really felt <i>super</i> connected to womanhood, like, the binary of it.”</p><p>“Yeah…” Nicky nodded, waiting.</p><p>“And I’m certainly not connected to manhood or men, but…” They paused, because were they even making any fucking sense? “I should actually go back, how much do you know about gender vs. sex?”</p><p>“Oh my god!” Nicky snorted the same way Agatha does. “Mami, just say you’re nonbinary, you don’t have to be so awkward about it.”</p><p>Rio reeled back, eyes bugging. “What?!”</p><p>“Yeah, I already knew.” She shrugged, putting on a faux parental voice. “But I’m really glad you felt safe enough telling me, sweetie.”</p><p>“You-” They tripped over their own tongue. “You <i>knew?</i>”</p><p>“You hid the tape behind the communal tampons in a communal bathroom,” She flourished out her hands in an <i>obviously</i> type of motion. “Plus, you kept taking <i>forever</i> to get ready in the mornings all of a sudden. You brush your hair, teeth, and get dressed. You’re ready in, like, fifteen minutes. Then you started taking longer than <i>me</i>, which is saying something because I got mom’s time management skills.”</p><p>“And- and you’re fine with it?”</p><p>“I have trans friends, mami.” Nicky said, “Told you I’m not dumb.”</p><p>“Damn, your generation starts young these days…”</p><p>“Do you still want me to use ‘mami’ or is that dysphoric?" She cautiously asked. “Because it’ll take me a sec, but-”</p><p>“No, no baby.” Rio smiled, so fucking proud of the kid they had raised. “I’m always your mami, no matter what.”</p><p>“Cool.” She smiled back, face then crinkling. “Wait, is that what you guys were fighting about?”</p><p>“No, your mom knows and was fine with it.” They think, at least.</p><p>“Mom knows?!”</p><p>“Therapy this weekend.” Rio waved her off, because there was no way in hell Rio was going to tell her the truth.</p><p>“Are you going to tell me what you were arguing about, then?”</p><p>“I’m not even sure what we were fighting about, myself.”</p><p>Rio’s phone buzzed, a frantic text from Yelena saying she forgot her ID badge at Rio’s and needed to stop by and grab it. They texted her back, looking up at their daughter. “We should go up, my friend is stopping by.”</p><p>Nicky side eyed that, but got out of the car.</p><p>Once they were back in the loft, and settling back into normalcy, Yelena barged in. No knock, okay then.</p><p>“My shift starts in thirty minutes!” Yelena declared, slightly out of breath.</p><p>“It’s upstairs on my dresser.” Rio directed, leaning against the island and putting in a grocery order on their phone.</p><p>The resident took off, passing Nicky and giving a quick “Oh, hi. Nice to meet you, I’ve heard a lot about you! You have beautiful eyes!”</p><p>Nicky watched as Yelena bolted upstairs, then glared at Rio. “Please don’t tell me I have two step moms to hate.”</p><p>Rio cackled, quite loudly. “She’s a coworker, mija…And sixteen years younger than me, and not my type.”</p><p>Yelena returned, badge in hand. “Okay <i>hurtful</i>.” She clipped it onto her scrub top under her jacket. “Also, is that Agatha in the photo in your room?”</p><p>“Yes.” Nicky answered, scowling at Yelena. “Isn’t my mom <i>so</i> pretty?”</p><p>“She is.” The resident agreed. “Like a Greek goddess.” She walked over to Rio, lowly speaking so Nicky wouldn’t hear. “That is the woman who was at the door last night. I only saw her in passing when she picked you up when you were sick, but I knew she looked familiar.”</p><p>The phone simply slipped from Rio’s grip, the dots rapidly connecting. Yelena answered the door, in Rio’s clothes, at night, right after they had–</p><p>And the call with Lilia.</p><p><i>Oh fuck.</i></p>

<p><b>August, 2019.</b></p><p>Agatha sat on the horrible metal bench, cooking away in the summer sun, surrounded by rowdy parents. She was pregnant, just barely, but it definitely didn’t make the day any more pleasant. She watched over the rim over her sunglasses as the game played out, Nicky sprinting up and down the field. Did she understand soccer? No. Was <i>her</i> daughter the very best at it? She might be biased, but absofuckinglutely.</p><p>“Why did I come to this?” Jen groaned next to her, fanning herself.</p><p>“Because aunts go to boring shit for the sake of the kid.” Agatha responded, pressing her water bottle to her overheated skin.</p><p>“How much longer will they be?”</p><p>“Who fucking knows, I can’t keep track. I just smile whenever teddy looks over here.”</p><p>“Rio’s lucky she gets to miss this.” Jen grumbled, obligatorily cheering when Nicky’s team had scored a goal.</p><p>Because Rio missed <i>a lot</i>, and often. Agatha didn’t hold it against her wife, she was aware of Rio’s insane work schedule when they had met. She didn’t appreciate her wife being gone sixty hours or more a week, but Rio made up for it. When Rio was home, she was <i>home</i>, entirely present and devoted to their family. She cooked and took care of their daughter, helped with the chores, doted on Agatha. So, if Rio missed some stuff, it was something Agatha would live with, because she knew her wife loved her job.</p><p>Agatha watched Nicky take off across the grass as she sarcastically joked “Wow, you're such a <i>committed</i> god mother.”</p><p>“I’m here, aren’t I?” Her best friend grinned, looking back to the field. “<i>Oh!</i>”</p><p>She jumped up onto her feet as Nicky tumbled down, hitting the dirt with a soft <i>thud</i>. Jen chuckled next to her, hiding it behind her hand. Agatha glared at her, lightly smacking her shoulder. “Jen!”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Jen cackled, “Kids falling down is always funny.”</p><p>Her daughter got up, tears in her eyes as her lower lip trembled. Nicky’s coach checked on her, sending her Agatha’s way with a nod. Nicky ran over, knee bloodied and scraped, little face covered in tears.</p><p>“Mamaaaaa!” Her six-year old whined, tiny body colliding with Agatha’s.</p><p>She embraced her daughter, placing a gentle kiss on her sweaty forehead and pushing back the baby hairs that stuck out of her braids. “It’s okay, sweetheart.”</p><p>“I h-hurt my knee.” Nicky sobbed, hiccupping out her words. “I suck!”</p><p>Agatha sat back down, letting Nicky climb onto her lap. “No, you don’t. You are doing so <i>great</i> out there.” She smiled, wrapping an arm around her. “You don’t have to be perfect, baby. You are so brave and strong all on your own, okay? You just try your best.”</p><p>Nicky sniffled, nodding.</p><p>“Now,” She looked over to Jen. “Should we have aunt Jen patch you up?”</p><p>Jen inspected the scrape, tutting. “I think we’re going to have to amputate the whole thing, you don’t need this leg, right?”</p><p>Her daughter let out a giggle, resting her head on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“I have some band aids in my bag.” Agatha tilted her head to her purse on the ground. “I <i>guess</i> we’ll save your leg, but just this once.”</p><p>Jen rifled through her bag, brows furrowed. “God, Agatha. How much shit do you need?” She moved fistfuls of junk around. “I mean, there’s a small drug store in here!”</p><p>“Hey, you try being a mom.” She huffed, resting her cheek against the top of her daughter’s head. “I’m carrying shit for three at this point.”</p><p>After embryo number five hadn’t stuck, they immediately did another round with number six, their final one. Which was a miracle, especially since the fertility drugs they used this time around had severely fucked up her cycle. Her first scan was in a week, her and Rio going back and forth about names already. She had announced the pregnancy to her wife by dressing Nicky in a Snoopy and Woodstock <i>Big Sister to Be, March 2020</i> shirt. Stupid and tacky, but Rio’s joy and shock had been worth it.</p><p>Jen finally found a bandage, some tissues, and the Neosporin. She used some of Agatha’s water to rinse off Nicky’s knee, dabbing it with the tissues, applying the gel, and sticking on the band aid. “Well, Miss Vidal,” Jen said, pretending she was delivering news to a patient. “I believe you’ll make a full recovery.”</p><p>Agatha gasped, peering down at Nicky. “See how <i>brave</i> you are?! You are so <i>good</i>, hon. A champ, really.”</p><p>Her daughter laughed, the tears vanishing and being replaced with a big smile. “Thank you, aunt Jen.”</p><p>Jen threw all the excess into Agatha’s bag. “All in a day’s work, and you can thank me by getting back out there.”</p><p>“What do you say?” She helped Nicky jump down, rubbing her back. “Think you can go out there and kick some ass?”</p><p>“Can we get ice cream after?” Nicky asked, puppydog eyes on full display.</p><p>“I respect the hustle, so yes.” Agatha snorted. “Now, go!”</p><p>Her daughter bolted back to her coach, sprinting onto the field a minute later, fully rehabilitated.</p><p>“I should charge you for that exquisite healthcare.” Jen muttered.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’ll buy you a cone.”</p><hr/><p>The way sugar dissolves into tea, the way honey melts on your tongue. That’s how she wished she could go, seamlessly and quietly, no fuss. Her body weightless under the surface, the world muted as the water lapped. The bath had cooled, but Agatha kept her head under, lungs beginning to burn, begging for air. Her heart slowed, limbs floating. But, she <i>stayed down</i>. If she never resurfaced, then nothing existed. She could ignore the day, ignore Rio and Wanda.</p><p>No body, no pain.</p><p>“<i>Agatha.</i>” A muffled voice echoed.</p><p>Her eyes snapped open, a blurred image of Wanda standing over the tub. Jesus fucking christ, what now? Agatha sat up, reflexively gasping for air, curling her knees to her chest. Any marks on her body had healed, so there was no need to hide, it was just instinctive. “Yeah?”</p><p>Wanda seemed confused, but didn’t address the behavior. “Is this it for your half of the guest list?” She held up the scrap of notebook paper Agatha had given her this morning.</p><p>“Sure is.” Agatha smiled on que, masking her inner turmoil. “Why do you ask?”</p><p>“There’s, like, ten names on here and two are Nicky and Lilia.”</p><p>“I don’t see the issue.”</p><p>She sat on the edge of the tub, frowning. “Babe, there’s got to be more people.” Wanda brought a hand up to cradle Agatha’s cheek. “What about your mom?”</p><p>“Lilia’s on there-”</p><p>“No, I mean your <i>real</i> mom.”</p><p>Agatha bitterly chuckled, gently removing Wanda’s grasp on her face. “I didn’t realize I had a <i>fake</i> mom.”</p><p>“Not like that,” Wanda sighed, patience already worn thin. “I know you see Lilia as your mom, but you never talk about your bio parents. I figured it would be nice if you guys could reconnect before the wedding.”</p><p>“Hon, my father was a drunk who skipped town the second the strip turned blue, and Evanora is <i>Satan</i>. They don’t put you into foster care for shits and giggles.” Agatha had never told Wanda the full extent of her childhood and didn’t plan to, Evanora might as well be dead in her eyes, or dead for real, Agatha didn’t keep tabs on her. “Leave it alone.”</p><p>“Are you being stubborn because you’re not going to see Alex today?” Her fiancée asked casually, like one would about the weather and not Agatha’s dead child. “Because we can still go, I’m sure Rio and Nicky would love it if you were there. I can even stay in the car if it’ll be a big thing for both of them.”</p><p>“I’m not going.” Agatha said, resolute in the decision. She didn’t want to see Rio, she didn’t want to mourn Alex, she didn’t want to feel <i>everything</i> that today entailed.</p><p>It had been six days since she backslid with her ex, five since she found out about the busty blond, and four since breaking things off. Rio had called and texted, <i>swearing</i> that the woman was a coworker and that they’d never do that. Hell, they had even shown up to the house a couple days back, demanding to talk about it all. Agatha had taken their keys, ripping off the one to the townhome, and chucked the rest into the bushes, locking the front door behind her and leaving Rio in the cold. They had hung around for about an hour before giving up and leaving to presumably pick up Nicky from piano.</p><p>Even if Rio was telling the truth, it wouldn’t change what she had told them on Monday. <i>“This weekend was a mistake and no amount of sex can fix what's broken.”</i> She hadn’t been referring to their marriage, she’d been referring to herself. Agatha wasn’t <i>just</i> broken, she was living life tattered into pieces. She couldn’t get anything right, she couldn’t face Alex’s room or her grave, she couldn’t be alone.</p><p>“Did something happen while I was gone?” Wanda’s eyes bore into her soul. “It would explain why my future wife ghosted me.”</p><p>“I apologized for that.” Agatha murmured, dropping her head against the porcelain of the tub. “Are you going to keep guilting me with it?”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth formed a tight and unsettling smile. “Just, try to round up more people. The engagement party is already underway, we’ll do the family dinner this weekend-”</p><p>“I thought I vetoed that.”</p><p>“Well, I reached out to Rio and she agreed-”</p><p>“They.” Agatha corrected, the pronoun switch being blasted in the family group chat that <i>included</i> Lilia and <i>excluded</i> Wanda. She had informed her after Rio had sent the text, the switch had yet to be made on Wanda’s end.</p><p>“<i>They</i> agreed that a family dinner could be good if you’re not going to the gravesite today.” Wanda said, annoyed. “I’m <i>trying</i>, Agatha. I am trying to be a part of this family despite nobody, seemingly not even you, wanting me to!”</p><p>“So you text my ex wife?!” Agatha snapped, water swishing around. “<i>Not</i> the way to go about it, in my humble opinion!"</p><p>Wanda stood up, paper crumpling in her fist. “You’re so fucking <i>difficult!</i>”</p><p>“Sorry.” Agatha sighed, slinking back down into the tub and submerging herself once again. The other woman yelled something else that was muffled before stomping away and slamming the door behind her.</p><p>Finally, peace.</p><p>Wanda had left for work by the time Agatha got out of the bath, she’d called in sick, just like every year before. Maria already knew, already had a sub booked. She thought about going to school, distracting herself. But then she’d run the risk of weeping in front of her students, and she couldn’t ruin her street cred like that.</p><p>Agatha didn’t feed herself, didn’t take care of her hair or skin after the bath. She put on some pajama pants and that old Red Sox hoodie and fucking <i>paced</i> down the hall. Opening Alex’s door couldn’t <i>hurt</i>, she doubted she could get lower than how she felt right now. Back and forth, to the door and then the banister, back and forth. She knew she didn’t deserve to visit Alex’s grave, but what about her room?</p><p>Her fingers hovered around the knob, forehead resting against the wood of the door. She lifted her head, letting it softly fall forward again. As if she could knock some sense into herself. And she knew, she fucking knew, how pathetic it was. How miserable a person had to be to struggle with something so easy.</p><p>Just twist the knob.</p><p>Just twist the knob.</p><p>Just twist. The fucking knob.</p><p>Fuck’s sake–</p><p>There was the sound of footsteps in the foyer, the front door closing afterwards. Had Wanda come back? Oh, Agatha grimaced. Wanda had come back, hadn’t she?</p><p>“Mom!” Nicky called out, <i>two</i> sets of footsteps climbing the stairs.</p><p>She whipped around, distancing herself from Alex’s room. “Teddy?”</p><p>Her daughter bounded up, black pants, shirt, and peacoat on, a house key dangling from her fingers. “Told you she'd be home.”</p><p>Rio appeared a minute later, matching their daughter in the mourning attire. “You were right, mi vida.”</p><p>Her eyes flickered between the two. “What is this?”</p><p>Nicky confidently said “We’ve come to kidnap you. We’re going to see Alex, and we’re not leaving without you.”</p><p>She looked to Rio, who just nodded, face etched with sorrow. “She deserves to see her family again, all together this year.”</p><p>“I can’t.” Agatha whispered, crossing her arms. “I can’t this time, I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Is it mami?” Nicky cocked her head, pointing at Rio behind her. “Because they’re real quiet, you won’t even know they’re there.”</p><p>“No, baby. It’s not that.”</p><p>“Also,” Rio nudged their daughter. “<i>Hey.</i>”</p><p>Nicky walked closer, hands in her pockets. “Then what is it?”</p><p>Agatha tried to blink back the tears, tried to speak without breaking down. “It- It’s just too hard.”</p><p>Their daughter nodded, considering. “Alex would want you there. <i>I</i> want you there.” She pulled out those fucking puppydogs eyes. “<i>Please</i>.”</p><p>Internally, Agatha beat herself. She was simultaneously letting down Rio, Nicky, <i>and</i> Alex. That’s a new level of disappointment, the trifecta. What kind of mother was she, to not even see her daughter on her birthday. She was sure she had given everything. Every tear, drop of blood, ounce of sweat–</p><p>And it’d never be <i>enough</i>.</p><p>“We can make it quick, if that would make it easier.” Rio offered, staying put at the top of the steps. “And it’s nice outside, a whopping forty degrees. Thank you, climate change.”</p><p>She pressed her lips together, her daughter reaching out a hand and grabbing Agatha’s, holding it. “I’ll help you get dressed and brush your hair," Nicky smiled, “I know you hate combing it out.”</p><p>“Let us help you, Agatha.” Her ex said, fingers tapping against the banister. “We’ll do it together.”</p><p>“Okay.” She rasped, too tired to fight.</p><p>“Okay.” Her daughter repeated, tugging Agatha towards her room. “Mami, give us thirty minutes!”</p><p>Rio took a seat on the top step. “An hour, got it.”</p><p>She sat in front of the mirror in the ensuite bathroom as her thirteen year old carefully detangled her hair, being the fucking adult in the situation. Agatha stared at her hands in her lap, stray tears dripping onto her palms. Nicky didn’t point it out, just moved the comb through her locks.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Agatha croaked. “You shouldn’t have to do this.”</p><p>Her daughter didn't falter, softly undoing another knot. “I don’t mind.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha looked up at her daughter through the mirror, eyes bloodshot and cheeks sunken in.</p><p>Nicky shrugged, smoothing out the strands. “Because you always told me I don’t have to be perfect, and it made me feel better.” She set down the comb, brown doe eyes locking onto Agatha’s through the reflection. “You don’t have to be <i>perfect</i>, mom.”</p><p>“You’re being nice to me and it’s throwing me off.”</p><p>Nicky rounded her, perching on the counter. “I’m sorry. If mami coming out has taught me anything, it’s that I want you guys to be happy. <i>Both</i> of you.” Her eyes went glassy. “I know I’ve made things rough for you, and maybe it’s ‘cause I thought mami needed me more after the divorce. You moved on first and it hurt.” Her voice shook, but she didn’t let it stop her. “I was angry. I still am. Because my sister is gone, and losing her made me lose you too. After a while, I got it in my head that you and mami broke up because I wasn’t enough to keep you guys together.”</p><p>Agatha placed her hand on Nicky’s knee, trying to comfort when her own cup was already barren and empty. “I am <i>so sorry</i>, sweetheart. I promise, it was <i>never</i> you.” She grinned, reaching up and gently tucking a lock of Nicky’s hair behind her ear. “You are my <i>everything</i>, and <i>more</i> than enough. I wouldn’t trade you for the world.”</p><p>“Can I say something, like, not as a smartass remark or snide comment?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“I wish you liked yourself the way you love me.”</p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>Nicky sniffled, jumping off the counter and rummaging through the drawers. “Is the blowdryer in the other bathroom?”</p><p>“The one off the den.” Agatha answered, her daughter’s words stinging worse than antiseptic in a fresh wound.</p><p>Just as bloody, just as brutal.</p><p>Her daughter dried her hair, going so far as to weave a braid at the back of her head, picking out a button up and slacks for her to wear, which she did. Agatha opened her bedroom door, Rio and Nicky both perking up at the sight of her. At least it seemed like they both wanted her there, that felt good. The three of them climbed into Rio’s car, Agatha in the passenger’s seat and Nicky in the back, similar to old times. Her ex parked in the lot of the cemetery, hopping out first to open her door for her. Rio’s hand stretched out, an offering, a truce perhaps. Agatha took it, her legs feeling like a newborn foal's as her loafer hit the pavement.</p><p>The day <i>was</i> nice, all things considered. It was sunny and pretty warm for February in Boston, the grass saturated in melted ice and snow, muddy as the three of them wound through the sprawling plot of land. Nobody spoke as they walked, Nicky carrying the bouquet, clearly handmade by her ex wife. Agatha hesitated at the fork in the pathway, knowing Alex’s grave was maybe only twenty feet beyond it.</p><p>Rio stopped, noticing Agatha’s halting in less than a second. Their eyes already shone with tears, a thick “<i>She’s waiting, mi amor.</i>” hitting Agatha eardrums. Nicky approached her, shifting the bouquet to her other hand and using her free one to grab Agatha’s. “We got you.” Nicky said, fingers intertwined. She felt her throat close, but took another step, snagging her ex’s hand as she did so. Even if she and Rio weren’t on the best of terms, that got pushed aside for now.</p><p>For Alex.</p><p>The three of them walked side by side, hand in hand, until they reached Alex’s headstone. They stood in a line in front of the grave, pristine in its upkeep, seedlings beginning to bloom as spring approached. The grounds crew here always kept Alex’s grave immaculate, which they should for how much it cost. The stone was marbled charcoal, a small Snoopy and Woodstock engraved in the top right corner, Agatha had paid extra for it.</p><center><p><i>Alexandria Emmet Vidal</i></p></center><center><p><i>February 20th, 2020</i></p></center><center><p><i>Your Mothers Love You So</i></p></center><p>Agatha visited at least a few times a year, but her daughter’s birthday always made it hit harder, stealing all the air from her lungs. Nicky let go of her hand, pulling out a violet, Alex’s birth flower, from the bunch before passing it to Agatha. Rio did the same, letting go of her and plucking out a flower. Agatha stood between them, limp in her grasp on the bundle of carefully manicured flowers Rio had grown and picked, especially for their daughter on her birthday.</p><p>Nicky let out a breath, looking at her parents. “Guess I’ll start?”</p><p>“If you want to, otherwise-” Agatha offered, her words already wet.</p><p>“I can do it.” Nicky said, cautiously kneeling down in front of the headstone. “Hey, Alex.” She delicately placed the flower atop the marble. “Been a minute, sorry. It’s just been cold as shit and you live outside.” Agatha let out a small snort, Rio chuckling beside her. “We <i>miss you</i> like crazy, but I hope you’re at peace. Maybe one day, we’ll catch up. I know you would’ve been a great little sister, even if you did steal my stuff, you would’ve come in handy as a scapegoat.” Their daughter used the sleeve of her jacket to dry her eyes. “I love you, and wish we’d had more time with you. You’re always with us, <i>forever</i>.” Nicky hastily got up, taking her place next to Agatha again. “Okay, someone else, go.”</p><p>Agatha wound her arm around Nicky’s shoulders, placing a chaste kiss on her temple. “You did great, hon.”</p><p>Rio cleared their throat, steeling themself. Their steps towards her grave were unsure, but they knelt down without a thought, another flower laid against the stone. “<i>Hi, mija.</i>” They tilted their head, hands clasped in their lap. “I’ve got some birth-” They hiccupped back a sob. “Some birthdays to catch up on, and I’m so sorry I’ve missed them. But, there’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think about you.” The breeze whistled through the trees, the leaves minimal due to the season. “I know you would’ve been just as whip smart as your mom, as empathetic as your sister. You would’ve been kind, and so fucking cool.” They tucked their tongue against their cheek, the tears trailing onto their lips. “I wanna believe you felt every ounce of love we poured into you. I wanna believe you felt me hold you. I- I hope I was able to provide you that comfort, because you didn’t deserve to go. We might’ve missed each other, but I loved you, I do <i>love</i> you, all the same. And, mi cielo, I’m…I’m so- so-” Rio’s voice shattered, shoulders hunching as the cries kept coming. “Sorry. I’m sorry I wasn’t there in time, I’m sorry I made the call that- that-”</p><p>Agatha’s heart needled, taking mercy on Rio and placing her hand on their shoulder as she knelt down next to her ex. The earth was soft beneath her knees, the mud staining her pants. She placed the bouquet in front of the grave, leaning it against the stone. She blew out a deep breath, Rio grabbing her hand and <i>clutching it</i> as though it were the only tether they had left to reality. They didn’t look at her though, gaze remaining on Alex’s grave.</p><p>She gnawed at her lower lip, the guilt and the grief swirling in her head. “Hi, my baby.” Agatha felt Nicky sidle up beside her, fingers lacing with Agatha’s once again. “Took us a while but we’re here.” All four of them in one place at one time since the funeral, where Nicky had bawled out of confusion, and Agatha couldn't do anything but the same. Back then, Rio simply watched as the infant-sized casket was lowered, not a tear shed or an emotion displayed. “I, um, I wasn't going to see you, didn't feel like it’d be something that you would want.” The tsunami of tears and snot overtook her, weeping as she fought to speak. “Sometimes, it’s too hard to face you. I <i>worry</i> every day. If I did enough for you, if I should’ve done more. I <i>really, really</i> tried for you, hon.” Rio finally looked at her, as did Nicky. “I know it doesn’t mean much now, but…”</p><p>“It still means a lot, mom.”</p><p>Agatha’s lip beaded with blood as her teeth worked, quickly swiping her tongue as she stared at the stone that represented her daughter. “I dream about your cries. I fantasize about your laughs, what they’d sound like. I- I wish for your peace, wherever you are. I <i>love</i> you. Soooo much.” She bowed her head in defeat, because there was nothing she could say that would be adequate enough. No scrambling of words would amount to her child, to Alex. She sighed, “Hera better be taking good care of you, I’ll kick her ass if she’s not.”</p><p>The sun beamed down, reflecting off the marble, shining onto them as they lapsed into silence. She didn’t let go of Rio or Nicky, sandwiched in the middle as gentle sobs and tender breaths were released. Perhaps this, <i>just this</i>, was something to Alex. Hopefully it brought her some solace, to know her family, however bruised, could heal long enough for her.</p><p>She didn’t keep track of how long they sat there, rooted just as the seedlings. Nicky got up first, excusing herself back to the car, blubbering and needing a minute. It was so quiet when Rio finally spoke again. “Thank you…for coming with us.”</p><p>“Thanks for kidnapping me.” She whispered, hand warm in her ex wife’s.</p><p>They ran their thumb along her own, peering over at her. “I think you’re right.”</p><p>“I usually am.” Agatha sadly smiled. “About what?”</p><p>“Sex won’t fix us. I didn’t sleep with Yelena, I haven’t slept with any woman other than you in <i>eighteen years</i>. Haven't deigned to even <i>touch</i> someone who wasn't you, haven't felt the urge to.” Rio’s face crinkled, not in pain, but acceptance. “I can’t bring Alex back, and I can’t mend what hurts you. I want to, I've tried to, but you have to do that yourself. I love you. I always will, I’ve never stopped.” Her ex squeezed her hand. “But you don’t need a wife right now, you need support. You need people in your corner regardless of expectations. So, that’s what I’ll be, for the meantime. ‘Cause you’re not on your own, and I’m not bailing this time around.” Rio chastely kissed Agatha’s knuckles, so fast that she would’ve missed it had time not been moving in slow motion, the warmth gone before it even registered. “You don’t have to be with me, but <i>please</i>, don’t marry <i>her</i>.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, devoid of a response as she watched honeyed eyes plead. Rio got up, brushing the grass off their legs. “You deserve someone who’d fight for you. You deserve good things, Agatha. We both do.” They made sure the flowers were secure against the headstone. “We’ll wait for you in the car, take all the time you need.”</p><p>As they began to walk away, they called out “You were wrong about everything else, though.”</p><p>She watched their silhouette fade away, becoming smaller and smaller until Rio disappeared altogether. Agatha whipped her head to look at Alex. “Please tell me you heard that.” She uttered in disbelief, speaking as if Alex would agree. “I fucking know, right?”</p><p>Agatha brushed her hand along the carvings, making sure it was clear of dirt or debris, like a mother cleaning off their child’s face. “Happy birthday, baby. I’d do it all over again for you.” She pushed herself up, twirling the engagement ring around her finger as she gingerly walked the winding road yet again. The end bringing her family, her daughter and wife. Agatha paused just before the cemetery gates, rolling her head back, letting the warmth of the sun bathe her, face tilted up to the sky. The wind was cold, brisk. A butterfly passing by, just a hair shy of her nose. Her eyes focused on it as it kept going on its way, floating farther into the surrounding trees. Its wings blue, flecks of purple detailed throughout, almost pearlescent.</p><p>Odd for winter, no?</p><p>She stumbled past the gates, getting into the passengers side. “Did you guys see that butterfly?”</p><p>“Mhh?” Nicky hummed from the back.</p><p>Rio’s eyes scanned around. “No, what’d it look like?”</p><p>“Blue and purple, kind of silvery.”</p><p>“Glaucopsyche Iygdamus.” Rio said, because of course they knew that. “Also referred to as Silvery Blues, ironically enough. The weather must finally be nice enough for them.”</p><p>Or, it was more.</p><p>A sign.</p><p>Fate.</p><p>Agatha let it go, putting on her seatbelt. Her daughter poked her head out, eyes puffy. “Not to ruin the whole <i>tone</i> of the day, but can we get food?”</p><p>The morning had blurred into the afternoon, so whatever Poptart Nicky had scarfed down for breakfast probably wasn’t cutting it anymore. Rio nodded, looking at Agatha. “Have you eaten today? You hungry?”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t eaten since <i>Wednesday</i>, but instead of admitting that, she said “Yeah, I could eat.”</p><p>“Ohhh, we could get some burgers from Theo’s.” Her daughter threw out. “We haven’t all gone in forever.”</p><p>“I don’t know if I can take the public today, teddy.” Even if it was a hole-in-the-wall mom and pop burger joint, Agatha didn’t want to deal with people who weren’t already in this car.</p><p>“We’ll do a pick up order.” Rio was already on their phone. “You want your usual, no onion?”</p><p>Her usual had not been <i>usual</i> in years, but, “Please.”</p><p>They picked up the food, driving back to the townhouse to eat. They sat at the dinner table, takeout boxes sprawled on top. Agatha <i>actually</i> began eating her burger, noticing Rio grimacing at their own. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Rio shook their head. “Nothing, they just put tomatoes on it.”</p><p>And that meant that the whole thing was contaminated in Rio’s mind.</p><p>Agatha snickered, pushing hers, free of tomatoes, towards them and taking theirs, switching the burgers. “Fixed it.”</p><p>“But that has onion.”</p><p>She took off the top bun, plucking off the onions and putting all of them onto the burger that was now Rio’s. “There.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Her ex chirped, tucking into their meal.</p><p>Nicky happily ate her lunch, seemingly content. “We should do this every year.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha said through a bite of her burger. “<i>Fun</i> day?”</p><p>“No.” Her daughter raised her brows, lips quirked. “But, it was nice to be together without fighting. Alex would be proud of us.”</p><p>“I agree.” Rio spoke, mouth muffled with food. “I’m proud of us too.”</p><p>Agatha set her burger down, her voice slightly hoarse from crying. “Thanks for getting me. This is…” Her heart swelled, feeling somewhat renewed. “I needed it.” She wasn’t aware just <i>how much</i>, but it made the day easier to digest.</p><p>“I told mami as much.” Nicky rolled her eyes.</p><p>She looked to Rio. “It wasn’t your idea to bring me along?”</p><p>They nodded towards their daughter. “All teddy. Only reason I agreed to family dinner with Mr. Blobby is 'cause I thought you wouldn't come with us.”</p><p>Agatha’s view snapped onto Nicky across from her. “Really?”</p><p>Nicky had half a fry dangling out of her mouth as she responded “You’re trying your best, you just needed a push...or a hard <i>shove</i>.”</p><p>The care Nicky had shown today, all bestowed independently, out of nothing more than her daughter not wanting Agatha to feel alone. For all Agatha’s faults, for all of hers and Rio’s together, they got Nicky right. “How the fuck are you so great?”</p><p>“Unexplained medical mystery.” Her daughter smirked. “‘Cause you two are too lame for it to be genetics.”</p><p>“Uh!” Rio gawked, slightly offended. “I’m <i>very</i> cool.”</p><p>“You knew the scientific name for a butterfly.” Nicky deadpanned, then pointing to Agatha. “And <i>you</i> spent hours researching tape and sending me links to cross reference the reviews.”</p><p>Her ex’s stare flew over to her. “Tape?”</p><p>Agatha sighed dismissively. “There’s a few packages on the way to the loft. Various brands with different adhesives to see what works, <i>don’t</i> try any of them until the blistering you <i>told</i> me about clears up.” She poignantly explained, evading eye contact. It wasn’t out of something deeper, it would just bother her until she ensured the issue was solved. Especially because she knew Rio wouldn’t scour all the reddit threads and other bullshit for feedback on what was considered the best. No, it was just reasonable for her to fix the one fucking thing she could. That was all.</p><p>“Nerds.” Nicky murmured, finishing her food and standing to discard the takeout box. “Does anyone want anything while I’m up? I need something to drink.”</p><p>“You can say that again.” She winked. “Is it a reasonable time to open wine?”</p><p>Rio checked their watch. “3PM.”</p><p>“I’ll take it.” Agatha groaned, getting up. “You in?”</p><p>“I gotta drive us back to the loft.”</p><p>Oh, that’s right.</p><p>Out of a pure leap of faith, Agatha casually mentioned “You guys could always stay here tonight.”</p><p>“Where would I sleep?”</p><p>“You can bunk with teddy.”</p><p>Nicky walked off, shouting “It’s times like these I wish we had a guest room.”</p><p>Rio leaned back in the chair, weary in their questioning. “How would Wanda feel about that?”</p><p>“Wanda isn’t on the deed, and I can tell her to stay at her place tonight.”</p><p>“And what about all the other nights?”</p><p>“Rio,” She lowly warned. “One thing at a time.”</p><p>“Fine, do you have red?”</p><p>“Merlot.”</p><p>They frowned. “Eugh, okay.”</p><p>She texted Wanda, silencing her phone afterwards, and poured two glasses of wine. Agatha met up with Nicky and Rio in the living room, flipping channels and finding a rerun marathon of old <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> episodes, which Rio <i>loathed</i> due to the medical inaccuracies but Nicky loved. Not <i>super</i> age appropriate, but she had bigger things to worry about, frankly.</p><p>Nicky sat in between them, blanket splayed over their laps as the sun set. The living room was dim as episode after episode played, Agatha stomaching the operating scenes. They weren’t traumatic by any means, just slightly nauseating. Upon the millionth scene where two characters hooked up, their daughter piped up. “How did you guys meet? You never told me.”</p><p>They absolutely had, but it was when she was too young to remember, probably a very watered down version of the real story. Agatha grinned, her daughter tucked against her side. “At a bar called Emmet’s. I went in for a drink after a break up, then I saw your mami.”</p><p>“I can’t imagine you guys young.”</p><p>“Oh, we had whole <i>lives</i> before you, mi vida.” Rio laughed, arm slung on the back of the couch. “Your mom was <i>relentless</i>.”</p><p>“God forbid a woman know what she wants.” Agatha pursed her lips. “Picture your mami, but with fewer tattoos, in a muscle tank and ripped up jeans. They were sitting at the bar and I very <i>respectfully</i> asked to join them.”</p><p>“Nothing compared to those low-rise jeans and baby tee you had on, and you commandeered the stool next to mine! Basically staked your claim!”</p><p>“I don’t recall that.” She haughtily raised her chin. “I sat down, we flirted, and…” Well, she couldn’t say that Rio had fucked her in the bathroom so damn excellently she thought she’d seen the light. “A few weeks later, we ran into each other again. I actually went back most nights for almost a month hoping they’d be there.”</p><p>“You did?” Rio sat up a bit in surprise. “You never told me that.”</p><p>“A hunter never tells its prey when it's destined to be dinner.” Agatha replied, absently playing with the ends of her daughter’s hair. “And they asked me out, and the rest was history.”</p><p>“Damn,” Nicky snorted, eyeing Rio. “Mom ‘masterminded’ your ass!”</p><p>“You always said it was chance! Fate!” They accused, pointing a finger.</p><p>“Yeah, I lied. Sometimes you gotta make your own fate, stack the deck.”</p><p>“Stack the deck you did.” Rio commented, slumping against the couch once more.</p><p>Nicky sniffled, quickly wiping her face. “Sorry.”</p><p>“Hon, what’s wrong? Did I say some-”</p><p>“No, no.” Her daughter curled her knees to her chest, just out of instinct. “It sounded really special.”</p><p>Her ex filled the gap, bypassing the elephant of their daughter’s parents no longer being together. “No, things got special once we had you. Which is saying something, because your mom crushed my hand so hard during labor, I thought I’d never operate again.”</p><p>“Oh, you’re fine.” Agatha breathed out, a smile playing at her lips. “Didn’t even fracture a bone.”</p><p>Nicky chuckled. “Small price to pay.”</p><p>“I’d pay much bigger for you, mija.”</p><p>And they had, in the toll of their marriage and second child.</p><p>Agatha excused herself to the kitchen, refilling her glass, Rio trailing after and typing on their phone. She pulled out the cork, wine flowing. “Work?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah. I’m just letting them know I won’t make it in tomorrow.”</p><p>A monumental gesture, because they must’ve already taken off to visit Alex today. Rio was not casual about missing work, never had been, it was always a priority.</p><p>“You don’t have to do that.”</p><p>Rio tucked their phone away in their pocket, extending their glass. “<i>I’m here.</i> I <i>want</i> to be here.”</p><p>Agatha poured them some, putting the bottle back in the fridge. “I’m sorry.” She turned around to face them. “For Monday. I was trying to hurt you and…”</p><p>“You succeeded.” Rio finished, tone holding no malice, only fact. “I appreciate the apology, but it won’t mean anything if we don’t do better.”</p><p>“I know.” Agatha sighed, grabbing her glass. “Can- can you come with me for a minute?”</p><p>“Agatha-”</p><p>“Just-” She started moving, motioning them along. Rio did so, following as she went upstairs, stopping before Alex’s door. “I- I can’t go in. I’ve been <i>trying</i>. I swear, I was <i>so</i> close…”</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, reaching out their fingers to trace the <i>A</i> on the door. “Why now?”</p><p>“To do better.” She whispered. “There’s a whole room in this house that I can’t touch because I’m too pitiful to even <i>walk</i> in.”</p><p>“You’re not pitiful.” They immediately corrected. “I doubt I could do any better.”</p><p>“You’re already doing better.” Agatha scoffed, taking a sip so the alcohol burned more than the words. “You had your big breakthrough and now you’re cured.”</p><p>“You think I’m cured?”</p><p>“Seems like it.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio exhaled, “It <i>torments</i> me. Every kid I treat, every surgery I perform. You know, sometimes I dream about it? Alice’s voice echoing over and over again. I can’t look at a clock without something as benign as a time of day stabbing me. I can’t- I can’t see you or our daughter without a punch to the gut.”</p><p>“How do you stand it?” She asked, near silently.</p><p>Rio shrugged as if to say <i>Whatta ya gonna do?</i> “Because what’s the alternative?”</p><p>“What are you guys doing?” Nicky’s voice broke through, waiting at the top of the steps.</p><p>“Drinking and commiserating.” Agatha said, pointing at the door. “Discussing the benefits of renting a wrecking ball.”</p><p>Their daughter shuffled down the hall, hand shooting out and grasping the doorknob. “You want me to?”</p><p>Rio stared at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio.</p><p>“You don’t have to do that, baby. It could be too much for you.”</p><p>“Oh, I go in here all the time.” Nicky turned the knob. “I mean, not <i>all</i> the time, but it was my room at one point too. It made me feel kind of comforted, to be close to her, connected somehow. I don’t touch anything, though. I usually just sit in the rocking chair and read or sketch with my headphones on.”</p><p>“You do?” She squeaked.</p><p>“Only when you won’t notice, I know how it is for you.” Nicky pushed, letting the door swing open. “There’s nothing bad in here,” She waltzed in as though it was the simplest thing in the world. “It’s all just Alex.”</p><p><i>It’s all just Alex.</i></p><p>Nicky offered out her hand to Agatha, using the other to switch on the lights. “It’s not so scary.”</p><p>Understatement of the millennium.</p><p>She cautiously took it, letting her daughter tug her across the threshold. And though her mind was <i>screaming</i>, her body felt strangely content, keeping the thoughts at bay. Agatha set her wine down, reaching out to Rio. “C’mon, I’m not doing this shit alone.” Her voice rocky, tears brimming. She couldn’t do it alone, so maybe, doing it together was what she had been missing.</p><p>They set down their own glass, taking her hand and crossing through the doorframe. Rio grabbed Nicky’s free hand, standing in the room, eyes darting around like the memories were washing over them all at once.</p><p>“See?” Their daughter beamed, carrying more weight than she was aware of. “Not so scary.”</p><p>She relaxed, using the physical touch to keep herself planted. “No, <i>it’s not.</i>”</p><p>“Why the fuck are you so wise?” Rio muttered, shimmying their shoulder to catch a few stray tears. “You’re a pre-teen.”</p><p>“Again, medical mystery.” Nicky snarked, gleefully holding her mom’s hands. “I’m probably the smartest among us, so this actually checks out.”</p><p>And the periwinkle paint didn’t seem so dull this time, the empty crib didn’t ache from the inside out but rather pinched and twisted. The cascades of blues and purples didn’t seem so frigid, but familiar. Life had returned to the four walls, if only temporarily. Agatha smiled solemnly, her brain winning out as it told her to flee. “I think it’s time for bed, yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio parroted, letting go of Agatha and their daughter as though they were afraid it'd start to burn like holy water does to the undeserving, the three of them filing out and turning off the lights.</p><p>A baby step, but one Agatha could say she had conquered.</p><p>And she didn’t do it alone.</p><p>They all went through their routines, Agatha loaning Rio a toothbrush and some pjs before tending to herself. It was almost midnight when she entered Nicky’s room to say goodnight, fondly looking on at Rio and their daughter under the covers. Nicky was showing them something on her phone. “So you have to guess before they make the cut.”</p><p>“<i>That’s</i> cake?!”</p><p>“No, mami, we don’t know yet. That's the whole point.” Nicky peeked over her screen, greeting Agatha. “You wanna see?”</p><p>“What the hell, sure.” She climbed in on the other side of her daughter, leaning over to watch the screen. “It’s cake, you can tell by the lines. That’s not stitching, it’s fondant.”</p><p>“No way,” Rio argued, engrossed at the sight. “That’s a purse, the leather looks way too real.”</p><p>Nicky giggled, hovering her thumb. “Wanna find out?”</p><p>“Play the damn video!”</p><p>“¡Ándale!”</p><p>She clicked the screen, a knife coming into view as it <i>sliced</i> through, or attempted to. The blade couldn’t break past the leather, revealing it to <i>not</i> be cake.</p><p>“Ha!” Rio shouted, “I knew it!”</p><p>“I’m not wearing my glasses!”</p><p>“Go get them,” Nicky quipped, “There’s a billion of these, we can do a rematch.”</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha bolted to her bedroom and back, glasses on her nose as she settled back into bed. “Gimme another, this is a point of pride now.”</p><p>So, they laid in bed, Nicky queuing up nonsensical video after nonsensical video. A waste of time, truly Agatha could feel herself losing brain cells. Inexplicably, it was the happiest she could remember being in a while, a soothing balm on the day. Who won more rounds is…not important.  Around 1AM, they were all exhausted enough to give up, Rio barely conscious by the final video. She began to get up to go to her room, Nicky’s grasp stopping her. Her daughter drowsily curled around her, Rio on Nicky’s opposite side. “Stay.”</p><p>Agatha went slack at the plea, head cradled by the pillow as her daughter slumped onto her shoulder. She kissed the top of her head, fingers carding through her hair. “Goodnight, hon. I love you.”</p><p>Nicky wiggled in closer, Rio already dead asleep next to her. “<i>Night, mama. I love you too.</i>”</p>

<p>There was something lodged against her throat, Agatha realized. Three sets of limbs all tangled with one another, she wasn’t too sure whose hand was lightly running along her forearm. She lazily blinked, confirming that it was her daughter’s nose digging into her neck, and her ex wife’s fingers on her arm. Rio wasn’t looking at her, but their phone, the touch being mindless muscle memory. Agatha scrunched her face, Nicky's steady puffs of air hitting her skin, sound asleep.</p><p>Rio’s gaze slid over to her, lips forming a wiry grin, whispering “She still sleeps on you like she did when she was little.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, the memories of Nicky as an infant burrowing right in the crook of her neck, holding her just as tightly as she was currently. “Still a teddy bear.” She whispered back, her feet shuffling beneath the covers like a cricket’s. Her daughter always slept in a tight ball, full fetal position, knees pulled up. So, the foot she just brushed was definitely <i>not</i> her daughter’s.</p><p>“I took pictures.” They said, locking their phone and dropping it in the covers, not pulling their foot back. It wasn’t even skin on skin contact, they both had socks on for gods sake.</p><p>So, she kept it there, barely moving. “You didn’t.”</p><p>“I sure as hell did.”</p><p>“I spent all of yesterday crying and my hair is a rat’s nest, I probably look awful.”</p><p>“No, you in the mornings was always my favorite.” Rio replied without a second thought. “Plus, it’s good to have collateral to embarrass her with in the future.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha snorted, her daughter grumbling but not waking. “She’ll kill us.”</p><p>"I'd like to see her try.” Rio rasped, face illuminated by the soft glow of sun leaking in through the blinds. Their foot brushed against hers, purposefully. “How are you feeling?”</p><p><i>Safe.</i></p><p>It was sweet, all things considered, but “You don’t have to do that.”</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>“Treat me like I’m crazy.”</p><p>“You’re not crazy, we all endured a lot yesterday. I’m checking on you.”</p><p>“NO.” Nicky groaned, quite fucking loudly near Agatha’s eardrum, she might add. “You’re playing some homo version of footsie with your <i>daughter</i> right here.”</p><p>“Morning, mija.”</p><p>“Morning, baby.”</p><p>Nicky yanked the duvet higher, shoving her face deeper into Agatha’s throat. “Mmmmh, morning.”</p><p>Neither of them pulled their feet back, Agatha quirking a brow and staring at Rio. “How are <i>you</i> feeling?”</p><p>“Kind of sad, but in a peaceful way, if that makes sense.”</p><p>“I’m hungry.” Their daughter said, muffled. “Thank you for asking.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, twirling the ends of Nicky’s hair around her fingers. “Shit, we have to feed you again?”</p><p>“Never ends with this one.” Rio murmured, kissing Nicky’s temple. “I can scrounge up something, I’m sure.”</p><p>“Good luck, my fridge is destitute.”</p><p>They stretched out gingerly, finally getting up. “I’ll make it work.”</p><p>Nicky popped up, bedhead that could envy Agatha’s. “Hear me out, <i>waffles</i>.”</p><p>Rio smiled, stealing Agatha’s slippers and shuffling out the door. “Yes, mi princesa.”</p><p>“You got them wrapped around your finger, don’t you?”</p><p>“Like you don’t.” Nicky sat up full, peering at Agatha over her shoulder. “Mami would do anything for you, for us.” She pushed the sheets down, getting up. “Pennywise is only out for herself.”</p><p>Damn, she thought she’d have more time before that harsh reality came crashing down on her. “Baby-”</p><p>“I’m gonna see if mami needs help.” Nicky jumped off the bed, disappearing as she rounded out into the hall. “I also need to make sure they load those bitches up with chocolate chips!”</p><p>Agatha laid for a minute, rubbing her face in an attempt to wake up….or keep herself from screaming.</p><hr/><p>Rio stood in the kitchen, their old kitchen, whisking the batter. Yes, Agatha’s fridge was barren, cabinets empty, but they were able to get the necessities scraped together. And they were happy to do it, cook a meal for their wife and child, like old times. Yesterday had been fucking brutal, but more satisfying than they had anticipated. Rio needed to get all of that off their chest, for better or for worse, Agatha needed to hear it.</p><p>Even if Agatha didn’t actually want them, she couldn’t stay with Wanda. Rio could see how Wanda was a punishment in their wife’s eyes, justice for what she had convinced herself she was guilty of, and it tore Rio apart. A way to self-flagulate, because Agatha was, above all else, a raging masochist. And though there were much healthier outlets for that, their wife needed to do the work herself. Rio had pulled the thread, given her a headstart, but only she could unweave what was tangled. Rio would wait, standby and help her up when she stumbled, but couldn’t do it for her. Which killed them a little bit, but Rio couldn’t remedy what they weren't aware of.</p><p>There was a faint buzz from the island, Rio whipping around. Agatha’s phone, face down, must’ve been left in here last night. They set down the bowl, scoping around to make sure they were alone, and <i>innocently</i> picked it up. They stared at the screen, Agatha and Nicky <i>years</i> ago, locked. Rio shouldn’t, that’s an invasion of privacy. However, their thumbs moved faster, typing in Nicky’s birthday as the passcode. Nope. Okay, Alex’s. Also no.</p><p>Rio sighed, leaning their forearms on the island, they doubted it’d work, but they punched in the digits anyway.</p><p><i>060207</i></p><p>The phone unlocked, and Rio smiled.</p><p>06/02/07, their anniversary.</p><p>Take that, Pippi Longstocking.</p><p>Rio opened the messages from Wanda, <i>several</i> from last night, more this morning. Looked to be a lot of Zillow listings for homes out in the burbs, none of which Agatha would like, Rio knew. They also knew that Agatha would never sell the townhouse, this was their family’s home, she’d never leave it for a cookie cutter Tim Burton satirical nightmare in a fucking cul-de-sac with an HOA. Not the type of person Agatha was, and Wanda didn’t seem to understand that. Then they scrolled all the way down to the most recent message, the one from just a minute ago.</p><p><b>Wanda, 9:41am:</b> Be there in two</p><p>“Are you snooping through mama’s phone?” Nicky’s voice carried, their thirteen year old standing on the other side of the island with her arms crossed.</p><p>“<i>¡Carajo!</i>” Rio yelped, startled. “Scared the fuck outta me.”</p><p>Their daughter smirked, unbothered. “Anything good?”</p><p>No, it was all disturbingly <i>not</i> good.</p><p>They locked the phone, putting it back the same way they’d found it. “This <i>never</i> happened.”</p><p>“I feel like this should go without saying,” Nicky tilted her head, eyebrows raised. “But I’m not a snitch, I can clearly keep a secret.”</p><p>“The bigger issue is, Wanda is on her way here.”</p><p>“Whyyyyyy?” Nicky whined, throwing her head back in a petulant show. “Hijo de puta.”</p><p>The door swiftly closed, okay so she has a key, great. The sound of heels clacking closer until the familiar redhead entered into the kitchen. She smiled, setting down a box of pastries. “What’s that mean?”</p><p>Nicky smiled back, all too sweetly. “Oh ‘puta’ is just another word for ‘pretty’ in Spanish, you should try it on my mom sometime. Score some brownie points.”</p><p>“Thank you for the tip, Nic.” Wanda then looked over to Rio, her eyes flashing with something that they’d describe as rage, only for her smile not to falter an inch. “Rio, I didn’t realize you’d be here when Agatha said she was spending the night with Nicky. Or wearing her pajamas…or slippers.”</p><p>“Well, we do have children together, so…” Rio passive aggressively smiled back, tone obviously disingenuous. “Always a pleasure, Wanda.”</p><p>“Where is <i>my</i> fiancée?” Wanda looked around. “I just wanted to make sure she’s doing alright after yesterday, grief comes in waves.”</p><p>But she couldn’t tell that Agatha had been a shell of herself all week? Or a shell of herself since they had met? Or did Wanda prefer her in a weakened state?</p><p>“Bathroom.” Nicky answered, sitting at the island. “What’s in the box?”</p><p>She opened it, pushing it across the counter. “Croissants, I got them from the cutest bakery downtown. I know it’s probably the last thing I should be eating when I’m going to have to stuff myself into a wedding gown soon, but-”</p><p>“Soon?” Rio questioned, cocking their head. “How soon?”</p><p>“Agatha has summers off, it only makes sense to plan it for July and the honeymoon for August.” She winked, “I have some connects in the wedding industry, so a rush wedding won’t be too difficult.”</p><p>Summer?</p><p>“Does my mom know that?” Nicky snickered.</p><p>“Agatha hasn’t been very <i>involved</i> in the planning, not everyone has the bride gene.” Wanda shrugged, lips pulled tight. “Your mom will be relieved that I handle it all.”</p><p>Rio rolled their shoulders back, turning and returning to their task of waffles and muttering under their breath “Controlling, overbearing, little-”</p><p>“That braid was a pain in the ass to get out, your technique is admirable ted-” Agatha airily spoke, waltzing into the kitchen. Her eyes landed on Wanda, face falling. “Hon-”</p><p>Wanda whipped around, kissing her, and throwing her arms around Agatha’s shoulders. “Morning, puta.”</p><p>Agatha’s face twisted in confusion, but she carried on. “What are you doing here-”</p><p>“You weren’t answering my texts, silly.” And though Wanda’s tone was light, there was an undercurrent of unspoken anger. “Rio and Nicky were kind enough to greet me. What a surprise.”</p><p>“It was Rio’s night with her so they just stayed over too.” Agatha explained, pulling back from Wanda’s grip. “Had my phone on silent all night.”</p><p>“And here I thought you were ghosting me again.” Wanda joked, but didn’t laugh. “Can we talk in private?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah.” Agatha said, motioning them both into the hall.</p><p>Nicky swiped the box of pastries, stomping over to the trash and shoving them in. She looked up at Rio with a grin. “Whoops.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, heating up the waffle maker before slowly inching over to the farthest wall. They leaned against it, signaling for Nicky to stay quiet as they listened in on the conversation in the hall. Yeah, not morally great, but they were curious.</p><p>“You couldn’t do me the decency of telling me your ex was here?!” Wanda snapped in a hushed tone. “She’s wearing your clothes!”</p><p>“<i>They’re</i> wearing my clothes because <i>they</i> needed something to sleep in!” Agatha huffed. “What do you think we did with Nicky around all day?”</p><p>“Then why’d you hide it from me?”</p><p>“Because any time I mention Rio, you get pissed!”</p><p>“Do not gaslight me!” Wanda bit out. “You treat me like I’m insane for thinking something is going on, but normal divorced people don’t have sleepovers. They don’t have their initials <i>tattooed</i>, they don’t keep their fucking wedding rings!”</p><p>Agatha had kept Rio’s wedding ring?</p><p>“Did you go through my stuff?!” Agatha whispered back.</p><p>“When you don’t tell me anything, you leave me no other option!”</p><p>“Nothing happened, Wanda! We were all grieving and it was just…nice, to spend time together in her memory.”</p><p>“I could’ve been there, I offered!”</p><p>“I didn’t need you there!” Agatha insisted, more assured in her words. “I didn’t need <i>you!</i> I needed Rio! I needed my daughter!”</p><p>“So, what? I’m not worthy of being considered family?”</p><p>“I didn’t say that.” Agatha sighed, frustrated. “It’s not always about you!”</p><p>“I sent you links to houses, I’m planning this wedding basically alone. You can’t even scrape together a guest list, and I’m the bad guy here?”</p><p>A gesture loses its weight when it’s conditional.</p><p>That seemed to sum up a lot about how Wanda operated. As if Agatha should feel indebted to Wanda for being with her. Rio’s jaw clenched, but they didn’t move. Agatha was a big girl, she was doing fine, she could do it on her own.</p><p>“I already said I’m not moving. Nicky’s life is here, her friends, her school. I’m not forcing her to switch districts right before high school, I’m not moving her farther from Rio.” Agatha said, resolute, a clear boundary. “And you’re the one planning this wedding because I wanted to wait!”</p><p>Atta girl.</p><p>“How long? How long until you stop prioritizing Rio over me?”</p><p>“Rio is Nicky’s other parent, you can’t expect me to disregard them-”</p><p>“She’s not part of our relationship!”</p><p>“<i>They!</i> Jesus, Wanda! It’s a fucking pronoun not a foreign language! It’s one word!”</p><p>“Could you listen to me for one fucking minute?!”</p><p>“Say something of substance and I will!”</p><p>Rio choked back a laugh, clapping their hand over their mouth so as not to give their eavesdropping away. Nicky watched them in confusion, but they waved her off.</p><p>“Is Rio the reason you don’t want to plan this wedding, or a life with me?”</p><p>There was a beat of silence, Rio’s breath eluding them as they awaited Agatha’s answer just as much as Wanda did. Their wife exhaled, some shuffling following.</p><p>“Maybe you should’ve asked me if I wanted that life too.” Agatha answered quietly.</p><p>“What do you mean? We talked about this-”</p><p>“We talked about-”</p><p>“No, no. I told you on our first date, I wanted something long-term.”</p><p>“That is not synonymous with a house in the burbs and a wedding that’d make Liberace weep.”</p><p>“Agatha, I’m thirty-five, my clock is ticking. I don’t have my brother, or my parents. How is any of this a surprise? How is wanting a family a shocking revelation?!”</p><p>“Do you want a family with <i>me</i>, or just a family in general?”</p><p>“Babe, of course with you-”</p><p>“Then, it’d be me and teddy.” Agatha told, not apologetic in the slightest. “That’s what you’d be getting.”</p><p>“I know that, I’ve made progress with her.” Wanda bitterly chuckled. “I’ve worked my ass off to hold a conversation with her. I just want something of <i>ours</i>, a kid and life of our own.”</p><p>Fuck her, anyone would be lucky to have Nicky as a kid.</p><p>“I can’t give you that, I can’t. I can’t do the baby stage and pregnancy and family planning after Alex, I can’t just replace her and-” Agatha’s voice wavered. “I can’t expect my daughter to be ready for that either.”</p><p>“She’s in therapy, she’ll get over it!” Wanda hoarsely yelled, hushed in the hopes Rio and Nicky wouldn’t hear. “You can’t let your grief overshadow your future.”</p><p>“Are you not doing the same fucking thing by pacifying <i>your</i> grief with a Dick Van Dyke wet dream?! The white picket fence, and the babies, and the nuclear family-”</p><p>“I’m moving on. That’s what normal people do, Agatha!”</p><p>“No, it’s what <i>you’re</i> doing.”</p><p>“Can we just-“ Wanda blew out a breath. “Can we put a pin in this until after dinner? I have to go into the office for a few hours, I’ll be back later tonight.”</p><p>“The office? With <i>Monica?</i>”</p><p>“Yes…?”</p><p>Agatha dryly chuckled. “Yeah, we’ll talk later.”</p><p>Rio flew to the other side of the kitchen, dutifully standing at the waffle maker, scooping the batter.</p><p>Another minute passed, the front door shutting. Agatha reemerged, posture rigid and uncomfortable. They peeked up from the batter, innocent as possible. “Everything okay with Chucky?”</p><p>“Fine.” She grumbled, sitting at the island.</p><p>There was a lull of silence for a minute, Nicky perking up as she spoke “I like this. All of us together in the mornings.”</p><p>“Me too.” Agatha chirped before furrowing her brows. “Which one of you tricked Wanda into calling me a bitch?”</p><p>Their daughter laughed, Rio holding up their hands in surrender. “I wouldn’t know a thing about that.”</p><p>“She just makes it so easy!” Nicky beamed, scurrying over to Rio’s side and pointing at the mixing bowl. “Where’s my chocolate chips?”</p><p>They rolled their eyes, reaching into the cabinet and grabbing the damn chocolate chips. “How could I forget?”</p><p>“I should make coffee.” Agatha yawned, getting up.</p><p>“I can do that.” Rio offered, motioning for her to stay put. “I got it, let me take care of breakfast.”</p><p>“You don’t make it right.” Agatha grinned, the light pitter patter of her feet carrying her to the coffee maker. “You don’t use enough and then it turns out weak.”</p><p>“No,” They reached out, placing a hand on the small of her back and gently pushing her back the way she came. The shirt she had on was soft, and they could feel the warmth of her skin through it. “You just make it too strong.”</p><p>“Meh meh meh meh meh,” Agatha mocked in a high pitched voice, pouting as she slumped back into the stool. “I <i>will</i> spit it out if it doesn’t taste right.”</p><p>She could spit it in their face for all they cared…or mouth.</p><p>“I’d expect nothing less, mi amor.”</p><p>“How about I make the coffee and if it’s bad, you guys are both forced to lie to spare my feelings?” Nicky glanced between them, knowing look on her face. “Or would you prefer to continue bickering as a means of flirting?”</p><p>“Mija, we’re not flirting.”</p><p>Rio liked to think they were, but plausible deniability was useful.</p><p>“This would be a very poor excuse for flirting.” Agatha said, “You haven’t witnessed us in our prime.”</p><p>“<i>Right.</i>” Their daughter muttered, grabbing the coffee.</p><p>After breakfast, and an entire afternoon spent doing nothing with their family, Rio ran home to change. On their way out the door, they slid on a patch of ice, crashing backwards with their wife's hands shooting out to brace their fall. Agatha caught them, one hand wrapped around their waist, the other suspiciously placed on Rio’s ass.</p><p>“You good?” Agatha asked, helping them to get themself upright.</p><p>“I should be asking you that, cop a good feel?”</p><p>Agatha’s hands retracted, crossing her arms in defiance. “Next time, I’ll let you eat shit on the pavement.”</p><p>“Temps must've dropped last night, I’ll salt it when I get back.”</p><p>“Thank you, I don’t need my mom breaking her hip tonight.”</p><p>“Lilia’s coming?”</p><p>“Wanda mentioned that she was.”</p><p>“Is she the one cooking?” Rio groaned at the thought of Lilia’s cooking, they didn’t get it often anymore, but it was never not amazing.</p><p>“Sure as fuck won’t be me.” Agatha huffed, annoyed at the possibility of cooking. <i>There</i> was Rio’s wife, disgusted by the thought of performing domesticity. “Maybe Wanda? I don’t know, I try not to be involved with her schemes.”</p><p>“Yeah, why is that?”</p><p>She pursed her lips, shrugging. “It’s not like she really wants my input, she’s kind of anal about how she likes things. Nothing out of place, or not up to standard. She just…wants everything her way.”</p><p>“What about what you want?”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hand, a shiny ring suffocating her finger. “I’ve been thinking about that more lately…”</p><p>Rio smiled, because if they could get that ring off for good, then maybe Agatha could start healing in earnest. “You should, you deserve-”</p><p>“Stop with the sapiness, go change.” She interrupted, turning Rio around and smacking their ass as a cue. Bold fucking move with their daughter inside, but they weren’t mad. “And bring more wine.” Agatha instructed, closing the door.</p><p>“Okay then.” Rio whispered, walking down the steps, a noticeable skip in their gait.</p><hr/><p>Agatha got dressed, did her hair and makeup, and all by herself thank you very fucking much. Today, with her family, had been strangely soothing. There was always an underlying sense of loss before. Like she was waiting for Rio and Nicky to seem disappointed in her, spiteful even. But after yesterday, the fear melted, it had eased. Because the two of them didn’t appear disappointed in her at all, they seemed more concerned about Agatha’s wellbeing. And that made Agatha consider her own wellbeing, which was…not fucking great.</p><p>The weight of Rio needing Agatha as their wife, and Nicky needing her parents back together, wasn’t crushing her. For the first time in six years, she could still. Agatha could take a breath, depend on them instead of the other way around. It felt like coming up for air after being under the surface for too long. She might be hacking up saltwater, but the wave had broken. Her daughter wanted to be around her parents, period. Full stop. The insinuation that she only wanted to be around them as a unit was no longer as prevalent. Whether that was intentional on Nicky’s part or not, Agatha was finding herself <i>very</i> grateful for Dr. Vostokoff. Three months ago, Nicky never would’ve had the tools to clearly explain her feelings about their family in such a confident manner.</p><p>She was proud. Proud of herself, and her daughter, and Rio. The vulnerability Rio put on display yesterday and today was jarring, but not necessarily in a bad way. They were doing better than ever, and it made Agatha want to do better.</p><p>Agatha opened her bedroom door, turning her head to scan the hall. Nicky must’ve been downstairs. She inched forward, slowly creeping to the end, to the door of the nursery. Her hand grasped the knob, stilling for just a moment as her heart rate spiked.</p><p><i>It’s all just Alex.</i></p><p>Agatha let the door swing open, the room looking no different. She apprehensively walked in, allowing her hand to brush along the crib as she did so. <i>There’s nothing bad in here.</i> The dust flurried up as a result, the particles shining in the light. The film covered her fingers, wiping the excess off on her jeans. Agatha exhaled, quietly backing out again. She left the door ajar on purpose, striding down the hall. <i>It’s not so scary.</i> And it wasn’t, not as much as before. If Nicky could find something redeemable about that room, then Agatha could too. It could be part of the house again, for the meantime.</p><p>It wasn’t that she didn’t believe Rio about Yelena or any potential women, she was fairly certain that her ex wouldn’t lure her into a false sense of security while at their daughter’s grave. It wasn’t that Rio wasn’t doing enough or not showing up. It wasn’t them, it was her. Agatha was, for all intents and purposes, basically a porcelain figure that had been shottily super glued back together over and over again for over forty years. Lilia, and Rio, and Nicky could only do so much, and Agatha didn’t want them to do more, that wasn’t their responsibility. She had to consider that ruminating in her pain would only amplify her darkest thoughts.</p><p>And there were a veritable <i>fuckton</i> of those, her lowest moment being right after Alex. Nobody knew about it and she didn’t plan on changing that, she didn’t need to be coddled. The grief and hopelessness were a drug that her brain had been simmering in for far too long, so, maybe she could improve? God, that sounded like <i>so</i> much work. But–</p><p><i>I wish you liked yourself the way you love me.</i></p><p>Kids say the darndest things.</p><p>Like words that haunt you even a day later, probably would until the day you die.</p><p>Agatha wished it too, honestly. If her daughter could recognize how low she felt, it was a sign clear as day that she needed to make a change. Alex’s room was a good way to start, leaving the door open, touching something. A goal could be walking in a little further each day, perhaps touching a different object. Who fucking knows, she was just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what stuck.</p><p>There was a knock on the front door as she reached the bottom of the staircase, unlocking it and greeting who she <i>thought</i> would be Rio. “I know you hate it, but merlot-”</p><p>Wanda smiled brightly, grocery bags in her hands. “I don’t hate merlot.”</p><p>Agatha awkwardly chuckled, “Right.” Shit, she forgot that Wanda was coming back. She really <i>had</i> to stop doing that. “How much money did you spend at Whole Foods?”</p><p>Her girlfriend walked in, frazzled as stormed to the kitchen. “Not much, I thought we’d do breakfast for dinner. Sokovian tradition!”</p><p>She should’ve canceled this fucking dinner, along with the relationship. Agatha didn’t want to be alone, but at what fucking cost? She couldn’t do the babies and the cribs, she couldn’t imagine having more children. Alex was it, Nicky was more than enough. Agatha didn’t want kids with Wanda-</p><p>Holy shit, she didn’t want kids with <i>Wanda.</i></p><p>“How <i>European</i>.” Agatha murmured, following. Nicky was already there, sketching with her headphones on at the island. “You cook? I’ve only ever heard you suggest Michelin star restaurants or takeout.”</p><p>Wanda let out a breath, exasperated. “I can make eggs and bacon.”</p><p>“Oh,” Nicky took off one ear of her headphones, setting down her pencil. “I’m suddenly vegan…<i>sorry</i>.”</p><p>Her girlfriend forced out a giggle, unpacking the groceries. “Spitfire, this one.”</p><p>“Is there a reason you’re so on edge? I promise you, we’re not a hard crowd to please.” Agatha furrowed her brows as Wanda frantically rifled through the kitchen for cookware. “I’ve fed Nicky boxed mac n’ cheese on more than one occasion.”</p><p>“Kraft is formidable.” Nicky impassively commented.</p><p>“I just want to impress your mom.” Wanda said, pans clanging. “Big night.”</p><p>“My mom <i>also</i> enjoys a bowl of Kraft.” Agatha snorted, minimally entertained by her girlfriend acting as though she’d be burnt at the stake over a dinner. “Rio is the only one who actually cares-”</p><p>“Rio’s coming?” Wanda cocked her head, tone shifting on a dime. “I didn’t know that.”</p><p>“It’s <i>family</i> dinner.” Nicky deadpanned. “You texted them about it.”</p><p>“I just thought that you had enough <i>family</i> time last night.” Wanda uttered, eye damn near twitching. “But that’s fine.”</p><p>The doorbell bellowed through the house, Agatha looking at her daughter. “Teddy, could you get that? It’s probably your mami with the wine. They might need some help if their hands are full.” Because who the fuck rang the doorbell anymore?</p><p>“Yeah.” Nicky said, slinging her headphones around her neck and hopping off the stool.</p><p>Agatha waited until Nicky was out of earshot before speaking to Wanda. “Are you doing all of this because of this morning?”</p><p>“What about this morning?” Wanda asked, pretending to be clueless.</p><p>“We’re not going to talk about it?”</p><p>“Talk about what?”</p><p>“You can’t just brush all of this aside.”</p><p>Wanda narrowed her gaze, titling her head, lethal in her response. “<i>Can’t I?</i>”</p><p>“Mama…?” Her daughter called out, confused and possibly put off.</p><p>Agatha put <i>another</i> pin that conversation, rushing to the foyer. As her sights focused, she was hit with a fucking tidal wave, and <i>just</i> as she was beginning to tread water.</p><p>“Who’s the hag?” Her daughter questioned, door wide open as a decrepit hand reached out to touch her.</p><p>“You’ve got quite the mouth,” A sinister voice stated, teeth bared in something close to a smile. “You know, I almost trained that out of my daughter.”</p><p>Agatha shot forward on instinct, practically flying the distance. “<i>No!</i>” She pulled Nicky by her shirt, akin to how a mama cat snatches up her kitten by the scruff, the outstretched hand falling short.</p><p>“Mom!” Nicky stumbled, her back softly hitting Agatha’s front. “What the hell? Who is that?”</p><p>Evanora viciously grinned, crossing the threshold into the house. “Your grandmother.”</p><p>Agatha steeled her grasp on Nicky, holding her daughter like something precious. And now, it made sense. The dinner and the stress. Agatha gritted her teeth, muttering under her breath “<i>Wanda.</i>”</p>

<p>“Her English is quite impressive.” Evanora uttered, eyes scanning the foyer.</p><p>“It’s my first language, bit-”</p><p>Agatha squeezed Nicky’s shoulder, lowly whispering “Sube a mi habitación y cierra la puerta.” <i>Go upstairs to my bedroom and lock the door</i> “Call Lilia and don’t come out until I get you, okay?”</p><p>Because Nicky’s room didn’t have a lock, and Agatha really needed another fucking adult on the way here if Rio was about to take longer than expected. Her daughter looked up at her, worried and confused. “Mama no, I wanna stay with you.”</p><p>“You’ve done well for yourself.” Her mother commented, hand running along old family photos. “You’d hardly be able to tell where you came from.”</p><p>“Baby, <i>please</i>, just listen to me.” Agatha finally released her daughter, watching as Nicky nodded before scrambling up the stairs.</p><p>“Where’s she going?” Evanora pointed, seemingly stupefied by Agatha sending away her <i>minor</i> daughter. “She reminds me of you at that age. Disobedient and unruly. Though, she seems far more…<i>undisciplined.</i>”</p><p>Nice way of saying Agatha didn’t <i>beat</i> her daughter, she crossed her arms as she fought against the tremor in her voice. “Get the hell out of my house.”</p><p>Her mother hadn’t aged a day in twelve years, still old and withered. Her hair was longer, but she still reeked of the menthols that always stunk up whatever shithole they were living in while Agatha was growing up. Evanora scowled, quirking a brow. “I was <i>invited</i>. Whatever woman you’ve fooled this time is much more accommodating than the last one.”</p><p>“Fine, I’ll call the cops-”</p><p>“And say what, exactly?” She took a step closer, testing just how far she could go. “That your mother entered legally after being asked to do so?”</p><p>“I’m telling you to <i>go.</i>” Agatha said, pulsing thrumming and body trembling. “Now.”</p><p>“You have the disposition of a frightened chihuahua.” Evanora observed, inching closer. “Are you scared?”</p><p>Oh, so Evanora came here for the power trip and the ego boost. How comforting to know that nothing had changed in forty-two years. Anything to lord her superiority over Agatha, anything to make her feel less than. But, she refused to give her the satisfaction, not this time. “You’re pushing seventy, I think I’ll survive.”</p><p>“Mmh, you always do, right? Leeching off one poor, innocent soul after another.” Eyes that reflected Agatha’s own, narrowed, boring into her. “You’re living a lie. The pretty house and prettier wife, the child that I’m fairly certain isn’t <i>actually</i> yours. How’d you perform that miracle? Convincing these good folks you’re one of them.”</p><p>She raised her chin, steeling her jaw, eyes brimming with tears which she would not allow herself to shed. “With absolutely no help from you.” Agatha took a step back, Evanora immediately taking another forward to follow. “I had to learn how to lie early on, to cover the bruises.” Physical or emotional. “You’re just bitter that I succeeded despite you.”</p><p>“Do you feel successful right now?” Evanora curiously tilted her head. “Still seem to be that whimpering, sniveling little girl to me. You’re standing in your own home <i>cowering</i>, while your daughter calls a woman who was paid by the state to house and feed you.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, backing up until she hit a wall. “You looked up Lilia?”</p><p>“She had my child in her care, so yes.” She stopped <i>just</i> shy of Agatha, cornering her. “I researched everyone important to you. Dr. Rio Vidal, the <i>actual</i> success in this sham of a family. You’ll have to fill me in on what you did for her to leave you, I’m intrigued. Nicola, an honors student, must’ve gotten her intellect from her <i>real</i> mother ‘cause we both know it couldn’t have been you. Wanda, pretty and respected in her field, she sounds kind. Lilia, absolutely loaded and delusional enough to waste her time on you even after all these years, after her obligation had been fulfilled. Alexandria, I found her obituary so there must be a story there." Evanora spat out each word, tone laced with venom. “And finally <i>you</i>. A public school teacher who has not moved a single centimeter in two decades. Honestly, you’re surrounded by impressive people who bear to have you around for whatever reason.”</p><p>She should’ve just hit her, it’d be easier to take.</p><p>“<i>Please</i>,” Agatha’s voice broke. “Stop.”</p><p>“And yet, you don’t appear grateful for any of it.” She motioned around. “You’re alone, nobody is here because they seem to know better. You could fade away tomorrow and nothing would change, Agatha. They’d probably be better off.” Evanora spoke as if she was doing her a favor. “I am no saint, but <i>you?</i> You pretend to be good, you perform so that others won’t see how truly miserable you are.”</p><p>She dropped her gaze, Evanora grasping her chin and forcing eye contact. The touch was light, but predatory. “You can’t hide from me, I know you. You are everything I lost and sacrificed. You, Agatha Harkness, are the worst parts of me. There’s something twisted deep down inside you, something <i>evil.</i>”</p><p>“I was just a kid.” Agatha croaked, shoving her mother’s hand away. “I was a kid, and you resented me even breathing.” She couldn’t imagine Nicky feeling how she did as a child, unwanted and unloved. Agatha had pieced together in her late teens that Evanora was spiteful of her very existence, always would be. Because Agatha halted Evanora’s own life and ambitions, and it spiraled her lower and lower, dragging Agatha down too. “I was good, I <i>can</i> be good.”</p><p>“No you cannot.” Her mother whispered, aiming for the jugular. “I ought to have killed you when I had the chance. I should have the moment you left my body. Do you think that’s why your daughter died? She sensed your true nature-”</p><p>“Mrs. Harkness!” Wanda’s voice called out, heels clacking along. Her mother stepped away, turning around. Wanda smiled, extending her hand to shake. “Oh my god, I can see the resemblance. You two have the <i>exact</i> same eyes."</p><p>Agatha wanted to find the nearest cliffside to <i>fling</i> herself from upon hearing that. Something curdling inside her gut, the simplest acknowledgement that she received anything from her mother. Her eyes, or blood, or heartlessness, her sadism. That she inherited any of it, even if against her will, all coursing through her day after day.</p><p>Evanora took her hand, demeanor morphing into a sweet old lady. “Wanda, dear, thank you for hosting. And it’s <i>Ms. Harkness</i>, the bastard never made an honest woman out of me.”</p><p>She snorted, murmuring “Gee, wonder why.”</p><p>“Babe,” Wanda scolded, face falling. “Don’t speak to your mom like that.”</p><p>“She’s not my mom!” Agatha pushed herself off the wall, screaming because apparently <i>no one</i> ever fucking heard her. “She’s the woman who wouldn’t feed me, she’s the woman who’d lock me in my room until I bruised my hands banging at the door! She’s the woman who <i>beat</i> me when she was sad, or angry, or because it was Wednesday and she was upset I still existed!” Her throat felt raw, that vein in her forehead popping out. “She’s <i>not</i> my mom! She lost custody of me and spent five years incarcerated for child abuse and neglect!”</p><p>“Four and half, I got out early for good behavior.” Evanoa added. “But-”</p><p>“Shut the fuck up!” She screeched, needing to handle one thing at a time. Agatha glared at Wanda, curling her hands into fists. “I told you to leave it alone, and because you can <i>never</i> leave anything alone, you pushed. You push and push, and I have nothing left to give!”</p><p>“Agatha, I didn’t know-” Wanda began.</p><p>“But it wasn’t enough for you to just <i>listen</i> to me.”</p><p>The front door opened, but she barely registered it over the bloodrush echoing in her ears.</p><p>“Nothing happened, hon.” Wanda said, trying to soothe. “We can ask her to leave if it’s too much. I think you’re overreacting-”</p><p>“The fuck?!” Her wife’s voice projected.</p><p>Agatha whipped her head, Rio standing in the doorway, wide-eyed in terror and hands full of wine. They set the bottles on the entryway table, storming over to Wanda and grabbing her by the collar of her shirt. “The fuck did you just say to the <i>mother of my children?!</i>” Their gaze flickered over to Evanora, hastily pushing Wanda back, “What did you do?!” stomping over to Agatha’s mother.</p><p>“Rio-” She tried, not all that well to be fair.</p><p>Her wife curled their fingers in Evanora’s jacket, hauling her back and slamming the older woman against the closest wall. “Jesus!” Evanora gasped, “<i>You people</i> are always so violent, like rabid dogs.”</p><p>Rio bitterly chuckled, winding back a fist. “Yup.” The cracking of bone rang out, Rio’s knuckles connecting with Evanora’s face as fast as Agatha could blink. “What did I tell you about coming near my wife and child?”</p><p>“Oh!” Wanda winced, clutching her chest in shock.</p><p>Evanora slumped against the wall, clapping her hand over her face in agony, blood spilling down. “Are you insane?!"</p><p>Rio rapidly flexed their hand, sucking in a breath at the pain. “You’re fine. It wasn’t even my dominant hand, you’re not worth my career, bitch.” They stared down at Evanora, bitter smile on their lips. “Or, is it not fun to have someone stronger than you using your body as a punching bag? Does it feel demoralizing to have your face bashed in?” Rio crouched down, batting Evanora’s hand away. “Do you feel small? Worthless?”</p><p>Her mother’s nose was definitely broken as she responded. “This is <i>assault,</i> you mutt.”</p><p>They cluelessly shook their head. “I’m sure any witnesses will agree that it was self defense. After all, <i>you’re</i> the one with a violent crime record.” Rio stood, opening the front door. “Get the fuck off my property. If I see you again, you’ll need more than a few stitches and a splint.”</p><p>Evanora shakily got up, glaring at Agatha. “My mistake, you’ve apparently found company just as <i>vile</i> as you.”</p><p>And if her legs worked, Agatha would’ve dragged Evanora out herself. Luckily, Rio had the same idea, fisting a hold in Evanora’s hair, and <i>pulling</i> her out the door. They shoved her over  the threshold, slamming the door after her. There was the sound of a yelp, followed by a <i>thud</i> of a body colliding with hard concrete. Ah, the ice patch.</p><p>They rushed over to her, gently cradling Agatha’s face and using their thumb to swipe away the tears she hadn’t realized were trekking down her cheeks. “Mi amor, are you okay? Did she do anything, hurt you?”</p><p>Not physically.</p><p>“I’m fine.” Agatha shuddered, leaning into the touch.</p><p>Rio looked back at Wanda. “Why the fuck would you invite her here?”</p><p>“I didn’t know!” Wanda ground out. “I found her on Facebook! Nothing happened, she left. Everyone is safe. I’m sorry-”</p><p>“No you’re not, you’re cruel.” Agatha’s eyebrows shot up, blood boiling in her veins. “You brought her to my <i>house</i>. You brought her around <i>my child</i>. For what? What did you hope to gain?!” She let Rio’s hand slide off her face as she approached Wanda. “I told you I didn’t want her in my life and you ignored me, just like everything else that doesn’t serve you.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda said as though she were explaining something to a small child. “Family is forever. I thought that reuniting you two would start to heal your grief, fixing your mother wound could make you see-”</p><p>“Fucking hell! When your village was bombed, did you smack your head on the rubble?!” Agatha yelled, wildly gesturing. “You know, you make me envy prisoners of war, because at least they only endure <i>waterboarding!</i> You’re a special kind of torture! You got inside my brain and made me believe I deserved this. You make me feel worse, you make me remember the worst parts of myself!”</p><p>“You say that like there aren’t about a million of those!”</p><p>“Oh fuck you,” Agatha scoffed. “You’re just as broken as me, you just hide under a smile and a perfectly manicured exterior!”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes bugged, gritting her teeth. “You’re right, but at least it’s not written in my fucking DNA.” She pointed towards the door. “I mean, that just explained a whole lot about why you are the way you are! You can act like blood doesn’t affect who you’ve become but I’m just glad Nicky doesn’t have to worry about it.”</p><p>Rio lurched forward, Agatha grabbing their wrist to stop them. “Not worth it-”</p><p>“Heel.” Wanda muttered, “She doesn’t need a guard dog.”</p><p><i>That</i> felt racially charged.</p><p>She blinked, fingers twitching. “<i>What</i> did you just say to them?”</p><p>“I-” Wanda didn’t finish the sentence before Agatha’s hand <i>whipped</i> across her cheek, slapping her. She tore the ring off her hand, chucking it to the ground. “And for the record, I fucked Rio a week ago. I hope you have better luck making Monica come because god knows you didn’t do shit for me.”</p><p>Wanda clutched her face, working her jaw. “This family is a <i>curse</i>, deformed at best and dysfunctional at worst.” She grabbed her bag, fishing out her house key and slamming it on the entryway table, prying open the door. “You’ll be hearing from my lawyer.”</p><p>“Looked like self defense to me.” Rio shrugged. “You brought a known criminal and abuser into a home with a child.” They narrowed their eyes. “By all means, let’s ask the minor if she felt safe here tonight. Any judge worth a damn could look at the testimony of a scared thirteen year old claiming she thought you’d hurt her mom, and determine that Agatha was lawful in her actions in her own home. You’re getting off light, because I would’ve done worse than a bitch-slap.”</p><p>“You two <i>really</i> deserve each other.” Wanda hissed, slamming the door behind her. They both waited for a beat, the sound of another thudding against the pavement. “God damnit!”</p><p><i>Ice patch.</i></p><p>Agatha finally crumpled, falling to her knees as the sobs ripped through her. The familiar touch of Rio’s hand on her back, an arm wrapping around her. They pulled her close, almost scooping her up in their lap. “It’s okay, baby.”</p><p>“It’s not.” She forced out. “She could’ve hurt Nicky.”</p><p>“That’s not your fault, mi amor. You didn’t do anything wrong, you protected her.” Rio’s eyes scanned around. “I’m sure you put her first.”</p><p>“She’s upstairs.” Agatha wailed, crying into Rio’s chest. “I- I sent her away.”</p><p>“See? You kept her <i>safe.</i> You did everything right.” Rio's words were gentle as they placed a delicate kiss atop her head. “You did good. You did <i>so</i> good, cariño.”</p><p>And as Rio collected the porcelain shards of what was left of her, Agatha could only think <i>Don’t put me back together this time.</i> “I’m sorry.” She hiccupped, “I’m <i>so</i> sorry.”</p><p>“You have nothing to apologize for,” Her wife said, firm and unwavering. “You survived.”</p><p>Because she always did, right?</p><p>For better or worse.</p><p>She burdened everyone for her own gain.</p><p>Took and took–</p><p>Like a goddamn, infernal leech.</p><hr/><p>The creaking of the stairs stole Rio’s focus, lifting their eyes to see their daughter coming down. Fuck, they had hoped to have a few more minutes to get Agatha up, but seeing Nicky safe was a relief. They help their wife up, their hands staying steady on her waist because they weren’t sure if Agatha could hold her own body weight up.</p><p>Nicky came bounding, arms thrown around Agatha, unabashedly <i>hugging</i> her. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha engulfed their daughter, hoarsely saying “I’m fine, hon. I thought I told you to wait for me.”</p><p>“It went quiet down here, I figured it was safe.” Nicky squeezed her tighter. “You’re crying.”</p><p>“I do that a lot.” She said through a watery chuckle. “Are <i>you</i> okay?”</p><p>“That was your birth mother?” Nicky asked, face crinkling. “She’s kind of a cunt.”</p><p>Their daughter knew Lilia didn’t literally birth Agatha, but they had always told her that she was adopted. Neither of them thought it was a good idea to explain to their young child the inner workings of CPS and the foster system, although now that Nicky was older, she could probably handle a very abridged version of the truth.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha replied, “Racist too, I’m sorry baby. You shouldn’t have had to hear that.”</p><p>Nicky noticed Rio’s hands, or more accurately, the one bruised a bloodied. “Mami, did you hit someone?”</p><p>Rio ducked their head down, tucking their tongue against their cheek. “The racist cunt deserved it, in my defense.”</p><p>Their daughter snorted against Agatha’s chest. “Good.”</p><p>Agatha blew out a fractured breath, saltwater and snot caked on her face. “Is, um, is your nonna on her way?”</p><p>“Yeah, she should be here any minute.”</p><p>Rio let go, quickly opening the door. “Shit, the ice patch!”</p><p>Lilia was already shuffling up the walkway, they carefully met her at the bottom of the steps, holding out an arm for Lilia’s balance. “I swear, I was <i>just</i> about to salt it.”</p><p>Their mother in law sadly smiled, safely clearing the ice patch. “Where’s my daughter?”</p><p>“You’re eerily calm, given the circumstances.”</p><p>“I was worried, but then I saw you.” Lilia said, “She’s always safe with you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart warmed despite the night, ushering Lilia in and watching as she gently approached Agatha. “Sweetheart?” Their wife released Nicky, only to fall into Lilia’s arms, tucking her face against her mom’s shoulder.</p><p>“How about we lay down, hm?” Lilia offered, Agatha weeping in her hold. “I’ll rub your back.” She nodded her head at Nicky. “Teddy, could you grab your mom a glass of water?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Their daughter murmured, disappearing down the hall.</p><p>“C’mon,<i> tesoro mio</i>.” Lilia whispered, helping Agatha to move towards the stairs. She looked back at Rio “And salt that damn step!”</p><p>So, they did, the task taking all of about ten minutes. Rio locked the door behind them, taking off their shoes and coat. They plucked the ring off the ground, Wanda didn’t collect it before she left so maybe they could pawn it and add the money to Nicky’s college fund. They went upstairs, Nicky sitting at Agatha’s closed bedroom door.</p><p>“Nonna said to give mama a minute.” Nicky whispered, hands clasped her lap.</p><p>Rio sat down next to her, holding her hand with their non-injured one. “She’ll be okay, tonight just brought up a lot for her.”</p><p>“Why? What’d her mother do to her?”</p><p>They exhaled, trying to find the appropriate language. “Evanora was…an unfit parent to say the least. She took out her own shit on your mom, and it still hurts. Some neighbors called the cops one night, and your mom had to be hospitalized because of her injuries.” Rio bit the inside of their lip, trying to keep calm when even explaining it made them see red. “She bounced around the foster care system until she was placed with your nonna.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you guys tell me?”</p><p>“You were young, mija. Your mom probably didn’t want you to know anything different. She didn’t want you to view her as something less.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t see her differently because of something she couldn’t control.”</p><p>“Yeah well, she also hates talking about it.” Rio peeked at the door. “I’m sure Lilia’s got it under control.” And Rio secretly hoped that they could check on Agatha soon, because not being in there was killing them. “We just have to wait.”</p><p>Nicky’s head lolled back, groaning “How long?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’ve waited this long, I’ll wait as long as I have to.”</p><p>“Is Clifford gone for good?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah. No chance of that wedding happening.”</p><p>“Halleujah.”</p><p>The hinges squeaked as the door opened, Lilia walking out. “Rio, she’s asking for you.”</p><p>Rio was up like a bolt of lightning, leaving their daughter with Lilia and closing the door. The room was dark, their wife burrowed in the bed. They climbed in, instinctively molding their body to Agatha’s. Rio’s fingers threaded through her locks, her face pressed to their throat.</p><p>“Is your hand okay?” Agatha quietly asked, small and weak.</p><p>It was tender and bruised, but nothing serious.</p><p>“I’ll live.” Rio’s arms tugged her closer. “How’s your head?”</p><p>“Never had any complaints before.” Agatha quipped, lips brushing the skin of Rio’s neck.</p><p>They let out a tiny laugh. “Always so quick.” Rio rested their chin atop her head. “Seriously, though…”</p><p>“Do you ever regret saving me over Alex?”</p><p>Rio pulled back, frowning in utter confusion. Agatha looked up, blue irises contrasting irritated red through glistening lashes. They cradled the back of their wife’s neck, finger pads brushing along the nape. “<i>Never.</i>”</p><p>“Sometimes, I think you should.”</p><p>“Agatha, I have never, not for even a second, regretted anything about you.” Rio’s eyes flushed, becoming wet. “You’re the love of my life, and saving you was an easy choice. Losing Alex killed me, but losing you too? I’d never come back from that.”</p><p>“I’m…I’m really struggling.” Agatha sniffled, “I can’t do this on my own.”</p><p>“You don’t have to, you’ve got us.”</p><p>She leaned in, sharing the same breath as Rio. “Why do you always stay? I’ve hurt you over and over. You should’ve given up on me by now, you should hate me.”</p><p>“Because you’re my <i>wife</i>, and the mother of my children. Because the things you’ve said at your lowest don’t compare to you at your best.” Rio grinned, gazing into their wife’s eyes. “‘Cause you’re my heart, you’re my life. <i>I’ve never regretted anything about you, baby.</i> I don’t think it’s possible.”</p><p>“What if I’m never at my best again?” She said, voice shattering. “What if I’m like this forever?”</p><p>“I’ll love you anyway.” They answered honestly. “My love and teddy’s love, Lilia’s love, it’s unconditional. You’ll be at your best one day, and we’ll be as proud of you then as we are of you now.”</p><p>Their wife inched forward, purposely hesitating to give Rio time to pull back. They didn’t, letting Agatha press a soft kiss to the corner of their mouth. It was intimate but not necessarily romantic, a show of affection and love, yes. But not inherently seeking more, and Rio couldn’t remember the last time Agatha had done that. Touched them for nothing in return, without expectation. Perhaps when Billy died, but this wasn’t out of obligation.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha whispered, her forehead resting against their cheek.</p><p>“Always.” Rio snuggled into it, their free hand running along her spine. “When you’re up to it, Nicky’s dying to see you.”</p><p>“I don’t want her to see me like this.”</p><p>“She’d never look at you differently, baby. She just wants to comfort you, be with you.”</p><p>“Can we lay here for a few more minutes first?”</p><p>“Whatever you need.”</p><p>After letting in Nicky, and laying with her for probably far too long, they got ready for bed. Lilia agreed to sleep with Nicky since their daughter was still a bit shook up, and Rio stayed with Agatha. Despite everything from earlier, it felt refreshingly domestic, to lay in their old bed. Rio spooned their wife, worn out sleep shirt on her frame, oversized enough that Agatha hadn’t bothered with pants. Rio had just taken off their jeans to sleep in their t-shirt and boxers, curling around her with their fingers trailing along her stomach.</p><p>Agatha flipped over, twenty minutes later, and Rio knew that because they couldn’t sleep without knowing Agatha had gone to sleep. The room was pitch black and silent, but the moonlight leaking through the window projected just enough for them to make out those features they’d memorized eighteen years ago.</p><p>Agatha, tears now subsided, brushed her lips against theirs, featherlight. Rio reciprocated, holding her jaw and simply…kissing their wife. There wasn’t a discussion of what this meant, Rio already knew. A comfort, a way to soothe, and they weren’t ashamed to admit that they needed just as much as Agatha did. A means of being close, an expression of what words couldn’t. Agatha’s hips canted, a silent request for more.</p><p>Rio broke the kiss, speaking against swollen lips “Are you sure?”</p><p>“I want <i>you.</i>” Agatha mumbled before diving forward, fisting her hands in Rio’s shirt, warm fingers snaking beneath. “I just want <i>you.</i>”</p><p>They nodded, rolling them both over and hovering above as they wedged their thigh between Agatha’s. Rio’s mouth dropped to her neck, feeling their wife’s wet underwear on their leg as her hips slowly moved. There was no power struggle, or rush. There wasn’t a primal need to fuck each other into the mattress, there was only <i>intamcy</i>. In its rawest form, a tender display of love.</p><p>They reached under Agatha’s shirt, lazily palming her breast while she ground on their thigh. She let out quiet whimpers, small moans, all swallowed by Rio’s mouth on hers. Their leg was coated in arousal when Agatha ducked her hand past the waistband of their boxers, fingers lightly circling their clit.</p><p>Heavy breaths and the sounds of sheets rustling filled the background, Agatha coming with a muted cry and Rio tumbling over the edge a minute later. They kept their leg steady as Agatha continued to gently rock, eyes screwed shut as the tears returned. Rio’s thumb sat on her lower lip as they asked “Cariño, are you okay? Was it too much?”</p><p>Her eyes gingerly opened, shaking her head. “No, no. It was good.” Agatha reached out cupping their jaw, she sighed “I <i>love you.</i> Sooo much.”</p><p>“I love you.” Rio echoed, “Sooo much.”</p><p>Agatha’s underwear, essentially useless now, clung to her. They peered down, the muscle of their thigh all sticky. “Can I clean you up?”</p><p>She nodded, shucking her shirt up enough to give them access without revealing her scar. Rio moved down, hooking their thumbs into the panties and languidly pulling the garment free. They mouthed over her hip bones, the stretch marks left by the children Agatha had carried, a raspy “You’re so perfect.” falling from Rio’s lips.</p><p>“Please.” Agatha whimpered, legs shaking.</p><p>“Mi amor, <i>you’re trembling.</i>”</p><p>“It’s the good kind, I promise.”</p><p>Rio placed a lingering kiss to her inner thigh, coiling their grip on her hips. “So beautiful…” They said, nose nuzzling her bush, saturated in slick. Rio’s mouth watered, tongue flat as it made contact. Agatha clapped a hand over her mouth, muffled moan emitting soon after. They moved carefully, every ministration controlled and purposeful.</p><p>Their hips ground against the bed on their own accord, Rio not even consciously doing it. The stimulation pushing them farther as they worked their wife closer to her peak. Agatha’s hands tangled in their hair and with their fingers, respectively. Clamping down on her lip so as not to make too much noise, not wanting to alert their daughter and Lilia of what they were doing.</p><p>It wasn’t wrong, it wasn’t bad, what they were doing. But this bubble, this moment in time, was too fragile to be disturbed. Agatha writhed, coming with Rio’s tongue inside her, their nose pressed against her clit. They ground once, then twice more, muted in their ecstasy by their wife’s fluttering cunt. She immediately tugged them up, kissing them messily, licking her own taste off Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“Love you,” Agatha pushed out, arms slung around them. “I love you.”</p><p>They responded the best they could with her tongue still actively in the mouth, a broken up “I l- ove y-you.” exiting out into the air.</p><p>Rio slumped against her, head resting on Agatha’s heaving chest. She played with Rio’s hair, nails softly scraping against their scalp, lulling them to sleep. They only succumbed to it once her finger stopped dancing, relaxed knowing Agatha could rest.</p><p>They woke up the next morning in the same position, the puffs of Agatha’s exhales hitting their face. Rio stretched up kissing her cheek and pulling down the fabric of her shirt which had ridden up during the night. They caught a glimpse of the scar but felt wrong for even that, trailing their touch up her arm, rousing her.</p><p>As twin pools of aqua came into focus, a goofy, off kilter smile graced Agatha’s face. Her eyes were still slightly swollen, but she looked as ethereal as always. “Hi.” Their wife husked, voice thick with sleep.</p><p>“Hi.” Rio smiled back, placing another kiss on the opposite cheek. “How are you?”</p><p>Code for <i>do you regret last night?</i></p><p>“I’m okay.”</p><p>Code, in response, for <i>no, I don’t.</i></p><p>Rio tucked their tongue against their cheek, speaking the idea before they could chicken out. “I have a proposal for you.”</p><p>“You’re too lucid in the mornings.” She pouted.</p><hr/><p>Agatha sat in the passenger seat of her wife’s car, their daughter in the backseat. God, she didn’t even smoke and right now she was craving a cigarette. Lilia was still at the townhouse, bulk prepping meals that Agatha could easily thaw and reheat because her mom always fed her as a means of comfort.</p><p>“Want me to walk you in?” Rio offered.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, undoing her seatbelt. “It’s not kindergarten, I don’t require an escort.”</p><p>“I’m proud of you, mama. This first time is always scary.” Nicky smiled, hunching over the console.</p><p>“We’ll be right here when you’re done.” Her wife gave her knee a quick squeeze in lieu of a kiss, their daughter didn’t need an inkling of more. “We got you.”</p><p>Agatha grumbled, pushing the car door open and striding across the lot. Her hands shook as she opened the door, checking in and taking a seat. She mimicked twirling her engagement ring, her thumb basically swiping her finger repeatedly, knee bouncing.</p><p>The door swung open, Dr. Vostokoff nodding her over. “Agatha, where’s the rest of the gang? I haven’t been able to get a hold of you to reschedule you and Rio’s joint appointment.”</p><p>“Oh, we drew straws and I picked the short one.” Agatha sweetly explained, waltzing in.</p><p>“Hmm?” Melina inquired.</p><p>“Rio and Nicky gave me our family slot.” Agatha groaned, flopping down onto the couch. “I fear I am deeply fucked up beyond repair, so that’s where you come in.”</p><p>“Not how appointment booking works…”Melina shut the door, sitting across from her. “I suppose as long as the check clears.”</p><p>“Of all the things that I frequently spiral over, that is not one of them.”</p><p>“Can’t wait.” Melina threw on her glasses, grabbing her notes and a pen. “Shall we begin?”</p><p>“It’s been a fucking week, doc.”</p>

<p>“Rio looked at me…<i>different.</i>” Agatha said, fidgeting with the ring (just a random ring) that sat on her middle finger. “Afterwards.”</p><p>Four weeks into therapy and Agatha wanted to peel herself like an orange and burn the rind. She saw Melina twice a week because apparently one of her other patients ‘graduated’, to which she asked how long graduating takes. <i>“It does not work like that. Each person is different.”</i> Melina grumbled. <i>“I finished my bachelors in three years, I’m a quick study.”</i> Agatha argued, not well apparently, because she was <i>still</i> here. Two days a fucking week, in addition to family therapy on Sundays. Therapy thrice a week and Agatha had never wanted to kill herself more. Not actually, those wonderful little thoughts had lessened, but jesus fuck, therapy is not fun. Zero out of ten, would not recommend to a friend.</p><p>“Like, their voice.” She darted her tongue out, wetting her lower lip. “It wasn’t the same, it held no warmth. There wasn’t any malice, or anger, or love. It was just…<i>empty.</i>”</p><p>They had covered Agatha’s childhood, much to her dismay. They went over her young adulthood, her marriage (the happy years), and her pregnancy with Alex. And each wound Melina prodded at hurt worse than the last, but it was kind of gratifying, to get it all out. Flushing her brain and wringing out everything it had absorbed, by no means was she fixed, but at least she wasn’t using her ex wife as a human security blanket.</p><p>After the Evanora/Wanda <i>debacle</i> and fucking her ex, Agatha and Rio mutually agreed not to rush into anything. She didn’t regret the sex, it actually spurred her to agree to therapy, but Agatha couldn’t be a stable partner right now, and Rio deserved that, some stability. There was still too much to work out between them before a rekindling could occur. They saw each other often, because they had Nicky, there were a few instances of physical touch. A hug or a hand squeeze, no kissing however, and most definitely no sex. Agatha needed to prioritize herself if she was ever going to have a chance at prioritizing her undead marriage.</p><p>See that? Growth, motherfucker. Growth.</p><p>“How soon after the loss did Rio start pulling away?” The doctor asked from across from her.</p><p>“Ummm,” Agatha raised her eyebrows. “Just about as soon as I was mobile again, about two weeks. They tried to help with the recovery, I wouldn’t let them. Never fucking did.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>She shrugged, looking down at her hands. “'Cause I was pissed at them, and I think I didn’t let myself be allowed that. The care or whatever.”</p><p>“Why were you angry?”</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face. “Take a fucking guess.”</p><p>“When a couple loses a child, it is easy for them to blame one another and lash out.” Melina explained, “But from what you’ve told me, it doesn’t sound like that’s what happened. You both blame yourselves first, so if you directed your anger at Rio, it would make sense that you did so out of a way to shield yourself from vulnerability. Especially if they became detached after Alex’s death, especially since you were planning the funeral on your own, and doing most of the child rearing while recovering and grieving. If I am wrong, please correct me.”</p><p>“I- I resented them, that’s true. Rio was gone, and if my mom didn’t have Nicky, then it was me who did. I called the funeral homes and fought with the- the dumbass headstone manufacturers.” Agatha swallowed to keep herself from crying. “I was still lactating after, because my body didn’t know that my baby was <i>dead</i>. You know that you can donate your breastmilk? I didn’t. Not until I was about to explode and writhing in agony and finally pumped. Figured, if it could help someone else… keep their kid alive.”</p><p>“And Rio worked?”</p><p>“They’d come home after a twelve, fifteen hour shift. Leave again after less than a day.” She replied, the words bitter on her tongue. “They’d make Nicky dinner or tuck her in, but she’d have a meltdown if I didn’t do the voices in the story. I just got <i>desperate</i>.”</p><p>“For what?”</p><p>“My wife back? My life the way it used to be? Even though I couldn’t have either.”</p><p>Dr. Vostokoff was furiously scribbling, peering up and speaking “What did you do? To try and quell that desperation?”</p><p>“You want the really fucked up part or the kinda fucked up part?”</p><p>Melina’s eyes bugged with caution, wearily answering “Which came first?”</p><p>“The really fucked up part.”</p><p>“I’m here,” The doctor assured. “Whenever you’re ready.”</p><p>She blew out a sharp breath. “I was diagnosed perimenopausal shortly after Alex, so even if we had another embryo, the chances of me carrying a pregnancy to term were zilch. I was on a bunch of pain meds after the C-section, oxycontin for a bit. And…” Agatha tucked her hair behind her ears, sitting up a little more. “I knew what Rio thought, about me abandoning them and Nicky. I mean, what kind of mother does that? I grew a child that wouldn’t live, not well. I was selfish, to cling to something that had no hope. I knew Rio hated me for that.”</p><p>“If we look at your childhood, it makes sense. You had to protect yourself, you wanted different for Alex.” Melina said, tone slightly more gentle. “And it was not selfish, there was no correct choice in that situation.”</p><p>Agatha ignored that, clearing her throat and continuing. “I was alone, like always. It was maybe a month after she died, Alex’s funeral was planned, Nicky had Lilia and Rio, and my wife was MIA. I kept thinking how I must look to everyone. The disappoint in everyone’s eyes-”</p><p>“Could that have been sympathy that you mistook for disappointment?”</p><p>She shook her head, making eye contact. “I cut everyone off, I exiled my best friend. I pushed away Rio. I was absent for my kid who was actually alive. Depending way too much on my mom.” Agatha hastily wiped a tear that rolled down her cheek. “And the house was quiet, like, all the time. I was in bed, and I convinced myself that I had done everything I could, that they’d all be better off without me.”</p><p>Melina’s face fell, probably the first time her hardened exterior ever cracked. “What happened, Agatha?”</p><p>“Um, I was in bed and…I just wanted it all to stop. I didn’t want the pain, in my body or my mind. I didn’t want to think or feel. I wanted to be with Alex.” She sniffled. “And the family was running fine without me, and m- maybe it would be for the best if I stopped burdening them. I was the common denominator." Her voice shook, throat becoming tight like a rubber band stretched beyond its limit. “I grabbed a fistful of the pain meds, and I stared at them in my hands, wondering how many it would take. How much to <i>stop</i> it all. No body, no pain is some airtight logic. I, uh, must’ve had half the damn bottle in my palm. I w- wanted to make sure, I didn’t want them to be able to save me.”</p><p>“Agatha…” The doctor’s voice was soft, too soft.</p><p>“My mom and Nicky came home, I heard her running up the stairs and I shoved the pills under my pillow. She wanted to show me a drawing she did at school that day, it had Alex in it. She drew her family.” Agatha laughed but it held no humor. “I realized she would’ve found my body, she would’ve been the one to scream and ask why mama wasn’t waking up.”</p><p>“You never told anyone? Asked for help or received counseling?” Melina asked, somewhat horrified.</p><p>“Who would I tell? My wife? Never home. I didn’t want to be an imposition, a leech on their lives.” Agatha took a deep breath, letting it all go. “I didn’t know if Rio would see me as some manic depressive basketcase. They already regretted saving me over Alex, and what if I was beyond redemption to them? What if I was locked up and not allowed around Nicky? At the very least, that's some sort of parental negligence. I couldn’t do it once my mom left because I couldn’t leave Nicky unsupervised, couldn’t do it when Rio was home. I- I couldn’t do it…”</p><p>“Did you have the urge again? After? That’s why you do not like to be alone now?”</p><p>“Most days.”</p><p>“What kept you from attempting again?”</p><p>“My daughter.” Agatha wept. “I- I didn’t want to abandon her like how I was. I wanted better for her.”</p><p>“Did the suicidal ideation go away?”</p><p>“Nope.” Agatha replied, popping the <i>P</i> sound. “It stayed there, like a fucking noose around my neck.”</p><p>“And now?”</p><p>“Not every day… but some. I’m not going to hurt myself, I don’t <i>want</i> to die. My self preservation instincts won’t allow it, not really. Do not institutionalize me, I will <i>bite.</i>”</p><p>“I want you to know that you did nothing wrong, you’re a great parent. Nicky clearly loves you and I have no doubt you’d give her the world. She’s bright and clever, she certainly inherited that from you. You did nothing wrong, but something concerning and unsafe. I have no reason to send you anywhere because you are not exhibiting behaviors of concern since I’ve been treating you. And that leads me to my next question,” Melina set down her notes, leaning forward and handing her a box of tissues. “Did you not feel safe expressing your struggles to your family?”</p><p>“God, Rio knew. Maybe not exact details or to what degree, but they knew I was struggling. I knew they were struggling. We just didn’t fucking talk.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“What would it have helped? Alex was dead, so was our marriage.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Melina gently prodded. “What was the other part?”</p><p>“The kinda fucked up part?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Christ…”</p><hr/><p><b>May, 2020.</b></p><p>Agatha missed being touched, in any capacity really. She didn’t thrive without it. Nicky still hugged her often, and Lilia did what she could, but Rio was checked out. She was pretty sure her wife hadn’t shown some sort of physical affection since Alex’s funeral, and that had just been a hand on the small of her back. Touch out of obligation, like Rio didn’t want her anymore, as if she was too broken. Maybe she was, she couldn’t have more children, she had failed their last one. Maybe Rio could see what was obvious, that Agatha was in pieces.</p><p>Their anniversary was next month, so in an effort to keep her marriage together, Agatha showered. Which was saying something because she spent most days rotting in bed. Maria told her that she could come back to her job in the fall, if she felt up to it. She prayed she would, she couldn’t keep decaying all day. Agatha showered, put on real clothes, even did her makeup. Frivolous since it was night, but something to tempt her wife.</p><p>Sex always worked. It was a safety net for the two of them, and if the sex was still there, then so was she, so was their relationship. They hadn’t had sex since before Alex, partly because of the depression, partly because Agatha was healing. If the sex came back, so would the communication. She clicked off the bathroom light, nerves aflame as she sat on the foot of the bed, she had made it for fuck’s sake, even washed the bedding. This would work, it had to. Agatha adjusted the straps of her tank top, her stomach fighting against the waistband of her non-maternity jeans. Not eating plus ‘breastfeeding’ meant she lost the pregnancy weight fairly quickly, additionally Alex never grew to the size of a healthy baby so she hadn’t gained as much as she did with Nicky.</p><p>No, she wouldn’t think about Alex. Because if she did, she’d weep and drive Rio further away. Agatha waited, ankle shaking, fidgeting even. The door opened, her wife walking in. “Nicky went down.” She stated, no emotion in her voice as she rummaged around in the dresser for pjs, not sparing Agatha a glance. Not entirely her fault, eye contact had become a rarity, Agatha being the first one to withhold it.</p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha cleared her throat, watching Rio whip around.</p><p>Her eyes perked up a bit. “You…you look <i>nice.</i>”</p><p>Nice being a synonym for <i>Wow, you showered and your hair isn’t greasy. You look like a person again instead of the empty shell who failed to keep our daughter alive.</i></p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha tried to smile, inexplicably uncomfortable. It felt like they were performing a play but neither one of them knew their lines. “I figured it was time to get dressed again.”</p><p>“Right before bed…?” Rio tilted her head in confusion.</p><p>“It’s supposed be more enticing than a three day old t-shirt and sweat pants.”</p><p>“Oh.” She nodded, closing the dresser drawer.</p><p>Not an excited <i>Oh.</i></p><p>Rio used to come in her pants at just the prospect of fucking her.</p><p>Agatha choked back the hurt, saying “It’s been long enough…since the surgery.” instead of <i>Why don’t you want me?</i></p><p>“Are you-” Rio stumbled in her speech. “You sure? I didn’t think you’d want to.”</p><p>“I want to.” Agatha thought she did, at least.</p><p>“Have sex?”</p><p>“Yes, Rio. Have sex.” If they’d both stop being so fucking awkward about it. “I’m recovered, and what have we got left to lose?”</p><p>Only each other.</p><p>Her wife took a step forward. “And you’re <i>sure?</i>”</p><p>“As sure as I’ll ever be.” Agatha gazed up, damn near begging, and not in the fun way. “Don’t you miss me?” And that wasn’t said as a tease, but a genuine question, desperation lacing her tone. “I’m not enough or something?”</p><p>“No, of course not.” Rio crouched down, placing her hands on Agatha’s thighs. “You’re perfect, baby. Always have been.”</p><p>“Then touch me.” Agatha whispered, throat already raw. “I’m telling you to.”</p><p>“Okay.” She whispered back, stretching up and connecting their lips in a kiss, a simple one. Agatha’s hands threaded through her hair, pulling Rio closer. It was good, it felt safe. Her confidence grew as Rio’s grasp snaked over her hips, tugging her, like she really wanted her. This was good, it was okay.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse spiked as Rio’s lips dropped to her neck, maybe not lovingly but definitely affectionately. Her wife’s fingers twisted in her shirt, gently working it up and over her head. Agatha hadn’t bothered with a bra, most days she only wore a sports bra to help with the discomfort of milk production. “Don’t, um, maybe just avoid my nipples. They still kind of ache.” She quietly said, silently berating herself because that wasn’t sexy.</p><p>“Yeah, whatever you need.” Rio cautiously smiled.</p><p>Agatha always felt powerful during sex, felt desired.</p><p>Or she <i>used to.</i></p><p>Now though, as Rio laid her back on the bed and undid her jeans, Agatha felt frayed. Her heart pounding, small tremors shooting through her. Once she was fully naked and Rio was down to her tank top and boxers, her wife hovered over her. Rio’s movements were slow, as if Agatha would spook. They were careful and apprehensive, like someone putting back together a shattered China doll.</p><p>It was fine and good and okay.</p><p>That’s what she kept telling herself, even as Rio’s lips worked down her chest, over her sternum and to her stomach. Why was it so quiet? Why was it so fucking mechanical? Stiff like two people reenacting sex but not actually <i>having</i> it. Agatha’s breath caught when Rio’s eyes landed on her scar, a twist in her gut. Her wife mouthed over the soft slope of her stomach, reaching the scar, pink and a little puffy, placing a featherlight kiss to it. It was the most tender any action had felt so far, and she fucking <i>loathed</i> it.</p><p>Her body was <i>screaming</i> but her brain didn’t have the reasoning as to why, Rio wasn't doing anything wrong or without her consent. They’d done this a million times before, sex always worked, the communication would follow.</p><p>Right?</p><p>“Do you want my mouth on you?” Rio delicately questioned, eyes big and filled with pity.</p><p><i>Do you want your mouth on me?</i></p><p>Agatha quickly nodded, biting her lower lip as the tears welled. This was supposed to <i>fix</i> things but she’d never felt more fractured. An open wound, bleeding out, with nothing to aid. Rio moved down, one hand gripping each of her thighs, chaste kisses placed on her hips, on her bush.</p><p><i>Stop.</i></p><p>Only it wasn’t said aloud.</p><p>A warm mouth trailing along her inner thigh.</p><p><i>Stop.</i></p><p>But her own mouth didn’t open.</p><p><i>Stop.</i></p><p>“Mi amor, <i>you’re trembling.</i>” Rio pulled away, sitting up.</p><p>Agatha shot up, pulling her legs to her chest as the tears fell. “I- I-”</p><p>“Baby.” Her wife, crawled towards her, features etched with worry. “Agatha, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Sex was supposed to fix them.</p><p>And she was too damaged for it now.</p><p>“I <i>can’t.</i>” Agatha croaked, getting up and grabbing her robe off the hook, not breaking her stride until she was inside the bathroom and shutting the door. She turned the lock, slumping to the tile as she bawled, crossing her arms and holding the fabric around herself.</p><p>Rio knocked, trying the knob. “Cariño, let me in.”</p><p>“Please, just leave me alone.”</p><p><i>Fight for me.</i></p><p>“Agatha?” Another knock. “Baby, I just wanna know you’re okay.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p><i>Say her name.</i></p><p>“Mi amor, just…let me in.”</p><p>“And do what?!” She dug the heels of her hands into her eyes, swallowing back the snot. “Rio, get out.”</p><p>“Agatha.” A small thud came on the other side of the door, presumably from Rio’s forehead. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”</p><p><i>For leaving me, or not having the decency to actually divorce me?</i></p><p>“I know.”</p><p>One final knock. “Open the door, please baby.”</p><p>“Sleep on the couch tonight.” Agatha said, wishing she hadn’t. But the overwhelming compulsion to isolate won out, like she knew it would. Sex hadn’t fixed them, and nothing would. She couldn’t pretend, no matter how hard she tried, that things would change.</p><p><i>Fight for me, say her name, ask me why I’m so miserable now.</i></p><p>A heavy sigh, the sound of receding footsteps, the soft <i>click</i> of their bedroom door.</p><p>She slumped against the door, shaking and wondering if she’d ever not be this way. If she’d accept Rio’s words at face value, if she’d stop dissecting every sentence with surgical precision. If she’d ever feel whole again. If she’d ever cease being the most difficult person to love. If there would be a day where she’d feel happy again.</p><hr/><p>“Rio slept on the couch most nights after that, if not in an on-call room. For almost three years.” Agatha admitted. “I wanted them close, but I couldn’t…I couldn’t deal.”</p><p>Melina nodded, pursing her lips. “So sex was a failsafe, and when that no longer worked, it only made things worse.” She looked more human, empathetic and kind in her delivery. “Agatha, have you ever heard of CPTSD?”</p><p>“I’ve heard of PTSD.”</p><p>“CPTSD is complex post-traumatic stress disorder. It stems from repetitive trauma inflicted over long periods of time. Your childhood, the foster system, Alex. Your brain has been in fight or flight mode for so long, it’s distorted the way your brain thinks. It can lead to a sense of inadequacy or worthlessness. Depression, suicidal thoughts or actions, self-harm.” She smiled in a way that Agatha was sure was meant to be comforting. “It’s treatable and manageable. And it doesn’t mean anything is wrong with you, it just means you need a little help.”</p><p>“You think I have that?”</p><p>“I would recommend a low dosage anti-depressant, regular therapy. CPTSD affects emotional regulation, and while we work on the root cause of everything you’ve shared, we can treat it with our sessions and medication in the meantime.”</p><p>“I don’t want to be dependent on a drug forever.”</p><p>“It does not have to be forever, but with the way you’re going,” Melina delicately told, “I think it is a good start. You are very brave for hanging on this long, I am personally amazed by your resilience. I’m also very proud you are asking for and accepting help now, that takes guts. But this is not sustainable, not longterm. Your daughter wants her mom happy, and I’m sure Alex would too.”</p><p>Agatha dried her eyes. “What if I don’t think I deserve that?”</p><p>“What makes you say that?”</p><p>Agatha hiccupped out “Because <i>the grief is all I have left of her</i>, and if that’s gone, then she is too. If I forget her, what does that say about me?”</p><p>“You do not have to be in pain in order to have loved your child, you do not have to punish yourself to remember or honor your daughter.” The doctor reached out, giving her hand a quick squeeze. “Alex would want you to live your life, she would rest easy knowing that.”</p><p>“How do you believe that? You can’t know that.”</p><p>“If Alex is anything like her sister, she wants you at your best again. We can wait on more sessions with Rio, you can decide what you share with them and when, but do you think it’d help to tell them any of what you told me?”</p><p>“I want my life back.” Agatha weakly spoke, “I want my wife back. I want my prize at the end of all this.”</p><p>“So,” Melina tilted her head. “Let’s work on it then.”</p><p>Agatha left therapy that day with a prescription for Zoloft and feeling fractionally lighter. She immediately went to the pharmacy, knowing she’d pussy out otherwise. She stood in line, noticing a flower shop across the street. It was early spring and the sun was out as she shoved the meds into her bag and jogged across the way.</p><p>She bought the damn bouquet, leaving them at their destination before going home. She pulled out the bottle, placing it on the counter. Agatha grabbed a bottle of water, staring at that fucking yellowy orangish bottle. Fuck it, what has she got to lose? Rio, again. Well, she was out of options and it was either this or gnawing off her own skin. Agatha twisted the cap, popping a pill onto her tongue and chugging the water before she could stop herself.</p><p>Great.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>Okay, then.</p><p>It’s not like she could get worse.</p><hr/><p>The elevator doors parted, Rio carrying the last package to have arrived from Agatha’s tape frenzy. Packages three and five were top contenders thus far, so here’s to number six. They shuffled down the hall, scrolling on their phone and barely paying attention as they approached their front door without a second thought.</p><p>Rio fished out their keys, scrubs stale from work, something beneath their aching feet. Fuck, every inch of them was sore, the hours starting to wear on Rio. They looked down, a bouquet of <i>azaleas</i> under their non-slip sneakers. Rio stepped back, dropping the package and rifling through the flowers to get to the note. They plucked it out, reading the handwritten words in loopy chicken scratch they’d recognize anywhere.</p><p><i>Because sometimes, we have too much to say to someone.</i><br/>
<i>–A</i></p><p>They grinned, cheesy and wide, like a dumb fucking idiot. Rio unlocked the door, rushing into the kitchen and grabbing a vase, safely stowing the flowers inside with some water. “You like me sooo much.” Rio chuckled to themself, the door opening, a minute later, Nicky walked through.</p><p>“Who likes you?” Their daughter chirped, backpack slung over her shoulder.</p><p>“Lots of people, I’m very charming. I thought I was picking you up from school.” Rio checked their watch. “I was just about to change.”</p><p>“Kamala’s mom gave me a ride so I didn’t have to wait on the curb for twenty minutes.” Nicky said, walking over to the island. “Who are the flowers from?”</p><p>Rio quickly stuffed the note in their pocket, god damnit. "Patient's family as a thank you.” They lied. “What sounds good for dinner?”</p><p>Nicky cocked her head. “A patient’s family sent you azaleas?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“But you said ‘you like me sooo much’?”</p><p>“Yeah, and they do. For saving their child's life.” Rio shrugged. “Comes with the field.”</p><p>“Isn’t that a little weird.”</p><p>“No, it’s happened before.”</p><p>“When?”</p><p>“You probably just don’t remember, mija.” Ro waved her off, moving over to the fridge. “Stirfry?”</p><p>Nicky scrunched her face, walking away. “Freak.”</p><p>“Don’t be transphobic, teddy!”</p><p>She looked back as she climbed the stairs. “Stop pulling that card!”</p><p>“Stop being transphobic!”</p><p>“Oh my god!” Nicky snorted as she reached her room, disappearing. Rio dug their hand into their pocket, pulling out the note and rereading it. Their thumb brushed along the ink, that stupid grin returning. “Sooo much.” They whispered, running to their room and hiding the small piece of paper in their night stand next to the picture they kept from Nicky’s seventh birthday. One of the few photos they got with the whole family.</p><p>And maybe, they’d be whole again.</p><p>Or as whole as possible.</p><p>Which was more than enough to them.</p><p>Hell, it was <i>everything.</i></p>

<p>Just as the flowers began to wilt, Rio got a knock on their door. It was around 5PM as Rio closed their book, sweatpants swishing with every step. It had been a little less than a week since the azaleas left on their doorstep, neither of them having spoken about it. Rio wanted to pry, but knew Agatha would show up when she was <i>ready</i>. They couldn’t push, they had to bide their time and hope, hope that with or without them, she would reach a break in the tide. They turned the latch, aqua eyes and wild hair on the other side. Agatha smiled, hands tucked behind her back with jeans and a simple button up on her frame. “Hi.”</p><p>Fuck okay, guess she’s ready.</p><p>“Hi.” They said, confused. “What’s this?”</p><p>“Nicky’s at piano and ma said she’d pick her up and feed her.” Their wife explained, “I thought we could spend a little time together. If you’re free, if not, then whatever.”</p><p>“Doing what?” Rio grinned, leaning against the door frame and teasing “Is this a date?”</p><p>“Mmmh,” She considered, a playful glint in her eye. “More than sex, less than a date.”</p><p>“So what are you asking me, Agatha?”</p><p>She pulled her hands from her back, offering a pizza box with another smaller box atop. “Hungry?”</p><p>“Are those LEGOs?” Rio asked in awe, snatching the box on top. “Succulents?”</p><p>“We could build it together…” Agatha nonchalantly shrugged, acting as though she didn’t care. “We could watch a nature doc…eat, maybe.”</p><p>Rio peered down at the box, then up at her, their pulse spiking and blush forming despite the simplicity of the offer. “Can we watch <i>Life in Color with David Attenborough</i>?”</p><p>“Yes, because I know you love that tiny grandpa’s posh accent.”</p><p>The pizza, the LEGOs, the doc, everything tailored to Rio and their interests. They couldn’t put their finger on it, but even the very mundane gesture felt gargantuan coming from Agatha, because well, she didn’t have to do it. They weren’t together, they weren’t <i>not</i> together. It was the biggest step she had taken thus far, that Rio was aware of, at least.</p><p>“It’s soothing. His audiobooks helped me sleep when my insomnia was at its height.” When Rio started sleeping on the couch, or in on-call rooms, or when they first moved into the loft. His voice was fucking comforting, what could Rio say. “He makes me feel less guilty about not being vegan.”</p><p>“Can I come in, then? Or will I be relegated to the hall all night?” She quirked her brow. “I won’t even tease you when you recite the show from memory.”</p><p>“Has this been Melina approved?” Because Rio didn’t want to do anything to set Agatha back, she was obviously more than capable of standing on her own two feet, but they didn’t want to be an obstacle in her way, tripping her up and sending her tumbling down.</p><p>“I don’t have to run everything past my psychiatrist.” She scoffed, tiny pout on ridiculously full lips. “She’s not my keeper.”</p><p>They blinked, awaiting an answer.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, huffing out “Yes. The scary lady with the pills told me I’m allowed.”</p><p>“Pills?”</p><p>She brushed past them, striding into the kitchen. “The first week on an SSRI is not for the weak, the fatigue <i>alone-</i>”</p><p>Okay, scratch that from earlier. Agatha willingly taking meds had to be the biggest step taken so far, and they were so damn proud, and kind of stunned.</p><p>Rio shut the door, following after her. “You’re on anti-depressants?!”</p><p>Agatha reached into the cabinet for plates, cocking her head at them. “<i>Yeah.</i> Ya know, to <i>anti</i> my depression…and such.” She returned to the island, stacking the plates and a few napkins on the pizza box. “Just don’t be shocked if I get nauseous after one slice.” She kicked her loafers as if she lived here. “Living room?”</p><p>“Um…yeah, yeah.” Rio murmured as Agatha already took off, setting the food on the coffee table and making herself comfortable on the couch. They froze for a second, dumbfounded at their wife, demeanor the closest it had ever been to the pre-Alex times. “Do you want anything to drink?”</p><p>“Water is fine.” She called back, remote already in her hand to que up the series. Damn, she really memorized this place from the last time.</p><p>Had they known Agatha was coming over, they might’ve changed out of the tank top and pajama pants they were currently sporting, but if they changed now, that’d make things awkward. Right? Because it wasn’t <i>technically</i> a date, but it was more than sex…</p><p>What the fuck was this?</p><p>It didn’t matter, not really, as they reached the second fifty minute long episode, happily building the LEGO set after finishing their dinner. Agatha sat next to them, cursing under her breath as she’d push a piece too hard and cause the petal to snap, but notably, she didn’t say a thing. Not as she broke off a branch or as Rio mumbled along to the narration. She wasn’t rigid, but relaxed, content to just spend time in the same vicinity as them.</p><p>Rio had slumped onto the floor at some point, enthralled in building plant after plant as Agatha stayed behind them on the sofa. Their gaze periodically shifted up to the screen that displayed a female Bengal tiger, slowly stalking through high grass while on the hunt. They smirked, fitting a piece of leaf together. “She reminds me of you.”</p><p>The British accent of the narrator speaking <i>“To have any chance of catching a meal, she has to get to within a few meters of her prey.</i>”</p><p>“I’m a very large cat to you?”</p><p>“The world’s biggest actually,” Rio explained, looking back at her. “The way she moves and plans her attack is kinda what you did with me.”</p><p>“So you’re the deer about to get its neck snapped between my fangs?” She grinned, pursing her lips. “Ah, memories…”</p><p>Rio chuckled, fiddling with a random piece of sage green plastic. “Do you remember our first date?”</p><p>“Of course I do.” Agatha snorted, setting her plant aside and theatrically flipping her hair over her shoulder. “We got Theo’s, because it was all you could afford. Only it was a Friday night so the restaurant was too packed to sit in, and we ended up eating the burgers on the hood of your shitty little car.”</p><p>Rio fondly recalled the next moment. “And you got chilly so I gave you my jacket.”</p><p>“A true gentleman.” Agatha said, slightly wistfully. “Your hand didn’t even wander up my skirt after.” She sat forward, confident in her words. “And we laid on the windshield, and I pointed out Orion and Artemis in the sky.”</p><p>“Always loved your Greek mythology.”</p><p>“And you asked me what it meant.”</p><p>Rio smiled again, only this one held an ache, a longing to return. “You said it meant that we were written in the stars.”</p><p>“Cheesiest fucking pick-up line ever.” She snorted, fidgeting with a band on her middle finger. “But it worked…I’m also pretty sure we ended up fucking in the back seat of said shitty little car after that.” Agatha shrugged, raising her brows. “I was kind of easy back then.”</p><p>She still kind of was, but Rio didn’t say that aloud because even if they meant it as a compliment, it probably wouldn’t be taken as such. “A hunter loved by the goddess of the hunt.”</p><p>“Yeah well, in the myth she shoots his ass with an arrow after Apollo tricks her, so…” Her hand softly squeezed their shoulder. “I’d say we ended up on top.”</p><p>“Never pick up archery as a hobby.” Rio joked, turning back to the coffee table littered with fractional pieces of LEGO.</p><p>Agatha’s flingers ghosted over their skin, landing off center of their spine. “Is this new?”</p><p>They ignored how the touch caused rippling goosebumps to bloom, because they were aware of the tattoo she was referring to. Rio had azaleas on their bicep for Agatha, asters splayed over their shoulder for Nicky, the sleeve then coiling around their shoulder blade with some filler ink, before ending just shy of their spine. “No, I got it, uh, three-ish years ago.”</p><p>The pads of her fingers delicately traced the petals, leaving phantom warmth in their wake. “Guess-” She cleared her throat as if to shake out the emotion, but it still came out thick. “Guess I never noticed. Are they-”</p><p>“Violets.” Rio finished, vocal cords going taut.</p><p><i>Violets.</i></p><p>Alex’s birth flower.</p><p>To be fair, Agatha didn’t see their back often, and for most of the time they’d had the tattoo, they hid it on purpose. She was the only member of the family not to have a place on Rio’s body, and even if they hated themself most days for what happened to Alex, she still deserved to have her memory on them. They had gotten it shortly after the divorce was finalized, choosing to do it under the radar.</p><p>Her palm went flat against Rio’s back as she spoke. “You’ve had this all along and never told me?”</p><p>“Would it have changed anything?” They questioned, knowing that the outcome would’ve been the same.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, the breath fanning across Rio’s back. “You- You didn’t always have to be the strong one.” Her voice was uncharacteristically unguarded, fragile without being inflammatory. “I would’ve happily let you crumble with me.”</p><p>Rio bit their bottom lip, words quiet but so fucking heavy. “And who would’ve kept the mortgage paid? Or Nicky fed?”</p><p>“Are you blaming me?” Agatha genuinely asked, scared of the answer.</p><p>They whipped around, knitting their eyebrows together. “Never. I just- I had to provide. I wanted you to grieve, and I didn’t want to. So work was easy. It was <i>easier</i>.”</p><p>“I always thought you resented me, hated me for losing her.”</p><p>“I have <i>never</i> hated you. Not even on our worst days.”</p><p>Agatha briefly closed her eyes, choosing her next words carefully. “You should’ve.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“‘Cause I was okay dying that day, I was fine knowing you’d raise Nicky alone. I sacrificed myself <i>happily.</i> You should hate me for that.”</p><p>“I did, and I’m trying not to.” Rio shook their head. “Resent you, that is. But, I can’t fault you. If I could’ve switched places with Alex, I would have, in a heartbeat.”</p><p>And Agatha nodded, fingers still splayed along the tattoo. “Your back feels like a bag of ropes.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Your back muscles,” She idly pressed, the tension of her fingers digging into the knot. “They’re tight.”</p><p>Their eyes rolled back, leaning into the touch without a second thought. “Fuck.” It came out as a moan, “Do that again.”</p><p>Agatha’s other hand joined, adding pressure. “You’re getting too old for fifteen hour shifts on your feet.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio breathed out, hands flying to grip onto the coffee table as Agatha’s hands fucking massaged the soreness out of their muscles. “Oh god-”</p><p>“Don’t come, baby.” She laughed, thumbs hooking into their shoulder blades and rubbing. And in full transparency, Agatha was right, the days beginning to wane on Rio. They still loved their career, but they were getting tired of being tired. “That probably wouldn’t be Melina approved.”</p><p>“No sex?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth was suddenly against their ear, soft lips nearly teasing Rio's lobe. “What, you thought you had a chance tonight?”</p><p>No.</p><p>But it was nice to tease without the unspoken subtext of the sex being a one time mistake to blow off steam.</p><p>Rio’s body went slack as their wife carried on, the touch being missed and welcome. When they were married, Agatha used to regularly massage Rio’s numerous aching and fatigued muscles. “Ay dios mío, mi amor.” Their head dropped forward as digits worked up the column of their neck, the near constant constriction finally easing.</p><p>Agatha’s contact remained there, a low whisper following. “How do you know I’m not about to snap your neck?”</p><p>“Shit.” Arousal shot through their stomach, the faint assertion of dominance leaving them lightheaded. “Even if you did, I bet it’d feel amazing. Please do.”</p><p>“Mmm,” She hummed, the third episode autoplaying as she pulled away. Agatha got off the couch, peering down at them. Rio didn’t think too hard about their wife towering over them, because if they did, they’d explode. “I should go, it’s almost eight and ma is going to wonder why my ‘department meeting’ ran so late.”</p><p>“Right.” Rio got up, shadowing Agatha as she slipped her shoes back on and walked over to the door. “Thanks for, um, hanging out.”</p><p>“Thanks for letting me…” She smiled, keys dangling from her index finger. “It was nice to exist with you for a bit.”</p><p>“Maybe next time you can let me take you out? For real? Somewhere in public?” Fuck, they hoped they didn’t sound desperate.</p><p>“Um…”</p><p>“If that’s too much though-”</p><p>“It’s not that.” Agatha shook her head. “I think we should do another session together, and then, if you still want a real date after it, you’ll let <i>me</i> take <i>you</i> out.”</p><p>“You’re ready to do joint therapy again?”</p><p>“If you are-”</p><p>“I am. I definitely am.” Rio jumped, eagerly complying. “I want to do the work.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha softly murmured, a small grin on her lips. “We’ll coordinate a day?”</p><p>“Whenever, I’ll move things around if I need to, just let me know.”</p><p>“Super duper.” She muttered, turning for the door. “Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p>Rio held the door open, watching her leave. “Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p>Rio, rooted to the floor, weighed their options. It had been almost six weeks since anything overtly affectionate happened, but what about now? It didn’t feel right to say farewell the way they had, and Rio would always go back for more. The elevator dinged at the end of the hall, the sound echoing in their skull. And they should’ve closed the door, but the roots severed, carrying their feet down the hall after her.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio called, their wife whipping around as she got in the elevator. They shot out their hand to stop the double doors from closing, grabbing her hips and pulling her into their orbit. Agatha’s fingers cradled their jaw on instinct as they leaned forward, lips crashing into hers.</p><p>It wasn’t passionate or fuel to a flame, it was just a proper goodbye. The kiss, fleeting and innocent. Rio fought against angling their head, to deepen it, to let their hold wander. Using every bit of restraint they could muster not to take more. As soon as it had started, they broke it off.</p><p>“Night.” They husked, stumbling back and out of the elevator.</p><p>Agatha’s fingertips grazed her bottom lip, an unsteady “Night.” said as the elevator doors finally shut, the engine whirling.</p><hr/><p>Her lips burned the entire drive to Lilia’s, the kiss searing into Agatha. She hadn’t really expected that, not that it was unwelcome, but it left her spinning. Not spiralling, <i>spinning.</i> Because that was a pretty lackluster date, right? Not a love confession or a grand gesture, just a small thing she decided to do on a whim because she missed her wife. She did, she missed the simple moments of loafing on the coach and talking about nothing. Agatha missed that, and it was so inconsequential, but Rio kissed her anyway.  That a quiet night together meant something to them, to just have Agatha share their presence.</p><p>Maybe Agatha wasn’t so bad after all, perhaps she should give herself more credit. She pulled into her mom’s driveway, letting herself in and immediately being hit with the scent of whatever delicious meal Lilia had made that night. Nicky looked up from her textbook, sitting on the couch next to her grandma, notebook balanced on her knee. Her daughter got up, smiling as she greeted Agatha with a hug, which weren’t so rare anymore.</p><p>“How was the night?” Agatha asked, arms coiled around Nicky.</p><p>“Good.” She pulled back, finger wedged in the textbook to keep her place. “Nonna made shepherd’s pie and we watched <i>The Bachelor</i>, which I could’ve done without because the dude kind of looks like a rat, but good.”</p><p>Agatha softly chuckled, pushing some hair out of Nicky’s face. “You wanna grab your stuff and we can go back to our man-free home?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Nicky agreed, grabbing her notebook and disappearing into the kitchen to grab her backpack.</p><p>Lilia rose off the couch, a coy smile stretched across her face. “How was the meeting?”</p><p>“Boring.” Was all Agatha said in response.</p><p>“And how’s Rio?”</p><p>“Fine, we had some pizza-” She buffered, cocking her head. “What?”</p><p>Lilia made sure Nicky couldn’t hear when she answered “You’re not as subtle as you think you are, sweetheart.”</p><p>“How the fuck did you know?”</p><p>“After the night you called me in tears, I had a suspicion. It was confirmed when you two shared a bed after the Eavanora…<i>incedint.</i>” Lilia’s eyes were kind, almost hopeful. “And you seem to be doing better, some life flowing through you again.”</p><p>“That’s the Zoloft-”</p><p>“No, it’s part of it. But you get a certain look around Rio.” Lilia motioned to her. “You have it right now.”</p><p>Agatha wiggled her shoulders, raising her chin. “Do not.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, teddy doesn’t know.” Lilia came close, holding Agatha’s face in her hands. “It’s okay to have a crush on your wife.”</p><p>“They’re not my-” She scoffed, briefly closing her eyes. “Rio and I aren’t back together.”</p><p>“No, of course not.” Lilia smushed her cheeks a bit, arrogantly adding “But they don’t want anyone else, and neither do you.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha grabbed her mom’s hands and removed them from her face. “Woman, you’ve been watching way too much reality dating and have gone cuckoo for cocopuffs.”</p><p>“I’ll leave it alone, for now, but I’m really <i>proud</i> of you.” Her mom gave her shoulder a gentle squeeze. “Rio or no Rio, you’re one tough broad.”</p><p>“Had a good role model of one growing up.” Agatha sincerely grumbled, catching Nicky coming back out of the corner of her eye. “Ready, hon?”</p><p>“Yep,” Nicky said, giving Lilia a quick hug. “Thanks for dinner, nonna.”</p><p>“Anytime, kid.”</p><p>Agatha ushered Nicky out the door, calling back a quick “Thanks, ma!”</p><p>Lilia echoed the exact same sentiment. “Anytime, kid!”</p><p>The drive home was quiet, her daughter’s nose shoved in the textbook because Nicky was hellbent on skipping freshman bio next year and placing straight into advanced. All of that, the understanding of science, that came from Rio. The determination through sheer force of will, though, that was all Agatha. Even if Nicky had never said anything explicitly, it would not surprise Agatha if she followed her mami’s footsteps and did something in the medical field.</p><p>“I wanted to run something by you,” Agatha chirped as they got home, killing the engine. “Since I think you’d have an opinion.”</p><p>Nicky peered up, shoving her pen in the book’s spine as a bookmark. “Okay…”</p><p>“You’ve always wanted a pet, and I think we’re reaching that point.” She explained, omitting that Melina had suggested Agatha get an emotional support animal. To which Agatha claimed that she wasn’t a lunatic who needed a python to keep her company, but then Melina explained the benefits, and she couldn’t deny that it would be nice to have another living thing in the house when Nicky was at Rio’s for the week.</p><p>“Really?!” Her daughter gasped, vibrating her seat. “Like, anything?”</p><p>“Some caveats: no birds, snakes, or bugs.”</p><p>“Can we get a cat?”</p><p>She shrugged, “I don’t see why not.”</p><p>Nicky opened the passenger’s side door, jogging inside the house. “I’m going to go pull up PetFinder!”</p><p>She laughed, locking her car and following Nicky inside. With her daughter already distracted, Agatha got ready for bed, spending the last few hours of her night grading. Her glasses were perched on her nose when her phone buzzed, flipping over the screen to read the text.</p><p><b>R💚, 9:55PM:</b> <i>[image]</i> On the bright side, plants you could definitely keep alive…</p><p>Agatha's heart picked up, blushing at the text and the photo of the succulents that now appeared to have been given residency on the mantle in Rio’s living room. Her thumbs hovered over the keyboard as she tried to think of a response. Flirty, but not sexual. Light, but not hollow. Something witty, but not dismissive. Her stomach fluttered like it had when she and Rio first began dating, the anticipation of wanting to seem as chill as possible while being anything but.</p><p>“Mom!” Nicky burst in, frantically climbing on her bed, laptop in hand.</p><p>Agatha locked and discarded her phone like it had porn on it, throwing it on the nightstand. “What’s up?”</p><p>“Look!” Her daughter shoved the screen in Agatha’s face.</p><p>She laid her hands atop her daughter’s, moving the screen back a bit and pushing up her glasses to squint at the animal. “A bunny?”</p><p>“Look at hiiiiiiiiiim.” Nicky pouted, reading his bio, “Scratchy is a rescue from an irresponsible breeder, found after mistreatment along with his brother and sisters. This Lop Rabbit may be a little feisty, but at heart he’s a sweetie. Scratchy is blind due to bad breeding practices and the smallest of his litter.” She looked to be near tears. “Nobody wants him because he’s blind! His siblings were already adopted!”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha grinned, “Baby, I understand that’s sad, but taking care of a bunny is different from a cat.”</p><p>“Please, mama?” She put on the puppydog eyes, clasping her hands together. “Please, please, please…”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shifted from the screen to her daughter, and back again. The fucker was cute, white and brown, fluffy with droopy ears. “You want the blind bunny?”</p><p>“Who cares if he’s blind?! Don’t be an ableist! He’s had a hard life and needs loooooove!” Nicky dramatically flapped her arms around, standing her ground.</p><p>She sighed, feeling a kinship with that particular reasoning. “Fine, we can message the foster parents tomorrow. I need to research rabbits now.”</p><p>Nicky smiled wide, launching herself at Agatha, arms swallowing her. “Thank you, mama! Thank you!”</p><p>“You’re welcome, hon. Now go to bed,” Agatha placed a kiss on her temple before releasing her, closing Nicky’s laptop and handing it to her. “It’s getting late.”</p><p>“I love you!” Her daughter excitedly squealed, rushing out of her bedroom. Agatha inhaled a deep breath, snatching her phone off the side table and typing back a response to her wife.</p><p><b>Me, 10:03PM:</b> You know anything about bunnies?</p><p><b>R💚, 10:04PM:</b> What breed?</p><p>She snorted to herself, because of course Rio knew <i>so</i> much that they required specifics.</p><p><b>Me, 10:04PM:</b> A Lop??</p><p><b>R💚, 10:05PM:</b> Holland, mini, American fuzzy, or velveteen?</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, responding, <b>Me, 10:06PM:</b> White and brown.</p><p><b>R💚, 10:06PM:</b> Either way it’ll need an enclosure.</p><p><b>R💚, 10:06PM:</b> Are you getting a bunny???</p><p>She rolled out of bed, shuffling down the hall. Realistically, she couldn’t keep an animal in the living room or kitchen, and though he might fit in her bedroom, an enclosure wouldn’t. Agatha gently pushed open the door to Alex’s room, having been left open continuously for the past five weeks. She had dusted it and went in occasionally, sometimes catching glimpses of Nicky reading or sketching in the rocking chair. It was four walls, there wasn’t anything sinister in that, she had come to accept that much.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, fingers clacking on her phone as she entered the nursery.</p><p><b>Me, 10:08PM:</b> Would it be weird to put the enclosure in Alex’s room?</p><p><b>R💚, 10:08PM:</b> I don’t think so, it’s fine with me.</p><p><b>R💚, 10:09PM:</b> Not that you needed my permission</p><p><b>Me, 10:10PM:</b> No, but it's nice to have it:)</p><p>God, fuck. Was the smiley face too much? Like a prepubescent tween? Why the fuck did she add the dumb fucking smiley face-</p><p><b>R💚, 10:11PM:</b> Do I get to meet the bunny?:)</p><p><b>Me, 10:11PM:</b>  His name is Scratchy, and yes</p><p><b>R💚, 10:12PM:</b> He? A little Señor</p><p><b>Me, 10:13PM:</b> Señor Scratchy has a good ring to it, alliteration and all…</p><p>Alliteration? Really? That’s not romantic, or witty, or flirty.</p><p><b>R💚, 10:14PM:</b> How did teddy con you into that one?</p><p>Agatha giggled, opting to call instead of type, the line ringing once before Rio answered. “Okay, she didn’t con me-”</p><p>“The eyes?” Rio supplied, smug in their tone.</p><p>“You Vidals and your goddamn motherfucking eyes!” She idly walked back to her room, closing the door behind her. “Is that just genetically engrained in you two?”</p><p>“No, I obviously trained her from a very early age behind your back.”</p><p>“Mmhh, should’ve known.”</p><p>“What are you doing, other than getting swindled into adopting a bunny?”</p><p>“Grading,” Agatha said, though she turned off her laptop as she laid down in bed. “You?”</p><p>There was the rustling of sheets, the faint background noise of the TV. “Netflix autoplayed another doc, I’m enthralled.”</p><p>And as she laid in bed, staring at the ceiling and talking to her ex about nothing important, her mom’s words rang in her ears. <i>“It’s okay to have a crush on your wife.”</i> So she did, she had a crush on her wife, and fell asleep that night smiling and warm to Rio’s voice explaining the mating cycle of a very rare Amazonian bird.</p><p>Agatha fell asleep that night soundly, with no bad dreams to wake her, with no fear to send her shivering out of bed.</p><p>Agatha fell asleep, and stayed that way until her alarm the next morning.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In the past two weeks, Rio had made a lot of progress with their wife. The non-dates had become more frequent, they texted all day everyday, and bedtime calls happened whenever Rio wasn’t working the night shift. It was a strange sort of limbo, to be not dating or together, but not divorced or apart. And they wanted more, they fucking craved it, but if Rio had anything, it was patience. There was no sex had, and Rio didn’t initiate it, that would be Agatha’s call if and when it ever transpired.</p><p>Please let that be right now.</p><p>Agatha was in their lap, straddling them in the driver's seat of their Subaru currently parked outside the townhouse. Her hands were <i>everywhere.</i> Their hair, their abs, their face, any square inch of skin up for grabs. She kissed Rio with the ferocity of a wild animal, consuming them as they happily let her. They reached around, grabbing at her ass through those fucking jeans that hugged their wife’s frame all too well. Genuinely, Rio was pretty sure they let out a moan as their fingers coiled around the denim and squeezed her flesh.</p><p>They had spent the night at one of their favorite parking garages (yes, they had a few), the one connected to Mass Gen, where the light pollution wasn’t as bad and the stars were easier to see. They had helped Agatha hop on the hood and lay back against the windshield, hands intertwined as they stargazed together.</p><p>A familiar hand wrapped around Rio's throat, not pressing, but holding as the seat reclined. Agatha smirked as she let the lever go, flipping her hair as she draped herself over them. Rio eagerly craned their head up, crashing their lips back together and keening at Agatha’s dominance. They had missed that, the power she derived from taking control, the confidence she displayed. Her tongue met theirs again, fingers placing an ever so slight pressure to the sides of Rio’s neck.</p><p>“Mi alma, you’re killing me-” Rio gasped as her lips dropped to their jaw, teeth barely scraping before nibbling on their ear lobe.</p><p>Agatha looked down, pupils eating away any of the aqua. “Good.”</p><p>Rio opened their mouth to respond, but was swiftly shut up with her tongue down their throat. Well, who could be upset about that? The frantic pawing and uncoordinated makeup session came to an end once they realized the time, how their daughter might get suspicious as to why Agatha’s ‘dinner with Lilia’ had gone so late. Had Rio’s hands slipped under Agatha’s shirt in that span of time? Not important.</p><p>“I should go relieve Kate,” Agatha sighed, flopping over the center console and grabbing her bag. “I don’t want her to get frustrated.”</p><p>“Nicky likes Kate, why would she give her any trouble?”</p><p>Agatha grinned, fixing her hair which had gotten mussed in their…<i>passion.</i> “Not Nicky, Scratchy.”</p><p>That rabbit might be their wife’s new favorite living being; within a week's time, Agatha had become endearingly attached to the little guy. “Do I get to meet him soon?” Rio asked, shifting the driver’s seat back upright. “I doubt the pictures you’ve sent do him justice.”</p><p>“How about after therapy tomorrow? You could stay for dinner, Nicky would love it.” She offered, reaching for the door.</p><p>“Deal,” Rio smiled, leaning over and giving her one last kiss. “Goodnight.”</p><p>Agatha smiled back, sappy as she gave them a few more pecks. “‘Night, baby.”</p><p>They watched as their wife strutted the walkway, unlocking the front door and giving them a nod, disappearing behind the door. The porch light turned off a moment later, Rio starting the car and pulling off with the knowledge that Agatha had gotten home safely. The longer they hung around, the greater the chance that their daughter would catch on. Rio and Agatha had agreed that they would keep things under wraps until they were on steadier ground, and that wouldn’t happen until they went back to joint therapy.</p><p>The next morning, Rio weaved through the halls of the PEDs wing, checking on a few patients and finishing up some paperwork before they drove to the practice for therapy. They had just finished up, walking out the main atrium and running into Jen on her way in. Rio smiled, noting Jen’s unusually giddy demeanor, as if she were walking on air.</p><p>“Why are you so happy?” Rio tilted their head, stopping just shy of the main doors.</p><p>Jen beamed, chin held high. “I could ask you the same question, your face is all red and blushy.”</p><p>“I’m on my way to therapy with Agatha.”</p><p>She noticeably tensed at the mention of Agatha, furrowing her brows. “Odd thing to be stoked about…but okay.”</p><p>“And what about you,” Rio asked, checking their watch to make sure they were good on time. “What’s your glow all about? Did Alice admit you were right about something again?”</p><p>“No,” Jen clasped her hands together in announcement. “As of today, I secured the business loan that I needed for the practice. Meaning, I’m almost out of here as soon as my patients either give birth or take a referral.”</p><p>They brightened further at the news, knowing how long Jen had worked for her own practice. She’d always casually talked in med school, then more in residency, then committing to it being a far off dream in the future once they were attendings. Jen had started the process a year ago, scouting locations, meeting with banks about loans. The goal was to run a practice that catered towards pregnancy and pediatrics, with a clinic that offered discounted flu shots, or birth control prescriptions, STI testing, general odds and ends that usually weren’t provided to lower income households.</p><p>“Jen!” Rio gawked, pulling her into a quick hug. “That’s amazing, I’m so happy for you.”</p><p>Jen squeezed them back before letting Rio go. “Thanks,” She grinned, then adding “Does this mean I can persuade you to come with me?”</p><p>Yeah, Jen had asked months ago, and while Rio liked the idea, they had just been too busy with the love of their life getting engaged and disastrous family therapy. Rio had told her they’d think about it, apparently Alice and Jen wouldn’t be able to handle as many patients since they’d also be running a business. So, Jen went about trying to poach as many doctors as she could, which Rio respected.</p><p>“I don’t know, Jen.” They pinched their lips together. “I’m finally getting back to a good place with Agatha, and Nicky likes the consistency of having both of us around at the same time-”</p><p>“You work at a practice and you have a set 9 to 5,” Jen interrupted, direct in her delivery. “No more overnights, no more fifteen hour shifts, no more scrubs covered in bodily fluids. Sure, you’d have to give up surgery, but you can't get more consistent than that.”</p><p>It sounded like a dream, to help people without fucking up their body or sleep schedule. Oh, they could have an office, a cushy one, with a comfortable chair and a manageable patient load. Jesus, they could moan at the possibilities. Truthfully, it was a smart move, but they couldn’t commit to another life change amidst all the other changes.</p><p>“I’ll take it over with Agatha,” Rio offered, giving a small shrug. “See what she thinks.” Because if they were trying to rebuild a marriage, a big life step should be discussed as partners, that was the end goal of this. Agatha happy and healthy, and hopefully, back with Rio, back together as a family.</p><p>Jen’s smile faded, a quiet “How is she doing?” following.</p><p>Rio knew what Jen was really asking. <i>Has she mentioned me?</i> Agatha hadn’t, but that didn’t mean she didn’t miss Jen. Rio could read their wife well enough to know that, with time, Agatha could be ready to start mending that fence. “Better,” They replied. “She’s doing a lot better, the best I’ve seen her since Alex.”</p><p>“I’m glad.” She nodded, leaving everything else unsaid.</p><p>“She’ll come around, just…” They blew out a breath. “Just give her a little bit of time.”</p><p>“It’s been six years,” Jen deadpanned.</p><p>“So waiting a smidge longer should be easy.”</p><p>She playfully scoffed, rolling her eyes. “I gotta go, but your ass is jumping ship with us, Vidal.”</p><p>“Yeah yeah,” Rio murmured, waving goodbye and shuffling out to their car in the lot.</p><p>They met Agatha in the waiting room, slouching in the seat next to her, lips pulled tight into a cheesy grin. “Everything work out with Kate last night?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, gaze softer than it had been in years. “Minimal maiming, nothing serious.”</p><p>“Did Nicky buy the story?”</p><p>“She might’ve been a little suspicious as to why lipstick was smudged, but she didn’t say anything.”</p><p>“So when can you ‘have dinner with ma’ again?”</p><p>Their wife’s face fell as she fidgeted with the ring on her middle finger, forcing her tone to be light. “Maybe wait on asking me that until we’re done here.”</p><p>“Why do you say that?” Rio sat up a little straighter.</p><p>“Because you might change your mind,” She supplied, breaking eye contact. “When was the last time therapy made us better?”</p><p>“Eh,” Rio considered, coolly brushing off the concern. “Sometimes things come back better after they’ve been cut down.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Lots of things. Lettuce, lavender, hydrangeas…”</p><p>Agatha snorted, her elbow lightly poking their ribs. “Shut up.”</p><p>“Gives the plant a good base for regrowth-”</p><p>Melina’s door swung open as the doctor blew out a sharp breath. “Ready?”</p><p>Why did it seem like Agatha and Melina knew something Rio didn’t? Their stomach dropped as they moved into the office, sitting on the familiar couch across from the same doctor they’d been seeing for five months at this point, but the air was heavy, the tone already grim. It made them inexplicably anxious, their posture stiff as Dr. Vostokoff got comfortable and began.</p><p>“How are we doing?” Melina asked, she had glasses perched on her nose and her eyes kept flickering to Agatha, as if she were checking on her. “You two have been through a lot in the past couple months, lots of change, progress.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha chirped, sitting forward and twirling that ring around. “Yeah, we’ve been talking more, not using sex as a crutch, we’ve been better.”</p><p>Melina nodded, then looked at them. “Rio?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio nodded back. “The best we’ve been in years, easily. Feels like it did before Alex. I’m just grateful we’ve made it here.”</p><p>“I’m happy to hear that,” Melina murmured, sounding sincere. “Being here today shows that you have both done a lot of work to get to this point. You care enough to try for one another, and that is admirable.” She grabbed her leatherbound notepad and fountain pen. “But, you have not finished hashing out the past, there are things I know need to be touched on.”</p><p>“Like what?” Rio honestly inquired, assuming everything had come to light.</p><p>“I am simply here to facilitate today but,” Melina said, glancing at Agatha. “This is your session. Whatever you two wish to discuss is up to you entirely. I’ll lead where I can, if I think it is needed, but otherwise…”</p><p>Agatha scowled at the doctor. “Seriously?”</p><p>“You got it,” She gently encouraged. “What would you like to talk about today, Agatha?”</p><p>Their wife let out an exasperated puff of air, slapping her hands down on her thighs and nervously running them along her jeans, muttering under her breath, “Shifty motherfucking shrink.” Agatha turned to look at Rio, an unmistakable pain resurfacing. “I want to talk about the first time we had sex after Alex.”</p><p>Rio’s lungs stopped working, the simple request careening them into the past. “What?” They sputtered out, hands already going clammy.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said, resolute in her choice. “I want to know why you…why you looked at me like that.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Like you didn’t love me anymore.”</p><p>They reared their head back, eyes bugging. “I have <i>always</i> loved you.”</p><p>Her face crinkled, eyes boring into Rio’s soul. “It didn’t feel like it. It felt as though you were obligated to sleep with me, but you saw me differently by then.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio reached out, threading their fingers together and shuffling closer. “Let me explain.”</p><hr/><p><b>May, 2020.</b></p><p>“I want mama to do the voices!” Rio’s seven year old whined, already tucked in bed. This was a nightly occurrence, of Nicky being upset that Agatha wasn’t around for bedtime. “You don’t do them right! The frog has a deep voice and the princess is fancy!” Ah, fancy meaning British, an accent Rio couldn’t do for the life of her.</p><p>“I’m sorry, princesa.” Rio bent down and gave her daughter a kiss on the forehead, flinging the book onto the nightstand. “Mama just isn’t feeling good.” And ‘good’ meaning her wife had spent her days withering away in bed, not that Rio blamed her for it. Agatha got all the time she needed as far as Rio was concerned, mentally and physically.</p><p>Rio spent her days running on empty, focusing on work and saving the kids she could. There was this tiny baby boy, Billy, who had fallen into her care a couple weeks back. He was so sweet and far too young to be dying of cancer, and she made this subconscious vow to protect him in a way that she couldn’t protect Alex, something to balance the scales in her mind. If she was at work, she couldn’t hurt Agatha any further. She saw how her wife looked at her now, as if she were Death herself, as if Rio were the very Grim Reaper that took their daughter.</p><p>And how could Agatha not see her that way? Rio had let her down, left her sliced open on a table without so much as keeping the promise of meeting Alex before she passed. But, the bills didn't stop, even if their lives had. She was offered bereavement leave, and Alice had begged her to take it, but where would that leave Rio? Trapped in a house and forced to ruminate in the pain she had inflicted on the person she loved most in this world? She didn’t even really need the extra shifts, she took them to give Agatha the space she so clearly needed.</p><p>Rio kept the family going with the help of Lilia. She kept up business as usual, clinging to the fact that Agatha hadn’t kicked her out yet. Rio would understand if she did, because their marriage wasn’t a marriage anymore. It was two people cohabitating and raising a kid together while ignoring the fact that they didn’t really speak to one another, didn’t touch. The funeral had been a hard day, Nicky and Agatha sobbing all the way through it as Rio watched on, catatonic. She placed a comforting hand on the small of Agatha’s back, but she felt the miniscule flinch her wife had reacted with, that Rio’s touch was something to fear, something to be disgusted by.</p><p>Rio stopped touching her after that. Hell, they barely touched before that. Lilia had given Rio a hug outside the cemetery, telling her <i>“The flowers were beautiful.”</i>, because she’d grown them herself. That had been the last human contact Rio had received in a while, aside from Nicky. And though she ached to be loved by her wife again, she knew that hatred Agatha carried was rightfully placed. Rio had lost their daughter, and lost Agatha in the process. Her punishment fit the crime.</p><p>“She never feels good,” Nicky sniffled. “When will mama feel good?”</p><p>Rio’s heart broke, shattering into a million pieces as she looked into her daughter’s eyes. Looking at Nicky had become a blade slicing Rio’s flesh open, because most days her brain would notice how much Alex resembled her big sister. How Alex would appear if she’d had the chance to grow up, to reach Nicky’s age.</p><p>“Soon, mi vida,” Rio lied, unable to know the answer herself. She clicked on Nicky’s nightlight, adjusting the covers to make sure her daughter was comfortable. “Get some sleep, yeah?”</p><p>“I miss mama,” Nicky whispered, flopping over onto her side away from Rio. “I miss you both.”</p><p>She sighed, placing one last kiss to Nicky’s scalp before standing up. “I know, baby. Me too.” Rio turned off the lights, leaving the door ajar so light would spill in from the hallway. This was the part of the night she dreaded most, facing Agatha. Facing her wife in days old clothing with her hair piled atop her head, her face sunken in and eyes devoid of emotion.</p><p>Rio walked in, not wanting to see how far gone Agatha was today, immediately moving for the dresser. “Nicky went down,” Rio said, keeping her tone neutral. She always did that now, forced her voice to stay flat, she didn’t get to feel when Agatha was feeling worse.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “Mhm.”</p><p>Rio whipped around, her eyes perking up at the sight. Agatha was a <i>vision</i>, beautiful as always. Her hair was clean and styled, there was makeup accentuating her features, jeans sculpting her body, a simple tank top displaying cleavage. But more than that, Agatha had <i>showered</i>, a once in a blue moon occurrence nowadays. Rio tried not to gape at Agatha perched on the edge of the bed, she had missed her wife in her fucking bones.</p><p>“You…you look” What was the etiquette here? She didn’t want to make a huge deal of Agatha being dressed, because that might guilt her about how she’d spent the past few months. “<i>Nice.</i>”</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha smiled, but it wasn’t a real one. Rio could see everything that Agatha was hiding, trying to perform through the pain.  “I figured it was time to get dressed again.”</p><p>“Right before bed…?” Rio tilted her head in confusion.</p><p>“It’s supposed to be more enticing than a three day old t-shirt and sweat pants.”</p><p>Enticing? Rio didn’t need real clothes and makeup to be attracted to her wife, even at her lowest, Agatha was still Agatha. Rio would take her in any form, but why did her wife think that she’d have to get dolled up just for her?</p><p>“Oh.” She nodded, closing the dresser drawer.</p><p>“It’s been long enough…since the surgery.” Agatha swallowed, mimicking a bird ready to take flight. See, nobody said what they meant anymore. ‘Surgery’ was sugarcoating the death of their daughter and the physical trauma endured by Agatha at Rio’s hands. She seemed uncomfortable, scared even.</p><p>Was Rio scaring her?</p><p>“Are you-” Rio stumbled in her speech. “You sure? I didn’t think you’d want to.”</p><p>Agatha calmly replied “I want to.”</p><p>It didn’t come across that way, did she mean something else? “Have sex?” Rio double checked, feeling like an asshole as she did.</p><p>Her wife looked so tired, so out of her own self. “Yes, Rio. Have sex.” Agatha tensed, the room vacant of any actual lust. “I’m recovered, and what have we got left to lose?”</p><p>Only each other.</p><p>Only you.</p><p>She hesitantly took a step forward. “And you’re <i>sure?</i>”</p><p>“As sure as I’ll ever be.” Agatha gazed up, damn near begging, and not in the fun way. “Don’t you miss me?” And that wasn’t said as a tease, but a genuine question, desperation lacing her tone. “I’m not enough or something?”</p><p>She was <i>everything.</i> She was the reason Rio kept going, she was the reason Rio was a mom, she was the reason Rio felt safe most days. Agatha was her everything and if she was questioning that, maybe Rio needed to try and give her this. She missed her wife, emotionally, mentally, and bodily. This could be a step forward into getting back to normal, to fixing what Rio had demolished.</p><p>“No, of course not.” Rio crouched down, placing her hands on Agatha’s thighs. “You’re perfect, baby. Always have been.”</p><p>“Then touch me.” Agatha whispered, throat already raw. “I’m telling you to.”</p><p>“Okay.” She whispered back, stretching up and connecting their lips in a kiss, a simple one. Agatha’s hands threaded through her hair, pulling Rio closer. It was good, it felt like home, to kiss her wife again. And Rio wanted her, showing that by tugging her hips and pulling her in, hoping her love could be felt.</p><p>She dropped her lips to Agatha’s neck, her senses flooded with how good that part of her wife smelled, how soft her skin was. Rio’s grip gently wandered to the hem of Agatha’s shirt, slowly working it up and over her head. Oh, her wife was Aphrodite incarnate, the soft curves from pregnancy and the freckles splattered along her chest. There wasn’t language for Agatha’s beauty, but Rio could spend her life searching for one.</p><p>“Don’t, um, maybe just avoid my nipples. They still kind of ache.” She quietly said, uncharacteristically timid. After Nicky, Agatha had become more confident in her body, motherhood making her feel strong. Their first time post-Nicky had been one of the most intimate experiences of Rio’s life, but she understood how this time was different.</p><p>“Yeah, whatever you need.” Rio cautiously smiled, giving her wife whatever reassurance she could. Her hands stayed clear of Agatha’s chest, helping her lay back on the bed and slowly undoing her jeans. She wanted to make sure Agatha had an out, that she knew she could stop this at any moment. Rio hoped sex would rekindle something, but she was not owed anything.</p><p>She took her time getting her wife’s clothes off, shucking off her own pants and shirt afterwards. Rio hovered over Agatha, moving her mouth down her wife’s body. The room quiet, her movements unsure.  She wasn’t trying to be so fucking stiff about everything, but it was hard to act as though this was normal, as if it wasn’t a monumental turn of events. Rio was too caught up in her own head, trying to do what she knew Agatha liked, while smothering her own concern.</p><p>Her lips dragged from Agatha’s sternum to her ribs, moving down her stomach with a constellation of stretch marks. Her sights landed on the scar, pink and a little puffy, letting her lips sear a kiss to it, longing to communicate that the reminder of Alex was something she’d worship if Agatha would allow. She didn’t have the words for it, but she’d spend the rest of her waking days lavishing that scar if it made Agatha content.</p><p>She peered up, delicately asking “Do you want my mouth on you?” eyes brimming with hope. Can I touch you? Is that allowed? Would that make you feel good? Can we be good?</p><p>Agatha nodded, biting her lower lip as her eyes fluttered shut.</p><p>So, she continued on, peppering kisses on her hips, her bush, gripping her thighs and spreading them. Rio wiggled down, the muscles of her wife’s legs shaking. She mouthed along the soft skin of Agatha’s inner thigh, trying to help her relax. If Rio was nervous, it made sense that Agatha would be too.</p><p>Rio switched to the other leg, her wife’s legs vibrating harder.</p><p>She looked up, Agatha’s face twisted in what appeared to be unrestrained <i>anguish.</i> Oh, she wasn’t nervous, she was <i>scared.</i> She was scared of Rio, she was scared of the monster she had married, she was scared of <i>Death.</i></p><p>Rio pulled away, she wouldn’t do this if Agatha wasn’t okay. “Mi amor, <i>you’re trembling.</i>”</p><p>Agatha shot up, pulling her legs to her chest as she wept. “I- I-”</p><p>“Baby.” Rio crawled towards her, trying to solve the problem she had caused. “Agatha, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“I <i>can’t.</i>” Agatha croaked, getting up and grabbing her robe off the hook, not breaking her stride until she was inside the bathroom and shutting the door. Rio’s eyes tracked her, rushing off the bed to follow.</p><p>Rio knocked, trying the knob, which of course was locked. “Cariño, let me in.”</p><p>“Please, just leave me alone.” Agatha sobbed back through the door.</p><p><i>All I do is leave you alone.</i></p><p>“Agatha?” She knocked again, desperately trying to help. Even if she could just hold her, maybe it’d make them both feel better. “Baby, I just wanna know you’re okay.”</p><p>“I’m not.” She bit out, the tears making her speech watery.</p><p><i>Me either.</i></p><p>Rio’s eyes burned, the tears flowing. “Mi amor, just…let me in.”</p><p>“And do what?!” Agatha snapped, followed by a harsh “Rio, get out.”</p><p><i>I miss you, please don’t push me away again.</i></p><p>“Agatha.” Rio let her forehead <i>thud</i> against the door in defeat.  “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” For killing our daughter, for ruining our family, for decimating our marriage, for <i>not</i> being what you need.</p><p>Agatha sniffled, her voice hollow. “I know.”</p><p><i>And it will never be enough.</i></p><p>She raised her knuckles one more time, a last ditch effort. “Open the door, please baby.”</p><p>Her wife went silent for a beat, her final decision being made. “Sleep on the couch tonight.”</p><p>Rio let out a heavy sigh through silent cries, listening to the order. It was reasonable, Rio couldn’t blame her. She found her shirt, putting it on and grabbing her pillow, leaving their bedroom with a haunting <i>click</i> of the door. She snagged a few blankets from the linen closet, taking her punishment as well as she could.</p><p>The ceiling was quite dull, she realized, staring up at it through reddened eyes. Her sobs hadn’t subsided, but they were muted enough by her own hand that she wouldn’t wake her wife or child. The couch was comfortable enough, more comfortable than the street that Agatha had no doubt wanted to throw her out into. She’d take whatever her wife needed to let out, Alex was always more hers than she was Rio’s. A mother ignoring her own child because the child was destined to die? Rio didn’t get to mourn what was her own doing, she didn’t get to be hurt.</p><p>An hour of tossing and turning later, Rio pulled out her phone, playing one of <i>David Attenborough’s</i> audiobooks. His voice was soothing enough to lull her to sleep, only woken up by her daughter bounding down the stairs the next morning. Nicky curiously stared down at her, clambering on top of her.</p><p>“Mami, why are you on the couch?” Her daughter almost shouted in her ear. Fuck, okay. <i>That</i> woke her up.</p><p>Rio sat up as much as she could with Nicky’s weight atop her, lying out of preservation for their daughter’s innocence. “I must’ve fallen asleep by accident, mija.”</p><p>“That’s silly,” Nicky observed, lifting the blankets to curl against Rio.</p><p>Rio slung her arm around her daughter, her chin placed atop her head. “It is, you’re right.”</p><hr/><p>They used a tissue to soak up their tears, free hand still tangled in their wife’s. “I thought I’d already lost you,” Rio croaked.</p><p>Agatha stared at them, her eyes glassy, reflecting their own state. “I- I thought you hated me.”</p><p>They’d circled back to this point so many times. “Mi amor, you didn’t lose Alex. You didn’t make her sick, you didn’t hurt her.”</p><p>“But I hurt you,” She quietly admitted.</p><p>“I hurt you too,” Rio countered, balling up the tissue. “Why do you think I hated you?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand slackened, pulling away. “You left me,” She muttered, voice thick. “You saw me for how broken I was.”</p><p>“I thought that was what you wanted. I knew when I saved you that you’d hate me.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, face etched with sorrow, with heartache, with grief. “I hated <i>myself</i>. I hated myself for not doing more for her. I hated myself for being the one to live. I- I hated being <i>alive.</i>”</p><p>Their stomach turned, a sick and rocky sensation swirling inside. “What?”</p><p>Their wife didn’t smile, but her lips quirked, as if to say <i>Oh well.</i> “I, uh, I thought you regretted choosing me over her. I…I did something.” Agatha’s eyes flicked over to Melina, who gave a gentle nod in response. “It was about a month after Alex, and I just…I wanted out. I wanted to stop being a <i>burden.</i>”</p><p>“Baby,” Rio whispered, fearing the image that was forming in their head. “What happened?”</p><p>“Nothing. Not really.” She wouldn’t look them in the eye. “I thought about-” Agatha’s voice was hesitant. “The pain meds I was on, how many it would take to die.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes shut briefly, yearning to touch her. To make everything better and ensure she’d never feel any pain ever again. “You thought about…<i>it?</i>”</p><p>“I had the pills in my hand when Nicky came home,” She rushed out, crossing her legs and wrapping her arms around herself. “I didn’t try again.”</p><p>The agony flowed through their veins, the knowledge that they had been so blind. They abandoned Agatha so completely, she wanted to take her own life. Rio extended their hand palm side up, letting Agatha decide whether or not to take it. “I am <i>so</i> sorry. I’m sorry I left you alone. I’m sorry I didn’t talk about her, didn’t mourn her with you. I’m s-sorry that I wasn’t what you needed. I’m sorry I didn’t make you feel safe enough to tell me or ask for help.” Their voice was scratchy from the tears, but that didn’t stop them. “I saved you because I’d rather you alive and <i>despise</i> me, than die as my wife. You’re not a burden, and I never regretted the call I made.”</p><p>“I just needed <i>you.</i> I didn’t need you to keep it all together while I crumbled. I needed to know that you were struggling just as much as I was.” Agatha took their hand, holding it. “I didn’t hate you, I never have. I figured that it was my body that killed her, it was me.”</p><p>“Baby, it was <i>my egg</i>, all you ever did was keep her safe.” If anything, it was Rio who set up Agatha and Alex for failure, being the one to crush them both.</p><p>Melina finally spoke, her hand must’ve been cramping from how much she had scribbled down by now. “Do either of you <i>truly</i> believe Alex’s passing was your doing?”</p><p>“Sometimes,” Agatha responded.</p><p>“All the time,” Rio said at the exact same time.</p><p>The doctor set her notepad aside, leaning in and placing her elbows on her knees. “The guilt that follows the death of a loved one, especially a child, can feel suffocating. Our brains look for answers, for causes, for logic. The biggest myth being that what we feel can be rationalized, there is nothing rational about death or the aftermath.” Melina’s gaze was sympathetic, her words kind. “There is <i>nothing</i> either one of you could have done for her. I know that sounds harsh, but it is the unfortunate reality. It is not your fault.” She watched them both, making sure they heard her. “It is <i>not</i> your fault. It was <i>never</i> your fault,” She glanced at Agatha, then looking at Rio. “Or yours.”</p><p>Rio wanted to take her words and be absolved of their sins, but it wasn’t that simple. “But-”</p><p>Melina raised her hand, halting them from continuing. “Alex’s life was cut short, you two gave her everything you possibly could. This will sound mean, but I promise I do not intend it to be.” She clasped her hands together, saying what they’d never considered. “There are things out of our control, and things our brains <i>cannot</i> rationalize. You both have been looking for answers, when the real one is just harder to swallow. That, sometimes, <i>girls die.</i>”</p><p>“Then why is it never enough?” Agatha’s free hand came to rest on Rio’s, a hiccupping cry following. “Then why does the grief hurt all the time? If it’s that easy, why does it always feel lacking?”</p><p>The doctor shifted back in her chair, softly saying “Love.” Melina pushed her glasses up, a comforting smile displayed on her lips. “And what is grief, if not love persevering?”</p><p>Their wife glanced at them, Rio bringing their tangled hands up to her mouth, pressing a tender kiss to Agatha’s knuckles. “I think you love her really well, then.”</p><p>A tiny grin formed on Agatha’s face, blinking back the tears. “<i>We</i> love her well.”</p><p>The rest of the session was spent getting themselves back together enough to leave. Though they did, hand in hand, abandoning some of their baggage behind in the office. When they reached the parking lot, Agatha stopped them. Their wife wordlessly dropped their hand, wrapping her arms around Rio. One around their waist, the other cradling the back of their head, fingers lightly running through their hair. Rio hugged her back, holding their whole world in their clutches.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha confessed. “For pushing you away, punishing you.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio echoed. “For pulling away, shutting down.”</p><p>They heard the fragile smile in Agatha’s tone as she said “<i>I forgive you.</i>”</p><p>“Me too.” They agreed, not a second of hesitation.</p><p>It didn’t fix everything, they weren’t suddenly back to how they were, but their marriage was sewing itself back together like wounded flesh. The apologies, the forgiveness, the love that lingered. They might never be who they were before, but the new version didn’t seem so unattainable now. If it took years, decades, centuries, Rio would be here. Right here, with their wife, doing the work.</p><p>Their wife let go after a long while, fiddling with the keys in her hand. “Do you, uh, wanna stay over tonight? We can tell teddy that you’re taking the couch, but you can just sneak up to our room once she’s asleep.”</p><p>Rio didn’t want to part from her, so they didn’t. “Yeah.”</p><p>“Meet you at home?”</p><p>“Can’t wait.”</p><p>That night, Rio ate dinner with their wife and child, laughing as their daughter talked about that sexist teacher getting reprimanded after Nicky had filed several formal complaints with the principal. They cleaned up the meal their wife had cooked, watched some TV on the couch with Nicky and Agatha, met Scratchy and fed him some spinach to get in his good graces, and let themself take comfort in being home with their family. It was bittersweet, to have it all back, to have the knowledge of what it took to get here.</p><p>Once Nicky had gone to bed, Rio waited about half an hour, creeping up the stairs and tiptoeing down the hall. They opened the door, their wife already cocooned in the sheets. Rio lifted the covers, sliding in behind her and gingerly pulling her flush with their body. Agatha wove their hands together, placing Ro’s against her chest, they relaxed at the steady <i>thump thump thump</i> of her heart.</p><p>Rio nuzzled into her neck, then asking “How can you forgive me, after all of it?”</p><p>“For the same reason you forgave me,” Their wife sleepily spoke, flipping over and meeting their gaze. “Because I love you anyways…I love you always.”</p><p>They didn’t have a response, opting to bury their head in her chest, their nose fitting snug against the hollow of her throat. Agatha took it in stride, letting her nails administer pacifying scratches against their scalp. “You don’t always have to be the strong one. You can crumble with me.”</p><p>She’d said it before, but this time she was making sure they really <i>heard</i> it.</p><p>Rio hadn’t realized the emotion barricaded within themself, letting the floodgates burst open as they wept into their wife’s shirt, holding onto her as though she’d disintegrate. They fell apart, trusting that Agatha would catch all the pieces.</p><p>Rio fell asleep that night without trouble.</p><p>Rio fell asleep that night wrapped in the love and forgiveness they’d wanted for six years.</p><p>Rio fell asleep that night in Agatha’s arms and stayed that way, waking up the next morning in the exact same spot.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Her arm was officially <i>dead</i>, her wife’s face smushed against her inner bicep for hours on end probably the cause. Agatha roused to the sound of her daughter at her door, rather than the blaring of her alarm, a knocking followed by “Mama, where’d you put Scratchy’s hay?” Another knock, then “Moooooom?”</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Rio’s swollen eyes opened, bolting upright at the sound. Agatha followed suit, climbing out of bed. “Uh, one sec, hon.”</p><p>The knob creaked as a hand on the other side gripped it. “It’s not with the rest of his stuff.”</p><p>“<i>Fuck.</i>” Rio whispered, head on a swivel to look for hiding spots.</p><p>Agatha frantically pointed to the bed, eyes bugging. How the fuck were they going to explain last night’s sleeping arrangements to their kid, and then add that mama and mami weren’t <i>officially</i> back together. Hell, Agatha wasn’t even sure where they stood with one another. She was telling the truth yesterday, when she said she forgave Rio, hearing their side of the aftermath had supplied some much needed context to what her brain had warped beyond recognition. Still, they hadn’t come to a conclusion on what the fuck they were to one another now. So, she was not about to explain all of that to her thirteen year old.</p><p>The door swung open, Rio dropping to the ground as if they were on fire, before literally <i>rolling</i> under the bed. If she didn’t have to act normal for Nicky, she would’ve cackled at the absurdity of that action. Agatha idly massaged her bicep, trying to get some blood flow to return, putting on a big smile for her daughter. “Morning!”</p><p>Nicky walked in, Scratchy cradled in her hand as she furrowed her brows. “Why are you so chipper?”</p><p>“Um,” She rolled her shoulder a bit, stiff from the weight of her wife’s head on it all night. “No reason, let’s find the hay.” Agatha took off, giving the bunny a few good morning pets and a couple of kisses on his head as she did so. She and Nicky walked into Alex’s room, now containing the enclosure.</p><p>It was sweet, the amount of time and research Nicky had done to ensure everything would be comfortable for Scratchy. Matting on the floor, an enclosure at least three hops wide, hidey-holes, chew toys, the whole nine yards. Agatha had grown quite fond of Scratchy in the past week or so, he was a bit of an asshole but a bit cuddlebug when he got comfortable enough with someone. He gravitated very suspiciously towards Agatha after day one, falling asleep on her lap when she was petting him in the rocking chair by the end of the third night.</p><p>Him being blind didn’t deter him from much, he was learning Agatha and Nicky’s voices, his whiskers prevented him from hopping into anything…most of the time. There had been one incident of him running into the gate of his enclosure by accident, but Agatha fed him some bell pepper for being brave about the whole ordeal and he was fine. It was also nice to have something to hold and talk to when Nicky was gone at Rio’s for a week, mostly because Scratchy couldn’t judge her or talk back.</p><p>Agatha rubbed her eyes as she yawned, checking the closet for the hay, pushing back some storage bins of old baby clothes to grab the bag from where it was wedged. Hopefully, Rio was using this time as a diversion to escape back to the couch, which Agatha didn’t really want, but what the fuck else were they to do. She handed off the hay, taking the bunny while her daughter refilled his feeder.</p><p>“Morning, mister,” Agatha cooed, watching as his floppy ear twitched, recognizing her voice. “How was your night?”</p><p>He looked at her, blinked, and said nothing.</p><p>See? Perfect company.</p><p>“I was looking into it,” Nicky said, stuffing the hay into the feeder. “We should get him a grooming appointment. It's good for them and he deserves some pampering after being fostered.”</p><p>“Damn, I wish someone had booked me a spa day after going into foster care,” Agatha murmured into the rabbit’s fur, nuzzling his face close to hers. “Aww, he comes from a broken home, just like me.”</p><p>“He’s like your familiar.” Her daughter closed the feeder, shoving the hay off to the side. “Kindred spirits and all that.”</p><p>“I’ll look into a grooming appointment.” Agatha gently handed Scratchy back to Nicky. “And don’t spend too much time in here, you’ve got school today and I wish for us to arrive on time at least once before the end of the school year.”</p><p>“I’m just going to brush him and refill his water, then I’ll get ready, promise.” Nicky squished Scratchy against her face as she spoke. “I should get into crochet, imagine him in a little sweater!”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, giving her daughter a quick peck on her scalp before leaving. “Whatever you want, baby.” She shuffled back down the hall, closing her bedroom door and cautiously peeking under the bed. No Rio, so they must’ve made their escape, thank god. She got up, turning around to head for the bathroom. “Jesus, fuck!” Agatha nearly shouted, her wife’s hand clapping over her face.</p><p>“Shhhh,” Rio whispered, waiting for a beat before dropping their hand.</p><p>“Your eyes are so creepy when I’m not expecting them!” Agatha said, clutching her chest since her heart felt like it was about to explode. “Why are you still here?”</p><p>“I hid behind the door.” They shrugged, adding "I didn't want to go back to the couch.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath at that, relaxing. That sentence meant more than at face value, it went deeper for Rio. They didn’t want to go back to the couch, and Agatha didn’t want to send them there. She gave a gentle nod. “Okay.”</p><p>“You work today?”</p><p>“It’s a weekday, so yes,” She deadpanned. “You?”</p><p>“Nope,” They said. “Which is a good thing because I don’t know how well I’d be able to focus.”</p><p>She wanted to offer them something, a piece of comfort, even if she couldn’t be here for them. “Well, you could stay here today. If you wanted.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio asked, lips curling upwards. “You sure?”</p><p>“Scratchy would probably like the company.” She shrugged. “Let yourself crumble for a bit, teddy and I will survive.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio replied, slightly bashful. “Means a lot.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, pointing towards the bathroom. “I, um-”</p><p>“Oh, yeah.” Rio moved out of her way. “I’ll go see if Nicky wants help with Scratchy.”</p><p>“Cool.”</p><p>“Cool.”</p><p>“Also,” Rio began, pointing to the bed, or what was underneath. “You should really change the passcode on the padlock if you don’t want your ex wife snooping.”</p><p>Agatha cocked her head, freezing just shy of the bathroom. “Did you open our sex box?” It was a locked box under the mattress, having found out early on that little kids snoop through their parents rooms. Nicky must’ve been three or four when she found a pair of cuffs in one of their nightstands, and Agatha had to make up a lie about her and Rio playing cops and robbers. After that, everything got hidden away lest she die of embarrassment.</p><p>“I just wanted to know if you kept everything!” They defended, a smug grin on their face. “Some of the leather is <i>real</i> dry, mi amor.”</p><p>“I'm about to grab a paddle and thwack you.” She raised a single eyebrow, placing her hand on her hip. “Repeatedly!”</p><p>“I’m not opposed to that-”</p><p>“Upside the head!”</p><p>“Still not opposed,” Rio murmured, finally leaving the room.</p><p>Agatha showered, got dressed, and was scouring her closet for her shoes, when her wife came back. Rio wandered in, coffee in hand, willingly handing it over. She took it, slipping on her loafer as her face crinkled. “Thank you…?”</p><p>“I put it in a thermos so you could take it to work with you,” They said, walking away.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>Agatha took a sip of the coffee, too weak but otherwise fine. She left the walk-in, finding the bed already made. “You don’t have to, like…do chores to stay here. I offered.”</p><p>Her wife didn’t seem bothered, sitting on the edge of the mattress. “I don’t mind, you know I like keeping busy. I was thinking, if it's okay with you, I could work on the garden today?”</p><p>Or what remained of it, the husk of what Rio’s garden used to be. Agatha had left it to rot when they moved out, letting it grow as bitter as she once was. “Yeah, that’s fine.” She awkwardly smiled, finding that the idea didn’t bother her. “I gotta go, it’s a teacher planning day for the high school, so I should be back early this afternoon.”</p><p>“Got it,” Rio chirped. “Can I borrow some clothes?” Because they were still in their borrowed pajamas from last night.</p><p>“Yeah.” She pointed towards the closet. “Pretty sure some of your old gardening clothes are shoved somewhere in a corner anyway.”</p><p>“Thanks.” They got up, brushing past her.</p><p>Agatha used her free hand to grab their wrist, halting them. Before she could second guess herself, Agatha kissed their cheek, a simple farewell. “Have a good day, bye.”</p><p>Her wife seemed stunned, but smiled, snaking their arms around her waist and facing her. Rio slowly leaned in, which was dumb because they had kissed millions of times before, letting their lips meet hers in a chaste fashion. It was fleeting, a peck at most, but when Rio pulled away, their pupils were dilated all the same. “Have a good day, mi alma.”</p><p>“Christ,” She muttered, pulse spiking. Rio let go, and she retreated, grabbing her bag before heading downstairs and loading herself and Nicky into the car. She let her daughter picked the music, much to her own dismay, because what the fuck was Laufey and why did her daughter like it?</p><p>The middle school and high school were only about five minutes apart, Agatha stopping a block away to drop off Nicky. “I like having both of you around in the morning," Nicky spoke, getting her backpack from the backseat. “They should sleep over more often, last night was fun.”</p><p>Did she know? Did Nicky know what they were hiding? Were they obvious? Why did Agatha feel like she was a teenager keeping a secret right now? “Yeah, maybe.”</p><p>“Remember, I’m studying at Kamala’s after school, so you don’t need to pick me up.”</p><p>Agatha squinted at her daughter, no memory of that plan ever being communicated prior to right now. “Studying?”</p><p>“Fine,” She sighed. “We’re doing another Gilmore Girls rewatch.”</p><p>“Understandable,” Agatha snorted, waving her daughter off. “Have a good day, only antagonize those who deserve it!”</p><p>“Antagonize everyone, got it.” Her daughter got out, waving back and walking off.</p><p>It was around noon when her peace was interrupted, the meeting this morning about end of year planning already giving her a headache. Kate popped her head in, an apologetic smile on her face. “Heyyyyy.”</p><p>“What do you want?” Agatha looked up from her screen, pushing her glasses to sit atop her head.</p><p>“Why do you assume I want something?”</p><p>“‘Cause you said <i>heyyyy</i>, and that only ever happens when you want something.”</p><p>Kate walked in, nervously toying with the ends of her hair. “Could I…borrow some Expo markers?”</p><p>She flopped back in her chair, slapping her hand down on her desk. “Kate! Again?”</p><p>“I’ve been stealing from Sharon but she’s catching on!”</p><p>“Who’s Sharon?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Mrs. Davis…? Two doors down?” Kate pointed to the wall in reference. “Captain of our bar trivia team.”</p><p>Didn’t ring a bell.</p><p>“I am <i>not</i> on that trivia team, I told you guys no.”</p><p>“Not the point,” The other teacher squeaked. “Can I have the markers?”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha grumbled, cracking her neck. “Don’t take purple, though. It’s mine.”</p><p>Kate grabbed a red and a blue, fiddling with them as she continued to stand there. Agatha peered up, unamused. “Anything else?”</p><p>The younger woman rounded her desk, perching on the edge. “Okay, I’ve been patient but you never gave me an update about your date with your ex.”</p><p>“And people wonder why I don’t have female friends…” Or any friends, really. “It was fine.”</p><p>“C’mon, give me something. I’m in a drought and you’re the only thing giving me hope.”</p><p>“Try trolling bars near hospitals, that's the only advice I got.” Agatha turned back to her computer.</p><p>“Is that how you and Rio met?”</p><p>“Yup,” She huffed, increasingly becoming more annoyed.</p><p>“Maybe we could go together, one night…” Kate smiled, goofily trying to connect with a notoriously prickly woman. “You could be my wingman.”</p><p>Agatha side eyed that, making Kate amend her statement. “Or not, whatever.”</p><p>She logged off, deciding she was done for the day. “I’m heading out early, if Maria asks, Nicky's sick and I have to rush home.”</p><p>“Got it,” Kate said, masking her disappointment.</p><p>Agatha felt a small twinge of guilt while collecting her stuff. “I’ll let you know about…the wingman stuff.”</p><p>Her classroom neighbor brightened at that, suddenly giddy. “Oh my god, yes! It’ll be so much fun, we could-”</p><p>“Kate.” She raised her hand to cut the other woman off. “Be cool.”</p><p>“Right.” Kate nodded, backing out of the room. “I’m cool, I’m <i>so</i> cool.”</p><p>Yes, they were friends, and had been for years, but in the way that Agatha kept her around for when she needed something. Of course Kate would want more eventually, she just thought she’d be able to retire before the fateful day came. She followed Kate out, locking her classroom before bolting to her car. Honestly, it was hard for her to focus with everything going on with Rio, she might as well cut her losses and go home. So, she did. Agatha arrived at the townhouse twenty minutes later, dropping her stuff at the door, kicking off her shoes and wandering into the living room. The blankets she had given Rio last night were folded and stacked on the arm, the place quiet.</p><p>Agatha looked around the kitchen, catching a glimpse of movement outside the sliding glass doors. She watched as Rio, dressed in old cargos and a beater tank, ripped out weeds, the sun beating down on them. She could see the sweat glistening over their tattoos, the darker wet patch on the back of their top, the perspiration beading on their hairline. It was April, so it wasn’t overly warm out, but the manual labor must’ve been taxing. Agatha swallowed, her mouth dry, <i>good god</i>. She wanted to climb Rio like a fucking tree all of a sudden, openly staring while her nose nearly pressed against the glass.</p><p>Was that allowed? Would Melina say it was a bad idea? Did either of those questions really matter in this moment? No, they didn’t, she decided. Agatha sauntered onto the deck, calling over to her wife. “How long have you been at this?”</p><p>Rio whipped around, throwing the weeds into a trashbag. “Not long, I only came out here when I was done with the dishwasher.”</p><p>“The dishwasher?”</p><p>“I ran it this morning and it was making a weird sound-”</p><p>“Yeah, it gargles."</p><p>“You didn’t find that odd?”</p><p>She shrugged. “It’s not my business what sounds things make.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, tying off the bag and climbing the steps of the deck. “It is, but the hose needed to be replaced.”</p><p>“And you just, like, did that?”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s pretty easy,” Rio explained. “I went to the hardware store and bought another hose, swapped out the old one with the new one. Voilà, no more gargling.”</p><p>Up close, Agatha noted the sliver of ab Rio was displaying, their happy trail all shiny. To make matters worse, her wife then pulled the bottom of the tank up, using it to wipe some of the sweat off their face. Were they doing this on purpose? The home improvements and the sweat and the fucking nonchalance of it all….Agatha needed to fuck them <i> so bad.</i></p><p>She was silent for a few seconds, her brain rewiring itself in order to talk. “...That’s really fucking hot, I won’t even try and lie.”</p><p>They smiled, dropping the garbage bag and peeling off their gardening gloves. “That’s not why I did it.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha breathed out, hooking her fingers in the belt loop of Rio’s cargos and tugging. “That’s what makes it hotter.”</p><p>Her wife stumbled forward until their bodies were flush, leaning back fractionally. “What, uh, what do you think Melina would say about this?”</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha purred, tugging again. “I can genuinely say, I don’t fucking care.”</p><p>That was enough for Rio, fisting their grip in Agatha’s hair and shooting forward. Her wife moaned as their lips crashed into one another, both desperate for contact. Unlike the kiss this morning, this one was a pistol signaling the beginning, both of them taking off without another thought. It was sloppy, as she tilted her head and slid her tongue against Rio’s. It was intense, Agatha fervently trying to grab handfuls of her wife, Rio doing the same. It wasn’t cautious or timid, it was so fucking natural, to devour one another on the back deck of their home on a random weekday afternoon.</p><p>Rio’s hands fell from her hair, quickly curling around her ass as they hoisted Agatha up so her legs would lock around their waist. She loved when Rio did that, picked her up as though she weighed nothing, carried her up the stairs to their bedroom and placed her on the bed like one would something precious. She looked up from the edge of the bed through her lashes as she undid the zipper of Rio’s pants, a smug grin on her face as she pulled them down their legs. Her wife kicked the rest of the fabric off, their tank top following right after, apparently already missing her lips as they bent down to kiss her again. Leaving them in their boxers and tape as their tongue met hers.</p><p>It had been seven weeks since the last time they’d done this, and Agatha had been restraining herself the entire fucking time. She recognized that they couldn’t keep using sex as a crutch forever, but this time wasn’t to avoid discussing more. The worst parts were out in the open, and Rio was still here. Rio had been here the whole time, waiting and supporting. They’d put Agatha first, they didn’t bail.</p><p>Rio didn’t bail.</p><p>Rio didn’t leave.</p><p>Rio didn’t leave her <i>alone.</i></p><p>Rio had even crumbled with her for a minute there.</p><p>Every road led to them, it always came back to Rio.</p><p>And it always would.</p><p>Her wife peered down at her, the look in their eyes was the same one she remembered from the bar nearly nineteen years ago. Every ounce of love, every ounce of affection, and admiration, it was all still there, mingled up in the amber. Agatha felt the oxygen expand her lungs before she blew it all out, how could she ask for more than that? She reached down to the button of her jeans, hastily undoing them and pushing the denim down. Rio knelt on the floor in front of her, helping to discard the fabric.</p><p>Her wife placed a quick kiss on her knee, smiling against the skin. Rio didn’t expect more than this, than a half-clothed quickie. She didn’t know the exact details of what the fuck they were doing, but she knew she didn’t want <i>that.</i> <i>“You’re not a burden, and I never regretted the call I made.”</i> That's what they had said, right? And right now, with Rio’s gazed trained on her face, Agatha couldn’t find it in herself to doubt it.</p><p>She reached for the hem of her simple white t-shirt, her wife’s hands quickly covering her own to stop her. “Cariño, you don’t have to do that. I don’t want you regretting anything.”</p><p>The consideration was kind, a genuine regard for the step Agatha was about to take, but it was unnecessary. She was confident in her choice, holding eye contact as she spoke. “Last time, you said you wanted me to do this when I understood the full weight of my decision.” Agatha wiggled her fingers, a cue for Rio to let go, which they did. “I understand what I’m doing,” She gently said, adding “<i>I’ve never regretted anything about you, baby.</i>”</p><p>Agatha would never know if she’d ever truly be at peace with her scar, its origins, all that it held. But she was done withholding that trust from Rio, withholding the intimacy from herself. This was it, the last card she had in her deck, letting the stack slip through her fingers. She was showing her hand, but it was Rio, so it didn’t scare her like it once had. The scar wasn’t her fault, it wasn’t Rio’s, it was something etched into her forever to prove that Alex was here once. It didn’t have to be a reminder of her death, it could be a celebration of her life, however short. Maybe it could just be neutral, a statement that Alex had people who loved her, and Agatha’s body carried the proof. That could be beautiful, it could be enough, it <i>was</i> enough.</p><p>She pulled the shirt over her head, flinging it elsewhere. Agatha deftly unclipped her bra, adding it to the pile of clothes on the floor. Her underwear was low cut, clinging to her hip bones. There was nothing left between the thin strip of soft, raised, faded pink skin, and her wife’s sight. Rio’s eyes moved to it like a moth to the flame, their hands resting on her thighs. It didn’t feel wrong to have them seeing it, her body and brain calm as her wife simply looked.</p><p>Fate.</p><p>Something written in the stars.</p><p>The hunter, bowing down to the goddess of the hunt.</p><p>Whichever she chose to believe wouldn’t matter, not in the long run. Because, call it an invisible ribbon, call it destiny, she was bound. Bound to Rio, bound to this love. Something so earnest and pure, she’d never be able to sever it. Her heart beat for Rio just as much theirs did for her, and carving it out and stowing it away for nearly four years hadn’t made those binds snap or fray.</p><p>Agatha would love Rio until all the blood left her veins.</p><p>Agatha would love Rio til’ the grave.</p><p>Agatha would love Rio with her dying breath.</p><p>Agatha would love them, in the most fundamental of ways, no matter how long the in between had been. No matter how much time had been lost, no matter how much heartache had been endured.</p><p>She would love them.</p><p>As if it were the most natural thing she could do, as if it were as innate as breathing.</p><p>And as her wife inched forward, Agatha only felt the syrupy warmth of their lips on the scar. This memory left to go numb on her body could feel again, the pain coming to a dull end. A prelude to more, a promise, a vow.</p><p>Rio looked up at her, the kiss gentle and filled with things left unsaid.</p><p>The healing, the grief, all carried a pain, a measured agony.</p><p>The resolution?</p><p>Agatha gingerly threaded her fingers through Rio’s hair, her wife slow blinked back at her, their eyes closing for a beat. When they opened, the amber was close to golden from the sunlight and tears swirling in Rio’s irises.</p><p>Rio’s hands held her hips, thumbs running along the web of stretchmarks, their nose close to nuzzling where the scar sat. Their head bowed in something akin to prayer, if either of them believed in that.</p><p>She remained there, accepting the intimacy, the vulnerability.</p><p>The worship.</p><p>Agatha lightly tilted their head back, making Rio’s gaze meet her own and communicating all she could muster in that single look.</p><p><i>You can touch me.</i></p><p><i>It’s allowed.</i></p><p><i>It would make me feel good.</i></p><p><i>We can be good.</i></p><p>The resolution, she was going to enjoy.</p>

<p>“You are <i>breathtaking,</i> mi amor.” Rio unwound the fabric of her underwear from her ankles, immediately trailing their lips up her legs, each kiss leaving behind a new dedication. “Eres la mujer más hermosa del mundo.” <i>You’re the most beautiful woman in the world.</i></p><p>So fucking sappy, and even worse, sincere.</p><p>“Rio, baby,” Agatha almost whined, reclining back on her elbows. “Need you up here.”</p><p>Her wife took their time, slowly, torturously, mouthing along whatever skin they could find. One hand stayed on her waist, Rio’s thumb lightly brushing along her scar. Rio’s tongue darted out as they worked their way up, licking her already erect nipple before wrapping their lips around it and sucking, their free hand methodically rolling the nipple not currently between their teeth. On reflex, Agatha arched into the touch, her fingers splayed against Rio’s scalp, dark locks seeping out between her fingers.</p><p>“Whatever you want, cariño. Anything for you,” They murmured as they let her nipple go, swiftly switching to the other one and giving it the same treatment.</p><p>Impatient as ever, Agatha snapped their head back, forcing those caramelly eyes to give her their undivided attention. She guided Rio's hand off her waist, directing to the apex of her thighs, now beginning to feel sticky from neglected arousal. “I just want you,” Agatha softly admitted, her body slumping down as her head hit the pillow.</p><p>Something flickered behind her wife’s gaze, something Agatha couldn’t quite discern. “Yeah?” They asked hopefully, eagerly.</p><p>She gave a gentle nod as Rio’s hand cupped her cunt, a wanton groan following. “Does it <i>feel</i> like I’m lying?” Agatha had <i>earned</i> this. The years of mediocre hookups, the faceless bodies she used and discarded as a means of distraction, the year of denying herself while actively staying in a relationship that she knew was doomed. Because none of them were Rio, and none of them cherished her the way her wife did. Nobody else handled her with such aggressive care, nobody was patient enough.</p><p>It was Rio, that’s who she wanted.</p><p>Her wife’s fingers flexed, just barely applying any pressure to her leaking cunt. “Shit, mi alma-”</p><p>“Am I lying?” Agatha repeated, making Rio face the reality– that they were it. No more sitting on the fence, no more uncertainty. She wanted Rio to recognize that, fucking <i>feel</i> it. “Tell me.”</p><p>Rio shook their head, swallowing as their voice shook. “No, <i>you’re not.</i>”</p><p>Her hands relaxed, gently sliding out of their hair to cup their face. She normally was not a fan of emotional sex, Agatha actually fucking loathed the term ‘love making’, but she had to say it now. Mostly because she was hoping to be too fucked-out to speak afterwards. “I love you <i>always</i>. I love you <i>anyway</i>.”</p><p>Rio blinked before diving down, crashing their lips against hers. Their tongue wrenched her mouth open, hungrily kissing her in lieu of a response. All too quickly, in her humble opinion, did Rio break away, moving down her neck. The ferocity they were acting with could only leave Agatha clutching on, bowing her back to offer herself up. Rio moved in a flurry, teeth clamping down before vanishing, on a journey to seemingly claim her. They shuffled back, lavishing their tongue over her tits, a multitude of bruises in their wake. Hands greedily groped at her body, her chest, her thighs, her stomach, her cunt. Rio was possessed, a starved tiger let out of its cage, sweeping over Agatha in a rampage.</p><p>“<i>God,</i>” Agatha whimpered as her wife’s canines sank into her hip, Rio’s eyes darkened as they peered up at her.</p><p>“Don’t take this as me not wanting to see you,” Rio lowly warned, hooking their grip right on her back dimples and harshly <i>flipping</i> her over onto her stomach. Agatha quickly used her elbows to posture herself up, knees digging into the mattress. Rio’s left hand palmed her ass, the right snaking between her thighs, thumbing softly petting her folds and spreading them. “Tienes el coño más hermoso, mi amor.” <i>You have the most gorgeous pussy, my love.</i></p><p>“Lo sé, guapo,” She hurried out, shifting her hips back into the touch. “Do something about it,” Agatha barked, needing to get this show on the fucking road before she dripped onto the duvet.</p><p>And because Rio always buckled when she got demanding, they obeyed, eagerly shoving their face between plush thighs, mouth open as it made contact. They obviously harbored no concern for keeping themself in check, the strong, warm muscle protruding from between their lips immediately applying pressure with flat and powerful licks. Seriously, one would think Rio is licking a damn ice cream cone, exhibiting the impatience of a toddler.</p><p>“<i>Good boy,</i>” She encouraged, subtly grinding against her wife’s tongue. Agatha grinned to herself when she heard the faint whine from the back of Rio’s throat, only muffled due to her pussy on their face. “Just like that baby, keep going.”</p><p>And because they had spent nearly two decades getting acquainted with how to fuck one another, keep going, Rio did. They tongued their way over her drooling hole, through her slit, and delivered a light suckle to her clit. Not enough to make her come, but enough to keep her on edge. Her thighs tensed when she felt Rio retrace their path, going further this time. The very tip of their tongue hooked into her entrance for just a beat before continuing its journey, Rio’s fingers splayed on her thigh in a bruising hold. Agatha crumpled onto her forearms, raising her ass up.</p><p>They didn’t stop however, ravenously eating as though her arousal was ambrosia, some divine concoction that they’d get them inebriated. It would not be the first time Rio got pussy drunk, and this would hardly be the last. No, Rio didn’t stop, not as they licked over her perineum, not as the hand that was still on her ass made quick work of spreading her cheeks. Eh, she showered a few hours ago, let them have their fun.</p><p>“Dios mío, I missed you baby.” Rio delivered a few harsh nips to the meat of her ass, one definitely hard enough to leave an imprint for the next couple days. Meanwhile, Agatha writhed, the blood rushing to her clit was starting to hurt. Her own slick was beginning to mat in her bush, she needed Rio to fucking <i>do</i> something.</p><p>Agatha whipped her head around, glaring over her shoulder and using her dominant voice. “You either make me come now, or I tie you up and paddle you until your ass is basically ground meat.”</p><p>“And that’s supposed to scare me?” Rio chuckled, a disbelieving grin on their face.</p><p>“Oh no, the scary part is me grabbing your dick and fucking myself with it over and over right in front of you,” She casually told. “While you’re still bound of course.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t.”</p><p>“I can still tie my damn knots.” Agatha narrowed her gaze, raising her brows. “You wanna find out?”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled into a small pout. “No.”</p><p>“Then be a good boy and make me come.”</p><p>“…Will you still tie me up, though?”</p><p>“Maybe next time, baby,” Agatha said. “Let’s see if you can earn it first.”</p><p>That was incentive enough, with her wife burying their face again. In tandem, Rio’s fingers ran through her slit before two digits sunk seamlessly into her pussy. Agatha preened at the sensation, her wife’s tongue running around the rim of her asshole while their fingers began pumping. In their time together, Agatha had learned early on that Rio didn’t really care <i>where</i> their mouth went, so long as it was on some part of her body, kind of like a barnacle.</p><p>Her fingers fisted in the sheets as her back arched, basically thrusting back and fucking herself on Rio’s fingers. Agatha stifled a cry when Rio added a third digit, the stretch melded with Rio’s very talented tongue, and had her lungs working overtime. “<i>Fuck,</i>” She muttered, jaw going slack against the bed, her wife’s fingers cemented around her hips. Jesus fuck, didn’t they need air?</p><p>Skilled fingers curled, zeroing in on her g-spot with pinpoint precision because of course Rio knew had every part of her memorized. Rio sped up their space, her cunt contracting as their tongue kept working. They gently tugged her back, essentially forcing her to take them deeper. “Baby,” She called out, a warning. “I’m gonna come, oh- fuck- ‘m gonna-”</p><p>Agatha’s heart palpated as Rio continued pumping, pulling their face away to harshly <i>clamp</i> down on her ass cheek. She wailed out at the pain, but that wasn't what sent her over the edge, no. Rio’s fucking vampire teeth were removed after a beat, only for them to administer a heavy <i>slap</i> to where the bite was still far too raw. All without even pausing their fingers.</p><p>“<i>RIO!</i>” She screeched, pitched high and strangled. The orgasm felt hot, like melted candlewax being pushed through her capillaries instead of actual air. But her wife didn’t cease, didn’t give her a moment to recover.</p><p>“You can give me another,” They rasped, forcing their digits in and out through her pussy spasming with pleasure. “You’re never satisfied with one at a time, right querida?”</p><p>“Mmhm,” Agatha hummed before crying out as Rio reached around with their free hand and mercilessly <i>pinched</i> her clit. Rio’s upper body folded onto her back, their abs felt sticky with sweat against the dimples of her lower back. “Motherfucker, oh my god!”</p><p>“Feel good, my love? Do you remember <i>pain?</i> You always were such a glutton for it,” Her wife lowly spoke, though their tone didn’t sound degrading, just genuinely happy to make Agatha feel good.</p><p>“So- ssss- good,” She slurred out, one final <i>tug</i> on the oversensitive bundle of nerves and Agatha was a goner. Her body collapsed flat on the bed, her knees giving out from the tremors of her orgasm. Rio whispered soft praises, though they were muffled through the blood rush in her ears.</p><p>Agatha heaved out oxygen, trying to catch her breath while her legs shook. She felt the searing of Rio’s lips slowly creeping up her spine until they reached her neck, mouthing over the delicate skin and softly sucking right on her pulse point. She pushed the hair out of her face, getting her bearings again. “Holy fuck.”</p><p>“That good?” Her wife whispered, hands brushing along her stomach and hips.</p><p>“Don’t get all smug,” Agatha grumbled, finally looking over her shoulder with a smirk. Their lips all shiny with her slick. “You look like you have on lipgloss.”</p><p>“Yours is the only kind I wear,” They chuckled. “And why can’t I gloat about my handiwork?”</p><p>Her eyes trailed down their form, nothing on but their tape and heather gray boxers, a dark spot right on the crotch. “Because then I might not feel generous enough to blow you.”</p><p>Rio pulled back and sat up, pupils dilated. “That’s on the table?”</p><p>See, the thing about having sporadic, emotionally detached sex for almost four years, is that Agatha didn’t linger. She got what she needed from the exchange, and kicked her ex out. Meaning, there were <i>a lot</i> more options on the table now. Options that she wouldn’t have engaged in prior, namely the things she knew drove Rio up a fucking wall with arousal.</p><p>Agatha flipped over, smiling at her wife who currently resembled a puppy who had just heard the word ‘treat’ uttered into the air. If they had a fucking tail, it would have been wagging currently. “Go put on the strap.”</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>She reached over to the nightstand, pushing past all the clutter and the stack of books, plucking a hair tie from the pile of many. “Does it look like I’m joking?”</p><p>“Shit.” They sprang off the mattress, disappearing momentarily to finagle the box out from under the bed frame.</p><p>Agatha barely had enough time to throw her hair up into a ponytail by the time Rio had stripped off their underwear and fastened the harness. She snickered at which strap Rio had picked, it her favorite because of the length and girth. It was Rio’s favorite because the grind pad just always seemed to hit the right way.</p><p>“Eager?” Agatha snorted, pointing to the spot on the bed where she wanted them to sit.</p><p>Rio sat down, leaning their weight back on their hands. “Can you blame me? We haven’t done a lot of this since before Alex…” They mumbled that last part, not as an accusation but a sad fact.</p><p>She couldn’t even remember the last time they had sex without barriers between, emotional or physical. “You’re right.”</p><p>“Don’t get me wrong, I always love having sex with you, but-”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha softly cut them off. “I thought that if I denied you access, and myself the intimacy, it would mean less.”</p><p>“Did it? Mean less?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, a grin on her lips. “Obviously fucking not.”</p><p>Rio beamed, a light blush coating their cheeks. “You have <i>such</i> a crush on me.”</p><p>Agatha raised her chin in defiance. “Do not.”</p><p>“You like me <i>soooo</i> much,” Her wife said, reaching out a lightly poking the spot right below her ribs where she was ticklish. “You <i>love</i> me.”</p><p>She swatted away Rio’s hand, shuffling off the bed. “Do you want me to suck your dick or not, because you are on thin ice right now.”</p><p>Their face fell, swallowing hard. “Wait, um no, I’ll behave.”</p><p>Agatha dropped to her knees between Rio’s legs, sinking her claws into the meat of their thighs. “That’s what I thought.” She held out her palm in a request, Rio automatically spitting into it so she could use the saliva to coat the length of the silicone. Her wife always got off to this, whether Rio was the one on their knees or the one wearing the harness. Agatha liked it as a form of power play, because while she might be the one with eight inches of fake cock down her throat, she could also control how much pressure the grind pad would hit Rio with.</p><p>She clasped her hand around the strap, slowly stroking while teasing along Rio’s inner thigh. Soft kisses, harsh sucks, loving bites. Agatha could fucking <i>smell</i> the heady scent of her wife’s slick, painfully aroused. With that information, Agatha took her sweet time, making sure the base of the strap would provide <i>some</i> pressure, just not nearly enough. Rio knew better than to touch without permission, their hands on the bed, twitching while their eyes remained glued to her. Even after all this time, they both fell back into their roles without a second thought.</p><p>A mewl left Rio’s throat, eyes glazed over with unshed tears. She looked up at them, insincerely pouting with concern. “What’s the matter, handsome?”</p><p>Rio’s voice was desperate. “You’re killing me.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s half the fun,” Agatha giggled, biting her lower lip for a moment. “Do you know <i>why</i> I’m rewarding you?”</p><p>They looked a little lost, probably the sex fog their brain was swimming in. “Uh, because you really missed me…?”</p><p>Partially.</p><p>But no.</p><p>She swiped her tongue out, grazing the very tip of Rio’s cock, her wife moaning as if it were a real appendage. “No, I’m rewarding you because I never got the chance to thank you properly.”</p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed. “For what?”</p><p>“Do you know how bone-achingly sexy it was to watch you break that bitch’s nose?” She rhetorically questioned. “If the blood on your knuckles had been yours and not hers, I would’ve licked it off myself.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio choked out. “That wasn’t why I did it-”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha responded, giving a winking as her parted lips hovering a couple inches away from the strap. “That's what makes it hotter.”</p><p>Rio never did anything in exchange, well except for the edging in the bathroom after therapy that one time. But it <i>most</i> instances, Rio did what they did because they just wanted Agatha happy. <i>“Mami would do anything for you, for us.”</i> Damn, Agatha really had to start giving Nicky more credit, that kid was too fucking observant.</p><p>Agatha kept eye contact through her lashes, giving the silicone small kitten licks before relaxing her tongue to let Rio’s dick glide over the muscle. She bobbed her head, taking more length each time, watching as her wife’s jaw dropped. The sight must’ve been entrancing, Rio all but hypnotized as they stared, limbs going rigid. Agatha could tell they had locked their elbows to stop from touching. And because she was <i>so</i> nice, she helpfully grabbed one of Rio’s hands and placed it on the back of her head.</p><p>“<i>Mierda,</i>” Rio whimpered, wrapping their knuckles in the length of her locks, canting their hips subtly. “You’re so pretty like this, baby.”</p><p>If her mouth wasn’t busy, she would’ve responded, “<i>I’m aware.</i>” But as Rio’s cock tapped against the back of her throat, she had more important things to focus on. Namely, getting Rio to come. “Mmmm.” Came out instead, spit seeping out the corners of her mouth, beginning to drip down her chin. Her eyes softened as she noticed Rio’s face. Yes, they looked absolutely pathetic, but there was also some gratitude. It appeared as though they were trying to carve this moment into their brain, afraid it wouldn’t happen again. She would circle back to that, kind of hard to give reassurance while fake gagging on cock. Her fingers ran up, finding purchase on their stomach and scratching along their abs. Some light, some deep enough to leave red lines behind.</p><p>Rio was putty in her palms, essentially vibrating as their lids fluttered shut. That wouldn’t work. Agatha broke away, letting the strap fall from her mouth, licking her lips. “Uh, uh.” She snapped to get their attention, amber eyes coming back and out of focus. “Eyes on me, pretty boy. They close again and I stop. Got it?” She barked, vocal cords already raspy from friction.</p><p>Maybe Rio had gone too long with Agatha’s domineering, because that was a pretty benign request to make, and yet they still folded like they had back when she’d bend them over the nearest surface available. “Yes, <i>mistress.</i>”</p><p>Agatha smirked, a sense of pride swelling within her. Fuck, she had missed that. She had missed this. She had missed them. “You just wanna please me, don’t you?”</p><p>Rio eagerly nodded, mimicking a bobble head.</p><p>“Then come down my throat,” Agatha husked, turning her attention back to the task at hand. She took all 7.75 inches of the strap, the last .25 inches being reserved for her nose brushing against the happy trail that littered Rio’s lower abdomen. When they had first started dating, Rio actually felt self-conscious enough to shave it. Agatha banned razors for a while after that.</p><p>Rio’s gaze didn’t waver again, their chest rising and falling like the ocean's waves during a storm– choppy and clipped. Their hips became jumbled in their movements, their group tightening in her hair and pulling deliciously right at the root. She idly felt the snapping of the hair tie, her hair falling free, but as she thumbed over the base of the strap to force her wife over the edge, she couldn’t bring herself to care. ‘</p><p>“Oh my-” They moaned out, bucking erratically as they came, falling back onto the mattress. “¡Hostia puta!”</p><p>Agatha quickly stood, ignoring the cracking of her knees and hoping Rio was too blissed out to notice. She crawled up Rio’s body, one leg on either side of their hips as she straddled them. Agatha flipped her hair, smiling down at her wife. “Sweetheart? You okay?” It wasn’t asked out of worry, but arrogance.</p><p>“‘M okay,” Rio breathily answered, splayed out for Agatha’s enjoyment. And god, would she enjoy this.</p><p>She gave a delicate open palmed tap to Rio’s cheek, as if to say <i>atta boy.</i> “Do me a favor and stay just like that.”</p><p>“Wh-”</p><p>Agatha lined up the strap and sunk down onto it, groaning at the stretch. “<i>Finally.</i>” Rio shot out to try and hold onto her, but Agatha was faster, pinning their wrists to the bed as she rolled her hips. “I don’t think so, hon.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whined, but didn’t try to break free. She knew they wouldn’t, her wife loved being reduced down to nothing so long as it was by Agatha’s command. “Please.”</p><p>She victoriously bared her teeth as she began a rhythm, taking control. “Don’t be greedy, handsome. You know begging won’t get you anywhere.”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>“What are you right now, Rio?” Agatha lifted a single brow.</p><p>Her wife, as well trained as ever, responded without question. “A toy.”</p><p>She let go of one of Rio’s wrists, coiling her fingers around their neck instead. “That’s right,” Agatha praised. “Good to know you’re not completely inept after one orgasm.” The head of Rio’s cock was bumping up against her cervix in the sweetest agony, only pushing her to ride faster. “But whose toy are you? Who do you belong to, mi amor?”</p><p>“Quiero ser tuyo, soy tuyo,” They whimpered, eyes rolling back as she choked them tighter in reward. “Tu juguete.”</p><p>She lowered herself down, her lips grazing the shell of Rio’s ear. “Eres mía, mía para usar.” Agatha ground her hips down, delighting in the sound that Rio made in response. “<i>Mine.</i>”</p><p>“Yours. <i>Please,</i>” They begged anyway, looking pained. “Please let me touch.”</p><p>She supposed she made her point, and her wife seemed to be earnest enough. Agatha released her hold, sitting up and yanking Rio along by their hair, her nails scraping against the root and pulling. They immediately grappled onto her hips, matching her pace with their own. The bed shook, but at least she wouldn’t go through the mattress this time. Rio had doctored the bed over a decade ago with extra anchors and wood planks to make it…<i>sturdy</i> enough for their sex life.</p><p>Her wife’s mouth latched on to her nipple, rolling the nub between their teeth. “Greedy,” Agatha chided, but forced their face closer to her tits. The lewd sounds of Agatha riding them intermingled with the bed frame hitting the wall, meaning she’d definitely get a noise complaint from her neighbor later. But as Rio’s cock brutally fucked into her drooling pussy on each return, she considered it more than worth it.</p><p>“Mi ángel del cielo,” They whispered as they switched to her other breast, fingers gliding down lower to grope the flesh of her ass and yank her as close as possible. “Eres tan jodidamente perfecto.”</p><p>Her heart soared, her head lolling forward and into the crook of Rio’s shoulder. Agatha could really only hold on and scatter hickeys along her wife’s neck in retaliation. And if those marks made Agatha feel a sense of ownership, nobody could <i>prove</i> it. “Missed you so fucking much.”</p><p>That statement spurred Rio on, moving twice as hard. Her abs began to tense from trying to match the speed, tears brimming her eyes from the sheer force her wife was using. She felt lightheaded, that familiar build up of heat languidly licking through her stomach and nipping at her spine. “Mi alma, I’m close,” Rio muttered, raggedly thrusting.</p><p>Already?</p><p>Quite the ego boost, thank you very much.</p><p>“Clit,” Agatha ordered. “Wait for me.”</p><p>Rio released a frustrated whine, but did as told. They massaged her clit in tight circles, fumbling a bit to keep their hips going. It took maybe all of thirty seconds before she snapped like a rubber band, jerkily hunching forward and letting her weight go dead in Rio’s arms as she came. A broken, “My love!” tearing from her vocal cords, her wife shaking beneath her a fraction of a second later.</p><p>They rolled over after a beat, situating Agatha on her back. The strap had fallen out of her in the process but it was a small price to pay in order to actually properly <i>lay</i> on the bed. Her head was cradled by the pillow as Rio hovered over her, flushed and handsome, and so fucking happy.</p><p>Neither of them spoke, maybe their bond was just that strong, that they could communicate for once without fear. Agatha braced her hand against the headboard as Rio slung on one of her legs over their shoulders, driving their cock back in without resistance. She wasn’t sure how long they’d gone at it for, only cognizant of the final round. It was slower, more tender. With her hands cupping Rio’s face, her wife propped up on their elbow with their free hand delicately combing through her hair.</p><p>She shook as the wave took her under one more time, Rio coming too and collapsing on top of her. The weight felt good, it felt safe. Agatha let Rio stay buried in her neck as she played with the ends of their hair, adding in some scalp scratchies every now and then because she knew Rio loved it. They stayed there like that, intertwined for a long time after, sweaty and panting. It was nice, like something in her chest had <i>clicked</i> back into place.</p><p>When they finally detached from one another, they ran a bath. They assumed their usual positions, Rio behind Agatha with Agatha resting against them. The water was <i>scalding</i> per her request, which Rio was fine with (tolerated). It was so seamless, to have them back, to fall back into the same roles, to follow the same routine.</p><p>It felt suspiciously perfect.</p><p>Which made Agatha feel uneasy.</p><p>It was all too easy, right?</p><p>Something should’ve gone wrong by now. She’d become so accustomed to living in fight or flight mode, that her brain had to dissect something stupidly simple. They went to therapy, made amends, and had sex. But where was the catch?</p><p>Her wife stopped washing Agatha’s hair, soapy fingers resting on her shoulders. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing,” She dismissed, not looking back. Hold the fuck did they know?</p><p>“Your whole body just went stiff and you’re chewing your lower lip like you do when you’re lost in a thought,” Rio explained, trying to soothe her by rubbing her back, trying to unlock some knots and get her to relax again. “Do you regret showing your scar? You don’t have to ever again if you don’t want to, cariño.”</p><p>“It’s not that.” She shook her head, releasing her lower lip which she had, in fact, been chomping on. “Just…do you remember the day Nicky was born?”</p><p>Rio chuckled fondly. “How could I forget, she made herself known in this very tub.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha murmured. “I, uh, I used to think about that day a lot whenever I took a bath. You know, after Alex and the divorce.”</p><p>“Okay,” Her wife said, giving her space to continue.</p><p>“I think it was the only thing that stopped me from going through with it…when I would, um, hold myself under the surface,” Agatha woodenly laughed, something to cut the tension. “Couldn’t do it in the same spot that I went into labor. Something about birth and death, I don’t know.”</p><p>“Agatha-”</p><p>“Sorry, I don’t know why I brought that up,” She sniffled. “Not very sexy pillow talk.”</p><p>Rio’s arms wrapped around her, holding her. “You don’t need to apologize. And if you brought it up, it’s because you wanted to share it with me. It’s okay to talk about the bad things that happened.” Their voice broke as they continued. “There’s a lot of ground to cover.”</p><p>“I think I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Agatha said as hot tears spilled down her cheeks. “Like, I don’t want to enjoy anything too much because I’m afraid it’ll go away. I’m scared that I’ll push or you’ll bail.”</p><p>Rio held her a little tighter, resting their chin on her shoulder. “Both of us have actually been pretty good about doing neither of those things,” They reasoned, placing a quick kiss to her cheek. “Give yourself some more credit.”</p><p>“Aren’t you ever tired of consoling me?”</p><p>“Nope, not if you need to hear it.”</p><p>She peered back at her wife, trying to frown but ending up pouting. “Did you mean what you said?”</p><p>“When?”</p><p>“In bed.”</p><p>Rio laughed, smiling goofily. “You’ll have to be more specific.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, the corners of her mouth tugging upwards. “That you’re mine.”</p><p>“Baby, I never stopped being yours.”</p><p>A true statement. Even if Agatha had stopped being Rio’s, Rio had never ceased being Agatha’s. “I’d like it if that were a mutual thing…again.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“In an official sense, preferably.”</p><p>“What, like, you wanna be my <i>girlfriend?</i>”</p><p>“Under a few conditions…” She quickly added. “Because I can’t take this going south, I’m sure you couldn’t, and Nicky can’t either.”</p><p>“I agree,” Rio said, absentmindedly tracing her scar beneath the water.</p><p>“We unfortunately keep seeing Melina,” Agatha huffed. “I hate it but she seems to know her shit.”</p><p>“Fair.”</p><p>“No cohabitation, it’s too much too soon.”</p><p>“Also reasonable.”</p><p>“And,” Agatha sighed. “We don’t tell teddy until we have concrete plans for the future. We need time and if she knows, she’ll think everything will go back to how it used to be.” She loved her daughter more than the sun, the moon, and the stars, but she couldn’t take disappointing her again. There was no feasible way for her and Rio to just revert back to who they once were, they’d have to find a new normal.</p><p>“All of those conditions make sense to me,” Rio said. “And now you should <i>definitely</i> give yourself more credit, because Agatha from three months ago would never have been this open about what she needed.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha grumbled, relaxing and placing her head on Rio’s chest.</p><p>“But you wanna try?” They double checked.</p><p>“You can be my girlfriend or whatever…” She rushed out, attempting to be casual. “Or, wait, partner?”</p><p>“Meh,” Rio grimaced.</p><p>“Boyfriend?” She asked.</p><p>“You’d really use boyfriend?” Rio asked back in a startlingly small voice.</p><p>“If you want me to,” She answered easily. “You can be my hot dyke boyfriend.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“It’s allowed,” Agatha snorted. “I’ll use whatever you want me to use.”</p><p>“I’d like boyfriend,” They cautiously whispered.</p><p>“Done.” She looked up, kissing them longer than necessary.</p><p>When the bath had cooled, and they were both dressed and dry again, it was officially dark out. Agatha checked Nicky’s location, which was still safely at Kamala’s, before texting her to be home for dinner.</p><p>Half an hour later, their daughter walked into the kitchen, slinging her backpack onto the island and sitting on a stool. Rio was at the stove stirring some sauce while Agatha checked on the garlic bread. Her boyfriend had stolen one of her turtlenecks to wear so that their daughter would not be subjected to witnessing the multiple hickeys she had left.</p><p>Agatha closed the oven door, setting a timer. “How far did you guys get in Gilmore Girls?”</p><p>“Rory and Dean's first breakup,” Nicky said, pulling out a few notebooks and textbooks. “What’d you guys do all afternoon?”</p><p>“Grading.”</p><p>“Fixed the dishwasher.”</p><p>Both answered at the same time, alibis readily available and given to their thirteen year old.</p><p>“….cool.” Nicky furrowed her brows. “Mami, I’m glad you’re still here. Can you help me with this bio assignment?”</p><p>Rio put down the rubber spoon and turned down the heat on the stove top, wiping their hands and crossing the kitchen. “Of course, mi vida. What do we got?”</p><p>After homework and dinner, Nicky went up to her room, leaving Agatha to walk her boyfriend to the door. They stood on the porch, a single light illuminating their farewell, which was basically just a makeout session. She broke away from the kiss before forgetting to ask, “What are your plans for your birthday?”</p><p>“I hadn’t really thought about them yet,” Rio replied, still holding her by the waist. “Why?”</p><p>“Well, it falls on one of my weeks but if you want teddy, then we could work something out.”</p><p>“What if I want you <i>and</i> teddy?”</p><p>She blushed, pursing her lips and considering. “I think I could do something about that.”</p><p>Rio placed one last kiss on her lips. “Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p>She watched them trudge down the steps, calling back the same sentiment. “Goodnight.”</p><p>Rio winked back, reaching their car and getting in. Agatha stood on the porch, arms crossed as they pulled away from the curb. She stayed there for a minute, letting the breeze of the April night air calm her.</p><p>Or she <i>was</i> calm, until her neighbor opened his front door and looked over. “Hey, miss Agatha,” Herb smiled. “I thought I heard Rio was back. Gimme a heads up next time, I gotta dig my noise canceling headphones out from storage...haven’t needed them in a few years.”</p><p>“‘Night, <i>Herb,</i>” She hissed, opening her own door and muttering, “Nosy fucking neighbor.”</p>

<p><b>April, 2020.</b></p><p>“Agatha!” Jen’s voice rang out from the other side of the door, knuckles rapping yet again. “I know you’re home!”</p><p>Agatha sat on the top step of the staircase, watching Jen’s silhouette move through the window panel of the door. She hadn’t spoken to Jen since her three week post-op check up. The appointment located in the OBGYN wing of the hospital, the appointment that forced her to sit in a waiting room surrounded by pregnant women and small infants. The appointment where nurses and practitioners asked how her little one was doing. The appointment where Agatha was told she looked a bit tired, and if she needed resources on getting her newborn to sleep, they had them available. Did it not say in her chart that Alex didn’t make it? Did someone forget to add it? Did nobody read the fucking chart?</p><p>She hadn’t even glanced at Jen at the funeral, refused to acknowledge her mere existence. Agatha refused a lot these days– her most basic needs, amongst other things. Her sweatpants must’ve been a week old, which was actually a feat because her hair was going into double digits since days washed. The Red Sox hoodie on her frame was clean, though. Since the only person doing laundry or keeping the house running was Lilia. Agatha used the corner of her sleeve to catch a stray tear from the corner of her eye, sniffling and hoping her cheeks weren’t too sunken in.</p><p>“I have a key!” Jen insisted, jingling her keyring around. “Agatha-”</p><p>She stormed down the steps, prying open the door. “<i>What?!</i>” Agatha hissed, waiting as her best friend stood on her front porch, casserole dish in hand.</p><p>Jen reared back, her gaze morphing as she took in Agatha’s appearance. Hair tied up and greasy, lips dry and cracked, face hollowed, eyes drained of any emotion. “I- uh, I…”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, ignoring the judgement. “What do you want, Jen?”</p><p>“I just wanted to check in on you,” She offered, a weak and pitiful smile on her lips. “You were quiet at the funeral, and Rio said you’re having a hard time eating.” Jen raised the cookware in show. “Figured I could bring you something, maybe we could schedule your six week appointment.”</p><p>Agatha shut her eyes for a beat, clenching her jaw as she blinked back the tears already spilling. “Quiet? Gee, I wonder why I would be quiet at my own daughter’s funeral.”</p><p>“No, I didn’t mean-”</p><p>The depression had been bad, but nothing compared to the underlying current of rage she felt every minute of every day. “No, really,” Agatha harshly cut her off. “This is a head scratcher.” She cocked her head, shaking it. “What about my wife and best friend conspiring against my <i>one</i> wish would make me <i>so</i> fucking quiet?!”</p><p>“We didn’t-” Jen murmured, her posture deflating. “My hands were tied.”</p><p>“No, because I think I made myself pretty fucking clear!” Agatha yelled. “You <i>chose</i> to ignore me, you <i>chose</i> to take that from me! Alex is dead. My daughter is gone, and you come here with your <i>le creuset</i> dish and phony smile, and expect me to…? What did you think was going to happen?!”</p><p>“Okay,” Jen said, clearly hurt but trying to soothe Agatha. “I know it’s been hard, I get it. But, Agatha,” Her voice broke. “You’re my best friend and I’d never intentionally do something to hurt you or your family. Medically, I did my job-”</p><p>“I’m so fucking tired of that excuse!” Agatha roared, pointing her finger at Jen. “You and Rio need a better story as to why I woke up with my baby missing! You’re not god, you don’t get to tell me about <i>my</i> child!”</p><p>“Please, just let me in,” Jen softly replied. “We’ll book your appointment, I know some great postpartum psychiatrists and counselors. Even if you don’t want me around as a friend, let me help.”</p><p>“Jesus.” Agatha grabbed the dish, bitterly smiling before <i>slamming</i> it to the hardwood floors of her entryway. The food, which seemed to be some sort of mushroom ragu, along with thousands of shards of stone and ceramic hit the ground, splattering everywhere. “I’ll get a different doctor, you can go now.”</p><p>Jen’s eyes flickered to the mess then back to her. “Agatha, <i>I’m sorry.</i> You have to believe that I tried. I really, really tried. I kept her alive as long as I could, but it was a losing battle. Your body couldn’t sustain her any longer and Rio was in my head, and you hemorrhaged-” She explained through sporadic cries. “You have to recognize that, on some level, I had your best interest. I’m your daughter’s godmother, I delivered her. I was there when she wouldn’t sleep and when she was teething and wouldn’t stop wailing. She deserves to be raised by <i>both</i> of her moms.”</p><p>“No, no, you’re the reason I didn’t get to meet my daughter! You and Rio were against me keeping the pregnancy since the moment we found out about Alex!” Agatha didn’t need either of them to explicitly say <i>you should terminate</i> for her to know they were thinking it. She saw how Rio kept herself at a distance during her second pregnancy, how Jen kept telling Agatha that she had ‘options’. “I asked for <i>one thing</i>, and you took that from me.”</p><p>“You just said I’m not god!” Jen snapped. “I couldn’t save the both of you! It was never possible, you knew that! You knew the risks! And I’m <i>here</i>, because I’m really worried about you! We all are!” She blew out a short breath, motioning to the floor. “I’ll help get this cleaned up, we can look at those counselors I mentioned-”</p><p>“I’m not crazy,” Agatha growled. “I don’t need therapy, I don’t need you. Just go, Jen!”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>“Get <i>the fuck</i> out!”</p><p>Jen let out a sigh of defeat. “Can I call you later?”</p><p>She lazily shrugged. “I don’t care.”</p><p>“Will you pick up?”</p><p>“Guess there’s only one way to find out.”</p><p>Jen reluctantly nodded, sniffling. “Fine.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Talk later.”</p><p>“Can’t wait.” Agatha whipped the door closed, waiting as Jen shuffled away before dropping to the floor. The sobs hurt, but in a way she knew she deserved, like her chest was set on fire, her lungs burning for air.</p><p>She wasn’t crazy, she wasn’t. Agatha wasn’t crazy, she didn’t need help. She might’ve been the only person who was still affected by Alex’s death, but that was because nobody else understood. Nobody understood growing a child inside yourself, only for your own body to let you down. For your own body to betray you and <i>harm</i> the one thing a mother is never meant to harm– her own child. What kind of mother did it make Agatha that she couldn’t sustain Alex longer? What kind of wife was she to isolate herself from her marriage? What kind of daughter was she to make Lilia take care of her and the chores for months? What kind of friend was she to kick out Nicky’s godmother?</p><p>Agatha feebly crawled across the entryway, sucking back the snot as the streaks of saltwater ran down her face, down her throat. A shaky hand tried to collect the shards of cookware, her palms oozing sauce, or maybe blood from the sharp edges of the ceramic. She wouldn’t schedule that six week appointment, she was done with maternity wards and hospitals. The front door opened, Agatha shouting out a hoarse, “I said leave!”</p><p>“Sweetheart?” Lilia’s voice gently inquired, grocery bags being dropped as her mom crouched down. “Agatha? What’s wrong? What happened?”</p><p>She sat up, holding out her hands. It wasn’t the correct answer to the question, but it was the only one she had. “<i>My baby died.</i>”</p><p>“Mi tesoro.” Her mom tilted her head in sympathy, helping Agatha to her feet. “Okay, it’s okay, we’ll get this all fixed.”</p><p>That’s where her mom was wrong, there was no fixing Agatha, there was no fixing what was already rotten within her.</p><p>Later that night, Jen called like she said she would– Agatha blocked her number.</p><hr/><p>“I don’t have to take it,” Rio said, still curled up next to her in bed.</p><p>The past couple of weeks since becoming an official couple had been kind to Agatha, minus the head shrinking. Her weekly therapy routine now consisted of one solo session, one couples, and one family. Though, Tuesdays and Wednesdays had become blacked out as viable therapy days. Wednesdays because that was when Nicky had her therapy, and Tuesdays because that was when Nicky had piano– both of which Agatha and her boyfriend used as windows of time to fuck.</p><p>Dr. Vostkoff wasn’t shocked when they updated her on their progress, her one stipulation being that they continue seeing her. They usually ended family therapy with dinner at the house of whoever had custody of teddy that week, trying to very subtly get their daughter into a habit of seeing them both at the same time. Nicky didn’t seem to notice much, happily spending the time with both of her parents at the same time, a luxury to her. Lilia had been gracious enough to cart Nicky around on the days that Agatha reserved for Rio, taking Nicky out for dinner after or just driving like a woman her age would, just to give them more time.</p><p>There had been dates, but no sleepovers. Their daughter was always inconveniently in the care of one of them, and shipping her off every time Agatha had a date would be suspicious. Most date nights, she lied and told her daughter that she was grabbing drinks with other teachers from work. Rio’s go to lie was the gym, apparently? Leading to her boyfriend having to hastily change when they arrived at the house to pick Agatha up. The sneaking around wasn’t ideal, but it was the best either of them could do. And that led them both to today, naked and sprawled out in Rio’s bed at the loft while Nicky was at piano.</p><p>“Do you <i>want</i> to take the job?” Agatha asked, toying with the ends of her hair as her boyfriend’s fingers idly ran up and down her stomach.</p><p>“It’d be better hours,” they supplied. “Easier on my old and deteriorating body…”</p><p>“Yes, how does it feel to be nearing fifty?” Agatha quipped, playfully raising her brows as she grinned. “If you see a light, walk the other way, baby.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio chuckled. “Forty-six is not nearing fifty, that’s still mid-forties.”</p><p>“Whatever lie you need to tell yourself, handsome,” she murmured, then following up with, “Why are you asking me, anyway?”</p><p>“The practice is Jen’s.” Rio’s voice melted to something close to pity. “I didn’t want to do anything to jeopardize what we’ve got here.”</p><p>Agatha slowly exhaled, mulling over that statement. A few things caught her attention about it. How Rio was afraid that any challenge might spook her, how Jen had become Voldemort when spoken around her. The worst part being– Agatha had thought about her best friend far too often in the past six years, even more so in the past few months. Anti-depressants work wonders, because life could actually be bearable, enjoyable even.</p><p>“There’s a reason I never cut Jen off from you or teddy.” She flipped onto her side, fully facing her boyfriend. “It was just easier to push her away, and too hard to be around her after Alex. If you want the job, take it.” Logically, Agatha knew Jen still had regular contact with Rio, and sparse interactions with Nicky, she just chose not to think about it.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, lifting their hand to brush their thumb along her jaw. “Does that mean you’d be open to making amends with her?”</p><p>“Ugghhhhhhh,” Agatha groaned, sinking her face into the pillow. “Why does everything have to be discussed? Can everyone just chill the fuck out and be cool.”</p><p>“She’s entitled to some answers. She misses you, mi amor,” Her boyfriend chirped.</p><p>Agatha got up, throwing the sheets off. “Fine, I will reach out.” She bent down, grabbing her underwear and slipping them on. “It’ll be sappy and gay and I’m sure I will want nothing more than to walk into on-coming traffic.”</p><p>“Why are you getting dressed?” Rio pouted, sitting up and letting the covers expose their chest.</p><p>“It’s almost six, ma’s gonna be coming back here with teddy in, like, twenty minutes or less.” Agatha worked on her jeans and top, scouring the floor for her socks. “Is there a reason you didn’t bind today?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Agatha found her socks, putting them on and nodding towards her boyfriend’s tits. “No tape. You haven’t forgone that since the blistering. I’m just wondering if there was a reason.” Rio didn’t talk much about their presentation or what made them most comfortable, and it left Agatha searching for answers. Hell, Rio hadn’t even thought that the term ‘boyfriend’ was available to them. She wasn’t around when they started playing with their gender, Agatha was trying to play catch up.</p><p>“Oh, uh, I was just feeling kind of lazy this morning,” Rio muttered, awkwardly shifting in bed.</p><p>She crawled over, positioning herself in their lap so both her thighs were astride their hips. “I only ask to get a better understanding. Like you said, there’s a lot of ground to cover.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well, I’ve been working blind here.” She carded her fingers through their hair, providing some comfort for a line of questioning that Rio probably didn’t have the answers to. “Like, do you only see yourself taping for as long as you want, or would you consider surgery? Not that you need surgery to prove your gender or anything, but if that’s something you’d want, I’d want to do some research to keep informed. Do you still like when I use traditionally feminine terms, or do you want me to stick to stuff that's more masculine? Do you want me to touch your breasts when we have sex, or is that dysphoric for you?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened, then closed, then opened again. “You’ve really thought about all this, haven’t you?”</p><p>“And those are just my openers.”</p><p>“Can I get back to you…?”</p><p>“Of course.” Agatha kissed them, feeling the smile on their lips as she did. “I should go.”</p><p>“Doooon’t,” They whined, keeping her rooted in place.</p><p>“You’ll see me tomorrow.”</p><p>“That’s too long.”</p><p>“Something tells me you’ll live,” She snorted, finally dismounting and grabbing her shoes near the foot of the bed. “You should take that job.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“It’s a good gig for a family man.”</p><p>“A family man, huh?” Rio wiggled their eyebrows.</p><p>Agatha playfully flipped her hair. “You didn’t hear that.”</p><p>“I think I did!”</p><p>She waltzed across the room, pausing at the doorway and throwing back a wink. “See you tomorrow, baby.”</p><p>“I love you,” Rio called after.</p><p>“Get dressed! I love you!” She shouted as she ran down the stairs, grabbing her keys and bag off the island.</p><p>The next day, at work, Agatha found Kate during lunch. Life was better now, so fine, she’d actually start giving a shit. Additionally, if Kate happened to be an age appropriate match for a certain blond Russian that Agatha <i>definitely</i> didn’t feel threatened by, then what a coincidence.</p><p>She found the younger woman monitoring the lunchroom because Kate always volunteered to do nice shit like that, stuff that Agatha herself considered bait for suckers. “Hey, Bishop,” Agatha sweetly greeted, sidling up next to her. “How’s it going?”</p><p>Kate’s eyes bugged. “Did I do something wrong?”</p><p>“No, why do you ask?”</p><p>“You never ask me how I am,” Kate said, nervously playing with her lanyard. “Thought it might be a trap.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha pivoted, moving this along. “I’m just asking since I still owe you a wingman night.”</p><p>Kate squinted suspiciously. “Are you fucking with me?”</p><p>She let out a frustrated breath, tensing her jaw momentarily. “<i>No.</i>”</p><p>“You’ll seriously go out with me and be my wingman?”</p><p>Oh, and it pained her but, “Yes.”</p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha!” Kate grabbed her arm, jumping in excitement. “This is going to be so much fun! You can, like, show me all your tricks and-”</p><p>“Yeah. How does next Friday work?”</p><p>“Um, yeah. Yeah, that works,” She stammered out. “I’m <i>completely</i> free. I have nothing, ever, so that…”</p><p>Agatha raised a judgmental brow, a scowl absently forming.</p><p>She blew out a breath, suddenly trying to play it cool. “Yeah. I, uh- I could do that.” Kate awkwardly shot out some finger guns, slouching her shoulders. “Sounds good, bestie.”</p><p>“Don’t call me that.” Agatha cringed.</p><p>“Got it.”</p><p>“I’ll text you the time and place.” She  shuffled off, quickly calling back, “And bring a present, it’s my boyfriend’s birthday.”</p><p>“Okay, what does Rio like?”</p><p>“Bore someone else with your questions!”</p><p>Two dykey birds, one well aimed stone.</p><p>Once the work day was over, Agatha ran home, ignoring all of her responsibilities since Rio was supposed to come over soon. She threw her car into park in the driveway, doing a half-jog up the walkway steps. Agatha rifled through her keys, trying to find the right one-</p><p>She was too distracted to notice the other human waiting on her porch. “Hey.”</p><p><i>God damnit.</i></p><p>Agatha turned on her heel, coming face to face with her ex. “Wanda.”</p><p>The red head smiled, as put together as always. “You haven’t answered my calls…or texts.”</p><p>“That’s usually how it goes when somebody <i>blocks</i> you,” She hissed, jamming the key into the lock and turning it. “I suggest you leave.”</p><p>“Listen.” Wanda wedged herself between Agatha and the door, pleading her case. “I’m not here to rehash things, I just want my ring back and then you can run off into Rio’s toxic embrace.”</p><p>“<i>Puta.</i>” Agatha ground her teeth, harshly pushing past Wanda’s body.</p><p>“You look nice too.”</p><p>She attempted to close the door, but her ex was already through, eagerly following her inside. “Stay here, I’ll grab it.”</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda politely responded.</p><p>And since she didn’t trust Wanda in her home unsupervised, Agatha snatched the ring from her dresser and raced back downstairs as fast as her body would allow. She dropped the ring in Wanda’s palm, grimacing. “‘Kay, bye.”</p><p>Green eyes lingered on the ring before locking onto Agatha. “I’m, uh, sorry…for all the pain I caused you.”</p><p>She crossed her arms, protecting herself and keeping her distance. “Consider the slap apology enough.”</p><p>Wanda’s lips twisted, forcing a smile devoid of any joy. “Could you just tell me one thing?”</p><p>“I don’t owe you anything-”</p><p>“I’ll go right after you answer.”</p><p>“If you must,” Agatha snarled, raising her chin.</p><p>“Did you-” Her voice broke in a way that made it seem as though the emotion was genuine. “Did you ever <i>really</i> love me?”</p><p>“I thought you weren’t here to rehash things-”</p><p>“Just tell me the truth, what have we got to lose?”</p><p>Absolutely nothing.</p><p>“You were a distraction.” Agatha sighed, rubbing her temple. “You were my punishment that I…I thought I deserved."</p><p>“I was your keeper?” Wanda fragilely asked.</p><p>“I didn’t love you anymore than you loved me.”</p><p>“That’s not true, I <i>did</i> love you-”</p><p>“No, no you didn’t.” Agatha dropped her arms, placing her hands on her hips. “Wanda, I am generally prickly and unlikable. I’m someone who is hard to stomach. I am <i>a lot.</i> And even at my lowest, when I complied and gave in, you still saw me as difficult– something to fix.” She didn’t want to cry, so she wouldn’t, but the weight being lifted felt like the sweetest release. “You saw someone who would bend at your whim, you got me at my most vulnerable and exploited that for your own gain. If you thought you loved me, it’s because you loved the person you thought you made up in your head.”</p><p>“You’re making it sound like I abused you-”</p><p>“You sure as fuck weren’t <i>nice</i> to me,” Agatha interrupted. “You didn’t care about <i>me</i>, you cared about what I could give you. And if I’m being totally honest here, our whole relationship was like the blind leading the blind.”</p><p>“You’re twisting it,” Wanda scoffed. “I was there for you when you had no one. You didn’t have friends, your daughter hated you. I was there when nobody else wanted you, Agatha!"</p><p>“God, and I was so scared that you wouldn't be a raging cunt for once,” Agatha grumbled, cocking her head. “Good to know some things never change.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m just angry and hurt.” Wanda shoved the ring into her pocket, wiping her face of a few tears.</p><p>“I’ve lived enough life angry and hurt to know that if you keep pushing, people are going to stop coming back,” She said. “I’ve already slapped you once, so I won’t do it again. But come around me or my family again, and I promise I won’t hesitate to smack the dye job off your head.”</p><p>“This is my natural color-”</p><p>“I’ve seen the carpet, Wanda.”</p><p>Her ex slumped, giving a nod. “I would’ve given you a beautiful life.”</p><p>“I don’t doubt it.” Agatha shrugged. “I’m sure I would’ve spent every day in a Martha Stewart fever dream, but <i>it wouldn’t have been real.</i> It wouldn’t have been a life that any actual person lived. Real life is messy and ugly and tiring. It’s bickering over whose turn it is to take out the trash, and doing laundry, and managing mortgage payments, and someone holding your hair back while you upchuck. It’s finding a person that makes that shit bearable."</p><p>“And, for you, that’s Rio?”</p><p>That was an easy answer. “Yeah.”</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m 35 and starting all over again.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, becoming even more irritated. “Jesus fuck, woman. Propose to Monica and fuck off to the suburbs if it gets your dick that hard.”</p><p>Wanda laughed a little too woodenly. “Oh, I can’t. She’s married.”</p><p>“You really have issues,” Agatha murmured. “Get therapy, have a kid on your own if your uterus yearns for motherhood so much.”</p><p>“By myself?”</p><p>“Get a sperm donor or surrogate, adopt. Hell, you’re still attracted to men for whatever reason, do it the old fashioned way and raise the little bastard on your own. Either way, buck the fuck up and stop using relationships to fix all the broken pieces of you, buttercup.” Agatha disingenuously pouted. “And leave my house.”</p><p>“Yep,” Wanda whispered, turning the knob and opening the door.</p><p>The other side revealed Rio, fist raised and mid-knock, face falling as Wanda’s presence was registered. “What the f-”</p><p>“I was just leaving!” Wanda carefully raised her hands in surrender, brushing past her boyfriend. “And, um, sorry for the <i>comment</i> I made.”</p><p>“You mean the racism?” Rio growled, staring her down.</p><p>“Yes, that. I promise, I didn't mean it, I voted for Kamala.”</p><p>“Okay, time to go.” Agatha waved her off, pulling her boyfriend into the house, slamming the door behind them. “Thank god, I thought she was going to keep <i>yapping</i> at me,” She chuckled, noticing that Rio wasn’t.</p><p>“Why was she here?”</p><p>“She wanted her ring back.”</p><p>“And that required her coming inside?” Rio’s body was tensed, hands balled into fists at their sides.</p><p>“Nothing happened, if that’s what you’re implying.” She quirked her eyebrow.</p><p>“I just…I don’t like her.”</p><p>“Yeah, me neither,” She deadpanned, sliding her arms over her boyfriend’s shoulders. “Are you jealous?”</p><p>Rio’s throat bobbed, like they were trying to decide if they were going to let the words out. “No, we weren’t together so I have no right to be.”</p><p>“You suck at lying,” Agatha purred. “Dr. Vostkoff would not like our communication right now.”</p><p>Rio grinned, resting their hands on her hips and delivering a quick smack to her ass they said, “Smartass.”</p><p>“You’re fond of my smart ass,” Agatha quipped. “It’s okay if you <i>are</i> jealous, or even mad…”</p><p>“I don’t like thinking that she was in our bed doing the things we did in said bed.”</p><p>“If it eases your mind, she didn’t do those things well.”</p><p>“I <i>hate</i> that she got any part of you,” Rio replied a little softer. “And I hate that she wasn’t the only one. And I hate that we’ll never get back the time we spent apart.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t in the position to dismiss Rio’s fears considering how she reacted about hypothetical women she thought Rio was finding off of Tinder. But, she could make this fun. “We’ve got plenty of time to make up for that, and I might even know a few ways to make you forget about anyone else.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>Agatha tugged Rio towards the stairs, leading them into the bedroom and having them sit on the bed. She reached under the bed frame, pulling out the sex box and flourishing her hand over it. “Voilá.”</p><p>“If you’re asking me to strap you, that isn’t a surprise, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha hauled the box onto the mattress, climbing up and sitting next to her boyfriend. “No. Well, yeah. But we haven’t played since being back together, and it could provide you that sense of ownership that I know you’re craving.”</p><p>“You’re offering to sub for me?” Rio checked, splaying their fingers over her thigh. “Like the old days?”</p><p>“Could be fun, right?” Agatha whispered. “It’s been a while, but I trust you. I know you’ll take care of me.”</p><p>“Thank you,” they said, sincerely touched by that sentiment. “We can’t do a whole scene today…”</p><p>“No, but we could start off light, nothing too intense,” Agatha opened the box, rifling through its contents. “Although, if you wanted me to plan something more intricate for your birthday, I could.”</p><p>Rio gulped, pupils eating away the amber of their irises. “Could you dom…for that?”</p><p>“You want me to dominate you for your birthday?”</p><p>Their jaw went slack, shallowly breathing at the idea. “Yes, please.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Close your mouth, sweetheart. You’re the one in charge right now.”</p><p>Rio cleared their throat, switching gears. “Should we go over things first?”</p><p>“Why? We’ve done it all before.”</p><p>“It would just make me more comfortable to talk about any boundaries or limits that have changed, it’s been a while.”</p><p>“Always the gentleman,” Agatha muttered. “Fine.”</p><p>“Great.” Rio worked off their jean jacket, flinging it into the corner. They were wearing a muscle tank beneath it and Agatha couldn’t stop her eyes from staring as their biceps bulged.</p><p>“Have you seriously been going to the gym?”</p><p>Was she drooling?</p><p>“Oh.” They peered at their own arms. “Yeah, a little bit.”</p><p>It felt like she was drooling.</p><p>She bit her lower lip. “Nice.”</p><p>“So, same safeword?”</p><p>Agatha snickered, “Clover.” It had stemmed from the song playing in the bar when they had first met and just kind of stuck– <i>Crimson &amp; Clover.</i> Although, she hadn’t remembered a time where either of them actually had to call it, which was ultimately the goal. “Works for me.”</p><p>“Um, are the same kinks still okay?” Rio lightly pried, obviously fishing about one in particular.</p><p>“Which one are you asking about, my love?”</p><p>“The usual ones; bondage, impact play, breath play, overstimulation, edging, degradation, praise…or-” They averted eye contact for a beat, quietly adding, “Breeding.”</p><p>The brick just bashed against her skull made her buffer for a second. “Maybe not <i>that</i> one.”</p><p>“I assumed as much, I just wanted to cover all my bases.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hand, fidgeting with the ring on her middle finger. “I get it.”</p><p>Her boyfriend laid their hand atop hers, stopping the fidgeting. “I’m sorry-”</p><p>“I said I get it,” Agatha evenly repeated.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to…I don’t know how to approach that topic yet.”</p><p>Yeah, neither did she.</p><p>“It happened,” she declared. “We’ll get better about it.”</p><p>“We don’t have to do this today, we can just be together,” Rio offered. “We can watch a movie or hang out in the garden.”</p><p>It was a kind offer, but Agatha thought more of herself by now, the coddling wasn’t necessary. Not because she thought she deserved to suffer, but because she didn’t really need it. There were no pieces of her to collect and glue back together, it hurt, but it wasn’t the end of her world.</p><p>“We’re past that point,” Agatha gently said. “And, I don’t know, I was kind of excited to be dominated.”</p><p>Rio smiled in relief. “Still green on impact play?”</p><p>The corners of her lips perked up, languidly shifting over to straddle her boyfriend. “If I ever say no to that, take me out back and pull an Old Yeller.”</p><p>“Mi alma, I like you alive.”</p><p>“So we’ve established.” She pushed Rio flat on their back. “Now prove it.”</p>

<p>“It’s just <i>so</i> weird…” Nicky murmured at the dining table.</p><p>Their wife came back in, cake in her hands. “I know baby, but it’s mandatory.”</p><p>Nicky tilted her head in curiosity. “None of my teachers have a conference in Salem this weekend.”</p><p>That’s because they were lying right to their daughter’s face about why she had to stay at Kamala’s this weekend. Rio’s birthday fell on a Friday, so the whole family took the day off to celebrate. However, tonight Rio was going out with Agatha. The plan was to have the whole weekend together at the loft, then Agatha would take off before Nicky would be dropped off to spend her week with Rio. Super convoluted, but they promised not to tell Nicky before Agatha was ready, so they wouldn’t.</p><p>“It’s a good sign,” Rio smiled. “Means the state education budget hasn't been slashed to bits yet.”</p><p>“Okay,” Their girlfriend declared, setting the cake on the table. “We’ll sing then presents?”</p><p>Lilia raised her glass of wine, motioning to the cake. “Did you make that yourself, sweetheart?”</p><p>Agatha proudly nodded. “Red velvet with cinnamon cream cheese frosting because Rio is a psychopath.”</p><p>They couldn’t even pretend to be offended. For the first time in seven or eight years, their wife (girlfriend) had made them their favorite cake from scratch. While Rio was a pretty good cook, baking was not their forte. Agatha was the opposite, she just threw shit in a mixing bowl and it always worked out. She used to bring the nurses at the hospital these homemade cookies, and they’d always ask Rio when Agatha was visiting again just so they’d get more of her baked goods.</p><p>Rio adjusted the chin string of the birthday hat Nicky had stuck on them when they first arrived at the townhouse, their cheeks flushing. “It’s the best.”</p><p>“No, you’re a psychopath,” Nicky snickered.</p><p>They widened their eyes in alarm. “Better hope it’s not genetic…”</p><p>Agatha stuck a huge <i>4</i> and <i>6</i> into the center of the beautifully decorated cake, striking a match and lighting the candles. “You’re both insane, why do you think we’re in therapy?”</p><p>“Pot, kettle.” Their daughter raised her brows.</p><p>“Now now,” Their girlfriend tutted. “Let’s not get into who has what mental illness on your mami’s special day.” Agatha pushed the cake to sit right in front of them. “Alright, birthday boy-”</p><p>The room went static, Rio zoning out as their family sang <i>Happy Birthday.</i> A fairly harmless pet name, especially since Agatha had said it in front of their child, but their brain’s reaction to it was decidedly <i>not</i> harmless. It itched a scratch inside of them. There was an unspoken lead up to tonight. Rio tried not to act too overeager, because that’d be lame. But, the prospect of Agatha railing them after so many years was their dream come true. Agatha had assured Rio that she’d tell them what she had planned before anything actually happened, but they might’ve spent the last week <i>retraining</i> themself in preparation just in case. Anal sex, however much they loved it, was not something they could do on the fly. Hence, why Rio hadn’t gotten their back blown out in the time since their split. Their imagination had run wild with possibilities of tonight; what Agatha would wear, how mean she’d be, what she would do to Rio…</p><p>“Mami.”</p><p>Oh fuck, maybe she’d collar them.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Or tie them up, restrain them.</p><p>“Hon?”</p><p>God, they hoped slapping was on the table.</p><p>Nicky leaned over the table, waving her hand erratically. “Mami!”</p><p>Rio blinked a few times. “Hmm?”</p><p>“Your candles…” Agatha prompted.</p><p>They looked around the table, the other three staring and waiting. “...Oh!” They blew out the candles, having missed their cue while thinking about tonight. “Thanks for making this.” Rio peeked over at their girlfriend.</p><p>“It was nothing,” She dismissed. “I’ll cut the cake. Teddy, you wanna go first?”</p><p>Nicky grinned, grabbing a small rectangular box wrapped in dinosaur paper, a tiny bow on top. “Happy birthday.”</p><p>Rio took it, trying to smother the cheesy grin they had playing on their lips. They opened the box, dark green woven yarn coming into their vision. Rio pulled it out, inspecting the scarf. “This is beautiful, mi vida.”</p><p>“I’ve been learning how to crochet, mama helped me.”</p><p>“You <i>made</i> this?”</p><p>“Do you like it?”</p><p>“I <i>love</i> it.” Rio clutched it to their chest. “I can wear it with the beanie your mom knitted me.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes lifted from her task, her hands pausing. “You still have that?”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>“It’s almost twenty years old…”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Still works.”</p><p>“My turn!” Lilia shoved a small gift bag their way. “Maybe don’t show it off, though.”</p><p>They rifled through the tissue paper as Agatha slid them a plate with a piece of cake. Rio tucked their tongue against their cheek once a few edibles and a couple of joints came into view. “I can buy my own weed, Lilia.”</p><p>“A mother never lets their child buy their own weed,” Lilia said, then looking at Nicky. “Pull that card on them once you turn eighteen.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio chuckled, assuming that was the end of the gifts.</p><p>Agatha made sure everyone had a slice before running to the den and back, a <i>huge</i>  block wrapped up in the same paper as Nicky’s present. “Heavy as shit,” Their girlfriend muttered, plopping it on the table. “Happy birthday.”</p><p>They cautiously picked it up, “Jesus.” And delicately tore the paper, a leather-bound book beneath. “Agatha, this is…”</p><p>“Perfect?” Agatha smirked.</p><p>“A lot.” They opened the cover, hearing the <i>squeak</i> of the spine. “Is this a first edition?” Specifically, a first edition of <i>Zoology of New York Fauna Part II Birds by James E. de Kay.</i> Rio had a habit of collecting rare works of biology or zoology, too many to count, actually. Agatha never minded since her own book collection was about thrice the size of Rio’s, it was why the living room was completely encased by shelves that Rio had anchored themself.</p><p>“From 1844,” She added, biting her lip in anticipation. “You like?”</p><p>“Bab-” Rio cleared their throat, faking a cough because Nicky was here and they forgot that for a second. “It’s too much, this must’ve cost a fortune.”</p><p>“It’s fine, I used your child support payment,” Agatha winked. “Try your cake.”</p><p>“Agatha, you really didn’t-”</p><p>“Eat.”</p><p>Rio set down the book, picking up their fork and taking a bite. “Mmmmh,” they honest to god moaned.</p><p>Their girlfriend kicked them beneath the table, shooting Rio a warning look. “<i>Good?</i>”</p><p>Nicky cocked her head as Lilia stifled a cackle with a sip of wine.</p><p>Rio swallowed, hoping the blush now reaching their ears wasn’t noticeable. “Delicious.”</p><p>When everyone was done, they helped Agatha clear the plates, following her back into the kitchen as she put away the leftover cake. Rio dropped the dishes in the sink, watching as Agatha got some frosting on her thumb. They didn’t think, apparently they were incapable of it. Rio shot out, quickly taking their girlfriend’s thumb into their mouth and sucking off the frosting.</p><p>Agatha’s pupils dilated, her thumb pressing down a bit to open their jaw. She lowly chuckled as Rio’s gaze locked onto hers, her thumb then sliding out before running along their bottom lip. “You’re practically in heat.”</p><p>“You called me the birthday boy,” Rio absently explained. “The birthday boy has needs.”</p><p>“I think the birthday boy is a greedy little slut who wants to be bent over.” She took her thumb back, pushing them aside to rinse the dishes. “Wants are not needs, hon.”</p><p>“What if I feel like I’ll die without it?”</p><p>“You’ve gone this long without my cock, what’s another few hours?” Agatha nodded to the dishwasher. “Open it.”</p><p>Rio obeyed, taking the dishes as they were rinsed and loading them up. “I’ve been thinking about those questions you asked.”</p><p>“Oh?” She quirked a brow, handing off another plate. “Do tell.”</p><p>Rio closed the dishwasher, running it before they forgot. “I still like the feminine pet names.” They’d given her questions a lot of thought, not having considered some of them until Agatha brought them up. It made Rio think about how they saw themself, which they had spent much of their life avoiding. “When they come from you, I know it’s out of a place of love, not because you see me as a woman.”</p><p>“Okaaay,” Agatha slowly agreed. “But what about degrading terms? Slut? Whore? Bitch? They’re slurs specifically for women, and though I’ve used those to degrade you in the past-”</p><p>“I can be a whore or slut regardless of gender,” Rio quickly cut in. “All of those terms work for me.”</p><p>“Are you gonna make it to tonight or should I worry that you’ll start humping my leg?”</p><p>They grinned sweetly, crossing their arms. “Would you let me?”</p><p>Agatha snapped a dish rag at them, snort-laughing. How they’d missed that sound. “What about the other stuff?”</p><p>“I like nipple play,” They said. “I don’t necessarily feel dysphoric when you touch my tits, or for <i>having</i> tits. It’s different for everyone, but the taping just makes me feel more…myself. I personally don’t resent my sex, more so how my sex automatically makes others correlate me to a default gender. I don’t think I’d get the surgery, it’s not like I have all that much to remove to begin with. Also, it reduces nipple sensitivity, and that does <i>not</i> work for me.”</p><p>Agatha stared at them for a beat, her lips softly curling upwards.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>She gently shook her head. “I’m…<i>really</i> happy you’ve gotten to this point.”</p><p>“Me too,” Rio delicately responded. “I’ve even been looking at, uh, more stuff.”</p><p>“Like?”</p><p>“Like, things that would be more affirming.” Rio peeked down at their hands, suddenly nervous. “I’ve always liked packing, there's better versions that I could try.”</p><p>Agatha smirked like a cat who was hiding a mouse in her mouth. “Hot.”</p><p>“I’m not committing to anything yet,” Rio breathed out. “I’m just exploring.”</p><p>“That’s okay too.” Agatha leaned in close, checking to make sure the coast was clear before grabbing their hips. She closed the gap, full lips pressing against Rio’s in an entirely innocent kiss.</p><p>Rio threaded their fingers through Agatha’s hair, angling their head to kiss her deeper. There was something so easy about sliding their tongue against their wife’s in their own home, in their own kitchen. Rio’s heart hadn’t stopped aching, and not out of pain for the first time in years, but in gratitude. Agatha pushed them up against the counter, catching their bottom lip with her teeth and-</p><p>“Nonna’s doing tarot readings!” Nicky bellowed out, her footsteps rapidly approaching.</p><p>Agatha broke away, flinging herself in the opposite direction to lean against the island, wiping her lips to remove any spit. Rio righted themself, doing the same and smiling when their daughter appeared.</p><p>Nicky used the momentum of her socks against the hardwood to glide right in, beaming, “You guys in?”</p><p>“Why not,” Agatha husked, clearing her throat.</p><p>“Yeah, uh…yeah.” Rio followed Nicky out of the kitchen, shooting their girlfriend a look.</p><p>They all sat in the den as Lilia overtook their coffee table, shuffling her decades old tarot deck. “Who’s first?”</p><p>“I’ll go,” Agatha sighed. “It’s all just bullshit anyway.”</p><p>Lilia rolled her eyes. “And you call yourself <i>my</i> daughter…”</p><p>“Meh meh meh,” Agatha mumbled mockingly. “Shuffle that shit, let’s go, lady.”</p><p>“General reading?” Lilia asked.</p><p>She shrugged. “Why the fuck not.”</p><p>“Pick.” Lilia extended the deck, waiting as Agatha picked three. She set the rest aside, laying out the three and turning over the first one. “Your past. Three of swords; heartbreak, sorrow, grief. Representing deep emotional pain, often bears themes of resilience. Growth through pain, and you’re stronger for it.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha started to get up. “Think that calls it for me-”</p><p>Nicky pulled her back down onto the couch. “Just wait, I wanna see!”</p><p>Lilia turned over the second card. “Your present. The lovers; deep soul bond, true partnership, unconditional love. Alone, it can signify committing to one’s true self. Harmony between the head and the heart.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Yeah, and then rainbows shoot out of my ass-”</p><p>“Your future." Lilia smacked the card down. “Four of wands; harmony, homecoming, and new milestones. Celebration after hard work, often depicted by a wedding.”</p><p>Rio cocked their head, inconspicuously trying to explode their mother-in-law with their mind. They glared at Lilia and silently mouthed, “Subtle.”</p><p>“They’re <i>your</i> cards, I just read them,” Lilia told her daughter. “What about you, birthday boy? You want in?”</p><p>“Pass,” Rio dryly answered.</p><p>“I’ll go,” Their daughter chirped.</p><p>After more tarot, Lilia said her farewells, Nicky getting picked up by Kamala’s parents not too long after. Rio was walked to the front door, presents in hand as their girlfriend added two more wrapped rectangles on top of the book. She smirked, kissing their cheek and telling them to wear both tonight. Rio wanted to interrogate her about what the mystery boxes held, but knew better than to try and get a straight answer out of Agatha.</p><p>Once home, Rio opened the gifts–</p><p>A plug and a packer…right. Was Agatha some kind of witch, how the fuck did she have a packer ready to go? Did she just innately know them that well? It wasn’t overly realistic, thank god, Rio realized as they pried open the packaging. Agatha included a pair of briefs with a pocket at the front where the packer could be stored, and there was a rod in the box that could be inserted into the length of the packer to make it erect. Ah, a pack n’ play.</p><p>Rio bit their lip briefly in thought. If they were wearing the packer, were they the one doing the strapping? But she also gave them a butt plug, so that would insinuate that <i>she</i> would do the strapping…who the <i>hell</i> was getting fucked tonight? And why did Rio feel a bit disappointed at the prospect that it might not be them? Not that fucking Agatha was ever a bad thing, it was quite literally one of Rio’s most favorite things ever. But it left them wondering what the fuck their wife had planned.</p><p>Several hours later, a knock echoed into the loft, Rio opening their front door to Agatha with an overnight bag. Neither of them had drawers at the other’s place out of caution that Nicky might stumble upon it, but they wouldn’t mind if they did have personal effects littered along each other’s lives. Their jaw dropped as their eyes roamed over Agatha’s figure. Red dress, matching lipstick, black heels, hair long and untamed. If the dick in their pants was real, Rio was sure they’d have to lie about pocketing a roll of quarters.</p><p>Agatha threw the bag over the threshold of the door, batting her eyelashes. “Ready?”</p><p>“You, um, you look…<i>woah.</i>” Rio’s mouth felt like cotton, they couldn’t think of the last time they’d seen Agatha in a dress. Maybe Nicky’s 13th birthday party?</p><p>“You don’t look too bad yourself, hot stuff.”</p><p>Rio wore an oversized, boxy button up French-tucked into some tailored slacks, a slender gold chain sitting at the hollow of their throat with their hair tied back. They felt good, confident in their own skin. Admittedly, the packer did give them more peace of mind. They grabbed their leather jacket, fumbling with their keys and locking the door behind them. “You don’t have a coat?”</p><p>“Don’t need it.” Agatha intertwined her fingers with theirs as they got into the elevator.</p><p>“<i>Sure,</i>” Rio mumbled, rolling their eyes.</p><p>They should’ve guessed that Agatha was taking them to Emmet’s, the sentimental softie that she was. As they approached the bar though, it didn’t look open, the interior was dark and suspiciously quiet for a Friday night. Their girlfriend didn’t break her stride as she approached the door, keeping a grip on Rio’s hand as she did so.</p><p>“Agatha, we might have to go somewhere else…” They said, watching as she jiggled the nob. “Or we could just go back to my place and-” She yanked them along as she burst through the entrance, the lights all flickering on at once.</p><p>“<i>SURPISE!</i>” About a thousand people all crammed into the bar screamed, music suddenly blasting.</p><p>“Jesus- Fuck!” Rio clutched their chest, placing a protective arm over Agatha.</p><p>Their girlfriend cackled, batting their bicep down. “Relax, hon.”</p><p>Their eyes focused, scanning the room and finding most of their friends and colleagues from the hospital– notably Yelena, Alice, and <i>Jen.</i> There were streamers and balloons everywhere, booze flowing, a mountain of presents in the far corner.</p><p>“What?” Was all Rio could say.</p><p>“Happy birthday, my love.” Agatha leaned over to whisper in their ear. “Thought we’d live it up this year.”</p><p>Rio turned their head slightly, whispering back, “Is that why I’m both packing and plugged in front of our closest friends?”</p><p>“Thought you’d like that,” She snorted, quickly smacking their ass. “Go mingle, I’m kinda working an angle right now.”</p><p>“What are you conspiring to do, mi amor?”</p><p>Agatha nodded her head towards Kate at the bar. “I got an obligation.”</p><p>“You double booked me?”</p><p>“I’ll be done in about five minutes.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, walking to meet up with Yelena, Alice, and Jen. They kept an eye on Agatha, watching as she talked to Kate and pointed over to where they stood.</p><p>They were greeted by a chorus of “Happy birthday” from the three women, Yelena handing them a beer which Rio would nurse for the rest of the night. They couldn’t play if they were tipsy. But more important than that, Agatha and Jen were in the same room for the first time in six years. Rio raised their brows at Jen, a silent question following.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Jen shrugged, a drink in her hand. “She reached out to Alice, told her that we were both invited. I even checked our old texts and she unblocked me.”</p><p>“Really?!” Rio tried not to scream out of shock. “She didn’t even mention it to me.”</p><p>“I thanked her for unblocking me and she said we should get coffee soon…” Jen explained. “Just out of the fucking blue.”</p><p>It wasn’t out of the blue, but Rio wasn’t going to go through all of that at this current moment, Agatha could explain that for herself later on. “I’m happy to hear it.”</p><p>“You and me both,” Alice chimed in, pointing to Jen. “She needs an outlet. I think she missed having someone to lovingly antagonize.”</p><p>“You say that like I don’t antagonize you.” Jen slid an arm around her wife’s waist.</p><p>Alice grinned. “That’s different, that’s foreplay-”</p><p>“Surgeon?” Kate appeared behind Yelena, nervously smiling.</p><p>Rio tucked their tongue against their cheek, making eyes at Agatha leaning against the bar and looking like a proud mom.</p><p>Yelena turned around, choking the glass in her grip. “How did you know?”</p><p>Rio pursed their lips, patting Yelena’s shoulder as they left. “I’ll leave you kids to it…” They crossed the bar, placing their beer bottle down and laughing under their breath. “Surgeon, huh?”</p><p>“100% success rate,” Agatha said mischievously. “They’ll be fucking in the bathroom by the end of the night.”</p><p>“Speaking of…” Rio’s gaze raked over her.</p><p>“We <i>just</i> got here,” Agatha scolded, fitting her index fingers through the belt loops on their trousers. “You’re that desperate for it?”</p><p>“It’s your fucking body in that dress, cariño.” They ran their fingers over the swell of Agatha’s hip, the fabric clinging to her frame. “Shouldn’t the birthday boy get a treat?”</p><p>Their wife rolled her eyes, sighing.</p><p>No more than two minutes later was Rio on their knees as their face was wonderfully suffocated by Agatha’s thighs. She was spread atop the sink, dress rucked up to bunch around her hips while her hand pushed them further down. They didn’t really need the encouragement, but the way Agatha’s hips bucked up to essentially grind on their tongue was a nice touch.</p><p>Agatha’s head lolled black against the mirror, her free hand clapped over her face so the other patrons of the bar wouldn’t hear her reaction as Rio used their nose as friction on her clit. Rio would absolutely consider their wife coming on their tongue as a treat, the second orgasm accompanying as more of a five course meal. Agatha had to wrench their mouth away, their sights unfocused as the cold air hit their face. She pulled them up to stand, clashing their lips together in a filthy kiss, dripping with Agatha’s arousal.</p><p>Her hand snaked down to cup Rio’s bulge through their pants, husking out, “Good boy.”</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha.” The air expelled from their lungs, a hunger gnawing at their gut. “We need to go.”</p><p>“You can last an hour.” She hopped down from the counter, using her thumb to clean their face. “We don't want to be rude, do we?”</p><p>Yes, yes, they did. They wanted to be so rude to all the people who had been gracious enough to celebrate Rio’s birthday. They were actually ready to send everyone home in the name of getting laid. “Baby-”</p><p>Her heels ricocheted off the tiled floor as she waltzed over to the door after fixing her skirt. “One hour.”</p><p>“Agatha.” They caught her wrist. “<i>Please.</i>”</p><p>“C’mon, you love it.” Agatha quickly kissed them, whispering against their lips. “The anticipation.”</p><p>They stayed for another hour, begrudgingly. Rio opened presents and made polite conversation as needed, their girlfriend nudging them and pointing to Yelena and Kate cozied up in a dimly lit corner. “I give it ten minutes before they maul each other.”</p><p>Rio shook their head, licking their lips which still tasted like Agatha. “Neither of them have the balls to initiate.”</p><p>“Fifty bucks says Kate kisses her before we leave.”</p><p>“I’ll take that action.” Rio looked at their watch. “She’s got thirteen minutes.”</p><p>“You’re seriously keeping time?”</p><p>“You said an ‘hour’ forty-seven minutes ago, so in thirteen minutes I’m throwing you over my shoulder and taking you home.”</p><p>“Mmh, that plug got you a little <i>pent up</i>, baby?”</p><p>“You’re enjoying my suffering too much.”</p><p>“Can you blame me?”</p><p>“I-” Rio stopped speaking as they saw movement out of the corner of their eye. “Oh.”</p><p>“Wow, two minutes.” Agatha turned her head, hitting their arm in excitement as Kate leaned in and, well…mauled Rio’s resident. “Pony up!”</p><p>“Does this mean we can go?”</p><p>Their girlfriend shrugged. “I suppose-”</p><p>Rio began tugging Agatha along, saying goodbye to everyone and swiping their jacket on the way out. The sun had firmly set, leaving the night chilly and dark. Rio immediately placed the jacket over Agatha's exposed shoulders, holding her hand as they waited for the Uber back to the loft.</p><p>Rio squirmed in their seat the entire car ride, hoping and praying that Agatha wouldn’t tease them when they got home. They basically dragged her down the hall of their building, unlocking the door and slamming it shut. Rio didn’t let go of Agatha though, they simply scooped up her overnight bag on the way upstairs to the bedroom, ignoring their wife’s smug comments about how needy they were. Yes, they were needy, but they hadn’t had this in <i>so</i> long, and they had missed Agatha’s dominance.</p><p>As soon as they reached the bedroom, Rio hurled the bag down, turning around and dropping to their knees. They tilted their head up, staring as Agatha gingerly took off their jacket. She stepped around them, flopping down onto the bed without a word. Rio deflated, okay, maybe they were the one doing the fucking tonight–</p><p>Agatha snapped twice, pointing to the floor in front of her. “Come.”</p><p>Fuck, yes. Rio crawled over, eyes trained on Agatha for the next command.</p><p>Her smile was uncharacteristically warm for the circumstance as she ordered, “Take off your shirt.”</p><p>Rio didn’t take the time to unbutton it, simply yanking until buttons popped and clattered to the floor, the garment sliding off their body and leaving them in a tank top. Agatha’s foot slowly extended, the tip of her stiletto grazing the bulge of the packer. Rio’s hand laid limp by their sides, patiently remaining in a standing kneel as blue eyes sparkled almost demonically.</p><p>Agatha raised her leg higher, the heel catching on the hem of their tank briefly to expose their abs. “What do I do with you?”</p><p>Their jack went slack as the heel settled on their sternum, the sole of the shoe now pressed against their collarbone. Rio couldn’t think, Agatha hadn’t even begun and they could already feel how wet they were. “Whatever you want.”</p><p>“What do <i>you</i> want?”</p><p>That felt like a trap, because they were pretty fucking clear on what they wanted. “Um…”</p><p>“Say it, handsome.” Agatha dug her heel in, a sharp and delicious pain scraping against Rio’s skin.</p><p>“Please, Agatha-”</p><p>She pressed harder, jutting the heel up slightly to leave a mark behind. “Uh uh, wrong name.”</p><p>They hissed at the pain, but didn’t dare touch without permission. “Please, <i>mistress</i>. Please, fuck me.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her leg back, studying them for a minute. “Color?”</p><p>“Green. So, so, green.”</p><p>“Safeword?”</p><p>“Clover,” Rio rushed out. “Please, please-”</p><p>“Stop begging.” Agatha’s voice was sharp as she then commanded, “Take ‘em off.”</p><p>Rio obediently undid the ankle straps of their wife’s heels, setting them to the side.</p><p>“Bag,” Agatha barked, working off the spaghetti straps of her dress. Rio craned their body over a bit, presenting the duffel at her feet. She rose to her feet, turning around. “Zipper.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers shakily unzipped the back of the dress. In addition to no underwear, Agatha also hadn’t bothered with a bra, leaving her naked when the fabric pooled around her ankles on the ground.</p><p>Agatha simply muttered, “Strip.” Then opened the bag, putting on a pair of cheeky hipsters that had an o-ring right at the front. “Leave your boxers on.”</p><p>Rio ripped off their tank top, followed by their shoes, socks, and pants. They purposely hadn’t taped today, they wanted Agatha to have unrestricted access to every inch of their body. By the time they were done, Agatha was threading the dark purple strap-on through the o-ring. She followed it up with a small bullet vibe which she tucked in the gusset after turning it on.</p><p>Agatha lorded over them as Venus in the flesh— the curve of her waist and the swell of her breasts, how her hair cascaded around her like a lion’s mane. Every inch more perfect than the last, and all Rio’s to worship. She cradled their chin, forcing them to make eye contact.</p><p>“Eyes up here, big boy,” she chastised. “Before I fuck your throat until you can no longer speak-“ Shit, Rio clenched their thighs together. “I thought we’d bring back a birthday tradition.”</p><p>Their stomach flipped, a shiver running down their spine as every hair on their body stood on end. “Birthday spanking?”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha husked. She bent over, rummaging around for a second and pulling out a paddle and some rope. “If you’re up for it.”</p><p>Rio shot their wrists out, willingly holding them together. “I am.”</p><p>She lowly chuckled, chucking the paddle onto the bed and doubling the rope over itself. Agatha methodically wound the length around their wrists, the muscle memory obviously hadn’t faded, because she was able to execute a double column knot perfectly. She wiggled her fingers beneath the rope, checking to make sure it wasn’t too tight. “Good?”</p><p>“Great.” Rio’s underwear was ruined, they needed something to happen soon. “Are you gonna do a spank for every year?”</p><p>“Well, no. Because forty-six spanks is a little much even for my sadistic self or your masochistic ass.” Agatha fisted a grip in Rio’s hair, guiding them to the bed so they were resting on their knees and elbows. “I’m thinking half a spank for each year, twenty-three total. I’ll do the first thirteen with my hand, and the other ten with the paddle since your ass hasn’t been tortured in about seven years.”</p><p>Wow, it really had been close to a decade. They obviously didn’t engage in much kink while Agatha was pregnant, and definitely not after Alex. There was a certain amount of trust it took in order to engage in play, and for those seven years, it hadn’t been present in their relationship.</p><p>“You’ll keep track of each strike and thank me for it after.” Agatha palmed their ass cheek, her nails lightly scratching before shimmying their boxers down just enough to expose the flesh. “Understand?”</p><p>“Yes, mistress,” Rio whined, resting their head against the mattress and arching their back.</p><p>“How’s that plug feeling, superstar?”</p><p>“So much.” Was all they could get out, pushing their ass out. Notably, the packer was still tucked away at the front of their boxers, Agatha hadn’t mentioned removing it. And they had a sneaking suspicion she’d done that on purpose.</p><p>“Mmmm.” She hummed, her thumb pushing on the silicone just barely peeking out of their asshole.</p><p>Rio clenched their teeth together, squirming. Though they couldn’t really tell if it was to get closer or farther to the pressure. “Please, I’ll be good. I’ll be so good for you.”</p><p>“Oh, I know, baby.” Agatha trailed her fingers over the back of their thigh, a light and teasing touch. “You’ll do anything to please me, huh.”</p><p>It wasn’t a question because they both already knew the answer.</p><p>“Ready, sweetheart?” Agatha asked, her touch receding altogether.</p><p>“‘M ready,” Rio muttered, already trembling in anticipation. “Green.”</p><p>The sound of cracking skin rang out into the room, a harsh bite searing against Rio’s ass; short and sharp. They couldn’t help the pathetic moan that tore from their throat, a beautiful numbness beginning to wash over their brain.</p><p>“One,” they whimpered. “Thank you, mistress.”</p><p>“So polite,” their domme praised. “Keep that up, handsome.” She didn’t give them a chance to respond before administering another strike, quickly groping the muscle after to elongate the sting.</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut, gravelly speaking, “Two. Thank you, mistress.”</p><p>Agatha was not kind enough to alternate sides each time, she was more brutal on Rio’s left cheek than right. She was clearly trying to keep them guessing. The next eleven strikes were given, their skin bright red and overheated as Agatha plucked the paddle off the bed. She gently tapped the leather against their flesh, a warning.</p><p>“This is gonna have a much harsher bite, hon. Color?”</p><p>“Green. Green as grass.” Rio shifted their hips as far back as they could manage. “I want it, please.”</p><p>“Aw, so macho until someone batters your ass a bit.” She ran the paddle down their thigh, keeping them on edge. “I can see how soaked you are for me.”</p><p>There was a dark spot at the crotch of their boxers, fucking clinging to their cunt. “For you. Only you.”</p><p>“Damn right.” Agatha wound her hand back, flicking her wrist and letting her swing follow through and connect against their ass.</p><p>“Oh, fuck!” They rasped. The paddle was vicious in comparison, but it felt so fucking good, Rio couldn’t believe how euphoric the pain spreading through their body felt. “Fourteen. Th-thank you, mistress.”</p><p>Another strike, cruel enough to burst some capillaries, they were sure.</p><p>“Fif…teen,” they hissed through their teeth. “Thank you, mistress.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed the bun Rio’s hair was in, tugging their head up as she leaned over to whisper in their ear. “Struggling, mi amor?”</p><p>“No, ‘s good. So fucking good.” Their inner thighs were sticky, their clit hammering and understimulated. “More.”</p><p>She let go, their face planting into the bedding. “Don’t be a greedy little slut.” Another strike on one cheek, followed by another on the opposite. “You’ll get my cock soon enough.”</p><p>“Seventeen!” Rio’s voice broke as their eyes welled. “Thank you, mistress.” Sweat coated their skin, muscles sore from the position.</p><p>The pattern continued for the next five strikes until they arrived at the last one. Rio’s skin was on fire in a way that they knew would make it hard for them to sit down properly for the next week. They didn’t have to see their ass to know that it was red, raw, and beyond tender. Agatha would put some soothing balm on it before bed, but it would remain battered the entire time she was fucking them.</p><p>“Last one,” Agatha announced, absently palming the very sensitive flesh and sending short shockwaves through their nervous system. Rio nodded, forehead sticking to the sheets. One last <i>crack</i> of polished leather against skin and Rio cried out, collapsing onto the bed with a broken wail.</p><p>Tiny shudders shot through them, panting out a weak and semi-slurred, “Twenty-three. Thank youuu, mistressss.”</p><p>The paddle was then discarded, warm hands peeling them from the mattress. “Good boy, you did so well for me, baby.”</p><p>The praise was a shot of adrenaline, Rio posturing up again as Agatha rounded the bed to sit in front of them. She grabbed their bindings, setting both hands on the soft muscles of her abdomen. “Now you gotta get me ready, handsome. Open.”</p><p>Rio unhinged their jaw, tongue flat to give the most amount of room possible.</p><p>“So obedient,” Agatha hummed. “God, I missed how much of a cockwhore you are. You want me to fuck your throat like the slut you are?”</p><p>They nodded, pleading with their eyes because their brain was too muddled to form an adequate response. Their girlfriend smiled, one that was not out of love but rather a sense of superiority.</p><p>“Three taps for red,” she reminded, gilding the tip of the strap into Rio’s awaiting mouth.</p><p>They met her halfway, jutting out to take the likely seven inches of silicone. Agatha’s hips rolled forward, gently prodding so as not to choke them…yet. Her free hand came to rest at the back of Rio’s head, lightly scratching along their scalp to help soothe them. They didn’t need it but wouldn’t object, letting their throat relax as their wife’s cock slid over their tongue.</p><p>“That’s it, sweetheart. Get me all nice and wet so I can ruin you,” Agatha cooed, winding their hair up in her fist and pushing them further. “You may be all tough to everyone else, but once my dick is down your throat, you’re nothing more than a whimpering bitch. Isn’t that right?”</p><p>Rio mewled, the head hitting the back of their throat as tears trekked down their face. They nodded as much as they could, spit seeping out of the corners of their mouth as Agatha finally gave a true <i>thrust.</i> An involuntary gag rang out, but it only spurred her on, a demonic glimmer in nearly all-black eyes.</p><p>“You’re perfect like this,” Agatha rasped, picking up her pace and pumping her cock into their mouth as the vibrator in her gusset buzzed away. “My big strong butch reduced down to a pathetic fucktoy, hungry for my cock.”</p><p>Their eyes rolled back in their skull, vocal chords straining to give an affirmative hum as she cemented her grip on their hair. The strap lodged itself in their esophagus, Rio’s nose meeting their wife’s stomach as she jerkily ground her hips. Rio heaved for air as their throat spasmed, trying to hack and cough around the intrusion. But they wouldn’t tap out, the lack of oxygen made their mind go blissfully blank. The pressure from the plug melded with the blood flow to their clit, and if they shifted just slightly, they knew it’d trigger an orgasm. The thought was tempting, but Rio wouldn’t come first or without permission.</p><p>See, while Rio usually dominated to overstimulate Agatha and ring out every last drop of pleasure from her limp body– their wife dominated for her own pleasure. Agatha <i>used</i> Rio like one would use a fleshlight. And knowing she was using them to get herself off, got Rio off. They <i>loved</i> being used for pleasure, a tool to aid their wife’s gratification. At this current moment, Rio wasn't a person, they were Agatha’s thing to mold as she saw fit. And if they happened to come from that, it wasn’t the goal but merely a side effect.</p><p>There was a cacophony of gags, wet smacks, and grunts as Agatha drove as hard as she could. Her hips stuttered after about a minute, pulling Rio away and snapping their neck as she came. They wished they could’ve watched her muscles tense and her eyes screw shut, but the coughing fit prevented them from witnessing such a sight.</p><p>Agatha got up once again, leaving Rio’s feeble form on the bed as they caught their breath. She softly petted their hair, gently allowing them a minute before continuing. “Do you want to keep the boxers on while I fuck you, or take them off?”</p><p>Though they were quite fond of the packer, if they kept the boxers on, it would make it kind of awkward for Agatha to have access to their clit. “Off,” Rio hoarsed out, their voice mimicking that of a chain smoker’s.</p><p>She helped them out of the damp fabric, folding them and placing them on the dresser with unexpected care. The packer was still in the pocket, so maybe she didn’t want to throw them onto the floor with everything else. Agatha quickly returned, kneeling on the bed behind them. She helped them posture up on their knees, commanding, “Elbows.”</p><p>Though their arms felt dead, Rio pushed themself up to put their weight on their forearms and elbows. They felt their girlfriend languidly run her finger tips down their spine, over their ass, and between their spread legs. She cupped their dripping sex, tapping their clit like she was trying to communicate through fucking Morse code. Rio flinched away as much as possible, the bundle of nerves already sensitive beyond belief.</p><p>“Uh uh,” Agatha tutted, using two fingers to <i>pinch</i> the tiny nub, resulting in a needy whimper from Rio. “I can see how turned on you are, don’t shy away from me now. You’re a fucking faucet and all I’ve done is use your throat a paddle your ass a bit. You’re so deliciously pathetic and I’ve barely done anything.”</p><p>“Yes, mistress,” Rio rasped, staying still as she pulled her hand back slightly and delivered a quick <i>slap</i> to their cunt, ensuring her finger tips would hit their clit. “Fuck!” Their vision went spotty, their head feeling light.</p><p>“Always were such a pain slut.” She used her other hand to pluck at the plug, pulling it about halfway before letting it sink back in.</p><p>“Yours. Your pain slut. Please,” they groaned. “Please, fuck me.”</p><p>“Sure you’re desperate enough for it?”</p><p>They were bound, bruised, and submissive.</p><p>Yes, they were fucking desperate enough for it.</p><p>The tears returned, mindless as they attempted to think of what more she could want from them. “I…”</p><p>Agatha leaned over, shushing them and using her thumb to collect a stray tear. “Shh, baby. It’s okay, I’ll give you what you want. You’ve been so good for me.”</p><p>“Good?” Rio wept.</p><p>Her voice was honeyed and sweet despite everything. “So good, mi amor.” She removed the plug, warm lube dribbling out. “You’re gaping, handsome,” Agatha noted, using the lube running along Rio’s perineum and coating the strap. “Color?”</p><p>Agatha hooked her thumbs, spreading their ass and notching her cock in their starving asshole. “Green,” Rio wheezed.</p><p>“Inhale.”</p><p>Rio did, holding it.</p><p>“Aaaand.” Her hips wound back. “Exhale.”</p><p>Rio blew out every particle of oxygen, any residual air knocked out of them as Agatha’s dick split them in two. “Oh mi dios! Estás enorme!” <i>Oh my god! You’re huge!</i></p><p>She coiled her hands around their hips, pulling them flush so that her cock was fully sheathed to the hilt. “You took it like nothing, your ass was so fucking greedy for it. Estás tragándome a mí.” <i>You’re swallowing me.</i> “How’s it feel, hon?”</p><p>“S’ big,” Rio sobbed. It felt like they could taste the strap at the back of their throat, they hadn’t been so full in so long. They hung their head, gritting their teeth through the minimal pain. The plug had prepped them some, but not enough.</p><p>“Aw, but you look cute all stretched out around me.” Their girlfriend titled her hips back, winding her hand under Rio’s stomach to snake up and grab their breast. “Isn’t that right, <i>daddy?</i>” She snapped forward, mercilessly stuffing herself back in as punctuation.</p><p>“OH- Ag- s’ fuckinggood-” Rio’s mouth was moving, and they were vaguely aware their voice was projecting, but couldn’t actually speak. Agatha’s pace was mean, plunging in and fucking them as though it was her right. Rio feebly twisted their fingers in the sheets, an outlet as Agatha twisted and pinched their nipple with such little care.</p><p>She seemed to be playing with what would get the biggest reaction from Rio, or more accurately, Rio’s body. What made them howl and shake, what made them collapse and struggle to talk. Agatha pummeled into them, the bed groaning on each return. “You missed this, didn’t you? You missed my cock in your ass, my marks on your ass-” Her hand left their hip, the other still plucking their incredibly hardened nipple. She clasped her fingers around their neck, squeezing at the side <i>just</i> enough to make their breath hitch. “My hand choking the breath out of your body.”</p><p>She was by no means actually choking hard enough or even in the proper way to make airflow disrupted, but that didn’t matter. Any ounce of oxygen Rio had, they’d happily pledge to Agatha. “Y- yes, mistress.”</p><p>Another brutal stroke, another moan, another degradation. It was so good, so, so good. The coil in their stomach was about to snap, legs twitching as Agatha somehow sped up her thrusts. Rio knew she was close by the erratic grunts that echoed out into the room. She fell first, letting out, “<i>GOD!</i>” As she folded over, her weight landing on Rio’s back.</p><p>Hot puffs of air hit their sweat-slick neck, Agatha quickly letting their nipple go only to circle their clit. She shoved her cock in harder rather than deeper, lowly commanding, “Come for me.”</p><p>Compliant as always, Rio broke. “<i>Fuckfuckfuck- mierda!</i>” Their knees gave out, landing them flat on their stomach as they came. Agatha just readjusted, her arms wrapped around them as her tits pressed against their back. Rio tilted their head to the side so as not to suffocate in the pillow, catching a glimpse of their wife. She was just as sweaty, neck flushed red, eyes lidded.</p><p>Agatha didn’t try to prop them back up, content enough to fuck Rio into the mattress. She didn’t ease up on their clit, her pace staying steady while her mouth worked over their neck, her teething sinking into the unmarred flesh. Rio’s bones melted, molding to the bed and shutting off their brain as Agatha’s cock wrecked them. There was the registering of pain, of canines clamping down, of fingers leaving outlines from a bruising hold. Rio didn’t care, not as Agatha fucked them like they’d owed her money–</p><p>Oh wait, they technically did.</p><p>“Stupid bitch,” Agatha husked, causing a cry to leave Rio’s lips. “You can’t even think can you?” She asked after Rio’s third orgasm, maybe fourth. Not important. “You don’t need to, not when you’re so fucking happy for me to use you like the boytoy you are. All mine to fucking own and keep. Who do you belong to, baby?”</p><p>“You,” they whispered, their voice gone. “I belong to you.”</p><p>“Again,” Agatha ordered, slipping her middle finger into their drooling pussy without breaking her stride, her cock moving without friction.</p><p>Rio keened at the dual stimulation. “Your, yours-” Agatha’s finger curled, her palm grinding down against their clit. “<i>Mi amor!</i>” Their orgasm punched them in the gut, convulsing as a warmth spread beneath them. Their cum stained the sheets as Agatha speared into Rio and came right after them. Every muscle in their body was taut and twitching, thoroughly ruined as the birthday gods intended.</p><p>“Messy boy. It’s okay, sweetheart,” Agatha whispered against the shell of their ear, relaxing on top of them as they cried into the pillow. Honestly, it was the type of cathartic release that they had no idea they needed. To just put everything else down and let their wife take care of them, because Rio knew she would. They didn’t need to tell her they were done and spent, Agatha knew.</p><p>“I love you.” It was muffled by the pillow, but Rio meant it all the same.</p><p>She slowly pulled out, mindful as Rio jerked. “I love you too, baby.” Agatha flopped down beside them, unfastening the strap and throwing it on the nightstand. She undid the rope, gently kissing their wrists and pulling them to lay on her chest. “You wanna stay like this for a minute?”</p><p>Rio nodded, burying their nose into the hollow of her throat. She hummed delicate praise and administered reassuring touches, making them feel safe in the aftermath. Only on their cue did Agatha get up, taking care of the toys before helping Rio down the hall to the bathroom. They couldn’t stand all that well, but Agatha was happy to support them as showered, tying up her own hair to wash tomorrow and prioritizing theirs. Besides the actual fucking, aftercare was always Rio’s favorite part. Being cared for and gently coaxed back into reality by the person they loved more than words.</p><p>Agatha stripped the bed, putting on a pair of clean sheets and making sure Rio was comfortable before running downstairs to come back with water for both of them. She made them flip over and hike up their sleep shirt so she could put some lotion on their ass, chuckling to herself at her handiwork.</p><p>“How’s it feel?”</p><p>Rio scrunched their face as she <i>barely</i> brushed over their ass cheek. “Hurts.” They winced at the cooling sensation. “But in a good way.”</p><p>She chastely kissed their shoulder through their shirt. “You did wonderfully, my love.”</p><p>Once they were situated to go to sleep, Agatha pulled them against her chest, curling around them. “Good birthday?”</p><p>Rio smiled into her collarbone. “The best.”</p><hr/><p>Agatha woke up the next morning bleary-eyed, trying to wipe the sleep off her face as she sat up. She scanned the room for her boyfriend, though they seemed to be missing. Her hand blindly groped at the floor as she rolled over, picking up Rio’s button up from the night before and throwing it on her frame. Agatha shuffled out of the bedroom, greeted by the smell of coffee and breakfast, music playing from the media console in the living room.</p><p>Rio might be the only person in the world who gets dominated and feels invigorated the next morning. Who knew getting ass fucked gave you such a spring in your step. Agatha lazily clambered down stairs, yawning as she did a few of the buttons of her boyfriend’s shirt. Only once she saw Rio at the stove did she realize how marked-up they were. Their band tee was oversized enough to cover most of them, but jesus fucking christ, their neck.</p><p>“Morning,” she croaked, shuffling over to them.</p><p>“Good morning, mi alma,” Rio chirped, turning down the heat on the stove and grabbing a mug of coffee. They extended it to her, grinning.</p><p>It was her own damn mug from months ago, but she took it. “How the fuck are you so chipper?” Agatha took a sip, rounding the island.</p><p>“I got railed by a goddess last night,” they supplied as explanation enough.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha lifted the hem of their shirt to check their ass. She whistled, dropping the fabric so it laid at their mid thigh. "That's gonna hurt like a bitch.”</p><p>Rio wiggled their eyebrows, tugging her in by her shirt. “Mmh, can’t wait.”</p><p>She set down her coffee, letting Rio hoist her up onto the counter and stand between her legs. Agatha slung her arms around their shoulders, mumbling against their lips, “Masochist.”</p><p>Rio whispered, “Sadist.” Before closing the gap, kissing her– morning breath and all.</p><p>The ease she felt was welcome, it was comfortable. The trust and intimacy of last night impacted her more than she predicted. She wrapped her legs around their waist, her lips curling upwards as Rio angled their mouth to slot more easily against hers. The kitchen was sunny as it projected onto their bodies, their shadows moving as fluidly as the people who owned them. Maybe they were in a honeymoon period, though those didn’t usually include couples therapy and shared custody.</p><p>Or maybe, they were just happy.</p><p>“My shirt looks good on you,” Rio rasped, their hand trailing up her thigh.</p><p>“Honey, everything looks good on me,” Agatha snorted, arching into Rio’s fingers as they reached her bush. “Are you already horny?”</p><p>They paused. “Are you not?”</p><p>“Touché,” Agatha said, Rio’s fingers moving once again and running through her folds. It was addictive, the sex and the safety of knowing Rio was there. Nobody pushing. Nobody bolting.</p><p>Rio easily sunk two fingers inside, groaning as they kissed her with more fervor. Agatha pried their lips apart with her tongue, moaning as they granted access at the same time they curled their fingers. Breakfast, coffee, morning sex. Agatha didn’t know the last time they had done this, no matter how simple and benign it was.</p><p>Her boyfriend kissed along her jaw, nipping at her ear before working their mouth along her neck. Her back bowed as they thrusted, fucking her as if they had all the time in the world. Her hand rested on the nape of their neck, gentle encouragement. There was no power dynamic, neither one of them were in charge. Just two people intertwined, with soft gasps and delicate confessions filling the room.</p><p>Agatha canted her hips, whining out, “Just like that, baby.”</p><p>“You’re so fucking beautiful,” Rio said as if they were in awe of it.</p><p>“Rio, Ri-”</p><p>Perhaps they were too caught up in one another, because neither of them noticed the lock clicking, or the door opening…or the footsteps entering. There was the loud <i>thud</i> of a bag hitting the floor, then a shriek.</p><p>“Oh my god!”</p><p>Agatha whipped her head at the same time Rio did, coming face to face with their daughter in the entryway which was just off of the kitchen.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Nicky’s eyes bugged in horror, her mouth agape. “Not your priiiime!” Her screams could make milk curdle. “<i>OH MY GOD! I NEED TO BLEACH MY EYESSSSSS!</i>” Their daughter turned around, sprinting out of the loft and slamming the door behind her.</p><p>Deafening silence followed.</p><p>Rio looked at her. “Shit.”</p><p>“Shit!” Agatha yelled.</p><p>“What- what do we do?”</p><p>“A good first step would be for you to <i>get out of me!</i>” She batted their hand away and jumped down from the counter, running to open the door and check the hall. No Nicky. “Okay, okay-”</p><p>Rio turned off the stove, finding their phone. “I’ll call her, she’s probably just in the lobby.” After a beat of Rio scrolling, they pressed her contact. “Straight to voicemail.”</p><p>“<i>FUCK!</i>” Agatha bolted upstairs, fishing out a pair of jeans from her bag along with a pair of shoes that were not the heels from last night. She grabbed a pair of jeans for Rio once she was dressed, chucking the clothing at them when she was back downstairs. “Put those on, I’ll see if I can find her.”</p><p>After jogging down the flight of stairs to the lobby, and not finding her daughter, Agatha checked her phone. She understood see your parents mid-fuck probably wasn’t pleasant, but she didn’t expect Nicky to be upset enough to run. Agatha pulled up Nicky’s location– which of course had been turned off. Rio met her a minute or two later, “Anything?”</p><p>“Turned off her location.”</p><p>“Fuck, she ran?”</p><p>“Yeah, we taught her well, I guess,” Agatha sniffled, her eyes welling. “God, like we haven’t fucked her up enough.”</p><p>“Hey, we did our best.” Rio paced the length of the lobby and back. “She has emergency apple cash loaded onto her phone and an understanding of public transportation, we just made her too independent!”</p><p>“She could be anywhere in Boston!” Agatha ran a stressed hand through her hair. “Why was she even home? She was supposed to be at Kamala’s until Sunday. Did she text you?”</p><p>Rio shook their head. “Nope, nothing.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. “Okay, okay. This is fine. She doesn’t want us finding her, but I bet I know who she’s still sharing her location with.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Agatha was knocking on the door. When it opened, Kamla’s father greeted them. His face fell, “I just dropped off your daughter-”</p><p>“Hi, Yusuf,” Agatha interrupted. “I need Kamala’s phone.”</p><p>He furrowed his brows. “Why?”</p><p>“Just!” Rio snapped. “Please.”</p><p>“Kamala!” He called, his daughter bounding down a minute later.</p><p>“Yeah?” Kamala asked, looking between the three of them.</p><p>“Nicky’s moms need your phone.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Agatha extended her hand. “Pull up her location, I know she shares it with you. You two are attached at the hip.”</p><p>“I doubt we will be anymore,” Kamala mumbled, unlocking her phone and giving it to her. “We had a fight.”</p><p>So that was why Nicky was home early.</p><p>One mystery solved.</p><p>Agatha pulled up Nicky’s location– yes, still live. The screen loaded and–</p><p>She showed it to Rio.</p><p>Her boyfriend sighed. “Of course.”</p><p>Agatha handed the phone back. “Thank you, enjoy your weekend!” She hooked her hand around Rio’s arm and hauled them back to the car.</p><p>Shit, they were in so much trouble with Melina come tomorrow.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In hindsight, Nicky should’ve seen this coming. Cautionary tale after cautionary tale, and yet she thought she’d be the exception. Icarus escaped imprisonment only to fly too close to the sun and die. Nicky had her parents back together only to be <i>fucking traumatized</i> by witnessing them banging in the kitchen where she had her morning poptarts. Rationally, she knew what they did, but she’d rather gauge her own eyes out than actually have to see it. It was moments like these she wished she looked old enough to buy a pack of cigarettes, she didn’t know what they tasted like, but the people in the movies always had a cigarette between their fingers in stressful moments.</p><p>Her boots hit the pavement as she hopped off the bus, her headphones blasting loud enough to hopefully induce hearing loss. If she was overstimulated, perhaps her brain would forget her mom’s moans. Maybe her brain would just forget the last twenty-four hours altogether. Then she could curl into a deep dark hole and never face anyone ever again. Yeah, that could work. Mami had yapped enough while she was growing up about what plants were safe to eat. Nicky would simply live off the land. What land? Who fucking cared, she’d find land and live off it.</p><p>See, comments like those would often result in the beloved Dr. Vostokoff telling Nicky that she was being avoidant. She would then ask the doctor if that was a learned behavior, to which her therapist would say yes. Well, look at her fucking parents! Her mom was the poster child for emotional constipation, meanwhile, mami was the prime example of emotional repression. Mama felt too much and couldn’t let it out in a real way, so she lashed out. Mami felt, but they didn’t allow themself to voice those feelings. So if Nicky is any type of fucked up, it’s those bozo’s fault, not hers.</p><p>Therapy helped her realize the flaws in her parents, and how their flaws ultimately reflected back on her. Dr. Vostokoff was cool, she spoke to Nicky like a person instead of a kid. After <i>years</i> of adults in her life speaking to her as though she wouldn’t pick up on subtext, she really liked that Dr. V was blunt about things. Plus, her accent was entertaining. Sometimes it felt like her doctor was the only person who heard her, which is kinda sad because a doctor is paid for that.</p><p>It wasn’t that her parents were bad at being parents. Nicky knew she was loved, she was quite literally the center of her mom’s universe. But that came with a lot of pressure. Nicky was an honors student, she was in extracurricular activities, she had friends and was well liked at school, she played dumb about her parents relationship when they couldn’t have been more fucking obvious about it. She kept things to herself because she learned after Alex how fragile her parents really were. Nicky could still recall, in picture perfect clarity, the morning Alex was born.</p><p><i>“Where’s mama?” Nicky asked, holding her stuffy while still dressed in her pjs. Nonna was in mom and mami’s room, stripping the bed and hastily trying to hide the blood stained across the green linens.</i></p><p><i>Nonna perked up, throwing the fabric into a laundry basket and smiling. “You’re up!”</i></p><p><i>Nicky clutched her stuffed rabbit a little tighter, because one of her moms was always home when she woke up. “Did mama spill something?”</i></p><p><i>“You know how your mama has a baby in her tummy?” Nonna crossed the room and crouched down in front of her, placing her hands on Nicky’s shoulders. “Well, your sister is coming, so they have to go to the hospital.”</i></p><p><i>“Alex?” Nicky tilted her head. “I thought she was sick.” Mama and mami had been clear about that, it was why mama couldn’t play tag anymore or was always napping. Mami kept reminding her to be gentle with mama, and mama always rolled her eyes.</i></p><p><i>“She is,” Nonna said, her voice strained. “But she can’t stay inside forever.”</i></p><p><i>“Can I see her?”</i></p><p><i>Nonna’s eyes were glassy, a heavy breath following. “Sweetheart…” She shook her head. “I don’t know.”</i></p><p><i>“I could make her a card!” She smiled. “It could make her feel better!” </i></p><p>Everyone around her was sad, and mincing their words. It was the first time in her life that she <i>knew</i> something was wrong, but couldn’t understand what. And that stupid card she made during breakfast sat on the dresser in her parents room collecting dust for months after. But she just felt this need to try and fix what she thought she could, her parents included.</p><p>Nicky undid the latch of the gates, walking along the path and ignoring the grounds crew. At the fork, she turned, her feet carrying her until she sat down at her destination, slumping against the cold slab of marble. She plucked a few blades of glass, winding them around her index finger. The violets looked good, mami must’ve touched them up recently.</p><p>She couldn’t fix her parents, or her family–that realization hurt.</p><p><i>It was a month or so after Alex, when she came bounding home after school. Nicky climbed the stairs and rushed into her parent’s room, where mama always was, where she remained all day, every day. Nicky had drawn a picture, hoping it would cheer mama up, because little things like that always did. The fridge was basically a shrine to Nicky’s art, or scribbles, as she was a seven year old. But what she saw instead?</i></p><p><i>She flung open the door, stopping dead in her tracks as her eyes focused. Her smile faded–mama hunched over in the bed, sobbing. She hadn’t changed her clothes in days, her hair was crazy, or crazier than usual. Her face was red and covered in tears. She didn’t really look like her mom anymore, just a person who used to be. Mama sniffled, looking up and maniacally wiping her face. She smiled at Nicky, but it wasn’t a real one, even as a kid Nicky could tell.</i></p><p><i>“Hi, baby,” Mama said, watery and broken. She smothered the pillow behind her, fixing the tangled mess of sheets.</i></p><p><i>Nicky slowly climbed on the bed, extending the drawing. “I drew this for you, to make you feel better.”</i></p><p><i>She took the paper, her free hand tucking a lock of hair behind Nicky’s ear. “Thank you, hon. It’s beautiful.”</i></p><p><i>“Are you sad? Because Alex is gone?” Nobody spoke about her sister after a while, and nobody spoke about why mama was always crying. Nobody could give an answer, so Nicky figured it might’ve been rude to ask, but she wanted to know why mama and mami were never around one another anymore.</i></p><p><i>“No no,” Mama sniffled, pulling her into a hug– it was bruising. “I’m just so happy to see you.” </i></p><p>Nicky couldn’t fix anything, but she could make everyone’s life easier. She could be the perfect kid, and for those three years–she was. Her parents didn’t have to worry about her, and she didn’t want them to, it was easier that way. And, foolishly, she thought that would change what she already knew was coming.</p><p><i>Nicky was ten when she sat on the stairs, eavesdropping on her parents in the kitchen without them knowing. Mami was home, that was rare, and mom was speaking lowly. But Nicky heard everything, every word.</i></p><p><i>“Are you happy?” Mom asked, her tone was cold.</i></p><p><i>“I…” Mami trailed off, sounding exhausted.</i></p><p><i>“Do you remember the last time you <i>were</i> happy?”</i></p><p><i>“...No.”</i></p><p><i>They were both always so tired, and quiet, and even if they pretended otherwise for Nicky’s sake–she knew. Kids always know, and adults are dumbasses for assuming that they didn’t. Children aren’t stupid, perhaps ignorant, but not stupid.</i></p><p><i>Mom sighed. “Maybe that’s our answer.”</i></p><p><i>“I’m already sleeping on the couch or working all the time,” Mami choked out. “Do you want me to get my own place? We’re basically already separated.”</i></p><p><i>Seeing both her parents at the same time, in the same place was like seeing a unicorn. Although, she’d rather have her parents than a mythical gay horse.</i></p><p><i>Mama slapped something down against the counter, it <i>thudded</i> like a stack of papers. “I can’t do this anymore, I can’t live like this.”</i></p><p><i>There was a long beat of silence, full of things unsaid, much like most of Nicky’s life now.</i></p><p><i>“You really want this?”</i></p><p><i>Mom’s voice was quiet and shattered–she was crying. “You’ve made it pretty clear it’s what you want. I want to be <i>happy</i> again, Rio. I c-can’t…I can’t see your face without picturing hers. I can’t- I don’t <i>want</i> to see your face anymore.”</i></p><p><i>“Okay, Agatha,” Mami replied solemnly, thick and raw with restrained emotion. “I’ll, uh, start…looking for places.”</i></p><p><i>The tears slipped down her cheeks as she cautiously got up, keeping light on her tiptoes so the wood of the stairs wouldn’t creak. Or maybe she didn’t want her parents to hear her sobs–or her heart breaking in real time. The front door slammed a few minutes later. Mom made mac n’ cheese for dinner that night, Nicky told her it was bland.</i></p><p>The breeze whistled through the leaves of the trees, the sun slicing through the branches and beaming onto her face. “Hey, Alex,” Nicky muttered, peeking over her shoulder at her sister’s headstone. “So, things have…developed since the last time.”</p><p>She tried to visit her sister when she could, though winter made it a bitch. Dr. V said there was nothing wrong with talking to Alex, not if it made her feel better. It did, it always did. Alex couldn’t judge her or talk back, she was just there to listen, and Nicky didn’t have that a lot in the past six years.</p><p>“Now, I know how this’ll sound,” She chuckled. “But consider yourself the lucky one right now.” Nicky slung her headphones around her neck, pausing her music. “Mama and mami are off the fucking rails. Mom is insane, and mami seems to like that shit. They think I didn’t know, but I knew. Honestly, I thought I’d just walk in on them cuddling or reading or whatever it is old people their age do. I saw the nature doc in our Netflix account’s recently watched, why couldn’t they have just been doing that?”</p><p>There was a lawnmower, a leaf blower, a faint voice giving a eulogy several yards away. Who the hell has a funeral on a Saturday? Alex’s was on a Sunday, but Nicky didn’t like to think of that day often. When mama couldn’t stop weeping, and mami said nothing at all. When it finally dawned on Nicky that the small box being lowered into the ground contained her sister. When she cried herself to sleep on aunt Jen’s shoulder during the reception after, and how she didn’t see aunt Jen or aunt Alice for a long time after that day.</p><p>“I’m beginning to think that you and I were the only normal things those two ever did,” She said, lolling her head back to rest against the stone. “And even that only had a fifty percent success rate.” Nicky snickered at her own joke, hoping Alex would’ve liked it too. “I’m…I’m not sure if it’s real this time…for them. And if it’s like the past, I don’t know how I’ll survive. Like, are they just hooking up again? Am I delusional again? Because if that is the case, I’m gonna start looking at colleges on the west coast just to get away. Not California though, they’re freaks out there.” She let out a long exhale. “I wanna believe the things they say, and I know they love me. But, they just don’t fucking care about how things affect me. They’re too wrapped up in each other and they’re not even together. I just-” Her voice cracked. “I want our family back how it was, but I can’t ask for that because then they’ll freak out.”</p><p>Sure, Nicky had acted out, gotten a little mean after the divorce, but didn't every kid. Mami was in shambles afterward, even if they pretended they weren’t. Mom was too, but in a different way. Mom went out, she pretended she was thriving, she had dates and girlfriends, even if she never outright said so. Mami became a shut-in, spending their days at work or at home. And, perhaps selfishly, she gravitated towards mami, because their pain was much more obvious and mirrored Nicky’s own. Mami wanted mom back, Nicky wanted both of them back. It was easier to be angry than sad, and mom was the default target of that rage.</p><p>The anguish never faded though, and severing the relationship with her mom had hurt worse than she could’ve imagined. This past year, rekindling that connection, it made her aware of how much she missed her mom. Maybe her penchant for punishment had been inherited, and maybe she was more similar to her mom than she knew. That’s what mami always said, at least.</p><p>“I’m just gonna tell you because if I had to see it, you have to hear about it,” She murmured, shifting a bit to look at her sister. “They were doing it in the kitchen, like, fully where I eat. I don’t know how I’m supposed to look either of them in the eye ever again, and to make things worse, they’re gonna wanna talk about it. And after the night and morning I’ve had, I really do <i>not</i> need that energy in my life. Lucky for me, I’m already in therapy and <i>very</i> emotionally scarred, so this might as well be a drop in the bucket. On the bright side, it made me funny. If you were alive, this would be the part where you laugh by the way. ”</p><p>There was a puff of air near her ear, followed by the flap of a butterfly’s wing. She peered down at her shoulder, noting the silvery blue iridescence of the bug as it perched on her. Nicky hummed to herself, “Glaucopsyche Iygdamus.” The only saving grace was the solace of knowing she couldn’t be found, that she was in her own space, free from-</p><p>“Nicky!” Mom’s voice rang out.</p><p>Mami’s voice came next. “Teddy!”</p><p>“Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!” She whispered as she sunk down further, slapping her hand over her face. “Alex, if you can pull some divine intervention shit, now is the time.” The butterfly took off, floating further and further away. “Damnit.”</p><p>Oh, they both looked disheveled. Mom’s hair was wild and clearly unbrushed, with wrinkled button up messily tucked into her jeans. Mami wasn’t faring much better, jeans and big band tee, hickies along their neck which could be seen because their hair was tied back in a rushed bun. God, how were these the people responsible for taking care of her?</p><p>Her parents came running towards her, panting and breathless. “Oh, thank god.” Mom flopped over herself, gasping for air. “I really need to do more cardio.”</p><p>Mami dropped down beside her, hissing as their ass met the grass. “You scared us, mi vida.”</p><p>“How did you find me?!” Nicky sat up, a slight pout on her lips.</p><p>“Kamala still had your location,” Mom wheezed, sitting on the other side of her.</p><p>She fished out her phone, remedying that oversight and shoving it back into her pocket. “Usually, when someone runs away, it means they don’t want to be found.”</p><p>“You’re a minor,” Mami deadpanned. “It’s our responsibility to find you.”</p><p>Nicky raised her chin, pulling her knees to her chest. “Yeah, it’s also your responsibility not to traumatize your child! Guess we’re just cherry-picking parenting now.”</p><p>“Hon,” Mama sighed. “We’re sorry, obviously we didn’t know-”</p><p>“Can you guys just be real for a second?” She looked between the two of them. “The…<i>incident</i>, though vomit-inducing, is not the issue here! I feel like I’m going crazy! You’re together then you’re not, then you hook up and somehow not being together is stil what’s best for me! I am so sick of you going back and forth about what is best for me without actually consulting <i>me!</i> I’m not a little kid anymore, but you treat me like I am! Do you know how infuriating it is to have people coddle you?!”</p><p>Mom’s face fell. “Yeah, I do.”</p><p>“So tell me the truth!” Nicky snapped, letting her knees fall as she swiveled her head between her parents. “I know you two have been in a situationship for months!” Because she had her mom’s old laptop as her current laptop, and the cloud most unfortunately still relayed mom’s texts to Nicky’s computer.</p><p>Mami’s brows furrowed. “Situationship?”</p><p>“You’re so fucking old,” She muttered. “Are you guys together or not?”</p><p>“Okay,” Mama soothed, taking her hand and intertwining their fingers. “Yes, we are. We didn’t want to tell you-”</p><p>“Why not?” Nicky interrupted. “You’re my parents and it’s affecting my life. I deserve to know.”</p><p>“Teddy,” Mami said, their eyes flickering between her and mom. “We know that we’ve been a bit…unstable historically. And we didn’t want to hurt you if things didn’t work out. We know you’re not a little kid, but you’re still <i>our</i> kid. If things didn’t go well between us, we didn’t want that blowing back on you like in the past.”</p><p>Nicky quirked a brow expectantly. “Well, is it?”</p><p>“Is it…what?” Mami asked.</p><p>She scoffed, rolling her eyes. “Is it working out?”</p><p>There was a pause where the two of them looked at one another until a smile spread across mom’s lip. “Yeah, it is. It’s working out <i>really</i> well.”</p><p>Mami grinned, blushing slightly. “<i>Very</i> well.”</p><p>“Okay, keep it in your pants,” Nicky spat, faking a gag. “So, it's for real this time?”</p><p>“It’s for real,” Mama echoed, her eyes shimmering in a way Nicky hadn’t seen in years. “We’re sorry we didn’t tell you, but we needed time without the expectation of our family going back to how things were.”</p><p>“And now?” She wasn’t sure she was ready for the answer, but she couldn’t help herself.</p><p>“We’re getting there,” Mom assured. “We’re happy.”</p><p>Mami bumped her shoulder with their own. “Do you wanna tell us what you told Alex? Get it off your chest?”</p><p>Nicky swallowed, letting go of her mom’s hand. “I’m happy that you guys are happy. Really, I am. I’m happy that you’ve gotten here.” Her voice wavered. “But, I meant it when I said I need you guys to be honest with me all those months ago in therapy. I- I’m owed that much. I get good grades because Alex can’t. I do piano and place in competitions because Alex can’t. I stopped playing soccer because neither of you could make it to my games after Alex. I’m the perfect kid because I’m your only one. You guys don’t have to worry about me because I’ve made it that way.” She sniffled, using the sleeve of her shirt to wipe her nose. “I’m your kid, I’m part of this just as much as you guys are. Just…tell me things, I’m sick of being kept in the dark.”</p><p>Mom’s hands came to cradle her face, her tone warm and loving. “I am so sorry we made you feel like that, baby. I promise, you don’t have to be strong for us. You don’t have to be perfect, you are so good just by yourself. We love you no matter what, and you never have to do anything to make us proud. You make us so proud already.”</p><p>“We’ll be better about being honest with you,” Mami added. “You’re right, you deserve that. You’re not stupid, actually you may be too smart for your own good. But we’ll never not worry about you, mi vida. We always will, because you’re ours, and you’re so fucking amazing.”</p><p>Nicky nodded. “Well yes, of course I am. I know that.”</p><p>Mom snorted, tucking a lock of hair behind Nicky’s ear. “Can we ask what happened with Kamala?”</p><p>“Oh,” She tucked her tongue against her cheek, trying to blink back the tears. “I, um, I told her I liked her and she didn’t…” <i>She didn’t like me back,</i> is what she couldn’t get out.</p><p>“Aw, princesa.” Mami wound their arms around her.</p><p>“I’ll kill her,” Mama grumbled.</p><p>“Agatha!” Mami lightly scolded, releasing Nicky. “Listen, it’s okay. There will be plenty of other girls, or…” Her mami’s eyes squinted in confusion. “Boys? I’m not sure, you’re kind of an enigma in that area. Besides the point-” They waved their hand in dismissal. “There will be so many other <i>people</i> you like in your life. I know this hurts, but it’ll heal in time.”</p><p>“Yeah, and during that time, I’m strangling the little b-” Mama began.</p><p>“Agatha!” Mami cut her off.</p><p>Mom rolled her eyes, huffing. “She broke our baby’s heart!”</p><p>“She’s a tween!”</p><p>“She’s stupid is what she is!”</p><p>“Maybe she’s straight or closeted-”</p><p>Nicky watched as her parents bickered, a tiny grin forming across her features. She tried to hold back the laugh, but after a few seconds it slipped out anyway. Both of her moms looked at her in confusion. “Sorry,” She cackled. “I’m sorry. It’s just taking me out that you’re both here, fighting about the murder of a thirteen year old. It ironically feels really nice.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Mom chuckled.</p><p>“Yeah,” Nicky repeated.</p><p>Mami smiled, nudging her leg. “If it makes you that happy, we could do it a lot more. Maybe as a family.”</p><p>“What, like, live together?” Her heart skipped a beat at the chance of actual progress.</p><p>“We talked about it in the car,” Mama explained. “And, if you wanted, you could live at the townhouse fulltime and mami could spend a few nights there a week. A trial run without making anything permanent right away, it would mean you get more time with the both of us at once.”</p><p>“Good idea,” Nicky snarked. “Because that kitchen is forever tainted for me.”</p><p>“The one in the townhouse isn’t much better,” Mami murmured, causing mom to smack their shoulder.</p><p>“Oh ewwwww,” She blanched, a shudder passing through her. “You guys are so fucking gross.”</p><p>“Indecrestions aside,” Mama gritted out, glaring at mami. “What do you think?”</p><p>She beamed internally but wanted to play it cool, shrugging casually. “Yeah…whatever, cool.”</p><p>Mami smirked, sucking in a breath through their teeth. “Now, there is the topic of <i>what</i> you saw-”</p><p>Nicky got up in a flash, swiping the grass off her pants. “Nope, absolutely fucking not.”</p><p>Mom stood up too. “When two mommies love each other <i>very</i> much-”</p><p>“Fuck off,” Nicky laughed. “I’ve seen <i>Orange is the New Black</i>, I don’t need the lesson!”</p><p>“Damn, we should’ve put on those parental controls,” Mami said, getting up and brushing off any debris on Alex’s headstone.</p><p>“This is a sex positive household, hon,” Mama quipped, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. “Shame has no place here.”</p><p>“Please, mom-”</p><p>“Now, obviously you're years away.” She narrowed her gaze like it was a fact rather than a possibility. “But a <i>long, long, long, long, looooooooong</i> time from now, you’ll meet someone-”</p><p>Her face felt hot as it flushed with embarrassment. “No, I’m not meeting anyone ever again. I’ll become a nun if it makes this stop.”</p><p>“Organized religion also has no place here, teddy,” Mami chirped.</p><p>“Can we go home?!” Nicky screamed. “I get it, sex exists and I’ll be in therapy for many years to come because of it.”</p><p>“God, Melina is gonna bleed me dry,” Mami spoke under their breath, tugging their keys out of their pocket.</p><p>Mama kissed her own fingertips, placing them against the headstone. “Bye, baby. Rest easy, we love you.” Then started walking Nicky away, letting mami catch up. “Should we cover STIs just to be safe?”</p><p>“Noooooo,” she faux cried.</p><p>“I thought you didn’t want to be kept in the dark,” Mami chuckled, lacing their fingers with mom’s. “We’re just being honest.”</p><p>“Meh meh meh meh meh,” Nicky mocked. They did, in fact, go through STIs on the way back to the car. She climbed in the back as mami opened the door for mom, a dorky “M’lady,” accompanying the action. It almost felt wrong to see her parents engage in PDA openly. Nicky leaned forward, noting her parents hands tangled together over the center console. “Can mami sleep over tonight?”</p><p>“Yeah, Agatha, can they?” Mami grinned.</p><p>Mama snickered, rubbing her thumb along mami’s. “I don’t see why not.”</p><p>After swinging by the loft for Nicky and Agatha to grab their bags, and for mami to pack their own, they drove back to the townhouse. And though she wished they’d drop it, her parents did press on about Kamala. “It’s not a big deal. We kissed, I thought that meant something and for her….it didn’t.” She explained on the couch, curled up in a blanket as her mom braided her hair.</p><p>“You had your first kiss?” Mama gasped, collecting another strand. “Was it good at least?”</p><p>She tensed. “I guess, I don’t know.”</p><p>“If you have to guess, then it definitely wasn’t.” Mami kissed her temple, flipping through the channels next to her.</p><p>“What was your first kiss like, mami?”</p><p>“Oh,” they winced. “Mine was with a guy in the back of his ford after mass when I was sixteen. My parents loved him which is why I even entertained it. His tongue basically wormed around and-“</p><p>“Eugh,” Nicky interrupted. “Mama, what about you?”</p><p>Mom tugged the braid taut, tying it off with an elastic. “I was fourteen and I met this really cool girl in a group home I was placed in. She was a bit older and smoked, which was hot in theory but made her taste like an ashtray.”</p><p>“Well, at least I did better than mami,” she groaned, slumping against her mom’s shoulder. “I thought she liked me…”</p><p>“I’m sorry, princesa.” They offered their hand out for her to hold.</p><p>“I am not touching that hand, I know where it’s been.”</p><p>“I’ve washed my hands!”</p><p>“No. I mean, like, ever!”</p><p>“Using that logic, you can’t touch either of our hands ever again,” Mom said, throwing her arm over the back of the couch.</p><p>“I hate you both,” Nicky deadpanned.</p><p>After dinner, her parents scampered off to the kitchen to start the dishes while she collected the last of the silverware. She hesitated before turning the corner, doing what she did best—eavesdrop.</p><p>“Melina’s gonna ream us tomorrow, but I think we did alright,” Mami softly said, plates clattering into the sink after.</p><p>“What if we messed her up beyond repair?” Mom asked. “What if we’ve fucked up her view of relationships or something?”</p><p>There was the sound of shuffling, followed by gentle breaths. “Mi amor, you and I never had healthy examples of relationships or marriage and look how far we’ve gotten. She’s more than proven she’s got a good head on her shoulders, she’ll be okay.”</p><p>“I just…worry. She put all that pressure on herself and we didn’t catch it. What does that say about us?”</p><p>“Probably that we were too distracted by our own grief to acknowledge hers,” Mami supplied. “But that’s why we’re in therapy, that’s why we’re doing the work.”</p><p>There was a second of nothing, then, “I love you.”</p><p>“I.” The sound of a kiss. “Love.” Another. ”You.” And one more.</p><p>Cue her entrance, being greeted with mom standing at the sink with mami behind her, arms encasing her waist. Nicky faked a sigh, dropping the silverware into the sink and glaring at her mami who was in the process of removing their mouth from mom’s neck. “My god, man! Do you ever get off of her?”</p><p>She didn’t wait for a response, turning on her heel and smothering the smile on her face. Nicky waltzed out of the kitchen and went upstairs to her room, flopping onto her bed. Her parents were together and happy, and she’d take comfort in that. She’d take some pride and even a little credit.</p><p>Because let’s be real, those dummies never would’ve gotten here if she hadn’t decked that bigot when she did. ‘Violence doesn’t solve anything’ her ass. Violence had resuscitated a marriage and reunited a family.</p><p>We should all be more violent, that was definitely the biggest takeaway from today.</p>

<p>“How has living together again been going?” Melina peered over glasses, glancing between the three of them on the couch. Agatha sat in the middle, her boyfriend's arm outstretched on the back of the couch to her left, while Nicky sat to her right.</p><p>“Um…” Agatha trailed off, actually considering the question.</p><p><i>“I’m- I’m, oh fuck, close-” she gasped, her boyfriend's head buried in her tits as she rode their strap.</i></p><p><i>This was after Rio had woken her up with head, a tradition that had apparently been renewed from back when they actually lived together. Since it was still part-time after a month, Agatha could count on waking up to an orgasm without fail four times a week. The worst part being, Rio didn’t do it so that she’d let them back permanently, they just really liked eating her out into consciousness.</i></p><p><i>Rio flipped them over, anchoring their hand against the headboard as they drove harder. “Come for me, angel.”</i></p><p>“Good,” she answered, hiding her smirk. “Yeah, not to say it hasn’t been an…adjustment.”</p><p><i>“Who’s driving me to school?” Nicky asked her parents in the kitchen one morning, scarfing down a bagel as she grabbed her backpack.</i></p><p><i>“Mama,” Rio said.</i></p><p><i>At the exact same time Agatha stated, “Mami.”</i></p><p><i>They stared at one another, Agatha sighing. “I got it, climb in my car, I’ll be there in two minutes.” She filled her thermos with coffee, twisting the cap closed.</i></p><p><i>“Okay.” Nicky froze, then asked, “Who’s picking me up?”</i></p><p><i>Rio answered, “Mama.”</i></p><p><i>Just as Agatha said, “Mami.” She slammed down her thermos in frustration. “I have GSA after school, I can’t grab her.”</i></p><p><i>Rio rolled their neck. “I’ll pick her up, I can head out early.” They leaned over, kissing Agatha goodbye. “What are they gonna do, fire me?” They grabbed their keys, quickly hugging their daughter on their way out the door. Rio had already put in their resignation, meaning that come the end of this month, they were free. They planned on spending the summer with Nicky and Agatha before the practice opened in late August.</i></p><p><i>“How are we more disorganized now than when we were split between two houses?” Nicky cocked her head, catching Agatha’s car keys after she tossed them over the island.</i></p><p><i>“We’ll get better over summer break, hon.”</i></p><p><i>Her daughter grinned. “God, let's hope so.”</i></p><p>“There have definitely been…challenges,” Rio added, giving the doctor a poignant glance.</p><p><i> “Mierda!” Rio shrieked, whipping open the en suite bathroom door and charging out into the hall. “How is there no hot water left in the shower?!”</i></p><p><i>“Sorry!” Nicky called back from the other bathroom down the hall.</i></p><p><i>Agatha reached the top step of the stairs, her hair still wrapped in a towel. “I offered to shower together, that’s on you.”</i></p><p>“Haven’t had a warm shower at the townhouse in almost a month…” They clicked their tongue. “But it’s a small price to pay.”</p><p>Nicky leaned forward to look at them. “I told you it was survival of the fittest, dude.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, squeezing her daughter’s hand. “Atta girl.”</p><p>Melina smiled at all three of them. “I would like to point out that in the month since Rio has started living with you again on a trial basis, your family’s biggest hurdle seems to be water management.” She tilted her head in consideration. “Compared to where we started, that is an amazing amount of growth.”</p><p>Yes it was, and Agatha could recognize that. She and Rio had even had a swanky dinner out on their old anniversary, June 2nd, just to celebrate it because they could. Agatha was doing well, or as well as she could, in individual therapy. Couples therapy, while not always comfortable, was making her feel secure in the relationship. Agatha also had plans to catch up with Jen, she didn’t think it’d take a month to coordinate their schedules, but Jen had already left her position at the hospital and was slammed with prepping stuff for the practice, so Agatha understood. Additionally, the anxiety gnawing at her as the day approached was more than welcome to stay at bay.</p><p>“If you say so,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Melina then looked at Nicky. “And how have you, specifically, been adjusting?”</p><p>Their daughter was still in individual therapy every week where she’d talk with the doctor, but if Melina asked her in family therapy, it was an organic way of Nicky sharing her concerns with both Agatha and Rio present. They really were trying to get better about making sure Nicky knew that she was heard, that her feelings mattered, that she didn’t need to bottle her emotions in the same way her parents might.</p><p>“Oh.” Her eyes flitted between the three adults in the room. “Um, it’s been really cool to have them both around. Kinda feels like it did before everything, but also different. I don’t know how to explain it…”</p><p>“That’s okay,” Melina smiled. “Just try your best.”</p><p>“Like, mami plays music again when they make dinner, and they’re gonna be home most of the summer.” Nicky’s lips curled upwards. “And, uh, mom got me new cleats so I could practice in the backyard with mami for soccer tryouts next year.”</p><p>“I’m not very athletic,” Agatha whispered in explanation.</p><p>“But she still stands on the deck and watches whenever mami and I play,” their daughter chuckled. “Yeah, it’s been good. Aside from me having to announce when I’m entering the room.”</p><p>“We told you that you didn’t have to do that, mi vida!” Rio corrected.</p><p>“I’m not taking any more chances!” Nicky defended.</p><p>Agatha peered over at the doctor. “We have since relegated ourselves to our bedroom whenever she’s home.”</p><p>“Eww.” She winced. “You do it while I’m home?!”</p><p>Agatha cocked her head. “I might’ve said too much.”</p><p>The next day was the last day of school for both Agatha and Nicky, meaning Agatha sat on the patio of a cute little coffee shop on Tuesday afternoon. For once in her life, she’d actually arrived somewhere early, her stomach was in knots while she drank her iced americano. Actually, maybe the caffeine wasn’t a great idea when she was already on the verge of a panic attack. Shit, she should’ve swiped one of Rio’s Xanax on her way out the door. Her boyfriend took it sparsely, usually opting to just down an edible whenever they needed it. But, on the occasion they couldn’t get high, Rio took a Xanax to quell their anxiety. That had been a fun new development she had discovered when Rio moved all their toiletries back into the bathroom. Apparently, their NP had prescribed it after the divorce and Rio had just stayed on it ever since, it secretly made her feel a tiny bit better about being on an anti-depressant. No wonder Rio held it together so well, they were medicated too.</p><p>Agatha chewed on her lower lip as the sun beat down, nervously shaking her foot beneath the table. Fuck, why couldn’t she just clam down? It was Jen, Jen who she had known for nearly two decades. Jen who delivered Nicky, Jen who bought her daughter that fucking drum kit when she was three and laughed in Agatha’s face about it. What was the worst that could happen? And Rio had made it sound like she was excited about the prospect of patching things up. No, it’d be fine. Or as fine as it could be. It would be. Just f-</p><p>“Agatha?” Jen’s voice pulled her out of her mental stupor. Her friend stood at the table, slinging her bag over the back of the chair. “Do you always look like that now or are you suffering from heatstroke?”</p><p>Agatha grinned despite herself, looking over Jen’s frame. She was in a pink sundress, some designer sandals, effortlessly chic as per usual. “What’s your excuse, <i>Jenny?</i>” She quipped back, watching Jen’s smile form.</p><p>“Do we, like, hug or something?”</p><p>“Did we before?”</p><p>“Fair point.” Jen sat down across from her. “How have you been?”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, fidgeting with her straw. “That’s kind of a <i>heavy</i> question.”</p><p>She shrugged, simply answering, “I’ve got time.”</p><p>“Mmh.” Her eyes flitted to the strangers passing by before landing back on Jen. “Bad. For a while. Then okay. More recently, good.”</p><p>“Yeah, Rio nearly did cartwheels through the halls of the hospital the day they told us they were moving back in,” Jen softly laughed. “Took you dumbasses long enough, by the way.”</p><p>There was a long pause of silence, not necessarily uncomfortable, just filled with things unsaid. Agatha took a deep breath, if she didn’t communicate openly, she’d only be hurting herself. Therapy really was a bitch, because what kind of bullshit was that? “Okay, I’m just gonna say it. <i>I’m sorry.</i> I’m sorry that I took out my own shit on you, that was…” Agatha started over, because she felt like she owed Jen more than that. “I was hurting, and I lashed out at you. I wanted someone to blame, and I couldn’t cut off Rio the same way I could cut you off. All you did was try and help and I…I didn’t see it at the time. I’m sorry for blaming you, I’m sorry for ignoring you, I’m sorry that I let my grief consume me for years. It wasn’t fair, and-”</p><p>“No, it wasn’t,” Jen interrupted. “It wasn’t fair that my best friend decided I was the reason her kid didn’t live. It wasn’t fair that I saw my goddaughter maybe twice a year from that day on. And it definitely wasn’t fair that I was punished for doing my job. Well, I might add.”</p><p>Accurate shots fired, Agatha couldn’t deny that. “Yeah,” she quietly said, “Are you angry?”</p><p>“I mean, always,” Jen retorted. “But I’ve moved on. Seems you have too.”</p><p>“I hope so, otherwise I’ve been running up Rio’s bill in therapy for no reason,” she weakly chuckled. “I, uh, I missed you. I know that doesn't fix anything but-”</p><p>“I missed you too, you fucking lunatic.” Jen smirked. “And I appreciate the apology, and I’m glad you’re getting the psychiatric help you so clearly need.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Well, I figured I couldn’t get any worse, so…”</p><p>“You don’t have to discount all the work you’ve done just for me,” she said. “I, for one, am happy that you’re stable enough not to break shit. Also, before I forget, you still owe me $200 for that dutch oven you smashed.”</p><p>“You paid $200 for a damn pot?!”</p><p>“It was <i>Le Cresuet!</i> And they don’t make that color anymore, I’ll never get back my lagoon blue in the matte finish!”</p><p>Agatha threw her head back and cackled. “Get Rio to write you a check!”</p><p>“I’ve tried,” Jen pouted. “Your boyfriend is stingy as hell.”</p><p>“How about we call it collateral damage and I buy dinner and drinks for the next year,” Agatha offered.</p><p>“Bold of you to assume we’re doing this again.” Jen raised her brows.</p><p>Agatha raised her own right back. “Bold of you to assume I’d care about lagoon blue in the matte finish.”</p><p>Jen snickered, almost to herself as she said, “Oh fuck, I really did miss this.”</p><p>“Me too,” Agatha softly confessed. “So, tell me about the practice-”</p><p>“Nuh uh,” Jen scolded. “First, you’re taking me through your engagement to Lightning McQueen.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, but her smile didn't deflate. “Not my finest moment.”</p><p>“Well, those are few and far between for you.”</p><p>She playfully rolled her eyes. “Fuck off.”</p><hr/><p>“Mami!” Nicky shrieked, tackling them to the ground for the soccer ball.</p><p>Rio flailed down to the ground onto their ass, still trying to kick their legs to get the ball free. “How much rage can your body hold?! You’re five foot two!”<br/>
</p><p>Nicky wedged her foot forward and used her heel to kick the ball free, turning around with it and dribbling the ball away towards the other end of the backyard. “Five foot four, actually! I fear none of my jeans will reach my ankles by the end of summer.”</p><p>Rio pushed themself up, panting as they watched their daughter send the ball flying towards the makeshift goal that was set up near the yards fence. And just like every time she aimed, Nicky scored. “I’m starting to think this might not be a fair fight.”</p><p>Nicky chuckled, pushing back her numerous fly aways. “If you had come to my games growing up, you would’ve known that I’ve been swindling your ass.”</p><p>The statement didn’t hold much malice, only a vague sense of loss. Rio knew that they were around significantly less when Nicky was small, it came with the territory of their work. But, they had student loans and a mortgage and a kid to pay for, and though they never resented Agatha for making substantially less money than them, being the breadwinner had come at a cost for many years. They missed some of the slower and simpler moments, they hadn’t made it to even <i>one</i> game before Nicky quit soccer. Rio could sit and stew in that guilt, <i>or—</i> they could work like hell to do better.</p><p>“I’m sorry, teddy,” Rio murmured, crossing the distance to where Nicky stood. “But at least the new practice will let me have more time with you and mom. I promise, your first game of the season, I’m there in the front row screaming and cheering until my voice goes out.”</p><p>Nicky grinned, plucking the ball off the grass. “I still have to <i>make</i> the team first…”</p><p>“You will,” Rio easily replied, placing a hand on their lower back and wincing. “If my back is any indication, you’re a killer.”</p><p>“Well, it’s easy to beat the elderly,” she retorted. “I’m surprised your bones haven’t deteriorated yet.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped. “Okay, fine. Let’s go again! Loser has to clean Scratchy’s litter box.”</p><p>“You sure you wanna make that bet, old man?”</p><p>They walked to the middle of the yard, waving her over. “What? Are you scared?”</p><p>Nicky placed the soccer ball between them, confidently rolling her shoulders back. “That you’ll break a hip? Yes.”</p><p>The game ended about halfway through when Nicky kicked the ball too hard over the fence and nearly took out Herb while he was watering his garden. Which, Rio was secretly grateful for because they could not keep up with a thirteen year old’s energy for the life of them. Rio collapsed onto the lawn right afterwards, sweaty and exhausted, gasping for air. They were in shape, and went to the gym twice a week to help with their anxiety, but it seemed like a moot point. Nicky sat next to them, fiddling with some grass as she eyed the garden.</p><p>“The azaleas look good, promising start,” she muttered.</p><p>Rio looked over, the several plants blooming once again after they had spent the last month rehabbing them. “In a couple of weeks they’ll probably be good enough for a bouquet…”</p><p>“Can I pick which ones you give to mama?”</p><p>Rio smiled lazily, the sun shining in their eyes. “Always.”</p><p>There was a beat of nothing, and then, “I got into advanced bio.”</p><p>They sat up, beaming as they hugged her. “Baby, that’s amazing!”</p><p>Nicky pulled back, shrugging. “Yeah.”</p><p>“What?” They titled their head. “You worked so hard to pass that placement test, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“It’s just…I kind of <i>hate</i> it,” she nervously whispered. “Like, I’m good at it, but it’s so fucking boring.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio furrowed their brows. “Then why did you-”</p><p>“‘Cause I knew it’d make you proud, and I dunno, everyone always asks if I’ll be a doctor just because you are and it's annoying. So, I figured, might as well.”</p><p>“Princesa, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do on my account,” Rio cooed. “If you don’t like it, don’t do it. I’m proud of you already.”</p><p>Nicky gave a small grin. “There is this art history course I’ve been looking at, and I could probably take it if I just do intro bio.”</p><p>“Then take intro,” they said, tucking a few stray hairs behind Nicky’s ear. “Ambition is useless if it’s not spent on something you’re passionate about.”</p><p>She stood, offering out her hand for Rio. “Thanks,” Nicky groaned as she hoisted them up. “Is your back okay?”</p><p>“I’ll ice it,” they dismissed, wincing at how sore all of their muscles were. “But you’re definitely cleaning the litter box.”</p><p>The back door slid open, Agatha sauntering out onto the deck and leaning against the railing. “Did I miss mami getting their ass handed to them?”</p><p>Nicky snorted in the same way Agatha always did, calling back, “I think I broke them!”</p><p>“I’m not decrepit!” Rio interjected, jogging over to the deck and stretching up to meet Agatha’s lips in a kiss. “How’d coffee with Jen go?”</p><p>“Mmmh, surprisingly very well,” Agatha responded. “She asked if I was going to the pediatric benefit with you, were you going to tell me about that?”</p><p>Rio’s face fell. “I just assumed you wouldn’t wanna go.”</p><p>“It’s a night of free booze where Jen and I get to judge everyone’s attire.” She squinted her eyes in question. “What the fuck about that wouldn’t appeal to me?”</p><p>“It’s not free, doctors just don’t have to pay like the donors do.”</p><p>“It’s free for me, which is all I care about.”</p><p>They tucked their tongue against their cheek. “It’s black tie…”</p><p>“Yes, I’m aware.” She lowered her voice so Nicky wouldn’t hear her next sentence. “Don’t you wanna see what lingerie I pair with a dress that’ll be borderline inappropriate for a gala about raising money for sick kids?”</p><p>God they did, they wanted to see so fucking badly. “Mi amor, will you go to the benefit with me?”</p><p>She pursed her lips, shrugging as she spoke, “I guess, if my schedule is free and everything…”</p><p>Rio sprinted around the deck, climbing the steps and throwing their arms around their wife’s waist. “You wanna see me in a suit, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha slung her arms over their shoulders as she smirked. “The ‘play’ part of that pack n’ play has yet to see some action…”</p><p>They hummed, leaning in and kissing her. It started off innocent enough, but then they angled their jaw out of instinct and Agatha’s tongue slid against theirs. And they were not about to deny the chance to make out with their wife, especially after they’d had such a good day with their daughter. The arrangement was working, and all three of them were better for it. Well, maybe there were a few kinks, because there was a sudden burst of cold water just a fraction away from their head. Both Agatha and Rio broke apart to try and find the source.</p><p>Nicky stood in the yard, the hose in her hand with her finger on the trigger of the attachment. “Disperse!”</p><p>“Hon,” Agatha chuckled. “We were just-”</p><p>“I’ve been burned before!” Nicky pressed down, spraying the railing of the deck rather than either of them. “Like feral cats, I swear to god.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio pointed to the door. “You have a litter box to clean. Put down the hose, quick trigger.”</p><p>Nicky turned off the hose, stalking up the stairs of the deck. “Make sure Herb gives us the ball back.”</p><p>Agatha cocked her head. “Why does Herb have your soccer ball?”</p><p>Nicky sweetly replied, “Because I almost killed him with it,” before disappearing inside the house.</p><p>Rio turned their attention back to their wife, asking, “But, seriously, everything went okay with Jen?”</p><p>“All is right with the world,” she snarked back. “You can stop worrying. We’re good.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio chirped, kissing her cheek and letting her go. “Now, I should probably run to the loft and shower and-”</p><p>“You’re not staying here tonight?”</p><p>Rio paused, hesitantly answering, “No.”</p><p>Agatha’s lower lip jutted out just hair, producing a miniscule pout. “Why not?”</p><p>“I’ve spent the last four days here, I thought I should probably go to the place where I pay to live,” they explained, tacking on, “Unless you’d rather I don't…”</p><p>“No, I mean, you <i>can.</i>” She shrugged. “But I was gonna make dinner, and teddy wanted to have a spa night, so you’re welcome to stay, but…”</p><p>Rio blew out a breath. “Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Do you want me to stay?”</p><p>She crossed her arms, biting her lower lip. “Do you want to stay?”</p><p>“Of course I do, I just don’t want to overwhelm you-”</p><p>“Great.” She brushed past them, smacking their ass and opening the sliding glass door. “I’m making turkey burgers. Go shower before Nicky does and there's no hot water left!”</p><p>Oh, that’s right, fuck. So, after showering (with hot water this time), they all ate dinner together. Rio finished up the dishes afterwards only to realize the absence of their wife and child. They wandered upstairs, hearing laughter from the bathroom, being met with Agatha and Nicky’s faces covered by whatever gray goop their wife had concocted. “What the fuck?”</p><p>Both sets of eyes zeroed in on Rio, Agatha putting down the bowl and brush. Both of them had headbands on, Nicky’s mimicking a bear’s ears, while Agatha appeared to be a cheetah if the print of her headband was any indication. Nicky snatched another one off the counter, bright green with googly eyes for ears, holding it up in show. “I got you the frog one!”</p><p>They slowly backed away. “I’m good, I think…”</p><p>Agatha grabbed their wrist, yanking them into the bathroom. “It’s spa night!”</p><p>“Mami, it’s good for your pores.” Nicky wiggled the head band on them, pushing their hair back. “Just relax.”</p><p>“Nothing about putting this on my face sounds relaxing,” Rio tried to say, but Agatha had already started applying it. “Why does it smell like that?”</p><p>“Apple cider vinegar,” their wife said. “It's a clay mask.”</p><p>“What the hell does that mean?”</p><p>Nicky giggled, but her face muscles didn’t really let her smile. “It means it’s gonna get really tight, really soon.”</p><p>“Do you both enjoy my suffering?” Rio accused, looking between their wife and daughter. “Is this fun for you?”</p><p>“A little bit,” Agatha snorted.</p><p>“Yup,” Nicky snickered.</p><p>And though Rio wouldn’t say it, a clay mask was a small price to pay for a night spent doing dumb stuff with their family. However, Nicky wasn’t lying, their face did feel really fucking tight after a few minutes. But, they didn’t complain, not as Nicky made all three of them stand in front of the mirror while she took multiple photos of them in their matching animal headbands and terrifying spa treatments. Rio didn’t complain as they all climbed onto the couch downstairs with Scratchy in Nicky’s lap while they watched a movie. And they wouldn’t complain as Agatha curled against them with her head on their shoulder, they wouldn’t complain as their wife dozed off in the middle of the movie.</p><p>Rio didn’t complain once, not as they carried their wife to bed and said goodnight to their daughter and Scratchy. They couldn’t complain at all, because they finally had everything they ever wanted. They had their life back, and Rio wouldn’t take it for granted.</p><p>It was a little after 11PM when Rio roused to Agatha shaking them awake, her phone pressed to her ear as she frantically got up. She was pacing around, opening the closet and pulling out a sweater and jeans, nodding along. “Yeah, okay. Thank you.”</p><p>“What's up?” They rasped, trying to blink their eyes into working.</p><p>“I’ll be there as soon as possible.” Agatha hung up the phone, tears in her eyes. “That was the hospital, uh, my mom was in an accident.”</p><p>Rio scrambled out of bed. “Is she okay?!”</p><p>“I- I don’t know. They just called me because I’m her emergency contact but they didn’t tell me how she is.” She sniffled. “I guess she’s in the ER, so, um, I got to go.”</p><p>“Yeah, of course.” Rio grabbed a change of clothes. “I’ll get ready and then grab teddy.”</p><p>“You don’t have to do that.” Agatha’s words were weak, they were shaking. “It’s almost midnight-”</p><p>“I do,” Rio interrupted. “I do, because Lilia is my family because you’re my wife.” They hastily threw on some pants and a t-shirt. “Get dressed, I’ll get Nicky up, and I’ll drive. You just get yourself ready, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, running her hands over her face to wipe the tears. “Okay.”</p><p>Rio kissed her temple, squeezing her hand. “I’m glad I stayed tonight.”</p><p>“Me too,” she whispered. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Whatever you need, baby,” Rio whispered back. “Gimme five minutes, and then we can go.”</p><p>Okay, so there was <i>one</i> thing to complain about.</p>

<p>The car wasn’t even fully in park before Rio’s wife bolted from the passenger’s seat, slamming the door and sprinting through the double doors of the ER. The drive to Mass Gen had been silent aside from Agatha’s quiet sniffles, a mirror of the morning Alex was born. Rio unbuckled their seatbelt, making sure Nicky was in tow before following after their wife. Their daughter was still in her hoodie in sweatpants, huge doe eyes already reddened from tears. Rio hadn’t let themself feel it yet, falling back into the role of being the strong one. Agatha needed them, and it wouldn’t do any good to fall apart right now, even if it felt like the world was collapsing in on itself.</p><p>Lilia was the only maternal figure in Rio’s life for a decade now, it didn’t matter if she didn’t give life to Rio, Lilia felt like their mother as much as Agatha’s. Rio found their wife at the front desk, frantically trying to find where her mom was located. They placed a hand on the small of her back as the overworked nurse clacked on her keyboard. “And your mom is Lilia Calderu?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha hissed. “Where is she?”</p><p>The nurse gave a weary smile. “It’ll be a minute before we take you back, have a seat.”</p><p>Agatha slammed her hands down on the desk. “You fucking listen-”</p><p>Rio snagged her arm, tugging her away. “Thank you.”</p><p>Their wife stared daggers at them as all three found seats in the waiting room. “Rio-”</p><p>“She’s got enough on her plate and nothing to gain from making us wait,” Rio stated. “Biting her head off won’t get you back there quicker, I promise you.”</p><p>“How long do you think it’ll be?” Nicky asked, slumping into a plastic chair.</p><p>“Few minutes,” they guessed. “They might need to finish some things up, or double check with nonna first, lots of things.”</p><p>Agatha’s knee bounced in the chair next to them. “Or she’s in worse shape than we thought and-”</p><p>Rio wrapped their fingers around her knee, squeezing to offer comfort. “We don’t know that yet.”</p><p>The time passed agonizingly slow, the minutes spanning what felt like hours. In reality, it couldn’t have been more than twenty before a social worker grabbed them, leading them into the back. Rio half shielded Nicky’s eyes as they passed by the patient bays, some more gruesome than others. There was already a doctor standing at the curtain, asking, “Calderu family?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha wiped her face, pointing to the curtain. “She in there?”</p><p>The doctor nodded. “Your mom-”</p><p>Agatha nudged him out of the way, frantically ripping the curtain open. “Mom?”</p><p>Lilia peered up from her Jello cup, eyes wide. “Hey guys!” She looked how she always did, hair pulled up haphazardly, oversized cardigan and palazzo pants on her frame—healthy as a fucking horse. “I can’t believe they called you, I told them not to.”</p><p>Rio could’ve sworn each one of them let out a simultaneous breath of relief.</p><p>Aagtha’s face fell in confusion, her mouth agape. “You- you look fine?”</p><p>“I am!” Lilia scraped at her Jello cup with a plastic spoon. “That’s what I kept saying.”</p><p>“It’s protocol when someone’s been in a wreck to have them checked out,” the doctor explained. “You mom doesn't have any contusions, everything came back clean, no speech or motor abnormalities.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Lilia hollered. “Because I’m <i>fine!</i>”</p><p>Agatha rounded her bed, taking a seat next to her and clasping Lilia’s hand in her own. “What happened?”</p><p>“Ah, some jackass ran a red.” She waved it off. “Clipped the front of my car.”</p><p>“What were you doing driving so late?” Rio asked, standing at the foot of her bed.</p><p>Lilia’s eyes flitted to Nicky, then to Rio. “I’m a woman of a certain age, I don’t have to defend late night visits to…gentleman callers.”</p><p>“What is wrong with this family,” Nicky whined under her breath.</p><p>Agatha actually chuckled. “You were going to a booty call?”</p><p>Lilia threw her empty Jello cup on the bedside table. “Coming back from, actually.”</p><p>Rio grinned, patting their mother-in-law’s leg. “You scared us.”</p><p>“He’s a hot Italian man with all his real hair!” Lilia sat up, exaggerating with her hands. “I’ve endured a lot more for a lot less!”</p><p>“I hope the sex was worth your car,” Agatha snorted, the life coming back to those twin pools of aqua.</p><p>“It <i>very</i> much was,” Lilia drawled. “Though, I will need a ride home.”</p><p>“She good to be discharged?” Rio looked at the doctor, who gave another nod in response.</p><p>Agatha stood up, leaning down to throw her arms around her mom. “Don’t <i>ever</i> do that again. You are not allowed to die. <i>Ever.</i>”</p><p>Lilia’s lips curled upwards, hugging her daughter in return. “Deal, mio tesoro.”</p><p>So, after dropping Lilia off at home, (with Agatha clinging to her mom at the front door for several minutes) Rio drove their family home. Nicky was a little shaken but cuddled with Scratchy a bit before heading back to sleep, and Agatha was content enough to lay in bed with Rio, her head on their chest. It was early in the morning when their wife asked, “How are you doing?”</p><p>“I’m fine.” Knee-jerk reaction, an instinct.</p><p>Agatha lazily peered up at them, her fingers running along their bicep. “She’s basically like your mom too, it’s okay to have been scared.”</p><p>Rio’s lower lip quivered. “I was <i>so fucking</i> scared.”</p><p>Agatha propped herself up, her hair tumbling down her shoulders and reflecting the moonlight. Her hand reached out, cupping Rio’s cheek. “Me too. I appreciate you holding it together for me, but…<i>really,</i> you have every right to hurt too.”</p><p>“That drive was like the one with Alex,” Rio murmured, letting the tears brim and fall. “I kept thinking-” Rio cut themself off, because they didn’t want to say it aloud.</p><p>But she knew, of course she knew. “Thinking about if we’d survive another one?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio answered, holding eye contact despite their brain wanting to do anything but. “We’ve been so good, and we’ve come so far. But what if it’s the grief that breaks us?”</p><p>Agatha twisted her lips for a beat in contemplation, simply saying, “What if it doesn’t?”</p><p>A grin formed on their lips, tugging Agatha into a kiss. It was chaste and sweet, but it meant more than on the outside looking in. “I love you.”</p><p>“I love you.” She tilted her head up a bit, smiling. “So much.”</p><p>And, just like that—life carried on.</p><p>The next week passed in a blur, with Rio never sleeping at the loft, and Agatha never asking them to. Where Rio might’ve distanced themself in the past, ended up bringing Rio and their wife closer together. It was Friday when Rio got home from work, silently chanting in their head that they only had two more weeks left before they’d get nearly two months with their wife and daughter. They loved their job, they did—but it was time to move on to something more sustainable. A good gig for a family man. The floorboards creaked as Rio slipped off their shoes, flinging their keys on the entryway table. They wandered into the living room, being met with the sight of Agatha and Nicky curled up on the couch, the credits of <i>Clueless</i> rolling. It was past 9PM so it did not shock Rio when they rounded the couch to find Nicky mid-crochet and Agatha yawning while keeping her eyes pried open.</p><p>“There are my girls,” Rio greeted, relaxing on the couch next to Agatha, wedging their feet underneath her thigh for warmth.</p><p>“Oh perfect,” Agatha yawned, yet again. “You can help us decide the next pick.”</p><p>“I suggested <i>13 Going on 30</i>,” Nicky muttered, focused on her current chain of yellow yarn. “But mama wants <i>10 Things I Hate About You.</i>”</p><p>“Oh, <i>10 Things I Hate About You,</i>” they immediately said. “No contest.”</p><p>Their wife pointed the remote at the TV. “Julia Stiles it is.”</p><p>“That’s not fair,” their daughter accused. “You’re always gonna side with her because you’re both old.”</p><p>“Welcome to the prime, mi vida,” Rio snickered, sinking into the cushions and wincing at the tightness in their back.</p><p>Agatha noticed, pressing play before asking, “You need a massage later?”</p><p>They smiled wide. “Please?”</p><p>She snorted, nodding in agreement before Nicky piped up again. “Mami, before I forget, uncle Victor reached out to me on Instagram today.”</p><p>“What?” They sat up in alarm.</p><p>“I know,” she giggled. “It’s such an old dude thing to do. He said that he needs you to call him.”</p><p>Their eyes went wide with what that could possibly fucking mean. “Anything else?”</p><p>Nicky shrugged, fingers twiddling away. “Nope.”</p><p>Agatha looked at them, tenderly saying, “Go.”</p><p>Rio fucking barreled out of the room, stopping in the dining room and whipping out their phone. With shaking hands they unblocked his number and pressed down on his contact, the air in their lungs becoming startlingly thin. The line trilled a few times before he picked up. “Rio?”</p><p>They didn’t speak for a second, their tongue feeling too big for their mouth. “Hey, Vic.”</p><p>He let out a harsh breath, some shuffling around in the background. “Been a minute.”</p><p>And it should’ve made Rio feel guilty, but that shame felt so far away. Rio had a family who loved and accepted them, friends too. They had a perfect new job lined up—Rio had never been more fulfilled, internally and externally. So while Rio should’ve apologized by societal rules and expectations, they instead responded, “Why’d you message my daughter?”</p><p>“Vale,” he scoffed. “I’m doing a good thing here, you don’t need to snap at me.”</p><p>They gritted their teeth, keeping their voice steady. “You can’t just say you’re doing a good thing, you actually have to do it.”</p><p>“Papá had a stroke.”</p><p>Blunt, unforgiving, straight to the point.</p><p>Rio brought a hand to their forehead, rubbing it as a means to self soothe, they’d guess. “Um.” Their voice was no longer steady. “Um, is- is he okay?”</p><p>“No, Rio.” There was a pause, Vic’s voice now wavering. “He had a stroke <i>last month.</i> He died last week.”</p><p>Their back hit the wall as their gut twisted, their knees buckling and dropping them to the floor. “<i>Papá died?</i>”</p><p>He bitterly chuckled, the way men do when nothing is actually funny. “Yeah. Yeah, he, um, he’s gone.”</p><p>“Why did no one tell me?!” And Rio wished they sounded angry, but it came out more like a little kid throwing a tantrum. “Why didn’t you tell me about the stroke in the first place?!”</p><p>“Because mamá didn’t want you there!” Victor spit out. “¡Abandonaste a esta familia!” <i>You abandoned this family!</i></p><p>Okay, there was the guilt.</p><p>“So I don’t get to know my father died?!” Rio screeched, vision blurrying with saltwater. “You all hate me that much?”</p><p>Footsteps padded closer, Agatha coming to a dead stop when her eyes landed on them. She crouched down, placing her hand on Rio’s, and they instinctively clutched it.</p><p>“I tried changing her mind, but it didn’t help anything.” He didn’t sound sorry, though. He sounded annoyed. “The funeral is on Sunday…at a church, with mass before the procession.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, squinting as though they were speaking to Victor face-to-face. “She wasn’t going to tell me.”</p><p>It wasn’t a question, it was a fact.</p><p>“I thought you should know…even if you guys didn’t get along, you deserve to know.”</p><p>“Did he say anything about me…at the end?” Rio sniffled, afraid of the answer to their own fucking question.</p><p>“You want me to tell you the truth?”</p><p>Their heart <i>needled,</i> but they committed anyway. “Yeah.”</p><p>Victor sighed, heavy and exhausted. “Not a word.”</p><p>Rio <i>chucked</i> their phone at the wall, the metal and plastic ending up on the floor in bits, much akin to Rio themself. Agatha’s arms wrapped around them as they buried their face in her neck, sobbing uncontrollably, clinging to their wife. There was the soft chant of, “<i>It’s okay, baby. It’s okay.</i>” But nothing Agatha said could cool the ache, could undo the pain in their chest. Nothing could ease the anguish coating their bones, the shame coursing through their veins. She helped them upstairs, helped them get into pajamas and into bed. Agatha held them as they wept, Agatha stayed strong when Rio couldn’t.</p><p>The heartbreak didn’t subside, not as they put in for bereavement time on Saturday, not as they put on their suit on Sunday. Agatha stood before them, diligently tying their tie—black to match their suit. Rio was aware that their mother wouldn’t appreciate them wearing a suit, but at least Agatha was in a dress, so maybe it’d help a little bit. If straight people couldn’t accept or understand queer couples, at least one of them presenting femininely would help. It was skewed and outdated, built on a foundation of a lot of problematic opinions, but Rio asked for Agatha to wear a dress, and she did. It wasn’t like Agatha never wore skirts or dresses, but it probably wouldn’t have been her first instinct. They were painfully conscious of how they'd be perceived as a family going into today, but it was their father, and Rio was owed this much.</p><p>Nicky wore a skirt with some tights and a cardigan, leading to Rio having to nix the clunky stomper boots she was about to finish the ensemble with. Rio was making themself smaller, and as a result, their family too. They didn’t want a confrontation, they didn’t want a fight. Rio just wanted to see their dad one last time, and it shouldn't have had to be this hard. Agatha drove them to the church—Catholic, of course. Rio peered at their daughter in the backseat. “We haven’t told you a lot about my family, and I’m sorry. There’s going to be a lot of people who look at us differently, and just know—that’s their problem, not yours.”</p><p>Their daughter’s eyes narrowed. “Is that why we don’t see them?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio stated, tone already somber. “Uh, maybe just for today we use she/her for me?” They looked between their wife and daughter. “The fuss doesn’t seem worth it.”</p><p>“But,” Nicky petered. “That’s not <i>you.</i>”</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha gently cut in, making eye contact with their daughter through the rearview mirror. “It’s a couple hours for your mami’s sake. If it helps them get through the day, then it doesn’t matter that we have to pretend for a bit.” She turned her body around. “This is not a safe environment, and I’m so sorry about some things you’ll hear today.”</p><p>She considered both her parents for a second, then muttering, “Kinda feels like you guys are putting their comfort over yours…”</p><p>“We worked really hard to create an environment for you where you wouldn’t have to go through this,” Rio told her. “But that’s not the case for every family.”</p><p>“Guys.” Nicky rolled her eyes. “You think I never got snide comments about being the kid with dykes for moms? Or where and who my dad is? About which one of you is my <i>real</i> mom? We live in Boston, not Sweden. There is no perfect utopia where bigotry doesn’t exist. I’m the half-latina daughter of two lesbians,” she flatly explained. “I’m not completely blind to this stuff, there's no way to shield me from all of that.”</p><p>“Who said that?” Agatha questioned, leaning in.</p><p>“You’re missing the point,” Nicky stated. “It doesn’t matter who said it, what matters is that I didn’t let it change how I carry myself.” She tilted her head. “I’ll play along if that's what you guys want, but you don’t have to pretend our family is something it isn’t.”</p><p>Rio turned in their seat, digesting that. “Thank you, mija.”</p><p>“You ready?” Their wife reached for the handle of her door.</p><p>“No,” Rio answered, and opened their door anyway.</p><p>The church was old and daunting, just how they remembered from childhood. Honestly, they’d rather be in Sunday family therapy than here, but they had as much right to be here as Victor. Rio and Agatha hadn’t raised Nicky religious—obviously. So their daughter’s head was on a swivel as the three of them filed into the farthest pew at the back of the church, on the entirely opposite side from where Rio’s mother and brother stood in the front row. They hadn’t told Victor if they were coming, and so Rio couldn’t blame them for not saving Rio a spot. But the worlds apart they were from the people who they had grown up with—felt agonizingly poetic.</p><p>Mass was just as boring as they remembered from Catholic school, from church every Sunday. It was like a sleeper agent awoke in them, saying on command <i>“Amen,”</i> and <i>“And also with you.”</i> Nicky remained lost, but Agatha aided her as much as possible, having been raised as a nondenominational Christmas and Easter ‘Christian.’ The title Christian being used pretty loosely since no real Christian would do what Evanora did. The procession was carried out, followed by a reception in one of the banquet halls off the main atrium of the church. The casket would be buried afterwards, which meant everyone was convening while Victor Sr. was visible to all.</p><p>Once everyone had scattered, Rio said, “I’m gonna go see him.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, an arm around Nicky’s shoulders. “Do you want us to come with you?”</p><p>“No no, I…” Their gaze was set straight forward, the casket in clear view. Isabella and Vic were standing nearby, thanking mourners and family members. “Would you?”</p><p>“Of course.” Agatha threaded her fingers with Rio’s, a tender smile on her face. “Teddy, are you okay with that?”</p><p>“I never knew the man,” Nicky squeaked. “I think I’ll hold it together.”</p><p>Oh, so inappropriate, and yet—it made Rio grin for the first time all day. “Thank you.” They began walking down the aisle, their family alongside them, closing in on a moment they had never considered. To feel such overwhelming fear and anxiety while approaching their own mother—well, they actually couldn’t think of the last time they approached Isabella without feeling that way.</p><p>Their mother’s eyes landed on Rio, the disdain in amber that mirrored their own was an unexpected gut punch. She appeared the same; a conservative black dress on her frame, heels, hair pinned up in a neat bun. Victor next to her was in a suit, and time hadn’t been so kind to him. His hair was sparse and his midsection was fuller, his hand devoid of a wedding band. Rio had heard through the grapevine that he and Sofia had gotten divorced a couple years back, they remember wishing they could’ve been there for Isabella’s reaction. Vidals didn’t get divorced, marriage was a covenant with god. At least, in the family’s eyes.</p><p>“Rio,” Isabella muttered, a judgmental gaze raking over them. "You're here.”</p><p>“He’s my dad,” Rio responded, choking back tears already. “I wanted to see him.”</p><p>Isabella whipped her head to glare at Victor. “¿Tú hiciste esto?” <i>Did you do this?</i></p><p>“Mamá,” he tried to quell. “She’s his child…she’s <i>your</i> child.”</p><p>“I just wanted to see him,” Rio echoed.</p><p>Isabella looked past Rio, focusing on Nicky and approaching her. She cocked her head, and Isablla might not be the best mother, but Rio was the only one of her kids to make her a grandmother. “You must be Nicola.”</p><p>Nicky leaned in closer to Agatha, her face trying to mask the unease she was currently experiencing. “Most people call me Nicky.”</p><p>The only person who called Nicky ‘Nicola’ was Lilia, however she had earned that right as she was the grandparent who was actually present for their daughter’s birth and life.</p><p>“¿Por qué?” Isabella clasped her hands in front of her. “Nicola es un nombre tan hermoso.”</p><p>Nicky didn’t give an answer, clearly understanding what was said but uncomfortably shrugging instead.</p><p>Isabella didn’t so much as spare Agatha a glance, ignoring her altogether as she then inquired, “Does your child not speak Spanish?”</p><p>“She does,” Rio ground out. “It’s just not her first language.”</p><p>Isabella raised her eyebrows in disapproval. “That would’ve never happened if you had married a man from our church. Your child isn’t even aware of her heritage, she’s been raised in a house with only one fluent speaker.”</p><p>Rio tilted their head towards their wife. “Agatha speaks Spanish.”</p><p>Their brother chuckled under his breath. “Agatha speaks <i>Spanglish.</i>”</p><p>“Vic!” They scolded. “C’mon, man.”</p><p>“You raised a <i>no sabo</i> kid,” he giggled to himself.</p><p>The church was nearly empty as most guests made their way to the banquet hall, leaving the five of them in the most tense family reunion known to man. Rio blew out a short breath, and shit—that Xanax wasn’t doing enough.</p><p>“Tienes cincuenta años, eres calvo e impotente, Victor,” Agatha cheerily spoke whilst mean mugging him. <i>You’re fifty years old and bald and impotent, Victor.</i> “At least Rio raised a kid at all.”</p><p>“I’m not here to prove my family,” Rio hissed. “I just wanted to <i>see</i> my father one last time.”</p><p>Isabella flourished her hand passive aggressively. “Go, then.”</p><p>Rio crossed the short distance, sidling up next to the casket, their lungs failing them. “Hi, papá.” Their father was so still and so pale, it was him, but it wasn't. He wasn’t smiling and his eyes were closed, he was skinnier than the last time Rio had seen him. He was sickly and frail. They would’ve liked the opportunity to be with him at the hospital a month ago, Rio should’ve been given that. “I’m sorry I didn't see you sooner.”</p><p>And as they wandered their gaze over his frame, a suit with the tie that Vic and Rio had given him on Father’s day almost two decades ago, they noted the watch on his wrist. He’d never gone a day without wearing it, it wasn’t exceptionally nice, but it was <i>his.</i> It was his father’s before him, made in Puerto Rico, an heirloom that would never see the light of day again.</p><p>“Why is he being buried with his watch?” Rio looked up through tears. “He always said he wanted to leave it to one of us.”</p><p>“He wanted to leave it to his <i>son,</i>” Isabella indelicately corrected. “Vic didn’t want it.”</p><p>“Damn thing doesn’t work anymore,” their brother muttered. “It’d just collect dust.”</p><p>“I’ll take it.” Rio jumped at the chance. “I can get it fixed.” It would most likely cost a small fortune with how ancient the piece was, probably close to a century, but they’d happily invest it.</p><p>Isabella’s gaze pierced through Rio’s being as she slowly approached them, leaning in and whispering, “That is a <i>man’s</i> watch. It is bad enough you have disgraced this family and god with your life choices, and his death by being here when you are not wanted. You are making a scene on a day that should be sacred.” She stepped back. “If that’s all, it’s time for you to go.”</p><hr/><p>Agatha didn’t hear what Isabella said, only saw Rio’s reaction. Their face fell, absolutely crushed as a near silent sob tore from their throat. They covered their mouth to muffle the cries, sprinting down the aisle past her and Nicky and bursting out the double doors of the church. She let go of her daughter, watching as Isabella left and headed for the reception hall.</p><p>Yes, she had agreed to play nice—but that was before they had made fun of her child and caused her boyfriend to cry. Agatha could handle the digs and the snipes, she had a thicker skin than the other two, but something ripped through her. Pure, unadulterated rage, specifically. “Stay here,” Agatha told her daughter, charging after her mother and brother in law. She’d met Vic a handful of times, but never Isabella. Agatha was fine to be resigned to nothing for the sake of Rio saying goodbye to their dad—until now.</p><p>“Isabella,” Agatha bitterly smiled, fucking grabbing the woman’s arm and hauling her off to the nearest room. Huh, a coat check, okay. It was cramped, but beggars can’t be choosers. Her mother-in-law batted at Agatha’s hand, barking, “Do you have no decency? Vic told me you were a foster kid but that doesn’t excuse the complete lack of manners!”</p><p>She slammed the door behind the two of them, thinking of nothing but all of the baggage she’d carried for Rio in their marriage. “<i>I have no manners?!</i> Real rich coming from the woman who disowned her own kid for no reason other than an insatiable need to demean the person <i>you</i> brought into this world!”</p><p>“It is not demeaning to warn a child when they are straying from god’s path!” Isabella shouted back. “I have held my tongue! I said nothing when she chose to marry you, which only Jesus Christ himself would know why she picked trailer trash! Rio is educated, we raised her well! She was born into a good family, she was raised with everything made available to her and still—she ignored everything we gave her for a life in sin!”</p><p>“Just because it is a sin to you, does not make it one!” Fuck, she was going to tear her hair out. “Rio is kind, one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. Rio is compassionate, even when it’s hard to be. Rio is patient, and loving, and intelligent, and <i>none</i> of that is thanks to you! I have never, for even a second, questioned Rio’s character—I haven’t had to. You raised someone that other parents could only dream of, but because of the god you chose to serve, all of that is…?” She furrowed her brows and puckered her lips. “All of that is just bullshit?”</p><p>“You do not get to judge my life and parenting.” Isabella furiously waved her hand in punctuation. “Do you know what it feels like to create a child, nurture her, break your own body for her—and know she’ll never make it to heaven?”</p><p>Boy, did she.</p><p>“I would and have broken my body for my children. I’d give every ounce of blood, every pound of flesh, every modicum of breath if it meant my kid was okay. If they were happy and thriving, if they were at peace.” Agatha spewed her words like blades on her tongue. “That’s what being a parent is, Isabella. Your child is not a doll who lives and dies at your whim, you do not get to dictate who your child is! You do not get to demand Rio be miserable for your own selfish benefit! Rio does not exist so you sleep well at night! I can say without a single doubt that I’d sacrifice everything for my daughter…I <i>have</i> sacrificed everything for my daughter. As has Rio.” She looked her mother-in-law up and down. “And what kind of mother are you if you can’t say the fucking same?”</p><p>The face that closely resembled Rio’s turned vicious, Isabella roaring, “I will not be spoken to like this by a <i>dyke</i> who is raising a child she did not mother! You can live however you want, but do not bring it here! Your family is an abomination, and I have been nice enough to look the other way for decades, but I won’t do it anymore. Rio can pretend to be a man all she’d like, but not around me. Not around here. And certainly not today.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha placed her hands on her hips. “At least you finally said the quiet part out loud.” She licked her bottom lip, exhaling a deep breath. “And now I can stop mincing my words as well.” Agatha took exactly one step forward as she rolled back her shoulders. “Your son will be your legacy, a balding divorcee with a beer gut. I’ll let Rio know that we’re not welcome because their mother is bigoted cunt who cares more about a fake man in the sky than her own child. You won’t have to worry.” She sucked her teeth for a beat, cocking her head. “But when all your friends die out, and your judgement day comes and you're remembered by others with nothing but contempt—who do you want at your funeral, Isabella?” Her voice got low, lethally so. “‘Cause with the way you’re going, it’s just gonna be Vic and a paid-for priest.”</p><p>“Get out,” Isabella commanded. “Or I will throw you out myself.”</p><p>“My pleasure.” Agatha reached for the doorknob. “Fuck you, you made my husband cry, rot in hell.”</p><p>She left the coat check with several pairs staring at her, giving the small crowd a tiny salute as exit. Agatha walked back into the main atrium, her heels clacking along as she reached her daughter. Nicky’s arms were crossed as a few of Rio’s aunts surrounded her like crows picking at crumbs. “Do you have a boyfriend, Nicola?” One asked. Another giggling, “Are there any boys you like, at least?”</p><p>Nicky stared at them horrified, deadpanning, “Why would I like any boy ever?”</p><p>Agatha collected her daughter, smiling brightly as she said, “Ladies, please, we’ve already indoctrinated her.” And sauntered off with her arm around Nicky, both of them trying to suppress their laughter until they got outside. The win rapidly wore off as they reached Rio, leaning against the car with their palms in their eye sockets, bawling harder than Agatha had maybe ever witnessed. She let go of Nicky and unlocked the car, rushing over to them.</p><p>“Th- this was a mistake,” Rio blubbered, hunched over themself. “W- we shouldn’t have come. We shouldn’t have come. We shouldn’t h-have come!”</p><p>Agatha carefully removed their hands, bending down a little to get level with Rio. “Hey, hey,” she soothed, holding their face. “None of that was your fault, you did nothing wrong.”</p><p>“I let them down, all three of them. I let you and teddy down.” Rio’s voice was barely audible over their harsh sobs that sounded like their ribs hurt. “I- I let <i>everyone</i> down!”</p><p>“You didn’t let me down. You didn’t let teddy down either.” She ran her thumbs along their cheeks, trying to collect the tears. “Baby, we love you. What they think is their own cross to bear, it’s their loss.”</p><p>“Papá would be so disappointed in me, he d-didn't even mention me on his deathbed,” they hiccuped.</p><p>“Look at me,” Agatha whispered, waiting until reddened doe eyes locked onto hers. “You’re not a disappointment to us. You’re not wrong. You’re not living in sin. Rio, even on our worst days, you were still as compassionate and good as the day I met you. You <i>are</i> so good, my love. And I mean it this time—you have me and teddy, you always will, forever.”</p><p>They didn’t say anything more, merely collapsing in her embrace as their tears stained the fabric of her dress. Nicky came around the other side, hugging Rio as best she could. “We love you, mami. And those people were douchebags.”</p><p>Rio snorted at that, somewhere between weeping and laughing. “Thanks, mija.”</p><p>Agatha was able to herd both of them into the car, starting it and peeling the hell out of there. She wouldn’t actually tell Rio all that Isablla said, because she didn’t have the stomach to repeat it, and Rio definitely didn’t have the stomach to hear it. But that was okay, it was for the better. She’d be there for Rio to crumble, and she’d be there to help build them back up again.</p><p>Once they got home, Nicky chirped from the backseat, “You guys wanna know the good news, though?”</p><p>Rio gingerly swiveled their head to blink at her, rasping, “What?”</p><p>She dug in the pocket of her cardigan, holding up her hand with a familiar item clasped in her fingers. “I stole his watch.”</p><p>God help her, Agatha cackled, keeling over the steering wheel as Rio’s eyes widened to saucers. “Mi vida!” Rio squawked. “You robbed a corpse?!”</p><p>Nicky smirked. “It’s not like he fought back!”</p><p>Rio snatched the watch, running their thumb along the face of it. “Should we give it back?”</p><p>Agatha scowled. “Fuck no, our daughter robbed that corpse fair and square. You get what's yours, baby.”</p><p>They tentatively put it on, fastening the wristband and holding it out for Agatha and Nicky to see. “What do we think?”</p><p>She looked at them with so much love as she murmured, “So handsome.”</p><p>The rest of the night was spent slowly, lazily. Rio took their time, and Agatha didn’t rush them. Agatha whipped off her sleep shirt that night before bed, leaving her in just a pair of Rio’s boxers, the AC in their home was old and her hot flashes were too unbearable some days. Her boyfriend—husband—whatever, laid next her in only a pair of briefs and their tape, eyes still slightly puffy.</p><p>She curled into them, suffering through their body being a fucking furnace for the sake of needing to be close. Agatha kissed their temple as they dragged their fingertips over her ribs. Though they were both half naked with her breasts pressed to their chest, the skin to skin was rather innocent, a means of intimacy rather than a declaration of passion. “Did you stay behind to yell at my mom?”</p><p>Agatha sighed but she wouldn’t lie. “Yes.”</p><p>“And?” They appeared so hopeful, as if she’d say the perfect thing.</p><p>She pressed her lips together and gently shook her head.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything, sitting with it. Then, “I get it now.”</p><p>“Get what?”</p><p>“I didn’t fight for you,” Rio uttered. “I never understood what that meant until today. You needed someone to fight for you when you couldn’t fight for yourself.” They brought their hand to her hair, playing with the ends. “You did that for me today, and I’m sorry I didn’t do that for you after Alex.”</p><p>“You fought for me every day since I told you that you could,” she said in return. “That’s not nothing.” Agatha smiled at them, pressing a soft kiss to their lips and snaking her arms around their shoulders, feeling a smile of their own.</p><p>They had passed the test. Rio’s grief wasn’t gone, but they could handle it together. They could handle the grief of Alex together—they had passed the fucking test. “Move back in,” Agatha proposed against their lips. “Fulltime.”</p><p>Rio relaxed against the pillow, resting their hold on the small of her back right before the swell of her ass, as they replied, “Well, considering our daughter is a kleptomaniac in the making-” Agatha let out an obnoxious snort-laugh before they finished. “Yeah, I think that’s a great idea, mi amor.”</p><p>“She’ll make an exceptional graverobber one day.”</p>
