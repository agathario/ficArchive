<p>
The first time it happens, you dismiss it as simply being one of
those things that always happens to Warehouse agents and try not to
make a big deal about it.  It's just an artifact, after all, there's
no reason to get all worked up and freaked out.  It's nothing,
really.</p>
<p>
Well, maybe not nothing.  You and H.G. did sort of have sex.  But no
clothes were even removed, so it's not like it counts.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
Okay, fine.  You're an independent, not entirely heterosexual modern
woman, you know what constitutes 'sex' is entirely up to those
involved.  And if you're not going to be a complete hypocrite and go
by how you've always defined it in your head, then...  
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
Mutual orgasms occurred.  
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
Sex was had.</p>
<p>
It's a weird story, really.  So, just like any other story you have
to tell from your time at the Warehouse, you suppose, but this is
weird even by your standards.  Artie was still pissed about H.G.
being reinstated so had assigned you as her handler - a not
unpleasant job, you admit, and certainly more fun than inventory -
and put you both on cold case duty.  You were never clear on why,
exactly; the impression you'd gotten between his yelling about not
wanting H.G. in his Warehouse and your indignation on her behalf was
that he didn't trust her to be out in the field where she could 'take
advantage.'</p>
<p>
Take advantage of what, you didn't know.  But whatever his logic, it
left you in the ridiculously charming company of H.G. Wells,
investigating the whereabouts of known artifacts that had gotten lost
and looking into old reports of possible artifact-related incidents
that had for whatever reason never been investigated.  You'd taken
the opportunity to teach her how to use the Warehouse computer system
- and if you ever had any doubts as to her ability to adjust to the
leaps technology had taken in the past century, the look of delight
that crossed her features when you explained what the internet was
and she basically reinvented Wikipedia in her musings on the
possibilities for its use was enough to reassure you that she would
thrive.</p>
<p>
You should have known to never underestimate the imagination of an
author.  Certainly not hers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
H.G. had selected a file at random from the cold case database, which
is how you presently find yourselves at a high school an hour outside
of Boise whose 1987 prom had ended in, according to the official
report, an 'unexplained outbreak of abnormal behavior' that had
destroyed the gym.  Students who had participated in the riot had
nothing concrete to offer police at the time, other than the
suggestion that something 'freaky' had happened, and they had felt
out of control of their bodies.  Though there had been no injuries,
school officials had felt sufficiently wary of the entire incident to
seal off the gym and leave it undisturbed for 23 years.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
'Undisturbed,' in this case, meaning they used it for storage of what
looked like every broken piece of furniture and out of date textbook
they had ever needed to dispose of.  Convenient for them, you
suppose, but when combined with the fact that they never bothered to
replace any of the long-since burned out light bulbs, makes for a
rather treacherous search for whatever artifact had made its way into
a high school gymnasium in the middle of nowhere Idaho.  The light
filtering through the partly painted-over windows near the ceiling is
barely adequate enough to determine whether it's physics or algebra
that you're stumbling over at any given moment, and if the muffled
curses are any indication, H.G. isn't faring any better.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
A faint crash followed by a surprised gasp interrupts your idle
contemplation of a battered copy of <i>A Separate Peace</i>.  You
glance across the gym to find H.G. leaning on a decorated lectern
near what appears to once have been the backdrop for the students'
official prom photos, pressing a hand to her chest.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"H.G.?"  Moving closer, you can just discern the muscles of
her jaw working rapidly as she seems to struggle to breathe.  "Hey,
are you okay?"</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
She fails to respond and you close the distance between you with
three long strides, shoving a rolling office chair out of your way
and into a large pile of abandoned Norton anthologies.  You come
around the side of the lectern and lean toward her, one hand on its
surface, reaching out for her with the other.  "H.G., what-"</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
As your hand comes to rest on her back, several things happen in
rapid succession:</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
You realize H.G. has discovered the artifact you've been looking for;</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
H.G.'s head turns sharply toward you, her eyes far more dark than the
dimness of the gym would warrant;</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
You become acutely, <i>painfully</i> aware of every inch of contact
between H.G.'s body and your own and the sudden charge that fills the
air between you;</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
Finally, a brief moment of wonder for what would have caused a
lectern of all things to become an artifact that makes you feel <i>this</i>
flits through your mind, only to be discarded as wholly irrelevant
almost as soon as it occurs to you.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"<i>Oh god</i>." 
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
You don't know who says it - speech becomes as irrelevant as thought
as eager hands reach out to desperate bodies, tugging ineffectually
at clothing and H.G. pushes you against the backdrop on the wall.  Or
maybe you pull her toward you but who cares, as long as she's <i>there</i>.
 She moans your name into your lips, your hands mirroring hers as
they tangle in her hair, needing her to be closer.  And hands...
hands...</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
You need more hands.  Two are simply not enough because when your
legs fall into place just <i>so</i> you abandon her hair and seize
hold of her ass - and holy fuck, you're grabbing <i>H.G. Wells'</i>
<i>ass</i>, and you're pretty sure it's the nicest one you've ever
encountered and when did you become an ass girl anyway? -  and grind
yourself against her thigh in what any remaining rational part of
your mind would surely find a completely undignified manner.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
Rationality has long since gone completely out the window though, and
your only thought is that the friction of her jeans against the seam
of your own (and all praise and glory be to whoever decided to put
the thickest ridge of material in a pair of jeans <i>there</i>,
because really, this is just <i>glorious</i>) needs to never, <i>ever</i>
stop.  You're dimly aware of H.G. mimicking your actions against your
own thigh, and you imagine you'd probably hear the low sounds of
pleasure that you can feel vibrating through her throat if she didn't
have her hands clamped around your ears to keep your mouth in place
as she tries to taste every inch of it.  
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
It's not like you'd pull away if she weren't holding you there.  But
maybe you should.  Maybe this is the sort of thing that would
irreparably screw up your working relationship (because really, if
this were <i>Pete</i> you'd - no, you are <i>so</i> not going there)
and <i>then</i> who would she have to help her navigate this
ridiculous screwed-up world of airplanes and computers and artifacts
that make you dryhump each other into sweet oblivion - 
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
And oh hey, you're dryhumping H.G. Wells to orgasm.  And H.G. Wells
is doing the exact same fucking thing to you.  Maybe you should focus
on that.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
Or maybe you shouldn't have focused on that, because as soon as you
do, as soon as you take note of her writhing muscles and desperate
motions and the smell of her sweat and arousal, you're gone.  You
shudder against her, tearing away from her mouth and utterly failing
to take the breath your lungs scream at you that they really rather
need as your body spasms and your hands tighten their grip on her,
having enough presence of mind to note that she needs just a little
<i>more</i>, and you're nothing if not a conscientious lover.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
You're rewarded with a gasping expulsion of air that whispers over
your neck as she comes against you, and you feel the effects of the
artifact fading away with the last of the waves fluttering through
your abdomen.  Her hands come to rest on your shoulders and it isn't
until you've both spent an inordinately long amount of time trying to
regain equilibrium that you realize yours are still resting where
they <i>really </i>shouldn't be.  You swallow thickly and clear your
throat, unsure whether you should fling your hands away from her or
leave them where they are so as to not draw attention to them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
You settle for trailing them lightly up her spine to come to rest in
the middle of her back, which really has the opposite of success at
lowering the unexpected intimacy of the moment.  "H.G...."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
She gives a rueful sort of laugh - a huff of air, really - and steps
back, letting her hands trace down the length of your arms as they
fall away, her fingertips momentarily brushing against yours.  "I'm
sorry, Myka."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
The extremely disheveled state of your clothing catches your
attention and you absently retuck your shirt, taking in H.G.'s
demeanor with a keen eye.  "It's not your fault."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"Perhaps not, but you deserve better than to be treated to the
lascivious whims of an artifact."  She sighs, turning away from
you to glare daggers at the lectern in question if the resentment in
her voice is any indication.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"Hey."  You step up behind her, a hand rubbing her shoulder
soothingly and you duck your head slightly to come to her eye level. 
"It's okay.  We're Warehouse agents, these things happen." 
She glances sidelong at you and you give her a reassuring smile. 
"<i>We're </i>okay."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
And, surprising as it is, you are okay.  You imagine you should feel
way more awkward and uncertain than you do, but for whatever reason,
looking at her now, it simply fails to manifest.  You watch her for a
moment longer, indulging in the almost burning sensation of her skin
under your hand, before a thought occurs to you and you frown.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"H.G., was that the first time you'd..."  You make a vague
hand gesture toward the wall.  "Since you were debronzed?"</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
She crosses her arms over her chest.  "Since... quite a while
before being bronzed, actually."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
Oh, crap.  And <i>there's</i> the awkwardness you'd been missing,
along with quite a heaping side of feeling like a particularly
terrible human being.  "Oh god, I'm <i>so</i> sorry, I didn't -
"</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
She turns toward you, stilling your inarticulate gestures with a hand
on your forearm.  "Myka."  Light dances across her eyes,
and your breath most certainly does <i>not</i> catch at the sight of
her smile.  "It's all right.  These things happen, remember?"</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"Right."  You stare at her, trying to gauge how much of her
nonchalance is false bravado before concluding there's really just no
way to tell with this woman and sighing, taking up her previous
posture with your arms folded as you glare at the lectern.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
H.G. follows suit, though her glare has taken on more of an air of
amused consideration.  "Well, it would seem that the mission has
been a success, at least."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"I don't see how <i>that </i>would have caused the riot,
though."  With another sigh, you let your arms drop and hunt
through your pockets for gloves.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"Perhaps the effect is magnified with the presence of more
people."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"I guess if anyone can turn an artifact into a sex riot, it's
teenagers at prom."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"Hormones <i>were </i>already running high, I imagine."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
You blink, H.G.'s sage nod absurdly punctuating the moment as you
become struck with the full reality of exactly what had just
happened, and a strangled burst of laughter erupts from your throat
before you bury your face in your hands.  "Oh good god, there is
<i>no </i>way I'm including this in my field report."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"The fact that an artifact caused us to rut against each other
like adolescents?"  She still sounds entirely far too amused.  
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
Unable to reply, you merely nod your head, looking askance at her
with your mouth and nose still covered in abject disbelief at what
your life has become.  
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"I most wholeheartedly agree.  It will, however, leave the
question of how we knew the lectern was what we were looking for."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"I suppose breaking it and just pretending we couldn't find
anything is out."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
H.G. nods in acknowledgment when she sees you snap on your gloves,
and starts clearing books and furniture off the floor for you to move
the lectern.  "It <i>is</i> in rather poor taste for a Warehouse
agent to destroy an artifact."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
You eye the lectern warily as you step up to it.  It is covered in
various decorations to fit the prom's theme, whatever it may have
been, and though any one of them may be the actual artifact, you
can't recall having touched them.   "Then I vote we say we just
started pouring neutralizer on things until we got sparks."  A
ghastly squeaking noise echoes through the gym when you push on the
lectern, but at least its wheels still move.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"After narrowing down the list of test subjects to the likeliest
candidates, of course."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"Right."  A decent path has been cleared toward the nearest
outside door, and you follow behind H.G. as she continues tossing
debris out of your way.  "We conducted a very thorough
investigation into where the students were when they first
experienced symptoms and worked from there."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"Hardly any tripping over school supplies in the dark involved
at all, really."  H.G. opens the door with a flourish, bowing
slightly as you shove the lectern outside and flash her a grin.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"Exactly."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p><hr/><p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
The second time it happens, you don't realize it <i>is</i> the second
time until hindsight strikes several weeks later. H.G. had selected
another cold case at random, a report of the crowd having a little
too much fun during a carnival in Crawford, Nebraska.  Admittedly
highly circumstantial evidence had led you to the home of a woman
whose uncle had been involved with the planning of the carnival, and
perhaps it's the lack of compelling evidence that leads H.G. to take
to blithely picking up random objects in the basement barehanded,
inspecting them idly as you follow close behind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
Of course, your inclination to be close to her has nothing at all to
do with the all-too intoxicating presence of the woman. You have a
good eye for detail, that's all.  So when H.G picks up a smooth
marble-sized stone and eyes it from all angles, you sidle up to her
and think nothing of it.  At least, until you become struck by an
overwhelming desire to seize her by the shoulders and kiss her. 
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
Then subsequently give in to that desire.</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
No thought runs through your mind as you press your lips against hers
and they're exactly as hot and smooth and perfect as you remember,
and after a brief moment of startled inaction from H.G. she responds
eagerly and you pull her body closer against yours.  Tongues meet,
and fuck, if this isn't the most erotic kiss you've ever experienced
you'll do inventory for a month.  Someone moans, you feel H.G. move
her hands between you, then -</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
A flash of sparks, and you pull away to find H.G. holding a
neutralizer bag and looking flushed. "The missing piece of the
Blarney stone, I imagine," she says breathlessly. "Contrary
to popular legend, all it does is make people want to kiss whomever
is holding it."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
You resist the urge to lick your lips, willing your body to calm
down.  That explains the carnival, at least.  "But the Blarney
stone is embedded in a castle <i>wall</i>."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
H.G. seals the bag and motions for you to turn around.  Her breath
dances across your neck as she unzips the messenger bag stuffed full
of newspapers and town records slung over your shoulder and
unceremoniously shoves the artifact inside.  "This fragment
became altered slightly when it was broken off.  The attractive
properties of the original stone are directed toward the stone
itself.  What other reason would people have for wanting to kiss a
stone that thousands of other people have kissed before them, if it
were not an artifact compelling them to do so?"</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"Maybe they just believe the legend of magical flirting powers? 
Not everyone can be as charmingly British as you, you know."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">
"English, darling."  H.G. circles around you, brushing her
chest quite deliberately against your arm.  She leans into your ear,
and although a good two inches of space separate them, you swear you
can feel the burn of her lips against your skin.  "I am, in
fact, devastatingly <i>English</i>."</p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p>
<p align="LEFT">Her boots
thunk soundly against the concrete floor when she walks away.  As you
stare blankly after her, you utterly fail to consider that this might
mark the start of a trend.</p>

<p align="LEFT">
The third time, you know exactly what you are looking for.  H.G. had
gone with the lost artifacts file to select a random case, and you
had to admit it was nice to go into a mission fully aware of what it
was that you sought for a change, even if you weren't sure where to
find it.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
But you still probably should have immediately vetoed the idea of
going after the missing gear from Joseph Mortimer Granville's first
electric vibrator.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The artifact history was complete up until 1974, when it had gone
missing after a museum transfer.  You had wondered why the Warehouse
agents of the time had kept such meticulous records of its
whereabouts instead of simply retrieving it - H.G. had said that
artifacts deemed relatively harmless were often left out in the wild
during the days of Warehouse 12, awaiting retrieval when its agents
weren't busy, and that perhaps this was simply a matter of previous
agents never finding the time.  Then she had claimed to know where to
find the gear, based on its last known whereabouts and the subsequent
health and financial records of a museum employee tasked with
transporting the exhibit.  You narrowed your eyes at that, resolving
to have a chat with Claudia later about what exactly she was teaching
H.G. to do with her computer.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Nevertheless, you agreed with her assessment as to where you would
likely find the gear, and as you watch H.G. casually pick her way
through the large storage locker in Wichita where Neil Martin's
family had stored his things after his death you wonder how much they
knew about how he passed most of the time on his "business
trips."  It was little wonder why he would have wanted to make
off with the gear.  It was, essentially, an extremely powerful
aphrodisiac, and while its effects were somewhat short lived at
fifteen minutes - the typical length of one of Granville's treatment
sessions for female hysteria - it was said to be a particularly
"intense" fifteen minutes.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Martin had met a younger woman while he was working at the museum and
carried on an affair with her until his death two years ago.  His
family had subsequently discovered the affair and relocated most of
his possessions to this locker, from which they sold it off piece by
piece.  It was slightly less than half full now; easy to walk
through, but still nearly impossible to find any one thing in
particular.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I had heard of this miracle cure for hysteria," H.G. notes
aloud, a gloved finger trailing over the curve of an ornate bookshelf
in a far too distracting manner.  "I never had need for it
myself, of course."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her eyes flash suggestively and you turn away, warmth suffusing
through your cheeks.  "Why doesn't that surprise me?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"It was terribly amusing to hear the women in Charles' circles
extol its virtues.  They had no idea that all they needed was a sure
hand."  Her hand wraps around a dented metal vase and raises it
slightly, testing its heft as she casually adds, "I made several
offers to help alleviate the condition myself, but only two ever
accepted."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You try valiantly to not picture H.G. seducing other Victorian women,
with all their corsets and petticoats and blushing naïveté,
but as she goes on describing the public reaction to Granville's
invention and the nostalgic lilt of her voice washes over you, the
image rises unbidden to your mind in far too vivid detail.  
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She would undoubtedly have been <i>very</i> good at it.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I'm given to understand that this vibrator invention of his is
still popular.  Is that right?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
It's fortunate that she has turned her attention to pulling things
out of a battered cardboard box that sits on a waist-high table, as
you don't think you could handle seeing her smirk when her question
jolts you out of your reverie.  You think you might have been staring
at her fingers far too intently.  Though to be fair, they are
teasingly long and elegant and would probably - 
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You clear your throat, resolutely banishing the thought.  "They're,
uhm, a lot smaller now, and you definitely don't need a doctor, but
yeah, they're still around."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
H.G. turns the box over onto the table, its varied contents that
evidently once belonged to Martin's tool collection spreading out
onto the surface.  "And do <i>you</i> own one?"  
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You gape at her for a moment, but the faint "<i>damn"</i>
that passes between her lips spares you from having to find a
response.  "H.G.?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"My glove," she explains, waving her right hand at you to
display the tear in a fingertip of her glove before pulling it off.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
If, in the future, anyone were to ask you what the most ridiculously
unbelievable moment in your career as a Warehouse agent was, you
would look back on the following minute or so of your life and after
a moment's reflection decide they'd never believe it and probably go
with the time Claudia turned you into a superhero to defeat a nerd
with Charles Atlas' workout underwear.  It's a sequence of events
that is improbable at best - bordering on truly ludicrous, really,
and it doesn’t help that you only have yourself to blame.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
In the process of reaching behind her to retrieve another glove from
your messenger bag, H.G.'s hip jostles the table enough for one of
the numerous bits of metal junk from the box to fall off the surface,
and she instinctively catches it with her right hand.  You learn this
part later, of course; your back is turned away from her until you
hear the thump against the table.  She appears flushed when you
glance over your shoulder, and that by itself should have been enough
to raise several alarm bells in your mind, given what sort of
artifact you're dealing with.  But some very important part of your
brain seems to have taken its leave of you, as you ignore not only
the state of her surface blood vessels but also the sudden hitch in
her breath when you step closer to her, full of unwary concern, and
strip off your own gloves to press a hand to her forehead.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She is warm - too warm, and when you move your hand down to her wrist
to check her pulse she jerks her arm away, causing her grasp on the
object she had caught moments earlier to slacken.  It slips out of
her hand and into yours, and although you open your mouth to ask her
what happened it soon becomes irrelevant as in short order you
realize you've both somehow managed to manhandle an artifact without
neutralizer gloves for the third time in two weeks.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
There will be time for self-castigation later though, because right
now, you know nothing but an all-consuming immediate <i>need</i> for
her that you see reflected in her eyes as they flick up and down your
body.  Unlike with the lectern in Idaho you still feel in control of
yourself, you are still <i>you</i>, only with the added complication
of being ridiculously aroused and if you're entirely honest with
yourself it's probably as much to do with the thought of sating your
need with the woman standing before you as it is the fault of the
artifact.  You could hold back, you think - but H.G. is here and
clearly more than willing to take the fun way out so why wouldn't
you?</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Your eyes meet, understanding and questioning and consent passing
between you in the space of a heartbeat and you step toward her,
trapping her between your body and the table.  "This is
happening again," you mumble between kisses against her neck,
fingers tugging at her shirt.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her hands come up to your shoulders, pushing your blazer down and off
as they trail down the length of your arms.  "Yes."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"This needs to stop happening."  Undoing the buttons on her
shirt proves to require too much coordination, and you stop after
only managing the bottom two in favor of roaming your hands over the
now exposed skin of her stomach.  The flesh at your fingertips is
warm, smooth; it trembles against your touch and moves in closer.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Agreed."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She proves to be more adept at unfastening buttons than you and she
pushes your shirt as much out of the way as she can manage with your
hands still wrapped around her, her own hands sliding underneath your
tank top toward your breasts.  "Can you - " your lips move
blindly along her jaw.  "Neutralizer..."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her mouth finds yours and for long moments you forget you'd asked
anything.  "I can't," she finally breathes, and you feel
absolutely no regret.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
It was only a token effort anyway.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Myka, I - "</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You cut off her words with another searing kiss, and her hands glide
around your ribs to your back.  When the clasp of your bra comes
undone with seemingly little effort and she grazes her thumbs lightly
over your nipples, you let out a startled gasp, your head falling
away onto her shoulder.  "Oh god."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
H.G.'s movements turn insistent, dragging your hands away from their
hold on her skin so she can finally divest you of your shirt and pull
your tank top over your head.  As she guides your bra down your arms
she pulls you in closer, murmuring into your ear.  "I very much
need to take you right now."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Which is certainly convenient, because you want nothing more in this
moment than for her to do just that.  Her breath washes over your
skin as she trails her tongue from your ear to your clavicle - and oh
hey, you're half-naked in front of H.G. Wells, no big deal - making
it impossible for you to come up with any response to her statement
other than another "<i>oh god,"</i> a hand coming up to the
back of her head to draw her mouth closer.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She doesn't seem to mind, though; you can feel her smile - probably
more of a predatory grin, really - against your skin.  Your belt
comes undone under her deft fingers, the button and fly of your jeans
quickly following.  You feel yourself being spun around, back against
the table, as her thumbs hook your boyshorts and jeans and drag them
midway down your thighs.  She lifts you easily onto the table,
carelessly sweeping the contents of the box aside, and you marvel for
a moment at her strength as she kisses your sternum and brings a hand
around to the small of your back -</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Then there are fingers inside you, and all thought is swept away.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Your spine abruptly straightens at the contact, coincidentally
bringing your breasts level with her lips and she draws a nipple into
her mouth.  Teeth lightly graze across it as her fingers expertly
find your g-spot and begin a rapid forceful pressure against it - no
teasing, no hesitation, just the frenetic insistence of a woman
determined to make you crawl out of your own skin with delirious
pleasure.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
And she is certainly succeeding.  Your hands clasp around her ears
and pull her up to meet your lips - you can scarcely breathe anyway,
you may as well be kissing her while not doing it.  A moan rises low
in her throat and her hand shifts, her palm now pressing against your
clit with every curl of her fingers.  Your legs wrap around her
thighs as best they can, tangled as they still are in your jeans, her
body stumbling forward against yours and it's so much, too much, the
warmth of her flesh inside you driving your hips into her touch as
your climax takes you.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
It's far too soon; you don't want her to stop, as much as you know
she'll have to separate herself from you eventually, but her fingers
continue to work inside you, guiding you through the shudders that
send your muscles from strained tautness to endorphin-filled blissful
relaxation.  Her movements slow and you finally manage to take a full
breath, an incredulous laugh ghosting over her lips as you glance
down to take stock of yourself.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Flushed skin - no surprise there.  Light nail marks trailing down
your chest - you don't remember those happening.  Jeans still hanging
uselessly around your knees - that can't have been comfortable for
her hand, but she certainly made do with it.  It's all rather
undignified, really, but you can't bring yourself to care.  You
swallow thickly as she withdraws and you see your wetness coating her
skin, and your throat stops working entirely when she brings her hand
to her lips and licks it away, pointedly not meeting your eyes.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You groan and reach out for her, suddenly no less desperate for her
than you were when you first touched the artifact, though this time
you manage to unfasten the buttons of her shirt and shove it away
from her body in a reasonable amount of time.  She chuckles as she
pulls your boots off then finally frees your legs from the tangle of
material around them.  Her head cocks lightly to the side and you
follow her eyes to your sock-clad feet.  She seems to consider them
for a moment, then tugs the socks away and lets them fall to the
floor, apparently for no other purpose than to get the full effect of
you sitting before her, entirely exposed.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
It's what you would have done, if your positions were reversed.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"You are exquisite, darling."  The reverent whisper seems
somehow out of place in this situation, and a flush crawls over your
skin under her wanton gaze.  It's somewhat unfair, you think; you're
sitting there naked on a table for her, and she's still got on
everything but her button-down.  You don't know if you're terrible at
focusing enough to divest her of her clothing, or if she's simply
really, <i>really</i> good at getting you out of yours.  At any rate,
you're naked and she seems to have ideas about what to do with the
opportunity presented to her and you're all too willing to find out
what those ideas are.  She steps closer, your hands falling to her
hips as she kisses you softly, her fingers tickling at the muscles of
your abdomen.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
After a moment she pulls back and smiles at you, bringing a seldom
seen brightness to her eyes.  God, she's beautiful.  You knew this
before, of course.  It's hard to miss.  But in this moment, with her
hands gently massaging the bare skin of your thighs as she looks into
your eyes, you're left breathless at the sight of her.  She is
captivating, this woman; in moments such as these, certainly, but in
everything else she does as well.  She's brilliant, intoxicating,
incredibly charming and a shameless flirt - 
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
And oh god, she's sucking on your clit.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You had been watching her as she moved down your torso, but
apparently the region of your brain tasked with processing this
information had been doing so while entirely divorced from reality,
focusing on all that she is rather than everything she is doing and
god, what she is doing is just fucking <i>perfect</i>.  You fall back
slightly, propping yourself up with your hands on the surface of the
table as you take in the unbelievably arousing sight of H.G. kneeling
between your legs.  Curtained hair obscures her face from view, but
you can feel her lips curl into a smile when her tongue trails
languidly over your folds, and she hums in pleasure at your taste.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her fingers slip back inside you, a gentle shallow thrusting rather
than the all-out assault on your senses she had performed earlier.  A
wayward bolt from the box is sent scattering across the floor as you
momentarily lose your balance and fling a hand out to catch yourself.
 She brushes her hair behind her ear and looks up at you, delight in
her eyes as she maintains the contact and grazes her lower lip over
your clit.  And god, looking at her while she's doing this to you was
the worst idea that ever crossed your mind.  Or maybe the best.  The
focused intensity of her stare, the feather-light caress of her
tongue; it's too much for you to cope with, and you nearly come
undone.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You sit up and pull her closer to you with both hands at the back of
her head, a low groan rumbling out of your throat as your body
hunches over hers.  "Oh god, Helena..."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
If you were any more coherent you'd be concerned about cutting off
her supply of oxygen as you fuck yourself on her tongue and fingers
but you can think of nothing else but the fire she has set coursing
through you, and her free hand wraps under your thigh to cling to the
muscle of your ass in the same desperate need to devour you anyway so
it's not like it would be entirely your fault.  A litany of curses
tumbles out of your mouth in lieu of anything resembling regulated
breathing and you come with her mouth on you and her fingertips
inside you and you can't recall ever having been fucked quite so
affectionately.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p>
You'll consider the implications of that later, after you've caught
your breath and given to her as good as you've gotten - because
there's no way you're going to let her keep getting the upper hand in
these ridiculous situations you seem to find yourselves in far too
often.  Her tongue is still laving over you, her eyes now closed as
she savors the sensation.  Your hands move to her arms and haul her
up as you slide off the table, barely registering the surprise in her
expression before you crush your mouth against hers and taste
yourself on her lips.  The sound that you make then is probably more
akin to a growl than you would like to admit.</p><p>
"Myka, you don't have to - "</p><p>
Your fingers make quick work of her bra and it falls to the floor. 
"Yes I do," you counter.  Or well, okay, maybe you don't
<i>have</i> to, but god, do you ever want to.  Your hands bypass her
breasts on their way to her hips - you want to save that for when
you've finished with the immediate task at hand and can take in the
full effect of having her bare before you.  With gentle force you
guide her down onto the haphazard bed of discarded clothing at your
feet, planting another brief kiss to her lips before moving down to
pull off her boots.  As you do you're struck with the absurd thought
of what you must have looked like as she took you on the table, jeans
that you otherwise would have long since kicked away trapped under
the shaft of your boots - clearly whoever had the idea that
calf-height boots worn on the outside of tight jeans would be highly
fashionable never had the necessity of quick and easy access for
artifact-fueled tabletop lesbian sex in mind.</p><p align="LEFT">
Shaking the thought away you turn your attention to the rest of her
clothing, her belt coming quickly undone at your fingertips and her
hips lift as her hands start to push her trousers down her thighs
before you've even finished unfastening them.  You drag the material
away and toss it (and her socks, you add, biting your cheek to
prevent a grin from erupting) aside then lean back, pausing as you
sit on your shins between her ankles and look up at her, your eyes
greedily taking in every inch of her gloriously naked form.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Holy crap," you breathe, and a shy smile dances across her
lips.  She props herself up on one hand behind her, leaning toward
you, and you meet her halfway as you surge forward, needing to feel
her skin against your own.  Your tongue slips into her mouth, legs
tangling when you drape yourself over her and the searing heat of
your bodies melding together draws a soft moan from one of you. 
Maybe both; you honestly can't discern who's making what sound.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
But the whimper that results when you press a thigh into her,
evidence of her abundant arousal smearing over your skin - that's
definitely her.  The nails of her fingers dig lightly into the thick
flesh between your shoulder blades and you let out an admittedly
somewhat smug groan at her growing desperation.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You won't take the time to gloat, however; you fully recognize that
you're as desperate to be inside her as she is, the carnal need to
feel her slick warmth surrounding your fingers building with each
passing breath.  Your left hand trails down her torso, pausing
briefly when your palm brushing over a nipple causes her breath to
hitch and you smile against her mouth.  Your leg shifts, your
fingertips reach their goal, and you play lightly in her wetness
before trailing back up to circle around her clit and god, you'd
forgotten the heady power inherent in making a woman arch into your
touch, seeking more and not receiving it until you decide to give it.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Myka..."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You're not a tease, though; as delicious as it might be to see her
truly beg, that's an experiment for a later date, when you're less
uncertain of what exactly is going on between you and it doesn't take
artifacts to get you to this point.  And whether such a time will
ever come is yet another concern for some unknown point in the future
- right now, you've got an eager woman's body at your fingertips and a
nearly overpowering need to see her come undone by your hand.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Two of your fingers firmly curl up and into her and she breaks away
from your mouth at the contact, exposing her throat as it produces
another moan.  Being inside her is wildly erotic, filling you with
power and humility all at once, her smooth flesh closing around you,
trying to draw you in further.  You withdraw slightly and begin a
steady rhythm, the copious moisture of her arousal easing your way
and you are struck with the fact that this is the first time in more
than a century that anyone has touched her in this way.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Though you suppose she certainly could have taken matters into her
own hands, so to speak, and god, isn't that just a lovely mental
image?</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You move down to explore the lines of her throat, feeling the
rumblings of her restrained cries as your tongue traces her skin and
the chain of her locket falls lightly against your chin when she
tries to turn her body into yours.  Your fingers move more deeply
within her and press into her on each upstroke - her muscles tighten
in response, her hands scrambling for a hold on your shoulders.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Freckles dot her chest, one lying almost obscenely tantalizingly on
the side of her breast.  As you bend to kiss them an irrational flash
of jealousy at the knowledge that you're likely following a path
marked by any number of her previous lovers courses through you,
causing your fingers to work inside her more feverishly and her hips
only surge forward all the more fiercely to meet them.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"<i>There</i>, Myka," she gasps, and you forego any further
thrusts of your hand in favor of giving the same focus to her g-spot
as she had given you.  Sweat has gathered between her breasts, her
hair is matted to her forehead - the room has become positively
smothered with the smell of sex, and you don't think you've ever been
more intoxicated by it in your life.  Your lips finally make their
way to the freckle on her breast and your tongue darts out to draw
the line between it and her nipple.  Air flows over the trace of
saliva on her flesh when you exhale, causing goosebumps to rise and
she gives an involuntary shudder.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Your thumb reaches up to brush over her clit; the angle is awkward,
but it proves to be effective and you feel the beginning of tremors
within her.  A leg wraps around the back of your thighs as she seems
to try to crawl into you, a hand coming up to tangle in your hair
when you bite down on the nipple between your teeth.  She strains
against you for a few moments more and when her orgasm finally
strikes it is with a strangled shout of your name.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her muscles continue to spasm as your fingers guide her through.  You
draw back to watch her - her eyes are wrenched shut, her mouth
gnashing at the air, and the hand not bruisingly clamped around your
bicep tangles through her own hair in an amusingly familiar gesture. 
The sight is breathtaking; the knowledge that you were the one to
bring her to this state is even more so.  
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
At last her body relaxes, collapsing back to the floor, and when her
eyes open she smiles, open and wide.  It's infectious; you lean down
and meet her lips with your own, letting your fingers slip out of
her.  She gives a small sound of loss at that, and, heedless of the
wetness still coating them, you bring your hand up to her cheek and
run your fingertips along the bone.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You lie there together for an interminable amount of time, long,
languid kisses punctuating the silence that has descended.  A part of
you feels as though something should be said, although what that
would be, you couldn't say.  The feeling isn't from any desire to
voice your thoughts, merely an acknowledgement of the fact that this
is a situation that should result in the sort of deep conversation
that in all honesty you're perfectly okay with avoiding entirely.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
By apparent unspoken agreement your lips eventually fall away from
each other and you settle your head onto her arm, your body lying
slightly askew over hers.  Your eyes fall upon a discarded
neutralizer glove lying under one of her boots, and you suddenly
remember exactly what had created the situation in the first place.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Fifteen minutes, the file had said.  That was how long a hysteria
treatment session had lasted, and that was how long the effects of
the artifact were felt.  You had noted the time when you entered the
storage locker - 11:17.  You estimate you had come into contact with
the gear no more than five minutes later.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You turn your wrist slightly where it rests against Helena's
sweat-slick skin and glance at your watch.  It reads a minute to
noon.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">Fifteen
minutes.  The file had been quite clear.</p>

<p align="LEFT">
After the fourth, fifth, and sixth times, you start to get a little
suspicious.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
After the seventh time, you are still licking the taste of her from
your lips when you hear a muffled curse from across the room where
Helena is neutralizing the artifact in a tub of goo.  You step over
to her - both of you still utterly naked, because really, what's the
use of modesty at this point? - and find her staring at a worn
leather bracelet held delicately between her thumb and forefinger, a
puzzled expression playing about her features.  "Helena?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She starts, glancing at you briefly before turning back to the
bracelet.  "It came off with my glove," she explains
absently, twirling the leather between her fingertips.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You watch her movements intently for a moment, your brain working
furiously somewhere in the part of your consciousness that doesn't
like to talk to you about exactly what it's thinking.  You don't get
vibes, but you do excel at connecting the dots, and this bracelet is
a very large dot.  You'd noticed it before, of course - that's what
you do, after all - but had never seen fit to ask her about it.  But
with this small bit of possible serendipity, you see a very good
reason to ask about it now.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Helena, where did you get that?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"It was in the crates with the rest of my effects from Warehouse
12.  I don't..." she pauses, brow furrowed.  "I don't know
why I've been wearing it."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You nod slowly and reach for the neutralizer bag underneath the vat
of goo at her feet.  "May I...?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She drops the bracelet into your outstretched palm.  Holding the bag
at arm's length you take a breath, shielding yourself against any
possible sparks, and drop the bracelet inside.  A pitiful crackle
emanates from the bag along with a solitary spark, but it counts. 
It's an artifact.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Helena frowns.  "That is... rather disconcerting."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Do you feel any different?"  You doubt, given its evident
lack of any great power, that the bracelet could have affected her
that much, but you have to ask.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She considers the question.  "No," she concludes with a
brief shake of her head, finally looking up at you.  "Do you
think..."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I have an idea, but we'd need to test it back at the
Warehouse."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The solid thunk of the neutralizer tub's lock echoes through the room
and she pushes it aside.  "And what might that idea be?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You bite your lip and try desperately to not stare when she bends
over to pick up the clothes strewn about the floor.  "I... don't
think I should say.  It might be one of those things that doesn't
work if you know how it works, you know?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Ah," she agrees, and steps into her incredibly lacy,
incredibly small, black boyshorts.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
That trip to the mall had been <i>so</i> worth it.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I mean, it already might not work just from the fact that we
know it's an artifact now..."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I leave it in your capable hands, darling."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Your natural inclination is to get the matter sorted out as quickly
as possible, but your natural inclination hadn't figured on Pete up
and deciding that it was high time for everyone to take a family
vacation as soon as you get back to the Warehouse.  Or for Mrs. F
showing up out of nowhere and going all Mrs. F on Artie and all but
ordering him to allow it.  She gives you and Helena a significant
look as you pass her on your way out the umbilicus, and from the way
she tells Artie to stay put you figure a serious talking-to is about
to ensue.  Or a talking-about.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Whatever the case, you don't want to be there.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Helena defers the decision of what to do with your collective weekend
off to you; you in turn defer to Pete and Claudia, who waste no time
in agreeing on a trip to Cedar Point and the frequent flyer miles you
have accumulated over the past two years come in quite handy when
they insist on flying out that night to get to Sandusky in time for
the park's opening in the morning.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
So it is that you find yourself wandering around an amusement park
full of screaming children and kitschy music with Helena strolling
bemusedly by your side.  Claudia asks her if she wants to join in
when she, Pete, and Leena ride Millennium Force first thing; Helena
takes one look at the indicated ride and its three-hundred-foot drop
and seems offended at the suggestion.  "I think not," she
says flatly, and the others run off to join the line.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You had come prepared for this eventuality though, suspecting that
Helena would share if not your mild fear of heights then at least
your lack of enthusiasm for the thought of traveling at highway
speeds in an open air vehicle hurtling upside down over solid
concrete.  Several books that you figured she would enjoy weigh down
the messenger bag slung over your shoulder, and you guide her to a
bench near the ride's exit to wait for them to show up again.  The
books are forgotten, though, when Helena asks about the mechanisms
behind the functioning of the roller coasters around you, and you
quickly become absorbed in a technical conversation that you know
Pete would only mock you for enjoying so much.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Much of the day progresses in a similar fashion, Claudia and Pete
dragging Leena - whose token protests are, you're fairly certain,
only for their benefit - along with them on nearly every ride while
you and Helena do nothing but talk while waiting for them, the
conversation dancing between recent scientific advances and your
respective histories with the Warehouse, and she tries to
explain the workings of her time machine to you again but even three
weeks after using it yourself you still fail to understand it.  After
lunch, when Pete leads the pack on a march to the four-hundred-foot
tall vertical monstrosity that is the Top Thrill Dragster and you
smile fondly after them, Helena quietly pulls a small notebook out of
her back pocket and makes a note in it.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"What's that?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her lips curl into a private smile and she hands you the notebook. 
The word "awesome" is written in large letters at the top,
the names Pete, Claudia, and Leena listed below it.  A series of tick
marks are next to each name; Pete has seventeen, Claudia sixteen, and
Leena has one.  "They say that word far more often than they
realize, I think."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You raise an eyebrow.  "Leena?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I believe she only said it under duress."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You nod in understanding, unable to keep from grinning as you pass
the notebook back to her.  "You know you can't ever show them
this, right?  They'd just take it as a challenge."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"It is rather endearing, actually.  In their own way."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You choose to keep your own counsel about how the same could be said
of this new hobby of hers and instead rise, offering your hand to
help her up with a smile.  "They're going to be in that line for
at least an hour. I don't know about you, but I could use a break
from all the crowds."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She lets you guide her through the throngs gathered around the
pavilion, maintaining a loose grip on your hand.  "What do you
propose?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"The beach," you say simply, your thoughts somewhat
scattered as you try to rationalize her continued holding of your
hand.  A particularly oblivious group of teenagers forces you to part
soon enough though, and you do your best to ignore the sudden empty
chill of your palm.  Lake Erie comes into view as you round the
corner between a corkscrew-like ride and an arcade hall and Helena
pauses on the edge of the concrete separating the park from the white
sand of the beach, absorbing the sight.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I never had occasion to visit any of the great lakes," she
says, a hint of wonder in her voice.  "Photographs do not seem
to do them justice."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The view is a spectacular one, you have to admit.  The water before
you stretches beyond the horizon, seeming more an ocean than a
landlocked lake.  Sailboats and cargo tankers dot the surface in the
distance, and gulls circle overhead, occasionally landing for a
discarded scrap of park food.  You fold your arms across your chest,
fighting back a grin.  "Would you call it... <i>awesome</i>?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She turns to you, and a wisp of hair propelled by the cool breeze
flits across her eyes.  "In the true sense of the word,
perhaps."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You laugh and with a jerk of your head you lead her across the sand,
eventually camping out in a patch of shade where you can almost
forget you're in a crowded park with thousands of other people, if
not for the occasional shout from the building behind you whose
shadow you are inhabiting.  The lack of a beach towel isn't ideal -
you're going to be shaking sand out of your pants for the rest of the
day, you just know it - but it'll do.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Helena certainly doesn't seem to mind, her fingers lacing behind her
head as she promptly lies down in the sand at your feet with a sigh. 
She looks up at you, one eye squinted closed.  "How shall we
pass the time?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You let your bag fall to the ground and sit cross-legged by her hip,
your back to the water so you can talk to her directly.  "I did
bring a few books," you offer, sifting through the bag to
retrieve an old copy of <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>.  She props
herself up on an elbow and you pass the book over to her questioning
hand.  "He's one of my favorite science fiction authors."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Present company excluded, I hope," she idly teases,
examining the description on the back cover with interest.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
It strikes you, then, that the extraordinary circumstances of this
woman's existence had, somehow, faded into just being... her.  You
had never once considered the fact that Helena's own writing had led
the way for Bradbury, and that she might be interested in seeing how
the genre had evolved; you had simply seen the book sitting on your
shelf and thought she would find it a thought-provoking and absorbing
read.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
At some point she had stopped being <i>H.G. Wells</i>, brilliant
inventor and world famous author who you had admired even as a child,
and simply become <i>Helena</i>, an amazing, complicated woman whom
you now know, with the utter certainty that always seems to accompany
such revelations, that you're going to end up completely, hopelessly
in love with.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
And somehow you can't bring yourself to freak out about that.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I did say <i>one of</i>," you point out finally, watching
as she peruses the first page, her lower lip pulled lightly between
her teeth.  "Your ego is safe."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The book closes softly and she raises an eyebrow at you.  "I
wasn't concerned for my ego, darling, merely for your taste in
literature."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her airy tone and gleaming eyes belie the remark; you feel your lips
curling up into a wide smile, and her carefully schooled expression
crumbles when she glances over to you and can't fight a rather more
subdued smile of her own.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
<i>So</i> in love.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"This seems quite promising," she concedes, passing the
book over to you.  "An intriguing concept."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I really think you'll love it."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She settles back onto the sand and closes her eyes.  They soon reopen
when you take an indulgent moment to watch the play of the dancing
shadows of her hair about her features, and she stares up at you
expectantly.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You flush, settle the book on your lap, clear your throat, and begin
to read.  
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Three days later the memory of her fingertips idly lacing with yours
as your hand rested on her thigh - you had smacked it lightly when
her chest rumbled in amusement at your tongue stumbling over the name
"Ylla" - is still unaccountably vivid.  It's not as though
you'd never touched her before, in all kinds of ridiculously
inappropriate ways.  Like that time you'd taken her from behind in
Santa Fe, her body splayed out across a hospital administrator's
desk, and her shouts had - 
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't be thinking about that in Artie's office.  
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
But the point is, that simple contact on the beach in Ohio pales in
comparison to your previous experiences.  Apart from the fact that it
didn't occur under artifact influence, that it came just after you'd
realized that you were rapidly falling in love with her, there's
nothing that should distinguish it from everything else and okay,
fine, even Pete wouldn't be this oblivious.  You're a shy
thirteen-year-old and the pretty girl in math class looked at you and
might even check the yes box on your <i>do-you-like-me</i> note.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
So what happens now?</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Have you found the answer to our mystery artifact problem,
then?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Helena's voice cuts through the still of the office, and you spin in
your chair away from the desk to see the umbilicus door closing
behind her, willing away the blush you feel starting to form. 
"Maybe.  Sorry to make you wait out there so long."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She waves off the half hour she'd whiled away in the South Dakota sun
while you made a trip to the Warehouse floor with a dismissive hand
and leans against the desk next to you.  "No bother.  It gave me
the chance to make a phone call to my lawyer in Paris."  She
brandishes the smartphone Claudia had given her, the bracelet you'd
asked her to wear hanging loosely around her wrist, then tucks it
into her pocket.  "It did take me some time to translate my
computer skills into figuring out how to find him on this, but I
managed."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Knowing Helena, 'some time' corresponded to approximately ten
seconds.  "You have a lawyer in Paris?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her expression clouds over with a sigh.  "The firm I entrusted
to see to Christina's estate."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Oh."  Crap.  "I'm sorry, I didn't - "</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The hand you've awkwardly reached out to her elbow is stilled by one
of hers.  "It's in the past," she says with a feigned
smile, and pats your hand once before pushing off from the desk and
wandering about the office.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You eye her movements carefully.  Artie's office had any number of
odd contraptions that would catch the eye, especially one such as
hers, but one did need to exercise caution.  She'd never had the
chance to explore without Artie's resentful stare at her back; but
now, with him having begun to begrudgingly accept her presence at the
Warehouse - at least enough to trust her to not burn the place down
in your presence while he supervises Pete and Claudia doing inventory
in the comic book aisle to ensure some work actually got done - you
can see her hooded expression gradually become one of genuine delight
as she pokes around and comes across the typewriter that transcribes
its users' thoughts.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Don't get any ideas about that," you warn, fondly
remembering the times Artie's jumbled thought processes became too
much for his ability to convey them to the rest of you.  "Artie
would kick you out for sure.  He loves that thing."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Shame.  It would be quite useful for a writer."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The room falls silent for a moment, your naturally inquisitive mind
wondering what the typewriter had printed but knowing better than to
ask.  "Helena, I was thinking..."  You start, then cut
yourself off, suddenly unsure.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her eyes flash in amusement.  "A dangerous pastime, darling."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Someone around here has to do it," you counter.  An oddly
adorable bark of laughter erupts from her then, and you worry
absently at your knuckles for a moment more before leaning forward in
the chair and addressing her boots.  "I just thought... You
know, Cedar Point was nice, but that was a <i>lot</i> of people, and
it was loud, and a little crazy, and - and <i>loud</i>, and I'm not
much for noisy crowds of people, and I don't think you are either,
and I thought maybe we could just... go somewhere.  Quieter. 
Together."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Helena is silent; when you finally look up it is to find her lips
slowly spreading into a wide smile.  "Are you trying to court
me, Agent Bering?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You don't really know; but if you are, you certainly seem to be doing
a fine job of bungling it.  Suddenly restless, your body surges
forward out of the chair and you take a step toward her before
stopping yourself.  "I don't know.  Maybe.  Yes?  I think..."
  You sigh loudly and fold your arms across your chest - you're a
Secret Service agent, dammit, you shouldn't be getting this
flustered.  "I just want to spend some time with you, Helena. 
Outside of work, and not where people we know are going to demand we
watch movies with them or whatever."  A beat, and you add, "I
mean, we've already had sex six times, I think we should get to know
each other a little more, don't you?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Retroactively try to preserve our honor?"  You bite back a
laugh and nod.  She stalks toward you, then, looking intent, her hand
trailing along the cluttered table beside her and your eyes widen as
they follow its movements.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Helena, stop," you say firmly.  She freezes midmotion,
brow furrowed in question.  You gesture toward her hand on the table.
 "Look."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The gear from Granville's vibrator lies inches from her questing
fingertips; she glances down and recoils with a jerk.  "Why in
God's name is <i>that</i> in Artie's office?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"A test," you explain, pulling a glove from your back
pocket.  "I guess the bracelet still works even with us knowing
about it."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She watches as you drop the gear into the neutralizer bag you'd used
to carry it up from the Warehouse floor.  "So it would seem,"
she agrees, stripping off the bracelet and adding it to the bag you
hold open for her.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I put some other artifacts out too, to see what you'd go for."
 You wander around the office, retrieving the artifacts in question. 
All were fairly harmless, but you'd still made sure Artie was nowhere
near when you borrowed them.  "You went right past them, didn't
even touch the typewriter like I thought you might with or without
the bracelet.  The gear was the only thing it was interested in."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her foot nudges a chair aside and she leans against the table.  "So
we have an artifact that seeks out and induces the use of artifacts,
and it focuses on ones of a sexual nature."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Looks like it."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I learned long ago to never bother wondering what created
certain artifacts," she says resignedly.  "I am somewhat at
a loss to explain how it ended up in my possession, however."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"That's probably something else we should just chalk up to life
as Warehouse agents."  You let the bag fall onto Artie's desk
and peel off your glove.  "What I want to know is, are we...
<i>obligated</i> to use it?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She looks startled at that.  "That is... an interesting
question."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Right?  We're Warehouse agents, we're <i>supposed </i>to snag,
bag, and tag all the artifacts out there that we can, and this thing
practically guides us to them.  Sure, they're maybe not as dangerous
to the world as others, but they're still artifacts."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Myka, I think you're forgetting something."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Artie?  Oh god, Helena, please don't make me tell Artie that
we've been having accidental artifact sex every time we've gone on a
cold case."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She laughs lightly, patting your crossed arms in reassurance.  "I
would no sooner do that to you than allow Pete to come out in the
field with me and the bracelet."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Now <i>there's</i> a terrifying thought.  "Oh crap.  I never
even - Oh god, they can <i>never</i> know about this.  I am <i>not</i>
- there is <i>no way</i> I'm going out there with Pete anywhere <i>near
</i>that thing.  Or, god, <i>Claudia?</i>  She doesn't need that."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Your pacing around the office turns agitated; she steps toward you
and wraps her hands around your forearms.  "Myka," she
begins, her eyes kindly stern.  "We're still not certain that it
will continue to work in the field."  Your mouth opens in
protest, but she forestalls it.  "I was able to prevent myself
from touching the gear once I realized I was about to.  Now that I
know precisely what it is and what it does, I will be constantly wary
of coming into contact with an artifact while wearing the bracelet. 
It's likely that its... unique ability to force me to find an
artifact will be negated."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
It sounds reasonable enough, and you nod slowly, thinking.  "We
need another test.  One more cold case."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Agreed."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You look into her eyes then, her proximity making it incredibly
difficult to force out thoughts of what you've just agreed to
possibly end up doing yet again.  Sweaty, tantalizing, wildly erotic
thoughts.  You lick your lips and take a breath.  "And maybe,
wherever we end up, we can, I don't know, find a museum or something
to visit."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
God, when she smiles, she <i>smiles</i>.  "I think I would enjoy
that."  
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Ignoring the incredible thought that you might have just made a date
out of an artifact retrieval, you move back to Artie's desk and pick
up the neutralizer bag.  "I'll just go put these away before
Artie comes back, then we can figure things out."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Myka."  Your hand stops halfway toward the handle of the
door, and you turn back to her.  She pulls something out of the
pocket of her vest, hesitating for a moment as she examines it. 
"Take this with you."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Moving closer, you see that she is holding a slightly tarnished metal
compact.  She offers it to you and you turn it over, noting the
initials <i>L.A.B.</i> engraved on the surface.  "Helena, what
is this?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Don't open it," she says sharply, and you still your
fingers.  "That is one of the items I took from the Escher
Vault.  I had it on my person just before I was bronzed; I had rather
thought that it would prove useful."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"How?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"It belonged to a woman named Lizzie Borden.  She murdered her
father and stepmother, and looking into its mirror causes you to
commit much the same violence, toward those you love."  Her eyes
become blank, as you've noticed they tend to do when she talks about
her past.  "It was the last artifact I ever retrieved at
Warehouse 12, and I kept it.  I never had a certain use in mind for
it.  Only possibilities, as troubling ideas began to take root in my
mind.  I asked to be bronzed before I could enact any of them.  But
when MacPherson released me, I had had more than a century to..."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her jaw clenches and she looks away briefly before returning her
attention to you.  "Suffice it to say, I no longer want it in my
possession.  Its presence is... disturbing."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
That hadn't really answered your question, and only raised more.  But
you know her well enough to be certain that's all she's ready to say
on the subject, and you push aside the heaviness that has settled in
your chest to give her a small smile.  "I'll take care of it."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her eyes briefly search yours, then she nods once.  "Thank you,
Myka."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">You feel
her eyes on your back as you leave the office, and you can't shake
the feeling that something of great significance has just occurred.</p>

<p align="LEFT">
The eighth time it happens, the artifact retrieval goes without
incident.  Good old fashioned detective work leads you to a pair of
wedding rings in the outskirts of D.C., the artifacts behind a
sketchy report of a wedding turning highly awkward for all involved. 
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Afterward you find yourself lying on the bed in your shared hotel room - the <i>only</i>
bed in your shared hotel room, and you wonder if you have the
bracelet to thank for <i>that</i> - ostensibly reading the <i>Washington
Post</i> for old time's sake. In actuality, you're contemplating where on
Earth you can take Helena on a date that might not be a date but you
think probably is (even if it is a bit late for all that you've
already done) that won't make you feel like the most ridiculous human
being ever for taking a woman from the nineteenth century to see.
An incredulous laugh from the desk where Helena
has been sitting interrupts your thoughts and you look up.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"What is it?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I found our artifact," she explains, gesturing to her
laptop.  "David and Samantha Franklin's wedding rings, first
retrieved in 1937."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You <i>really</i> need to have that talk with Claudia.  There's no
way in hell she should be able to access the Warehouse's database
here, from a laptop, on a hotel Wifi connection.  Ignoring your
reservations about her bad habits you fold the newspaper and toss it
onto the nightstand, giving her your full attention.  "What do
they do?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"It seems that the bracelet does still work, at least in that it
did result in my choosing a sex-related artifact to track down.  I
imagine that's all it will accomplish anymore, given that I didn't
find a way to end up with a ring on my finger."  Her lips quirk
self-deprecatingly at this.  "At any rate, aside from the usual
aphrodisiac effects, the rings seem to result in two individuals who
come into contact with them achieving simultaneous orgasm.  It
appears the Franklins were rather fixated on the idea."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Oh."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Indeed."  The lid of her computer closes with a soft click
and she kneels out of sight on the other side of the desk, rummaging
around in her overnight bag.  "The effect is only achieved if
those involved both touch one ring at the same time, or if they each
wear one.  Of course, if they wear them, they are rather disinclined
to <i>stop </i>having sex.  Which explains the wedding."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"So wait, they were in the Warehouse at one point?"  Helena
stands and nods, then moves off to the sink alcove to wash her hands.
 "I wonder who took them out.  And how they ended up <i>here</i>."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I imagine it was an agent who shared the Franklins' penchant
for mutual satisfaction," she says airily, and turns back to
you.  Her movements are slow and exaggeratedly deliberate as she
steps toward you, picking the neutralizer bag with the rings up off
the desk, and comes to a stop at the edge of the bed.  Her eyes lock
onto yours and you sit up slightly, catching the movement of her
hands in your periphery as she opens the bag and lets one ring fall
out onto her open palm.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You turn your gaze briefly to the gleaming metal in her hand; she
follows suit, then looks back at you, an eyebrow raised.  "Sometimes
I am dreadfully clumsy."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
God, nobody's voice should be able to get that sultry.   "You're
unbelievable," you murmur.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I know."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She's wearing that cocky smile of hers, the one that turns your knees
to jelly and makes your breath hitch.  Her eyes, though, are
almost... nervous, and something in your chest constricts at her
evident vulnerability.  The artifacts have been a crutch, you realize
- a way to get what you want without having to fully acknowledge that
you want it.  You've begun to accept it, even pursue it, but you
wonder if perhaps she hasn't gotten there yet.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You don't need the crutch any longer, but maybe she does.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The muscles of her forearm twitch as you reach out to trace your
fingertips down the length of it.  She gasps slightly, and her pupils
enlarge when your fingers tangle with hers and you trap the ring
between your hands.  The sheets rustle as you kick them out of the
way and pull her down onto the bed with you, and you don't know if
the surge of arousal that courses through you is from the artifact or
the softness of her lips when she kisses you as she settles over you.
 You blindly reach out to toss the ring onto the nightstand and you
feel the tip of her tongue teasing gently against yours.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Hands work at clothing, then, carelessly tossing it aside as they
seek out the familiar flesh underneath and roam over soft curves and
taut muscle, desperate to meld into its warmth but unwilling to focus
on any one patch of skin at the expense of the rest.  Your knee
raises into the air and she settles her hip between yours, your
bodies creating a natural rhythm against each other and you feel your
thigh become slick.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
An arm slips between your neck and the bed, the hand coming around to
grip your opposite shoulder and the bed dips slightly as she shifts
her weight to her forearm.  Her chest arches up over you briefly
before she resettles and then her long fingers are slipping inside
you and you claw at her back in delirious ecstasy before having the
presence of mind to reach between you and return the favor.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The sensation is overwhelming, your brain becoming incapable of
deciphering the impulses being fired along your nerves.  You are
touching and being touched, taking and being taken, the slickness you
feel at your fingertips yours and hers and both, muscles clenching
around fingers that only work more intently inside welcoming heat - 
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She breaks away from the kiss and your head pushes back into the
pillow, exposing the ridges of your throat which she promptly begins
to map with her tongue.  "Oh <i>god</i>, Helena," you
manage, the words a breathless benediction to the ceiling.  Her thigh
comes up behind her arm, giving additional force to her hand as she
moves within you and your hips drive against it.  "<i>God</i>,
Helena, oh <i>fuck - "</i></p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Speech becomes beyond your reach as she takes you to the brink and
far beyond, the artifact or her skill keeping you there impossibly
long and you're writhing against her, your nerves burning patchwork
holes through your skin as the sensations she is causing within you
look for an outlet and are denied.  Your fingers curl all the more
forcefully inside her, and finally she moves away from your throat.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The eyes you look into then are dark with unchecked arousal yet
somehow still blazing with a fire that is doubtless reflected in
yours.  Your lungs scream and you realize you've stopped breathing;
the gulp of air you take then is expelled in a shout from low in your
throat as your spine arches into her and your orgasm tears through
you.  You catch sight of her own release taking her in her eyes and
you've never done this, could never have done this - looked into
someone's eyes as you're both at the height of pleasure by the
other's hand - not even with Sam, but it feels <i>right</i> now, with
this woman, and this woman is - 
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You feel her body tremble beneath the hand clutching her back and she
lets out a choked sob as her head falls onto your shoulder, and your
jaw clenches at the sudden influx of emotion warring with the
continued spasms of your climax.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
 - <i>everything</i>.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
As your muscles descend into pleasure- and exertion-induced
uselessness your fingers fall away from her, hers shortly following
suit and brushing lightly over yours on their way up to your stomach.
 She presses her lips to the skin before her, and her hair obscures
her expression as she makes a trail of delicate kisses over your
chest, down your sternum, and finally comes to rest on her side
against you, her head facing away from you just beneath your breasts.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You watch her rise and fall with your breath, the movements gradually
becoming rhythmic as your nerves calm.  She sighs, a tendril of hair
fluttering into her face and you let your hand fall to her shoulder
when you brush it away.  You feel tension riddling her body, can
sense her need to purge herself of some demon that you suspect she
had begun to cast away the day she returned the compact to the
Warehouse.</p><p align="LEFT">

You had wondered when this would emerge; there was simply no possible
way she could have survived the murder of her daughter, the torture
and death of the killers at her own hand, and a subsequent century
with nothing but her own guilt and grief to keep her company and not
come out damaged.  But whether you should be thankful she has
maintained her aura of utter confidence this long, until you are
ready to be there for her with all that you have to offer, or whether
you should plead for forgiveness for not having been able to help her
heal in the past, you can't say.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Finally her voice breaks through the still in the room.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"You have no idea the depths to which you have affected my soul,
Myka."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Her tone is bleak, so full of despair as to be nearly emotionless. 
Your instinct is to gather her into your arms and try to kiss away
her pain, but you refrain, knowing this is a conversation she needs
to have.  You bite your lip against the stinging at the back of your
eyes.  "So tell me."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p>
Helena's fingertips abruptly finish their wandering dance across your
abdomen, and there is silence for a long moment.  "You have
changed so much more than you realize, simply by being who you are,"
she finally murmurs into your navel.  Another sigh passes between her
lips and she continues.  "The last time I told someone I loved
them was more than a century ago, and I wasn't even in my own body. 
And she was already dead."  
</p><p align="LEFT">
Before you can attempt to respond, she has turned to face you, still
resting against your stomach, and you are unsurprised to find her
eyes glistening as she looks up at you.  "It's not something I
shall ever truly move past, nor do I believe I would want to.  But
you..."  Her eyebrows raise helplessly, a tearful smile gracing
her lips.  "You make me want to try."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You can't stop yourself then; with an arm around her waist and a hand
at her neck you haul her body over yours and crush your lips
together, trying to convey with your kiss all the words of comfort
you know you would only mangle if you tried to express them.  She
pulls away after several desperate moments and you close your eyes to
catch your breath.  "Helena, I...  I won't say it, if you need
me not to.  But I want you to know that I can - I... I <i>do</i>, so
much..."  You cut yourself off, feeling somewhat like an idiot.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She laughs, not in amusement, but in apparent self-loathing.  "You
may wish to revise your opinion of me," she mutters, rolling off
to the side.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You follow, wrapping your body around hers, your chest pressed
against her back.  "I doubt that."  A hand captures hers
and you plant a soft kiss to the knuckles.  "What's this about,
Helena?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She shudders and speaks into the pillow, almost to herself.  "The
things I was planning to do, and the actions I was prepared to take
to accomplish them..."  Her hand pulls away, tucking itself
between the bed and her ribcage.  "I don't know that you can
handle knowing what I am capable of."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p>
"Whatever it was, you didn't do it.  You're <i>not</i> capable
of it."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Silence falls between you again as she gathers her thoughts.  Your
thumb grazes idly over her abdomen, and finally she takes a breath. 
"I told you once that I had become quite mad, before asking to
be bronzed in one of my increasingly rare moments of lucidity. I
asked never to be awoken, as I knew that I would only have descended
further into the darkness of my own mind, as surely a madwoman must
when left with nothing but the company of her own thoughts.  My
concerns were proven correct."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
She pauses, and you're about to ask what she means when her voice
forestalls the question.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I was going to destroy the world."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
Were it anyone else, in any other profession, you'd think they were
exaggerating.  But you know her, and you know the Warehouse, and you
have no doubt that she is completely sincere.  You reach down and tug
her hand free, tightly entwining your fingers.  "What changed
your mind?"</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"I met you," she says simply.  "The thought of harming
you became quite distasteful."  She pauses, then adds, "And
seeing dear Claudia, and her sweet innocence, and even Pete in his
way...  I would have destroyed you, your family...  In time, I simply
found that I could not."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
"Then how is this a bad thing?  You're healing, Helena." 
She shifts slowly in your arms, turning around to face you, and you
press a soft kiss to her lips.  "I'm going to be here to help
you, any way you need."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
A breath of air flows softly over your skin as Helena buries her head
between the pillow and your shoulders.  "You make the world seem
not such a frightful place, Myka."</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
The exhaustion spreading throughout her body is a palpable thing; you
roll onto your back, pulling her along with you, and reach out to
rescue a sheet from the floor.  You drape it over your bodies to
block the slight chill of the autumn night and draw her closer as she
succumbs to sleep, watching the play of light from the window across
her features as the world outside carries on, oblivious to the
retribution nearly wrought upon it by the woman in your arms.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
You're not certain how to process the fact that you were all that
prevented it.  It's clear that her demons are more pervasive than
simple mourning left to fester over more than a century, and the
darkness that plagues her won't be conquered with one wrenching
confession.  She has only begun to heal; the impulses that compelled
her to bring about the destruction of the world are still there, and
you're the only thing standing in their way.  It's an unbelievable
responsibility.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
But you love her, and it's a burden you will gladly bear.</p><p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">The first
time it happens, Helena's soft cries echo through your room at the
bed and breakfast as you whisper into her ear, all thoughts of
artifacts and the Warehouse and sins of the past lying forgotten in
their wake.</p>
