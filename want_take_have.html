<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>Agatha ends up seeing one of Rio’s videos for the first time on a Friday afternoon, sprawled across the couch for her usual post-work decompression doom-scroll.</p><p> </p><p>Various attempts at the newest trend have been filling her feed for days—women, mostly, leaning back to dance suggestively against a wall to the catchy, pulsing beat of some instrumental version of a popular song. At this point, Agatha’s tapped out enough to swipe as soon as she hears the first familiar notes, but something about this woman’s video stops her cold instead.</p><p> </p><p>(<em>Something</em> being the low-slung sweatpants, the cropped white tank top, the faint lines of her abs, the myriad tattoos—especially the stunning florals wrapped around her slender throat.)</p><p> </p><p>The woman—Rio, according to the bottom of the page—pulls off the dance with casual confidence, every motion the perfect balance of snappy and soft. Her movements are eye-catching and strangely elegant in spite of their overt raunchiness, and the way she smirks and bites her lip towards the end as she starts moving towards the camera is (unfortunately for Agatha’s increasingly fraught impulse control) devastatingly attractive.</p><p> </p><p>Not yet wanting to head to the next video but unable to justify lingering otherwise, Agatha taps to open the comment section as the music continues to play.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off,” Agatha mutters, gnawing at the nail of her left thumb as she scrolls through dozens of thirsty, desperate comments beneath Rio’s video.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><em>PLEASEEEEE be wuh luh wuh</em>, reads one, from user <b>caitvi</b>✰ with a cartoon profile picture of some blue-haired girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. Still, she keeps swiping.</p><p> </p><p><em>any way you want me daddy</em>, reads another, from user <b>bethsharmon </b>♟️, a television reference that Agatha actually does happen to recognize.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus fucking Christ. These people are unhinged,” Agatha whispers to herself, finger hovering over the glowing screen. She doesn’t know why she feels so unsettled—or so possessive—over a random stranger’s viral dance video. Whatever.</p><p> </p><p>In a rare moment of weakness, Agatha hits the save button to add it to her private collection before quickly exiting the app.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>No one has to know.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Saturday rolls around gracelessly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crawls out of bed nearer to noon than she’d ever like to admit. She stumbles towards the kitchen in pursuit of water with her phone in hand and groggy eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Never again,” she groans, glaring murderously at the empty bottle of wine taunting her from the countertop, waiting to be recycled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>This, of course, is a lie. Agatha spends almost every Friday night exactly the same way—polishing off the bottle that she’ll cave and buy and crack open on Tuesday. Or Wednesday, if the first two days of her work week somehow aren’t complete and utter hell. The misery of Agatha’s job is slowly but surely driving her towards the precipice of developing a dangerous weekend binge-drinking habit. Beyond the grave, Evanora is probably cackling from somewhere—fingers crossed—hot and hopelessly wretched.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shuffles outside to toss the bottle in the bins by her garage, cursing the sunlight for daring to blind her as she goes.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey there, neighbor!” Comes the chirpy voice of one Sharon Davis, the overly friendly woman who lives right next door. Fuck. Agatha had wanted to speed-run her walk of shame in solitude. Sharon giggles and nods towards the bottle that Agatha’s still holding by the neck, frozen mid-throw. The cheery sound grates at Agatha’s ears <em>and</em> nerves. “Had a fun night, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Peachy,” Agatha grits out, lobbing the empty none too gently into the recycling bin at last. “Have a nice day.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, with a quick wave, she hurries back inside before Sharon can attempt to lure her into having an actual conversation. No matter how much she’s tempted, Agatha just can’t bring herself to be genuinely mean towards Sharon. Brusque? Sure. Avoidant? Why not. But cruel enough to put an end to the polite, neighborly niceties between them? Never. After all, the other woman had been kinder to Agatha than anyone else had been in the wake of her mother’s demise.</p><p> </p><p>There had been casseroles, freezer meals, and even a sincere offer to help go through Evanora’s things while cleaning the house. Agatha had done her best to reciprocate Sharon’s efforts a little less than two years later when Mr. Davis had passed away. Now here they are, stuck in the weird limbo of not being real friends despite having tried to help one another through significant loss—in which, naturally, all fault lies with Agatha’s barbed, unwelcoming self.</p><p> </p><p>So: back to Agatha’s cotton-mouthed hangover.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha guzzles down a glass of water, breathes, then reaches for the tap of the kitchen sink and starts drinking directly from the cool, steady stream that emerges until her thirst is slaked. After that she heads for the fridge, where she roots around the shelves in search of edible leftovers. A third of a container of broccoli beef and half a carton of chow mein are what she comes away with. Solid score. Agatha eats both foods cold, standing upright by the marble island in the center of the room. With her phone flat on its surface, Agatha scrolls through TikTok using the knuckles of her fork-holding hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The algorithm doesn’t take long to bring Rio to the fore again. This time, she’s doing the “sticky” dance challenge, wearing a fitted black tank top that’s been allowed to ride up, exposing a tantalizing sliver of skin, and yet another pair of those ridiculously low-slung sweatpants. Less of Rio’s tattoos are left on view this way, but the filming angle does afford Agatha a better opportunity to stare at the largest one along the line of her throat. Agatha kind of wants to know what those sprawling florals would look like in flashes between her fingers, with her hand wrapped around—<em>nope</em>. Nope, not going there. Agatha jabs the knuckle of her index finger towards the side of the screen. Another video, another trip through the sea of horny comments. Surely a bit of time spent judging others for their public displays of depravity will ease Agatha’s own internal struggles.</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, they don’t disappoint.</p><p> </p><p><em>born to ride, forced to scroll</em> 😔</p><p> </p><p>
<em>daddy rio i suck AND swallow jsyk ;)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>flash us and ill never ask for anything ever again i promise…</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>it IS getting pretty sticky baby let me clean you up with my tongue </em>🙂‍↔️</p><p> </p><p>
<em>let me spit on it and lick it up pls pls pls</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen spectacularly at the audacity of Rio’s most fervent fans.</p><p> </p><p>“Whaaat the actual <em>fuck</em>,” she murmurs, dismissing the comments and continuing let the video play out. “Freaks,” she adds, even though part of her privately agrees with a few of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha, damningly, adds this video of Rio’s to her favorites too.</p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It seriously <em>does not</em> matter.</p><p> </p><p>At all. Full stop. Period.</p><p> </p><p>(Except for the fact that it does. Fuck.)</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t let herself hit the follow button.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>That would be needy and desperate and probably super fucking weird of her. She’s a random woman in New Jersey who’s got absolutely no business following the page of some dancing lesbian messiah on the internet.</p><p> </p><p>What she does do, however, is save every single video of Rio’s that comes across her feed to her very select and discerning folder of favorites.

She’s whip-smart and acerbically funny and just a little bit mean in a way that makes Agatha feel less alone in her off-putting prickliness.

Single, out and proud lesbian, twenty-eight years of age. Not that Agatha cares enough to have dug any of that up, of course. No, this had all been easily sourced information available right from the woman’s public profile page.</p><p> </p><p>Though Kayla still comments regularly on many of Rio’s posts, and occasionally receives friendly replies, there have been no serious direct online interactions between her and Rio since the initial video that led to the development of the series. Thank God. Bitch.)</p><p> </p><p>Today, Agatha had been eating her lunch—a delicious homemade Greek salad—while watching Rio talk about her day and enjoy a bowl of pollo guisado on the screen, when all hell broke loose. Wanda, who’s apparently allergic to knocking now, had burst into Agatha’s office without warning and clocked her choice of mealtime entertainment immediately. By the time Agatha had managed to hit the power button on her phone, it was already far too late.</p><p> </p><p>The look Wanda shoots her is sickeningly sad. Pitying, even, as if Agatha’s the owner of an injured pet that some veterinarian version of Wanda in a twisted alternate universe is about to tell her needs to be put down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>(Señor Scratchy is in perfect health, thank you very much, and will go on to significantly outlive Agatha herself if she’s got anything to say about it.)</p><p> </p><p>“You know you’re always welcome to have lunch with me, right? If you’re ever feeling lonely?” Wanda says, kindly and sincerely. Agatha almost murders her in cold blood right then and there. “Mental health matters.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m on break,” Agatha grits out, gripping her fork for dear life. If her self-control slips even a fraction more, Wanda’s going to end up missing an eye—and Agatha’s not feeling choosy about which one. “Please leave.”</p><p> </p><p>Wisely, Wanda quickly hurries out of the room, shutting the door behind her with a final, decisive thud.</p><p> </p><p>Alone again, Agatha sighs. Considers the state of her life. Then she turns her phone back on, unlocks it, and hits play on the paused video.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s low, soothing voice fills the room once more.</p><p> </p><p>“—so my friend Billy and I went over to the mall—”</p><p> </p><p>The earlier tension drains out of Agatha’s shoulders and nerves as she continues listening to Rio speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Finally, some peace and quiet.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Everything goes terribly, awfully, irredeemably wrong on a random Wednesday in March.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s at the second nearest Whole Foods to her house—the first just kept stocking subpar produce, in her humble opinion—when the universe decides that she hasn’t suffered enough for its liking in a good, long while. She’s trying to grab a box of her favorite chocolate wafers, all of which have unfortunately been relocated to a shelf that she’s just about an inch too short to properly reach, when someone else leans over to snag it instead.</p><p> </p><p>“Here,” comes an all too familiar voice, prompting Agatha to consider dropping dead on the spot from sheer horror as she slowly turns around. <em>Rio</em> from <em>TikTok</em> is holding Agatha’s box of wafers out towards her, smiling amiably as she waits for Agatha to take it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Wide-eyed and white-knuckling the straps of her bunny-covered reusable bag, Agatha gives a wheezy, wordless squeak in response. Then she keeps on wheezing. Wait—oh, <em>no</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns. “Hey, are you okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, who diligently maintains a prescription for an inhaler that she rarely ever has to use for the asthma she thought she’d basically outgrown, suddenly realizes that she actually isn’t okay. Shit. She shoves one hand into her grocery tote and starts blindly digging around for her essentials pouch. Her airways squeeze and spasm harder. Great. Now Agatha’s barely getting any oxygen.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh shit,” Rio exclaims, dropping the wafers and making a desperate grab for Agatha’s upper arms as a surge of adrenaline makes her tremble. “Help!”</p><p> </p><p><em>Idiot</em>, Agatha thinks as her fingers finally close around a familiar plastic shape. She rips the cap off of the mouthpiece and sucks in a spray of medication, hating the bitter taste. <em>I can still fucking stand</em>.</p><p> </p><p>After a few seconds, some of the tightness in her chest begins to ease. Agatha doesn’t bother shaking Rio’s grip off as she focuses on steadying her breathing. She inhales another puff of albuterol beneath Rio’s watchful gaze as an employee comes sprinting down the aisle.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s going on? Is everything okay over here?” The man calls out as he approaches, eyes briefly ping-ponging between the two of them before he clearly decides the best course of action is to address Rio. “Miss, is your girlfriend having a medical emergency? Should we call an ambulance?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha rasps, shrugging off Rio’s hands as she pockets her inhaler and takes a big step back. After a second, Agatha takes another step back. Both Rio and the employee keep looking at her fearfully, as if she might fall down at any minute. “I was startled, but it’s just asthma. And she’s not my girlfriend. Thanks for the concern, but I’m fine now.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, with the last remaining shreds of her tattered dignity, Agatha spins on her heel and walks off before either of them can speak.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hurries to the self-checkout area, where she scans her items with brisk and clinical efficiency. Forget the fucking wafers, forget her usual bottle of less than shitty wine, forget anything else on her list. She needs to get the hell out of here, go home, delete TikTok, and never let herself think about Rio ever again.</p><p> </p><p>All in that order.</p><p> </p><p>Pronto.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Hey!” Calls a distant voice in the parking lot, barely audible over the rustling spring breeze. Never one to stick her nose in what could be a potentially physical argument between strangers, Agatha doesn’t look up at the sound. Not her circus, not her monkeys. “Hey, lady! In the purple! With asthma!”</p><p> </p><p>Fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>So it is her circus after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Or, at least, her goddamn monkey.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cranes her head to look over her shoulder and is greeted by the sight of Rio jogging across the asphalt, beelining towards her.</p><p> </p><p>“You forgot your cookies,” Rio says by way of explanation, holding out the same box that she’d tried to pass Agatha before. Agatha eyes the offered package warily. “I’m sorry for stressing you out back there. That was my bad.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’re wafers,” Agatha points out, just to be difficult. It’s her nature; she can’t help it. When Agatha Harkness is poked, she pokes back harder, and she’s feeling pretty damn well prodded right now. “Not cookies.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t flinch at the correction. Instead, she flashes an oddly indulgent half-smile in Agatha’s direction, as if her contrariness is somehow endearing rather than simply being repellent. Ugh. What a weirdo.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Wafers, then. Here. Please.” She gives the box a small, indicative shake. “I got them for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes the wafers, and Rio’s smile widens victoriously, turning full and bright. Jesus, nobody should look even better in real life than they do on camera. The tattoo on her neck is even more vividly beautiful in person. This is wildly unfair.</p><p> </p><p>“… Thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>After her grudging expression of gratitude, Agatha waits for Rio to leave. She doesn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>With slightly narrowed eyes and a curious crinkle of her nose that Agatha—with a hot flush of shame and something else suddenly burning through her veins—recognizes, Rio merely continues to speak.</p><p> </p><p>“My pleasure. Listen, have we met before? I don’t know why, but you look <em>really</em> familiar to me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope,” Agatha instantly replies, shaking her head for extra emphasis. “Definitely not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, well, I was wondering—”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio does this cute, ridiculous, puppy-like head tilt of confusion that Agatha also recognizes. How unfortunate.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t… wonder?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t say whatever you were about to say to me, okay? No need to ruin the moment. You scared me, you apologized, you heard me say thank you. Not many do. Brava. Let’s end our interaction on a high note.” Pulse thundering so loudly that she can hear it, Agatha pivots and strides off to her car, tossing a final farewell over her shoulder as she goes. “Good night, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s just hopping into the driver’s seat when Rio’s voice rings out again.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! Wait. I never told you my name. Do you watch my—“</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slams the car door closed and jabs at the ignition, gunning the engine loudly. Rather than waiting for her car to warm up properly, she immediately peels off, heart lodged firmly in her too-tight throat.</p><p> </p><p>That settles it. She’s never coming back to this Whole Foods again. Maybe the first one’s produce isn’t as bad as she’d previously thought.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>After resolving to never open TikTok again, it only takes Agatha two days to crack and return to the app.</p><p> </p><p>In her defense, Agatha hasn’t been able to properly relax since Wednesday night. Since that whole mess was Rio’s fault in the first place, it’s only right that she’s involved in fixing it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>After nearly a dozen fruitless scrolls—her fyp is failing her, typical—Agatha rolls her eyes and types Rio’s name in the search bar, clicking on her profile as soon as it comes up at the top of the screen.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha’s at work when she gets the notification.</p><p> </p><p><em>blackheartgreenthumb</em> <b> followed you.</b> <b></b></p><p> </p><p>And then, horrifyingly, every subsequent one.</p><p> </p><p><b>rio</b> <b></b></p><p>boo</p><p> </p><p><b>rio</b> <b></b></p><p>its me :)</p><p> </p><p><b>rio</b> <b></b></p><p>… agatha?</p><p> </p><p><b>rio</b> <b></b></p><p>hey :(</p><p> </p><p>Agatha suddenly remembers, with spine-chilling clarity, that profile views are a thing people can see. Fuck. What sick sadist invented <em>that</em> inane feature? It’s not something she ever really thought about much, considering the fact that she never posts, rarely follows, and barely likes—therefore getting little to no traffic on her own page.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately for Agatha’s chances at experiencing serious respiratory distress again, Rio’s clearly much more tech savvy. Agatha never should’ve used a real face picture for her profile. Those random cartoon pfp users have clearly been the true geniuses of social media this entire time. With a strange, floaty sensation turning her brain into soupy, nonfunctional mush, Agatha pulls up the message thread with shaky fingers.</p><p> </p><p><b>agatha</b> <b></b></p><p>what.</p><p> </p><p>There.

</p><p>i am prepared to offer you more wafers in exchange for giving me this opportunity to make amends 🥺</p><p> </p><p>Utterly dumbfounded, Agatha stares at the screen in silence. Pure, petrified silence. A round of knocking on her door pushes her train of thought even further from the tracks.</p><p> </p><p>“Come in,” she calls somewhat faintly, flipping her phone over to rest face-down on the desk as the unit supervisor, Lilia Calderu, enters the room. “What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m here about your leave,” Lilia says, shutting the door and turning to face Agatha with an uncharacteristically severe expression.</p><p> </p><p>“My what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Precisely,” Lilia replies with great aplomb, like a lunatic. “You haven’t taken a vacation in ages. Not even a single sick day since your mandated bereavement leave four years ago. Enough is enough.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fairly gapes at the older woman.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>What fresh hell is taking over her life today?</p><p> </p><p>“Your vacation time rolls over, you know. This company believes in the benefits of prioritizing employee satisfaction. We care about your well-being. You need to take a break.”</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia, I really don’t think—”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s exactly what you need to do,” Lilia declares, smacking her palm on Agatha’s desk to underscore her nonsensical words. “Stop thinking so much. As of today, you’re officially on leave. Paid, of course. You have enough time stocked up that even the head of HR has begun expressing concern. So consider this a mandatory vacation. It’s for your own good.”</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha’s mouth keeps hanging open any longer, she’ll be at real risk of catching flies.</p><p> </p><p>“For how long?” She splutters, waving a hand at her computer screen. “I have clients, projects, deadlines—”</p><p> </p><p>“And many capable coworkers who are happy to pick up the slack until your return.” Lilia straightens her shoulders and tosses her head imperiously. “Pack your things, Harkness. I don’t want to see you in office for at <em>least</em> the next three weeks.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, with a needlessly dramatic flip of her shawl, the escaped asylum patient that Agatha calls her boss flounces off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzes with a new notification. Dazed and full of inexplicable dread, Agatha unlocks her phone.</p><p> </p><p><b>rio</b> <b></b></p><p>have you ever been to the witches road???</p><p> </p><p>Like everyone else around her has apparently decided to do today, Agatha decides to throw all sense of caution out the window.</p><p> </p><p><b>agatha</b> <b></b></p><p>fine. yes, i have. i’ll meet you there at eight tomorrow. bring wafers. don’t be late.</p><p> </p><p><b>rio</b> <b></b></p><p>:D :D :D</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>When Saturday evening rolls around, Agatha seriously considers deleting her already sparse social media presence, quitting her job, changing her name, and relocating to some small Scandinavian town that no one’s ever heard of before. Because she’s not a total loser, however, or a total coward, Agatha ultimately doesn’t end up going down that (exceedingly tempting) path.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, dressed in a black leather jacket and jeans that perfectly hug the curve of her ass, is already waiting out on the sidewalk when Agatha arrives at the bar.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, stranger,” she says, dark eyes glimmering prettily in the golden lamplight as Agatha draws near. A Whole Foods tote hangs from the hand that Rio sticks out as soon as Agatha’s in arm’s reach. “These are for you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was just kidding about these,” Agatha replies, spotting at least eight packages of wafers as she peers into the bag.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t. Shall we go inside?”</p><p> </p><p>Infuriatingly, Rio insists on holding the door for Agatha to step through. Stupid mind-numbingly attractive chivalrous lesbian.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha kinda wants to <strike>kiss</strike> kill her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Yup. Definitely kill her.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“So what do you do?” Rio asks, once they’re seated at one of the booths towards the back just waiting on their drinks. Red wine for Agatha and a beer for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>This makes Agatha laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“At the moment? Nothing.” At Rio’s curious, prompting look, Agatha elaborates. “I’ve been put on leave. It’s mandatory. Paid, but mandatory. My boss thinks I need to relax more, so I guess you could say I’m trapped in an adult version of a time-out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Damn. For how long?”</p><p> </p><p>“Three weeks, apparently. Then she says we can reevaluate things. Lilia’s always been a bit of a meddler.”</p><p> </p><p>“Calderu?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns, taken aback.</p><p> </p><p>“You know her?”</p><p> </p><p>“Gray hair, funky shawls, loves tarot?”</p><p> </p><p>“… Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods and smiles.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s my friend Alice’s godmother. Small world.”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, it couldn’t possibly get any fucking smaller. Agatha clears her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you do, then? When you’re not…”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh TikTok?” Rio’s pleased expression takes on a wicked edge. Thankfully, she doesn’t leave Agatha floundering for long. “I’m a botanist. I work in a lab.”</p><p> </p><p>By the time their drinks do arrive, conversation is flowing smoothly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha learns that Rio’s an only child as well, and she happens to have a fantastic relationship with her parents—unlike Agatha, who’s happily outlived both of hers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s also an avid reader, a fan of cheesy holiday movies, and the dorkiest hot person that Agatha’s ever come across.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>For her part, Agatha’s forced to fess up to having a fondness for furry creatures, admits her abiding interest in the history of the Salem witch trials, and is coaxed into telling the story of the time she’d tried to sled down a snowy hill with some fellow neighborhood kids. Agatha had ended up severely dislocating her left shoulder after crashing right into someone’s backyard fence.</p><p> </p><p>“We should do this again,” Rio insists as they head out, rosy-cheeked and grinning widely. “I know you’ve got the free time now. Give me your number and I promise to make it worth your while.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, who hasn’t really hung out with anybody on a regular basis since college, hesitates to agree. What if tonight was a major fluke, and Rio simply gets bored of her company?</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand snakes out to grab her wrist and squeeze, the touch light and reassuring.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on. What’s it going to take for you to say yes?” Rio uses her chin to gesture towards the stuffed grocery bag swinging from the crook of Agatha’s elbow. “More wafers? Because I can get you more wafers.”</p><p> </p><p>As she stares into Rio’s warmly earnest eyes, the last of Agatha’s wavering resistance crumbles.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Spending time with Rio rapidly becomes the highlight of Agatha’s strictly enforced break from work.</p><p> </p><p>Rio invites her over for snacks and board games on Monday night, cajoles her into trying a new bubble tea spot during Rio’s lunch hour on Thursday, then somehow manages to wrangle Agatha into agreeing to go hiking on Sunday while they’re having drinks at the bar on Friday.</p><p> </p><p>The hike, to Agatha’s shock and horror, actually ends up being <em>fun</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>So does the escape room that Rio begs her to try, as well as the murder mystery dinner party they sign up to attend in the city together.</p><p> </p><p>It’s downright occult.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It’s witchcraft.</p><p> </p><p>It’s just <em>Rio</em>.</p><p> </p><p>On a completely unrelated note, Agatha also happens to stop feeling the gnawing urge to make any of her usual stress-induced mid-week wine runs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Huh. Go figure.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Whenever they’re not together, Agatha shamelessly falls back into her habit of consuming everything that Rio posts online. Maybe it’s weird, and maybe she should be tired of seeing Rio’s face at all hours, but Agatha’s a grown ass woman who can decide what she wants to do with her time.</p><p> </p><p>Kayla from Missouri continues to make a damn fool of herself in Rio’s comment section.</p><p> </p><p><em>sooooooo good</em>, she raves below one of Rio’s newer videos, where Rio takes on choreographer Todd Williamson’s dance challenge to a Justin Bieber song, <em>i just love the way you move</em> 😍</p><p> </p><p>An evil, unhinged part of Agatha wants to find this woman’s address and sic a SWAT team on the thirsty slut. The marginally saner side of Agatha decides to test the waters by posting her own comment instead. She and Rio, well—they’re friends, right? Friends comment on each other’s socials all the time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha writes a simple <em>teach me?</em> under the video and waits. It doesn’t take long for her phone to chime with several new notifications.</p><p> </p><p><b>rio</b> liked your comment.</p><p> </p><p><b>rio</b> replied to your comment: <em>name the time and place xxx</em></p><p> </p><p><b>excellentboiledpotatoes</b> replied to your comment: <em>what the fuck she actually liked AND replied!!! YO WHO ARE YOU?!?!</em></p><p> </p><p><b>pinkponyclubbing</b> replied under your comment: <em>bro she also FOLLOWS her!!!! miss agatha whoever tf, you’re one lucky bitch</em> 😫😩</p><p> </p><p><b>saltseasunxo</b> replied under your comment: <em>PLEASE GOD IT SHOULD’VE BEEN MEEEEEEE</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins and swipes out of the app as more and more comments start pouring in.</p><p> </p><p>Take <em>that</em>, Kayla from goddamn Missouri.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Eat your fucking heart out.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Towards the end of Agatha’s impromptu sabbatical, they end up stargazing on the porch of Rio’s backyard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, vaguely inebriated just from being in especially close proximity to Rio tonight—dressed in boy shorts and a tank top that’s revealing a truly dizzying amount of ink-covered skin—finally succumbs to the siren-song of desire winding around her bones.</p><p> </p><p>“Will you kiss me?” Agatha surprises herself by even asking the question. It’s the most honest, forward thing she’s said in literal years.</p><p> </p><p>Clearly stunned, Rio just looks up at her with those big brown doe eyes for a decent while. As the seconds tick by, some of Agatha’s confidence falters.</p><p> </p><p>“Or not,” she starts to say, except she doesn’t get to say anything past ‘or’ before Rio’s straddling her thighs and kissing her senseless.</p><p> </p><p>“What took you so long?” Rio breathes the words out between frantic, devouring presses of their mouths and testing, exploring slides of their tongues. “Started to think you were going to make me sit and want you forever.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finds that she doesn’t have an answer. Only heady, intoxicating pleasure remains, threading thickly through her blood.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Afterwards, despite being well and truly fucked out of her mind, Agatha’s thoughts find the wherewithal to take a nasty, predictable turn. In the bedroom, she lies helplessly awake beside a dozing Rio, staring blankly up at the ceiling while imagining every possible way this could go wrong.</p><p> </p><p>This was such a bad idea. What the hell had Agatha been thinking? Oh God, their friendship’s never going to recover from this. Agatha’s going to die friendless and alone fifty years from now and Señor Scratchy’s going to end up starving too because he can’t even eat her body like a cat would—</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice, raspy from sleep, interrupts her panic spiral.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>“… Yes?”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop freaking out. If you sneak off in the middle of the night, I’ll be very disappointed not to have the chance to wake you up in the morning. Preferably with my mouth, just so you understand the loss.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” <em>Oh</em>. Agatha tries very hard not to press her thighs together at the thought. She mostly succeeds. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>A single honey-brown eye cracks halfway open to peer at her curiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“‘Okay’ as in you understand and are planning to leave anyways, or ‘okay’ as in you’ll let me wake you up by eating you out tomorrow? There’s a pretty important distinction between the two options that I’m looking at here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Um. The second one,” Agatha replies. Then, because she’s got a chronic case of foot-in-mouth disease, she says, “Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>At this, Rio huffs out a quiet laugh and reaches out to sling an arm around Agatha’s waist. She uses this hold to pull her close effortlessly. While shifting to lie flat on her back, Rio urges Agatha nearer until she’s basically using Rio’s shoulder as a pillow.</p><p> </p><p>“My pleasure,” Rio murmurs, arranging both arms around Agatha to keep her firmly in place. Agatha couldn’t possibly wriggle out of this embrace without waking Rio up even if she tried. Hey, wait a minute—Rio presses a quick kiss to the top of Agatha’s head, mussing her hair and cutting any protests off at the root. “Just taking precautions.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio lives up to her word in spectacular fashion.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, somehow, doesn’t wake up until she’s more than halfway to coming, when two of Rio’s fingers sheath themselves in her dripping cunt, curling as Rio continues to lick calmly at her swollen clit.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha moans, trying to buck her hips and failing because of the way Rio’s left forearm is splayed across her lower belly, securely pinning her down. She can’t move, she can barely breathe, all that’s really left for Agatha to do is to fist the sheets and fucking <em>take it</em>. “Oh my God. <em>Rio</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gives a contented little hum before briefly pulling her mouth away, crooking her fingers where they remain inside and rubbing steadily at Agatha’s pulsing walls to soothe her loss as she goes.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, baby?” Rio blinks up at Agatha far too innocently for a woman covered nose to neck in her shining slick from eating Agatha out in her sleep for who knows how long, the motherfucker. “What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>Squirming where she lays, Agatha growls.</p><p> </p><p>“If you don’t put your mouth back on me, I—“ Agatha can’t keep herself from yelping loudly as Rio almost instantly obeys, flashing a devilish smirk before ducking down between Agatha’s thighs and sucking Agatha’s clit into her mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It feels like whole room is spinning. Scratch that, maybe the entire world is spinning and Agatha’s the only still point in the middle of it all. Agatha’s heart rate skyrockets as her breathing quickens, matching the furiously electric rush of blood in her veins. When Rio does something with both her tongue <em>and</em> her fingers that Agatha’s never felt before in her life, it’s game over. Agatha tips head over heels into a fierce climax with a startled cry, gushing her release.</p><p> </p><p>That’s also <em>definitely</em> never happened before. What in the fuck?</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” she gasps, still trembling through the aftershocks. “Sorry, sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio just groans and keeps lapping at Agatha’s cunt, drawing out her fingers only to replace them with her tongue. It doesn’t take Agatha very long to reach her peak again, coming almost as hard as she did the first time, much to Rio’s very vocal and <em>very</em> evident delight.</p><p> </p><p>“You were so good for me, pretty girl,” Rio pants, eyes nearly black with desire. She crawls back up the bed to straddle Agatha and pull her into a messy, filthy kiss. A furious blush heats Agatha’s cheeks at the taste of herself on Rio’s eager tongue. Rio’s hands keep cupping her face as the kiss ends. “Don’t ever be sorry. I want you to come on my face like that every single time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha manages a jerky nod. What the hell else is she supposed to do but agree?</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Over breakfast, Agatha retreats into herself.</p><p> </p><p>She fidgets in her seat at the kitchen table, barely looking up to watch as Rio putters around, moving gracefully between the stove and the fridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The thing is, Agatha’s never been very good at maintaining relationships. Growing up, she’d drowned herself in schoolwork, clubs, volunteering. Anything to get out and stay out of her mother’s house. In college, she hadn’t really tried to break out of her shell, or those habits. The few friends she’d managed to make stayed in touch, but with real world responsibilities, Agatha hasn’t actually seen any of them in person in months.</p><p> </p><p>As an adult, Agatha decided she was probably too set in her ways to ever truly change, so she’d doubled down on hardening her walls, falling back on the safety of solitude by chasing others away. When Evanora had finally passed, and circumstance had dragged Agatha back to the childhood home that she couldn’t bring herself to sell and—<em>at last</em>—escape, well… Agatha had then quietly resigned herself to a lonely life, a lonely death, and having Señor Scratchy serve as her only source of true companionship.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was a break in the pattern that Agatha had established for herself, a cosmic disturbance in the carefully woven canvas of monotonous misery that Agatha’s entire existence had previously composed of.</p><p> </p><p>Now what?</p><p> </p><p>Last night had been amazing, and this morning even better, but… Would Rio actually want to stick around for the long run?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s own father certainly hadn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The man had turned tail and vanished before Agatha was even old enough to hold onto any memories of him. All he’d left her after passing away somewhere in Florida while Agatha was still in middle school was a sizable inheritance she’d received upon her eighteenth birthday.</p><p> </p><p>The sizzling of eggs hitting a hot pan breaks through the dark haze of Agatha’s thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“Scrambled alright with you?” Rio asks as she looks over her shoulder, mushroom-painted spatula in hand. Something on Agatha’s face must give her away, because Rio’s flicking off the stove and setting the pan on one of the unused burners before Agatha can even answer. “Sweetheart, you okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Is this real?” Agatha blurts out, sounding awfully needy and hating herself for it. “Us, I mean. What are we? Specifically.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t believe she’s turned into the kind of woman who spouts lines from the cheesy movies that Rio likes so much. What the hell is wrong with her?</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s entire body seems to soften with understanding. Concern flickers in her honey-brown eyes as she walks towards the table.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course this is real. I want you for as long as you’ll have me, and I’ll accept whatever you want to call that.” Rio crouches down to take both of Agatha’s hands into her own, gently resting their entwined hands on Agatha’s knees. “Where is this coming from, baby?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers flex without permission, tightening around Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t—I’ve just never done anything like this before. And I just want to be sure,” Agatha admits rather wetly, mildly appalled to find herself blinking back tears. She tilts her chin down to stare into her lap as the truth works its way free from her bleeding heart. “I kind of really like you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lets go of Agatha’s hands in order to cup her cheeks instead. The press of Rio’s fingers wordlessly prompts Agatha to look up and meet Rio’s calm, unflinching gaze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Hey there,” she begins, punctuating the phrase with a quick kiss to Agatha’s half-parted lips.</p><p> </p><p>After, Rio presses her mouth to the tip of Agatha’s nose, then the bridge of it, before moving to the crease between her brows until Agatha relaxes. Then Rio’s pretty much just kissing Agatha all over her face.</p><p> </p><p>It’s ridiculous. It’s wonderful.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally leans away, she’s smiling so sweetly that Agatha can’t help but smile back.</p><p> </p><p>Softly, surely, Rio finishes her statement. “I kind of really like you too.”</p><p> </p>
