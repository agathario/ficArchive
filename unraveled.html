   Summary
  </p>
<i>
</i>
<p>
   The thought of being with a woman had once seemed impossible to Agatha Harkness—a door locked tightly and
            never to be opened. After all, she was 48 years old, for Christ’s sake.
  </p>
<i>
</i>
<p>
   Then, without so much as a warning, Rio Vidal, a first-year associate, strode into her perfectly controlled
            life and blew Agatha’s closet door off its damn hinges.
  </p>
<h1>
   Marching Ever Forward
  </h1>
<p>
   Agatha Harkness strode through the crowded lobby of a towering skyscraper, her heels clicking rhythmically
        against the polished marble floors. The place buzzed with life— executives in tailored suits, assistants
        juggling coffee and laptops, all part of the Fortune 500 empires that called this building home. Legends had
        walked these very floors. But as she moved, the sea of people parted, instinctively clearing her path.
  </p>
<p>
   Her signature purple coat, vibrant and bold, sliced through the sea of black and white, a startling contrast that
        drew eyes in her direction. She felt their glances, the flicker of curiosity before they quickly looked away.
        She relished it—the acknowledgment, however brief, that she was
   <em>
    someone
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   She remembered being a child, dreaming of being a superhero, of wielding magic, saving the day, and standing
        above mortal men. But that was fantasy.
  </p>
<p>
   Magic didn’t exist.
  </p>
<p>
   Power, though—that was real.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And she had it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She reached the elevator, watching with delight as the crowd instinctively parted, people stepping back to give
        her space. They pressed against one another, clinging to the edges, avoiding any accidental contact with her.
        Untouchable—that’s what she was. And they knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   The doors slid shut, and the elevator was engulfed in a heavy silence, the kind that made the air feel thick. She
        could feel them holding their breath, as though they feared making the slightest sound. Each time the doors
        opened at a stop, there would be a soft shuffle of apologies as they hurried out, clinging to the walls, moving
        briskly as if their lives depended on it. And as they crossed into their floors, she could hear their quiet,
        collective sighs—relief.
  </p>
<p>
   They had survived a ride in the elevator with her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    The Witch of Wall Street.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   At first, the term irritated her. A witch? As if she relied on magic or illusion to get to where she was. But
        then she understood. It wasn’t her presence they doubted—it was the control she commanded. The icy stillness
        that filled the room the moment she walked in, the subtle shift in posture, the way conversations died on
        people’s lips. Her arrival wasn’t seen—it was
   <em>
    felt
   </em>
   . A chill that made everyone sharpen their focus, as
        if they could sense the power she carried in her wake.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t invisible; she was
   <em>
    inescapable
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t just win cases or close deals—she
   <em>
    devoured
   </em>
   them. She dismantled everything in her path,
        leaving no room for her opponents to recover. When she entered a courtroom, it wasn’t just about money; it was
        about domination. She didn’t simply defeat people—she unraveled them, stripping away their confidence, their
        sense of self, leaving nothing but a hollow shell of who they once were.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t just win; she
   <em>
    consumed
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   When Agatha Harkness stepped into a courtroom, she didn’t just take your money.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She took your power.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She could see it in their eyes—the fear, the uncertainty.
  </p>
<p>
   And she thrived on it.
  </p>
<p>
   She clenched her jaw tightly, feeling her patience fray with every stop.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    This
   </em>
   was one of the few downsides of being on the top floor—the slow crawl as the elevator emptied floor
        by floor. She had considered, more than once, simply telling everyone to get out and let her ride alone. They
        would listen. No one questioned her. But then, she’d miss the fear—the way the tension thickened in the small
        space, the way they avoided eye contact, pressing themselves against the walls as if she might devour them
        whole.
  </p>
<p>
   It was
   <em>
    entertaining
   </em>
   . Still irritating, yes, but in a way, it was the best part of her morning. Watching
        them squirm, watching the unease crawl across their faces, knowing she caused it. They feared her without her
        saying a word. Just her presence was enough to unsettle them.
  </p>
<p>
   A small price to pay for the thrill.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, she reached the 70th floor and stepped out into the sprawling office of
   <em>
    Calderu, Wu- Gulliver, Kale,
            and Harkness
   </em>
   . A mouthful of a name. When she became a partner here a decade ago, she fought to have her
        name at the front. They refused, of course—too much history, too much ego. At first, it irritated her, the
        thought of being tacked on like an afterthought.
  </p>
<p>
   But then, she realized something—she liked being at the end.
  </p>
<p>
   It was fitting.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t just another name; she was the
   <em>
    period
   </em>
   . The final word. The exclamation point that closed the
        deal. After her, there was nothing left to say, no argument left standing. She was the one who ended it all.
  </p>
<p>
   And there was power in that.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha walked with purpose, her heels clicking sharply against the polished marble floor as she moved toward her
        office. It was in the corner, of course—like she would have anything less. The floor-to-ceiling windows offered
        a sweeping view of the city, a view befitting someone who had clawed her way to the top.
  </p>
<p>
   As she passed by the rows of desks, she could feel the silence in her wake, a ripple of stillness that followed
        her like a shadow. The underlings—the junior associates and paralegals, working furiously to finish their
        briefs, draft arguments, and scour case law—fell silent as she approached. Fingers that had been typing with
        frantic energy slowed, then stopped altogether. Conversations ceased, and the only sound left was the faint
        rustle of papers being shuffled and the occasional throat being cleared.
  </p>
<p>
   They tried to appear busy, as if they hadn’t noticed her, but she knew better. Desperation clung to them like a
        second skin. They all wanted to make their mark, to impress, to be noticed—but not by
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   . Not like
        this. They understood that if she stopped to speak to them, it wasn’t going to be for a pat on the back. And
        they feared what it would mean if her attention landed on them at the wrong moment.
  </p>
<p>
   She relished their nervous energy, letting it fuel her as she continued walking.
  </p>
<p>
   At the end of the hall, just outside her corner office, her assistant, Billy, was waiting, standing dutifully
        with coffee in hand. She barely glanced at him as she approached. Billy—or "Pet," as she often called him, with
        a mix of amusement and indifference—was always there, just like this. Silent, obedient, reliable. Like a
        well-trained dog, always eager to please.
  </p>
<p>
   “Morning, Ms. Harkness,” he said, his voice soft, as if afraid to break the unspoken rule of quiet that followed
        her. He held the coffee out, the cup already perfectly to her liking—black, hot like the searing sun.
  </p>
<p>
   Just like her.
  </p>
<p>
   She took it without a word, without so much as a nod of acknowledgment. Billy didn’t need one. He existed to
        serve, and she had no use for gratitude. He was there because he understood the rules. She was
   <em>
    everything
   </em>
   in this office, and everyone else was just playing for scraps.
  </p>
<p>
   With her coffee in hand, she breezed past him, the silence trailing behind her like a heavy shadow. Billy
        followed a few steps behind, his voice steady as he recited her schedule for the day. He had been with her for
        five years, long enough to understand the rhythm of her world.
  </p>
<p>
   Billy wasn’t like the others who feared her from a distance. He was afraid, of course—how could he not be? But it
        was a different kind of fear now. It had settled into him like a coal miner’s acceptance of the dark. He wasn’t
        scared of the shadows anymore; he’d spent too long walking in them by her side. He had learned to thrive in that
        cold, oppressive quiet, but he also knew the danger of digging too deep, of pushing too far. He understood
        better than anyone the kind of collapse Agatha could bring down on him if he made a single wrong move.
  </p>
<p>
   "Your 9 a.m. is a meeting with Gulliver," Billy started, his voice low and professional. "They're still pushing
        back on the terms from yesterday's negotiation, but it's expected. I’ve prepped the latest drafts for review."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t react, her gaze fixed ahead as she glided into her office.
  </p>
<p>
   "At 11, you have a call with the board of ZanderTech to finalize the settlement." Billy continued, falling into
        step beside her now, keeping his voice even, always careful not to overstep. "Then the lunch meeting with Judge
        Kellerman to discuss the new financial rulings."
  </p>
<p>
   She gave a slight nod, the barest flicker of acknowledgment, but Billy didn’t need more. He had learned long ago
        that the absence of her displeasure was the closest thing to approval he would ever get.
  </p>
<p>
   "And at 2 p.m.," he added, lowering his voice slightly, "you’re scheduled to meet with the legal team from
        Morrison &amp; Blake. They’ve requested a sit-down regarding the new acquisition."
  </p>
<p>
   A slight twitch of her lips. Billy knew that twitch. She was anticipating a battle—and battles were her
        lifeblood. The legal team from Morrison &amp; Blake had no idea what storm they were walking into.
  </p>
<p>
   Billy continued, meticulously marking off each meeting between now and her 7 PM dinner with a new client. Agatha
        abhorred these kinds of schmoozing dinners, the fake smiles, the idle pleasantries. But it was how the firm
        stayed ahead. More money, more revenue—those meant more power. And power was always worth a little work, even if
        she despised it.
  </p>
<p>
   She fought the urge to rub the bridge of her nose, feeling the dull ache of a headache starting to creep in.
  </p>
<p>
   Another late night.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Nicky's going to be disappointed—again.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It was her week with him. Shared custody with her ex-husband meant her son was dropped off at her doorstep every
        other week. And usually, she tried to keep her schedule in check when he was around. Billy knew this. If she had
        a meeting tonight, it wasn’t by choice—it was because Billy had no other option. He didn’t make mistakes. Not
        with her. Not ever.
  </p>
<p>
   She took a long sip of her coffee, trying to stave off the headache, drowning it in caffeine. It was a temporary
        fix, but it would keep her sharp for now.
  </p>
<p>
   Billy’s voice droned on in the background, listing tasks and schedules.
  </p>
<p>
   “And...” Billy started, his voice faltering as it trailed off.
  </p>
<p>
   Her eyes snapped to him, sharp and unyielding. Hesitation. Agatha
   <em>
    hated
   </em>
   hesitation. She despised
        weakness, uncertainty—the kind of doubt that poisoned potential. She thought she’d beaten that out of him by
        now. If Billy was going to become the diamond she knew he could be, he needed the heat. She flooded him with it,
        over and over. The pressure. The burn. It had nearly broken him—
   <em>
    nearly
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Most of her assistants couldn’t take the heat. They quit before they even got close to greatness, wilting under
        the intensity, unable to handle the fire it took to truly
   <em>
    become
   </em>
   something. But Billy had surprised
        her—not that she would ever tell him. He wasn’t perfect, but he was a quick learner, and unlike the others, he
        always came back for more. More punishment, more pressure. Somewhere inside, he must have known she was molding
        him into something stronger, something worthy.
  </p>
<p>
   He hadn’t slipped in a while. Which meant whatever he was about to say, he knew she wouldn’t like. That
        hesitation wasn’t fear of the unknown—it was the certainty that he was about to disappoint her.
  </p>
<p>
   "Speak, Pet," she said, her voice cutting through the silence like a finely honed blade. She could feel the
        tension radiating from Billy as he braced himself, gathering the courage to deliver whatever unfortunate news he
        had.
  </p>
<p>
   Billy swallowed hard but kept his composure, though she could see the faint flicker of hesitation behind his
        eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “The new associates are here,” he finally said.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s gaze flicked over his shoulder to the glass-walled conference room in the center of the firm—a glorified
        hamster cage. Inside, the freshly graduated associates stood awkwardly, shifting nervously, like the little
        rodents they were. Wide-eyed. Eager. Clueless. Her eyes snapped back to Billy, cutting through the moment with a
        cold, precise focus.
  </p>
<p>
   “And that’s my problem because...?” she drawled, her words sharp and bitter, like they left a bad taste in her
        mouth.
  </p>
<p>
   Billy gave the faintest flicker of a flinch, barely noticeable but there. His lips twitched, curling at the edges
        as he prepared to explain.
  </p>
<p>
   “Kale’s tied up in a deposition,” he said, his voice carefully steady. “Her assistant called. She needs you to
        cover the introduction to the firm.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw tightened, irritation bubbling beneath her calm exterior.
   <em>
    Of course,
   </em>
   she thought. It had
        been years since she engaged with the associates. HR had all but barred her from the process—not officially, but
        after a couple of expensive settlements with a few fragile souls claiming "emotional damage," her involvement
        was
   <em>
    strongly discouraged.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She scoffed internally at the memory.
   <em>
    Weak.
   </em>
   She’d barely done anything. Merely shown them what the real
        world was like. Apparently, not everyone had the stomach for it. So, HR had handed the task of introductions to
        the other partners, while Agatha focused on more meaningful work—like tightening the ironclad language of their
        contracts, ensuring no associate would ever dream of suing again.
  </p>
<p>
   The irony wasn’t lost on her. Any lawyer worth their salt would’ve read the fine print before signing. If they
        didn’t, well, they deserved the consequences. But these new recruits? They were too green, too eager to belong.
        They never looked past the first few pages, never questioned the terms, and by the time they did, it was too
        late. The firm owned them.
  </p>
<p>
   Her gaze flicked once more toward the glass conference room, where the wide-eyed associates stood, nervously
        fidgeting. The sight of them, so raw and uncertain, irritated her, yes—but there was also something oddly
        satisfying about it. It had been so long since she was allowed to
   <em>
    play
   </em>
   with the associates.
  </p>
<p>
   There was a certain thrill in it. Watching them squirm, watching the hope and ambition in their eyes slowly drain
        as reality settled in. They all came in thinking they’d change the world, that they’d be the exception to the
        rule. But by the time she was finished with them, they'd understand just how small and insignificant they really
        were.
  </p>
<p>
   A part of her relished the opportunity. She could almost feel the anticipation, the way it tugged at the edges of
        her calm demeanor. It had been years since HR had stepped in, taking away her favorite pastime. But now, with
        Kale stuck in a deposition, the door was cracked open just enough for her to have a little fun.
  </p>
<p>
   Her lips curved into a sharp smile.
   <em>
    Well, if they wanted an introduction to the firm, they’d get one.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She turned to Billy, her voice smooth but edged with a scowl, the irritation carefully played out on the surface,
        while the excitement churned deep inside, locked where it belonged.
   <em>
    Never show your cards.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “Fine,” she snapped, setting her coffee down on her desk with a sharp click and shrugging off her coat. Billy was
        already stepping forward, ready to take it from her. She handed it over without a glance, her attention shifting
        briefly to her reflection. High-waisted dark plum trousers, perfectly tailored, and a crisp white button-down
        tucked in. She cursed internally— if she’d known she’d be meeting the associates today, she would’ve worn
        something a little more intimidating.
  </p>
<p>
   More black, probably.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Never red.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Red was overrated. It washed her out, and besides, it carried too much cliché. Everyone thought power was red.
        But if you listened to the real whispers of Wall Street, the ones that floated through the corridors of power
        and wealth, they knew the truth.
  </p>
<p>
   The devil didn’t wear red.
  </p>
<p>
   It wore purple.
  </p>
<h1>
   Tricks and Trials
  </h1>
<p>
   Agatha moved through the firm’s sleek, gleaming halls with her usual quiet intensity, her eyes locked forward as
        she closed in on the glass-walled conference room. Her fingers flickered subtly at her sides, an unconscious
        dance she could never quite tame. The restless energy was always there, simmering beneath her composed exterior,
        just out of reach.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a trademark of hers, something she knew people noticed but never dared to comment on. Her fingers had
        drafted ruthless agreements, shredded defense strategies, and left her opponents exposed in the aftermath. Now,
        as she neared the room of trembling associates, they moved again, eager for something—
   <em>
    someone
   </em>
   —to take
        apart.
  </p>
<p>
   Inside the glass walls, the fresh-faced associates stood in awkward clusters, their eyes darting through the
        glass as she approached. Even through the thick glass, she could sense their discomfort, the low hum of whispers
        breaking the otherwise tense silence.
  </p>
<p>
   They’d heard the stories.
  </p>
<p>
   Of course, they had.
  </p>
<p>
   No one applied to work here for the prestige of the other partners—formidable as they were in their own right.
        Everyone knew the truth: if you survived a year under
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   roof, you were cut out for the relentless
        grind of the law. This firm was her domain, her garden, and she meticulously weeded out the weak.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t just demand excellence; she
   <em>
    cultivated
   </em>
   it. She pushed, tested, and tore apart those who
        couldn’t keep up, leaving only the strongest to thrive. And every associate in that room knew it—they weren’t
        just here to learn; they were here to survive
   <em>
    her.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips twitched into the barest hint of a smile, her eyes glinting with a predatory gleam. This was her
        favorite part—the feeling of being watched, the knowledge that they feared her long before she ever spoke. It
        was why she’d insisted on the glass-walled conference room the moment she became a partner. For this exact
        reason. So everyone could see her, circling like a predator, while her prey sat inside, trapped.
  </p>
<p>
   It was more than a room—it was a stage. And she controlled the performance from the moment she stepped into view.
  </p>
<p>
   Her fingers stilled as she reached the door, hovering momentarily before she gripped the handle and pushed it
        open. The atmosphere in the room shifted instantly, thickening with the kind of tension she thrived on. Every
        head turned toward her, their eyes glued to her as she walked to the front of the room. Some stared with
        wide-eyed anticipation, others with barely concealed dread.
  </p>
<p>
   At least twenty faces, fresh and eager, all waiting for her to speak. Fresh graduates from Ivy League law
        schools, handpicked for their brilliance and potential. This firm only took the best—on paper, at least. But
        Agatha knew better. By the end of the year, less than half of these hopefuls would still be standing. The rest
        would be weeded out, broken by the relentless pressure she thrived on. Only one or two might prove worthy of her
        time, worthy of her trust to actual work a case.
  </p>
<p>
   As she reached the front of the room, she let her gaze sweep across them, lingering just long enough on each face
        to watch the anxiety ripple through them. They wanted to impress her. They
   <em>
    needed
   </em>
   to impress her. And
        she knew that fear would be their greatest motivator—or their undoing.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let the silence hang, watching the tension rise, her fingers moving again at her sides. They were waiting,
        and she always enjoyed making them sweat.
  </p>
<p>
   “Welcome to Calderu, Wu-Gulliver, Kale, and Harkness,” she said breaking the silence.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes swept across the room, a practiced, unimpressed gaze moving from one young face to the next.
        Designer suits on young men with haircuts far too expensive for their salaries, no doubt paid for by their
        parents. Women in skirts and dresses that screamed sorority more than law firm, posturing like they had
        something to prove. Agatha had a knack for sniffing out potential with just a glance, but as her eyes dragged
        across the room, she felt nothing.
  </p>
<p>
   Bored.
  </p>
<p>
   Indifferent.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Monotony.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   And then, something caught her attention. Someone, standing near the back—not huddled toward the front like the
        rest, not scrambling to make a good impression. Instead, there was an air of indifference, as if this whole
        gathering was beneath them.
  </p>
<p>
   A woman.
  </p>
<p>
   Older then rest. Early 30's, probably.
  </p>
<p>
   She leaned against the glass wall, casually, almost defiantly. Unlike the others, her outfit wasn’t the standard
        corporate fare. A men’s suit and a green tie.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Bold
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Her raven hair was pulled back, a few stray wisps falling down, framing a face that wasn’t made up in the
        typical, polished way. No, this one wore eyeliner darker than appropriate, making no effort to blend in. And as
        Agatha zeroed in on her, her eyes narrowing in curiosity, she noticed the final detail that almost made her
        smirk.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She’s chewing gum.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse quickened, ever so slightly, her earlier indifference dissolving into intrigue. This one wasn’t
        here to impress anyone. She wasn’t here to beg for approval. And suddenly, Agatha wasn’t bored anymore.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Interesting.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Someone shifted uncomfortably, the squeak of their shoe cutting through the silence like a blade. Agatha’s eyes
        snapped to him instantly, her gaze sharp and unrelenting.
  </p>
<p>
   Golden blonde hair, a chiseled jawline that seemed carved from stone, and a cocky smile that made her pause for a
        moment. He leaned back in his chair, too relaxed for someone in this room, his posture screaming entitlement.
        Agatha’s lips twitched, but not in a smile—more of a flicker of curiosity laced with disdain. She briefly
        wondered whose son he was, what strings had been pulled to get him here.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Typical.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The arrogance in his expression told her he thought himself above the others. He wasn’t here to prove himself. In
        his mind, he’d already arrived, sitting on a pedestal he hadn’t even begun to earn. She’d seen it before—wealth,
        privilege, and a complete lack of understanding about how things truly worked in her world.
  </p>
<p>
   Her eyes narrowed, and the cocky smile on his face faltered ever so slightly under her unblinking scrutiny.
  </p>
<p>
   “And you are?” Agatha’s voice sliced through the air, smooth and lethal, like a blade drawn just for him.
  </p>
<p>
   The blonde hesitated, caught off guard for a split second before straightening in his chair, his practiced grin
        faltering.
  </p>
<p>
   “Jameson Hale,” he replied, but the charm that dripped from his voice had lost its polish under her cold stare.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Hale.
   </em>
   Agatha’s mind sifted through the Rolodex of high-powered names and old money. Hale
        Industries—privilege passed down like a family heirloom. Generations of wealth, entitlement baked into his very
        being. He wasn’t just a fresh Ivy League graduate—he was a product of legacy. But to her, he was just another
        arrogant boy who thought his last name was his ticket to power.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s expression didn’t shift. She tilted her head, her eyes narrowing as if seeing right through him.
  </p>
<p>
   “Hale,” she repeated, her tone devoid of any warmth. “How quaint.”
  </p>
<p>
   “My father is—”
  </p>
<p>
   “Stop,” she interrupted, her voice sharp enough to cut him off mid-sentence. She didn’t need to hear the rest.
        She already knew the story.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let me save you the effort,
   <em>
    Jameson,”
   </em>
   she made sure to say his name with as much venom as possible.
        “Your father, your money, your name—none of that matters here.”
  </p>
<p>
   She gestured around her, the sleek conference room that held the fate of every person sitting inside.
  </p>
<p>
   “This is not a country club where you can waltz in with your last name and expect doors to open.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stepped forward, closing the distance between them, her heels echoing like a death knell on the polished
        floor.
  </p>
<p>
   “Here’s your first lesson, Mr. Hale,” Agatha’s voice dropped, cold and final, each word cutting deeper. “The law
        is brutal. Unforgiving.” She paused, savoring the weight of silence, her gaze fixed on him. “But I? I’m worse.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words hit him like a blow. His bravado shattered completely, leaving him stripped of the confidence he’d
        carried in like armor.
  </p>
<p>
   And god, she
   <em>
    relished
   </em>
   it.
  </p>
<p>
   She stepped back from him, already dismissing him as if he were nothing more than an afterthought. He wouldn’t
        last six months. She could see it now—he’d go crawling back to his father’s company, where names carried more
        weight than skill. He wasn’t worth another breath.
  </p>
<p>
   But as she turned to move away, her eyes caught the woman at the back of the room. The one leaning against the
        glass, looking on with an amused smirk, as if she’d enjoyed the takedown just as much. Agatha forced herself to
        look away, returning to the task at hand, her gaze sweeping across the room, assessing the group of associates
        with an intensity that made the air feel heavier.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good news for you,” she said, her lips curling into a predatory grin that promised the opposite. She gestured
        with her hand, and the door swung open. Several senior associates entered, carrying box after box, stacking them
        in front of the wide-eyed group. Each box hit the table with a thud, and Agatha’s grin widened as the pile grew.
        It took a good 10 minutes before the final box hit the ground with a resounding thud.
  </p>
<p>
   “This is discovery for a case,” she said, her voice rising as she gestured grandly to the nearly 100 boxes
        stacked before them, each one bursting with thousands of documents. “A corporate espionage case—one of my
        finest.” Her tone turned almost gleeful as she laid it out for them.
  </p>
<p>
   “Broken contracts, faulty products, and a payout that could rival a small country’s GDP. The only problem?” She
        leaned forward slightly, her eyes glittering with malicious delight. “The company is a military weapons supplier
        with more influence in Washington than most senators, more money than God, and technology that could make us all
        disappear if they wanted.”
  </p>
<p>
   She gave a little shrug, feigning innocence.
  </p>
<p>
   “Ergo, the million-document discovery dump they handed us. Buried us, really. These boxes? They’ve been sitting
        in storage for
   <em>
    years
   </em>
   . They’ve been combed through by people far smarter than any of you. But...” Her
        grin widened. “You? You’re perfect for this.”
  </p>
<p>
   She let the silence hang, letting them absorb the gravity of the task—and the impossibility of it.
  </p>
<p>
   “You won’t find anything,” she said, her voice turning almost playful. “You’ll dig, and dig, and dig until your
        hands bleed and your brains fry, and in the end, you’ll realize you’re chasing a ghost.” She paused, savoring
        the dread she saw flicker in their eyes. “But here’s the fun part,” she continued, her voice dropping lower,
        dripping with dark glee.
  </p>
<p>
   “If you do—if you somehow manage to unearth something real, something no one else has found? I will personally
        mentor you. Build you. Mold you into something unstoppable.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha watched as her words landed, saw the spark of determination ignite in their eyes.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Perfect.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   That was the point, after all—to dangle a prize so alluring, yet so impossibly out of reach. She never—
   <em>
    ever
   </em>
   —took on associates. Everyone in the firm knew it. It was legend. To be personally mentored by
        Agatha Harkness was the ultimate reward, a gilded promise no one had ever claimed. But now, here it was,
        presented as if it could be theirs.
  </p>
<p>
   She saw it—the greed, the hunger. The flicker of belief in their eyes, that glimmer of arrogance that whispered,
   <em>
    I could be the one. The first.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   For Agatha, it was a win-win. They would fail, and their failure would bring her satisfaction. Watching their
        determination dissolve into desperation would be entertainment enough. But if—
   <em>
    by some inconceivable stroke
            of luck
   </em>
   —one of them did manage to unearth something? Well, then she’d have her white whale, wouldn’t
        she?
  </p>
<p>
   Not that it would happen. Agatha had combed through those documents herself, meticulously. There was nothing
        there. She knew that. But letting them try was the perfect trap.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Wonderful,
   </em>
   she thought. Oh, how delicious it would be to watch them throw themselves into this lost
        cause, clawing and scratching for something they would never achieve. The more they fought, the sweeter their
        inevitable downfall would be.
  </p>
<p>
   Her amusement faded, her voice turning sharp as her eyes narrowed to cold, predatory slits.
  </p>
<p>
   “But if you fail...” She let the threat linger in the air, thick with tension. “Then you’re nothing but another
        disappointment.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha paused, watching their faces tighten under her gaze, before delivering the final blow with deadly
        precision.
  </p>
<p>
   “And trust me when I say—
   <em>
    I don’t waste my time with disappointments.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   The silence that followed was heavy, almost suffocating. She could see the gears turning behind their eyes, the
        frantic calculations as they weighed their options. Already, the spark of desperation had flickered to life.
        They would chase her approval, pour themselves into this impossible task with everything they had.
  </p>
<p>
   And when they inevitably failed, it would mark them. The harsh reality would sink in—the precedent set. Working
        for Agatha Harkness wasn’t just demanding, it was
   <em>
    merciless
   </em>
   . She didn’t just push people to their
        limits—she
   <em>
    obliterated
   </em>
   them. And now, they would spend the rest of their year knowing exactly what that
        meant.
  </p>
<p>
   A small smile tugged at the corner of her lips as she watched them fall neatly into the trap she’d crafted with
        such precision.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Oh yes,
   </em>
   she thought,
   <em>
    this is going to be magnificent.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   With that, she stepped back, her presence still looming over them as she prepared to leave.
  </p>
<p>
   “You have 24 hours,” she said, her voice sharp and theatrical, letting the tension linger for just a moment
        longer. Then, with a dramatic sweep of her hand, she added.
  </p>
<p>
   “Happy Hunger Games! May the odds be ever in your favor.”
  </p>
<p>
   With that final flourish, Agatha turned on her heel and strode out, leaving them to their fate. She didn’t need
        to look back to know what would happen next—she could already imagine it. They’d be rushing forward, grabbing at
        the boxes, their faces lit with determination. And from the vantage of her office, over the next 24 hours, she
        would watch that determination slowly crumble into desperation as the clock ticked away.
  </p>
<p>
   She reached her office and sank into her chair, the leather cool against her back as she reveled in the impending
        crush of those tiny little associate hearts.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Technically,
   </em>
   she mused,
   <em>
    I didn’t threaten anyone.
   </em>
   So HR wouldn’t say a word.
  </p>
<p>
   Another win in her book.
  </p>
<p>
   Staring out at the cityscape, she reached for her coffee, took a sip, and grimaced—it had already gone cold.
  </p>
<p>
   “Billy,” she called, her voice cutting through the silence, and within seconds, he was there, practically running
        to her side. She didn’t say a word, just lifted the cup. He took it immediately, and she heard the sound of his
        footsteps fading as he left to fetch a fresh one.
  </p>
<p>
   But something tugged at her mind.
  </p>
<p>
   That smirk.
  </p>
<p>
   That woman—the associate with the dark hair.
  </p>
<p>
   “Wait—come back here,” she commanded, her voice sharper now. Billy reappeared, quick as ever.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Good pet.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes drifted past him, toward the hamster cage. The gerbils were already at work, tearing into the boxes
        like scavengers, forming little teams to tackle the overwhelming load of documents. It was a smart
        move—expected, really. More eyes, more chances of finding something.
  </p>
<p>
   She scanned the room, and there she was.
  </p>
<p>
   At the far end of the table,
   <em>
    alone
   </em>
   , she moved with quiet confidence, her fingers shuffling through the
        papers with an unhurried, methodical ease. Agatha watched, intrigued despite herself. And then, as if sensing
        her gaze, the woman looked up.
  </p>
<p>
   There gazes locked, and then—she blew a bubble.
  </p>
<p>
   A large, obnoxious bubble with her gum, the
   <em>
    pop,
   </em>
   unheard, but still breaking through the silent tension.
        The woman’s tongue flicked out, casually pulling the remnants of the bubble back into her mouth, all while
        maintaining eye contact with Agatha—and, of course, wearing that smirk.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed into a sharp, piercing glare, the surge of irritation instantaneous. Who did she think she
        was? That casual arrogance... it was infuriating. She could feel her pulse quicken, annoyance boiling just
        beneath the surface.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    This one,
   </em>
   she thought,
   <em>
    is going to be fun to break.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Without another second wasted, Agatha tore her gaze away, refusing to give that woman the satisfaction of knowing
        she’d rattled her. But beneath her icy exterior, something unexpected flickered—
   <em>
    curiosity
   </em>
   , sharp and
        undeniable, a feeling Agatha hadn’t entertained in years.
  </p>
<p>
   It was then she realized Billy was still standing in front of her. She jumped, startled by his presence.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Jesus
   </em>
   ,” she snapped, her irritation spilling over. “Don’t sneak up on me like that.”
  </p>
<p>
   Billy, unfazed by her theatrics, remained silent, simply waiting as he always did. His calm demeanor only served
        to annoy her further.
  </p>
<p>
   She glared at him.
  </p>
<p>
   “Get me the personal file on the new associate—the woman with the black hair, wearing the black suit with the
        green tie.”
  </p>
<p>
   Billy started to turn, instinctively looking for who she was talking about, but Agatha’s hiss stopped him cold.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Don’t turn around!
   </em>
   ” she hissed, her voice low and threatening. She didn’t need that woman realizing
        she was under scrutiny. “Do you have a subtle bone in your body,
   <em>
    pet
   </em>
   ?”
  </p>
<p>
   Billy at least had the decency to look slightly ashamed, his cheeks tinged with embarrassment. He nodded quickly,
        and without another word, he hurried off to retrieve what she’d asked for.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha leaned back in her chair, fingers tapping rhythmically on the armrest, replaying that damn smirk in her
        mind. The nerve—to blow a bubble, to meet her gaze with such bold indifference. It should have enraged her. It
   <em>
    did
   </em>
   enrage her. But beneath the anger, something else stirred—something far more exhilarating.
  </p>
<p>
   This must be what Godzilla felt like when he first laid eyes on a city ready to be obliterated. The anticipation,
        the hunger for destruction. A grin tugged at the corner of her mouth.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t just going to tear that woman down. She was going to savor it—watching her confidence wither, her
        defiance crumble under the weight of Agatha’s relentless pressure. It was going to be a spectacular fall, and
        Agatha would revel in every moment of it.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Oh, this was going to be fun.
   </em>
</p>
<h1>
   Giveth Sight
  </h1>
<p>
   Agatha leaned back against the plush leather seat of the town car, her fingers absently brushing over the fabric
        of her white button-down. She glanced down at it, noticing the few buttons she had left undone earlier in the
        evening. With a slight smirk, she buttoned two of them back up, pulling the collar higher.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Men.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   They were predictable, easy to manipulate. A little cleavage, a well-placed laugh at their terrible jokes, a
        subtle touch of her fingers on the rim of her glass as she sipped the bourbon they’d ordered—overpriced, of
        course, but they loved that kind of thing. Feed them expensive red meat and stroke their egos, and they
        practically signed the contract themselves. By the time dessert was over, all she had to do was let her
        reputation speak for itself.
  </p>
<p>
   And just like that,
   <em>
    Larkin &amp; Reed Solutions
   </em>
   was now the newest client of Calderu, Wu- Gulliver,
        Kale, and Harkness. A nice little $25 million addition to her already bulging portfolio.
  </p>
<p>
   She let out a quiet, satisfied sigh as the car slipped through the quiet streets, her eyes drifting to the city
        skyline. The deal had gone exactly as expected—smooth, seamless. Men in boardrooms rarely expected a woman to
        outmaneuver them with such ease. But Agatha had perfected the art long ago. She didn’t need to
   <em>
    play
   </em>
   their game. She
   <em>
    owned
   </em>
   it. They never saw her coming, not really. They never understood that the moment
        she stepped into the room, they were already caught in her web.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mind wandered back to the dinner. It had been like all the others—too much bourbon, too much ego. One of the
        men had spent ten minutes trying to explain blockchain technology to her, as if she hadn’t already built a dozen
        successful cases around it. She’d smiled, nodded along, threw in the occasional "interesting" for effect, and
        watched him puff up like a peacock.
  </p>
<p>
   It was all so... tedious.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And yet, so effective.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She crossed her legs, staring out the window, a small, satisfied smile playing on her lips. The men had no idea
        she barely needed to lift a finger to win them over. They were convinced they’d gotten a bargain by the end of
        it—thought they’d charmed
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   . But in reality, they were just another trophy for her shelf, another
        deal closed in the blink of an eye.
  </p>
<p>
   Her fingers tapped lightly on her lap, a quiet rhythm of victory, but her gaze drifted to her bag where the
        manila human resources file sat, tucked just beneath the leather. Billy had snagged it for her earlier, right
        from HR. She hadn’t had the chance to open it yet, though she’d been tempted—several times. The day had been
        relentless. Too many meetings, too many fires to put out.
  </p>
<p>
   But now, in the quiet of the town car, with the city lights flickering by, she couldn’t resist any longer.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha pulled the file from her bag, the crisp paper cool in her hands. She flipped it open, her eyes narrowing
        immediately as they landed on the photo.
   <em>
    Of course.
   </em>
   Even in her employee photo, she was smirking—cocky,
        bold. That same damn smirk that had irked her earlier. Agatha’s eyes flicked down to the name under the picture.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rio Vidal.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Interesting name.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d guessed the age right—32, older than her peers. That alone was unusual. Most associates were younger, fresh
        out of Ivy League law schools. But Rio? She’d gone to law school late, another oddity. Agatha scanned the
        details, her brow furrowing as she read further. No Ivy League pedigree. In fact, Rio hadn’t attended
   <em>
    any
   </em>
   of the usual suspects— Harvard, Yale, Princeton. Not even a Columbia grad.
  </p>
<p>
   No, Rio Vidal had attended some obscure law school in...
   <em>
    Texas.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha paused, blinking at the word as if it didn’t quite compute.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Texas.
   </em>
   The woman was from Texas.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    How in the hell did she get into my law firm?
   </em>
   Agatha thought, her annoyance mounting.
   <em>
    Who hired her?
            And more importantly, why?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She continued skimming the file, searching for answers.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Valedictorian,
   </em>
   Agatha noted. Not just in law school but all through her academic life. Her eyes widened
        slightly as she saw the LSAT score.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    172.
   </em>
<em>
    Impressive.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha's fingers tapped faster, her mind racing.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Smart, then.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Smarter than the Ivy League brats who had their seats bought by mommy and daddy, coasting through law school and
        slipping into her firm on the weight of their last names and trust funds. The kind who thought expensive degrees
        equaled talent.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    But this one...
   </em>
   She wasn't like them.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha flipped through the recommendations, scanning them quickly. Raving reviews, glowing endorsements—nothing
        unusual for someone who made it this far. But then she paused, her eyes narrowing as she read a particular
        letter from one of Rio's law professors.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    "Rio Vidal has an exceptional mind—one of the sharpest I’ve encountered in my years of teaching. Her quick
            wit and ability to think on her feet are unmatched. She doesn’t just understand the law; she anticipates it,
            often seeing solutions others overlook. She possesses all the makings of an extraordinary lawyer—one who
            won’t just practice law, but redefine it."
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha closed the folder with a sharp snap, the force of it reverberating in the quiet of the car. The raving
        reviews, the exceptional LSAT score, the professor’s glowing words—none of it mattered in the end.
  </p>
<p>
   Not until this, Rio proved herself
   <em>
    to her.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She leaned back against the seat, fingers drumming on the folder’s edge, her mind still circling around the woman
        in the photo.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Sharp. Quick. Unmatched. Beautiful.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     Wait
    </em>
</strong>
<em>
    .
   </em>
<em>
    Beautiful?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha froze, her fingers stilling against the folder. Where had
   <em>
    that
   </em>
   come from? She shook the thought
        away, irritation bubbling up inside her. Beauty was irrelevant. It wasn’t what she valued,
   <em>
    certainly not in
            an associate
   </em>
   . She prided herself on seeing only talent, skill, potential.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Focus,
   </em>
   she chastised herself, forcing her mind back to the task at hand. But the word lingered,
        unsettling her more than she wanted to admit.
  </p>
<p>
   Her phone rang, and for once, she didn’t mind the interruption—it was exactly what she needed. She glanced at the
        caller ID and rolled her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “What?” she snapped into the phone.
  </p>
<p>
   Silence.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Hello, Jen. How are you doing, Jen?
   </em>
   ” came the mocking tone on the other end.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha rolled her eyes harder, settling back into her seat.
  </p>
<p>
   “Talking to yourself now? All those illegal moisturizers you put into your face finally melting your brain?” she
        bit back, the sharpness of her tone unmistakable.
  </p>
<p>
   Jen huffed, clearly unimpressed.
  </p>
<p>
   “I need you to come in.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha pulled the phone away from her ear to check the time—9:14 PM. She had been working since 5 that morning,
        and she was tired.
   <em>
    Exhausted
   </em>
   , really. She hadn’t seen Nicky all day. By now, he’d be asleep—she’d
        checked with the nanny earlier. Still, she wanted to be there, to kiss him goodnight, to run her fingers through
        his hair, to be
   <em>
    mom
   </em>
   for just a moment.
  </p>
<p>
   “No—it’s late,” she said, her voice flat, decisive.
  </p>
<p>
   A pause. Silence on the other end. Then Jen’s voice, low but firm.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Agatha
   </em>
   —just get your ass in here.”
  </p>
<p>
   Before she could respond, the line went dead.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stared at her phone, irritation bubbling up. She let out a sharp breath.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    This night just keeps getting better,
   </em>
   she thought sarcastically, tossing the phone into her bag. She let
        out a loud heavy sigh. Her shoulders slumped, taking advantage of the privacy of the car to finally let herself
        collapse.
  </p>
<p>
   She gave herself exactly one minute. One minute to completely surrender to the weight of the day, to let the
        stress settle in and roll off, if only briefly. In this quiet, fleeting moment, the exhaustion hit her all at
        once, the strain of the day settling deep into her bones. The invisible armor she wore every day felt heavier
        than usual—pressing down on her shoulders, tight in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   But then, like a switch flipping, she forced herself to pull out of it. Her back straightened, her shoulders
        squared, and the walls she so carefully kept in place slid back into position. Agatha Harkness couldn’t afford
        cracks, not even in the privacy of her own car.
  </p>
<p>
   She reached for the intercom button, her finger pressing it with a controlled, steady motion.
  </p>
<p>
   “Back to the office, Dan,” she ordered, her voice sharp, fully composed.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes, Ms. Harkness,” came her driver’s prompt reply. She felt the subtle turn of the car, the shift in direction
        steering her away from home and back to the office.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha leaned her head back against the seat, her mind already shifting gears. Whatever awaited her at the office
        had better be important. Jen knew better than to drag her back this late without a damn good reason.
  </p>
<p>
   And if it wasn’t?
  </p>
<p>
   Well, then
   <em>
    someone’s head was going to roll.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha stepped out of the elevator, her irritation bubbling dangerously close to the surface. She knew herself—
   <em>
    knew her limits
   </em>
   —and she was on the edge of losing her composure. And when Agatha Harkness lost it, no
        one was safe. She marched through the office with a fierce intensity, her steps sharp, her focus singular. She
        was on a warpath.
  </p>
<p>
   Her gaze flicked to the glass-walled conference room as she passed, taking a small, malicious delight in seeing
        the associates still toiling away inside. Their once-pristine designer suits and dresses were now wrinkled,
        their faces tense with frustration as they argued over the documents.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Good.
   </em>
   At least she wasn’t the only one suffering tonight.
  </p>
<p>
   She kept walking but felt the nagging urge to glance back, wondering if
   <em>
    Rio
   </em>
   was in there—if she, too,
        was slogging through the night, just as frustrated as her peers. The thought of seeing that infuriating smirk
        wiped clean, replaced with a frown of disappointment or perhaps even the taut line of stress, had Agatha
        glancing over her shoulder, unable to resist.
  </p>
<p>
   But as her eyes scanned the room, she frowned.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She wasn’t there.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   A flicker of disappointment sparked inside her. If Rio had already given up, she certainly didn’t
   <em>
    have the
            makings of an exceptional lawyer
   </em>
   , as her professor had so boldly claimed. Agatha had expected more—a
        dramatic collapse, perhaps. Something with fire, or at least a satisfying level of frustration.
  </p>
<p>
   But there was nothing. No spectacle. No crumbling under pressure. Just...
   <em>
    absence.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The disappointment lingered, heavier than she wanted to admit. She had been looking forward to watching Rio
        break—or perhaps she was simply annoyed that she had missed it.
  </p>
<p>
   Either way, it left her feeling unsatisfied.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What a letdown,
   </em>
   she thought, pushing the irritation aside as she continued toward her office. But the
        annoyance only deepened as she caught sight of people inside—
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   space.
  </p>
<p>
   Three women lounged on her couch, and she recognized them immediately: Lilia Calderu, Jennifer Kale, and Alice
        Wu-Gulliver—the other partners. They were laughing, casually sipping on
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   whiskey as if they belonged
        there, making themselves comfortable in a place they had no right to be.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her fury simmering. This did
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   look like an emergency.
  </p>
<p>
   She marched forward, her steps quick and sharp, and dramatically ripped the door open, stepping in with a stormy
        presence.
  </p>
<p>
   The laughter died immediately, the room quieting as all three women turned to face her, their expressions
        faltering.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s gaze swept over them, eyes cold and cutting.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well,” she said, throwing her hands in the air with an exaggerated flourish, her tone dripping with sarcasm.
        “The building clearly isn’t on fire. So why am I here?”
  </p>
<p>
   Her words hung in the air, thickening the already tense atmosphere. The partners exchanged uneasy glances,
        clearly unsettled despite how accustomed they were to Agatha’s theatrics. No matter how well they knew her, she
        still had the power to get under their skin.
  </p>
<p>
   All except Lilia.
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia, the oldest and most seasoned of them, simply raised an eyebrow. She was always unfazed by Agatha’s
        theatrics, a fact that both annoyed and impressed Agatha in equal measure. Lilia had a gift—an unnerving ability
        to read people like open books, as if she could peer into their souls and know exactly what made them tick, what
        they would do next. It made Agatha uncomfortable, but she begrudgingly respected her for it.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha,” Lilia said, her tone carrying a hint of exasperation, like a mother addressing an overly dramatic
        child. She leaned forward, grabbing the decanter of whiskey with a casual grace, and poured a generous amount
        into a glass. Offering it to Agatha, she gestured toward the empty chair. “Sit.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her annoyance flaring again. She didn’t take orders from anyone, and Lilia knew that. But
        the sooner she figured out what this impromptu gathering was about, the sooner she could get back home.
  </p>
<p>
   With a reluctant sigh, she took the glass and settled into the chair, her posture stiff, her gaze unyielding.
  </p>
<p>
   “This better be good,” she muttered, taking a sip of the whiskey, her sharp eyes scanning the three women.
  </p>
<p>
   Jen met her gaze evenly before leaning back in her chair, arms crossed in that casual but calculating way Agatha
        despised.
  </p>
<p>
   “You have the new associates working the
   <em>
    Vanguard
   </em>
   case.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her patience wearing thin.
  </p>
<p>
   “Is
   <em>
    that
   </em>
   why you dragged me in here? Because I have associates working? That’s not exactly
        groundbreaking news, Jen.
   <em>
    This literally could’ve been an email.
   </em>
   ” Her tone was mocking, laced with
        sharp irritation.
  </p>
<p>
   Jen’s expression hardened, her eyes narrowing in return.
  </p>
<p>
   “I thought we all agreed to put Vanguard to rest.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha leaned forward, her fingers tightening around the glass.
  </p>
<p>
   “I never agreed to that,” she said, her voice cold and sharp. “Vanguard was shelved because the rest of you lost
        your nerve, not because it’s a dead case.”
  </p>
<p>
   She took a slow sip of whiskey, throwing Jen an unapologetic look.
  </p>
<p>
   “And besides—you dumped the associates on me, remember?” she added, her tone turning defensive. “What else was I
        supposed to do with them?”
  </p>
<p>
   “We have
   <em>
    plenty
   </em>
   of active cases,” Jen shot back, her irritation clear.
  </p>
<p>
   “None of them are challenging enough,” Agatha bit out. “I wanted to see what they were made of.”
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia chuckled softly, her knowing gaze settling on Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “You didn’t want to
   <em>
    test
   </em>
   them. You wanted to break them.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha raised a hand to her chest in mock offense, her eyes wide with exaggerated innocence.
  </p>
<p>
   “Who, me?” she said dramatically, her voice dripping with false sincerity.
  </p>
<p>
   Jen’s patience snapped.
  </p>
<p>
   “Enough,” she cut in, her tone sharp, silencing the room. She glanced at Alice, giving her a quick nod.
  </p>
<p>
   Alice, who had been quietly watching, shot Agatha a look before reaching for a folder on the table. She handed it
        to Agatha, her expression unreadable.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha eyed the folder suspiciously, then snatched it from Alice’s hand.
  </p>
<p>
   “What’s this?” she asked, her voice edged with curiosity.
  </p>
<p>
   “This,” Jen deadpanned, “is the reason I called you in.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha gave her a look, full of skepticism.
  </p>
<p>
   “And here I thought you were finally inviting me into your little sisterhood of the traveling jade egg.”
  </p>
<p>
   Alice gagged at the comment.
  </p>
<p>
   “Gross, Agatha.”
  </p>
<p>
   “Just read the damn file,” Jen growled, clearly losing patience.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha, still smirking, flipped open the folder, her amusement quickly fading as her eyes scanned the contents.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha flipped open the folder, her initial smirk fading as she skimmed through the documents. Emails,
        reports—familiar enough. All of them from the
   <em>
    Vanguard
   </em>
   file. She recognized every page. But as she
        continued to flip through, something caught her eye. Handwritten notes, scribbled in sharp, messy black ink.
        Chicken scratch, really. And there were small tabs sticking out of the sides of certain pages, marking specific
        sections.
  </p>
<p>
   Her brow furrowed, curiosity piqued as she studied the scrawled handwriting. The notes were meticulous, pointing
        out dates and correlating them with other reports. A pattern emerged— subtle, almost invisible. But the
        handwriting—whoever it belonged to—had spotted it.
  </p>
<p>
   She flipped to another page, her eyes scanning a hand-written note that called out discrepancies between official
        reports and internal memos. Some of these reports had been
  </p>
<p>
   doctored, their numbers altered just enough to avoid raising suspicion. And they’d slipped through even her
        scrutiny. Agatha’s stomach churned slightly at the realization.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    How the hell did I miss this?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The handwriting continued to circle glaring issues she hadn’t noticed—small but damning irregularities hidden
        beneath layers of data. She flipped through faster now, eyes scanning the tabs and notes with growing intensity.
        Whoever had gone through this file had not only found cracks in Vanguard’s defense but had started pulling at
        those threads, unraveling the very thing Agatha had thought was impenetrable.
  </p>
<p>
   She paused at a particular note, her fingers brushing over the ink. It wasn’t just pointing out an error—it was
        laying out a trail. A breadcrumb of clues Agatha herself hadn’t followed.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Who the hell wrote this?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She glanced up at Jen, then Alice, but neither of them spoke. They just watched her, waiting for her to put the
        pieces together.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed, flipping back to the beginning of the file, her mind racing. She hadn’t missed this
        because of negligence. No, this was the kind of work that required more than skill—
   <em>
    it required
            obsession
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   She slammed the folder shut, the room’s silence thick with anticipation.
  </p>
<p>
   "Who wrote these?" Agatha demanded, her voice sharp, slicing through the heavy silence.
  </p>
<p>
   The three women exchanged knowing glances, as if they had anticipated this exact moment. Jen, taking her time,
        raised her glass to her lips and sipped her whiskey slowly, leaning back into her chair with a casual, almost
        cocky posture. She met Agatha’s gaze, savoring the tension like a fine wine.
  </p>
<p>
   "Rio Vidal," she said, drawing out the words with relish. “
   <em>
    Your new mentee
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<h1>
   Blood and Tears and Bone
  </h1>
<p>
   Agatha despised being late. Every minute she wasn’t in the office felt like she was losing ground, like the day
        was slipping from her grip before it even started. She didn’t just want to keep up—she wanted to conquer each
        day, crush it beneath her heel. But today had been different. Today, she’d woken up with Nicky wrapped around
        her, clinging to her as if holding on tightly enough would make her stay.
  </p>
<p>
   His little arms, wrapped like a boa constrictor around her waist, squeezed with all the love and desperation a
        five-year-old could muster. And the moment she felt his grip, she knew it was going to be one of
   <em>
    those
   </em>
   mornings.
  </p>
<p>
   It had been a battle from the start: first, a meltdown over a pair of socks that didn’t fit just right, then she
        didn’t cut his toast the way he liked, which led to a complete refusal to ride with the driver to school. Every
        moment felt like she was dragging him out of quicksand, and through it all, she could feel the weight of his
        frustration. But she couldn’t blame him.
   <em>
    He was his mother’s son
   </em>
   —he had the same flair for dramatics,
        the same spiral when things slipped out of his control, and the same intensity, burning with the heat of a
        thousand suns.
  </p>
<p>
   He was, in many ways, her recompense for how
   <em>
    she
   </em>
   had acted all her life. Every tantrum, every stubborn
        refusal, felt like a mirror reflecting her own relentless need for control. And now, at five years old, Nicky
        had the same fire, the same relentless energy. Yesterday she had missed dinner and bedtime—big moments in his
        little world. He didn’t understand why his mother couldn’t be there. He just knew she wasn’t.
  </p>
<p>
   So, when he lashed out, she let him.
  </p>
<p>
   It was familiar—
   <em>
    deserved
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   In the end, she just gave in. Afterall, it was his last day with her before he went to his fathers for the week.
  </p>
<p>
   So, she let him ride with her, even though it meant going in the opposite direction of the office. She sat in the
        back, scrolling through her phone, reading emails, pretending not to notice him still sulking next to her. Her
        time was ticking away, the demands of work looming closer, but she didn’t mind.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Not today.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Beside her, Nicky was fiddling with something—probably one of the files she had tossed into her bag last minute.
        She was used to him doodling on her documents, often using them as makeshift canvases while she worked. Once,
        he’d drawn over a contract and when she brought it back to the associate who wrote it covered in crayon, she
        pointed out the “mistakes” her son had marked, just to remind them to stay humble.
  </p>
<p>
   “She’s pretty,” Nicky said, his small voice cutting through the quiet of the car.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes snapped up from her phone, her brow furrowing in confusion as she looked ahead, out the window.
  </p>
<p>
   “Who is pretty?”
  </p>
<p>
   She didn't see anything, so she looked down at him and her stomach dropped when she saw what he was holding—Rio
        Vidal’s personal file. Open. Her son’s tiny fingers were tracing the edges of Rio’s photo, his innocent eyes
        studying the image intently.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, an unexpected surge of emotion hitting her as she tried to process the sight of
        Nicky holding Rio’s file.
   <em>
    How did he—?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   "Who is she?" he asked, his little voice curious, blue eyes—just like hers—staring up at her expectantly.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha rarely found herself speechless, but now, with her son’s innocent question hanging in the air, she
        struggled to find the right words. Her mind raced.
   <em>
    Who is she?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   "She is—" Agatha hesitated, searching for an answer that wouldn’t betray the truth. She couldn’t very well tell
        her son that this woman was her newest challenge, her latest game— someone she intended to crush under the
        weight of impossible expectations. That kind of cruelty didn’t fit in a world where her son was watching.
  </p>
<p>
   "She’s a friend at work," she finally said, the words coming out carefully, tasting foreign on her tongue.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky blinked, eyes moving back to the picture.
  </p>
<p>
   "She’s pretty," Nicky repeated, as if that single observation was all the explanation he needed.
  </p>
<p>
   For a fleeting moment, Agatha couldn’t help but agree—and she hated herself for the thought. She quickly pushed
        it aside, forcing her focus back to something she could control. Reaching into her bag, she pulled out a red
        permanent marker and held it out to him.
  </p>
<p>
   "Here," she said, offering the marker with a subtle nod toward Rio’s personal file. “Have at it.”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky’s eyes lit up, and he grabbed the marker eagerly.
  </p>
<p>
   HR wouldn’t like it, but Agatha didn’t care. Rules didn’t apply to her. And this Rio woman? She wouldn’t be
        around long enough for it to matter—not if Agatha had anything to say about it.
  </p>
<p>
   The hamster cage was empty when Agatha arrived at the office. The Vanguard files had been moved to a new room,
        now that something had finally been found, and the partners—
   <em>
    reluctantly
   </em>
   —gave her the green light to
        pick the case back up.
  </p>
<p>
   But they’d made it painfully clear—no more pouring millions into this fight. No more endless hours and resources
        bleeding into the abyss. If she wanted to chase her white whale,
  </p>
<p>
   it would be on
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   terms this time.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    One associate,
   </em>
   they said.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    One
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   That was all she got.
  </p>
<p>
   If Agatha wanted Vanguard, she had to roll up her sleeves and dive headfirst into the dirt herself. She could
        practically feel the disapproval clinging to her like a shadow, the weight of their judgment pressing against
        the back of her mind. They were done funding her fight. Even with the new findings, they still saw it as a lost
        cause—a battle she couldn’t win.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And gods
   </em>
   —that burned something fierce inside her.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t done with Vanguard. She would
   <em>
    never
   </em>
   be done with them. Not until she had her heel on their
        throat, pressing down until there wasn’t even the faintest gasp left.
  </p>
<p>
   She wanted them broken.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Completely.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It wasn’t just a case anymore; it had become something darker, something bordering on obsession. The gnawing pull
        of unfinished business that kept her awake at night, dragging her thoughts back again and again. When she
        couldn’t sleep, she would find herself in the file room, fingers brushing through old documents, searching for
        something—
   <em>
    anything
   </em>
   —that might have been missed.
  </p>
<p>
   She knew it was unhealthy. Knew that the case had sunk its claws into her, tightening its grip every day. But she
        couldn’t let it go.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Wouldn’t
   </em>
   let it go.
  </p>
<p>
   Vanguard wasn’t just a case anymore.
   <em>
    It was a reckoning
   </em>
   . And Agatha
   <em>
    needed
   </em>
   to be the one to
        deliver it.
  </p>
<p>
   On her way to her office, she paused outside the war room adjacent to her door. Stepping inside, the familiar
        thrill shot through her veins. Stacks of Vanguard files towered against the walls, the whiteboard beside them
        still untouched, waiting to be filled with the threads of conspiracy that Agatha knew she was about to unravel.
  </p>
<p>
   It didn’t matter that she only had one associate. She
   <em>
    thrived
   </em>
   in the chaos, and that board was going to
        tell the story of Vanguard’s downfall. All she needed was a crack in the armor, a single loose thread to pull.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    The hunt.
   </em>
   This was the part of her job she
   <em>
    lived
   </em>
   for.
  </p>
<p>
   On the surface, the company was clean as the whiteboard—a massive defense contractor with deep ties to the
        Department of Defense. They supplied everything from tanks to missiles, anything designed to kill. If it could
        destroy, Vanguard had a hand in making it. But Agatha
  </p>
<p>
   knew when a company was
   <em>
    that big
   </em>
   —
   <em>
    in that line of work
   </em>
   , there was always a trail of filth
        hiding under the glossy veneer.
  </p>
<p>
   Five years ago, an anonymous whistleblower dropped a bombshell on her desk—serious allegations that painted
        Vanguard in a very different light. It was like someone handed her a blacklight to expose the mess, and like a
        truck stop bathroom, it showed just how
   <em>
    absolutely filthy
   </em>
   those fuckers really were.
  </p>
<p>
   According to the tip, Vanguard wasn’t just arming the U.S. military. They were allegedly selling weapons to
        terrorist organizations in the Middle East, drug cartels in South America, and organized crime families that
        held entire cities in their grasp.
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t just shady—
   <em>
    it was catastrophic
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   The data dump that came with it was massive—financial records that didn’t line up, shipping manifests that made
        no sense, and buried within the files was an obituary.
   <em>
    Brooke Sinclair,
   </em>
   an accountant at Vanguard,
        twenty-seven years old. Dead by suicide. Found by her family in her garage, the car still running.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had felt a chill run down her spine when she read it. That’s when she knew the case wasn’t just numbers on
        a page.
  </p>
<p>
   It was bigger.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Darker.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The final piece in the whistleblower’s file had been an innocuous-looking email—something so routine it almost
        seemed irrelevant. Brooke had forwarded a concern to her higher-ups. She’d found inconsistencies: missing
        storage containers, financial line items that didn’t trace back to any purchases. She was simply requesting a
        meeting to clear things up before finalizing her month-end report.
  </p>
<p>
   That was it.
  </p>
<p>
   No grand reveal.
  </p>
<p>
   No dramatic accusations.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Just a simple request for clarity.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   And that email had been the last time anyone heard from Brooke.
  </p>
<p>
   The whole thing reeked of a cover-up, and Agatha could smell it a mile away.
  </p>
<p>
   Brooke’s death was ruled a suicide, but nothing about it sat right with Agatha. The pieces didn’t fit. She
        managed to convince Brooke’s grieving parents to let her take on the case, pro bono, of course. They were
        Midwestern farmers, barely scraping by, but they were desperate for answers.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Brooke wasn’t suicidal. She was happy
   </em>
   ,” her mother had sobbed, clutching her husband’s arm. The
        father, stoic and broken, had nodded along silently, his weathered hand reaching out for the contract.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Give it to me
   </em>
   ,” he had said, his voice rough, his signature swift and deliberate. He handed the
        contract back to Agatha, fury burning in his eyes. With one hand, he held his grieving wife; with the other, he
        handed over the last thing he had—the hope that Agatha could give them justice.
  </p>
<p>
   It was enough to bring a suit, but Agatha knew this was going to be an uphill battle. Vanguard was too big, too
        powerful. And they’d already hired the only firm in the U.S. that had a reputation to rival her own.
  </p>
<p>
   A firm out of Boston:
   <em>
    Fox, Ratcliff, Coyotl, Wise, Crow, Orm, and Swarmen.
   </em>
<em>
    A fucking mouthful.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But most people just called them The
   <em>
    Salem Seven.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It had a certain gravitas to it, didn’t it?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    The Witch of Wall Street
   </em>
   v. The
   <em>
    Salem Seven
   </em>
   . It felt like something ripped from a Marvel
        movie—two juggernauts going head-to-head, each wielding their own brand of legal magic.
  </p>
<p>
   But this wasn’t a movie, and reality was a much harsher beast.
  </p>
<p>
   They didn’t need to destroy her with a knockout punch. No, they played it smart. They dragged it out, bogged her
        down in procedural delays, tiring her out with endless paperwork and technicalities. Agatha could see the
        strategy, and she hated to admit it—but she respected the move.
  </p>
<p>
   It was ruthless.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Effective
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   The whistleblower’s records?
   <em>
    Thrown out.
   </em>
   The Seven claimed they were doctored.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Fine.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha put in a formal request for the originals then. The court granted it. But of course, they didn’t just give
        her what she needed.
  </p>
<p>
   They gave her
   <em>
    everything
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   They practically annihilated a rainforest to bury her in paper. Files upon files, crates upon crates of
        documents, all designed to slow her down, to drown her firm in an avalanche of meaningless information.
  </p>
<p>
   They were good.
   <em>
    So, fucking good.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   And it worked.
  </p>
<p>
   After a year of relentless digging, after burning through five million dollars in associate hours, combing
        through mountains of case files and finding nothing, the partners finally called it. Vanguard was bleeding them
        dry. It had become a war of attrition, and her own firm was starting to crack under the pressure.
  </p>
<p>
   3-1 vote.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had to put the case away.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She hated it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Every part of her seethed with frustration, knowing they were being played. Vanguard had won—not by being
        smarter, but by exhausting her, by exploiting the resources of her firm and dragging down into the mud until she
        couldn’t breathe.
  </p>
<p>
   Shutting down the case had felt like swallowing glass.
  </p>
<p>
   Now, as she stood in the war room, staring at the mountain of files towering before her, Agatha couldn’t help but
        feel the weight of it all pressing down on her. The thought crept in —the possibility of failing
   <em>
    again.
   </em>
   She wasn’t afraid of much. She prided herself on that. But failure? That was the one thing that clawed at her
        insides, the one fear she could never shake.
  </p>
<p>
   To be
   <em>
    less
   </em>
   —that was her nightmare.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t set the bar sky-high without holding herself to those same brutal standards. She wasn’t completely
        heartless. She demanded perfection, but she demanded it from herself first.
  </p>
<p>
   And now, with Vanguard staring her in the face, she had to wonder—could she survive another fall?
  </p>
<p>
   Out of the corner of her eye she spotted Billy waiting for her, standing there with that wide- eyed, puppy-dog
        expression, holding her coffee like a peace offering.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sighed loudly, the weight of the war room and the gnawing thoughts of failure still heavy on her mind.
        Without a word, she turned and walked out it, brushing past him, snatching the coffee from his hand as she made
        her way out the door. The morning with Nicky, the pressure, the looming task ahead—it was all too much, and it
        made her snappy.
  </p>
<p>
   "Get me the updated financials from Vanguard," she barked, barely giving him a glance. "And the client contracts
        from last quarter reviewed by noon."
  </p>
<p>
   Billy opened his mouth, clearly ready to say something, but before he could, she cut him off.
  </p>
<p>
   "Also, track down those emails—
   <em>
    you know the ones
   </em>
   —and I want a report on the last quarter of stock
        movement. I wanted those 5 minutes ago."
  </p>
<p>
   Billy’s mouth hung open again, his eyes darting as he tried to keep up, but Agatha didn’t slow down, her words
        spilling out like a rapid-fire barrage.
  </p>
<p>
   “—And I want those updated financials on my desk before lunch.
   <em>
    And
   </em>
   call IT about the damn firewall
        issues at my home office—”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s words and her steps halted simultaneously as she entered her office and realized she was not alone.
  </p>
<p>
   There, on the cream-colored couch, sat Rio Vidal. Leaning back with infuriating ease, dressed in a forest green
        suit paired with a high-collared white button-down, her presence was impossible to ignore. Her hair was down
        today, framing her face in a way that softened her sharp look, but that smirk—
   <em>
    that damn smirk
   </em>
   —and the
        casual way she crossed her legs, as if she belonged there, made Agatha’s brain short-circuit for a brief,
        disorienting second.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, her composure faltering for only a heartbeat before she whirled on Billy, who had the decency to
        look properly terrified.
  </p>
<p>
   "You have a visitor," he mumbled, offering an apologetic grimace and a look that practically screamed,
   <em>
    I
            tried to tell you.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha narrowed her eyes at him, the sharpness in her gaze cutting like a blade.
  </p>
<p>
   "
   <em>
    I have eyes,
   </em>
   " she hissed, her voice a low warning.
  </p>
<p>
   With a flick of her hand, she shooed him away, her irritation barely contained.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mind whirred back into focus, her attention shifting back to Rio, who looked far too comfortable in
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   office. It set Agatha’s nerves on fire, but she refused to show it. One of her many talents was
        projecting confidence and resolve, even when she didn’t feel a shred of it.
  </p>
<p>
   She ignored Rio completely, striding to her closet to hang up her jacket as if the woman weren’t even there.
        Then, with calm precision, she moved to her desk, booting up her computer and diving into her emails. The
        silence between them was thick, almost tangible, but Agatha could do
   <em>
    this
   </em>
   all day. The steady sound of
        her typing filled the room as she fought the urge to look up, knowing Rio’s gaze was on her, watching.
  </p>
<p>
   Ten minutes passed in silence, the tension growing by the second.
  </p>
<p>
   “I liked your speech yesterday,” Rio’s voice finally broke through, cutting through the quiet like a blade.
        Agatha’s fingers stilled on the keyboard. It wasn’t the comment that threw her— it was the voice. There wasn’t a
        trace of the Texas drawl she had expected. Instead, Rio’s voice was rough, a gravelly tone with an undercurrent
        of lilting precision, tinged with something else. Something... bilingual.
  </p>
<p>
   And Rio wasn’t done.
  </p>
<p>
   “It was very—‘
   <em>
    I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle
            fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death
   </em>
   .’”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s mind screeched to a halt. What in the
   <em>
    hell
   </em>
   was this woman talking about?
  </p>
<p>
   Then it clicked. She was the mother of a five-year-old who had learned to read at three, well beyond
   <em>
    The Very
            Hungry Caterpillar.
   </em>
   They’d started reading
   <em>
    Harry Potter
   </em>
   together earlier this year, and now
        Agatha recognized the quote, the words landing in her mind like a bomb.
  </p>
<p>
   Her head snapped up, her neck practically breaking from the speed of it. Eyes narrowed, she glared at Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   “Did you just compare me to
   <em>
    Snape
   </em>
   ?”
  </p>
<p>
   And gods, that
   <em>
    smirk.
   </em>
   It stretched across Rio’s face like she could taste Agatha’s annoyance and was
        savoring it.
  </p>
<p>
   “Dark, brooding, powerful—
   <em>
    misunderstood
   </em>
   ,” Rio shrugged casually, her smirk deepening. “It fits,
        doesn’t it?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha clenched her jaw, torn between irritation and—
   <em>
    though she would never admit it
   </em>
   — something
        dangerously close to amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw tightened as she stared at Rio, a sharp retort poised on her lips, but she hesitated. Rio was
        clearly enjoying this little game, and feeding into it wasn’t going to give Agatha the upper hand. Still, the
        comparison gnawed at her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Misunderstood?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t misunderstood. She was crystal clear about who she was and what she wanted. Power. Control.
        Victory. There was no mystery in that.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m not misunderstood,” Agatha said coldly, her voice slicing through the tension like a blade. “I’m very clear
        about what I do—
   <em>
    and how I do it.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk only widened, leaning back on the couch as if settling in for a long, enjoyable battle.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, I don’t doubt that. But misunderstood doesn’t have to mean unclear, does it?” Her tone was playful,
        teasing—yet there was something sharp underneath, like she was trying to poke at something deeper. “Sometimes,
        people can see exactly what you are and still miss the point.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha raised an eyebrow, refusing to rise to the bait. She turned back to her screen, her fingers resuming their
        steady typing, dismissing the conversation.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio didn’t seem deterred.
  </p>
<p>
   ‘"You know, I think people misjudge you,” she continued, her voice taking on a more serious tone. “They think
        they see all there is to you. But they don’t.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha paused mid-keystroke, her irritation growing with each word. She didn’t
   <em>
    like
   </em>
   being analyzed,
        especially not by someone—lesser.
  </p>
<p>
   “And what, exactly, do you think they’re missing?” she asked without looking up, her voice cool and measured.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio was silent for a beat, long enough to make Agatha glance up, meeting her gaze. The smirk had faded, replaced
        by a thoughtful expression.
  </p>
<p>
   “They miss how much you care,” Rio said quietly, her eyes locking onto Agatha’s. “You hide it well, but I see it.
        You’re ruthless, yes. But it’s because you give a damn.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stared at her, caught off guard. She hadn’t expected
   <em>
    that
   </em>
   . Most people assumed her ruthlessness
        came from a cold, detached place. The idea that someone might see her drive as a sign of care—
   <em>
    of
            passion
   </em>
   —unnerved her.
  </p>
<p>
   She shook her head, breaking the eye contact, her fingers clenching the edge of the keyboard.
  </p>
<p>
   “You don’t know me. Don’t pretend you do.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio leaned forward, her tone soft but insistent.
  </p>
<p>
   “Maybe I don’t.
   <em>
    But I know people like you
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha met her gaze again, this time with a mix of annoyance and curiosity.
  </p>
<p>
   “People like me?”
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    There were no people like her.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio smiled faintly.
  </p>
<p>
   “People who fight like hell because they care too much. Not because they don’t care at all.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stared at her, unsure whether to feel insulted, intrigued, or both. For the first time in a long while,
        someone had managed to catch her off guard.
  </p>
<p>
   And it bothered her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    This woman was going to be a problem.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha turned from her screen, her gaze finally settling fully on Rio.
   <em>
    She really looked at her this
            time
   </em>
   —studying her, sizing her up. The playful smirk was still there, but beneath it, Agatha could see
        something else: resolve. The kind of resolve that didn’t crack easily, the kind that didn’t care about
        boundaries or hierarchies.
  </p>
<p>
   And it wasn’t just her words. It was the way Rio held herself, the calm confidence that radiated off her, the way
        she didn’t flinch under Agatha’s scrutiny. Most people—hell, most seasoned lawyers—would have backed down by
        now, would have shown some flicker of doubt or fear.
  </p>
<p>
   But not this woman.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha's eyes narrowed, taking in every detail, from the tailored green suit to the way Rio’s fingers drummed
        softly against the arm of the couch, as if daring her to make the next move. This wasn’t some naive associate
        trying to make a name for herself—this was someone who knew exactly what she wanted and wasn’t afraid to push
        for it.
  </p>
<p>
   Leaning back in her chair, Agatha crossed her arms, her eyes narrowing as she studied Rio more closely, weighing
        her options. She wasn’t used to being on this side of the equation.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why are you here?” Agatha found herself asking, her voice sharper than she intended.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio tilted her head, as if assessing her, sizing her up in a way that Agatha hadn’t experienced in a long time.
        Most people looked at her with fear or reverence. But Rio? She looked at her like a challenge, like she was
        ready to meet her head-on.
  </p>
<p>
   “I work here,” Rio deadpanned, her tone infuriatingly calm.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    God, that was good.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha felt the tug of a smile pulling at her lips, and she had to fight it, biting down on the inside of her
        cheek to keep it from showing. Instead, she clung to the simmering self- righteous anger she always kept close,
        using it as her shield.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why are you in
   <em>
    my office
   </em>
   ?” she hissed, her voice low and dangerous, eyes locked on Rio, waiting for
        her next move.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio didn’t flinch. In fact, the smirk on her lips deepened, as though she was fully aware of the effect she was
        having—and relishing every second of it.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mrs. Kale said I was helping you with Vanguard,” she said, her tone maddeningly casual, as if the monumental
        weight of the case meant nothing.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Your new mentee.
   </em>
   Jen’s voice echoed in Agatha’s mind, curling through her thoughts like a thorny vine,
        digging deeper with every passing second. Agatha’s jaw clenched, her teeth grinding as she fought back the
        rising surge of irritation.
  </p>
<p>
   “She said I earned it because I found something on Vanguard. That I’m officially your associate now,” Rio said,
        her voice steady and maddeningly calm.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha exhaled deeply through her nose, half-expecting smoke to billow out with the fire that was steadily
        building inside her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Did she now?” Agatha’s voice was cold, sharp enough to slice through the thick tension that filled the room.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk didn’t waver. She shrugged, completely unfazed.
  </p>
<p>
   “I mean, technically, you said it first. If I recall, your exact words were: ‘
   <em>
    If you somehow manage to
            unearth something real, something no one else has found, I will personally mentor you. Build you. Mold you
            into something unstoppable.’
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw clenched.
   <em>
    Jesus Christ
   </em>
   . Those were her
   <em>
    exact fucking words
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What was she, Rain Man?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her gaze hardening into something lethal.
  </p>
<p>
   “If I wanted to hear myself talk, I’d do it. I don’t need you of all people quoting me back to myself.”
  </p>
<p>
   But Rio didn’t flinch. That
   <em>
    damn
   </em>
   smirk stayed fixed on her lips, taunting Agatha, pushing her,
        challenging her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And god—Agatha had never wanted to break something so badly.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She leaned forward, her voice dropping dangerously low, her eyes locking onto Rio’s with unblinking intensity.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let me make one thing very clear: I don’t play games. You’re mistaken if you think this is going to be some
        mentor-mentee bonding experience,” she hissed, her tone venomous. “I don’t do hand-holding. If you’re staying,
        you’ll keep up or get crushed. No in-between.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s expression didn’t falter. She shrugged again, that irritatingly calm demeanor still intact.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m not here to play. I’m here to help. And from where I’m standing, it looks like I’ve already gotten further
        than your last attempt.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes burned, and for a moment, the room crackled with silent fury. She studied Rio in silence, her fists
        tightening at her sides. This woman—had nerve.
   <em>
    A dangerous nerve
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, Agatha leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms over her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   “Alright then,” she said, her voice cold and cutting. “If you’re so eager to prove yourself, let’s see how long
        you last. But don’t expect any help from me. You sink or swim—either way, I don’t care.”
  </p>
<p>
   For the first time, the smirk on Rio’s face softened. Her eyes gleamed, not with arrogance but with something far
        more dangerous—excitement. Real, unbridled excitement.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good,” she said, her voice steady and sure. “That’s how I prefer it.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lip curled into a slow, predatory smile. Her voice, when she spoke, was dripping with challenge.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay,
   <em>
    Vidal
   </em>
   . Let’s see what you’re made of, then.”
  </p>
<h1>
   Where All That's Wrong is Right
  </h1>
<p>
   Agatha’s day was a relentless barrage of phone calls, emails, and fires that constantly needed extinguishing.
        Being a partner meant she was more of a firefighter than a lawyer these days, managing crises instead of sinking
        her teeth into the work that used to ignite her. Budgets, briefs, frantic clients—she moved through them all
        like a machine.
  </p>
<p>
   Efficient.
  </p>
<p>
   Precise.
  </p>
<p>
   But it didn’t stop the pull—
   <em>
    to the case
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Every time her gaze slipped from the pages in front of her and drifted toward the war room, that’s what she
        repeated to herself. It was
   <em>
    Vanguard
   </em>
   —the hunt for her white whale—that tugged at her focus, not the
        woman inside that room.
  </p>
<p>
   Her office offered the perfect view of the war room, a constant reminder of the battle waiting for her. Every
        free second—a breath between calls, a brief pause between emails—her eyes would find their way there. Watching
        the case take shape, watching the clues unfold, watching the documents mount.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    That’s what mattered.
   </em>
   That’s what she was watching.
  </p>
<p>
   But the lie tasted bitter on her tongue every time she told it.
  </p>
<p>
   When Rio Vidal had first stepped into the war room, Agatha had watched her closely, narrowing her eyes,
        half-expecting the woman to stand there paralyzed, realizing the sheer magnitude of what Agatha had put on her.
        But no. Vidal just stood there, taking it all in, a quiet, unsettling calm about her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She's in over her head. She will soon see,
   </em>
   Agatha had thought, almost waiting for her the moment her to
        crack—
   <em>
    to see it
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   But then the phone rang, dragging Agatha into yet another client emergency. Irritation simmered as she spent the
        next twenty minutes navigating someone else’s disaster, her attention fracturing. She tried to shove the pull—
   <em>
    Vanguard
   </em>
   , she forced herself to think—into the background as she dealt with the issue, but it lingered
        like a shadow at the edge of her mind.
  </p>
<p>
   The second the call ended, her eyes snapped back to the war room, instinctive and immediate.
  </p>
<p>
   And there was Vidal—now at the table, the first of the boxes spread out before her, a document in hand. She
        looked calm. Too calm, really. The predatory smirk Agatha had come to expect was gone, but something else had
        taken its place—something that looked disturbingly like...
   <em>
    pleasure.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It was unmistakable in the way Vidal’s lips curled, ever so slightly, as she read. Her eyes moved across the page
        with a slow, deliberate satisfaction, her fingers tracing the edge of the paper like she was savoring every bit
        of it. Agatha could
   <em>
    feel
   </em>
   it, that quiet enjoyment, the subtle shift in her expression—so calm, so
        focused, so utterly immersed in the work.
  </p>
<p>
   The pleasure in it was tangible, almost intimate.
  </p>
<p>
   And then Nicholas’s words from this morning echoed through her mind like a punch to the gut.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    "She’s really pretty."
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The thought jolted her, snapping her out of the moment.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What the hell was that?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha shook her head, a surge of emotion flooding her chest—anger, yes, but something else too, something she
        refused to name.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Focus,
   </em>
   she commanded herself, ripping her gaze from the war room as if it burned her. She tried to
        steady the sudden quickening of her pulse, tried to shove down whatever it was stirring inside her.
  </p>
<p>
   Thankfully, her email dinged, yanking her back to reality. A brief from one of the senior associates she’d been
        waiting on. She clicked it open, desperate to shift her mind back to something—
   <em>
    anything
   </em>
   —else.
  </p>
<p>
   But as her eyes scanned the first page, her thoughts refused to follow. No matter how hard she pushed herself to
        focus, her mind stayed stubbornly locked on Vidal.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    No, not Vidal.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     Vanguard
    </em>
</strong>
<em>
    .
   </em>
<em>
    Fuck.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Irritation flared hot in her chest. She tore through the first two pages of the brief, redlining it ruthlessly
        before she even made it halfway through. The work was sloppy, half-baked. Her temper rose as she furiously typed
        an email in response, not bothering to sugarcoat her words.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    "Submit something like this to me again, and the next thing you’ll be drafting is your resignation,"
   </em>
   she
        fired back.
  </p>
<p>
   Her fingers hovered over the keyboard for a moment, her pulse racing—not just from the poor quality of the work.
  </p>
<p>
   This fixation was dangerous.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha couldn’t afford it—
   <em>
    didn’t want it
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Grabbing a folder off her desk, she opened it and she forced herself to focus on the contract in front of her. It
        was for one of her biggest clients, so it needed by perfect.
  </p>
<p>
   She needed to be sharp, precise.
  </p>
<p>
   But instead, she gnawed on the top of her pen, frustration simmering just below the surface. Her eyes kept
        pulling toward the war room, despite every ounce of will she tried to muster against it.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Don’t look. Focus.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But the thought alone had her glancing up—and
   <em>
    god
   </em>
   , she wanted to slap herself.
  </p>
<p>
   There was Vidal, seated at the table, chewing on the end of her pen, lips brushing against the plastic in the
        same thoughtless way Agatha had just been doing. Agatha’s breath caught, her grip tightening around her own pen.
        She quickly tore it from her mouth and tossed it aside as if it burned her.
  </p>
<p>
   The scene in front of Vidal was controlled chaos: papers scattered everywhere, stacks teetering on the edge of
        collapse, but somehow, the woman didn’t look overwhelmed. If anything, she looked...
   <em>
    pleased
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart stuttered, her pulse quickening as she watched Vidal lean forward slightly, that faint smile
        playing on her lips as she studied something on the page.
  </p>
<p>
   Then—
   <em>
    goddammit
   </em>
   —her tongue flicked out, just briefly, running over her lips in thought.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt heat rise in her chest. It sent a pulse straight through her, sharp and unwanted.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Nope.
   </em>
<em>
    No Fucking.
   </em>
<em>
    Way.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She tore her gaze away, her jaw clenched so tightly she thought she might crack a tooth.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What is wrong with me?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Billy!
   </em>
   ” she barked, her voice sharp enough to cut through the hum of the office, and everything went
        quiet. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Vidal look up too—just a glance, no smirk, no expression, just
   <em>
    looking.
   </em>
   And
   <em>
    god
   </em>
   , Agatha forced herself to stay locked on Billy’s panicked face instead,
        fighting the urge to meet Vidal’s gaze.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She needed to get the hell out of here.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “Move my lunch meeting to now,” she ordered, already on her feet, heading for her coat.
  </p>
<p>
   Billy blinked, stammering, “Um—Ms. Harkness, it’s only 10 AM. I don’t even think the restaurant is—"
  </p>
<p>
   Pulling on her coat with a swift, irritated motion, she fixed him with a look that made him shut up instantly.
  </p>
<p>
   “Figure it out, Pet,” she hissed, brushing past him as if the very air around her was suffocating.
  </p>
<p>
   She stalked down the hallway, her coat billowing behind her with the sheer speed of her steps. Agatha's heels
        clicked sharply against the polished floor, each step echoing like the crack of a whip, a warning to anyone in
        her path. She refused to look toward the war room as she passed it, keeping her eyes fixed straight ahead.
  </p>
<p>
   But god—she could
   <em>
    feel
   </em>
   it. Feel
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   eyes on her. That quiet, insufferable gaze of Rio Vidal
        watching her, and it only made her walk faster. She felt the heat rise in her chest, a frustration she couldn’t
        name, and the need to get away from it—
   <em>
    from her
   </em>
   —was overwhelming.
  </p>
<p>
   The client meeting had gone... okay. Of course, the client wasn’t thrilled about the meeting being pushed two
        hours early, but when Agatha Harkness reschedules, you move with her or don’t move at all. That’s just how it
        worked. By the end of it, Agatha felt steadier, like she’d finally found her footing again, her core settling
        back into place. The tightness in her chest eased.
  </p>
<p>
   She walked back into the office with a singular purpose: head straight to her desk and bury herself in the next
        task. Passing the war room, she was fully determined to keep going—until something stopped her cold.
  </p>
<p>
   The whiteboard was no longer white.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha paused mid-step, her eyes narrowing as they took in the scene through the glass. There, standing next to
        the now-cluttered board, was Vidal, completely immersed in the board. Documents were pinned up, sticky notes
        scattered across the surface, and in the middle of it all, written in that familiar messy handwriting, was a
        name that hit her like a freight train.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Brooke Sinclair.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   And just below it, a picture of the woman herself. Agatha’s heart gave a heavy thump, the kind that pulled her
        forward like she was tethered to the case itself.
  </p>
<p>
   She couldn’t help it. The pull—
   <em>
    this time of the case
   </em>
   , she told herself—had her moving toward the door,
        her hand reaching for the handle before she even realized what she was doing.
  </p>
<p>
   As the door creaked open, Vidal turned, her eyes widening ever so slightly at the sight of Agatha. It was a
        subtle reaction, but one Agatha didn’t miss. And
   <em>
    god
   </em>
   , she took a small, satisfying pleasure in
        catching Vidal off guard. It was a rare thing, and Agatha savored it.
  </p>
<p>
   "Working hard, I see," Agatha said, her voice cool as she stepped into the room. But as soon as the words left
        her mouth, she noticed something that caught her completely off guard— Vidal had shed her green jacket, now
        standing there in just her tailored green pants and a
  </p>
<p>
   crisp white button-down, the sleeves rolled up to her elbows. A dark leather-banded watch hugged her left wrist,
        and the simplicity of it—the rolled sleeves, the effortless confidence— threw Agatha more than she cared to
        admit.
  </p>
<p>
   For a moment, Agatha’s gaze lingered, betraying her control. She wasn’t used to this—being the one caught off
        balance—and it took everything in her to tear her eyes away from Vidal and force her focus back to the board.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Focus on the case.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     The case.
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha repeated to herself, forcing the thought into her head like a mantra.
  </p>
<p>
   "What have you found?" she asked, her voice steadier than she felt as she nodded toward the board and stepped
        forward.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal snapped back to the task, nodding and stepping aside so Agatha could get a clearer view. But Agatha’s
        attention flickered, unwillingly, from the board to Vidal’s rolled-up sleeves, her toned forearms casually on
        display.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ve found a couple of things in the data," Vidal said, pointing at a series of numbers that were
        incomprehensible to Agatha. She nodded absently. "I need more time to see if the pattern repeats itself, but
        there’s something here."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha gave a sharp nod, barely able to keep her mind tethered to the words.
  </p>
<p>
   “And this report..." Vidal reached for a document pinned to the whiteboard, handing it to Agatha. As Agatha took
        it, their fingers brushed again, and the contact sent an unwanted jolt of heat up her arm. She stiffened but
        kept her expression cold, despite the sudden warmth rushing under her skin.
  </p>
<p>
   “This is a logistics report from 2022," Vidal explained, stepping closer as she pointed to a section of the
        report. Agatha could feel the proximity now, the way the air seemed to tighten between them. "It outlines
        shipping containers, their contents, deliveries. But this page—" Vidal reached for the report again, her fingers
        brushing Agatha’s with maddening ease, "— this page was scanned separately from the rest.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes snapped up.
  </p>
<p>
   “How could you possibly know that?” she asked, a little sharper than she intended, trying to shake off the effect
        Vidal’s presence was having on her.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s smirk returned, lazy and confident, and
   <em>
    god
   </em>
   , it sent a pulse of frustration—and something
        else—through Agatha. Vidal leaned in closer, too close, flipping through the pages with a deliberate slowness
        that had Agatha grinding her teeth. Their hands touched again, and Agatha felt her breath catch against her
        will.
  </p>
<p>
   "You see this?" Vidal pointed to a small, nearly imperceptible black dot at the corner of the page. "It’s on
        every page of the report—except for this one."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s brows furrowed.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What was this woman doing to her?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “And why does that matter?” she asked, forcing herself to focus.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal leaned in closer, close enough for Agatha to catch the faint scent of her perfume—a subtle blend of cedar
        and forest, earthy and intoxicating. Agatha’s jaw tightened.
  </p>
<p>
   “Because,” Vidal continued, her voice smooth, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s again as she flipped back to
        the key page. “That dot comes from a scanner defect, something that burned into every page of this report.
        Except page 37.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s gaze snapped to Vidal’s fingers—long, nails short, well manicured, tracing the document. The heat
        between them felt unbearable, almost suffocating.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal glanced at her, satisfaction practically glowing on her face.
  </p>
<p>
   “Which means someone scanned this entire report, removed page 37, and replaced it with a different one from
        another scanner. They are hiding something.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes flicked back to Vidal, heart pounding a little harder than it should have.
  </p>
<p>
   She was good.
  </p>
<p>
   Too good.
  </p>
<p>
   And the way she stood there, just a breath away, that self-satisfied smirk on her face—it set something off in
        Agatha. She hated being off-balance, hated the way her body reacted to Vidal’s closeness.
  </p>
<p>
   But
   <em>
    damn
   </em>
   if it wasn’t getting harder to tear her eyes away.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed, trying to ignore the heat coursing through her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good catch,” she said, her voice tight. “But next time, try not to take so long explaining it.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s smirk didn’t waver; if anything, it sharpened.
  </p>
<p>
   “I didn’t think you minded the details.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha glared at her, trying to push away the pull, the distraction of Vidal’s proximity. She tore her eyes back
        to the board, forcing herself to focus on the case. Her gaze landed on the picture of Brooke Sinclair, and she
        stepped away from Vidal closer to the board.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal tracked her movement, her eyes following the shift.
  </p>
<p>
   “Brooke Sinclair,” she began, her tone more serious, but still carrying that annoying edge of confidence. “I
        think there’s something you and your team might’ve missed with her.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s brow arched, irritation creeping in.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh yeah?” she mocked.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yeah.” Vidal stepped a little closer, filling the gap Agatha tried to between them. “The deep dive your
        investigator did on her—did you catch her text messages with her co-worker, Kelcie?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha frowned, trying to place the name.
  </p>
<p>
   “The engineer at Vanguard?”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal gave a small nod, her eyes meeting Agatha’s with that same challenging gleam.
  </p>
<p>
   “That’s the one.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sighed, her patience hanging by a thread. She hated being led around, especially by someone who was
        clearly enjoying it.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re going to have to give me more than that, Vidal.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal huffed, rolling her eyes in a way that was both exasperated and somehow...endearing. Then, without
        hesitation, she dropped the bomb.
  </p>
<p>
   “They were definitely fucking.”
  </p>
<p>
   The word hit Agatha like a slap—unexpected, raw. Her breath caught in her throat, and for a brief second, her
        mind blanked. The bluntness of it, the way Vidal said it so casually,
   <em>
    so brazenly
   </em>
   —it sent a shockwave
        through her, leaving her momentarily off-balance.
  </p>
<p>
   She stared at Vidal, her expression carefully neutral, but her mind was anything but.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal seemed to realize her slip a beat too late, her face reddening slightly as she quickly corrected herself.
  </p>
<p>
   “I mean—they were definitely having sex,” she amended, clearing her throat and shifting uncomfortably.
  </p>
<p>
   But the damage was done. The word still hung in the air between them, heavy and sharp.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Fucking.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha felt a strange heat crawl up her neck, her pulse quickening despite her best efforts to stay composed.
        There was something about hearing Vidal say it—so bluntly, without apology —that had her struggling to control
        the ripple of tension that passed through her.
  </p>
<p>
   For a split second, Agatha found herself frozen, staring at Vidal’s flushed face, the awkward shift in her
        stance, the way her fingers nervously tapped the edge of the report in her hands. It was such a rare crack in
        Vidal’s usually cool, impenetrable demeanor that Agatha wasn’t sure if she found it amusing or maddening.
  </p>
<p>
   She cleared her throat, trying to force the tension back down, though when she spoke, her voice was tighter than
        she intended.
  </p>
<p>
   “And how exactly did you come to the conclusion they were—” she paused, letting “
   <em>
    fucking
   </em>
   ” linger in
        the air, “
   <em>
    having sex
   </em>
   ? All indications point to them being friends, colleagues who hung out after
        work.”
  </p>
<p>
   "Colleagues have sex," Vidal said casually, her tone so dismissive, so self-assured, as if it were the most
        obvious thing in the world.
  </p>
<p>
   The words hit Agatha harder than she expected. A sharp, visceral reaction stirred inside her, one she couldn’t
        easily tamp down. It wasn’t just the bluntness of the statement—it was the ease with which Vidal said it, as if
        the line between professional and personal was one she could cross without a second thought.
  </p>
<p>
   As if it were normal.
  </p>
<p>
   Expected.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Wanted.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse quickened, her irritation flaring as she tried to smother the deeper, more unsettling emotion
        rising in her chest. She stiffened, her jaw tightening as she forced her voice to remain steady,
        neutral—controlled.
  </p>
<p>
   "Not everyone crosses that line," she replied, her words clipped, but the faint edge in her tone betrayed her.
        She couldn’t help it—something about Vidal’s nonchalance struck a nerve, poking at the carefully constructed
        boundaries Agatha had built over the years.
  </p>
<p>
   The line between personal and professional.
  </p>
<p>
   The line she never crossed.
  </p>
<p>
   “And there’s nothing in Brooke’s profile that suggests she was gay,” she added, as if the facts could reinforce
        her point, could pull her back from whatever slippery slope Vidal had her teetering on. Agatha threw Vidal a
        sharp look before returning her gaze to Brooke’s photo pinned on the board. “Catholic upbringing, only ever
        dated men, Republican farmers for parents.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t usually one for boxing people in, for making assumptions. But sometimes facts were just facts, and
        she needed facts to steady herself. Facts anchored her, gave her control—
   <em>
    and she needed control
   </em>
   —especially now with the storm brewing inside her.
  </p>
<p>
   But Vidal wasn’t even slightly fazed. She snorted, and the sound of casual dismissal stung more than Agatha
        expected.
  </p>
<p>
   “So what? You think religious upbringing and a few boyfriends in her past makes her straight? People are more
        complicated than that.” Vidal leaned in just slightly, her voice low and almost teasing, as if she was enjoying
        this push-and-pull. “Sexuality is not always concrete—it can be fluid—and it can surprise you.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha's jaw tightened, a flicker of heat rising in her chest. She hated the way Vidal spoke with such
        confidence, as if she
   <em>
    knew
   </em>
   something Agatha wasn’t willing to admit. The deliberate playfulness in
        Vidal’s words stoked a fire of irritation, but beneath it, something else churned—something she refused to
        acknowledge.
  </p>
<p>
   “Speaking from experience, Vidal?” Agatha shot back, needing hit back, but unable to keep the edge from her
        voice.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal didn’t miss a beat.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh—I am not straight,” she said so casually, like it was the most natural thing in the world. “I exclusively—”
        she paused, letting
   <em>
    that word
   </em>
   hang between them, charged, lingering, “— see women.”
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Jesus Christ
   </em>
   , Agatha thought.
   <em>
    I’m not going to survive this.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The air felt too thick, too charged, and Vidal was entirely too calm. Too comfortable. Agatha was suddenly
        acutely aware of the way Vidal's eyes hadn’t wavered, how she didn’t flinch or hesitate.
  </p>
<p>
   She was so...unapologetic.
  </p>
<p>
   She had to pull herself together, fast. Mockery was her best weapon, her shield, and she wielded it now.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, how touching that you trusted me enough to come out,” Agatha replied, her voice laced with sarcasm so sharp
        it could cut glass. “I’ll be sure to put a rainbow flag in my pen holder, so you know I’m a proper ally.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words were barbed, dripping with disdain, but deep down Agatha felt the tension rising. The sarcasm came too
        easily, masking the discomfort Vidal’s candor stirred. It wasn’t the
   <em>
    gay
   </em>
   thing—Agatha wasn’t ignorant,
        wasn’t naive. It was the fact that Vidal delivered it with such quiet confidence, like it was a power move. Like
        she was in control.
  </p>
<p>
   And god, Agatha hated how much she respected that. How much she—
   <em>
    no
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     No
    </em>
</strong>
<em>
    .
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha fought against that train of thought. She forced herself to hold her ground, to stay rooted in logic, in
        the facts. She straightened, her chin lifting, eyes narrowing as if daring Vidal to challenge her further.
  </p>
<p>
   “There’s nothing in this case to suggest Brooke was anything but straight.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal didn’t back down. In fact, her smirk deepened, her eyes glittering with that maddening confidence.
  </p>
<p>
   "Really? You’re straight, right?” she asked, her voice a slow, deliberate drawl, like she was savoring the words.
        Letting them hang between them, heavy, charged, deliberate.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha held her ground, but only barely.
  </p>
<p>
   The truth?
  </p>
<p>
   She’d always considered herself straight—
   <em>
    strictly men
   </em>
   . They were uncomplicated, predictable. She didn’t
        like complications, not in her personal life. Professionally, sure, she could outmaneuver anyone, but intimacy?
        She wanted it clean, simple, controlled. She dated men, married one, divorced him, and now she was 48. Too old,
        she told herself, to consider what she never allowed herself to entertain in her youth. Those fleeting thoughts,
        the ones she buried deep.
  </p>
<p>
   But Vidal’s eyes were on her now, and the way they narrowed with predatory curiosity made Agatha’s chest tighten.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Focus
   </em>
   , she commanded herself, trying to keep her expression unreadable, but the charge between them was
        undeniable. She couldn’t ignore it, couldn’t ignore
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal was watching her too closely, taking in every shift, every subtle movement. The silence stretched, and
        Agatha felt the heat rise in her, skin prickling as she fought to maintain control. She glared at Vidal,
        determined to remain stone-faced, unaffected.
  </p>
<p>
   But Vidal wasn’t done. That damn smirk—cocky,
   <em>
    knowing
   </em>
   —stretched across her face.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re telling me,” she said slowly, her voice almost a purr now, “there’s not a single woman in the world you’d
        let into your bed?”
  </p>
<p>
   The question was like a challenge thrown between them, and Agatha could feel the pull, the heat behind the words
        wrapping around her, daring her to engage. Her chest tightened, and for the first time in a long while, she was
        at a loss for words. She opened her mouth, but nothing came out—caught between the raw, unspoken tension in
        Vidal’s gaze and her own need to keep control.
  </p>
<p>
   The silence stretched again, and Vidal’s smirk only deepened, like she’d won something. She leaned back, her body
        relaxed, but her eyes gleaming with triumph.
  </p>
<p>
   “I rest my case,” she murmured, almost mockingly.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt something inside her snap, a pulse of heat rushing through her veins. This was no longer about work,
        no longer about a case. This was personal, a dangerous push-and-pull that had her teetering on the edge.
  </p>
<p>
   And she wasn’t sure which way she wanted to fall.
  </p>
<h1>
   Unlock Thy Hidden Gate
  </h1>
<p>
   Three days later, Agatha sat in the war room, the glow of the overhead lights casting sharp shadows across the
        piles of documents and tangled threads of the Vanguard case. Night had fallen long ago, and while her days were
        consumed by the responsibilities of being a partner —meetings, clients, and the endless fires that required her
        attention—after seven, Agatha was finally able to dive into what she truly craved:
   <em>
    the hunt.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The Vanguard case was different.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Special.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It gnawed at her, demanded her attention, and pulled her in ways she hadn’t felt in years.
  </p>
<p>
   And though she would never,
   <em>
    ever
   </em>
   admit it out loud, Rio Vidal made the chase even more intoxicating.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal was sharper than anyone Agatha had worked with in a long time. The way she could recall details from
        reports she’d read days ago, quoting them word for word, or cite case law with frightening accuracy, was nothing
        short of extraordinary. It was like she had a photographic memory, effortlessly cataloging and retrieving
        information like it was nothing.
  </p>
<p>
   But Vidal was also green.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Agatha wasn’t.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   That’s where the real dance began.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal would unearth something she believed was bulletproof—a key link, a watertight argument—and Agatha would
        systematically tear it apart. She’d poke holes in it until there was nothing left but the shredded remains of
        Vidal’s confidence. But where most would shrink under that kind of scrutiny, Vidal didn’t.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She absorbed it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Every critique, every jab Agatha threw her way, Vidal took it like it was nothing—
   <em>
    no
   </em>
   , not nothing. She
        took each blow like a challenge. Fuel that made her dig deeper, push harder, and come back sharper, more
        determined.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had to hand it to her—Vidal was either a masochist or had the kind of unrelenting resolve that could cut
        through steel.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Probably a little of both
   </em>
   , she thought and that sent Agatha’s mind spiraling.
  </p>
<p>
   Professionally, the working relationship between them had become a well-oiled machine.
  </p>
<p>
   They were
   <em>
    good together.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha hated it.
  </p>
<p>
   She despised how well they worked, the efficiency, the rhythm. She hated that every part of her knew it was true.
  </p>
<p>
   But personally? Privately? That was a different beast entirely. The part of herself Agatha kept locked away,
        tightly controlled, felt like a live wire sparking dangerously next to an open gas can. It was volatile,
        electric, and it was only getting worse.
  </p>
<p>
   Every touch—which Agatha swore was intentional.
  </p>
<p>
   Every look Vidal sent her way.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    That fucking smirk.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The constant challenges. The playful word games. The way Vidal’s lips would quirk ever so slightly when she
        caught Agatha staring—like just now, chewing on the end of a pen cap as if it wasn’t driving Agatha mad.
  </p>
<p>
   It ate at her, little by little, each moment sparking something dangerous. Something Agatha hadn’t felt in a long
        time. She couldn’t remember the last time she’d felt this affected by anyone.
  </p>
<p>
   Not like this.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Never like this.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She needed to get her shit under control.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Control.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It was
   <em>
    everything
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Her rule.
  </p>
<p>
   Her shield.
  </p>
<p>
   Her weapon.
  </p>
<p>
   Her armor.
  </p>
<p>
   But with every passing day, every heated glance from Vidal, every veiled innuendo, Agatha felt that control
        slipping, unraveling bit by bit. And that terrified her.
  </p>
<p>
   And when Agatha was scared—when control seemed just out of reach—she lashed out.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Hard
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   The entire office was walking on eggshells around her. Yesterday, she swore she saw Billy's eyes glisten with
        tears when she tore into him over something he had no control over. But he was closest, and she needed
        something—
   <em>
    someone
   </em>
   —to attack.
  </p>
<p>
   The moment she entered a hallway, senior associates who were quite used to her antics, turned and went the other
        way. She had already driven two new associates to hand in their resignations within the last 48 hours. A
        personal record, really. Usually, it took a week to break them.
  </p>
<p>
   Two in two days? That was impressive, even by her standards.
  </p>
<p>
   Jen, however, was not impressed.
  </p>
<p>
   The two who quit had been
   <em>
    Jen’s
   </em>
   picks—clients' kids, no less. Now, those clients were calling, demanding
        to know why their golden children left the firm in tears, questioning what kind of place they were running.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha braced herself for the usual shovel talk from Jen, the lecture about how they needed to “
   <em>
    play
            nice
   </em>
   ” with important clients. But instead, Jen threw her a curveball that hit her like a brick.
  </p>
<p>
   “Is Nicholas, okay?” Jen had asked, her voice unexpectedly soft, filled with genuine concern.
  </p>
<p>
   The question startled Agatha. Jen was looking at her differently, with something Agatha despised—
   <em>
    pity.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “What?” Agatha snapped, her voice more defensive than she intended. “He’s fine.”
  </p>
<p>
   Jen didn’t blink, just continued to look at her—really
   <em>
    look
   </em>
   at her in a way that made Agatha feel
        exposed.
  </p>
<p>
   "It’s just—I haven’t seen you like this since..." Jen trailed off, but the unspoken words hung heavy between
        them.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s chest tightened. She knew exactly what Jen was talking about.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Since Nicholas was sick.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The memory slammed into her—
   <em>
    unwelcome
   </em>
   , like a sharp sting.
  </p>
<p>
   When Agatha finally died, hopefully it would be a long, long time from now—because she had plenty more things to
        destroy—there was one thing she knew for certain. The first thing she'd do, wherever she ended up, would be to
        find the powers that be, wrap her hands around their necks, and scream:
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    “
   </strong>
<strong>
<em>
     What kind of god gives a three-year-old cancer?!
    </em>
</strong>
<strong>
    ”
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Thankfully it was treatable.
  </p>
<p>
   Modern medicine had advanced just enough for them to catch it in time, treat it, and put Nicholas into remission.
        Now, there was barely a chance it would ever return. But during that time, when he was sick, when her little boy
        had been hooked up to machines, fighting a battle he shouldn’t have ever had to fight... Agatha had lost
        control.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Completely.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She became a monster.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Nothing
   </em>
   survived her wrath.
  </p>
<p>
   She tore through the office like a storm, annihilating everything in her path. Six contempt citations in court—a
        personal record. She fired so many people in the span of those months that the partners had to temporarily strip
        her of the authority to fire anyone because they couldn’t fill positions fast enough.
  </p>
<p>
   No one wanted to work with her. No one wanted to be near her.
  </p>
<p>
   And James, her husband at the time? He was in that group, too.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t surprised when James left. He had always been weak—too weak to handle her, too weak to handle
        Nicholas’s illness, and too weak to shoulder the weight of their world crumbling around them. So, he walked
        away. And Agatha, true to form, didn’t have time to mourn him—didn’t care to, either. She was too busy clawing
        her way back to control.
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t until the remission diagnosis, when the words
   <em>
    “he’s going to be okay”
   </em>
   finally reached her
        ears, that she felt something inside her ease. The only thing that pulled her back from the brink, from the
        chaos she’d become, was the knowledge that Nicholas had survived.
  </p>
<p>
   That she had fought through it and won.
  </p>
<p>
   It was control, pure and simple. It had always been control that kept her anchored.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m glad Nicholas is okay,” Jen said quietly, letting the words linger between them.
  </p>
<p>
   They weren’t friends—
   <em>
    not exactly
   </em>
   —but they were
   <em>
    something
   </em>
   . Her and Jen’s relationship was the
        kind that was built on mutual survival, where only
   <em>
    they
   </em>
   could stab each other in the back and no one
        else. In a weird, twisted way, they protected each other, even while plotting each other’s downfall.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Symbiotic.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The silence between them thickened before Jen snapped out of it, her expression hardening into the familiar
        glare.
  </p>
<p>
   “Stop terrorizing the first years,” Jen warned. “They see you coming and practically sprint in the opposite
        direction. And if I have to take one more call from a client asking why their golden-child left the firm in
        tears—”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s sharp laugh cut her off, the tension between them breaking as she slipped back into her usual bravado.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, please,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes. “You’re just mad that your hires turned out to be incompetent.
        There’s no way those two passed the bar on their own merit. Did you
   <em>
    see
   </em>
   the brief Callaway wrote? It
        looked like it was written in crayon! And don’t get me started on
  </p>
<p>
   Wright. Do you know why I yelled at him? I overheard him asking another associate what
   <em>
    prima facie
   </em>
   meant.”
  </p>
<p>
   Jen’s mouth twitched, fighting back a smile, though the stern look in her eyes remained.
  </p>
<p>
   "Agatha,” she said with a tired sigh. “Just lay off them. I’m running out of excuses for your behavior."
  </p>
<p>
   “Have you tried blaming it on my ‘
   <em>
    mommy issues
   </em>
   ’? That’s what my therapist says.” Agatha quipped,
        earning an eye roll from Jen.
  </p>
<p>
   Jen turned to leave clearly giving up on the battle, but something clicked in Agatha’s mind, and before she could
        stop herself, the words slipped out.
  </p>
<p>
   “Who picked Vidal?”
  </p>
<p>
   Jen froze, brow raised, her eyes flicking toward the war room, then back to Agatha, as if she were trying to
        piece something together. Agatha instantly regretted asking, watching Jen’s lips quirk into a devilish smirk.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why do you ask?” Jen’s voice dripped with amusement, almost taunting.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha fought to keep her face impassive, unwilling to give Jen an inch.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well,” she said carefully, searching for words Jen couldn’t pick apart. “She’s... surprisingly —
   <em>
    not an
            idiot
   </em>
   , unlike the rest of your recruits.”
  </p>
<p>
   Jen’s smirk deepened, her eyes gleaming with amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   “Not an idiot?” repeated Jen with an almost sing-like tone. “That’s high praise coming from you.
   <em>
    Careful
   </em>
   , Agatha, someone might think you actually
   <em>
    like
   </em>
   her.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw tightened, irritation flaring.
  </p>
<p>
   “I don’t
   <em>
    like
   </em>
   anyone, Jen. You know that.”
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, I know,” Jen said, her tone light, teasing. “But you’re curious, aren’t you? She’s gotten under your skin.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed, refusing to take the bait.
  </p>
<p>
   “She’s just competent. Which is more than I can say for the rest of the associates you’ve sent my way.”
  </p>
<p>
   Jen shrugged, unbothered by the jab.
  </p>
<p>
   “Whatever you say.”
  </p>
<p>
   She turned to leave, clearly enjoying the small victory she thought she’d gained, but before walking out the
        door, Jen called over her shoulder.
  </p>
<p>
   “She was Lilia’s pick, by the way.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha froze.
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia—
   <em>
    of course
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia didn’t hire often, but when she did, she had an unshakable talent for picking the good ones. She had a
        sixth sense for potential, seeing things in people that others couldn’t. Agatha knew that all too well—Lilia had
        been the one to poach
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   from her old firm when she was a third-year associate, recognizing her
        potential long before anyone else had.
  </p>
<p>
   If Lilia picked Vidal—then that meant she was special.
  </p>
<p>
   The memory lingered until Vidal’s voice cut through, pulling Agatha out of her thoughts. She jerked slightly,
        realizing she’d missed whatever Vidal had said.
  </p>
<p>
   “What?”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal stood in front of the whiteboard, her expression bored, arms crossed.
  </p>
<p>
   “I want to talk to Kelcie Baker,” she repeated. “She knows something.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha leaned back in her chair, her lips pursing.
  </p>
<p>
   “She won’t talk to us. Vanguard will never allow it without a lawyer present.”
  </p>
<p>
   Before Agatha could react, Vidal stepped forward, moving closer—
   <em>
    too
   </em>
   close, almost hovering over her.
        The proximity made Agatha’s skin prickle with tension.
  </p>
<p>
   “What are you—” Agatha began, but Vidal was already reaching past her, grabbing Agatha’s laptop without
        hesitation. The fact that Vidal’s chest was nearly pressed against her face wasn’t lost on her, and Agatha’s
        irritation flared and
   <em>
    something else
   </em>
   flared.
  </p>
<p>
   “Do you have
   <em>
    any
   </em>
   respect for personal space?” Agatha growled as Vidal moved away, though not far enough
        for her liking—still standing way too close, a teasing smirk playing at the edges of her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal paused mid-typing, glancing at Agatha with that infuriating flash in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “Does me being close to you bother you?” she asked, voice low and loaded with challenge.
  </p>
<p>
   It was such a simple question, but it was delivered like a dare. The way Vidal’s eyes gleamed, the way she stood
        there as if she
   <em>
    knew
   </em>
   exactly how much she was getting under Agatha’s skin, left Agatha bristling with
        frustration and something she still refused to name.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw clenched, her voice steely.
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” she lied. "But I do expect some professionalism."
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal's smirk finally emerged.
  </p>
<p>
   "Of course," Vidal said, her voice dripping with feigned innocence. "Just checking."
  </p>
<p>
   Then she turned back to the laptop, typing away as though the tension between them hadn’t just skyrocketed.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s patience wore thinner with each click of the keys. She was about to snap when Vidal suddenly stood and
        turned the laptop toward her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha leaned forward, her eyes narrowing as she read the screen.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Gay of Thrones: The Dance of the Dragon Queens. Drag Show at the Red Light Tonight
   </em>
   ,” she read aloud,
        her irritation palpable. She exhaled sharply. "And what exactly does this have to do with work?" she practically
        hissed.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s grin grew predatory.
  </p>
<p>
   “Kelcie RSVP’d to the event,” she said, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction. "She’ll be there."
  </p>
<p>
   That caught Agatha’s attention. Her eyes flicked back to the screen, which looked like a unicorn had thrown up a
        rainbow all over it. Interesting.
  </p>
<p>
   “Even if we could get her to talk,” Agatha said slowly, her mind working, “we can’t use anything she says in
        court. It’s hearsay. She’ll never sign an affidavit.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal nodded, not missing a beat.
  </p>
<p>
   “We don’t need her statement. If she gives us something—
   <em>
    anything
   </em>
   —we can use it as a lead. Let her
        point us in the direction we need to follow. Instead of building this case blind, we let her be our compass.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha hated that it wasn’t a terrible idea. In fact, it was annoyingly clever. She chewed over it, her mind
        racing through the possibilities.
  </p>
<p>
   "And what if she won’t talk?" Agatha asked, still searching for any flaw in the plan.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s smirk widened.
  </p>
<p>
   “She’ll talk.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha raised a brow.
  </p>
<p>
   “You sound awfully confident.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal leaned in just slightly, her voice low, almost cockily.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let’s just say I have a way of getting people to open up.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse quickened, but she tamped down the reaction, keeping her expression impassive.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    This woman was impossible
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   She stared at Vidal, then back at the screen, before finally exhaling.
  </p>
<p>
   "Fine. We'll go," Agatha said, her decision already made the moment Vidal mentioned Kelcie’s name. She stood,
        grabbing her purple trench coat from the back of her chair and swinging it on with a practiced ease.
  </p>
<p>
   "We?" Vidal echoed, sounding genuinely surprised. "You’re actually going?"
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned, eyes narrowing as if the very question was an insult.
  </p>
<p>
   "This is
   <em>
    my
   </em>
   case," she said, the weight of authority clear in her tone. "I’m not letting some baby
        lawyer question a key witness—
   <em>
    again
   </em>
   —in
   <em>
    my case
   </em>
   without me there."
  </p>
<p>
   For a brief second, Vidal looked impressed before she masked it with a neutral expression.
  </p>
<p>
   "Okay," she nodded, grabbing her own jacket. "Are we riding together?"
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha laughed at that, the sharp sound echoed in the war room as she moved toward the door, tossing Vidal a
        withering look over her shoulder.
  </p>
<p>
   "
   <em>
    I’ll
   </em>
   be riding in my town car," she said, her eyes scanning Vidal up and down with a hint of
        condescension. "
   <em>
    You
   </em>
   can take an Uber."
  </p>
<p>
   She gave a dismissive wave, her fingers wiggling in a mock farewell.
  </p>
<p>
   "Ta ta," Agatha added, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she sauntered out, a smirk tugging at her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t bother looking back—satisfied with the certainty that Vidal was probably frowning behind her. The
        smirk deepened as she strode down the hallway, savoring the small victory in a game that was becoming more
        intriguing with each move.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn't entirely sure of the rules yet, but she knew one thing
   <em>
    : she was determined to win
   </em>
   .

<p>
   People always assumed Agatha went into law for power,
   <em>
    and sure
   </em>
   , that was partly true.
  </p>
<p>
   But the reality was simpler.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha liked boundaries.
  </p>
<p>
   She liked the law because, while its interpretation could be fluid, its roots ran deep—
   <em>
    immovable
   </em>
   and
        grounded in centuries of precedent. It could sway, but it never broke.
  </p>
<p>
   It was steady, predictable, and Agatha thrived on that steadiness.
  </p>
<p>
   She was
   <em>
    accurately aware
   </em>
   that she was a walking contradiction. A living, breathing oxymoron.
  </p>
<p>
   Outwardly, she was known for being wild, untethered, and completely unpredictable. That was her brand—what made
        her feared and respected in equal measure. But deep down, Agatha craved structure. Rules kept the chaos at bay,
        gave her control in a world that thrived on disorder. She needed boundaries—clear lines to draw and redraw as
        she saw fit.
  </p>
<p>
   So, as Agatha eyed the Red Light bar from the safety of her town car, she knew that she was about step into a
        world far outside her carefully controlled boundaries. The vibrant crowd and the unapologetic energy—it didn’t
        take a genius to see what the Red Light was—a
   <em>
    gay bar.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Only a gay bar would host a "Game of Thrones Drag Night," and only a place like this would have such an eclectic
        crowd gathered outside. Men in everything from skimpy outfits and stilettos to jeans and boots. Women in
        skin-tight dresses or rocking masculine wear with a swagger. Every damn letter of that acronym, LGBTQIA+, was
        out there in full display—an alphabet soup she could hardly keep up with.
  </p>
<p>
   And it wasn’t just the terminology that tripped her up.
  </p>
<p>
   Out there was a world she didn’t know how to navigate.
  </p>
<p>
   Give her a courtroom, a boardroom—
   <em>
    hell
   </em>
   —even a men’s club, and she could walk in like she owned the
        place and leave owning it. But here—outside this place, with its carefree happiness, its
   <em>
    freedom
   </em>
   —it
        was like stepping into a scene from her worst nightmare.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stared out at the crowd, her fingers tapping anxiously against her leg.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t want to go outside.
  </p>
<p>
   The thought of stepping into that world, where everything seemed so loose, so free—it unsettled her in ways she
        wasn’t comfortable acknowledging. It wasn’t the kind of place she belonged, and the idea of being in the middle
        of it made her stomach tighten.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    But she knew she had to.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She refused to still be sitting in this car when Vidal arrived. Refused to let her see even a flicker of
        hesitation. Vidal would be walking into this place like she owned it, slipping into the chaos effortlessly. And
        Agatha couldn’t afford to show a crack in her armor, to show Vidal she was uncomfortable. It was a point she
        wasn’t willing to concede this game they have been playing with each other.
  </p>
<p>
   So with a deep heavy sigh that did nothing to settler her nerves, she shrugged off her coat, because this was
        definitely not the kind of establishment that had a coat check, and she’d be damned if she was going to hang her
        designer jacket over a barstool. Her
   <em>
    Hermes
   </em>
   purse stayed in the car as well; she wasn’t to risk that in
        there. She grabbed only the essentials— cash, credit card, phone—before throwing her hair into a messy bun and
        looked at herself in her pocket mirror to make sure she looked acceptable.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked nervous, and she snapped the pocket mirror closed with a hiss. She closed her eyes, and then, with one
        final inhale, she opened the door and stepped out into the night.
  </p>
<p>
   No one even looked her way when her heels hit the sidewalk.
  </p>
<p>
   Which was rare—Agatha commanded attention when she walked into a room.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    But here?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She was just one among many.
  </p>
<p>
   When you’re sharing space with a 6’5” drag queen, sporting a full beard, flawless makeup, and a barely-there
        dress, well... you’re not exactly the center of attention anymore.
  </p>
<p>
   For once, Agatha wasn’t the shiniest object in the room. It was full of personalities, larger- than-life people
        with confidence radiating from every corner, and—dare she admit it—
   <em>
    some
   </em>
   even larger than hers. But as
        she stepped through the door and into the bar, it felt oddly refreshing.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Nice, even.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Not being recognized.
  </p>
<p>
   Not having every eye on her.
  </p>
<p>
   A few appreciative glances came her way—mostly from impeccably dressed men who eyed her designer clothes and a
        couple from women who seemed to appreciate how well she wore
   <em>
    said clothes
   </em>
   . But for the most part, she
        was just another person at the bar.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And god,
   </em>
   did she need a drink.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Or ten.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha slid onto an empty barstool, her eyes scanning the room before landing on the bartender approaching her.
  </p>
<p>
   The woman was
   <em>
    striking
   </em>
   —blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail, strong, angular features framed by a
        pair of circular glasses. She was dressed in tight black pants and a sleeveless black shirt that showed off
        toned arms covered in intricate, inky tattoos that snaked down both sides. She had that effortless
        hipster/lesbian vibe down pat—too well.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could definitely see the appeal.
  </p>
<p>
   “What can I get you?” the bartender asked, her voice smooth, professional, but carrying a subtle teasing quality.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t hesitate, her gaze lingering a little longer than she intended.
  </p>
<p>
   “The most expensive bourbon you’ve got,” she said, pulling out her credit card and slamming it down on the
        counter with a snap. “And keep it open.”
  </p>
<p>
   The bartender raised an impressed eyebrow as she slid Agatha's sleek black credit card off the counter. Without
        another word, she turned to make the drink, leaving Agatha a moment to scan the room. The place was packed, a
        swirling mass of and if Vidal was here, finding her would be like looking for a needle in a glitter-covered
        haystack.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha cursed under her breath, irritated that she hadn’t insisted on giving Vidal a hard time —of making her
        take an uber. This entire mission to track down Kelcie Baker was already off to a rocky start.
  </p>
<p>
   Just as her frustration began to bubble beneath the surface, Agatha heard the clink of glass sliding across the
        bar top. She turned to see the bartender smiling softly in her direction, bourbon in hand, pushing it towards
        her.
  </p>
<p>
   “One of our finest bourbons, for one of our finest lady,” the bartender teased with a wink, her voice smooth,
        with just the right amount of playfulness.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha grabbed the drink, smirking to herself. There was no harm in a little game while she waited.
  </p>
<p>
   “I bet you say that to all the ladies,” Agatha quipped, raising an eyebrow.
  </p>
<p>
   The bartender’s smile widened, and she leaned in slightly, closing the distance between them.
  </p>
<p>
   “Actually—no,” she replied, her tone dropping to something almost conspiratorial. “Not many people that come here
        can afford a $50 glass of bourbon.”
  </p>
<p>
   “Only $50?” Agatha took a slow sip, exaggerating her grimace a little more than necessary. “It tastes like it
        only cost $50.”
  </p>
<p>
   The bartender chuckled, leaning forward with an easy, knowing smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, the $8 one will really knock your socks off,” she teased.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha laughed, surprising herself. For a moment, the tension in her shoulders eased. But as her eyes swept over
        the bar again, the reason she was there tugged her back to reality.
  </p>
<p>
   Flirting, as nice as it was, could only serve as a distraction for so long.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Where the hell was Vidal?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “Waiting for someone?” the bartender asked, the curiosity in her voice unmistakable.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded, downing the rest of her drink and setting the glass down with a little too much force.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes.”
  </p>
<p>
   “That’s a shame,” the bartender said, her lips quirking up in a smile that Agatha grudgingly admitted was...
   <em>
    effective
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   “What? That I finished my drink so fast?” Agatha asked, still scanning the crowd for any sign of Vidal.
  </p>
<p>
   The bartender shook her head, her eyes locking onto Agatha’s with a look that was far too knowing.
  </p>
<p>
   “That you’re waiting for someone,” she said, the disappointment in her tone softened by that same smile.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s mind stalled for a moment, thrown by the sheer boldness of the bartender’s words. It had been a long
        time since someone had flirted with her so openly, so casually. Of course, there was Vidal, but with her, Agatha
        could never be sure—was Vidal flirting or just testing her boundaries? Pushing her, seeing how far Agatha’s
        control stretched before it snapped?
  </p>
<p>
   But this bartender—
   <em>
    this woman
   </em>
   —wasn’t playing mind games. She was just... flirting. Plain and simple.
        And that,
   <em>
    oddly enough
   </em>
   , was kind of a relief. There were no complex motives, no hidden agenda—just
        pure, uncomplicated interest. And damn if that didn’t stir something deep inside her, something she hadn’t felt
        in longer than she cared to admit.
  </p>
<p>
   She opened her mouth, the response hovering on the edge of something—flirty, playful, she wasn’t even sure what.
        But there was an undeniable pull, a subtle urge to engage, to throw a little heat back into the mix. Then, just
        as the words were forming, she felt it—a hand on her shoulder. At first soft, then firm, fingers curling with
        purpose.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha froze.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Who the hell had the audacity to touch her?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She spun around, ready to deliver a cutting remark, her irritation spiking, when a voice rumbled near her
        ear—low,
   <em>
    familiar
   </em>
   , and entirely too close.
  </p>
<p>
   “There you are,
   <em>
    baby
   </em>
   ,” Vidal murmured, her voice laced with teasing edge. "Sorry to keep you
        waiting..." The hand tightened slightly, fingers pressing with deliberate kind of possession. “There was
   <em>
    traffic
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha hated the shiver that went through her body.
  </p>
<p>
   Hated the way her body responded before her mind could catch up, the curl of heat that swept through her, and the
        way her lips parted ever so slightly, just for a second—
   <em>
    a split second
   </em>
   — where she let herself feel
        Vidal, just like that.
  </p>
<p>
   And
   <em>
    Jesus
   </em>
   , she felt like she was on fire.
  </p>
<p>
   But then, she snapped back to herself. How she found her control, she didn’t know, but she did. She turned to
        face Vidal, standing there in her untucked forest green shirt, dark ash pants, sleeves rolled up, the top
        buttons undone, revealing layered gold chains that caught the dim light against the backdrop of the pale skin of
        her chest.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She hated how good Vidal looked.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Hated even more how it made her feel—restless, hot, and annoyed all at once.
  </p>
<p>
   A fake smile slipped onto her face, the kind that came far more easily than her real ones. If Vidal wanted to
        play this game, Agatha could play it better.
  </p>
<p>
   “Hi,
   <em>
    sweetheart
   </em>
   ,” she said, the word dripping with mock affection, heat woven into the taunt. She
        leaned forward, just enough to watch the subtle way Vidal’s eyes darkened, her jaw tightening as Agatha closed
        the distance between them.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, with her lips barely brushing Vidal’s ear, she whispered, low and dangerous, just for her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Touch me again, and I’ll break your hand.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha had expected Vidal to pull back like she’d been burned, but instead, the woman—
   <em>
    this infuriatingly
            bold woman
   </em>
   —slowly withdrew her hand, her fingertips deliberately trailing down Agatha’s arm.
  </p>
<p>
   There was a spark in Vidal’s eyes, a smirk on her lips that screamed:
   <em>
    I’m a pyromaniac, and I love playing
            with fire, even if it hurts.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Her touch lingered, setting Agatha’s skin ablaze with a sensation she both hated and couldn’t shake. Vidal’s hand
        finally dropped, but her gaze stayed, locked with Agatha’s in a long, charged moment that made the air between
        them thrum with unspoken tension.
  </p>
<p>
   Then, Vidal’s eyes flicked past Agatha’s shoulder, her smirk faltering into a thinner line.
  </p>
<p>
   “Max,” she said, her tone now having a different edge to it.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha, confused, followed her gaze and found the bartender—
   <em>
    Max
   </em>
   —watching them with a raised brow.
  </p>
<p>
   “Rio,” the bartender acknowledged, nodding with a familiarity that annoyed Agatha more than she’d admit. Max’s
        eyes shifted to Agatha, her earlier flirtation replaced by something more subdued, almost apologetic.
  </p>
<p>
   “Another drink?” Max asked, reaching for Agatha’s empty glass.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded, momentarily at a loss for words, watching as Max turned to prepare her drink. The moment stretched
        between them, leaving Agatha alone with Vidal again, and she could feel the tension settling back into place as
        smoothly as before.
  </p>
<p>
   Turning to Vidal, she raised a brow, her voice laced with mockery.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    A friend of yours
   </em>
   ?” she asked, savoring the slight crack—just the tiniest tick at the corner of
        Vidal’s mouth—that appeared at her question.
  </p>
<p>
   The sound of glass sliding against the bar echoed behind them, and Vidal threw Agatha a glance before stepping
        forward. Her body brushed against Agatha’s for a fleeting moment as she reached around her, fingers curling
        around a beer bottle that hadn’t been there before. Agatha’s skin tingled where they’d touched, but before she
        could register it, Vidal had pulled back, taking a slow drink from the bottle, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” Vidal finally said, her tone calm, detached, like she was closing the door on a conversation that Agatha
        had barely started.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips pursed, unsatisfied.
  </p>
<p>
   She had
   <em>
    finally
   </em>
   felt the crack, and she wasn’t ready to let it go—not when she’d finally found a way
        through Vidal’s carefully crafted armor. Her eyes flicked to the beer in Vidal’s hand.
  </p>
<p>
   She hadn’t ordered it, and yet it was there, as if summoned.
  </p>
<p>
   The connection clicked in Agatha’s mind.
  </p>
<p>
   “Come here often?” she drawled trying to find another way to slip past her defenses, to land another blow.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s gaze sharpened, but instead of biting back, she raised the bottle again, taking another slow, deliberate
        sip.
  </p>
<p>
   And Agatha’s jaw clenched involuntarily, hating how good Vidal looked with the bottle pressed to her lips, framed
        by the strobing lights from the dance floor. She looked like she’d stepped right out of one of those
        over-sexualized beer commercials—effortlessly tempting, the kind of image men—
   <em>
    or Agatha
   </em>
   , if she had
        no taste and an unfinished basement—would tack up on the wall.
  </p>
<p>
   The thought of Vidal’s effect on her had Agatha gritting her teeth, irritation mixing with something else she
   <em>
    still refused to name
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   And judging by the knowing look Vidal threw her way as she lowered the beer bottle from her lips, Vidal was well
        aware of the reaction she was causing.
  </p>
<p>
   “Have you seen her yet?” Vidal asked, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s, not even bothering to glance around the
        bar.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt a rush of relief.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Work
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Thank god.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Snapping back to the task at hand, her nerves settled like a gentle rain after a storm. She didn’t show it, of
        course—her expression remained as impassive as ever—but the distraction of the case was welcome. It gave her
        something solid to grip onto, something familiar to ground herself in.
  </p>
<p>
   “Not yet,” she said, her voice cool and controlled, though the shift in focus steadied her more than she’d like
        to admit.
  </p>
<p>
   "Then let's grab a seat," Rio suggested, her voice easy, almost nonchalant. "The show’s about to start, and we’ll
        have a better chance of spotting her once everyone’s settled."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded, not trusting herself to say anything. She stood up, flicking her hand dramatically for Vidal to
        lead the way.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal smirked but didn’t push it, as she turned to walk away.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha followed, sharply aware of the shift in energy as they moved through the crowd. It wasn’t so much that
        people were looking at them—no, they were looking at
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Vidal.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She was the kind of woman who drew attention effortlessly. Agatha could feel the curious glances, the subtle
        stares of appreciation, but what really caught her off guard was the way several women looked at Vidal.
  </p>
<p>
   Those looks weren’t just admiration—they were steeped in history.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Longing.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Something unfamiliar and unwelcome flared in Agatha’s chest as she caught those glances. She hated how much they
        bothered her, how much they twisted something sharp inside her.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal led them to a table and, with that infuriating smirk still playing on her lips, pulled out a chair for
        Agatha, eyes glinting with amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha shot her a glare, refusing to play into it. She grabbed her own chair with deliberate spite and sat down.
  </p>
<p>
   It was supposed to be a power move, a silent declaration that she was in control here—but instead of backing
        down, Vidal just snorted, amused, and sat down in the very chair she’d originally pulled out for Agatha. She sat
        down and took a drink, not surprised nor affected by Agatha’s little display at all.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Damn her.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha grabbed her drink, taking a healthy sip, hoping to drown the restless energy coursing through her. She
        hated the way her nerves buzzed under her skin, even more so when she glanced at Vidal, lounging back in her
        chair, casually sipping her beer like they were at some beachside resort. It was unnerving how at ease she
        seemed, how unbothered she was by everything.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s fingers tightened around her glass, her frustration building. She opened her mouth, ready to snap
        something sharp and cutting, but the words were swallowed by the sudden shift in the room. The music faded,
        giving way to the familiar, dramatic swell of the
   <em>
    Game of Thrones
   </em>
   theme. The lights dimmed even
        further, casting everything in shadows, as a wave of cheers erupted around them—catcalls, squeals, hollers from
        all sides.
  </p>
<p>
   The crowd surged like a living tide, the dance floor clearing as people scrambled for seats, crammed around
        tables, or lined up against the walls, their excitement palpable. Agatha watched with guarded curiosity, unsure
        of what to expect.
  </p>
<p>
   But the drag show that followed was, quite possibly, one of the most entertaining things Agatha had ever
        witnessed. She had a secret love for Broadway, and if there was one thing she knew, it was how a sprinkle of sex
        appeal could elevate a performance. These men—no,
   <em>
    these women
   </em>
   —were simply magnificent. The pageantry,
        the confidence, the humor—it was spellbinding. More than once, she caught herself smiling, drawn in by the
        energy of it all.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, a queen dressed as a scantily clad Cersei Lannister sauntered by their table, her hips swaying in time
        to the music as she collected dollar bills from the crowd. Agatha, not one to be left out, reached into her
        pocket and pulled out a bill, and without a second thought, she handed one over.
  </p>
<p>
   The queen’s eyes widened in shock, her expression turning reverent as she dramatically bowed before Agatha,
        sending a ripple of laughter through the nearby crowd, before moving on.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal, who had been watching with amused disbelief, finally broke into laughter.
  </p>
<p>
   "Did you just give that drag queen a hundred?" she asked, her voice a mix of shock and amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned to her with a casual shrug.
  </p>
<p>
   “It was all I had.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal just shook her head, still laughing.
  </p>
<p>
   "You shouldn’t have done that," she said, her eyes gleaming with a mischievous glint.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha frowned, confused.
  </p>
<p>
   "Why not? Isn't that what people do?"
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal leaned back in her chair, taking a swig of her drink, her grin spreading wider.
  </p>
<p>
   "Oh, you'll see," she said in a teasing, sing-song voice, clearly enjoying whatever inside joke she was keeping
        to herself.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And sure as shit
   </em>
   , nine performances later, the show ended, and Agatha was out a thousand bucks. Turns
        out, drag queens are greedy little things. They kept coming back to her table, their eyes lighting up as soon as
        they saw the woman who’d handed out a hundred like it was pocket change.
  </p>
<p>
   Not that Agatha really minded. She’d definitely spent a thousand dollars on things far less enjoyable, and
        watching the queens work the crowd was worth every bill.
  </p>
<p>
   Still, she couldn’t help but throw Vidal a sideways glance, seeing the smug amusement that had settled on her
        face.
  </p>
<p>
   "Enjoying yourself?" Agatha asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm, though even she couldn’t hide the smirk
        tugging at her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal chuckled, leaning in slightly.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, absolutely. Watching you get worked by the queens?
   <em>
    Worth every second
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha rolled her eyes, though she couldn't completely stifle her own amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   "I'll consider it charity," Agatha quipped, tossing back the last of her drink. "A tax write-off."
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal smirked at that, but then her eyes flicked past Agatha’s shoulder, narrowing with sharp focus. The
        playfulness evaporated, and her entire demeanor shifted.
  </p>
<p>
   "There she is," Vidal murmured, nodding behind Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse quickened. She turned to follow Vidal's gaze, and there she was—Kelcie Baker. For a brief moment,
        during the show, amid the banter and drinks, Agatha had almost forgotten why they were there. But seeing Kelcie
        now, flesh and blood, brought everything rushing back.
  </p>
<p>
   A different kind of excitement stirred through her—sharp, electric. Like a shark that had just caught the scent
        of blood in the water.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned back to Vidal, their eyes locking, and the atmosphere between them shifted. The smirks and teasing
        exchanged during the show were gone, replaced by something more charged, something with weight.
  </p>
<p>
   The drag show had been the opening act.
  </p>
<p>
   But this?
  </p>
<p>
   This was the main event.
  </p>
<p>
   And the real show was about to begin.
  </p>
<h1>
   The Tower Reversed
  </h1>
<p>
   Agatha's eyes studied Vidal, feeling the tension between them shift. This was the moment, the one they’d been
        building toward all night, and the weight of it settled heavily on her shoulders. The air in the bar seemed to
        thicken, the background noise fading as she focused on the task ahead.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well, this was your plan,” she said slowly, her voice straddling the line between mocking and serious. “So,
        what’s the grand idea for getting her to talk?”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s eyes flicked toward Kelcie Baker, narrowing slightly as she watched her sip her drink, seemingly
        oblivious to the fact that she was being hunted. Then, Vidal turned back to Agatha, her expression unreadable,
        the usual playful glint replaced with something more calculating.
  </p>
<p>
   “She might recognize you,” Vidal said quietly, her voice steady, betraying none of the nerves that Agatha
        expected. “Let me handle it.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s immediate reaction was visceral. A surge of discomfort hit her chest like a punch, and she stiffened.
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” she said sharply, the absurdity of
   <em>
    that idea
   </em>
   having her nearly bite Vidal’s head off. “Have you
        ever even questioned someone before?”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal merely shrugged, calm as ever—
   <em>
    and gods
   </em>
   Agatha both hated and respected Vidal’s ability to deal
        with her.
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” she answered truthfully, but looked Agatha in the eye when she spoke next. “But this isn’t a deposition,”
        she replied, the edge of a smirk pulling at her lips. “It’s a conversation. Between two lesbians at a bar.”
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Lesbian.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The word hit Agatha with a strange, unexpected force. The simplicity of it, the way Vidal just said it—
   <em>
    like
            it was nothing
   </em>
   . But it wasn’t nothing, not to Agatha. It rang in her head, making her feel unsettled in
        a way she hated to admit. Her jaw tightened as she tore her gaze away, pretending that the word didn’t rattle
        her.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal leaned forward, her voice softer now, more controlled—calculated.
  </p>
<p>
   “Look,” she said, drawing Agatha's gaze back to her, “Kelcie’s not going to open up if she feels cornered. She’s
        here to relax, maybe let her guard down. She’s not expecting to be interrogated. Let me talk to her. We need her
        to trust us.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes flicked back to Kelcie, who was still oblivious, chatting with a group of friends at the bar.
   <em>
    It was true
   </em>
   —Agatha’s presence would be too much. There was a chance that she didn’t know who Agatha
        was, but if she did—
   <em>
    if she did know
   </em>
   she was the lawyer currently
  </p>
<p>
   representing Brooke Sinclair and trying to bring down the company she worked for, well then there was no way she
        was going to talk.
  </p>
<p>
   She hated it.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Hated this.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The thought of letting Vidal take control gnawed at Agatha, a constant, bitter tug-of-war between the logic that
        insisted she let go and the fierce instinct to keep her grip on everything. The tension in her chest tightened
        as she stared at Vidal, trying to force herself to consider it, but her body seemed to revolt at the very idea.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    I don’t like it
   </em>
   ,” she snapped, the words sharper than she’d intended, her voice laced with the
        frustration she’d been barely holding back.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal,
   <em>
    unsurprisingly
   </em>
   , didn’t flinch.
  </p>
<p>
   She never did.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, she just watched Agatha, her gaze steady, as if peeling back layers and seeing straight into the heart
        of her. She tilted her head slightly, a habit that told Agatha she was sizing her up, finding something buried
        there. And then, as if satisfied, Vidal leaned back in her chair, adopting that maddeningly laid-back posture
        that made Agatha want to kick the chair right out from under her.
  </p>
<p>
   “You don’t have to like it,” Vidal said, her voice smooth and calm, each word measured but unshakable. Her eyes
        held a glint, flashing in the strobe lights from the dance floor—a barely veiled challenge that was impossible
        to ignore. “
   <em>
    But you do have to let me do it
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s teeth ground together.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Gods—she was right.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha knew it, but knowing didn’t make the bitter pill any easier to swallow.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Fine
   </em>
   ,” she ground out, the word barely escaping before she felt every instinct in her body revolt.
        The surrender tasted sour, her control clawing its way back up her throat, fighting to snatch the words from the
        air and drag them back, keep them safely under her grasp. But it was too late; the words had already slipped,
        and Vidal was already moving to stand.
  </p>
<p>
   Desperate to reclaim some sense of authority, she shot out a warning. “If you mess this up—”
  </p>
<p>
   But Vidal, halfway to her feet, moved with an infuriatingly easy confidence, a grace that seemed to mock Agatha’s
        attempt to hold onto any last shreds of control. Her calm was maddening, her stride steady as if she had owned
        this outcome from the start. And just as Agatha forced out the rest of her warning, Vidal stopped beside her,
        then bent down, close enough that her breath was a whisper against Agatha’s ear, her voice soft, teasing, and
        maddeningly calm.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “I got this, boss.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The words were a soft taunt, and they sent a jolt down Agatha’s spine.
  </p>
<p>
   For just a split second, she was frozen, her pulse spiking in response. Vidal’s breath lingered too close to her
        skin, and Agatha hated how much it got to her. And then with a smirk that Agatha didn’t need to see to feel,
        Vidal pulled away and walked off, moving toward Kelcie like she owned the moment.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed, watching with a mixture of irritation and curiosity. Vidal had swagger,
   <em>
    sure
   </em>
   ,
        but this was where it mattered—where her confidence would either pay off or crumble. Agatha leaned back in her
        chair, eyes fixed on the scene, watching because that was the only thing she could do.
  </p>
<p>
   Kelcie stood in a crowded part of the bar, people pressed shoulder to shoulder. Vidal moved smoothly through the
        throng, slipping between bodies with ease. And then, as if by accident, Agatha watched as Vidal fumbled with her
        phone, letting it dangle carelessly by her side. Just as she passed Kelcie, the phone “
   <em>
    slipped
   </em>
   ” from
        her hand, landing right on Kelcie’s foot.
  </p>
<p>
   Kelcie startled, bending down to grab the phone, and Agatha could already see it—the bait had been taken. Vidal
        kept walking, seemingly unaware, until Kelcie called after her, holding out the phone.
  </p>
<p>
   The look of innocent surprise that crossed Vidal’s face was pure gold.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha almost smirked.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a clever move, a casual icebreaker that didn’t reek of manipulation—
   <em>
    at least not on the surface
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Nice move,
   </em>
   Agatha thought, grudgingly impressed as Vidal turned back, flashing easy charm and a
        practiced smile as she accepted the phone from Kelcie. But this was where it counted— whether Vidal could really
        deliver. Agatha’s eyes narrowed as she leaned forward, watching intently.
  </p>
<p>
   Twenty minutes later, Agatha wasn’t sure if she hated the game or hated that Vidal was winning it.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    It was obvious
   </em>
   —Vidal knew exactly what she was doing. Kelcie was engaged, smiling, laughing—
   <em>
    hell
   </em>
   , was she blushing?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What in God’s name had Vidal said to her to get her blushing life like that?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t sure if she wanted to know or if it would just piss her off more.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Why did this bother her so much?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Vidal was doing her job—getting Kelcie to open up, to talk.
  </p>
<p>
   She was doing exactly what she had promised, but it gnawed at Agatha in a way she couldn’t fully explain. Kelcie
        wasn’t just talking; she was hanging on Vidal’s every word. Laughing at every joke. Smiling at every teasing
        remark.
  </p>
<p>
   Then Vidal laughed.
  </p>
<p>
   The sound, bright and carefree, sliced through the noise of the bar like a knife, catching Agatha off guard. And
        for the first time, Vidal’s smile wasn’t a smirk, wasn’t teasing or predatory—it was genuine, soft, and...
   <em>
    beautiful
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s chest tightened, the realization hitting harder than she liked.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal reached out, still laughing, and her hand brushed Kelcie’s arm, fingers lingering just a moment longer than
        necessary. The movement was subtle, but it was impossible to miss.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw clenched as she remembered how those same fingers had felt on her hand when the exchanged reports,
        or when they curled into her shoulder. The thought caused an uncomfortable twist in her stomach, and as if she
        was reacting to the unknown emotion that curled inside her, she shoved herself up from her chair, nearly
        knocking it over in the process. The sharp sound of wood scraping against the floor barely registered as she
        turned on her heel and walked away.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She needed a fucking drink.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha marched to the bar and found an open seat, settling into it with more force than necessary. She still made
        sure she chose a spot at the bar, that she could still see them—
   <em>
    Vidal and Kelcie
   </em>
   . Their heads pressed
        together now, speaking in low, intimate voices as if the rest of the bar didn’t exist, and she gritted her teeth
        and looked away.
  </p>
<p>
   It was then she caught the eye of the bartender—
   <em>
    Max
   </em>
   , who raised a brow in surprise at her presence
        back at the bar.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t wait for her to approach. She just held up two fingers, her expression flat. Max, thankfully
        understood and gave a nod and, this time, grabbed the bottle bringing it straight over to her. She placed the
        two glasses in front of Agatha and started pouring.
  </p>
<p>
   The moment the first glass was poured, Agatha snatched it and downed nearly all of it in one go, wincing as the
        burn hit her throat, but welcoming the familiar buzz that followed.
  </p>
<p>
   She glanced back at Vidal and Kelcie. Her stomach twisted in a way she didn’t want to acknowledge as she watched
        them huddle even closer, Vidal smiling while Kelcie animatedly waved her hands, clearly caught up in whatever
        they were discussing.
  </p>
<p>
   “She does that,” came a voice, breaking Agatha out of her reverie. She turned to see Max pushing the second drink
        towards her.
  </p>
<p>
   “What?” Agatha snapped, turning to see Max, hands raised in a mock surrender that practically screamed,
   <em>
    Don’t
            shoot the messenger.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Max met her gaze calmly, then nodded toward Vidal and Kelcie with a tilt of her head.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Rio
   </em>
   ,” Max clarified, leaning easily against the bar. “She’s got a knack for pulling you in, then
        leaving you high and dry. I swear, the number of tears women have cried over Rio Vidal could mop this whole
        floor clean.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes widened, surprise flickering across her face. Her knowledge of Vidal barely extended beyond their
        work relationship—she was sharp, devilishly smart, and had that infuriating confidence that both fascinated and
        grated on her. But
   <em>
    this
   </em>
   —this was new territory.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Personal
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   And the thought of piecing together the fragments of who Vidal was beyond the office sent a thrill down her
        spine. The idea of knowing her better, even understanding her... it was as both exhilarating and as it was
        dangerous.
  </p>
<p>
   “Really? So, what—she’s a player?” Agatha’s voiced curiously, but it was still edged with more bitterness than
        she’d intended.
  </p>
<p>
   Max shrugged, a knowing glint in her eye.
  </p>
<p>
   “I wouldn’t say a player, exactly. She’s just allergic to commitment. Doesn’t hurt them intentionally. She sets
        her rules upfront. But women fall for her anyway.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s grip on the glass tightened, the warmth of the bourbon doing nothing to settle the growing frustration
        in her chest. She threw back the rest of her drink, savoring the brief burn in her throat, hoping it would numb
        whatever gnawed at her insides.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well, you don’t have to worry about that with me,” she said, the words clipped, sharp—an attempt to shut down
        the conversation before it could veer into even more dangerous territory.
  </p>
<p>
   Max raised an eyebrow, leaning in just a fraction closer, the teasing smile never leaving her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “You sure about that?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s glare was
   <em>
    ice-cold
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes. We’re colleagues.
   <em>
    That’s it
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Max chuckled, not at all phased.
  </p>
<p>
   “Hmm... so, does that mean you’re single, then?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha set the empty glass down with a bit more force than intended, the sound loud against the polished wood of
        the bar and reached for the second one. This woman was tenacious she would give her that, but surprisingly she
        wasn’t in the mood for games, and she glared at her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Don’t you have a job to do?”
  </p>
<p>
   Max shrugged unphased, still grinning.
  </p>
<p>
   “I haven’t taken my 20-minute break yet.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the smoothness of the response.
  </p>
<p>
   “Just like that?”
  </p>
<p>
   “Just like that," answered Max said, her tone dancing with a hint of playfulness, eyes bright with amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha took a slow breath, her mind working through the strange sensations going at war within her, and hated
        that her thoughts immediately darted to Vidal—the very reason she was even in this god-forsaken place and
        feeling
   <em>
    whatever these feelings were
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   And to her surprise, Vidal’s gaze was already on her, dark and narrowed, the playful look she’d worn moments ago
        replaced with something fierce and smoldering. Her jaw was set tight, and Agatha swore she could feel the heat
        of her gaze even across the room. Then, almost like a flash of lightning, Vidal’s eyes flickered to Max, a spark
        of something unmistakable and raw.
  </p>
<p>
   But in a blink, it was gone, as Vidal was forced to engage with Kelcie again.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Well, that was interesting.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The uncomfortable, roiling feeling that had been knotting her chest like sour milk in the sun suddenly shifted,
        morphing into something she knew well.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Excitement
   </em>
   —a thrill, the anticipation of a game worth playing.
  </p>
<p>
   She turned back to Max, letting a sly smirk pull at her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “You know what? You do look tired,” she murmured, her voice low.
  </p>
<p>
   Max raised an eyebrow at the shift in her body language and tone, clearly intrigued.
  </p>
<p>
   "Do I?" Max echoed, a hint of challenge in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mmhmm.” Agatha patted the empty seat beside her, her smile widening. “You should sit.
   <em>
    Take a break
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Max chuckled, pausing just long enough to give Agatha a playful look before shrugging, a silent,
   <em>
    Alright,
            let’s play.
   </em>
   She called over her shoulder to announce her break, then turned to walk around the bar,
        moving slowly enough to give Agatha time to steal one more glance at Vidal.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s eyes were still on her, intense and unyielding, her posture rigid. A thrill pulsed through Agatha; she
        smirked, letting the smirk morph into something that felt like a dare. She held Vidal’s gaze, savoring the
        tension, practically daring her to look away first. But just then, Max slipped into the chair beside her, and
        Agatha was pulled back, forcing herself to look away.
  </p>
<p>
   Around them, the bar pulsed with energy: laughter, clinking glasses, the distant beat of music. But Agatha’s
        focus tightened, split between Max’s relaxed smile in front of her and the slow-
  </p>
<p>
   burn heat she could feel from Vidal’s gaze, burning over Max’s shoulder like a low flame.
  </p>
<p>
   Max had been talking to her for ten minutes now, but Agatha could barely recall a word. Max —
   <em>
    poor woman
   </em>
   —was just a pawn in this chess game between her and Vidal. And Agatha was the queen, every move calculated,
        manipulating the board with a familiar, addictive rhythm— like closing a case, like the precise path to victory.
  </p>
<p>
   All she had to do was topple Vidal, and she would win.
  </p>
<p>
   As Max leaned in to speak again, Agatha’s eyes drifted back to Vidal.
  </p>
<p>
   Arms crossed, Vidal stood beside Kelcie, who was still chattering away, unaware. But Vidal’s gaze flicked back to
        Agatha, her dark eyes razor-focused, holding Agatha’s stare like a challenge.
  </p>
<p>
   This suddenly, didn’t feel like a game anymore.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a charged, tenuous line straining to hold, and Agatha’s pulse thrummed at the thought of it finally
        snapping. She felt the thrill of risk, a spark of defiance, and decided to push it further.
  </p>
<p>
   She turned to Max, leaning in close, her hand lingering on the bartender’s arm as she traced a fingertip along a
        tattoo winding around her shoulder and down her arm.
  </p>
<p>
   “Tell me about this one,” she asked, her tone laced with interest.
  </p>
<p>
   Max’s eyes brightened, launching into the story behind the ink, her excitement evident. Agatha nodded along,
        smiling, but her gaze kept darting over Max’s shoulder, searching for Vidal. When she finally looked up again,
        there she was—watching her with an intensity that made her heart jump.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s defiant streak flared. She didn’t pull her hand from Max’s arm; instead, she leaned in closer, her
        fingers tracing another tattoo thoughtfully as she murmured.
  </p>
<p>
   “And this one?”
  </p>
<p>
   Her hand practically caressed Max’s arm, her smile edged with challenge.
  </p>
<p>
   Her fingers trailed down Max’s arm, lingering just enough to toe the line between playful and intentional, her
        smile edged with challenge. Max launched into another story, her enthusiasm bright and infectious, and Agatha
        feigned a laugh, all the while savoring the quiet thrill of Vidal’s gaze, the awareness that her actions were
        stirring something in her. She glanced up, craving Vidal’s reaction, eager to see what she’d make of her
        lingering touches on Max.
  </p>
<p>
   But Vidal was gone.
  </p>
<p>
   In her place stood Kelcie, grinning goofily as she chatted with her friends. Agatha’s stomach twisted slightly at
        the sight. Where had Vidal gone? She scanned the room, eyes sharp and searching, feeling a pang of
        disappointment she couldn’t quite place. Just as she was about to
  </p>
<p>
   give up, a familiar hand landed on her shoulder, firm, fingers curling just enough to command her attention.
  </p>
<p>
   She nearly jumped.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Nearly.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha forced herself to turn slowly, drawing out the moment with a lazy, practiced ease. She looked up with mock
        surprise, her tone dripping with feigned innocence.
  </p>
<p>
   "Oh... hi," she drawled, letting the words linger in the air as her gaze met Vidal’s, who stood far too close,
        her expression unreadable but intense.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s eyes narrowed, and Agatha fought to keep her face neutral, holding back the gleeful smirk threatening to
        break free. She had gotten under Vidal’s skin, and that knowledge sparked something wild and undeniable in her.
  </p>
<p>
   “You ready to go?” Vidal’s voice was low, rough, and it sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine that she did her best
        to ignore.
  </p>
<p>
   But Agatha wasn't done playing.
  </p>
<p>
   She was having too much fun.
  </p>
<p>
   “Hmm... no, actually,” she said, her own smirk defiant. "Max and I were just getting acquainted.” Her fingers
        lingered on Max’s arm, her touch almost a dare.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s gaze flicked to Max, then returned to Agatha, unreadable and steady, like a storm waiting to break. Her
        words came out measured, each one laced with tension.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “I think you should cash out.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha tilted her head, feeling the heat flare between them, igniting something fierce and familiar in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha Harkness didn’t take orders—especially not from a first-year associate. Not in her professional life, not
        in her personal life, and certainly not here.
  </p>
<p>
   She raised a brow, her voice measured and dangerous.
  </p>
<p>
   “You know, what? I’ll take that as a suggestion,” she said slowly, each word a deliberate warning. “Because the
        only other option for what
   <em>
    that was
   </em>
   is a line you definitely don’t want to cross with me—”
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Agatha—

     Cash. Out

    .”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Her breath hitched.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Oh.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The way Vidal said her name was something she hadn’t expected—something she certainly didn’t expect to be so...
        intoxicating. Agatha was used to hearing her name in every tone: curt, reverent, exasperated—but never like
        this. Vidal had wrapped herself around the syllables, dragging the her name over hot coals, leaving it
        smoldering in the air between them.
  </p>
<p>
   And it wasn’t just her name that unraveled her. She should be furious—
   <em>
    livid, even
   </em>
   —that Vidal dared to
        think she could give her an order.
  </p>
<p>
   But the truth?
  </p>
<p>
   The truth clawed its way into her chest with brutal clarity: she wasn’t angry at all.
  </p>
<p>
   The realization felt like a punch to the gut.
  </p>
<p>
   Her control—the one thing she relied on, the one constant she clung to—was slipping from her grasp.
  </p>
<p>
   And what was more unsettling?
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t want a choice in this, not right now.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Not with Rio Vidal.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Vidal’s gaze lingered, sharp and searching, before she leaned in close, her voice brushing against Agatha’s ear
        in that same low, gravelly tone that seemed designed to unravel her.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ll be outside waiting.”
  </p>
<p>
   With one last look, a brief flicker toward Max, Vidal turned and walked away, cutting through the crowd with a
        confidence that didn’t need to look back.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart pounded louder than the bass reverberating from the speakers, each beat unsettlingly out of
        rhythm. She watched Vidal disappear into the though the door, her pulse drumming with an intensity she hadn’t
        felt in—
   <em>
    ever
   </em>
   ?
  </p>
<p>
   A touch grazed her knee, jolting Agatha out of her thoughts. She blinked, clearing the haze as she realized Max
        was still there, watching her intently.
  </p>
<p>
   “Where were we?” Max’s voice was suggestive, her gaze soft, inviting.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes drifted to the door where Vidal had disappeared, her chest tightening with a nameless urgency, a
        fire that crawled up her spine, insistent and consuming.
  </p>
<p>
   “Cash me out,” she said, her voice sounding foreign even to herself, shaky and unstable.
  </p>
<p>
   Max’s brow furrowed, the confusion clear.
  </p>
<p>
   “What?”
  </p>
<p>
   Fully turning to her now, Agatha’s gaze locked onto Max’s, the urgency driving her words before she could
        second-guess herself.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Cash me out
   </em>
   ,” she repeated, the sharp edge unmistakable, as she moved her knee out of Max’s reach.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re... not serious?” Max’s eyes widened, disbelief flickering across her face.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha leaned in, her breath mingling with the scent of bourbon, fingers gripping the edge of the bar as if
        anchoring herself to something solid. Her voice dropped, slow and deliberate, every word carrying weight like a
        stone sinking into deep water.
  </p>
<p>
   "You don’t know me very well,
   <em>
    but you’re about to if I have to repeat myself again
   </em>
   ."
  </p>
<p>
   Max’s face shifted, the playful glint fading as Agatha’s words hung heavy in the air. She hesitated for just a
        heartbeat, taking in the weight of Agatha’s gaze before she nodded, all pretense gone.
  </p>
<p>
   The unspoken message was clear:
   <em>
    the game was over
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   As Max turned away to retrieve the check, Agatha’s attention drifted to the door where Vidal had vanished, her
        chest tightening with an unfamiliar mix of anticipation and tension. The echo of Vidal’s command lingered in her
        mind like an electric hum, impossible to ignore, sparking something deep inside her that she didn’t even know
        was there.
  </p>
<p>
   Left alone, minutes dragged on, each second winding her thoughts tighter.
  </p>
<p>
   Why did Vidal’s words still pulse in her head, stirring something restless, something almost primal?
  </p>
<p>
   When Max finally returned, Agatha didn’t bother looking at the bill, simply scribbling her signature on the slip
        with a practiced flick of the wrist, sliding it back across the bar without a second thought.
  </p>
<p>
   “I thought we had something there,” Max’s voice broke through, a teasing edge still lingering in her tone, though
        it was laced now with something more—curiosity, maybe, disappointment.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes flicked up, cool and sharp, the heat she felt inside hidden under layers of practiced indifference.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m straight,” she said, the words biting, dismissive.
  </p>
<p>
   Max snorted at that, a soft, knowing sound as she slid the card back across the bar with a smirk tugging at her
        lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “Sure, you are,” she muttered, a hint of amusement curling in her voice.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t respond, she simply picked up her card and turned toward the door. The truth settled heavily in her
        chest, lingering with each step as she left behind the bar and Max’s
  </p>
<p>
   knowing smirk. The bourbon hummed in her veins, but it was the thought of Vidal waiting outside that ignited
        something deeper,
   <em>
    hotter
   </em>
   —something she wasn’t ready to face.
  </p>
<p>
   But Agatha Harkness didn’t run. Not from anyone, and certainly not from herself.
  </p>

   Chapter Notes
   <p>
    I am going to be gone all day tomorrow for my birthday, so no new chapter will come out. To make up for it, here is a double drop. See you Sunday!
    <br/>
</p>
</code>
<p>
   Agatha stepped out into the night, letting the crisp air wash over her heated skin. She could chalk up her
        flushed cheeks to the packed bar and the overwhelming warmth of bodies pressed close—it was definitely not
        because of Vidal’s voice rumbling against her ear. She inhaled deeply, letting the coldness settle in her lungs,
        grounding herself as best she could.
  </p>
<p>
   Once she felt decently steady, she scanned the street for Vidal, frowning when she didn’t see her. Groups of
        people lingered nearby, smoking or waiting for Ubers, but Vidal was nowhere in sight.
  </p>
<p>
   Did she ditch me?
  </p>
<p>
   The thought set her blood boiling again. But then, movement caught her eye further down the street, a familiar
        silhouette slipping into an alley beside the bar.
  </p>
<p>
   It was unmistakably Vidal.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stiffened, her frustration flaring anew. She wasn’t one to follow people, especially not first-year
        associates who had practically dragged her to a gay bar and then had the nerve to order her to cash out. Her
        cheeks burned hotter, and her irritation grew with every passing second. This wasn’t just a game anymore; it was
        something far messier—and it was starting to piss her off.
  </p>
<p>
   She marched forward, heels clicking sharply, each step feeling like a blow against the concrete.
  </p>
<p>
   Rounding the corner quickly, she stopped short as Vidal stepped out of the shadows, blocking her path with an
        unreadable expression.
  </p>
<p>
   “ Jesus ,” Agatha hissed, pulse quickening as she took a half-step back. “Are you trying to give me a heart
        attack?”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s gaze didn’t waver, her calm composure only intensifying with the simmering tension in the air. The
        silence stretched, heavy—tangible, and finally, Vidal broke it, her voice dark and gravelly.
  </p>
<p>
   “You want to tell me what that was about?”
  </p>
<p>
   Her tone was a deliberate, low rumble that seemed to settle under Agatha’s skin, leaving a trail of goosebumps in
        its wake. And the question? It wasn’t just a demand—it was a challenge, one that had Agatha’s temper sparking to
        life.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Who did Vidal think she was to question her?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha crossed her arms, meeting Vidal’s unyielding stare with a raised chin.
  </p>
<p>
   “What was what?” She asked feigning ignorance as she kept her voice steady, steel masking the heat curling
        beneath her ribs, twisting her insides into something taut and unfamiliar.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s gaze narrowed.
  </p>
<p>
   “Don’t play dumb. It doesn’t suit a woman of your intelligence or skill.”
  </p>
<p>
   The barb nestled itself perfectly within the compliment, and Agatha clenched her jaw, refusing to let it unsettle
        her.
  </p>
<p>
   “I saw you having fun, so I thought I’d do the same. What’s wrong with a little fun?”
  </p>
<p>
   Her words were sharp, each syllable landing like a perfectly calculated move in a game she was still figuring
        out.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Fun
   </em>
   ?” Vidal repeated, the corner of her mouth curving into a frown. “I was working. What you were
        doing... that didn’t look like work.”
  </p>
<p>
   She took a step closer, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   “I thought you were straight?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha fought against the urge to step back as Vidal closed the distance. She gritted her teeth at even the urge
        of retreat.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What was happening to her?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “I am straight,” she shot back, the retort too quick, too defensive, betraying the turmoil beneath her icy
        exterior.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s smirk deepened, her expression bordering on predatory.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “You sure about that?”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse jumped, the steady beat accelerating as something flared within her—a mix of anger, defiance, and
        an unsettling desire, that had her fingers twitching at her side.
  </p>
<p>
   “Don’t,” she hissed, the word slipping out before she could leash it. She tried to hold onto her composure, but
        her gaze drifted, caught on Vidal’s infuriatingly calm expression, her steady proximity. “I was bored. So, I
        played.
   <em>
    End of story
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal cocked an eyebrow, watching her with a maddening hint of amusement that set Agatha’s teeth on edge.
  </p>
<p>
   “If that’s what you want to call it.”
  </p>
<p>
   “We are not calling it anything,” Agatha snapped, her voice tight, cheeks flushed as the game slipped further
        from her control with each exchange. “It was exactly what it was.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal held her gaze, her head tilting in that maddeningly calm way, eyes scanning Agatha as if she could see past
        every guarded layer, straight to the parts of her that Agatha kept buried deep, out of reach. Agatha’s pulse
        spiked, an urge rising to step forward, to straighten Vidal’s head herself, to demand that she stop looking at
        her like that—like she saw straight through her.
  </p>
<p>
   For a charged moment, Vidal’s gaze lingered, and then, in a subtle motion that left Agatha both frustrated and
        relieved, she took a small step back.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s tone was disarmingly smooth, as if she was completely immune to the tension winding around them, binding
        tighter.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t like that. It felt too easy, like Vidal was just giving her a pass.
  </p>
<p>
   “Don’t say it like that.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s gaze didn’t waver, her voice maddeningly calm and controlled, like she was merely humoring Agatha’s
        irritation.
  </p>
<p>
   “Like what?”
  </p>
<p>
   “Like you don’t believe me,” Agatha’s voice was sharp, her stare intense as she tried to read something—
   <em>
    anything
   </em>
   —on Vidal’s infuriatingly neutral face.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal shrugged, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s, and her lips curled into the slightest smirk —a subtle movement
        that somehow sent a wave of uncomfortable heat through Agatha’s body.
  </p>
<p>
   “Doesn’t matter what I believe. If you say you’re straight, then you’re straight.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s mouth tightened as her pulse surged, fingers curling at her sides, desperate for something to anchor
        herself—something to shatter the strange, heated tension winding between them. She felt as though Vidal had
        taken control of the very air around her, wrapping her in a web of unspoken challenges and easy confidence that
        left her unsettled.
  </p>
<p>
   She couldn’t let Vidal have this kind of power over her.
  </p>
<p>
   No, she needed to level the playing field.
  </p>
<p>
   Instincts took over, as she she took a step towards Vidal, and leaned in.
  </p>
<p>
   “Did it bother you when I flirted with that bartender?” Agatha’s voice was a sharpened blade, aimed to unsettle
        Vidal, to throw her off as much as she’d been.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She wasn’t blind
   </em>
   —Vidal hadn’t liked her flirting with Max, even if it had been just a game.
  </p>
<p>
   But Vidal didn’t even blink at the question. Instead, something dark and thrilling sparked in her eyes as she
        held Agatha’s gaze, her lips curving into the slightest of smiles.
  </p>
<p>
   "So, you admit you were flirting with a woman?" Vidal’s voice was calm, but her words held a weight that made
        Agatha’s pulse quicken.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha scoffed, masking the flicker of vulnerability with a dismissive shrug.
  </p>
<p>
   “For fun,” she corrected, her voice laced with defiance.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal chuckled quietly, a low, easy sound that made something twist deep in Agatha’s chest. But then she went
        silent, her gaze locked onto Agatha’s as she stepped forward, closer than before. The air between them
        thickened, charged with an energy that was impossible to ignore.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” Vidal said, her voice a murmur that seemed to echo in the tight space between them.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, taken off guard as the full meaning of that single word sank in. Her brain scrambled to catch up,
        and when it did, she felt the steady rhythm of her control start to crack. She swallowed, feeling exposed under
        Vidal’s unflinching gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   “Wait... are you saying—?”
  </p>
<p>
   “That I didn’t like seeing you flirt with someone else? Yes.
   <em>
    I did not like it.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s tone was firm, like she was stating a simple fact, yet there was an intensity behind her words that
        turned the air between them into something almost electric.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips parted, her breath hitching as she searched Vidal’s face, hunting for any sign of hesitation.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why?” she finally asked, her voice barely more than a whisper.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s gaze softened, her tone gentle, coaxing.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why do you think?”
  </p>
<p>
   Silence stretched between them, thick and charged, the unspoken tension simmering to the surface, leaving Agatha
        exposed with nowhere to hide. It pressed on her, both thrilling and unnerving, daring her to acknowledge it.
  </p>
<p>
   She took a breath, her voice barely a whisper as she finally spoke, making the thing between them real, forcing
        Vidal to own it.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re attracted to me.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words hung in the air, weighty, undeniable, a challenge as much as a confession. Agatha’s gaze held steady,
        her pulse quickening as she watched Vidal’s reaction, waiting for her to either retreat.
  </p>
<p>
   But Vidal didn’t retreat. She simply met Agatha’s gaze, eyes dark and unwavering.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha drew in a deep breath, struggling to regain her footing.
  </p>
<p>
   “Just like that?” she asked, her voice tinged with disbelief. She’d never met anyone like Rio Vidal
        before—someone who could answer something so intimate with such calm certainty, without hesitation or shame.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Who in the world was this woman?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   How did she have the nerve to be so direct?
  </p>
<p>
   There was a flicker of something in Vidal’s gaze, an intensity that sent another shiver down Agatha’s spine.
  </p>
<p>
   “Just like that,” Vidal repeated, her voice unwavering, her eyes locked onto Agatha’s with a confidence that
        bordered on audacious. The openness in her gaze was almost unsettling, like she didn’t just want Agatha’s
        attention but demanded it, meeting her defenses head-on without blinking.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart thudded painfully as she tried to process what was unfolding. Vidal was unlike anyone she’d ever
        met—an impossible mix of audacity and restraint, honesty and mystery.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And the worst part?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t sure she wanted to stop her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Don’t worry.” Vidal’s tone was maddeningly calm, placating even as she broke the silence. “I can keep my
        personal and professional lives separate.”
  </p>
<p>
   Now that, had a disbelieving laugh escaped Agatha, sharp and defensive.
  </p>
<p>
   “Are you kidding me?” she hissed, a surge of frustration slipping through the cracks in her control. “You’ve been
        pushing me for days—
   <em>
    on purpose
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s brow lifted, her gaze sharpening in that infuriatingly self-assured way.
  </p>
<p>
   “Noticed that, did you?” Her voice softened, as if she’d hit a nerve. “Interesting.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s teeth clenched, every word from Vidal stoking her anger, igniting something more volatile beneath the
        surface.
  </p>
<p>
   “And what, exactly, do you find so interesting?” she shot back, her voice colder than the air outside.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal didn’t flinch. Instead, her gaze held steady, a flicker of amusement in her eyes that only pushed Agatha
        further.
  </p>
<p>
   “That you noticed,” she replied, voice smooth, dangerously controlled. “And didn’t tell me to stop.”
  </p>
<p>
   A flare of indignation surged through Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yeah, well—I’m telling you to stop now,” she snapped, the words out before she could rein them in.
  </p>
<p>
   A tense silence settled between them, the air thickening as Vidal simply held her gaze, before nodding.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay,” Vidal replied, her voice maddeningly calm, each syllable like a weight pressing on the already charged
        silence between them. The single word hung in the air, taunting Agatha, daring her to respond, to push back, to
        confront it.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s chest tightened, her frustration mounting at the ease with which Vidal had agreed.
  </p>
<p>
   She wanted more—a reaction, a challenge, something to justify the roiling tension that churned inside her. She
        felt her pulse spike, a fierce thrum beneath her skin that defied her usual control.
  </p>
<p>
   “That’s it?” she demanded,
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s gaze didn’t waver, but her lips twitched into a knowing, almost dangerous smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “You sound...
   <em>
    disappointed
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   A quick, defensive laugh slipped from Agatha’s lips, her bravado slipping as she searched for words that eluded
        her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Me? No. It’s just...” But the sentence trailed off, as if the rest of it was lost somewhere she couldn’t quite
        voice without saying too much, without exposing herself.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal took a single step forward, closing the space between them their bodies nearly touching now. Her gaze
        steady and piercing, their bodies may not have been touching, but every inch of her presence focused on Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “What do you want, Agatha?”
  </p>
<p>
   The question cut through the air, landing like a challenge wrapped in silk. It drew Agatha forward and pushed her
        back all at once, her heart pounding, her breath shallow.
  </p>
<p>
   “What?” Her voice wavered, more vulnerable than she’d intended.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    What do you want?”
   </em>
   Vidal’s repeated, her eyes stayed sharp, not giving Agatha a moment’s respite. “Do
        you want me to stop?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s throat tightened as Vidal’s words wrapped around her, pulling her in, tempting her to reach out and grip
        something she didn’t fully understand.
  </p>
<p>
   “Or—” Vidal continued, her voice low and deliberate, “—do you want me to continue?”
  </p>
<p>
   The word settled over Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “Continue?” she echoed, momentarily off-balance.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s eyes flashed.
  </p>
<p>
   “Flirting with you,” Vidal murmured, her voice a low, teasing drawl. Her gaze held a challenge that twisted the
        air between them. “
   <em>
    Pushing you
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha straightened at that—not liking that one bit, as she lifted her chin defiantly.
  </p>
<p>
   “I don’t like to be pushed.”
  </p>
<p>
   A glimmer of amusement danced in Vidal’s eyes as she took Agatha in, her gaze slow and deliberate.
  </p>
<p>
   “I think you do.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart stuttered, her voice coming out sharper than intended, like armor hastily thrown up.
  </p>
<p>
   “You don’t know me.”
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” Vidal replied, her voice soft, unbothered, like she’d expected the response. “Not everything. But I can
        read people.” She paused, her eyes lingering on Agatha’s, unrelenting. “And you—you may hate being pushed, but
        some part of you
   <em>
    craves it.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha hated the shiver that went down her spine at that, and the way her legs weakened just a little.
  </p>
<p>
   “What are you even talking about?”
  </p>
<p>
   The words slipped from Agatha’s mouth, sharper than she’d intended, an instinctive defense against the tightening
        feeling in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m talking about what I see, Agatha.” Vidal’s tone softened, and a hint of something deeper shimmered in her
        gaze. “You wear control like armor. Always the strong one. Always in charge. But...” She leaned in, her voice
        dropping, each word slipping past Agatha’s defenses, “there’s a part of you that’s tired. And maybe... a part
        that wants to let go, just for once, to let someone else take over, even just for a moment.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched, the words striking a chord she hadn’t even realized existed. Her pulse pounded, the heat
        of Vidal’s proximity making her feel exposed. She fought to keep her voice steady, but it came out ragged, raw.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let go... to you?”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s answer was immediate, quiet, and unwavering, her gaze locked onto Agatha’s like she’d just laid down a
        challenge.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes.”
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” Agatha shot back immediately, but the conviction she tried to muster slipped, her voice failing to sound as
        resolute as she wanted.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal stared at her again, and then gave the slightest nod, almost indulgent.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay.”
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Agatha was really starting to hate that word
   </em>
   and her frustration spiked, mixing with something else she
        didn’t want to name.
  </p>
<p>
   “Stop saying that!” she snapped, feeling the control she so carefully held begin to fray.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal didn’t miss a beat.
  </p>
<p>
   “Stop giving you what you want?” Vidal’s voice was soft, mocking, a dark gleam in her eyes. “I thought that’s
        exactly what you wanted.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha opened her mouth, ready to snap back, but her words tangled, her pulse racing under the weight of Vidal’s
        gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re twisting my words,” she finally managed, though the words lacked their usual sharp edge.
  </p>
<p>
   “Am I?” Vidal’s eyebrow arched in a quiet challenge. Her voice lowered, rich and unwavering. “Agatha, I know you
        like it with I flirt with you, and that's okay. It doesn't have to mean anything If you’re worried about me
        kissing you—or anything else—you don't have to worry.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sucked in a sharp breath. Kissing Vidal hadn’t been in her thoughts, not consciously. And yet, now, the
        idea burned through her mind, impossible to ignore.
  </p>
<p>
   “—I won’t kiss you,” Vidal continued, her smirk widening, eyes gleaming. “Not until you ask me to.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words hit her like a blow, winding her, her pulse racing in a way that felt foreign and maddening. Her next
        words slipped out, more breathless than defiant.
  </p>
<p>
   “You can’t be serious.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s look was steady, telling her everything.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stared, something hot and restless swirling inside her. She gritted her teeth, barely holding onto her
        slipping control.
  </p>
<p>
   “I swear, I’ve never met someone I want to strangle more.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s eyes glinted with a dangerous amusement, and she leaned in just close enough to make Agatha’s breath
        hitch.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “If you ask... I’ll let you.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha recoiled, a sharp gasp slipping out as she stumbled back a step, as if trying to escape the vivid image
        that had just seared through her mind.
   <em>
    Jesus Christ.
   </em>
   The words left her in a ragged whisper, barely
        controlled, her fingers tingling with the phantom sensation of Vidal’s neck beneath them, her hand curled
        possessively, commandingly around that smirking face.
  </p>
<p>
   She blinked hard, pushing the image away, but her pulse thundered, her mind refusing to let it go. Vidal hadn’t
        moved, her eyes dark and dangerous, watching Agatha with a satisfaction that was almost predatory. That faint,
        infuriating smirk played on her lips as though she knew exactly what Agatha had just imagined—and exactly how
        much it had shaken her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha forced herself to stand taller, to shake off the fire curling low in her stomach.
  </p>
<p>
   “I—” Her voice faltered, betraying her usual composure, and she felt the heat rise to her cheeks. She shot Vidal
        a glare, her mouth pressed into a tight line, hoping it would somehow mask the turmoil twisting within her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Careful, Vidal,” she managed, her voice barely more than a whisper, roughened with an intensity she didn’t want
        to acknowledge. “You don’t know what you’re asking for.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal didn’t hesitate.
  </p>
<p>
   “I know exactly what I want, Agatha.
   <em>
    Can you say the same for you?
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw clenched as Vidal’s words hit her, taunting her in ways she wasn’t prepared to face. Every instinct
        urged her to brush it off, to laugh in Vidal’s face and walk away without a second thought. But Vidal’s smirk
        lingered, pushing past her defenses.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Did
   </em>
   she know what she wanted?
  </p>
<p>
   For so long, it had been so clear—success, power, control. But here she was, battling an unfamiliar ache for
        something she
   <em>
    never
   </em>
   thought she wanted.
  </p>
<p>
   Her thoughts shattered as Vidal stepped back, her voice cutting through the charged silence.
  </p>
<p>
   “It’s getting late. I think I’ll be heading home.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, thrown.
  </p>
<p>
   “You can’t be serious?”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal cocked her head.
  </p>
<p>
   “Would you like to talk more?”
  </p>
<p>
   The challenge was clear in Vidal’s eyes, and Agatha gritted her teeth, hating how it forced her closer to a line
        she wasn’t ready to cross.
  </p>
<p>
   “No.”
  </p>
<p>
   A spark flickered in Vidal’s gaze, her expression unreadable. She took another step back, her voice dropping to
        that dangerous murmur.
  </p>
<p>
   “Do you want me to kiss you?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched. She bit down against the pulse of heat that surged through her, her voice strained.
  </p>
<p>
   “No.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s smirk returned, slow and infuriating, as if she knew Agatha’s resistance was hanging by a thread.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay then—in that case, I’m going to go home,” she said, leveling Agatha with a look that stole the breath right
        from her lungs. “Remember–you just have to ask, Agatha.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha glared, the denial on her tongue fierce and defensive.
  </p>
<p>
   “I won’t ask.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s grin spread knowingly, and Agatha felt the words forming in Vidal’s mouth before she could even speak.
  </p>
<p>
   “Don’t you dare say ‘okay,’” she hissed.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal only smiled, her eyes flashing with amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   “Goodnight, Agatha.”
  </p>
<p>
   And with that, she turned and walked away, leaving Agatha standing there. She watched Vidal’s silhouette fade,
        her heart racing in a way that defied every carefully constructed wall she’d built around herself. Desperate to
        regain her footing, she seized the one thing that always grounded her—
   <em>
    business
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   “Wait—what did you get out of Baker?” she called.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal stopped, glancing back over her shoulder, and a playful, almost sheepish smile tugged at her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh... nothing yet. She clammed up about work.” She paused, a glint of mischief sparking in her gaze. “So I have
        a coffee date with her tomorrow. I’m going to press harder then.”
  </p>
<p>
   “A
   <em>
    date
   </em>
   ?” Agatha’s voice sharpened, the word twisting uncomfortably in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s grin widened, as if sensing her frustration, and this time, she threw her a wink—a real, genuine smile
        that sent a strange thrill through Agatha, leaving her breathless.
  </p>
<p>
   “See you in the morning, Agatha.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stood in the alley, her heartbeat still racing, every instinct screaming at her to chase after Vidal, to
        demand answers, to regain the control Vidal had so effortlessly taken from her.
  </p>
<p>
   The alley fell silent, the distant hum of the city fading into the background, leaving her alone with the quiet
        realization that everything she thought she understood about herself had shifted —and for the first time in a
        very long time, Agatha Harkness felt out of control.
  </p>
<h1>
   I Stray Not From the Path
  </h1>
<p>
   When Agatha finally crawled into bed, exhaustion tugging at her, sleep wouldn’t come. Every time she closed her
        eyes, Vidal’s voice echoed, looping through her mind with maddening clarity.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “What do you want, Agatha?”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The question rippled through her, reverberating deeper with each replay.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    "Maybe... a part that wants to let go, just for once, to let someone else take over..."
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The words haunted her, slipping beneath her defenses, teasing out questions she wasn’t ready to answer, taunting
        her in the quiet dark.
  </p>
<p>
   The idea of letting someone else take control—it was foreign.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Unthinkable.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha was always in command with sexual partners, always the one setting the pace, dictating every step from the
        first touch to the last breathless moment.
  </p>
<p>
   It suited her.
  </p>
<p>
   It kept her comfortable.
  </p>
<p>
   And the men she’d been with expected it,
   <em>
    welcomed it
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   She was known for her professional dominance, and the men she was with weren't really surprised when then that
        same dominance carried into the bedroom.
  </p>
<p>
   It was who she was.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Or... was it?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The question snuck up on her, seizing her in a moment of raw, startling clarity.
  </p>
<p>
   Was it the control she craved, or what it the easiness that came with keeping her control?
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha shifted uncomfortably, feeling the weight of it settle, heavy and intrusive, as her mind raced in ways she
        couldn’t quiet. The answer loomed before her, unsettling, as she replayed each moment she’d taken the reins,
        every move she’d calculated to secure her power. But here, in the stark quiet of her bedroom, the control she’d
        held so fiercely didn’t feel like true strength.
  </p>
<p>
   It was like armor—layer upon layer that shielded and insulated her, something she’d never questioned. But, as if
        it were real armor, it suddenly felt—
   <em>
    weighted
   </em>
   . And now, for the first time in her life, she could feel
        the pressure of it, the toll it took.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Could she let it go?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The question stirred something in her chest, unsettling and foreign. She didn’t like the thought at all—it wasn’t
        who she was. But her mind turned it over, breaking it down like a case, examining it from every angle.
  </p>
<p>
   And then a factor surfaced she hadn’t considered before—
   <em>
    gender
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Could she surrender to a man?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The thought twisted something deep inside her, but not with any thrill. Instead, it pulled at her with a
        discomfort that bordered on disgust. The idea of letting a man take charge, to dominate her, felt about as
        enticing as rubbing one out with sandpaper. She could almost laugh at the absurdity of it—there was no appeal,
        no thrill, only the stark repulsion that reminded her exactly why she kept men at arm’s length in every sense of
        the word.
  </p>
<p>
   But a woman...
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Now, that stirred something different.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Unexpected.
  </p>
<p>
   Exciting.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Safe.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The thought, foreign and strangely electrifying, sent a shiver racing down her spine, igniting something deep
        within her. She couldn’t ignore the way her pulse quickened at the image: a woman, self-assured and confident,
        taking her by surprise, challenging her in ways that went beyond words. The allure was undeniable, clashing with
        everything she thought she knew about herself, but it was there, daring her to explore the idea further.
  </p>
<p>
   The more she dwelled on it, the more vivid the image became.
  </p>
<p>
   Dark hair, dark eyes, that infuriatingly confident smirk... the rasp of a voice that teased, pushed, drew her in.
  </p>
<p>
   The woman in her mind had taken on a form she couldn’t deny—
   <em>
    Rio Vidal
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha clenched, a gasp catching in her throat.
  </p>
<p>
   She suddenly became painfully aware of the heat building inside her, of how her body reacted to the thought of
        Vidal’s control, her touch, her words coaxing her past every boundary she’d carefully constructed.
  </p>
<p>
   The mere idea of Vidal leading her to release, guiding her in ways she’d never allowed... it had Agatha biting
        her lip, a moan slipping free as her hips moved instinctively. Without thinking, her hand drifted downward, and
        the instant she touched herself, her breath hitched —she was already drenched, the lightest touch sending a wave
        of pleasure coursing through her.
  </p>
<p>
   A low groan escaped her as her fingers circled slowly, building herself up with deliberate pressure. Her mind
        filled with vivid flashes of Vidal—her hands curling into Agatha's shoulder, that scent of forest around her,
        the brush of her lips low against her ear. Each image tightened the coil inside her, and she could almost feel
        Vidal’s presence, her voice a dark whisper in her ear, coaxing, daring, no doubt murmuring filthy words of
        encouragements.
  </p>
<p>
   The release crashed over her like a tidal wave, her body arching, shuddering, as every nerve lit up with a raw,
        electrifying intensity. Her fingers moved in tight, rhythmic circles as she rode the high, soft gasps filling
        the quiet of her room. As the sensation ebbed, her chest heaved with ragged breaths, and she sank back into the
        bed, basking in the lingering tremors that left her tingling, weightless.
  </p>
<p>
   Her wet hand fell to her side, body still pulsing from the aftershocks, and she pressed her other to her
        forehead, letting out a shaky exhale. She could hardly remember the last time she’d come this hard—
   <em>
    if
            ever
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   She’d always known her body, knew the paths to release, yet it still took her time to reach her peak.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    But tonight?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Tonight was something else entirely. And she had to face the truth of why.
  </p>
<p>
   She was lying here, breathless, legs still weak, utterly undone... all from the thought of Rio
   <em>
    fucking
   </em>
   Vidal.
  </p>
<p>
   Just the fantasy of her—dark eyes, that infuriating smirk, the quiet control in her voice—had sent Agatha
        spiraling into an intensity she hadn’t even thought herself capable of. The thrill of it left her heart
        pounding, the dark edges of temptation sinking deep into her chest, making it hard to breathe.
  </p>
<p>
   And as she laid there staring up at the ceiling, the weight of it all crashing down on her, pressing heavily
        against the silence. Her body still hummed from the aftershocks, but her mind began to settle, clarity creeping
        in with an unsettling force.
  </p>
<p>
   “What the hell am I doing?” she whispered, her voice barely more than a breath.
  </p>
<p>
   There was no denying it now.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio Vidal was a problem.
  </p>
<p>
   A big
   <em>
    fucking
   </em>
   problem.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s steps echoed through the quiet hall, the morning air still heavy with the remnants of her restless
        night. She hadn’t truly slept—Vidal’s words had haunted her like a persistent shadow, trailing her into every
        crevice of her mind. Every time she tried to find peace, tried to silence her thoughts, she’d found herself back
        there, in that dark alley, replaying Vidal’s voice, those teasing eyes, that maddening, unyielding confidence.
  </p>
<p>
   And when she’d finally drifted off, of course Vidal had invaded her dreams too, each encounter twisting the knife
        deeper, fueling the inferno she couldn’t seem to escape. Now, walking into the office, the very place where
        Vidal would be, her nerves were raw, frayed beyond recognition.
  </p>
<p>
   She braced herself as she stepped through the main doors, the familiar scent of the flowers in the lobby and
        coffee doing nothing to steady her. Her fingers twitched, her pulse quickened as memories from the previous
        night clawed their way back to the surface—the thoughts she’d surrendered to alone in the dark, letting herself
        unravel to the idea of Vidal’s hands— Vidal’s voice—
   <strong>
<em>
     Vidal
    </em>
</strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   It had her unmoored, rattled in a way she’d never been before. How the hell was she supposed to look her in the
        eye today?
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal read her like an open book, picking up every detail, every tremor beneath her facade.
  </p>
<p>
   Would she notice?
  </p>
<p>
   Could she tell that Agatha got herself off last night thinking about her?
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha gritted her teeth, feeling her thoughts spiral and hating every second of it. She needed something,
   <em>
    anything
   </em>
   to cut through the haze of confusion clouding her mind. Just then, a third-year associate came
        around the corner, his head buried in a report, oblivious to her approach. The moment he nearly collided with
        her, her restraint snapped.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, so sorry, was I
   <em>
    in your way
   </em>
   ?” Her voice dripped with mock sweetness, a sharp smile forming as she
        watched the him fumble for words. “No, really—why would a senior partner be strolling in her own office?
        Clearly, you’ve got far more important places to be.”
  </p>
<p>
   The poor man looked up, paling as he realized his mistake. Jefferson was actually one of the good ones here. She
        actually found him decent to work with.
  </p>
<p>
   Jefferson to his credit, tried to mumble an apology, but Agatha wasn’t done.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let me guess,” she continued, crossing her arms, “you’re going to dazzle us all with your ‘astounding work
        ethic’ and ‘commitment to excellence’ while you can’t even manage the radical responsibility of watching where
        you’re walking?” Her voice lilted on every word, wrapping disdain in a faux-polite bow. “Here’s a little free
        advice: if I can't trust find your way around a hallway, how in the hell am I supposed to trust you to find your
        way around a courtroom.”
  </p>
<p>
   The associate stammered an awkward “Yes, ma’am,” backing away, but she gave him a pointed look, rolling her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   "Oh, spare me the ‘yes, ma’am,’" she bit out, her tone dripping with disdain. "Grow a spine, Jefferson. Develop
        some self-awareness, and get out of my sight.”
  </p>
<p>
   The associate's face paled, and he nodded, practically tripping over himself to escape.
  </p>
<p>
   The office descended into an even sharper silence, a tension so thick you could slice it.
  </p>
<p>
   Everyone knew the signs.
  </p>
<p>
   When Agatha cut down someone she actually respected, it was a clear warning:
   <em>
    the rest of them had better
            watch their step.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She swept through the office, her gaze icy, catching sight of the war room.
  </p>
<p>
   It was empty—no sign of Vidal.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t sure if that made her feel more relieved or irritated.
  </p>
<p>
   She wanted her here.
  </p>
<p>
   No, she didn’t.
  </p>
<p>
   But yes, she did.
  </p>
<p>
   She gritted her teeth as Billy fell into step beside her, briefing her on her day as he handed her coffee.
  </p>
<p>
   It was an endless list of meetings, calls, and negotiations, and by the third item, Agatha’s patience was on a
        knife’s edge. But she let Billy continue, keeping her face impassive as she shrugged off her coat, tossing it
        his way. He caught it with a deftness she couldn’t help but appreciate, maintaining his steady cadence through
        her schedule.
  </p>
<p>
   She had to give him credit for that, at least; Billy could take it.
  </p>
<p>
   Settling into her chair, she took a sip of coffee, a small flick of her hand sending him on his way. Her eyes
        flicked to the war room again.
  </p>
<p>
   Where was Vidal?
  </p>
<p>
   She was always punctual, if not early.
  </p>
<p>
   A spark of irritation flared. Did she think she could waltz in whenever she pleased?
  </p>
<p>
   Apparently, she’d muttered the thought aloud because Billy paused in the doorway, glancing back.
  </p>
<p>
   "She called this morning," he said, with a hint of hesitation, "said she had an early interview for the Vanguard
        case—told me you knew about it."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw clenched as she connected the dots, Vidal’s words from last night echoing in her mind:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    "I’ve got a coffee date with her tomorrow. I’m going to press harder then."
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The twist in her chest tightened, and she couldn’t shake the heat that flared each time she replayed that scene
        from last night—Vidal’s hand on Baker’s arm, the laugh, the smirk that looked too real.
  </p>
<p>
   The idea of Vidal doing it all over again, maybe even getting Baker to open up in ways Agatha couldn’t imagine...
  </p>
<p>
   She hissed under her breath, the irritation spiking.
  </p>
<p>
   “Get me last quarter’s reports.
   <em>
    All of them
   </em>
   ,” she snapped, more forcefully than she intended.
  </p>
<p>
   Billy, unfazed, nodded and slipped out of her office, giving her the space she needed to wrangle her thoughts
        back under control.
  </p>
<p>
   This had to stop.
  </p>
<p>
   She needed to focus, to work.
  </p>
<p>
   Clenching her jaw, she grabbed her phone, forcing her attention onto her first client meeting of the day.
  </p>
<p>
   Maybe they’d bring a problem big enough to drown out the thoughts of Vidal in a coffee shop with Baker, smiling
        in that infuriatingly easy way that made her feel—
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     No
    </em>
</strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   She stopped the thought in its tracks, and took a deep breath. She dialed the number and resolved to bury herself
        in work until she couldn’t remember why her hands were still shaking.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha tackled call after call, sinking into the rhythm that kept her mind occupied. One client wanted to put two
        lawsuits to bed quietly; another was wrangling with an SEC investigation over questionable stock buys. The
        requests kept coming—urgent, frantic, and complex enough to occupy her mind.
  </p>
<p>
   She relished these questions—the “How can I
   <em>
    legally
   </em>
   get away with this?” that bordered on ludicrous but
        kept her sharp.
  </p>
<p>
   She was mid-sentence, explaining patent law to a client with an overly ambitious vision, when the war room door
        opened across the hall.
  </p>
<p>
   Out of instinct, she turned, and the words stalled on her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal stood in the doorway.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    In a dress.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha’s grip tightened on the phone as her gaze swept over Vidal, taking in the elegant, form-fitting forest
        green dress that clung to her frame. It was simple but devastatingly effective, hugging her in all the right
        places and ending just above the knee, showing just enough to draw eyes and keep them there. Her dark hair was
        loose, cascading over her shoulders softening the look even more.
  </p>
<p>
   “Uh, Agatha? Are you still there?” her client’s voice crackled through the phone.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, snapping back to reality, catching herself before the pause could stretch too long.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” she managed, forcing her voice into its usual, crisp professionalism, though she felt anything but in
        control.
  </p>
<p>
   As the client rattled on, she made herself turn away, swiveling her chair to face the skyline, gripping the
        armrests with white-knuckled intensity. She couldn’t turn back around—not yet. The image of Vidal in that dress
        was seared into her mind, and the low, throbbing tension she’d spent the entire morning trying to shake was now
        back tenfold.
  </p>
<p>
   She finished the call, her responses automatic, as she pushed the phone from her ear and set it down. The city’s
        hum outside her window was meant to ground her, to refocus her, but it did nothing. The only thought that
        registered clearly was the sight of Vidal in that dress.
  </p>
<p>
   Without giving herself another second to doubt, she stood and made her way to the war room, steps purposeful, as
        if this were any other meeting, any other case. But the truth was, she wanted to see Vidal up close—wanted to
        see how the soft fabric of that dress shifted with her movements.
  </p>
<p>
   When Agatha entered, Vidal had her back turned, a hand poised against the whiteboard, her marker moving quickly
        in her barely legible writing. She finished a final note and turned, catching sight of Agatha and grinning. Her
        dark eyes sparkled with an excitement that made her look even more striking, and it took Agatha a moment to
        register that she was speaking.
  </p>
<p>
   “I was right,” Vidal said, her voice sharp, laced with barely contained excitement as she held the marker.
        “Kelcie and Brooke were involved. Brooke was closeted, and they’d been seeing each other for six months. Kelcie
        finally opened up about it over coffee today.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s voice cut through the room, but Agatha’s attention was already split between what she was saying and
   <em>
    how god damn good she looked
   </em>
   . The fabric hugged her figure in a way that felt both powerful and
        dangerously close to alluring, outlining her arms with a refined elegance, then skimming down to a subtle slit
        that flirted just within the bounds of office propriety. The dress’s dark forest green color only heightened the
        effect, sharpening every curve, every line.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal set the marker aside and took a step forward, her hands moving with an energy that matched the gleam in her
        eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “Right before Brooke died, she mentioned a cargo report that had accidentally landed on her desk,” Vidal
        continued. “The ship was called
   <em>
    The Meridian Star.
   </em>
   Brooke told Kelcie that the items on board couldn’t
        be tied to any payment or contract records. It set off alarms for her, and she was planning to confront her boss
        the next day.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s gaze grew darker, her excitement tempered by a new edge.
  </p>
<p>
   “That was the last time Kelcie saw Brooke alive.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words hung in the air, heavy with gravity, but Agatha’s mind was elsewhere. The silence stretched between
        them, thick with unspoken tension. Agatha struggled to process what Vidal was saying, her thoughts spiraling
        chaotically around the implications of the case while simultaneously being drawn back to the sight of Vidal.
  </p>
<p>
   Every part of her was on fire, igniting the filthy thoughts that had haunted her since she touched herself last
        night. It was all muddled together, and for a moment, she felt paralyzed, trapped in this strange whirlwind of
        desire and duty.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha?” Vidal’s voice cut through the silence sharply, a hint of impatience in her tone as she caught Agatha’s
        eye. “Did you hear me?”
  </p>
<p>
   The question hit like a splash of cold water, jolting Agatha back to the present.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” Agatha replied, her voice steadier than she felt, fighting to bring her attention back to the case details
        she’d almost missed.
  </p>
<p>
   But Vidal was looking at her, not just looking—seeing her, and Agatha could pinpoint the exact second Vidal’s
        excitement over the case shifted, the spark in her eyes darkening into something sharper. That smirk, knowing
        and infuriating, curved at Vidal’s lips as she stepped closer.
  </p>
<p>
   “You look...” Vidal murmured, her words timed to her slow, deliberate steps. Each syllable stretched, matching
        the rhythm of her approach, and Agatha’s breath hitched as she realized just how close Vidal was coming. With
        those nude heels, Vidal was taller than her now, leaning in as if savoring her new height advantage.
  </p>
<p>
   “...flushed,” she finished, her gaze dropping just a fraction, her tone a velvet purr laced with a hint of
        feigned concern.
  </p>
<p>
   “Are you feeling okay?” she asked, her question innocent, but her eyes far from it, a glint of knowing amusement
        flickering there.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha forced herself to stand straighter, but the lingering heat from last night simmered to the surface,
        traitorous and relentless. Vidal’s presence, so close she could practically feel the warmth radiating from her,
        made it impossible to shut out the images from her mind. Her response teetered on her tongue, a mix of denial
        and challenge, but words failed her in the face of Vidal’s unrelenting gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” she finally managed, though her voice betrayed her, carrying more breath than defiance. “I’m fine.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal’s smirk deepened, her gaze unwavering, promising with unspoken certainty that she knew exactly what she was
        doing—and exactly what it was doing to Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mmm...” Vidal murmured, the low hum sending a shiver through Agatha, as if she could see each crack her presence
        caused in Agatha’s carefully built armor. Her mouth opened, poised to say something else, no doubt another push,
        another nudge toward that dangerous edge of control Agatha felt slipping away with each word, each glance.
  </p>
<p>
   Panic clawed up her chest, raw and disorienting. The tension, the uncertainty, the fierce pull Vidal had on
        her—she needed it to stop.
  </p>
<p>
   The word escaped before she could catch it, a slip that felt both reckless and vulnerable.
  </p>
<p>
   “Stop.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words were barely out before regret seized her. She wanted to pull them back, to say something else—
   <em>
    anything els
   </em>
   e.
  </p>
<p>
   But Vidal’s eyes flickered, her expression flashing with shock for a fraction of a second, and then, with a
        single measured step back, her entire demeanor transformed. The teasing warmth, the playful smirk—all of it
        vanished, replaced by a chilling neutrality that was almost unsettling in its precision.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed hard, both irritated and strangely admiring of how effortlessly Vidal could switch it all off.
        Her face may have been blank, but her eyes—they searched Agatha with a sharp, careful intensity, reading her,
        moving over her face as if picking up the pieces of something unsaid, something Agatha didn’t quite know how to
        put into words herself.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, just as quickly, something shifted in Vidal’s gaze—a hint of understanding.
  </p>
<p>
   She gave a brief nod, acknowledging the unspoken.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha clenched her jaw, frustration simmering under her skin.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d let the words slip and now there was no taking them back.
  </p>
<p>
   She cursed herself for it, for the way her heart twisted at Vidal’s sudden distance, for the flicker of regret
        she refused to acknowledge. Saying she wanted it to stop was one thing, a moment of vulnerability she could
        almost excuse—but admitting she didn’t actually want it to stop?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    That was unthinkable.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But the silence between them, Vidal’s carefully unreadable face, felt like a wall. And that was worse. Agatha’s
        pulse pounded as her mind raced, part of her wanting to reach out and tear down the wall she’d just thrown up
        between them, to make some kind of move that would prove she hadn’t lost her edge, her control.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal just watched her, waiting, that calm gaze unwavering, her expression blank, the complete opposite of
        Agatha’s own tangled thoughts. Somehow, that was the hardest part— how easily Vidal respected Agatha's request
        without hesitation.
  </p>
<p>
   Finding her voice, though the words tasted sour as she forced them out, Agatha managed to say, “Comb through
        everything and find all references to
   <em>
    The Meridian Star
   </em>
   . Find me something.”
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal nodded, the acknowledgment almost too simple, too composed.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded back, feeling the weight of it settle uncomfortably between them. She turned, intent on leaving,
        desperate to escape the tension in the room. The silence thickened, stretching taut as she reached for the door
        and yanked it open, ready to step away from whatever held her back, but something stopped her.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked back.
  </p>
<p>
   Vidal was already bent over a box of documents, already working, her focus sharp and steady, displaying no
        adverse reaction to Agatha ending the game between them.
  </p>
<p>
   It was like she completely let it go.
  </p>
<p>
   But Agatha couldn’t let it go.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Something
   </em>
   in her needed to say one last thing.
  </p>
<p>
   “Rio,” she said, the name slipping from her lips with surprising weight, her voice soft but loaded. It was the
        first time she’d used her first name, and she could see the impact of it immediately.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s head snapped up, her eyes meeting Agatha’s, a flash of something unmistakable—want, desire—before it dulled
        into composure.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good work on this,” she murmured, her words feeling like a bridge stretched across the tension. It wasn’t much—a
        compliment from her mouth was rare—but it felt insufficient against everything that hung unsaid in the room.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio nodded, her voice quiet but warm.
  </p>
<p>
   “Thank you.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha held her gaze for a second longer, feeling the pull of it before she tore herself away, needing the
        distance more than ever. With a final, silent nod, she turned and walked out, her steps echoing down the
        hallway, leaving that charged silence—
   <em>
    and Rio
   </em>
   —behind her.
  </p>
<h1>
   Circle Sewn With Fate
  </h1>
<p>
   Agatha stared at the ceiling of her bedroom, her hands folded on her stomach, feeling the weight of her own
        thoughts pressing down on her. The morning sun filtered in through her bedrooms large glass windows, painting
        the ceiling in its light.
  </p>
<p>
   The silence of the morning felt heavier than usual.
  </p>
<p>
   She let out a sigh, frustrated and unwilling to admit how much her current state grated at her.
  </p>
<p>
   It had been four days since she’d told Rio to stop.
  </p>
<p>
   Four days since she drew the line in the sand between them and said,
   <em>
    “don’t cross it.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   And, in true form, Rio had done just that—no smirks, no lingering touches, no flirtatious banter.
  </p>
<p>
   It was all professional now.
  </p>
<p>
   Impeccably,
   <em>
    maddeningly professional
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   And it was torture.
  </p>
<p>
   The tension that had once buzzed between them had disappeared, replaced by a stark void that left her feeling
        unbalanced. Their once-charged exchanges now felt lifeless, as if she was speaking into a mirror instead of the
        spark that had lit her up in ways she’d refused to acknowledge.
  </p>
<p>
   Her chest tightened as she thought of the moments when a fleeting smirk or a word laced with hidden meaning
        would’ve changed her for the entire day.
  </p>
<p>
   But now?
  </p>
<p>
   There was nothing.
  </p>
<p>
   It was like staring at a starry sky covered in thick, impenetrable clouds. The spark was still there, but it was
        hidden beyond Agatha's reach now.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha clenched her hands into fists, resisting the urge to curse herself for every confused thought she’d
        wrestled with since Tuesday. She’d made her choice, demanded her boundaries. And yet, she couldn’t shake the
        dull ache that had settled within her, each day feeling a little greyer, each interaction a little emptier.
  </p>
<p>
   Not even the progress Rio had made on the Vanguard case—
   <em>
    work that was undeniably impressive
   </em>
   —held any
        real satisfaction for her.
  </p>
<p>
   She could hardly focus on the details anymore, too wrapped up in what had been lost between them.
  </p>
<p>
   It didn’t help that each night, as she undressed, brushed her teeth, and prepared to sleep, the tension in her
        body would unfurl in waves, stirring up memories of Rio’s dark, intense gaze, the graze of her hands, the low,
        gravelly timbre of her voice teasing at the edge of Agatha’s self-control.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d clenched her jaw, already knowing where her thoughts would drift, the same way they had every night since
        the professional distance had settled between them.
  </p>
<p>
   And no matter how hard she tried to ignore it, her resolve would eventually falter.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mind would helplessly replay the sound of what had once been Rio’s voice, that low, teasing murmur; the flash
        of her smirk; the feel of her hands, imagined but vivid, lingering like a phantom touch.
  </p>
<p>
   Each time, breathless and aching, Agatha would surrender, slipping her hand beneath the band of her silk pants,
        chasing a release that always came too quickly, leaving her spent and satisfied, yet, still haunted.
  </p>
<p>
   Because now, even in the quiet aftermath, Rio never left her mind.
  </p>
<p>
   Somehow, the woman had burrowed beneath her skin, her presence lingering long after the warmth of release faded,
        like an echo she couldn’t silence.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio was rooted in her, deep and undeniable, as if each whisper of her memory declared,
   <em>
    "I live here
            now."
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha wanted to scream.
  </p>
<p>
   She was forty-eight, for Christ’s sake.
  </p>
<p>
   She was far too old for a... sexual awakening?
  </p>
<p>
   An identity crisis?
  </p>
<p>
   A kink revelation?
  </p>
<p>
   O
   <em>
    r whatever the hell this actually was
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   And yet here she was: Nearly fifty, more confused than she’d ever been in her life, so insatiably frustrated, and
        so ridiculously,
   <em>
    impossibly turned on
   </em>
   , she quite literally could not think straight.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio Vidal, a woman
   <em>
    16 years younger than her
   </em>
   , had stepped into Agatha's carefully constructed
        Jenga-tower of life, circling it like a hawk. With each pass, she probed at Agatha's core pieces, searching for
        any weakness, any tremor, before methodically slipping them away with chilling precision.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could feel each absence, a hollow ache expanding within her, revealing emptiness she hadn’t known existed
        until Rio showed her.
  </p>
<p>
   But Rio didn’t just take—
   <em>
    she was also rebuilding
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Layering unfamiliar, thrilling pieces onto Agatha’s foundation, forcing her to sway on the edge of everything she
        thought she understood. Every extracted piece, every newly added layer, left her precarious, teetering in a
        dizzying balance between fear and exhilaration.
  </p>
<p>
   And Rio—she stood there, just watching, never once looking away.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s held her gaze with an intensity that felt like a dare, inviting Agatha to give in—
   <strong>
    to
            fall
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Let me break you,
   </em>
   those dark eyes seemed to say,
   <em>
    and then I’ll put you back together in a way you
            never thought possible.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha laid there in the quiet of her bedroom, Rio’s unyielding gaze haunting her mind and let out a long,
        frustrated sigh and threw back the covers.
  </p>
<p>
   It was Saturday.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky wouldn’t be back until after school on Monday, which meant two entire days with nothing but herself—a
        version she was barely recognizing in the mirror lately. She didn’t want to spend another minute alone in this
        house, trapped with someone she hardly knew anymore, and the questions that Rio brought out in her followed her
        around like a ghost she couldn't shake.
  </p>
<p>
   So, what did she do?
  </p>
<p>
   Simple.
  </p>
<p>
   She turned to the one thing that had never let her down. The one place she could bury herself so deeply that her
        mind would eventually, finally quiet.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Work.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   In less than twenty minutes, she was dressed. Her hair pulled back in a messy bun, her makeup softer than usual—a
        look that still felt polished but relaxed. She slipped into a chunky sweater, designer leggings hugging her
        figure, heeled boots, and threw on a trench coat, the tailored fabric adding a touch of her usual sharpness,
        before heading out the door.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stepped off the elevator, the music loudly blaring between her ears. She had slid her AirPods in the
        second she left her apartment, drowning herself in a playlist that moved from Lizzo to Noah Kahan, Nicki Minaj
        to Taylor Swift, and finally, the rich notes of Queen. Each step brought her closer to a quiet morning of
        burying herself in emails and uncompleted work from Friday, a welcome respite from her relentless thoughts.
  </p>
<p>
   So far, the office was blissfully quiet.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Not a single soul.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She could practically feel the relief creeping over her as she neared her office door.
  </p>
<p>
   But then she caught movement from the corner of her eye and halted. Her gaze drifted over to the war room, and,
        as if the universe were playing some kind of twisted joke, Hozier’s
   <em>
    Take Me to Church
   </em>
   began playing in
        her ears.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio was there, head down reading a report.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nearly turned right back around, tempted to walk straight out the door, but of course, just as she
        considered retreating, Rio looked up, their eyes locking through the glass.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s brows raised, and Agatha could practically feel the current between them intensify.
  </p>
<p>
   She watched as Rio’s gaze dipped, taking in her casual outfit with a quick, appreciative look that seemed almost
        reflexive. But just as quickly, she caught herself, her expression shifting, and forced her eyes back to
        Agatha’s with a steadier, more professional focus.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt the heat of Rio’s gaze like a live current, but she steadied herself, willing her feet to move
        forward. The urge to stay, to let herself linger in that heavy, charged silence, was almost overwhelming.
  </p>
<p>
   But she’d come here to regain her control,
   <em>
    not to surrender it
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   With a deep breath, she straightened her shoulders, forced a dismissive look, and walked toward her office, each
        step feeling heavier than the last. She could sense Rio’s gaze trailing after her, but she didn’t look back.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, she strode into her office, shutting the door behind her with a calmness that belied the turmoil roiling
        inside.
  </p>
<p>
   The silence in her office was an immediate relief. She set her purse on the desk, shrugged off her coat, and took
        a long, steadying breath.
  </p>
<p>
   Sitting down at her desk, she logged into her computer, the familiar glow of the screen bringing a sense of
        purpose.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She could do this
   </em>
   —she could bury herself in work and let the hours pass, let herself escape in tasks
        that required no emotional investment.
  </p>
<p>
   In the quiet of her office, she could almost forget that Rio was only a few rooms away.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Almost.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She worked as the sun drifted across the sky and disappeared, leaving an inky darkness pressing against the glass
        walls of her office. Every email she answered, every report reviewed, every typed-out brief or signed document
        settled her frayed nerves, calming the tempest inside her piece by piece.
  </p>
<p>
   But like a temptation she couldn’t shake, her gaze kept drifting toward the war room, her eyes betraying her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rio was still there.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Tenacious, focused, working her way through the boxes that they hadn’t yet combed through. The whiteboard filled
        with notes and connecting lines, evidence of her relentless mind at work, and each time Agatha glanced up, she
        was there—opening another box, writing another note, marking down another discovery. She moved with an ease that
        felt almost hypnotic.
  </p>
<p>
   She was wearing black denim pants, a blue button-up with a crisp white T-shirt underneath, and white tennis shoes
        that looked worn but intentional. Her dark hair framed her face in loose waves, more relaxed than usual, and
        Agatha didn’t miss the aviators sitting on the table beside her.
  </p>
<p>
   The casual look shouldn’t have suited the office, but it worked on her with an effortless elegance, as if Rio
        owned the space just by being in it.
  </p>
<p>
   And as Agatha observed her—
   <em>
    more often than she wanted to admit
   </em>
   —she felt an odd kinship.
  </p>
<p>
   Here they were, two people in outfits that didn’t belong in the office, tethered to this place on day when they
        should have been anywhere else.
  </p>
<p>
   She forced her gaze back to the file folder in front of her, reminding herself with a fierce mental mantra that
        she was here for one reason:
   <strong>
    work
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   She picked up one of the final file—the last loose end on her desk, her last task to complete before calling it a
        night. She opened the folder, hoping for a dense report or a legal puzzle, something complex enough to keep her
        rooted here a bit longer.
  </p>
<p>
   But inside, there was only a simple expense report, just awaiting her signature.
  </p>
<p>
   No notes, no analysis—
   <em>
    just an empty dotted line
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   With a reluctant sigh, she signed it and set the folder aside, officially out of things to occupy her mind.
  </p>
<p>
   The silence that filled the room felt too final, too pointed, and she wasn’t ready to face the night ahead or the
        restless thoughts she knew would haunt her the second she walked through her door. She could practically feel
        the weight of the last four nights pressing on her—the lingering tension and frustration she couldn’t shake.
  </p>
<p>
   Clenching her jaw, she stood and crossed to the small liquor bar tucked into the corner of her office. Pouring
        herself a generous glass of bourbon, she took the bottle back with her to the desk, sinking into her chair and
        swiveling it to face the city skyline.
  </p>
<p>
   It was easier to stare at the glowing lights of the city than risk glancing back toward the war room.
  </p>
<p>
   The bourbon was smooth, its warmth spreading through her with each sip as she sat there, staring out into the
        night, feeling a familiar ache that even the good bourbon couldn’t quite numb.
  </p>
<p>
   A sharp knock on glass broke her thoughts.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned, her gaze landing on Rio standing by the door, a folder in hand, eyes expectant. Despite the
        turmoil churning within her, Agatha nodded, her instinct taking over.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio stepped inside, crossing the room with an ease that only amplified Agatha’s tension, before setting the
        folder on her desk. Agatha set down her bourbon, took the file, and opened it, scanning the pages with a
        practiced eye.
  </p>
<p>
   The document inside was a report Rio had been combing through, uncovering details about
   <em>
    The Meridian
            Star
   </em>
   , the cargo ship that Brooke had mentioned to her girlfriend.
  </p>
<p>
   As she read, her fingers tightened around the paper. The report detailed anomalies in the shipping manifest—items
        listed under ambiguous codes, weights that didn’t align with standard cargo, and no matching invoice or record
        to account for the items. There was also an unusual frequency of dockings along the Eastern Seaboard, the
        locations changing each time, almost like someone was intentionally making the ship’s path difficult to track.
  </p>
<p>
   Each page revealed more discrepancies, the pieces stacking up into something much bigger,
   <em>
    something
            deliberate
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha closed the folder and set it on her desk, nodding as she drummed her fingers lightly on its cover.
  </p>
<p>
   "This is good work," she murmured, her gaze fixed downward on the file, refusing to betray the storm brewing
        beneath her calm exterior.
  </p>
<p>
   They weren’t at the finish line yet, but they were closer than ever before.
  </p>
<p>
   And she knew the difference—
   <em>
    it was Rio
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   She was relentless, methodical, always pushing.
  </p>
<p>
   “There’s got to be more,” Rio said, her voice low and steady, a hint of resolve that echoed through the silence.
        “I’ll keep pulling the string.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded again, her fingers still tapping the folder, grounding herself. She didn’t look up, couldn’t meet
        those eyes that no longer looked at her with that spark.
  </p>
<p>
   The silence between them was thick, teetering between familiar and unsettling.
  </p>
<p>
   "Goodnight, Agatha."
  </p>
<p>
   It was a simple farewell, delivered without warmth or edge.
  </p>
<p>
   Flat.
  </p>
<p>
   Detached.
  </p>
<p>
   But for reasons Agatha couldn’t begin to untangle, those words burrowed deeper inside her than any smirk, taunt,
        or glance Rio had ever given her.
  </p>
<p>
   The neutrality of it twisted within her, winding tighter and tighter, until it felt like something inside her
        snapped.
  </p>
<p>
   "Wait."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s voice cut through the quiet, and she looked up and watched as her words landed.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio stopped, turning back, her expression blank, unreadable, as if she were just... waiting.
  </p>
<p>
   Waiting, watching with that calm detachment that felt like an insult.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw clenched.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She hated that look.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Hated the emptiness in it.
  </p>
<p>
   Hated the way Rio could stand there as if she hadn’t the very person who dismantled everything Agatha thought she
        knew about herself, forcing her onto this twisting, relentless journey of self-discovery with no end in sight.
  </p>
<p>
   How could she just step back now, as if she hadn’t taken a hammer to Agatha’s sense of self?
  </p>
<p>
   Just walk away?
  </p>
<p>
   That simmering anger rose, propelling her next words.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Stop looking at me like that
   </em>
   ,” she snapped, her voice laced with an intensity she could barely
        contain.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio didn’t so much as blink, her composure as steady as ever.
  </p>
<p>
   “I don’t understand,” she said, her voice maddeningly calm. “Did I do something to offend you?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s fingers tightened around the edge of her desk. Every part of her wanted to scream, to demand an answer,
        but the words lodged in her throat, caught between frustration and vulnerability.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes, actually,” Agatha snapped instead, her voice slicing through the air sharper than intended.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s brow arched, a glimmer of something in her eyes—curiosity, maybe surprise—before it quickly vanished. She
        tilted her head slightly, her tone gentler than Agatha could stand.
  </p>
<p>
   “What did I do?”
  </p>
<p>
   A hollow laugh escaped Agatha, cold and brittle, she stood up, needing to level the playing field—needing to look
        her in the eye.
  </p>
<p>
   “What haven’t you done?” she bit out, each word dripping with barely contained frustration. “
   <em>
    You’ve
            completely ruined me
   </em>
   . Do you even realize that?”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio held her gaze, the weight of her own silence enough to stoke the embers of Agatha’s anger.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s face softened, but she didn’t look away.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, she stepped closer, her gaze steady, unflinching.
  </p>
<p>
   “Ruined you?” she echoed, her voice low, a touch of sadness laced within her usual calm. “How exactly have I
        ruined you, Agatha?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s throat tightened, and her fingers curled, grasping for control she no longer had.
  </p>
<p>
   “You made me question everything I thought I knew about myself,” she whispered, almost to herself. “You’ve made
        me want things I can’t have, things I never even thought I’d want.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze remained unwavering, a quiet intensity simmering in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why can’t you have them?” she asked, her voice barely a murmur. “I told you Agatha, all you had to is ask?”
  </p>
<p>
   The simplicity of it—
   <em>
    just asking
   </em>
   —sent a surge of frustration through Agatha, mingling with a longing
        so strong it felt like a physical ache.
  </p>
<p>
   She let out a bitter, breathless laugh.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Just ask?”
   </em>
   she repeated, a tremor in her voice. “What exactly would I even ask for?”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze softened, her lips curving into a faint smile, one that held a thousand unspoken promises.
  </p>
<p>
   “That depends. What do you want, Agatha?”
  </p>
<p>
   The question hit her like a wave, crashing into the carefully built walls she’d surrounded herself with. And in
        that moment, the weight of her own vulnerability was almost too much to bear.
  </p>
<p>
   She felt a sting in her eyes—tears
   <em>
    , actual fucking tears
   </em>
   —and she swallowed hard, willing them away.
  </p>
<p>
   The silence thickened, and Rio stepped closer again, closer than they’ve been in days.
  </p>
<p>
   “Tell me what you want,” she whispered, her voice a quiet invitation, filled with a tenderness Agatha hadn’t
        expected.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse thundered in her ears as she stood there, feeling the weight of Rio’s words settle over her,
        wrapping around her like a tether both binding and freeing.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    This was it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She knew it, felt it in every nerve, every tremor of her racing heart.
  </p>
<p>
   It was that precipice—the moment before a jump, the second a skydiver teeters on the edge of the open door,
        staring down at the dizzying drop, caught between two choices: retreat back into the safety of the plane or leap
        forward into the unknown, letting gravity pull them into a freefall they couldn’t control.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mind spun, half-tempted to pull herself back, to escape the raw vulnerability of the moment.
  </p>
<p>
   But her body—the way it leaned ever so slightly closer to Rio, her breath quickening in anticipation—betrayed
        her.
  </p>
<p>
   She wanted this.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Needed it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   All she had to do was say the words.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze remained steady, unwavering, her patience a quiet, unspoken invitation that dared Agatha to step
        forward.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt a tremor roll through her as she stood there, feeling each of her defenses fall away, piece by piece,
        under the weight of that stare. Her lips parted, words struggling to surface, but they caught, hesitating on the
        edge.
  </p>
<p>
   “I want...” She started, her voice barely a whisper, her hands twitching at her sides as if searching for
        something to anchor her.
  </p>
<p>
   The words evaded her, slipping through her grasp, and she gritted her teeth in frustration, fighting against
        everything she had always known herself to be—controlled, precise, unshakable.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked away, drawing a breath to calm herself, but the admission clawed its way out before she could stop it.
  </p>
<p>
   “I want...” Her voice broke, and with it, the walls she had carefully built around herself cracked.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, with a certainty that both terrified and thrilled her, she turned back and met Rio’s gaze, feeling
        something snap inside her—a release, raw and undeniable.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “I want you.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The words hung between them, alive and irrevocable, vibrating in the silence.
  </p>
<p>
   She couldn’t take them back, and in that moment, she realized she didn’t even want to.
  </p>
<p>
   The pleased rumble that sounded in the back of Rio’s throat at her words sent a violent shiver down Agatha’s
        spine.
  </p>
<p>
   “You want me?” Rio’s voice was low and intimate, each word igniting a spark that traveled through Agatha’s entire
        body. Her gaze held an intensity that smoldered, a heat so unrelenting that Agatha had to fight the urge to
        shift under it.
  </p>
<p>
   Every nerve seemed to stand at attention as Rio studied her, her eyes dark and expectant, pushing Agatha to
        commit fully, to double down on her admission.
  </p>
<p>
   Even now, this woman was still fucking pushing.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” Agatha forced out, a mix of frustration and surrender.
  </p>
<p>
   The single word hung in the air, electric, and Rio’s lips curled into a slow, devastating smile. There was
        confidence in that smile, a knowingness that danced on the edge of cocky but felt earned, undeniable, and rooted
        in certainty. It was the look of someone who knew exactly what she wanted—and had no intention of accepting
        anything less.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio leaned forward, close enough that Agatha could feel her warmth, every word slipping from her lips like a
        caress but with a firm undertone that made Agatha’s pulse spike.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “How do you want me?”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The question twisted through her, unraveling any remaining composure.
  </p>
<p>
   Frustration flared in her chest, mixing with an undeniable desire that she wasn’t prepared to face.
  </p>
<p>
   “You can’t be serious," Agatha hissed out.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk deepened, and her eyes, sharp and unreadable, traced over Agatha’s face.
  </p>
<p>
   “When it comes to your wants and needs, Agatha... you will find that...
   <em>
    I am always serious
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Her gaze held Agatha’s, penetrating, almost searching, as if inviting her to take the leap.
  </p>
<p>
   “Words matter,” she pressed, the intensity of her voice wrapping around Agatha, drawing her in.
  </p>
<p>
   She held Agatha’s gaze, each word deliberate, leaving no room for retreat. Her eyes darkened, studying Agatha’s
        reaction, taking in every flicker of hesitation, the way her breathing quickened, how the tension tugged at her.
  </p>
<p>
   “How do you want me?” she repeated, her tone steady, waiting, demanding. “
   <em>
    Tell me.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   The room felt thick with tension, a living, breathing thing.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s throat tightened as she looked away, her chest rising and falling, her pulse erratic.
  </p>
<p>
   “Don’t make me say it,” she whispered, each word a struggle. “It’s too much. You’re pushing for too much.”
  </p>
<p>
   The silence that followed was heavy, fraught with the weight of unspoken things, with the steady thrum of
        Agatha’s heartbeat filling her ears.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked away, out into the night, needing that distance, that small retreat.
  </p>
<p>
   The city lights blurred into a haze as Agatha stared out into the dark, the vast night a comforting emptiness
        compared to the intensity she felt burning in front of her. She clung to that inky black, hoping—
   <em>
    no,
            begging
   </em>
   —for Rio to ease up, to give her even a sliver of reprieve.
  </p>
<p>
   Admitting that she wanted her had cost her every shred of pride she could muster.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Anything more would shatter her.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But then,
   <em>
    there it was
   </em>
   —the soft, ghostly graze of fingertips along her jaw, so delicate at first it was
        almost a question.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched, a raw, needy sound slipping from her lips, escaping before she could catch it.
  </p>
<p>
   The sound was so foreign to her own ears, so unlike anything she’d ever let anyone hear, that she wanted to sink
        into the ground, to take it back.
  </p>
<p>
   How could she have made that sound?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    From just a single touch.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She had never once made a sound like that in her life, not even in the depths of pleasure. And now, here she was,
        trembling beneath the feather-light touch of Rio’s fingertips on her jaw.
  </p>
<p>
   Her gaze remained locked on the skyline, refusing to meet Rio’s, terrified of what she'd find —some mixture of
        smugness or satisfaction that would only make the moment worse.
  </p>
<p>
   But Rio’s fingers pressed a bit more firmly, her touch insistent, wordlessly coaxing her to turn.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha resisted, pressing back against the pressure, her defiance sparking to life, a last-ditch attempt to
        shield herself from the vulnerability clawing at her.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Agatha
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s voice cut through the air, low, firm, carrying a tone Agatha had never heard from her before.
  </p>
<p>
   Gone was the playful teasing, the soft patience.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    No
   </em>
   —this was something different.
  </p>
<p>
   Demanding.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Exact
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   And threaded with a warning Agatha couldn’t ignore.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath stilled as she felt Rio’s fingers trail from her jaw, slipping beneath her chin and curling
        there, gripping just enough to make her pulse spike.
  </p>
<p>
   The bite of Rio’s hold was gentle but undeniable, an unspoken command that had her pulse roaring in her ears.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Look at me
   </em>
   .” Rio’s voice was quiet but heavy, the words as steady as her grip.
  </p>
<p>
   With a subtle, insistent tug, Rio guided her gaze away from the comforting blackness outside, pulling her back to
        the charged, shadowed depths of her own eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   Relief washed over Agatha as she didn’t find mockery in Rio’s gaze, instead there was nothing but a quiet thrill,
        the kind that felt as dangerous as it was alluring.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s fingers loosened their grip on her jaw, but they didn’t leave; they lingered, ghosting up the side of her
        face, mapping the lines and angles with a touch so soft it felt like fire.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut as Rio brushed a stray strand of hair that fell against her face, tucking it gently
        behind her ear, leaving a trace of warmth where her hand had been.
  </p>
<p>
   “Alright,” Rio murmured, a slight ache of disappointment weaving through her tone, as if she had hoped Agatha
        would have said something,
   <em>
    anything
   </em>
   . Her hand shifted to cup Agatha’s cheek, thumb brushing over her
        cheekbone, a simple, slow caress that somehow felt charged with unspoken promises.
  </p>
<p>
   “How about I tell you what I want,” she whispered, her voice a low, throaty hum that reverberated through the
        small space between them, heavy with intention.
  </p>
<p>
   Her eyes stayed fixed on Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   “Would you like that, Agatha?” Rio’s voice was silk and steel, so gentle it seemed to cradle her yet edged enough
        to make her breath catch.
  </p>
<p>
   Her fingers glided from Agatha’s brow to her temple, a touch steeped in tenderness, but her voice whispered of
        something far deeper, a controlled intensity that wrapped around Agatha like a slow-burning fuse.
  </p>
<p>
   “Would you like to know,” she continued, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin,
   <em>
    “what I want to do to
            you?”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha's breath caught, sharp and involuntary, as Rio’s words sank in, lingering like an electric pulse in her
        veins. Her eyes flew open, meeting Rio's steady, unwavering gaze, and
  </p>
<p>
   she felt a flush creep up her neck, warming her skin under the weight of that look. Every inch of her felt
        hyper-aware, from the soft press of Rio’s fingers.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” Agatha breathed, her voice barely more than a whisper, but charged, carrying the word like a confession
        she’d held back too long.
  </p>
<p>
   She felt her pulse racing, a drumbeat that seemed to echo in the small space between them.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio's mouth curved into a slow, almost predatory smile as her thumb lingered on Agatha's cheek, tracing light
        circles that made her skin tingle. She leaned closer, her face just a breath away, her voice a dark murmur that
        seemed to seep through every barrier Agatha had put up.
  </p>
<p>
   “I want to break down every wall you have,” Rio’s voice dropped low, the words pulling Agatha in, one by one,
        each sharper than the last. “I want to push you to the edge, make you fight me, challenge me—
   <em>
    make you feel
            every second of it.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Her lips brushed close to Agatha’s ear, breath warm and dangerously close, setting Agatha’s nerves alight. She
        fought to keep steady, but a shiver betrayed her, running down her spine like a live wire.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    I want to taste you,
   </em>
   ” Rio murmured, her voice rich, layered with a hunger that made Agatha’s skin
        flush. “To feel the softness of your lips, to know the way you shudder when my mouth meets yours.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched, her defenses crumbling under the weight of Rio’s words. She felt herself leaning in, her
        heartbeat drumming hard and unsteady against her ribs. She wanted to say something,
   <em>
    anything
   </em>
   , but the
        intensity in Rio’s gaze held her captive.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s fingers moved to her cheek, thumb tracing a slow line along her jaw, so gentle it made her ache.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ve imagined it,” she continued, her words a dark promise. “The warmth of you... how your lips would part...
        how you’d give in... how your breath would catch as I pulled you closer.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s head spun, each word pulling her deeper, her skin tingling, her whole-body tense with anticipation. She
        could feel herself tremble, her resolve slipping with every syllable.
  </p>
<p>
   “I want to know the sound you make,” Rio’s voice softened, her mouth curving in that wicked, knowing smile, “when
        there’s no space left between us. When it’s just you and me... and nothing held back.”
  </p>
<p>
   A soft, involuntary noise escaped Agatha, her pulse roaring in her ears. Her skin burned where Rio’s fingers
        touched, every inch of her on edge, desperate for more.
  </p>
<p>
   “And I want more than to just touch you,” Rio continued, her voice a low, seductive hum that wrapped around
        Agatha like a warm current. “I want to map you. Learn every spot that makes you weak, every place that makes you
        come undone. I want to draw out every gasp, every moan, every surrender.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s mouth parted, a soft gasp escaping her. The world around them felt dim and distant, her focus consumed
        entirely by Rio’s words and touch, the way they slipped under her skin, making her feel raw and unguarded.
  </p>
<p>
   “To unravel you... slowly... until you have nothing left to hide.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze never left hers, every word hitting deeper and deeper, pulling her into an intimacy that felt almost
        unbearably close.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt exposed, fragile, like Rio had found a place no one else had ever touched.
  </p>
<p>
   “That’s what I want, Agatha,” Rio said, her voice steady, relentless, each word dropping like an anchor. “I want
        to find every limit you didn’t know you had... and push you past it, until there’s nothing left but you,
   <em>
    laid bare
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s hand drifted down, fingers grazing the line of Agatha’s neck until her thumb found the frantic beat of her
        pulse, pressing into it—a quiet, unyielding claim that felt both grounding and utterly consuming.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips parted, her breath coming in shallow, uneven pulls, each heartbeat pulsing beneath Rio’s thumb,
        betraying her completely, stripping away any last pretense of control.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio leaned in, her lips brushing so close that Agatha could feel the warmth, the soft hint of a tease, just shy
        of a kiss. The closeness, the ache, made her dizzy, like every nerve was reaching out, drawn to Rio in a way
        that left her bare and exposed.
  </p>
<p>
   “Now,” Rio murmured, her voice a soft, delicious command, “
   <em>
    tell me what you want, Agatha
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched, her pulse pounding beneath Rio’s thumb as she felt every word slip through her defenses,
        like a key turning in a lock she’d tried to keep shut.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mind whirled, struggling to hold on to a shred of composure, a piece of herself that wasn’t crumbling under
        Rio’s touch, her gaze, that voice that seemed to pull her into a place where she was no longer in control.
  </p>
<p>
   She wanted to hold on, to stay steady, to keep something of herself guarded. But the weight of Rio’s thumb
        pressing over her pulse, the barely-there touch of her lips—so close,
   <em>
    so maddeningly close
   </em>
   —left her
        feeling exposed, open, raw.
  </p>
<p>
   A wave of need crashed over her, pulling her under, and her hands trembled as she fought the pull of surrender.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mouth went dry, her voice catching in her throat as the words pushed to the surface. She couldn’t look away,
        couldn’t pull herself from the dark, inviting depth of Rio’s eyes, the steady gaze that felt like an invitation
        and a command all at once.
  </p>
<p>
   Swallowing, she felt the admission spill out, soft, aching, and honest.
  </p>
<p>
   “I want to kiss you,” she whispered, barely more than a breath, her voice carrying every ounce of the need she’d
        tried to hide.
  </p>
<p>
   The words felt like a surrender and a release, leaving her feeling weightless, as though in that one, vulnerable
        confession, she’d given in entirely.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha leaned in, her resolve crumbling as the need to feel Rio’s lips against hers became overwhelming, a quiet
        ache turning sharp. Her hand moved up to rest on Rio’s arm, fingers curling into her sleeve as she closed the
        distance, breaths mingling, the warmth between them almost too much to bear.
  </p>
<p>
   Just as her lips were about to meet Rio’s, she felt the pressure of Rio’s hand tighten around her neck, a firm
        but gentle restraint that stopped her in place. Rio pulled back just enough to catch Agatha’s gaze, her eyes
        filled with that same dark, commanding intensity that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha froze, her heart racing beneath Rio’s thumb, her lips parted with the expectation lingering in the air.
  </p>
<p>
   And then Rio's voice dropped to a soft, relentless challenge.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Ask.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   A surge of frustration coursed through Agatha, hot and insistent, blending with a thrill she couldn’t deny.
  </p>
<p>
   She hated the way it stripped her bare, the way it made her feel as if she had no defenses left.
  </p>
<p>
   It was as if Rio could see right through her, unraveling her layer by layer, drawing out her desires without
        permission, pulling her wants and needs straight from the core of her with an infuriating ease.
  </p>
<p>
   The words slipped out before she could stop them, a soft, urgent confession she could no longer hold back.
  </p>
<p>
   “Can I kiss you?” she asked, her voice low, edged with desperation.
  </p>
<p>
   She was too far gone, too caught up to feel the sting of embarrassment now, though she knew it would come later,
        would haunt her when she thought of this moment—how she had caved, how she had let herself surrender without a
        fight.
  </p>
<p>
   But right now, she didn’t care.
  </p>
<p>
   She was breathless, open, every inch of her drawn toward Rio, as if nothing else in the world mattered but
        this—the thrill, the ache, the need burning between them.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio's eyes flashed, her gaze sparking with satisfaction, a wicked gleam that sent a tremor down Agatha’s spine.
  </p>
<p>
   That pleased look alone made Agatha's knees weak, and she felt Rio’s grip soften, fingers gliding along the side
        of her neck before slipping into her hair.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s fingers threaded through the strands, pressing and scraping against her scalp,
        grounding her in a sensation that was both intense and achingly tender.
  </p>
<p>
   A low groan escaped Agatha as Rio’s hand tightened, fingers curling at the root, pulling her head back just
        enough to remind her who held control.
  </p>
<p>
   The tension thrummed, a tantalizing ache that wasn’t pain, but something far more consuming—a release.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio guided her forward with a control that radiated dominance, each movement precise and deliberate, until Agatha
        felt the soft, warm press of Rio’s lips against her own, a touch that stole her breath entirely.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s instinct was to surge forward, to close the gap and lose herself in the kiss, but Rio’s fingers held her
        in place, firm and unyielding, keeping her right where she wanted her.
  </p>
<p>
   Every second felt like a slow burn, the tension building, stretching, leaving Agatha helpless to do anything but
        yield, to feel every inch of Rio’s control.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, instead of the kiss she craved, she felt Rio’s words, whispered against her lips, each one a soft,
        taunting caress.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Good girl
   </em>
   ,” Rio purred, her voice a low, reverent murmur that seemed to sink into Agatha’s very
        bones, igniting something that had been buried, waiting.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, Rio closed the distance, claiming her in a searing kiss that left no question, no hesitation, branding
        those words into Agatha’s soul in a way she knew she’d never forget.
  </p>
<h1>
   Burn and Brew
  </h1>
<p>
<em>
    “Good girl.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The words echoed in Agatha’s mind, and she hated the way her body reacted. Her brain resisted, every rational
        part of her reminding her that she was a grown woman—she wasn’t a girl, and she sure as hell wasn’t
   <em>
    good
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   But the words seared through her body like fire, as a heat sent a shiver up her spine, making her knees weak,
        making her heart pound hard against her ribs. It was as if her body was staging a rebellion against her mind,
        responding to Rio in ways she couldn’t control.
  </p>
<p>
   Before she could even analyze why it affected her so deeply, Rio’s lips were on hers. And any irritation or
        coherent thought she might have had dissolved instantly, melting into the kiss.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t completely unprepared for kissing a woman. She’d kissed them before— usually in college, often
        while halfway through a bottle of cheap vodka. Even through the haze of drunken bravado, she remembered the
        difference—the softness, the gentleness, the way women seemed to know exactly how to kiss.
  </p>
<p>
   Those moments had been fleeting but memorable, etched into her mind as something she sometimes recalled in the
        dark, the quiet. Especially lately, when she found herself alone in her room, her hand slipping under the
        waistband of her pants, as she imagined what it would be like to kiss Rio—to feel her lips, to taste her.
  </p>
<p>
   Would it be like those moments back in college?
  </p>
<p>
   Soft?
  </p>
<p>
   Gentle?
  </p>
<p>
   Apparently, no.
   <em>
    Not even close.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She shouldn’t have been surprised, really.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio did everything with a kind of ruthless precision. She worked with focus and intention, every detail under her
        command. And it turned out that when it came to kissing, she was no different.
  </p>
<p>
   The second their mouths met, Rio dismantled her, piece by piece, leaving no part of her untouched.
  </p>
<p>
   It was soft,
   <em>
    in a way
   </em>
   —deliberate and unhurried—but also hard, with a passion that nearly stole the
        breath from her lungs. Rio’s lips moved against hers with a control that was unnervingly exact, knowing exactly
        when to press deeper, exactly when to pull back just enough to make Agatha ache for more.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse hammered, her hands finding their way up to Rio’s shoulders, holding on as if she might float away
        under the intensity of it.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio wasn’t just kissing her—she was consuming her, learning her every response, as if memorizing the exact way
        Agatha shivered when her lips brushed her own. Agatha’s thoughts scattered, overtaken by sensation, and every
        nerve seemed alive, tuned into the way Rio’s mouth moved over hers, hungry yet restrained.
  </p>
<p>
   A soft moan slipped out, and Agatha hated herself for it—the sound of surrender, of need. But it was too late to
        pull it back.
  </p>
<p>
   But it seemed the effect wasn’t just hers to bear; Rio’s breath hitched, a slight stutter against Agatha’s lips,
        and the hand buried in her hair tightened, pulling her just a fraction closer.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a small thing, but it sent a thrill through Agatha, grounding her in the knowledge that she wasn’t the
        only one unraveling. Rio was affected too, and that realization was both intoxicating and strangely satisfying.
  </p>
<p>
   Then, she felt it—the soft, teasing brush of Rio’s tongue, just grazing her bottom lip, gentle yet still
        demanding.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha barely had a moment to process before she found herself opening, surrendering, parting her lips without a
        single thought of resistance. The speed with which she gave in, how easily she welcomed Rio in her mouth should
        have unnerved her.
  </p>
<p>
   But it didn’t.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, it felt right, inevitable, as though her body knew exactly what it wanted, even if her mind struggled to
        keep up.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s tongue moved against hers in a slow, calculated rhythm, each touch a deliberate exploration, tasting and
        savoring.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s body responded instinctively, leaning in, closing any remaining space between them as if she could
        somehow disappear into the heat of Rio’s mouth. The kiss deepened, becoming a hungry, consuming pull, and her
        hands clutched Rio’s shoulders, fingers digging in, desperate for something solid as the intensity washed over
        her, grounding her in the electric closeness.
  </p>
<p>
   And then Rio’s tongue slid into her mouth with a bold, almost filthy stroke, brushing over every sensitive inch.
        Agatha gasped, her mouth opening wider in surrender, and Rio took advantage, her tongue curling and trailing
        along the roof of her mouth, grazing her teeth, leaving her groaning.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s hand tightened in Agatha’s hair, a brief, possessive grip that sent a shock through her, making her press
        closer.
  </p>
<p>
   But just as suddenly as she’d taken control, Rio released her.
  </p>
<p>
   She pulled back with an unnerving precision, her hand slipping from Agatha’s hair, leaving her breathless and
        dazed.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha staggered, feeling the cold air rush into the space Rio had filled only moments ago, the sudden absence
        striking, leaving her unsteady and aching for more, as if she’d just been torn from a world she hadn’t realized
        she was lost in.
  </p>
<p>
   Her snapped her eyes, and in the hazy aftermath, it hit her just how ragged her breathing had become. Each inhale
        was shaky, unsteady, and her legs felt weak beneath her, barely holding her up. She fought for some semblance of
        control over herself, over the chaotic heartbeat thrumming in her chest, over the way her body seemed to betray
        her so eagerly, giving in at the first opportunity.
  </p>
<p>
   And of course, Rio was standing there, watching her with that dark, intense gaze that saw everything. A smirk
        tugged at the corner of her mouth, smug, knowing, and
   <em>
    so damn pleased
   </em>
   with the state she’d left Agatha
        in.
  </p>
<p>
   That expression alone was enough to stir a fresh wave of heat beneath Agatha’s skin, making her want to wipe that
        look off Rio’s face or, against her better judgment, lean into it.
  </p>
<p>
   “Enjoying yourself?” Agatha managed, the words coming out steadier than she felt, though the slight quiver in her
        voice betrayed her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk widened, her gaze never leaving Agatha’s as she murmured.
  </p>
<p>
   “More than you know.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s stomach tightened, hating how Rio’s words sank into her, unraveling her composure even as they stirred
        something deeper, something reckless. They left her feeling both weak and strangely bold, and the frustrating
        contradiction curled hotly in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   She wanted control back, to steady herself, to get back on level ground instead of letting Rio leave her undone
        like this.
  </p>
<p>
   So, she forced herself to lift her chin, her voice sharpened with a challenge as she snapped.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Then why did you stop?”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She watched Rio carefully, hoping the question would land, would somehow turn the tables.
  </p>
<p>
   But it didn’t.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio simply held her gaze, looking entirely unaffected, her smirk still firmly in place, the look in her eyes only
        deepening.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Because
   </em>
   ,” Rio said, her voice low and maddeningly calm, “your office is literally surrounded by
        glass—and I figured you wouldn’t appreciate someone seeing...
   <em>
    this
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Her gaze flicked briefly over Agatha, making her feel acutely aware of her own disheveled state, her breath still
        heavy, her skin warm.
  </p>
<p>
   The answer left Agatha flustered, and she clenched her fists, fighting the instinct to look away, to hide the
        flush creeping up her neck. Instead, she met Rio’s gaze head-on, frustration burning in her chest, both at Rio
        and at herself for being so easily caught off guard.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze sharpened, her smirk deepening as she looked at Agatha with a glint of satisfaction, leaning in just
        enough to close the space between them.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Why, Agatha
   </em>
   ,” she practically sang, voice soft but teasing, “did you not want me to stop?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw tightened, her immediate reaction a sharp glare. But the words she wanted to fire back caught in her
        throat, refusing to come out.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She hated it
   </em>
   —hated how her silence betrayed her, how she could feel her cheeks warming even as she
        tried to steel herself.
  </p>
<p>
   The fact that she didn’t answer was an answer all its own.
  </p>
<p>
   And, of course, Rio saw it.
  </p>
<p>
   She read the hesitation, the flicker of vulnerability like she was reading her favorite book, page by page,
        understanding every line with infuriating clarity.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk grew.
  </p>
<p>
   “Didn’t think so,” she murmured, her voice almost a purr, thick with satisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw clenched, the weakness Rio’s kiss had instilled in her body slowly fading, and in its place,
        something more familiar—old pieces of herself, solid and unyielding—began to slot back into place.
  </p>
<p>
   Anger.
  </p>
<p>
   Control.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    The absolute need to even the playing field.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She didn’t know exactly where she found the courage, but she did.
  </p>
<p>
   Turning her back to Rio, Agatha snatched her phone off the desk. Her fingers shook slightly as she tapped the
        screen, but she ignored it, typing the message to her driver with focused intent before hitting send and tucking
        her phone into her purse. She moved with purpose, heading to the cabinet for her jacket, slipping her arms into
        the sleeves and feeling the weight of control settle over her like armor. She logged off her computer, each
        action deliberate, a small defiance against the chaos Rio had left in her wake.
  </p>
<p>
   When she finally turned back around, her purse slung over her shoulder, she found Rio watching her with a frown,
        no longer wearing that smug smirk.
  </p>
<p>
   A twisted sense of satisfaction flared in her chest at the sight.
  </p>
<p>
   She had unsettled her, even if only a fraction.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a start.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha walked past Rio, feeling her gaze on her the entire way, like a silent pull.
  </p>
<p>
   But she stopped in the doorway, casting a glance over her shoulder, letting a small smile curve her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “Are you coming or not?” she asked, voice steady, issuing the challenge as if daring Rio to step up to it.
  </p>
<p>
   It felt right—perfectly,
   <em>
    deliciously right
   </em>
   —to be the one in control now, to feel the shift in power, to
        make the first substantial move in this game.
  </p>
<p>
   And she saw it, that brief flash of surprise in Rio’s eyes, her slight widening before she could rein it in. And
        then something else glimmered there, something almost like respect, a glint of acknowledgment as if Rio
        recognized—
   <em>
    and appreciated
   </em>
   —the game Agatha had just set into motion.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze sharpened, and a new thrill of anticipation ran through Agatha, knowing she had just turned the
        tables.
  </p>
<p>
   That smirk was back in place, and Rio stepped forward—
   <em>
    of course
   </em>
   —meeting her challenge head on, as she
        gestured out of the office.
  </p>
<p>
   “Lead the way,” she murmured, her voice carrying a thrill that matched Agatha’s heartbeat.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha was many things, but unaware of herself?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Absolutely not.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She was, as the kids today would say, a “
   <em>
    Self-Aware Queen
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   She knew her faults—more than she cared to count.
  </p>
<p>
   She knew her strengths—probably too well.
  </p>
<p>
   And she knew her weaknesses, which she could name without hesitation, simply because there weren’t many of them.
  </p>
<p>
   The biggest, the one that could be both curse and crown, was her inability to back down from a challenge. Agatha
        could make a case that it was a strength just as much as a flaw, a trait that had shaped her into the relentless
        force she was.
  </p>
<p>
   But she knew it was a weakness based solely on its knack for landing her in unbelievably tight spots.
  </p>
<p>
   The scar on her elbow was proof enough—a lasting reminder from when she was eight years old, and the neighborhood
        boys had goaded her, claiming she’d never make it over the Grand Canyon-sized ditch outside their trailer park.
  </p>
<p>
   Every kid in the neighborhood had tried and failed.
  </p>
<p>
   But not Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   She pedaled harder than her little legs could manage, threw caution to the wind, and fucking flew.
  </p>
<p>
   She cleared it—
   <em>
    of course
   </em>
   , but the landing was less than graceful. Her front tire caught on a rock,
        sending her flying over the handlebars and straight into a barbed-wire fence.
  </p>
<p>
   Twenty stitches later, she’d earned her first scar and her mother’s fury.
  </p>
<p>
   And it was on that day, at eight years old, that Agatha Harkness developed an addiction to proving people wrong,
        no matter how much it hurt, no matter what it cost her.
  </p>
<p>
   Now, sitting in the back of the town car on her way to her condo, Agatha traced the raised edge of that scar on
        her elbow through her sweater, her mind wandering back to it—to the first mark she earned and all the ones that
        she collected along the way, both visible and unseen.
  </p>
<p>
   Not all scars were physical.
  </p>
<p>
   Some cut deeper, hidden under her skin, the psychological marks left behind by every challenge she’d taken
        head-on, every time she refused to back down. They’d shaped her, sharpened her into who she was today, and as
        painful as they’d been, she wore each one with a fierce sense of pride.
  </p>
<p>
   But then her gaze drifted to the woman beside her—the newest challenge life had thrown in her path.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio Vidal sat there, so impossibly calm that Agatha wanted to kick her out the door. But instead, she kept her
        hands busy, her fingers tracing absently over the old scar on her elbow, while her pulse quickened, her thoughts
        unwillingly shifting to this new challenge beside her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rio.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She was unlike anyone Agatha had ever encountered—a challenge that left Agatha torn between charging forward and
        retreating. And somewhere deep down, she felt it—
   <em>
    knew it with a bone-deep certainty
   </em>
   —that this one
        wouldn’t just pass.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t going to make it through this one without a mark.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio Vidal was going to carve herself into Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   And the scar she was going to leave in her wake, was going to be just as deep and just as enduring as the one on
        Agatha’s elbow.
  </p>
<p>
   They had been riding in silence for fifteen minutes now. It was a Saturday night, and traffic on the Upper East
        Side was thick, relentless. From the moment Agatha had settled into the leather seats and felt Rio slip in
        beside her, she’d felt that familiar hum of tension.
  </p>
<p>
   After all, she’d thrown down this challenge herself, hadn’t she?
  </p>
<p>
   She’d goaded Rio to jump the ditch, and Rio hadn’t even blinked.
  </p>
<p>
   And now, here they were, side by side in the close, uncomfortable silence, the leather seat creaking each time
        they hit a bump. But if Agatha was on edge, Rio was anything but. She sat there as composed as ever, exuding
        calm, as if the silence were the most natural thing in the world.
  </p>
<p>
   Then out of nowhere, Rio’s voice cut through the silence.
  </p>
<p>
   “We should set some ground rules,” she said smoothly, breaking the silence and almost startling Agatha out of her
        thoughts.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned to find Rio watching her, a smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth, her gaze keen and
        unrelenting, as though she’d caught the flicker of surprise that Agatha had barely allowed to show.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    "She sets her rules upfront,"
   </em>
   the bartender’s words about Rio from the Red Light echoed in Agatha's
        mind, sharp and fitting.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha pressed her lips into a thin line, determined not to give Rio the satisfaction of a reaction.
  </p>
<p>
   “Rules?” she repeated, the word slipping out with a hint of skepticism.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk deepened, her head tilting just slightly, as though she were assessing Agatha from a new angle.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” she replied, her tone light, almost teasing. “If we’re going to do this, then setting expectations seems
        wise...that way, we both know what to expect. Keeps things clear.”
  </p>
<p>
   A flicker of irritation flashed through Agatha—of course, Rio would twist a challenge into a negotiation. Agatha
        hated rules, especially ones she hadn’t written herself. But there was something in Rio’s gaze, that steady,
        unshakeable confidence, that kept her rooted to the spot, despite the itch to push back.
  </p>
<p>
   “Unless, of course,” Rio continued, her tone laced with a quiet challenge, “you’d rather stop now, before this
        goes any further.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words hung between them, daring Agatha to respond. She could feel the implication settle around her, the
        slightest smirk tugging at Rio’s lips as if she already knew Agatha’s answer.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw tightened, that familiar flare igniting in her chest—the undeniable urge to rise to the
        challenge_.
   <em>
    _See this is why it is a weakness
   </em>
   , she thought bitterly, feeling the rise take over, already pushing
        words to her lips before she could think them through.
  </p>
<p>
   “Who said anything about stopping?” she shot back, her chin lifting defiantly, the question slipping out with all
        the conviction she couldn’t quite hide.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk only deepened as she gave a small nod, her gaze steady as she turned fully to face Agatha. For a long
        moment, she simply looked at her, studying her with an intensity that made Agatha’s skin prickle.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha couldn’t help but wonder what the first rule was going to be.
  </p>
<p>
   Something predictable, no doubt.
  </p>
<p>
   Probably the usual, “
   <em>
    Don’t fall in love with me
   </em>
   ,” she thought, suppressing the urge to roll her eyes
        at the cliché.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze held steady, lingering on Agatha, as if she were savoring the charged silence, waiting to see her
        reaction. Finally, she spoke, her voice low, carrying a weight that seemed to settle deep into Agatha’s bones.
  </p>
<p>
   “Before we get into rules,” Rio began, her tone soft yet unyielding. “I have a question.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes and flicking her hand impatiently, a gesture urging her to get on with it.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smile spread, slow and wide, her teeth flashing in an almost predatory grin that instantly set Agatha on
        edge.
  </p>
<p>
   Whatever was coming, she knew it was going to throw her completely off balance.
  </p>
<p>
   “Can you cum multiple times,” Rio asked, her voice casual, as if she were inquiring about Agatha’s favorite
        color, “or just once?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s mouth fell open, words failing her.
  </p>
<p>
   The audacity of this woman.
  </p>
<p>
   “How—what—why...” she stammered, tripping over half-formed thoughts.
  </p>
<p>
   How was she even supposed to respond to something so bold, so casually delivered?
  </p>
<p>
   Rio leaned forward, her gaze intensifying, focused in a way that made Agatha’s heart hammer against her ribs.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Agatha
   </em>
   ,” she murmured her voice like velvet, edged with command. “Tell me.”
  </p>
<p>
   She moved closer now, her fingers dragging slowly up Agatha’s leg, each inch an intentional, maddening tease. Her
        hand traced along the inside of Agatha’s thigh, moving higher until Agatha’s breath caught again, her nerves on
        fire. Just as Agatha’s head lulled back, a
  </p>
<p>
   traitorous sigh escaping her lips, Rio withdrew her hand, her breath warm against Agatha’s ear.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Can you cum multiple times, or just once?
   </em>
   ” she repeated, her tone laced with dark amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse thudded as her eyes slipped shut against the sensation, her head pressing back into the leather.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why...why do you need to know that?” she managed, her voice barely steady.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio chuckled, low and rich in her ear.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Because, Agatha—it tells me exactly how I should treat you
   </em>
   ,” Rio murmured, her voice a slow,
        tantalizing drag that seemed to slip under Agatha’s skin.
  </p>
<p>
   She pulled back and looked Agatha in the eye at her next words.
  </p>
<p>
   “Should I take my time with you...” she murmured, her words were deliberate and calculated. “Pull it from you,
        inch by inch, bringing you closer and closer to the edge until I decide to let you fall?”
  </p>
<p>
   Her fingers were back on Agatha’s, sliding up once more this time not stopping, just barely grazing her the
        fabric of her leggings with a featherlight touch that made Agatha’s whole body tense. She gripped the door with
        white-knuckled intensity, struggling to keep her breath steady.
  </p>
<p>
   “Or...” Rio continued, her voice dark and rich, “can I push you over again and again, until you have nothing left
        to give?”
  </p>
<p>
   And then, just as her hand reached the place Agatha’s pulse was hammering for, she withdrew, leaving Agatha
        breathless and reeling.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mind raced.
  </p>
<p>
   With men, she typically only came once—twice was rare, reserved for the few lovers who knew her body well enough
        to bring her there. But on nights when she was alone and feeling especially frustrated, she had managed to push
        herself over the edge a couple of times.
  </p>
<p>
   So, technically, she knew she was capable.
  </p>
<p>
   She felt Rio’s fingers tap impatiently against her thigh, a silent reminder to answer.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed, feeling a flush creep up her neck, and opened her mouth, her voice coming out softer than she’d
        intended.
  </p>
<p>
   “Multiple,” she said, hating the breathlessness in her own voice.
  </p>
<p>
   The smile that overtook Rio’s face was nothing short of predatory. She leaned back, her gaze assessing, as though
        seeing Agatha in a whole new light—like a child with a new toy she
  </p>
<p>
   couldn’t wait to explore, to test, to push every button.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio settled comfortably into the seat and turned fully toward her, that smirk still in place.
  </p>
<p>
   “Alright,” she said smoothly. “Onto the rules. And you know this one,” she teased, her voice dripping with
        amusement. “Rule Number One: If you want something, you just have to...”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes, cutting her off.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Yes—I know
   </em>
   ,” she hissed, feeling both annoyed and flustered.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio chuckled, the sound low and dark.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good. Rule Number Two: Pick a safe word.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes widened slightly.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Jesus
   </em>
   —why would I need a safe word? What exactly do you plan on doing to me?”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smile deepened, and she leaned in just enough to murmur, “
   <em>
    As many things as you’ll let me.
   </em>
   Hence,
        the need for a safe word.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha hated the thrill those words sent through her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Fine,” she said, clearing her throat. “Stop.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio nodded approvingly, a flicker of intensity in her gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   “Easy enough.”
  </p>
<p>
   She shifted, holding Agatha’s gaze with a seriousness that made her heart skip.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay... Rule Number Three: When we get to your place. You are not in charge. When I ask you to do
        something—you’ll do it.”
  </p>
<p>
   “What—”
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha,” Rio interrupted, her voice steady, cutting through her protest. “At work, you’re the boss. You’re in
        control. But here... when we’re like this, you’re not the boss anymore.
   <em>
    I am
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw tightened, her mind scrambling for a retort.
  </p>
<p>
   “You can’t honestly expect me to just—”
  </p>
<p>
   “I expect you to listen.” Rio’s tone was firm, her expression unyielding, leaving no room for argument.
  </p>
<p>
   She meant every word.
  </p>
<p>
   A flare of defiance sparked in Agatha’s chest, a resistance that Rio had to have known would surface sooner or
        later. She understood Rio wanted her to surrender, but this—this felt like
  </p>
<p>
   too much, like a line she wasn’t ready to cross.
  </p>
<p>
   “And if I don’t?” she shot back, her tone heated, nearly mocking. “What are you going to do, spank me?”
  </p>
<p>
   The words had barely left her mouth and she already regretted them. She saw the glint in Rio’s eyes, that
        familiar look of interest shifting into something sharper, hungrier.
  </p>
<p>
   “Would you like me to spank you?” Rio asked, her voice dropping, threading the question with dark amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse spiked, her cheeks warming under Rio’s intense gaze. She opened her mouth to fire back a retort,
        but nothing came. Her throat was dry, her mind scrambling to reject the idea, but her body betrayed her, a faint
        shiver running down her spine. She forced herself to meet Rio’s eyes, feeling both exposed and cornered, as
        though Rio had peeled back a layer she hadn’t meant to show.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, she managed to mutter, “I didn’t say that,” but her voice lacked conviction, sounding far more uncertain
        than she’d intended.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smile spread, slow and knowing.
  </p>
<p>
   “No, you didn’t. But you didn’t exactly say no, either.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio paused, her gaze holding Agatha’s with an intensity that felt almost suffocating. When she finally spoke, her
        tone was like steel, unyielding and final.
  </p>
<p>
   “The rules are non-negotiable,” she said, her voice low but unshakable. “If you can’t accept them, then we
        shouldn’t continue this.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt her anger flare, the heat rising swiftly in her chest. The idea that everything hinged on her giving
        up complete control felt like an impossible demand—one she wasn’t willing to swallow so easily.
  </p>
<p>
   “All because I won’t let you boss me around?” Agatha shot back, her voice laced with sharp defiance.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze remained unwavering, calm yet simmering with an intensity that made Agatha's pulse quicken.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha,” Rio answered, her tone almost exasperated, as if Agatha was missing the point of what she was trying to
        say. “I don’t want to just boss you around. That’s not the point. You’ll find that even when you are completely
        vulnerable to me, you still hold every ounce of your power that you’ve always had—
   <em>
    especially over me.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   She let the silence stretch, allowing the weight of her words to hang in the air between them.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio leaned in just enough to blur the space between them, her voice softening, coaxing.
  </p>
<p>
   “Just think about it, Agatha,” she murmured, each word a quiet pull as she reached up and touched Agatha’s face,
        cradling it like it was something precious. “You’ve carried power so well—commanded it, shaped it into something
        fierce, something no one else dares to touch.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her eyes searched Agatha’s face, intent, unwavering.
  </p>
<p>
   “But here... with me... what if you didn’t have to hold onto it so tightly?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath came shallow, her heart pounding as Rio’s words settled into her, dismantling her defenses one
        careful piece at a time.
  </p>
<p>
   She wanted to resist, to summon the sharp retort that would restore the distance between them. But there, under
        Rio’s hand, with her thumb brushing a tender line across her cheek, she found herself unable to move, unable to
        break away.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyes held hers, deep and steady, drawing her further in.
  </p>
<p>
   “Letting go doesn’t make you weaker, Agatha. It gives you room to experience something beyond what you’ve allowed
        yourself to feel.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her voice softened, almost a caress itself.
  </p>
<p>
   “What would it be like to surrender, just for a moment? To feel freedom instead of weight?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s head spun, her usual resolve faltering as Rio’s words seeped into places she hadn’t known were
        vulnerable. It was terrifying and magnetic, a thrill and a threat, every word coaxing her toward a choice she’d
        never considered.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio tilted her head, her gaze never wavering.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’d still be you, Agatha. Powerful. Resilient. But you’d also know... what it feels like to let someone else
        shoulder it, to give you something in return.”
  </p>
<p>
   She paused, her fingers slipping slightly down Agatha’s neck, her touch gentle but relentless.
  </p>
<p>
   “Will you let me give that to you?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed hard, the weight of Rio's question pressing into her like a force she couldn't ignore. Her mind
        scrambled for footing, her usual defiance rising up instinctively, but each time she tried to summon it, Rio’s
        unwavering gaze and steady hand kept pulling her back, leaving her teetering on the edge of surrender.
  </p>
<p>
   She could feel every inch of Rio’s presence, the subtle strength in her fingers tracing along her neck, the
        intensity in her eyes, as if Rio could see through every wall she’d ever put up, every line she’d ever drawn to
        keep herself in control.
  </p>
<p>
   And somehow, the idea of letting those walls fall, even just a little, sent a shiver of anticipation down her
        spine.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse hammered in her chest, her mind still reeling but finding something solid in Rio’s words, in the
        promise beneath them. She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling Rio’s hand steady against her, grounding her.
  </p>
<p>
   When she finally opened her eyes, there was a flicker of something raw, something unguarded that she couldn’t
        fully mask. She didn’t have all the answers—didn’t even understand the full extent of the pull she felt—but
        something inside her had shifted, loosening, breaking apart the edges of her usual resolve.
  </p>
<p>
   “Alright—fine,” she said, trying to keep her tone dismissive, as if this wasn’t a big deal, as if she weren’t
        trembling inside. She fought to sound unaffected, to pretend her heart wasn’t pounding, her defenses wavering.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ll... try,” she added, a touch of reluctance slipping through, as though she couldn’t quite surrender to the
        thought of surrendering.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze softened, a glint of something both satisfied and understanding crossing her face, as though she
        recognized exactly how much it had cost Agatha to say those words.
  </p>
<p>
   The car came to a gentle stop, and Agatha recognized the familiar view of her high-rise condo building outside
        the window. She needed something—
   <em>
    anything
   </em>
   —to cut through the intensity hanging thick between them, to
        leave the car with something lighter.
  </p>
<p>
   “Any other rules,
   <em>
    master
   </em>
   ?” she mocked, quirking an eyebrow.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio let out a snort, shooting her an unimpressed look, though the slight curve of her lips betrayed a flicker of
        amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yeah—one more. Rule Number Four: Don’t fall in love with me.”
  </p>
<p>
   The second the words left Rio’s mouth, Agatha laughed, unable to resist.
  </p>
<p>
   The cliché was almost too predictable, falling right into the box she’d expected.
  </p>
<p>
   This rule, she could handle with ease.
  </p>
<p>
   No problem at all.
  </p>
<p>
   There was no way in hell she’d fall in love with this woman.
  </p>
<p>
   This—
   <em>
    whatever this was
   </em>
   —it was purely physical, purely sexual, nothing more.
  </p>
<p>
   Her laughter continued as she opened the door and stepped out, ducking down to meet Rio’s gaze. She caught the
        subtle quirk of Rio’s lips as she moved to follow, clearly amused by Agatha’s reaction.
  </p>
<p>
   Before Rio could step out, Agatha smirked, leveling her gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   “Trust me,
   <em>
    darling
   </em>
   ,” Agatha drawled, savoring this moment. “That won’t be an issue.”
  </p>
<p>
   And with that, she shut the door, cutting off whatever response Rio might have had.
  </p>
<p>
   Turning, she strode toward her building, laughter still bubbling up as she heard the car door open behind her,
        the unmistakable sound of Rio stepping out, her footsteps close behind. Agatha didn’t have to look back to know
        Rio’s eyes were likely narrowed, her stare burning into Agatha’s retreating form.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d probably pay for that little move later, but at this moment, it was worth every second.
  </p>
<p>
   Her amusement faded, though, as she stepped into the lobby, the familiar walls of her high- rise suddenly closing
        in, as reality settled in. She pressed the elevator button, tapping her fingers against her purse, her mind
        racing as she thought of what might wait for her up in her condo. Of what Rio was going to do to her.
  </p>
<p>
   Had she underestimated this game with Rio?
  </p>
<p>
   Pushed just a little too far?
  </p>
<p>
   The elevator doors opened, and she stepped in, only to turn and see Rio follow her inside, moving in close, her
        gaze never leaving Agatha’s face.
  </p>
<p>
   As the doors closed, Agatha caught Rio’s eyes, dark and steady, a smirk lingering on her lips, but her gaze held
        a certain challenge, a quiet promise that made Agatha’s pulse skip.
  </p>
<p>
   The doors sealed shut, and Agatha swallowed, her mouth suddenly dry as Rio’s eyes bore into her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She might’ve miscalculated.
   </em>
</p>

   Chapter Summary 
Here is 7,000 words of the dirtiest words I've ever written. Enjoy.
   <p>
    Also, the chapter title had me kicking my feet giggling.
    <br/>
</p>
</code>
<p>
   Agatha slid her keys into the lock, pushing the door open and stepping inside, acutely aware of Rio slipping in
        behind her and closing the door with a soft click. Her condo, usually her sanctuary, suddenly felt charged and
        uncomfortable under the weight of Rio’s presence.
  </p>
<p>
   This was her home— her haven , the one place she could unwind. But now, it felt different, as though every corner
        had eyes, watching and waiting.
  </p>
<p>
   She locked the door behind her, setting her purse on the entry table and hanging her coat in the entryway closet.
        Bending down to unzip her boots, she placed them to the side without looking back, though she could feel Rio’s
        gaze fixed on her.
  </p>
<p>
   Straightening up, Agatha moved down the hallway, which felt longer than usual. The quiet sounds of Rio removing
        her shoes echoed behind her until she stepped into the open-concept kitchen and living area. Making a beeline
        for the top shelf, where she kept the liquor out of Nicky’s reach.
  </p>
<p>
   She then went to grab a glass, and contemplated only grabbing one out of spite alone, but grabbed two instead,
        setting them on the counter.
  </p>
<p>
   She was mid-pour on the second glass when she heard an impressed whistle.
  </p>
<p>
   Looking up, she caught Rio’s gaze lingering at the threshold, her casual attire seeming slightly out of place yet
        oddly fitting in Agatha’s home.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha's condo was anything but the typical whitewashed, lifeless space common in the building.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, it exuded a character, just like her.
  </p>
<p>
   Deep, dark wood paneled the walls, while wrought-iron accents framed the tall, floor-to- ceiling bookshelves
        brimming with well-loved books. Plush leather armchairs and a wide sofa created an inviting atmosphere, and a
        grand iron chandelier cast warm, flickering shadows.
  </p>
<p>
   The space felt both opulent and lived-in, distinctly homey —a sanctuary for her and Nicky.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze drifted around the room, taking in every detail before landing back on Agatha, her brow lifting when
        she noticed Agatha already drinking, the second glass waiting beside her.
  </p>
<p>
   With an infuriating ease, Rio stepped forward, crossing the dark hardwood floors with a confidence that made it
        look as if she’d been here a thousand times—as if she owned the place.
  </p>
<p>
   She reached for the glass Agatha had poured, lifting it to her lips and taking a slow sip, her eyes never leaving
        Agatha’s, every movement deliberate, holding Agatha’s gaze with an intensity that left no room for escape.
  </p>
<p>
   Not even in her own fucking home.
  </p>
<p>
   They drank in silence, the weight of it pressing heavily on Agatha, who found herself drumming her fingers
        against the countertop, feeling her irritation build. Meanwhile, Rio seemed completely at ease, standing there
        like she was in her own space, every sip deliberate, every glance measured.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s mind raced, wondering how exactly one was supposed to turn an awkward silence into... whatever this was
        supposed to become.
  </p>
<p>
   Clearly, she wasn’t supposed to be in charge here—
   <em>
    right
   </em>
   ?
  </p>
<p>
   Shouldn’t it be Rio, then, who decided when to start...
   <em>
    this?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But when Agatha finally glanced up and caught Rio’s gaze again, she felt a flash of realization.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio was watching her with that maddening smirk, her eyes gleaming over the rim of her glass as she took another
        slow sip.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She was doing this on purpose.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She was letting the silence drag, deliberately letting the tension build, because she knew it was making Agatha
        uncomfortable, throwing her off balance.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a game—a silent, calculated play to keep Agatha on edge.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And damn it, it was working.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha gritted her teeth, downed the rest of her drink in a single go, and set the glass down with a loud
   <em>
    clink
   </em>
   against the granite, the sound echoing through the silence.
  </p>
<p>
   "So, are we doing this, or what?" she demanded, her eyes narrowing at Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   The agitation inside her flared, fueling her next words.
  </p>
<p>
   "
   <em>
    Or do I need to ask for permission
   </em>
   ?" she spat, her tone laced with mockery.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio didn’t flinch, didn’t so much as blink.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio held Agatha’s gaze, calm and unruffled, before taking another slow sip, savoring the tension. When she set
        her glass down, it landed softly beside Agatha’s, the quiet gesture radiating a control that only heightened the
        simmering electricity between them.
  </p>
<p>
   Without another word, Rio walked across the floor and into the living room, settling onto the middle of the couch
        that faced the kitchen. She leaned back, arms draped casually over the backrest, exuding a relaxed confidence,
        unaffected and—to Agatha’s reluctant admission—
   <em>
    very
   </em>
   sexy.
  </p>
<p>
   As Agatha watched, Rio tilted her head, her dark eyes seeming even darker in the faint light, her gaze holding a
        quiet intensity that rooted Agatha in place.
  </p>
<p>
   Then, her voice rougher than before, Rio gave a simple command.
  </p>
<p>
   “Come here.”
  </p>
<p>
   At Rio’s command, a shiver ran down Agatha’s spine, her body responding instinctively.
  </p>
<p>
   But old habits die hard—and defiance flared just as hot as desire, leaving her feeling trapped —caught between
        the control she wasn’t quite ready to set sacrifice and the insistent pull of her body, practically begging to
        be the sacrificial lamb.
  </p>
<p>
   Without a word, Agatha reached for Rio’s abandoned glass, the one with a splash of very expensive bourbon left,
        and brought it to her lips, drinking as if the liquor could force her past this internal tug-of-war, as if it
        might silence the part of her that rebelled.
  </p>
<p>
   Across the room, Rio’s eyes narrowed, a dark edge flashing through them.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Agatha,
   </em>
   ” she said, her voice a warning, laced with a challenge. “If you’re struggling with something
        this simple, then you’re going to have a
   <em>
    very
   </em>
   long night ahead of you.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words hit hard, a quiet promise that left Agatha’s pulse racing, her nerves fraying and her instincts telling
        her she was in way over her head. She finished off Rio’s drink in a single gulp, setting the glass down with a
        clink, the liquor making her feel reckless as she leaned against the countertop.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    You promise?
   </em>
   ” she mocked, her tone daring.
  </p>
<p>
   That one landed.
  </p>
<p>
   She saw it in the subtle shift in Rio’s face, the tick of her jaw, the flare of her nostrils.
  </p>
<p>
   Suddenly, Agatha felt like a wildlife photographer admiring the beauty of a grizzly bear— right before it mauled
        her to death.
  </p>
<p>
   She stood there, wondering how this would unfold, how Rio would handle her defiance. Maybe part of her was doing
        this on purpose, just to test the boundaries, even if it was dangerous.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio didn’t move; she just held her gaze, a quiet storm simmering behind her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “Did you know I have total recall?” she asked, her question abrupt, seemingly out of nowhere.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, caught off guard.
  </p>
<p>
   As she thought about what Rio said, it wasn’t entirely surprising. The way Rio moved through massive stacks of
        paperwork without missing a detail, connecting things that even Agatha missed—it made sense.
  </p>
<p>
   What didn’t make sense is why she was telling Agatha this now.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s leaned forward, her eyes locked on Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “I can recite word for word the shipping report I read yesterday,” she continued. “I can tell you by memory alone
        the report I wrote on blue whales in fifth grade. And I can still remember the exact color, taste, and texture
        of the birthday cake my
   <em>
    abuelita
   </em>
   made me on my thirteenth birthday.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha raised a brow at that.
  </p>
<p>
   “I already figured you had something—photographic memory or close to it,” Agatha replied, though a prickling
        sensation warned her that Rio was leading her somewhere with this monologue.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio leaned in closer, her gaze steady, unyielding. The silence thickened between them, and suddenly, Agatha’s
        4,000 square foot condo felt as tight as a closet. Rio’s presence, calm and controlled, filled the room, and
        Agatha could feel her pulse thrumming in response.
  </p>
<p>
   “If you knew I have a memory like that,” Rio said, her voice a quiet, deliberate murmur, “then why are you
        already pushing me on something as simple as asking you to come over here
   <em>
    ...knowing I won’t forget it?
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   The question lingered, heavy and challenging.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had to give it to her—
   <em>
    game recognizes game.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio Vidal not only knew how to choose her words but also how to set the stage, to weave tension so skillfully it
        felt like a physical force. Agatha could already picture her in a courtroom, drawing in the jury and opposing
        counsel alike, leading them through her story with the same calculated ease.
  </p>
<p>
   Swallowing, Agatha felt the weight of Rio’s words sink in—the subtle promise and warning layered beneath them. A
        shiver ran down her spine, and for once, she felt completely,
   <em>
    deliciously
   </em>
   outmatched.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha found herself moving forward, each step deliberate, and yet, she told herself, it was her choice. Not
        because Rio had asked, but because a fierce curiosity had ignited within her. She wanted to know where this was
        going, wanted to see if Rio really could handle her—if anyone could.
  </p>
<p>
   With every step, her condo seemed to stretch, feeling endless as Rio’s eyes tracked her movement, unrelenting and
        heavy. The space between them seemed to thicken, each footstep like walking through quicksand, her pulse
        pounding louder with each inch closed.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, finally, she was there, close enough to feel Rio’s calm, steady presence.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stopped just short of reaching out, her heart hammering as she looked up to meet Rio’s gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   She moved to sit down, but Rio’s voice stopped her in her tracks.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    No
   </em>
   ,” Rio said, her voice calm but firm, tapping her thigh. “Here.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, her eyes widening.
  </p>
<p>
   “You want me to straddle you?” she asked, disbelief edging her tone.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyes narrowed, her gaze never wavering.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “I want you to listen,”
   </em>
   she replied, her voice carrying an unspoken command that sent a shiver down
        Agatha’s spine.
  </p>
<p>
   Every part of her bristled at the order, but the pull was undeniable, leaving her caught in a silent war between
        mind and body. She stood there, resisting, a flicker of defiance still holding her in place.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Agatha
   </em>
   ,” Rio warned, her tone low and measured, “I am exactly three seconds away from getting up and
        walking out that door.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She wouldn’t.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio held her gaze, unwavering, her face deadly serious.
  </p>
<p>
   “Three.”
  </p>
<p>
   A spark of panic flared in Agatha’s chest.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Okay, maybe she would.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “Two.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio placed her arms down by her side, as if ready to push herself up.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha clenched her teeth, already hating this game.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay, fine!” she exclaimed, stepping forward and settling herself across Rio’s lap, one leg on either side.
  </p>
<p>
   The flush of embarrassment crept up her neck, her pride prickling at the position.
  </p>
<p>
   Straddling a lover was nothing new—she’d done it countless times, always as a power play, her way of showing she
        was in charge.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    But this was different.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She hadn’t chosen this position; Rio had forced her into it, demanded it.
  </p>
<p>
   And Agatha had answered.
  </p>
<p>
   She hated herself a little for it, that stubborn pride twisting in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   Trying to salvage what was left of her control, Agatha put an overtly fake sexual look on her face as her eyes
        locked onto Rio’s.
  </p>
<p>
   “Is this the part where you tell me I’ve been a
   <em>
    bad, bad girl
   </em>
   ?” she taunted, her tone raspy and
        mocking. She needed to put on a front, to claw back some piece of control, anything to level the playing field.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio rolled her eyes at Agatha’s dramatis, though the faint flick of a smile betrayed her feigned annoyance.
        Without a word, she extended her hand between them, her gaze shifting back up to meet Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   “Give me your hand.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, surprised by the request.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d expected Rio’s next move to be something more overtly sexual, something she’d need to brace herself
        against.
  </p>
<p>
   But this—this was different,
   <em>
    disarming.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Her curiosity got the better of her, and before she could second-guess it, she placed her hand in Rio’s, letting
        the moment settle just as deeply as Agatha’s bottom onto Rio’s lap.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha watched, transfixed, as Rio focused entirely on her hand, her touch featherlight as she traced lines over
        the back of her hand, from the tips of her fingers to her wrist. Rio’s gaze never left Agatha’s hand, her
        expression intense, almost reverent, as though she was mapping each line, committing every detail to memory.
  </p>
<p>
   When she finally flipped Agatha’s hand over, her touch shifted, her fingers pressing a little more firmly,
        massaging the tension out of each muscle with slow, deliberate pressure.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt herself let out a shaky breath, fighting the urge to lean into the feeling because,
   <em>
    damn
   </em>
   ,
        it felt
   <em>
    really good
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   The simplicity of it, the care in Rio’s touch, was disarming in a way she hadn’t anticipated.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your hands,” Rio murmured, her voice soft, almost to herself, “were the first thing I noticed about you.”
  </p>
<p>
   She continued, her fingers moving along Agatha’s palm, pressing into the base of each finger, her attention so
        focused it was as though nothing else existed in that moment.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s fingers worked methodically, pressing into the contours of Agatha’s hand with focused care.
  </p>
<p>
   “You have beautiful hands, Agatha,” she murmured, her thumb digging into a particularly sore spot, sending a wave
        of relief through Agatha’s palm.
  </p>
<p>
   The compliment, paired with the sudden release of tension, pulled a tiny moan from Agatha before she could stop
        herself.
  </p>
<p>
   Thankfully, Rio didn’t react—she just kept massaging, her concentration unbroken.
  </p>
<p>
   “They’re restless,” Rio continued, her tone matter-of-fact. “They’re always moving. You talk with them as loudly
        as you do with your mouth—
   <em>
    and that’s saying something
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha huffed, a reluctant smile tugging at her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio gave the smallest of smiles but didn’t look up, her focus still on the hand she held. She worked in silence
        for another minute before gently setting Agatha’s hand down and holding her own hand out, palm up, waiting.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t say a word, didn’t glance up, but her expectation was clear.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And damn it
   </em>
   , without hesitation, Agatha placed her other hand into Rio’s, hating the way she didn’t
        even question it.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s fingers began the same ritual, tracing the back of her hand, then flipping it over, massaging the tension
        out with a slow, steady rhythm.
  </p>
<p>
   “Even when you’re sitting,” Rio continued quietly, her voice dropping, “they tap, flick, and twirl.”
  </p>
<p>
   The silence between them grew thick again as Rio worked her fingers over every muscle, each movement deliberate.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, her voice softened, almost a whisper.
  </p>
<p>
   “It’s...enticing to watch. The power in them.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her fingers lingered, then traced a light path down Agatha’s middle finger, slowing as she reached the tip.
  </p>
<p>
   “And when I watch them move, I can’t help but wonder,” she murmured, drawing out each word, “what these fingers
        would feel like inside me.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath caught, a gasp escaping before she could stop it, her pulse pounding, heat flaring to life under
        Rio’s slow, unrelenting gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s fingers moved slowly, deliberately, trailing over Agatha’s in a way that made her words resonate even
        deeper.
  </p>
<p>
   Each touch, each drag of Rio’s fingers painted an image that seared into Agatha’s mind. In every fantasy, she’d
        always imagined what Rio would do to her, the way Rio would take charge.
  </p>
<p>
   But now, with Rio’s soft invitation hanging in the air, Agatha found herself caught in a wholly new picture—one
        where she was the one leaving Rio breathless, pulling her to the edge.
  </p>
<p>
   The thought shot through her, a blazing heat flooding her body, and she gasped, the intensity so consuming that,
        without thinking, she pulled her hand back, as if it were Rio’s touch and not her own imagination that had
        burned her.
  </p>
<p>
   But before she could escape, Rio’s fingers tightened around her hand, her grip firm, her eyes snapping up to meet
        Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   Those dark eyes drew her in, deeper and deeper, and any defiance or control she clung to vanished in the weight
        of Rio’s gaze, leaving her bare, breathless.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio leaned closer, her voice barely a whisper, her words threading into Agatha’s very pulse.
  </p>
<p>
   “Are you picturing it, Agatha?” Rio asked, her tone deceptively calm, though the intensity in her gaze matched
        the fire searing through Agatha’s veins. “Imagining what it would be like to bury these fingers inside me... to
        curl them, feel me tighten around you as I came?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha was never—
   <em>
    ever
   </em>
   —at a loss for words.
  </p>
<p>
   But now, under Rio’s unyielding gaze, with that question hanging thick in the silence, she forgot how to breathe,
        let alone speak. Words, normally her weapon and shield, had slipped far out of reach, leaving her utterly
        defenseless.
  </p>
<p>
   A faint smirk curved Rio’s lips, a flicker of predatory satisfaction in her eyes as she took in Agatha’s
        reaction, the silent surrender written across her face.
  </p>
<p>
   “Tell me, Agatha,” she continued, her voice smooth, almost too casual, “have you ever fucked a woman?”
  </p>
<p>
   A ragged breath escaped her, filling her lungs with air that felt like fire.
  </p>
<p>
   She shook her head, her response instinctive, almost childlike in its simplicity.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s grip tightened around her hand, the pressure firm and commanding.
  </p>
<p>
   “Use your words, Agatha,” she said, her voice a velvet command that left no room for defiance.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse raced, a small whimper pressing against her throat, threatening to escape. This was too much—her
        body already felt like it was on fire, and all Rio had done was touch her
  </p>
<p>
   hands. She’d never experienced anything like this, a desire so intense it left her trembling.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    No
   </em>
   ,” she managed, her voice a broken whisper.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smile deepened as she glanced back down, her fingers tracing slow, deliberate patterns over Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   “Hmmm...” she murmured, still massaging, still playing with Agatha’s fingers as though weaving a spell. “I think
        you’ll like it.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed, lost in the scene Rio was setting, the steady, relentless seduction pulling her in.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, watching Rio’s fingers glide over her hand.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio looked up again, her gaze piercing.
  </p>
<p>
   “Because you like power,” she said simply. “And the most powerful feeling in the world... is having a woman come
        undone around your fingers, your tongue—or other things we can explore later.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her words hung heavily in the air, but the
   <em>
    other things
   </em>
   lingered higher, painting vivid images that had
        Agatha closing her eyes, as if trying to shield herself from the vision Rio had woven, a vision that felt almost
        tangible in the air around them, pulsing with each beat of her heart.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt Rio set her hand aside, felt her shift beneath her, and then the featherlight brush of fingertips
        along her jaw. Then Rio’s hand came up, cupping her face fully, her thumb tracing a line across Agatha’s cheek
        with a softness that made her eyes flutter open.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio was watching her, eyes dark and intent, and Agatha felt Rio’s hand slide up, fingers curling around the back
        of her neck, guiding her forward with the gentlest tug.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And god,
   </em>
   Agatha didn’t need any more encouragement.
  </p>
<p>
   She surged forward, crashing her lips into Rio’s with a hunger that had been building with every touch, every
        word.
  </p>
<p>
   She felt the faint curve of a smile on Rio’s lips, but she was too far gone to care, too consumed by the need to
        pour every ounce of heat, every bit of tension, into that kiss—to satisfy the relentless fire burning inside
        her.
  </p>
<p>
   Their mouths met in a collision, surprising Agatha with how Rio didn’t immediately take control, didn’t steer the
        kiss.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, she let Agatha lead, let her pour every ounce of tension, every need she’d kept pent up, into the kiss.
        It quickly turned messy, all tongue and teeth, both of them groaning into each other, feeding off the intensity.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s hands moved up, slipping into Rio’s hair for the first time, fingers sinking into the silky strands. She
        raked her nails along Rio’s scalp, and the low groan that rumbled from Rio in response sent a thrill through
        her, her hips instinctively rolling forward, pressing into Rio’s lap.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha gasped as she felt Rio’s hands slip under her sweater, the first touch of her fingers against bare skin
        sending a shiver through her body.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s hands moved deliberately, tracing the lines of her back, fingers exploring her skin in a way that felt both
        soothing and electrifying. Her touch spanned from light and teasing to firm and commanding, until finally, nails
        dragged down her spine, pulling a moan from Agatha that Rio swallowed with her kiss.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, just as she was losing herself to the sensation, Rio’s hands left her skin, shifting to the hem of her
        sweater.
  </p>
<p>
   Their eyes met for a heartbeat, a silent understanding passing between them.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t hesitate.
  </p>
<p>
   She pulled her hands free from Rio’s hair, lifting them over her head to let Rio strip the sweater away, exposing
        her to the cool air and to Rio’s intense, unwavering gaze. Rio’s eyes traveled over her, lingering on her chest,
        her breasts clad in deep purple lace.
  </p>
<p>
   The look of barely restrained hunger on Rio’s face made Agatha’s breath catch, sparking a thrill that left her
        wanting more.
  </p>
<p>
   She leaned forward, moving to close the space between them with another kiss, but Rio stopped her with a firm
        hand pressed to her chest, splayed right between her breasts, holding her back.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sucked in a breath, her gaze dropping to see Rio’s hand where it touched her, feeling the heat of it
        against her skin. She looked up, noticing the subtle struggle in Rio’s expression —the way her breathing
        deepened, her jaw clenched, her control barely held in check.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, Rio seemed to center herself, her eyes meeting Agatha’s with a smoldering intensity.
  </p>
<p>
   Her voice was low, controlled.
  </p>
<p>
   “Take off your pants.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha should have felt a flush of embarrassment at how quickly she moved to obey, practically scrambling off
        Rio’s lap. Her fingers hooked into the waistband of her leggings, ready to pull them down, but the second she
        glanced up and caught Rio’s gaze, she froze.
  </p>
<p>
   The way Rio watched her—intense, dark,
   <em>
    unyielding
   </em>
   —sent a thrill racing through her that made her pause,
        her breath catching. She hadn’t lost her power. It was right there, simmering, and she could feel it waning
        under Rio’s gaze, even her skin prickled with vulnerability.
  </p>
<p>
   Finding that steady edge, Agatha took a slow breath, then slid her leggings down, peeling them off inch by inch,
        her movements deliberate. She stepped out of them, kicked them to the side, and stood before Rio in nothing but
        her bra and underwear, both lace, both purple—her favorite.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And gods
   </em>
   , the way Rio looked at her. She couldn’t recall a single time
   <em>
    anyone
   </em>
   had looked at
        her like that, with a reverence and hunger that made her heart stammer.
  </p>
<p>
   The memory of Rio’s words in the town car floated to the surface, echoing in her mind as she stood there,
        exposed.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “You’ll find that even when you’re completely vulnerable to me, you still hold every ounce of your power that
            you’ve always had—especially over me.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha felt it now, that balance of control and surrender, as Rio’s gaze held her in place, appreciating her,
        worshipping her.
  </p>
<p>
   And for the first time, she understood.
  </p>
<p>
   Vulnerability didn’t strip her of power; it transformed it, turning it into something more potent, something that
        demanded acknowledgment.
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t weakness.
  </p>
<p>
   Standing there, bare before Rio, she felt a strength that both terrified and thrilled her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio hadn’t asked her to submit out of dominance alone; she’d asked because she wanted Agatha’s choice, her
        consent, her unguarded self.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a partnership, a balance of power where each surrender was met with reverence, not conquest. She could see
        it in Rio’s eyes, the weight of responsibility that came with her command, the respect woven into each word and
        touch.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt her confidence surge, grounding her, steadying her, even as her pulse raced.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t diminished here, wasn’t made small.
  </p>
<p>
   She was being seen—fully,
   <em>
    completely
   </em>
   —and every inch of her power was still hers to wield, even in
        surrender.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha,” Rio murmured, her voice softer, almost a breathless whisper, stripped of its usual control. “You are...
   <em>
    stunning
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   The words sent a fresh wave of warmth through Agatha, the sincerity in Rio’s tone striking her deeper than she
        expected. It wasn’t a compliment tossed lightly, wasn’t an empty praise. It felt raw, almost reverent.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And God
   </em>
   , Agatha felt beautiful in a way she hadn’t before—powerful, desired, and entirely herself.
  </p>
<p>
   “Come here,” murmured Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   Without a second’s hesitation, Agatha stepped forward, closing the distance between them, and lowered herself
        into Rio’s lap.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio took Agatha’s hands, one by one, guiding them to the back of the couch over her shoulders, positioning them
        with a calm certainty. Then she looked up, her gaze holding Agatha’s with a tenderness that sent a shiver down
        Agatha’s spine.
  </p>
<p>
   “Do not move your hands,” Rio said, her tone almost tender. “Can you do that for me?”
  </p>
<p>
   The request so gentle, so deliberate, that Agatha’s stomach tightened.
  </p>
<p>
   She hadn’t known what to expect when Rio took control.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d anticipated something dirtier, rougher—Rio pinning her down, demanding,
   <em>
    taking
   </em>
   . And while that
        thought had its appeal, this...
   <em>
    this was something else entirely
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   It was soft yet charged, electric, and it made her body respond in ways she hadn’t imagined. She could feel the
        dampness pooling in her underwear, the ache of wanting Rio to touch her.
  </p>
<p>
   Every movement, every word, was building, stacking moment upon moment, until she felt she might break—and Rio had
        barely laid a hand on her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    God, she wanted her to touch her.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded, then caught herself, realizing Rio would want her to say it aloud. She swallowed, as though
        needing to brace herself, to prepare her voice for a single word.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes.”
  </p>
<p>
   The way Rio’s eyes darkened at her response sent another thrill through her, as if she recognized the commitment
        in Agatha’s answer, the surrender to the game they were playing.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Good girl
   </em>
   ,” she murmured.
  </p>
<p>
   And there it was again—
   <em>
    those damn words.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha wanted to hate them; she
   <em>
    really
   </em>
   did.
  </p>
<p>
   But the way they made her body respond, the way they sank into her like a spell, left her unable to deny the
        effect.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio leaned in, her fingers wrapping around Agatha’s hips, anchoring them both, as if steadying herself as much as
        Agatha. She brought her lips to Agatha’s chest with the softest of touches, so light that Agatha felt more
        breath than kiss.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched, her fingers digging into the couch fabric as she fought the urge to reach for Rio, to
        thread her fingers through her hair, to pull her closer to the exact spot she
  </p>
<p>
   needed her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    This was going to be fucking torture.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   And Agatha knew that this is exactly what Rio wanted.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s mouth was everywhere, her lips firm, her tongue joining in to tease and torment. She kissed along the tops
        of Agatha’s breasts, traced a hot line across her collarbone with her tongue, and then sucked hard where her
        neck met her shoulder, leaving a mark that felt both possessive and reverent.
  </p>
<p>
   But it wasn’t just her mouth. Rio’s hands roamed over her, palming Agatha’s breasts, her thumb brushing
        tantalizing circles over her nipple through the lace, fingers gripping handfuls of her ass, squeezing with a
        possessiveness that made Agatha gasp.
  </p>
<p>
   Each touch felt like an exploration, Rio mapping every inch of her, cataloging every shiver, every gasp, every
        roll of Agatha’s hips. It was as if she was constructing an intimate knowledge of Agatha’s body, filing away
        each response.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nearly let out a breathless laugh at what she was doing—Rio was building a case.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rio Vidal v. Agatha Harkness.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   And she was winning, effortlessly.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s hand slipped forward, tugging one cup of Agatha’s bra down with deliberate slowness, exposing her nipple to
        the cool air. Then, without hesitation, Rio’s mouth closed over it, her lips warm and soft, tongue swirling
        before her teeth grazed the sensitive skin.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s head fell back, a groan escaping her lips as her fingers dug into the couch for support, her legs
        trembling at the sensation. Every touch, every pull of Rio’s mouth was calculated, an artful mix of pressure and
        release that had Agatha’s body pressing closer.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s own groan hummed against her, sending a fresh wave of heat through Agatha as she felt Rio’s other hand palm
        her ass, squeezing with greedy intensity. She couldn’t resist; her body moved on instinct, grinding into Rio’s
        lap, each roll of her hips building her up more.
  </p>
<p>
   And then Rio bit down, just enough to send a sudden jolt through Agatha’s entire body, an electric charge that
        made her hands fly to Rio’s hair, fingers tangling in the soft strands as her control slipped.
  </p>
<p>
   In response, she felt the sharp crack of Rio’s palm against her ass, the sting immediate, sharp, and fiercely
        delicious. The slap, combined with the heat of Rio’s mouth on her nipple, was intoxicating—
   <em>
    overwhelming
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   A moan tore from her, deep and needy, echoing through the room. Agatha’s eyes flew open in surprise, her pulse
        racing from the intensity of it.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio pulled back, releasing her nipple with a soft, lingering
   <em>
    pop
   </em>
   , her gaze flicking up to meet Agatha’s
        with a glint of satisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
   They held each other’s stare, the air between them charged and heavy, and then that damn smirk curved over Rio’s
        lips. Her hand, still resting on Agatha’s ass, rubbed over the freshly marked skin, a soothing yet possessive
        touch that sent another thrill through her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well,” Rio murmured, her voice low, amusement dancing in her eyes as her fingers pressed firmly into the spot
        she’d just slapped. “I guess that settles our question from earlier.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let out a breathless laugh, the sound a mix of surprise and exhilaration.
  </p>
<p>
   But then Rio raised a brow, and Agatha instantly knew what she was asking. With a huff of mock annoyance, she
        slid her hands out of Rio’s hair and placed them back on the couch, following the unspoken command.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smile softened, her hand lifting to cup Agatha’s face, her thumb brushing lightly across her cheekbone.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re being surprisingly good,” she murmured, voice warm with a hint of pride.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha rolled her eyes, but the effect was softened by her own smirk.
  </p>
<p>
   “I can follow directions.
   <em>
    I just don’t like to
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio let out a quiet snort, her eyes gleaming.
  </p>
<p>
   “That, I can believe.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha became acutely aware of Rio’s other hand tracing a slow path down her body, starting at her neck, then
        down her collarbone, her ribs, each touch making her shiver. The warmth of Rio’s palm on her cheek, steady and
        grounding, contrasted with the teasing path of her other hand as it ventured lower.
  </p>
<p>
   “What about a reward system?” Rio asked, her tone almost playful, but the glint in her eyes held something more.
        “You listen...
   <em>
    you get a prize
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha scoffed, though she couldn’t stop the slight tremor that ran through her as Rio’s fingers skimmed down her
        side.
  </p>
<p>
   “What--you’re going to give me a sticker? Maybe put it on the fridge next to my kid’s artwork?”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio chuckled, her hand flickered down from her cheek, and Agatha could feel her hand wrapped around her neck,
        feel the press of her thumb just a little more firmly into Agatha’s pulse.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, I think I can come up with something a bit more memorable than a sticker.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her fingers drifted lower, slipping beneath the edge of the waistband of Agatha’s underwear, making her breath
        hitch as the thrill of Rio’s "
   <em>
    reward
   </em>
   ” settled over her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s hips twitched instinctively, and she managed a shaky nod.
  </p>
<p>
   “Deal,” she murmured, her voice barely a breath.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk deepened, her hand dipping lower, teasingly slow, until her fingers slipped through Agatha’s heat
        with ease. Agatha’s eyes snapped shut, a deep, guttural groan escaping her as the sensation overtook her.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Jesus, Agatha
   </em>
   ,” Rio whispered, her tone a blend of surprise and pleasure, as though even she hadn’t
        anticipated the extent of the effect she had on Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s fingers moved with a slow, deliberate rhythm, and the sounds that spilled from Agatha’s lips were raw,
        unfiltered—sounds she didn’t even recognize as her own. Every touch, every glide of Rio’s fingers sent waves of
        pleasure through her, unraveling her composure piece by piece.
  </p>
<p>
   She could feel her control slipping; she wasn’t going to last long.
  </p>
<p>
   When Rio’s fingers finally brushed over her clit, Agatha let out a loud, desperate moan, her hips grinding
        instinctively into Rio’s hand, chasing the intensity that built with every passing second. The pressure, the
        rhythm, Rio’s steady gaze on her—it was sensory overload, and Agatha’s body responded eagerly, almost
        mindlessly, surrendering fully to the pleasure.
  </p>
<p>
   The release was so close, Agatha could feel it gathering inside her, building to the point where each whimper
        that escaped her lips grew louder, needier. She was right on the edge, ready to fall—and then, suddenly, Rio’s
        fingers withdrew entirely, leaving her aching, empty.
  </p>
<p>
   A raw, frustrated whine tore from her throat, quickly replaced by a growl of anger. Her eyes snapped down to Rio,
        her shoulders heaving as she tried to catch her breath.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Why
   </em>
   ?” she demanded, her voice thick with desperation and irritation.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio looked up at her calmly, bringing her hand to her lips, her fingers glistening with Agatha’s wetness. With
        deliberate slowness, she licked each finger clean, one by one, her gaze never leaving Agatha’s. The sensual
        display sent a fresh wave of heat through Agatha, nearly enough to tip her over the edge even without being
        touched.
  </p>
<p>
   She could do nothing but just sit there and watch.
  </p>
<p>
   And when Rio finished, she leaned back casually against the couch, her head resting with a relaxed ease, as
        though Agatha wasn’t trembling on top of her.
  </p>
<p>
   “What is rule number one, Agatha?” she asked, her tone maddeningly calm, as if her mouth wasn’t full of Agatha’s
        taste, as if Agatha weren’t about to combust right on top of her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath came in ragged bursts, her mind racing, replaying Rio’s words until the meaning snapped into
        place. She could almost hear Rio’s voice in her ear even though she sat there silently.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Agatha, if you want something, you just have—”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Realization dawned, and her nostrils flared in defiance. She knew what Rio was asking for, and it grated against
        every ounce of her pride.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “I am not begging,”
   </em>
   Agatha ground out, her voice thick with defiance, even as her body betrayed her with
        a slight tremor, her chest heaving with each ragged breath.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyebrow lifted, an infuriating hint of amusement glinting in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “Then you’re not cumming.”
  </p>
<p>
   A low growl slipped from Agatha’s lips. Her fingers dug into the couch, gripping it so fiercely that she could
        feel the fabric begin to strain and twist beneath her nails.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Seriously
   </em>
   ?” she spat, frustration simmering just below the surface, her body wound so tight.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio remained perfectly calm, a slight smirk dancing at the corner of her mouth.
  </p>
<p>
   “You want
   <em>
    your reward
   </em>
   ,” she murmured, her tone almost mocking, “then you follow the rules.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed, a last flicker of rebellion flashing across her face.
  </p>
<p>
   “I can always get myself off,” she hissed, jaw clenched, her words carrying a mix of stubborn pride and
        challenge. “
   <em>
    Give myself my own reward
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio paused, her gaze holding Agatha’s in a way that made the air between them feel heavy, charged. Then, with a
        slow, deliberate motion, she reached back, took one of Agatha’s hands, and brought it forward, dropping it
        firmly into her lap.
  </p>
<p>
   “Have at it,” Rio taunted, her voice low and sultry, her eyes gleaming with dark satisfaction as she leaned back,
        arms crossed, watching Agatha with an intensity that sent her pulse racing.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha looked down, her hand hovering uncertainly in her lap, her skin still tingling with the memory of Rio’s
        touch. The tension between them thickened, each second stretching impossibly long as Rio’s gaze pinned her, both
        a spectator and the very source of her frustration.
  </p>
<p>
   “What are you going to do, Agatha?” Rio asked softly, her voice a gentle push, a challenge simmering beneath her
        words.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart pounded as she wrestled between two impossible choices: to beg or to get herself off in front of
        Rio. Both options left her feeling exposed, vulnerable, her heart hammering harder at the thought of either. She
        turned slightly, looking away from Rio, feeling the weight of her expectations.
  </p>
<p>
   She could work up the nerve to touch herself right here in Rio’s lap, but she didn’t want her own touch—not this
        time. She’d been doing that for days, and the ache inside her had become too consuming, too deep. She needed
        Rio’s touch, needed her to be the one to pull her over the edge.
  </p>
<p>
   The ache spread wide and open within her, and she knew she couldn’t walk away, couldn’t bear the thought of never
        knowing what Rio’s hands felt like pushing her to the brink.
  </p>
<p>
   She hated the decision even as she made it, but she turned back to Rio, her voice coming out softer, more
        vulnerable than she’d intended.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Please.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The word felt foreign on her tongue, raw, but instead of mocking her or dragging it out with a smug “
   <em>
    please
            what
   </em>
   ,” but Rio simply met her gaze, understanding flickering in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   Slowly, she reached out, took Agatha’s hand, and lifted it back up, and Agatha waited for it to come back to the
        couch, but instead, Rio guided her to the back of her head, encouraging her fingers to tangle in her hair.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, without hesitation, she leaned in, capturing Agatha’s mouth in a searing kiss.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha melted into it, returning the kiss with equal hunger, and just as her thoughts began to blur, she felt
        Rio’s hand slide back down, slipping under her panties once more, fingers gliding through her.
  </p>
<p>
   And then when Rio entered her with two fingers, the precision and intensity of her touch had Agatha gasping into
        her mouth, the sensation overwhelming, like Rio was finally giving her everything she’d been holding back.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha moved instinctively, riding Rio’s fingers, their mouths crashing together as she groaned, her breaths
        coming in ragged gasps against Rio’s lips. Every thrust, every curl of Rio’s fingers sent her closer to
        unraveling, her whole body trembling under the skillful rhythm of Rio’s hand.
  </p>
<p>
   “That’s it, baby,” Rio murmured against her mouth, her voice dark and coaxing as Agatha began to shudder, her
        quiet whimpers giving way to broken, needy sounds.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha pulled back, breaking the kiss as her hips ground into Rio’s hand, her forehead pressed to Rio’s, her
        breathing ragged.
  </p>
<p>
   “Fuck—please—
   <em>
    just please
   </em>
   ,” she choked out, barely recognizing the sound of her own voice, thick and
        desperate. Somehow, that single “
   <em>
    please
   </em>
   ” had unlocked something in her, the word slipping out over
        and over as Rio’s fingers met every roll of her hips, matching her rhythm perfectly.
  </p>
<p>
   And then Rio’s thumb found her clit, pressing and circling with devastating precision. Each pass, each curl of
        her fingers brought Agatha higher, closer, her body taut with anticipation.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ve got you,” Rio whispered, her voice a steady anchor in the storm, and that was all it took.
  </p>
<p>
   With a final surge of pleasure, Agatha shattered, her body arching, a moan tearing from her throat as she fell
        over the edge, completely and utterly undone.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s body shook, waves of pleasure rippling through her, every nerve ignited as Rio held her, steady and
        sure, her fingers still moving with a slow, grounding rhythm, drawing out every last tremor. Agatha’s grip on
        the couch tightened as her breath came in ragged bursts, her forehead still pressed against Rio’s, unable to
        move, barely able to think. She was weightless, floating, lost in the intensity of it all.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s other hand moved up, fingers brushing tenderly along Agatha’s cheek, her thumb stroking in soothing
        circles. The gentle touch grounded her, bringing her slowly back down, and she could feel Rio’s eyes on her,
        taking in every lingering shiver, every heavy breath.
  </p>
<p>
   When Agatha finally opened her eyes, her gaze met Rio’s, and she saw a warmth there—a blend of satisfaction and
        something softer, unspoken. The silence stretched between them, charged yet comfortable, and for a moment, they
        stayed like that, foreheads pressed together, sharing the stillness after the storm.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “Gold star sticker for you,” she teased, her voice low, like she was proud of just how completely Agatha had
        unraveled for her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let out a breathless laugh, her heart still racing, her voice rough but laced with humor.
  </p>
<p>
   “If you actually try to give me a sticker, I’ll hit you,” she said, the exhaustion mingling with a heady high.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio pouted playfully, her eyes gleaming as if Agatha had spoiled her fun. Then, with a small grin, she placed her
        hands on Agatha’s hips, gently gesturing for her to move aside.
  </p>
<p>
   With a groan, Agatha found the strength to shift, flopping to the side like a dead weight, sinking into the
        couch. She closed her eyes, her body still tingling, pulses of pleasure lingering in her nerves. She could
        barely recall ever feeling so thoroughly undone.
  </p>
<p>
   But just as she settled into the cushion, she heard movement. She cracked one eye open, just in time to see Rio
        reposition herself,
   <em>
    on her fucking knees
   </em>
   , in front of the couch.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, you thought we were done?” Rio asked, grabbing each of Agatha’s legs and hooking them over her shoulders,
        flashing a devilish grin. “No, Agatha—we’re just getting started.”
  </p>
<p>
   And before Agatha could even process, Rio’s mouth dipped down, her tongue gliding through her, and every ounce of
        breath left Agatha’s lungs as she arched off the couch, her eyes slamming shut.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Fuck
   </em>
   ,” she moaned, one hand instinctively tangling in Rio’s hair as pleasure surged through her, raw
        and consuming.
  </p>
<p>
   As Agatha surrendered to the relentless waves of pleasure coursing through, one thing became crystal clear in her
        mind:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rio Vidal had to be death personified, because this woman was definitely trying to kill her.
   </em>
</p>
<h1>
   We Carry On
  </h1>
<p>
   Agatha drifted into awareness slowly, each sensation sharpening bit by bit.
  </p>
<p>
   The first thing she noticed was that she’d definitely been drooling into her pillow. She went to wipe it away,
        but her muscles protested, aching as if she’d just run a 5K.
  </p>
<p>
   And then—her eyes flew open.
  </p>
<p>
   She was naked.
  </p>
<p>
   Sitting up abruptly, she shoved a wild mess of curls from her face, blowing at the stray strands that clung to
        her forehead as she looked around her bedroom.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Empty.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Everything looked exactly the same. But flashes of last night came flooding back, and her hand instinctively
        moved to her chest as she felt her breath catch, heat rushing up her neck.
  </p>
<p>
   Every detail replayed in vivid clarity: Rio’s hands on her, putting her into whatever position she wanted,
        drawing from her sounds she’d never made, sounds she didn’t know she was capable of. The way Rio had taken her
        to the edge, over and over again, until she was a shaking, gasping mess.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    How many times had she come last night?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t sure; she’d lost count.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t even remember falling asleep. She had a distinct memory of Rio still on top of her, coaxing her
        through another climax when Agatha had muttered that she couldn’t take any more. And Rio, with that smirk, had
        simply told her she could—and somehow, she did.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let out a shaky breath, feeling a fresh flush creep over her skin.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Did she really just pass out on Rio afterward?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She couldn’t deny it: Rio had quite literally fucked her into oblivion.
  </p>
<p>
   As Agatha’s mind cleared further, a new realization hit her like a bolt of lightning:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rio hadn’t even taken a single piece of clothing off.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She’d been fully dressed—socks and all.
  </p>
<p>
   Another hot flush of embarrassment crept over Agatha, her face heating at the thought. Rio had completely
        unraveled her, reduced her to a naked, trembling mess, while she herself remained composed, put-together, not a
        hair out of place.
  </p>
<p>
   It had to be purposeful.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Agatha knew it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio was making a point—a deliberate, calculated move to show her who was in control. A subtle power play, a
        reminder that Rio could strip Agatha bare, lay her open in every way, without so much as removing a single piece
        of her own clothing.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha pushed herself up, her muscles protesting every movement as she swung her legs off the bed and stood,
        heading toward the bathroom. She hissed softly as the ache deepened, a full-body reminder of last night’s
        intensity.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Jesus.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She worked with a personal trainer three days a week;
   <em>
    she was in shape.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   So why in the hell did she feel like she’d just survived an ironman?
  </p>
<p>
   Another flush of heat crept over her as she registered that her soreness wasn’t limited to her muscles. There was
        a more intimate ache—a sweet soreness that reminded her exactly how thoroughly Rio had wrecked her.
  </p>
<p>
   She made her way to the bathroom, flipping on the light, and caught her breath as she approached the mirror.
  </p>
<p>
   As her gaze traveled over her body, she let out a low, shaky breath, her eyes narrowing at the dark hickey right
        where her neck met her shoulder. And there, on the top of her breast—
   <em>
    was that a bite mark?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She didn’t even remember that happening.
  </p>
<p>
   She examined her reflection, half-relieved and half-disappointed to see that the rest of her skin bore no visible
        signs, though her body still felt marked.
  </p>
<p>
   It was as if Rio’s hands, her mouth, her tongue—hell,
   <em>
    even her teeth
   </em>
   —had seeped into her muscles,
        leaving traces only she could feel.
  </p>
<p>
   She gripped the edge of the sink, steadying herself, and lifted her gaze, meeting her own eyes in the mirror. She
        let out another shaky breath, trying to process the enormity of it all.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She’d just had the best sex of her life.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   At forty-eight years old.
  </p>
<p>
   And it was with a woman.
  </p>
<p>
   As she stared into the mirror, something shifted. She’d danced around this realization before, but here it was,
        undeniable, hovering right in front of her:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Maybe she was a little bit gay.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It wasn’t a jarring epiphany, not a thunderous shift, but rather a soft acknowledgment she’d kept buried for too
        long. It wasn’t even surprising, but it was the first time she’d really let herself recognize it, to own it
        fully.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked herself in the eye, and for a moment, it was as if her own reflection had something to say back. If
        her inner self could crawl through that mirror, she’d probably shake her for taking this long, for resisting
        something so deeply true. And for all her resistance, here she was, staring herself down, a wry smirk tugging at
        her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   This wasn’t the grand revelation she might have expected.
  </p>
<p>
   It was simply her own truth, finally acknowledged, finally allowed to exist without the usual defenses.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha looked herself in the eye, letting that quiet acceptance settle deeper within her, a strange comfort
        wrapping around her like a warm blanket. For the first time, she felt at peace inside her, a sense of knowing
        that felt right, like slipping into a pair of well-worn shoes.
  </p>
<p>
   But then, a new thought crept in, making her breath hitch as a startling realization hit her with the force of a
        cold shower:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    How in the hell was she supposed to look Rio Vidal in the eye on Monday?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha arrived at the office long before sunrise, telling herself it was to get a jump on the day.
  </p>
<p>
   It had nothing to do with having to walk past the war room to get to her office.
  </p>
<p>
   She definitely wasn’t avoiding the possibility of running into Rio first thing, of catching that piercing gaze
        before she’d even had her morning coffee.
  </p>
<p>
   So, well before the world outside had begun to stir, Agatha was already settled at her desk.
  </p>
<p>
   The office was silent, peaceful.
  </p>
<p>
   It was nice.
  </p>
<p>
   She opened her laptop, glancing over her calendar for the day. She’d wrapped up most of her tasks on Friday,
        which meant she could ease into things, take her time.
  </p>
<p>
   She started by reading through some of the latest Supreme Court rulings and opinions, digesting the legal
        reasoning with interest. A particularly lengthy dissent caught her attention, and she couldn’t help but
        underline a few sharp, pointed comments she found brilliant. She moved on, reviewing updates on pending cases,
        even making a few notes on the procedural quirks in recent case law that she found compelling.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let herself sink into the quiet, diving into a few scholarly articles on legal ethics, making notes and
        jotting down thoughts. She even scrolled through a few industry
  </p>
<p>
   newsletters she’d been putting off, skimming new developments in tech and their potential legal implications.
  </p>
<p>
   The click of footsteps broke the early-morning quiet, and Agatha glanced up to see Billy standing in the doorway,
        his eyes widening in shock as he took in the sight of her already at her desk. She fought the smirk that
        threatened to surface, pleased to have thrown his no doubt meticulously planned morning slightly off track.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good morning, Ms. Harkness,” he managed, holding out a coffee with a slightly unsteady hand.
  </p>
<p>
   She grabbed her coffee and shooed him away with her hand.
  </p>
<p>
   After Billy, the office slowly began to fill, the hum of controlled chaos gradually building around her. Phones
        rang, conversations overlapped, and the steady influx of colleagues created the usual whirlwind.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha, however, kept her focus on her work, ignoring the commotion with practiced indifference. She scanned
        through an email from a client, engrossed in the details and noting a few follow-up points, until a familiar
        presence caught her eye.
  </p>
<p>
   Her focus shifted, almost involuntarily, and she looked up to see Rio walking into the war room. She hated how
        quickly her attention diverted, how an email that had commanded her focus a second ago now felt like white
        noise.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio moved with that same unhurried confidence, her gaze sweeping over the room as she entered. Agatha tensed,
        resisting the urge to sink lower in her chair, and tried to look back at her screen. But her eyes betrayed her,
        darting up just as Rio glanced in her direction, a subtle, knowing smirk playing at the corner of her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, her pulse quickening as that smirk triggered a cascade of memories—Rio’s face
        hovering over her, that same smirk lingering just after she’d come undone beneath her. Heat flared in her
        cheeks, and she forced herself to look back down at her computer, eyes fixed on the screen.
  </p>
<p>
   But the words blurred, every line dissolving into meaningless shapes.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t absorbing a single thing.
  </p>
<p>
   Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, unmoving, as she fought to steady herself, pushing back the memory, the
        flush that came with it, the way her skin still seemed to tingle at the thought of Rio’s touch.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Today was going to be a long, fucking day.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha was right.
  </p>
<p>
   She usually was.
  </p>
<p>
   She barely survived the day but for a different reason then she thought.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead of being unraveled by Rio, Agatha’s clients decided to do it for her.
  </p>
<p>
   The first involved the “
   <em>
    golden child
   </em>
   ”—a client’s privileged son caught with enough drugs to land him a
        felony. Forcing Agatha to wade into the depths of the crowded criminal court, navigating the throngs of people
        for a quick bond hearing and then an even faster negotiation with the prosecutor to sidestep a criminal record.
  </p>
<p>
   She hated these cases, especially for petty, non-violent crimes.
  </p>
<p>
   The courthouse was packed, bodies pressed shoulder-to-shoulder, all waiting with various levels of exhaustion and
        resignation etched into their faces. Ninety-nine percent of these people would rely on court-appointed
        attorneys, overworked and overwhelmed, and far too many would find themselves steamrolled by a system already
        stacked against them.
  </p>
<p>
   This was the side of the law Agatha despised—the tangled, inequitable mess where justice had little to do with
        fairness, where the scales tipped heavily against those without the resources to fight back. The whole place
        reeked of brokenness, the kind of brokenness that only showed itself when you peeled back the polished veneer of
        courtroom dramas and legal ideals.
  </p>
<p>
   But she did her job—the golden child out on bond, no problem. And after a few blunt negotiations with the
        prosecutor, she’d arranged a deal that would lead him straight to community service and rehab, effectively
        wiping his slate clean.
  </p>
<p>
   Just as she wrapped up at the courthouse, Agatha was called across town for another so- called emergency. This
        time, it was one of her largest clients—a prominent investment group whose offices were currently being combed
        through by the FBI, courtesy of a freshly minted warrant. Agatha wasn’t surprised. She knew the game; all
        investment groups played dirty to get ahead. Her job was to make sure none of that dirt stuck.
  </p>
<p>
   Corporate law was her domain, her specialty. She liked it for precisely that reason—no pretenses of fairness, no
        illusions. Everyone in the game had deep pockets, and everyone knew the stakes. There were no unjust systems,
        just players with endless resources and the right team to back them up.
  </p>
<p>
   She arrived just as the FBI agents were starting to dig in, and she almost laughed when she saw their faces fall
        as she stepped off the elevator.
  </p>
<p>
   They knew her.
  </p>
<p>
   They knew her reputation.
  </p>
<p>
   And they knew they were in for an uphill battle now that she was here.
  </p>
<p>
   As soon as she stepped into the office, she took control, keeping the agents meticulously within the bounds of
        the warrant, blocking them the second they overstepped.
  </p>
<p>
   She couldn’t resist poking holes in their case wherever she found them, asking pointed questions and spotting
        inconsistencies just for fun, watching with satisfaction as their confidence wavered.
  </p>
<p>
   By the time Agatha finally made it home the company thankfully survived the search— barely but the exhaustion had
        settled into her bones, a heavy weariness from a day that had been relentless from start to finish.
  </p>
<p>
   But there was at least one silver lining:
   <em>
    she hadn’t had to spend a single second at the office with
            Rio.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She hadn’t had to look into those sharp, knowing eyes, or see the expression of a woman who’d seen her completely
        undone, exposed in every possible way. She didn’t have to face the smirk she knew Rio would wear—that
        insufferable,
   <em>
    knowing smirk
   </em>
   . The same one that had lingered over her as she’d come, that had teased
        from between her thighs, that had pressed into her shoulder when Rio had taken her from behind.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a smirk burned into her body and mind, embedded in every touch and every look.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could almost feel the ghost of it now, heat prickling her skin as the memories simmered just beneath the
        surface.
  </p>
<p>
   But at least tonight, she didn’t have to face it in person.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d escaped—for now.
  </p>
<p>
   As she opened her door, balancing a pizza box in one hand, she stepped inside and braced herself for the familiar
        sound of quick footsteps pounding across the floor. Sure enough, a split second later—
  </p>
<p>
   “Mama!”
  </p>
<p>
   The exhaustion that had clung to her all day evaporated, replaced by a warmth that only one person in the world
        could bring out in her. She nudged the door shut with her foot, just in time to see Nicky rounding the hallway
        corner at full speed, a whirlwind of energy and joy barreling straight toward her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had learned from experience, so she tightened her grip on the pizza box with both hands and braced
        herself.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oomph!” Agatha grunted as Nicky collided into her, his small arms wrapping tightly around her waist.
  </p>
<p>
   He was all boy—rough and tumble on the outside, but with a heart so tender it made hers ache.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Gods,
   </em>
   she’d missed him, and the simple joy of having him home was enough to dissolve any remnants of her
        exhausting day.
  </p>
<p>
   Once she steadied herself, she balanced the pizza box in one hand, reaching down to ruffle his dark curls,
        smiling down at him.
  </p>
<p>
   “Hi, baby,” she murmured, cupping his face and leaning down to kiss the top of his head. “How was school?”
  </p>
<p>
   He launched into a mile-a-minute recap, still latched onto her like the world’s sweetest leech, as she made her
        way to the kitchen and set the pizza on the countertop.
  </p>
<p>
   Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Sonya, Nicky’s nanny since he was a baby, waving as she put on her coat
        and headed toward the door. It had been their routine for nearly six years: Agatha would walk through the door,
        Sonya would hand things over to her, and Nicky would take center stage.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky kept talking as Agatha got out the plates, splitting a slice onto each before carrying them both to the
        table. She barely had time to sit down before he clambered into her lap, grabbing his slice, his stories
        tumbling out between mouthfuls as he relayed everything that happened in his classroom, excitement pouring out
        of him.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha wrinkled her nose at his enthusiastic, slightly messy chewing but didn’t correct him. He was excited, and
        he’d missed her, just as much as she’d missed him.
  </p>
<p>
   She took a bite of her own pizza, nodding along as he shifted topics—from the classroom drama to the types of
        clouds he’d learned, naming each one and its meaning with startling precision.
  </p>
<p>
   He was smart—sometimes scarily so.
  </p>
<p>
   His teachers had already marked him as gifted, though he struggled emotionally, especially when he got
        frustrated. He had a tendency to run—
   <em>
    literally bolting
   </em>
   when things didn’t go his way.
  </p>
<p>
   She could almost picture her ex-husband’s exasperated look whenever they got a call from the school about Nicky’s
        “getaway stunts,” his face silently screaming:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Where do you think he gets this from?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha had just taken a bite of her pizza when Nicky blurted out.
  </p>
<p>
   “Daddy has a new girlfriend. Amanda. She’s nice. She took me to the zoo.”
  </p>
<p>
   She froze mid-chew.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    So, James is seeing someone—again.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Her ex-husband had gone through a rotating lineup of women since their separation, most of whom came and went
        before she even had the chance to meet them. And, like a cliché of wealthy divorced dads, James didn’t exactly
        date in his age group. Agatha had met one or two over the years, all of them at least twenty years his junior.
  </p>
<p>
   James was fifty-two, for God’s sake.
  </p>
<p>
   It was ridiculous.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky kept talking, oblivious to her thoughts.
  </p>
<p>
   “Daddy is happy. He smiles more.”
  </p>
<p>
   He took another bite of pizza, then paused, his small brows drawing together as his nose scrunched up in that
        familiar way he did when he was thinking hard.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha braced herself, recognizing that look all too well. Her son had a habit of speaking with the brutal
        honesty only a child could wield.
  </p>
<p>
   He reached up, pressing his greasy, pizza-stained fingers to her cheek, looking at her with a curious expression.
  </p>
<p>
   “You don’t smile a lot.”
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Ow.
   </em>
   Agatha winced inwardly.
  </p>
<p>
   It is amazing how kids could unknowingly bury daggers in their parents’ hearts with their blunt, innocent
        observations.
  </p>
<p>
   She managed to keep her composure, setting her pizza down as she wrapped her arms around him, holding him close.
  </p>
<p>
   “I smile,” she insisted softly, and then, with a mischievous grin, she tickled him, smiling as he burst into
        giggles and squirmed in her arms. “See? I smile all the time with you.”
  </p>
<p>
   When the tickling subsided, Nicky’s laughter faded, and he looked at her with that same serious, searching gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   “But what about when I’m gone? Do you smile when I’m gone?”
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Damn it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   This kid was trying to kill her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha opened her mouth, ready to give him a reassuring lie—something simple.
   <em>
    Of course, I smile when you’re
            not here,
   </em>
   even though the truth was far from it.
  </p>
<p>
   But before she could speak, Nicky’s eyes lit up as though he’d had the best idea in the world.
  </p>
<p>
   “Maybe you can get a girlfriend like Daddy—so you can smile even when I’m not here.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha laughed at that, a startled, genuine laugh.
  </p>
<p>
   “You mean a boyfriend, honey,” she corrected gently.
  </p>
<p>
   But Nicky only shrugged, as if it made no difference to him.
  </p>
<p>
   “You didn’t smile with any of your boyfriends.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stilled, her breath catching as she absorbed his words.
  </p>
<p>
   She hadn’t realized Nicky had been watching her so closely, hadn’t known he’d picked up on the things she kept so
        carefully hidden. She’d thought she’d shielded him from her own disappointments, put on a brave face as she
        tried to navigate dating again after the divorce.
  </p>
<p>
   Yet here he was, perceptive in that unfiltered way only her child could be, seeing through her mask to the truth
        she hadn’t even fully admitted to herself:
   <em>
    that the men she’d dated hadn’t made her happy.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Since the divorce three years ago, she’d tried to move forward. She’d gone on plenty of dates, a few even turning
        into short-lived relationships, but none had ever clicked. She even introduced Nicky to one or two men she’d
        thought might last.
  </p>
<p>
   They hadn’t.
  </p>
<p>
   He hadn’t liked them, and she hadn’t blamed him.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Honestly, she’d barely liked them herself.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Her attempts at dating had all felt empty, like trying to force pieces into a puzzle that just didn’t fit.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky, meanwhile, picked up his slice again and took a big bite, chewing thoughtfully before looking back up at
        her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Maybe you need a girlfriend instead of a boyfriend,” he said, words muffled around his mouthful but clear
        enough.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, caught completely off guard by the innocent but strangely perceptive comment. She forced a small,
        wry smile, hoping he’d move on to a less jarring topic.
  </p>
<p>
   But Nicky just kept looking at her, waiting, his wide eyes expectant and curious.
  </p>
<p>
   She let out a breath, her mind racing through the events of the past few days, the revelations she’d had, and her
        unexpected, undeniable connection with Rio. Her son’s words lingered, pressing gently but insistently against
        the parts of herself she’d barely started to acknowledge.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, she gave a small shrug, her voice softer than usual.
  </p>
<p>
   “Maybe, kiddo,” she murmured, reaching out to ruffle his hair with a gentleness that felt like both a reassurance
        to him and a grounding touch for herself. “Maybe.”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky grinned, clearly pleased with her response, and dove back into his pizza, blissfully unaware of the quiet
        stirrings within his mother’s heart.
  </p>
<h1>
   Earthly and Divine
  </h1>
<p>
   The next few days were, in every way, a gauntlet Agatha could never have anticipated. It was like some cruel
        twist from a TV show Disney would make—where the heroine must face an endless string of trials to reach her
        goal.
  </p>
<p>
   Only, in this version, Agatha’s prize wasn’t a throne or treasure at the end, but the chance to make it through
        each day with her dignity intact.
  </p>
<p>
   No client emergencies, no pressing meetings; it was as if the universe itself had aligned to trap her in Rio's
        orbit.
  </p>
<p>
   No escape routes.
  </p>
<p>
   No distractions.
  </p>
<p>
   Just Rio, haunting her like a ghost she couldn’t banish.
  </p>
<p>
   And Agatha?
  </p>
<p>
   She was impossibly,
   <em>
    unbearably
   </em>
   turned on.
  </p>
<p>
   And Rio—
   <em>
    damn her
   </em>
   —knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   The flicker of awareness in those dark, relentless eyes, the curve of her smirk that teased but gave nothing
        away, made Agatha’s skin prickle with an intensity she hadn’t felt in years.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio didn’t push too hard—she was far too clever for that.
  </p>
<p>
   Her gestures were maddeningly subtle.
  </p>
<p>
   She had found new ways to murmur Agatha name, her tone so low and deliberate that Agatha’s pulse raced. She
        brushed against her with the smallest touch, the barest graze of fingers when handing her a file or slipping a
        pen across her desk.
  </p>
<p>
   None of it was overtly sexual.
  </p>
<p>
   But to Agatha?
   <em>
    It was everything.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Now that she knew the sharp precision of Rio’s hands, the control held within those strong, capable fingers, her
        mind flooded with images of what they could do. She knew the wicked skill of her tongue, the way those dark eyes
        could blaze with something wild, almost feral, when Agatha finally gave in and came undone beneath her.
  </p>
<p>
   The flicker of memory alone was enough to leave her breathless, pulse quickening, her muscles tightening with a
        need that was impossible to ignore.
  </p>
<p>
   After three days of utter, unrelenting torment, Agatha found herself lying awake, staring at the ceiling of her
        bedroom. Even her own bed—her sanctuary—had become a shrine to Rio Vidal. She’d washed the silk sheets, sure,
        but the memory of Rio was impossible to cleanse. No matter how many times she stripped the linens, the ghost of
        what Rio had done to her here lingered, as vivid and stubborn as ever.
  </p>
<p>
   She gritted her teeth, frustrated and desperate, fingers trailing to where she thought she could find relief.
  </p>
<p>
   But it was just... okay.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Fine.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Nothing could match the real thing, and the ache only deepened, pulsing stronger with every touch that couldn’t
        quite measure up.
  </p>
<p>
   Before she even realized it, Agatha grabbed her phone and typed a quick message to Billy. Her finger hit
   <em>
    send
   </em>
   almost instinctively.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     Get me the phone number for Rio Vidal.
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   The reply was nearly instant—Billy was nothing if not exceptional at his job.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     830-557-2136.
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   She made a mental note to give him a generous holiday bonus this year.
  </p>
<p>
   But now that she had the number staring back at her, mocking her from the screen... did she have the courage to
        actually send the text?
  </p>
<p>
   The thought alone had her gritting her teeth.
  </p>
<p>
   When had she become so... hesitant?
  </p>
<p>
   So wound up over a simple message?
  </p>
<p>
   She was Agatha
   <em>
    Fucking
   </em>
   Harkness.
  </p>
<p>
   It was time to start acting like it. Rio Vidal would not turn her into some flustered schoolgirl.
  </p>
<p>
   With forced confidence, she typed out a message.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     Did you finish that discovery request like I asked?
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   Wow.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Real brave.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha glared down at her phone, almost as if she could will the text back into oblivion. But her brows shot up
        when she saw the familiar dots of a reply appear on her screen, followed by:
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     "Agatha?"
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   She pursed her lips, already irritated. So she fired back.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     "No. It’s God. Just checking in."
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   Then another message, quickly followed.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     "Yes. Of course it’s me."
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   The typing bubbles popped up again, and Agatha held her breath.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     "It’s on your desk."
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   Of course it was. She hadn’t been expecting it until tomorrow at the earliest; it would take any other associate
        that long to finish. But of course, Rio had completed it in half the time. Agatha’s fingers tightened around her
        phone.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     "Hmmm... I’ll have to read it tomorrow then."
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   She hit send and sighed, wondering how to take this any further. Rio had to know she wasn’t reaching out at this
        hour just to check in on paperwork she hadn’t expected until the following day.
  </p>
<p>
   Almost as if reading her mind, another message appeared.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     "Is that all you needed?"
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha stared at the words, feeling the smirk behind them, the confidence that radiated through the screen.
  </p>
<p>
   She couldn’t help herself but rise to the challenge.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     "Send me your address."
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   Direct.
  </p>
<p>
   A clear enough signal without laying it all out.
  </p>
<p>
   But then the message sat there—read, with no response.
  </p>
<p>
   Five minutes crawled by, each second stoking the embers of embarrassment in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, she threw her phone aside, squeezing her eyes shut as if it could somehow shut off the heat of being
        left on read.
  </p>
<p>
   Then, a buzz.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha hated herself for nearly dove across the bed, grabbing her phone with a swiftness that surprised even her.
        She clicked the message open, holding her breath as she read the single word:
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     "Ask."
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   After securing the nighttime nanny for Nicky and notifying her on-call driver, Agatha found herself parked
        outside Rio’s building. Surprisingly, Rio lived close—just 20 minutes away in Chelsea.
  </p>
<p>
   It was... unexpected.
  </p>
<p>
   How did a first-year associate afford a place in this neighborhood?
  </p>
<p>
   The building itself, like most in Chelsea, brimmed with character: a vintage charm mixed with modern edges,
        bricks that had weathered decades, ivy curling along the edges, and tall windows reflecting the city lights.
  </p>
<p>
   Stepping out into the cold, brisk night, Agatha glanced back at her driver and told him she’d call when she was
        ready. He’d likely assume she was here for a client emergency. It wouldn’t be the first time she’d left her home
        in the middle of the night to manage some crisis.
  </p>
<p>
   She stopped under the brick archway leading into the entry, her eyes scanning the old- fashioned buzzer system.
        Rio’s apartment number was listed at the bottom.
  </p>
<p>
   Without hesitating, she pressed the button.
  </p>
<p>
   The response was immediate—a soft buzz, followed by the sound of the door unlocking.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha grabbed the door, pulling it open and stepped inside.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio lived on the fifth floor—the top,
   <em>
    and of course
   </em>
   , this building had no elevator.
  </p>
<p>
   She let out a breath, then started up the stairs.
  </p>
<p>
   The building was quiet, every creak and echo a reminder of where she was going and who was waiting at the top.
  </p>
<p>
   Halfway up, she silently thanked herself for choosing sensible footwear—this wasn’t a night to be hiking up
        stairwells in heels. By the time she reached the top, her breath was slightly uneven, but she recognized it
        wasn’t just from the climb but from the anticipation pooling in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   She reached Rio’s door, raising her fist to knock.
  </p>
<p>
   For a moment, she hesitated, her hand hovering.
  </p>
<p>
   It was an unfamiliar feeling, standing on someone’s doorstep like this, feeling...
   <em>
    exposed
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   But she was here. She wasn’t about to turn back now.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Fuck it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She knocked.
  </p>
<p>
   The door swung open almost instantly, and there was Rio, phone pressed to her ear. She gave Agatha an apologetic
        look and gestured for her to come inside.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t move, instead her gaze traveled over her—hair thrown up in a messy ponytail, loose gray sweatpants,
        and a faded ¾-sleeve T-shirt that read, “
   <em>
    Bohner Family Reunion: Pitch a Tent
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   It was absurdly casual,
   <em>
    ridiculous even
   </em>
   , but somehow Agatha hated how good Rio looked in it. There was
        a rawness, a realness to her like this, and her heart gave a sharp, unexpected lurch.
  </p>
<p>
   This was a side of Rio she hadn’t imagined—one that felt strangely
   <em>
    intimate
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk widened, catching Agatha’s gaze lingering, and it was only then that Agatha realized she’d been
        staring.
  </p>
<p>
   Fighting the flush that crept up her neck, she stepped inside, keeping her expression carefully composed.
  </p>
<p>
   The door clicked shut behind her, sealing them into a space that was nothing like she’d expected. The apartment
        was sleek, modern, but certainly eclectic, with accents and unexpected bursts of color.
  </p>
<p>
   But what really threw her was the sheer amount of plants.
  </p>
<p>
   They covered nearly every corner and surface, greenery spilling over in every direction, transforming the space
        into a kind of urban jungle.
  </p>
<p>
   Along the far wall, a glass door opened onto a rooftop patio, where a frosted glass greenhouse stood amidst even
        more plants and a cozy seating area.
  </p>
<p>
   What the hell?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rio Vidal had a green thumb?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha would never have guessed.
  </p>
<p>
   Even momentarily thrown, Agatha found herself thinking it was strangely...
   <em>
    charming
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   She kept taking it all in, trying to reconcile this side of Rio with the one she knew professionally, and
        somewhat personally. Her gaze roamed around the room, until Rio’s voice pulled her back.
  </p>
<p>
   This time, Rio was speaking, and Agatha nearly snapped her neck turning toward the sound of her rapid-fire
        Spanish.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d known Rio was bilingual—it was right there on her HR profile—but hearing her speak this way, with a
        different tone, a distinct cadence, and a warmth she hadn’t heard before?
  </p>
<p>
   That she wasn’t prepared for.
  </p>
<p>
   The way her voice sounded.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Jesus.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha was starting to think she’d miscalculated coming over here.
  </p>
<p>
   Between Rio’s casual outfit, the surprising setting of her apartment, personal effects scattered everywhere, and
        now hearing her speak in Spanish, this felt like an entirely different Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   This was not the tightly controlled woman she’d thought she was beginning to understand.
  </p>
<p>
   Yet somehow, this version of her felt right, more complete.
  </p>
<p>
   And Agatha’s heart gave an unexpected stutter at that thought.
  </p>
<p>
   Suddenly, the spacious apartment felt uncomfortably tight.
  </p>
<p>
   Without looking back at Rio, she made her way out to the patio, feeling her eyes on her but unable to stay in
        that room another second.
  </p>
<p>
   Outside, she stepped directly into the small greenhouse. The temperature was still warm, clearly heated to stave
        off the creeping autumn chill.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha immediately took off her jacket the heat from both inside her and outside her becoming too overwhelming as
        she draped it over chair, and she took in her surroundings.
  </p>
<p>
   The greenhouse was different than what she’d expected, filled not only with greenery but with vibrant flowers in
        a kaleidoscope of colors—deep purples, soft pinks, bright yellows.
  </p>
<p>
   It was undeniably beautiful.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha found herself drawn to a single white bloom near her, its petals open in full, soft and delicate against
        the stark green of its leaves. She reached out, fingers brushing gently over the velvety petal, and felt a bit
        of her tension begin to unwind, if only slightly.
  </p>
<p>
   Then she heard the door creak open behind her.
  </p>
<p>
   She turned to see Rio walking toward her, two beers in hand.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio extended one to her with a soft, apologetic smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “Sorry about that,” she murmured, her gaze tracing over Agatha. “My
   <em>
    abuelita
   </em>
   doesn’t care about time
        zones.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t quite sure how to respond to that, but she accepted the beer anyway. She didn’t drink beer often,
        but at this point, she’d drink straight gasoline if it took the edge off her nerves. She took a few quick sips,
        grimacing slightly at the taste, catching Rio’s smirk from the corner of her eye.
  </p>
<p>
   But, thankfully, Rio didn’t push—
   <em>
    yet.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha knew it was only a matter of time.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, Rio settled into one of the chairs, casually tossing her legs up on the low table between them and
        lifting a brow at Agatha, a silent challenge.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    The ball’s in your court.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha threw her a look and took another drink, then crossed to the couch opposite Rio, lowering herself into it.
        The silence that settled between them was heavy, almost tangible, charged with the words they hadn’t yet spoken.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio just watched her, patient, waiting.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha took another sip—
   <em>
    Jesus
   </em>
   , the beer was going down fast—as her gaze drifted over the greenhouse
        again. Soft fairy lights wove across the ceiling, casting a warm, almost ethereal glow over the room. She felt
        herself relax, just a little, drawn in by the unexpected beauty of the space.
  </p>
<p>
   Turning back to Rio, she broke the silence.
  </p>
<p>
   “I didn’t peg you as a ‘
   <em>
    plant person
   </em>
   ,’” she said, gesturing around her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio gave a casual shrug, glancing around the greenhouse as she took a slow pull from her bottle, her eyes
        eventually finding their way back to Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   “I come from a family of migrant farmers,” Rio said, her tone softened by a hint of nostalgia. “I grew up working
        in the fields with them. I find it comforting, having dirt under my nails. It feels like...
   <em>
    home
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   The ease with which she shared something so personal, as if it were the most natural thing in the world,
        surprised Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d expected walls, mystery, maybe a casual deflection—but this openness?
  </p>
<p>
   It was...
   <em>
    unexpected
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha found herself at a loss for words, but Rio seemed to sense it, her gaze shifting as she watched Agatha’s
        reaction. The warmth in her expression from moments before softened, morphing into something sharper, something
        that made Agatha’s pulse quicken.
  </p>
<p>
   The softness was gone, replaced by that familiar, predatory glint.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why are you here, Agatha?” Rio’s voice dropped to a low, almost teasing murmur, her head tilted with that smirk
        that never quite left her face. “Do you...
   <em>
    need something
   </em>
   ?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha hated how easily Rio could slip into this game, how quickly she could turn the mood with a single
        look—with a subtle shift in her tone.
  </p>
<p>
   The effect was immediate, visceral, and Agatha loathed how it put her on edge—yet she was acutely aware of the
        thrill that came with it, the way it made her senses sharpen, made her heart beat just a little faster.
  </p>
<p>
   And now?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Now
   </em>
   , she was also now
   <em>
    painfully aware
   </em>
   of the fall that would come after.
  </p>
<p>
   She took a steadying breath, determined not to let it show, but Rio’s gaze was unwavering, her eyes dark and
        knowing. There was something almost maddening in her confidence, as though she knew exactly the effect she was
        having and enjoyed every second of it.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt her cheeks warm, and she forced herself to hold Rio’s gaze, refusing to be the first to look away.
  </p>
<p>
   The silence between them was charged as Rio’s fingers drummed lazily against the arm of the chair, her eyes never
        leaving Agatha’s face.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed, steadying herself.
  </p>
<p>
   “You know why I’m here,” she said, attempting a deflection she knew Rio wouldn't accept but grasping for it
        anyway.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk only deepened, a glimmer of amusement flickering in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “Do I?” Rio’s tone was dripping with feigned innocence, her gaze steady, unyielding.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart hammered in her chest as she looked at her.
  </p>
<p>
   Here it was—the precipice.
  </p>
<p>
   She had two choices: she could say why she was really here, lay herself bare, and finally get what she wanted, or
        she could lie, turn around, and walk away, resigned to living in this endless state of frustrated longing.
  </p>
<p>
   But Rio seemed to sense her hesitation, the way her resolve wavered. Her feet slid down from the table, her body
        leaning forward, closer, every inch of her focused on Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “Say it,” Rio murmured, her voice softer, lower, coaxing Agatha to cross that final line.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched, her gaze locked on Rio’s, the weight of the moment pressing down on her, the choice
        hanging between them.
  </p>
<p>
   And finally, she let herself give in, her voice barely a whisper.
  </p>
<p>
   “I came here because... I need you.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio licked her lips at that.
  </p>
<p>
   “Need me how?” Rio pressed, her voice smooth, her gaze unrelenting.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let out a shaky breath, knowing the push was coming but feeling the impact of it all the same.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio couldn’t just let things be—couldn’t let her stay in the safety of ambiguity.
  </p>
<p>
   She always had to push, to strip Agatha raw.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha held her gaze, trying to steady herself, but her mind betrayed her, filling with everything she craved:
        she needed to kiss Rio, to feel her hands on her skin, her fingers tracing lines over her body. She needed Rio’s
        mouth, her fingers—everything she had to give, every touch, every whisper. She wanted to be undone by her all
        over again, in every way that mattered.
  </p>
<p>
   But how could she say that?
  </p>
<p>
   Maybe she could—
   <em>
    at least some of it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The words were there, tangled somewhere in her chest, yet saying them felt impossible.
  </p>
<p>
   She hated how Rio did this to her—how easily she could chip away at her confidence, leaving her vulnerable.
  </p>
<p>
   Frustration and nerves simmered inside her, and Agatha wished she could somehow throw Rio off balance for once,
        to push back, to make her rise to the challenge.
  </p>
<p>
   And then an idea sparked—a bold,
   <em>
    terrifying idea.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It was something she’d thought about in vivid, private detail over the past few days.
  </p>
<p>
   Words she never intended to say it out loud, but it would certainly even the playing field, let her take control,
        make Rio respond to
   <em>
    her
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Her pulse quickened as she leaned forward, her voice coming out a touch softer than she intended, betraying her
        nerves.
  </p>
<p>
   “I didn’t get to touch you,” she murmured, feeling a blush creep up her cheeks even as she held Rio’s gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   For a moment, Rio’s face was unreadable and then—her steady composure slipped just slightly as Agatha’s words
        sank in.
  </p>
<p>
   The tension between them felt like a tightrope, and for once, Agatha was the one holding the balance.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio leaned back in her chair, her gaze flicking over Agatha, her lips curving into a slow, uncharacteristically
        uncertain smile.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could see her processing, that ever-present confidence wavering just enough to give her a flash of
        something new—a vulnerability, an edge of surprise.
  </p>
<p>
   “You want to touch me?” Rio replied, her voice quieter, her tone still challenging but softened by a hint of
        intrigue.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha took a slow, steadying breath as she leaned forward, inching closer, savoring the thrill of finally
        turning the tables.
  </p>
<p>
   “You told me you imagined what my fingers would feel like inside you,” she said, her voice stronger, bolder now.
  </p>
<p>
   Her gaze traced over Rio’s face, catching the slight widening of her eyes, the flare of her nostrils as she
        exhaled a slow, measured breath.
  </p>
<p>
   For a moment, Agatha saw Rio’s composure waver, and the satisfaction that surged through her was exhilarating.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Oh.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Now she understood why Rio played this game—why she pushed, why she teased her.
  </p>
<p>
   There was power in holding someone’s desire, of watching them unravel beneath it.
  </p>
<p>
   Emboldened, Agatha pushed further, her gaze unwavering as she met Rio’s eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ve had days to think about what you said,” she continued, letting her voice dip lower. “And now...I want to
        know what it feels like—
   <em>
    to be inside you.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyes darkened as her words landed.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could feel the tension winding between them, taut and electric, and this time, she was the one daring Rio
        to close the distance.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio opened her mouth, and Agatha saw it instantly—the moment she was trying to wrestle back control. The smirk
        began to curl at the corner of her lips, her eyes shifting from surprise to that familiar, daring gleam.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha knew exactly what she was about to say.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Ask.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   So, she beat her to it.
  </p>
<p>
   “Can I touch you?” Agatha murmured, her voice soft but unyielding. “Will you let me do that?”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s mouth hung open mid-sentence, her expression frozen in a rare flash of surprise.
  </p>
<p>
   For a heartbeat, she was speechless, and Agatha savored every second, watching Rio struggle to respond.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a triumph—Agatha was still playing her game, following Rio’s rules, but turning it around, using her own
        rules against her.
  </p>
<p>
   And it was
   <em>
    addicting
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   A rush surged through her as she watched Rio’s resolve slip, her smirk faltering, her control cracking just
        slightly. She held her breath, taking in every flicker of Rio’s expression, knowing that for once, she held the
        upper hand.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And gods
   </em>
   —Rio had two choices now: let Agatha keep it, surrender it to her, or make a move to reclaim
        it.
  </p>
<p>
   A win-win in Agatha's book.
  </p>
<p>
   Her heart pounded, anticipation thrumming through her as she waited to see which it would be.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s gaze locked onto her, really
   <em>
    looking
   </em>
   at her, assessing, holding her in that focused stare that
        sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. She took a long pull from her beer, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s, then set
        the bottle aside.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha watched, feeling the shift in the air, the way everything held its breath as Rio finally made her
        decision.
  </p>
<p>
   Without a word, Rio stood and walked around the small table separating them, stopping directly in front of her.
        She looked down, her gaze piercing, unwavering, and then—without a moment’s hesitation—reached under her shirt
        and pulled it off in one smooth motion.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sucked in a breath, heart pounding at the boldness of it, at how perfectly, confidently Rio claimed the
        moment.
  </p>
<p>
   Her gaze drifted down, taking in the sight of Rio in low-slung gray sweatpants and a black sports bra, her toned
        stomach, her collarbones, the curves of her shoulders. Agatha had imagined what she looked like under her
        clothes, had felt those muscles as Rio held her, moved with her—but seeing her like this, stripped down, was
        something else entirely.
  </p>
<p>
   And just as Agatha’s eyes mapped every inch of newly exposed skin, Rio held her gaze, unflinching, and reached
        under her sports bra, sliding it up and off with the same easy confidence.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched, her gaze drawn, almost helplessly, to Rio’s bare chest.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d never really understood men’s obsession with breasts, never quite grasped the appeal.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    But now?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Sitting here, with Rio in front of her, exposed and so effortlessly confident, she finally understood.
  </p>
<p>
   Her eyes traced over Rio’s skin, taking in the soft curve, the way her collarbones led down to the surprsing
        fullness of her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio Vidal naked form the top up, was an artful kind of beauty, something strong and feminine that demanded
        attention, and Agatha found herself captivated, feeling her pulse quicken in response.
  </p>
<p>
   She felt an almost magnetic pull—to touch, but instead she curled her fingers into her pants, and then met Rio's
        gaze—daring her to take it further.
  </p>
<p>
   A small smile tugged at the corner of Rio’s lips as she noticed Agatha’s challenge, a hint of satisfaction
        flickering in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   With a steady gaze locked onto Agatha’s, she hooked her thumbs into the waistband of her gray sweatpants, already
        hanging low on her hips, and slowly, deliberately, dragged them down.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sucked in a ragged breath, her pulse hammering as she realized—Rio wasn’t wearing anything underneath.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mind went blank, and for a moment, she could only stare, taking in the sight of Rio standing bare before her,
        bold and unflinching. Every inch of her was captivating, raw and beautiful in a way that felt almost surreal.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s mouth went dry, her heart pounding as she struggled to process the sheer intensity of the moment.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s confidence was undeniable, almost intoxicating, and as she stood there, a small, knowing smile playing on
        her lips, Agatha felt her own control slipping. She felt vulnerable and powerful all at once, entranced by the
        woman in front of her and by her own longing that didn’t know what to do with.
  </p>
<p>
   A sudden wave of nervousness washed over her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio was calling her out, clear as day.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    You want to touch me? Then touch me
   </em>
   , her gaze seemed to say, steady and unwavering.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And fuck
   </em>
   —Agatha wanted to.
  </p>
<p>
   She wanted to touch, to taste, to let herself finally give in to everything she’d been holding back.
  </p>
<p>
   But how?
  </p>
<p>
   She knew
   <em>
    how
   </em>
   , of course, but she didn’t know how to do it without trembling, without her hands
        betraying the unsteadiness she felt, without making it look as though this was her first time touching another
        woman.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha despised being uncertain—
   <em>
    or god forbid
   </em>
   —bad at anything.
  </p>
<p>
   Her heart raced, anticipation mingling with a sudden vulnerability.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio just watched her, waiting, and Agatha realized she’d never felt quite so exposed and she wasn’t even the one
        naked this time.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio seemed to make the decision for her, closing the distance in one fluid motion.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio—
   <em>
    this fucking woman
   </em>
   —climbed into her lap, knees bracketing either side,
        her weight settling intimately against Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha barely managed to pull her hands free, instinctively finding Rio’s hips, her fingers curling the moment
        they touched her bare, warm skin. She felt the smoothness beneath her palms, grounding her, sparking something
        deep and electric inside her. Rio’s gaze stayed locked on hers, daring her, steadying her, as if reminding
        Agatha that she was exactly where she wanted her to be.
  </p>
<p>
   For a heartbeat, they stayed like that, Agatha’s pulse racing, her uncertainty dissolving as the reality of the
        situation pressed against her—
   <em>
    quite literally
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t lost on her that they were in the same position as before, but with the roles reversed.
  </p>
<p>
   Now Agatha was fully clothed, with a naked Rio in her lap.
  </p>
<p>
   She should feel powerful—and in some ways, she did. But that didn’t mean she held any true power.
  </p>
<p>
   She could see it in the way Rio looked down at her, the steady confidence in her gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha knew, even now, Rio was still holding all the cards.
  </p>
<p>
   Naked, exposed, vulnerable—none of it shook her control.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio wore it effortlessly.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk deepened, a spark of mischief in her eyes as she reached up, placing her hands on Agatha’s shoulders
        and sinking even further into her lap. She raised an eyebrow, a silent challenge that was unmistakable.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    You asked for it. Now, here I am,
   </em>
   her look seemed to say, daring Agatha to follow through.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s hands tightened instinctively on Rio’s hips, feeling the smooth warmth of her skin beneath her fingers.
        Every nerve in her body was on edge, every breath laced with anticipation, yet she couldn’t tear her gaze away
        from Rio’s.
  </p>
<p>
   That raised brow, the amused tilt of her lips—she was testing her, seeing just how far Agatha was willing to go.
  </p>
<p>
   Swallowing her hesitation, Agatha let her hand slide slowly upward, her fingers trailing over Rio’s ribs, feeling
        the slight shiver that followed her touch.
  </p>
<p>
   She noticed, with a thrill, the way Rio’s smirk wavered, just barely, as Agatha’s hand continued its ascent. She
        bypassed her breast—not quite ready to go there just yet—her fingers drifting higher, brushing along Rio’s
        collarbone, tracing up her neck, until her hand found its place behind Rio’s head. With a gentle but unyielding
        tug, she drew Rio forward.
  </p>
<p>
   To her surprise, Rio didn’t resist.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t make her ask.
  </p>
<p>
   She simply leaned in, meeting Agatha halfway, closing the distance with an easy confidence.
  </p>
<p>
   Their lips met, and Agatha felt everything else fade—the tension, the nerves, the unspoken power struggle—all of
        it dissolved in the warmth of Rio’s mouth.
  </p>
<p>
   Their kiss started slowly, unhurried, as if neither of them felt any need to rush. Agatha moved carefully, her
        initial hesitance mingling with a rising confidence. She felt Rio’s lips soft against hers, warm and inviting,
        but she could sense that Rio wasn’t about to push—she was letting Agatha take the lead, letting her set the
        pace.
  </p>
<p>
   It was as though Rio had thrown down the gauntlet, daring Agatha to make each choice deliberately,
   <em>
    intentionally
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly in Rio’s hair, pulling her closer as she deepened the kiss, savoring each
        delicate press, each slow shift of Rio’s mouth against hers.
  </p>
<p>
   It was electrifying, every second of it—this freedom to go slow, to let herself fully explore, to be the one in
        control.
  </p>
<p>
   And Rio, for her part, didn’t rush her, didn’t push forward, didn’t try to take control—
   <em>
    yet at least.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She let herself melt into Agatha’s touch, responding with quiet, patient intensity. Agatha felt Rio’s hand slide
        up her shoulder, resting lightly, a grounding presence that added to the quiet heat building between them.
  </p>
<p>
   With each gentle movement, Agatha felt the tension between them unwind, layer by layer.
  </p>
<p>
   She could feel the anticipation simmering below the surface, waiting,
  </p>
<p>
   They kissed for several more minutes, a slow burn that neither seemed in any hurry to rush.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s hand rested on Rio’s hip, feeling the warmth of her skin beneath her fingers, her thumb tracing idle
        circles as their mouths met and parted in a gentle, unhurried rhythm.
  </p>
<p>
   But then, as if sensing that Agatha was holding back, Rio shifted slightly.
  </p>
<p>
   Without breaking the kiss, she reached down, taking Agatha’s hand from her hip and guiding it up, higher, until
        it settled over her breast.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched at the contact, feeling the softness of Rio’s breast, and the way her nipple pressed
        against her palm.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s hand moved tentatively at first, her fingers tracing along the curves of Rio’s breast, feeling the
        warmth beneath her palm. She pressed slightly, experimenting, absorbing every subtle reaction, every slight gasp
        Rio let slip into her mouth. Each movement, each adjustment in her touch, was met with a soft, breathy sound
        from Rio, encouraging Agatha, guiding her without words.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t know how long she lost herself like this—exploring, tracing, learning the way Rio responded to her
        touch, the little shifts and sighs that told her she was doing something right.
  </p>
<p>
   But the heat inside her began to build, pooling low and insistent, curling tighter with each passing second.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, unable to resist any longer, Agatha pulled her mouth from Rio’s, breathing heavily as she looked down,
        taking in the sight of Rio’s bare skin, flushed and inviting.
  </p>
<p>
   In one swift, instinctive motion, she wrapped her arms more securely around Rio, pressing her close, before
        lowering her head and kissing her breast.
  </p>
<p>
   The softness, the warmth—it was intoxicating, and she let her lips explore, her mouth brushing over Rio’s skin,
        tasting, feeling the way Rio’s breath hitched and her hands tightened in Agatha’s hair.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips found Rio’s nipple, her tongue flicking over it as she felt Rio’s body respond, arching into
        Agatha’s lips.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse quickened at the sound of Rio’s voice—low, breathy, completely unrestrained.
  </p>
<p>
   “Fuck—yes,” Rio groaned, her hands weaving into Agatha’s hair, holding her in place. “Just like that.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words sent a bolt of heat through Agatha, and while she wasn’t surprised that Rio would be vocal, nothing had
        quite prepared her for just how
   <em>
    incredibly
   </em>
   hot it would be.
  </p>
<p>
   The way Rio urged her on, her voice rough and raw, added a new layer to the experience, fueling Agatha’s
        confidence.
  </p>
<p>
   Feeling emboldened, Agatha moved her mouth slowly, deliberately, taking her time as her lips and tongue traced
        across Rio’s breast, drawing out each gasp, each moan.
  </p>
<p>
   Every sound from Rio was its own reward, an intoxicating encouragement that left Agatha wanting to give her more,
        to push her further.
  </p>
<p>
   As Agatha continued, she felt Rio’s hands tighten in her hair, guiding her with the faintest pressure.
  </p>
<p>
   Then, Rio’s voice broke through, soft but unyielding.
  </p>
<p>
   “You can use your teeth... yeah, just like that,” she murmured, her voice low and rich, her breathing heavy.
  </p>
<p>
   “Fuck—
   <em>
    more
   </em>
   ,” she urged, her body responding instantly as Agatha followed her lead.
  </p>
<p>
   With each direction, each whispered command, Agatha could feel herself learning Rio’s playbook, discovering
        exactly what made her shiver, what made her exhale in those soft, breathless moans.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s hands and mouth obeyed, tracing every line, every curve as Rio’s body moved in rhythm with her, arching,
        trembling, giving her constant, subtle feedback.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes... that’s it,” Rio breathed, her voice dropping into something almost reverent.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio rolled her hips into Agatha and the movement jarred her enough to break her focus.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha looked up, caught in the intensity of Rio’s gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   What she saw took her breath away—Rio’s dark eyes watching her with a heat that was almost overwhelming, and the
        sight was so
   <em>
    incredibly
   </em>
   sexy.
  </p>
<p>
   The fairy lights above cast a soft halo around Rio, creating a stunning contrast against the darkness of her
        eyes. It highlighted every curve, every subtle movement, transforming the moment into something ethereal.
  </p>
<p>
   The way Rio looked at her, while sucking on her nipple, was intoxicating, and Agatha felt herself drawn deeper
        into the moment.
  </p>
<p>
   “God—you look so fucking good like this,” Rio growled, the words vibrating through Agatha and hitting her
        squarely in the chest.
  </p>
<p>
   The roughness of Rio’s voice sent a thrill coursing through her, igniting a fire of desire that pooled low in her
        belly. Agatha felt a rush of exhilaration at the compliment, each word wrapping around her, pulling her in
        closer.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a validation she didn’t know she craved, and it fueled her to explore further, to give Rio everything she
        had.
  </p>
<p>
   Before she could second-guess herself, Agatha slid her hand down Rio’s body, her eyes never leaving Rio’s face.
        She watched as Rio’s breath hitched, her chest rising and falling in anticipation with each inch that Agatha’s
        hand traveled lower, every moment stretched between them, taut and electric.
  </p>
<p>
   And then... Agatha touched her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s reaction was immediate, visceral. Her entire body tensed, a shudder rippling through her as she let out a
        low, throaty moan, her fingers clenching in Agatha’s hair. Agatha felt a surge of satisfaction at that response,
        feeling the heat of Rio’s desire in a way that was tangible, undeniable. She kept her touch gentle but firm,
        letting her fingers explore, learning every sensitive spot, every place that made Rio gasp or tremble.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s gaze remained locked on Rio’s face, savoring the way her expression shifted, how her eyes fluttered
        closed, only to reopen and meet Agatha’s gaze with a look of pure, unguarded need.
  </p>
<p>
   It was powerful, seeing Rio like this, feeling her react so openly to her touch.
  </p>
<p>
   With every small movement, every shift and stroke, Agatha felt her own confidence build, fueled by the sounds Rio
        made, by the way her body responded, arching, pressing closer, silently urging Agatha for more.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha continued exploring, her fingers moving with a newfound confidence, feeling every tremor that ran through
        Rio's body.
  </p>
<p>
   But then Rio’s hand joined her own, guiding her lower, pressing her fingers exactly where she wanted them. Rio’s
        lips brushed Agatha’s ear as she murmured.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Inside
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   The quiet command, coupled with the firm pressure of Rio’s hand over hers, gave Agatha the push she needed. She
        let her fingers slide inside, feeling the heat and tightness that greeted her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sucked in a sharp breath as Rio groaned, her body reacting instantly, pressing down, taking her fingers
        deeper.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Fuck.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It was warm.
  </p>
<p>
   Tight.
  </p>
<p>
   And—god, it felt so
   <em>
    right
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s hips rolled, grounding down on her hand, a loud, unabashed moan slipping from her lips. She reached up, her
        hands tangling in Agatha’s hair, pulling her into a kiss that was wild and searing—messy, all tongues and teeth,
        groans and gasps swallowed between them as Agatha moved her fingers in sync with the pace Rio set.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha curled her fingers experimentally, feeling the way Rio’s body responded, a deep, guttural moan escaping
        Rio as her mouth tore away from Agatha’s, breathless and unrestrained.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Fuck
   </em>
   —I knew you’d be like this,” Rio moaned into Agatha’s mouth, her voice thick and raw. “Feel this
        fucking good.”
  </p>
<p>
   Each word ignited something primal in Agatha, a heady combination of pride and desire that drove her movements
        further, each stroke and curl of her fingers pulling more gasps, more needy sounds from Rio. It was
        intoxicating, knowing she could unravel Rio like this, and she couldn’t get enough.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a delicate rhythm, one that Agatha quickly found herself lost in, letting herself be guided by Rio’s every
        reaction, her every whispered breath and trembling gasp.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha moved with purpose, her fingers thrusting deeper, harder, each movement answered by Rio’s hips meeting her
        hand with an intensity that left her breathless. Rio’s voice spilled out in between moans, her words low and
        rough, urging Agatha on, each phrase laced with heat.
  </p>
<p>
   "Yes, just like that... fuck. Don't stop," she gasped, her hands clutching Agatha’s shoulders, holding her close.
        "You feel so fucking good—just... keep going."
  </p>
<p>
   The encouragement, the way Rio’s body moved with her, spurred Agatha past any lingering hesitation, her fingers
        working tirelessly, even as the ache in her hand began to set in. She ground her palm against Rio’s clit,
        savoring the way Rio shuddered, her head falling back, lips parted, her breath coming out in broken moans.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    God, Agatha
   </em>
   ,” Rio groaned, her hips bucking harder, her body pressing down, desperate, every motion
        filled with raw, unrestrained need. Agatha felt the pressure build, felt the telltale tension in Rio’s body
        tightening, reaching that edge.
  </p>
<p>
   With a final curl of her fingers, angled just right, she felt Rio’s entire body seize, a strangled moan tearing
        from her throat as she tumbled over the edge. Agatha watched, captivated, as Rio unraveled in her arms, her own
        breath coming out in shallow pants, fingers still inside as Rio’s climax washed over her.
  </p>
<p>
   As Agatha held Rio, watching her slowly come down, her mind flickered back to something Rio had said before—how
        she’d thought Agatha would like fucking a woman, savoring the power that came with guiding someone over the
        edge.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could still hear those words, spoken with that knowing smirk, that casual confidence, as if Rio had seen
        straight through her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Agatha liked power.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio had known this instinctively.
  </p>
<p>
   And
   <em>
    god,
   </em>
   she had been right.
  </p>
<p>
   There was something undeniable, something electrifying, about the control she’d held, about being the one to
        unravel Rio, to push her into this state of pure plaesure.
  </p>
<p>
   Watching Rio surrender, feeling her responses, knowing she’d been the one to bring her there —it was
        intoxicating, a thrill that coursed through Agatha in waves.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s fingers traced gently along Rio’s side, her mind still reeling with the intensity of the experience.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn't just want to do it again; she’d craved it.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked up at Rio, her own heart still racing, and saw that same gleam of satisfaction in her eyes, as if Rio
        knew exactly what Agatha was thinking.
  </p>
<p>
   Like a drug, Agatha was was addicted.
  </p>
<p>
   Without hesitation, she reached up, grabbing Rio’s face and pulling her into a kiss that started as something
        fierce but softened unexpectedly, lingering for a moment before she pulled back, her voice a low murmur.
  </p>
<p>
   “Can you go again?” she asked, needing more, chasing the feeling, craving that rush of power again.
  </p>
<p>
   The words landed with a weight she could feel.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s body stilled for a second as she looked at her, studying her, and then, like one of the delicate flowers
        surrounding them, a slow, radiant smile spread across her face, unfurling petal by petal until it was in full
        bloom.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart lurched at the sight—
   <em>
    because Rio Vidal’s smile was so fucking beautiful
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   And it was in that moment, with Rio naked, in her arms, smiling in a way that was so genuine, so unguarded, that
        Agatha felt something shift inside her.
  </p>
<p>
   A quiet, undeniable realization settled over her, warm and unsettling all at once.
  </p>
<p>
   Because this wasn’t just attraction.
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t just the thrill of power or control, or the excitement of toeing the line without ever fully crossing
        it.
  </p>
<p>
   This was something deeper—
   <em>
    something more
   </em>
   —curling inside her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio Vidal had somehow reached inside her, and like the plants she nurtured so carefully, she’d taken root within
        Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   And as Rio’s fingers traced gently along her jaw, pulling her in for another kiss, Agatha felt that shift deep
        inside—a realization,
   <em>
    a vulnerability
   </em>
   she hadn’t anticipated.
  </p>
<p>
   Oh.
  </p>
<p>
   Fuck.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She was in trouble.
   </em>
</p>
<h1>
   Maiden, Mother, Crone
  </h1>
<p>
   Friday morning found Agatha at the office, a stack of papers in front of her and a headache building as she read
        through a brief one of the second-year associates had submitted. It was, without a doubt, garbage. She scribbled
        in red ink, her frustration mounting with each line, making a mental note that she’d have to seriously
        reconsider this associate’s future here.
  </p>
<p>
   Once she’d finished tearing it apart, she set the brief aside, spinning her chair to face the window. The city
        skyline stretched before her, a vast expanse of silver and glass that used to offer her a few precious moments
        to shut off her mind, to breathe and just
   <em>
    not think.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But now... every time she looked out at it, every time her mind drifted from work, like a rubber band, it snapped
        back to one thing.
  </p>
<p>
   One person.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   Which wouldn’t be a big deal if it were purely sexual.
  </p>
<p>
   If Agatha could limit her thoughts to all just Rio’s naked body pressed against hers, the way her hands and mouth
        ignited every nerve, the way Rio had a knack for pushing her past every comfort she thought she had, until
        Agatha found herself surrendering in ways she never imagined.
  </p>
<p>
   If it were just about the way Rio’s voice moaned in her ear, urging her on as Agatha touched her.
  </p>
<p>
   Or the way Rio tasted when Agatha finally worked up the courage to go down on her, the sounds she made, the way
        her fingers gripped Agatha’s hair, trembling under her touch.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could handle sexual.
  </p>
<p>
   Of course, it turned her on, leaving her part frustrated, part blissed-out mess, but that was fine —
   <em>
    just
            that.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Sexual.
  </p>
<p>
   People were sexual beings.
  </p>
<p>
   It was natural.
  </p>
<p>
   It was simple.
  </p>
<p>
   What wasn’t simple was the way her mind now replayed moments that had nothing to do with sex and everything to do
        with Rio herself.
  </p>
<p>
   She kept seeing the color of her eyes, dark and earthy, like rich soil, matching the plants surrounding Rio's
        home.
  </p>
<p>
   Or hearing Rio’s voice as she spoke Spanish, her tone lighter, her words flowing with an ease that Agatha could
        listen to all day without understanding a single word.
  </p>
<p>
   She remembered Rio’s laugh—
   <em>
    her real laugh
   </em>
   —and how it was, to her surprise, her favorite sound to come
        out of her mouth, more than any moan or whispered filth.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    And that damn smile
   </em>
   —the one Rio had given her, soft and naked in her lap, post-orgasm—
   <em>
    that
            smile
   </em>
   made Agatha’s heart stutter.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha knew exactly what it was, even if she refused to fully acknowledge it.
  </p>
<p>
   It was one thing to recognize that she was attracted to a woman. To let herself explore that attraction in the
        privacy of Rio’s capable hands, to indulge in the kind of intimacy that she always had always felt out of reach
        for her, reserved for someone else.
  </p>
<p>
   That was acceptable.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Hell—
   </em>
   even embracing this newfound pull toward dominance and submission—
   <em>
    especially
   </em>
   on the
        submissive end, which she never would have thought herself drawn to—was somehow manageable, almost freeing.
  </p>
<p>
   But developing actual... feelings?
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    No.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   That was something else entirely.
  </p>
<p>
   Feelings were messy, unpredictable, uncontrollable.
  </p>
<p>
   They tangled around reason and obscured lines.
  </p>
<p>
   And yet, she could feel them lurking, a nagging pull that had wrapped itself around her, subtle but insistent.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rule Number Four: Don’t fall in love with me.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio’s final rule echoed in her mind.
  </p>
<p>
   She remembered the way indignation had flared up when she’d first heard it, a mixture of disbelief and defiance.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had laughed.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Actually laughed.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The idea of her, Agatha Harkness, falling in love?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Ridiculous.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It had seemed so absurd, so unnecessary—Agatha couldn’t imagine herself
   <em>
    ever
   </em>
   doing that.
  </p>
<p>
   After all, she didn’t really believe in it.
  </p>
<p>
   Love was too messy, too chaotic, too unpredictable.
  </p>
<p>
   She had her life carefully mapped out, every choice measured and weighed.
  </p>
<p>
   Love simply just didn't fit into her life.
  </p>
<p>
   The only exception was Nicky, whom she loved fiercely, as any good mother would. She loved him with the kind of
        love that would make her step in front of a bus without a second thought, the kind of love that overruled logic
        and self-preservation.
  </p>
<p>
   But this?
  </p>
<p>
   This was different.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d cared,
   <em>
    somewhat
   </em>
   , for the people she’d been with over her lifetime, but the closest she’d ever
        come to love was with James—and look how that had turned out.
  </p>
<p>
   No—love wasn’t real.
  </p>
<p>
   Or if it was, it existed for everyone except her.
  </p>
<p>
   At that thought—her mother’s words echoed in her mind, sharp and relentless, clawing at her from the past. Words
        she hadn’t allowed herself to think of in years but that lingered, buried deep down inside her where old wounds
        lingered.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Something is wrong with you, Agatha. Inside. From the moment you clawed your way out of my body, I knew
            there was a darkness in you.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The venom in her mother’s voice still rang in her ears, filled with the kind of cruelty that still cut her to the
        core.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mother was to put it plainly—
   <em>
    a monster
   </em>
   —a religious hypocrite who spat vicious words like
        scripture, yet truly believed she’d secured a seat in heaven for herself by attending church three times a week.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s childhood had been a literal nightmare.
  </p>
<p>
   On the outside, their trailer had been well-kept, surrounded by carefully planted flowers, one of the nicest
        homes in the park. Her mother baked pies everyone adored, was the friendly teller at the local market, and, with
        the nearest ‘
   <em>
    doctor
   </em>
   ’ miles away, was regarded as the town healer. She knew every home remedy and folk
        cure and was the person people went to when they were sick or hurt.
  </p>
<p>
   Evanora Harkness was the town matriarch.
  </p>
<p>
   Respected.
  </p>
<p>
   Kind.
  </p>
<p>
   Loving.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    To everyone but Agatha.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Thousands of dollars of therapy, and Evanora Harkness still haunted her, like a ghost lurking in the shadows.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She was broken.
   </em>
<em>
    Incapable of loving anyone but herself—of putting someone else's needs above her own.
   </em>
<em>
    Agatha would always be selfish—cruel—unlovable.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   That is what her mother had said.
  </p>
<p>
   And yet, here she was, feeling things that skated dangerously close to something that felt suspiciously like—
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     No
    </em>
</strong>
<em>
    ,
   </em>
   she told herself firmly.
  </p>
<p>
   This wasn’t love.
  </p>
<p>
   This was sex, nothing more.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    That’s it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   A knock sounded on her door, snapping Agatha out of her thoughts.
  </p>
<p>
   She turned slightly,
   <em>
    and of course
   </em>
   , it was Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   She waved her in and shifted her chair to face her, giving her full attention.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio stepped inside, not saying a word, but Agatha had started to understand her body language.
  </p>
<p>
   She could tell—
   <em>
    just from the spark in Rio’s eyes
   </em>
   —that she was excited about something.
  </p>
<p>
   Today, Rio was wearing a light gray tailored pantsuit, complete with a vest and a skinny black tie, giving her a
        vintage edge that somehow looked devastatingly good. She stopped in front of Agatha’s desk, slipping her hands
        casually into her pockets, her stance confident, and then, as if to seal Agatha’s fate, Rio’s lips formed that
        rare, pleased smile—
   <em>
    the real one.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   That familiar curl of anticipation stirred in Agatha’s chest because Rio had this look for only two reasons:
        either when she was about to touch Agatha, savoring the thrill of destroying her, or when she’d found something
        substantial on the Vanguard case.
  </p>
<p>
   “I found something.
   <em>
    Something big
   </em>
   ,” Rio announced,
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha barely processed the words. That smile alone had her heart doing a frantic, unsteady rhythm in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Fuck, fuck, fuck.
   </em>
<em>
    No,
   </em>
   she scolded herself.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Stop that.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But her heart beat to its own rhythm, ignoring every command she tried to give it. She felt completely out of
        control, a sensation that only intensified as she saw Rio’s expression shift slightly, her eyes softening with
        worry.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha?” Rio’s voice was gentler now, pulling her out of her thoughts. “You good?” She asked, her tone dipping,
        genuinely concerned.
  </p>
<p>
   That only made Agatha’s heart race faster.
  </p>
<p>
   She gritted her teeth, keeping her expression impassive.
  </p>
<p>
   There was no way Rio could know what was happening to her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Hell
   </em>
   , Agatha didn’t even know what was happening to her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” she managed, finding her voice. “Tell me what you've found.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s worried expression lingered a moment longer, but she shifted back to professional, and Agatha felt her
        heart settle, though not completely.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let me show you,” Rio said, nodding back over her shoulder toward the war room.
  </p>
<p>
   With a nod, Agatha rose, hoping her face remained unreadable as she fell in step behind Rio, forcing herself to
        refocus on the case.
  </p>
<p>
   But as they walked out of her office, she couldn’t shake the unsettling feeling that her heart had slipped out of
        her chest and was trailing after Rio like a loyal dog on a leash, tugged along by some invisible thread that she
        couldn’t control.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha took a seat in the war room, her gaze sweeping over the space.
  </p>
<p>
   It had been nearly a week since she’d last been here, and she was stunned by the sheer amount of work Rio had
        completed in that short time.
  </p>
<p>
   A second whiteboard now stood next to the first, covered in lines and connections, as if tracing a web of hidden
        links. Stacks of paperwork, tabbed and labeled, covered the table, each pile organized with sticky notes marking
        exactly what they were.
  </p>
<p>
   On the second whiteboard, three faces stared back at her—three men, none of whom she recognized.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What the hell had she found?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio walked straight to the board with a glint in her eye, and turned to Agatha, diving right in.
  </p>
<p>
   "Vanguard isn’t dirty—the company itself, I mean," she explained. "For the most part, it’s clean: the books, the
        people, everything checks out. But these three?” she paused to indicate to the pictures with her hand. “They’re
        your dirt. These are the players."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha looked at the pictures for a moment, before turning back to Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   “Explain.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio pointed to the first man’s face on the board.
  </p>
<p>
   “Bad Guy #1:Brandon Vanguard, the grandson of the CEO and founder, William Vanguard. He’s technically listed as
        VP, but it’s purely a figurehead position. No real responsibility. Honestly, he’s a complete fuck-up—DUI
        arrests, drugs, barely scraped his way out of college. But his name and position alone gives him some authority
        in the company.”
  </p>
<p>
   She moved to the next man.
  </p>
<p>
   “Bad Guy #2:Harrison Smith. College roommate of none other than,” she paused before pointing back to the first
        picture, "Brandon Vanguard.”
  </p>
<p>
   She smirked as she started connecting the dots.
  </p>
<p>
   “Harrison, unlike Brandon, is actually smart. Comes from a middle-class family, no influential connections on his
        own. He works in logistics, and about five years ago, he was promoted to head of the department, thanks to his
        good buddy Brandon—despite there being far more qualified candidates.”
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, Rio pointed to the last man on the board, an older man with a severe expression.
  </p>
<p>
   “Bad Guy #3: James Hughes. Head of Security at Vanguard. Ex-military, special forces. He’s been all over the
        world, breaking up terrorist organizations, operating in covert ops. He has an intimate knowledge of how these
        organizations work, who the players are, and, most importantly, he knows the shipping lanes and paths closely
        monitored by the U.S. government. He knows the ports, the ins and outs of every security loophole—and how to get
        around them.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed as she took in the details, her mind racing.
  </p>
<p>
   “So, we have a figurehead with influence, a logistics head with access to everything that goes in and out, and a
        head of security with the knowledge to bypass military and port security?”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio nodded, loving that Agatha was following the bread trail se was leaving.
  </p>
<p>
   “Exactly. This trio creates the perfect storm. Individually, they’re scattered, inconspicuous even. But together?
        They’re capable of moving just about anything they want, completely off the radar.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha leaned forward, her eyes narrowing—seeing it, but she had to poke holes. If she didn’t the defense
        certainly would.
  </p>
<p>
   “Can you tie them together?”
  </p>
<p>
   Without a word, Rio moved to the table, picking up a thick stack of documents bound with tabs and sticky notes.
        She flipped through them until she landed on a page with highlighted sections, then held it out to Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “Take a look at this,” Rio said, her tone shifting to something like restrained excitement. “Financial records.
        Hughes has a bank account that’s linked to a series of shell companies— none of them under Vanguard’s official
        control, but all with quiet ties to their logistics chain. Harrison Smith authorizes the transactions, and
        Vanguard’s name lends them legitimacy.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio then pointed to another document—a shipping manifest.
  </p>
<p>
   “Here. These are shipments with items listed as ‘security hardware’ and ‘logistics supplies,’ on the
   <em>
    Meridian
            Star
   </em>
   authorized by Harrison but signed off by Hughes. And Brandon? He’s got his name on a series of
        transfers that look suspiciously like payments—probably to keep this under the radar.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha scanned the documents, her heart pounding as she realized what Rio had uncovered.
  </p>
<p>
   "So, they’re funding and moving...
   <em>
    something
   </em>
   . Under the guise of Vanguard’s operations.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio nodded, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
   “Likely weapons. And they’ve covered their tracks well enough that it only shows up in bits and pieces, but when
        you look at the whole picture...” She gestured to the whiteboards and stacks of paperwork.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha couldn’t help but feel a rush of admiration for Rio’s work.
  </p>
<p>
   This was meticulous, intelligent,
   <em>
    and dangerous
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   The whole web of deception that Agatha always knew was there was starting to unravel before her eyes, and she
        knew, with Rio by her side, they might just have the leverage they needed to take them down.
  </p>
<p>
   "Rio—this is really good," Agatha said, nearly speechless.
  </p>
<p>
   They had a case—
   <em>
    a real case
   </em>
   , with actual evidence.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio smiled at the compliment, and Agatha ignored the familiar lurch in her chest at the sight.
  </p>
<p>
   But then Rio’s expression shifted, the brightness dimming into something serious, almost cautious—and Agatha
        immediately picked up on it.
  </p>
<p>
   “I have one more thing,” Rio said, her tone darkening.
  </p>
<p>
   The sudden gravity in her voice set Agatha on edge.
  </p>
<p>
   “Show me.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio nodded, moving to her laptop. After a few clicks, she turned the screen toward Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   A CCTV video filled the display—black and white, nighttime footage of a quiet street. Agatha could make out cars
        parked along the curb, a few passing pedestrians, a couple of people walking down the sidewalk.
  </p>
<p>
   “What is this?” she asked.
  </p>
<p>
   “This is CCTV footage from a convenience store on Brooke Sinclair’s street,” Rio explained. “The police ruled her
        death a suicide, so they never pulled the footage. But the store owner was willing to share it. He liked Brooke.
        Her house is out of frame, but this is her street.”
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay?” Agatha replied, still unsure where this was going.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio pointed at a car parked on the left side of the screen.
  </p>
<p>
   “Look at that car.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed as she focused on it—a black Cadillac. It didn’t seem unusual. Brooke was well-paid, and
        nice cars on her street wouldn’t raise suspicion. She shot Rio a look, urging her to get on with it.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio pressed a button, shifting to view after view, as time stamps flew by indicating different days.
  </p>
<p>
   “That car—same license plate—was parked on Brooke’s street every night for four days before her death. Same spot,
        every time. And it hasn’t been back since.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s brows knitted together.
  </p>
<p>
   “Suspicious, but random cars on New York streets aren’t exactly rare.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio nodded, acknowledging her point, but then clicked to change the timestamp in the corner to the night Brooke
        died.
  </p>
<p>
   “Watch the car.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha did, eyes trained on the Cadillac as the seconds ticked by. Nothing happened at first, and just as
        frustration began to creep in, the driver’s door opened, and a shadowed figure stepped out. The quality was
        poor, and the figure was a murky silhouette, nearly indiscernible.
  </p>
<p>
   But as they walked down the street, they passed under a streetlight, casting their face briefly into clarity.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio paused the footage, and Agatha’s breath caught.
  </p>
<p>
   It was James Hughes.
  </p>
<p>
   They had actual evidence that Vanguard’s Head of Security was seen on Brooke Sinclair’s street the night she
        died.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Holy fuck.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She did it.
  </p>
<p>
   She actually did it.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn't just build a case—
   <em>
    she built a case that Agatha could actually win.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha looked up at Rio, feeling the shock written all over her face.
  </p>
<p>
   “Rio... this...” she started, her voice barely above a whisper, as if the magnitude of what Rio had done was
        almost too much to believe.
  </p>
<p>
   “It’s what you needed, right?” Rio replied, stepping forward, her confidence radiating in a way that was
        undeniably magnetic.
  </p>
<p>
   She stopped just in front of Agatha, her eyes gleaming with pride.
  </p>
<p>
   “Does this mean we can go to trial?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha rose from her seat, meeting Rio’s gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   “We can go to trial,” she echoed, the words seeming to hang in the air between them.
  </p>
<p>
   A smile broke across Rio’s face, bright and unguarded, and it was
   <em>
    beautiful.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   And Agatha hated the way her heart lurched at the sight.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha rode the high of their breakthrough well into the afternoon. She’d tasked Rio with securing affidavits
        from every source where key pieces of evidence had been gathered, and once she had those in hand, she’d be ready
        to submit the paperwork to the judge. It was on her mind all day, and she was almost grateful for the
        distraction. The thrill of finally taking down her white whale helped temper the edges of her unexpected—
   <em>
    and still very much unacknowledged
   </em>
   —feelings for Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   A few client meetings took her out of the office, and by the time she returned, the workday was nearly over.
        Knowing Rio, she expected to find the affidavits already finished and waiting neatly on her desk.
  </p>
<p>
   As she stepped off the elevator, a giddy excitement buzzed within her, the familiar rush that always came before
        a trial. Only this time, it was heightened because this case was poised to be the biggest of her career, a
        game-changer.
  </p>
<p>
   She took a step into the office, ready to dive into the paperwork, when she stopped dead in her tracks.
  </p>
<p>
   Billy was standing by her office door, posture stiff, eyes wide with a rare kind of anxiousness she thought she’d
        trained out of him by now.
  </p>
<p>
   “What?” she snapped, feeling an unsettling weight settle in her stomach.
  </p>
<p>
   “There’s... a new security officer downstairs—he didn’t know,” Billy stammered.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, not understanding a word of his cryptic explanation.
  </p>
<p>
   “Speak plainly, pet,” she demanded, her patience already thinning.
  </p>
<p>
   Billy swallowed hard, his eyes darting to the floor.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your mother,” he said, wincing as if he already expected the fallout. “Your mother is in your office.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words landed like a punch and Agatha went cold.
  </p>
<p>
   What?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    No.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She had cut her mother off completely when Nicky was born.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d made a deliberate choice to keep Evanora Harkness far, far away from her life. This especially rang true
        when Nicky was born. She refused to let her mother’s toxicity seep into his life the way it had poisoned hers.
        It was rule number one in the Assistant’s Handbook: Evanora Harkness was never to be in contact with Agatha—not
        a phone call, not an email, and
   <em>
    certainly
   </em>
   never in the damn building.
  </p>
<p>
   “What?” she whispered, her voice deadly quiet, every nerve in her body coming alive.
  </p>
<p>
   Billy flinched, visibly regretting every second of this as he stammered out his words at a rapid pace.
  </p>
<p>
   “I was making copies, and she... she was just there. I didn’t know what to do. She refused to leave, and I didn’t
        want to call security and make a scene. I’m sorry—”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha held up a hand, silencing him.
  </p>
<p>
   She hadn’t thought of her mother in years. And of course, the day she actually gives her a single thought—it was
        like she somehow summoned her from whatever hell she lived in now to Agatha’s life.
  </p>
<p>
   For a split second, she considered turning around, walking out the door, and leaving her mother sitting there
        waiting. But then a sharper thought came to her. She had never backed down from a fight, and leaving now would
        mean surrendering her power to that woman.
  </p>
<p>
   And she wasn’t a child anymore; she wasn’t under Evanora’s control.
  </p>
<p>
   Evanora Harkness didn’t get to hold power over her.
  </p>
<p>
   Not anymore.
  </p>
<p>
   Thankfully, the office was beginning to empty as she made her way down the hall, which meant fewer eyes on her—or
        whatever was about to unfold in her office.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mother was... unpredictable.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha was unpredictable, too, but hers was a calculated kind, honed to her advantage.
  </p>
<p>
   Evanora, however, was unpredictable like a spark near gasoline—volatile, with a destructive potential.
  </p>
<p>
   And based on past experience, Agatha was always the one who got burned worst.
  </p>
<p>
   She strode purposefully toward her office, passing the war room, catching a glimpse of Rio typing on her laptop.
        Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Rio’s gaze snap up, her eyes locking onto Agatha, narrowing as if
        immediately sensing the tension radiating from her.
  </p>
<p>
   Either Agatha looked as unsettled as she felt, or Rio was getting far too good at reading her.
  </p>
<p>
   But Agatha didn’t stop. She couldn’t because if she did stop, she didn’t know if she could continue walking
        again.
  </p>
<p>
   She reached her office, taking a deep breath before entering.
  </p>
<p>
   She caught sight of her mother out of the corner of her eye, seated on the couch like she owned the damn place.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha refused to acknowledge her presence, not yet. She needed to treat this like a client negotiation, like a
        high-stakes game.
  </p>
<p>
   She needed to be sharp, unreadable—she needed to win, for the sake of her soul.
  </p>
<p>
   Moving to her desk, she could feel Evanora’s eyes on her, scrutinizing, waiting.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sat down, finally lifting her gaze to look at her mother, studying the face she hadn’t seen in over twenty
        years. The last time had been at her law school graduation, when she’d told Evanora she was moving to New York
        and wasn’t coming back.
  </p>
<p>
   Evanora to put it lightly was pissed.
  </p>
<p>
   New York, in her opinion, was a “
   <em>
    cesspool of godless heathens
   </em>
   ,” a place where only the lost and the
        damned could thrive.
  </p>
<p>
   The fact that Agatha thrived here was all Evanora needed to prove that she was right, that Agatha was everything
        she always said she was.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mother looked older, of course, but that severity in her eyes hadn’t softened a bit. The lines around her
        mouth had deepened, making her look even more disapproving. She sat primly on the couch, her hands folded in her
        lap, taking in the office like the very air offended her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha,” she said, her voice as cold as ever, drawing out the name with that same familiar bite.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha met her gaze evenly, refusing to let a single flicker of discomfort show.
  </p>
<p>
   “Hi Mom. What are you doing here?” Her tone was professional, indifferent—she hoped impenetrable.
  </p>
<p>
   Evanora’s eyes narrowed.
  </p>
<p>
   “I was in the city for a church conference. Thought it would be...
   <em>
    appropriate
   </em>
   to stop by and see how my
        daughter is faring in this den of vice.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her voice dripped with the kind of sanctimonious condescension Agatha had long ago learned to ignore.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well, as you can see,” Agatha replied coolly, gesturing around her with a smirk, “I’m faring quite well.”
  </p>
<p>
   A faint, disapproving smirk tugged at the corner of Evanora’s mouth.
  </p>
<p>
   “Are you?” she asked, looking around the office, taking in the luxury with a raised brow. “Still chasing power
        and money, I see. Still choosing darkness over light.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes, keeping her face impassive.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m choosing a career that I’ve built on my own terms,” Agatha replied, her voice carefully measured. “I don’t
        think that qualifies as ‘darkness.’”
  </p>
<p>
   Evanora shook her head slowly, a look of deep disappointment settling on her face. The gesture was painfully
        familiar, a move that Agatha had learned to brace herself against, even as a child.
  </p>
<p>
   “A career,” Evanora echoed, drawing out the word with a heavy layer of scorn. “And what good is that? Does it
        soothe the emptiness inside you? Because I can see it, Agatha. No matter how much you have, you’re still hollow,
        rotten to the core, just like everything you touch.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words sliced through Agatha, landing with brutal accuracy, but she bit back a response, refusing to let the
        hurt show. She knew Evanora wanted to see her flinch, to see the words sink in and take root.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t going to give her the satisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
   “If you’re here to judge, save your breath,” she replied, her tone icy. “You’ll find that I still don’t care
        about your approval.”
  </p>
<p>
   Evanora’s lips twisted into a smirk, her eyes gleaming with something dark, something almost triumphant.
  </p>
<p>
   “No, I’m sure you don’t,” she said, her voice low, dripping with cruelty. “But it’s not about my approval, is it?
        It’s about the truth. You can pretend all you want, but that darkness inside you, that rot? It seeps into
        everything you touch.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt the words like a weight settling over her, pressing against old insecurities, old doubts.
  </p>
<p>
   Evanora’s gaze was piercing, her expression cold and unyielding, and she held her pause deliberately, savoring
        the tension.
  </p>
<p>
   “I worry for that poor boy you’re raising,” she continued, her voice softening, adopting a feigned look of
        concern that only deepened the cruelty behind her words. “Nicholas, isn’t it?”
  </p>
<p>
   Her mother’s words landed like a knife to the chest.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt her control slipping, a hot wave of anger and protectiveness rising in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Leave Nicky out of this.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But Evanora’s smirk only grew wider, her satisfaction intensifying as she pressed forward.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, I wish I could. But if he came from you... well, rot has a way of spreading.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words hit Agatha like a punch to the chest, but Evanora wasn’t finished. Seeing the crack in her daughter’s
        composure, she went for the heart—
   <em>
    like she always did.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “I heard he was sick a few years back,” she continued, her tone almost mocking, the faintest hint of feigned
        sympathy twisting her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   Each word hit Agatha like a lash, dragging up pain she’d buried so deep she almost believed it couldn’t touch her
        anymore.
  </p>
<p>
   But as Evanora’s voice twisted into that mocking, feigned sympathy, Agatha felt old scars splitting open, raw and
        bleeding. Her mother’s words seeped into her like poison, feeding on every doubt and fear she’d worked so hard
        to silence.
  </p>
<p>
   “Cancer, wasn’t it?” Evanora’s tone dripped with faux concern, and Agatha’s stomach twisted violently, a familiar
        sickness creeping up her spine.
  </p>
<p>
   She fought to keep her composure, but it was like she was a child again, helpless under her mother’s scrutiny,
        feeling like a mistake, a failure in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   Her throat tightened, and for a moment, she couldn’t breathe.
  </p>
<p>
   She remembered the sleepless nights by Nicky’s bedside, the prayers she’d whispered to her mother’s all-powerful
        god, desperate, terrified he wouldn’t survive.
  </p>
<p>
   And now, hearing Evanora spin that agony into something ugly,
   <em>
    something hateful
   </em>
   —she could feel her
        heart breaking all over again.
  </p>
<p>
   “Tell me, Agatha,” her mother’s voice slithered into her thoughts, prying at her worst fears, “did it ever occur
        to you that perhaps God was punishing you through him?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s chest tightened, and her vision blurred. The suggestion pierced through her, flooding her mind with
        every terrible thought she’d had, every moment she’d doubted herself, every time she’d feared she wasn’t good
        enough for Nicky.
  </p>
<p>
   “Maybe it would have been better if you’d just let that illness take him,” Evanora whispered, her voice twisting
        around Agatha like a serpent, squeezing tighter, mocking her deepest love, her most fragile place. “While he was
        still innocent, while he still had a place in heaven.”
  </p>
<p>
   It was cruel, beyond anything Agatha could have prepared for, and she felt the old wounds of her childhood
        reopening, the shame, the fear, the awful feeling that maybe her mother had been right all along.That she was
        cursed, destined only to bring ruin to those she loved.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breaths turned shallow, and she could feel the cracks forming, her carefully constructed armor that
        years of therapy helped her build were now splintering under the weight of her mother’s words.
  </p>
<p>
   “He still has a chance at salvation, Agatha,” Evanora continued, her voice softening to a mockery of gentleness,
        each word deliberately placed to hurt. “A chance to escape this life you’ve built. But you couldn’t even let him
        have that. No, you had to drag him into this sin with you, to share in the rot you’ve let fester.”
  </p>
<p>
   She leaned forward, eyes narrowing with vicious satisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
   “One day, he’ll be just like you. Hollow. Godless.
   <em>
    Destined for ruin.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   The words seared into Agatha’s mind, reigniting every terrible thought she’d had in the darkest hours of the
        night. That she’d tainted Nicky, that maybe she was unfit to be his mother, that her own brokenness was a curse
        she’d unknowingly passed on to him. She could feel Evanora’s gaze, cold and dissecting, peeling away her
        defenses until she was exposed, vulnerable, the child she’d been, desperate for a love that was never given.
  </p>
<p>
   But there was a difference now. Agatha wasn’t that child anymore. Her mother’s cruelty couldn’t own her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw tightened, and she forced herself to meet Evanora’s gaze, letting the simmering anger take root,
        filling the hollow ache her mother’s words had left behind.
  </p>
<p>
   She released her grip on her hands, feeling the sting of her nails in her palms.
  </p>
<p>
   “Get out,” she said, her voice steady, steely.
  </p>
<p>
   There was no tremor, no weakness in her tone, even though it raged through her body.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “And don’t ever come back.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   A flicker of irritation crossed Evanora’s face, but she masked it quickly, rising from her seat with a stiff,
        disdainful elegance, as if leaving were her choice.
  </p>
<p>
   She adjusted her coat, casting Agatha one final look of pure scorn.
  </p>
<p>
   “Enjoy your hollow little kingdom, Agatha,” she sneered, her voice dripping with contempt. “It will crumble. And
        when it does, there will be nothing left of you—
   <em>
    or the boy
   </em>
   . I am done praying for you. Let the devil
        take you. It is where you belong."
  </p>
<p>
   As the door closed behind her mother, Agatha felt her heart pounding, each beat like a heavy drum in her chest.
        Old wounds reopened, raw and aching, spilling over with pain she thought she’d conquered long ago. A wave of
        helplessness surged within her, her breaths coming in shallow, shaky bursts as her mother’s words circled in her
        mind, taunting her, gnawing at her deepest insecurities.
  </p>
<p>
   She blinked back tears, her vision blurring with frustration.
  </p>
<p>
   She was forty-eight years old.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Forty-eight
   </em>
   , and still, her mother’s words could reach inside her and twist, leaving her feeling
        stripped bare, exposed, like a frightened child.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She hated it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She hated that her mother still had this power over her.
  </p>
<p>
   Hated herself for letting it happen.
  </p>
<p>
   Suddenly, her office felt small, suffocating.
  </p>
<p>
   The air felt thick, pressing down on her, and she couldn’t bear another moment in this room where her mother’s
        presence still lingered. She needed to escape, to get away from the walls that felt as though they were closing
        in on her.
  </p>
<p>
   Without another thought, she headed for the door, moving quickly, her heels striking the floor in hard,
        purposeful steps.
  </p>
<p>
   She barely registered Rio calling her name, her voice edged with concern, but Agatha didn’t stop.
  </p>
<p>
   She couldn’t hear anything but her mother’s voice, those words echoing in her mind, haunting her, pulling her
        under.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha clung to Nicky the moment she got home. He seemed to sense that something was off, that she needed this,
        and he didn’t pull away. Instead, he leaned into her, letting her hold
  </p>
<p>
   him, allowing her to be close in a way she hadn’t needed to be since he was sick.
  </p>
<p>
   Since she’d walked through the door, a single phrase had been running through her mind like a mantra, grounding
        her.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    I am a good mother.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She kissed Nicky’s forehead.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    I am a good mother.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She helped him with his homework, patiently going through each problem.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    I am a good mother.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She read him
   <em>
    Harry Potter
   </em>
   , her voice shifting for each character, drawing giggles from him when she
        exaggerated Hagrid’s deep gruff tone.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    I am a good mother.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She stayed with him long after he’d fallen asleep, fingers stroking his hair, feeling his small, steady breaths
        beneath her hand.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    I am a good mother.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It had been a long time since she’d stayed the night in his bed. Not since the days he’d been sick, when she
        couldn’t bring herself to leave his side.
  </p>
<p>
   Now, here she was, curled up in his Buzz Lightyear bed, cramped and uncomfortable, yet unwilling to move,
        unwilling to let him go. The tightness in her chest slowly began to ease, soothed by the gentle rise and fall of
        his breathing.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    I am a good mother,
   </em>
   she told herself again, her fingers brushing gently over Nicky’s cheek.
  </p>
<p>
   And in the quiet of his room, she almost believed it.
  </p>
<p>
   Tears spilled down her face, and she quickly wiped them away, careful not to let them fall onto him.
  </p>
<p>
   Her phone vibrated in her pocket, the suddenness breaking the silence. She pulled it out, blinking back the last
        of her tears to read the message.
  </p>
<p>
   It was from Rio.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     Are you okay?
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha sucked in a breath, feeling the words catch in her throat.
  </p>
<p>
   She started to type, her fingers moving and typing out instinctively:
   <em>
    I’m fine.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But she hesitated before hitting send, staring at the words.
  </p>
<p>
   They felt hollow, too much like the carefully constructed lie she told the world.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t fine.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mother had left her feeling shattered, vulnerable in a way she despised. Evanora had done what she always
        did—cut her down, left her questioning everything she’d fought to believe in herself.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha deleted the message, her thumb hovering over the screen as she considered what to say.
  </p>
<p>
   After a long pause, she finally typed, and before she could second-guess it, she hit send.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     No.
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   She watched as the message was delivered, the one word carrying a surprising vulnerability that Agatha had never
        really shared with someone before.
  </p>
<p>
   A moment later, her phone vibrated again. Rio’s response was swift, almost as if she’d been waiting, and her
        words made something tighten in Agatha’s chest.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     What do you need?
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha stared at the screen, her heart pounding as she read the message over and over, feeling the weight of the
        question. It was so simple, yet so open—a lifeline she hadn’t expected.
  </p>
<p>
   Her fingers hovered, hesitant. She wasn’t used to being asked this, to having someone who genuinely wanted to
        know. The urge to reply warred with the fear of vulnerability, of letting someone see the cracks she worked so
        hard to keep hidden.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, she took a shaky breath and typed.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     Got any remedies for unresolved childhood trauma and a mother straight from hell?
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   It was honest, with just enough bite to mask the rawness beneath.
  </p>
<p>
   Her phone buzzed again, and Rio’s reply flashed on the screen.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     Maybe.
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   A second later, another message came through.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
     Come open your front door and find out.
    </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart skipped. She gently untangled herself from Nicky, quietly padding out of his room, closing the
        door softly behind her. She made her way to the front door, hesitating just a moment before peeking through the
        peephole.
  </p>
<p>
   Sure enough, there she was—Rio, standing outside, arms crossed, her expression unreadable.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha opened the door, a mix of surprise and relief tightening in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio stood outside her door, wearing sweatpants and orange faded Texas Longhorn hoodie.
  </p>
<p>
   “What are you doing here?” Agatha asked confused.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio looked her, her gaze locking in on Agatha’s face, no doubt noticing the red eyes and tear stains.
  </p>
<p>
   “I was worried about you.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha shifted, her voice coming out sharper than she intended.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m fine.”
  </p>
<p>
   “No, you’re not.” Rio’s response was calm, cutting right through the façade with a simplicity that left Agatha
        feeling raw and exposed.
  </p>
<p>
   She swallowed hard, feeling the words catch in her throat. She didn’t know how Rio always managed to see her so
        clearly, to slice through every wall she put up.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let me in,” Rio said, her tone gentle but firm.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath shook.
  </p>
<p>
   Her first instinct was to say no, to shut this down, to send Rio away before she let herself fall apart any
        further.
  </p>
<p>
   “My son is home,” she whispered, her voice barely above a murmur. “And I’m not... I’m not in the mood.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio held her gaze, unrelenting, her eyes locked on Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   "Let me in anyways."
  </p>
<p>
   There was something in Rio's tone, a calm insistence that made Agatha's resistance crack.
  </p>
<p>
   It felt like more than just a request to step inside her home—it felt like a request to step inside Agatha,
        beyond her walls—to let Rio in.
  </p>
<p>
   And after a long, hesitant pause filled with want and fears battling within her, Agatha stepped aside, allowing
        Rio to enter.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t sure what to expect when Rio stepped into her home.
  </p>
<p>
   But what she certainly didn’t expect was for Rio to walk in, kick off her worn tennis shoes, and head deeper into
        the house without a word—as if she already had a plan in mind.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha opened her mouth, ready to demand what the hell Rio thought she was doing, but the thought of waking Nicky
        stopped her.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, she just followed, her curiosity and frustration growing with each step.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha trailed Rio down the hallway, passing Nicky’s door and continuing to the very end of the hall—to Agatha’s
        room.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio didn’t hesitate for a second. She turned the doorknob and walked right in.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha paused, staring at her open bedroom door, completely thrown by Rio’s audacity—the sheer gall of the woman.
  </p>
<p>
   A surge of irritation and disbelief moved her feet faster, ready to confront Rio about whatever bold assumption
        she was acting on.
  </p>
<p>
   But when Agatha stepped into her bedroom, she found it empty.
  </p>
<p>
   Confused, she looked around, her brow furrowed.
  </p>
<p>
   And then she heard it—the sound of running water.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned her head toward the master bathroom, the door slightly ajar.
  </p>
<p>
   She stared at it, baffled.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What the hell was she doing?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha stormed toward the bathroom, her mind set on calling Rio out, on demanding to know just what she thought
        she was doing. But as she stepped through the doorway, the words froze on her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   There was Rio, kneeling in front of the free standing bathtub, her hand testing the water. She reached up,
        grabbed one of the bottles on the shelf, poured a small amount into the water, and carefully placed it back
        where it belonged.
  </p>
<p>
   Immediately, the scent of lavender filled the air, soothing and familiar.
  </p>
<p>
   For a moment, Agatha could only stand there, watching Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   She hadn’t expected this.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She didn’t even know what to do with this.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio tested the water once more, making a small adjustment before turning to face her fully. She held Agatha’s
        gaze in that steady, grounding way of hers, then extended her hand.
  </p>
<p>
   “Come here.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed, her feet rooted to the spot, an unspoken tension tightening in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyes softened at Agatha's hesitation, and she took a step closer, her hand still outstretched.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Agatha
   </em>
   ,” she said again, her voice gentler this time, “please... come here.”
  </p>
<p>
   The word
   <em>
    please
   </em>
   landed with surprising weight, sending a rush of warmth through her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt her chest tighten further, the smallest crack forming in her resolve, and before she could stop
        herself, she took a step forward, reaching out and slipping her hand into Rio’s.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio pulled her closer, before moving her hand moved up to cup Agatha’s cheek, her thumb brushing softly against
        her skin, as if she could wipe away the lingering traces of tears that had long since dried. Her touch was so
        gentle, so full of unspoken understanding, that it made something fragile and unguarded stir within Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Without a word, Rio’s hands moved lower, her fingers reaching the top button of Agatha’s silk blouse. She undid
        it with the same care, slowly working her way down, each movement respectful, unhurried. There was no intent
        beyond tenderness, no motive beyond offering a moment of comfort.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse quickened, not from desire but from the overwhelming unfamiliarity of being handled so carefully,
        as if she were something precious. It felt strange to be stripped bare this way, emotionally and physically,
        without the barriers she so often clung to.
  </p>
<p>
   And yet, she didn’t resist.
  </p>
<p>
   She allowed Rio to gently peel away the layers, until she stood bare in front of her, exposed but somehow not
        vulnerable.
  </p>
<p>
   When Agatha was free of her clothes, Rio held out her hand again, guiding her to the edge of the tub. She helped
        her step into the warm water, steadying her as she sank down, feeling the soothing embrace of the
        lavender-scented bath.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio gave a small, knowing smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “Can I trust you not to drown yourself in there?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha managed a weak chuckle, the unexpected question disarming her enough to respond honestly.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m not suicidal... just sad.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words slipped out, surprising them both, a small truth admitted in the quiet safety of the moment.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s face softened, a sadness in her gaze that mirrored Agatha’s own, and she leaned down, pressing a gentle
        kiss to Agatha’s brow. The tenderness of it left Agatha feeling as if she’d been held, if only for a heartbeat.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good night, Agatha,” Rio murmured softly against her skin, straightening and preparing to leave.
  </p>
<p>
   But as Rio pulled back, a hollow feeling surged in Agatha’s chest, filling the space where Rio’s touch had been.
        She closed her eyes, a sudden panic tightening her throat of being left
  </p>
<p>
   alone, and before she could second-guess herself, her hand shot up from the water, fingers closing around Rio’s
        wrist.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio stopped, looking down at her, a flicker of surprise in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “Don’t leave,” Agatha whispered, her voice barely audible.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio hesitated, her gaze lingering on Agatha’s face as if searching for an answer she wasn’t certain of.
  </p>
<p>
   Then, with a quiet resolve, she pulled her hand away and reached under her hoodie, slipping it off, stripping
        away her layers one by one. Her eyes stayed locked on Agatha, steady and unwavering, as she undressed until
        there was nothing left between them.
  </p>
<p>
   Without a word, she moved forward, placing a gentle hand on Agatha’s shoulder, a gesture for her to shift forward
        in the water.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha did, her pulse racing.
  </p>
<p>
   She felt the warmth of Rio’s body as she lowered herself into the bath behind her, settling into the water. And
        then, without hesitation, Rio’s arms wrapped around her, pulling her back until Agatha was nestled against her,
        the weight of her hands resting protectively around her middle.
  </p>
<p>
   As Agatha sank back into Rio’s embrace, a surprising surge of emotion unfurled in her chest, warm and unexpected.
  </p>
<p>
   The simple act of being held like this—
   <em>
    of being cared for so completely
   </em>
   —was unlike anything she’d
        allowed herself to experience in a very long time, if ever. She had built her life on self-reliance, on walls so
        carefully constructed that even moments of closeness felt foreign, almost forbidden.
  </p>
<p>
   But here, with Rio’s arms wrapped around her, those walls felt softer, less necessary. The warmth of Rio’s body,
        the steady beat of her heart against Agatha’s back, and the quiet weight of her hands resting protectively
        around her were somehow exactly what she needed, even if she hadn’t known it.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, as soft as a whisper, she felt Rio’s lips brush against her shoulder, and then her neck. The kisses
        weren’t charged with desire; they were something else entirely—
   <em>
    gentle
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   A new wave of tears began to slip down her face, fast and unstoppable.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t even sure what she was crying about anymore—the wounds her mother’s words had reopened, the pain of
        years of self-imposed isolation, or maybe the overwhelming feeling of safety that being held like this brought
        her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s arms tightened just slightly knowing she was crying, her presence steady and unwavering, as if telling
        Agatha without words that she was safe here, that she didn’t have to hold everything together on her own.
  </p>
<p>
   And for the first time in her entire life, Agatha let herself believe it.
  </p>

   Chapter Summary
   <p>
    There are multiple moments in this chapter that literally had me kicking my feet smiling. I hope you guys enjoy those moments as much as I enjoyed writing it.
   </p>
<p>
    Also I went back and renamed the lawyers of the Salem Seven to be clever. I introduced them first in Chapter 4.
   </p>
<p>
    I have renamed them to: Fox, Ratcliff, Coyotl, Wise, Crow, Orm, and Swarmen. (Fox, Rat, Coyote, Owl, Crow, Snake and Bugs)
   </p>
<p>
    Also I can't stress this enough, I am not a lawyer or work in the law. So I don't know if what I am writing is accurate. I took some moments, lines, and dialogue from some of more favorite law/cop tv shows and movies to try and mimic what a case at least on the tv looks like. I know it's not accurate, but I think it paints a decent picture.
   </p>
<p>
    Also, I know I have been cranking out these chapters. I don't know how long I can keep pace. I've been really slow at work and have been writing for like 6-8 hours a day lately. Eventually I will have to return to reality, and updates may slow.
   </p>
<p>
    Thanks for sticking with me.
   </p>
<p>
    Enjoy.

<p>
   Agatha’s mind was back in her bathtub, to the way she’d crumbled in Rio’s arms. Her tears had fallen from her
        eyes, and with each drop, she’d felt the weight of years of pain begin to surface, like a countdown, ticking
        toward the inevitable.
  </p>
<p>
   And then, finally, she couldn’t hold back anymore.
  </p>
<p>
   The tears had reshaped into deep, wrenching sobs—sounds she barely recognized as her own —broken and raw,
        spilling from her mouth no matter how she tried to choke them back.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d tried to muffle them, bringing her hand to her mouth as if that could somehow contain it all, as if she
        could silence the flood of sorrow and rage and fear that surged up from somewhere deep in her soul.
  </p>
<p>
   But there was no stopping it.
  </p>
<p>
   The sobs—they just kept coming, tearing through her, each one leaving her feeling more wrecked, more stripped of
        the carefully constructed sense of self she had worn for so long.
  </p>
<p>
   It was one thing to break down; she hadn’t truly done it in years, not since Nicky had been sick.
  </p>
<p>
   And even before that, crying was something she avoided, something she despised.
  </p>
<p>
   She hated the feeling of vulnerability it left in its wake, the way it made her feel exposed raw. It was like
        ever nerve was exposed—every insecurity she’d buried beneath her carefully crafted armor.
  </p>
<p>
   She had always bottled it up, pushing it down because to her, tears meant weakness, and weakness was something
        she could never allow herself.
  </p>
<p>
   Not even in private.
  </p>
<p>
   But to break down like that in front of Rio...
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could still feel the warmth of Rio’s arms around her, steady and grounding as she came undone. Rio hadn’t
        flinched, hadn’t looked away, hadn’t let go. She’d simply stayed there, holding Agatha as pain poured out, raw
        and unchecked.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s lips had brushed softly over her shoulder, her neck, murmuring gentle, soothing words into her skin.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “It’s okay.”
   </em>
<em>
    “I’ve got you.”
   </em>
<em>
    “It’s okay.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She repeated the words like a mantra, each one sealed with a tender kiss, as if she could somehow mend the
        fractures with nothing more than her voice and touch. Each kiss, each whispered reassurance felt like Rio was
        trying to fill the cracks in Agatha’s heart, slowly and carefully, as if piecing her back together with a
        gentleness Agatha hadn’t known she craved.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio drew Agatha even closer, wrapping her arms around her fully and reaching down to take Agatha’s hand, cradling
        it against her own at Agatha’s stomach. She held her firmly, grounding her as Agatha’s chest rose and fell
        between breaths and broken sobs beneath their intertwined hands.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “It’s okay, baby,”
   </em>
   she murmured softly into her ear, her voice a steady anchor.
   <em>
    “I’ve got you.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    “Mama—did you hear me?
   </strong>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky’s voice broke through her thoughts, pulling her back to the present.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha startled, her mind snapping out of the memory and focusing forward, on the diner booth where Nicky sat
        across from her, his face etched with concern. He held a forkful of pancake halfway to his mouth, syrup dripping
        onto the table as he looked at her.
  </p>
<p>
   Mindlessly Agatha reached for a napkin, leaning forward to wipe up the sticky mess before he set his sleeve in
        it.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m sorry, honey. I was thinking about something at work,” she lied smoothly, giving him a warm smile she hoped
        would reassure him, even if it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “What were you saying?”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky studied her for a moment, his brow furrowed in that way he got when he was thinking hard about something.
        Then—only like a child could—the worry eased, and he returned to his food, putting the pile of pancakes in his
        mouth.
  </p>
<p>
   “I was just wondering if you were going to the office today?” he asked around the mouthful of pancakes.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha scrunched up her nose in disgust at his manners but thought about his question.
  </p>
<p>
   It was Saturday.
  </p>
<p>
   Usually, work was a toss-up depending on what was happening.
  </p>
<p>
   Should Agatha be at the office, prepping for the Vanguard case?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Absolutely.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But would she be going in, knowing that Rio was likely there also prepping the case?
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Absolutely not.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The thought of facing her after last night, after breaking down in front of her, felt impossible.
  </p>
<p>
   If she’d thought looking Rio in the eye after sleeping together had been hard, this felt like a whole new level
        of vulnerability she wasn’t ready to confront.
  </p>
<p>
   She managed a small, reassuring smile, focusing on Nicky.
  </p>
<p>
   “No work today,” she said, reaching over to ruffle his hair. “Just us.”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky beamed at her, syrup smeared on his cheek and chunks of pancake hanging out of his mouth.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes!”
  </p>
<p>
   “Nicky,” she feigned a gag, rolling her eyes dramatically. “Chew your food!
   <em>
    Goodness
   </em>
   —
   <em>
    who raised
            you?”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   He swallowed, his eyes sparkling.
  </p>
<p>
   “Umm... you did,” he said, pointing his fork at her, as if presenting solid evidence.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha put on an exaggerated expression of surprise, holding back a smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “Did I?” she mused, pretending to think hard.
  </p>
<p>
   Then, with a mischievous glint, she grabbed her fork and reached across the table, stealing a giant bite of his
        pancake and forced it into her mouth. She chewed it dramatically, speaking around the mouthful.
  </p>
<p>
   “I am certain—
   <em>
    I would’ve taught
   </em>
   —you to chew your—
   <em>
    food before talking.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky erupted into giggles, his face lighting up.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mama!” he protested, barely able to contain his laughter.
  </p>
<p>
   “What?” she asked, feigning innocence, still chewing obnoxiously. "Do I have something in my teeth?” she asked,
        opening her mouth and showing him the chewed up pancake.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky squealed with laughter, his giggles filling her heart.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s chest swelled at the sound.
  </p>
<p>
   She wished she could live in this moment forever.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mother's words still haunted her, but they were quieter now.
  </p>
<p>
   She also knew Monday would come, that she couldn’t outrun Rio forever,
  </p>
<p>
   But right now, with Nicky’s laughter echoing around the diner and his face bright with happiness, she let herself
        sink into the present, holding tightly to this small, perfect moment for as long as she could.
  </p>
<p>
   She rested her chin in her hand, elbow propped on the table, and opened her mouth to show Nicky the chewed-up
        food again. He squealed in delight, covering his face with his hands but still peeking through his fingers.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt a warmth spread through her, watching his pure, unfiltered happiness.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Fuck you, Evanora,
   </em>
   she thought, the words settling into her heart like a quiet, reassuring truth.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    I am a good mother.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha spent the entire weekend with Nicky, letting him set the agenda. She tagged along to every place he wanted
        to go, soaking up his laughter, his boundless energy and joy. They went to the museum, the park, the zoo. They
        played board games at home, watched his favorite movies, and ate way too much junk food.
  </p>
<p>
   But she didn’t care.
  </p>
<p>
   He’d be with his father after school tomorrow, and she wouldn’t see him for a week. She was determined to fill
        every moment with his smile.
  </p>
<p>
   On Monday morning, she saw Nicky off to school. He gave her an extra-big hug, his little arms squeezing her
        tightly before he bolted from the car and towards the building.
  </p>
<p>
   “See you next week, Mama! Love you!” he called over his shoulder, his voice bright.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blew him a kiss, watching until he’d made it safely inside.
  </p>
<p>
   She lingered for a moment, feeling that familiar emptiness settle in—the ache that always crept in when he was
        gone. With a sigh, she rolled up her window and leaned back into the leather seat, closing her eyes and letting
        out a deep breath.
  </p>
<p>
   She couldn’t afford to linger in that feeling.
  </p>
<p>
   She had to switch gears, to focus.
  </p>
<p>
   Afterall, she had a white whale to harpoon.
  </p>
<p>
   Opening her eyes, she pressed the intercom button.
  </p>
<p>
   “To the office, Dan.”
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes, Ms. Harkness,” her driver responded smoothly, and the town car pulled away from the curb, heading towards a
        day that somehow both thrilled her and made her want to throw up.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha walked briskly through the office, her heels clicking with purpose. She didn’t go straight to her office.
        Instead, she veered left, heading directly to the war room. If she was going to reclaim her footing, she needed
        to do it immediately, on her terms.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio was already there, as she’d expected, looking over documents pinned to the board, a pen tucked behind her
        ear.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked up as Agatha entered, her expression as calm and unreadable as ever.
  </p>
<p>
   No pity, no softness—just Rio being Rio, a touch of cockiness in her gaze but otherwise cool, professional.
  </p>
<p>
   It was as if nothing had happened, and Agatha clung to that professionalism Rio was extending towards her like a
        lifeline.
  </p>
<p>
   "Did you secure those affidavits?" Agatha asked, keeping her tone steady, controlled—not letting any of her
        internal anxieties seep through.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio nodded, her expression impassive.
  </p>
<p>
   "They’re on your desk."
  </p>
<p>
   "Good," Agatha replied, stepping forward to study the board—needing the distraction.
  </p>
<p>
   Her gaze landing on the photo of Brooke Sinclair at the center of the board.
  </p>
<p>
   She took in the young woman’s face, her features frozen in time, and felt a sharp, uncomfortable pang.
  </p>
<p>
   Brooke had been so young—just four years younger than Rio was now.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    That thought
   </em>
   had a painful ache echo through her chest, but Agatha forced it aside, focusing her
        thoughts back on Brooke’s case.
  </p>
<p>
   Brooke Sinclair had an entire life ahead of her, stolen without a second thought.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha couldn’t bring her back, couldn’t undo the grief that had swallowed her family.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Death was one battle even she couldn’t win.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But she could make those responsible pay.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt that familiar, steely resolve settle over her.
  </p>
<p>
   Vanguard had deep pockets, a reputation built on its wealth and power—and she was determined to see every cent of
        it go toward making sure Brooke’s death wouldn’t be forgotten.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt Rio step up beside her, both of them facing the board in shared silence.
  </p>
<p>
   After a few moments, Agatha turned to her.
  </p>
<p>
   “You ready?” she asked, her voice steady but, laced with the thrill that always came with taking a case to court.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio met her gaze, her expression unwavering.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes.”
  </p>
<p>
   With a nod, Agatha strode over to the door, opening it and calling out into the hallway.
  </p>
<p>
   “Billy! Get me a status hearing scheduled with Judge Marks on the Vanguard case. ASAP.”
  </p>
<p>
   She watched as Billy scrambled into action, a sense of satisfaction blooming in her chest as the wheels began to
        turn.
  </p>
<p>
   She turned back to Rio, feeling the familiar rush that always hit when a case was about to go live in court. Any
        lingering anxiety about them had vanished, as the feeling rushed through her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Now,” she smirked, her eyes gleaming with anticipation, “the real fun starts.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s lips curled into a matching grin, her energy mirroring Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   They were on the same page, and Agatha could feel it:
   <em>
    they were ready for war.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The town car cruised through the city streets.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sat back against the leather, the courthouse growing closer with each passing block, her gaze steady but
        the flicker of excitement sparking inside her. She could feel the shift in energy, the familiar rush that always
        came before a courtroom showdown.
  </p>
<p>
   Beside her, Rio watched her, curiosity evident, her fingers tapping thoughtfully against her leg.
  </p>
<p>
   “So,” Rio broke the silence, her voice low but curious, “what’s the plan?”
  </p>
<p>
   She leaned in, her eyes sharp but curious, as she stared at Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “We still need to depose their witnesses, right? Get an idea of their defense before we request trial.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned, a slow, predatory smile forming on her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “That is typically how it’s done,” she replied, the tone measured, almost teasing.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyes narrowed, sensing something off on Agatha’s choice of words.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Typically
   </em>
   ...meaning?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s smirk deepened, a glint of challenge in her gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   “You are very smart, Rio,” she said allowing the compliment to leave her mouth. Rio deserved that much. “You’re a
        natural at pulling apart documents, at tracing every single thread in a web until you find something valuable.
        Your report writing is impeccable and your knowledge of case law is far beyond someone of your age and rank.”
  </p>
<p>
   She paused, letting her words sink in, her eyes never leaving Rio’s before reeling the overconfident rookie back
        to earth.
  </p>
<p>
   “But this job is more than paperwork. It’s more than strategy.
   <em>
    It’s showmanship
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   As the car slowed, Agatha tilted her head toward the courthouse, the large building coming into view.
  </p>
<p>
   She raised her chin, her gaze drifting to the entryway as if picturing the stage that awaited her inside the
        courtroom.
  </p>
<p>
   “This,” she continued, her voice gaining an almost electric intensity that mirrored the feeling inside her, “
   <em>
    is theater.
   </em>
   What separates the good lawyers from the great isn’t a well-written brief or even a solid
        cross-examination. It’s the ability to control the narrative. To own the
  </p>
<p>
   courtroom. To create a story out of every detail, every witness, every piece of evidence. And to do all of that
        while staying two steps ahead of opposing counsel.”
  </p>
<p>
   She leaned forward, relishing in the way Rio’s eyes were locked on her with an intensity.
  </p>
<p>
   “From the moment you step into that courtroom, you must command it,” stressed Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   The moment hung between them, and then slowly Rio’s lips curled into a smirk, her gaze dancing with amusement, a
        spark of something that Agatha recognized all too well in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “I think I’m pretty good at commanding—
   <em>
    as you well know
   </em>
   ,” she murmured back easily.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt her breath catch.
  </p>
<p>
   She really couldn’t bother to be upset about it.
  </p>
<p>
   She had
   <em>
    literally
   </em>
   set Rio up for that one.
  </p>
<p>
   But today, Agatha felt just as emboldened, with the thrill of the case that laid ahead coursing through her,
        feeding her confidence. She met Rio’s gaze, allowing a dangerous smile to creep onto her face.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes, you are,” she said, her tone cool, layered with a hint of playful intensity. “But this—
   <em>
    this is
            different.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper, soft and charged.
  </p>
<p>
   “This isn’t the bedroom, darling. This is my arena.
   <em>
    Here, I am in control.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   She heard Rio suck in a breath at that, momentarily thrown by Agatha’s words.
  </p>
<p>
   And Agatha taking advantage of the rare feat, reached up and touched Rio's cheek lightly, before leaning in,
        purposely turning her tone turning low and intimate.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Watch mama work
   </em>
   , and take notes,” she murmured into Rio’s ear, before pulling back and looking at her
        and giving Rio’s cheek a mocking pat. “There will be a quiz afterward.”
  </p>
<p>
   As she felt the car come to a stop, she released her and pulled herself gracefully from the car, stepping onto
        the pavement.
  </p>
<p>
   Her heels clicked against the stone steps as she moved toward the courthouse doors.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t look back, trusting that Rio would follow.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sat in the chair, tapping her fingers rhythmically on the desk as she waited for the judge to arrive.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio sat beside her on the right.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha cast a glance to her left, where two members of the Salem Seven were seated, eyes sharp and unreadable as
        they scanned the room.
  </p>
<p>
   Madeline Fox and Greg Ratcliff.
  </p>
<p>
   They were stationed out of her firm’s New York office, both seasoned litigators, and Agatha knew well enough not
        to underestimate them. She didn’t need to be conceited to acknowledge good lawyers when she saw them—these two
        were skilled, calculated.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox, especially, had a reputation for ruthlessness that Agatha respected, even if she didn’t like it.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox was the real threat here.
  </p>
<p>
   Cunning and meticulous, Fox moved like a predator in the courtroom, dangerous because she didn’t let ethics cloud
        her strategy. She would exploit any weakness without hesitation, making her both effective and morally bankrupt.
  </p>
<p>
   Ratcliff, on the other hand, was a glorified paper-pusher, but he was annoyingly sharp when it came to case law.
        If there was a loophole, he’d find it. If there was a technicality to exploit, the
   <em>
    little rat
   </em>
   would
        certainly sniff it out.
  </p>
<p>
   “All rise,” called the clerk, snapping Agatha’s attention forward as she stood. “The Honorable Judge Harrison
        Marks presiding.”
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks entered the courtroom and walked up the steps to the bench, his expression as impassive as ever.
  </p>
<p>
   When she first filed the lawsuit against Vanguard three years ago, securing Judge Marks had been a quiet victory.
        Like many New York judges, he leaned liberal, but more importantly, he had a well-known aversion to favoring
        billionaire corporations.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks's record was clear on his stance: while he upheld corporate rights, but he also believed corporations
        should also bear the same moral and legal responsibilities as citizens. His previous rulings, often forced
        companies to account for their impact on people and communities—a philosophy that worked in favor for her on
        Vanguard case.
  </p>
<p>
   What didn’t work in her favor, however, was Judge Marks —
   <em>
    was not of a fan of hers.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The man had a memory like a steel trap.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had earned herself
   <strong>
    ONE
   </strong>
   contempt of court citation from him eight years ago in a
        particularly contentious case where she may have called a dirty police officer an "
   <em>
    racist asshole
   </em>
   "
        during questioning, and he hadn’t let her forget it since.
  </p>
<p>
   As Judge Marks settled into his chair, Agatha and the others took their seats. He reached for the case file,
        skimming it with a frown.
  </p>
<p>
   “This matter is here for a status hearing,” he began, flipping through the pages. “I was under the impression
        that this matter was closed?”
  </p>
<p>
   His eyes narrowed at the details.
  </p>
<p>
   “Am I reading this right? The suit was originally filed in 2021.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha expected this, and stood.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes, your honor,” she replied smoothly, “and it’s taken us this long to get through the discovery
        process—courtesy of the defense’s, let’s say,” she paused to side long a glance at a smirking Fox, “
   <em>
    extensive cooperation
   </em>
   after you granted our initial request.”
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks's gaze flicked up at her, one eyebrow arching skeptically.
  </p>
<p>
   “Three years... for discovery?” he said, skepticism lacing his voice.
  </p>
<p>
   “The defense discovery dumped us with over 5 million documents,” Agatha replied, maintaining her composure. “We
        particularly enjoyed the 40 years' worth of holiday cards they sent along with their documents.”
  </p>
<p>
   This time, Agatha didn’t hesitate to turn and fix Fox with a look, her gaze narrowing.
  </p>
<p>
   “Nothing quite brings a
   <em>
    festive spirit
   </em>
   to the review process like reminiscing about Vanguards yearly
        cheer,” she mocked smoothly.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox didn’t even blink, but Agatha could see the satisfaction in her own reflection. She knew Fox had enjoyed
        burying her under all that irrelevant nonsense—she could practically see the smirk hidden behind Fox’s
        professionally impassive expression.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks sighed, a long-suffering sound, his gaze flicking between the two lawyers with a look that suggested
        he already knew this status hearing was going to be far from straightforward.
  </p>
<p>
   After a moment, he settled his eyes on Agatha, gesturing for her to continue.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt a flicker of irritation at being nudged along but kept her expression smooth.
  </p>
<p>
   “Our firm has finally completed the exhaustive review of every document submitted, and we are—
   <em>
    at long
            last
   </em>
   —ready,” she said, measured with a certain dramatic she couldn’t help but use.
  </p>
<p>
   Then she paused, her mind running over the strategy she’d mapped out over the weekend with Nicky as they played a
        few rounds of Catan. The game required a deft hand at blocking opponents before they even had the chance to get
        their footing. And today, she had her own plan to throw the defense off balance from the very start.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha glanced at Rio, catching her eye with a quick, confident wink before turning back to the judge, her
        expression sharpening with resolve.
  </p>
<p>
   “We call ready for trial.”
  </p>
<p>
   She felt Rio stiffen beside her, and she didn’t bother hiding the satisfaction that swelled as she watched Judge
        Marks's eyes widen, the barest flicker of surprise crossing his face.
  </p>
<p>
   Across the aisle, Madeline Fox shot up from her chair as if Agatha had pulled the lever herself.
  </p>
<p>
   “Wait—what?!” Fox’s voice faltered, and the crack in her usual cool confidence was music to Agatha’s ears.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox quickly gathered herself, drawing a steady breath as she fixed Agatha with a pointed glare before addressing
        the judge.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your Honor, we’re not ready for trial,” she protested, her tone firm but just shy of desperate. “We deposed
        their witnesses three years ago. They have deposed none of ours.”
  </p>
<p>
   Fox fell right into Agatha's trap, and Agatha relished every second of it.
  </p>
<p>
   “How can you possibly not be ready?” Agatha's tone was dripping with incredulity, her eyes locked on Fox. “What
        have you been doing for the past three years? You wouldn’t perhaps—
   <em>
    I don’t know
   </em>
   —be sitting on your
        hands—hoping my firm would just go bankrupt trying to get through the mountain of discovery you dumped on us?”
  </p>
<p>
   Fox opened her mouth, but Agatha didn’t give her the chance.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let’s stop wasting the court’s time, shall we?” Agatha cut in, her gaze fixed on Judge Marks, her voice calm but
        charged with finality. “We call ready for trial, Your Honor.”
  </p>
<p>
   A silence settled over the room, thick and heavy.
  </p>
<p>
   You could’ve heard a pin drop.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks's eyes narrowed as he absorbed her statement.
  </p>
<p>
   “This is a dangerous game you’re playing, Ms. Harkness,” he said, his tone carrying both warning and intrigue.
        “You haven’t deposed a single one of their witnesses.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha shrugged, a hint of a smirk on her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “I don’t need to. I have a pretty good idea what they’re all going to say,” she replied confidently, her voice as
        unwavering as her gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   Another blanket of silence covered the courtroom for a moment, before Judge Marks leaned forward, his gaze locked
        onto Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “Just so we’re clear, because your reputation does precede you, Ms. Harkness, and I will not have my courtroom
        turned into some kind of reality TV spectacle,” he said, his voice firm. “Are you truly ready for trial? Right
        now.
   <em>
    Today
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha glanced down at Rio, who was watching her with an expression that bordered on awe, barely daring to
        breathe.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked back up at Judge Marks , her voice steady.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes, Your Honor.”
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks leaned back, a mixture of shock and reluctant admiration crossing his face. He sat there, weighing
        her words, before slowly turning his gaze to Fox.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mrs. Fox?”
  </p>
<p>
   Madeline Fox looked like a fish out of water, her mouth opening and closing as she struggled to find her words,
        before she finally sputtered.
  </p>
<p>
   “This is ridiculous,” gesturing at Agatha with visible frustration. “This is a purely a stunt, Your Honor.”
  </p>
<p>
   Beside her, Ratcliff stood, pushing his glasses up his nose with an air of smug superiority that made Agatha’s
        hands itch to knock them clean off his face.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your Honor,” he said, his tone oily, “Ms. Harkness is alleging negligence against Vanguard, which necessitates
        further discovery with respect to duty of care.”
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Duty of care.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Of course.
  </p>
<p>
   Trust
   <em>
    the little rat
   </em>
   to cling to that particular lifeline.
  </p>
<p>
   Ratcliff glanced at Agatha, his smirk practically daring her to try and sidestep the technicality.
  </p>
<p>
   “And naturally, that will take time.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha drummed her fingers on the desk, her mind working furiously. She’d anticipated pushback but hadn’t
        expected them to find a parachute so quickly. She felt a quick tug on her sleeve, and turned to see Rio looking
        up at her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha leaned down, and as soon as she did, Rio spoke.
  </p>
<p>
   “We could go after them for conspiracy,” she suggested, her tone careful but excited. “It’s a harder case to
        prove, and it opens us up to a counter-suit, but
   <em>
    if this is the road you want to walk
   </em>
   , then we need to
        shift from negligence to conspiracy.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes lit up at the idea, as the thrill of a new tactic settled into her bones.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rio and her big, beautiful fucking brain.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Straightening up, Agatha faced the judge with renewed confidence.
  </p>
<p>
   “Very well, Your Honor,” she said, her voice steady and razor-sharp. “Let’s forget negligence then. We’ll pursue
        wrongful act and conspiracy.”
  </p>
<p>
   The reaction was immediate.
  </p>
<p>
   Both Fox and Ratcliff shot up, their faces flushed with anger as they began talking over each other, their voices
        a mixture of outrage and panic.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your Honor, this is absurd—” Fox started, her voice shrill.
  </p>
<p>
   “This wasn’t in the original pleadings!” Ratcliff protested, his hands waving in disbelief.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks banged his gavel, silencing the room as he gave them all a hard look.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha kept her expression calm, but inside, she savored the chaos. The judge’s gaze turned to her, pinning her
        with a steady, scrutinizing look.
  </p>
<p>
   “Ms. Harkness, I want to ensure I understood you correctly. You’re willing to waive your negligence claim against
        Vanguard?”
  </p>
<p>
   “That’s correct, Your Honor,” she replied confidently.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks's eyebrows rose, clearly taken aback.
  </p>
<p>
   “That is your strongest case, Ms. Harkness. Not to mention, pursuing conspiracy without negligence opens your
        firm up to a potential litigation suit should you fail.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha drew in a steadying breath, already imagining the look on Jen’s face when she heard about this decision.
  </p>
<p>
   “I understand, Judge,” she replied, her voice unwavering. “We will still be pursuing a conspiracy case against
        Vanguard.”
  </p>
<p>
   The look of shock on Fox and Ratcliff’s faces was priceless. Fox’s expression shifted from surprise to outrage.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re really willing to waive the negligence claim?” she demanded, disbelief ringing in her voice.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha gave a theatrical flourish of her hands, her tone calm and almost amused.
  </p>
<p>
   “I believe I just did.”
  </p>
<p>
   Turning her attention back to Judge Marks, she took a moment before speaking, letting her words settle over the
        room.
  </p>
<p>
   “The defense says Brooke Sinclair took her own life,” she began, her voice steady, clear. “
   <em>
    They claim
   </em>
   the stress of her work caused a decline in her performance, which led to disciplinary action and, ultimately, to
        her
   <em>
    alleged
   </em>
   suicide.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her tone sharpened as she thought about Brooke, about the injustice to this young woman, and how the gaping hole
        her murder has left in her parent’s lives.
  </p>
<p>
   “We say Brooke Sinclair didn’t kill herself.
   <em>
    We allege
   </em>
   that she uncovered evidence suggesting Vanguard
        was illegally shipping weapons overseas. When she reported her findings to her supervisor, they disciplined her
        for the first time in her five-year career. And when she refused to back down, they had her killed to cover up
        their illegal acts.”
  </p>
<p>
   The room was thick with tension, Agatha’s accusation hanging heavy in the air.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox and Ratcliff sat their faces stoic, not even blinking at her accusation.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks's gaze stayed on her for a moment longer before he turned to the opposing counsel, one brow raised in
        question—a silent prompt for their response.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox and Ratcliff immediately put their heads together, whispering urgently. Agatha drummed her fingers on the
        table, waiting with feigned patience as the seconds dragged into minutes.
  </p>
<p>
   Even Judge Marks's expression was turning impatient.
  </p>
<p>
   “Counsel,” he said his tone edged with warning.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox and Ratcliff murmured a few final words before Fox rose to her feet, her gaze flicking to Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   The challenge in her eyes was unmistakable, and Agatha felt a flicker of satisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
   She knew what Fox was going to say even before she spoke.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your Honor,” Fox said, her voice steady, “we also call ready for trial.”
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks leaned back in his chair, momentarily taken aback by the unexpected turn of this status hearing. But
        then he seemed to collect himself, before gesturing to his court clerk.
  </p>
<p>
   “Call down for a
   <em>
    voir dire
   </em>
   panel, Beth,” he ordered. “Look like we have a jury to pick.”
  </p>
<p>
   The weight of his words settled over the room, and Agatha felt a surge of victory.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    This was it
   </em>
   —the case was officially moving forward, and every inch of her was ready to fight like hell.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha paced the length of her kitchen, unable to shake the pulse of energy still thrumming through her veins.
  </p>
<p>
   The car had dropped her off nearly two hours ago, but the thrill of the day was alive, buzzing in every nerve of
        her body.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d won today.
  </p>
<p>
   She knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   Hell, even Fox and Ratcliff knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   And Rio—
   <em>
    god,
   </em>
   the way Rio had looked at her afterward.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She definitely knew it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The memory flashed through her mind, as vivid as if it were happening again. When they’d finally slipped into the
        privacy of the town car, Rio had looked at her like she was debating between pulling Agatha close, pressing her
        against the leather seats, or getting on her knees right there.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha would have gladly taken either.
  </p>
<p>
   She always felt this way after a victory—this buzzing, restless energy that demanded release.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Good
   </em>
   sex, the kind that left her wrecked, was the only thing that came close to calming her down.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d barely kept it together in the car as they pulled up to her building, turning to Rio with an
        uncharacteristic desperation she didn’t even bother to hide.
  </p>
<p>
   "Come over tonight?" she asked, her voice soft but intense, making sure to follow Rio’s rules and
   <strong>
<em>
     ask
    </em>
</strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyes darkened, that unflinching gaze full of unspoken promises as she nodded.
  </p>
<p>
   “I need to go home first, get a few things straightened out,” she replied, her voice rough, low. “But I’ll be by
        as soon as I can.”
  </p>
<p>
   There was something about Rio’s voice, raw and edged with heat, that shot straight through her.
  </p>
<p>
   And yet, Agatha had an inkling that the woman had nothing pressing to handle. Knowing Rio, she was probably just
        letting Agatha stew—making her sit while being impossibly turned on.
  </p>
<p>
   But Agatha would take anything Rio offered right now.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She was that desperate.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She nodded, moving to get out of the car, but Rio’s hand wrapped around her arm, halting her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Do not even
   <em>
    think
   </em>
   about touching yourself before I get there,” Rio warned, her voice low and
        commanding.
  </p>
<p>
   The words sent a jolt through Agatha, her heart thudding hard in her chest. She hadn’t planned on it, but now
        that Rio had forbidden it, the idea was suddenly,
   <em>
    achingly
   </em>
   tempting.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyes narrowed, reading the mischief brewing in Agatha’s gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   “ Agatha ,” she warned, her tone steely.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha scoffed, slipping out of Rio’s grasp with an air of nonchalance.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay—fine!” she said, throwing her hands up in mock surrender, sounding almost like a petulant teenager being
        told they couldn’t go to a party. “No pre-game before the game. Vibe killer. ”
  </p>
<p>
   True to her word, she didn’t touch herself.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, she was now on her third glass of bourbon and had hit her 10,000-step goal just pacing her apartment
        like a caged tiger. Every time she glanced at her phone seeing the clock — of valuable time being wasted —her
        anticipation flared hotter, her patience wearing thin.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally —a knock at the door.
  </p>
<p>
   Did she scramble embarrassingly fast to answer it?
  </p>
<p>
   Yes.
  </p>
<p>
   Did she pause outside the door to take a couple of steadying breaths so it wouldn’t look like she’d just sprinted
        across the room?
  </p>
<p>
   Also, yes.
  </p>
<p>
   Once composed, Agatha swung open the door and took in the sight of Rio. She was wearing dark jeans and a sleek
        black jacket, her casual look somehow only heightening the anticipation building in Agatha. But then her eyes
        narrowed as she noticed something unexpected.
  </p>
<p>
   She raised an eyebrow, her voice laced with mockery as she crossed her arms and stared at Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why are you wearing a backpack? What are you, twelve?”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyebrow arched at the question, and that familiar, predatory smirk spread across her face, making Agatha’s
        confidence waver ever so slightly.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha was beginning to recognize what that look meant.
  </p>
<p>
   Oh.
  </p>
<p>
   What the hell did Rio Vidal have planned for her tonight?

   Chapter Summary
   <p>
    The world is falling a part, so here is my little attempt at trying to provide something to make the day better.
    <br/>
</p>
</code>
<p>
   Agatha sat on her bed, nursing her drink, her eyes fixed on Rio standing in front of her.
  </p>
<p>
   There was a certain dramatic flair to Rio tonight, a kind of quiet performance that felt both irritating and
        magnetic. Agatha couldn’t help but wonder if her little speech from the town car —about commanding the “theater”
        of a courtroom, about wielding power through presence—had somehow inspired Rio to lean into her power even more,
        to become bolder, a little spicier than usual.
  </p>
<p>
   As always, Rio had entered Agatha’s home like she owned it, gliding through the doorway and making her way
        straight to the bedroom without a word. Agatha followed because she knew if she didn’t, Rio would just stand
        there waiting for her anyways.
  </p>
<p>
   As soon as she entered the room, Rio’s expression was unreadable, but the raised eyebrow and subtle tilt of her
        head said it all: Go sit down.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had rolled her eyes but complied, making her way to the bed, sinking down with her drink, her patience
        already wearing thin. She sat there, drink in hand, watching Rio’s every movement, the restless energy in her
        making it impossible to stay silent for more than twenty seconds.
  </p>
<p>
   With an exaggerated sigh, Agatha flicked her hand sharply, signaling her silent command: “Well? Get on with it.”
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t the least bit surprised when Rio didn’t budge, didn’t even blink.
  </p>
<p>
   She simply stood there, gaze unwavering, meeting Agatha’s impatience with steady calm. The silence stretched,
        lingering until Agatha realized the play, Rio was making it painfully clear —Agatha wasn’t in charge anymore,
        and would not be dictating when they started.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips pressed together, frustration simmering beneath the surface. She busied herself with her drink,
        taking a slow sip as if the act itself could distract her from the tension Rio was creating.
  </p>
<p>
   She hated it , but she knew— unfortunately —that this was the game she’d agreed to play with Rio, and tonight,
        she was on Rio’s terms.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rio moved.
  </p>
<p>
   She slipped the black backpack off her shoulder, and with a calculated toss, let it sail through the air and fall
        onto Agatha’s bed, landing beside her with a heavy thud that seemed to echo through the room.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s gaze dropped to the bag, the weight of whatever Rio had brought settling heavily beside her—not just in
        its contents, but the energy of the moment she was creating.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha looked up, meeting Rio's gaze, feeling her own curiosity twist with a hint of challenge.
  </p>
<p>
   But Rio's face betrayed nothing—there was however, a dark satisfaction in her eyes,
   <em>
    almost smug,
   </em>
   as
        though she was savoring the fact that Agatha was out of the loop, missing something important.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What the hell was in this bag?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   For a split second, Agatha wondered if she was missing some secret signal, some unspoken code.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, after what felt like an eternity of silence, Rio gave a small nod toward the bag, her eyes never leaving
        Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   “Open it.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words were calm, almost too casual, but they landed with the weight of a challenge that hung heavy in the
        air.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha glanced down at the bag, then back up at Rio, hating the thrill that shot through her.
  </p>
<p>
   She could feel the deliberate drama Rio was weaving around her, each second ticking by with excruciating
        slowness. Curiosity clawed at her resolve, gnawing away until she couldn’t help herself. She reached out,
        grabbing the bag, feeling its weight in her hands—not heavy, but
   <em>
    something
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Slowly, she slid the zipper open, the sound slicing through the silence as she peeled back the fabric and peered
        inside.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Oh.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Her heart lurched as she realized what she was looking at, and then both a dark thrill laced disbelief moved
        through her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked up at Rio, who was watching her intently, those dark eyes fixed on her like a predator waiting to
        savor every flicker of reaction crossing Agatha’s face.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed, her fingers lingering on the bag before she set it aside, leaving it open. She took a slow, sip
        of her drink, trying to gather her scattered thoughts, steady her pulse, and find the right words.
  </p>
<p>
   What did one even say
   <em>
    to that
   </em>
   ?
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, she arched an eyebrow, her voice not as steady as she would have liked but made sure to lace with extra
        dry humor to mask it.
  </p>
<p>
   “Isn’t that a bit... redundant?” she said, gesturing dismissively toward the bag. “If I wanted
   <em>
    that
   </em>
   ,
        wouldn’t I just... fuck a man?”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio tilted her head, one brow arching as she met Agatha’s challenge with a maddeningly calm expression.
  </p>
<p>
   “You like penetration, Agatha,” she replied, her tone dry and factual as if she were citing case law that was
        built on rock solid precedence. In this case, the precedence, being the
   <em>
    sheer amount
   </em>
   of times Agatha
        has cum while Rio’s fingers were buried inside her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt her skin flush at that.
  </p>
<p>
   “Most women do,” she shot back, finishing her drink and realizing too late that her glass was empty. She stared
        at it, as if sheer willpower might summon more, because
   <em>
    god,
   </em>
   she was going to need half a bottle to get
        through this damn night.
  </p>
<p>
   “So... what’s to say you won’t enjoy this too?” Rio asked, her voice low, her gaze flickering to the bag and then
        back to Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Her lips curled into a wicked smirk.
  </p>
<p>
   “Can you imagine it?
   <em>
    Feeling me inside you like that
   </em>
   , while I still have both hands free... nothing
        holding me back?”
  </p>
<p>
   The words, spoken with Rio's signature confidence, sent an involuntary shiver down Agatha’s spine. Her mouth went
        dry, and her defiance wavered under Rio’s steady gaze. She wanted to roll her eyes, to snap out a dismissive
        retort—but her mind betrayed her, already filling with images of exactly what Rio was describing.
  </p>
<p>
   But the words wouldn’t come.
  </p>
<p>
   Her throat was tight, her breath caught.
  </p>
<p>
   This wasn’t what she’d expected.
  </p>
<p>
   She was still getting used to normal lesbian sex—with Rio’s finger and mouth sending her over the edge, and vice
        versa.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    This
   </em>
   felt like a leap into something deeper, more consuming.
  </p>
<p>
   She could certainly feel herself drawn toward it, and yet the vulnerability—of allowing Rio
   <em>
    that much
   </em>
   control over her—caused an uncomfortable pull in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio seemed to read the turmoil on her face, as if Agatha’s thoughts were projected for her to see.
  </p>
<p>
   The smirk faded, her expression softening as she stepped forward. The intensity in her eyes remained, but it was
        gentled, like she was setting aside her predatory edge for something more sincere.
  </p>
<p>
   “Remember—you hold all the cards here, Agatha,” Rio murmured, her voice warm and reassuring as she closed the
        distance between them.
  </p>
<p>
   She reached out, taking the empty glass from Agatha’s hand and setting it carefully on the nightstand, never once
        breaking eye contact.
  </p>
<p>
   When she turned back, she cupped Agatha’s cheek with a tenderness that stole the breath from Agatha’s lungs, her
        thumb gently stroking her skin.
  </p>
<p>
   “I will never—
   <em>
    ever
   </em>
   —do anything to you that you don’t want,” she said softly, her voice barely above a
        whisper. “Say the word, and the bag goes away.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha glanced down at the bag, the contents still an undeniable presence between them. She swallowed hard,
        images of what she’d seen inside flickering in her mind.
  </p>
<p>
   “It just seems...like a lot,” she muttered, cringing slightly at how hesitant her voice sounded.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    She hated sounding vulnerable.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “It’s above average,” Rio replied smoothly, without missing a beat.
  </p>
<p>
   It took Agatha a second to register Rio’s words, and when she did, a snort escaped her—an unexpected laugh
        breaking through her tension. She could feel the knot in her chest loosen,
   <em>
    just a little
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   She couldn’t help the smile that crept onto her face, as she swatted playfully at Rio’s hip.
  </p>
<p>
   “I didn’t mean the size,
   <em>
    you asshole
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s lips curved into that smile—
   <em>
    the real one
   </em>
   —and Agatha’s heart was hammering for a very different
        reason now.
  </p>
<p>
   Without breaking eye contact, Rio reached down, hooking her finger gently under Agatha’s chin, tilting her face
        up to meet her gaze. Dark eyes searched hers, steady and calm, a softness in them that sent a wave of warmth
        through Agatha’s chest.
  </p>
<p>
   “Would it be easier for you,” Rio murmured, her voice soft, “if you were the one wearing it?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes widened, new images flooding her mind, and the suggestion caught her completely off guard.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Jesus—this woman was truly trying to kill her.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Her mouth opened, but the words didn’t come immediately, lingering as she grappled with her own surprise.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, she managed, “You’d honestly let me do that to you?” she asked, her tone dripping with skepticism.
  </p>
<p>
   She needed to test Rio.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    To call out what had to be a bluff.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   But then that smile reappeared, that confident—
   <em>
    real
   </em>
   —knowing smile, and Rio’s fingers traced a light
        path along Agatha’s jaw, sending a shiver down her spine.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Oh, Agatha
   </em>
   ,” Rio murmured, voice soft and low, like a promise. “There is very little I wouldn’t let
        you do to me.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse quickened, Rio’s words wrapping around her, sinking into her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   The way Rio looked at her, like she’d hand over her control to Agatha without hesitation, sent both thrill and
        disbelief coursing through her. Agatha swallowed, trying to keep her composure, but the weight of Rio’s gaze
        made it nearly impossible.
  </p>
<p>
   She could feel Rio’s fingers still gently tracing her jaw, grounding her, and yet making her feel like she was
        teetering on the edge of something unfamiliar and thrilling.
  </p>
<p>
   Her breath came a little faster, the last shreds of her defiance slipping as she felt herself leaning into Rio’s
        touch.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re serious about this,” Agatha finally managed, voice barely steady.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio gave her a look, that subtle smirk coming back.
  </p>
<p>
   “Have you ever known me not to be serious when we’re like this?” Rio murmured, leaning in close, her voice a low,
        intimate rasp, lips hovering just a breath away from Agatha’s ear.
  </p>
<p>
   “If you want to be control, Agatha...”
  </p>
<p>
   Her words were a challenge and a promise, slipping into Agatha’s skin like heat.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Then you can be in control.”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She pulled back slowly, meeting Agatha’s gaze head-on, her eyes daring, intense.
  </p>
<p>
   “Is that what you want?” she asked, her voice dropping even lower, a velvet softness that seemed to coil right
        around Agatha’s heart—
   <em>
    squeezing
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart beat faster, as if both fighting against Rio’s hold on and responding to the question that hung in
        the air.
  </p>
<p>
   Before Rio, she wouldn’t have hesitated, wouldn’t have even considered another option. Control was her armor, her
        currency, her way of keeping the world and everyone in it exactly where she wanted.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    But now?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Now, she hesitated.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio watched her intently, her gaze unwavering—
   <em>
    waiting
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could feel that familiar thrill bubbling up, the one Rio always seemed to draw out of her, making her
        question the rules she’d lived by, the rules she’d made to protect herself.
  </p>
<p>
   Control had always been her safe place—the one thing she could rely on, the thing she trusted above all else.
  </p>
<p>
   But, now as she
   <em>
    actually
   </em>
   thought about it—
  </p>
<p>
   Her heart tightened, a startling realization settling over her like a revelation she wasn’t prepared for.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rio
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio had suddenly become a safe place for Agatha too.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed, feeling the weight of her decision settle over her, heavy and thrilling all at once. She looked
        up, her voice steady but low.
  </p>
<p>
   “No.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s nostrils flared slightly as she exhaled, her eyes darkening with a new kind of understanding. She knew
        exactly what Agatha’s answer meant—the trust—the power she was offering up.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay,” Rio said softly, her voice low and steady. “Do you want me to get rid of the bag?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes dropped to the backpack—
   <em>
    of what was inside it
   </em>
   , and a wave of heat surged through her,
        this time flooding every nerve, pooling low in her abdomen. Her pulse quickened, and with another steady breath,
        she let go of the last thread of caution.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Fuck it.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “No.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio held Agatha’s gaze for a long, silent moment, as if giving her the chance to change her mind.
  </p>
<p>
   But when Agatha stayed silent, that feral smirk began to spread across Rio’s lips, her eyes darkening with a
        gleam that made Agatha’s breath catch.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay,” she murmured, reaching up and touching Agatha’s cheek with a gentleness that was a complete contradiction
        to her predatory look.
  </p>
<p>
   She swiped her thump a couple times across Agatha’s cheek, before taking a single, measured step back. She folded
        her arms across her body and tilted her head as she looked at Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “Open the bag,” she said, her voice low and steady—each word deliberate. “And take it out.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed, her pulse quickening, but she rose to the challenge, her fingers steady as she reached for the
        bag. She reached through the opening, her fingertips brushing against a smooth strap. She curled her fingers
        around it, lifting it from the bag, feeling the weight settle into her hand as she pulled it free.
  </p>
<p>
   As Agatha lifted it from the bag, the strap-on caught the soft glow of the bedroom light, revealing every detail.
        A set of sturdy black leather straps with metal buckles glinting faintly under the light. Centered in a steel
        ring sat a sleek, black silicone dildo slightly curved, attached securely to the harness.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t a prude.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d used sex toys before.
  </p>
<p>
   Afterall, she had a perfectly reliable one in her nightstand right now.
  </p>
<p>
   But this—
   <em>
    holding it in her hand
   </em>
   , feeling the weight of it, was different.
  </p>
<p>
   As her fingers wrapped around it, and she took in its size, noting the thickness and length. She raised her eyes,
        arching a brow at Rio, and narrowed her eyes into a glare.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Above average
   </em>
   , my ass,” she snarked.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk deepened, completely unbothered, her eyes shining with amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why?” she drawled, raising a brow in challenge. “Worried you can’t take it?”
  </p>
<p>
   A flush crept up Agatha’s neck, her grip tightening slightly around the toy.
  </p>
<p>
   “Do you want me to throw this at you?” she shot back, voice dripping with sarcasm but also a legitimate threat.
        “Because it feels like you want me to throw it at you.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s grin only widened, a flicker of amusement dancing in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha shook her head slightly, looking down at the harness in her hand, examining the weight of it. She could
        understand the appeal—at least for herself. But something still nagged at her. She glanced back up, curiosity
        overcoming her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why do you even want to do this?” she asked, her tone genuine. “It’s not like you actually... feel anything from
        this.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio tilted her head, her smile turning thoughtful.
  </p>
<p>
   “I don’t feel anything when I’m inside you with my fingers, either, but that doesn’t stop me from wanting to do
        it...
   <em>
    over and over again
   </em>
   ,” she said softly.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha couldn’t fault the logic there.
  </p>
<p>
   Then, with a fluid confidence, Rio stepped forward and took the harness from Agatha’s hands, her movements so
        sure assured, it was clear she was familiar with the toy.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    That
   </em>
   realization stirred something in Agatha—a flicker of jealousy, a wondering about the other women
        who might have been here before her, who have been in the exact position.
  </p>
<p>
   But before Agatha could even process it, Rio took her hand, guiding her fingers to the back of the harness where
        the base of the dildo connected. She pressed Agatha’s fingers to a small, textured ridge there, her touch
        steady, intentional.
  </p>
<p>
   “You feel that?” Rio asked, her voice low.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded, her voice barely above a whisper.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes.”
  </p>
<p>
   “When I’m wearing it, this part lines up just right,” Rio murmured, her gaze locking onto Agatha’s, her voice
        thick with promise. “So that I feel it too.”
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh,” Agatha murmured, understanding dawning in her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   It made more sense now.
  </p>
<p>
   She swallowed, feeling the weight of the it all settle around her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio placed the harness back in Agatha’s hand, a quiet, deliberate move that left no doubt: the power, the choice,
        was quite
   <em>
    literally
   </em>
   in her hands.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could feel the quiet intensity of Rio’s gaze, waiting, unyielding, giving her all the space to decide.
  </p>
<p>
   When Agatha finally looked up, Rio’s voice was soft but steady, direct as ever.
  </p>
<p>
   “What do you say, Agatha?” Her voice dropped, her words a whisper that seemed to curl through the room. “Will you
        let me wear this and fuck you?”
  </p>
<p>
   The bluntness, the unwavering confidence in Rio’s tone, struck Agatha hard. By now, she should have been used to
        Rio’s directness, but somehow, it still took her breath away, cutting through every last defense she thought she
        had.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s pulse hammered as she held Rio’s gaze, and after a beat, she found her voice.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes.”
  </p>
<p>
   The word was barely out before Rio’s mouth claimed hers in a fierce, consuming kiss, giving no space for doubt or
        hesitation.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s hands moved instinctively to Rio’s shoulders, fingers digging in as she pulled her closer.
  </p>
<p>
   They tumbled back onto the bed, Rio settling on top of her, the strap momentarily pressing between them. But as
        Rio’s tongue swept into Agatha's mouth, Rio reached between them, grabbing the harness and tossing it aside,
        fully pressing her body into Agatha’s, chest to chest —heat to heat.
  </p>
<p>
   Their mouths collided again, and Agatha’s mind spun as Rio’s hands tangled in her hair, tugging just the way
        Agatha loved.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio practically devoured her—biting, licking, leaving Agatha breathless and wanting more.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha barely had time to process the intensity of the kiss before Rio pulled back, hovering just inches above,
        lips wet, breaths heavy, her dark eyes practically black with desire.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio smirked, and without a second’s pause, ducked down, her mouth attacking Agatha’s neck, trailing heated kisses
        and bites, her lips finding that one sensitive spot that made Agatha’s breath hitch.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes slammed shut, and moaned, the sound vibrating in the space between them.
  </p>
<p>
   Somewhere in the whirlwind, her shirt and bra had vanished, and in the next blur of movement, Rio shed her own.
  </p>
<p>
   Their bare skin was pressed together, and the heat radiating from Rio’s body as their chests met was like fire.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s fingers found Rio’s back, digging into the firm muscles, feeling them flex under her touch as Rio worked
        her over, mouth and hands relentless, winding Agatha tighter and tighter until every nerve was raw and exposed.
  </p>
<p>
   And it was in that moment, Agatha knew—
   <em>
    she’d never get used to this.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The feel of Rio’s skin against hers, the way Rio knew exactly how to unravel her, leaving her feeling helpless.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s mouth moved lower, her lips and teeth working over Agatha’s breasts with an intensity that left her
        gasping, every bite, every lingering kiss drawing Agatha deeper and deeper into the haze of need.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s hands fisted in the sheets as Rio continued, leaving her skin marked and tingling, leaving a roadmap
        down Agatha's body where her mouth had been.
  </p>
<p>
   Then she felt Rio’s hands slip to her hips, fingers hooking into the waistband of her pants.
  </p>
<p>
   On instinct, Agatha lifted her hips, surrendering fully as Rio dragged her pants and underwear down in one smooth
        motion.
  </p>
<p>
   A cool wave of air washed over her, her skin erupting in goosebumps as she lay there completely bare.
  </p>
<p>
   There was a moment—one of complete silence—and Agatha looked up, her breath catching at what she saw.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyes roamed over her naked body, taking her in with a hunger that was almost palpable.
  </p>
<p>
   She shivered, her skin alive, hyper-aware of every inch that Rio’s gaze touched.
  </p>
<p>
   It was in that moment, Agatha became acutely aware of the precision of how Rio’s mind worked. The way Rio could
        remember every detail with crystal clarity, even years later.
  </p>
<p>
   And now, as Rio’s eyes roamed over her, Agatha couldn’t shake the thought that Rio was purposely committing every
        freckle, every scar, every inch of her to memory, imprinting her completely onto that beautiful brain of hers.
  </p>
<p>
   But it wasn’t just a look, either.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    It was the way
   </em>
   Rio looked at her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio stared at Agatha with an intensity that was almost reverent.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched, the weight of Rio’s gaze making her feel utterly bare, not just in her body but in her
        soul.
  </p>
<p>
   Just then, Rio’s eyes snapped up to meet hers, locking them in place, and in that split second, something
        flickered across her face.
  </p>
<p>
   It was something Agatha hadn’t seen before—a softness, an unguarded tenderness that looked an awful lot like...
  </p>
<p>
   And then in a blink of an eye it was gone, as Rio moved, almost diving between Agatha’s legs with a determination
        that left no room for Agatha to process that look any further.
  </p>
<p>
   Her mouth found its mark, landing exactly where Agatha needed her most, and the moan that tore from Agatha’s lips
        was primal, raw, her body arching off the bed as Rio’s mouth worked her over with an intensity that bordered on
        worship.
  </p>
<p>
   Usually, Rio made her wait—made her beg, teased her until she was right on the edge, but tonight was different.
  </p>
<p>
   Tonight, Rio was relentless, her tongue working over Agatha with expert precision that showed no sign of
        stopping.
  </p>
<p>
   Then, just as Agatha thought she couldn’t take any more, she felt Rio’s fingers slip inside her, filling her and
        then a second later already working inside her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s hands snapped down to Rio’s hair, and her legs wrapped around her, heels pressing in Rio back, pulling
        her closer as she practically screamed at the sheer intensity.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio didn’t pause.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t ease up.
  </p>
<p>
   Those unrelenting fingers curled just right inside Agatha and her tongue flicked over her clit with perfect
        precision.
  </p>
<p>
   And the combination sent Agatha spiraling over the edge, her release hitting her like a fucking car crash.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Fuck!
   </em>
   ” Agatha groaned, her voice ragged, thighs trembling around Rio’s head as waves of pleasure
        bombarded her body.
  </p>
<p>
   Her hands tightened in Rio’s hair to the point it had to be painful, but Agatha was barely aware, as every nerve
        ending in her body felt like it was on fire.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, after what felt like an eternity of toe-curling, breath-stealing orgasm, Rio pulled away, leaving Agatha
        sagged and limp against the mattress.
  </p>
<p>
   Her breaths came fast and uneven, her head spinning as she tried to make sense of the overwhelming sensations
        still coursing through her.
  </p>
<p>
   She had never come so quickly or so hard in her life.
  </p>
<p>
   It left her feeling like she couldn’t catch her breath, her body still trembling as the aftershocks rippled
        through her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha shut her eyes, focusing on grounding herself, trying to steady her pulse as her heart beat frantically in
        her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   She was dimly aware of movement at the foot of the bed, feeling the mattress dipping and releasing as Rio
        shifted, but the intensity of her orgasm had left her so overstimulated that she could barely process what was
        happening to her own body, let alone what was happening around her in the room.
  </p>
<p>
   After what felt like minutes but was probably only a few seconds, Agatha finally began to regain control over her
        body. Her senses slowly returned, sharper now—and she picked up on a faint sound that tugged at her attention.
  </p>
<p>
   A light metallic clink, then the unmistakable pop of a lid opening, followed by the quiet squirt of liquid.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    What the hell?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Her curiosity snapped her out of her haze. Agatha lifted herself onto her elbows, her gaze tracking to the source
        of the sound and—
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Holy hell.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha had barely reclaimed her breath, and now it was stolen from her all over again.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d imagined the strap-on might look ridiculous on Rio, a part of her half-expecting to laugh the first time
        she saw it, because, well—it was a rubber cock strapped to her body.
  </p>
<p>
   Need she say more?
  </p>
<p>
   But now, as Agatha laid there, watching as Rio stood at the foot of the bed, leather buckles secured around her
        hips, the dildo standing at attention, what should have looked absurd instead looked—hot.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Really fucking hot.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha’s mouth went dry.
  </p>
<p>
   And to make it worse—
   <em>
    or
   </em>
   better , she wasn’t sure—
   <em>
    Rio was fucking stroking it
   </em>
   , coating it in
        what looked like lube, and the sight, the sheer confidence and intensity of Rio’s hand working the lube into the
        silicone, ignited something deep in Agatha’s core.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio froze mid-stroke, her hand stilling as if she could feel Agatha’s gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   Slowly, she looked up, meeting Agatha's eyes, her head tilting slightly, a smirk ghosting over her lips as her
        dark eyes locked onto Agatha's.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk only deepened as she turned fully toward Agatha, moving with a steady, predatory grace. She climbed
        onto the bed, her movements fluid, calculated, as the mattress dipping beneath her weight.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes couldn’t help but zero in on the way the strap-on swayed between Rio’s legs, with each shift of her
        hips, and the sight sent another ripple of heat through her, making her body ache, clenching around nothing but
        anticipation.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio moved with a slowness, crawling up Agatha’s body, her gaze never leaving Agatha’s face. The air between them
        was thick, almost humming, and Agatha could feel every inch of space Rio claimed.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, Rio settled between Agatha’s legs, her weight resting just enough to tease, their bodies barely touching
        but close enough for Agatha to feel the firm press of the silicone against her inner thigh.
  </p>
<p>
   The anticipation was electric, Rio’s body hovering just above her, radiating heat and power.
  </p>
<p>
   Then, Rio took Agatha’s hand and guided it down, wrapping her fingers around it. Their eyes held, and in that
        shared look, Agatha understood exactly what Rio wanted.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha inhaled a shaky breath, her pulse quickening as she took control, aligning Rio with herself.
  </p>
<p>
   Slowly, she moved, guiding Rio forward.
  </p>
<p>
   The anticipation thrummed between them, a tension that snapped the second they connected —as she felt Rio press
        into her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched, her hand snapping up and gripping Rio’s arm.
  </p>
<p>
   The stretch was
   <em>
    intense
   </em>
   , a mix of pleasure and pressure that had Agatha gasping, her fingers tightening
        on Rio’s arm.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s thumb traced over Agatha’s jaw, her expression fierce yet soft, a contrast that made Agatha’s heart
        stutter.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could feel the control in Rio’s body the way she slowly eased into her, eyes tracing over Agatha’s face as
        if watching for any hint of discomfort, any flicker of hesitation.
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t painful, not at all—Rio had made sure of that, with the lube and the way she’d already pushed her over
        the edge, almost as if priming her for this.
  </p>
<p>
   But this...
   <em>
    this was fucking intense.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It was a fullness that was almost too much, and it sent shocks of sensation through her with each inch.
  </p>
<p>
   She felt Rio’s hand slipped from her chin, and move down to her neck, the touch light.
  </p>
<p>
   “You look good like this,” Rio murmured, her voice dark and rough, each word coiling tension through Agatha’s
        body, making her pulse race and clench around the length stretching her more and more.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath stuttered as Rio pressed deeper, her movements slow, as though savoring every second.
  </p>
<p>
   She squeezed her eyes shut, overwhelmed by the intensity, by the way Rio was filling her so completely.
  </p>
<p>
   “Like what?” she managed, her voice barely above a whisper, almost desperate.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio moved again, each inch deliberate, until she was fully inside her, hips flush against Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   And then hand moved around Agatha’s neck, fingers pressing on each side firm—
   <em>
    possessive
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    That
   </em>
   had Agatha’s eyes flying open, meeting Rio’s gaze pinning her in place.
  </p>
<p>
   The intensity in Rio’s eyes left no room for escape—no space for anything but the raw, consuming moment hanging
        between them.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Like you’re mine
   </em>
   ,” Rio growled, her voice a deep, possessive rumble—and before Agatha could even
        process the words, Rio rolled her hips back, thrusted deeply, forcing the air from Agatha’s lungs, as raw,
        breathless moan reverberated from Agatha's lips.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s mouth descended then, swallowing every sound, every gasp, each roll of her hips radiating a single
        intent—to claim Agatha completely.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Body and soul
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had no idea how long they’d been at it.
  </p>
<p>
   Everything blurred together—Rio pinning her to the bed, twisting her into every position imaginable, tearing one
        orgasm after another from her until she was nothing more than a breathless, trembling heap in the middle of her
        bed.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio wasn’t faring much better, which gave Agatha a flicker of satisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
   She knew every time Rio came, the way Rio would moan, hiss and growl, as she thrust into Agatha at just the right
        angle—providing that grind in just the right way that sent her over the edge.
  </p>
<p>
   Now, they lay tangled together, both struggling to catch their breath, bodies drenched in a sheen of sweat.
  </p>
<p>
   Even the thought moving felt impossible, let alone of going another round.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha was sprawled on her stomach, her cheek pressed into the mattress, barely able to keep her eyes open, when
        she heard movement behind her.
  </p>
<p>
   The soft rustle of straps being undone, followed by the dull thud of silicone hitting the floor.
  </p>
<p>
   "Just give me a minute for my legs to start working, and I’ll leave," Rio's voice came, low and rough with
        exhaustion.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha managed a grunt in response, summoning what little strength she had left to turn her head and look at her.
  </p>
<p>
   It was wasted effort it seemed, as her was vision blurred by the mess of her own hair and she cursed under her
        breath, too drained to even reach up and brush it aside.
  </p>
<p>
   But then, she felt Rio’s hands on her, carefully pushing the hair away from her face, clearing her view bit by
        bit.
  </p>
<p>
   The room came back into focus.
  </p>
<p>
   As did Rio, who was staring at her with a tenderness that was starting to be less and less a surprising as she
        smoothed her hair back.
  </p>
<p>
   “Can’t have you suffocating under there,” Rio teased, laying on her side, facing Agatha. “My DNA is all over this
        bed.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha shot her a dry look.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s flashed her a tired grin, as her fingers lingered brushing a stray lock back behind Agatha’s ear.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t pull her hand away.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, her gaze stayed on Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha caught it again—
   <em>
    that look
   </em>
   —but this time, Rio didn’t blink away.
  </p>
<p>
   It lingered, as if Rio wasn’t even aware she was doing it.
  </p>
<p>
   It was hard to describe the way Rio was looking at her.
  </p>
<p>
   No one had ever really looked at her like this before.
  </p>
<p>
   Like she was someone worth seeing—all the way through.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Whatever
   </em>
   that look was, it reached somewhere deep inside Agatha, a place she hadn’t realized was
        untouched, unguarded.
  </p>
<p>
   This look on Rio’s face—
   <em>
    it did something to her.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Something she couldn’t quite name, but felt all the same, a warmth spreading through her chest that softened
        edges she thought she’d hardened for good.
  </p>
<p>
   She needed to stop this, because Agatha couldn’t allow herself to get used to that look.
  </p>
<p>
   They both knew what this was.
  </p>
<p>
   So, she did what she always did—she deflected.
  </p>
<p>
   “How many gold stars did that performance get me?” she asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm, snapping Rio out
        of whatever had taken over her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio blinked, her hand snapping back, that look vanishing as if she’d realized what Agatha was doing.
  </p>
<p>
   A tired, wicked smile replaced it.
  </p>
<p>
   “At least a couple,” she replied, falling back into the game.
  </p>
<p>
   “A couple?” Agatha huffed, feigning outrage as she glared up at her without a hint of real heat. “That last
        position alone should’ve been worth at least three. I’ll be feeling that in my
  </p>
<p>
   back for days.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio arched an eyebrow, a tired smirk tugging at her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   "If your back’s the only thing sore, then I clearly didn't do what I set out to do tonight,” she teased, her
        voice still holding a rough, playful edge.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let out a exhausted laugh, the sound rolling out, husky and low.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    That ache
   </em>
   she felt was definitely going to follow her for a couple of days.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio didn’t need to know that though.
  </p>
<p>
   Closing her eyes to avoid Rio’s gaze, she exhaled deeply, letting the exhaustion settle over her like a warm,
        heavy blanket.
  </p>
<p>
   The room fell into a thick, comforting quiet, and Agatha let herself sink deeper into the silence, her eyelids
        heavy.
  </p>
<p>
   But when she opened her eyes again a few moments later, they widened slightly as she realized Rio had drifted off
        beside her.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked... peaceful.
  </p>
<p>
   Her usual smirk was gone, her face soft and unguarded in a way Agatha had never seen before.
  </p>
<p>
   She looked...
   <em>
    beautiful
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   That familiar ache was back in Agatha’s chest, and Agatha fought against the urge to smack Rio awake with a
        pillow just to get this feeling out of her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn't.
  </p>
<p>
   But she should still wake her up—they didn’t do sleepovers.
  </p>
<p>
   They had always maintained that clear line between them.
  </p>
<p>
   But even still, Agatha felt a strange reluctance to wake her up.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s own exhaustion was pulling her under, and she knew Rio would wake up eventually and slip out, leaving
        before dawn crept over the city.
  </p>
<p>
   So, she let her eyes drift closed, telling herself there was no harm in letting Rio stay.
  </p>
<p>
   Just this once.

   Chapter Notes
   <p>
    A lot of you have been asking for a Rio POV in the comments. Unfortunately, I do not plan on changing the POV for this story. It will stay Agatha POV from beginning to end. Once this story is finished, I do plan on writing a long one-shot from Rio's POV from the beginning to the end of this story, so you guys can't get a glimpse into her mind in every chapter.
   </p>
<p>
    I hope you enjoy this chapter. My outline had to be adjusted, so peep the extra chapter added. Don't be surprised if the expected chapters keeps bumping up. I have the outline completed, and some future chapters already written, but it is hard to squeeze everything I want into some of these "planned" chapter without it feeling rushed. I want to respect and maintain the pacing that I have built.
   </p>

Agatha slept well.
   </p>
<p>
    She always did after a night with Rio, but this sleep felt different—deeper, more restful, as though some quiet peace had settled over her.
   </p>
<p>
    She stirred slightly as a delicate tickling sensation danced across her nose, pulling her from the depths of sleep. Breathing in deeply, she was greeted by the rich scent of earth and pine— fresh, and unmistakably reminiscent of a forest after rain.
   </p>
<p>
    A smell she immediately recognized.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes snapped open, and her vision was met with black, silky strands of hair.
   </p>
<p>
    It dawned on her with a start that her face was buried in the back Rio’s neck, her body curled up against her back. Agatha’s arms were wrapped securely around Rio’s middle, and she felt the gentle rise and fall of Rio’s breath against her chest, their legs tangled together beneath the soft sheets.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s froze for a moment, before pulling her head back and looking at the back of the woman’s head with wide eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    She was not one for cuddling.
   </p>
<p>
    She liked her space in bed, the freedom to stretch out without feeling trapped or smothered. And yet here she was, her body pressed tightly against Rio’s, her arms wrapped around her in what could only be described as a near-death grip.
   </p>
<p>
    She tightened her grip, half-consciously, realizing how oddly natural it felt.
   </p>
<p>
    In response to Agatha's tightened grip, Rio let out a deep, contented sigh, her body melting further into Agatha’s embrace. Without even seeming to wake, Rio’s thumb absently grazed along Agatha’s arm, a slow, gentle motion before stilling and falling back into the deep sleep.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart clenched at that, a wave of something warm and unsettling washing over her.
   </p>
<p>
    Her mind raced, but her body refused to move, torn between instinctively pulling away and savoring the quiet, unfamiliar comfort of having Rio in her arms
   </p>
<p>
    She felt Rio’s slow, steady breathing against her, grounding her in a way that made everything else fade—her walls, her rules, her carefully guarded heart.
   </p>
<p>
    This wasn’t supposed to happen.
   </p>
<p>
    They didn’t do this.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Agatha didn’t do this.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    And yet...
   </p>
<p>
    This felt dangerously good.
   </p>
<p>
    Heavy emphasis on
    <em>
     dangerous.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    With that unsettling thought, Agatha took a steadying breath, then reached forward and gave Rio’s shoulder a gentle shake.
   </p>
<p>
    "Rio, wake up," Agatha murmured, her voice low and steady, not wanting to startle her—but needing to end this before it went too far, before the urge to stay became overpowering.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio grumbled in her sleep, a soft, reluctant sound that somehow made Agatha's heart lurch again.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha had always pictured Rio as a morning person—someone who seized the day the instant she opened her eyes. Yet here she was, wrapped around Agatha, heavy and completely out of it. The realization stirred something warm in her chest, and Agatha gritted her teeth, frustrated by her own reaction.
   </p>
<p>
    "Rio, seriously," she said, louder this time, shaking her shoulder with more intent. "You're lying on my arm. I can't feel it.
    <em>
     Get up
    </em>
    ."
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn't stir immediately, but then, in an instant, Agatha felt her shift as awareness flooded her, her muscles tensing and then—
   </p>
<p>
    Rio shot up, sheets pooling around her waist, bare-chested.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes instinctively moved down.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Can you blame her?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    But then she forced her eyes up, taking in Rio’s face as dark eyes moving around the room, as the woman was trying to will it to be her own, before her gaze moved down, landing on Agatha, her expression stunned.
   </p>
<p>
    Her mouth dropped open slightly, genuine surprise flickering across her face.
   </p>
<p>
    Even with the tangle of emotions stirring in Agatha’s chest, the side of her that delighted in poking at Rio couldn’t resist the opportunity. She leaned back, one brow arching, letting a sly smile play on her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Good morning, darling
    </em>
    ,” she purred with exaggerated warmth. “Did you sleep well?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio blinked, regaining her composure almost immediately, though a faint blush dusted her cheeks,
    <em>
     and God
    </em>
    —Agatha reveled in that.
   </p>
<p>
    “I didn’t mean...” Rio started, her words faltering as she searched for what to say. She took a breath, her face smoothing back into a neutral mask so quickly it was almost unnerving.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt a pang of disappointment at how easily Rio regained control, shutting down whatever vulnerability had slipped through. The sheer strength of her emotional guard was almost terrifying.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m sorry,” Rio said, the words so steady and practiced they barely registered as an apology. She held Agatha’s gaze for a brief moment before glancing away, sweeping the sheets aside and standing up.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio scanned the floor for her scattered clothes, grabbing her pants and slipping them on before turning to find her bra and shirt.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shifted, feeling the awkwardness of just sitting there watching Rio hurriedly get dressed. She climbed out of bed herself, wincing as her muscles ached.
   </p>
<p>
    As Rio pulled her shirt over her head, Agatha’s gaze caught on something lying on the floor: the strap-on, the source of the lingering ache between her legs. She reached down, suppressing a grimace as her body protested, and picked it up.
   </p>
<p>
    When Rio finally pulled her head through her shirt, she froze, her eyes widening just slightly as she took in the sight of Agatha—standing there naked, holding the strap-on aloft with tip of her finger a teasing smirk.
   </p>
<p>
    “Don’t forget your toy,” Agatha sang, her tone laced with playful challenge.
   </p>
<p>
    She knew she was pushing it, but honestly, she wasn’t a fan of the blank-faced, overly composed version of Rio. She needed that spark back, the one that made Rio’s expressions dance on the line between control and intensity.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes met hers, lingering for a second before they dragged down, slowly, tracing the lines of Agatha’s bare body. Agatha noticed the way Rio’s jaw tightened, a flicker of tension
   </p>
<p>
    slipping through her carefully constructed mask.
   </p>
<p>
    First crack.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Good
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha smirked, enjoying the moment, letting her own gaze stay steady, challenging. She felt a surge of satisfaction as Rio’s composure wavered, her hand balling into fists at her side, as trying to hold back the temptation to touch.
   </p>
<p>
    But Rio took a breath, visibly reining herself back, slipping the strap-on from Agatha’s finger with a practiced nonchalance, though her eyes held a darker gleam.
   </p>
<p>
    “Thanks,” Rio said, her voice steady, though Agatha caught the flicker of heat simmering just beneath her words.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha savored it—the subtle shift, the way she could unsteady Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    She remembered the first time they met, how she wanted to unravel this woman, to see her break. Now, that desire had transformed, evolved into something deeper, something that thrived on the challenge of making Rio falter, to push her just as hard as Rio pushed her.
   </p>
<p>
    She took a step closer, watching as Rio’s posture tightened, her breath hitching almost imperceptibly, a sharp exhale betraying the tension simmering between them.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha, completely bare, while Rio stood fully dressed—a dynamic that should make Agatha feel vulnerable, but in that moment, she felt so fucking powerful.
   </p>
<p>
    She reached up slowly, giving Rio every chance to pull away, to stop her, to say anything that would end this silent dare. But Rio stayed still, waiting, eyes darkening with anticipation.
   </p>
<p>
    With deliberate slowness, Agatha hooked her fingers under Rio’s chin, tilting her face up in that familiar way Rio so often did to her. The power shift was electric, a charged echo of every moment Rio had held her there before, but this time, it was Agatha’s turn.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned in, watching as Rio’s eyes fixed on hers, unwavering, and stopped just shy of letting their lips meet, savoring the hitch in Rio’s breath that spilled against her own.
   </p>
<p>
    “You should get going,” she murmured, voice low and teasing. “Your boss doesn’t seem like the type that tolerates being late.”
   </p>
<p>
    She caught the brief flick of Rio’s tongue over her own lips, and it took every ounce of restraint not to close the distance, to taste her right then and there. But instead, Agatha straightened, locking eyes with Rio one last time, a wicked grin playing at her lips before she released her hold, stepping back.
   </p>
<p>
    Without another word, she turned and strolled toward the bathroom, every inch of her aware of Rio’s gaze, the heat from her stare lingering over her bare skin, igniting every nerve as she walked away.
   </p>
<p>
    At the bathroom door, Agatha paused, glancing back over her shoulder, a wicked smile playing at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “Unless, of course... you somehow manage to make your boss late with you,” she murmured, her tone a soft, dangerous tease. “Then she can’t really punish you for that...now can she?”
   </p>
<p>
    She held Rio’s gaze, letting the words hang in the charged silence, her challenge unmistakable, before disappearing into the bathroom, leaving the door just barely open.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stepped into the large glass shower, twisting the handle until the water cascaded down, a heavy, soothing rhythm that drowned out any hint of sound from beyond the bathroom door. She let the warmth seep into her muscles, easing away the lingering tension from last night.
   </p>
<p>
    Her thoughts drifted back to Rio, to the silent challenge she’d left hanging in the air, knowing the ball was now in Rio's court.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio could easily walk out the door.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha wouldn’t be surprised—maybe disappointed, but she’d understand.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio wasn’t the type to stay, not when she wore that armor of control, that air of detachment. There was a hardness to her, a perfectly sculpted mask of someone who could have anyone, then walk away without a second thought.
   </p>
<p>
    She seemed to embody the phrase
    <em>
     fuck them and leave them
    </em>
    with her rules, her tight grip on every emotion, her ability to separate action from feeling like it was nothing.
   </p>
<p>
    But then Agatha remembered how Rio had looked at her last night, that dark intensity in her eyes, as if every feeling Rio kept locked away had found its outlet in that moment.
   </p>
<p>
    The way she’d claimed Agatha, her touch possessive, as if needing to imprint every inch of her into memory. But there was a contrast to it too—the brutal passion followed by the almost reverent gentleness—that left Agatha feeling as if she’d glimpsed two versions of Rio, locked in constant battle of how she wanted to treat Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     That Rio
    </em>
    , the one who seemed torn between control and vulnerability, had imprinted herself deeper than Agatha wanted to admit.
   </p>
<p>
    And so, she couldn’t help but wonder —
    <em>
     which
    </em>
    Rio would respond to her challenge?
   </p>
<p>
    The Rio who needed to be in control would leave, would prove that she was the one calling the shots, that no one could unsettle her.
    <em>
     That Rio
    </em>
    would walk out, leave Agatha with ache between her legs, a reminder that she’d been there but wouldn’t be held.
   </p>
<p>
    But the other Rio...
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s pulse quickened at the thought, her chest tightening with anticipation.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Other Rio
    </em>
    , the one who held her with quiet tenderness after the intensity, the one who looked at her like she was something precious—that Rio affected Agatha in ways she didn’t want to name, in ways that made her ache for something she hadn’t even known she wanted.
   </p>
<p>
    As the steam thickened around her, Agatha caught the faintest sound—a soft, almost hesitant creak from beyond the bathroom door. She held her breath, the warmth of the water paling against the heat simmering in her chest, anticipation prickling her skin.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, a few seconds later, the glass shower door opened, and Agatha turned, momentarily breathless at the sight before her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stood there, bare and beautiful, her dark eyes locked onto Agatha’s, filled with a blend of intensity and something softer, unguarded. She stepped into the shower, her gaze never wavering, a hesitant smile playing at the corners of her mouth before she deadpanned.
   </p>
<p>
    "You couldn’t have asked me to join you before I got dressed?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart fluttered at that, a smile breaking across her lips as Rio closed the distance, sliding her arms around Agatha’s waist and pulling her close under the stream of water. Agatha brought her hands up, fingers tracing over Rio’s shoulders before threading through her now-damp hair.
   </p>
<p>
    “Now, Rio,” she murmured, voice a low hum as her nails raked gently along Rio’s scalp, her lips hovering just a breath away. “Where’s the fun in that?”
   </p>
<p>
    She leaned in, her lips brushing over Rio’s in a teasing whisper before deepening the kiss, feeling Rio huff against her, exasperated yet smiling as she kissed back, her grin never leaving, until she pulled back abruptly and looked at Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio reached up, her fingers trailing softly along Agatha’s face, tracing the steady paths where water streamed down her skin. Her touch was reverent, lingering, her gaze filled with a raw intensity that Agatha could feel down to her bones.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” she whispered, voice barely audible above the rush of water. “
    <em>
     What are we doing?
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath caught, her pulse quickening as she met Rio’s gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stared back at Rio, momentarily speechless.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was asking
    <em>
     her
    </em>
    ?
   </p>
<p>
    As if Agatha had the answers, as if she knew what they hell they doing.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She didn’t have a fucking clue.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She opened her mouth to speak, to say something, anything, but the words tangled in her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    Suddenly her heart lurched painfully, betraying her, the weight of feelings she’d been keeping at bay crashing forward, flooding her chest, threatening to spill out in ways she wasn’t ready to face.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shut her mouth, swallowing hard, forcing those unruly emotions back down.
   </p>
<p>
    She couldn’t bring herself to say it, to admit how Rio had begun to burrow past the casual, past the physical, into something she hadn’t wanted to name.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She was terrified
    </em>
    —terrified of exposing the truth of what this was becoming for her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha could give Rio power over her body—but her heart?
   </p>
<p>
    That is where she drew the line.
   </p>
<p>
    So, Agatha did what she always did when emotions threatened to consume her—she ran.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She is where Nicky got it from.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The urge to retreat, to push back when feelings got to intense.
   </p>
<p>
    But instead of rushing out of the shower, she ran back to the beginning—back to the simplicity of how it was when they started this game and and what she desperately needed them to continue to be.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha slid her hands down to Rio’s hips, applying just enough pressure to guide her back, one slow, deliberate step at a time, until Rio’s back pressed firmly against the wall, her body caged by Agatha’s.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio watched her, eyes moving across her face—searching,
    <em>
     waiting
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha held Rio’s gaze, a fire simmering in her own, before slowly, deliberately, dropping to her knees.
   </p>
<p>
    And in an instant— that vulnerability Rio had shown moments ago vanished.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes hardening, guarded—reading Agatha’s move for what it was.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha answered Rio’s question not with words, but with actions.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     This was about sex.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    That’s what it started as, and that’s what it needed to stay.
   </p>
<p>
    She had to keep it simple, keep it controlled.
   </p>
<p>
    After all, Rio had set the rules.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Don’t fall in love with me.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    That is what Rio had said to Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha had understood then, and she reminded herself now—if feelings got involved, she’d end up breaking Rio or vice versa—
    <em>
     Rio would destroy her
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    So, she dropped her gaze from Rio’s eyes—pushing down that ache in her chest, and leaned forward, her mouth moving between Rio’s legs, feeling Rio’s moan ripple through her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s fingers tightened in her hair, her breath coming in quick, uneven bursts, but Agatha focused on her own control, on the movement, on the rhythm. She ignored the whispers in her mind, the pull in her heart that wanted more, that wanted the impossible.
   </p>
<p>
    Because this—
    <em>
     this was safer.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    This was familiar.
   </p>
<p>
    This was what they both needed.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Nothing more.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    They were late to work. Rio, naturally, arrived even later, having to stop by her own apartment first. Agatha briefly considered making a show of Rio’s near-hour-late entrance— she could almost see the look on her face—but thought better of it. After all, Agatha was the reason for Rio’s tardiness.
   </p>
<p>
    When Rio finally slipped into the war room, she moved seamlessly, prepping files for the trial, and everything seemed to fall back into place.
   </p>
<p>
    Or so Agatha thought.
   </p>
<p>
    But as the day went by Agatha started noticing something unsettling.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was still Rio—sharp, quick-witted, with that cocky edge—but something felt off.
   </p>
<p>
    Her smiles seemed dimmer, her teasing—forced.
   </p>
<p>
    And most noticeable, and something Agatha zeroed in on immediately, Rio had stopped doing something that had always set Agatha on edge:
    <em>
     she no longer looked her.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It took Agatha 5 minutes during a prep meeting for voir dire to notice it.
   </p>
<p>
    And once she noticed it, it was glaring.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha made it through nearly an hour in the war room without once feeling Rio’s gaze on her. Rio took notes, flipped through documents, spoke to her as if everything were perfectly normal—but didn’t look up.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Not once.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Then there was the most glaring sign that something was wrong.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio hadn’t touched her.
   </p>
<p>
    No casual graze of a hand.
   </p>
<p>
    No slipping into her space, daring Agatha to react.
   </p>
<p>
    And most importantly—
    <em>
     no sex.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    At first, Agatha thought it might be a game. Maybe Rio was keeping her on edge, building tension so that the next touch, the next moment, would be all the more intense.
   </p>
<p>
    But then one day slipped to one—then two, and then three.
   </p>
<p>
    And then last night happened.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha decided to take matters into her own hands and asked for Rio to come over.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She actually fucking asked.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    And she watched the moment Rio read her message.
   </p>
<p>
    And then—it just sat there
    <em>
     just like that.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Nothing but silence.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She fucking left Agatha on read.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha would love to think she didn’t stare at that message for ten straight minutes, willing a reply to appear. She’d like to pretend she didn’t toss and turn in bed
    <em>
     all night
    </em>
    , jolting awake at every phantom vibration, only to find nothing but silence staring back at her.
   </p>
<p>
    The next morning, Agatha felt every restless minute of her sleepless night weighing her down.
   </p>
<p>
    She’d slept like shit.
   </p>
<p>
    And now, she stood gripping the countertop, leaning over it with a heavy sigh, fighting the urge to check her phone.
   </p>
<p>
    But the urge won out.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned her head and stared down at it, finally reaching over, tapping the screen to bring it to life. Her fingers moved automatically, entering her code and opening her messages.
   </p>
<p>
    Her message to Rio still sat there, unanswered, glowing up at her mockingly.
   </p>
<p>
    A painful lurch twisted in her chest, sharper and more unsettling than anything she’d ever felt with Rio before.
   </p>
<p>
    This wasn’t the usual thrill or tension she could lean on to keep her somehow both on edge and steady.
   </p>
<p>
    Instead, this was a raw, anxious ache coiled inside her, making her stomach flip. Her hand came up instinctively, pressing against her chest, and she felt her heart hammering beneath her fingertips, each beat pulsing with that unfamiliar, relentless ache.
   </p>
<p>
    She let out a sharp breath, and ripped her hand from heart like she was burnt and flipped her phone over, as if
    <em>
     that
    </em>
    could somehow make the feeling go away.
   </p>
<p>
    It didn’t.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha looked up, meeting her own gaze in the mirror.
   </p>
<p>
    As she stared at herself, the anxiety in her chest shifted, hardening, transforming into something hotter.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Anger
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was playing a dangerous game.
   </p>
<p>
    With a very dangerous woman.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha was a storm from the moment she stepped into the office. The office’s Defcon levels rose steadily with each passing hour. By midday, they were at Defcon 3—multiple associates hiding tears behind closed doors, Jen glaring at her from behind the safety of her glass door, and Billy visibly trembling every time he entered her office.
   </p>
<p>
    The only person unfazed, of course, was the one she most wanted to crack.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio barely batted an eye when Agatha shredded her meticulously crafted witness preparation report, throwing it back with a scathing remark about her “sudden lack of competence.”
   </p>
<p>
    Then, Agatha nearly threw her a stack of contracts into Rio’s hands—tasks she’d usually hand off to a contract specialist, given how grueling the work was. And not only that, she demanded they be completed by the end of the day, fully aware it was an impossible deadline.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio only frowned slightly at the pile in her hands, and Agatha didn’t miss the way her gaze lingered somewhere over her left shoulder, deliberately avoiding eye contact.
   </p>
<p>
    As Rio turned and walked back to the war room without a word, Agatha felt her jaw tighten, her teeth grinding as irritation flared inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned her chair away, staring out at the city skyline, her fingers tapping restlessly against the armrest. She barely managed twenty seconds of silence before a knock tapped on the glass behind her. Already bristling, she snapped, “WHAT?” before even turning around, only to find Billy standing there, swallowing nervously.
   </p>
<p>
    “Your reservation at Carmine’s with Summit Ventures is confirmed for 7:00 PM. I just wanted to check if you still wanted the emergency call set for an hour into the meeting?”
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Summit Ventures
    </em>
    —Agatha had almost forgotten.
   </p>
<p>
    The annual client meeting with her absolute least favorite group. Not because they engaged in any worse behavior than the average investment firm—they were plenty ethically questionable actions, but no more so than the rest.
   </p>
<p>
    The real issue was the team itself: a pack of overgrown frat boys who inevitably got drunk and spent the night making passes at her.
   </p>
<p>
    Her own personal nightmare.
   </p>
<p>
    That’s why she’d established a longstanding plan with Billy: an “emergency” call precisely one hour in. For five years running, they hadn’t caught on. By the time she made her exit, they’d always be too blissfully drunk to notice.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha was about to confirm the usual plan when, out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Rio in the war room, brow furrowed as she stared down at a stack of contracts. Agatha could see she wasn’t struggling, per se, but Rio was clearly out of her element, and the frustration showed on her face.
   </p>
<p>
    A thrill sparked in Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Good.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    If Rio wanted to play with her emotions, then Agatha would return the—
   </p>
<p>
    —suddenly, an idea struck her, bringing a wicked smile to her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    She remembered the look Rio had given her when she was casually flirting with a bartender back at the Red Light when they went to that drag night looking for Kelcie Baker. She remembered the dark, possessive look that marred Rio face that screamed that the woman didn’t know if she wanted to fuck Agatha right then and there or punch the bartender in the face.
   </p>
<p>
    And that had been
    <em>
     before
    </em>
    they’d ever slept together.
   </p>
<p>
    The thrill that shot through her now was almost enough to overpower the ache Rio had left her with after ignoring her message.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned back to Billy, who had stopped in his tracks, wide-eyed at the sudden wicked smile on her face. He’d seen that look enough to know it meant T-R-O-U-B-L-E.
   </p>
<p>
    “No,” she said. “No call this time. I think it’s time I give my full attention to Summit Ventures.”
   </p>
<p>
    Billy blinked, visibly thrown off but nodded. He turned to leave, but Agatha held up a hand, stopping him.
   </p>
<p>
    “Tell Rio Vidal she’ll be attending the client meeting with me,” Agatha said smoothly, picking up a random sheet of paper on her desk and feigning interest in it. “The contracts can
   </p>
<p>
    wait till tomorrow. It’s time she gets her feet wet in client relations.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha heard Billy leave and pretended to study the already-approved report in her hand, holding the act for a few seconds before dragging her gaze up toward the war room.
   </p>
<p>
    Billy was standing in front of Rio, speaking to her, and Agatha didn’t miss the exact moment he mentioned the client meeting. Rio’s posture shifted, her shoulders stiffening, and after a heartbeat, she flicked her gaze toward Agatha’s office.
   </p>
<p>
    And for the first time in days, Rio met her eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha—refused to look away. She held Rio’s gaze, tilting her head slightly and jutting her chin forward.
   </p>
<p>
    The look she gave Rio said it all.
   </p>
<p>
    You want to play? Then put a fucking helmet on, because this is going to be a rough ride.

From the moment Agatha met Rio Vidal, it was as if she’d been set on a path— a road crafted to challenge her at every turn.
   </p>
<p>
    The first forced her to confront her own sexuality, a part of herself she’d long buried in shadows, never believing it would come to light.
   </p>
<p>
    Then came the test of control, surrendering pieces of herself to someone else, allowing Rio to push her beyond her preconceived limits.
   </p>
<p>
    She’d barely made it through those first two trials. But once she’d cleared them, the freedom and peace she discovered on the other side made every moment of turmoil worth it.
   </p>
<p>
    It was as though this road was giving her parts of herself she hadn’t known were missing.
   </p>
<p>
    And now, as she stood outside the dark wooden door marked with a golden number 4, she recognized the weight of the next trial.
   </p>
<p>
    Just like before, she knew she had a choice—face it or turn around and walk away.
   </p>
<p>
    But this one— Agatha could feel it in her bones —was different.
   </p>
<p>
    This trial was bigger than the others, more dangerous , and if she was honest with herself, far more terrifying.
   </p>
<p>
    Every step on this road felt like she was gambling a part of herself.
   </p>
<p>
    And this one?
   </p>
<p>
    This one had the power to completely unravel her.
   </p>
<p>
    To break her in ways she’d never risked before.
   </p>
<p>
    As she stood there, staring at that unassuming golden number on the door, her heart hammered, and for the first time in a long time, Agatha felt genuinely afraid. It wasn’t just her pride or her carefully constructed walls at stake.
   </p>
<p>
    It was her entire sense of self, everything she had worked to build and protect.
   </p>
<p>
    And now, she was on the edge of a precipice, facing a choice that could either deepen the peace she’d found within herself—or destroy it entirely.
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha made her decision last night. There was no backing down. Sink or swim, she was doing this.
   </p>
<p>
    And with that thought, Agatha squared her shoulders and moved to raise her hand to knock, only to realize with a frustrated sigh—that her hands were full.
   </p>
<p>
    She rolled her eyes at herself, mentally kicking herself for her own lack of foresight.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck it,” she muttered, straightening up.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, with a quick flick of her leg, she rapped the toe of her boot against the door in a few sharp, determined knocks.
   </p>
<p>
    And then—she held her breath.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
      12 hours earlier.
     </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha’s emotions were like jagged shards of glass, sharp and relentless, cutting deeper with every second she spent beside Rio in the back of the town car. Rio didn’t so much as glance her way. Instead, she sat stiffly, her body angled away, fingers absently tracing the hem of her sleeve.
   </p>
<p>
    It was as if the air around Agatha had grown toxic and Rio couldn’t bear to breathe it.
   </p>
<p>
    By the time they arrived at the restaurant, the silence was so thick it felt suffocating. Not a single word passed between them as they were led to their table, nor as they took their seats. Rio’s eyes roamed everywhere but toward Agatha, and her face was a perfect, unreadable mask.
   </p>
<p>
    When the server finally approached, breaking the silence, Rio ordered a water, her voice calm and detached.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s chest tightened.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’ll have a double bourbon,” she said smoothly, her tone masking the raw edge she felt inside.
   </p>
<p>
    As the server left, Agatha kept her gaze fixed on Rio, who seemed suddenly engrossed in the menu, her eyes skating over the options with a practiced indifference. She didn’t flinch, didn’t so much as react to the way Agatha’s eyes bored into her.
   </p>
<p>
    This was a game, Agatha reminded herself—a game Rio had chosen to play. And if Rio thought she could keep Agatha at arm’s length and leave her questioning, raw and aching, she was sorely mistaken.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha unable to help herself, leaned back, folding her arms, her voice dropping to a low, dangerous.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s impressive,” she murmured, “how committed you are to pretending I’m invisible.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio barely flinched, but Agatha saw the subtle signs—the tight clench of her jaw, the way her fingers gripped the edges of the menu just a bit harder.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha wanted to push further, but the loud, brash laughter from the front of the restaurant pulled her attention away. Her eyes darted instinctively toward the source of the noise. She recognized it immediately. Five men walked in, their voices filling the space as they made their way toward the dining area.
   </p>
<p>
    The founding members of Summit Ventures.
   </p>
<p>
    Each of them was dressed in sharp, tailored suits, their hair and beards perfectly groomed. They were handsome, in that polished, almost-too-perfect way—if you didn’t know them, you might think they were the kind of men Agatha would be interested in. But she knew better.
   </p>
<p>
    They were absolute assholes.
   </p>
<p>
    Three out of the five wore wedding rings, and those three were the worst offenders—always the first to hit on her, with an overconfident smirk and a line that felt like it belonged in a frat house.
   </p>
<p>
    At the sound of laughter, Rio’s head lifted, her gaze following Agatha’s to the group of men approaching their table. Agatha watched Rio’s face as she took them in, reading them with those sharp, dark eyes, immediately sizing them up and seeing them for what they were. Then, just as quickly, her gaze snapped back to Agatha’s, and for once, she held her eye.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t flinch, meeting Rio’s gaze head-on, her expression unyielding, confirming what Rio must have suspected.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Yes
    </em>
    , her eyes and smug smirk seemed to say,
    <em>
     that’s why I brought you here.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha saw the moment Rio understood.
   </p>
<p>
    She waited, expecting that familiar spark of anger to flicker in Rio’s eyes, for that dark possessiveness to ignite, to rise to Agatha’s challenge.
   </p>
<p>
    But instead, a second passed, and then another. Rio’s expression didn’t harden or flash with anger.
   </p>
<p>
    Then Rio blinked, and something shifted—a quiet, raw hurt settled behind her eyes, unguarded and vulnerable, stealing the breath from Agatha’s lungs.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Oh
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt the realization hit her_._
   </p>
<p>
    She hadn’t expected that.
   </p>
<p>
    She’d anticipated anger, maybe even a defiant spark or a subtle challenge.
   </p>
<p>
    But this?
   </p>
<p>
    This flicker of hurt, so raw and unguarded, caught Agatha entirely off guard. It lingered in Rio’s gaze, as if, just for a moment, Rio lost that iron grip over her emotions. And once it slipped free, she couldn’t push it back behind her usual emotionless mask.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, Agatha’s mind went blank.
   </p>
<p>
    She had orchestrated this whole setup as a way to push Rio, to make her feel the tension she’d been feeling, to draw out some reaction. But she hadn’t accounted for the possibility that her little game might cut deeper than she intended.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her pulse quickening as she took in Rio’s expression.
   </p>
<p>
    Abruptly, Rio looked away, reclaiming her control piece by piece as her mask slid slowly back into place.
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha found herself at a loss of words. She still parted her lips to speak—though what she intended to say, she couldn’t quite grasp. Her heart hammered against her ribs, each beat urging her to tell Rio to leave, to go home.
   </p>
<p>
    She wasn’t needed here.
   </p>
<p>
    First-year associates didn’t attend client meetings, and Agatha had only brought her along to force her hand, to draw her into this twisted game. She made a mistake by asking Rio to come here.
   </p>
<p>
    But her hesitation became her downfall.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha!” a voice called from across the restaurant, and the Summit Ventures men spotted her, their voices loud and brimming with confidence as they strode toward the table. Agatha forced herself to look away from Rio, swallowing down the emotions that threatened to rise, and slipped on her professional mask as she stood to greet them.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stood as well, though the men’s attention was locked solely on Agatha, grins plastered on their faces as they approached. Each one went in for a hug, which Agatha reluctantly accepted, masking her discomfort with a carefully measured smile. One of the more forward men leaned in, pressing an all-too-familiar kiss to her cheek, punctuated by a wink as he pulled back and took his seat.
   </p>
<p>
    She managed a polite smile, but every nerve in her body buzzed with irritation—and somewhere beneath it, that ache in her chest where Rio’s pain now lived.
   </p>
<p>
    The dinner went exactly as Agatha had expected. Business talk was minimal, confined to a few perfunctory remarks about the upcoming quarter and vague mentions of “big
   </p>
<p>
    opportunities.” Drinks, on the other hand, flowed freely, with each man ordering another round as soon as his glass was even halfway empty.
   </p>
<p>
    With each refill, their voices grew louder, their laughter sloppier, and their tongues looser. Compliments became more brazen, slipping from polite to suggestive, punctuated by looks that lingered a little too long and gestures that edged just past appropriate.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha kept her smile carefully measured, her gaze level, deflecting the comments with practiced ease. It wasn’t her first Summit Ventures dinner, and it wouldn’t be the last. But tonight, with Rio seated beside her, silent and observing, every comment grated just a bit more.
   </p>
<p>
    She could feel Rio’s presence, her quiet watchfulness. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught the way Rio’s jaw tightened each time one of the men leaned a little too close or let his hand brush Agatha’s arm. Yet, Rio stayed silent, her expression unreadable, offering no reaction beyond that simmering tension just beneath the surface.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s own irritation flared with each passing moment, her patience wearing thin. She had thought bringing Rio here would spark something—a reaction, a confrontation, something— but now, it was a test of endurance, each second stretching longer as she navigated the dinner and tried to ignore the ache lingering just beneath her ribs.
   </p>
<p>
    Suddenly, Rio rose from her seat, murmuring a quick, polite excuse before heading to the bathroom. Agatha’s gaze followed her, the ache in her chest growing with every step Rio took away from the table, like a storm building within her.
   </p>
<p>
    Then she caught it—a flicker of movement as one of the men leaned back in his chair, his eyes following Rio’s departure, lingering shamelessly on the curve of her ass.
   </p>
<p>
    Something inside Agatha snapped, a hot, possessive anger flaring to life and consuming the ache that had been simmering just beneath her ribs.
   </p>
<p>
    She clenched her jaw, forcing herself to keep her expression neutral, though she could feel her pulse racing, every instinct screaming to put him in his place. She took a slow, deliberate breath, her eyes narrowing as she turned to the man, her voice steady but cold.
   </p>
<p>
    “Is there something particularly interesting about my associate’s departure?” she asked, her words laced with an edge sharp enough to cut.
   </p>
<p>
    The table went silent, the laughter and casual remarks evaporating as Agatha’s words sliced through the air. The man she’d called out raised his hands in mock surrender, a smirk tugging at his lips as he gave her a look that all but say, c
    <em>
     an you blame me?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha’s fingers curled into fists beneath the table, the urge to wipe that smug expression off his face pulsing through her. If these men didn’t collectively manage a portfolio worth fifty million dollars, she wouldn’t have hesitated.
   </p>
<p>
    Instead, she kept her expression cool, her eyes fixed on him with a warning that said enough. After a moment, the man cleared his throat, a slight blush creeping up his neck as he quickly
   </p>
<p>
    reached for his glass, avoiding her gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    The rest of the table shifted awkwardly, some of the men exchanging glances—not expecting Agatha to call them out. She never had before.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha fought to steady her emotions, but control was slipping through her fingers.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Oh...how the tables had turned.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She’d brought Rio here tonight to provoke her, to make her jealous, maybe even possessive. Yet here she was, seething with the urge to tear that man apart for daring to look at Rio like that.
   </p>
<p>
    With a tight breath, she tossed her napkin onto the table.
   </p>
<p>
    “Excuse me, gentlemen,” she murmured, standing and striding away from the table, her steps quick and purposeful. But as she neared the bathroom, her pace slowed, the reality of Rio’s presence on the other side of the door suddenly pressing down on her.
   </p>
<p>
    She hesitated just outside, fingers flexing at her sides. She could still feel the men’s eyes on her from across the restaurant, watching, expectant. She couldn’t exactly turn back now. Gritting her teeth, she pushed the door open and stepped inside.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t know what she was about to walk into, but the moment her heels clicked from wood to tile, she froze.
   </p>
<p>
    The door swung shut behind Agatha with a soft thud, cutting off the restaurant’s noise and leaving her enveloped in a silence that felt thick, pressing, almost suffocating.
   </p>
<p>
    Her heart pounded, every nerve on high alert, as her eyes landed on Rio, standing at the sink, dabbing carefully beneath her eyes with a tissue. Rio looked up, catching Agatha’s reflection in the mirror. Her eyes widened briefly before she quickly looked away, crumpling the tissue in her fist.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was... she was crying.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart didn’t just lurch—it felt like it cracked open, the sharp pain so unexpected it left her paralyzed, as if her blood had turned to ice.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio...” she started, but her voice trailed off, the words slipping away before they could fully form.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s jaw clenched, a flush rising to her cheeks as she looked anywhere but at Agatha, clearly not expecting her to walk in and definitely not wanting to be seen like this.
   </p>
<p>
    “Don’t give yourself too much credit,” Rio murmured, her voice soft but echoing in the quiet room. “This isn’t just about you—I’m just...frustrated with myself. That’s all.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s mind went blank. She didn’t know what to say, didn’t know if she even remembered
    <em>
     how
    </em>
    to speak. She stood there, frozen, staring at Rio like a complete fucking idiot.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, she managed to snap out of it, but instead of replying, she reached into her purse, pulling out her phone. She unlocked it with a few quick taps, then brought it to her ear.
   </p>
<p>
    The moment the person on the other end picked up, she spoke, her voice quiet and steady.
   </p>
<p>
    “Bring the car around,” she said softly, then ended the call and slipped the phone back into her purse.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha took a step forward, her gaze locked on Rio, even as Rio tried to salvage the last shred of vulnerability she hadn’t meant for Agatha to see.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio,” Agatha said again, her voice steady this time, with no hesitation.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio surprised her by looking up, meeting her head-on.
   </p>
<p>
    “Go to the car,” Agatha said, not as a command but as a quiet offer, an out.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio sucked in a breath, clearly understanding what Agatha was giving her—a way to escape without saying a word. She stared at Agatha for a long moment, as if weighing her decision, before nodding.
   </p>
<p>
    She moved to step around her, but Agatha’s hand instinctively reached out, fingers pressing gently into Rio’s arm, stopping her by her side.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio kept her gaze lowered, but Agatha could hear the shaky breath that escaped her.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m sorry,” Agatha murmured, the words surprising even herself.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t apologize often.
   </p>
<p>
    To apologize meant admitting she was wrong, and Agatha prided herself on rarely—
    <em>
     if ever
    </em>
    —being wrong.
   </p>
<p>
    But here, she’d misread everything.
   </p>
<p>
    She hadn’t once even considered that Rio’s silence wasn’t some calculated game to mess with her but something Rio needed for herself, her own space to deal with whatever she was going through.
   </p>
<p>
    Her fingers softened against Rio’s arm, and for a long moment, Agatha simply stood there, heart heavy, torn between the urge to reach bring her closer and the instinct to let Rio go.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, Agatha lowered her hand, and it was as if that single gesture was all Rio needed. The moment her hand fell, Rio slipped away, crossing the room and disappearing through the door. The sounds of the restaurant flooded into the bathroom briefly, then faded again as the door swung shut, sealing Agatha back into the thick, pressing silence.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a heavy sigh, planting her hands on her hips and tilting her head back, staring up as if the answer to how she’d managed to mess this up so badly might be written somewhere in the ceiling tiles. She could be a self-centered piece of shit sometimes, and she
   </p>
<p>
    knew it. The moment Rio had gone quiet, she’d taken it as a personal affront, never once stopping to consider that maybe—just maybe—it wasn’t about her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     “What are we doing, Agatha?”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Rio’s question from that morning in the shower echoed in her mind, growing louder, taking on a haunting, almost ghostly presence that lingered in the silence of the bathroom.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned to the mirror, her gaze hardening as she took in her own reflection. Outwardly, she looked the same—impeccably put together, her sharp suit pristine, her makeup flawless. But beneath that polished exterior, she could see the cracks, the strain she worked so hard to hide. Her heart hammered against her ribs, pulsing with a relentless urgency that seemed to echo through her entire body, demanding her attention.
   </p>
<p>
    She let herself really look this time, she saw the tension in her jaw, the faint shadows beneath her eyes, the guarded look she gave even to herself. This was more than just exhaustion; it was the weight of choices and regrets.
   </p>
<p>
    And as she stood there, Agatha couldn’t escape the feeling clawing its way to the surface—an insistence, almost a plea, urging her to confront the truth she’d been so carefully avoiding.
   </p>
<p>
    The thing between her and Rio was rapidly evolving into something else, something dangerous—feelings were getting involved. Clearly, based on Rio’s reaction these past few days, they already were. And, Agatha could admit, reluctantly, that it wasn’t one-sided.
   </p>
<p>
    But the real question was, what were they going to do about it?
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     What are we doing, Agatha?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    When she’d returned from the bathroom, she feigned being on a call, flashing the men an apologetic smile as she claimed she’d been called in for an emergency meeting. She’d handed her credit card to the waitress, instructing her to keep the tab open, which the men appreciated. Thankfully, none of them had tried to touch her as she left, likely remembering the warning glare she’d shot their way before excusing herself.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha made her way out of the restaurant toward her waiting town car. Dan was already there, holding the door open for her. She slipped inside, and he closed the door firmly behind her, sealing her into the quiet, confined space.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio sat next to her, eyes fixed out the window, her posture tense, clearly intent on ignoring Agatha’s presence.
   </p>
<p>
    Within seconds, the car pulled smoothly away from the curb, leaving the restaurant—but the unresolved tension was alive and well now in the back of the car.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s fingers tapped anxiously against her leg as she searched for a way to begin. How did one start a conversation with a
    <em>
     fuck buddy
    </em>
    turned... something more?
   </p>
<p>
    She found the words several times, her lips parting to speak, but doubt crept in each time, silencing her, uncertainty twisting her thoughts.
   </p>
<p>
    Minutes dragged on, the silence twisting inside Agatha like a knife wedged deep, each beat of her heart driving it further in. She could feel the weight of it pressing on her chest, and finally, unable to stand it any longer, she blurted out the first thing that surfaced.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio...” Her voice, softer and more vulnerable than she ever intended, sliced through the quiet.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s head turned slightly, just enough to show she was listening, though her gaze remained distant, her expression unreadable.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed, feeling her pulse hammering in her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio... please.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words were raw, stumbling out before she could catch them.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     That
    </em>
    got Rio’s attention.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned her head fully, her dark eyes finally meeting Agatha’s, piercing, unyielding. Agatha felt herself unravel under that gaze, and her usual defenses crumbled.
   </p>
<p>
    Their eyes locked, the weight of everything unspoken hanging between them, thick and suffocating.
   </p>
<p>
    “Just... tell me what to do,” Agatha whispered, a thread of desperation slipping into her voice.
   </p>
<p>
    She wasn’t just asking—she was
    <em>
     pleading.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Tell me what to do, and I’ll do it,” Agatha said, her voice breaking, the words spilling out with a rawness she could barely contain.
   </p>
<p>
    For once in her life, Agatha was completely out of her element. She didn’t know how to bridge this rapidly increasing gap between them. The fear of losing Rio, of having damaged something that had quietly, deeply rooted itself inside her, made her feel exposed in a way that utterly terrified her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio looked at her, her face softening, yet tinged with a sadness that cut straight through Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “I can’t, Agatha,” Rio said quietly, her voice almost a whisper. “I can’t tell you what to do, because I don’t know what to do either.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath hitched, the full weight of Rio’s words pressing down on her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was just as lost as her.
   </p>
<p>
    There was no script, no easy way forward.
   </p>
<p>
    They stood at the edge of something unknown, a place where power and control had no hold, a fragile, uncertain space that neither of them knew how to navigate.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha needed a sign, something to assure her that she hadn’t destroyed this beyond repair.
   </p>
<p>
    Slowly, hesitantly, she moved her hand forward, her fingertips brushing against Rio’s where it rested beside her. The contact was delicate, tentative—almost as if Agatha were questioning whether she even had the right to reach out.
   </p>
<p>
    But the instant Agatha’s fingers touched Rio’s, Rio clasped them tightly, her grip instinctive and fierce, as if she feared Agatha might pull away and slip out of reach.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a breath she didn’t even realize she was holding, as she held Rio’s hand back with just as much intensity.
   </p>
<p>
    They rode in silence, hands entwined, the quiet pressing around them. Agatha was acutely aware that they weren’t talking, weren’t solving anything—but they were still holding each other’s hand.
   </p>
<p>
    That had to mean something, didn’t it?
   </p>
<p>
    The stillness stretched on until Rio’s voice broke through it, low and almost detached.
   </p>
<p>
    “When people first hear how my mind works, they think it’s a gift,” she murmured, her gaze fixed somewhere distant, as if she were speaking to the air in front of her. “It really isn’t. I think... I think it’s a curse.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned to her, caught off guard by the statement that seemed to come out nowhere, but Rio didn’t look back.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha could see the tension in Rio’s grip, the way her fingers tightened as if she were holding on to Agatha’s hand as a lifeline, as if she needed it to keep going.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha squeezed back, silently urging her forward, waiting.
   </p>
<p>
    “When I was thirteen,” Rio began, her voice steady but laced with a strain, “my parents and I were driving back from one of my soccer tournaments. We were hit head-on by a drunk driver. My dad... he died instantly.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, a tremor passing through her voice.
   </p>
<p>
    “My mom, though... she was hurt badly. I could see her, but I couldn’t get to her—my legs were pinned.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s gaze drifted, as if the memory were pulling her back.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha watched as Rio’s free hand drifted to her knee, fingers tracing slow, restless patterns back and forth.
   </p>
<p>
    “Sitting here, in this car,” Rio continued, her voice soft, hesitant, like she was speaking from a place buried deep within, “I can feel it, like I’m back there all over again. The weight pressing down on my legs, the tightness in my chest... the panic clawing its way up, the helplessness...”
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice trailed off, and she pressed her head back into the leather seat, squeezing her eyes shut, her jaw clenched so tightly Agatha swore she could hear her teeth grinding.
   </p>
<p>
    “And I can still hear her breaths,” Rio gritted out, the words strained, as if they were physically painful to release. “Each one... so wet, so—
    <em>
     pained
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sucked in a quiet breath, her chest tightening in response to the raw pain laced in Rio’s voice.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Jesus.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Why was Rio telling her this? Why was she putting herself through the agony of reliving it?
   </p>
<p>
    A sharp ache bloomed in Agatha’s chest as a startling realization hit her—
    <em>
     she hated this.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Seeing Rio in pain, watching her struggle through memories that tore her apart piece by piece. Catching Rio quietly wiping tears away in the bathroom had been hard enough, but this... this was so much worse.
   </p>
<p>
    But Rio wasn’t finished. It was as if she were determined to reach the end, to push through this painful memory, as though it held something she needed Agatha to understand.
   </p>
<p>
    “My mom, she... she turned toward me,” Rio continued, her voice trembling, thick with emotion. “Even then, I could tell she was barely holding on. I knew—
    <em>
     somehow, I just knew
    </em>
    —that she was going to die. And there was nothing I could do to stop it.”
   </p>
<p>
    She swallowed hard, her jaw clenched as tears gathered in her eyes, shimmering in the dim light of the car.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s chest ached as she watched Rio struggle to hold back the flood of emotions, her grip tightening around Agatha’s hand in a borderline painful grip.
   </p>
<p>
    “And then,” Rio’s voice broke, barely more than a whisper now, yet so loud in the quiet car. “She told me... ‘
    <em>
     Close your eyes, mija
    </em>
    ,’ she said. ‘
    <em>
     Close your eyes and cover your ears. Can you do that for me, baby?
    </em>
    ’”
   </p>
<p>
    After the words crawled painfully out of her mouth, she shook her head, as if trying to shake the sound of her mother voice from her ears.
   </p>
<p>
    “I didn’t understand why she was asking me to do that,” she continued quietly, her voice trembling. “But I was terrified, so I did what she asked. I closed my eyes, covered my ears, and sat there in the back seat, surrounded by darkness and silence that felt like it would go on forever... while she died just five feet away from me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s chest tightened painfully, the weight of Rio’s words sinking deep.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s words lingered in the silence that followed, as if the weight of them took on a tangible presence, filling the car—pressing against them.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha held her breath, watching as the tears finally slipped form her eyes and down Rio’s cheeks, silent but devastating.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s throat tightened, as she felt the urge to say something, to reach out and wipe them away, to offer words of comfort, but nothing seemed adequate—she was trapped in this story just as much Rio was.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio took a shaky breath, wiping her cheek with the back of her hand, though her grip on Agatha’s hand didn’t loosen.
   </p>
<p>
    “It wasn’t until later, at the hospital that I realized why she told me to do that. She asked me to close my eyes and cover my ears,” Rio continued, her voice fragile, “because she knew I’d never forget the moment she died. She knew that memory would haunt me. So, she tried to shield me, even then. She died still trying to protect me—
    <em>
     protecting me from own mind
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart ached at the depth of Rio’s pain, her fingers tightening around Rio’s hand in silent support. This wasn’t just a story—this was Rio’s way of opening a door to her heart, showing Agatha something she kept hidden from everyone.
   </p>
<p>
    “After that, I learned to keep everything separate,” Rio said, her gaze distant, lost in the past. “To keep my eyes shut and my ears covered—to keep my emotions apart from the memories. It was the only way I know how to survive... to stop them from consuming me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha became dimly aware of the car slowing to a stop, catching a fleeting glimpse of Rio’s street outside the window, but she couldn’t tear her focus away from Rio. She was entirely caught up in the raw, unfiltered honesty spilling out before her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio hesitated, her hand tightening around Agatha’s, then loosening, then tightening again, as though she were battling with something buried deep.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha braced herself, sensing that whatever came next was going to be harder still—though she couldn’t imagine how Rio could possibly bear to share something more painful.
   </p>
<p>
    With a deep, aching sigh, Rio finally turned, lifting her gaze to meet Agatha’s. Her eyes shone with a vulnerability so raw that it made Agatha’s heart skip a beat.
   </p>
<p>
    And for the first time since she’d begun speaking, Rio looked her directly in the eye, and Agatha understood—whatever came next held everything Rio had been holding back.
   </p>
<p>
    “But I can’t keep my eyes closed with you, Agatha,” Rio whispered, her voice breaking, the words trembling on the edge of something raw and unguarded. Her gaze held Agatha’s, as if searching for a safe place to land.
   </p>
<p>
    She swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around Agatha’s as though trying to ground herself.
   </p>
<p>
    “It just hit me out of nowhere. And suddenly I...
    <em>
     I feel everything
    </em>
    ,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper, thick with emotion. “And I don’t know how to shut it off.”
   </p>
<p>
    The confession hung between them, raw and unguarded, a truth that reached deep, exposing wounds that had never fully healed.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio gave Agatha’s hand a gentle squeeze, her lips curving into a sad, bittersweet smile—and before Agatha could even process it, Rio was pulling her hand away. Agatha’s fingers twitched, the impulse to reach out, to hold on, almost overwhelming. She wanted to pull Rio’s hand back to where it felt like it belonged, but something in that smile, that quiet resignation, held her frozen. It was a smile that spoke of—
   </p>
<p>
    She realized with a start and Agatha sucked in a breath, panic tightening in her throat.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     No. No. No.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Completely oblivious to the panic rising in Agatha, Rio let out a ragged breath, her sad smile wavering, cracking at the edges.
   </p>
<p>
    “I don’t think we should see each other like this anymore,” Rio said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s world went still, her heart plummeting into a cold, hollow ache. Rio’s words settled over her like a lead weight, a punch that left her breathless.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know this isn’t what you signed up for,” Rio continued, her voice wavering slightly. “It wasn’t what I was expecting either. But this...”
   </p>
<p>
    She gestured vaguely between them, her hand falling away helplessly.
   </p>
<p>
    “I can’t...
    <em>
     I don’t know how to do this
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t think, couldn’t speak, couldn’t fucking breathe. Rio’s words seemed to echo in her mind, each one driving deeper, leaving her raw and defenseless. She opened her mouth, but nothing came out. Her throat felt tight, as if it sealed itself off.
   </p>
<p>
    She searched Rio’s face, desperate to find some hint of doubt, some sign that this was just a momentary lapse, something that could be fixed, salvaged. But Rio’s gaze was steady, painfully resigned, and it tore through Agatha in a way she hadn’t expected, hadn’t prepared for.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s insides twisted painfully, a voice screaming from somewhere deep within her,
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Just tell her! Just tell her you have feelings too. Tell her this isn’t a game for you, either.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her heart pounded, beating wildly against her ribs, demanding she do something, anything to keep Rio from walking away. Every nerve was on fire, the urge to close the gap, to reach out, to lay it all bare pounding through her veins.
   </p>
<p>
    But her lips stayed pressed tightly together, the weight of her pride, her fear, chaining her to silence. She could feel herself cracking under the pressure, every instinct screaming to speak up, to stop Rio from slipping through her fingers.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, she swallowed, forcing down the ache in her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio...”
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice trembled, her resolve slipping.
   </p>
<p>
    “I—”
   </p>
<p>
    But the words caught, tangled in all the walls she’d so carefully built. The truth lay just on the edge, a confession ready to be spoken, but she couldn’t get it out. Her hand hovered in the space between them, reaching, but afraid to close the distance.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Say it!
    </em>
<em>
     H
    </em>
    er mind roared, a desperate chant in her head.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Tell her you have feelings!
    </em>
<em>
     Tell her she’s more than you ever expected!
    </em>
<em>
     Tell her she matters!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    But all that came out was silence.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio held Agatha's gaze for a moment, her eyes darkening with a sadness that seemed to settle deep within her.
   </p>
<p>
    She took Agatha’s silence for exactly what it was, her shoulders slumping ever so slightly as she nodded, resignation washing over her.
   </p>
<p>
    Without another word, she reached for the door handle, fingers wrapping around it with a sense of finality that made Agatha’s chest ache.
   </p>
<p>
    “Good night, Agatha,” she murmured, her voice barely audible, soft and weighted with hurt.
   </p>
<p>
    And before Agatha could summon the courage to respond, Rio was slipping out of the car, leaving her alone in the silence, her unspoken words echoing painfully in the empty space where Rio had been.
   </p>
<p>
    Later that night, Agatha lay in bed, staring up at the dark ceiling, her mind replaying every agonizing moment of her conversation with Rio. The silence in her bedroom felt suffocating, thick with everything she hadn’t said, everything she’d let slip away. Her chest felt hollow, the ache sharper now in the quiet hours of the night, each regret slicing deeper.
   </p>
<p>
    She tried to push the memory back, but her mind clung to it stubbornly.
   </p>
<p>
    She could still see Rio’s eyes, filled with sadness and hurt, the finality in her voice as she’d said, “Good night, Agatha,” as if she were closing a door on them both.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     You should’ve just told her,
    </em>
    her mind whispered, relentless.
    <em>
     You should’ve just said it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha’s fists clenched in the sheets, frustration bubbling up inside her. She was Agatha Harkness
    <em>
     for fucks sakes
    </em>
    , a woman who never let anyone take control of her, who never faltered. Yet when it mattered, when she needed to let her guard down the most, she’d let her own fear and pride silence her. And now, lying alone in the dark, she felt the weight of that choice crushing down on her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     What are you so afraid of?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The question echoing in her head.
   </p>
<p>
    But deep down, she already knew the answer.
   </p>
<p>
    She was afraid of what Rio had unearthed in her, the vulnerability, the need, the feelings she’d long buried under layers of control.
   </p>
<p>
    But tonight?
   </p>
<p>
    Tonight, had shown her something else too.
   </p>
<p>
    Her walls didn’t protect her—they just left her more alone than ever.
   </p>
<p>
    Rolling over, Agatha buried her face in her pillow and wanted to scream into it, only to be hit by the unmistakable scent of forest and pine.
   </p>
<p>
    She froze, inhaling sharply, then reared back, staring down at the pillow as if it had attacked her. She’d washed the sheets, but not the pillows.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio had slept on this pillow, and it still smelled like her.
   </p>
<p>
    A wave of emotions crashed over her, tightening her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    She reached out, fingers brushing over the fabric as though if clinging to the remnants of Rio’s presence would ease the ache stirring inside her. But instead, the scent just made the loss feel sharper, more real, leaving her staring at the pillow in helpless frustration.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, suddenly, tears filled her eyes, hot and unwelcome, pooling with a frustration that ran bone-deep.
   </p>
<p>
    Not at Rio,
    <em>
     but at herself
    </em>
    —at her own stubborn pride, her own inability to say the things that mattered.
   </p>
<p>
    She swiped at her cheeks angrily, as if denying the tears could somehow erase the regret churning inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    But it was no use.
   </p>
<p>
    The ache in her chest swelled, pressing against her ribs, and she felt helpless under the weight of it. She’d let Rio slip away, let her silence push away the one person who’d ever made her feel something real.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s mind drifted back, replaying their time together, how Rio had disrupted her life in ways she’d never expected.
   </p>
<p>
    The very idea of being with a woman had once seemed absurd to her, like a door seealed shut. But Rio had blasted Agatha’s closet door right of the fucking hinges, bringing out a side of her she hadn’t even known existed.
   </p>
<p>
    And the thought of giving up control in the bedroom? Letting someone else lead? That had felt even more ridiculous... until Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    And now, the idea that this thing between them could be something more, something real— that notion seemed the most outlandish of all.
   </p>
<p>
    But somehow, against all odds, Rio made her want it.
   </p>
<p>
    As she laid there, staring at the pillow, new tears started to spill.
   </p>
<p>
    Hot.
   </p>
<p>
    Frustrated.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Angry.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    When had she become this hesitant, this unsure?
   </p>
<p>
    She’d built her life on bold moves, on taking exactly what she wanted without a moment’s hesitation. Second-guessing had never been in her nature.
   </p>
<p>
    Yes, she’d let Rio take the lead, allowed herself to surrender parts of herself she’d kept locked away. But that didn’t mean she had to stay on the sidelines, didn’t mean she had to let Rio dictate the terms of this... whatever it was between them.
   </p>
<p>
    She was Agatha
    <em>
     fucking
    </em>
    Harkness,
    <em>
     for Christ’s sakes
    </em>
    —a woman who’d built her reputation on control, on confidence, on always knowing exactly what she wanted and exactly how to get it.
   </p>
<p>
    She never waited, never hesitated, never let anyone force her by the hand.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s question echoed in her mind:
    <em>
     What are we doing, Agatha?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    But now, it twisted into something else, something more pointed and demanding.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     What are you going to do, Agatha?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
      Back to the present:
     </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha waited, her heart pounding with anticipation as she stood outside the door. A few moments passed in silence before she heard movement behind the door, followed by the soft click of locks being undone.
   </p>
<p>
    The door creaked open, and there stood Rio, blinking against the dim hallway light, clearly still half-asleep.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sucked in a ragged breath.
   </p>
<p>
    She was wearing a pair of skimpy sleep shorts that revealed miles of toned legs and a deep green T-shirt that read “
    <em>
     Pawnee Parks and Rec Department
    </em>
    .” Her dark hair was a mess, sticking out in every direction, and she rubbed at her eyes, eyes coming into focus on Agahta, before widening with shock.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Agatha
    </em>
    ,” Rio sighed, her voice thick with the remnants of sleep as she looked down at her watch, then back up, raising a brow in exasperation. Her gaze was piercing, even through her disheveled, sleepy expression.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s seven in the morning—
    <em>
     on a Saturday
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha offered a sheepish smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know. I couldn’t sleep.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio ran her hands through her hair messy locks, and threw Agatha a look.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, I was sleeping,” she murmured, but Agatha didn’t miss the faint shadows beneath her eyes, the way her shoulders held a tension that said sleep hadn’t come easily to her, either.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha held up a coffee cup.
   </p>
<p>
    “I brought you coffee,” she said, her voice softer than usual, knowing she would need this peace offering for the
    <em>
     still surprisingly
    </em>
    anti-morning Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio blinked, clearly caught off guard, and for a moment, she simply stared at the cup as if she couldn’t quite believe it. Then, slowly, she reached out, her fingers brushing lightly against Agatha’s as she took the cup, her touch sending a small thrill down Agatha’s spine.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio looked down at the familiar coffee shop logo, her eyes widening in surprise.
   </p>
<p>
    “You actually went into a coffee shop and ordered your own coffee?” she said slowly, as if she couldn’t believe the words coming out her mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes, though a faint blush crept into her cheeks.
   </p>
<p>
    “Just because I have an assistant who usually gets my coffee doesn’t mean I’m entirely helpless.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio hummed softly, as if she didn’t quite believe Agatha’s words but was willing to let it slide. She brought the cup to her lips, taking a slow, deliberate sip. Her eyes closed briefly as
   </p>
<p>
    she savored the first taste, a quiet, appreciative hum escaping her.
   </p>
<p>
    As Rio took another sip, her gaze softened, and for a brief moment, the guarded look faded from her eyes. She seemed to relax, her shoulders loosening, as if Agatha’s unexpected gesture had somehow dissolved a little of the tension lingering between them.
   </p>
<p>
    In the soft morning light, with Rio’s hair tousled and her guard lowered, Agatha couldn’t help but think she looked beautiful in that moment.
   </p>
<p>
    And then Rio’s gaze shifted from Agatha's face to the other thing in Agatha’s arms—a large, leafy potted plant, hard to miss.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha fought against the faint flush that threatened to creep up her neck as she adjusted the plant, holding it a little awkwardly in the crook of her arm before extending it toward Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    “I... I got you this too,” she said, attempting to keep her voice casual, though she could feel her composure slipping just a little.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio blinked, setting her coffee down on the small entryway table beside her before reaching out to take the plant. She looked down at it, her fingers tracing the elegant green-and-white leaves with gentle curiosity, her expression shifting to one of genuine surprise.
   </p>
<p>
    “Where did you get this?” Rio asked, her gaze flicking back up to Agatha, equal parts touched and suspicious.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha gave a nonchalant shrug, though she knew she wasn’t fooling anyone.
   </p>
<p>
    “At a flower shop downtown,” she replied, trying to sound like she hadn’t just jumped through an inordinate amount of hoops to acquire it.
   </p>
<p>
    “A flower shop that opens before sunrise—
    <em>
     on the weekend
    </em>
    ?” Rio said with disbelief clinging to every syllable, as she raised an eyebrow.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha hesitated, swallowing back her discomfort.
   </p>
<p>
    “The daughter of a client owns it. I, uh... called in a favor,” she admitted, her tone more defensive than she liked, but she didn’t like being called out.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio raised an eyebrow—and then, a faint smile curving her lips as she looked back down at the plant, then back up at Agatha, her eyes filled with something Agatha couldn’t quite place.
   </p>
<p>
    “This is a Monstera Albo Borsigiana,” Rio said, the mouthful of a name rolling off her tongue effortlessly.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown. She didn’t know the first thing about plants, let alone what this one was called. All she knew was that it fucking expense, and should be gold plated for what she paid for it.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Rio sighed, a mix of exasperation and amusement in her tone. “Did you just buy the most expensive plant in the store?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt her cheeks warm under Rio’s knowing gaze. She should have anticipated this reaction.
   </p>
<p>
    With a huff, she threw her hands up in mild exasperation, gesturing at the plant.
   </p>
<p>
    “Look, I don’t know anything about plants!” she practically exclaimed. “I figured I’d treat it like bourbon—the more expensive, the better it is.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s mouth quirked into a genuine smile, a small laugh escaping her. She glanced down at the plant, clearly touched, her fingers lingering on the leaves before meeting Agatha’s eyes again, softer now, and just a bit more open.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s gaze softened as she looked at Agatha, really looked at her, as if trying to piece together what was happening.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha—
    <em>
     what are you doing?
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha took a steadying breath, a sly smile creeping onto her lips as she leaned casually against the doorframe, trying to convey enough outward confidence that it convinced herself internally that she was doing the right thing.
   </p>
<p>
    "Oh. I am taking back my control,” she answered.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes went wide, surprise flashing across her face, as she looked at Agatha in shock.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re what?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha offered a casual shrug, though beneath the surface, her heart pounded, her emotions a tangled mess.
   </p>
<p>
    “I have feelings for you, Rio,” she admitted, her voice steady despite the storm inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    She watched as the words landed, seeing Rio’s eyes widen slightly, her breath catching in a way that felt like a small victory.
   </p>
<p>
    “And since both of us have been acting like complete idiots,” Agatha continued, a hint of determination sharpening her tone, “I’ve decided to take control of the situation.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio blinked, caught off guard, her fingers tightening at her side.
   </p>
<p>
    A mixture of surprise, uncertainty, and something else—
    <em>
     something vulnerable
    </em>
    —flickered across her face.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t help but feel a thrill of satisfaction at having left Rio momentarily speechless.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re taking control of the situation,” Rio repeated, drawing out each word with a smirk, before arching an eyebrow and giving Agatha a pointed look. “Just to confirm—
    <em>
     am I
    </em>
    the situation you’re planning to take control of?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips twitched, fighting back a grin as her confidence surged. She took a deliberate step closer, her gaze locked on Rio’s.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, Rio,” she replied smoothly, her voice low and sure. “
    <em>
     You are absolutely
    </em>
    the situation I’m planning to take control of.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes sparkled with a mix of surprise and—thankfully—something darker, her lips curving into a faint smirk as she set the plant carefully on the table beside her. Crossing her arms, she leveled Agatha with a look, a flicker of defiance lighting her gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    “You couldn’t have told me that last night?” she asked, a touch exasperated.
   </p>
<p>
    “Now where’s the fun in that?” Agatha deflected, raising an eyebrow playfully.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio narrowed her eyes, unimpressed. Agatha’s confidence wavered for just a second, and she took a breath, letting honesty cut through her tone.
   </p>
<p>
    “I was scared, okay?” she admitted. “But I went home, sorted out my shit, and here I am. And I even got you a pretty plant to make up for it.” She gestured to the monstera with a flourish.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio raised a brow, her expression softening. “I didn’t need the plant, Agatha. I wanted
    <em>
     you
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt her breath hitch, Rio’s directness catching her off guard in the best possible way. She hadn’t realized just how much she’d missed this side of Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, now you have me... and a plant,” she said, flicking her hands as if to say,
    <em>
     You’re welcome.
    </em>
    “Seems like a win-win to me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio raised a brow, letting the moment stretch out as her piercing gaze held Agatha in place. Finally, she sighed, the sound equal parts exasperated and amused.
   </p>
<p>
    “You are something else, you know that?” she said, shaking her head just slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s smirk returned, the confidence in her voice unmistakable.
   </p>
<p>
    “So I’ve been told.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio rolled her eyes, but a hint of a smile lingered on her lips as she reached forward, grabbing the lapel of Agatha’s jacket and pulling her close enough that their breaths met in air between them.
   </p>
<p>
    Just as Rio tilted her head, to close the remaining short distance, Agatha pulled back, just enough to keep Rio waiting.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s expression wavered, flickering with a hint of confusion as her eyes searched Agatha’s, uncertain yet intrigued.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt a thrill pulse through her, igniting every nerve as she lifted a mocking brow, leaning in closer.
   </p>
<p>
    “Ask,” she murmured, her voice a soft but steady command, brushing the words tantalizingly against Rio’s lips.
   </p>
<p>
    She felt the subtle hitch in Rio’s breath, the slight tremor that traveled through her as her fingers remained clenched around Agatha’s lapels, holding her close.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio let out a small, half-exasperated sigh, caught between irritation and amusement. She huffed against Agatha’s mouth, clearly both annoyed and unable to hide the faint smile breaking through.
   </p>
<p>
    “How about...” Rio murmured, her voice low, laced with a teasing defiance, as she reached up, her fingers sliding into Agatha’s hair, nails scraping deliciously along her scalp. She buried her hand in Agatha’s hair, holding her in that possessive way Agatha loved.
   </p>
<p>
    “How about no more rules,” she whispered, her lips brushing against Agatha’s.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sucked in a ragged breath, her heart pounding at the weight of those words—at what they promised, at what they meant. The thrill of it, of shedding every last barrier between them, sent a shiver through her, and she knew there was no going back.
   </p>
<p>
    “ Deal ,” she murmured, her voice barely audible.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, with a fierce, undeniable certainty, she closed the distance, sealing her words with a kiss that held nothing back—no more rules, no more hesitation, just raw, unfiltered want.
   </p>
<p>
    And in that moment, everything else faded, leaving only the heat of the mouths pressed together and the thrill of stepping fully into the unknown.
   </p>
<p>
    She had completed another trial, stepped through it, and felt a piece of herself she hadn’t known was missing slot firmly into place. With each step forward, she found herself becoming something more, something fuller, as if this path were shaping her in ways she’d never anticipated.
   </p>
<p>
    This road would test her— she knew that much.
   </p>
<p>
    What lay ahead was uncertain, a mystery she couldn’t yet solve. But for now, she was exactly where she wanted to be.
   </p>
<p>
    And for now—that was enough.

```
If someone had told Agatha that at nearly fifty years old, she’d be spending her entire Saturday tangled up in sheets, being thoroughly ravished by a woman sixteen years her junior, she’d have laughed them out of the room—and then probably sued them for defamation later.
   </p>
<p>
    And yet, here she was.
   </p>
<p>
    Face down on forest green silk sheets, her hair and skin damp with sweat, gasping into the fabric, as her legs trembled beneath her as yet another orgasm tore through her, leaving her breathless and spent.
   </p>
<p>
    She felt warm lips press into her shoulder, and then— there it was —the unmistakable smirk against her skin, that fucking smirk that seemed to sear right into her flesh. Rio Vidal was branding her with it, marking her the way a rancher brands their cattle—with an air of quiet, undeniable ownership.
   </p>
<p>
    Then she felt a hand tracing down her spine, each fingertip pressing slowly, deliberately, as if counting every vertebra, moving lower over the curve of her ass and lingering there, before daring to dip further and slide forward. Agatha’s body reacted faster than she thought possible, exhaustion forgotten, as she snapped her hand back, gripping Rio’s wrist firmly.
   </p>
<p>
    And then in one swift, fluid motion, Agatha rolled, flipping Rio onto her back and pinning her there, straddling her with an intensity that left no room for question. The wrist still caught in her hand was pressed firmly above Rio’s head, while Agatha’s other hand wrapped gently around Rio’s neck—a soft but unmistakable warning.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes widened in surprise for a fleeting moment before that smirk returned, even deeper than before, as she looked up at Agatha with a glint of satisfaction, clearly savoring this unexpected shift in control.
   </p>
<p>
    “Do you have an off button somewhere?” Agatha growled, her gaze roaming over Rio’s glistening skin, now covered in a constellation of hickeys and marks from Agatha’s own teeth and nails.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio chuckled, a low, throaty sound that Agatha could feel vibrate against her hand.
   </p>
<p>
    “Maybe. Check between my legs,” Rio murmured, her voice a teasing purr.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha snorted at that, but that didn’t stop her from increasing the grip on Rio’s wrist and throat slightly, leaning down until their faces were mere inches apart.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re exhausting, you know that?” Agatha muttered, though the glint in her eyes betrayed her amusement.
   </p>
<p>
    “Pot calling the kettle,
    <em>
     dear
    </em>
    ,” Rio shot back smoothly, a wicked smile curving on her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha looked down at her, arching an eyebrow.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio—
    <em>
     dear
    </em>
    . If I don’t get something to eat and drink...” Agatha began, her voice tinged with warning.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio opened her mouth, a glint in her eyes revealing exactly the kind of dirty response she had in mind.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha clicked her tongue, tightening her grip just enough around Rio’s throat to cut the words off before they could escape.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Actual
    </em>
    food,” Agatha bit out, her tone sharp but laced with a smirk, before loosening her grip once more, but not letting go.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s devilish smirk faded into a reluctant pout, but after a moment, she softened, giving a small nod.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha started to pull her hand away, but Rio’s fingers caught hers, guiding it back to her throat and pressing it there, her gaze sparking again, like a fire that never really goes out.
   </p>
<p>
    “We’ll be exploring this later, though,” Rio murmured.
   </p>
<p>
    For a split second, Agatha’s thoughts scattered, her focus dissolving as she felt the warmth of Rio’s throat beneath her hand, Rio’s dark eyes fixed on her, filled with something that made Agatha’s pulse race.
   </p>
<p>
    The thrill of this unexpected role reversal sent a surge of excitement through her veins, and she couldn’t deny how absolutely beautiful Rio looked beneath her with her fingers wrapped possessively around Rio’s throat.
   </p>
<p>
    “Or now?” Rio teased, breaking Agatha from her thoughts.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, suddenly aware that her fingers had tightened instinctively, and Rio’s smirk only widened. That knowing glint in her eyes told Agatha she understood
    <em>
     exactly
    </em>
    where her mind had drifted.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha, never one to pass up the chance to toy with her prey, leaned down, capturing Rio’s lips in a kiss that started slow but quickly turned heated. She deepened it just enough, letting
   </p>
<p>
    her teeth graze Rio’s lower lip, savoring the little moan that escaped her.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, with a wicked smile, Agatha pulled back, watching the flicker of frustration in Rio’s eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    “No,” she murmured, her voice dripping with playful finality. “I’m hungry.”
   </p>
<p>
    Before Rio could pull her back, Agatha loosened her hold on Rio’s throat and rolled off, leaving her sprawled across the bed. Settling herself against the headboard, Agatha leaned back with a self-satisfied smirk, watching Rio with that teasing glint in her eyes, fully aware of the effect she was leaving behind.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio groaned loudly, not sparing Agatha a single glance as she swung her legs out of bed and strode out of the bedroom.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s gaze immediately zeroed in on her, trailing up Rio’s bare back and catching sight of the deep, red claw marks running down her shoulder. She felt a surge of satisfaction mixed with surprise.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Jesus.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She didn’t even remember making those marks, though, in fairness, the entire day had been a blur. They’d been at it for
    <em>
     God knows how long
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    With Rio gone from the room, leaving no distractions—no smirk, no hands, no teasing remarks—Agatha let herself breathe, her mind finally catching up to the whirlwind that had been their morning and now afternoon. She sat back against the headboard, staring absently at the empty doorway, feeling the magnitude of what was unfolding between them settle in.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     They were actually doing this.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    No games, no rules, no hidden agendas.
   </p>
<p>
    Just two consenting adults, tangled up in something that felt more real than anything Agatha had allowed herself to feel in years. She couldn’t quite believe it—that she’d let herself cross this line with Rio, with feelings involved, no less.
   </p>
<p>
    This could go two ways: either really, really good, or—
    <em>
     God
    </em>
    —it could go so, so bad.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt the weight of that thought settle over her, the uncertainty twisting in her stomach.
   </p>
<p>
    Not only that—here she was, trying to navigate what could very well be the first
    <em>
     real
    </em>
    relationship of her life—not only with a woman, but with someone sixteen years younger than her, and, just to complicate things further, her
    <em>
     employee.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It was madness.
   </p>
<p>
    Complete and utter madness.
   </p>
<p>
    Her therapist was going to have a field day with this.
   </p>
<p>
    She heard footsteps approaching, and then Rio was there, holding out a bottle of water. Agatha took it, watching as Rio crawled into bed beside her, eyes quietly assessing, a hint of something
    <em>
     more
    </em>
    in her gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    “Want me to order in, or would you rather go out?” Rio asked, her voice casual, but her eyes searching Agatha’s with a loaded intensity.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha fought against the urge to react to that—to keep her face impassive.
   </p>
<p>
    It was a simple question on the surface, yet it carried so much more weight.
   </p>
<p>
    Going out together—just the two of them, outside the familiar confines of work or the bedroom—was uncharted territory. Up until now, they had worked, they had fucked, and that had been the extent of it. Even the night they’d spent together at the gay club could be excused as just another part of their complicated work life as they searched for a lead on the Vanguard case.
   </p>
<p>
    But this?
   </p>
<p>
    This was different.
   </p>
<p>
    And judging by the way Rio held her gaze, she knew exactly what she was asking:
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Are we keeping this behind closed doors or what?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha’s mind raced, her thoughts colliding as she considered the implications of Rio’s question.
   </p>
<p>
    Going out together, where anyone might see them, where their dynamic would stretch beyond the confines of their familiar walls—was she ready for that?
   </p>
<p>
    It felt like peeling back another layer, acknowledging this thing between them in a way that wasn’t just between them but open to the world.
   </p>
<p>
    And yet, the thought didn’t scare her as much as it should have.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     God.
    </em>
<em>
     This really is madness.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Never one to show her cards too easily, Agatha forced a smirk, leaning back as if perfectly at ease.
   </p>
<p>
    “I think I need some fresh air,” Agatha drawled, casting a wry glance around Rio’s impeccably styled, plant-filled apartment. She gestured toward the greenery surrounding them. “Even with your personal rainforest in here, it doesn’t quite manage to filter out the... lingering scent of sex.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips curved into a knowing smile, that slowly grew into that real one that had Agatha’s heart hammering.
   </p>
<p>
    “Out it is, then,” she said, the finality in her tone leaving no room for doubt.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded, feeling a thrill shoot through her at the thought. She wasn’t entirely sure why this felt like such a big deal—New York was enormous, after all. Millions of people lived here, and the chances of her running into anyone she knew were slim to none... right?
   </p>
<p>
    All worries about running into someone she knew evaporated the moment Agatha stepped outside. Anyone who knew Agatha Harkness would never—
    <em>
     ever
    </em>
    —expect to see her in public wearing gray sweatpants and a faded navy hoodie bearing the logo of some random farm in Texas. No one in her social or professional circles would even think to glance her way, much less recognize her.
   </p>
<p>
    Hell,
    <em>
     she
    </em>
    avoided her own reflection every time they passed a mirrored building, barely able to reconcile this version of herself with the impeccably polished woman she usually was.
   </p>
<p>
    “I still can’t believe you ripped my clothes,” Agatha hissed under her breath, shooting a sidelong glare at Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio sighed beside her, clearly exasperated.
   </p>
<p>
    It was, after all, not the first—or second, or even third—time Agatha had brought it up. This had to be at least the fifth.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’ve already apologized,” Rio replied with a dry tone, but the hint of amusement in her tone wasn’t lost on Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    She narrowed her eyes at Rio, fighting the urge to hip check her into oncoming traffic.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     This woman had a death wish.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    And to make matters even worse, Rio was dead set on getting this food truck near Central Park.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha honestly couldn’t decide what was worse: the clothes, the fact that Rio was dragging her to an actual food truck, or the itch of the polyester-cotton blend she’d been forced to wear. Every part of this situation—sweatpants, street food, scratchy fabric—felt like an affront to her usual standards.
   </p>
<p>
    But wasn’t that the point?
   </p>
<p>
    Rio herself didn’t fit into Agatha’s usual standards.
   </p>
<p>
    She was everything Agatha didn’t expect, didn’t plan for, didn’t even know she wanted. Rio was spontaneous, unconventional, and entirely unapologetic—an impossible contradiction to Agatha’s carefully structured world.
   </p>
<p>
    And yet, here she was—standing on a busy city street in sweatpants, about to order from a food truck that looked like it had maybe a 50/50 chance of giving her salmonella—all because of Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    She felt Rio’s hand slip around her arm, giving it a gentle squeeze, and Agatha looked over to find Rio smiling up at her with that genuine, unguarded smile that had an annoyingly infectious effect. Despite herself, Agatha felt her own lips tugging into a smile.
   </p>
<p>
    She wanted to hate this.
   </p>
<p>
    Truly, every fiber of her being wanted to loathe the entire situation. The absurdity, the casualness of it all—it went against everything she thought she was. But as she stood there, feeling the crisp autumn breeze against her face, watching Rio scan the food truck menu with a bright, eager expression, she couldn’t deny that there was something oddly freeing about it.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t hate it.
   </p>
<p>
    In fact, deep down—in a place she rarely allowed herself to even acknowledge, a place that should probably stay hidden—Agatha Harkness could almost...
    <em>
     possibly
    </em>
    ... consider that she was starting to lov—
   </p>
<p>
    “Mama!”
   </p>
<p>
    It was Central Park. Children were everywhere, and it wasn’t the first time she’d heard a kid call out to their mother since they have been here. But this voice made Agatha freeze, because this particular voice wasn’t calling for just any mother.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha immediately whirled around, her eyes scanning the park with a sudden, urgent intensity. Her heart pounded as her gaze swept over the busy scene, children playing, people chatting, until—
    <em>
     there
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    She spotted him.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky was sprinting toward her, full of boundless energy, his bright smile lighting up his face as he tore down the asphalt path at breakneck speed, aimed straight at Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    There was barely a second to process his unexpected appearance before he launched himself into the air, a move that made her heart seize in that familiar way. Instinct took over, and she caught him mid-leap with practiced ease, pulling him close against her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    Warmth spread through her as she held him, feeling his small arms wrap tightly around her neck, his laughter bubbling up as if he hadn’t a care in the world.
   </p>
<p>
    She set him down, and pulled back, running her fingers through Nicky’s dark hair before cupping his face.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hi, baby,” she greeted him, her tone light but her eyes scanning the area around him— because why, exactly, was her son sprinting through Central Park on his own? A spark of protective irritation flared in her chest. “Who are you here with?”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky ignored the question, his small hands coming up to her face, tracing her features with the same endearing concentration he’d had since he was a baby.
   </p>
<p>
    “You were smiling. I saw it,” he whispered, like he was sharing a secret.
   </p>
<p>
    Her lips twitched.
   </p>
<p>
    “Was I?” she replied, feigning innocence as she fought back a smile.
   </p>
<p>
    He nodded enthusiastically, his grin widening—until his gaze flicked past her shoulder, and his eyes went round with excitement.
   </p>
<p>
    “Your mama’s pretty work friend!” he practically shouted.
   </p>
<p>
    And,
    <em>
     fuck me,
    </em>
    Agatha knew exactly who he was looking at. She had to resist the urge to wish for the ground to open up and swallow her whole.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha could feel Rio’s gaze on her, practically boring into her back. She didn’t even have to turn around to know that smug, amused smirk was plastered across Rio’s face.
   </p>
<p>
    “What’s up, I’m Rio,” came Rio’s low, gravelly voice from behind her, casual and confident.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky’s eyes went wide at that, glancing up at Agatha with a mixture of awe and excitement. He tugged on her sleeve, his voice a hushed whisper, though his excitement was unmistakable.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mama, she’s
    <em>
     cool.
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stifled a sigh, feeling her cheeks warm.
   </p>
<p>
    Of course, Rio would win over her son in an instant—no effort needed, just that damn natural charm.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha straightened up, turning to face Rio, who was, predictably, wearing that infuriating smirk. But there was something else too—a raised brow, a flicker of genuine surprise in her eyes. Agatha opened her mouth, not even sure what she intended to say, when—
   </p>
<p>
    “Nicholas!”
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Oh.
    </em>
<em>
     The universe fucking hates me.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha recognized that voice instantly. Turning, she saw James striding down the path toward them, all put together—and, naturally, his hand was entwined with that of a young blonde woman who looked like she’d just stepped off a runway.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Christ almighty,
    </em>
    Agatha thought, suddenly all too aware of her own appearance.
   </p>
<p>
    Her grungy outfit, sweatpants and a faded hoodie, her hair thrown up in a messy bun, makeup long-since sweated off.
   </p>
<p>
    The discomfort was sharp and immediate.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned and shot a glare at Rio—because, clearly, this was all her fault. Rio, unbothered as ever, barely raised an eyebrow before turning back to the food truck to collect their order, her expression infuriatingly casual.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a long, exhausted sigh, quickly composing herself as she plastered on a polite, utterly fake smile and turned to face James and...
    <em>
     what was her name again?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    James’s eyes went wide when he spotted her, and she saw him take in her appearance— sweatpants, messy bun, and all. He then shifted his gaze to Nicky, his expression softening as he stepped forward and crouched down to Nicky’s level, resting his hands on his son’s shoulders.
   </p>
<p>
    “Buddy, you can’t just take off like that,” he said, his tone a gentle rebuke.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky looked mildly chastened but then glanced up at Agatha with a shrug, as if his next words would justify everything.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s just Mom.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s forced smile tightened, and she shot Nicky a look, though she couldn’t entirely hide her amusement. Only her son could say something like that and manage to make her feel simultaneously exasperated and endeared.
   </p>
<p>
    James chuckled softly, shaking his head, and then stood up, glancing between Agatha and Rio with raised eyebrows. He cleared his throat, clearly choosing his words carefully.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s... been a while, Agatha. Didn’t expect to see you here. With, um... friends?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes and opted for a more diplomatic response.
   </p>
<p>
    “Just grabbing some fresh air,” she replied, as casually as possible, though her eyes couldn’t help flickering over to the woman clinging to James’s arm.
   </p>
<p>
    The blonde—impossibly young and beautiful, of course—gave Agatha a polite smile, her gaze flicking over Agatha’s outfit with a look Agatha could only interpret as barely concealed judgment.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, Rio turned around, food in hand, meeting James’s gaze with a relaxed, confident grin. She handed Agatha a plate of what were likely salmonella-infused nachos, then extended her free hand to James.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio,” she said smoothly, her tone effortlessly polite but unmistakably self-assured. “Nice to meet you.”
   </p>
<p>
    James shook her hand, looking mildly surprised at her confidence and composure. Agatha watched as Rio’s gaze lingered on James just a beat too long, her smirk widening slightly, as if she were sizing him up.
   </p>
<p>
    “James,” he introduced himself, glancing at Agatha for some hint of explanation, but she gave him nothing.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha fought the urge to laugh; even now, Rio somehow turned the moment into a game. And yet, oddly enough, it eased the tension, if only a little.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” James said, his voice strained but overly polite as he stepped back, wrapping a possessive arm around the blonde’s tiny waist. “This is Amanda.”
   </p>
<p>
    The blonde gave a graceful nod, her gaze flitting over Agatha with polite disinterest as she extended a perfectly manicured hand.
   </p>
<p>
    “Nice to meet you,” Agatha replied shaking her hand briefly, keeping her tone warm, aware of Nicky beside her, head on a swivel, watching them all closely.
   </p>
<p>
    An awkward silence settled over the group, thick and uncomfortable, and Agatha was at a complete loss for how to break it. Finally, James cleared his throat, his gaze landing on her with a slight frown.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha, can I talk to you for a moment?” he asked, tilting his head slightly to indicate they should step aside.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed, already dreading whatever conversation James was about to initiate, but nodded, handing Rio the death nachos.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio grabbed them and tilted her head toward a nearby bench, indicating where she would be.
   </p>
<p>
    James crouched down to Nicky, his tone softer.
   </p>
<p>
    “Buddy, stay here with Amanda, okay? I just need to talk to your mom for a moment.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky nodded, glancing between his parents with a faint look of concern, but obediently stood next to Amanda.
   </p>
<p>
    Taking a deep breath, Agatha followed James a few paces away, bracing herself for whatever he had to say.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m... sorry about that,” he murmured, his voice low and a little awkward. “Not exactly how I pictured introducing you to Amanda for the first time.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha raised an eyebrow, folding her arms across her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    “Nicky mentioned her last week,” she said, offering him an easy out. “So, I wasn’t exactly surprised.”
   </p>
<p>
    James let out a small breath, visibly relaxing, and they both glanced back toward Nicky— who had, surprisingly, wandered away from Amanda and was now sitting beside Rio on the bench.
   </p>
<p>
    The sight stopped Agatha short.
   </p>
<p>
    She hadn’t really thought about Rio interacting with Nicky yet. Sure, she knew it would happen eventually if things continued to go well—a thought she’d held onto cautiously, given her own track record. But now, watching Rio lean down to whisper something that made Nicky stifle a giggle, her heart gave an unexpected lurch.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky didn’t usually take to strangers.
   </p>
<p>
    Neither did Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Yet here was Rio Vidal, somehow bridging a gap neither of them typically allowed anyone to cross. And she was doing it with a quiet ease that surprised Agatha even more than she wanted to admit.
   </p>
<p>
    James, meanwhile, had noticed too, a slight frown creasing his brow as he looked from Nicky and Rio’s easy laughter to Amanda, who was standing awkwardly to the side.
   </p>
<p>
    “Is she a coworker?” he asked, glancing back at Agatha. “I don’t remember her from the firm.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned back to James, weighing her options carefully.
   </p>
<p>
    Technically, Rio was a coworker, and she could say just that, keeping things simple and sidestepping any complications. But a part of her, the part that reveled in defying expectations and catching people off guard, couldn’t resist the allure of honesty.
   </p>
<p>
    This was too good an opportunity to pass up.
   </p>
<p>
    Especially after every woman James had trounced in front of her over the past 3 years.
   </p>
<p>
    Still, there was a nagging hesitation.
   </p>
<p>
    If she said it out loud... if she actually claimed Rio as more than a coworker, then it would be real, wouldn’t it?
   </p>
<p>
    But then, as she glanced back at Rio with Nicky, who was now laughing with that unguarded joy she rarely saw, Agatha felt the words forming anyway. She looked back at James, a faint smile curling on her lips, and took a steadying breath.
   </p>
<p>
    “Actually,” Agatha began, her voice steady as she carefully tested each word, “Rio isn’t just a coworker.”
   </p>
<p>
    James’s brows knit together in confusion, and Agatha resisted the urge to roll her eyes.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Was he always this dense?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Rio is... someone I’ve been seeing,” she said, drawing the words out slowly, lifting her chin slightly as she held his gaze, watching his reaction unfold with a certain satisfaction.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, James simply blinked, his expression shifting as the realization settled in. He opened his mouth as if to say something, then closed it, clearly grappling with the unexpected news.
   </p>
<p>
    "Seeing," he finally repeated, his voice tinged with surprise. "As in... dating?"
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha fought to keep a smirk at bay.
   </p>
<p>
    "Yes, James," she replied, her tone deliberately calm. "As in dating."
   </p>
<p>
    She watched as he processed this, glancing back toward the bench where Rio and Nicky were still talking, Nicky looking more animated than he had with anyone Agatha had introduced him to in a long time.
   </p>
<p>
    James looked slightly thrown, maybe even a bit unsettled, and it was, Agatha had to admit, a rather satisfying sight.
   </p>
<p>
    After a pause, he cleared his throat.
   </p>
<p>
    “I didn’t... expect that.”
   </p>
<p>
    He looked at her, then back at Rio, his brows furrowing.
   </p>
<p>
    “How old is she?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha scoffed, crossing her arms and leveling him with an unimpressed look.
   </p>
<p>
    “Really?” she said, arching an eyebrow. “You’re actually asking me that?”
   </p>
<p>
    James held up his hands defensively, his face reddening slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s just... she seems young, that’s all.”
   </p>
<p>
    “And your girlfriend, doesn’t?” Agatha replied sharply, her gaze flicking pointedly toward Amanda, who was scrolling on her phone, oblivious. “What is she, twenty-five?”
   </p>
<p>
    James shifted, looking uncomfortable.
   </p>
<p>
    “Touché,” he muttered, clearly unsure how to respond.
   </p>
<p>
    James cleared his throat, visibly flustered.
   </p>
<p>
    “I didn’t know you were...” He trailed off, his gaze shifting awkwardly between Agatha and Rio, clearly at a loss for words.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha raised an eyebrow, waiting for him to finish.
   </p>
<p>
    “Didn’t know I was... what, James?” she prompted, her voice cool and steady.
   </p>
<p>
    He fumbled for a moment, glancing around as if the right words were hiding somewhere nearby.
   </p>
<p>
    “I didn’t know you were... seeing someone. I mean, dating someone...
    <em>
     like that
    </em>
    ,” he finished lamely, his cheeks coloring slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t help but smirk, crossing her arms.
   </p>
<p>
    “There’s a lot you don’t know, apparently.”
   </p>
<p>
    James looked away, his expression caught between surprise and something resembling discomfort.
   </p>
<p>
    She could see him trying to reconcile the Agatha he thought he knew with the one standing in front of him.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Get in line, buddy.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Because honestly?
   </p>
<p>
    She was still trying to reconcile it herself.
   </p>
<p>
    This was new territory—unfamiliar and terrifying in ways she hadn’t anticipated. Rio had somehow cracked through walls Agatha had once thought impenetrable. And yet, here she was, actually owning up to it, openly claiming the woman who had turned her world upside down.
   </p>
<p>
    She almost wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay,” Agatha said, clapping her hands together, desperate to wrap up this surreal encounter. “Is that all?”
   </p>
<p>
    James, still visibly processing everything, nodded blankly. But then something seemed to click, and he cleared his throat.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, right. Parent-teacher conference is next Thursday,” he added. “Nicky brought home a reminder in his bag yesterday.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded, a flicker of relief grounding her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Got it,” she replied, slipping back into a more familiar rhythm. “I’ll be there.”
   </p>
<p>
    She glanced over at Nicky, still animatedly chatting with Rio on the bench, and felt an unexpected calm settle over her.
   </p>
<p>
    And then Rio looked up, catching Agatha’s gaze, and she smiled—
    <em>
     that
    </em>
    smile, the real one, the one that always managed to tug at something deep inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    A heartbeat later, Nicky turned and grinned at her, his face lighting up with the same warmth.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath caught as she looked at them, side by side. She hadn’t noticed it before, but they shared the same easy, unguarded smile. And somehow, both of those smiles affected her in exactly the same way, stirring something fierce and protective within her.
   </p>
<p>
    It was a small moment, but it anchored her in a way she hadn’t expected.
   </p>
<p>
    Seeing Rio and Nicky together, their smiles mirroring each other, felt like something fitting quietly into place, like a missing piece she hadn’t even realized was gone.
   </p>
<p>
    Her heart skipped, and she took a breath, steadying herself.
   </p>
<p>
    This was her life now—messy, unexpected, so far from the pristine, controlled image she’d cultivated for herself.
   </p>
<p>
    And yet, somehow, standing here with Nicky and Rio, it felt more... real.
   </p>
<p>
    James’s voice snapped her out of her thoughts.
   </p>
<p>
    “Alright, well... we should get going,” he said, gesturing for Amanda to follow.
   </p>
<p>
    “Right,” Agatha replied, her tone light but her eyes lingering on Rio and Nicky.
   </p>
<p>
    James looked at her, his gaze softening just a bit.
   </p>
<p>
    “You look happy, Agatha,” he said quietly, almost as if he hadn’t meant to say it out loud.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha glanced at him, surprised.
   </p>
<p>
    And for once, she didn’t have a biting comeback.
   </p>
<p>
    Instead, she gave him a small nod, an acknowledgment of a truth that she was only beginning to understand herself.
   </p>
<p>
    Back at Rio’s place, they’d barely managed to get through their food truck meals before collapsing onto the couch, too full and content to even think about moving. Agatha would never openly admit how good the food was, but Rio had caught her eyes widening at the first bite, the reluctant approval in her expression.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha might’ve kept up the façade, but Rio knew better.
   </p>
<p>
    And now they were sprawled together on the couch, wrapped in the cozy lull of each other’s presence. To her surprise, Rio curled into her, tucking herself under Agatha’s arm with an ease that felt strangely natural. And, even more surprising, Agatha found herself liking it. She wrapped her arms around Rio, guiding her down to lay her head against her chest, feeling the warmth of Rio’s body settle into her own.
   </p>
<p>
    The room was dim, and a documentary about whales—
    <em>
     of all things
    </em>
    —played softly on the screen, courtesy of Rio’s pick.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha found herself listening more to the rhythmic rise and fall of Rio’s breathing than the narration. It was quiet, peaceful, and something about it felt deeply intimate, a simple closeness she hadn’t known she’d ever want with someone.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s hand moved through Rio’s hair almost absently, her fingers grazing her scalp as she traced small, soothing circles.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Rio murmured into her chest, her voice soft, almost hesitant.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s fingers paused, and she looked down, only to see that Rio wasn’t looking up at her. Instead, her gaze was fixed forward, as if she were reluctant to make eye contact.
   </p>
<p>
    “This... this feels really good—
    <em>
     with you
    </em>
    ,” Rio admitted quietly, her tone so soft it was as if she’d barely allowed herself to say it.
   </p>
<p>
    The vulnerability in Rio’s voice made Agatha’s chest tighten, and then warmth settled in there. For a moment, she simply watched Rio, feeling the weight of the admission between them as something tender filled the silence.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, willing herself to action, Agatha reached down, hooking her fingers gently under Rio’s chin, lifting her face until their eyes met. She brought her other hand up, brushing a few silky strands of hair back from Rio’s face, her fingers lingering against her skin.
   </p>
<p>
    She searched Rio’s eyes, finding something there—vulnerability, maybe even a glimmer of hesitation—that made her heart ache. It wasn’t often she allowed herself to truly look at someone this closely, to let the walls drop just enough to see what lay beneath the surface.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s gaze held a softness that Agatha hadn’t seen before, a quiet openness that made Agatha’s heart stutter. For a moment, neither of them spoke; they simply looked at each other, the silence filled with all the unspoken things they’d both been too guarded to say.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s thumb brushed lightly along Rio’s cheekbone, a small, tender gesture she hadn’t planned but couldn’t resist.
   </p>
<p>
    “It feels good to me too,” she murmured, her voice low.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes softened even more at Agatha’s words, her lips curving into a small, almost shy smile that seemed so unlike her usual confident smirk. She leaned into Agatha’s touch, letting her hand rest over Agatha’s on her cheek, grounding them both in that quiet, fragile moment.
   </p>
<p>
    For once, words felt unnecessary.
   </p>
<p>
    Instead, Agatha let her thumb graze along Rio’s cheek, then slip down to trace the line of her jaw, savoring the warmth of her skin. She was surprised by how much she enjoyed just... this. No pretense, no need to prove anything to each other. Just the steady beat of her own heart, the comfortable weight of Rio lying against her, and the soft glow of the tv filling the room.
   </p>
<p>
    She wasn’t used to this—this quiet, steady intimacy that didn’t demand anything more than just being here, in this moment.
   </p>
<p>
    “Think you could get used to it?” Rio asked softly, her voice barely more than a whisper.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath hitched at that, as she ran her thumb across Rio’s cheekbone, heart aching with a quite vulnerability in her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    “I think,” she replied, her voice a little rough as she forced the words out into the world—to Rio. “I think I already am.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes widened a little bit at the confession, but then—her lips curved into a smile at Agatha’s words, and—oh, that smile was dangerous, as Agatha felt her heart clench.
   </p>
<p>
    Before she could fully process it, Rio leaned down, her lips capturing Agatha’s in a soft, lingering kiss.
   </p>
<p>
    But then—
    <em>
     knock, knock
    </em>
    —a sharp rap at the door.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio paused mid-kiss, huffing in mild annoyance against Agatha’s lips before placing a quick peck there, her own frustration clear as she reluctantly pulled away.
   </p>
<p>
    “Sorry, it’s probably my neighbor,” she said with an exasperated sigh as she stood up. “She’s a sweetheart, but she has about zero concept of technology and probably messed up her TV again. She’ll be desperate to get back to her
    <em>
     shows.
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio shook her head with a wry smile before heading to the door.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a quiet laugh, settling back on the couch as she watched Rio head for the door, feeling a strange, unexpected fondness for the simple domesticity of it all.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned her attention back to the TV, waiting for Rio to return, but a few seconds later, she heard Rio’s voice calling out, her tone a mix of confusion and surprise.
   </p>
<p>
    “Um...Agatha?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sat up, peering over the back of the couch to see Rio standing there, talking to some guy at the door. When Rio turned, her brow furrowed, and she looked at Agatha with mild bewilderment.
   </p>
<p>
    “He’s... actually here for you,” Rio said, confusion still evident in her expression.
   </p>
<p>
    Equally puzzled, Agatha tilted her head before getting off the couch and walking to the door. There stood a young man, clad in a hoodie and a backpack, unmistakably a bike messenger. He glanced at her with the detached look of someone just trying to finish his last delivery for the day.
   </p>
<p>
    “You...Agatha Harkness?” he asked.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” she replied, eyeing him cautiously.
   </p>
<p>
    He gave a short nod, removing his backpack and pulling out a sealed manila folder.
   </p>
<p>
    “This is for you,” he said, holding it out.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s gaze dropped to the folder, her name printed in bold letters across the front. Years in the legal world had trained her not to touch anything without first considering the source. And the fact that it had been delivered to
    <em>
     Rio’s
    </em>
    address instead of her own only made her more wary.
   </p>
<p>
    “Who sent this?” she asked skeptically, her eyes narrowing.
   </p>
<p>
    “Some guy named Billy,” he replied with a casual shrug.
   </p>
<p>
    Relief washed over her.
   </p>
<p>
    Billy had access to her location, and this wasn’t the first time he’d sent her something on a weekend or at some random location. She took the folder from him with a nod, and the messenger promptly turned to leave.
   </p>
<p>
    As Agatha weighed the folder in her hands, curiosity prickled at her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     What on earth could Billy have sent that couldn’t wait until Monday?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Rio closed the door, eyeing the folder with mild interest before stepping closer, her voice dropping to a low murmur.
   </p>
<p>
    “Looks like you’ve got some work to do,” she said softly, leaning in. “I’ll be in the shower. Consider it an incentive to get done with whatever that is... quickly.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her words brushed against Agatha’s ear, and before Agatha could respond, Rio flashed her a wicked grin and disappeared down the hallway, leaving Agatha with the folder—and a sudden, very intense motivation to make quick work of whatever this was.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sat down on the couch, slipping a fingernail under the tape and tearing it open. She pulled out the contents, her brow furrowing as she lifted a paper-clipped stack of photographs. At the top was a handwritten note, paper-clipped to the first page, and as her eyes scanned the words, a chill ran down her spine.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
      Drop the case, or face the cost.
     </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Heart pounding, she stared at the note, then hesitantly flipped to the photos beneath it. The first few were of Rio alone—candid shots of her at a coffee shop, picking up groceries, browsing through a plant store. Each image felt uncomfortably close, intimate, as though someone had been following her at every turn.
   </p>
<p>
    Then came the photos of them together—Agatha and Rio walking side by side in Central Park, stepping into a town car, standing in the alley outside the Red Light. There was a shot of them kissing outside Rio’s door, another of them together in the office.
   </p>
<p>
    And the final, brutal image: Rio and Nicky, sitting on a bench in Central Park, smiling at each other.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s mind raced, her thoughts a frantic blur.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Billy didn’t send these.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The bike messenger—the delivery—
    <em>
     it was a setup.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Without another second’s hesitation, she jammed the photos back into the folder and bolted towards the door, running barefoot down the stairs, her pulse pounding in her ears as she flew down all five flights.
   </p>
<p>
    She burst out onto the street, her eyes darting around, heart hammering.
   </p>
<p>
    And then—she spotted him.
   </p>
<p>
    The bike messenger walking away from her, about half way down the street.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hey!” she yelled, her voice cutting through the noise of the street.
   </p>
<p>
    He turned, glancing over his shoulder, and her blood ran cold at the sight of his smirk. He gave her one last mocking look before slipping into car next to him. A chill swept over her as the car pulled away from the curb, gliding in her direction.
   </p>
<p>
    In slow motion, Agatha watched the black Cadillac roll past her, its tinted windows concealing whoever was inside.
   </p>
<p>
    But she knew that car.
   </p>
<p>
    The same make, model, and ominous presence as the one that had sat outside Brooke Sinclair’s apartment before her murder.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart pounded as the realization crashed over her, each beat hammering against her ribcage like a warning siren.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Vanguard.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    They were threatening her—no,
    <em>
     they were threatening Rio to get to her.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    They hadn’t just followed her.
   </p>
<p>
    They’d delivered the threat right to Rio’s door, right to the person Agatha had let too close, and who now, unknowingly, had been pulled into Vanguard’s deadly crosshairs.
   </p>
<p>
    Her pulse raced, her mind snapping from image to image—the photos of Rio alone, living her life, unaware of the eyes watching her every move; the final, brutal photo of Rio and Nicky in the park. And now this—the Cadillac lurking right outside Rio’s fucking building.
   </p>
<p>
    They knew exactly where Rio lived.
   </p>
<p>
    The gravity of it settled over her, sharp and suffocating.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath came in short, jagged gasps, her vision blurring as panic clawed its way up her throat. She forced herself to reach into her pocket, her fingers trembling as she unlocked her phone. Her heart roared in her ears, drowning out nearly everything else, but she managed to hold the phone to her ear.
   </p>
<p>
    The second she heard the line connect, she spoke, her voice barely steady.
   </p>
<p>
    “Emergency partner meeting.
    <em>
     Now
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    There was a pause, then an exasperated sigh on the other end.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Jen said, her tone laced with disbelief. “It’s Saturday...”
   </p>
<p>
    “Jen,” Agatha whispered, her voice breaking as she pressed her hand against her chest, feeling her heart’s frantic, uneven rhythm beneath her fingers.
   </p>
<p>
    Tears stung her eyes, blurring her vision.
   </p>
<p>
    “Jen—
    <em>
     please.
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    Silence.
   </p>
<p>
    She could almost hear Jen processing the gravity of that single word.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Please.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha never said please.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’ll call the others,” Jen replied finally, her voice steady. “Be there soon.”
   </p>
<p>
    The line went dead, but the echo of her own panic reverberated, a tight, suffocating grip on her chest as she stood on the street, struggling to hold herself together.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha moved as though detached from her own body, her steps automatic as she climbed the five flights back to Rio’s apartment. The door was still open where she’d left it, a silent reminder of the chaos she’d just fled. The ringing in her ears only grew louder, like the aftermath of a bomb blast, filling her mind and making her surroundings feel distant, surreal.
   </p>
<p>
    She barely registered her movements as she crossed the threshold, each step carrying her closer to the sound of running water. The steam drifted out from the bathroom, and through the fogged glass, she could see Rio’s form, hazy but unmistakably relaxed.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked back tears, her heart twisting painfully as she reached for the shower door.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio turned to her immediately, a playful smile lighting up her face.
   </p>
<p>
    “Done already?” she asked, running a hand through her wet hair as her smile morphed into that familiar, lecherous grin.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart clenched, the panic thrumming beneath the surface, a fierce battle between her need to protect and the terror clawing its way up her spine. She fought with every ounce of control she had to keep her face calm, her voice steady, masking the chaos inside.
   </p>
<p>
    "I have to go into the office," Agatha said, forcing a disappointed smile she hoped would mask the tremor in her voice. "Client emergency."
   </p>
<p>
    Rio paused, her hands still in her hair, the playful glint in her eyes fading as her grin slipped away. She studied Agatha, a flicker of concern crossing her face as she took in the tension Agatha was trying so desperately to hide.
   </p>
<p>
    "Everything okay?" Rio asked, her tone softening, the concern evident in her gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed, nodding a little too quickly.
   </p>
<p>
    "Just... something that can't wait. You know how it is."
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t look entirely convinced, but she simply gave a slow nod, her eyes searching Agatha’s.
   </p>
<p>
    "Anything I can help with?" Rio asked, her voice gentle but steady.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart lurched, caught off guard by the simple offer of support. She swallowed, trying to steady herself.
   </p>
<p>
    “Um—yes, actually,” she replied, the words escaping before she could fully process them. “Can you stay here? Don’t go anywhere. I need you... on call.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes widened slightly, a flash of confusion crossing her face as she tried to understand Agatha’s request.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t blame her; it didn’t make a ton of sense. But until she could figure out how to handle this, she needed Rio to stay put until she figured out what to do.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay,” Rio murmured, her expression still puzzled but trusting, nodding slowly.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha hesitated for a moment, her heart pounding as she looked at Rio. And then, without thinking, she reached forward, her sleeve soaking through as she gripped Rio’s arm and pulled her close, her mouth finding Rio’s in a kiss that was anything but gentle. It was fierce, desperate, a kiss that seemed to hold a thousand words Agatha couldn’t bring herself to say.
   </p>
<p>
    She poured everything into it—her unspoken fears, her need to protect Rio, and the quiet, terrifying realization of just how much Rio meant to her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha knew, deep down, that this was the kind of kiss you give someone when you’re not sure you’ll ever get to kiss them again. When she pulled back, Rio’s eyes opened slowly, and in that brief, vulnerable moment, Agatha saw the recognition there—Rio felt it too, the finality of it, even though Agatha hadn’t said a word.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha... don’t,” Rio whispered, a hint of panic slipping into her voice.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha took a step back, her heart aching.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m sorry,” she murmured, her voice breaking as she fought to keep the tears at bay.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha—”
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha was already turning, heading for the door, her vision blurring. She heard the water shut off abruptly, and then the frantic shuffle of Rio moving to follow.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha, get your ass back here!” Rio’s voice rang out, filled with desperation.
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha didn’t stop. She reached the front door, grabbed the file from the table, and slipped out, closing the door behind her as the first tear broke free. By the time she was on the stairs, her tears were falling unchecked, her heart splitting with every step she took away from Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha kept walking, her mind a whirlwind of chaotic thoughts, her heart breaking with every step. She barely registered the descent down the staircase, each step a dull echo in her ears. When she finally reached the street, she saw Dan already waiting by the curb, his expression impassive as he held the door open for her.
   </p>
<p>
    She slipped into the back seat, her hand immediately reaching for the intercom.
   </p>
<p>
    “Office,” she said, her voice barely steady, and as Dan pulled away, she leaned back, exhaling shakily.
   </p>
<p>
    But just as the car began to move, she caught a flash of movement out the window.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio had burst through the building’s front door, wrapped in a robe, her hair dripping wet, eyes wild and searching. Her gaze locked onto Agatha’s through the dark tinted glass, and Agatha’s heart twisted sharply, her throat tightening as she fought the urge to stop the car.
   </p>
<p>
    For a brief, excruciating moment, their eyes locked through the tinted glass, Rio’s gaze so full of desperation and hurt that it felt like a knife twisting deep inside Agatha’s chest.
   </p>
<p>
    Every fiber of her being screamed to stop, to go back, to let herself want this—to believe she could keep it,
    <em>
     protect it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    As the car pulled away, something inside Agatha broke, a raw, piercing ache that ripped through her chest so fiercely she raised a hand to her heart, as though she could somehow hold it together.
   </p>
<p>
    But it was pointless.
   </p>
<p>
    She couldn’t ignore it anymore, couldn’t pretend her heart hadn’t already betrayed her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She loved Rio Vidal.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Loved her with a ferocity that terrified her, loved her in a way that stripped her bare.
   </p>
<p>
    But it was only a matter of time, wasn’t it?
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha Harkness wasn’t meant to fall in love—she’d known that her whole life, had built her life around that certainty.
   </p>
<p>
    People like her didn’t get happy endings.
   </p>
<p>
    Love was never in the cards for someone like her, and maybe that was the way it had to be.
   </p>
<p>
    As the distance between them stretched further, the truth settled in, heavy and irrevocable—a raw ache pressing deep into her chest, as real as the person she’d just left behind.
   </p>
<p>
    She’d brought Rio into this mess—into the danger of the case, into her own chaotic life. If she wanted to keep Rio safe, to protect her from the storm gathering around the Vanguard case, then she had to sever the only thing tying Rio to Vanguard:
   </p>
<p>
    Herself.

   Chapter Notes
   <p>
    Called into work. Had a Hobbit movie marathon, and wrote. This chapter was pretty much already written. So many notes in my phone in my computer. I have been eagerly awaiting this chapter and it was so fun to create and refine. This is probably my favorite chapter so far. I hope you guys enjoy it!
   </p>
<p>
    Also just for shits and giggles I went back and renamed some chapters to be more inline with AAA.
   </p>

```
Agatha despised Jen’s office. The soft hues of pastel pinks and greens, the strategically placed crystals glowing faintly in the dim lights, the faint scent of sage hanging in the air—it all screamed peaceful energy. And that energy always seemed to be at war with who Agatha was, especially today.
   </p>
<p>
    But she needed to be here, needed to force herself to be in this office because simply, she needed Jen.
   </p>
<p>
    She’d never admit it out loud— ever —but Jennifer Kale was a damn good lawyer. All this crystals-and-harmony nonsense might give the impression of softness, of someone who could be pushed around.
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha knew better.
   </p>
<p>
    Underneath the serene, faux-spiritual exterior, Jen was as sharp as a scalpel and just as deadly. She didn’t just argue cases; she dissected them, layer by layer, until her opponents didn’t even realize they’d been gutted.
   </p>
<p>
    And she did it with a smile.
   </p>
<p>
    It was infuriating.
   </p>
<p>
    But, begrudgingly, Agatha respected it—even if the sight of an amethyst cluster perched smugly on Jen’s desk made her want to roll her eyes into next week.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha paced the office, the heel of her boots sounding against the polished floor. She had arrived five minutes ago, and there was still no sign of the other partners.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes flicked down to the intricate rug in the middle of the room—no doubt some sacred handwoven artifact from a Tibetan monastery or whatever the hell it was. Agatha took a
   </p>
<p>
    small, guilty pleasure in working a deliberate line along the edge of it with every sharp twist of the heel of her boot.
   </p>
<p>
    If she twisted a little harder than necessary, well, it wasn’t like she could destroy anything
    <em>
     else
    </em>
    in the room.
   </p>
<p>
    And she really needed to destroy
    <em>
     something.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha’s pacing quickened, the deliberate grind of her heel against the rug becoming sharper, more forceful. She clenched her fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms as a storm of emotions churned inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    Out of control.
   </p>
<p>
    Heartbroken.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     And fucking terrified.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It was a cocktail of feelings she didn’t know how to handle, feelings that pressed against the very being of herself, with such a force that it borderline breaking her down entirely.
   </p>
<p>
    She hated it.
   </p>
<p>
    Hated how exposed she felt, how vulnerable.
   </p>
<p>
    Vulnerability wasn’t her thing—control was.
   </p>
<p>
    Power.
   </p>
<p>
    Authority.
   </p>
<p>
    And yet here she was, spiraling over things she couldn’t fix, couldn’t change, couldn’t
    <em>
     control.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her breath hitched as she stopped dead in the middle of Jen’s office, staring blankly at one of the soft pastel paintings hanging on the wall. The peaceful, meditative vibe mocked her, a cruel reminder of everything she was not. Everything she couldn’t pretend to be.
   </p>
<p>
    Her heart felt like it was caught in a vice, raw and aching in a way she couldn’t push aside. All those pictures of Rio—the danger she was in was weaving through her chest like a needle pulling sharp, stinging thread. And Nicky... God, she couldn’t even think about Nicky without feeling that protective fear flare hot and fast, adding fuel to the fire already burning inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swiped a hand across her face, letting out a bitter laugh that sounded more like a broken exhale.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     What the hell was she going to do?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Finally, voices reached her ears, pulling Agatha from her spiraling thoughts. She turned, and the wave of
    <em>
     relief
    </em>
    that coursed through her at the sight of the three women walking toward her was startling.
   </p>
<p>
    Because Agatha respected her partners—
    <em>
     as colleagues
    </em>
    but they were also the closest things she had to friends.
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha had always prided herself on not needing anyone. She could fight her battles, just as she always had, alone.
   </p>
<p>
    That was who she was.
   </p>
<p>
    Who she’d always been.
   </p>
<p>
    And yet, standing there, watching Jen, Alice, and Lilia approach in their varying states of dress, something stirred inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    Alice, a season ticket holder to the Knicks, was wearing a jersey and sneakers, clearly having been dragged away from a game. Lilia, wore a full ball gown, as if she’d walked directly off a gala’s red carpet. And Jen—
    <em>
     Jen
    </em>
    —was surprisingly casual, in leggings and a loose-fitting sweater, the most dressed down Agatha had ever seen her.
   </p>
<p>
    The mismatched appearances were a dead giveaway. These women had dropped whatever they were doing, without hesitation, and come running the moment Agatha called.
   </p>
<p>
    That realization hit her harder than she expected.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, her throat tightened, and she fought the unfamiliar feeling threatening to overwhelm her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     They came for me.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It wasn’t something Agatha was used to.
   </p>
<p>
    Relying on others? Asking for help?
   </p>
<p>
    That wasn’t in her playbook.
   </p>
<p>
    Yet, here they were—showing up for her when she needed them most, without question.
   </p>
<p>
    And, for a woman who had spent her entire life convinced she didn’t need anyone, Agatha Harkness suddenly became—
    <em>
     painfully
    </em>
    —aware of just how much she needed these women.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen, Lilia and Alice walked into Jen's office, each of them coming to an abrupt stop as their eyes fell on Agatha. The varying degrees of surprise written across their faces were impossible to miss.
   </p>
<p>
    And that’s when Agatha realized—
    <em>
     shit
    </em>
    —she was still dressed in Rio’s clothes. Baggy gray sweatpants, an old, faded hoodie, and a makeup-less face, no doubt blotchy and red from the tears that fell earlier. The sight of herself reflected back at her in their reactions sent a flash of
   </p>
<p>
    heat through her cheeks, though she held her ground, forcing herself not to shrink under their scrutiny.
   </p>
<p>
    But she saw it in their faces—the shift.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     The realization.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It was one thing to get called in for an emergency meeting on a weekend. They were partners, after all. This wasn’t the first time, nor would it be the last.
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha’s
    <em>
     state
    </em>
    —disheveled and vulnerable was the glaring red flag.
   </p>
<p>
    It screamed that something was really,
    <em>
     really
    </em>
    wrong.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen was the first to recover, her sharp gaze softening slightly as she tilted her head.
   </p>
<p>
    “What happened?” she asked, her tone steady but laced with concern.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a loud exhale, the sound almost sharp in the otherwise quiet room. She didn’t even know where to start—didn’t have the words—so instead, she simply stepped forward and handed Jen the folder, letting the pictures and the note inside speak for her.
   </p>
<p>
    Without a word, she stepped back, crossing her arms tightly over her chest as if it could shield her from the wave of vulnerability creeping up on her. She hated this feeling—hated the way it made her feel exposed.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen opened the folder, her expression unreadable as her eyes flicked over the contents. Beside her, Alice and Lilia pressed in, craning their necks to see, their curiosity and concern palpable.
   </p>
<p>
    And Agatha just stood there, watching, feeling like her entire world was laid bare before them. Because this wasn’t just professional. This wasn’t just another case or a work emergency.
   </p>
<p>
    This was personal—
    <em>
     deeply personal
    </em>
    —and they were about to see it all.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stood stiffly, arms crossed, watching as they flipped through the images one by one. Her jaw clenched as their expressions shifted from confusion to shock, and then all three women’s eyes widened simultaneously. Agatha didn’t even need to look to know which photo they’d landed on—
    <em>
     the
    </em>
    photo of her and Rio kissing.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen’s head snapped up, her expression caught somewhere between disbelief and exasperation.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re sleeping with a first-year associate?” she asked, her tone incredulous.
   </p>
<p>
    A flush of embarrassment prickled up Agatha’s spine. It was wildly out of character for her.
   </p>
<p>
    She knew it.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     They knew it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    But she wasn’t about to let Jen or anyone else see her squirm. She forced herself to glare, planting her hands on her hips.
   </p>
<p>
    “Can we maybe just concentrate on the death threats for now?” she growled, her voice cutting through the tension. “You can report me to HR later.”
   </p>
<p>
    Alice let out a low impressed whistle, Lilia glanced sharply at Jen, and Jen—
    <em>
     thankfully
    </em>
    let it go—closed her mouth, though her raised eyebrows said enough.
   </p>
<p>
    “Go to the last one,” Agatha snapped, pointing at the folder.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen gave her a pointed look but complied, flipping through the photos until the final image came into view—the one of Nicky and Rio sitting together on the park bench.
   </p>
<p>
    The room went dead silent.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt the air shift as they all took in the photo, the meaning of it sinking in. The sight of Nicky there, his smile so carefree, paired with Rio—someone who shouldn’t have been a target but now clearly was—hit differently.
   </p>
<p>
    “Jesus,” Alice muttered under her breath, breaking the silence.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia’s face was tight with something that looked an awful lot like anger, her jaw set as she slowly looked back up at Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen’s head snapped up, her eyes locking onto Agatha’s with a mix of concern and anger simmering just beneath the surface.
   </p>
<p>
    “When did you get these?” she asked, her voice sharp and steady.
   </p>
<p>
    “Almost an hour ago,” Agatha replied, exhaling slowly, as though the words themselves were a burden. “A messenger, under the guise of delivering something from Billy, dropped them off at Rio’s front door. For me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her jaw tightened, and she clenched her hands into fists to steady herself.
   </p>
<p>
    “They’re watching her. Watching her place. They
    <em>
     knew
    </em>
    I was there.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words hung heavy in the room, but Agatha wasn’t done. She swallowed hard, her throat dry, before continuing.
   </p>
<p>
    “Those pictures from the park,” she said, her voice catching for the briefest of moments before she pushed on, steeling herself. “
    <em>
     With Nicky
    </em>
    .” Her chest tightened, and she had to take a breath to ground herself. “Those were taken
    <em>
     today.
    </em>
    Earlier today.”
   </p>
<p>
    The weight of her words dropped like a stone in the room, and Jen’s hand curled tightly around the closed folder, her jaw clenching as her gaze flicked toward Alice and Lilia, who were both uncharacteristically silent.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s Vanguard,” Agatha said, her voice low but steady.
   </p>
<p>
    The words rang through the space like a bell, sharp and reverberating, leaving an unmistakable tension in their wake.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen’s grip on the folder tightened, her expression shifting to something darker, sharper. She moved forward and dropped the folders on the table between them, they scattered out, and Agatha had to force her eyes away from them.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re sure?” Jen finally asked, her tone careful but urgent.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, but she nodded.
   </p>
<p>
    “Who else has the resources, the motive, and
    <em>
     the audacity
    </em>
    to pull something like this?”
   </p>
<p>
    She gestured sharply toward the pictures, her frustration laced with anger bleeding into her voice.
   </p>
<p>
    “This has Vanguard’s fingerprints all over it.”
   </p>
<p>
    She drew in a steadying breath, her gaze hardening.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s not a coincidence that the second I finally get my jury trial they start threatening me. They know I have them. The evidence Rio uncovered is going to
    <em>
     fucking bury them.
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice dropped, the weight of her words landing like a hammer.
   </p>
<p>
    “And judging by those pictures of us in the office...” She trailed off, her jaw clenching as she looked back at the folder. “We’ve clearly been breached. They know exactly what we have on them. They know they can’t explain what we found—so they’re trying to squash it before we even get to court.”
   </p>
<p>
    Jen exhaled sharply, her lips pressing into a thin line.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’ve got them on the run. They’re scared,” she said. “That’s the only reason they’d escalate like this.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Good,” Alice muttered darkly, her fingers curling into fists. “They should be.”
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha ran her hands through her hair in frustration.
   </p>
<p>
    “Scared doesn’t make them any less dangerous.
    <em>
     It makes them reckless.
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    “And desperate,” Lilia added, her voice low and measured, each word landing like the strike of a hammer. “A dangerous combination.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, her sharp gaze settling on Agatha, piercing through the tension like a blade. It was a look that always managed to unnerve Agatha, as though Lilia could see straight through her defenses to the vulnerable core beneath.
   </p>
<p>
    And yet, there was something steadying about it, too—something that made Agatha feel, for once, like she wasn’t alone in carrying the weight of this.
   </p>
<p>
    “What do you want to do?” Lilia asked.
   </p>
<p>
    The question lingered in the air, heavy with meaning.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha met Lilia’s gaze, her mind racing as she considered the next steps, the risks, the consequences. This wasn’t just about her anymore—it was about so much more.
   </p>
<p>
    “The payout on this case...” Agatha began, instinctively reaching for the familiar ground of practicality, of numbers and logistics.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Fuck the payout
    </em>
    ,” Alice interrupted sharply, her voice cutting through the tension like a knife. It was uncharacteristically blunt, even for her. “Our books are solid. We don’t
    <em>
     need
    </em>
    it.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown off. It wasn’t like Alice to dismiss a financial gain so easily, and for her to do so now only underscored the gravity of the situation. This wasn’t just about money or winning a case anymore—this was personal, and they all knew it.
   </p>
<p>
    With the familiar slipping out of reach, Agatha instinctively curled her arms around herself, as if trying to hold something steady within.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     What did she want to do?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Vanguard had been her white whale. The thing she’d been chasing for years, pouring her energy, her drive, her life into defeating.
   </p>
<p>
    It was supposed to be everything.
   </p>
<p>
    Her crowning achievement.
   </p>
<p>
    Her ultimate victory.
   </p>
<p>
    Or so she’d thought.
   </p>
<p>
    Because now, with this threat hanging over Rio and Nicky, it was like a cold light had been cast over everything.
   </p>
<p>
    Suddenly, Vanguard felt small—insignificant, even. What was winning against them compared to
    <em>
     this
    </em>
    ? Compared to the people who actually mattered?
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t even a choice.
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard was nothing—
    <em>
     nothing
    </em>
    —compared to them.
   </p>
<p>
    But at the same time—could Agatha really let them get away with this? Let them silence her, just as they’d silenced Brooke Sinclair? The thought clawed at her, hot and furious.
   </p>
<p>
    She could still see Brooke’s parents, their eyes hollow with grief, their pain a tangible weight in the room as they mourned the daughter stolen from them. Agatha had promised them justice—
    <em>
     sworn
    </em>
    it.
   </p>
<p>
    And now, she was standing at the edge of a decision that could betray that promise.
   </p>
<p>
    The image of Brooke lingered, but it was Nicky’s face took her place. The memory of him so weak and frail in the hospital bed, of her nearly losing him—the suffocating fear, the pain she never wanted to feel again—made her chest tighten.
   </p>
<p>
    Brooke’s parents had lost their child.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha had come terrifyingly close to the same.
   </p>
<p>
    She gritted her teeth, the tension curling through her body like a vice.
   </p>
<p>
    Letting Vanguard walk away, letting them silence her after everything they’d done, wasn’t just a betrayal of her work—it was a betrayal of Brooke’s memory. Of her parents’ pain. Of everything Agatha stood for.
   </p>
<p>
    She couldn’t—
    <em>
     wouldn’t
    </em>
    —let them win.
   </p>
<p>
    But the cost of fighting back?
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     That’s what truly terrified her.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, forcing herself to stand taller as she turned to Jen, her voice steady despite the storm raging inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    “That security company we had to hire,” she started, “for that environmental terrorist group threatening the firm when we represented Freeman Gas over those fracking violations—were they good?”
   </p>
<p>
    The room went silent.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen’s sharp gaze snapped to Agatha, understanding flickering to life in her eyes. She didn’t answer immediately, her lips pressing into a thin line as she considered the weight of Agatha’s question—
    <em>
     and what it implied
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha... are you sure—”
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Were they good?
    </em>
    ” Agatha repeated sharply, her voice cutting through the tension like a blade.
   </p>
<p>
    There was no room for hesitation, no space for doubt.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen straightened, her shoulders squaring as she locked eyes with Agatha. Her expression was calm, but the weight of the moment hung heavy between them.
   </p>
<p>
    “They were good,” she answered.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded once, absorbing the answer, her mind already racing ahead to the next steps.
   </p>
<p>
    The die was cast.
   </p>
<p>
    There was no turning back now.
   </p>
<p>
    “This is my mess. I can foot the bill,” Agatha said, her tone firm but weary, the weight of responsibility pressing down on her shoulders.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia clicked her tongue in disapproval, her expression hardening as she stepped into Agatha’s personal space—looking her dead in the eye.
   </p>
<p>
    “No,” Lilia said firmly, her voice carrying a finality that left no room for argument. “They come after one of us, they come after all of us.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the unwavering solidarity in Lilia’s tone. She opened her mouth to protest, but the look in Lilia’s eyes made her stop.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t just determination.
   </p>
<p>
    It was loyalty—unshakeable and fierce.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen and Alice followed suit, stepping forward to join Lilia, forming an unspoken wall around Agatha. None of them said a word, but their expressions mirrored Lilia’s resolve.
   </p>
<p>
    The message was clear:
    <em>
     if they wanted Agatha, they had to get through them first.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    For the first time in a long time, Agatha felt something unfamiliar but not unwelcome—a strange, quiet relief.
   </p>
<p>
    She wasn’t alone.
   </p>
<p>
    She swallowed hard, forcing down the swell of emotion that curled inside her. It was comforting in a way that made her uneasy, something she wasn’t used to letting herself feel.
   </p>
<p>
    The silence stretched, heavy but not uncomfortable, and Agatha shifted, her usual sharp edge creeping back in to steady herself.
   </p>
<p>
    “I swear to god, if one of you tries to hug me, I will hit you,” she deadpanned, breaking the moment.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen snorted, Alice let out a bark of laughter, and even Lilia’s lips twitched into the faintest hint of a smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “Don’t flatter yourself, Harkness,” Alice teased.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes, but the tension in the room eased, replaced by a quiet, determined unity. Whatever came next, she wasn’t facing it alone—and for once, she let herself accept that.
   </p>
<p>
    “What are we doing about Vidal?” Jen asked, breaking the moment, her eyes narrowing as she shot Agatha a look that made it clear she wasn’t letting go of the topic anytime soon.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha met her gaze, a flicker of frustration crossing her features before she sighed, running a hand through her hair.
   </p>
<p>
    “She needs her own security detail. So does Nicky.” Agatha’s voice softened, a rare vulnerability slipping through her usually sharp exterior. “But I don’t want either of them to know.”
   </p>
<p>
    Jen raised a brow at that, giving Agatha a look.
   </p>
<p>
    “I understand not wanting Nicky to know,” she said cautiously. “But Vidal—she should know.”
   </p>
<p>
    “No,” Agatha growled, her tone brooking no argument. “This is my mess.
    <em>
     She doesn’t need to know
    </em>
    . I’ll take her off the case. She can report to you.”
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Me
    </em>
    ?” Jen asked, startled.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes, exasperation etched into her features.
   </p>
<p>
    “Don’t act like you don’t want her on your team,” she hissed. “She’s the best associate we’ve seen walk through these doors in years.”
   </p>
<p>
    Alice raised her hand, looking between them.
   </p>
<p>
    “Umm — why does Jen get her?” she asked, clearly offended.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose.
   </p>
<p>
    “I don’t care—you can share her for all I care. But she
    <em>
     cannot
    </em>
    work for me anymore,” Agatha said, her tone clipped, frustration rolling off her in waves.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh yeah?” Jen shot back mockingly. “Did you come to that
    <em>
     brilliant conclusion
    </em>
    before or after you slept with her?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes narrowed dangerously, and her middle finger shot up in a gesture that felt almost reflexive.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh... real cute,” Jen muttered, matching Agatha’s glare with a pointed look of her own, her voice dripping with sarcasm.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha opened her mouth to fire back, because, honestly, she
    <em>
     needed
    </em>
    this—the back and forth, the sharp exchange. It was grounding, familiar, almost comforting in its absurdity.
   </p>
<p>
    “Um... Agatha,” Lilia interjected, her tone hesitant but firm.
   </p>
<p>
    “What?” Agatha snapped, turning to her.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia tilted her head to the side, subtly nodding toward the glass door. Agatha followed her gaze, and her heart nearly stopped.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stood outside the door, arms crossed over her chest, her sharp eyes narrowed at Agatha. The weight of her gaze was enough to make Agatha feel like she was back in the principal’s office, caught red-handed.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Ohhh... someone’s in trouble
    </em>
    ,” Jen sang, her delight barely concealed, leaning slightly toward Agatha with a smug grin.
   </p>
<p>
    “Jen,” Agatha hissed, whirling on her with all the fury she could muster. “I swear to god, I will break
    <em>
     every single crystal
    </em>
    in this fucking office.”
   </p>
<p>
    Jen’s eyes widened briefly before she composed herself, fixing Agatha with a serious look.
   </p>
<p>
    “That’s like...
    <em>
     really
    </em>
    bad karma, Agatha. So, just know—that’s on you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out an exasperated growl, bringing her hands up in a mock-strangling motion, teeth bared.
   </p>
<p>
    “Nope!” Lilia interjected, stepping in like the seasoned peacekeeper she was. Her tone was calm but firm, cutting through the escalating tension. “We’re not doing this. We’re going to call the security detail. They have a rapid response team, and I’m sure they’ll be here shortly to discuss logistics.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, leveling Agatha with a look that was as unimpressed as it was pointed.
   </p>
<p>
    “You, however, clearly have...” she paused, her eyes drifting to the door where Rio stood waiting, “other things to work out.”
   </p>
<p>
    Without missing a beat, Lilia turned on her heel and began ushering Jen and Alice out of the office.
   </p>
<p>
    “Come on, you two,” Lilia said, waving them forward with a no-nonsense tone. “Let’s give her some space.”
   </p>
<p>
    “This is
    <em>
     literally
    </em>
    my office,” Jen muttered, crossing her arms, but she begrudgingly followed Lilia and Alice out.
   </p>
<p>
    As the three exited, Agatha felt a strange, uncomfortable pull in her stomach, a mix of relief and apprehension. Thankfully, they only gave Rio passing glances as they moved by, though the tension in the air was palpable.
   </p>
<p>
    And just as the door almost swung shut, Rio caught it and stepped inside.
   </p>
<p>
    She was dressed haphazardly—jeans and a seater that hung slightly askew, and Agatha couldn’t help but notice she was wearing two mismatched white sneakers. Her damp hair clung to her shoulders in uneven waves, and the darker patch on her sweater betrayed where the water had soaked in.
   </p>
<p>
    But it wasn’t Rio’s thrown-together appearance that made Agatha’s throat tighten—it was the look on her face.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio wasn’t just unhappy.
   </p>
<p>
    She was pissed.
   </p>
<p>
    "You were supposed to stay home," Agatha said, her throat tightening as the words slipped out, almost strangled.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s jaw clenched, her eyes narrowing into a sharp glare that seemed to slice through the space between them.
   </p>
<p>
    “Don’t,” Rio growled, stepping forward, her tone low and dangerous. “What was that?
    <em>
     Huh?
    </em>
    You just took off, Agatha. No explanation, no nothing. What in the hell is going—”
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice faltered mid-sentence, her eyes snapping downward. Agatha instinctively followed her gaze, and her heart sank.
   </p>
<p>
    The photos—
    <em>
     those fucking photos
    </em>
    —were scattered across the table.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a loud, exasperated sigh, her frustration bubbling over.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Fucking Jen
    </em>
    ,” she muttered under her breath, pinching the bridge of her nose.
   </p>
<p>
    So much for keeping this under wraps.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s gaze darted over the images, her expression shifting from confusion to something darker—something colder, more focused.
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, then stepped up to the table, and Agatha could do nothing but watch, frozen as her heart lurched painfully in her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s fingers ghosted across the handwritten threat first, her touch featherlight, before moving deliberately to the photos. One by one, she slid them aside, her movements slow and methodical, as if she were dissecting a case. Her jaw tightened with every new image revealed, but she remained silent, her focus razor-sharp.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, she reached the last photo—the one of her and Nicky sitting on the park bench.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s hand recoiled like the picture had burned her, her breath catching audibly as her eyes shot up, locking on Agatha’s.
   </p>
<p>
    “They threatened your son.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice was low, trembling at the edges, but there was no mistaking the fury behind it.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, her chest tightening. There were dozens of pictures on the table—all of Rio. Her privacy invaded, her every move documented, her very life threatened —and yet, Rio hadn’t so much as flinched.
   </p>
<p>
    But the moment she saw Nicky’s picture, her composure cracked.
   </p>
<p>
    The sharp edge of Rio’s protectiveness hit her like a freight train, leaving her momentarily speechless.
   </p>
<p>
    Her lips parted, but no words came out. What could she even say?
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha wasn’t sure what rattled her more—Rio’s fury or the undeniable fact that it wasn’t directed at her, but
    <em>
     for her
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Her throat tightened, and she swallowed hard before nodding.
   </p>
<p>
    “And you,” she added, her voice quieter, pointing out the obvious with a gesture toward the photos.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s jaw tightened, her eyes flicking back to Agatha, dark and unrelenting.
   </p>
<p>
    “I am an adult. I can handle some threats,” she said, her tone firm, almost defiant. “But Nicky?” She shook her head, her hand pressing flat against the table as if anchoring herself. “This is crossing a line, Agatha.”
   </p>
<p>
    “I know,” Agatha murmured, her voice breaking slightly. “You think I don’t know?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t flinch, her steady gaze fixed on Agatha, unyielding.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” she said again, and the sound of her name hit like a strike to the chest.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shut her eyes tightly. Only Rio could say her name like that—with reverence, like it was precious, but always tinged with so much exasperation, like it also annoyed the hell out of her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     It fit.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “You don’t get to use this as an excuse to push me away,” Rio said, her voice soft but firm, cutting through the tension.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes snapped open, wide with disbelief.
   </p>
<p>
    “An excuse?” she echoed, her voice rising with incredulity. The words barely left her mouth before anger flared hot and bright.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     An excuse
    </em>
    ?” she repeated, stepping closer to Rio, her hands flicking restlessly at her side. “They are threatening to kill you, Rio! Do you understand that? They’ve been following you for weeks—
    <em>
     weeks
    </em>
    ! They know where you live.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice cracked, but she pushed on, unable to stop the torrent now.
   </p>
<p>
    “The same black Cadillac that sat outside Brooke Sinclair’s house before they murdered her was parked outside
    <em>
     your building
    </em>
    today. Did you know that?
    <em>
     Did you?
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice sharpened, raw with emotion.
   </p>
<p>
    “Do you have
    <em>
     any idea
    </em>
    how much danger you’re in? How much danger
    <em>
     I’ve
    </em>
    put you in just by being near you?”
   </p>
<p>
    Her chest heaved as the last words fell, her fury born from a place so deep she wasn’t sure if it was directed at Rio, the situation, or herself.
   </p>
<p>
    Probably all three.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t step back. She didn’t flinch or shrink from the fire in Agatha’s words. Instead, she stood her ground, her jaw tightening as she absorbed every word, letting the anger and fear wash over her like a storm she born to weather.
   </p>
<p>
    “Are you done?” Rio asked quietly, her voice calm, almost too calm, and that only made Agatha’s frustration burn hotter.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Done
    </em>
    ?” Agatha snapped, her hands gesturing wildly. “No, I’m not done, Rio! I am trying to save your goddamn life, and you’re standing there acting like this is some—some minor inconvenience!”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips pressed into a thin line, and her eyes softened—just enough to make Agatha’s breath catch.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m not standing here acting like this doesn’t scare me,” Rio said evenly, her voice steady but firm. “You think I’m not terrified? That I’m not thinking about what could happen? To you? To Nicky?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s mouth opened to respond, but Rio didn’t let her. She stepped closer, closing the small distance between them.
   </p>
<p>
    “But this?” Rio gestured between them, her voice softer now, but no less determined. “W
    <em>
     e’re not running from it
    </em>
    . You don’t get to decide for me that it’s over because you’re scared.”
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m not scared—” Agatha began, but Rio cut her off with a look so piercing it felt like a sliced right through Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, you are,” Rio said simply. “You’re scared, and you’re trying to protect me by pushing me away. But that’s not your call to make, Agatha.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart hammered in her chest, the weight of Rio’s words pressing down on her as the anxiety curled inside her. Her mind drifted—back to the last moment she felt like this—to the hospital room, to the smell of antiseptic and the relentless beeping of monitors.
   </p>
<p>
    She remembered how sat there, powerless, watching her son struggle to breathe, her hands trembling because there was nothing she could do. She didn’t have the power to protect him then. She’d been so helpless.
   </p>
<p>
    But now?
   </p>
<p>
    Now, she had the power. She could protect Rio. She just needed to walk away.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Because if something happened to Rio...
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The thought slammed into her chest like a freight train, and her breath hitched.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     If something happened to Rio, she would never forgive herself.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The idea was unbearable, the kind of loss that would shred her to pieces. She couldn’t lose someone she—
   </p>
<p>
    Her anxiety twisted and curled inside her. Her throat tightened, and she looked at Rio, standing there, refusing to back down.
    <em>
     Refusing to let Agatha push her away.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her voice, when she finally found it, was hoarse.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio, if something happened to you...” She trailed off, the words caught in her throat, the weight of them too heavy to bear.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stepped closer, her expression softening, her voice low but steady.
   </p>
<p>
    “If something happened to me, it wouldn’t be because of you, Agatha. It would be because of them. And I refuse to let them take this—us—away.
    <em>
     Do you hear me?
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her chest tightening as emotions swirled like a storm, threatening to consume her. She turned her head, looking anywhere but at Rio, trying to muster the strength to do what she thought she
    <em>
     had
    </em>
    to do.
   </p>
<p>
    To push through this,
    <em>
     to protect.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    But then, softly, Rio’s voice broke through her resolve.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Agatha
    </em>
    ,” Rio murmured, her tone gentle but firm. “Look at me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha squeezed her eyes shut even tighter, her fists clenching at her sides.
   </p>
<p>
    She couldn’t.
   </p>
<p>
    She
    <em>
     wouldn’t.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Because if she looked—if she gave Rio that moment—then every last shred of her defenses would come crashing down.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She knew it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Baby
    </em>
    ,” Rio said again, her voice coaxing and low, brushing against Agatha’s frayed nerves. “Just look at me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her heart clenched painfully at the word, her breath catching in her throat. And before she could stop herself, her eyes snapped open, glaring at Rio with as much defiance as she could muster.
   </p>
<p>
    “You know I don’t like it when you call me that,” she snapped, her tone sharper than she intended, a desperate attempt to reclaim some ground.
   </p>
<p>
    But Rio didn’t flinch.
   </p>
<p>
    Instead, she smirked—that infuriatingly confident, knowing smirk that somehow both grounded and disarmed Agatha all at once.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, you do,” Rio said, her voice quiet, teasing. “You just don’t want to admit it.”
   </p>
<p>
    She reached up, her fingers brushing gently against Agatha’s cheek, tucking a stray strand of hair back behind her ear.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed heavily at the touch, the fight leaving her in one exhale.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio—”
   </p>
<p>
    “I love you,” Rio interrupted, her voice cutting through the chaos with unshakable certainty.
   </p>
<p>
    The words hung in the air, a soft yet powerful truth that made Agatha’s heart skip and stutter. For a moment, all she could do was stare, her mind racing to catch up with the reality of what Rio had just said.
   </p>
<p>
    “You—” she stuttered. “You don’t...mean that,” she said softly, her voice trembling despite her best efforts to keep it steady. Her chest felt impossibly tight, her heart pounding in a chaotic rhythm.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t flinch.
   </p>
<p>
    “I wouldn’t say it if I didn’t mean it. You know that,” she said simply, her voice calm, her hand still brushing softly against Agatha’s face.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shook her head, trying to step back, trying to put distance between them, but Rio didn’t let her. She followed, stepping closer, her hand moving to cup Agatha’s cheek.
   </p>
<p>
    “I love you, Agatha Harkness,” said Rio, doubling down. “All of you. The good, the bad, and
    <em>
     the incredibly stubborn.
    </em>
    And I’m not going anywhere.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her throat tight as her eyes searched Rio’s, looking for any hint of doubt, of hesitation.
   </p>
<p>
    Unsurprisingly, there was none.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was as she always was—steady, grounded, a calm force in the middle of Agatha’s storm.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, just like that, Agatha’s defenses crumbled.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re impossible,” Agatha muttered, her voice cracking ever so slightly, though any attempt at irritation was overshadowed by the heavy surrender seeping into her tone.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio smiled, her thumb brushing lightly over Agatha’s cheek, her touch soft and grounding.
   </p>
<p>
    “You love it,” she teased, her voice warm and gentle, but laced with that playful confidence that always managed to make Agatha’s heart stutter.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha closed her eyes, letting herself lean, just for a moment, into the warmth of Rio’s touch.
   </p>
<p>
    Letting the words linger in the air.
   </p>
<p>
    Letting the moment—
    <em>
     just be
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    “God help me,” Agatha found herself murmuring, her voice barely more than a whisper. She opened her eyes, meeting Rio’s gaze, her chest tight with something she could finally name.
   </p>
<p>
    The words tumbled out, unstoppable, even if she had wanted to hold them back.
   </p>
<p>
    “But I think I do.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes widened briefly in surprise, her lips twitching upward.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yeah?” she asked softly, the astonishment in her tone impossible to miss.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shot her a look, one that clearly said,
    <em>
     Don’t push your luck. That’s all you’re getting.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk deepened, mischievous and knowing, and she leaned forward, her lips brushing dangerously close to Agatha’s.
   </p>
<p>
    But just before they met, Agatha pulled back, her breath catching as her lips hovered over Rio’s.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio...this is incredibly reckless,” she whispered, her voice trembling slightly, her words more of an observation than a protest.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re Agatha Harkness,” Rio murmured in return, her tone low and brimming with a kind of want that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. “Isn’t that, like, your trademark?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha huffed softly, a mix of amusement and resignation slipping from her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Whatever retort she might have had dissolved as she leaned forward, her movements instinctive, driven by something deeper. When her lips met Rio’s, the kiss wasn’t just heated —it was
    <em>
     relief.
    </em>
<em>
     Knock. Knock.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her lips still brushing against Rio’s, her breath catching as her eyes darted over Rio’s shoulder.
   </p>
<p>
    And there they were.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia, Jen, and Alice stood just outside the glass door, each wearing expressions ranging from barely-contained surprise to outright shock. Behing them, she could see men and women in suits filtering into the hamster cage.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen mouth was agape like she couldn’t believe what was she was seeing. Lilia’s face was carefully neutral, though her eyes sparkled with amusement. Alice,
    <em>
     predictably
    </em>
    , was grinning like an idiot.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a quiet groan, pulling her lips away and resting her forehead falling against Rio’s shoulder as she muttered, “I’m never going to hear the end of this.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio chuckled softly, the sound low and warm, as Agatha lifted her head and met her gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    “Go to my office,” Agatha murmured, her voice firm but carrying an undercurrent of something gentler.
   </p>
<p>
    Her hand came up, squeezing Rio’s arm in reassurance.
   </p>
<p>
    “Wait for me there. I need to finalize the security arrangements, and then we’re going to talk —about your personal security detail and future assignments.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s expression shifted, the humor melting away as the weight of the situation settled back in. She gave a solemn nod, understanding the gravity of Agatha’s words. Without another word, she stepped back, her gaze lingering on Agatha for just a moment before turning and heading out.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t so much as spare a glance at the other partners as she walked away.
   </p>
<p>
    "
    <em>
     Te veo
    </em>
    ," she said over her shoulder, her tone effortlessly self-assured.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t help but notice the way the seasoned lawyers seemed to completely lose control of their reactions. Their eyes widened, and like magnets, every head turned and tracked Rio as she walked down the corridor.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a slow, measured breath, taking advantage of their distraction. She squared her shoulders and stepped forward to meet them, her expression calm but her eyes sharp, already bracing for whatever comments or looks were coming her way.
   </p>
<p>
    Unsurprisingly, Jen was the first to pounce.
   </p>
<p>
    “In my office—
    <em>
     my sacred temple
    </em>
    —you bring your depravity?” she hissed, her voice dripping with outrage.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes at the theatrics, folding her arms across her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    “It was
    <em>
     just
    </em>
    a kiss, Jen,” she retorted, leveling her with a pointed look. “It’s not like I bent her over your desk and fucked her.”
   </p>
<p>
    Jen’s eyes widened, her mouth opening and closing as if she couldn’t decide whether to be horrified or begrudgingly impressed. Finally, she huffed, muttering something under her
   </p>
<p>
    breath about needing to burn more sage and cleanse the energy in her office as she stomped away.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia, let out a poorly stifled laugh before stepping closer to Agatha. She touched Agatha’s arm lightly and leaned in as though she were about to share a secret, though her voice was far too loud for any pretense of discretion.
   </p>
<p>
    “I have a good feeling about you two,” she said, gesturing between Agatha and Rio’s retreating figure with a pleased smile. “I’m usually right about these things,” she added, tapping her temple for emphasis.
   </p>
<p>
    She started to walk away but paused mid-step.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh—and don’t forget, you need to submit a workplace relationship disclosure to HR immediately,” she said, her tone slipping seamlessly into partner authority as she shot Agatha a pointed look. Then, with a satisfied nod, she followed Jen toward the conference room.
   </p>
<p>
    That left Agatha standing with Alice in a silence so thick it felt like a living thing.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha waited, crossing her arms and glaring, but Alice just stood there, hands in her pockets, clearly enjoying herself. When the silence became too much, Agatha snapped.
   </p>
<p>
    “And you? What do you have to say?” she demanded, throwing her hands up in exasperation. “Go on—let’s hear it!”
   </p>
<p>
    Alice raised her hands in mock surrender, her face carefully neutral, though her eyes sparkled with barely contained amusement.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’ve got nothing,” she said casually, but as the words hung in the air, a sly smirk crept onto her face. “I mean—I get it. She’s hot. Good for you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes went wide, caught completely off guard by Alice’s casual remark.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh—,” she stammered, the rare sensation of a blush creeping up her neck and heating her cheeks. “Umm...thanks?”
   </p>
<p>
    Alice nodded, and walked forward, with a little skip in her step, but then paused halfway down the hallway.
   </p>
<p>
    “Does she have an older brother—
    <em>
     or a sister
    </em>
    ? I’m not picky. Emphasis on the older though. I don't want to go to jail,” Alice quipped, her grin widening with that signature devilish delight.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     And there it was.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha groaned, throwing a sharp glare her way.
   </p>
<p>
    “I hate all of you,” she muttered, her voice low and drenched in exasperation, though the faintest hint of a smirk betrayed her true feelings.
   </p>
<p>
    Alice chuckled, clearly pleased with herself, before striding toward the conference room without another word, leaving Agatha standing alone.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed heavily, running a hand through her hair. A thousand thoughts swirled in her mind, too many for her to grasp all at once.
   </p>
<p>
    There was the trial—a battle years in the making.
   </p>
<p>
    A white whale to spear.
   </p>
<p>
    A family she had vowed to bring peace to.
   </p>
<p>
    And most importantly,
    <em>
     Agatha had people to protect.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    And of course, tangled somewhere in the chaos of it all, she had a relationship—a messy, maddening,
    <em>
     exhilarating
    </em>
    relationship—that she somehow needed to figure out.
   </p>
<p>
    For all of Agatha’s sharp edges and complications, for all the barriers she instinctively raised, there was no denying that what she had found with Rio was real.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Something worth fighting for.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha straightened, her resolve hardening into something unbreakable, her thoughts razor- sharp as they honed in on a single, undeniable truth.
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard had made a big fucking mistake.
   </p>
<p>
    Threatening her? That was one thing. A calculated risk they likely thought they could control.
   </p>
<p>
    But coming for the people she loved?
   </p>
<p>
    Oh, that unleashed something entirely different within her—
    <em>
     a new monster
    </em>
    , fiercer and more ruthless than they could have ever imagined.
   </p>
<p>
    She was the Witch of Wall Street, and Vanguard thought they had her tied to the pyre, flames licking at her heels, ready to burn her down.
   </p>
<p>
    But they had underestimated her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     They always underestimated her.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha smirked, the kind of smirk that sent chills down spines and made people reconsider their life choices.
   </p>
<p>
    Because Vanguard didn’t realize one thing:
    <em>
     Agatha Harkness didn’t burn.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She took every attack hurled her way, let it fuel her, transformed it into
    <em>
     her power
    </em>
    , and unleashed it back at them a thousand times stronger.
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard had no idea what was coming.
   </p>
<p>
    But they would.
   </p>
<p>
    Oh, they would.

   Chapter End Notes
  </p>
<p>
   Wasn't that fun? Still hate me?
  </p>
<p>
   Also, I loved the coven dynamic here. I watched the Marvel Studios Assembled: The Making of Agatha All Along, and
        Kathryn Hahn ends it with a quote, "for a a show about covenless witch, I sure need my coven." and I wanted to
        bring that same dynamic into this chapter. Agatha Harkness, even in the AU, needs her coven.
  </p>
<p>
   Also, the Jen/Agatha dynamic in this chapter had me literally kicking my feet while typing. So much fun to
        write!

```
Agatha jammed her key into the lock, the click echoing in the quiet hallway. She pushed the door open but stepped aside immediately, allowing the team of security agents to move past her like a tactical wave. They entered her home with precision, spreading out to sweep every corner for bugs and to install new surveillance cameras.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t enter, instead she just leaned against the wall in the dim hallway, arms crossed as her head tilted back to rest against the hard surface. Her eyes fluttered shut, and for a brief moment, she allowed herself to sag, her body barely upright from sheer exhaustion.
   </p>
<p>
    The muted sounds of the team working inside her home echoed out into the hallway, but she barely registered it, her thoughts scattered and weighed down.
   </p>
<p>
    The security firm was, as promised , thorough and relentless. They’d swept the office earlier that evening, uncovering two bugs and a hidden micro-camera nestled in a potted plant just outside the war room.
   </p>
<p>
    Fucking Vanguard.
   </p>
<p>
    The anger flared momentarily before exhaustion snuffed it out. Because once the office was secure, the security firm turned the protection plan—one for Nicky, one for her, and one for Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    The meeting had been draining.
   </p>
<p>
    The team’s first suggestion was a safe house for all three of them. Agatha had shot that down immediately. She wasn’t about to uproot Nicky’s life or her own.
   </p>
<p>
    And that is when the conversation turned to Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Her building had been clearly been compromised.
   </p>
<p>
    A hotel was suggested, but Rio’s silence had spoken volumes on what she thought of that. Agatha had seen the tension in her jaw, the stiffness in her posture.
   </p>
<p>
    And then Agatha had spoken before thinking it through.
   </p>
<p>
    "Would it just be easier if we were all in the same place?" she had asked, her tone weary but resigned.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s head had snapped toward her, surprise clear in her wide eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” one of the team members had replied. “Which is why we suggested the safe house.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Then Rio can stay at my place,” Agatha had said, the words tumbling out as if decided by some part of her she couldn’t control.
   </p>
<p>
    She’d ignored Rio’s startled look and, more importantly, refused to meet any of the other partners knowing smirk from across the table.
   </p>
<p>
    “I have three spare bedrooms,” she added matter-of-factly, as if that completely dismissed any thought of impropriety.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen had scoffed, her eyebrows shooting up in disbelief, but blessedly, she’d kept her mouth shut.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Smart.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha had been teetering on the edge of her patience by the end of that meeting, and it wasn’t completely outside the realm of possibility that she’d lose her shit and launch herself across the table at her.
   </p>
<p>
    And now, as she stood in her hallway, listening to the faint buzz of the security team’s work, she replayed that particularly reckless moment in her mind.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio staying at her place.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Jesus. What in the hell was she thinking?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The sound of boots approaching the doorway brought her back to the present. One of the security agents stepped out, giving her a nod.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s clear. We’ll need about an hour to finish installing the cameras.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha returned the nod.
   </p>
<p>
    “Everywhere but the bathrooms and bedrooms, as discussed.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, ma’am.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her jaw tightened.
   </p>
<p>
    “Don’t call me ma’am.”
   </p>
<p>
    The security agent blinked, then recovered quickly, nodding again.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, Ms. Harkness.”
   </p>
<p>
    He turned and walked back into her home, leaving Agatha in the hallway once more.
   </p>
<p>
    She let out a heavy sigh, her head lolling to the side to the quite presence next to her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was standing there, leaning casually against the wall a few feet away. In her hand, she held an army green duffle bag, the strap loose and hanging from her fingers. Her dark eyes met Agatha’s, unreadable, and the sight sent a strange twist of emotion curling through Agatha’s chest.
   </p>
<p>
    This was such a terrible idea.
   </p>
<p>
    "You ready?" Agatha asked, her voice attempting confidence but landing somewhere closer to the sound of ice cracking across the northern icefields under the relentless weight of global warming.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio, of course, immediately picked up on it. Her eyes softened, her stance relaxing as she shifted the duffle to her other hand.
   </p>
<p>
    “You don’t have to do this,” she said quietly, her voice carrying the weight of both of their unspoken concerns.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha straightened, forcing her shoulders back as if sheer posture could silence the war inside her head.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     I do
    </em>
    , actually,” she replied, her tone sharper than she intended.
   </p>
<p>
    She sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose before meeting Rio’s gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s not safe for you at your place. It’s not safe for you anywhere, really, except here.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words hung in the air, heavier than Agatha intended, as the anxiety that had been simmering all evening curled tighter in her chest. It wasn’t a gentle, passing storm anymore. It was the kind that rattled windows and snapped tree branches, building momentum just beneath the surface.
   </p>
<p>
    Not a full-blown tornado—
    <em>
     yet
    </em>
    —but the kind that left you constantly bracing for it and eyeing the basement door.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, forcing herself to push the storm back into its cage, even though it seemed like it was determined to claw its way out. She took a steadying breath, running her hand through her hair as she straightened her spine and pushed herself off the wall.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned her head slightly, just enough to glance at Rio over her shoulder.
   </p>
<p>
    "The hallway or the spare bedroom, your choice," Agatha said, her voice carefully measured, but teetering on the edge.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha moved into her home, forcing herself to follow the usual routine that had always kept her grounded.
   </p>
<p>
    Shoes off.
   </p>
<p>
    Coat hung neatly in the closet.
   </p>
<p>
    Purse on the front table.
   </p>
<p>
    Cell phone in hand.
   </p>
<p>
    Each step was deliberate, mechanical—a lifeline to cling to in the chaos.
   </p>
<p>
    Behind her, she heard Rio following the same steps. After all, this wasn’t her first time in Agatha’s home—
    <em>
     not her first rodeo.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    But as Agatha stepped into the living room, her sanctuary, the place that usually greeted her such calm, everything shifted. Her breath quickened, coming out in short, uneven bursts as her fingers twitched at her sides.
   </p>
<p>
    There were so many people here.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Too many.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Moving around her house like they belonged there, speaking in low voices, the sharp whirl of power tools slicing through the air.
   </p>
<p>
    It felt invasive, unsettling,
    <em>
     wrong
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    The storm inside her chest swelled, clouds thickening, swirling faster and faster. She could almost hear the warning sirens wailing in her mind.
   </p>
<p>
    This was her home,
    <em>
     her refuge
    </em>
    —and now—now it was just another battlefield.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her name, spoken softly but firmly, cut through the rising tide of chaos inside her. Like a small ray of light breaking through blackened clouds, it grounded her, pulling her back from the brink.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stood there, watching her with that look—intense, unyielding, and somehow infinitely understanding. The kind of look that told Agatha that Rio knew—knew exactly what was going on inside her, even if Agatha didn’t have the words to explain it.
   </p>
<p>
    “What room?” Rio asked, her voice calm but purposeful, anchoring Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a shaky breath, her eyes flicking toward the hallway like it held some elusive solution to somehow get her life back under her control.
   </p>
<p>
    “Second door on the right,” she murmured, her voice quieter than she intended.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio nodded, turning to go, but then she hesitated. She stopped mid-step and glanced back, her expression softening.
   </p>
<p>
    “Come with me,” she said, her tone firm but not harsh, more of a directive than a request. And then, she seemed to remember they weren’t alone, and caught herself. She adjusted the bag on her shoulder, and she softened further.
   </p>
<p>
    “I need your help.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha hesitated, her mind caught in a swirl of thoughts, but before she could consciously decide, her feet were already moving. Her body acted on instinct, as if it had bypassed her mind entirely—like it knew what she needed before she even did.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha followed Rio down the hallway, her teeth gritting every time she heard the sound of drills boring into her walls. Strangers brushed past her, their presence far too close in the already narrow space.
   </p>
<p>
    It made her skin crawl.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She hated this.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her life was being invaded.
   </p>
<p>
    Her walls were breached.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio opened the door at on the right stepped inside, pausing to wait for Agatha to follow before quietly shutting the door behind them. The relative silence was jarring, but the sounds from outside the door still crept in, like a shadow she couldn't quite escape.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes swept over the room. She hadn’t been in here in ages. Why would she? It wasn’t a space she used. But it was exactly as she remembered—simple yet elegant, understated in a way that still felt inviting.
   </p>
<p>
    It was the third nicest bedroom in the house, but the last one with its own en suite, a choice Agatha had made deliberately. She knew Rio would appreciate having her own bathroom—
    <em>
     her own space
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Then the sharp
    <em>
     bang
    </em>
    of a hammer echoed from elsewhere in the house, so loud it made her jump. Her teeth clenched hard enough to ache, her hands curling into fists at her sides.
   </p>
<p>
    The restless, anxious energy inside her clawed higher—
    <em>
     louder
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Rio moved past her, tossing her bag onto the bed without ceremony, before heading toward the open bathroom door. She stopped in the threshold, turned on the light, and then shifted to face Agatha, her gaze steady.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, she simply watched Agatha, something unreadable flickering in her eyes. Then, with a small tilt of her head, she gestured toward the bathroom.
   </p>
<p>
    “Come here.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stayed rooted where she was, her heels practically digging into the floor. She didn’t want to move. She didn’t want to be bossed around.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Not now
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Not with everything spiraling so wildly out of control.
   </p>
<p>
    Her jaw clenched as she fought against the wave of restlessness surging inside her. It was like holding back a dam ready to burst. Everything felt so precarious, like if even the smallest sliver of control was taken from her, she would shatter into a thousand pieces.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Rio saw it
    </em>
    —the tension in Agatha’s stance, the way her hands fisted at her sides, her breath coming just a little too fast. And as she did the sharp edges in her gaze softened, her expression shifting to something gentler, something...
    <em>
     patient
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Rio said softly, her voice steady but pleading. “
    <em>
     Please
    </em>
    , come here.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s shoulders slumped almost imperceptibly at the word.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Please.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It wasn’t a command.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t a demand.
   </p>
<p>
    It was a request, and it reached her in a way nothing else could.
   </p>
<p>
    Her throat tightened, but she forced herself to move, her steps slow and deliberate, until she crossed the threshold.
   </p>
<p>
    The bathroom was the smallest in the house—just enough space for a single sink, a toilet, and a decently sized tiled shower. The moment she stepped inside, the walls seemed to close in, pressing against her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     The weight of everythin
    </em>
    g—her office, her home, her family— being invaded, the constant noise, the fear and uncertainty—it built like a pressure cooker inside her chest. She felt like she was seconds away from snapping, seconds away from tearing into Rio, of letting the storm take control and consuming everything in its path.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, Rio reached past her and turned on the fan.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, startled by the sudden—
    <em>
     loud
    </em>
    , mechanical hum filling the small room. The anger that had been teetering on the edge of exploding shifted to confusion, as her mind tried to catch up with Rio’s actions.
   </p>
<p>
    Then suddenly, the sound of the fan drowned out
    <em>
     everything
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    No voices in her house.
   </p>
<p>
    No drills or hammers.
   </p>
<p>
    No footsteps echoing through the halls.
   </p>
<p>
    Just the steady, rhythmic whir of the fan.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha exhaled slowly, not even realizing she’d been holding her breath until that moment. The storm inside her didn’t vanish entirely, but it stilled—
    <em>
     just enough
    </em>
    —as the relentless chaos from outside was replaced by the steady, grounding
    <em>
     hum
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze found Rio, torn between irritation and gratitude.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha hated being read so easily, hated that Rio seemed to know exactly what she needed when she couldn’t even name it herself. And yet, she couldn’t deny the shift—that the suffocating grip on her chest had loosened,
    <em>
     if only slightly.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Rio stepped back, the bathroom not allowing her much space, but she moved until she was pressed against the opposite wall—giving Agatha as much a space as possible.
   </p>
<p>
    They stayed like that for a few moments, the hum of the fan filling the small space. The noise helped—
    <em>
     a little
    </em>
    —but that restless energy inside her refused to settle. It curled tighter and tighter, like a cloud threatening to touch down the earth, and destroy everything in its path.
   </p>
<p>
    “Tell me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s voice broke through the haze, soft but unwavering, cutting through Agatha’s spiraling thoughts.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, her gaze darting to Rio, who was watching her with that maddening mix of patience and understanding.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Tell me.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha knew what she meant. Rio was asking about her. About what was wrong—what was clawing at her from the inside out.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha opened her mouth, then shut it just as quickly.
   </p>
<p>
    How did she even begin to explain?
   </p>
<p>
    How did she put into words the relentless—
    <em>
     the suffocating
    </em>
    weight pressing down on her chest?
   </p>
<p>
    How her life felt like it was fracturing all around her?
   </p>
<p>
    Her fingers flexed at her sides, and she looked away, staring at the bathroom tiles as if they might offer her an answer.
   </p>
<p>
    But they didn’t.
   </p>
<p>
    So finally, she settled on the only words that seemed to fit, her voice raw and strained as hot tears frustration clouded her eyes.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     “I feel completely out of control.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha continued to stare at the tile, her vision blurring slightly as her fingers curled and twisted, the tremble in them betraying the storm building inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    Silence greeted her words.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, softly—barely audible over the hum of the fan—Rio spoke.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay.”
   </p>
<p>
    The word was simple, but the way she said it carried weight, a quiet understanding that wrapped around Agatha like a lifeline.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Okay
    </em>
    ,” Rio repeated, even softer this time.
   </p>
<p>
    Silence settled between them, heavy but not oppressive, as if the stillness itself were giving Agatha permission to just exist in the moment.
   </p>
<p>
    Then out of nowhere, Rio’s voice cut through the quiet, low and steady.
   </p>
<p>
    “Take it back.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, her eyes snapping open to meet Rio’s gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    “Take what back?” she bit out, confusion transforming into anger.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t even blink an eye. She just tilted her head, letting it rest against the wall, her expression soft yet charged with a simmering intensity that burned behind those dark eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    “All of it,” she said simply. “Your control. Your power. Everything you think you’ve lost.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words lingered, heavy with meaning, pressing into Agatha with a force she couldn’t ignore, like a flame licking at the edges of turned over oil tanker.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s right here, Agatha,” Rio continued, her voice roughening, taking on a raw edge. “The one thing you
    <em>
     can
    </em>
    control.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath hitched, the air in the room turning heavier, warmer, pressing against her like a tangible force.
   </p>
<p>
    A flush rose beneath her collar, creeping up her neck and spreading across her chest like wildfire. Without thinking, her hand shot up, tugging at the collar of the hoodie, desperate to relieve some of the pressure building within her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s gaze flicked to the movement, her dark eyes catching on Agatha’s restless hand. The look she gave wasn’t smug or triumphant—it was something far more intimate, something knowing. A quiet, unspoken challenge lingered there, but not one meant to provoke. No, this was something gentler, coaxing, as if she were carefully reaching for the storm Agatha was trying so desperately to hold at bay.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s okay,” murmured Rio, eyes flashing, as she gave a nod—like she was giving permission. “
    <em>
     Take it
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    And yet, Agatha held herself back.
   </p>
<p>
    The urge to act, to seize the control Rio was so willingly offering, clawed at her, relentless and sharp. She fought it with everything she had because she knew herself—knew the force of what simmered beneath her carefully maintained surface. Releasing it wasn’t something you unleashed on a person.
   </p>
<p>
    It needed containment.
   </p>
<p>
    Solitude, with a bottle of bourbon and dark thoughts.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t know what she was saying. Didn’t know what she was giving permission for Agatha to do. She couldn’t possibly understand the storm she was inviting in.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s fingers twisted restlessly at her sides, betraying the battle raging inside her. Her breathing quickened, her chest tightening as the heat and tension grew unbearable, each second stretching impossibly thin.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Agatha
    </em>
    ,” Rio murmured, her voice a low rasp that seemed to fill every corner of the small bathroom. Her gaze flicked down, honing in on Agatha’s restless, twisting fingers before lifting back to her face. There was no softness left in her expression now.
   </p>
<p>
    “All you have to do,” she continued, her words deliberate and laced with a challenge—daring Agatha to rise, “is take those restless,
    <em>
     beautiful
    </em>
    fingers of yours... and bury them—”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha moved before the sentence could fully land. She surged forward, her hands shooting up to cradle Rio’s face, gripping firmly as their mouths collided in a kiss so fierce it was almost bruising.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s head hit the wall with a loud thud, the sound reverberating through the small space. She gasped, her lips parting in shock, and Agatha seized the opening, her tongue slipping inside, devouring her like she was something Agatha had been starving for.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s hand tangled in Rio’s hair, her fingers gripping firmly at the roots, tugging just enough to control Rio’s movements. She held her exactly where she wanted her—no escape, no pushing back, just Rio completely at her mercy.
   </p>
<p>
    Their mouths clashed, Agatha’s lips moving with an intensity that bordered on desperate. She consumed Rio, her other hand braced against the wall beside Rio’s head, creating a barrier, a trap that kept her pinned in place.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s gasp was swallowed by Agatha’s dominance, her own hands twitching with the need to move, to respond, but Agatha’s hold made it clear—this wasn’t a moment for equals. This was Agatha seizing control, reclaiming the power she’d been grasping for all night, and Rio let her.
   </p>
<p>
    The rough pull of her hair had Rio groaning greedily against Agatha’s mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt the vibration of it and tugged harder, deepening the kiss, her tongue sweeping inside to claim more of Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Her grip tightened in Rio’s hair, her fingers curling at the nape of her neck as she gave a sharp tug. Rio gasped, her lips breaking away from Agatha’s, her head tilting back instinctively, exposing the long, graceful line of her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t waste a second. She descended on Rio’s neck with a ferocity that left no room for doubt. Her lips trailed along the delicate skin, alternating between soft, teasing brushes and sharp, biting kisses that left a path of heat in their wake. Each movement was deliberate, a claim etched into Rio’s flesh.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s breath hitched, her hands coming up to grip Agatha’s hips under her sweater, nails digging in as she tried to ground herself against the onslaught of sensation.
   </p>
<p>
    "
    <em>
     Agatha
    </em>
    ," she groaned, her voice shaky and barely audible over the white noise of the fan, but Agatha didn’t stop.
   </p>
<p>
    The sharp pull of Rio’s hair kept her right where Agatha wanted her, utterly exposed, unable to move, and completely at her mercy. The power of it coursed through Agatha like electricity, igniting something deep and primal within her. She bit down hard, enough to elicit a strangled moan from Rio, and soothed the spot with her tongue immediately after.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha was high on it—
    <em>
     too high.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Every piece of control she claimed from Rio felt like she was reclaiming a part of herself, slotting it back into place like a puzzle finally coming together.
   </p>
<p>
    And Rio... Rio didn’t say stop. She didn’t pull away or shy from the intensity of it.
   </p>
<p>
    If anything, she leaned into it—
    <em>
     into Agatha.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her breathy groans spilled out into the space between them, her hands tightening on Agatha’s hips as if she was anchoring herself in Agatha's storm, holding on for dear life.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” Rio breathed out, her voice husky and trembling, her chest rising and falling against Agatha’s with each shaky inhale. “Yes...
    <em>
     don’t stop
    </em>
    . Keep going.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her words were a spark to dry kindling, igniting something feral in Agatha, a need that burned hotter and brighter than anything she’d felt in years.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha pulled back from Rio’s throat, breathless, her chest heaving as she took in the sight before her. Rio, pinned against the wall, panting heavily, her eyes half-lidded, pupils blown wide with desire. She looked thoroughly wrecked—like she’d already been completely undone by Agatha—and yet, Agatha hadn’t even begun.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s earlier words echoed in her mind, low and teasing, but now they felt like a challenge:
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     “Take those restless fingers of yours... and bury them...”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips curved into a slow, predatory smirk, her hand tightening in Rio’s hair as she leaned in close, her breath ghosting over Rio’s parted lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “Turn around,” Agatha rasped, her voice thick and commanding, a tone she had never used on Rio before.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes widened just slightly, letting out a soft exhale, and then without hesitation, she obeyed, spinning on her heel to face the wall, her hands bracing against it for balance.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart pounded as she stepped closer, her hand sliding up Rio’s back, slow and deliberate, feeling the shiver that rippled through her in response. The storm inside Agatha hadn’t just calmed—it had transformed into something that leveled cities.
   </p>
<p>
    Her fingers moved with purpose, slipping over the curve of her hip before coming forward to the waistband of her jeans. With precise movements, Agatha unbuttoned them, pulling down the zipper slowly. The sound barely registered over the hum of the fan, but to Agatha, it seemed to echo, loud and deliberate, like a final boundary being crossed.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s breathing grew heavier, her shoulders rising and falling with every breath.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha pressed her front to Rio’s back, her arm wrapping tightly around Rio's middle to pull her closer. She felt the tremor running through Rio, the way her body seemed to shake under the weight of her own need, but not moving, just waiting—
    <em>
     waiting for Agatha to act.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha’s hand slid up Rio’s chest, fingers greedy as they palmed Rio’s breast roughly through the fabric of her sweater. She relished the sound of Rio’s groan, low and guttural, before moving her hand further up, higher, until her fingers wrapped firmly around Rio’s throat.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt the vibration of Rio's gasp under her palm, felt the way her breath hitched, and her control threatened to snap completely.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, with a precision that belayed how out of control she felt, Agatha's other hand slipped lower, sliding beneath the waistband of Rio’s underwear. And there it was—heat,
    <em>
     wetness
    </em>
    , and Rio arching into her touch like she’d been waiting for this moment forever.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Jesus Christ
    </em>
    ,” Agatha murmured under her breath, her voice rough with awe.
   </p>
<p>
    She wasn’t religious, had never been, but touching Rio in that moment—feeling the how much Rio wanted her and the moan that vibrated under her hand around Rio’s throat—
    <em>
     this
    </em>
    —this felt like heaven.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s grip tightened, and Rio instinctively tilted her head back to rest against Agatha’s shoulder, baring her throat fully. The act was so deliberate, so achingly vulnerable, that Agatha’s breath caught in her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, she froze, her lips hovering near Rio’s ear, taking in the sight of Rio’s exposed neck, her hand wrapped around it, the unspoken trust and sheer surrender of it. It was a sight that nearly undid her, and a low, shaky exhale escaped her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re mine, Rio,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling with equal parts possession and veneration. The words cutting through the space like a vow. Each syllable carrying a weight that was almost palpable, as though the truth of it had been etched into both of their souls long before they’d even met.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio whimpered softly at that—
    <em>
     a sound so delicate
    </em>
    , so unlike the deep, guttural noises that usually spilled from her lips when then Agatha touched her. And that sound— struck Agatha with more force than a scream ever could. It was a sound that spoke of surrender, of trust, of something so deeply intimate it almost stole Agatha’s breath.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s chest tightened, her hand instinctively tightening its hold on Rio, pulling her even closer, as though the mere idea of letting her go was unbearable. Agatha’s lips brushed against Rio’s temple, a kiss so featherlight it was almost reverent. She could feel the rapid flutter of Rio’s pulse beneath her thumb, could feel the way her body trembled in her arms, not from fear, but from something deeper—from being claimed, from being utterly, undeniably hers.
   </p>
<p>
    The moment stretched between them, as if the entire world had narrowed to just this—j
    <em>
     ust them
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha closed her eyes, exhaling slowly, feeling that truth settle deep in her bones.
   </p>
<p>
    For all her flaws, for all the chaos that surrounded her, this moment—
    <em>
     Rio
    </em>
    —was hers.
   </p>
<p>
    And nothing, no one—
    <em>
     no one
    </em>
    —would ever take that away.
   </p>
<p>
    And that thought spurred, Agatha forward.
   </p>
<p>
    She always prided herself on being a quick learner, and even now, from this new angle, she proved it. Her fingers moved with deliberate precision, seeking out exactly where Rio needed her most.
   </p>
<p>
    The groan that rumbled against her palm as she pressed against the sensitive bud beneath her fingers sent a thrill coursing through Agatha. She could feel Rio's every reaction—every shudder, every moan, every desperate gasp—burning into her palm.
   </p>
<p>
    The knowledge that she was the one unraveling Rio like this, piece by trembling piece, had Agatha’s heart tightening. She moved with purpose, applying just the right amount of pressure, her movements firm yet teasing, savoring every sound that spilled from Rio’s lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Fuck
    </em>
    , Agatha,” Rio groaned, her voice ragged and breathless, as she sagged back further into Agatha’s embrace. Her hips moved instinctively, canting with every deliberate circle of Agatha’s fingers.
   </p>
<p>
    The sound of her name on Rio’s lips sent a bolt of heat straight through Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     “Good girl,”
    </em>
    Agatha murmured against Rio’s ear, letting the words roll off her tongue with ease. The same words Rio had once teased her with, now seared between them,
    <em>
     and god
    </em>
    , it felt so good—better than she imagined, owning those words.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s reaction was immediate—another delicate whimper, and full-body shudder that left her trembling in Agatha’s arms.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha smirked against the shell of Rio’s ear, her fingers pressing tighter, more insistent. She could feel the tension winding through Rio, her control unraveling with every movement of Agatha’s fingers.
   </p>
<p>
    The shudder didn’t stop—it coursed through Rio like her body wasn’t even hers anymore, like she’d given it over completely to Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    "That's it," Agatha whispered, her voice low and possessive, brushing her lips against Rio’s jaw.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s breath hitched, her hand scrambling back to curl into Agatha's hair, anchoring herself as her head lolled against Agatha’s shoulder. Every moan, every tremor in her body, fed Agatha’s growing fire.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha adjusted her grip, tightening her hand around Rio's throat just enough, a silent command and promise all at once. Her fingers worked with precision, each movement relentless, circling and pressing in exactly the way Rio liked.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, Agatha felt it—the moment Rio was close.
   </p>
<p>
    It started with a guttural moan that reverberated under Agatha’s palm, raw and unrestrained. Then Rio’s fingers dug into Agatha’s hair, gripping tightly as though it were the only thing tethering her to the earth. And lastly, her body started trembling violently, a full-body quake that Agatha felt vibrate against her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Cum for me,
    <em>
     my love
    </em>
    ,” Agatha murmured, her voice a low command against Rio’s ear.
   </p>
<p>
    The words sent a visible shudder through Rio, her body responding instantly as she cried out. Her hips locked, thighs clenching tightly, trapping Agatha’s hand between them as her entire body shook uncontrollably.
   </p>
<p>
    Though her hand was pinned, Agatha didn’t relent, her fingers continuing to draw every last tremor, every aftershock from Rio’s body until she felt Rio finally sag against her, utterly spent.
   </p>
<p>
    Only then did Agatha stop, her hand slipping away from Rio’s throat and out of her pants, at the same time, to wrap around her middle. It was as though she were physically holding Rio together, the only thing keeping her upright.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s breaths came in uneven gasps, her body trembling against Agatha’s steady frame.
   </p>
<p>
    And yet, even as Agatha held her close, feeling Rio’s surrender and the aftermath of her release, that restless energy still coursed through her. It was a need that hadn’t been sated, a hunger that demanded more.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes traveled over Rio’s form, hyper-aware of the way her body responded, how Rio could keep going—
    <em>
     and going
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha gave her a few more moments, letting her breathe, letting her come back to herself. Then her hands moved, glided down deliberately down Rio’s sides until they hooked into the waistband of her jeans and underwear.
   </p>
<p>
    “More,” she murmured, letting Rio know she wasn’t done.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio let out a surprised gasp, her head lifting slightly, but there was no protest. As soon as Agatha tugged the clothing down her hips, Rio stepped out of them without hesitation, kicking them off to the side. Her movements were quick but fluid, as though she already knew where this was going and was more than willing to follow Agatha’s lead.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha smirked, feeling that dark thrill rise within her again. Her hands moved back to Rio’s hips, steadying her, grounding them both. Humming with approval, she leaned in, her lips brushing against the sensitive shell of Rio’s ear.
   </p>
<p>
    “Off,” Agatha said slowly, her voice low and deliberate, as her hands reached around Rio, grabbing the hem of her sweater and pulling it upward. Rio raised her arms obediently, the fabric slipping over her head and landing somewhere off to the side. Underneath, she was wearing only a simple bra, and Agatha wasted no time unclasping it, letting it fall away before tossing it carelessly aside.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stood still, her back to Agatha, little gasps escaping her lips each time Agatha’s fingers or breath grazed newly exposed skin. She didn’t speak, didn’t move, but the tension in her body told Agatha everything she needed to know.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha took a moment to take her in.
   </p>
<p>
    The faint red lines of still-healing scratches marked Rio’s back—
    <em>
     her marks
    </em>
    —etched into Rio’s skin from earlier today. She leaned forward, pressing soft, deliberate kisses to each line, her lips soft as her hands moved to grasp one of Rio’s wrists.
   </p>
<p>
    She brought Rio’s hand forward, guiding it up rest against the cool tile of the wall next Rio's head. Agatha pressed her palm into it, a silent command conveyed in the way she lingered before repeating the same action with the other hand.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha lips brushed against Rio’s shoulder for one final kiss before leaning close to her ear.
   </p>
<p>
    “Bend over,” Agatha rasped, her voice thick with desire.
   </p>
<p>
    From her vantage point, she could see the shiver ripple down Rio’s spine, the visible tremor an undeniable response to her command.
   </p>
<p>
    The movement that followed was effortless, instinctive, as Rio obeyed without a moment's hesitation. Her body folded gracefully, hands pressing firmly against the cool wall for support.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s gaze trailed along Rio’s form, every curve and line etched in shadow and light, leaving her momentarily breathless. The sight of Rio like this—so utterly surrendered yet radiating power in her submission—lit a fire low in Agatha’s core.
   </p>
<p>
    She stepped closer, her hand gliding over the curve of Rio’s ass with a deliberate slowness that made Rio shift slightly, her breath hitching audibly. Agatha let her fingers dip between Rio’s folds, gathering her wetness, teasing her with featherlight touches before sliding one finger inside. Then another. Then a third, her fingers stretching Rio, filling her, as a guttural moan ripped through Rio’s body.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s snapped to Rio’s hands as they curled against the wall tiles, her fingers digging as though trying to anchor herself against the feeling Agatha was unleashing inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha's other hand gripped Rio’s hip firmly, grounding her, holding her steady, as her fingers moved with precision—curling, pressing, finding that spot inside that made Rio’s entire body quake.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck,” Rio groaned, her voice raw and trembling, as she instinctively rocked back into Agatha’s hand. The sheer intensity of her movement sent a thrill racing through Agatha, leaving her momentarily breathless.
   </p>
<p>
    For a fleeting second, Agatha paused, the urge to command Rio to stop—to reassert control —flashed through her mind. But the sight of Rio like this, so utterly consumed and shamelessly taking what she needed, was so breathtakingly sexy that it rendered Agatha speechless.
   </p>
<p>
    "
    <em>
     Agatha, please
    </em>
    ," Rio cried out, her voice trembling as she rolled herself against Agatha's fingers again, the desperation in her tone snapping Agatha out of her daze.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha surged closer, her body pressing into Rio's, her fingers moving faster now, matching the rhythm Rio’s body demanded.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio cried out again, the sound breaking into a breathless "
    <em>
     yes
    </em>
    " as she rolled back, meeting Agatha’s pace with an intensity that stole Agatha’s breath.
   </p>
<p>
    She felt it—the way Rio’s walls clenched around her fingers, the fluttering that signaled how close she was, the trembling in her legs as she struggled to stay upright.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha moved her free hand around Rio's body, her fingers finding their mark, brushing against Rio's clit in perfect rhythm with the curling of her fingers.
   </p>
<p>
    The sound that tore from Rio’s throat was unlike anything Agatha had ever heard—a raw, visceral mix of a scream and a moan that reverberated off the tiled walls.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sent up a silent prayer that the security agents were still drilling into her walls, because the solitude and fan were not going to hide that sound, as she moved her fingers deeper, curling them just right.
   </p>
<p>
    And then Agatha felt it—the sudden, tight clench around her fingers, followed by the unexpected rush of wetness coating her hand. It took her by surprise for a moment, and then the realization of what just happened hit her. And with it, a thrill coursed through her, as a new sense of power bloomed in her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck!” Rio cried out, her voice cracking as her legs buckled beneath her as if her orgasm just robbed her of any strength to stand.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha reacted instinctively, pulling her hands free and wrapping her arms around Rio’s waist.
   </p>
<p>
    “Easy,” Agatha murmured, her voice low and steady, as she eased them both down to the cool tiled floor. She cradled Rio against her, one arm wrapped securely around her waist while the other brushed through her hair. She pressed a gentle kiss to Rio’s forehead, feeling the lingering tremors rippling through her body.
   </p>
<p>
    It took a few quiet moments of just that—holding her, grounding her, letting Rio’s breath even out—before Agatha felt her finally relax, her body melting into her arms. Rio snuggled deeper against Agatha’s chest, as though it was the only safe place in the world.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, startled by the sight of Rio like this—not immediately bouncing back. She looked... soft, undone in a way Agatha had never witnessed before. Her eyes widened in mock disbelief, her lips twitching.
   </p>
<p>
    “Did I finally find your off button?” she teased, her voice light, but unable to stop the hint of pride seep into her tone.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio huffed, a sound that was half laugh, half exasperation. Her breath warmed Agatha’s collarbone before her voice came, muffled but unmistakable in its awe—and its possessiveness.
   </p>
<p>
    “Who in the fuck taught you how to do that?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t help the snort that escaped her, her lips twitching into a wry smile as she tightened her hold around Rio, pressing another kiss to the top of her head.
   </p>
<p>
    “You did,” she said with a huff, her tone teasing but warm. “You had the strap-on then, remember? I nearly passed out after? I figured, sans equipment, the mechanics were still the same—and looks like I was right.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio groaned into her chest, and even thought she couldn’t see it, it was impossible to miss the smile tugging at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “I want to hate how cocky you get when you’re right,” Rio muttered, her voice muffled against Agatha’s chest. She paused for a second before letting out a huff of air. “But it’s also annoyingly hot.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha smirked, running her fingers lazily through Rio’s damp hair.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, buckle up, darling,” Agatha drawled, her tone dripping with playful arrogance. “Because I’m rarely wrong. So, this is going to be quite the ride for you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio chuckled at that, her breath warm against Agatha’s neck as she shook her head, a soft laugh escaping her.
   </p>
<p>
    “As long as I’m the only one who gets to ride,” Rio murmured, her voice low and teasing, “then I think I can handle it.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s smirk deepened, her fingers threading lazily through Rio’s hair.
   </p>
<p>
    “Possessive, are we?” she quipped, raising an eyebrow.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio tilted her head up, her face dead serious.
   </p>
<p>
    “When it comes to you?
    <em>
     Absolutely
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt her chest tighten, but it wasn’t anxiety this time. She recognized it instantly, the clarity of Rio’s statement settling into her like a quiet revelation. Leaning down, she captured Rio’s lips in a kiss, firm and tender, grounding them both before pulling back.
   </p>
<p>
    “Good,” she murmured against her lips, her voice low and steady. “Because I don’t share well either.”
   </p>
<p>
    They held each other in the stillness that followed, the silence not empty but somehow full.
   </p>
<p>
    “How are you feeling?” Rio asked softly, breaking the quiet.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha paused, letting the question settle as she searched within herself. The storm was still there, but it was distant now, its edges softened. And in its wake, there was Rio—j
    <em>
     ust Rio.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    That presence alone, that anchor, settled her even more.
   </p>
<p>
    “Better,” she answered simply, truthfully.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio smiled faintly, murmuring, “Good.”
   </p>
<p>
    They sat like that for a while, wrapped in each other, letting the weight of the world fall away for a moment. Agatha felt a warmth spread through her, a strange but welcome sense of peace.
   </p>
<p>
    “Thank you,” Agatha said suddenly, her voice quiet but filled with sincerity. “I didn’t know I needed that. How did you know I needed that?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio shifted slightly, her head resting more comfortably against Agatha’s shoulder.
   </p>
<p>
    “Calculated guess,” she said with a small shrug, her tone light but her words heavy with meaning. “I feel the same way when my world starts spinning. We’re alike, you and I.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, letting the words sink in before continuing, her voice taking on a thoughtful edge.
   </p>
<p>
    “Power, surrender, control, submission—they’re powerful forces. They have this... way of shifting dynamics, of shifting
    <em>
     you.
    </em>
    They can unmake you, but they can also rebuild you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio paused, her head pulling back slightly, her gaze searching Agatha’s face as if looking for something unspoken, something she needed to see reflected back. Finally, she exhaled, her breath soft, her voice dipping into a vulnerable, almost hesitant tone.
   </p>
<p>
    “And I think...” Rio hesitated, her eyes lowering for a moment as if gathering her thoughts before meeting Agatha’s again, steady but unguarded. “I think I needed that as much as you did. I didn’t realize it until it was already happening, but I felt... unsteady too. With everything going on, all the chaos, I felt like I was losing my footing.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her lips quirked into a faint, self-aware smile before her expression softened again.
   </p>
<p>
    “But being with you like that—letting you take control—it wasn’t just grounding; it was freeing. Like I could let go, trust you to hold the reins, and everything would still be okay.”
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t lost on Agatha that Rio’s statement carried more weight than it seemed at first glance. Her words weren’t just about trusting Agatha to take control in the intimate moments they shared—they were layered, edged with deeper meaning.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio said she loved Agatha...she was trusting Agatha emotionally, letting her guard down in ways that Agatha knew didn’t come easily to her.
   </p>
<p>
    But it even went beyond that.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was also placing her faith in Agatha
    <em>
     physically
    </em>
    , trusting her to protect her when the threat from Vanguard loomed over them like a shadow.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t just about surrendering her body.
   </p>
<p>
    It was about surrendering her heart, her safety,
    <em>
     her very life.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The realization hit Agatha like a wave—heavy, powerful, and impossible to ignore.
   </p>
<p>
    Her throat tightened as she felt the enormity of it, the responsibility, the vulnerability Rio was offering her without hesitation. And for someone who spent her entire life avoiding vulnerability like the plague, it was both humbling and terrifying.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha exhaled slowly, leaning in to press a soft kiss to Rio’s temple, letting the gesture say everything her words couldn’t quite reach. As she did, her arms instinctively tightened around Rio, pulling her closer, like she was building a fortress of protection around her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio melted into the embrace, her breath evening out as she rested her head against Agatha’s chest.
   </p>
<p>
    And for a moment, the weight of the world seemed to fade.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha pressed her chin lightly against the top of Rio’s head, closing her eyes as she took in a deep breath. The storm inside her had calmed, the restless energy was replaced by something far more grounding. The promise that no matter what came next, she would be Rio’s shield— against Vanguard, against the world, against anything that dared to threaten what she had found with Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    The sudden vibration of her phone startled Agatha, pulling her back to the moment. Adjusting her hold on Rio, she fished it out of her pocket and glanced at the screen.
   </p>
<p>
    "Camera's are installed," she read aloud. "They just left."
   </p>
<p>
    Rio exhaled deeply, a sound of relief, but then she froze mid-breath, her body stiffening. Pulling back slightly, she looked at Agatha with a mix of confusion and dawning horror.
   </p>
<p>
    "They texted you instead of telling you in person?" she asked, her voice wary. Then her eyes widened as her gaze darted to the door. "Do you think they... heard us?"
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t stop the snort that escaped her.
   </p>
<p>
    "Us? No." she repeated, her tone laced with teasing disbelief. "You?
    <em>
     Absolutely
    </em>
    . I think the tenants two floors down probably heard you."
   </p>
<p>
    Her words were both a tease and a point of pride, her smirk widening as Rio’s cheeks flushed. There was something immensely satisfying about knowing she could make Rio lose control like that.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha watched the flush deepen as it rolled up Rio's neck, a faint color blooming across her cheeks.
   </p>
<p>
    Oh.
   </p>
<p>
    She liked that.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She liked it a lot.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Fuck,” Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands. “I hope none of them are on my security detail tomorrow.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha, never one to resist an opportunity to poke fun, slowly rose from the tiled floor, her joints protesting slightly—reminding her that, yes, she was too damn old to be sitting on hard tiles for that long.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, if they aren’t, I am certainly going to arrange for it,” she said casually, brushing off her knees as she stood.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio dropped her hands from her face and shot Agatha a glare, her eyes narrowing dangerously.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha smirked wickedly, extending a hand to help Rio up.
   </p>
<p>
    “What?” she said, her tone dripping with mock innocence. “Embarrassed?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio pursed her lips, clearly biting back a retort, and Agatha’s grin widened. She was just about to needle her further when her mind suddenly snapped to the reason for Rio’s
    <em>
     volume
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Her smirk softened into something sly as she flexed her hand at her side, the evidence of their earlier activities still slick against her palm.
   </p>
<p>
    “Speaking of
    <em>
     that
    </em>
    ,” she said, emphasizing the word with a wicked smirk.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio froze for half a second before immediately picking up on what Agatha was getting at, and huffing loudly, her cheeks flushing anew.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m going to bed,” she declared, spinning on her heel and striding into the bedroom.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha chuckled softly, grabbing a nearby towel to clean her hand before flipping off the bathroom light and fan, casting the space into quiet darkness. She followed Rio into the bedroom, her footsteps soft against the floor.
   </p>
<p>
    When she stepped inside, her eyes immediately locked on Rio, who was already under the comforter, her dark gaze fixed on Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    The playful banter that had filled the bathroom evaporated in an instant, leaving a charged silence hanging between them. Agatha froze in the doorway, her smirk fading as uncertainty crept in.
   </p>
<p>
    Now what? Was she supposed to just turn around, walk down the hall, and go back to her room?
   </p>
<p>
    That thought sparked an uncomfortable, restless movement in her chest, and before her mind could catch up, Agatha was already moving. She grabbed the arm of her sweater, tugging it off in one swift motion. Her bra followed, then her sweatpants, leaving her in just her underwear as she stepped toward the bed.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes tracked her every movement.
   </p>
<p>
    “Move over,” Agatha said, aiming for confidence but falling just short, her voice betraying a faint waver. “That’s my side.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio raised an eyebrow, a soft smile tugging at her lips. That smile made Agatha’s heart hammer harder than she’d ever admit. Without a word, Rio rolled over, making space.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha slid into bed, the sheets cool against her skin. She immediately reached out, wrapping an arm around Rio and pulling her close, her front pressed firmly to Rio’s back. Rio let out a contented sigh, melting into the embrace, and for a moment, the weight of the day seemed to settle around them, soft and bearable.
   </p>
<p>
    Their breaths slowed in tandem, their bodies sinking into the quiet.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s body may have relaxed, but her mind hadn’t caught up. It was still locked on that specific moment in the bathroom, replaying it over and over.
   </p>
<p>
    “So,” she started, unable to resist, “is
    <em>
     that
    </em>
    ... something that can happen often? Or is it like Christmas? You know, if it happens every day, it loses its holiday spirit?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stiffened briefly, then let out a snort, her body shaking with quiet laughter. Even though Agatha couldn’t see her face, she knew Rio was smiling.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     You did not
    </em>
    just compare me squirting to Santa Claus.”
   </p>
<p>
    “What?” Agatha teased, smirking against Rio’s shoulder. “It felt like a gift to me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio let out a choked laugh at that, the sound caught somewhere between exasperation and fondness. She fell quiet for a moment, and Agatha thought she might have drifted off. A pang of disappointment followed, but Agatha knew herself. She’d get her answer eventually—Rio had to know she wouldn’t let this go.
   </p>
<p>
    “I don’t know,” Rio murmured suddenly, her voice low and slightly shy. “I’ve never done...
    <em>
     that
    </em>
    ... before.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s jaw dropped, practically unhinging in shock. The silence hung thick for a moment before Rio glanced over her shoulder, catching Agatha’s expression.
   </p>
<p>
    Her groan filled the room.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh my god—you’re going to be insufferable now, aren’t you?”
   </p>
<p>
    The question snapped Agatha out of her stupor, and a smirk curved her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m
    <em>
     always
    </em>
    insufferable,” she quipped.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio huffed, a sound that carried the full weight of,
    <em>
     I couldn’t agree more.
    </em>
    Then, she let out a loud tired exhale, snuggling deeper into the pillow, clearly signaling that she was done entertaining this conversation.
   </p>
<p>
    But silence wasn’t enough to deter her. Agatha smirked, her chin resting against Rio’s shoulder as she spoke again, her tone teasing, playful.
   </p>
<p>
    “So, you’re saying it can happen again...”
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Agatha
    </em>
    ,” Rio groaned, her voice muffled by the pillow, “go to bed.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t hold back the chuckle that bubbled out of her. She kissed the back of Rio’s neck softly, letting her lips linger there for a moment before whispering.
   </p>
<p>
    “You didn’t say no.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio groaned louder this time.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yeah well, you will never hear me say yes again unless I get some fucking sleep,” grumbled Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha smirked faintly at Rio’s grumbled response, knowing she was teetering on the edge of pushing her luck. But even Agatha Harkness knew when to quit—
    <em>
     well, sometimes.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She went quiet, letting the teasing ebb away as she rested her head against the pillow, her arm still wrapped securely around Rio’s waist. The silence between them wasn’t awkward—it was comforting, soothing, a balm for the chaos that had surrounded them all day.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha exhaled slowly, her chest rising and falling in sync with Rio’s as she let herself relax, allowing her mind to finally settle. No more spiraling thoughts about security details or threats. No more nagging doubts about what was happening between them.
   </p>
<p>
    For now, there was just this—just holding Rio close, feeling her warmth, and knowing she was safe.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio let out a soft, contented hum, her body melting further into Agatha’s hold. The sound brought a faint, almost involuntary smile to Agatha’s lips. She pressed a kiss to the back of Rio’s head, her grip tightening ever so slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    And for the first time in what felt like forever, the storm inside Agatha was at rest.

   Chapter End Notes
  </p>
<p>
   The bathroom scene was purposeful. I was really trying to build the same feeling from episode 1 where Rio helps
        Agatha out of the spell, and I feel like I got close. The dialogue from the show didn't fit it, but I feel like
        I captured it with just the tension alone.
  </p>
<p>
   Or maybe I am just delusional? lol
  </p>
<p>
   Also hope the storm analogy of Agatha's control slipping wasn't too repetitive. Once I found it I just stuck with
        it, and felt like I had to build upon it throughout the chapter.
  </p>
<p>
   Lastly, I loved the last scene. Kicking my feet and giggling at baby lesbian Agatha discovering something new and
        exciting, and feeling like a kid on Christmas morning lol

```
Agatha sat at the dining room table, her eyes fixed on the steaming plate of breakfast in front of her. Perfectly scrambled eggs, bacon, and a slice of buttered toast. She inhaled, catching the comforting aroma, and her stomach rumbled despite herself.
   </p>
<p>
    But she didn’t pick up her fork right away.
   </p>
<p>
    Instead, she just stared at it.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t eat a real breakfast often. Her mornings typically consisted of an organic granola bar and an oversized mug of coffee—functional, quick, efficient. Nicky had cereal and toast.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t because she didn’t like breakfast. In truth, she loved it. Pancakes, omelets, French toast—breakfast was a feast of comfort. It was her favorite meal.
   </p>
<p>
    The only crutch?
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha Harkness didn’t cook. She was terrible at it. Always had been.
   </p>
<p>
    And what did Agatha Harkness do when was bad at something? She avoided it. Like the fucking plague.
   </p>
<p>
    Thank god for Sonya.
   </p>
<p>
    Sonya, who was a god damn godsend wrapped in one miracle of a person. Nanny. Cleaner. And, thank everything holy, a phenomenal cook. Without her, Nicky and Agatha would have been surviving on a steady diet of takeout, pizza rolls, and whatever sad excuse for a meal could be microwaved in under three minutes.
   </p>
<p>
    There was something about a home-cooked meal that made a house feel like a home. Agatha found comfort in knowing she could provide that for Nicky—not directly, of course, but by hiring someone who could. She was self-aware enough to recognize her limitations, and cooking was one of them.
   </p>
<p>
    The only problem? Sonya had weekends off and didn’t arrive until 8:00 a.m. on weekdays, which left Agatha in charge of breakfast. This meant surviving on granola bars and cereal
   </p>
<p>
    during the week and resorting to takeout on the weekends. A far cry from the warm, satisfying meals Sonya churned out effortlessly.
   </p>
<p>
    At one point, she had briefly considered hiring a private chef to handle every meal, breakfast included. It had been tempting—a fantasy, even—but in the end, it had felt like too much. Too indulgent, even for her. Plus, there was something humbling about cereal and pizza rolls, a dose of reality she didn’t want Nicky to grow up completely removed from.
   </p>
<p>
    And if Agatha were willing to admit it, she didn’t want to give up pizza roll nights. Those nights, sitting on the couch with Nicky, laughing over the TV while munching on tiny, lava- hot bites, were sacred in their own way. Nicky loved them, and honestly, so did she.
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze lingered on the plate in front of her, as a faint shadow of a memory flitted across her mind.
   </p>
<p>
    Evanora had been a terrible cook too.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha could still recall the dry, tasteless slabs of meat Evanora would slap onto a plate, accompanied by canned vegetables. But even those meals were rare. Most of her childhood had been spent living off bologna sandwiches—cheap, cold, but dependable. There was always a pack of bologna in the fridge, next to the expired milk and whatever else Evanora had forgotten to throw out.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s grip on her fork loosened as her gaze shifted to the steaming cup of coffee that had just been placed beside her plate. She glanced up, catching the subtle movement of Rio sliding the cup toward her without so much as a glance, already sinking into the chair next to her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t say anything as she settled in, her own plate in front of her.
   </p>
<p>
    The one she’d cooked—for herself and Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    In Agatha’s kitchen. After waking up in Agatha’s bed, in Agatha’s arms. After showering in Agatha’s bathroom.
   </p>
<p>
    Now here she was, sitting at Agatha’s kitchen table, holding Agatha’s fork, drinking Agatha’s coffee, from one of Agatha’s favorite mugs.
   </p>
<p>
    It was so... domestic.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Agatha hated it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha reached for the cup and took a sip.
   </p>
<p>
    She hated this quiet invasion of her life, this disruption of her carefully constructed routine. She hated how easily Rio had slipped into her world, rearranging pieces of it without even trying.
   </p>
<p>
    But most of all, she hated how it also felt strangely—comforting.
   </p>
<p>
    Good, even.
   </p>
<p>
    Her grip on the coffee cup tightened slightly as the thought sank in, uninvited and unwelcome. Agatha wasn’t supposed to like this. She wasn’t supposed to want someone else so deeply entrenched in her life, her space.
   </p>
<p>
    And yet...
   </p>
<p>
    The soft clink of Rio’s fork against her plate pulled Agatha from her thoughts.
   </p>
<p>
    She glanced over, watching as Rio took a bite of her food, completely at ease, like they’d been doing this for years.
   </p>
<p>
    The anxiousness coiled tighter in Agatha’s chest as she followed suit, and took the first bite of her eggs—and
    <em>
     fuck
    </em>
    —they were perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned.
   </p>
<p>
    And she fought against the urge to groan. As if she needed another reason to love this woman?
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     That
    </em>
    thought slammed into her, hard and unrelenting, and the ferocity of it made her drop her fork with a loud
    <em>
     clang
    </em>
    on the table.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio glanced up at the sound, one brow arching in question.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know it didn’t taste that bad,” she teased.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shot her a look, sharp but tinged with exasperation, before sighing heavily and running a hand through her hair. She fought to get a grip on the emotions swirling inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Doesn’t this feel weird to you?” she finally asked, gesturing vaguely around them.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t answer immediately, instead leaning back in her chair with a casualness that only irritated Agatha more. She sipped her coffee, her expression unreadable until she finally smirked.
   </p>
<p>
    “When life gives you lemons...” Rio trailed off, her tone light, teasing.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s glare was immediate, sharp enough to cut glass, and thankfully straight through Rio stupid statement.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio sighed wearily at that, her smirk fading as she slouched slightly in her chair. The playful mask slipped, replaced by something quieter, more honest.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” Rio said simply, meeting Agatha’s eyes. “It’s weird.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha flicked her hand up in a sharp exclamation.
   </p>
<p>
    “Thank you,” she muttered, needing the affirmation like air.
   </p>
<p>
    She sighed heavily, her gaze dropping back to her plate before picking up a piece of bacon and biting into it. She chewed it with deliberate force, as though trying to grind the entire absurdity of their situation into dust under her teeth.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     “You know,”
    </em>
    Rio began, her voice dripping with teasing intent, the kind that sent an instant ripple of irritation—and anticipation—through Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze mid-chew, her eyes narrowing, already bracing herself for whatever nonsense was about to come out of the woman’s mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio smirked, enjoying the moment far too much, and continued.
   </p>
<p>
    “This whole situation,” she said, pausing to take a languid sip of her coffee, her free hand gesturing lazily between them, “is like the
    <em>
     epitome
    </em>
    of stereotypical lesbian behavior.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t know what she was expecting to come out of Rio’s mouth, but it wasn’t that. She tilted her head in confusion at that, continuing chewing before finally swallowing.
   </p>
<p>
    “What are you talking about?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio leaned forward, taking her time to spear a piece of egg with her fork. She popped it into her mouth, humming softly before finally meeting Agatha’s gaze with a teasing glint in her eye.
   </p>
<p>
    “U-hauling,” she said simply.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, her brow furrowing.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     What the fuck was Rio talking about?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Like... the moving truck?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s jaw dropped dramatically, as she gave Agatha an incredulous look, shaking her head in disbelief.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’ve really never heard the joke?” Rio asked, her tone brimming with amazement, her disbelief as playful as it was genuine.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s brow furrowed as she racked her brain, searching for any context to latch onto, but came up with nothing. The frustration of not knowing—of being on the outside of an inside joke—pricked at her pride. She glared at Rio, her jaw tightening, and her tone sharpened as she spoke.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m sorry,” Agatha deadpanned, the words somehow both a hiss and a mock. “I’m not well- versed in the ‘
    <em>
     vagina monologue
    </em>
    ,’ Rio. Please, enlighten me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s grin widened, a devilish light sparking in her eyes. She leaned back in her chair, clearly enjoying every moment of Agatha’s irritation.
   </p>
<p>
    “I forget sometimes that you're a baby lesbian,” Rio said, her voice dripping with exaggerated sympathy, her grin widening as she clearly savored every second of this.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s left eye twitched, a telltale sign that her patience was already wearing dangerously thin.
   </p>
<p>
    “Alright, listen,” Rio began in a tone so placating it could’ve been meant for a toddler. She even held up her hands, before bringing them together like she was telling a story with them. “When two mommies fall in love...”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha growled, her fingers tightening around her fork as she leaned forward, her voice low and full of menace.
   </p>
<p>
    “You know I have enough connections in the upper echelons of New York society to kill you with my bare fucking hands and still get away with it, right?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t even flinch. If anything, her smirk deepened, her mouth twitching with barely contained laughter as she took a slow sip of her coffee, letting the moment stretch just enough to test Agatha’s patience.
   </p>
<p>
    But then, just as quickly, the teasing faded. The smirk softened into something quieter, more reflective, as she set her cup down and looked at Agatha with a serious, almost resigned expression.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay,” she murmured with a heavy sigh, pausing to collect her thoughts before continuing. “There’s this running joke about lesbians—how we move fast. Women bond faster. We just... get each other, you know? No hurdles, no walls, none of that emotional baggage that men seem to drag out for years.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, as if considering what to say next.
   </p>
<p>
    “Even for the truly emotionally stunted women—”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s glare sharpened. She could feel the barb coming. Agatha’s mouth opened to retort, but Rio cut her off with a look that was more knowing than teasing.
   </p>
<p>
    “—
    <em>
     like us
    </em>
    ,” Rio finished simply, the weight of the words settling between them, as she claimed she had just as many problems as Agatha, before moving on. “Even then, it’s like running the 100-meter hurdles—with no hurdles. Straight to the finish line in record time while everyone else is jumping and stumbling behind us.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, processing Rio’s words, her mind working overtime to unravel the logic—or lack thereof—behind them. She sat back slightly, her fork clinking against the table as she waved her hand in mild disbelief, as if to wave away the nonsense.
   </p>
<p>
    “That cannot be true,” Agatha stated, her tone flat and edged with skepticism, as though sheer disbelief might somehow undo the absurdity Rio had just said.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio chuckled, leaning back in her chair with the kind of ease that set Agatha’s teeth on edge. Her eyes sparkled, full of amusement.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, but it is,” Rio replied, her voice light but unyielding. It was the kind of tone someone uses to drop bigger news. “One of my friends from Texas used to say lesbians date like dogs age—one year for a straight couple equals seven for us.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, as her mind stumbled over the analogy. Before she could form a retort, Rio raised a finger to chin, her expression turning mock-serious.
   </p>
<p>
    “Let’s do the math,” Rio said, pausing as though deep in thought. “We’ve been at this for a little over a month now, give or take.” She feigned looking up at the ceiling, mumbling theatrically, “Carry the one, divide by seven...”
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze snapped back to Agatha, and the smirk that spread across her face was absolutely menacing, practically dripping with satisfaction.
   </p>
<p>
    “Congratulations, my love” Rio declared, her tone teasing but triumphant. “We just celebrated our one-year anniversary.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s jaw dropped, and for a moment, all she could do was gape at Rio, torn between indignation and outright disbelief.
   </p>
<p>
    “That—” she began, only to falter, eyes narrowing. “You’re just fucking with me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio met her gaze with a deadpan look, chewing her bacon like she was unbothered by the accusation.
   </p>
<p>
    “Unfortunately, no,” she said, using her strip of bacon like a professor gesturing with a pointer during a lecture. “It’s absolutely a thing. I mean, I’ve done my best to avoid the stereotype my entire life, but I’ve seen it happen with my friends. Stereotypes exist for a reason—they’re rooted in some kind of truth.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, giving Agatha a pointed look that was both teasing and resigned.
   </p>
<p>
    “And now, look at me,” Rio added, gesturing vaguely around them as if to highlight the absurdity of their situation. “You’ve ruined me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha scoffed, straightening in her seat and gesturing between them.
   </p>
<p>
    “We are not like that.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced, as her smirk widened.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, we’re not?”
   </p>
<p>
    “No,” Agatha snapped, gripping her fork tightly and brandishing it like a weapon. “We’re not. For one, you’re not moving in. You’re here for safety reasons.
    <em>
     Safety
    </em>
    , Rio.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, frowning slightly as she tried to make her voice steadier, more commanding.
   </p>
<p>
    “And two, I barely even like you.”
   </p>
<p>
    The second the words left her mouth, Agatha winced inwardly.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Damn it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Not as confident as she’d intended. The hesitation in her tone was a dead giveaway, and of course, Rio noticed it immediately.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s head tilted, a slow grin spreading across her face like she’d just been handed the best gift imaginable. Then she laughed—a loud, full-bodied sound that filled the room. She threw her head back, her dark hair catching the soft morning light in a way that made Agatha’s chest tighten despite herself.
   </p>
<p>
    When Rio looked back at her, her eyes were warm, playful, and entirely too knowing.
   </p>
<p>
    “Barely like me, huh?” she said, her smirk widening. “You’re so full of shit. You love me, Agatha Harkness. You can’t say it without choking, but you do.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha glared at her, though her heart betrayed her by doing an annoying little flip at the sound of Rio’s confidence.
   </p>
<p>
    “Did those
    <em>
     exact words
    </em>
    ever leave my mouth,
    <em>
     counselor
    </em>
    ?” she retorted, lifting her chin stubbornly, her grip on the fork tightening just slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    It was a strong argument, legally speaking. She hadn’t said those exact words—not directly, anyway. Sure, she would conceded that had told Rio she loved her, but not in a way that carried the full weight of saying it plainly. That admission still caused a twist of discomfort in her stomach, a vulnerability she wasn’t ready to lay bare.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio raised an eyebrow, giving Agatha a long, assessing look, the kind that said she was deciding just how much she wanted to push. Her smirk didn’t waver, though. If anything, it deepened, her amusement written all over her face.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha wasn’t having it. She lifted her chin a fraction higher and shot Rio a pointed look of her own, her fork still in hand like a weapon of pure stubbornness.
   </p>
<p>
    “If it can’t hold up in court,” Agatha said, her tone clipped, her emphasis sharp as a blade, “it won’t hold up in my house.”
   </p>
<p>
    She added extra weight to the last two words, the “
    <em>
     my
    </em>
    ” landing like a gavel striking a judge’s bench.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio blinked, clearly taken aback for a split second before recovering, her lips twitching into a full grin.
   </p>
<p>
    “Noted,” she murmured, leaning back in her chair, the picture of mock compliance. But her eyes betrayed her—dark and full of that damnable confidence that made Agatha want to simultaneously strangle and kiss her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Good,” Agatha said, stabbing her fork into her eggs with a precise jab, as if to solidify her point. Her tone was firm, her authority seemingly reasserted—or at least, she hoped.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     One year anniversary.
    </em>
<em>
     How ridiculous.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The rhythmic clacking of keys filled the living room by mid-day, blending seamlessly with the soothing narration of a documentary about mushrooms playing in the background. Agatha absently noted the pattern of Rio’s taste in TV—it was always nature-focused, calming, almost meditative.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t mind it.
   </p>
<p>
    At least it wasn’t some ridiculous reality show.
   </p>
<p>
    Sitting on opposite ends of the couch, Agatha glanced up from her laptop to the other side where Rio was seated, legs tucked underneath her, her fingers flying across the keyboard. Her posture was relaxed, but her focus was razor-sharp, her eyes scanning the screen like she was devouring every line of text. Whatever she was working on had her utterly engrossed.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned back slightly, narrowing her eyes as curiosity began to take hold. To the best of her knowledge, she hadn’t assigned Rio anything pressing—at least not anything that demanded the level of focus she was currently witnessing.
   </p>
<p>
    And she hadn’t been fully transitioned to Jen or Alice yet.
   </p>
<p>
    That shift wouldn’t happen until tomorrow.
   </p>
<p>
    So, the question lingered, gnawing at her:
    <em>
     What was Rio Vidal working on with such intensity?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It had been eating at Agatha for hours, and finally, the question escaped her lips before she even realized she was speaking.
   </p>
<p>
    “What are you working on?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio blinked, startled, as if she’d forgotten Agatha was in the room. Her eyes met Agatha’s, a flicker of surprise quickly masked.
   </p>
<p>
    “Nothing,” Rio said, a little too quickly, her tone nonchalant but unconvincing.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s brows lifted, her expression unimpressed.
   </p>
<p>
    “That’s a bold lie,” she retorted, snapping her laptop shut and setting it aside. She crossed her legs, folding her hands in her lap as she gave Rio her full attention. “You’ve been glued to that thing for hours. So, what is it?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio hesitated, her fingers hovering over the keyboard as if weighing her options. Finally, she let out a sigh and turned the laptop toward Agatha, the screen now angled for her to see.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha frowned, leaning forward as her eyes scanned the display. It took her a moment to piece together what she was looking at: graphs, trend analyses, and an Excel spreadsheet filled with neatly marked money lines. Her gaze snapped up to Rio, her brows shooting upward in surprise.
   </p>
<p>
    “You play the stock market?” she asked, incredulous.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio smirked, leaning back into the couch and crossing her arms, clearly enjoying Agatha’s reaction.
   </p>
<p>
    “How else do you think I afford my place?” she replied, one brow arching in a teasing challenge. “Because let’s be honest—you pay your first-year associates barely enough to share rent with seven other people to rent a two-bedroom close enough to the office.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s jaw tightened, the accusation hitting harder than she cared to admit.
   </p>
<p>
    “Excuse me,” she retorted, her tone sharp and defensive. “We pay very competitive starting salaries.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio snorted, shaking her head with a mix of amusement and exasperation.
   </p>
<p>
    “Competitive compared to what? Barista wages?” She arched a brow, letting the words hang for a beat before continuing. “I mean, let’s be real. You probably don’t see it, because,” she paused to gesture around her, “and most of my peers come from money. Don’t think I haven’t noticed the last names of my fellow associates.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown off balance. She wasn’t used to hearing her firm—and by extension, herself—called out so directly.
   </p>
<p>
    “What’s that supposed to mean?” she asked, her voice clipped, though a hint of curiosity crept in despite herself.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio leaned forward, her elbows resting on her knees, and gestured casually with her hand.
   </p>
<p>
    “It means that for most of your associates, this job is a stepping stone or a resume builder, not a lifeline. They have trust funds, inheritances, or mommy and daddy footing the bill for their midtown apartments. But for people like me, though? This job
    <em>
     is
    </em>
    the lifeline. And trust me, it’s not enough on its own.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha opened her mouth to respond, then closed it, unable to form a rebuttal. She didn’t know what hit harder—Rio’s bluntness or the possible truth behind her words.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha tucked that little nugget of information away, a mental note to dig into later. She knew inflation was up—rent was sky-high—but she hadn’t felt it the same way others might. Wealth shielded her from such realities. If her firm wasn’t paying their people a living wage, that was a serious problem. One that needed to be addressed.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s gaze dropped back to Rio’s laptop, her eye immediately picking out the patterns. She’d represented enough investments firms and had a diverse enough investment portfolio
   </p>
<p>
    to be comfortable reading market data. And based on what she saw on Rio’s screen—this wasn’t the work of an amateur.
   </p>
<p>
    A series of scheduled trades were lined up for the next morning, each neatly organized and clearly optimized, given that the market was closed today. The precision of it all struck her— lines of numbers, detailed charts, and calculated orders that hinted at someone who wasn’t just playing the market but mastering it.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re not just dabbling in this,” Agatha remarked, her voice laced with a mixture of surprise and genuine admiration. “You’re good.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s fingers paused over the keyboard, and she looked up at Agatha with a sly smirk tugging at the corners of her mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, come now, Agatha,” she said, her tone dripping with playful confidence. “You should know me well enough by now—I don’t just survive.
    <em>
     I thrive
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    The audacity of the statement hung in the air, and yet Agatha couldn’t deny the truth of it. It was quintessentially Rio—unapologetically bold and utterly capable.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, momentarily caught off guard. She tilted her head, studying Rio with a newfound curiosity.
   </p>
<p>
    “How do you even know how to do all this?” she asked, gesturing toward the laptop.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio turned the screen back toward herself, leaning into the couch with an almost casual grace. She gave Agatha a look over the top of the laptop, a faint smirk pulling at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “I double-majored in economics and statistics,” she said with a shrug, like it was no big deal. “Started dabbling in the stock market when I turned eighteen. Took my measly paychecks from a farmers’ market job and threw them into investments. I got good at it—fast. So, I decided to major in it during college. Almost went for my master’s in finance, but...” she trailed off, giving Agatha a pointed look. “Law school won out.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, the puzzle pieces of Rio slowly falling into place in a way that both impressed and mildly annoyed her.
   </p>
<p>
    “I can actually see that,” she said, shifting her position to lean her elbow against the couch, her head propped on her hand as she stared at Rio with a teasing smirk. “You certainly have the cockiness for Wall Street.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio worked her tongue against her cheek, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth as she met Agatha’s gaze with a smirk of her own.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’ll take that as a compliment,” Rio quipped, her tone light and amused.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes but unable to suppress her own grin.
   </p>
<p>
    “Of course you would,” she muttered, her voice dripping with mock exasperation.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes lingered on Rio for a moment, quietly taking her in. She was beginning to pick up these little pieces of Rio—these fragments of a life so deliberately lived, filled with ambition, resilience, and unapologetic confidence. It was...disarming. Fascinating, even. And somehow, it left Agatha feeling like she was just beginning to scratch the surface.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned in slightly, unable to resist her curiosity.
   </p>
<p>
    “What made you choose law school?” she asked, her tone softer than before.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk faded, shifting into something more bittersweet, her expression tinged with nostalgia.
   </p>
<p>
    “It was something my dad used to say to me growing up,” she began, her voice carrying a warmth that hadn’t been there before. “As you can imagine, raising a kid who remembers everything is...
    <em>
     a real treat
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    A wry smile ghosted across her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “Even as a kid, I’d call them out on the little fibs or stories parents tell to keep their kids in line. And every time I did, my dad would let out this loud, dramatic sigh and say, ‘
    <em>
     You should be a lawyer someday, mija. Nothing gets past you
    </em>
    .’”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, the memory seeming to hang between them, both tender and amusing. It softened Rio in a way that made Agatha’s chest tighten.
   </p>
<p>
    “I guess,” Rio continued, her voice heavier now, tinged with a depth that hadn’t been there before. “I applied to law school for him, and then...I fell in love with it. It just felt right after that—like he was guiding me still.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words settled into the air between them, soft yet weighted, carrying an emotional gravity that Agatha couldn’t ignore. For a moment, silence hung between them, and Agatha let it, sensing that anything she said might cheapen the sentiment.
   </p>
<p>
    Another puzzle piece fell into place in Agatha’s growing picture of who Rio Vidal was. And this one fit squarely into the bittersweet corner of her life. It was a small but significant piece of the whole—a glimpse into the things that shaped her.
   </p>
<p>
    “What about you?” Rio asked, her voice lighter, cutting through the air pulling Agatha from her thoughts. “Why did you go to law school?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, the question catching her off guard. But she welcomed the simplicity of her own story. It wasn’t heavy. It wasn’t tangled in emotion. It just... was.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, that’s easy,” she said, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. “I did it for the money.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio snorted, her incredulous expression practically dripping with disbelief.
   </p>
<p>
    “Seriously?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shrugged, leaning back into the couch like she didn’t feel the weight of Rio’s judgment.
   </p>
<p>
    “I grew up in a trailer park,” she began, the admission catching her off guard for a second, before recovering. “We were always scraping by, barely making it. When you grow up trying to rub two pennies together just to survive, you think about security—and money meant security.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her tone shifted slightly, darker, as she continued.
   </p>
<p>
    “My mom was a self-proclaimed medicine woman. Half home remedies, half religious healing, full delusion.”
   </p>
<p>
    She rolled her eyes, though the bitterness in her voice betrayed her effort to play it off.
   </p>
<p>
    “She destroyed any inclination for me to want to go into medicine. Law seemed... safer.
    <em>
     Lucrative
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha met Rio’s gaze evenly, daring her to challenge the practicality of her choice. But Rio didn’t. Instead, a flicker of understanding softened her smirk, the humor in her eyes tempered by something gentler.
   </p>
<p>
    “Wow,” Rio finally said, her tone caught between teasing and genuine admiration. She paused, lips twitching like she was debating whether to say something witty.
   </p>
<p>
    “Inspiring,” she added dryly.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t help but smirk in return, the urge to lighten the mood outweighing any need to dwell on the past. After all, she had earned every ounce of humor that had come out of her messed-up childhood—might as well use it.
   </p>
<p>
    “Think I could host a TED Talk on it?” Agatha deadpanned, raising an eyebrow. “
    <em>
     Don’t follow your dreams, kids—follow the money.
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk widened, amusement dancing in her dark eyes as she leaned back into the couch, utterly at ease.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’d watch it,” she said lightly. “Might even take notes.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha scoffed, rolling her eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    “You don’t have to take notes. You remember everything.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk at that.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t lost on Agatha that they’d just shared pieces of themselves that most people kept locked away. It wasn’t until the quiet settled back in that she fully realized what had happened—that she’d told Rio about her childhood, about growing up with nothing, about a mother who barely deserved the title. She hadn’t even told James any of that until they were engaged, and only because he’d asked if her family would be coming to the wedding.
   </p>
<p>
    Her chest tightened.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Fuck.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Maybe Rio had a point about the lack of hurdles between two women. How else could she explain sharing one of the deepest, most guarded parts of herself without even realizing she’d done it?
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t like her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha Harkness didn’t open doors that had been bolted shut for decades—not for anyone.
   </p>
<p>
    And yet, here she was...letting Rio in.
   </p>
<p>
    Her chest tightened, curling in on itself, the vulnerability clawing at her edges. She needed to break the moment before it swallowed her whole. With a sharp breath, she pushed herself upright, grabbing her laptop and flipping it open, her fingers finding the keys almost immediately.
   </p>
<p>
    The familiar screen lit up, and she dove back into work, letting the rhythm of typing steady her spiraling thoughts.
   </p>
<p>
    She could feel Rio’s gaze on her, lingering like a soft weight.
   </p>
<p>
    But Rio—being Rio—didn’t call her out.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha heard the faint shuffle of movement from the other end of the couch, and moments later, the steady clicking of keys resumed, signaling that Rio had moved on too.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha looked down at her computer, trying to read this report, but eyes began to ache, a dull strain creeping in as she squinted at the small text on her laptop screen. The brightness of the display didn’t help, and she let out an annoyed grumble, rubbing at her temples.
   </p>
<p>
    “Ugh,” she muttered under her breath, the faint acknowledgment of her own mortality tugging at her pride. She hated this—hated the reminder that age was creeping up on her, slow but unrelenting.
   </p>
<p>
    Grumbling again, she leaned over to her bag, fishing through its contents with a slight scowl until her fingers brushed against the familiar frame of her glasses. She didn’t need them often, but when she did, the relief was undeniable.
   </p>
<p>
    Pulling them out, she inspected them briefly. At least the wide black flames were fashionable.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Small victories.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She slipped the glasses on, the world sharpening into crisp clarity almost instantly. Agatha sighed softly, the tension in her eyes easing as she focused back on the report in front of her.
   </p>
<p>
    She managed to get through the first couple of paragraphs when a shift in the atmosphere caught her attention. The documentary had stopped running, the quiet that replaced it amplifying every other sound—or lack thereof. The absence of noise from Rio’s direction was what truly pricked at Agatha’s senses.
   </p>
<p>
    Not a single keystroke. Not a rustle of movement.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes flicked up over the rim of her laptop, and instantly, she was met with blazing dark eyes. Eyes she knew all too well.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath hitched.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     That look.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It was the kind of look that usually ended with her pressed against some surface, legs trembling, chest heaving, and body utterly wrecked.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, her mind scrambling to keep up with whatever was happening.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re wearing glasses,” Rio said, her voice low and gravelly, the sound sending a shiver down Agatha’s spine.
   </p>
<p>
    It took her a beat too long to connect the dots. Seriously? The glasses did it? Of all things.
   </p>
<p>
    “Really?” Agatha asked, her tone flat as she pointedly removed the glasses from her face, dangling them between two fingers. “This is what does it for you?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio tilted her head, her smirk slow and deliberate, her eyes raking over Agatha like she was something to be devoured.
   </p>
<p>
    “I didn’t think you could get any hotter,” Rio murmured, her voice low and raspy. “And yet, here we are.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt a flush creep up her neck, unbidden and entirely unwelcome.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re ridiculous,” she muttered, slipping the glasses back on and glaring at Rio over the frames.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed sharply through her nose and tried to focus, her eyes dropping back to the screen. She read the same sentence twice, then a third time, the words blurring together as her mind failed to process a single one of them.
   </p>
<p>
    Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, unmoving.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     “Agatha.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her name, spoken low and deliberate, rolled off Rio’s tongue like a challenge.
   </p>
<p>
    Jesus.
   </p>
<p>
    The way Rio said her name.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t just her voice—it was the way she dragged it out, low and rough, like it wasn’t just a name but a promise. Agatha felt it in her chest, curling low in her stomach and spreading outward.
   </p>
<p>
    “What?” Agatha finally bit out, not looking up.
   </p>
<p>
    “Look at me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha hesitated, her pulse drumming in her ears. She didn’t want to look. Knew exactly what she’d find if she did.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio,” she warned, her voice low and edged with exasperation.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She had work to do.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Rio repeated, softer this time, but with the same damn tone—the one that felt like a hand reaching inside her chest and wrapping around her heart.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed, her resolve cracking as she finally lifted her gaze over her laptop screen.
   </p>
<p>
    Big mistake.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk was wicked, her eyes dark and simmering, and the way she was looking at her— like Agatha was the most beautiful thing in the world—made her feel both utterly exposed and completely turned on.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio let the moment stretch, the weight of her gaze pressing down on Agatha until the air felt charged between them. Then, with a slow, deliberate tilt of her head, Rio’s lips curved into a smirk, her dark eyes gleaming with intent.
   </p>
<p>
    “Go to the bedroom and wait for me.”
   </p>
<p>
    The command was calm, but it struck with the force of a thunderclap. Agatha sucked in a breath, her chest tightening, her pulse quickening.
   </p>
<p>
    The audacity—the absolute nerve of this woman.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, she just stared at Rio, her pride warring with the heat pooling low in her stomach. She hated how easily Rio could do this, how effortlessly she could unravel her composure with just a few words.
   </p>
<p>
    But the look in Rio’s eyes—that searing confidence, that magnetic pull—it stripped Agatha of any desire to push back.
   </p>
<p>
    She let out a slow breath, feeling the energy crackling in the air between them, building inside her. The tension was palpable, pressing down on her, driving her every move.
   </p>
<p>
    And with that, Agatha closed her laptop with decisive click, setting it aside on the table. Her fingers brushed the edges of her glasses, ready to slip them off, when Rio’s voice cut through the heavy silence.
   </p>
<p>
    “No.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her eyes snapping to Rio’s.
   </p>
<p>
    “Keep those on,” Rio said, her tone low and firm that it sent a shiver coursing down Agatha’s spine.
   </p>
<p>
    Heat bloomed in Agatha’s chest, spreading outward, a warmth she didn’t even try to tamp down. She couldn’t fight the small smile that tugged at her lips as she moved to her feet.
   </p>
<p>
    Without another word, she turned, her steps deliberate and unhurried as she made her way toward the bedroom. There was a sway in her stride, one she didn’t bother to hide, her smirk growing with every step.
   </p>
<p>
    She paused at the doorway, just long enough to glance over her shoulder, catching Rio’s gaze still locked on her, dark and hungry. Agatha felt the heat rise further, but instead of feeling overwhelmed, it felt like power.
   </p>
<p>
    Who knew getting old could be this fun?
    <br/>

   Chapter End Notes
  </p>
<p>
   Okay, wasn't that cute? Not a lot of plot here, just fluff. So I added some chapters at the countdown because I
        have things that need to happen between now and the end, and this chapter didn't move the plot like I needed.
        But I also felt like it was needed, a little fluff between these two idiots.
  </p>
<p>
   The whole u-hauling discussion had be rolling. Agatha being a baby lesbian is like my favorite thing ever. Her
        tipping a drag queen $100 bills, the fact that she didn't know what Rio carrying a backpack meant, the whole "it
        felt like a gift to me" thing last chapter, and now this U-Haul analogy...it's been so much fun to write.
  </p>
<p>
   The "Congratulations, my love," from AAA also made me smile. Love tying anything in from the show.
  </p>
<p>
   Also this my be favorite line in the whole story now: "“You’re so full of shit. You love me, Agatha Harkness. You
        can’t say it without choking, but you do.”
  </p>
<p>
   Also, I saw a meme of Agatha that said, "Do you know how much trauma you have to go through to get this funny?
        and I had to work it into this story because it is so real. So the whole scene was purposeful: Agatha couldn’t
        help but smirk in return, the urge to lighten the mood outweighing any need to dwell on the past. After all, she
        had earned
  </p>
<p>
   every ounce of humor that had come out of her messed-up childhood—might as well use it.
  </p>
<p>
   Also, notice the Aubrey Plaza tongue in cheek scene? I noticed she does that a lot and had to work it in.
  </p>
<p>
   Lastly, Kathryn Hahn in her glasses...is like
   <em>
    chefs kiss
   </em>
   so...lol

```
Agatha's heels clicked sharply against the floors, the sound echoing as she crossed the invisible boundary separating the civilians from the gladiators. Her stride was steady, deliberate, every step a declaration of war as she moved toward her designated chair.
   </p>
<p>
    Settling into her seat, she reached into her bag, pulling out a stack of files and a pen. She placed them on the table in front of her, her fingers instinctively twirling the pen in a practiced, fluid motions—a quiet outlet for the restless energy humming just beneath her skin.
   </p>
<p>
    She wasn’t nervous.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha Harkness didn’t do nervous—not when it came to court.
   </p>
<p>
    This wasn’t fear.
   </p>
<p>
    It was something sharper, more visceral.
   </p>
<p>
    The electric buzz that always thrummed through her veins before stepping onto the legal battlefield was alive and crackling. But now, it was something more. It wasn’t just about winning, about outmaneuvering the enemy.
   </p>
<p>
    No—this time, she wanted blood.
   </p>
<p>
    She wanted to rip their fucking throats out.
   </p>
<p>
    Her head snapped to the left at the sound of movement, her eyes locking onto Fox and Ratcliff as they sauntered over to the opposing counsel’s table.
   </p>
<p>
    Of course, Fox couldn’t resist. She turned toward Agatha with that insufferable, self-satisfied smirk, her eyes flicking over Agatha’s shoulder before landing back on her with a look of completely fake concern.
   </p>
<p>
    “Where’s your co-counsel, Agatha?” Fox purred, her tone dripping with mock sympathy. The facade lasted all of a second before her smirk turned devilish, her voice lowering just enough to twist the knife. “I hope she’s okay.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words hit like a thunderclap, the ringing in Agatha’s ears almost drowning out the rest of the room.
   </p>
<p>
    Fox
    <em>
     knew
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    She
    <em>
     fucking knew
    </em>
    about the threat against Rio, and now she was openly mocking her for it, throwing it in her face with calculated cruelty.
   </p>
<p>
    Something inside Agatha snapped. She shoved back her chair, already halfway to her feet, the fury in her chest roaring to life, but before she could take a step, a firm hand pressed down on her shoulder, pushing her back into her chair.
   </p>
<p>
    She looked up, ready to lash out, only to see Lilia standing behind her, calm and steady. Her sharp, knowing eyes met Agatha’s, not in warning, but rather in understanding.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, without a word, Lilia turned her head toward Fox.
   </p>
<p>
    Fox, to her credit, didn’t deflate entirely under Lilia’s piercing gaze, but the shift was there, subtle yet telling. The self-satisfied smirk wavered for just a moment, her mask slipping ever so slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia’s presence had rattled her, a hairline fracture in her carefully constructed confidence. And even the smallest crack could eventually cause a leak—and Lilia and Agatha knew it.
   </p>
<p>
    “Lilia,” Fox said, surprise flickering in her tone before she quickly masked it under her usual cocky bravado. “I didn’t know they let you out of the office anymore. I thought you were more of a figurehead these days.”
   </p>
<p>
    The faintest smile curved Lilia’s lips, but it was far from friendly. It was the kind of smile that promised pain.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia’s faint smile didn’t waver as she stepped forward, her movements precise, deliberate. She stopped just short of Fox’s table, her gaze steady and sharp, cutting through the tension like a blade.
   </p>
<p>
    “Madeline,” Lilia said, her voice smooth and calm, but carrying the unmistakable weight of the authority that Lilia’s 30 plus years in law has earned her. “It’s always a pleasure to see you. Your theatrics never fail to entertain.”
   </p>
<p>
    She tilted her head slightly, her smile remaining, but her eyes cold and unyielding.
   </p>
<p>
    “Though I must say, threats of violence against a colleague feels a bit... desperate. Even for you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Fox’s smirk tightened, her posture stiffening as she tried to maintain her composure under Lilia’s scrutiny.
   </p>
<p>
    “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she replied with a casual shrug, though the edge in her voice betrayed her.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia leaned forward slightly, resting her fingertips on the edge of their table.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, I think you do,” she said, her tone dropping, quiet but lethal. “Mocking the personal safety of opposing co-counsel—particularly in light of certain recent threats—isn’t just tasteless. It’s dangerous, and unbecoming of someone who’s supposed to uphold the integrity of the court.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart thudded as she watched Lilia systematically dismantle Fox’s smug facade. She’d seen Lilia work before, but there was something about the way she wielded her words now, that made even Agatha sit a little straighter.
   </p>
<p>
    Fox’s smile finally cracked, her jaw tightening as she struggled to maintain her composure.
   </p>
<p>
    “I was simply making conversation,” she said, her tone strained. “Surely you’re not implying —”
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m not implying anything,” Lilia cut her off, her voice sharp. “I’m stating facts. And if you continue down this path, rest assured I will make sure those facts are
    <em>
     formally addressed
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, the courtroom seemed to hold its breath, the tension between them crackling in the air.
   </p>
<p>
    Then Lilia straightened, her gaze sweeping over Fox with an air of effortless dismissal, like she was beneath her. Her voice, when she spoke, was smooth and cold as steel.
   </p>
<p>
    “I suggest you focus on your own side of the aisle, Madeline,” Lilia said, her tone as sharp as a blade, each word measured for maximum impact. She let the silence linger just long enough to let it sting before delivering the final blow. “Because from where I’m standing... desperation does not look good on you. You’re getting wrinkles, darling.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze lingered for a heartbeat longer, a calculated flicker of dismissal, before she turned on her heel and walked back to their table with the kind of calm, unhurried confidence that made every step feel like a statement.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia settled into the seat beside Agatha, the weight of her presence as tangible as the heavy silence now emanating from the other side of the aisle.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha exhaled a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding, turning to Lilia with a questioning glance, her voice low to avoid being overheard.
   </p>
<p>
    “Not that I didn’t enjoy every second of that,” Agatha murmured, “but what are you doing here?”
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia turned her head, a slow, satisfied smirk curling at the corners of her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, Agatha,” she said, her tone almost playful. “You didn’t really think we were going to let you face this alone, did you?”
   </p>
<p>
    Before Agatha could respond, Lilia reached forward, tapping her hand lightly in an almost conspiratorial gesture. Then she leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper, smooth and sharp.
   </p>
<p>
    “Let’s take these fuckers down, shall we? Like old times.”
   </p>
<p>
    A small smile tugged at the corners of Agatha’s mouth, despite herself. The chaotic energy that had been buzzing under her skin began to settle, calmed by Lilia’s steady presence. She hadn’t realized how much she needed her until this very moment, and though Agatha would never admit it aloud, she felt... surprisingly grateful.
   </p>
<p>
    Of course, she wasn’t about to show it. Old habits died hard, and honestly, Lilia always liked Agatha exactly as she was.
   </p>
<p>
    “Lilia—language,” Agatha said, feigning mock outrage as she theatrically placed a hand over her heart.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia smirked, her posture casual as she leaned back in her chair with effortless confidence.
   </p>
<p>
    "Please, Agatha. I've heard worse from you before dawn."
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha parted her lips to retort, but just then, the door to the judge’s chambers swung open.
   </p>
<p>
    "All rise," called the clerk, instantly snapping Agatha's focus forward as she rose from her seat. "The Honorable Judge Harrison Mack presiding."
   </p>
<p>
    Judge Mack entered and took his place at the bench, prompting everyone else to follow suit.
   </p>
<p>
    Judge Mack settled into his chair, adjusted his glasses, and surveyed the courtroom with a weary expression.
   </p>
<p>
    “We’re here to
    <em>
     voir dire
    </em>
    and get ourselves a jury. Are you counselors ready to proceed?”
   </p>
<p>
    Madeline rose smoothly.
   </p>
<p>
    "Yes, Your Honor."
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha followed.
   </p>
<p>
    "Yes, Your Honor,” she said but not without casting a pointed look at Fox, her expression sharp enough to cut.
   </p>
<p>
    Judge Mack’s gaze shifted between them, the corners of his mouth twitching downward into a resigned frown. He exhaled heavily, the sound carrying a mix of exasperation and preemptive fatigue, as if he could already see the storm brewing between them and feel the inevitable migraine taking root.
   </p>
<p>
    “Alright,” he muttered, drumming his fingers briefly on the bench. “Bring in the prospective jurors.”
   </p>
<p>
    Six hours later, they had a jury. Surprisingly, the process had gone faster than expected— thanks to Lilia. She had an uncanny knack for reading people, a masterful intuition that made her jury selections feel almost surgical. It was a skill so precise it needed to be studied by scientists.
   </p>
<p>
    As they descended the courthouse steps, Agatha half-listened to Lilia ramble about the latest fiscal report. Around them, people moved in a constant stream, the steps to the courthouse bustling like a human highway.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, out of the corner of her eye, Agatha saw something—or rather, someone—that made her freeze mid-step. A man stood at the far end of the courthouse steps, casually leaning against a pillar. At first, the distance made it hard to be sure, the crowd moving between them like a living blur that forced her eyes to refocus again and again. But then the man smirked, and Agatha felt her blood turn to ice.
   </p>
<p>
    James Hughes. Head of Security at Vanguard.
   </p>
<p>
    The man who had killed Brooke Sinclair.
   </p>
<p>
    Her heart slammed against her ribs, pounding so hard she thought it might echo in her ears.
   </p>
<p>
    Suddenly, another large group of people passed between them, a chaotic wave of bodies chattering and bustling down the courthouse steps. Agatha’s line of sight was momentarily blocked, her breath caught in her throat as her eyes darted, trying to track him through the shifting sea of strangers.
   </p>
<p>
    But when the crowd thinned and her view finally cleared, he was gone.
   </p>
<p>
    Her chest tightened, the thundering pulse in her ears drowning out the world around her. She scanned the steps, her gaze flicking from pillar to pillar, but James Hughes had vanished as if he had never been there.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha?” Lilia’s voice cut through the haze, sharp with concern. “Are you okay?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha forced herself to swallow, nodding stiffly as she fought to steady her breath.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yeah,” she said, her voice a little too quick, too brittle. “I’m fine.”
   </p>
<p>
    But she wasn’t fine.
   </p>
<p>
    Not even close.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha took a deep breath, as she worked to calm the erratic beat of her heart. The lingering image of James Hughes standing there still clung to her mind like smoke, but she shoved it aside, forcing herself to focus on the present. She turned to Lilia, her voice steady, if a bit subdued.
   </p>
<p>
    "You want a ride back to the office?"
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia glanced at her, really looked, her sharp eyes scanning Agatha’s face as if she could sense something was off. For a moment, it seemed like she might ask, but instead, she let it go, offering a casual shrug.
   </p>
<p>
    "No, I’ve got a meeting uptown."
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded, taking a step to leave, but then hesitated. Surprising herself—and probably Lilia just as much—she turned back.
   </p>
<p>
    "Thank you for today."
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia blinked, caught off guard, but then her expression softened into a smile. Not the condescending, placating one Agatha used to loathe, but something genuine, something real.
   </p>
<p>
    "Of course," Lilia said, her tone warm. She started to turn away but suddenly stopped, her eyes widening like she’d remembered something important.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh!” She reached into her bag and pulled out a blue folder, handing it to Agatha with a small flourish. “I took the liberty of getting that for you. I really must be going, though. Have a good rest of your day, Agatha.”
   </p>
<p>
    Before Agatha could respond, Lilia was already walking off, heels clicking against the pavement as she disappeared into the crowd.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha glanced down at the folder, curiosity mingling with suspicion. She opened it, her eyes narrowing immediately as bold black letters practically leapt off the top of the single document inside.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
     RELATIONSHIP DISCLOSURE FORM
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha's lips thinned into a tight line as her eyes darted across the words.
   </p>
<p>
    With a sharp exhale, she snapped the folder shut and strode toward her car, muttering under her breath, a new frustration simmering just beneath the surface.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha pushed open the office doors and strode inside, her heels clicking against the polished floors. She rarely ventured to this side of the building, the far end where the associates' offices were tucked away.
   </p>
<p>
    Associates came to her, not the other way around.
   </p>
<p>
    But today was different.
   </p>
<p>
    At the very end of the corridor, near the bathroom, sat the smallest office in the building—a space the firm reserved for the most promising first-year associate. Agatha had seen plenty of associates occupy it over the years, most of whom she’d ignored entirely. But this morning, Jen had sent out an email announcing the new occupant.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio Vidal.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha had read the email over her coffee, her face impassive as her gaze flicked to Rio across her kitchen. She was making breakfast—again. French toast this time, as if they weren’t already walking a line that made Agatha’s stomach twist in ways she wasn’t ready to confront.
   </p>
<p>
    She hadn’t said anything to Rio. She didn’t want to ruin the surprise.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio deserved the office. After everything she’d done for the Vanguard case, she’d shattered every expectation of a first-year associate’s workload. And of course—there was another, more practical reason. The bullpen, where most associates worked, was too chaotic. Too hard to monitor.
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard had managed to plant bugs and even a camera in the firm before. The idea that they could get to Rio out in the open was possible.
   </p>
<p>
    The black vehicles trailing Agatha’s town car at a respectable distance, paired with the severe female agent stationed just outside Rio’s door, were unmistakable indicators of the gravity of the threat—the danger Rio was in. The weight of it all sat heavily on Agatha’s shoulders, her mind flashing back to James Hughes outside the courthouse today.
   </p>
<p>
    She’d need to report his presence to the security team immediately.
   </p>
<p>
    Just in case.
   </p>
<p>
    It was likely nothing more than a calculated act of intimidation, Vanguard’s way of reminding her they were always watching. But Agatha wasn’t about to take any chances.
   </p>
<p>
    Not with Rio’s life.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     That thought
    </em>
    hit her harder than she expected, a pang sharp enough to make her pause. She clenched her jaw, forcing the feeling down into the recesses of her mind where it wouldn’t distract her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha drew a steadying breath, her hand brushing the cool metal of the door handle before she pushed it open and stepped inside.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t knock.
   </p>
<p>
    It may have been Rio’s office now, but technically, every office in this building was hers.
   </p>
<p>
    The moment she entered, Rio looked up from her desk, her sharp gaze locking onto Agatha. The tan tailored suit paired with a crisp white shirt had already caught Agatha off guard this morning when Rio had stepped out of the guest bedroom putting on her leather banded watch, moving toward her with an effortless confidence that left her momentarily speechless.
   </p>
<p>
    Now, even seeing it a second time, knowing what to expect, it still hit her like a punch to the chest.
   </p>
<p>
    She looked
    <em>
     good.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Too good.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s thoughts faltered for a moment, but she quickly regained her composure. She stepped forward and sank into the chair across from Rio’s desk, immediately regretting it. The chair was stiff and uncomfortable. Her mind drifted to logistics, already plotting how to have it replaced with something more suitable.
   </p>
<p>
    “You get your jury?” Rio asked, setting her paperwork aside and leaning back in her chair with an ease that seemed almost practiced.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned back as well, mirroring Rio’s posture.
   </p>
<p>
    “I did,” she replied simply.
   </p>
<p>
    The silence that followed felt weighted, pressing down on the space between them. They hadn’t really discussed it—not in any meaningful way.
   </p>
<p>
    Removing Rio from the case.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio had taken the decision in stride, not even flinching when the news came. But Agatha knew her better than that. They were alike in many ways, and if the roles had been reversed, Agatha would’ve been furious. But they were also strategic, calculated. Both of them knew how to play the game, and Rio understood that once the partners made a decision, there was no undoing it.
   </p>
<p>
    Still, understanding didn’t make it hurt any less.
   </p>
<p>
    After all, Agatha wouldn’t even have a jury—wouldn’t have a winnable case against Vanguard—if it weren’t for Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio,” she said softly, the words catching even herself off guard even as they left her lips. “I am sorry.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio tilted her head, her sharp features softening as she regarded Agatha for a moment. Then, with a sigh, she leaned forward, resting her elbows on the desk.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know,” she said simply. “I’m just disappointed I won’t get to watch them go down. Or...”—she paused, her lips curving into a teasing smirk— “see you in your element. The showmanship of a trial and all that, you know?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha snorted, arching a brow as she leaned back in her chair.
   </p>
<p>
    “I thought I put on one hell of a show last night for you,” she shot back, her voice laced with dry humor.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes sparked at that, and she bit her lip briefly, as if to suppress a grin, before letting a slow, deliberate smirk spread across her face.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, you did,” she said, her voice dropping into a low, almost purring tone that sent a flicker of heat course through Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt the heat rise beneath her collar as her mind betrayed her, flashing back to last night—Rio utterly dismantling her and putting her back together for hours, all while wearing those damn glasses. Who knew a simple pair of frames could make someone so feral?
   </p>
<p>
    She forced herself out of that deep, dangerous gutter, lifting her gaze to Rio, who was watching her with a self-satisfied smirk. The kind of smirk that told Agatha, clear as day, that Rio knew
    <em>
     exactly
    </em>
    where her mind had wandered.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shot her a pointed look but quickly remembered why she’d come in. Straightening in her chair, she forced herself to focus.
   </p>
<p>
    “Look,” she began, the hesitation in her tone making her cringe inwardly. She hated how uncomfortable she sounded, but this was an uncomfortable conversation, one she’d been avoiding but could no longer dodge. “I’m going to work from home for the rest of the day.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio straightened slightly at that, her playful expression replaced by a flicker of concern.
   </p>
<p>
    “Everything okay?” she asked, her voice soft but probing.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha waved off the worry with a casual gesture.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” she replied, though her throat felt tight as she forced the next words out. “I’m picking Nicky up from school. He’s coming back to me this week, and since he doesn’t handle change all that well—and there’s now a stranger living in his house”—her sharp gaze flicked pointedly at Rio—“
    <em>
     temporarily
    </em>
    , I figured it was best to break the news to him in person. Prepare him.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio leaned back in her chair, her expression softening as understanding settled across her features.
   </p>
<p>
    Of course, Rio knew about Nicky. She’d walked past his
    <em>
     Toy Story
    </em>
    -themed room more times than Agatha could count. His photos were everywhere—in the living room, the hallway, even on Agatha’s desk. And then there was the day at the park when Rio met him. They’d sat on the bench together, talking for a while, Rio’s easy demeanor putting Nicky at ease almost instantly.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio had to know this conversation was coming and judging by the calm, unshocked expression on her face, she had been expecting it.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay,” Rio murmured softly, her eyes steady on Agatha. “What do you need from me to make this as easy as possible for him—and for you?”
   </p>
<p>
    And that did something to Agatha’s heart.
   </p>
<p>
    It was a small thing, maybe, but it struck a chord deep inside her—one she hadn’t expected. Rio’s sincerity, her lack of hesitation, and the simple, direct way she asked how to help Nicky settled over Agatha like a quiet warmth.
   </p>
<p>
    For so long, she’d been used to the people she saw romantically to sidestep the subject of her son, treating him like an obstacle in her life rather than the center of it. But here was Rio, meeting the moment head-on, no discomfort, no excuses—just understanding and a willingness to do whatever was needed.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt her chest tighten, the sensation unfamiliar and uncomfortably tender. She cleared her throat, willing herself to push past the strange flutter it sent through her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Honestly,” she sighed, the word carrying the weight of her uncertainty, “I’m not really sure. He already took to you at the park—faster than I’ve ever seen—but he might be different in his own space. I guess...”
   </p>
<p>
    She hesitated, her eyes meeting Rio’s, searching for some reassurance.
   </p>
<p>
    “Play it by ear? He can be unpredictable sometimes.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio nodded, her expression shifting into a weary smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “Wonder where he got that from?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shot her a look, equal parts amused and exasperated, before letting out a resigned sigh.
   </p>
<p>
    “He
    <em>
     is
    </em>
    like a miniature version of myself,” she admitted. “Sometimes I wonder if I made him from scratch, with no help from James at all.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio smirked, leaning back in her chair.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, if anyone could pull off immaculate conception through sheer willpower and stubbornness, it would be you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes, but despite herself, a faint smile tugged at the corners of her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    The moment lingered in the air, delicate and charged, before Agatha felt that familiar itch beneath her collar—the one that made her shoulders tense and her composure falter. Every nerve in her body felt like it was vibrating as she reached into her coat pocket, her fingers curling around cool metal.
   </p>
<p>
    Without allowing herself to second-guess, she pulled the object out and slapped it onto Rio’s desk, her hand remaining firmly over it as she slid it toward her.
   </p>
<p>
    “I want this back as soon as this is over,” she said, her voice steady, but her heart pounding so hard she was certain Rio could hear it. Her gaze was sharp and pointed, determined to hide the storm of emotions swirling beneath.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio glanced at her hand, brows knitting in confusion before flicking her gaze back up to Agatha, her expression silently asking,
    <em>
     And what exactly is this thing I’m not supposed to keep?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her throat dry, before she lifted her hand, revealing the object beneath.
   </p>
<p>
    A spare key.
   </p>
<p>
    The silver gleamed starkly against the dark wood of Rio’s desk, catching the light like some sort of fucking beacon, screaming significance louder than Agatha would ever admit out loud.
   </p>
<p>
    “I realized,” she started, but her voice wavered, forcing her to pause and clear her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    She straightened her shoulders, steeling herself against the sudden wave of vulnerability.
   </p>
<p>
    “That you’re going to need it. There will no doubt be times when we won’t be on the same schedule, and you’ll need access to the house when I’m not there.” She hesitated, her voice softening. “Or even when I am. There’s no reason for you to knock.”
   </p>
<p>
    The weight of her words settled between them, heavier than the key itself, and Agatha resisted the urge to fidget, her composure hanging by a thread. She waited for Rio’s response, her heart pounding in her chest like a war drum.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio leaned forward, her movements uncharacteristically slow, and took the key from the desk. Agatha, still seated, watched as Rio turned the small piece of metal over in her fingers, her expression thoughtful, her discomfort flickering in the way her gaze avoided holding Agatha’s for too long.
   </p>
<p>
    It struck Agatha then—Rio was just as uncomfortable in this moment as she was. Somehow, that knowledge made her feel better, steadier. They were both on uneven ground here, both figuring out what this meant as they went along.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio seemed to take a breath, before reaching into her desk drawer to retrieve her keyring. Agatha watched, her chest tightening, as Rio slipped the silver key onto the ring alongside the others—a small, simple action that felt anything but.
   </p>
<p>
    There was something about the way it fit so seamlessly there, like it belonged, that stirred something deep in Agatha. Her heart thudded in her chest as she stared at the keyring, the key to
    <em>
     her home
    </em>
    now nestled among Rio’s other keys, as if it had always been there.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t just a practical gesture—it was a statement. A quiet, unspoken acknowledgment of trust. And though Agatha wasn’t one to get sentimental about such things, she couldn’t shake the way it made her feel.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay,” she said, rising to her feet, desperate to escape the conversation and the feelings boiling up inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    She sent Rio a glance and added, “I’ll see you later,” already regretting how stiff and awkward the words sounded.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     God, this felt weird.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Thankfully, Rio didn’t push. She just nodded, giving Agatha the reprieve she needed.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned to leave but froze at the sound of Rio’s soft voice calling her name.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s voice was quiet yet firm, the two syllables threading through the air with precision, stopping Agatha mid-step.
   </p>
<p>
    With her hand still on the door handle, Agatha turned slowly, her gaze locking onto Rio, who was watching her with an unreadable expression. For a moment, the room felt too still, the soft hum of the buildings heating system the only sound between them.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stood, her movements unhurried, and rounded her desk with ease. She didn’t stop until she was just inches away—close enough that Agatha could feel the faint warmth of her presence and smell the faintest hint of a forest.
   </p>
<p>
    “Did you know I was getting the first-year associate office?” Rio asked, her voice steady, though her eyes searched Agatha’s face for something unspoken.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown by the question. She straightened her shoulders instinctively, as though bracing herself.
   </p>
<p>
    “Of course,” she replied evenly. “I got the email this morning during breakfast.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio nodded, her lips curving into a small, knowing smile that made Agatha’s chest tighten.
   </p>
<p>
    “And do all new offices in your firm come with a
    <em>
     Hoya Carnosa Madara
    </em>
    ?” Rio asked, the name rolling off her tongue with just enough emphasis to make it sound both casual and pointed.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha looked at her in confusion, her brow furrowing.
   </p>
<p>
    “A what?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio tilted her head, glancing over her shoulder with a gesture of her thumb toward the desk.
   </p>
<p>
    “The several-thousand-dollar plant sitting on my desk,” she clarified, her lips tugging into a teasing smile that sent a ripple of warmth and unease through Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Oh.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     That.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha’s mind scrambled for a response, her expression carefully blank. She hadn’t left a card for a reason, and she wasn’t about to own up to it now.
   </p>
<p>
    “I wouldn’t know,” she said with a shrug that she hoped looked convincingly indifferent. “Jen handles the floral orders. You’d have to ask her.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips twitched, her amusement barely concealed as the corners of her mouth pinched, her expression practically glowing with disbelief.
   </p>
<p>
    “Of course,” she murmured, her tone light but undeniably skeptical.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stepped back then, her gaze softening into something gentler, giving Agatha the space to leave without pressing further.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha inhaled deeply, steadying herself as her fingers tightened around the door handle. She turned, opened the door, and stepped forward, eager to escape the tension simmering in the room.
   </p>
<p>
    But just as she was about to leave, Rio’s voice floated after her, quiet and warm.
   </p>
<p>
    “Thank you for the plant,
    <em>
     my love
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    The words pierced through Agatha’s back like an arrow, sharp and unrelenting, wrapping around her heart and squeezing tight. She froze, caught in the doorway, her hand still gripping the handle as if it could anchor her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     My love.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It wasn’t the first time Rio had said those words. Hell, even Agatha said the exact words in the bathroom, while three fingers deep inside Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    But this time, it wasn’t said mockingly or in the throes of passion—no, this time was different. This time, it hit her like a lightning strike, sudden and all-encompassing, pulling her completely off balance—because she liked it.
   </p>
<p>
    She liked it
    <em>
     a lot.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Far more than she was willing to admit, even to herself. The way Rio said it—soft, unhurried, and full of quiet certainty—made something deep inside her ache.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t just the words.
   </p>
<p>
    It was the weight behind them, the meaning woven into every syllable. Rio had told Agatha she loved her, and now this—
    <em>
     my love
    </em>
    —was different.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t just a pet name tossed out to fill the air.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t casual or fleeting.
   </p>
<p>
    It was deliberate, heartfelt, and so
    <em>
     achingly real.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her grip tightening on the door handle, her knuckles white as she fought against the urge to turn around or run out the door.
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice, when it finally came, was barely a whisper, trembling with the emotions she was trying so hard to suppress.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re welcome,” she murmured.
   </p>
<p>
    And then she stepped out, letting the door close behind her with a soft, final click. But as she walked away, the echo of
    <em>
     my love
    </em>
    lingered, sinking deeper into her chest. It felt as though the words were taking root, settling into a place they belonged, as if Rio were carving out a home within her—with every intention of staying.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha had braced herself for all sorts of reactions from Nicky—nervousness, a flurry of questions, maybe even a bit of resistance. She’d rehearsed explanations in her head during the drive, anticipating every possible "why" or "how long."
   </p>
<p>
    But when she picked him up from school and gently explained that Rio would be staying at their house for a while because of a work thing, Nicky just smiled at her and said, “Okay.”
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Okay.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    That was it.
   </p>
<p>
    No questions.
   </p>
<p>
    No hesitation.
   </p>
<p>
    Just
    <em>
     okay.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, momentarily stunned by his simplicity, her carefully rehearsed responses dissolving into irrelevance. She’d prepared for every possible question—except for none at all.
   </p>
<p>
    Of course, the reprieve didn’t last.
   </p>
<p>
    The moment they walked into the house, as Agatha leaned down to slip off her heels, Nicky’s voice broke through the quiet with a question that nearly sent her sprawling into the wall.
   </p>
<p>
    “Is Rio your girlfriend?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha barely caught herself, her hand shooting out to steady against the wall before she could faceplant into it. She stayed there for a moment, braced against the cool surface, her pulse thundering in her ears.
   </p>
<p>
    “Nicky,” Agatha began, her voice sharper than intended as she turned to face him, still steadying herself against the wall. “Where did
    <em>
     that
    </em>
    come from?”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky sat on the floor, tugging at his sneakers. He looked up at her with wide, innocent eyes, the kind that only children could manage—pure curiosity written all over his face.
   </p>
<p>
    “She makes you smile,” he said matter-of-factly, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. “Remember? I saw it.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, caught off guard yet again, her breath hitching as his words settled over her.
   </p>
<p>
    He had saw it.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha took a moment, her mind spinning as she tried to figure out how to navigate this conversation. She could deflect, redirect, or outright lie—but none of that seemed right. The truth was simpler, and besides, she and Rio hadn’t even talked about labels.
   </p>
<p>
    And
    <em>
     girlfriend
    </em>
    ?
   </p>
<p>
    The word alone made her shiver, a full-body cringe rippling through her. It sounded so...juvenile.
   </p>
<p>
    “We are not girlfriends,” Agatha said firmly, slipping off her other heel and straightening to look down at Nicky.
   </p>
<p>
    “We are...” She paused, searching for the right phrasing. “We’re friends who enjoy spending time together outside of work.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky finished taking off his last shoe, placing it neatly beside hers. He stood, tilting his head as he looked up at her with that same unrelenting curiosity.
   </p>
<p>
    “But she makes you smile,” he said again, his tone so simple, so certain. He scrunched his nose, adding, “You see Aunt Jen outside of work, and
    <em>
     she
    </em>
    doesn’t make you smile.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha huffed, crossing her arms.
   </p>
<p>
    “That’s because your Aunt Jen is annoying,” she shot back, narrowing her eyes. “And she’s
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    your aunt,” she added pointedly. “She just told you that to
    <em>
     annoy me
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky shrugged as if the correction didn’t matter.
   </p>
<p>
    “I like calling her Aunt Jen,” he said casually, then paused, as though gathering his thoughts. “So, Rio doesn’t annoy you, and she makes you smile.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed heavily, pinching the bridge of her nose.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Seriously, where was James’s boneheaded genetics in this kid?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She could tell James the same thing five times in a row, and he’d still forget it. Nicky, though? Nicky was all her—sharp, observant, and relentless—and she was paying the price for it now.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, Rio
    <em>
     annoys
    </em>
    me,” she muttered, giving him a playful glare at him for good measure.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky blinked up at her, his lips twitching like he was trying not to grin.
   </p>
<p>
    “But she still makes you smile,” Nicky said, his voice brimming with that maddening confidence.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed, placing her hands on her hips as she stared down at him. She was losing an argument to a five-year-old, and it was
    <em>
     infuriating.
    </em>
    She pursed her lips, trying to maintain
   </p>
<p>
    some semblance of authority, but then Nicky, in all his tiny defiance, mirrored her stance— hands on his hips, chin tilted slightly upward in perfect mimicry.
   </p>
<p>
    And damn it if that didn’t do something to Agatha’s heart.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fine, yes!” she huffed, throwing her hands up in defeat. “You win. She makes me smile.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky’s grin grew into a full-blown, heart-melting smile—the kind that left Agatha powerless to resist. Before she could even process what was happening, he stepped forward and wrapped his arms tightly around her, burying his face against her stomach.
   </p>
<p>
    The suddenness of his hug made her stumble back a step, but Agatha quickly steadied herself, instinctively wrapping her arms around him. Her hand slipped into his messy dark hair, gently smoothing it as if it were second nature.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky tilted his head up, his chin resting against her stomach, his big blue eyes—
    <em>
     her eyes—
    </em>
    meeting hers.
   </p>
<p>
    “I like it when you smile,” he said softly, his voice so full of sincerity it left her breathless.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt her chest tighten, and before she knew it, she was smiling—how could she not? It was impossible to resist him.
   </p>
<p>
    She cupped his small face in her hands, her thumb gently brushing his cheek.
   </p>
<p>
    “I do too,” she whispered, her voice low and tender, as though sharing a secret just for him. And in a way, she was. It
    <em>
     felt
    </em>
    like a secret—an unspoken truth she didn’t often let herself admit.
   </p>
<p>
    For Nicky, though, she’d let it show.
   </p>
<p>
    Because if anyone deserved to see her like this, it was him.
   </p>
<p>
    Hours later, Agatha and Nicky were seated at the dinner table, about to dig into the lasagna Sonya had made. Agatha was mid-scoop, about to place a steaming piece on Nicky’s plate, when the unmistakable sound of the front door opening echoed down the hallway.
   </p>
<p>
    She froze, the serving spoon suspended in midair, her muscles going rigid.
   </p>
<p>
    It all seemed to happen in slow motion. Nicky’s head snapped toward the sound, his wide eyes lighting up. That smile—the one Agatha knew all too well, the one that meant trouble— spread across his face like wildfire.
   </p>
<p>
    “Don’t you—” Agatha began, but before she could finish the sentence, Nicky shot out of his chair like a rocket, all untamed energy and purpose.
   </p>
<p>
    “Nicky!” she growled, twisting in her seat as the lasagna scoop wobbled precariously in her hand. She could only watch as he darted down the hallway, his small footsteps echoing against the walls.
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice followed him, sharp and warning, but utterly ineffective. He was already gone.
   </p>
<p>
    With an exasperated sigh, Agatha slammed the spoon onto his plate, the lasagna splattering messily across the table. She shot to her feet, heart beating wildly in her chest as she chased after him.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hi, Rio!” Nicky’s voice rang out from the hallway, cutting through her and freezing her mid- step.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nearly tripped over her own feet, her heart skipping a beat as she came to a stop just shy of the hallway. She strained to listen, and after a brief pause, she heard it.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hi, buddy.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s voice was soft, warmer than Agatha had ever heard it before. It held a tone that was... different, almost tender.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mama said you’re going to be staying with us for a little bit,” Nicky said, his words innocent but with that childlike straightforwardness that always caught Agatha off guard.
   </p>
<p>
    There was a long pause after that. Then Agatha heard the faint rustle of movement—Rio hanging up her coat, the closet door opening and closing that sounded so loud in the silence.
   </p>
<p>
    “Is that okay with you?” Rio asked, her voice still carrying that gentle warmth.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart ached at the question, the vulnerability in Rio’s tone striking her unexpectedly. She could picture it—Rio looking down at Nicky’s, waiting for his response with the kind of care and patience that felt almost out of place in her Rio’s normally cocky demeanor.
   </p>
<p>
    Leaning against the wall, Agatha closed her eyes for a brief second, swallowing the knot forming in her throat. This was already more than she’d expected—and it was only the first night.
   </p>
<p>
    She took a deep breath, steadying herself before stepping into the hallway. As she rounded the corner, she found Nicky standing just a foot away from Rio, his head tilted back to look up at her. Rio had already hung up her coat and was crouched slightly as she met Nicky’s gaze with a faint smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s okay with me,” Nicky said after a moment, nodding solemnly like he was granting some kind of official approval. “But you should know Mama burns toast sometimes.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha groaned softly.
   </p>
<p>
    “Nicky—”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio glanced up at her then, her expression shifting into something teasing, her eyes sparkling with amusement.
   </p>
<p>
    “Good to know,” she said, her tone light. “I’ll make sure to keep an eye on her when she’s near the toaster.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky giggled at that, clearly delighted, and Agatha could feel her irritation melting under the warmth of the moment. She rolled her eyes, crossing her arms as she leaned against the wall.
   </p>
<p>
    “He doesn’t need encouragement, you know,” she muttered, her voice half-hearted as a small smile tugged at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio straightened, her gaze flicking to Agatha with a look that was softer than she expected.
   </p>
<p>
    “He’s just telling me the important stuff,” she replied. “It’s good to know what I’m walking into.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky reached out then, grabbing Rio’s hand like it was the most natural thing in the world.
   </p>
<p>
    “Come on,” he said, tugging her gently toward the dining room. “Sonya made lasagna, and it’s
    <em>
     really
    </em>
    good.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio let him lead her, casting a quick glance over her shoulder at Agatha, who lingered in the hallway, watching them go.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, Agatha just stood there, her arms uncrossing as she rubbed the back of her neck. The sight of Nicky holding Rio’s hand, so trusting and comfortable, tugged at something deep inside her. It was a strange mix of relief and vulnerability—like a door she’d kept locked was quietly creaking open.
   </p>
<p>
    Shaking off the thought, she followed them into the dining room, her voice calm but firm. “Nicky, sit down properly this time. And Rio, don’t let him con you into extra dessert.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio raised a brow, a playful smirk tugging at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, I don’t know. He seems like a pretty good negotiator.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed as she reclaimed her seat at the table, already regretting the inevitable chaos Rio seemed poised to encourage.
   </p>
<p>
    “You have no idea,” she muttered.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky, already seated, grinned at Rio and gestured to the chair directly across from him. Rio moved forward, taking the offered seat without hesitation. Agatha, settling back into her spot next to Nicky, glanced at Rio across the table. She fought the urge to fidget—or worse, to smile—because Rio's presence at the table with her and Nicky was unsettling in a way that wasn’t entirely unpleasant.
   </p>
<p>
    With forced composure, Agatha leaned forward and scooped a generous helping of lasagna onto Rio’s plate.
   </p>
<p>
    “Thanks,” Rio said, her voice calm, but that infuriating smirk was back, lighting up her face.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha narrowed her eyes at her, her glare doing nothing to erase the amusement playing on Rio’s lips.
   </p>
<p>
    The silence at the table was broken by Nicky, who, mid-bite, looked up and declared.
   </p>
<p>
    “Today my friend Sam told me that birds have hollow bones. That’s why they can fly so easily. They don’t weigh a lot.”
   </p>
<p>
    Both Agatha and Rio turned to him, their attention now on the small, sauce-smeared face smiling brightly as he continued to eat.
   </p>
<p>
    “That’s cool,” Rio said, nodding as she took her first bite of lasagna.
   </p>
<p>
    Before either of them could say more, the oven timer went off, its beep cutting through the moment. Agatha pushed her chair back and started to stand.
   </p>
<p>
    “That’s the bread,” she said, moving toward the kitchen.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’ll get it,” Rio said quickly, already rising and shooting her a look as if daring her to argue.
   </p>
<p>
    “They’re already cooked!” Agatha called after her, exasperation creeping into her voice. “I can’t ruin them!”
   </p>
<p>
    “Best not take any chances,” Rio quipped over her shoulder, disappearing into the kitchen.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky giggled, his small shoulders shaking as he shoveled another forkful of lasagna into his mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned to him, her expression one of exaggerated betrayal.
   </p>
<p>
    “Et tu, Brutus?” she asked, placing a hand dramatically over her heart.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky paused mid-chew, his brow furrowing in confusion.
   </p>
<p>
    “Who’s Brutus?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha snorted.
   </p>
<p>
    “Never mind, kid. Finish your dinner.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha glanced toward the kitchen, where Rio was pulling the bread from the oven and setting it carefully on the stove. Her movements were casual, fluid, as though she’d always belonged in this space. Agatha’s eyes shifted, catching sight of the blue folder sitting on the countertop island that separated the kitchen from the living room—the one she’d left there to discuss with Rio later tonight.
   </p>
<p>
    Her chest tightened. She hated the idea of using Nicky’s presence as a buffer, but she wasn’t above it. She’d already endured too many hard conversations today, and the thought of diving into another one—this one particularly fraught—made her stomach twist.
   </p>
<p>
    “There’s a document from work I need you to look at on the countertop,” Agatha said, forcing her voice into something she hoped sounded casual, even as her heart hammered in her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio turned, one brow lifting slightly in curiosity, but she didn’t say a word. She crossed the kitchen to the island, picked up the blue folder, and flipped it open with a practiced ease that sent a ripple of tension through Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stayed in her seat, gripping her fork tightly, the edges of the metal biting into her fingers. The room felt unnervingly quiet, the hum of the oven and the faint clink of cutlery the only sounds filling the space. Even Nicky, engrossed in his lasagna, seemed oblivious to the weight.
   </p>
<p>
    She watched as Rio scanned the document, her eyes moving steadily over the page. Agatha could practically feel the seconds stretching, each one tightening the knot in her chest. Then it happened—the exact moment Rio’s gaze landed on Agatha’s signature at the bottom of the
    <em>
     Relationship Disclosure Form
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s expression shifted, subtle but unmistakable. She looked up then, meeting Agatha’s eyes across the space that suddenly felt far too small.
   </p>
<p>
    They stared at each other, the silence stretching taut between them, unspoken words and questions hanging heavy in the air.
   </p>
<p>
    For a brief moment, Agatha forgot how to breathe.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio held Agatha’s gaze for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then, without a word, she reached over, picked up the pen resting beside the folder, and signed the document with a quick, fluid motion. She closed the folder, placing it neatly back on the countertop before turning to retrieve the bread.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha watched as Rio rounded the kitchen island, her movements calm, almost too casual, as if she didn’t just sign her name on a legal document declaring they were in a relationship.
   </p>
<p>
    “Did you know owls can turn their heads all the way around, but they can’t move their eyes?” Rio said, her tone light and conversational, as though she were merely continuing a casual chat from Nicky’s earlier comment about birds.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky looked up at her with wide, amazed eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    “No way, that’s so cool!”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio smiled at him.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha, still clutching her fork, stared at Rio, blinking as she tried to reconcile the effortless ease in her tone with the gravity of what had just happened. Rio didn’t even glance her way, her focus entirely on slicing the bread with calm, precise movements.
   </p>
<p>
    “What else do you know about birds?” Nicky asked, his voice eager.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio shrugged, her expression casual.
   </p>
<p>
    “Quite a bit,” she replied. “I watched a documentary on them last year that was really good.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky’s eyes went wide with excitement, and he turned to Agatha, practically bouncing in his seat.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mama, can we watch the bird show after dinner?” he asked, his words tumbling out in a rush. “Then I can tell Sam all about it tomorrow!”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked at him, still half-rooted in the emotional whirlwind of moments earlier, but Nicky’s enthusiasm tugged ger back to the present. She sighed, finally setting her fork down, and gave him a small smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “Sure,” she said, her voice softening. “We can watch it after dinner.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky beamed, his joy infectious, while Rio set the bread on the table with a faint smile of her own. She slid into her chair, casually grabbing a slice of bread and buttering it as if this dinner were any other mundane evening.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky’s excitement bubbled over as he launched into another story, his words tumbling over each other in an energetic rush.
   </p>
<p>
    As his voice filled the room, both Agatha and Rio looked up at the same time, their gazes locking across the table. For a moment, everything else seemed to fade—the chaos of the day, the weight of earlier conversations—leaving only the quiet between them.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips curved into a smirk, one that was both knowing and playful, and it sent a ripple through Agatha’s chest.
   </p>
<p>
    And God— it felt so right.
   </p>
<p>
    Her, Nicky... and Rio.

<p>
   Lilia showing up at court...loved it. Also her "taking the liberty" to secure the relationship disclosure form
        for Agatha had be rolling.
  </p>
<p>
   And James Hughes from Vanguard...showing up. Bum bum bum. (also I just realized that Agatha's ex-husband's name
        is James. So I am sorry for the confusion. Just caught that)
  </p>
<p>
   That whole scene in Rio's office had me melting into a puddle into the floor. Especially the "my love" and
        Agatha's little "Your welcome."
  </p>
<p>
   "Made from scratch" was just
   <em>

```
Agatha was grumpy.
   </p>
<p>
    She slept like shit, tossing and turning in her king-sized bed. All night she’d wake up sprawled on one side, only to find herself on the other an hour later, tangled in the sheets. By the time the first few hours of this restless cycle had passed, she knew exactly what the issue was—and that realization made her mind just as restless as her body.
   </p>
<p>
    Her body was searching for Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Every time she shifted in her sleep, her subconscious seemed to reach out, and every time it came up empty-handed, it jolted her awake.
   </p>
<p>
    But no matter how much she wanted to— God , how much she wanted to—Agatha couldn’t bring herself to go to Rio’s room. Every fiber of her being pulled her in that direction, but she stayed put, forcing herself to resist.
   </p>
<p>
    There were reasons, of course.
   </p>
<p>
    Practical ones.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky, while a great sleeper, had a habit of sneaking into her room on occasion, and she couldn’t bear the thought of him waking up in the middle of the night and not finding her there.
   </p>
<p>
    And then there was the other reason, the one that made her chest tighten every time she thought about it.
   </p>
<p>
    To actually do it—to slip into Rio’s bed and wrap herself around her—that would be opening herself up too much. It wasn’t just about sharing a bed. It was about admitting something deeper—something far more terrifying.
   </p>
<p>
    To need someone—to need Rio, like that? It felt like a vulnerability too great to face.
   </p>
<p>
    Was this what love was?
   </p>
<p>
    Why did people willingly subject themselves to this feeling?
   </p>
<p>
    And more importantly, why the
    <em>
     fuck
    </em>
    did they romanticize it?
   </p>
<p>
    There was nothing poetic or beautiful about this gnawing, restless ache. It felt like a betrayal of everything Agatha had built herself into—everything she prided herself on.
   </p>
<p>
    And now here she was...not being able to sleep without Rio?
   </p>
<p>
    What was next?
   </p>
<p>
    Was she going to lose her ability to fucking breathe without Rio?
   </p>
<p>
    The town car came to an abrupt stop, jolting Agatha out of her thoughts as she instinctively braced herself against the partition, narrowly avoiding a headfirst collision.
   </p>
<p>
    “For fuck’s sake,” she muttered under her breath, her glare snapping to the barrier separating her from the driver.
   </p>
<p>
    “Apologies, Ms. Harkness,” Dan’s voice crackled through the intercom, his tone calm but edged with caution, as if he could feel the waves of irritation rolling off her. “Bike messenger cut us off.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha huffed sharply, settling back into the plush leather seat.
   </p>
<p>
    “Of course,” she muttered to herself, closing her eyes for a brief moment to gather her composure.
   </p>
<p>
    Just before she closed her yes, out of the corner of them, she caught Rio sitting next to her, frowning slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    She’d been giving Agatha that same look all morning—watchful, concerned, and just perceptive enough to be irritating. Rio had a way of sensing Agatha’s mood the way most people sensed the weather, and nothing—not even the fucking delicious apple cinnamon pancakes Rio had made for breakfast—had managed to shift it.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky, on the other hand, had been a different story. He’d buzzed around the table like a tiny whirlwind, devouring his pancakes with questionable table manners and peppering Rio with nonstop chatter. Every moment between bites, he’d paused to confirm his “bird facts” from the documentary they’d watched last night, his little face lighting up every time Rio nodded in agreement or added another tidbit.
   </p>
<p>
    “You going to tell me what’s wrong?” Rio asked, her voice steady but probing.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha closed her eyes, letting out a quiet sigh. She’d been expecting this moment, honestly.
   </p>
<p>
    Waiting for it.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t a matter of
    <em>
     if
    </em>
    Rio would call her out but
    <em>
     when.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Still, she was surprised Rio had lasted this long. She’d dealt with Agatha’s sharp edges and cold shoulder for hours without pressing, without pushing, giving her space to stew in her
   </p>
<p>
    own frustration. But Rio’s patience had limits, and it seemed they’d finally run out.
   </p>
<p>
    “I slept like shit,” Agatha sighed out, the honestly surprising her or maybe it was the exhaustion.
   </p>
<p>
    Either way, the words couldn't be taken back.
   </p>
<p>
    The silence from Rio was deafening, stretching long enough that Agatha almost regretted speaking at all. But then she heard the faint sound of shuffling, and a moment later, she felt the faintest slide of familiar fingers across her shoulder, trailing upward to her neck before burying themselves in the back of her hair.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s touch was firm yet soothing, her fingers kneading gently at the base of Agatha’s skull, massaging the tension Agatha hadn’t even realized she was holding there.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha exhaled slowly, the tension in her shoulders easing as Rio’s touch worked its way through her defenses. She hadn’t even realized how much she needed this—needed
    <em>
     her
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    She’d been grumpy all morning, avoiding Rio’s touch like it was the plague, channeling all her frustration and shitty sleep into silent blame. It was petty, of course. She knew it. But she was not above pettiness, and most of the time, leaning into that pettiness felt a hell a lot easier than admitting what was really bothering her.
   </p>
<p>
    But now, with Rio’s fingers gently massaging the back of her head, it was hard to hold onto her stubbornness. Hard to hold onto
    <em>
     anything,
    </em>
    really, except the undeniable fact that somehow Rio always knew exactly what she needed.
   </p>
<p>
    “I didn’t sleep well either,” murmured Rio, in that lower timber that had a new shiver moving down Agatha’s spine. “I missed you last night.”
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Jesus.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes snapped open, her gaze locking onto Rio. She was met with that soft expression—just a little slice of vulnerability—that always managed to leave her breathless.
   </p>
<p>
    Even under Agatha’s sharp gaze, Rio fingers didn’t stop. They continued their gentle path along Agatha’s scalp, as she met Agatha’s eyes head-on.
   </p>
<p>
    “You did?” Agatha whispered, her voice smaller than she intended.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips curved into a gentle smile, her eyes holding that steady, honest look that left no room for doubt.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” Rio said, her voice calm and confident, as if the admission cost her nothing. “I like being held by you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the raw simplicity of Rio’s words. Her chest tightened, her throat suddenly dry as she struggled to form a response.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s fingers continued their slow, soothing path along Agatha’s scalp, grounding her in a moment that felt far too intimate—too real. The tension Agatha had been holding onto all morning seemed to crack and splinter under the weight of Rio’s words and touch.
   </p>
<p>
    “I...” Agatha started, but the words faltered, catching in her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    What was she supposed to say to that? To someone so unflinchingly honest, so open, when she felt like a storm barely contained behind walls she’d spent a lifetime building?
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t push. She just kept her touch gentle and steady, waiting, her eyes never wavering from Agatha’s.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her voice finally finding its way back to her.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m not exactly the best at... this.” She gestured vaguely between them, her tone brittle.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smile softened even further, her fingers pausing for a brief moment before sliding to rest at the nape of Agatha’s neck. Her thumb brushed gently against her skin, the touch impossibly tender.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Rio said, her voice steady and warm. It was a tone that seemed to have the exacting ability to unravel something deep inside Agatha. “There’s no right way to do this. I think we’re just figuring it out as we go.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes held Agatha’s for a moment longer before her smile transformed into that infuriating smirk—the one that always signaled trouble.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s stomach sank preemptively.
   </p>
<p>
    “And,” Rio added, her tone teasing but sharp enough to land its mark, “if you want to save yourself some trouble in the future, you could just
    <em>
     tell
    </em>
    me what’s wrong instead of being a crab ass all morning.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s glare was immediate and sharp, her lips pressing into a tight line.
   </p>
<p>
    “Crab ass?” Agatha repeated, her tone teetering on the edge between genuine offense and mock indignation.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk only widened, her confidence palpable as the hand resting on the back of Agatha’s neck tightened slightly, just enough to ground her, to make her feel held in more ways than one.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, I stand by it,” Rio said, her voice low but undeniably smug.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a deep exhale, the kind that seemed to come from somewhere deep in her chest, releasing a fraction of the tension she’d been carrying.
   </p>
<p>
    “Someone’s feeling brave today,” she muttered, giving Rio a pointed look.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk only widened, her confidence radiating in that way that simultaneously irritated and fascinated Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well,” Rio said, her voice laced with teasing, “I figured why not push a little more since, you know...
    <em>
     we’re in a relationship now
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line at that, her expression hardening slightly.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     And there it was.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She’d been wondering when Rio would bring
    <em>
     that
    </em>
    up.
   </p>
<p>
    They hadn’t really talked about it last night. What signing that document meant.
   </p>
<p>
    After dinner, true to her word, they’d watched the bird documentary—a mind-numbingly dull experience for Agatha, but Nicky had loved every second of it. Apparently, even the second viewing was enough to hold Rio’s attention, though Agatha suspected she was just humoring Nicky.
   </p>
<p>
    The only thing remotely entertaining about the whole ordeal had been Nicky peppering Rio with question after question, each one more specific than the last. And somehow, Rio had answered every single one without missing a beat, as if she had an endless reservoir of bird facts tucked away.
   </p>
<p>
    After that came Nicky’s bedtime routine, which was always more challenging on his first night back. It took longer than usual, his energy winding down in uneven bursts, and by the time he was finally tucked in and asleep, Agatha was exhausted.
   </p>
<p>
    When she returned to the living room, Rio was gone, having already retreated to her room.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t know how to feel about that
   </p>
<p>
    Was she disappointed?
   </p>
<p>
    Or was she relieved?
   </p>
<p>
    Maybe a little of both.
   </p>
<p>
    And now here they were, the unspoken from last night finally being spoken, as Rio’s words hung in the air like a dare.
   </p>
<p>
    “That was for protection—for the firm,” Agatha said, the words leaving her lips sharper than she intended, though she knew how weak the argument sounded even as she said it.
   </p>
<p>
    Of course, Rio saw right through it.
   </p>
<p>
    She always did.
   </p>
<p>
    Her hand slipped from the back of Agatha’s neck as she leaned back slightly, fixing her with a look. It wasn’t angry or mocking—it was worse. It was piercing and patient, the kind of
   </p>
<p>
    look that made Agatha want to squirm in her seat.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha pursed her lips, irritation prickling under her skin as she felt the unraveling begin.
   </p>
<p>
    “What do you want me to say?” she huffed, throwing her hands up in exasperation. She knew she was being petulant, but she couldn’t help it. Her palms felt clammy, and she rubbed them against her pants.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio arched a single brow, her silence speaking volumes, pressing against Agatha like a weight she couldn’t shrug off.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay!” Agatha snapped, throwing her hands up in frustration. “We are...” She started, but the words caught in her throat, refusing to cooperate.
   </p>
<p>
    Her lips parted, but nothing came out.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio snorted softly, the sound warm and unguarded, a teasing smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    “You are absolutely ridiculous,” she said, her tone light but laced with affection and exasperation. Then, meeting Agatha’s gaze head-on, she added with quiet certainty, “
    <em>
     Agatha
    </em>
    ... we are in a relationship.”
   </p>
<p>
    The simplicity of the statement made Agatha’s breath hitch, her chest tightening as the weight of it settled over her.
   </p>
<p>
    There it was—laid out in black and white,
   </p>
<p>
    No room for evasion.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stared at Rio, her jaw tightening as her mind raced to push back against the simplicity of it. But the steadiness in Rio’s gaze, the way her teasing smile softened into something more genuine pierced through Agatha, straight through her defenses.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay,” Agatha finally said, her voice quiet, almost reluctant, but there.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio tilted her head, her teasing smile softening.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay?” she echoed, her voice laced with a faint hint of amusement, like she couldn’t help but savor this rare moment of vulnerability from Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes snapped back to hers, her expression sharp but lacking its usual edge.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, okay,” she repeated, her voice louder this time. “We’re in a relationship. There. Happy now?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smile grew, slow and steady, and Agatha’s heart lurched in her chest.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Fuck.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    They were in an actual relationship.
   </p>
<p>
    The thought hit her like a truck, the weight of it slamming into her all at once. She was in a relationship—with a woman. She was in love with a woman 16 years her junior. It should make her skin crawl, shouldn’t it? It should set off every alarm bell she had, make her recoil, reject this whole thing outright.
   </p>
<p>
    Everything about this should feel
    <em>
     wrong.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    And yet... it didn’t.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t wrong.
   </p>
<p>
    And that, perhaps, was what terrified her most of all.
   </p>
<p>
    Thank
    <em>
     fucking
    </em>
    God the car chose that moment to stop, jerking slightly as it came to a halt in front of the office. The timing felt like divine intervention, yanking Agatha back from the edge of the spiraling thoughts she wasn’t ready to fully process.
   </p>
<p>
    Her hand shot toward the door handle, desperate for escape, for fresh air, for anything to shake off the weight pressing down on her chest. But before she could pull it open, a hand landed gently on her arm, stopping her in her tracks.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her pulse skipping as she turned her head.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s dark eyes locked onto hers, steady and intense, and before Agatha could even process the moment, Rio moved.
   </p>
<p>
    Reaching up, Rio grabbed the back of Agatha’s neck, her fingers firm as she pulled her forward. And then Rio kissed her—searing, deliberate, and with enough heat to leave Agatha’s thoughts scattered like leaves in a high wind.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t tentative, wasn’t soft, wasn’t polite. It was everything Rio was—bold, sure, and unapologetically direct.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath caught, her mind blanking under the sheer force of it. She gripped the door handle as if were the only thing anchoring her to reality.
   </p>
<p>
    When Rio finally pulled back, her lips lingered for just a moment longer than necessary, she smiled—soft, knowing,
    <em>
     infuriating
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    “Have a good day,
    <em>
     my love,
    </em>
    ” Rio murmured against Agatha’s lips, the words soft and intimate, yet so confident they left no room for misinterpretation.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha huffed in response, the sound more out of exasperation than anything else, though it did nothing to mask the way her heart fluttered in her chest, betraying her completely.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio,” she muttered, pulling back just enough to meet her gaze, her own lips tingling from the kiss. Her tone was sharp, but the faint pink dusting her cheeks gave her away.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk returned, playful yet laced with something deeper.
   </p>
<p>
    “Go on,” she teased, her hand lingering at the back of Agatha’s neck for a moment longer before releasing her. “You’ve got an empire to run.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha narrowed her eyes, giving Rio her best glare as she adjusted her jacket and reached for the door handle again.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re lucky I like you,” she grumbled under her breath, though the words carried no real heat.
   </p>
<p>
    “You love me,” Rio shot back, her voice light and teasing as she leaned forward, starting to crawl after her.
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha was quicker. She stepped out of the car with practiced grace, shutting the door firmly behind her—right in Rio’s face.
   </p>
<p>
    The faintest of smiles tugged at Agatha’s lips as she adjusted her bag, the lingering heat of the kiss still buzzing faintly beneath her skin.
   </p>
<p>
    And just like that, her mood had significantly improved.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s mood carried her through most of the day. She finalized key elements of her trial strategy for the Vanguard case, set to begin on Wednesday. And then she held two client conferences, and a minor client emergency cropped up—a contract mishap that could’ve spiraled into something worse if she didn’t handle it personally.
   </p>
<p>
    But as she ran out of things to do, that nagging that she was putting something off was curling at her neck. She could avoid it, like she had been all day—but then she would have to deal with Lilia’s knowing glances that somehow found her multiple times today.
   </p>
<p>
    Which is why Agatha, against her better judgment, bit the bullet and now found herself standing outside
    <em>
     one particular
    </em>
    office she avoided like the plague. The godforsaken blue folder was clutched in her hands, her grip so tight the edges were beginning to crumple.
   </p>
<p>
    Closing her eyes, she let out a long, exasperated sigh.
   </p>
<p>
    First, she cursed herself for allowing this situation to spiral into what it had become.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, she cursed Lilia for being the catalyst that had forced her hand.
   </p>
<p>
    And lastly, and most of all, she cursed Rio—because, obviously,
    <em>
     this
    </em>
    was all Rio’s fault.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha steeled herself, grabbing the door handle and pushing it open with more force than necessary. She stepped inside the HR office, which consisted of just one person—one person who, despite her size and age, somehow managed to strike fear into every partner, associate, and intern alike.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha, what a surprise,” came the high-pitched unmistakable voice from behind the desk, warm and welcoming.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha pasted on a fake smile, one that didn’t even come close to reaching her eyes, and looked up at the woman. Nearly in her 70s now, she was the only person in the world who made Agatha feel like she was back in the principal’s office, awaiting a lecture.
   </p>
<p>
    Her blonde, shoulder-length hair was always tastefully styled, her posture was perfect, and her kind smile seemed almost too genuine to be real. The woman practically radiated a
    <em>
     goodness
    </em>
    that immediately set Agatha on edge, like she was walking into some kind of moral interrogation.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hi, Mrs. Hart,” Agatha said, her voice higher pitched and completely fake to mask her discomfort.
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart gave her a knowing look.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha, we’ve worked together for nearly 20 years. How many times have I asked you to call me Sharon?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out an awkward laugh, the sound more forced than genuine.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     No, thank you.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Old habits die hard,” she deflected, brushing off the request with a wave of her hand as she stepped forward and placed the blue folder on the desk, throwing caution to the wind. “I need to file this.”
   </p>
<p>
    And with that, she turned on her heel, fully prepared to make her escape.
   </p>
<p>
    “Wait,” Mrs. Hart called out, her tone calm but commanding.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze mid-step, her shoulders tensing as she closed her eyes for a moment.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Of course it wouldn’t be that easy.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Sighing internally, Agatha turned on her heel, schooling her expression into a mask of neutrality as she faced Mrs. Hart again.
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart glanced down at the folder on her desk, her finger tapping against it with a hesitant rhythm, as if wary of what might be inside.
   </p>
<p>
    “Are we being sued by one of the first years again?” she asked, giving Agatha a pointed look.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha bristled, crossing her arms tightly over her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    “No,” she said curtly. “And even if they tried, they wouldn’t have a leg to stand on. Their contract is ironclad.”
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart raised a brow, unimpressed.
   </p>
<p>
    “Did you cause bodily harm to any of our employees?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha scoffed, rolling her eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    “That was
    <em>
     one
    </em>
    time, and my coffee
    <em>
     slipped,
    </em>
    ” she hissed defensively.
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart didn’t miss a beat.
   </p>
<p>
    “Did you hold another company-wide meeting to present a PowerPoint ranking all the associates from ‘safe’ to ‘most likely to get fired’?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha glared, her lips thinning as she leaned forward slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    “No,” she said with exaggerated calm, tapping her chin in mock contemplation. “But now that you mention it, I do think we’re due for another one of those.”
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart opened her mouth to throw out another one of Agatha’s “questionable decisions” but Agatha stepped forward.
   </p>
<p>
    “No, no, and no,” said Agatha losing her patience. “Just open it,” she gestured to the folder.
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart gave her a knowing look, then grabbed the folder and leaned back in her chair, opening it with the deliberate care of someone who had seen it all but still expected a surprise.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha held her breath, watching as Mrs. Hart scanned the document.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh!” Mrs. Hart said, a note of surprise in her voice. She flicked her gaze up to Agatha, her smile widening. “You must be so proud! I always knew that son of yours was a smart one.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, her brow furrowing in confusion.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Was this woman going senile?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “What—” Agatha started, but Mrs. Hart cut her off by lifting the paper and holding it up for her to see.
   </p>
<p>
    “Look at all those gold stars!” Mrs. Hart exclaimed, delighted.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes dropped to the paper, her confusion turning to horror as she took in the childish chore chart. Written at the top in big, blocky letters were the words
    <em>
     “I Listened Today,”
    </em>
    followed by an obscene number of gold stars haphazardly stuck across the page.
   </p>
<p>
    It only took a second for Agatha to piece it together, and when she did, a deep flush crept up her neck and spread across her face, hot and searing.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Oh.
    </em>
<em>
     Rio.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha’s hands curled into fists at her sides as she bit down the stream of curses bubbling to the surface. She could already picture Rio’s smug expression, that infuriating smirk as she’d slipped the paper into the folder, knowing full well it what it meant.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s teeth clenched, her jaw tight with fury.
   </p>
<p>
    She was going to kill her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Slowly.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha moved with a speed that was anything but slow, practically ripping the paper from Mrs. Hart’s hands in a motion so abrupt it bordered on embarrassing.
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart startled at the ferocity of it, her expression a mix of surprise and mild amusement.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” Agatha hissed, catching herself mid-snap and forcing her tone into something more controlled. “I am
    <em>
     very
    </em>
    proud.”
   </p>
<p>
    She clutched the paper covered in gold stars in one hand, crumpling it slightly, while her eyes darted to the open folder now sitting on the desk. There it was—the
    <em>
     Relationship Disclosure Form,
    </em>
    practically flashing up at her. Mrs. Hart’s gaze followed hers.
   </p>
<p>
    The older woman’s eyes went wide as she took in the contents of the folder.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, watching in horror as Mrs. Hart’s eyes scanned the paperwork, her expression shifting from shock to something far more measured. Then, slowly, Mrs. Hart’s gaze moved back up to Agatha, a curious arch of her brow adding to the growing tension.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re disclosing a relationship with...” Mrs. Hart paused, glancing down at the form again for confirmation, her voice tinged with incredulity. “Rio Vidal. A first-year associate?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her mind racing for a response, but in the end, she decided—
    <em>
     fuck it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “That’s what it says,” she replied coolly, flicking her hand toward the document as if it were nothing more than a minor inconvenience, and not something capable of giving Agatha a panic attack.
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart’s gaze didn’t waver.
   </p>
<p>
    “Isn’t Rio Vidal’s file the one your assistant returned to me last month with permanent marker scribbled all over it? Her company picture had a mustache and a beard”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha fought hard against the smirk tugging at the corners of her lips, determined to keep her expression impassive. She remembered the moment vividly—letting Nicky draw the file purely out of spite toward Rio at the time.
   </p>
<p>
    But Mrs. Hart didn’t need to know that.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’ll speak to Billy about his negligence with personnel files later,” Agatha said smoothly, deflecting with practiced ease. “Now, are we done here?”
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart gave her a long, skeptical look, the kind that could see through just about anything. With a resigned sigh, she closed the folder, tapping it lightly against the desk.
   </p>
<p>
    “Have you removed her from your direct report?” she asked, her tone all business now.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” Agatha answered, her voice sharp and to the point.
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart nodded, closing the folder with a soft
    <em>
     thump
    </em>
    and setting it neatly on her desk.
   </p>
<p>
    “Good,” she said briskly. “Then we’re done—for now.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha took that as her cue to leave, turning on her heel with practiced precision and heading for the door. Her pulse was still pounding, and all she wanted was to escape this office.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Mrs. Hart called out just as her hand reached the door handle.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha paused, stiffening slightly before turning back to face her.
   </p>
<p>
    Mrs. Hart’s expression had softened, and for a moment, Agatha saw something almost maternal in her warm smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “Congratulations,” Mrs. Hart said gently. “I hope it works out for you, dear.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words hit Agatha like a quiet wave, disarming her in a way she hadn’t expected. She opened her mouth to respond, but nothing came out, so she settled for a small, tight nod.
   </p>
<p>
    Without another word, she turned back to the door, stepping out into the hallway. Her footsteps were quick, her chest tight, but Mrs. Hart’s parting words lingered, trailing after her like a faint echo she couldn’t quite shake.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t until Agatha was halfway to her office that she realized she was still clutching the piece of paper covered in gold stars.
   </p>
<p>
    She came to an abrupt stop in the middle of the hallway, glancing down at it. The sheer number of gold stars on it, and knowing Rio everyone was purposeful, marking the exact moment Agatha did listen, made her jaw tighten. Whatever lingering warmth she’d felt from Mrs. Hart’s unexpected blessing evaporated in an instant.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Rio.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her name simmered in Agatha’s mind.
   </p>
<p>
    Without a second thought, she spun on her heel and marched toward Rio’s office with purpose. Judging by the way the associates practically leapt out of her path—side-stepping into cubicles and flattening themselves against the walls—her expression was likely a perfect reflection of the storm brewing inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stormed into Rio’s office, ready to unleash the anger building in her chest, only to find it empty.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes darted around the small space as if Rio might somehow be hiding in one of the corners. When that proved fruitless, she turned sharply on her heel, her movements taut with irritation, before reaching into her pocket and fishing out her phone.
   </p>
<p>
    Her thumb tapped the screen with precision, dialing Rio’s number as she paced the office. She shut the door firmly behind her, the sound reverberating through the small space as she raised the phone to her ear.
   </p>
<p>
    It rang once. Twice.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio picked up on the third ring.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hello, my love,” Rio said, her voice low and raspy, that soft endearment curling around the words like it belonged there.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze for a moment, her mind blanking at the sound of those two simple words. She hated it—hated how it hit her, unbalancing her just enough to make her forget why she was even mad in the first place.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s grip on the phone tightened as she forced herself to snap out of the haze Rio’s voice always seemed to put her in.
   </p>
<p>
    “Where are you?” she demanded.
   </p>
<p>
    There was a pause on the other end, followed by the faint shuffling of movement and the low hum of traffic in the background.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m with Mrs. Kale,” Rio said, her voice calm as ever. “She’s taking me to a deposition across town.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze at that, her heart giving a sudden, unwelcome lurch.
   </p>
<p>
    “Do you have security?” she asked, her irritation dissolving into something else entirely—
    <em>
     concern
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” Rio replied, her tone steady and reassuring. “Two very large bodyguards trailing us like shadows.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Good,” Agatha muttered, relief flooding through her.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, there was silence as she paused, catching her breath. Then she remembered
    <em>
     exactly
    </em>
    why she’d called.
   </p>
<p>
    “I found your little sticker chart,” she growled, her voice low and cutting.
   </p>
<p>
    There was a beat of silence on the other end, just long enough to let Agatha know Rio was composing herself.
   </p>
<p>
    “Did you now?” Rio remarked, her voice deceptively calm.
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha could hear it—the faint edge of amusement she was trying—and failing, to suppress.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” Agatha hissed, her grip tightening on the crumpled paper. The heat of her anger turned into something else entirely, a slow burn coursing through her, far more dangerous.
   </p>
<p>
    “When you get home,” Agatha growled, her voice dropping into a husky, dangerous tone, “
    <em>
     your ass is mine
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn't miss a beat.
   </p>
<p>
    “That sounds like fun,” she responded, her professional voice slipping with a playful heat.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha opened her mouth to respond, ready to deliver a biting retort, but the unmistakable sound of Jen’s voice cut through the line.
   </p>
<p>
    “Who are you talking to?” Jen asked, her tone dripping with suspicion. There was a brief pause before she added, sharper this time, “
    <em>
     Gross.
    </em>
    Is that Agatha? Tell her no personal calls on company time!”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s anger, already simmering, flared back to full force, snapping like a whip.
   </p>
<p>
    “Tell Jen she can fuck off,” she snapped, her voice cutting through the phone with precision.
   </p>
<p>
    The line went silent for a beat.
   </p>
<p>
    “I will
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    be saying that to my boss,” Rio replied, her tone dry but amused, though Agatha could hear the faint shuffling of movement in the background. “Look, we just got to the building. I have to go.”
   </p>
<p>
    Before Agatha could respond, Rio’s voice softened, a warmth threading through her words.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Te veo,
    </em>
    ” Rio murmured, her voice carrying a gentleness that caught Agatha completely off guard.
   </p>
<p>
    The line clicked off suddenly, leaving Agatha staring at her phone, her breath caught somewhere between a huff of frustration and something deeper she refused to name.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t until a moment later, as she stood there alone in Rio’s office, the ridiculous gold- star-covered paper still crumpled in her hand, that the realization struck her.
   </p>
<p>
    She had said,
    <em>
     “when you get home.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Not
    <em>
     her
    </em>
    home.
   </p>
<p>
    Not
    <em>
     Agatha’s
    </em>
    home.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Home.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    As in Rio’s home, too.
   </p>
<p>
    She hadn’t even thought about it—it had slipped out so naturally, so unconsciously, that it hit her like a lightning bolt.
   </p>
<p>
    Fuck.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t know how long she stood there, replaying those words in her head, her thoughts circling relentlessly. The realization had planted itself firmly in her chest, and she couldn’t shake it.
   </p>
<p>
    Suddenly, her phone vibrated in her hand, jolting her back to the present. She glanced down at the screen, letting out a huff as she rolled her eyes. Without hesitation, she answered, already heading for the door to leave Rio’s office.
   </p>
<p>
    “Jen, I am not in the mood—”
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha.”
   </p>
<p>
    The way Jen said her name stopped Agatha dead in her tracks. There was something in her tone—something urgent, something wrong.
   </p>
<p>
    “What?” she demanded, her voice sharp, but it carried the faintest tremor.
   </p>
<p>
    Silence followed, stretching far too long, and then Agatha heard it—the unmistakable sound of sirens wailing in the background.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck—Agatha,” Jen’s voice was tight, panicked, unlike anything Agatha had ever heard from her. “You need to get to Mount Sinai. Now. ”
   </p>
<p>
    The sirens grew louder, piercing through the static of Agatha’s mind.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s Rio.”
   </p>
<p>
    And Agatha— she forgot how to breathe.

   Chooo...chooo...all aboard the angst train. Hopefully this one will be a round trip back??
  </p>
<p>
   I have been sitting on Mrs. Hart being HR since like chapter 5 and I have been WAITING for this moment. Freaking
        loved writing her into the story. I could like picture her voice and smile during her exchange with Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Also, as a writer this just was so good to me. For Agatha to literally to question love, and think "Was she going
        to lose her ability to fucking breathe without Rio?" like it was impossible to even think of, that Rio did have
        that power over her.
  </p>
<p>
   Only for the last line to be: And Agatha—she forgot how to breathe.
  </p>
<p>
   Because she might actually be without Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   It is shit like that makes me fall in love with writing.

```
Agatha burst through the emergency room doors as manic as she felt, her heels pounding against the floor as she moved with a singular focus. Her chest was tight, as her breath came out in short, ragged bursts, her eyes darting around the crowded room.
   </p>
<p>
    Ignoring the line of people waiting at the front desk, she pushed past them with zero fucks given, slamming her palms onto the desk with enough force to make the nearby pens rattle.
   </p>
<p>
    “Where is Rio Vidal?” she demanded, her voice sharp, carrying the full weight of her panic.
   </p>
<p>
    The emergency nurse behind the desk—clearly a veteran at dealing with chaotic and frenzied people—didn’t so much as blink. She just looked up at Agatha with a raised brow.
   </p>
<p>
    “Ma’am, you’ll need to get to the back of the line,” she said exasperated.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s rage boiled over instantly.
   </p>
<p>
    “If you don’t tell me where she is right now, ” she hissed, her voice dropping dangerously low, “I will sue this fucking hospital until I own it—and when I do, you’ll be the first person I fire!”
   </p>
<p>
    The nurse’s brow twitched, the only sign she’d been affected, but her calm demeanor held.
   </p>
<p>
    “Ma’am,” she said, her tone firm, “I need you to take a breath and—”
   </p>
<p>
    “Don’t tell me to breathe, ” Agatha snapped as she leaned closer, her entire body practically vibrating. “Rio Vidal. Where. Is. She ?”
   </p>
<p>
    Before the nurse could respond, another voice cut through the air.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha!”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha whipped around, her heart seizing in her chest as she locked eyes with Jen.
   </p>
<p>
    She was standing about ten feet away, her usual polished appearance still intact but the tan coat she was wearing told a completely different story.
   </p>
<p>
    Even from this distance, Agatha could see it, the dark, unmistakable splatters of blood staining the fabric.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha's breath caught, a sharp gasp sticking in her throat—and for a moment, her entire world tilted.
   </p>
<p>
    “Jen,” Agatha choked out, her voice barely audible. She moved to step forward, but her knees buckled, her legs giving out beneath her as the weight of everything crashed down all at once.
   </p>
<p>
    The ground rushed toward her, fast and unforgiving—but before she could hit it, arms caught her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Whoa, Agatha,” Jen’s voice was sharp but steady, her grip firm as she pulled Agatha upright. “I’ve got you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha clung to her as the world spun and her chest heaved. Her eyes locked on the bloodstains on Jen’s coat, so vivid and stark against the light fabric, and her stomach twisted violently. Her hands tightened on Jen’s arms, her knuckles turning white as she fought to pull herself together but the panic clawing at her chest wouldn’t let go.
   </p>
<p>
    “Blood,” Agatha managed to gasp out, her gaze still locked on the stains as her voice trembled. “Is that... is that Rio’s?”
   </p>
<p>
    Jen hesitated, the pause just long enough for Agatha to catch it—and
    <em>
     fuck
    </em>
    it felt like someone punched her in the chest.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” Jen finally admitted softly.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a ragged breath, her chest heaving as tears blurred her vision. One hand flew to her chest, clutching at her heart feeling like it was breaking—
    <em>
     shattering
    </em>
    into pieces inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Jen...” she cried out, the sound raw and pleading. Her knees buckled again, like her body was folding at the sheer weight of
    <em>
     everything
    </em>
    dragging her down.
   </p>
<p>
    “Shit,” Jen cursed under her breath, moving quickly to catch her. She gripped Agatha firmly around the middle, before steering her backward until she eased her into a chair.
   </p>
<p>
    As soon as Agatha sat down, her head dipped forward, trembling hands covering her face as though she could block out the image burned into her mind. The sight of Rio’s blood was still vivid, sharp, and
    <em>
     utterly unbearable
    </em>
    . Her body trembled as adrenaline and fear coursed through her veins.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Jen said softly but insistent. She crouched in front of her, reaching out to gently peel back Agatha’s hands from her face, before firmly grabbing Agatha’s face and tilting it upward so their eyes met.
   </p>
<p>
    “Look at me,” Jen urged, her grip anchoring Agatha for a moment. “Rio is alive. Do you hear me? She’s
    <em>
     alive.
    </em>
    The doctors are patching her up right now.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s tear-filled eyes locked onto Jen’s. Her breathing was still ragged,
    <em>
     but the words
    </em>
    began to cut through the fog.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Alive.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The one word reverberated in her mind.
   </p>
<p>
    “She’s alive,” Agatha repeated in a shaky whisper, as though saying it aloud would make it real.
   </p>
<p>
    "Yes, honey," Jen said, her voice impossibly gentle as she held Agatha’s face, making sure their eyes stayed locked. "She’s alive."
   </p>
<p>
    Jen’s words broke something loose inside Agatha and a sob tore free from her chest, as her shoulders shook violently. The tension she’d been holding onto for dear life unleashed all at once, leaving her in an uncontrollable free fall as her emotions tore out of her.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen moved in closer wrapping her arms around Agatha and holding her tightly as the sobs tore through her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Breathe, Agatha,” she murmured softly, her voice calm and steady. “It’s okay. Let it out.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s sobs came in harsh, choking gasps as she struggled to pull herself together.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen held her steady throughout every cry, murmuring quiet reassurances.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, with a shuddering breath, Agatha pulled back, her hands quickly moving to wipe at her tear-streaked face. Her face felt raw, and hot. The embarrassment of breaking down in front of Jen clawed at her, making her skin prickle uncomfortably.
   </p>
<p>
    But as the weight of her fear began to lift, it left something else in its place—anger.
   </p>
<p>
    A burning, unrelenting
    <em>
     fury.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her chest heaved as she fixed Jen with a sharp glance.
   </p>
<p>
    “What the fuck happened?” she demanded, her words dripping with rage, her hands still trembling in her lap.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen hesitated for a fraction of a second, her jaw tightening before she quickly composed herself, straightening to a stand as she spoke.
   </p>
<p>
    “Someone tried to mug me,” she said, disbelief lacing her words. “One second, we were walking into VitaCore headquarters, and the next, this random guy comes out of nowhere and tries to grab my Prada bag. Rio stepped in, there was a scuffle, and then...”
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice faltered as her eyes flicking away for a moment as if she didn’t want to say the words, and then back to Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “Then there was a gunshot.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt the air leave her lungs as the world tilting on its axis.
   </p>
<p>
    “Wait,” she whispered, her voice trembling as she gripped the arm of the chair with white- knuckled intensity. Her vision swam for a moment, and she forced herself to focus on Jen’s face.
   </p>
<p>
    “She was shot?”
   </p>
<p>
    The words came out in a breathless—fragile whisper, as if saying them aloud would make them more real.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen nodded, jaw clenching as her own hands trembled slightly before she crossed her arms.
   </p>
<p>
    “She was shot the shoulder,” she added quickly, her voice urgent as she rushed to explain. “But it just grazed her.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha barely heard her.
   </p>
<p>
    The words
    <em>
     she was shot
    </em>
    echoing in her mind, growing louder with each repetition. Her chest heaved as she tried to breathe, the weight of the revelation pressing down on her chest like a fucking boulder, leaving her feeling somehow both hollow and filled with rage.
   </p>
<p>
    “I—” Agatha started, her voice catching as the words tangled in her throat. Nothing coherent came out.
   </p>
<p>
    It took a moment, but when she finally found her voice, fury surged forward, filling the void.
   </p>
<p>
    “Where in the hell was security?!” she raged, her voice cutting through the air like a whip. “How in the hell did this even happen?”
   </p>
<p>
    Jen flinched slightly at the outburst, her composure faltering for a fraction of a second before she steadied herself.
   </p>
<p>
    “They were there, Agatha,” Jen said, her voice calm but heavy with exhaustion. “It happened so fast. One second, it was just some guy grabbing my bag, and the next... everything spiraled.”
   </p>
<p>
    She hesitated, her eyes clouding like she was replaying the memory in her mind.
   </p>
<p>
    “They’re the only reason Rio and I are still alive,” she continued, her voice softening. “They tackled the mugger just as he was aiming at Rio. They stopped him—but not before the gun went off...”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, the words hitting her like a physical blow. Her breath caught as her body going rigid as the implications sank in. And with it, the rage flared hotter—searing through her veins.
   </p>
<p>
    “And the shooter?” Agatha asked, her voice low and cold.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen’s expression tightened and a grimace flickering across her face.
   </p>
<p>
    “He got away,” she admitted.
   </p>
<p>
    “He
    <em>
     got away
    </em>
    ?” Agatha spat, the words slicing through the air. “You’re telling me the man who shot Rio is
    <em>
     out there
    </em>
    right now?!”
   </p>
<p>
    Jen winced but tried to explain.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha, it happened so fast—”
   </p>
<p>
    “I don’t care how fast it happened!” Agatha snapped, her voice rising. “How the
    <em>
     hell
    </em>
    does someone walk away from this?!”
   </p>
<p>
    Jen held her ground as she shot Agatha a look.
   </p>
<p>
    “Security prioritized getting us to saftey, Agatha. It was chaos. By the time they secured Rio and me, he was gone.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s fingers twisted in her lap. The thought of the shooter still at large—
    <em>
     walking free—
    </em>
    it was like a knife twisting in her gut. Her breath came out in heavy puffs as she tried to focus on anything other than the blinding rage threatening to take over her.
   </p>
<p>
    “I need to see her!” Agatha demanded, her voice trembling under the weight of her barely contained emotions.
   </p>
<p>
    But as her words hung in the air, her anger suddenly ebbed, giving way to something far more deeper. Desperation crept into her tone, cracking it at the edges, and her eyes filled with fresh tears as she looked at Jen.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     I need to see her
    </em>
    ,” she repeated, the plea in her voice so quiet—
    <em>
     so vulnerable
    </em>
    , it startled even herself.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen’s eyes widened at that before softening as she looked at Agatha, then really
    <em>
     looked
    </em>
    at her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay—okay,” Jen murmured after a moment, her voice impossibly gentle. She reached out briefly and her hand squeezed Agatha’s arm. “I’ll see if I can find a doctor. I’ll be right back.”
   </p>
<p>
    She turned toward the front desk, her stride carrying her through the bustling chaos of the emergency room.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha watched her go, the panic still clawing at her chest as she waited—every second feeling like an eternity.
   </p>
<p>
    She leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees and burying her face into her hands. She took a deep, shaky breath, as the sharp scent of antiseptic flooded her senses. Her stomach twisted in revulsion, a visceral response she couldn’t suppress.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She fucking hated hospitals.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her mind reeled back to the year she had spent in one—by Nicky’s side, watching him endure round after round of chemo, the machines beeping relentlessly around him, the sterile walls a constant reminder of how close she’d come to losing him. There had been a surgery too, the hours stretching endlessly as she sat praying to a God she didn’t even believed in for him to pull through.
   </p>
<p>
    He’d come so close to dying...
    <em>
     so fucking close
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    And now, here she was again.
   </p>
<p>
    With Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Another person she loved.
   </p>
<p>
    Her breath hitched at the thought as her fingers digging into her temples as if she could block out the overwhelming weight moving from her brain to her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    Why does the world keep trying to take away the people she loves?
   </p>
<p>
    The question hit her like a hammer—
    <em>
     heavy
    </em>
    —over and over again. And then, as if summoned by her pain, another voice crept in—one that had haunted her since she was a child.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Did it ever occur to you that perhaps God is punishing you?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Evanora’s cruel words echoed in her mind, sharp and venomous, worming their way between her thoughts. Agatha shook her head violently, as if she could physically shake them loose, but they clung to her insides like a fucking leech.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha pulled at the roots of her hair, her teeth gritted as though the pressure might somehow force her out of the nightmare inside her head. Her breaths were shallow, and her chest tightened as her mind spiraled further into a place she didn’t want to be.
   </p>
<p>
    Suddenly, there was movement beside her—two people sitting down, one on either side. Then, warm hands rested gently on her back, steady and grounding.
   </p>
<p>
    Her head shot up, startled, her wide eyes darting to her right.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s gaze shifted to her left.
   </p>
<p>
    Alice.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t say a word, her throat too tight, her mind too frayed. Instead, she brought her gaze forward, staring blankly ahead. The tension in her body began to ease—just a fraction, as she let their hands rest on her back, their presence surprising but so
    <em>
     goddamn needed
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    She inhaled deeply, the steady weight of their touch anchoring her, keeping her from spiraling further as the minutes ticked by. The chaos of the hospital around her dulled, and for the first
   </p>
<p>
    time since she’d walked through those doors, Agatha felt like she could breathe—even if just barely.
   </p>
<p>
    But then, movement in the distance caught her attention.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen.
   </p>
<p>
    And walking beside her was a female doctor in a white coat, her expressions serious.
   </p>
<p>
    They were heading directly for her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s body reacted before her mind fully registered what was happening. She shot out of her seat, her knees trembling as she stood as her heart pounded wildly in her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    “Is she—” Agatha started, her voice catching before she could finish.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen raised a hand, a small gesture that managed to calm her just enough to stay rooted in place.
   </p>
<p>
    The doctor stopped in front of her, looking between Agatha and the others.
   </p>
<p>
    “Ms. Harkness?” the doctor asked, her tone calm but direct, meeting Agatha’s sharp, unblinking gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” she said quickly.
   </p>
<p>
    The doctor exhaled softly, nodding once before speaking.
   </p>
<p>
    “Ms. Vidal is a little banged up,” she began, their words steady but kind, “but she’s fine.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath hitched, her knees nearly giving out as a wave of relief crashed over her.
   </p>
<p>
    The doctor offered a small, reassuring smile before continuing.
   </p>
<p>
    “She’s asking to see you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Those words—
    <em>
     she's asking to see you
    </em>
    —sent a different kind of tremor through Agatha. She nodded quickly, her voice catching.
   </p>
<p>
    “Take me to her.”
   </p>
<p>
    The doctor nodded and gestured for Agatha to follow, stepping aside to clear the way.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha moved forward instinctively, but then paused, her eyes darting back to Jen, Alice, and Lilia. She hesitated as her insides curled, making her feel like she needed to say something
    <em>
     — anything—
    </em>
    to acknowledge their support.
   </p>
<p>
    “Go,” Lilia said gently, nodding toward her with a small encouraging smile. “We’ll be here.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha took a shaky breath, the gratitude she felt too heavy for words, and nodded back to them. Without another word, she turned and followed the doctor, her steps unsteady as they
   </p>
<p>
    entered the labyrinthine of halls of the ER.
   </p>
<p>
    The sharp scent of antiseptic was stronger here, mingling with the faint tang of something metallic that turned Agatha’s stomach. The corridors were bustling with people—nurses rushing between stations, patients groaning in pain, and the nightmare wouldn’t be complete of course without the sharp, distant cry of a child echoing through the halls.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s skin prickled at the sound, her shoulders tensing. The noise pulling at painful memories she didn’t want to resurface. She forced herself to focus on the doctor’s back, the white coat guiding her through the chaos like a lifeline.
   </p>
<p>
    “This way,” the doctor said over her shoulder, leading her around another corner. The hum of activity dimmed slightly and the hall grew quieter, more secluded.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s pulse quickened and the anticipation built with every step.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, the doctor stopped in front of a closed door and turned to her, offering a small, reassuring nod.
   </p>
<p>
    “She’s inside,” she said softly, stepping aside to give her a path to enter.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s hand hovered over the door handle for a moment, her breath hitching as her emotions swirled—relief, fear, and the overwhelming need to see Rio for herself. With a steadying breath, she turned the handle and pushed the door open.
   </p>
<p>
    The moment she stepped inside, she was met with the sharp, clipped sound of Rio’s voice, practically vibrating with frustration.
   </p>
<p>
    "I told you, I’m not letting another person touch me until I see Agatha Harkness!"
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s pacing was relentless, her steps agitated as she moved back and forth across the small recovery room. She didn’t even glance at the door, her words clearly aimed at the empty air —or the medical staff she’d presumably entered her room.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath caught as her eyes took in the sight before her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was still in her black dress pants, but now paired with a plain white T-shirt. Her hair, was pulled back into a messy ponytail. The collar of the shirt was stained with dried blood.
   </p>
<p>
    When Rio turned to pace the other way, Agatha’s gaze locked onto the torn shoulder of her white shirt, the fabric roughly cut away to accommodate the thick white bandage wrapped around her upper arm. The sight sent a sharp pang through Agatha’s chest, but it was nothing compared to the jolt of emotion that hit when her eyes traveled up to Rio’s face.
   </p>
<p>
    A jagged cut through Rio’s brow had been stitched shut with and the angry bruising around it was already darkening into deep purples and blues. The contrast against her pale skin made the injury look even worse, and Agatha’s stomach twisted painfully.
   </p>
<p>
    It didn’t matter that Rio was upright, pacing, or even shouting—because seeing Rio like this —bruised, cut, stitched back together, made Agatha’s breath hitch, the full weight of
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     everything
    </em>
    crashing down on her all over again.
   </p>
<p>
    The sharp hitch of Agatha’s breath must have been louder than she realized, because Rio froze mid-step, her head snapping toward the door.
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze landed on Agatha, wide at first, her body tensing as if bracing for something. But then, in a single heartbeat, the tension melted from her frame, her shoulders sagging slightly as relief flooded her features.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Rio said softly, the frustration and anger that had laced her earlier tone now replaced with something achingly tender. She didn’t move right away, as if the sight of Agatha in the doorway had momentarily rooted her in place.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t speak.
   </p>
<p>
    She couldn’t.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes were locked on Rio, scanning every bruise, every bandage, every speck of blood dried on her skin and shirt—and her chest tightened so painfully.
   </p>
<p>
    Neither of them spoke.
   </p>
<p>
    They just stared at each other.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, as if pulled by an invisible thread, they both moved at the same time. Agatha stepped forward, reaching up as her fingers threaded into Rio’s messy hair as she gripped the back of her head and pulled her forward. Her arms wrapped tightly around Rio’s frame, holding her as if letting go wasn’t an option.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio followed instinctively, her own arms circling Agatha’s waist, her fingers curling into the fabric of Agatha’s coat with a desperate sort of grip. She buried her face into the curve of Agatha’s neck, and Agatha felt the warm rush of Rio’s breath against her skin as she inhaled deeply, like she needed Agatha as much as Agatha needed her.
   </p>
<p>
    All that mattered was that Rio was here, alive—
    <em>
     breathing
    </em>
    , and most importantly, back in her arms.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha closed her eyes, her own breath hitching as she leaned into her even further. Her fingers moved gently, raking through Rio’s hair, her touch slow as if trying to calm them both.
   </p>
<p>
    She buried her face in Rio’s hair, the faint scent of forest mingling with the sterile, metallic tang of the hospital, and inhaled deeply. As if the act of breathing her in could stitch back together the parts of herself that had shattered at the thought of losing her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s fingers curled tighter into Agatha’s coat, a silent plea for her to stay close. Agatha’s hand shifted slightly, her fingertips tracing the base of Rio’s neck, her touch light but constant as she offered reassurance without words.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha held her for a few more moments, her fingers still raking gently through Rio’s hair, before she murmured softly.
   </p>
<p>
    “Let me see your face.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio exhaled a shaky breath against Agatha’s neck, the warmth of it lingering on her skin, but she pulled back, her movements slow and deliberate.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s hands moved instinctively, rising to cup Rio’s face. Her palms rested against her cheeks as her thumbs brushing lightly over the curve of Rio’s cheekbones. She tilted Rio’s head slightly with a mix of tenderness and pain etched into her expression.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s gaze lingered on the stitched cut above Rio’s brow, the dark bruising spreading out like a painful bloom around it. Her jaw tightened, muscles flexing as she fought against the wave of emotions threatening to consume her.
   </p>
<p>
    She reached up slowly, her fingers trembling slightly as they traced the edge of the bruise. Her touch was light, barely there, as she followed the jagged line of the stitches running through Rio’s brow and extending up her forehead at least an inch.
   </p>
<p>
    The sight of it sent a fresh ache through Agatha’s chest.
   </p>
<p>
    “God damn it, Rio,” she murmured, her voice trembling, the words carrying equal parts frustration and aching concern.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio let out a soft breath, warm against Agatha’s skin, and a faint smirk tugged at the corner of her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know,” she murmured, her voice low and teasing. “I’m turning into one giant lesbian cliché.”
   </p>
<p>
    She tilted her head slightly, the smirk widening as a playful glint lit her tired eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    “My eyebrow hair probably won’t grow back normal and people are definitely going to think I gave myself an eyebrow slit on purpose.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s jaw tightened, her grip on Rio’s face firming but still being careful.
   </p>
<p>
    “Don’t make jokes right now,” she said, her voice tense, the words edged.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk faltered, fading entirely as she stared at Agatha. The teasing light in her eyes dimmed, replaced by something softer—more serious. She held Agatha’s gaze for a long moment, no doubt, taking in every deepened line etched into Agatha’s face since the moment she heard Rio was hurt.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, she nodded.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay,” she murmured, her voice steady but subdued, the weight of the moment settling between them again.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio reached up slowly, her hands gentle as they cupped Agatha’s face. She leaned in, closing the small distance between them until their foreheads touched.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a shaky breath, their exhales mingling in the small space between them.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Agatha
    </em>
    ,” Rio murmured, her voice trembling in a way Agatha had never heard before.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart clenched at the sound.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yeah?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio closed her eyes, her fingers curling around the back of Agatha’s neck, stroking the skin there.
   </p>
<p>
    “I want to go home,” she said, her voice breaking ever so slightly. “Please take me home.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, the lump in her throat threatening to choke her, and she nodded against Rio’s forehead.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay, my love,” she whispered, her voice filled with a love that she couldn’t contain—not anymore. “Let’s go home.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha twisted the door handle and stepped into the familiar embrace of her home. The soft quiet of the house washed over her—such a stark contrast to the chaos of the hospital. She turned, holding the door open for Rio, who walked slowly behind her.
   </p>
<p>
    It had taken
    <em>
     hours
    </em>
    to get discharged, the entire ordeal a marathon of paperwork and negotiation. The combined influence of all four partners had been the only thing that made it happen.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia had pulled strings with the hospital’s leadership.
   </p>
<p>
    Alice, wielding her former experience as a prosecuting attorney, had managed to delay the police interview until tomorrow.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen, ever the coordinator, had handled the rest with precision.
   </p>
<p>
    And Agatha?
   </p>
<p>
    She had done something rare for her—she let them take over. She’d sat silently, letting them handle the logistics, trusting them to take care of everything she couldn’t, but most importantly, trusting them to take care of
    <em>
     Rio.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    And now, finally, they were home.
   </p>
<p>
    The late hour draped the house in a heavy darkness and stillness. Nicky was already asleep, no doubt, disappointed that Agatha hadn’t been home in time to tuck him in. Agatha had resolved herself she’d find a way to explain everything to him tomorrow, to tell him about Rio’s injuries without scaring him.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t like lying to him—it wasn’t how she parented—but the instinct to protect him far outweighed the weight of a little lie.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stepped aside, her eyes fixed on Rio as she shuffled into the house, her movements careful and slow. Once Rio was inside, Agatha quietly shut the door behind her as the soft click of the lock echoed in the stillness.
   </p>
<p>
    They walked down the hallway together in silence, the weight of the day settling into the quiet between them. Agatha toed off her shoes with practiced ease, setting them neatly to the side. Rio hesitated for a moment before bending over to do the same, but Agatha’s hand landed firmly on her shoulder, stopping her mid-motion.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha gave Rio a pointed look before crouching down to handle it herself.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Rio sighed. “I can take off my own shoes.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s narrowed eyes shot up at her.
   </p>
<p>
    “You have a concussion,” she said, her voice low but firm—the tone leaving no room for argument.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio opened her mouth to respond, but the look Agatha gave her cut her off before a single word escaped. Instead, she sighed again, this time softer, and let her shoulders relax slightly, as Agatha took off one shoe, and then the other. Setting them aside right next to her heels before standing.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha reached forward, her hand slipping into Rio’s, and gently guided her through the house. She felt the faint hesitation in Rio’s steps as they passed the guest room door but Agatha didn’t stop—she gave a light, insistent pull, leading her past it and toward her own room.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha?” Rio murmured, her tone questioning.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t respond right away. She kept walking, pulling Rio into her bedroom and stopping by the edge of the bed. Without a word, she pressed a hand to Rio’s shoulder, coaxing her to sit.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio sank down with a faint frown, watching Agatha as she turned and moved back to the door.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha quietly shut it, the soft click sounding louder in the stillness. She rested her hand on the handle for a moment, her back to Rio before finally speaking.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re sleeping in here tonight,” she said, her voice firm but low, still not turning around.
   </p>
<p>
    Silence hung heavy behind her.
   </p>
<p>
    “What about Nicky?” Rio asked.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed, finally turning to face her. Her eyes met Rio’s before flickering up to the stitches on Rio’s head, and her breath caught at the flood of emotions rising in her chest. Her voice wavered, but she didn’t look away.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio,” she said softly, her words almost a plea, “I need you to stay in here tonight—
    <em>
     with me
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, they just looked at each other.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s expression softened with understanding before slowly, she nodded, her lips curving into a faint but reassuring smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay,” she whispered, her voice gentle. Her eyes flickered toward the bathroom, and she hesitated before adding, “I’m going to go clean up first.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded, unable to trust her voice to respond.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stood up and took a small step forward, pausing to glance back at her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Do you mind grabbing me something to wear from the spare bedroom? I put all my comfy clothes in the dresser.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded again, her throat working against the lump that had formed there.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips twitched into a shaky smile. Without another word, she turned and made her way to the bathroom, closing the door softly behind her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stood still for a moment, the quiet of the room pressing down around her like a heavy blanket. Her hands fidgeted at her sides, restless and unsure, until she exhaled slowly, the tension in her chest loosening just enough for her to move.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned toward the door, her steps soft and deliberate as she made her way to the spare bedroom. The room was dim, lit only by the faint glow from the hallway. Agatha moved to the dresser.
   </p>
<p>
    It didn’t take long to find what she needed: a clean set of underwear, a pair of soft, worn shorts, and a faded gray Texas college soccer T-shirt. The name
    <em>
     Vidal
    </em>
    was printed across the back in bold letters, the number 9 below it in bright red.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s fingers lingered on the letters, the faded print rough beneath her touch. Her heart pounded, each beat echoing the thoughts swirling in her mind. This shirt—this simple, ordinary thing—was a piece of Rio’s life, a reminder of everything that made her who she was.
   </p>
<p>
    A life Agatha had almost lost today.
   </p>
<p>
    The thought was like a punch to the chest, stealing the breath from her lungs. She closed her eyes briefly, steadying herself against the surge of emotion. She didn’t want to think about how close it had been.
   </p>
<p>
    With a deep breath, she pulled her hand away and carefully folded the shirt, as though treating it gently could somehow keep Rio safe. She gathered the rest of the clothes, cradling them to her chest, and turned back toward the door.
   </p>
<p>
    The walk back to her room felt longer than it should have, the quiet of the house amplifying the sound of her own footsteps. When she reached her room, she pushed the door open and stepped inside, and then closed it behind her.
   </p>
<p>
    The faint sound of running water from the bathroom filled the room, a soft, steady hum that broke the silence but did little to ease the heaviness pressing down on Agatha. She set the clothes on the edge of the bed and sat down next to them, her elbows resting on her knees as she stared at her hands.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes drifted to the hospital bag on the floor.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s clothes.
   </p>
<p>
    Without thinking, she reached for it, her fingers curling around the handles as she picked it up.
   </p>
<p>
    Her intentions were simple—take out the clothes, toss them in the laundry, and try to create some semblance of normalcy. But as she reached inside and pulled out the first item, she froze.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s white collared shirt—the one she had worn this morning—hung limply from Agatha’s hands, its fabric now a horrifying patchwork of red. The collar was soaked in blood, a dark, dried stain that spread across the chest. The sleeve had a jagged tear, surrounded by more blood that had dried into a sickening rust color.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath hitched, and her stomach twisted violently at the sight. The sheer amount of blood sent a wave of nausea crashing through her.
   </p>
<p>
    She couldn’t move, her hands trembling as they clutched the shirt. Her eyes stayed locked on the bloodstains, her mind replaying the same haunting images she hadn’t even seen but couldn’t stop imagining.
   </p>
<p>
    The chaos.
   </p>
<p>
    The gunshot.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio crying out in pain.
   </p>
<p>
    Her throat tightened, and before she could even register it, tears began to blur her vision.
   </p>
<p>
    Still, she didn’t move.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She couldn’t.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The tears spilled over, warm and unchecked, trailing silently down her cheeks.
   </p>
<p>
    Even then, she didn’t lift a hand to wipe them away.
   </p>
<p>
    All she could do was watch helplessly as her tears fell, landing softly on the bloodstained fabric. Tiny droplets seeped into the dark crimson already there, merging into the dried blood. The sight of her tears mixing with Rio’s blood felt like an invisible hand tightening around her heart—squeezing until it was felt like it was going to burst.
   </p>
<p>
    The sound of the bathroom door opening broke through the fog in her mind, pulling her attention back. She blinked rapidly, the tears still falling, and looked up to see Rio standing in the doorway.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stood there wrapped in a towel, her eyes locking on Agatha instantly. They widened as they took in the tears streaming down Agatha’s face, the anguish etched into every line of her posture. Then Rio’s gaze shifted, landing on the bloodstained shirt clenched tightly in Agatha’s trembling hands.
   </p>
<p>
    Her jaw tightened, her expression hardening for a brief moment before softening.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Rio murmured, her voice gentle, but Agatha couldn’t look at her. Her gaze fell back to the shirt, her knuckles white around the fabric and her breath unsteady.
   </p>
<p>
    Soft footsteps sounded, and then Rio was crouched in front of her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha barely registered it until Rio’s warm hands covered hers, gently prying at her fingers, until Agatha let go of the shirt, letting it fall the ground as Rio intertwined their hands together.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hey,” Rio said, her tone soothing as she squeezed Agatha's hand, “look at me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha reluctantly lifted her eyes to meet Rio’s.
   </p>
<p>
    The emotion in Rio’s dark brown eyes struck her like a blow—concern, tenderness, and something so deeply reassuring that it made Agatha's tears fall harder. Agatha’s chest tightened painfully, and she opened her mouth to speak, but the words caught on a sob.
   </p>
<p>
    She swallowed hard, forcing herself to push through the knot in her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    “I almost lost you,” Agatha whispered, her voice breaking on the words, so quiet they barely made it past her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s expression softened further, and her grip on Agatha’s hands tightened just slightly
   </p>
<p>
    “But you didn’t,” Rio said gently, her voice firm and steady, a lifeline in the storm Agatha was drowning in. “I’m here, Agatha. I’m right here.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio untangled their hands, reaching up to cup Agatha’s face, her thumbs brushing away the tears with a tenderness that nearly broke her all over again.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hey,” Rio murmured, her tone unbelievably soft, wrapping around Agatha like a balm. “Let’s get dressed and go to bed, huh? You can hold me all night. How’s that sound?”
   </p>
<p>
    More tears spilled down Agatha’s cheeks at those words, and she let out a shaky breath, her heart clenching painfully.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     God.
    </em>
<em>
     That’s all she wanted.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Okay,” she whispered, her voice so small she almost didn’t recognize it, and she hated it— hated how raw and vulnerable she sounded. She followed it with a shaky nod, trying to regain some semblance of control.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio gave her a soft, reassuring smile, her hands lingering for a moment to swipe away the last few tears before she rose to her feet.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha wiped at the tears Rio hadn’t caught, letting out a slow breath as she forced herself to stand. Her movements felt mechanical as her legs carried her almost numbly to the bathroom. She moved through her nighttime routine, skipping the non-essentials, her mind too clouded to focus on anything more.
   </p>
<p>
    When she finally stepped back into the bedroom, her breath caught for a moment. The hospital bag and the bloodstained shirt were gone, and for a fleeting moment she wondered what Rio did with them but it vanished just as quickly.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was already in bed, nestled under the covers, waiting for her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha crossed the room in silence, her steps soft but purposeful. She slipped into the bed beside Rio without a word.
   </p>
<p>
    The moment her head hit the pillow Agatha reached for Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio shifted closer without hesitation, nestling against her as if it was the most natural thing in the world.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s arms wrapped around her tightly, pulling her in as though holding her any looser might risk losing her altogether.
   </p>
<p>
    “See?” Rio murmured softly. “You’ve got me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s grip tightened instinctively, her chest constricting as fresh tears welled in her eyes. She buried her face against the back of Rio’s neck, her breath hitching as she inhaled deeply.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yeah,” Agatha whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “I do.”
   </p>
<p>
    They lay in silence, and Agatha could feel the gentle rise and fall of Rio’s chest against her own.
   </p>
<p>
    It was everything she needed and yet it made the ache in her chest deepen.
   </p>
<p>
    The words hovered in Agatha’s mind, unspoken but insistent.
   </p>
<p>
    I love you.
   </p>
<p>
    She tightened her hold around Rio, the thought growing louder with every heartbeat.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yeah?” Rio murmured back her voice soft but drowsy.
   </p>
<p>
    “I—” Agatha began, her breath hitching, but the words caught in her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    Just say it.
   </p>
<p>
    Say I love you.
   </p>
<p>
    You almost lost her today.
   </p>
<p>
    Say it.
   </p>
<p>
    “I—” she tried again, her voice faltering as the words refused to come.
   </p>
<p>
    Before she could spiral any further, Rio’s hand reached down, brushing against Agatha’s. Rio grabbed the hand wrapped around her middle and intertwined their fingers, holding on tightly.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know you do,” Rio whispered.
   </p>
<p>
    Silence stretched between them again.
   </p>
<p>
    “Go to sleep, baby,” Rio murmured, her words gentle and reassuring.
   </p>
<p>
    And with that, Agatha exhaled a shaky breath, her eyes fluttering shut as she held Rio closer. The weight of the day didn’t ease, but she let herself drift off with Rio safe in her arms.

    Chapter Notes
    <p>
     Thanks for being patient with me. The holiday was crazy, and I had no time to write. So here is a nearly 10,000 word chapter to make up for the wait. Also...peep the additional chapter I had to add. So we are up to 31. I know you guys want me to go beyond 31 but I am starting to lose gas. This chapter was already so hard to write, and I am feeling like I need to take a break from writing soon lol I will of course, finish this story but I am sticking with the gameplan and outline I already have. So 31...maybe 32 if I can't get the plot moving between now and then end.
    </p>
<p>
     As always, I appreciate your guys.

    Agatha’s internal alarm honed by years of early mornings stirred her awake. She blinked against the soft morning
        light filtering through the gap in the curtains, her mind still hazy with the edges of sleep. She shifted
        slightly moving to sit up but suddenly realized she couldn’t move.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes shot open, and she looked down.
   </p>
<p>
    Two heads of dark hair were curled into her—one on each side.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio lay on her left, her long hair slightly mussed from sleep with her ear pressed against Agatha’s heart.
   </p>
<p>
    On her right, Nicky was tucked in close, his smaller body curled into her side with his short hair sticking up in
        all directions like it always did when he slept.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her chest tightening. It took her a long moment to process what she was seeing —what she was
        feeling—as her heart began to swell with something achingly warm.
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze flickering between them, and it hit her all at once.
   </p>
<p>
    Their hair.
   </p>
<p>
    She had never noticed it before—how similar the shades were. The deep, dark tones that mirrored one another so
        perfectly made her breath hitch.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her hand resting wrapping around Rio’s back, her other hand brushing through Nicky’s hair.
        She could feel the steady rhythm of their breathing, the soft rise and fall of their chests against her.
   </p>
<p>
    This.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes stinging with unshed tears.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     This is what whole feels like.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The thought had Agatha’s fingers trailing lightly over Rio’s back and Rio stirred slightly, nuzzling closer to
        her chest. On her other side, triggered by Rio stirring—Nicky let out a soft sigh in his sleep, his tiny hand
        curling into the fabric of Agatha's night shirt.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha closed her eyes briefly.
   </p>
<p>
    The fear, the exhaustion, the chaos of the day before—all of it faded away in the face of this simple, quiet
        moment.
   </p>
<p>
    And for the first time in a long time, Agatha didn’t feel the need to move or rush out of the bed and conquer the
        day.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t want to break the spell.
   </p>
<p>
    So, she just stayed there holding them both, letting herself savor the feeling of holding the little boy she
        loved most in this world, and the woman she was starting to love with just as much ferocity.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let nearly ten minutes pass, savoring every second before the reality began to creep back in. It was a
        school day and while Rio wasn’t going to work and Agatha had arranged with the other partners to work from
        home—Nicky still needed to stick to his routine. Any deviation from that routine was a surefire recipe for a
        meltdown, something Agatha was well aware of and hoping to avoid at any cost.
   </p>
<p>
    And, as much as she hated to admit it, she needed to pee.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Badly.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Carefully, she began the delicate process of detangling herself from them both. Nicky grumbled first, a soft,
        sleepy noise that made Agatha’s lips twitch into a smile. Rio followed a second later, her own sleepy mumble
        warm and unintelligible.
   </p>
<p>
    It took a few minutes, but Agatha finally managed to extract herself without fully waking either of them. She
        moved to the end of the bed, before standing. Looking back her breath caught in her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio and Nicky were still asleep with an Agatha-shaped gap between them. The sight from this perspective had her
        stomach flipping and her heart fluttering wildly at the image. It was so simple, so perfect, and yet it left her
        feeling raw and exposed.
   </p>
<p>
    With a soft sigh, Agatha slipped into the bathroom and relieved herself. As she washed her hands, she caught her
        reflection in the mirror and paused.
   </p>
<p>
    How was she going to navigate this?
   </p>
<p>
    Waking Nicky without disturbing Rio wasn’t impossible, but that wasn’t what had her stomach twisting.
   </p>
<p>
    It was the collision of her worlds—Rio, her—what?
   </p>
<p>
    Girlfriend?
   </p>
<p>
    Lover?
   </p>
<p>
    And Nicky, her son.
   </p>
<p>
    Two people who held such enormous parts of her heart, who until now had existed in their own spaces.
   </p>
<p>
    But this morning, they’d both been there—
    <em>
     together.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The image of them sleeping on either side of her resurfaced in her mind, her chest constricting with something so
        tender it almost hurt. Yet, the complications of it all loomed. Rio was so new to her Nicky’s life, and while he
        had already taken to her in ways that surprised Agatha, this was still uncharted territory.
   </p>
<p>
    Would Rio be okay with Nicky climbing into bed like that?
   </p>
<p>
    Would she feel overwhelmed?
   </p>
<p>
    Or worse, suffocated by the instant intimacy of family life?
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shook her head, trying to push the thoughts away.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio had made her intentions clear—she wanted this, wanted her and she knew that Nicky was part of that package.
        But that didn’t make it any less terrifying to let these two worlds blend so seamlessly.
   </p>
<p>
    Taking a steadying breath, Agatha stepped out of the bathroom and back into the bedroom but she stopped short in
        the doorway, her breath catching in her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    At some point while she’d been gone, Nicky had moved across the bed and curled into Rio’s side. His small body
        was tucked against her with his head nestled beneath her chin like it was the most natural place in the world
        for him to be.
   </p>
<p>
    And Rio, still deeply asleep, had instinctively draped an arm over him, her hand resting lightly against his
        back, holding him close.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stared, her chest tightening as warmth flooded through her. The sight was so unexpectedly tender that it
        rendered her momentarily speechless.
   </p>
<p>
    She took a step closer, moving slowly as if afraid to disrupt the scene in front of her. Her eyes roamed over
        them and her heart twisted at how peaceful they both looked. Nicky’s little face was relaxed in a way that only
        happened when he felt completely safe, and Rio’s features, softened by sleep, looked just as content.
   </p>
<p>
    The sheer rightness of it all nearly undid her.
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze lingered on them, and for a fleeting moment she let herself imagine a life where this wasn’t an
        exception but ordinary—a life where mornings like this were the norm—where this was just a part of their
        everyday life.
   </p>
<p>
    The thought terrified and thrilled her in equal measure.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky shifted, grumbling softly in his sleep as he nestled closer into Rio’s side. His small head bumped against
        her chin, the light jolt rousing her from sleep.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, watching as Rio stirred, taking a deep breath as her eyes fluttered open. She blinked a few times,
        her gaze unfocused, as if trying to make sense of where she was. Then her eyes flicked around the room until
        they landed on the small figure curled into her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    Her body tensed briefly in surprise, her eyes going wide as she realized it was Nicky.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha held her breath, waiting to see what Rio would do.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, the tension in Rio’s shoulders eased. The surprise melted away, replaced by an expression so soft it
        made Agatha’s chest ache.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s gaze lingered on Nicky with a tenderness that seemed to fill the entire room. Her hand moved slowly,
        brushing a lock of his messy hair back from his forehead, her touch gentle.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky let out a small sigh at her touch, his body relaxing further into her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t move, her feet rooted to the spot. She hadn’t expected this, hadn’t anticipated how seeing them
        together would feel. Her world—two pieces she’d kept so carefully separate —had collided in the most beautiful
        way.
   </p>
<p>
    And somehow, it didn’t feel chaotic.
   </p>
<p>
    It felt complete.
   </p>
<p>
    Almost as if sensing Agatha’s gaze, Rio looked up and when her eyes locked onto Agatha’s they widened slightly,
        like she’d been caught.
   </p>
<p>
    The silence between them was heavy, stretching for what felt like forever. Neither of them moved, their eyes
        locked as if the world around them stopped to give them this moment.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, Agatha stepped forward. She walked around the bed, slipping in on the other side, careful not to disturb
        Nicky. She positioned herself against his back, her head propped on her arm as she settled in, her eyes still
        fixed on Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t look away, her expression open but tentative, as if she were afraid she was overstepping.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky remained nestled into Rio’s side, blissfully unaware of the emotions filling the room.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio finally broke the staring match, her eyes flicking down to Nicky, curled against her, before returning to
        Agatha’s. She swallowed, her throat working as she finally whispered.
   </p>
<p>
    “You okay with this?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stayed quiet for a moment, her eyes still lingering on the two of them—the way Rio held her son, the way
        it looked so natural—like they belonged together.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, Agatha spoke, her voice soft but steady.
   </p>
<p>
    “I was about to ask you the same thing.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio blinked, her lips parting slightly in surprise.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, she didn’t respond, her gaze dropped back down to Nicky, still curled against her, his small body
        tucked securely under her arm. Her hand rested gently on his back, her fingers barely moving. When she looked
        back at Agatha, her eyes were softer, more thoughtful, as if she were carefully weighing her words.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m okay with it,” Rio said after a moment, her voice a little unsteady but sure. “Are you?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t answer right away. Instead, she reached out, her fingers threading gently through Nicky’s messy
        hair, smoothing it back with slow, deliberate strokes. His quiet, rhythmic breathing filled the space, steady
        and soothing in a way that anchored her.
   </p>
<p>
    Her hand lingered there, resting lightly, as she turned the question over in her mind. Was she okay with this? It
        seemed like such a simple thing—Nicky curled up against Rio like it was the most natural thing in the world—but
        the reality was anything but simple.
   </p>
<p>
    “I think so,” she said finally.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio tilted her head and really looked at Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “You think so?” she echoed gently, her tone carrying no judgment.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed, letting her hand slip from Nicky’s hair to rest on the bed.
   </p>
<p>
    “This,” she said, gesturing faintly toward the two of them, “this wasn’t something I expected. Seeing the two of
        you together...like this...it’s—”
   </p>
<p>
    She hesitated, the words catching in her throat as she tried to put her feelings into something coherent.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s a lot,” Rio finished for her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded, a small, wry smile tugging at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s a lot,” she agreed. “But not in a bad way. It’s just... unexpected.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio looked down at Nicky at Agatha’s words.
   </p>
<p>
    “I get that,” she said, her voice quiet and thoughtful. “I never thought this was something I even wanted.” Her
        eyes were locked on Nicky, her expression softening further. “But it feels right. Doesn’t it?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s chest tightened as she watched Rio look at Nicky with so much care, the same tenderness she’d seen in
        those dark eyes when they were focused on her. The weight of the moment pressed against her, but instead of
        overwhelming her, it steadied her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed, as she reached out tucked a strand of Rio’s unruly bed head behind her ear, fingers lingering
        on her cheek.
   </p>
<p>
    “It does,” she murmured, thumb stroking Rio’s cheek. “It really does.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s shoulders softened at Agatha’s words, the tension she’d been carrying visibly melting away. She leaned into
        Agatha’s touch, her hesitant smile shifting into something more genuine, more at ease.
   </p>
<p>
    They laid there in silence, their eyes meeting across the small space, with Nicky nestled soundly between them.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt as if the room was steeped in a rare and precious stillness, the kind that made everything else fade
        away. And for a moment, it felt like the world had paused just for them.
   </p>
<p>
    But eventually, reality intruded, as it always did because the world hadn’t stopped turning, no matter how much
        it felt like it had.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a heavy sigh.
   </p>
<p>
    “I have to get him up for school,” she said, reluctant to disturb the peace.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio nodded at that, but Agatha caught the slight downturn of her smile as if she didn’t want the moment to end
        either.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned forward, carefully slipping her arms under Nicky’s small body and lifting him. Slowly, she
        detangled him from Rio without waking him fully, cradling him close to her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky stirred, mumbling something incoherent, but he snuggled closer into her, his cheek pressed against her
        shoulder. Agatha shimmied to the other side of the bed and stood, adjusting his weight in her arms.
   </p>
<p>
    He was getting bigger—
    <em>
     too big
    </em>
    to carry like this for much longer. But as she looked down at him, his
        face relaxed in sleep, she felt a pang in her chest. She thought of how small he used to be, how easily she’d
        carried him everywhere. That ache she knew too well threatened to rise, but she pushed it down. She would carry
        him for as long as she could, until the day she physically couldn’t.
   </p>
<p>
    For a fleeting moment, the thought crossed her mind—of having another. Maybe a little girl with dark hair and
        deep brown eyes. The idea sent an unexpected warmth through her chest, her heart flipping with a longing she
        hadn’t anticipated.
   </p>
<p>
    But the sound of movement behind her broke through that dangerous line of thinking.
   </p>
<p>
    She glanced back, catching Rio shifting, her body language making it clear she was about to attempt to get out of
        bed.
   </p>
<p>
    “Where do you think you’re going?” Agatha asked her voice still low enough not to startle Nicky but sharp enough
        to stop Rio in her tracks.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio froze, then looked up at her, attempting to raise an eyebrow, only to wince slightly as the stitches on her
        brow pulled. She touched them briefly, then gave Agatha a knowing look.
   </p>
<p>
    “I was going to make him breakfast,” she said casually, as though her idea wasn’t completely absurd.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha huffed, shaking her head as she shot Rio a glare.
   </p>
<p>
    “Absolutely not,” she said firmly. “You are not getting out of this bed today. You will stay horizontal—all day.
    <em>
     Do you hear me
    </em>
    ?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips twitched with a faint smile as she leaned back into the pillows, hands raised in mock surrender.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, ma’am,” she murmured.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha held Rio’s gaze for a moment longer, her stern look softening before she turned her attention back to
        Nicky. Gently, she adjusted him in her arms and carried him out to the living room, settling him onto the couch.
        His small body laid against the cushions, and she reached out to smooth his hair back, her voice quiet and
        soothing.
   </p>
<p>
    “Honey, it’s time to wake up for school,” she murmured.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky stirred slightly, grumbling under his breath as he shifted. Agatha smiled faintly, rubbing his back in slow
        circles until his eyes began to flutter open.
   </p>
<p>
    She watched him closely as his blue eyes adjusted to the light, scanning the room before landing on her. The
        sight of him, eyes still hazy with sleep made her heart ache in the best way.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mama,” he croaked softly, his voice still heavy from sleep.
   </p>
<p>
    “Good morning, baby,” she whispered, brushing his messy hair back from his forehead.
   </p>
<p>
    He blinked up at her, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his small hands before his gaze settled on her,
        curious and a little worried.
   </p>
<p>
    “Where’s Rio? Why didn’t you come home last night?” he asked, his voice tinged with worry and with a hint of
        blame.
   </p>
<p>
    The question sent a warmth through her chest, but it was shadowed by unease. She hated lying to him—always
        had—but the full truth was far too harsh for his little world. Her hand
   </p>
<p>
    smoothed over his back again as she carefully chose her words.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m sorry I wasn’t home last night,” she said softly, meeting his gaze. “Rio tripped and fell at work and had to
        go to the hospital.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky’s eyes went wide.
   </p>
<p>
    “But she’s home,” he said quickly, his words tumbling out as he sat up. “She was in bed with you. I saw her. She
        held me—I felt it.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath caught, her chest tightening at his words.
   </p>
<p>
    Of course, he had noticed.
   </p>
<p>
    Of course, he had felt Rio’s arms around him.
   </p>
<p>
    He always picked up on everything.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, honey” she said gently, keeping her voice steady despite the lump in her throat. “She’s home now, but she
        hit her head and needs to stay in bed today to rest.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky frowned, his small brow creasing as his gaze flickered toward the open bedroom door down the hallway, then
        back to Agatha. His voice was quieter when he spoke again.
   </p>
<p>
    “Can I go see her and tell her I hope she feels better?” he asked, his earnestness shining through.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt her heart warm by the sheer kindness in his words. No matter how many times he surprised her with his
        thoughtful nature, it never failed to leave her in awe.
   </p>
<p>
    “Let’s get ready first,” she said, deciding to give him a little incentive to power through the morning routine.
        “Eat, get dressed, brush your teeth—and then you can see Rio. Deal?”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky scrunched his nose at her words, his lips pursing as his eyes darted back toward the hallway. She could
        almost see the wheels turning in his head as he weighed his options, his expression so serious for such a small
        boy. Finally, he looked back at her and gave a decisive nod.
   </p>
<p>
    “Deal,” he said.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha narrowed her eyes slightly, watching him closely.
   </p>
<p>
    That was too easy.
   </p>
<p>
    Her instincts prickled, but she chose not to call him out just yet, opting instead to pat his back gently.
   </p>
<p>
    “Good,” she said with a small smile. “Let’s get moving.”
   </p>
<p>
    Even as she spoke, though, she made a mental note to stay one step ahead.
   </p>
<p>
    He was her son after all.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky managed to get dressed in record time, his uniform neat enough to pass inspection without much fuss.
        Agatha, meanwhile, busied herself in the kitchen, though her focus was split between the coffee pot sputtering
        to life and a piece of toast she was determined not to burn—
    <em>
     again
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    The first attempt had been a disaster, the smell of burnt bread still faintly lingering in the air despite her
        efforts to air it out. She grumbled under her breath as she plated the second round, this time only slightly
        burnt alongside a simple bowl of cornflakes. With a satisfied nod, she poured herself a mug of coffee, setting
        it on the counter just as Nicky padded into the kitchen.
   </p>
<p>
    He climbed onto the stool at the kitchen island before looking down at the plate in front of him. He sniffed
        once, his little nose wrinkling slightly, and then shot Agatha a pointed look— a look that plainly said,
    <em>
     I
            know you burnt the first toast. I can smell it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha caught his expression and arched a brow, her own look saying just as clearly,
    <em>
     Don’t push it. Just
            eat.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It was a routine they had perfected over time, one that needed no words. Nicky held her gaze for a moment longer
        before shrugging and picking up the slice of toast. He took a bite, his face carefully neutral as if judging
        whether it was worth commenting on.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha, meanwhile, sipped her coffee, a small smirk tugging at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Maybe—
    <em>
     just maybe
    </em>
    —she could make it through the morning unscathed. She pushed the toaster down again,
        to make Rio some toast as well.
   </p>
<p>
    “So, is Rio your girlfriend now since she’s sleeping in your bed?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha choked on her coffee. The hot liquid burned down the wrong pipe, and she sputtered, hitting her chest as
        she coughed, her eyes watering.
   </p>
<p>
    When she finally managed to catch her breath, Agatha set her mug down with a loud thud, wiping at her mouth with
        the back of her hand.
   </p>
<p>
    “Nicky!” she rasped, her voice half incredulous, half wheezing.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky watched her calmly, chewing his toast as though he hadn’t just almost killed her.
   </p>
<p>
    She opened her mouth, then shut it, her brain scrambling for a way to handle this line of questioning.
   </p>
<p>
    “She’s sleeping in my bed because she’s hurt, Nicky,” Agatha finally said, her voice measured. “And because it’s
        the most comfortable place for her to rest.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky frowned, clearly weighing her explanation.
   </p>
<p>
    “But you slept with her.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked. She knew he meant actually sleeping but the words were loaded and it caused her mind to stutter
        for a second. She stood there trying to think of a suitable response, but all she managed was a weak.
   </p>
<p>
    “She needs someone to keep an eye on her.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky wasn’t buying it. He gave her a look—an unblinking, skeptical look that seemed far too knowing for a child
        his age. They stared at each other in silence, the air between them thickening.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, Agatha sighed, setting her coffee mug down with a thud. She pushed herself away from the counter and
        stepped closer to Nicky, placing her hands firmly on the countertop in front of him. She leaned forward
        slightly, meeting his gaze directly, her heart hammering anxiously in her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    This wasn’t how she had envisioned the conversation going, but there was no way around it now. It was happening.
   </p>
<p>
    Taking a steadying breath, she squared her shoulders and spoke, her voice clear and deliberate.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” she said, nodding slowly. “Rio is my girlfriend.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words hung in the air for a moment, and Agatha braced herself for his reaction.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky’s expression didn’t change immediately, his big blue eyes locked on hers, processing what she’d just said.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, with all the innocence of a child and the precision of a fucking bullet, he asked.
   </p>
<p>
    “Do you love her?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, her stomach flipping.
   </p>
<p>
    Could this kid ever just give her a fucking inch?
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s chest tightened as she stared at her son, his earnest gaze boring into hers. It felt like the room had
        shrunk, the weight of his question pressing down on her. Her first instinct was to deflect, to steer the
        conversation away, but something in Nicky’s face stopped her.
   </p>
<p>
    He deserved honesty—he always had, and since she already lied to him once this morning, she couldn’t do it again.
   </p>
<p>
    She let out a shaky breath, her hands gripping the edge of the countertop as she steadied herself. Her voice,
        when it came, was barely above a whisper.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” she said, her eyes softening as she looked at him. “I do.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words had barely left her mouth before Agatha’s nerves got the better of her. She began pacing in front of
        the counter, her thoughts spilling out faster than she could organize them.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know it’s a lot, buddy,” she said, her tone rushed, as if she needed to get ahead of whatever reaction he
        might have.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mom,” Nicky said, his voice calm but clearly trying to get her attention.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know it’s really fast,” she continued, her words tumbling over his, interrupting him. “And I understand if
        it’s confusing or... or overwhelming.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Mom,” Nicky tried again, his voice a little louder this time.
   </p>
<p>
    “And I also know it’s
    <em>
     different
    </em>
    ,” Agatha added, pausing as she struggled to find the right words. “With
        your mom... being with another woman.”
   </p>
<p>
    She winced, the awkwardness of her phrasing making her cringe.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mom,” Nicky said again, more insistent, but Agatha barely noticed.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know it’s a lot of changes,” she pressed on, turning to face him, her hands gesturing as if to emphasize her
        sincerity. “But if you need to talk about anything—
    <em>
     anything at all
    </em>
    —I’m here to listen, okay? I want
        to make sure—”
   </p>
<p>
    “Mom!” Nicky’s voice finally cut through, louder and firmer, stopping her mid-sentence.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her hands falling to her sides, and she stared at him, her chest heaving slightly from her nervous
        ramble.
   </p>
<p>
    “What?” she asked, blinking as though only now realizing how much she’d been rambling.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky didn’t say anything at first, just gave her a look, then casually pointed behind her.
   </p>
<p>
    “The toast is burning,” he said simply.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her confusion holding her still for a beat—until the smell hit her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Shit.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She whipped around and darted to the toaster, slamming the lever up. A plume of smoke rose as two charred slices
        of bread popped up, blackened and unrecognizable.
   </p>
<p>
    “Damn it,” she muttered under her breath, grabbing a dish towel to fan away the smoke as she glared at the ruined
        toast like it had personally betrayed her.
   </p>
<p>
    Behind her, Nicky snickered, and when she turned to him, he was smirking around a bite of his slightly less-burnt
        toast.
   </p>
<p>
    “When is Rio feeling better?” he asked, his eyes sparkling with amusement.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shot him a faux-glare, wagging the burnt toast in his direction.
   </p>
<p>
    “Watch it, kid, or this is your lunch.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky giggled, his grin wide and mischievous.
   </p>
<p>
    “I don’t even take a lunch.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha tossed the charred toast into the trash and leaned back against the counter, crossing her arms as she
        looked at him, her expression softening.
   </p>
<p>
    “You sure you’re okay with all this?” she asked gently.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky popped the last bite of toast into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully as he slid off the chair. He carried his
        plate and bowl to the sink, setting them down with a clink, then turned back to her.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m okay with it,” he said, his tone light but certain.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, without hesitation, he walked over and wrapped his small arms around her waist, looking up at her with a
        smile that made her heart squeeze.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s nice.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath caught as she looked down at him, her own arms wrapping around him instinctively. She rested her
        chin lightly on the top of his head for a moment before pulling back enough to meet his gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re sure?” she asked again, searching his face.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky rolled his eyes in an exaggerated manner, shaking his head with mock exasperation.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” he said with a huff, his tone implying she was the one being ridiculous.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha narrowed her eyes at his little display of attitude, but the corners of her mouth betrayed her, twitching
        upward.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky grinned sheepishly, clearly knowing he’d won this round. He continued grinning up at her, unbothered,
        before tilting his head.
   </p>
<p>
    “Can I go see Rio now?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed, shaking her head as she ruffled his hair.
   </p>
<p>
    “Go on, but be gentle.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky didn’t need to be told twice. He was already halfway down the hall, his small feet padding quickly toward
        the bedroom. Agatha watched him go, feeling a surprising lightness settle in her chest—a small but undeniable
        relief.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned back to the counter, eyeing the toaster like it was like her personal nemesis.
   </p>
<p>
    With a quick motion, she grabbed two fresh slices of bread and slid them into the slots. Her finger hovered over
        the lever for a second before she pressed it down with a click.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes narrowed at the toaster, lips pursed.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m watching you, motherfucker,” she muttered under her breath.
   </p>
<p>
    A few minutes later, Agatha made her way down the hallway, balancing a plate with perfect —
    <em>
     not burnt
    </em>
    —toast in one hand and a mug of coffee in the other. As she approached the bedroom, the sound of Nicky’s excited
        voice floated down the hall.
   </p>
<p>
    “Did you know that flamingos are pink because of what they eat?” Nicky asked, his enthusiasm practically
        vibrating through the walls.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh yeah?” Rio replied, her voice warm. “What do they eat?”
   </p>
<p>
    “Shrimp!” Nicky declared, followed by a pause. “But not, like, the kind we eat with pasta. I think it’s tiny
        shrimp. Or maybe different shrimp? I’ll have to look it up.”
   </p>
<p>
    “The tiny shrimp are called Brine Shrimp,” answered Rio said.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes fondly, shaking her head as she continued down the hall. When she reached the bedroom
        doorway, she stopped short, hovering just outside the doorway, the plate and mug balanced in her hands.
   </p>
<p>
    She moved to enter but then Nicky’s voice had changed—softer, tinged with a sadness that tugged at her heart that
        her feet cementing in place.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio,” he said, quieter now, almost hesitant.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her ears straining as the silence stretched. She could sense the shift in the room, feel it in the
        heavy pause that followed.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yeah, buddy?” Rio finally replied, her voice gentle but cautious.
   </p>
<p>
    There was a faint rustling sound—someone shifting on the bed. Agatha imagined Nicky sitting up straighter, his
        small frame moving closer to Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    “If you’re gonna be part of this family,” Nicky began, his tone serious in a way that only a child’s honesty
        could be, “you have to be more careful. Mom... she doesn’t like it when the people she loves are hurt.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath hitched, her chest tightening as Nicky’s small voice carried through the doorway, raw and full of
        innocence. She didn’t need to see them to feel the weight of his words pressing down on the room.
   </p>
<p>
    “Dad says it makes her scared,” Nicky continued, his voice even quieter now, barely above a whisper. “Because I
        got really sick when I was three—and I almost died.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha gripped the plate and mug in her hands tightly, her knuckles whitening as a flood of emotions washed over
        her: love, fear, and a fierce, protective ache for her son. It was a part of her life she didn’t talk about
        often, even with herself.
   </p>
<p>
    But hearing Nicky say it out loud, hearing him explain her fears so simply, moved through her in ways she hadn’t
        expected.
   </p>
<p>
    The silence that followed felt like an eternity before Rio’s voice broke it, soft and steady.
   </p>
<p>
    “I didn’t know that,” Rio said gently, her voice tinged with something Agatha could only describe as shock. “That
        must’ve been so scary—for both of you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky didn’t respond right away, but Agatha could imagine him nodding.
   </p>
<p>
    “I don’t remember a lot,” he said finally. “But I remember Mom was always with me. She wouldn’t leave me.”
   </p>
<p>
    There was a pause, then he added.
   </p>
<p>
    “She loves me like that. And I think she loves you like that too.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stood frozen just outside the doorway, her breath catching as Nicky’s words reached her ears, soft but
        full of the earnestness only a child could muster.
   </p>
<p>
    “So, you have to make sure your shoes are tied,” he said, his small voice carrying an unexpected weight. “And you
        need to watch where you’re going, so you don’t fall and get hurt again.”
   </p>
<p>
    There was a pause, the kind that seemed to stretch time. Agatha could almost feel the wheels turning in his
        little head before he spoke again.
   </p>
<p>
    “We take care of Mom by taking care of ourselves,” Nicky said, his voice steady but so heartbreakingly wise for
        his age.
   </p>
<p>
    The words hit Agatha like a punch to the chest, her grip tightening on the plate and mug she held. Her knees
        threatened to buckle as she let out a shaky exhale, the lump in her throat nearly suffocating.
   </p>
<p>
    How could a five-year-old carry so much understanding?
   </p>
<p>
    So much awareness?
   </p>
<p>
    Inside the room, Rio’s voice broke the silence, soft but steady.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re a smart kid, you know that?” she said, her tone filled with affection. “And you’re absolutely right.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky hummed in acknowledgment, and Agatha could hear the rustling again.
   </p>
<p>
    “Will you promise?” he asked, and his voice was quieter now, almost shy.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t hesitate.
   </p>
<p>
    “I promise to always take care of your mom,” she said, and her voice held a quiet sincerity that caused Agatha’s
        chest to tighten further.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t take anymore and finally stepped into the room, her steps feeling heavier as she forced herself
        to move past the emotional weight threatening to anchor her to the spot. She leaned lightly against the
        doorframe, clearing her throat just enough to announce her presence.
   </p>
<p>
    Both Nicky and Rio turned to look at her. Rio was still in bed, and Nicky was sitting next to her in the middle.
        Nicky’s face broke into a wide smile, while Rio’s expression softened.
   </p>
<p>
    “Breakfast delivery,” Agatha said, lifting the plate and mug as she walked in. Her voice was steady, but her
        emotions churned just beneath the surface. “What’s going on in here?”
   </p>
<p>
    “Just making sure Rio knows the rules,” Nicky answered.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha raised an eyebrow, setting the plate and mug down on the nightstand next to Rio as she glanced between
        them.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, and what rules are those?” she feigned.
   </p>
<p>
    “That she has to tie her shoes and not fall anymore,” Nicky said, his tone so serious that Agatha couldn’t help
        the smile tugging at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha casted a look at Rio who was looking at Agatha with a bemused smile, before coming back to Nicky.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, those sound like very good rules to me,” Agatha said softly, brushing her fingers through Nicky’s hair as
        she crouched beside the bed, her voice straddling warmth and teasing. “Maybe we should get her some velcro shoes
        to make things easier for her. What do you think?”
   </p>
<p>
    She smirked as her gaze flicked to Rio, whose eyes immediately narrowed.
   </p>
<p>
    “Velcro shoes?” Rio repeated, her tone incredulous, though her lips twitched as though fighting a smile. “Do I
        look like I’m five?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha tilted her head, her smirk growing.
   </p>
<p>
    “Considering a five-year-old just gave you a lecture about responsibility,” she said giving Rio a pointed look
        that said play along, even though she could barely contain the smile on her face.
   </p>
<p>
    “Maybe it’s not a bad idea,” Agatha finished.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky’s giggle filled the room, his face lighting up as he looked between them.
   </p>
<p>
    “Velcro shoes are cool, Rio,” he chimed in enthusiastically. “They are so easy! I have some! A couple of them
        even light up.”
   </p>
<p>
    He turned to Agatha, his eyes wide with excitement.
   </p>
<p>
    “Can we order some light-up velcro shoes for Rio?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing outright. She shot a sidelong glance at Rio, who
        was watching the exchange with amusement that was now giving wake to horror.
   </p>
<p>
    “That sounds like a really good idea, sweetheart,” Agatha said, her voice perfectly serious as she carefully
        avoided Rio’s narrowed gaze. “We can check Amazon when you get back from school. Maybe even find matching pairs
        for you two.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky’s grin stretched impossibly wider as he practically bounced in place.
   </p>
<p>
    “Cool!”
   </p>
<p>
    “So, cool,” Agatha echoed, giving him a small nudge toward the door. “Now go grab your shoes and backpack.
        School’s waiting.”
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky stood up on the bed and jumped off with an excited yell before dashing out of the room as the sound of his
        little feet echoing down the hall.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let her smirk unfurl, tilting her head as she turned back to Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes came to rest on narrowed dark eyes and a tight jaw, clearly unimpressed by the exchange.
   </p>
<p>
    “I promise,” Agatha said mockingly, her tone dripping with faux sincerity, “I’ll find you a
    <em>
     really
    </em>
    stylish pair.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes narrowed even further as she stared daggers at Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Agatha
    </em>
    ,” she said, her voice low and warning.
   </p>
<p>
    The single word was laced with enough quiet menace to send a delicious shiver down Agatha’s spine. Her smirk only
        deepened as she stepped forward.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio shifted on the bed, moving to sit up straighter, her movements careful but determined.
   </p>
<p>
    “Ah, ah, ah,” Agatha tutted, her eyes narrowing in return as she placed her hand on Rio’s shoulder and putting
        gentle pressure to push her back down into the mattress
   </p>
<p>
    “Horizontal,” Agatha reminded firmly, leaning down to press a quick kiss to Rio’s lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio huffed against her mouth but returned the kiss, her annoyance melting just slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    When Agatha pulled back, Rio gave her a look that was equal parts frustration and affection as she sank back into
        the pillows.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re insufferable,” she muttered, though the faintest smirk tugged at the corner of her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha straightened, her own smirk softening as she stepped toward the doorway.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rest up. I mean it. I’ll be back in an hour.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio sighed but leaned back fully, surrendering to the inevitable. As Agatha moved to leave, Rio’s voice called
        out.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re lucky I love you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze for the briefest of moments, her heart doing a little flip before she turned back and sent Rio a
        playful wink.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know,” she said with a smirk, walking out the door with her heart feeling inexplicably lighter.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sat at her desk, her home office bathed in the golden glow of afternoon light filtering through the
        windows. Papers that Billy dropped off this morning were spread haphazardly across the surface, her desktop
        computer’s three monitors were glowing brightly, each competing for attention. Her phone buzzed incessantly next
        to her coffee cup, now cold after hours of neglect. And with no assistant to bring her a fresh cup, Agatha just
        powered through.
   </p>
<p>
    The day, which she had intended to spend quietly, had spiraled into chaos.
   </p>
<p>
    Of course, it would be the day clients decided their entire legal futures hinged on her immediate intervention.
        Despite the other partners stepping up and fielding most of the crises, there were still calls and emails that
        demanded her personal touch. Every time she thought she was done, her inbox or phone would ring with another
        urgent message.
   </p>
<p>
    Then there was the security firm.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha had spent an hour on the phone with the head of their operations, letting loose a tirade that would
        probably go down in their record books. Her voice had been cold, measured, and deadly—every word a calculated
        reminder of their monumental failure. How a mugger had gotten close enough to Rio to even pull a gun was beyond
        unacceptable. Their excuse of “
    <em>
     trying not to impede on her life
    </em>
    ” and “
    <em>
     maintaining a safe but
            distant watch
    </em>
    ” had been laughable.
   </p>
<p>
    “That’s changing now,” Agatha had snapped, her voice razor-sharp. “From now on, I want someone glued to her side.
        A shadow. Someone who doesn’t even breathe without knowing where Rio is. And if I so much as suspect you’ve let
        your guard down again, I’ll make it my personal mission to see your entire firm buried in lawsuits.”
   </p>
<p>
    The head of security had tried to assure her that changes were already being implemented, but Agatha wasn’t
        convinced. The thought that this “
    <em>
     mugging
    </em>
    ” might not have been random —that it could have been
        Vanguard making another calculated move, just like they had with Brooke Sinclair’s suicide—sent a chill down her
        spine.
   </p>
<p>
    The possibility was too real, too plausible to ignore.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha exhaled sharply, leaning back in her chair as she pressed her fingers to her temples, willing the tension
        away. The clock on her desk caught her attention, and her eyes widened slightly as she realized just how much
        time had passed. Hours had slipped away since she’d last checked on Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    To her credit, Rio had actually listened to her. She’d stayed horizontal, following Agatha’s orders without much
        protest. The last time Agatha peeked in on her, Rio had moved from the bed to the couch, bundled under a
        blanket, her attention fixed on a documentary about black holes.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha was just about to stand and check on Rio when her phone rang, the sharp tone slicing through her thoughts.
        She glanced down at the caller ID and let out a resigned sigh before picking up.
   </p>
<p>
    “Russell,” she greeted, her tone already carrying the sharp edge she reserved for her most demanding clients.
   </p>
<p>
    Russell Grossman was one of her oldest clients, a cantankerous millionaire who owned a chain of high-end real
        estate and hospitality businesses. His penchant for litigation over zoning laws, tenant disputes, and contract
        squabbles kept Agatha perpetually busy. He also had a maddening insistence on dealing only with her. If he
        weren’t such a consistent source of billable hours—and one of the firm’s most lucrative clients—Agatha would
        have happily dropped him years ago.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Russell barked on the other end, his tone grating with impatience. “I need you to deal with these
        zoning commission idiots. They’re dragging their feet, and I don’t have time for their nonsense.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but the door to her office creaked open. Her words died on her lips as she
        watched Rio stroll in, not even sparing her a glance. Instead, Rio made her way to the couch on the far end of
        the room and sprawled across it with the kind of ease that said she wasn’t going anywhere soon.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha!” Russell snapped in her ear, pulling her focus back to the phone.
   </p>
<p>
    She jumped slightly, casting a pointed glare at Rio, who looked thoroughly unbothered.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, Russell,” she said tightly, forcing her tone to remain professional. “I’m here.”
   </p>
<p>
    Russell launched into one of his signature tirades, his voice droning in her ear. Agatha barely registered his
        words as she muted the phone and turned her attention fully to Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    “What are you doing?” she asked, her voice low and sharp, her annoyance bubbling just below the surface.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio tilted her head lazily in Agatha’s direction, a smirk tugging at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m bored,” she said simply, her voice languid. She gestured to her reclined body with an exaggerated flourish.
        “And look—I’m horizontal, just like you ordered.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s glare deepened, her lips thinning into a line. She stared at her for a moment, then sighed, shaking her
        head as she unmuted her phone.
   </p>
<p>
    “Russell,” she cut in, her tone clipped as her patience rapidly wore thin. “I’ve already sent the documentation
        to their legal team, and I have a follow-up call scheduled this afternoon. We’re ahead of schedule on this.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio raised a brow at her from across the room, clearly entertained by the exchange.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shot her another look, but Rio just smirked, settling further into the couch as if daring her to react.
   </p>
<p>
    She exhaled sharply through her nose, her focus snapping back to Russell's tirade on the other end of the call.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m pulling up the document now,” she said tightly, clicking through her email and opening the zoning report his
        assistant had sent.
   </p>
<p>
    The words on the screen blurred slightly as her headache throbbed at the edges of her mind, a clear warning sign
        of her caffeine deficiency. She grumbled under her breath, reaching for her glasses and sliding them on. Leaning
        forward, she scanned the opening paragraphs, her mind automatically shifting into work mode.
   </p>
<p>
    But then, out of the corner of her eye, she caught movement from the couch. Agatha’s gaze flicked sideways, and
        there Rio was, shifting slightly, her body languidly stretching as she adjusted her position. And then those
        eyes—dark, rich, and utterly captivating—locked onto her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her throat tightening as heat surged through her.
   </p>
<p>
    She recognized
    <em>
     that look
    </em>
    instantly.
   </p>
<p>
    The smoldering heat in Rio’s gaze pinned her in place, and for a moment, the room seemed to shrink around them.
   </p>
<p>
    And then Rio’s lips curved into a slow, deliberate smirk, her eyes dropping to Agatha’s face, lingering in a way
        that made Agatha’s pulse spike.
   </p>
<p>
    “You see what those bastards are claiming?” Russell’s voice roared in her ear, jolting her out of the trance.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked rapidly, tearing her gaze from Rio and glaring at the zoning document in front of her as though it
        had personally offended her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” she replied crisply, though her voice came out slightly uneven.
   </p>
<p>
    “I see exactly what they’re claiming, Russell. Let me...” She trailed off, adjusting her glasses and trying to
        focus, but the lingering heat from Rio’s gaze made her heart thud in an infuriatingly erratic rhythm.
   </p>
<p>
    Across the room, Rio’s smirk deepened, clearly enjoying every second of Agatha’s flustered state.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, her jaw tightening as she forced her attention back to the call.
   </p>
<p>
    Russell, oblivious to Agatha’s increasingly frazzled state, continued his tirade on the other end of the call.
   </p>
<p>
    “I want a comprehensive rebuttal, Agatha. Don’t hold back. These clowns think they can push me around, but
        they’re about to find out who they’re dealing with!”
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, Russell,” Agatha said through gritted teeth, her focus fracturing as she caught movement from Rio again out
        of the corner of her eye.
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze flicked toward the couch, her attention split between the zoning report and the casual sprawl of Rio’s
        body. But this time, Rio wasn’t looking at her. Her eyes were closed, her head tilted slightly back against the
        armrest. She looked almost peaceful—except Agatha’s breath caught as she noticed Rio’s hand.
   </p>
<p>
    Under the waistband of her shorts.
   </p>
<p>
    And moving.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s grip on her phone tightened as her heart skipped violently. She nearly dropped the phone entirely, her
        knuckles going white around it. Heat flared across her skin, rushing up her neck and flooding her face as she
        froze in place.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     What the actual—
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Are you listening to me, Agatha?” Russell’s booming voice shattered her thoughts like glass, and she blinked
        rapidly, yanking her eyes back to her computer screen.
   </p>
<p>
    “Y-yes, Russell,” she stammered, her voice catching in a way that made her wince. “I’m listening. I’ll handle
        it.”
   </p>
<p>
    Across the room, Rio remained completely unbothered, her movements slow and unhurried, as if she had all the time
        in the world as she touched herself.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s stomach flipped, her mind racing between indignation, shock, and—
    <em>
     goddammit
    </em>
    — desire.
   </p>
<p>
    “Good!” Russell barked, thankfully oblivious. “I want those updates by three. Don’t let me down!”
   </p>
<p>
    “Of course,” Agatha replied, her voice higher than usual. “You know who I am, Russel.”
   </p>
<p>
    She ended the call with a hurried tap, tossing her phone onto the desk and glaring daggers at Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    “What the hell are you doing?” she hissed, her voice breaking.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes opened lazily, and that smirk—
    <em>
     damn that smirk
    </em>
    —curved her lips as her hand continued moving.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m staying horizontal,” she drawled, voice low and smug. “Just like you told me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s nostrils flared, her entire body tensing as she stood rooted to the spot. She was caught between fury
        and a deep, primal hunger that she didn’t know whether to fight or surrender to. Her jaw clenched as her gaze
        flickered to Rio’s hand, still moving beneath the waistband of her shorts.
   </p>
<p>
    And then she heard it—a low, husky moan that escaped Rio’s lips, soft but devastating.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re supposed to be
    <em>
     resting
    </em>
    ,” Agatha snapped, her voice rough, betraying her with the unmistakable
        growl beneath it.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk widened, her tongue working against the side of her cheek. The deliberate motion sent a bolt of heat
        straight through Agatha, who tightened her grip on the edge of her desk as though it could keep her from
        launching across the room.
   </p>
<p>
    “I
    <em>
     have
    </em>
    been resting,” Rio purred, her voice dripping with defiance and seduction. “All. Day.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her words hung in the air, charged with a teasing edge that made Agatha’s pulse roar in her ears.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’ve been a good girl, haven’t I, Agatha?” Rio’s breath hitched slightly as her hips arched upward, just enough
        to make Agatha’s gaze zero in. “Don’t you think I deserve a reward?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her throat dry, her control slipping further with every passing second.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re really doing this?” she hissed, but her voice lacked its usual sharpness, trembling under the weight of
        her own desire.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s dark eyes locked onto hers, glittering with challenge.
   </p>
<p>
    “You could come over here and stop me,” she teased, her voice a breathy taunt. “Or take over for me?
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s fingers dug into the desk so hard she thought she might crack the wood, her body vibrating with tension.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio,” she growled, her tone low with warning.
   </p>
<p>
    But Rio’s smirk didn’t falter.
   </p>
<p>
    Instead, it grew.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, my love?” she murmured, her words deliberately innocent, but her actions anything but.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s control snapped.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha practically launched herself out of her chair, her body moving on instinct, as she crossed the room. She
        reached the couch in seconds, her hands poised to grab Rio—but then she stopped, her breath catching as the
        image of blood-soaked fabric flashed in her mind.
   </p>
<p>
    The stitches on Rio’s brow.
   </p>
<p>
    The bruise blooming across her forehead.
   </p>
<p>
    The bandage on her arm peeking out from her t-shirt.
   </p>
<p>
    The memory of how
    <em>
     fucking close
    </em>
    she came to losing her.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes snapped to Rio, and she saw it immediately.
   </p>
<p>
    She froze, her eyes fixed on Rio. Her chest rose and fell with uneven breaths as her thoughts warred inside her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio, sensing the shift, stopped her hand. Her movements stilled as her head tilted, concern replacing the heat in
        her gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha?” she murmured, her voice softening with a hint of worry.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s throat felt tight, her words sticking for a moment before she managed to speak.
   </p>
<p>
    “Are you sure?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. It sounded smaller than she intended. “I don’t want
        to hurt you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s face softened immediately, the teasing smirk vanishing as tenderness replaced it. She propped herself up
        slightly, her good arm braced behind her, her eyes steady as they met Agatha’s.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Baby
    </em>
    ,” she said softly, the word carrying so much warmth that it sliced right through Agatha’s
        defenses.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her chest tightening further.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m okay,” Rio said gently, her voice steady and sure, but with an edge of need. “I promise.” She reached out
        with her free hand, brushing her fingertips lightly against Agatha’s wrist, grounding her. “And I need you.
    <em>
     Please
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Her words struck deep, the rawness in her voice wrapping around Agatha’s heart and squeezing. For a moment,
        Agatha just stood there, staring at her, the weight of everything they had been through crashing into her all at
        once.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, slowly, she moved forward, sitting down beside Rio, before reaching forward and cupping her face in her
        hands.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned down and kissed Rio softly, once—twice, and then deepened it.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio kissed her back, her lips demanding, her hands pulling Agatha closer. It was as though Rio was trying to
        anchor herself to Agatha, her fingers digging into her waist with an urgency that set Agatha’s heart racing.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha allowed herself to be guided down until she was fully on top of Rio, their bodies pressed together. The
        heat between them igniting as the kiss turned frantic. Then, suddenly, Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand and pressed it
        down, guiding it into her pants.
   </p>
<p>
    “Jesus, Rio,” Agatha mumbled against her lips, the combination of Rio’s raw desperation and the slickness she
        felt beneath her fingers stealing the air from her lungs. Her voice came out almost reverent, like a prayer.
   </p>
<p>
    “I missed you,” Rio gasped, her voice breaking with need.
   </p>
<p>
    The admission made something inside Agatha snap. A deep, aching need unfurled in her chest as she kissed Rio
        harder, her fingers moving with purpose, drawing soft, shuddering sounds from her.
   </p>
<p>
    But it wasn’t enough—it could never be enough.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha needed more.
   </p>
<p>
    She pulled back, her lips just barely brushing Rio’s as she whispered.
   </p>
<p>
    “I need to taste you.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes went wide, and she barely managed a breathy. “Fuck yes,” before Agatha pressed her hand to Rio’s
        chest, stopping her from moving as she slid down her body.
   </p>
<p>
    Her movements were deliberate as she gripped the waistband of Rio’s pants, tugging them down in one swift motion
        and tossing them aside. She paused, her gaze meeting Rio’s, her lips curving into a wicked smirk at the way
        Rio’s eyes burned with both anticipation and surprise.
   </p>
<p>
    “Don’t move,” Agatha murmured, her voice low and commanding as she spread Rio’s legs, leaning down.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha never thought she would love this—the taste of a woman on her lips, on her tongue.
   </p>
<p>
    But Rio was different. There was something intoxicating about her, something utterly addicting.
   </p>
<p>
    The first time she had been hesitant, unsure, but now?
   </p>
<p>
    Now, she craved it. She devoured Rio like she was starving, her tongue moving through her with deliberate
        intensity.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck—Agatha,” Rio growled, her voice raw and broken as her hips arched off the couch, pressing herself further
        into Agatha’s mouth. Her hands tangled in Agatha’s hair, her grip tightening as her breathing grew uneven.
   </p>
<p>
    The sound of Rio’s voice, the way she said her name, sent a bolt of heat straight through Agatha. It was
        electric, sparking something primal and possessive within her. She moved with purpose, her tongue and lips
        working in perfect rhythm, reveling in every gasp, every shudder, every curse that spilled from Rio’s lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s hips moved instinctively, chasing Agatha’s mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha pressed her hands to Rio’s pubic bone pressing her into the couch, keeping her in place as her name
        falling from Rio’s lips like a prayer.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha—oh god—don’t stop,” Rio gasped, her voice breaking as her fingers tightened in Agatha’s hair, holding her
        there, like she was afraid she might disappear.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha curled the tip of her tongue over Rio's clit, applying just the right amount of pressure, her movements
        deliberate and knowing. She'd learned what Rio loved, the patterns and rhythms that sent her spiraling. A couple
        of swipes later, she felt it—the way Rio’s body tensed, her breath hitching sharply before a guttural moan
        ripped free from her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha smirked against her, doubling down, her tongue working Rio through it as her thighs began to tremble
        around Agatha's head. Rio's hands tightened in her hair, tugging almost desperately as her hips bucked,
        completely lost to the waves of pleasure crashing over her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Rio cried, her voice hoarse and broken, her body shuddering uncontrollably as Agatha continued, drawing
        out every last bit of her release.
   </p>
<p>
    Only when Rio’s moans turned into soft whimpers, her body sagging against the couch, did Agatha finally ease her
        movements, pressing a few soft, lingering kisses to Rio’s inner thigh before pulling back.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sat back on her heels, her lips still glistening, her dark, hungry eyes taking in the sight of
        Rio—sprawled out, chest heaving, cheeks flushed, and utterly wrecked. Her satisfaction was clear in the smug
        grin that tugged at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio opened her eyes and caught the expression, rolling her own in exasperation.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re too damn good at that,” she muttered, though there was no mistaking the warmth in her tone.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha licked her lips slowly, savoring the lingering taste of Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    “You taught me well,” she replied, her voice low and teasing.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio let out a soft laugh, her head tilting back against the couch cushions.
   </p>
<p>
    “Too well,” she said, before turning her gaze back to Agatha. Her eyes gleamed as a playful smirk curved her
        lips. “Now come here.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha paused, her confidence faltering for a moment. It was one thing for her to take the lead, to pour all her
        focus into Rio’s pleasure—but the thought of Rio returning the favor, especially now, had her hesitating. She
        glanced at Rio’s injured arm, the tension creeping into her shoulders.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio, I’m good,” Agatha said carefully, the edge of her voice betraying her uncertainty.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes narrowed slightly, seeing straight through her. She stared at Agatha for a long moment, her gaze sharp
        and knowing, before the corner of her mouth tugged into an amused smirk.
   </p>
<p>
    “You know,” Rio said, her voice dipping into a low, sultry drawl, “there are ways for me to get you off—while
        staying horizontal and without needing to move anything but my mouth.” Her tongue flicked out, trailing over her
        lips deliberately, her dark, smoldering eyes drifting down to Agatha’s thighs before snapping back up to hold
        her gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath hitched, her eyes widening, and—
    <em>
     fuck
    </em>
    —there was no denying the heat that shot through
        her at Rio’s words.
   </p>
<p>
    “Come here, my love,” Rio murmured, her voice soft yet commanding, laced with a confidence that sent a shiver
        down Agatha’s spine and made her heart pound in her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s resolve crumbled, shattering like glass under the weight of Rio’s words and the hunger in her eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    She moved without thinking, standing and slipping out of her pants and underwear in one fluid motion, before
        stepping forward, her body attuned to Rio’s as if by instinct. Rio’s hands slid to her waist, firm yet gentle,
        guiding her closer, pulling her forward and up.
   </p>
<p>
    As Agatha straddled Rio’s face, her breath caught in her throat. And when Rio’s lips and tongue met her, hot and
        insistent, the world fell away.
   </p>
<p>
    Nothing else mattered.
   </p>
<p>
    Because, god—
    <em>
     she fucking loved this woman.
    </em>
</p>

    Chapter Notes
    <p>
     Okay so this chapter was supposed to contain sooooo much more. But then I got to 9,000 words and was only like 60% done and I was forced to switch up my game plan and break it into two parts. Sorry for the delay, December is brutal on my time. Good news is that the next chapter is pretty much written, I just need to wrap up the end. So you won't have to wait too long between now and the next chapter. Also because it is a 2 parter--peep the extra chapter. We are officially up to 32 and nearing the end!
    </p>

```
Agatha jolted upright in bed, her breath ragged and her heart pounding against her ribs. Her mind raced as the realization hit her like a freight train—the cameras.
    </p>
<p>
     The cameras in her office.
    </p>
<p>
     The ones that had definitely caught her and Rio fucking on her couch.
    </p>
<p>
     Beside her, Rio stirred, her hand instinctively reaching for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is it?” she murmured, her voice low and rough with sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's fingers pressed against her rapidly beating heart, her voice a shaky whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     “The cameras... in my office...”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a heavy sigh, pulling herself closer to Agatha. Without opening her eyes, she slid an arm around Agatha's waist and tugged her back down against the pillows.
    </p>
<p>
     “Relax,” she muttered into Agatha’s neck, her breath warm against her skin. “I texted Sam. She wiped the footage.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart was still racing, but her mind struggled to catch up with the calm certainty in Rio’s tone. The panic, sharp and clawing, refused to let go. Her thoughts spiraled, picturing every humiliating frame of what might have been captured—most notably, the moment when she’d ridden Rio’s face like a championship bull rider, clinging on for dear life and determined to last more than eight seconds.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let Rio's words settle over her, soothing her nerves just enough for her breathing to steady. But her mind latched onto something she couldn’t let go of. Her brows furrowed as she finally voiced the question clawing at the edge of her thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who the fuck is Sam?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned into her neck, a low, sleep-heavy murmur of frustration.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course you had to wait until 3 AM to have this conversation,” she grumbled, tightening her hold on Agatha as she adjusted her head against the pillow, clearly trying to drift back to sleep. “Sam’s the security agent on my detail. The one always standing outside my office and following me around like a shadow.”
    </p>
<p>
     That was all Rio said, like it was the most ordinary thing in the world. But for Agatha, sleep was now a distant dream. Her mind—razor-sharp even in the dead of night, a trait that made her an exceptional lawyer—kicked into overdrive. She conjured the image of the woman, piecing together every detail like solving a puzzle.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t like categorizing people—she found it reductive, lazy. But as the vivid memory of Sam sharpened in her mind, there was one label her brain had slapped on the woman immediately:
     <strong>
      gay
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Short-cropped hair with that was perfectly tousled with a the messy look. A tattoo of a flower creeping up her neck, just barely hidden by the high collar of her suit. Numerous piercings sparkling in her ears. And beneath the professional attire, the unmistakable build of someone strong—probably ex-military.
    </p>
<p>
     Sam radiated an aura of danger, like someone who could kill you and then look good doing it.
    </p>
<p>
     At the time, Agatha had focused on the
     <em>
      dangerous
     </em>
     part, appreciating that Rio had someone so clearly capable of protecting her.
    </p>
<p>
     But now?
    </p>
<p>
     All she could think about was the
     <em>
      gay
     </em>
     part.
    </p>
<p>
     And the fact that Rio had her number and they texted.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s stomach churned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you text often...” she began cautiously, trying to keep her voice nonchalant.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio huffed, as if sensing the direction Agatha’s thoughts were heading.
    </p>
<p>
     “Relax,” she mumbled, her lips brushing lazily against Agatha’s neck. “She keeps me safe. That’s it. She’s not my type.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart pounded, a restless drumbeat she couldn’t ignore as she pressed her lips into a tight line, trying—and failing—to maintain a semblance of composure.
    </p>
<p>
     Safe?
    </p>
<p>
     That was debatable.
    </p>
<p>
     Sam had
     <em>
      obviously
     </em>
     failed in that department. The jagged line of 12 stitches running across Rio’s brow, and the bullet graze on her shoulder was evidence enough of that.
    </p>
<p>
     But fine. She let that part go.
    </p>
<p>
     What she couldn’t let go was something else entirely.
    </p>
<p>
     “And what is your type, exactly?” Agatha asked, her tone sharp but betraying a flicker of vulnerability.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Gods
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     She could
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     Rio smile against the skin of her neck, the curve of her lips warm and teasing as her arms tightened around her waist.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s voice was low, rough with sleep, and impossibly smug as she grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uptight lawyers who wake me up at three in the morning to interrogate me about women who delete security footage... of her riding my face.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned, burying her face in her hands as her cheeks flushed, a mix of exasperation and embarrassment making her want to throttle—and kiss—Rio all at once.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate you,” she muttered, her voice muffled.
    </p>
<p>
     “No you don’t,” Rio countered, the grin evident in her voice as she pulled Agatha closer. “Now, go to sleep, cowgirl. You have a trial to win tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha exhaled, the panic about the cameras and Rio texting other women beginning to quiet in her mind. But in the silence left behind, another storm stirred—the ever-present buzz of her work brain.
    </p>
<p>
     The Vanguard trial.
    </p>
<p>
     It started tomorrow.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s jaw clenched as the weight of it settled over her like a familiar blanket—but this one suffocated, heavy with far more than legal briefs and courtroom strategy. This wasn’t just another case. It wasn’t even just the biggest case of her career.
    </p>
<p>
     This was personal.
    </p>
<p>
     They had come for her.
    </p>
<p>
     For Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     For Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The security firm couldn’t confirm the mugging was connected to Vanguard, but Agatha
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     . It was the kind of deep, marrow-deep certainty she couldn’t explain, but couldn’t
    </p>
<p>
     deny. They tried to kill Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     This trial wasn’t just a trial.
    </p>
<p>
     It was war.
    </p>
<p>
     Life and death, balanced on the edge of every argument she’d make tomorrow.
    </p>
<p>
     Her mind flashed to Brooke Sinclair.
    </p>
<p>
     Dead.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Murdered.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Another casualty in Vanguard’s long, bloodstained history. Brooke didn’t get justice in life, and now the burden of delivering it in death rested squarely on Agatha’s shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     She was the only one left who could hold them accountable. The only one standing between Vanguard and the countless others they’d destroy if they weren’t stopped.
    </p>
<p>
     Behind her, Rio’s arm tightened around her waist, her breath steady and warm against Agatha’s neck.
    </p>
<p>
     She was alive—thank the gods, alive—despite Vanguard’s attempt to change that.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed her eyes, her hand covering Rio’s where it rested against her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     The trial wasn’t just about justice.
    </p>
<p>
     It was about making sure Rio stayed alive.
    </p>
<p>
     Making sure no one else had to pay the price Brooke had.
    </p>
<p>
     Tomorrow wasn’t just about winning.
    </p>
<p>
     It was about survival.
    </p>
<p>
     The morning passed in a blur.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had allowed Rio to be vertical for the day—begrudgingly. Which meant Agatha and Nicky were treated to omelets. Nicky, thrilled to see Rio up and moving, had been in high spirits, happily chatting away between bites. It was a good morning for him, which meant he actually listened to Agatha, leaving on time with his security detail for school.
    </p>
<p>
     That left Agatha alone in the kitchen, sipping her coffee with a blessed ten minutes of quiet. She used the time to review her opening statement, the words etched into her brain as she silently recited them, ensuring every phrase landed with the precision she needed.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of approaching footsteps pulled her from her thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced up—and her heart lurched in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was walking down the hallway, strapping a black leather watch onto her wrist. She was wearing black loafers paired with a tailored light gray suit, cinched at the waist with a sleek black belt. A high-necked black turtleneck hugged her torso, accentuating her lean frame, while her hair cascaded down in soft, effortless waves. Even with makeup just barely concealing the bruises—dark, angry shadows blooming across her temple—Rio looked devastatingly good.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Too fucking good.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It took Agatha a moment to process the sight, her mind struggling to reconcile the bruised and battered woman she’d insisted rest with this polished version striding down the hallway.
    </p>
<p>
     And then it hit her like a kick to the chest—Rio looked like she was going to work.
    </p>
<p>
     Which was
     <em>
      insane.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha set her coffee down narrowing her eyes. She kept her voice measured and calm, though an edge of warning laced her words.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you dressed like you’re going to the office?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio finished fastening her watch, the strap clicking neatly into place before she looked up. Her expression was cool, casual—completely unbothered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Because I am,” she said simply, as though it were the most obvious thing in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked, stunned by the sheer audacity. The disbelief quickly gave way to anger, sharp and immediate.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like hell you are,” she snapped, her voice slicing through the calm of the morning.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stopped mid-step, her expression shifting from casual to serious in an instant. Her posture straightened, and her gaze locked onto Agatha’s with a weight that made the air between them feel heavier.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” she said, her tone low, edged with a warning that dared her to push further.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio,” Agatha shot back without hesitation, her voice equally firm, matching her tone beat for beat.
    </p>
<p>
     She rounded the kitchen island, her movements careful but sharp, until she stood just a few feet away, arms crossed tightly over her chest. Her eyes narrowed, fixed on Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The tension crackled between them, unspoken but palpable. It felt like one of those old Western standoffs—two gunslingers in the middle of a dusty street, hands poised at their waists, waiting to see who would draw first.
    </p>
<p>
     Neither moved.
    </p>
<p>
     Neither blinked.
    </p>
<p>
     The air between them felt like a taut wire, ready to snap.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s jaw clenched, her mind racing through every argument she could make to stop Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     And then her voice came out sharp, unwavering.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     going to work,” she said, enunciating each word with measured force. “You were just shot at, for Christ’s sake! You have twelve stitches in your head and another fifteen in your arm. You are
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     leaving this house.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s jaw ticked at that and her eyes locked on Agatha with a steady, unyielding intensity.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” she said slowly, her tone measured but firm, like she was trying to talk down a storm. “I have already been cleared by the doctor for light duty. I
     <em>
      am
     </em>
     going to work. I can’t just sit here alone and do nothing. My mind is too restless to sit idle for another day. I need to work.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s nostrils flared, her arms crossing tighter over her chest as her frustration boiled over.
    </p>
<p>
     “What you
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     is to stop being a fucking idiot,” she snapped, her words cutting through the room like a whip.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      That one landed.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes narrowed, a flicker of hurt glinting beneath the sharp glare she leveled at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Careful,” Rio warned, her voice low, edged with a sharpness that immediately sent a chill through the air between them.
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, her expression hardened, her jaw tightening as her dark eyes locked onto Agatha’s, daring her to push further. But as the tension lingered, something in Rio’s gaze shifted. The sharpness gave way to something softer, something almost pleading.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a step forward, closing the distance between them. Her movements were slow, measured, as though she were trying not to startle a skittish animal. Her eyes stayed locked on Agatha’s, no longer daring, but searching—trying to find a way through the storm raging behind them.
    </p>
<p>
     She reached out, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s hand before wrapping around it firmly. Her grip was strong, but not forceful, a steadying anchor against the chaos swirling in Agatha’s chest. Rio’s thumb moved in a slow, deliberate arc over the back of Agatha’s hand, an attempt to infuse calm, to draw them back from the edge.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sam has already increased my security team,” Rio said, her tone softer now, measured. She was trying to placate Agatha, trying to pull her back from the edge. “They’re waiting for me downstairs. I’ll be fine. I’m going straight to the office and then back. That’s it.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Sam.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The name hit Agatha like a gong, reverberating through her mind with a jarring, relentless echo. It consumed her thoughts in an instant, louder than anything else Rio had just said.
    </p>
<p>
     And before she could stop herself, Agatha took a step back, her movements sharp and defensive. She ripped her hand away from Rio’s like she had been burned, the loss of contact leaving an ache in her chest even as her anger surged forward.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fingers curled into fists at her sides as she tried—
     <em>
      really tried
     </em>
     —to clamp down on the surge of anger and unease rising in her chest. She knew she was spiraling, could feel it like a train wreck in slow motion, but stopping felt impossible.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Sam.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Sam, the very
     <em>
      obviously
     </em>
     lesbian security agent.
    </p>
<p>
     Sam, who had deleted the office footage with zero hesitation—because Rio had asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Sam, who Rio texted.
    </p>
<p>
     Sam, who was waiting for Rio downstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     Her thoughts churned, louder and louder, her insecurities screaming over the rational voice in her head telling her to calm down. Everything between her and Rio was so new, so raw,
     <em>
      so overwhelming
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     It was powerful enough to feel all-consuming, and that terrified her. She’d never had this before—
     <em>
      this intensity
     </em>
     —this type of love.
    </p>
<p>
     The idea of losing Rio—to another woman or to another attempt on her life that might succeed this time—suddenly felt all too real. It crept into her chest like a vice, squeezing tighter with every breath. The thought of Rio walking out that door, whether to someone else or into a danger she couldn’t control, sent a ripple of panic through her that she couldn’t ignore, no matter how much she tried.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened as she fought to clamp down on the words brewing inside her but the words spilled out anyway, fueled by fear she couldn’t quite contain.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right,” she said, her voice cold and biting, dripping with false control. “You’re not going to work. And, effective immediately, I’m removing Sam from your personal detail.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sucked in a breath, her brows drawing together in confusion that quickly sharpened.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” she asked, her tone dropping into a low growl.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s stomach twisted at the sound, her heart skipping a beat as she registered that tone— the one Rio only used when she was dead serious. It was the same low, commanding voice she used in the bedroom when issuing orders, the one that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine and made her body respond before her mind could catch up. It was a tone that carried weight, one that promised consequences if pushed too far.
    </p>
<p>
     This was no different, except the stakes were higher.
    </p>
<p>
     This wasn’t a game, wasn’t foreplay.
    </p>
<p>
     This was real
     <em>
      and dangerous.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     But Agatha couldn’t stop herself—not now.
    </p>
<p>
     “You heard me,” Agatha said, her arms crossing tightly over her chest like armor, her voice sharp and unyielding. “Sam is out. I’ll assign someone else—someone who doesn’t make me question why the hell my girlfriend seems to trust her more than me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s expression darkened even further, her jaw tightening as she stepped closer, her movements slow like a predator closing in on its prey. When she spoke, her voice was calm but carried an undercurrent of warning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, this isn’t about her—this is about you trying to control something you can’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s chest tightened, her stomach twisting painfully.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course, Rio saw right through her.
    </p>
<p>
     She
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     did.
    </p>
<p>
     But that didn’t make it any easier to hear. Her fear and frustration, bubbling dangerously close to the surface, spilled over before she could stop herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Control?” she spat, letting out a mocking laugh as she stepped forward, closing the distance between them. Her heels gave her just enough height to look down at Rio, and she used it to her advantage, her eyes blazing. “You think this is about control? This is about
     <em>
      protecting you!
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     Her voice cracked slightly on the last words, the intensity of her emotions bleeding through despite her attempt to hold them back.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t flinch.
    </p>
<p>
     She just looked up and met Agatha’s storm head on with one of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio said evenly, her voice calm but laced with steel. “This is about you being scared and not knowing how to deal with it. So, you’re looking for something—
     <em>
      someone
     </em>
     —to blame.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words struck Agatha like a slap, sharp and stinging. She faltered, her breath catching as the weight of Rio’s accusation settled over her. It was too close to the truth, and that made it all the more unbearable.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha straightened her posture, arms crossing tightly over her chest as if she could shield herself from the fallout of her next words. Her voice came out sharper, laced with a commanding edge she wasn’t sure she even believed.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not going to work,” she said again, louder this time. “Not today. Not after everything that’s happened. I won’t allow it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s good eyebrow arched slightly, but the rest of her expression remained unreadable, her body stiffening like an immovable wall in the face of Agatha’s demand.
    </p>
<p>
     “You won’t allow it?” Rio repeated, her tone cool, quiet, and cutting, the dangerous edge in her voice unmistakable.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s stomach churned, her pulse quickening as the tension between them thickened. But she pushed forward, her chin tilting up in defiance.
    </p>
<p>
     “You heard me,” she snapped, her voice trembling faintly at the edges. “You’re staying here, whether you like it or not.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dark eyes bore into Agatha’s with an intensity that made her throat tighten. The air between them felt charged—crackling—like it was waiting for the moment that one of them said something to catch fire.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not a child, Agatha,” Rio said, her voice dropping into that dangerously calm tone that carried the promise of consequence. “I don’t need your permission to leave the house.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed, frustration boiling over as her hands flew into the air, her gestures sharp and exaggerated.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then stop acting like one!” she shot back, her voice rising, each word dripping with fear she couldn’t admit.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s jaw tightened, the muscles in her neck flexing as she took another measured step forward. Her presence loomed closer now, and her voice, though quieter, was unrelenting.
    </p>
<p>
     “What part of ‘I need to work’ don’t you understand?” she said, each syllable deliberate and firm. “I can’t sit here doing nothing. My mind doesn’t do well with —”
    </p>
<p>
     And then it happened.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha storm broke.
    </p>
<p>
     And the words that tumbled out of her mouth were fueled by all her fears and her insecurities.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you walk out that door,” she said, her voice trembling, raw and uneven, “then don’t--don’t even bother coming back.”
    </p>
<p>
     The silence that followed was deafening.
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart sank the moment the words left her mouth, regret crashing over her like a tidal wave. Her eyes widened, and her hands trembled at her sides as if fighting the urge to reach out and physically pull the words back into herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio froze as the words landed, her body going rigid. The shift in her expression was immediate. Her eyes widened ever so slightly, and for the first time, Agatha saw something she’d never seen before on Rio’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     Hurt.
    </p>
<p>
     Not anger, not frustration, but raw, unguarded hurt.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart gave a painful lurch at the sight, the unfamiliarity of it cutting deeper than she thought possible.
    </p>
<p>
     She had done that.
    </p>
<p>
     She had caused
     <em>
      that.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     And it didn’t go away.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t shove it down, didn’t hide it behind her usual mask of composure.
    </p>
<p>
     She let it linger, let Agatha
     <em>
      see
     </em>
     it, and that made the weight in Agatha’s chest unbearable.
    </p>
<p>
     “Really?” Rio said finally, her voice soft but impossibly heavy, thick with disbelief and hurt that made every syllable feel like a blow. “You’re doing this?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened her mouth to speak, to explain, to take it back, but the words wouldn’t come. They were stuck in her throat, trapped by her own pride and fear, like shards of glass she couldn’t swallow or spit out.
    </p>
<p>
     Then Rio exhaled sharply, her jaw tightening as she did something Agatha hadn’t anticipated —she stepped back.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart cracked in her chest, the sound of it almost audible to her own ears. The distance Rio put between them felt like so much more than just a couple of feet—it had weight, tangible and crushing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had always pushed, always stepped forward, always closed the space between them, no matter how heated things got.
    </p>
<p>
     But now, Rio was stepping back, and it felt like a chasm opening between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t get to do that, Agatha,” Rio finally said, her voice low but sharp, each word slicing through Agatha like a knife. “You don’t get to use our relationship as blackmail to get me to do what you want. You don’t get to twist what we have into another weapon in your arsenal.”
    </p>
<p>
     She paused, her dark eyes locking onto Agatha’s, her expression a devastating mix of anger and heartbreak.
    </p>
<p>
     “What you are to me, and what I am to you—that isn’t leverage. It’s not a bargaining chip. And if you think that’s what this is, then maybe you don’t love me like I thought you did.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words landed like a physical blow, and Agatha staggered back a half-step, her chest tightening as though the air had been sucked out of the room. Her hands trembled at her sides, and she reached behind her to clutch at the counter behind her, desperate for something solid to hold onto, something to ground her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio...” she started, her voice cracking, but the words faltered and died in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Maybe you don’t love me like I thought you did.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The sentence echoed in Agatha's mind, reverberating with a cruel, relentless clarity. Her heart gave a sharp, painful twist, and she felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Of course I love you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     That is what she wanted to say.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to scream it, to grab Rio by the shoulders and make her understand.
    </p>
<p>
     But the words wouldn’t come, and the silence that stretched between them felt damning.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t say that,” Agatha finally managed, her voice barely above a whisper, shaky and broken. “You know that’s not true.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s gaze didn’t soften. Her jaw remained tight, her posture rigid, as if she were holding herself together by sheer willpower. Her eyes locked onto Agatha’s, filled with a mixture of hurt and defiance.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then say it,” Rio said quietly, her voice trembling just enough to betray the depth of her emotions.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. Her mouth opened, but the words refused to come out. They sat there, heavy and jagged, caught on the edge of her pride, her fear, her own maddening inability to be vulnerable in the way Rio needed her to be.
    </p>
<p>
     “I—” she started, but the sound faltered, thin and brittle.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s shoulders sagged just slightly, a flicker of defeat crossing her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Still she waited, giving her the space to speak—to say it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s chest heaved as her heart raced, her pulse thundering in her ears.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to say it.
    </p>
<p>
     She
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to say it.
    </p>
<p>
     But the fear, the walls she had spent a lifetime building, wouldn’t let her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio...” Agatha’s voice cracked, her hands trembling at her sides.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a slow, steady exhale, her expression closing off as though she had finally accepted the answer Agatha couldn’t give. She took another step back, and Agatha’s heart snapped inside her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right,” Rio said softly, her voice breaking just slightly before she masked. “I’m going to work.”
    </p>
<p>
     She turned her back to Agatha and walked away.
    </p>
<p>
     She made it about five steps, before pausing at the edge of the hallway, her shoulders stiff as if she were holding the weight of the moment in place.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath caught in her throat, her chest tight with the desperate hope that Rio might turn around, might look at her, might give her just one more chance to fix this.
    </p>
<p>
     But Rio didn’t look back.
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you will be worried so I will text you when I get there,” Rio said, her voice flat, hollow, a shell of its usual warmth. “Good luck at your trial.”
    </p>
<p>
     And then she walked into the hallway, leaving Agatha’s line of sight.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t move.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood frozen in place, her body rigid, her mind screaming at her to do
     <em>
      something,
     </em>
     to call out, to stop Rio from leaving. But she stayed rooted where she was, unable to tear herself free from the weight pressing down on her.
    </p>
<p>
     She listened instead, every sound amplified to an unbearable degree. The muffled shuffle of Rio’s footsteps on the hardwood floor. The sharp creak of the closet door opening. The rustling of fabric as Rio pulled on her coat. Each sound hit like a drumbeat,
     <em>
      so fucking loud
     </em>
     , as if the world itself was conspiring to force Agatha into action.
    </p>
<p>
     But she didn’t move.
    </p>
<p>
     The metallic clink of keys being lifted from the bowl on the table cut through the silence, followed by the faint jingle as Rio carried them to the door. Then came the soft click of the lock turning, the faint creak of the door hinges as it swung open.
    </p>
<p>
     And then Rio’s voice, low and unsteady but so goddamn loud it seemed to fill every corner of Agatha’s home.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you, Agatha,” she murmured, the words carrying a weight that made Agatha’s chest ache.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      She said it.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The words Agatha couldn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     And they now hung in the air, lingering and heavy.
    </p>
<p>
     And then the door closed with a soft but final click, sealing Agatha inside with her regret and Rio’s love.
    </p>
<p>
     The house was quiet again, so quiet it felt oppressive. Agatha’s legs trembled, but she couldn’t make herself move. She stood there, staring at the empty space where Rio had just been, her mind racing and her heart pounding as her emotions clawed at her from the inside out.
    </p>
<p>
     She just wanted to protect Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     But now, as she stood there alone, and felt the first fall of tears, she couldn’t help but realize the only thing she had succeeded in protecting was the walls she had built to keep her fear inside—and Rio out.
    </p>
<p>
     The fight with Rio replayed in Agatha’s mind on an endless, punishing loop. Every word she’d said, every defensive step she’d taken, every sharp retort and unspoken plea from Rio —she could see it all as clearly as if it were still happening. Her chest ached, a gnawing emptiness settling deep inside her, and she cursed herself for how
     <em>
      fucking stupid
     </em>
     she had been.
    </p>
<p>
     Why couldn’t she just say it?
    </p>
<p>
     Why couldn’t she tell Rio how much she loved her?
    </p>
<p>
     She
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     the answer, of course.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t about Rio, not really.
    </p>
<p>
     It was about her.
    </p>
<p>
     The tangled mess of her own trauma, the years spent convincing herself that vulnerability was a weakness, that love was a risk she couldn’t afford to take. It was the need to protect herself, the overwhelming certainty that she didn’t deserve what Rio gave her.
    </p>
<p>
     And the fear—that sick, twisted fear—that the moment she said it out loud, everything would fall apart.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      God
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     She needed to see her therapist.
    </p>
<p>
     She needed to figure out what the hell was wrong with her.
    </p>
<p>
     And more than anything, she needed to fix what she had broken.
    </p>
<p>
     She needed Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ms. Harkness, are you ready?"
    </p>
<p>
     The words barely registered, faint and distant in the fog of her thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     Then came a sharp jab to her ribs, startling her out of her spiral. Agatha snapped her head to the right to see Lilia, staring at her with wide eyes and a look that screamed
     <em>
      what the fuck are you doing?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Ms. Harkness, are you ready?" repeated Judge Marks, his tone clipped and impatient, the frustration of having to repeat himself evident in every syllable.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s gaze shifted forward, and her body stilled as the gravity of the moment hit her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Fuck.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She was in court.
    </p>
<p>
     Her surroundings came into focus—the heavy oak bench, the jury watching her with silent curiosity, the courtroom buzzing faintly.
    </p>
<p>
     She swallowed hard, forcing herself to take a breath. She needed to get out of her head and be present. She couldn’t afford to let her personal life bleed into this, not here, not now.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha inhaled deeply, straightened her shoulders, and forced her voice into steadiness. “Yes, Your Honor,” she said, her tone calm, collected, even as her chest still ached with everything she hadn’t said.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, she stood, smoothing her hands over her suit, and stepped forward. Whatever personal turmoil she was drowning in would have to wait. Right now, she needed to be the person everyone else thought she was: unflappable, precise, and always in control.
    </p>
<p>
     Even if she felt like she was falling apart.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha straightened her jacket as she stepped to the center of the courtroom, her heels clicking softly against the floor. She inhaled deeply, pushing down the storm of emotions swirling inside her. She could feel Brooke Sinclair’s parents in the front row, their grief a tangible presence that made her chest tighten.
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn’t fail them.
    </p>
<p>
     Not now.
    </p>
<p>
     She cleared her throat, her voice steady as she began, the words she had practiced for a week burning into her mind like a script she had memorized down to the punctuation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,” Agatha started, her tone calm and commanding. “The case I will present against Vanguard is simple. They are responsible for the death of a young woman who had the courage to stand up for what was right. Brooke Sinclair.”
    </p>
<p>
     She gestured toward the front row, where Brooke’s parents sat. Her voice softened slightly as she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     “Brooke was raised in a small community in Ohio by two incredible people who taught her to always stand up for what was right, even in a world that so often turns a blind eye.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her gaze lingered on Brooke’s parents, their tearful eyes locked on her.
    </p>
<p>
     “She did that. She stood up. And it cost her everything. It cost her—her life.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s voice tightened, and she paused for a beat, the weight of her words hanging in the air. She could feel the eyes of the courtroom on her, the quiet tension as everyone waited for her to continue.
    </p>
<p>
     “Vanguard must be held accountable,” she said, her voice firm but beginning to waver as her thoughts flickered, unbidden, to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      What about you, Agatha?
     </em>
<em>
      What are you accountable for?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The question stabbed at her, sharp and unrelenting.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t Brooke’s case that filled her chest with guilt and regret in that moment—it was Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     What she had said to her.
    </p>
<p>
     What she
     <em>
      hadn’t
     </em>
     said to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Her practiced words faltered, the speech she had designed to be powerful slipping away like sand through her fingers. Instead, something else rose to the surface. Something unfiltered, and painfully honest.
    </p>
<p>
     She took a step closer to the jury box, her hands gripping the lectern, her eyes scanning the room, though her mind felt a million miles away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Brooke Sinclair was brave,” Agatha said, her voice quieter now but no less steady. “She knew the risks. She knew that standing up for what she believed in might cost her everything. And yet, she did it anyway. Because she believed in truth. She believed in justice. And she believed that doing what was right mattered more than fear.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her voice trembled slightly, but she pushed through, the words tumbling out as though they had been waiting to escape.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fear...fear can be paralyzing. It can make you lash out, make you say things you don’t mean, make you hesitate when you should act.”
    </p>
<p>
     She paused, exhaling slowly as her gaze dropped for a moment before lifting again.
    </p>
<p>
     “But fear doesn’t excuse us. It doesn’t absolve us of responsibility. We are all accountable for the choices we make—even when we’re afraid. Especially when we’re afraid. ”
    </p>
<p>
     Her throat tightened as she thought of Rio, of the look on her face when Agatha said the words she couldn’t take back. She swallowed hard, forcing herself to focus, to tie it back to the case.
    </p>
<p>
     “Vanguard’s fear of exposure, their fear of losing power— of money —that drove them to make decisions that cost Brooke Sinclair her life,” Agatha said, her voice gaining strength again. “And now, they must face the consequences of those decisions. Because accountability isn’t optional. Not for them. Not for any of us.”
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped back slightly, her eyes scanning the jury, her chest heaving with the effort of keeping her composure.
    </p>
<p>
     “Justice is not about perfection. It’s about doing what’s right, even when it’s hard. Even when it hurts. That is what this case is about. That is what Brooke stood for.”
    </p>
<p>
     She looked back toward Brooke’s parents, her voice softening as she addressed the jury one final time.
    </p>
<p>
     “And that is why we must hold Vanguard accountable. Not just for Brooke. But for everyone who deserves to live in a world where doing what’s right doesn’t cost you your life.”
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped back, her chest heaving as she finished, her heart pounding in a way that had nothing to do with the trial and everything to do with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The words she had spoken weren’t just for the jury.
    </p>
<p>
     They were also for her.
    </p>
<p>
     A promise to herself to fix what she had broken, to take responsibility, to be better.
    </p>
<p>
     And as she returned to her seat, she knew that when this trial ended, her real fight—the one for Rio—was only just beginning.

    That fight was so brutal for me to write. Poor Agatha. Poor Rio. Here is to hoping Agatha pulls her head of her
        ass by the next chapter.

   Chapter Notes
   <p>
    Prefacing this chapter to say once again, I am not a lawyer. The only thing I know about the law is what I see on the TV while watching The Good Wife and Suits lol
   </p>
<p>
    Second, this is a long ass chapter. 11,000 words. God damn. It was pretty much written, just needed the ending to wrap up. So that is why the turn around time was quicker. Which was honestly nice, because I felt bad leaving you guys hanging after the last chapter.
   </p>
<p>
    Third, I had to add...another chapter because I didn't get to some stuff I needed to in his chapter. So now we are up to 33.
   </p>
<p>
    Lastly, enjoy!

<p>
   The trial had started just as Agatha anticipated—Fox and Ratcliff were a well-oiled machine, and they’d started
        strong. The defense paraded their high-profile witnesses, corporate heavyweights who spoke about Vanguard’s
        contributions to national security and humanitarian causes. On paper, Vanguard looked like a beacon of corporate
        responsibility.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had known she wouldn’t win against those witnesses. They were polished, untouchable. She couldn’t poke
        holes in their testimony because, frankly, it wasn’t the time. She needed to bide her time, to wait for the
        moment when she could peel back surface and and expose the rot beneath.
  </p>
<p>
   And that moment had come with Brandon Vanguard, the company’s Vice President and namesake.
  </p>
<p>
   The courtroom had been buzzing when she called him to the stand, expecting another corporate heavy weight that
        would only lend to Vanguards great reputation.
  </p>
<p>
   However, Agatha knew better.
  </p>
<p>
   Brandon was an Achilles’ heel disguised as an asset, and she was about to slice right through Vanguards tendon
        and send the companies case staggering.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d started slowly, building the foundation.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mr. Vanguard,” she had begun, her tone calm, “how would you describe your role in the company?”
  </p>
<p>
   His answers were predictable, rehearsed. He talked about overseeing operations, maintaining relationships with
        key partners, and
   <em>
    ironically
   </em>
   —ensuring the company’s integrity.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had let him talk.
  </p>
<p>
   She let him feel comfortable.
  </p>
<p>
   Then she turned up the heat.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’ve been arrested twice for DUIs and have one documented possession charge for cocaine,” Agatha said, her
        tone purposely sharper. “Would you say those incidents reflect the integrity you’ve mentioned?”
  </p>
<p>
   Unsprisingly, Fox sprang to her feet.
  </p>
<p>
   “Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha resisted the urge to roll her eyes, her control slipping just for a fraction of a second before she caught
        the steady gaze of Judge Marks over his glasses. His expression was neutral, but she knew better than to test
        his patience.
  </p>
<p>
   “Ms. Harkness,” Judge Marks said, his tone dripping with warning, “you’d better have a good reason for this.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha masked her features with a practiced calm, turning to face the bench.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your Honor, it’s relevant to establish a pattern of recklessness that extends beyond personal behavior,” she
        explained. “It speaks to his judgment as a leader within Vanguard.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her argument was clear and undeniably valid, but she knew it wouldn’t stop Fox from pushing back.
  </p>
<p>
   As expected, Fox immediately asked to approach the bench.
  </p>
<p>
   The sidebar was tense.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox argued passionately defending Brandon and, by extension, Vanguard’s reputation. After all, his last name was
        the company’s name—a cornerstone of its brand. Allowing Agatha to tie him to any impropriety was dangerous.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha, in contrast, countered with practiced precision, dismantling each of Fox’s points with her usual cutting
        but methodical approach.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks finally raised a hand, silencing them both. He glanced between the two attorneys, his lips pressing
        into a thin line.
  </p>
<p>
   And then his gaze settled on Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   That was all it took.
  </p>
<p>
   One look, and she knew she had won.
  </p>
<p>
   So did Fox, whose loud puff of frustration that was impossible to miss as she stalked back to her table.
  </p>
<p>
   “Answer the question, Mr. Vanguard,” Judge Marks said.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t suppress her smirk as she turned on her heel, heading back toward the center of the courtroom. Just
        for show—and because she couldn’t resist tweaking Fox and Ratcliff— she shot them a quick, mocking wink.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t need to see Fox’s reaction to know it landed.
  </p>
<p>
   Turning her attention back to Brandon Vanguard, she tilted her head slightly, her smile faint but predatory, like
        a cat toying with a bird with a broken wing.
  </p>
<p>
   “Do you need me to repeat the question, Mr. Vanguard?” she asked, her voice deceptively sweet.
  </p>
<p>
   Her lips ticked upward just a fraction, amusement flickering in her eyes as she watched him shift uncomfortably.
  </p>
<p>
   The jury was watching.
  </p>
<p>
   The gallery was watching.
  </p>
<p>
   Everyone in the courtroom was waiting for Brandon’s response and Agatha was going to make sure they remembered
        every second of this moment.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ve made some mistakes in my past,” Brandon began, his voice humble, his eyes scanning the jurors as though
        addressing each one personally. “But those mistakes don’t define me, and they don’t define the work we do at
        Vanguard. I’ve grown, I’ve learned, and I’m proud of the strides I’ve made, both personally and professionally.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t bother hiding the pointed glance she sent Fox’s way.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox was perched in her seat smiling like a proud parent, clearly pleased to see her rehearsed damage control
        coming to life on the stand.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let out a slow breath and stepped forward towards Brandon.
  </p>
<p>
   “Would you agree,” she began, her tone measured—careful, “that these incidents reflect poor judgment?”
  </p>
<p>
   Brandon’s smile faltered, the confidence in his voice wavering slightly.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ve already acknowledged that those were mistakes,” he replied, his tone still polished but not as sure as
        before. “Mistakes I deeply regret.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded, tilting her head as if she were about to let it slide. Then, she pivoted, her voice sharpening
        just enough to turn the room’s attention back to her.
  </p>
<p>
   “And would you agree,” she said, her words deliberate, “that these incidents also suggest a pattern of
        recklessness?”
  </p>
<p>
   The creak of Fox’s chair as she stood was almost as loud as her sharp.
  </p>
<p>
   “Objection, Your Honor! Counsel is badgering the witness,” Fox responded, her voice clipped, “and attempting to
        smear his character without establishing relevance to the case.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t even flinch at her objection—she expected it.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your Honor,” she argued back fighting to keep her tone calm, “the witness’s pattern of behavior is directly
        relevant to this case. It speaks to his judgment and leadership, both of which are central to the actions of
        Vanguard and the events that led to Brooke Sinclair’s death.”
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks leaned back slightly, his lips pressing into a thin line as he considered the argument. His gaze
        flickered to Brandon, who was clearly growing more uncomfortable by the second, before settling back on Fox and
        then Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ll allow it,” Judge Marks said finally. “But tread carefully, Ms. Harkness.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha inclined her head in acknowledgment.
  </p>
<p>
   “Of course, Your Honor.”
  </p>
<p>
   She turned back to Brandon, her gaze locking onto his.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mr. Vanguard,” she said, her voice steady, “let’s clarify. Would you agree that a leader’s decisions and
        personal behavior set the tone for the organization they lead?”
  </p>
<p>
   Brandon’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” he said slowly, carefully.
  </p>
<p>
   “And would you agree,” Agatha continued, her tone hardening just slightly, “that a pattern of
        recklessness—whether personal or professional—can have consequences for the people who depend on that leader?”
  </p>
<p>
   Brandon hesitated, his hands gripping the sides of the witness stand.
  </p>
<p>
   “I... I suppose so,” he admitted, his earlier confidence now visibly waning.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let the silence hang for a moment, the tension in the room palpable. Then she stepped closer, her voice
        soft but cutting.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mr. Vanguard, let’s move on to your role at the company. As Vice President, you’ve signed off on numerous
        financial reports, correct?”
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” Brandon said, his tone careful now.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha returned to her desk, picking up the folder of documents Rio had prepared.
  </p>
<p>
   “Specifically, this series of expense reports,” she said, holding them up for the court to see before sliding one
        to Brandon for him to look at it. “These reports total millions of dollars over three years. Each one bears your
        signature, and yet the payments cannot be tied to any known accounts at your company or its affiliates. Can you
        explain that?”
  </p>
<p>
   Brandon shifted in his seat.
  </p>
<p>
   “I—uh, I don’t typically handle accounting,” he said. “That’s usually managed by department heads. I must have
        signed off without—”
  </p>
<p>
   “Without knowing where millions of dollars were going?” Agatha interrupted, her tone incredulous.
  </p>
<p>
   “I—”
  </p>
<p>
   “Do you typically sign off on payments, Mr. Vanguard?”
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” he admitted, looking distinctly uncomfortable now.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha tilted her head, her expression a mixture of feigned confusion and disbelief.
  </p>
<p>
   “Then please explain,” she said, stepping closer to the jury as she held up the stack of documents for them to
        see, “why your signature is on this same invoice account, every two weeks, for three years. Are you seriously
        telling this court you don’t know where this money is going?”
  </p>
<p>
   Brandon’s face reddened, his gaze darting toward Fox.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha noticed immediately and pounced.
  </p>
<p>
   “Eyes on me, Mr. Vanguard,” she said sharply, her voice cutting through the tension as Brandon’s eyes shot to
        her—as did every other person's eye in the courtroom. “Why are you looking at your counsel? Do you think they
        have the answers? Are you not the Vice President of this company? Why don’t you have the answers?”
  </p>
<p>
   “I—I don’t know,” Brandon stammered, his composure starting to unravel under the weight of Agatha’s relentless
        questioning.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed, seeing the cracks starting to form. She leaned forward slightly, her voice sharp and
        precise, each word landing like a hammer to those cracks.
  </p>
<p>
   “Would you like to add perjury to your already
   <em>
    extensive
   </em>
   criminal history, Mr. Vanguard?”
  </p>
<p>
   “Objection!” Fox’s voice cut through the courtroom as she snapped top her feet, her face flushed with barely
        contained anger. “Counsel is badgering the witness and making inflammatory statements. Move to strike!”
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks raised his hand to silence her, and his expression turned stern as he looked at Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “Ms. Harkness, watch yourself. This is a court of law, not a theater. The objection is sustained, and the jury
        will disregard that last statement.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stepped back slightly, raising her hands in a gesture of mock surrender.
  </p>
<p>
   “Of course, Your Honor. My apologies.”
  </p>
<p>
   The judge’s eyes narrowed further.
  </p>
<p>
   “Be careful, Ms. Harkness. You’re already treading on thin ice.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded at that but thin ice is where she thrived and this exactly where she wanted to be.
  </p>
<p>
   She turned back to the jury, and could feel the tension in the room, the way the jurors leaned forward, their
        attention fully captured. She knew that Brandon’s hesitation, his inability to answer, was already far more
        damning than anything she could say outright.
  </p>
<p>
   She walked deliberately to the witness stand, placing the folder in front of him with a quiet thud, its contents
        splayed open to reveal stacks of documents bearing his signature.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mr. Vanguard,” she began, her tone calm but deliberate, gesturing toward the folder. “These payments—totaling,”
        she paused for effect, tapping her chin as if calculating, though the number was burned into her mind, “three
        hundred sixty-one million dollars over three years —bear your signature every two weeks. Are you seriously
        telling this court you have no idea where this money went or what it was for?”
  </p>
<p>
   Brandon swallowed hard, the movement visible in the tightness of his throat. His jaw clenched as he shifted
        uncomfortably in his seat.
  </p>
<p>
   “I—I don’t recall,” he said finally, his voice uneven, barely audible over the hush of the courtroom.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha arched an eyebrow, her skepticism practically dripping off her expression. She tilted her head slightly as
        if studying him, the pause amplifying the weight of his answer.
  </p>
<p>
   “You don’t recall signing off on millions of dollars? Or you don’t recall where the money went? Or what it was
        used for?”
  </p>
<p>
   Her voice rose slightly as she leaned closer.
  </p>
<p>
   “What exactly don’t you recall, Mr. Vanguard?”
  </p>
<p>
   “All of it,” Brandon muttered, his voice cracking.
  </p>
<p>
   “All of it?” she repeated, her tone incredulous, turning the phrase into a weapon. She stepped closer, lowering
        her voice just enough to force the jury to lean in. “Or are you just saying that
  </p>
<p>
   because you know the truth would be even worse?”
  </p>
<p>
   “Objection!” Fox barked, practically leaping to her feet.
  </p>
<p>
   “Withdrawn,” Agatha said quickly, raising her hands in a gesture of surrender before Judge Marks could admonish
        her.
  </p>
<p>
   She cast a glance at Judge Marks, whose glare told her she was nearing his limit, and nodded with a brief,
        apologetic smile. But the faint curve of satisfaction at the corner of her mouth betrayed her real feelings.
  </p>
<p>
   Turning slightly, she let her gaze sweep over the jury.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t need to say another word.
  </p>
<p>
   Their faces told her everything.
  </p>
<p>
   The seed of doubt was already blooming.
  </p>
<p>
   Brandon’s polished facade was cracking, and the jury was beginning to see him for what he was.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s voice softened as she grabbed the documents from in front of them and held them in her hands.
  </p>
<p>
   “Final question, Mr. Vanguard. And I want to take you back to my earlier question. Now that we’ve established you
        authorized the transfer of three hundred sixty-one million dollars to an unknown entity, would you agree that
        this behavior aligns with what we could call a pattern of recklessness?”
  </p>
<p>
   Brandon opened his mouth, but the words that came out were garbled, a disjointed mess.
  </p>
<p>
   “I—I mean, no—you see—”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let him flounder for a moment before offering him a placating smile that barely masked her disdain.
  </p>
<p>
   “Question withdrawn,” she said smoothly, giving him an out while simultaneously underscoring his incompetence.
  </p>
<p>
   The damage was already done.
  </p>
<p>
   As she turned back to her table, she allowed herself a brief glance at Fox, whose tight-lipped expression spoke
        volumes.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox knew it too.
  </p>
<p>
   And Agatha knew she was finally on the board.
  </p>
<p>
   “No further questions, Your Honor,” Agatha said, her tone final as she walked back to her seat.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox—
   <em>
    of course
   </em>
   , wasted no time, standing immediately for redirect.
  </p>
<p>
   She clawed back what she could, framing Brandon as a high-level executive inundated with documents, signing
        hundreds of reports daily for a company worth ten billion dollars. She argued that three hundred sixty-one
        million, while significant, wasn’t unusual in the scale of their operations. She added that Vanguard’s nature as
        a government contractor meant security clearances could restrict even the VP from knowing certain details. The
        money might not appear in standard accounts because it was tied to classified work.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha frowned as she listened.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox was good—very good.
  </p>
<p>
   She knew how to spin the narrative and patch the holes. But as Agatha watched the jury, she could see it.
  </p>
<p>
   The doubt till lingered.
  </p>
<p>
   It was subtle, but it was there, and that was all she needed.
  </p>
<p>
   Doubt was her opening, and she would widen it even further tomorrow.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, Fox returned to her table, shooting Agatha a look that was equal parts frustration and warning.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks nodded curtly.
  </p>
<p>
   “The witness is excused.”
  </p>
<p>
   Brandon stepped down stiffly, his once-confident swagger replaced with rigid movements. The charm he’d exuded
        earlier was nowhere to be found.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha watched him retreat, a faint smile playing on her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks adjusted his glasses, his expression unreadable as he surveyed the courtroom. With a quick glance at
        the time, he rapped his gavel once.
  </p>
<p>
   “We’ll reconvene tomorrow at 9 a.m.,” he announced, his tone final. “Court is adjourned.”
  </p>
<p>
   The courtroom buzzed to life almost immediately. Lawyers shuffled papers, the jury began filing out, and the
        spectators broke into quiet conversations. Agatha exhaled a controlled breath, straightening her posture as she
        gathered her notes into a neat stack.
  </p>
<p>
   Beside her, Lilia was already packing up the case files.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well,” Lilia muttered under her breath, glancing at Agatha, “that was... something.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha smirked faintly but didn’t reply. She slid her folder into her briefcase, snapping it shut before nodding
        toward the door. Together, they rose from their seats, stepping into the steady stream of people filtering out
        of the courtroom.
  </p>
<p>
   Before heading into the hallway, Agatha made her way over to Brooke Sinclair’s parents, who had been sitting
        quietly in the first row throughout the trial. Brooke’s mother stood as Agatha approached, her eyes glassy with
        unshed tears.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair,” Agatha said, her tone soft but steady. “I’m happy with how today went. We made progress,
        and tomorrow we’ll push even harder.”
  </p>
<p>
   Mrs. Sinclair nodded, her lips trembling as she reached out to squeeze Agatha’s arm.
  </p>
<p>
   “Thank you,” she whispered. “For fighting for Brooke. For giving her a voice.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s throat tightened, but she managed a faint smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “We’re not done yet. Rest tonight—we’ll keep fighting tomorrow.”
  </p>
<p>
   The Sinclairs exchanged a grateful glance before Mrs. Sinclair said,
  </p>
<p>
   “We’re heading back to the hotel for the night. But we’ll be here first thing in the morning.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded.
  </p>
<p>
   “Take care of yourselves. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
  </p>
<p>
   With a final squeeze of her arm, they left, their steps slow and heavy as they disappeared into the crowd.
  </p>
<p>
   The corridor was crowded, a mass of lawyers, reporters, and onlookers bustling about. Agatha and Lilia maneuvered
        their way through the throng. The hum of conversations surrounded them, snippets of whispered speculation about
        the trial and Brandon’s testimony.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha,” Lilia said, her voice low and laced with amusement as they maneuvered through the bustling corridor, “I
        had forgotten how absolutely entertaining it is to watch you in court.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha smirked, the compliment pulling her momentarily from her thoughts.
  </p>
<p>
   “Entertaining, huh?”
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia chuckled, shaking her head.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, don’t be modest. You know exactly what you’re doing in there. Watching you dismantle Brandon Vanguard piece
        by piece? That was art.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s smirk widened slightly as the memory surfaced, but it wasn’t just the thrill of today’s performance that
        lingered. It was the history between them, the way their paths had first crossed.
  </p>
<p>
   Over a decade ago, they had been on opposite sides of the courtroom—a true David versus Goliath matchup. Lilia
        had been Goliath, leading a powerhouse firm with resources Agatha couldn’t dream of at the time. But
        David—Agatha—had come out on top, not only winning the case but also earning Lilia’s respect.
  </p>
<p>
   That victory had led to the most surprising turn of her career. Lilia offering her a spot on the partnership
        track at her firm. Agatha had taken the opportunity without hesitation, and the rest, as they say, was history.
  </p>
<p>
   But as Lilia continued to praise her courtroom theatrics, Agatha’s mind drifted to a different battle, one she
        wasn’t sure how to win.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Rio.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Even though she still felt the high of finally making headway in the Vanguard case, the nagging ache in her chest
        reminded her that she was behind—
   <em>
    way behind
   </em>
   —when it came to Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   Work was easy.
  </p>
<p>
   She understood how to read a courtroom, anticipate a move, counter a play. It was all second nature.
  </p>
<p>
   But bridging the gap she had caused in her relationship with Rio?
  </p>
<p>
   That was foreign terrain.
  </p>
<p>
   And unlike court, there were no precedents in her arsenal to lean on because simply—she never had a relationship
        like she had with Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   She never loved someone as much as she loved Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   The thought of groveling—a necessity, she knew—made her stomach churn.
  </p>
<p>
   And emotional conversations? That was a minefield she had spent her entire life avoiding.
  </p>
<p>
   The thought of laying herself bare, of voicing the words she had always kept locked away, sent a ripple of
        anxiety coursing through her. Vulnerability was not her strength, and the prospect of confronting her own fears
        felt like voluntarily stepping into a pit of her worst nightmares.
  </p>
<p>
   But she had, for all intents and purposes,
   <em>
    royally
   </em>
   fucked up this morning.
  </p>
<p>
   And now, she needed to do whatever it took to make it right.
  </p>
<p>
   To unfuck what she had so spectacularly fucked up.
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia’s voice brought her back.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re quiet. That’s not like you after a win.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha glanced at her, forcing a small smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “Just thinking about tomorrow,” she lied smoothly.
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia’s eyes narrowed slightly, but she let it go.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well, if tomorrow is anything like today, Melanie better be on her toes.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but before a single word could leave her lips, a body crashed into her,
        shoulder slamming into hers with enough force to send her stumbling.
  </p>
<p>
   The impact knocked the air from her lungs, and she fought for balance. Of course, today had to be the day she
        chose to wear her highest heels—a statement piece for court that also doubled as torture device. They were
        difficult enough to walk in on a good day, let alone when she was literally thrown off her feet.
  </p>
<p>
   She staggered, arms flailing slightly, but before she could hit the ground, a hand gripped her arm, yanking her
        upright with surprising strength.
  </p>
<p>
   “Jesus, Agatha, are you okay?” Lilia’s voice was sharp, cutting through the commotion with genuine concern.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha barely registered her words as another voice, low and venomous, was speaking directly into her ear.
  </p>
<p>
   “Sorry about your girlfriend’s face,” the voice murmured, quiet but dripping with malice. The words slithered
        around her like a snake, tightening with each syllable.
  </p>
<p>
   The hand on her arm squeezed painfully, making her wince.
  </p>
<p>
   “She had such a pretty face. Next time, I’ll tell my guys to aim lower, so you can give her an open-casket
        funeral.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha froze, every muscle in her body locked as the words sank in.
  </p>
<p>
   The air around her seemed to thin, and the bustling hallway faded into a muffled hum. Her mind reeled, instincts
        screaming at her to react, but for a moment, she was paralyzed.
  </p>
<p>
   The chill running down her spine was soon consumed by a surge of molten rage, white-hot and blinding.
  </p>
<p>
   She turned slowly, her heart pounding in her chest, and there he was—James Hughes, Vanguard’s Head of Security.
  </p>
<p>
   He stood there so fucking cocky, a smirk tugging at his lips. His eyes gleamed with smug satisfaction, his
        posture relaxed as though this was just another day for him.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s mind raced.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    This man is unhinged.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Not just bold—fucking insane.
  </p>
<p>
   He had
   <em>
    confessed
   </em>
   to Agahta_._ Right here in public, in the middle of a courthouse hallway. Threatening
        her, admitting to orchestrating the attack on Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t a mugging. It had been a hit.
  </p>
<p>
   And now, he was promising to come after Rio again.
  </p>
<p>
   Her chest tightened, terror and fury battling for dominance. The image of Rio’s bruised face, her wounded arm,
        the blood—it all flooded back, consuming her.
  </p>
<p>
   James released her arm and began to turn away, his smirk widening as if he’d already claimed victory.
  </p>
<p>
   And then it snapped.
  </p>
<p>
   The rage boiled over, feral and uncontrollable. A guttural sound tore from Agatha’s throat, primal and raw,
        before she even realized it was hers.
  </p>
<p>
   James paused mid-step, his smirk faltering as he turned back at the sound, amusement flickering in his eyes. But
        he didn’t have time to say anything because Agatha’s fist collided with his face with brutal force.
  </p>
<p>
   The crunch of bone echoed in her ears, followed by a sharp, stabbing pain in her hand. She didn’t know if she’d
        broken his nose, or her hand, or both—but she didn’t care.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha!” Lilia’s voice was sharp and panicked, cutting through the chaos.
  </p>
<p>
   But Agatha didn’t hear her, didn’t register the commotion erupting around her. Her vision tunneled on James, who
        staggered back, clutching his bleeding nose.
  </p>
<p>
   “You bitch! You broke my nose!” he snarled, stepping forward, his face twisted with fury. Blood seeped between
        his fingers, staining his cuff.
  </p>
<p>
   Before Agatha could respond—or throw another punch—the security team assigned to her stepped in. Two burly men
        moved swiftly, positioning themselves between her and James, hands raised in warning.
  </p>
<p>
   Chaos erupted.
  </p>
<p>
   The corridor buzzed with shouts—accusations, expletives, gasps of shock.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha wasn’t silent.
  </p>
<p>
   Her voice joined the fray, rising above the rest as she hurled her own expletives.
  </p>
<p>
   “You fucking coward!” she roared, her body trembling as she strained against Lilia’s grip and her security team’s
        restraint. “You tried to kill her! You fucking tried to kill her!”
  </p>
<p>
   Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Fox and Ratcliff rushing toward the scene, their faces etched with
        disbelief and something close to horror.
  </p>
<p>
   Ratcliff moved to James’s aid while Fox looked at Agatha with wide eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha, have you completely lost your mind?” she shouted at her.
  </p>
<p>
   James started to lunge forward, but the security team shoved him back firmly.
  </p>
<p>
   “Stay back, Mr. Hughes,” one of them repeated—warning edging his tone.
  </p>
<p>
   The fact that this man was still trying to come after her, only added fuel to Agatha’s already burning rage.
  </p>
<p>
   “You are a coward! You want to come after me then come after me, you piece of shit! You stay the fuck away from
        her! You hear me!”
  </p>
<p>
   And then a voice cut through the chaos.
  </p>
<p>
   “Enough!”
  </p>
<p>
   The single word echoed in the hallway, silencing everyone instantly.
  </p>
<p>
   Heads whipped around toward the source.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks stood at the door to his office, likely hearing the panic and stepping out. His face was a storm of
        fury and disbelief as he took in the chaos outside his chambers. His eyes flickered to the security team
        restraining James, the blood dripping from his nose, and Agatha —her hand smeared with blood, her chest heaving,
        wild-eyed as she locked eyes with the judge.
  </p>
<p>
   The judge’s gaze narrowed on her immediately.
  </p>
<p>
   “Counsel,” he said sharply, his voice laced with icy authority. “In my chambers.
   <em>
    Now
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   The judge’s chambers were thick with tension as Agatha stood there, her shoulders stiff and her chest still
        heaving with residual fury. She could feel her teeth grinding together, her body practically vibrating with
        adrenaline and rage. She was trying to focus on the moment, but the burning sensation in her hand pulled her
        attention.
  </p>
<p>
   “Fuck,” she hissed, looking down at her bloody knuckles, which were rapidly swelling and starting to throb in
        time with her heartbeat.
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia, already beside her, grabbed Agatha’s wrist gently, her brow furrowing as she inspected the damage.
  </p>
<p>
   “I think you broke your hand,” Lilia said, her voice filled with worry.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha gritted her teeth, pulling her hand back from Lilia’s prodding.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m fine,” she snapped, her tone clipped, though the pain begged to differ.
  </p>
<p>
   Before Lilia could argue, the sound of the door slamming shut made everyone in the room jump. Judge Marks stood
        by the now-closed door, his face set in a thunderous scowl.
  </p>
<p>
   “Does anyone want to explain what the hell is happening?” he barked, his voice echoing in the small space.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed hard, the sharpness of his tone cutting through her lingering rage. She’d pissed off Judge Marks
        before—plenty of times, if she was honest—but she had never seen him this mad. Suddenly, she felt like she was
        back in high school, standing in the principal’s office after she’d kneed the star quarterback in the balls for
        grabbing her ass. She’d gotten a week-long suspension for that one.
  </p>
<p>
   But this wasn’t high school, and Judge Marks wasn’t a principal. He was the presiding authority over the most
        important case of her career, and she had just jeopardized it.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’d like to know that myself,” Fox interjected, her voice tight with barely restrained anger. “Your Honor, my
        client’s head of security was assaulted in the hallway by opposing counsel. This is unacceptable—”
  </p>
<p>
   “Your client’s head of security
   <em>
    threatened me,
   </em>
   ” Agatha shot back, laced with the fury still raging in
        her body.
  </p>
<p>
   "Enough!" Judge Marks bellowed.
  </p>
<p>
   His glare snapped between Agatha and Fox, leaving no room for argument.
  </p>
<p>
   "Both of you. Sit."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha reluctantly dropped into the leather chair. Lilia remained standing behind her, a grounding presence with
        one hand firmly on Agatha’s shoulder. Across the way, Fox sank into her chair beside her with a flourish of
        irritation, while Ratcliff chose to stand, mirroring Lilia’s stance behind her.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks began pacing behind his desk, his hands clasped tightly behind his back as though restraining himself
        from slamming them onto the table. He was clearly searching for the right words, his jaw clenched as his
        frustration radiated off him.
  </p>
<p>
   "Let me get this straight," he said finally, his voice low but thick with disbelief. "Opposing counsel physically
        assaulted someone in the middle of my courthouse? Do you have any idea what this could do to my courtroom’s
        reputation, let alone this trial?"
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s jaw tightened, the urge to defend herself bubbling up, but before she could speak, Lilia’s hand
        tightened on her shoulder—a silent warning.
  </p>
<p>
   "Judge Marks," Lilia said, her voice calm and controlled, the very picture of composure— everything Agatha wasn’t
        in this moment. "Last week, Ms. Harkness received photos from an unknown entity threatening her son and her
        partner. The photos were taken both in public and in private settings, clearly showing her family was being
        monitored. Accompanying the
  </p>
<p>
   photos was a note warning Ms. Harkness to drop the case against Vanguard—or her family would be harmed."
  </p>
<p>
   Marks froze mid-step, his sharp eyes locking onto Agatha, the anger in his expression softening slightly as
        concern edged in. He straightened, his tone less biting as he addressed Lilia.
  </p>
<p>
   "Why wasn’t this reported?"
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia’s lips pressed into a thin line before she answered.
  </p>
<p>
   "We could not substantiate whether the threat definitively came from Vanguard, so we took precautions on our
        side. We hired security to protect Ms. Harkness’s family. However," her voice dropped, her gaze steady, "two
        days ago, Ms. Harkness’s partner, Ms. Vidal, was shot at in what was framed as an attempted mugging."
  </p>
<p>
   Fox scoffed loudly, leaning forward with a dismissive wave of her hand.
  </p>
<p>
   "This isn’t a spy thriller, Lilia. My client had nothing to do with this alleged ‘
   <em>
    mugging
   </em>
   .’ Let’s not
        turn this courtroom into a conspiracy theory playground."
  </p>
<p>
   The growl that tore from Agatha’s throat was low and feral, her self-control hanging by a thread.
  </p>
<p>
   "Tell that to James Hughes," Agatha snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut. "The man just shoulder-checked me in
        the hallway, admitted to orchestrating the shooting, and threatened to do it again!"
  </p>
<p>
   Fox’s eyes widened, the briefest flash of unease flickering across her face before she smoothed it back into her
        practiced facade.
  </p>
<p>
   "Did anyone else hear this alleged ‘
   <em>
    confession
   </em>
   ,’ Agatha?" Fox retorted, her voice dripping with
        condescension. "Because I call hearsay. You’re just grasping at straws to win this case by spinning wild
        accusations."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha shot to her feet, ignoring Lilia’s attempt to keep her seated. Her injured hand slammed onto the table,
        sending a sharp jolt of pain through her arm, but she didn’t care.
  </p>
<p>
   "That son of a bitch threatened my family!" Agatha roared, her voice cracking under the weight of her fury.
  </p>
<p>
   "Enough!" Judge Marks thundered, his voice cutting through the room like a whip. His patience was visibly
        fraying, his knuckles white as he gripped the edge of his desk.
  </p>
<p>
   He leaned forward, his piercing gaze boring into Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   "Ms. Harkness, sit down. I am already fining you $10,000 for your actions—warranted or not, I will not tolerate
        violence in my courthouse."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let out a sharp scoff, the rage still boiling under her skin.
  </p>
<p>
   “Only $10,000?” she retorted, her voice dripping with venom as she gestured to the door. “Bring that asshole back
        in here so I can hit him at least ten more fucking times.”
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha,” Lilia hissed in warning, her fingers gripping Agatha’s shoulder like a vice as she forcibly pushed her
        back into her chair.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks’s lips pressed into a thin line.
  </p>
<p>
   “That’s another $10,000, Ms. Harkness,” he said, his voice icier than before.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha opened her mouth, but before she could fire off another retort, Lilia reached over and flicked her ear
        hard enough to sting.
  </p>
<p>
   “A fine she will pay,” Lilia interrupted smoothly, her tone calm and authoritative.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned to glare at her, but Lilia didn’t so much as glance in her direction. Her focus was entirely on
        Judge Marks.
  </p>
<p>
   The judge’s eyes narrowed as he regarded Lilia, the tension in the room thickening. There was a history between
        them—anyone could see it.
  </p>
<p>
   Mutual respect, yes, but also something deeper, something unspoken.
  </p>
<p>
   If Agatha didn’t know better, she’d suspect there had been a flicker of romance between them long ago.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks exhaled heavily, pinching the bridge of his nose as though willing himself to regain control.
        Finally, he shifted his attention to Fox, his expression darkening to something far more severe.
  </p>
<p>
   "And you, Ms. Fox," he said, his voice cold and deliberate, "if I find out your client’s people are involved in
        even half of what’s being alleged here, I will personally see to it that this trial doesn’t just sink your
        case—it will destroy your career."
  </p>
<p>
   Fox bristled, her jaw tightening, her fingers twitching against the arm of her chair, but she wisely kept her
        mouth shut—for the moment.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks straightened behind his desk, looking as though the weight of the trial, and now this debacle, had
        aged him ten years in the span of five minutes. His eyes moved between the attorneys, heavy with exasperation
        before he finally sat down in his chair.
  </p>
<p>
   “Thankfully,” he said, his tone sharp, “the jury was deliberating at the time, so they did not witness any of
        this mess. From where I stand, the trial can continue as planned.”
  </p>
<p>
   Fox’s head snapped up at that, her carefully maintained composure slipping for a fraction of a second.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your Honor,” she began, her voice smooth but tinged with barely concealed frustration, “this situation has
        irreparably compromised the proceedings. The actions of opposing counsel—
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    physically assaulting
   </em>
   my client’s employee in the courthouse, no less—are grounds for dismissal. How can
        we expect a fair trial under these circumstances?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha scoffed audibly, her fury bubbling to the surface as she opened her mouth to retort.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh, please—”
  </p>
<p>
   But Lilia cut in smoothly.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your Honor, opposing counsel’s claim is absurd,” Lilia said, her gaze fixed on Judge Marks, ignoring Agatha and
        Fox entirely. “Ms. Harkness responded to a clear and imminent threat made against her family. While her response
        may not have been ideal, dismissing the case would reward the very intimidation tactics being used against her.
        That would set a dangerous precedent.”
  </p>
<p>
   Silence descended over the room.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks leaned back in his chair, his eyes narrowing as he studied Lilia, then Agatha, and finally Fox.
  </p>
<p>
   “I agree with Ms. Caldru,” he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox stiffened, her jaw tightening further, but she didn’t dare interrupt.
  </p>
<p>
   “Here’s what’s going to happen,” Judge Marks continued, his voice authoritative.
  </p>
<p>
   He turned to Agatha, his expression sharp.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your firm will provide me with all evidence regarding these threats by tomorrow morning. If you’re alleging
        someone admitted to a crime, I expect a formal report filed with courthouse security before you leave this
        building. Am I clear?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, but she nodded.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes, Your Honor.”
  </p>
<p>
   Marks’s gaze shifted to Fox, his tone turning colder.
  </p>
<p>
   “And you, Ms. Fox—you will get your client’s people under control. If I hear even a whisper of harassment or
        intimidation from Vanguard or anyone associated with this case, I will not hesitate to issue sanctions that will
        cripple your defense.”
  </p>
<p>
   The silence that followed was deafening.
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks straightened in his chair, his final words cutting through the tension like a blade.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re all dismissed. And let me be perfectly clear—if I hear about another incident like this, neither of you
        will like the consequences.
   <em>
    Get out
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia was the first to rise, placing a firm hand on Agatha’s arm to guide her up. Agatha followed, her body still
        humming with adrenaline and fury, but she bit back any further comments.
  </p>
<p>
   As the heavy door to Judge Marks’s chambers slammed shut behind them, Agatha’s mind raced, her thoughts a chaotic
        swirl of anger, pain, and lingering fear. Her hand throbbed mercilessly and her jaw ached from grinding her
        teeth.
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia was on the phone speaking beside her, her voice low, undoubtedly dispensing orders to someone on the other
        end of the line, but the words barely registered. Agatha’s focus was consumed by the storm of emotions roiling
        inside her. The memory of James Hughes’s smirk, the venom in his voice, and the weight of his threat all played
        on a loop, fueling the fire in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   “Lilia! Agatha!”
  </p>
<p>
   The sharp voice jolted Agatha from her spiraling thoughts. She recognized it immediately and turned to see Alice
        hurrying toward them from the elevator, her wide eyes locked on Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia ended her call abruptly.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes, Jen—I will keep you informed,” she said curtly before lowering her phone.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha rolled her eyes, irritation sparking. Of course, Lilia had told Jen. She’d never hear the end of this from
        Jen—
   <em>
    ever
   </em>
   . She opened her mouth to call Lilia out for being a tattletale, but before she could get a
        word in, Alice reached them.
  </p>
<p>
   “Are you done with your motion hearing?” Lilia asked briskly, her tone all business.
  </p>
<p>
   Alice nodded but didn’t take her eyes off Agatha, her expression a mix of concern and disbelief as she no doubt
        took in her disheveled state.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good,” Lilia said, her tone clipped as she gestured toward Alice. “Take Agatha to Mount Sinai. She’s broken her
        hand.”
  </p>
<p>
   Alice’s eyes widened in alarm as she turned to Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “You
   <em>
    what
   </em>
   ?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha ignored her.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m not going to the hospital,” she growled.
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia stopped abruptly, spinning to face her.
  </p>
<p>
   “You will get your ass to the hospital right now,” Lilia hissed, her voice low but filled with warning, “or I
        will drag you there by the ear.”
  </p>
<p>
   She stepped closer, she was a good 6 inches shorter then Agatha right now due to the heels, but still somehow
        made Agatha feel small on her glare.
  </p>
<p>
   “You want to test me, Agatha Harkness? Try me. Let’s see how your unshakable reputation handles getting dragged
        out of the courthouse like a misbehaving child. Because I
   <em>
    will
   </em>
   do it.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s mouth fell open, and for a moment, she was too stunned to respond. But when Lilia reached toward her
        face, as if she were genuinely about to grab her by the ear, Agatha batted it away with her good hand.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay, mom!” she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she stepped back. “Jesus! Fine!”
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia didn’t respond, merely crossing her arms and arching an eyebrow in silent triumph.
  </p>
<p>
   Alice snorted, her initial concern giving way to a faint smirk.
  </p>
<p>
   But before the moment could stretch, Lilia turned her sharp gaze on her, and any trace of humor melted from
        Alice’s face.
  </p>
<p>
   “Do you still have that contact at the FBI?” Lilia asked.
  </p>
<p>
   Alice straightened, her lips pressing into a thin line. As a former district attorney, Alice had an extensive
        network of criminal justice contacts, a resource the firm often relied on to stay ahead of the competition.
  </p>
<p>
   “I do,” Alice said, her voice cautious as her gaze flickered between Agatha and Lilia.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good,” Lilia replied. “Have them meet you at the hospital. We’re turning over everything we have on Vanguard—
   <em>
    now
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha bristled at that, her body stiffening as a surge of unease coursed through her. She shot Lilia a sharp
        look, her voice cutting.
  </p>
<p>
   “No—” Agatha began.
  </p>
<p>
   “It is not up for debate,” Lilia interrupted, her voice rising just enough to convey finality. Her piercing gaze
        locked on Agatha. “Jen agrees. A line was crossed today, and now that we know the attempt on Rio’s life was tied
        to Vanguard, we’re done taking risks. We’re turning over everything to the FBI—effective immediately.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha clenched her good fist, biting back her instinct to argue further. She hated this, hated the idea of
        handing over all hard-won evidence Rio found to an agency that might not handle it with the same care. Vanguard
        had deep pockets, influence, and undoubtedly eyes everywhere. If the FBI had it, there was a very real chance it
        could find its way back to Vanguard’s hands, compromising their entire case.
  </p>
<p>
   It was of course always the plan to turn over the evidence after the case, but never before.
  </p>
<p>
   But as much as she hated it, Agatha knew Lilia was right. Vanguard had escalated the stakes, and this wasn’t a
        game anymore—it was war.
  </p>
<p>
   Her jaw tightened, and after a beat, she gave a single, reluctant nod.
  </p>
<p>
   “Fine,” she said through gritted teeth, her voice clipped with frustration.
  </p>
<p>
   Alice exchanged a glance with Lilia, her expression grim as she pulled out her phone.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ll make the call on the way to the hospital. They’ll likely meet us there.”
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia nodded curtly.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good. I’ll stay behind to fill out the report for courthouse security and ensure Judge Marks gets all the
        documented threats he’s requested. We can’t afford to push him any further when he’s already on edge.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha narrowed her eyes, crossing her arms as her hand throbbed painfully at the movement.
  </p>
<p>
   “Speaking from personal experience, Lilia?” she quipped, her tone biting.
  </p>
<p>
   Lilia arched an eyebrow, her lips twitching with the faintest hint of amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   “Wouldn’t you like to know,” she replied smoothly, moving her eyebrows suggestively.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s face twisted in mock disgust. The mental image that flashed in her head was like imagining her parents
        having sex—something she wanted to erase immediately.
  </p>
<p>
   “Actually, no. Keep it to yourself,” she muttered, fake gagging for effect.
  </p>
<p>
   Alice leaned closer, her grin wicked.
  </p>
<p>
   “For the record—I
   <em>
    definitely
   </em>
   want to know.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha rolled her eyes, letting out a dramatic huff.
  </p>
<p>
   “Of course you do, you little freak,” she mocked, shaking her head. She flexed her swollen hand slightly and
        winced as a fresh wave of pain shot through it. “God, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but get me to the damn
        hospital. My hand feels like it’s about to explode.”
  </p>
<p>
   The humor vanished from Lilia’s face, replaced with worry. She stepped back, nodding at them.
  </p>
<p>
   “Go,” she said firmly. “I’ll handle everything here.”
  </p>
<p>
   Alice and Agatha nodded back, and without another word, they turned and headed toward the elevator. As they
        waited, Alice glanced down at Agatha’s hand, her brows furrowing at the sight of the swelling and smeared blood.
  </p>
<p>
   “Jesus—what did you do?” Alice asked, her voice filled with both shock and curiosity.
  </p>
<p>
   The elevator dinged, the doors sliding open, and they stepped inside. Alice hit the button for the ground floor,
        her gaze flicking back to Agatha, waiting for an answer.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha leaned against the elevator wall, her tone dry.
  </p>
<p>
   “I punched Vanguard’s head of security in the face,” she said, almost flippantly.
  </p>
<p>
   Alice froze, her jaw dropping as her eyes widened in disbelief.
  </p>
<p>
   “You
   <em>
    what
   </em>
   ?!” she shouted, just as the elevator doors slid shut, sealing them inside.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha gritted her teeth as the orthopedic surgeon carefully examined her hand, the dull throb of pain
        intensifying with each subtle movement. The sterile scent of the hospital room and the bright overhead lights
        only added to her growing irritation.
  </p>
<p>
   “Based on your X-rays, you’ve definitely broken the metacarpals in your hand,” the doctor said, frowning as he
        released her hand and gave her a pointed look. “I’m going to need to reset the bones to restore blood flow, and
        then we’ll get you into a cast.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha huffed, her jaw tightening further.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Fuck.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   This day just kept getting worse.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ll grab the materials for the cast and get you a prescription for some painkillers,” the doctor added. “Fair
        warning—the reset is going to hurt.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded mutely, watching as he stepped out of the room. Her gaze flickered to the doorway, where Alice
        stood just outside, deep in conversation with two FBI agents. They were nodding along as Alice filled them in,
        gesturing occasionally to emphasize a point.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha had already gone over what had happened at the courthouse in excruciating detail, and she trusted Alice to
        handle the rest. But her stomach churned as she watched the interaction. Suddenly, Alice turned at the sound of
        a voice, and another figure stepped into view—Jen.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha instinctively held her breath.
  </p>
<p>
   Alice and Jen exchanged a few quiet words, their expressions unreadable from where Agatha sat. Then, Alice tilted
        her head toward the room, indicating in Agatha’s direction.
  </p>
<p>
   Jen’s gaze snapped toward her, and Agatha froze under the weight of her eyes. It was a look balanced precariously
        between relief—likely at seeing Agatha was okay—and frustration, undoubtedly at the situation that had landed
        her in this hospital to begin with.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha braced herself, already expecting the barrage of criticism she knew Jen would deliver. Jen took a step
        toward her, her expression saying that she was about to rip Agatha a new one.
  </p>
<p>
   But then she stopped abruptly, her eyes darting down the hallway to her left. Her posture stiffened, and for a
        split second, her eyes went wide before narrowing again and then she turned back to Agatha her lips twitching
        into what could only be described as a pleased smirk.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s brow furrowed.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Why does she look so smug?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Jen lifted her hand and gestured toward Agatha, pointing directly at her.
  </p>
<p>
   “What the hell?” Agatha muttered under her breath. She had no idea what was happening, but then—
  </p>
<p>
   Oh.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio stood in the doorway, her dark eyes immediately locking onto Agatha like a laser.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t look happy.
  </p>
<p>
   To be fair, Rio hadn’t looked particularly happy when she left this morning either, but this was different.
  </p>
<p>
   This was
   <em>
    intense.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha opened her mouth to say something—
   <em>
    anything
   </em>
   —but the words refused to come. She snapped her mouth
        shut, her mind scrambling.
  </p>
<p>
   What was she supposed to say?
  </p>
<p>
   Should she apologize for this morning?
  </p>
<p>
   For now?
  </p>
<p>
   Or should she just be grateful that Rio even bothered to show up?
  </p>
<p>
   The silence stretched, heavy and suffocating.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio, unsurprised by Agatha’s floundering, rolled her eyes and let out a loud, exasperated sigh before stepping
        into the room. She moved forward coming to stand beside the bed.
  </p>
<p>
   She stared down at Agatha, her gaze sharp and searching. For a moment, she said nothing, her eyes sweeping over
        Agatha’s face, lingering there for a moment. Then, her gaze dropped to Agatha’s hand—the swollen, clearly broken
        mess that rested in her lap.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s lips pressed into a thin line, and she exhaled through her nose, the sound quiet but loaded.
  </p>
<p>
   “You mangled my favorite part of your body,” she murmured.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s heart lurched painfully in her chest. Memories surged forward, of the first time Rio had touched her,
        the way she had traced her fingers over Agatha’s hands, massaging them, worshiping them like they were sacred.
  </p>
<p>
   She swallowed hard, her throat tight with emotion.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well,” she said, her voice unsteady, “at least I have two.”
  </p>
<p>
   She raised her uninjured hand and wiggled her fingers weakly, trying for levity, though the gesture felt hollow.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio moved faster than Agatha anticipated, snagging her uninjured hand out of the air and cradling it gently in
        her own. Her fingers traced Agatha’s palm, mapping the lines and curves, her thumb brushing softly over her
        knuckles. It was intimate and grounding, and it made Agatha’s breath hitch.
  </p>
<p>
   When Rio finally looked up, the weight of her gaze hit Agatha like a punch to the chest. The depth of emotion in
        those dark eyes was overwhelming—worry, anger, affection, and so much god damn love that it felt tangible.
  </p>
<p>
   “Are you okay?” Rio murmured, her voice so soft it was barely audible.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stared at her, momentarily stunned by the tenderness in Rio’s tone. Her throat worked, but the words
        caught. She blinked rapidly, swallowing around the lump that had formed.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ve been better,” Agatha admitted quietly.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio nodded slowly, her expression unreadable but her eyes softening. It was as if she was silently agreeing that
        she, too, had seen better days. They’d both been through hell—and all of it, Agatha knew, was thanks to her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Did you really punch someone at the courthouse?” Rio asked after a beat, her tone laced with disbelief and a
        flicker of curiosity.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha grimaced, her lips twitching in a wry half-smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “Jen didn’t tell you?” she asked, surprised.
  </p>
<p>
   Jen usually jumped at any opportunity to report Agatha’s antics, especially to Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   It was very much a Jen move.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio shook her head, her dark eyes narrowing slightly.
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” she said. “But it’s all over the office. ‘Agatha Harkness punched a guy after court.’ You know something
        like that spreads like wildfire. Then the Sa—” She paused, clearing her throat as if catching herself. “Security
        said you were at the hospital, so I came right here.”
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t lost on Agatha that Rio had deliberately avoided saying Sam’s name—like she was trying to avoid the
        fight this morning—at least for now.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha,” Rio said slowly, her hand intertwining with Agatha’s. “What happened?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha frowned, her gaze dropping to their joined hands. She squeezed Rio’s fingers, as if drawing strength from
        her touch, and exhaled heavily.
  </p>
<p>
   “It was James Hughes,” she admitted.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s eyes widened at the name, recognition flashing across her face.
  </p>
<p>
   “Seriously?” she asked, her voice sharp with alarm.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded grimly.
  </p>
<p>
   “He shoulder-checked me in the courthouse hallway, and then...”
  </p>
<p>
   She hesitated, her throat tightening as the memory resurfaced.
  </p>
<p>
   “He admitted it, Rio. The mugging wasn’t random. He orchestrated it. He was trying to kill you.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio stiffened, her free hand clenching into a fist at her side.
  </p>
<p>
   “And then,” Agatha continued, her voice faltering for a moment before she pushed on, “he said he’d come after you
        again.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her words burned as they left her mouth, her chest tightening painfully as the weight of them settled between
        them. Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand tighter, as if that alone could anchor her, remind her that James hadn’t
        succeeded—that Rio was still here, alive and in front of her.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s expression darkened, her jaw tightening as her gaze flickered briefly to the doorway where Jen and Alice
        were still deep in conversation with the FBI agents. Her eyes lingered there for a moment, her mind clearly
        working through the implications, but then her focus shifted back to Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha hesitated under Rio’s sharp gaze, then grimaced, a flicker of something almost sheepish crossing her face.
  </p>
<p>
   “I may have lost my temper,” she admitted. “And... punched him.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s sheepishness didn’t last long. Her expression shifted as a sly smile tugged at her lips, the memory of
        the moment blooming vividly in her mind.
  </p>
<p>
   “Pretty sure I broke his nose,” Agatha added, a flicker of pride slipping into her tone despite the throbbing
        pain in her hand. The image of James Hughes’s face, contorted with shock as blood poured from his nose, replayed
        in her mind like a highlight reel.
  </p>
<p>
   She couldn’t help but savor it.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s expression shifted, caught somewhere between surprise and the urge to scold Agatha for her recklessness.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, Rio let out a quiet sigh and reached forward, her fingers gently cupping Agatha’s face. The tender
        gesture melted the last of Agatha’s tension, her shoulders relaxing as she leaned instinctively into Rio’s
        touch.
  </p>
<p>
   “Agatha—” Rio began.
  </p>
<p>
   But before she could finish, the door swung open, and the doctor walked in, his arms loaded with supplies. He
        froze mid-step, his eyes widening slightly as he registered the moment he’d interrupted.
  </p>
<p>
   His lips quirked into an awkward smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “Uh... ready to get your cast on?” he asked awkwardly, shifting the supplies in his arms.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio pulled her hand back quickly, stepping away from Agatha with a subtle clearing of her throat. The absence of
        her touch was immediate, and Agatha had to fight the impulse to reach out and grab her hand again.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, Agatha let out a huff of frustration, casting a sidelong glance at Rio before nodding.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let’s just get it over with.”
  </p>
<p>
   The doctor nodded, stepping toward a nearby tray and beginning to organize the materials with practiced
        efficiency.
  </p>
<p>
   “Can I stay?” Rio asked, her voice steady but quiet, her gaze fixed on the doctor.
  </p>
<p>
   The doctor barely looked up before nodding.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes, of course,” he said, his tone matter-of-fact.
  </p>
<p>
   Both Agatha and Rio exhaled audibly, their relief almost comical in its synchronicity.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha glanced at Rio again, her lips twitching with a faint smile despite herself. Having Rio there—despite
   <em>
    everything
   </em>
   —felt like a balm to the frayed edges of her nerves.
  </p>
<p>
   The doctor finished setting up his supplies, arranging the splints, bandages, and casting materials with well
        practiced hand. Then he turned to Agatha, moving to stand beside her as he gently took her injured hand in his
        own. His touch was firm but careful, and his fingers began to press along her swollen knuckles and radiating
        pain points.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha winced, her breath hitching at each probing movement.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay,” the doctor said after a few moments, his fingers pausing on a particularly sensitive spot. He lingered
        there, his touch light but deliberate. “I need to reset the fracture. This is going to hurt.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha exhaled sharply, her shoulders stiffening as she mentally braced herself. The pain was already bad—
   <em>
    how much worse could it get?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Suddenly, she felt another hand slip into hers.
  </p>
<p>
   Startled, she glanced down to see Rio’s fingers entwined with her own.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s dark eyes stayed locked on her.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s chest tightened, a flicker of appreciation cutting through the haze of pain and frustration. She looked
        back up at the doctor, her voice firm despite the knot in her throat.
  </p>
<p>
   “Just do it,” she said.
  </p>
<p>
   The doctor nodded, positioning her hand carefully.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ll count down,” he said, his voice calm, almost soothing.
  </p>
<p>
   He began to count.
  </p>
<p>
   “Three... two—”
  </p>
<p>
   Before he reached one, he pressed.
  </p>
<p>
   The pain shot through Agatha like a lightning bolt, and she let out a sharp hiss, gripping Rio’s hand like a
        lifeline.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio didn’t flinch. She just squeezed Agatha’s hand tighter, her thumb brushing gently over the back of her
        knuckles.
  </p>
<p>
   “Fuck,” Agatha groaned through gritted teeth, glaring up at the doctor. “What’s the point of counting down if
        you’re not going to go on
   <em>
    one
   </em>
   ?”
  </p>
<p>
   The doctor didn’t even blink, his attention on her hand.
  </p>
<p>
   “Because going on two is better,” he said simply, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “People
        brace too hard on one, makes it harder to reset properly.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha rolled her eyes, but before she could retort, the doctor pressed one last time, setting the bone fully
        into place. The sharp pain made her hiss again, her grip on Rio’s hand tightening reflexively.
  </p>
<p>
   “And... done,” the doctor said, stepping back and pulling off his gloves. “You’ll need to keep this hand
        immobilized for a few weeks. I’ll get the cast on now, and we’ll go over aftercare instructions.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let out a shaky breath, her body slumping slightly. Her hand still throbbed, but at least the worst of it
        was over.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s grip on her hand didn’t loosen, and Agatha didn’t pull away. She looked over at Rio, their eyes meeting for
        a brief moment that felt like an eternity.
  </p>
<p>
   “Thanks,” Agatha said softly, her voice barely audible as the lingering pain throbbed in her hand.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio gave her a small, almost imperceptible nod, her dark eyes meeting Agatha’s with that quiet intensity she
        seemed to master. Her thumb continued its soothing rhythm, brushing lightly against Agatha’s knuckles, grounding
        her in the moment.
  </p>
<p>
   “Of course, my love,” Rio murmured, her voice so gentle it almost broke Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    God, those words.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio’s ‘
   <em>
    my love
   </em>
   ’ wrapped around Agatha heart, easing the ache in her body far more effectively than
        anything the doctor could prescribe.
  </p>
<p>
   Hours later, Agatha and Rio stepped through the front door, the soft click of it closing behind them echoing in
        the quiet house. The nighttime nanny glanced up from the book she was reading on the couch, her gaze quickly
        shifting between Agatha’s cast and then Rio, both of them clearly new to her. She raised an eyebrow but didn’t
        comment.
  </p>
<p>
   “Nicky went down okay,” the nanny said, setting the book aside and rising to her feet. “He was, of course, sad
        you weren’t here, and also he kept mentioning someone named Rio. But after a couple of chapters of
   <em>
    Harry
            Potter,
   </em>
   he was out like a light.”
  </p>
<p>
   At the mention of Nicky asking for Rio, Agatha’s eyes flicked to her, and she didn’t miss the small quirk of
        Rio’s lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ll leave you to it, Ms. Harkness,” the nanny said with a polite nod before grabbing her things and heading out
        the door.
  </p>
<p>
   As soon as the door closed, the silence in the home was deafening. It pressed in on Agatha, heavy and
        suffocating. She made a beeline for the kitchen, heading straight for the liquor.
  </p>
<p>
   Her movements were awkward, her left hand fumbling to grab the whiskey from the high perch had frustration
        bubbling up inside her. Using her non-dominant hand for something so simple felt infuriatingly clumsy, and the
        ache in her cast didn’t help.
  </p>
<p>
   Before she could fumble further, she felt fingers at her back, light and steady.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let me do it,” Rio said softly, her voice calm and steady.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sighed, the tension in her shoulders easing as she sagged into Rio’s touch for a brief moment. She nodded
        wordlessly and stepped aside.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio reached up and pulled down the bottle of bourbon. She grabbed two glasses from the other cabinet, her ease in
        the space so sure and effortless it made Agatha’s throat tighten. Rio
  </p>
<p>
   poured a generous amount into each glass, clearly understanding that both of them needed this tonight.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t hesitate, grabbing her glass, before putting some distance between them and taking a long drink.
        The bourbon burned as it slid down her throat, the sensation grounding her, pulling her focus away from the
        chaos of the day.
  </p>
<p>
   She caught sight of Rio taking a sip from her own glass, her movements slower, more controlled. Rio nursed her
        drink, her dark eyes thoughtful as they lifted to meet Agatha’s.
  </p>
<p>
   Their gazes locked, and neither of them looked away.
  </p>
<p>
   And then finally, Agatha sighed because she had things she needed to say—things she needed to own up to.
  </p>
<p>
   “Rio,” Agatha said softly, her voice steady but strained as she made sure to look Rio in the eye. “I’m sorry
        about this morning.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s jaw tightened, the muscle flexing just slightly—a small but telling sign that the fight from this morning
        still lingered, tender and unresolved.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t respond.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t say it was okay—because it wasn’t.
  </p>
<p>
   What Agatha had said wasn’t okay, and they both knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, Rio stood silently, her dark eyes fixed on Agatha, giving her the space to say more.
  </p>
<p>
   Because an apology, Rio’s silence made clear, wasn’t going to cut it.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha swallowed hard, respecting the unspoken demand and hating it all the same.
  </p>
<p>
   This woman—this maddening, beautiful, unrelenting woman—was never going to give her an inch.
  </p>
<p>
   Letting out a slow breath, Agatha set her glass down on the counter and leaned back against it, crossing her arms
        over her chest as she tried to figure out where to even start. How did she explain herself—explain why she was
        so damn emotionally stunted?
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ve mentioned it before,” she started haltingly, her voice quieter now. “My childhood. And I’m not trying to
        make excuses—I’m not. But my mother... she really fucked me up.”
  </p>
<p>
   The words came out raw, almost brittle, but Agatha forced herself to keep going.
  </p>
<p>
   “By the time I was Nicky’s age, I knew every form of neglect there was. Starved, beaten, degraded...”
  </p>
<p>
   Her voice faltered, and she let out a shaky breath.
  </p>
<p>
   “I didn’t have a home, Rio. I had a rotting trailer where survival was a daily battle. And love?”
  </p>
<p>
   She let out a bitter, broken laugh.
  </p>
<p>
   “Love wasn’t something I ever received and if you asked my mother—it wasn’t something I deserved.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her gaze dropped to the counter, the fingers of her good hand tracing the edge absently as the vulnerability
        crept up her chest like an itch she couldn’t scratch.
  </p>
<p>
   “Growing up like that—
   <em>
    fuck
   </em>
   —it changes you,” she admitted, her tone heavy. “It carves something sharp
        and hard inside you. And as much as I hate to admit it...”
  </p>
<p>
   Her lips twisted into a wry, self-deprecating smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “Evanora Harkness may have completely fucked me up emotionally—but her cruelty is part of what made me the lawyer
        I am today. It made me ruthless enough to climb higher than anyone thought I could. I didn’t care whose body I
        had to step over to get my power. When you grow up powerless... power is everything. And I wanted it. I
   <em>
    needed
   </em>
   it. And I fucking have it.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha inhaled deeply, the air feeling thick and heavy in her lungs. The silence stretched between them like a
        chasm, and she knew—
   <em>
    knew
   </em>
   —that the next words she spoke would either build a bridge or send them
        tumbling into the void that Agatha created this morning.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s dark eyes were steady, piercing, and unreadable.
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t anger, but it wasn’t softness either.
  </p>
<p>
   It was patience.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Waiting.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Rio was the one giving her space, and somehow, that made it harder.
  </p>
<p>
   Her chest tightened, and she had to look away, her eyes falling to her hands—one now in a cast, the other
        trembling slightly. She swallowed hard, trying to gather herself, trying to figure out where to start.
  </p>
<p>
   “And then Nicky came along,” she said softly, her voice almost too quiet for the room. A bittersweet smile
        flickered across her lips. “And he cracked something open in me. Something I didn’t even know was still there.”
  </p>
<p>
   She let out a shaky laugh, glancing down the hallway where his room was, her mind painting an image of him safe
        in his bed, his tiny body curled up, lost in dreams—safe and knowing nothing but unconditional love.
  </p>
<p>
   “He’s my heart, my every breath. And I’ve sworn to him—
   <em>
    to myself
   </em>
   —that he’ll never know the childhood I
        had.
   <em>
    Never
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt the weight of Rio’s gaze on her, and it burned. She forced herself to meet it, her voice soft but
        firm.
  </p>
<p>
   “I love my son,” she said, the words spilling out like a prayer. “I love him with every beat of my heart, with
        every breath I take. From the moment I first felt him move inside me, I loved him. Completely. Instantly.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her lips pressed into a thin line as her thoughts shifted, the warmth in her voice cooling into something more
        vulnerable.
  </p>
<p>
   “That love—
   <em>
    motherhood
   </em>
   —it came so naturally to me. I didn’t even have to think about it. He’s mine. My
        blood. It made sense.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her throat tightened as she reached the place she had been dreading, the place she knew she had to go. Her hands
        shook, and her gaze faltered for a moment before she forced herself to keep going to look Rio in the eye as she
        spoke.
  </p>
<p>
   “But with you,” she began, her voice breaking slightly, “it’s different. What I feel for you—it doesn’t come
        naturally, and it doesn’t make sense to me. And it scares the hell out of me, Rio. It makes me question
        everything I thought I knew about myself.”
  </p>
<p>
   She paused, her chest rising and falling as she fought to steady her breathing. The words clogged her throat, but
        she pushed through, her voice trembling.
  </p>
<p>
   “You terrify me, Rio,” she admitted, her voice cracking. “You make me feel things I’ve spent my whole life trying
        to avoid. You’re not something I can control. You’re not something I can predict. And for someone like me...
        that’s the most terrifying thing in the world.”
  </p>
<p>
   The tears came then, hot and fast, spilling over before she could stop them. She let out a broken laugh, swiping
        at her face with her good hand, but the tears kept coming.
  </p>
<p>
   “But you’re also the most beautiful thing I’ve ever had,” she pushed, voice cracking. “You’re my home, Rio. And
        for someone who grew up thinking a home was nothing more than a cruel joke, you’ve given me something I never
        thought I could have. And now that I have it, I’m so fucking scared of losing it. Of losing
   <em>
    you.
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   She finally looked up, her eyes red and glistening, her heart in her throat.
  </p>
<p>
   “I don’t know how to love you the way you deserve,” she admitted, her voice hoarse and broken. “But I want to.
        God, I
   <em>
    want
   </em>
   to. And I’m sorry—so fucking sorry—that I can’t say those words. That I can’t—”
  </p>
<p>
   Her voice cracked, and she exhaled shakily, her hands trembling as she swiped at the tears on her cheeks.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m trying, Rio. I’m trying so damn hard to be what you deserve, but I’m so scared. Scared that if I say it—if I
        admit how much you mean to me—that it’ll all fall apart.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her shoulders slumped as the weight of her words settled over her, the silence between them deafening.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’m sorry,” she whispered again, the words barely audible but carrying every ounce of her aching regret.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio stood still for a moment, her expression unreadable, her gaze steady and locked on Agatha. Then, without a
        word, she set her drink down on the counter with a soft clink and stepped forward, closing the distance between
        them.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t stop until she was so close that Agatha could feel the faint warmth of her body, her presence
        grounding and overwhelming all at once. Agatha froze, her breath hitching, her heart hammering in her chest as
        Rio reached up.
  </p>
<p>
   Gently, Rio cupped Agatha’s face with both hands, her touch impossibly tender. Her thumbs moved slowly, swiping
        away the tears that had been steadily falling down Agatha’s cheeks.
  </p>
<p>
   The softness of her touch, the care in the gesture—it broke something in Agatha, something fragile and hidden
        that she hadn’t even realized she’d been holding onto.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips parted, but no sound came out. Her whole body seemed to lean into Rio instinctively, craving the
        closeness, the connection, even as the vulnerability in her chest screamed at her to retreat.
  </p>
<p>
   But Rio wasn’t retreating.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t walking away.
  </p>
<p>
   She wasn’t leaving after hearing how fucking broken Agatha was, how much of a mess she’d made of her emotions, of
        her past, of her own damn heart.
  </p>
<p>
   And that realization hit Agatha like a freight train.
  </p>
<p>
   Her breath hitched again, her eyes fluttering closed for a moment as she leaned into Rio’s touch, her good hand
        coming up to rest lightly on Rio’s hip, pulling her closer.
  </p>
<p>
   And when Agatha finally opened her eyes, they met Rio’s, and the raw emotion she saw there almost stole her
        breath.
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t pity.
  </p>
<p>
   It wasn’t judgment.
  </p>
<p>
   It was something so much deeper—
   <em>
    understanding
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s chest tightened, and her voice came out as a whisper, trembling and so fucking fragile.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re still here.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s lips curved into the faintest smile, her thumbs brushing over Agatha’s cheekbones as she replied softly.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re my home too, my love,” she murmured, her dark eyes holding Agatha’s gaze with an intensity that made
        Agatha’s heart stutter. “And I’m not going anywhere.”

   Chapter End Notes
  </p>
<p>
   Not a mugging...dun dun dun.
  </p>
<p>
   Also that whole scene with Agatha punching James Hughes in the face. That scene has been written for like 3 weeks
        just waiting for this chapter lol
  </p>
<p>
   No ILY, but something close to it.
  </p>
<p>
   Hint for next chapter...it will be smutty because words can only heal so much, and with Agatha's dominant hand
        now in a cast...I wonder what "creative" solutions they might come up with for Agatha to be able to touch Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   Queue the Dora Explorer song...

```
Agatha reached up and pulled Rio into a kiss, because God, she needed it.
   </p>
<p>
    All day, the thought had clawed at her—relentless, unbearable —that she had pushed Rio too far. That the woman she loved might not come back to her, that she might never feel Rio’s lips against hers again.
   </p>
<p>
    But Rio was here.
   </p>
<p>
    Still here.
   </p>
<p>
    That fact sent a tremor through Agatha, one she couldn’t contain.
   </p>
<p>
    And the moment her lips found Rio’s, Agatha sighed with relief into her mouth. Her grip tightened on Rio’s shirt, needing something to hold on to, needing her to hold on to.
   </p>
<p>
    The kiss wasn’t like the others.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips moved against hers with a softness that stole the air right out of Agatha’s lungs. For a moment, Agatha didn’t know how to respond—the tenderness was so unfamiliar. This wasn’t the kind of kiss they typically shared, the ones that burned hot with passion and defiance, where they pushed and pulled, each daring the other to surrender.
   </p>
<p>
    No, this kiss was different.
   </p>
<p>
    It was quiet.
   </p>
<p>
    It was careful.
   </p>
<p>
    And it was filled with something deeper—something fragile, precious, and impossibly tender.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a shaky breath into Rio’s mouth, as the realization struck.
   </p>
<p>
    This kiss didn’t feel like just forgiveness.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t just reassurance.
   </p>
<p>
    It felt like
    <em>
     healing.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Every brush of Rio’s lips against hers, every slow, unhurried slide of their tongues, felt like a careful mending of the fractures Agatha had caused between them. The fight from that morning, of course, still lingered like a shadow between them, but this—this kiss—felt like they were molding themselves back together piece by piece.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s chest ached, the weight of it pressing down on her ribs. It was relief and longing, regret and hope all wrapped into one, and it was almost too much. She clutched Rio’s shirt tighter, grounding herself as the kiss deepened, as Rio poured steady reassurance into every movement of her mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s hands stayed on her face, warm and steady, her thumbs still brushing lightly against Agatha’s tear-stained cheeks as though to remind her:
    <em>
     I’m here. I’m not leaving.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    And for a few moments, they stayed like that—pressed close kissing gently. Rio held her like she was something precious, something breakable. It was soft, tender, and everything Agatha didn’t know she needed.
   </p>
<p>
    But as the minutes stretched on, as Rio’s body pressed against her, pinning her gently against the countertop, something inside Agatha shifted.
   </p>
<p>
    She loved the softness.
   </p>
<p>
    She
    <em>
     needed
    </em>
    the softness.
   </p>
<p>
    But now?
   </p>
<p>
    Now she needed more.
   </p>
<p>
    Because as much as Agatha loved the tenderness, the careful way Rio kissed her, she
    <em>
     needed
    </em>
    the heat, the urgency, the wildfire that had always been them. She needed the spark that burned so hot it threatened to consume her entirely.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha tilted her head, deepening the kiss as a quiet hum escaped her throat. Her hand slid down to Rio’s hips, fingers curling into the fabric of her shirt before tugging her closer—
    <em>
     closer
    </em>
    —until there wasn’t an inch of space left between them. Her good hand gripped Rio’s hip possessively, her fingers digging in just enough to leave a mark.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Please
    </em>
    ,” Agatha whispered into Rio’s mouth, her voice low and needy.
   </p>
<p>
    The effect was immediate. Rio’s body tensed for just a moment, as though the word had hit her like a physical touch. Then, with a low exhale, she kissed Agatha again, deeper this time.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a quiet sound again against Rio’s mouth—something between a sigh and a whimper—as the kiss deepened, slow giving way to something hotter. Rio’s lips moved with more purpose now, coaxing and demanding all at once, and Agatha gave in, meeting her with every ounce of pent-up emotion she felt all day.
   </p>
<p>
    The heat between them ignited, spreading through Agatha’s veins like wildfire. Her hand slid up to the back of Rio’s neck, fingers tangling in her dark hair as she tugged, needing her
    <em>
     closer
    </em>
    , needing to feel her
    <em>
     everywhere
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    The second she pulled, it was as though the last shred of control Rio had been holding onto snapped.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s hands gripped her tighter, her touch becoming firm, possessive—
    <em>
     hungry.
    </em>
    Her teeth caught Agatha’s bottom lip, a sharp bite that had Agatha gasping, before Rio soothed it with the slow stroke of her tongue.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha shivered at the contrast, her knees suddenly weak as Rio pressed her harder against the edge of the countertop.
   </p>
<p>
    The bite of the marble dug into the base of Agatha’s spine, but she didn’t care. Not when Rio was kissing her like this, her body fitting against hers perfectly, like she belonged there.
   </p>
<p>
    That familiar coil of want tightened low in Agatha’s stomach—the kind of want that made her ache to shift their positions, to reverse their roles, to push Rio back against the counter and take her right here, right now. She wanted to fuck her on every surface of the damn house until the only thing either of them could think about was
    <em>
     each other.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    But then Agatha’s casted hand shifted instinctively around Rio’s back, and—
    <em>
     damn it
    </em>
    —the flare of pain shot through her wrist, a dull throb radiating up her arm. Her fingers—the ones she frequently favored to fuck Rio with, were trapped in the cast and a frustrated huff slipped out of her mouth against Rio’s lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio stilled immediately, her body still flush against Agatha’s, her breathing heavy as she pulled back just enough to search her face.
   </p>
<p>
    “What’s wrong?” she murmured, her voice rough around the edges.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha groaned in exasperation, letting her head thud lightly against the cabinet behind her.
   </p>
<p>
    “This,” she snapped, holding her casted arm up. “I swear to God, I didn’t regret breaking my hand on Hughes’s face for a
    <em>
     second,
    </em>
    but now—”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips quirked into a crooked smile, despite herself, her hands still steadying Agatha at her waist.
   </p>
<p>
    “Second thoughts, Mayweather?” she teased softly, though her gaze stayed tender.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha narrowed her eyes but couldn’t help the corner of her mouth twitching upward.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Only
    </em>
    because now...I have to teach my left hand how to do what my right hand just learned.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio chuckled lowly, a sound that sent a fresh wave of heat through Agatha’s chest as Rio leaned in again, her lips brushing against the shell of Agatha’s ear.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re resourceful,” Rio whispered, her voice a low hum that curled through Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    She pulled back just slightly, her thumb brushing over Agatha’s bottom lip in a slow, deliberate sweep.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m sure you’ll manage.”
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t just a statement—it was a challenge.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha met Rio’s gaze, and without missing a beat, she bit down gently on Rio’s thumb, trapping it against her teeth. Her lips curved into the barest smirk around Rio’s thumb as her tongue flicked out—slow and
    <em>
     devastatingly familiar.
    </em>
    She dragged the tip of her tongue across Rio’s thumb with the same curling motion she’d use against Rio’s clit, the intention clear— the promise undeniable.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s breath hitched sharply, her body going taut as her dark eyes flared.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha held her gaze, her tongue lingering just enough to provoke—
    <em>
     to dare
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    The sound Rio made was low and feral, something caught between a growl and a moan, and whatever restraint had held Rio back shattered in an instant. She ripped her thumb from Agatha’s mouth, and her hands were gripping Agatha’s hips, pulling her away from the countertop and spinning them around.
   </p>
<p>
    Before Agatha could even catch her breath, Rio had reversed their positions, kissing her with a passion that sent sparks racing down Agatha’s spine. She didn’t relent as she backed Agatha down the hallway, their lips never parting.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha should have known this was coming—she’d
    <em>
     invited
    </em>
    it—but it still caught her by surprise.
   </p>
<p>
    That was Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    All pure power and untamed energy, like a nuclear reactor, always toeing the line between control and implosion, threatening to consume everything in her path.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha tried to keep up—
    <em>
     God, she tried
    </em>
    —but Rio was relentless.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t until Agatha felt the edge of her bed press into the backs of her legs that she realized they were in her bedroom. She didn’t even have time to process it before Rio pushed her down onto the mattress, the impact while soft, still somehow managed to steal what little air she had left.
   </p>
<p>
    And then before she could even recover Rio was on her—literally on her.
   </p>
<p>
    She crawled into Agatha’s lap straddling her without breaking the kiss for even a second. Her hands threaded into Agatha’s hair, pulling and twisting, guiding her,
    <em>
     directing her
    </em>
    like she was something Rio had absolute control over.
   </p>
<p>
    Every pull sent a jolt of electricity through her, and Rio’s hips began to move, rolling slowly into Agatha’s lap with a precision that left her dizzy. Agatha groaned into Rio’s mouth, her good hand sliding down to grip the curve of her ass, fingers digging in possessively.
   </p>
<p>
    The contact earned her a moan from Rio, muffled against her lips but vibrating through her chest like a hum.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Rio
    </em>
    ,” Agatha breathed, her voice ragged as Rio’s lips finally broke away to drag across her jaw.
   </p>
<p>
    Her head tilted back instinctively, her fingers flexing against Rio’s body.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio pulled back just enough to look at her, her dark eyes hooded and wild, her breathing matching Agatha’s in its ragged unevenness. A faint smirk curled at the corner of her lips, but there was nothing teasing about it—no playful edge.
   </p>
<p>
    It was something sharper—something that screamed intent.
   </p>
<p>
    And just when Agatha prepared herself to be devoured again....surprisingly Rio didn’t move.
   </p>
<p>
    Instead, Rio just
    <em>
     looked
    </em>
    at her.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha watched as Rio’s gaze drifted slowly downward, her eyes trailing over the way their bodies were pressed together—her thighs framing Agatha’s lap. Agatha could see the flicker of thought as it moved across Rio’s face, quick and unreadable, but enough to set off something sparking in Agatha’s chest.
   </p>
<p>
    Then Rio looked back up, locking eyes with her, and—
    <em>
     God help her
    </em>
    —there was something devastating in that look. Something that had Agatha’s pulse stuttering, a shiver rolling down her spine.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha could see the words sitting on the edge of Rio’s lips before she literally bit down on her bottom lip, as if she were physically trying to hold back a thought she couldn’t contain. And judging by the feral gleam in her eyes, Agatha knew—she just
    <em>
     knew
    </em>
    —that whatever Rio was thinking, whatever Rio was planning, it was something Agatha would never be prepared for.
   </p>
<p>
    A wave of anticipation hit her like a punch to the chest, but underneath it, buried deep, was the faintest ripple of nervousness.
   </p>
<p>
    Because Agatha understood
    <em>
     exactly
    </em>
    what they were dancing around—what they had been circling since the very beginning.
   </p>
<p>
    The power Rio had when Agatha gave it to her. The control Rio could wield with a look, a touch, a word.
   </p>
<p>
    And the way Agatha would
    <em>
     let her
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    They had only just cracked the surface of this—this
    <em>
     thing
    </em>
    between them. This dynamic, this balance of power that felt so fragile and yet so
    <em>
     right
    </em>
    . There was so much more to explore, to unearth, to lose themselves in.
   </p>
<p>
    “What?” Agatha said finally, her voice unsteady, cracking through the silence because she couldn’t take it anymore. “Do I even want to know what you’re thinking?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk widened, a slow, dangerous curve that sent warning bells and heat sparking through Agatha all at once. Her tongue worked against the inside of her cheek as her gaze locked on Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t answer right away.
   </p>
<p>
    Instead, her fingers moved in Agatha’s hair, nails grazing against her scalp, scratching lightly —just enough to pull at the strands at the base of her neck. The tug sent a sharp jolt down Agatha’s spine, the touch as teasing as it was
    <em>
     powerful
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Rio leaned in closer, her lips just a breath away, the heat of her body curling around Agatha like a vice.
   </p>
<p>
    “Probably not,” Rio murmured, her voice a low, delicious hum that sent heat curling in Agatha’s stomach.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s throat went dry, her entire body taut beneath Rio’s touch.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Oh, she was in trouble.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Tell me anyways,” Agatha whispered, the words barely audible, her voice betraying the flicker of need and curiosity she couldn’t suppress.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio paused, and then she
    <em>
     looked
    </em>
    at her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Really
    </em>
    looked at her.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t just a glance, or a teasing stare—it was the kind of look that stripped her bare. Her breath caught and her pulse pounding in her ears as she held Rio’s gaze, unable to look away.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, without a word, Rio pulled back.
   </p>
<p>
    The loss of her hands, her warmth, her weight, felt sudden and jarring, like the air had been sucked out of the room. And before Agatha could blink, Rio slid off her lap, rising to her feet with the kind of quiet grace that made the movement feel calculated.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha frowned, her brows knitting together in confusion as she watched Rio straighten.
   </p>
<p>
    And then Rio walked out of the room.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t say a word.
   </p>
<p>
    Not one.
   </p>
<p>
    She just... left.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, stunned into silence, her mind stuttering to catch up.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     What the hell?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    For a moment, she sat there, still perched on the edge of her bed, listening to the distant sound of Rio’s footsteps padding down the hallway.
   </p>
<p>
    Then, she heard it—the soft creak of a door opening.
   </p>
<p>
    Her door.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Rio’s room.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her stomach plummeted.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s mind started to spiral, confusion giving way to something far darker.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Was she leaving Agatha?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Was Rio seriously leaving her like this, after kissing her senseless, after working her up and then—
    <em>
     what?
    </em>
    —walking away?
   </p>
<p>
    Rio had been right earlier.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
     Agatha did not like this.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Her jaw tightened, anger bubbling beneath the surface as she tried to process what was happening. She was seconds away from storming down the hall to demand an explanation when she heard it again—the soft thud of Rio’s door closing.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, footsteps. Steady, unhurried footsteps coming back to
    <em>
     her
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her pulse quickening as she sat up straighter, glaring at the doorway like Rio might appear there just to further test her.
   </p>
<p>
    And then there she was.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio leaned casually against the doorframe, as if she hadn’t just left Agatha hanging, her dark eyes locked on Agatha’s with a slow, simmering intensity that made her chest tighten.
   </p>
<p>
    For one long, torturous moment, Agatha was too focused on Rio’s face—the faint smirk playing on her lips, the infuriating calm in her expression—to notice what she was holding.
   </p>
<p>
    But then her gaze dropped.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath caught, her mind stalling completely as she zeroed in on the object dangling loosely from Rio’s fingers at her side.
   </p>
<p>
    That
    <em>
     fucking backpack
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Oh.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Oh.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Rio tilted her head, that infuriating, devastating smirk deepening like she could see every single thought flashing through Agatha’s mind.
   </p>
<p>
    Well... Agatha didn’t hate the idea.
   </p>
<p>
    Not one bit.
   </p>
<p>
    But that didn’t mean she was going to let Rio off the hook without a little snark.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     So
    </em>
    —just to be clear,” Agatha drawled, arching a brow as she leaned back on the bed, propping herself up on her good arm. She forced a casualness into her tone, trying—and failing—to appear nonchalant. “When you receive a death threat and get forced out of your home, your
    <em>
     strap-on
    </em>
    makes the cut as an essential item?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk widened, wicked and unrepentant.
   </p>
<p>
    “Packed it right next to my toothbrush,” she replied smugly.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha snorted before she could stop herself, a sound caught somewhere between laughter and disbelief.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     This woman.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Well,” Agatha said, her lips twitching into a smirk that didn’t quite hide the way her pulse picked up. “At least you’ve got your priorities straight.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t answer right away. Instead, she stepped forward the backpack swinging lazily from her fingers as she closed the distance between them. The room felt smaller with every step she took—every step building something Agatha couldn’t name.
   </p>
<p>
    Anticipation.
   </p>
<p>
    Heat.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Or just fucking Rio.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    And when Rio finally reached the bed, she set the backpack down next to Agatha with an unhurried ease. But then, instead of saying a word, she reached forward and cupped Agatha’s face in both hands, tilting her chin up until their eyes met.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s breath caught in her throat, because Rio’s expression softened—melting from something teasing and predatory into something
    <em>
     so full of love
    </em>
    it made Agatha’s chest ache. It was the kind of look that made her want to reach for Rio and never let go.
   </p>
<p>
    “With you... always, my love,” Rio murmured, her voice low and steady, each word carrying the weight of a promise.
   </p>
<p>
    A shiver ran down Agatha’s spine, sharp and all-consuming, as those words settled deep— curling into her chest like they were meant to live there.
   </p>
<p>
    And suddenly, Agatha wasn’t laughing anymore.
   </p>
<p>
    Her throat bobbed as she swallowed, the overwhelming tightness in her chest making it almost painful to breathe. She had to look away, dropping her gaze to the backpack resting against her legs, afraid that if she met Rio’s eyes any longer, her ribs might crack under the pressure.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s fingers fell away from her face, and Agatha busied herself with playing with the zipper pull until she found her words.
   </p>
<p>
    “What made you think I wouldn’t like this?” Agatha finally asked, her voice soft but teasing —anything to steady herself. She forced the emotions clawing at her chest back into place and looked back up at Rio, lifting a brow. “I think the last time we did
    <em>
     this—
    </em>
    I was very much in the
    <em>
     ‘yes’
    </em>
    category for a repeat performance.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio smiled—warm, genuine—but there was a flicker of something else beneath it.
   </p>
<p>
    Was that hesitation?
   </p>
<p>
    “Open it,” Rio said quietly.
   </p>
<p>
    The moment felt like déjà vu, except this time Agatha wasn’t bracing herself for what was inside as if disarming a pipe bomb.
   </p>
<p>
    She
    <em>
     knew
    </em>
    what was inside.
   </p>
<p>
    But then she sent a hesitant look to Rio—
    <em>
     or at least, she thought she knew what was inside.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    She reached for the backpack, struggling for a moment with her one good hand until she managed to work the zipper open. Her brow furrowed as she glanced inside, and then she froze.
   </p>
<p>
    Her brain registered what she was looking at, but it still took her a beat to process it. Slowly, she looked back up at Rio, questioning, but Rio just stood there, perfectly still, her gaze unwavering.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Of course.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha exhaled through her nose, glanced back into the bag, and reached inside.
   </p>
<p>
    The black leather straps were familiar, but the
    <em>
     dildo
    </em>
    —that was new.
   </p>
<p>
    Gone was the intimidating black silicone Rio had once fucked her with.
   </p>
<p>
    And in its place was something undeniably different.
   </p>
<p>
    Purple.
   </p>
<p>
    A striking color that contrasted starkly against the leather harness. It was slightly smaller, more approachable in size, yet no less prominent.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, Agatha could only stare at it, her good hand holding it up as though she were trying to reconcile what she was seeing with what she
    <em>
     knew
    </em>
    . Finally, she looked back at Rio, her brow arching despite the tightness that had returned to her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    “Is this because purple’s my favorite color?” Agatha asked, aiming for nonchalance, but the slight tremor in her voice betrayed her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smile widened.
   </p>
<p>
    “I thought you’d appreciate the color,” she murmured, her voice low and edged with amusement.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha barely had time to quirk an eyebrow before Rio’s expression shifted, the playful smirk softening into something deeper, something that made Agatha’s breath catch.
   </p>
<p>
    “I got it for you,” Rio said, her tone steady.
   </p>
<p>
    The simplicity of the statement was its power, and it landed with weight.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha froze, her breath hitching at the weight in Rio’s tone. There was something
    <em>
     more
    </em>
    there—something unspoken yet impossible to miss. Agatha’s eyes narrowed slightly as she searched Rio’s face—
    <em>
     waiting—
    </em>
    needing her to finish.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio held her gaze for a beat longer, steadying herself. Then she took a step closer, close enough that Agatha could feel the heat rolling off her.
   </p>
<p>
    “I got it for you...” Rio repeated, her voice low and soft, as though each word was carefully chosen.
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, just long enough for Agatha’s pulse to quicken, before she continued.
   </p>
<p>
    “To wear—for me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s chest tightened and her brain stuttered over Rio’s words as they sank in. She felt pinned beneath Rio’s gaze, her words and gaze almost palpable.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     For her.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her fingers curling tighter around the leather straps as heat coiled low in her stomach, sharp and undeniable. The weight of Rio’s words lingered in the air as her mind scrambled for something—
    <em>
     anything
    </em>
    . And when all else failed, she leaned into the one thing that had always been her armor.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Humor.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha arched a brow, her lips curving faintly into what she hoped was a confident smirk as she managed with fake offense.
   </p>
<p>
    “Why is mine smaller?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio blinked, momentarily caught off guard, before her smirk returned—slow, devastating, and entirely too smug.
   </p>
<p>
    “I thought size didn’t matter,” she teased, her voice dripping with mock innocence. “I’m sure you’ll make up for it... somehow.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out an incredulous
    <em>
     pfft
    </em>
    , shooting Rio a pointed glare even as the nervous flutter coiled tighter in her stomach.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha wasn’t expecting
    <em>
     this
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    She wasn’t prepared.
   </p>
<p>
    And that, no doubt, was exactly where Rio wanted her.
   </p>
<p>
    She dangled the harness from her fingertips, staring at it like it might grow teeth and bite her before setting it to the side on the bed.
   </p>
<p>
    “I don’t even know where to begin with using something like this... on you,” she admitted, her voice quieter, a little unsteady.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s smirk softened into something even more dangerous. She stepped closer, invading Agatha’s space, until their bodies were nearly touching.
   </p>
<p>
    “I just need you to wear it, darling,” Rio murmured, her voice a low hum that sent shivers racing down Agatha’s spine. “I can do all the work.”
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Oh.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her heart slamming against her ribs as Rio’s words curled around her —and then through her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Well, damn.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Rio smirked, watching as the realization flickered across Agatha’s face, the dots connecting one by one.
   </p>
<p>
    “What do you say, Agatha?” Rio murmured, her voice threaded with a dark—silky challenge —nearly breathless with anticipation. She leaned in close—
    <em>
     so close
    </em>
    that Agatha could feel the heat of her breath ghosting over her ear.
   </p>
<p>
    “Will you wear that for me... and let me fuck myself on it—
    <em>
     on you
    </em>
    ?”
   </p>
<p>
    The world tilted.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s stomach bottomed out, the weight of Rio’s words hitting her with a force that stole the air from her lungs. She gripped the leather straps tighter in her hand as if holding onto them could somehow keep her grounded.
   </p>
<p>
    But she wasn’t grounded—she felt like she was floating with no sense of control.
   </p>
<p>
    She opened her mouth, tried to summon her trademark wit, the sharp retort Rio usually dragged out of her so effortlessly.
   </p>
<p>
    But nothing came.
   </p>
<p>
    Certainly, not with Rio’s words lingering in the air like a tangible thing, a touch, a promise— something that painted itself across her mind in vivid,
    <em>
     intoxicating
    </em>
    detail.
   </p>
<p>
    Heat coiled low and sharp between her legs making her thighs press together instinctively. The image formed in her head with startling clarity—Rio straddling her, moving against her, taking what she wanted—
    <em>
     Agatha’s
    </em>
    hand on Rio’s hips, holding her steady, guiding her to orgasm—holding her after.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck...” Agatha breathed, the word slipping out on a ragged exhale, her voice lower than she intended, almost reverent.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio tilted her head slightly, satisfaction flaring across her face like taking Agatha's breathless whisper for exactly what it was—
    <em>
     acceptance
    </em>
    . Her smirk softened into something more dangerous, as she let her eyes drift from Agatha’s face to the harness still clutched in her hand.
   </p>
<p>
    She stepped closer—agonizingly close—her body now brushing against Agatha’s knees where they bent at the edge of the bed. Slowly, Rio leaned down until her lips hovered over Agatha’s.
   </p>
<p>
    “We’ll get to
    <em>
     that
    </em>
    , baby,” she whispered, the words sinking past Agatha’s lips and down her throat, like molten heat.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio straightened just enough to meet Agatha’s gaze again, her expression nothing short of devastating.
   </p>
<p>
    “But you’ve got to put it on first.”
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     This fucking woman.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her gaze locked on Rio’s, the air between them crackling with tension so thick it felt suffocating. Slowly, her good hand reached up and curled around the back of Rio’s neck. Her fingers threaded through the soft strands at the base of Rio’s neck— just enough to tease, just enough to make Rio’s breath hitch.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes, searched Rio’s face as she leaned in. She let the silence stretch, let Rio feel the weight of the moment that she herself created but also allowed her more time to gather her own courage, before licking her lips and finally murmuring softly—
   </p>
<p>
    “Go lock the door.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stood in front of the bed, her arms crossed over her chest as if she could physically shield herself from the overwhelming awkwardness pressing down on her. This had to be one of the most uncomfortable moments of her life—or at least, that’s what she told herself.
   </p>
<p>
    But then Rio, in her endless ability to disarm, had to open her mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    “Relax,” Rio said with a sly grin, reclining casually on the edge of the bed. “I’ll handle the bottom half. You just focus on the top.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes, the dry humor taking the edge off her nerves for half a second—until Rio took her words literally.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t just take over.
   </p>
<p>
    She owned the moment.
   </p>
<p>
    Sitting on the edge of the bed, she reached for Agatha, her hands firm but careful as she pulled her closer. Agatha stiffened, her skin prickling as the awkwardness returned with the intensity of a thousand suns. When Rio’s fingers hooked into the waistband of her pants and, without ceremony, began sliding them down her hips, Agatha’s entire body went rigid.
   </p>
<p>
    “Jesus Christ,” Agatha muttered, half under her breath, her hands twitching as though she didn’t know whether to stop Rio or help her.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio, of course, was completely unfazed.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t stop, didn’t pause, just kept going with the kind of calm, surgical precision that should have been illegal in moments like this. Agatha’s pants hit the floor, quickly followed by her underwear, and suddenly, she was standing there—completely bare from the waist down—while Rio reached for the harness on the bed like this was the most normal thing in the world.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t.
   </p>
<p>
    It so wasn’t.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s skin prickled like the awkwardness was a physical force pressing down on her, but Rio didn’t seem affected by it at all. She moved with purpose, her fingers deftly undoing buckles and adjusting straps, her expression focused.
   </p>
<p>
    And then it happened.
   </p>
<p>
    The brush of warm lips against Agatha’s hip bone.
   </p>
<p>
    Her breath hitched, the unexpected touch knocking the air clean out of her lungs. The awkwardness, the self-consciousness, all of it melted under the heat of that kiss. Agatha looked down, her chest heaving, only to find Rio looking up at her with a smirk curling at the edges of her mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    Her lips lingered on Agatha’s skin, pressing another kiss just as her fingers continued to work at the buckles of the harness.
   </p>
<p>
    Her lips lingered on Agatha’s skin, warm and soft, pressing kisses along the curve of her hip. Agatha’s breath hitched again when Rio’s lips trailed lower, brushing along her stomach, her other hip, and then just above her pubic bone. The heat of Rio’s mouth against her skin was electric, sending sharp sparks shooting up her spine.
   </p>
<p>
    And Rio, damn her, didn’t even pause.
   </p>
<p>
    Her fingers worked with a practiced ease, the cool leather of the straps brushing against Agatha’s thighs. She murmured softly as she adjusted the buckles, her voice low and soothing, a counterbalance to the fire she was igniting with her kisses.
   </p>
<p>
    “This one goes here,” Rio said, her words brushing against Agatha’s skin as she kissed the edge of her stomach. Her fingers slid one strap into place, tugging gently before buckling it.
   </p>
<p>
    “And this strap,” another kiss, just above her thigh, “is going to make sure everything stays in place.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a shuddering breath, her hand instinctively reaching out, her fingers threading through Rio’s hair. She wasn’t sure if she was trying to ground herself or pull Rio closer.
   </p>
<p>
    Maybe both.
   </p>
<p>
    “Just for the record,” Agatha managed, her voice unsteady, “I’m not absorbing a single thing you’re saying.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio chuckled softly against her skin, the sound low and wicked, vibrating against Agatha’s hip and sending another sharp jolt of heat spiraling through her body.
   </p>
<p>
    “Noted,” Rio murmured, her lips brushing the curve of Agatha’s hip before her teeth grazed the sensitive skin. She bit down gently, enough to have Agatha hissing, her fingers tightening in Rio’s hair.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio soothed the bite with her tongue, sending another shiver down Agatha’s spine. Her fingers worked the last buckle with practiced ease, and then she pulled back, her mouth and hands falling away. Rio’s eyes dropped, taking in the strap now secured between Agatha’s legs, her gaze dark and feral.
   </p>
<p>
    God, this should be awkward.
   </p>
<p>
    It should be awkward as hell, but the look in Rio’s eyes—the way her lips parted slightly, her chest rising and falling a little faster—had Agatha swallowing hard.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio dragged her eyes back up, slowly, purposefully, and smirked when her gaze landed on Agatha’s still-buttoned white dress shirt.
   </p>
<p>
    “What happened to you handling the top half?” she teased, her voice low, warm, and edged with amusement.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha mustered every ounce of composure she had left, glaring mockingly at Rio despite the heat coiling low in her belly.
   </p>
<p>
    “I was busy trying not to run out of the room,” she deadpanned, though her lips twitched at the corners.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio snorted at that before leaning back on her hands, propping herself up with a lazy grace that was anything but casual.
   </p>
<p>
    “Just so you know...you running around in your dress shirt, bare-assed, with a purple strap bouncing between your legs is now permanently burned into my brain,” Rio quipped, her smirk widening.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes, but her heart raced at the teasing lilt in Rio’s tone, her good hand moving to her hip in a faux gesture of defiance.
   </p>
<p>
    “Glad I could leave a lasting impression,” she retorted, though the corner of her mouth betrayed a smirk.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes glinted as she sat up slightly, her voice dropping into a huskier tone.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, Agatha—trust me. You always leave more than an impression on me.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words hit Agatha square in the chest, her heart stuttering in response.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio tilted her head slightly, a small, knowing smile playing at her lips before she stood and reached for Agatha’s hips. In one smooth motion, Rio reversed their positions, now standing in front of Agatha while still maintaining control of the moment. Her hands moved to Agatha’s shirt, fingers brushing over the fabric as she began unbuttoning it with deliberate slowness. It was maddeningly intentional, every movement drawn out as though Rio wanted to savor the anticipation.
   </p>
<p>
    By the time Rio reached the last button, Agatha’s breathing was uneven, her pulse a drumbeat in her ears. Rio carefully slipped the shirt from Agatha’s shoulders, mindful of the cast on her arm, leaving her standing there in nothing but her cream-colored lace bra.
   </p>
<p>
    Of course, Rio’s gaze dropped immediately to her chest—fixated in a way that was both endearing and undeniably heated. Agatha might have teased her about it if she weren’t just as bad. But as Rio’s eyes began to roam, mapping the expanse of her skin, the heat shifted.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s expression changed, her brows knitting together as something flickered in her eyes— confusion, then worry.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha followed her gaze, trailing down her own arm until she saw it.
   </p>
<p>
    A bruise, dark and unmistakable, wrapping around her bicep in the clear outline of a hand.
   </p>
<p>
    James Hughes.
   </p>
<p>
    The memory came rushing back—the way he’d grabbed her in the courthouse hallway, his grip hard enough to make her wince. She hadn’t even realized he’d left a bruise. At the time, she’d been too consumed with rage, too focused on delivering that satisfying punch, and later, too distracted by her broken hand to notice anything else.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s jaw tightened, her fingers brushing lightly over the mark.
   </p>
<p>
    “He did this,” she said, her voice low and simmering with anger.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t a question.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed, her hand coming up to Rio’s wrist, holding it gently.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s nothing,” she said, attempting to dismiss it, but the way Rio’s gaze darkened told her that wasn’t going to fly.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s not nothing,” Rio said, her tone sharp pulling her hand from Agatha’s light grip, before reaching forward and lightly dragging her fingers across Agatha’s arm as though she could erase the bruise through sheer willpower. “He put his hands on you.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio...” Agatha started, her voice softer now, attempting to soothe, to get ahead of whatever storm was brewing behind that glare.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s nostrils flared as she let out a sharp, audible breath through her nose, cutting Agatha off before she could say more. Her jaw was clenched so tight that Agatha swore she could hear her teeth grinding, a sound that made her wince more than the bruise on her arm.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, Rio didn’t say anything, her eyes fixed on the darkened mark on Agatha’s skin. When she finally spoke, her voice was low, controlled, but trembling at the edges with suppressed rage.
   </p>
<p>
    “Do you have any idea how lucky he is that you got to him first?” Rio said, her words measured but carrying the weight of a promise—a threat that sent a shiver racing down Agatha’s spine.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the sheer ferocity in Rio’s tone. She opened her mouth to respond, but Rio didn’t give her the chance.
   </p>
<p>
    “No,” Rio continued, her eyes snapping up to meet Agatha’s, the intensity in them making it impossible to look away. “Because if I had been there, if I had seen him lay a hand on you...” Her voice trailed off, her hands curling into fists at her sides as she visibly tried to reign herself in.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio,” Agatha tried again, her voice softer now, trying to pull her out of the dark place she was clearly teetering on. She reached out with her good hand, her fingers brushing gently against Rio’s arm.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio let out another sharp breath, this one trembling as her fists slowly unclenched. She looked down at Agatha’s hand on her arm, then back at her, her eyes softening just enough to remind Agatha of the woman beneath all that fire.
   </p>
<p>
    She swallowed hard, her voice faltering for just a moment.
   </p>
<p>
    “I can’t stand the thought of someone doing that to you.
    <em>
     Ever
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a slow, measured breath, her chest tightening as the memories of just days ago came flooding back—the sheer terror, the helpless rage, the image of Rio bleeding, wounded, from the mugging-turned-hit.
   </p>
<p>
    She knew exactly how Rio was feeling.
   </p>
<p>
    The anger coursing through her wasn’t foreign—it was all too familiar.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha reached up, her fingers ghosting over the stitches still healing on Rio’s brow. Her touch was feather-light, reverent, tracing the edges of the wound.
   </p>
<p>
    “Trust me, my love,” she murmured softly, her voice barely above a whisper. “I know exactly how you’re feeling right now.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her words seemed to pull Rio’s attention, her dark eyes softening as they searched Agatha’s face. Agatha felt the weight of that gaze, the love and worry intertwined with something deeper—something primal, protective, and unrelenting. It was the same feeling that had driven her to punch James Hughes without hesitation.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s hand came up to cover Agatha’s, holding it for a moment before pulling it away.
   </p>
<p>
    The moment lingered, quiet and charged, until Agatha finally let out a small, genuine smile that edged toward a smirk.
   </p>
<p>
    “Now,” she said dryly, her voice laced with deadpan humor, “can we please get back to the part where you fuck yourself on this ridiculous purple cock now strapped to my body?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio froze for half a beat, her eyes going wide with surprise before a laugh erupted from her— a real, genuine laugh that echoed through the room, breaking through the tension that had weighed them both down. It was warm and bright, and it melted the somberness that had threatened to swallow them whole.
   </p>
<p>
    “Oh, my God,” Rio muttered, shaking her head as her laughter softened into something more private, her dark eyes glinting with amusement and heat.
   </p>
<p>
    She stepped closer, her smile turning wicked as she reached forward and pressed two fingers against Agatha’s breastbone, pushing her back with just enough force to guide her. Agatha moved willingly, her legs hitting the bed until she was sitting on the edge, staring up at Rio with a raised brow that dared her to make her next move.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio met that challenge without hesitation, her gaze darkening as she took a step back. And then—without a word—she reached for the hem of her shirt and stripped it off with a fluid motion.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha barely had time to process that before Rio’s hands moved to her waistband, shoving her pants down in a motion so quick and efficient it left Agatha momentarily stunned. In the
   </p>
<p>
    span of seconds, Rio was standing in front of her completely bare, radiating confidence and power.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s mouth went dry.
   </p>
<p>
    This woman was fucking beautiful.
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze swept over Rio’s body, lingering on every line, every curve, every inch of radiant, flawless skin. But it wasn’t just Rio’s physical beauty that left Agatha breathless—it was the way she carried herself. There was an unapologetic boldness in her stance, a confidence so magnetic that it made Agatha’s pulse race. And then there were her eyes, dark and locked on Agatha with an intensity that felt like a physical touch, pulling her in.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s voice came out low, almost pleading, as she murmured—
   </p>
<p>
    “Come here.”
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t have to say it twice. Rio moved without hesitation, closing the distance between them with fluid grace. In an instant, she was in Agatha’s lap, straddling her, and the warmth of her body pressed against Agatha’s own sent a jolt of electricity through her.
   </p>
<p>
    And then Rio’s lips were on hers, the kiss crashing down with all the force of a tidal wave. It was wild, consuming, the kind of kiss that demanded everything and gave just as much in return. Agatha’s arms moved instinctively, wrapping around Rio and pulling her closer— needing her—
    <em>
     needing this.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha claimed Rio’s lips in a rough, desperate kiss, her good hand gripping her hip with bruising intensity as if anchoring Rio to her. Then, she pulled back, her mouth trailing down Rio’s jawline, her teeth grazing just enough to pull a sharp inhale from her. Agatha’s lips found the curve of Rio’s neck, biting and sucking with a ferocity that left no room for doubt.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t seem to mind.
   </p>
<p>
    Her hips canted forward instinctively, rolling against Agatha and pressing the strap perfectly against Agatha’s clit. The friction was enough to drag a guttural moan from both of them, Rio’s sound low and gravelly, Agatha’s sharper, edged with need.
   </p>
<p>
    That contact ignited something primal in Agatha. The heat in her blood roared to life, driving her movements as her mouth slid lower, her lips and teeth finding the swell of Rio’s breast. She kissed, licked, and bit with precision, the way she knew Rio craved. She alternated between soft pulls and sharp nips, drawing out gasps and groans that had Rio trembling against her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck,” Rio hissed, her voice low and reverent, her fingers threading into Agatha’s hair and holding it up so she could watch. She didn’t just want to feel Agatha—she wanted to see her, to savor the sight of her mouth working over her nipples, of her lips swollen and red as they dragged across Rio’s skin.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s hips kept moving, grinding into the strap, sending jolts of sensation through both of them. The way she murmured, her words incoherent but full of heat, only spurred Agatha on. She closed her teeth lightly around one nipple, tugging just enough to have Rio’s head falling back with a sharp groan.
   </p>
<p>
    “Jesus, Agatha,” Rio rasped, her voice shaky and raw, her body arching into Agatha’s mouth as if she couldn’t get enough.
   </p>
<p>
    Neither ocould Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Every sound, every movement, every moan lit her up, and she was determined to give Rio and her everything she needed—and more.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s fingers slid away from Agatha’s hair, one hand moving with purpose as she lifted herself from Agatha’s lap. Agatha could feel her breath catch as Rio’s hand wrapped around the purple silicone, her grip firm.
   </p>
<p>
    The sight sent a jolt through Agatha—something unexpected, something primal—that settled low in her stomach, coiling tight.
   </p>
<p>
    “Wait—shouldn’t we get lube?” Agatha blurted, her voice uncharacteristically shaky.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t answer with words.
   </p>
<p>
    Instead, she released her hold on the strap and reached for Agatha’s left hand, guiding it between her legs. The second Agatha’s fingers brushed against her, both of them groaned.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio was soaked—so impossibly, undeniably ready—and the realization sent a wave of heat crashing through Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “No, my love,” Rio murmured, her lips brushing the shell of Agatha’s ear, her voice low— dripping with a desire that Agatha could feel against her fingers. “We definitely don’t need lube.”
   </p>
<p>
    It was enough to make Agatha’s head spin and her hand, already poised between Rio’s thighs, moved instinctively. Her fingers slid through the wet heat again and even with her less- dominant hand, she still managed to find enough control to circle Rio’s clit.
   </p>
<p>
    The sound that spilled from Rio’s lips—a soft, breathy mewl—was both devastatingly hot and heartbreakingly tender. It struck a chord deep within Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “God, Rio,” Agatha murmured, her voice rough, almost breaking under the weight of her own desire. Her fingers swirled again, finding just the right rhythm, and Rio’s hips bucked, pressing harder into her touch.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck—Agatha,” Rio moaned, her voice raw and needy, before reaching between them and grabbing the silicone again. Her movements were unhurried yet commanding, and the sheer control she exuded sent a new wave of heat pooling low in Agatha’s stomach.
   </p>
<p>
    “Keep your fingers right there,” Rio said, her voice thick with want, her words nearly a plea but laced with an undeniable authority. “Can you do that for me, baby?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha barely had time to nod, her mind spinning, before she felt the pull of the silicone harness, the slight shift as Rio adjusted it, aligning it just right.
   </p>
<p>
    Time seemed to suspend, every second dragging out as anticipation coursed through her.
   </p>
<p>
    And she knew she had a choice—a fleeting, dizzying decision.
   </p>
<p>
    Should she look down and watch as Rio took the silicone inside her?
   </p>
<p>
    Or should she keep her eyes locked on Rio’s face, drinking in every reaction to Rio taking her?
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha chose the latter, her breath hitching as she tilted her head up slightly, her gaze locking onto Rio’s face.
   </p>
<p>
    And
    <em>
     fuck
    </em>
    —it was the right choice.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s features shifted, her lips parting as her eyes fluttered closed for a heartbeat before snapping open again, locking onto Agatha with an intensity that felt almost tangible. Her gaze was fire and hunger and something so deeply intimate it threatened to undo Agatha entirely.
   </p>
<p>
    And when Rio rolled her hips—slowly, testing, teasing, taking—Agatha watched the cascade of reactions ripple across her face. A sharp inhale, a slight quiver of her lips, a flicker of something raw and vulnerable giving way to unrestrained desire.
   </p>
<p>
    It was mesmerizing.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha forced her fingers to remain, still moving, still working, and the sound that tore from Rio’s throat—a low, guttural moan—shot straight through her, igniting every nerve in her body.
   </p>
<p>
    “God, you feel so good,” Rio murmured, her voice trembling, and Agatha couldn’t tear her eyes away. She wanted to memorize every second of this moment, the way Rio’s head tilted back slightly, her throat exposed, her body arching into Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    It was intoxicating, overwhelming, and Agatha was utterly, completely undone.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rio...” Agatha groaned, her voice catching, raw and desperate, as Rio moved with precision. The slow, purposeful roll of her hips sent the strap pressing perfectly against Agatha’s clit, the friction igniting every nerve ending and stealing the air from her lungs.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck,” Agatha gasped, her hips arching instinctively, chasing the sensation, the overwhelming pleasure blurring the edges of her thoughts.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s response was instant—a deep, guttural groan that vibrated against Agatha’s lips as their bodies found a rhythm. Her movements grew more insistent, her hands bracing against
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s shoulders for leverage as she ground down, every motion wringing more sounds of raw pleasure from them both.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha somehow still managed to keep pace with her fingers, circling—building up in pressure and intensity with every roll of Rio’s lips.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s head tipped back for a moment, her moan spilling into the air, rich and unrestrained.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Agatha
    </em>
    ,” Rio cried, her voice trembling with need, her hips grinding down harder.
   </p>
<p>
    The sound—raw, unguarded—was the hottest thing Agatha had ever heard. But the haze of pleasure flickered as a thought pierced through.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     They were going to wake Nicky.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Rio seemed to realize it at the same time. Without missing a beat, she leaned down, crashing their mouths together. The kiss was frantic and consuming, Rio’s lips muffling her cries, her moans, her gasps of pleasure, each sound now swallowed by Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha suddenly became acutely aware of her own orgasm looming closer, like a storm gathering on the horizon. She could feel it—a low rumble deep within her, building with every grind of Rio’s hips. The pressure coiled tighter, electric and unrelenting but she wasn’t going to let go—not yet.
   </p>
<p>
    She needed Rio to fall first.
   </p>
<p>
    “Look at you,” Agatha rasped, her voice low and rough, thick with desire. Her fingers pressed and circled faster, perfectly matching the rhythm of Rio’s hips as they rolled against her. “So fucking perfect, baby. Taking me so well.”
   </p>
<p>
    The words surprised her—Agatha wasn’t usually one for dirty talk. She preferred letting Rio take the lead there, savoring the filthy, breathless things Rio murmured into her ear. But something about this moment, about the way Rio looked above her, wild and vulnerable all at once, made her want to try. To see if her words would have the same effect Rio’s always did to her.
   </p>
<p>
    It turned out... they did.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio whimpered, the sound raw and needy, her head falling forward until her forehead pressed against Agatha’s. Rio’ s hips stuttered for the briefest second, as if her body had momentarily short-circuited under the weight of Agatha’s words, before finding their rhythm again, her movements even more desperate than before.
   </p>
<p>
    “You like this, don’t you?” Agatha continued, her voice dipping lower. “Feeling me inside you like this?”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio moaned.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” she whimpered, the sound high and breathless, her hands gripping Agatha’s shoulders for stability as her movements grew more desperate, more erratic.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re trembling,” Agatha continued, her words a seductive purr. “Y ou’re right there, aren’t you, my love?”
   </p>
<p>
    “Please...please...please,” Rio pleaded, her voice breaking on the syllables, her hips bucking into Agatha almost violently.
   </p>
<p>
    “Let go for me,” Agatha commanded.
   </p>
<p>
    Her fingers worked Rio’s clit faster, circling and pressing in just the way she knew would send her over the edge. At the same time, her hips rolled up into Rio’s, driving the strap deeper, harder, pulling a guttural moan from both of them.
   </p>
<p>
    “Come for me,” Agatha growled, her voice raw and unrelenting. “I want to feel you. Let me have it, Rio.”
   </p>
<p>
    And then Agatha felt it—the way Rio tensed all at once, her body locking up as her orgasm hit her like a tidal wave. The raw cry that tore from Rio’s throat was loud—
    <em>
     too loud
    </em>
    —and Agatha reacted on instinct, her hand leaving Rio’s clit to curl behind her neck, pulling her forward into a kiss. She swallowed the scream that ripped from Rio’s mouth, the sound vibrating between them as Rio’s trembling body collapsed onto her.
   </p>
<p>
    They fell back onto the bed together, Rio’s weight settling atop her as Agatha worked her hips up, driving the strap deeper, feeling the resistance that wasn’t there before.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha groaned into Rio’s mouth, her own need teetering dangerously close to the edge.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s hips rolled again, jerky and uncoordinated, rolling back against Agatha’s in desperate, shuddering movements. Her sighs and moans poured into Agatha’s mouth, hot and ragged, and it was too much—the sounds, the way Rio clung to her, the slick, startling wetness—that Agatha was suddenly aware of only heightened every sensation.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fuck,” Agatha gasped into the kiss, her body arching as the tension snapped inside her, sending her spiraling. Her hips stuttered, pressing up hard against Rio as the orgasm crashed through her, her cries mingling with Rio’s in the heat of their mouths.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio trembled on top of her, her fingers tangled in Agatha’s hair, her breaths ragged as they both rode the waves of pleasure together. Their bodies moved in sync, trembling and clinging, until the last shudders faded into stillness.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let out a long, shaky breath, her head falling back against the mattress as Rio slumped against her, warm and soft and utterly spent. For a few moments, neither of them spoke, the only sound in the room the unsteady rhythm of their breathing as they came back to themselves.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s hand lifted, her fingers threading gently through Rio’s damp hair, her lips brushing a soft kiss against Rio’s temple. It was a simple gesture, but it carried a quiet intimacy that made Agatha’s chest ache in the best way.
   </p>
<p>
    Eventually, Rio sighed softly, her body shifting as she sat up. She moved with the grace of someone entirely drained, sliding off Agatha’s lap and collapsing beside face down on the bed with a groan.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned her head, her gaze lazily sweeping over Rio’s utterly wrecked form—her flushed skin, her tousled hair, the rise and fall of her back with every breath.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha dragged her eyes away, and drifted down her own body, catching the obscene amount of wetness glistening on her own stomach and the purple silicone gleaming with evidence of Rio’s release.
   </p>
<p>
    She smirked, the teasing lighting up her voice before the words even formed.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, would you look at that,” Agatha drawled.
   </p>
<p>
    One of Rio’s eyes cracked open, narrowing in suspicion as she turned her head toward Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s smirk widened, leaning into the taunt.
   </p>
<p>
    “Christmas came early again,” she quipped, her grin widening at her own audacity.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s open eye rolled dramatically before narrowing again, and she let out an exaggerated huff.
   </p>
<p>
    “You are horrible,” Rio muttered, though the corner of her mouth betrayed the faintest twitch of amusement.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha opened her mouth to deliver what was undoubtedly going to be another smug remark, but before she could get a single word out, a pillow smacked her square in the face.

<p>
   The following morning, Agatha found herself sitting on the couch. Still clad in her purple silk robe and her
        hair a mess. She hummed, as her hands cradled a warm mug of coffee emblazoned with the words " Big Witch Energy
        ." It was a Christmas gift from Jen, who had thought herself particularly clever.
  </p>
<p>
   The couch shifted beneath her as a body slid into the seat next to her. Agatha turned and her gaze landed on Rio.
        She was wearing Agatha’s mink kimono robe—the one with a botanical print that stopped mid-thigh. And when Rio
        crossed her legs, Agatha’s traitorous eyes followed the movement, tracing the bare expanse of skin exposed. Her
        mind immediately flooded with memories of how soft that skin felt—against her hands, her lips, her tongue.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio cleared her throat.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes shot upward, and she froze—caught.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s dark eyes were locked on hers, amusement dancing in them, and her lips curved into a slow, knowing smirk as
        she sipped from her mug—a mug that said “ Dissent” in bold letters, featuring an illustration of Ruth Bader
        Ginsburg flipping a double bird.
  </p>
<p>
   The look in Rio’s eyes told Agatha she knew exactly where Agatha’s mind had wandered.
  </p>
<p>
   And suddenly, the warmth blooming in Agatha’s chest wasn’t just from the coffee.
  </p>
<p>
   Before she could say anything, a loud bang broke through the quiet. She jumped, startled, as a child’s voice rang
        out in dramatic authority.
  </p>
<p>
   “I call this family meeting to order!”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sighed, long and heavy.
  </p>
<p>
   Of course, her son had inherited her flair for dramatics.
  </p>
<p>
   She turned her attention away from Rio and toward the dining chair that Nicky had dragged into the middle of the
        living room. He sat perched on it in his Bluey pajamas, holding a bright yellow plastic hammer that he was
        enthusiastically banging on her coffee table.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Bang.
   </em>
<em>
    Bang.
   </em>
<em>
    Bang.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha winced.
  </p>
<p>
   There not enough coffee in the world making
   <em>
    that sound
   </em>
   bearable at 6:00 AM.
  </p>
<p>
   “Nicky, you’re going to dent the table,” she said, her tone more matter-of-fact than scolding, though she arched
        her eyebrow in warning.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky, in true Agatha fashion, completely ignored her. But he did—
   <em>
    by the grace of god—
   </em>
   set the hammer
        down. Nicky leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms his blue eyes moving between Agatha and Rio with a look
        so reminiscent of Agatha’s own that it was uncanny.
  </p>
<p>
   Out of the corner of her eye, Agatha saw Rio’s lips twitch as a small snort of laughter escaped. She masked it
        quickly, coughing into her mug, but it was too late. Both Agatha and Nicky turned sharp, narrowed gazes on her
        at the same time.
  </p>
<p>
   “Sorry—frog in my throat,” Rio murmured innocently, though the amusement in her eyes betrayed her.
  </p>
<p>
   She took a slow sip of her coffee, then gave Nicky an encouraging nod.
  </p>
<p>
   “Please, Judge, continue.”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky straightened in his chair, visibly puffing up with importance at Rio’s acknowledgment.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha couldn’t decide whether to laugh or roll her eyes at the display.
  </p>
<p>
   “It has come to my attention...” Nicky began, his voice serious.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    God help her.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The kid was six.
  </p>
<p>
   Who even talks like that?
  </p>
<p>
   “...that safety procedures are not being followed,” he finished, his sharp gaze shifting between Rio’s stitched
        brow and Agatha’s casted arm.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha barely resisted the urge to groan.
  </p>
<p>
   The second Nicky saw her arm in a cast this morning, he had, of course, been worried. But once she’d explained—
   <em>
    lied
   </em>
   —and told him she fell at work, his concern quickly morphed into the complete opposite end of the
        spectrum.
  </p>
<p>
   Enter:
   <em>
    the family meeting.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agatha was no stranger to these meetings—after all, she’d called a few herself to talk through big things with
        him—his diagnosis, the divorce, bad days at school, his favorite tv show being cancelled. But she certainly
        hadn’t expected him to pull an uno reverse card and not only schedule one for her but make Rio attend as well.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio shot Agatha an amused side-eye as she took another sip of her coffee, clearly enjoying every second of this.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, already feeling the weight of her son’s righteous indignation bearing down
        on her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Nicky... they were accidents, honey—”
  </p>
<p>
   Her attempt at reasoning was immediately cut off by her son’s dramatic retort.
  </p>
<p>
   “When I cut my knee open at the playground this summer, you gave me a whole speech on way home about
        responsibility,” Nicky reminded.
  </p>
<p>
   He leaned forward, his voice shifting into an exaggerated impression of hers.
  </p>
<p>
   “‘
   <em>
    You only get one body, Nicholas—you need to take care of it.
   </em>
   ’ Remember that, Mom? Because I do.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked at him, a mix of disbelief and begrudging admiration flickering across her face. The little
        monster had not only an impeccable memory but also a talent for turning her own words into ammunition.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay—yes,” Agatha conceded, lifting her hand in mock surrender. “Rio and I need to be more careful. And we will
        be.”
  </p>
<p>
   She nudged her elbow into Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   “Won’t we, Rio?”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio to her credit, and Agatha’s relief, seemed to wipe all humor off her face as she looked at Nicholas
        seriously.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” she said with a nod. “My shoes have been tied, and I have been carefully watching where I am going.”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky’s eyes narrowed, his small face filled with the gravity of someone twice his age as he gauged the sincerity
        of their statement. After a long, dramatic pause, he gave a single nod, clearly satisfied with their pledge.
  </p>
<p>
   He shifted, looking ready to climb down from his makeshift judge’s chair, but Agatha wasn’t about to let her
        six-year-old son walk away with the upper hand.
  </p>
<p>
   She had a reputation to uphold, after all.
  </p>
<p>
   “Ah. Ah. Ah,” she tutted, holding up a single finger and gesturing downward in a firm “
   <em>
    sit back down
   </em>
   ”
        motion.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky paused, giving her a suspicious look, but plopped back into the chair with a huff, crossing his arms over
        his chest in defiance.
  </p>
<p>
   “Since we’re all here,” Agatha continued, her tone light but edged with that unmistakable
   <em>
    mom power
   </em>
   ,
        “and since safety procedures seem to be the
   <em>
    hot-button topic of the day
   </em>
   ...”
  </p>
<p>
   She let the words hang, savoring the way Nicky’s little eyebrows furrowed in confusion, before dropping her own
        version of a hammer down.
  </p>
<p>
   “I think we should discuss the packet of Oreos I found under bed this morning. You know, the ones I keep on the
   <em>
    top shelf
   </em>
   for special occasions?”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky’s eyes went wide, and his mouth fell open in a guilty gasp.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio immediately covered her mouth with her hand, muffling a laugh that threatened to escape.
  </p>
<p>
   “Last I checked, your doctor said you were 46 inches tall, correct?” continued Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky froze, his confidence faltering for the first time.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes—I grew two inches,” he answered.
  </p>
<p>
   “Ah, yes,” Agatha said, her eyes narrowing as she leaned back against the couch. “So, tell me, Nicholas—how does
        a child,
   <em>
    even with those extra two inches
   </em>
   , reach the top shelf that’s at least ten feet off the
        ground?”
  </p>
<p>
   She paused, savoring the tension, taking a sip of her coffee before setting it back down on its coaster with an
        almost theatrical flourish. Then, she leaned forward, elbows on her knees, her gaze locking onto his.
  </p>
<p>
   “Unless, of course,” she continued, her voice dropping into a sharp, almost conspiratorial tone, “someone thought
        it was a good idea to climb onto the countertop, then step on top of a soup pot—which, by the way, was
   <em>
    conveniently
   </em>
   left out the following morning as evidence of said crime—and then smuggle said cookies
        into their room in the middle of the night. Hmm?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha arched a brow, her tone sharp as her gaze bore into Nicky.
  </p>
<p>
   “Does standing on the countertop, balancing on a soup pot, sound like following safety protocols to you?”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky’s eyes widened, panic flickering across his face as he desperately searched for an escape route. Agatha
        didn’t miss the way his gaze darted toward Rio, locking onto her with a pleading look so pitiful it could have
        softened stone.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio shifted uncomfortably under the intensity of his puppy-dog stare, her once-smug smirk dissolving into thin
        air. The amusement that had danced in her eyes moments ago was now replaced with a subtle, wide-eyed plea of her
        own as she glanced toward Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Help me,
   </em>
   ” her expression seemed to say.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let out a quiet sigh, her lips twitching in mild exasperation.
  </p>
<p>
   She knew this game all too well—the power of those big, innocent blue eyes was practically weaponized by her son.
  </p>
<p>
   “Eyes on me, Nicholas,” she said firmly, saving Rio from melting under the pressure. “Rio can’t save you here.”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky let out a huff, his little chest rising in exaggerated defeat, but he brought his eyes back to Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   “Anything to say for yourself?” she asked, her brow arching higher, savoring the moment as she waited for him to
        crack.
  </p>
<p>
   For a moment, Nicky looked well and truly cornered, his tiny gears visibly turning as he weighed his options.
        Just when Agatha thought she had him backed into a victory, he shot another quick glance at Rio.
  </p>
<p>
   She watched as son’s eyes flickered with confusion before he returned to Agatha, his expressions still confused.
  </p>
<p>
   “Umm... five?” he said cautiously.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, momentarily stunned by the odd response. Her gaze flickered toward Rio, and that’s when she
        caught it—five fingers held up towards him.
  </p>
<p>
   It took her a beat to connect the dots, and when she did, her jaw dropped. She turned sharply to Rio, disbelief
        etched into every line of her face.
  </p>
<p>
   “Are you
   <em>
    seriously
   </em>
   trying to get him to plead the Fifth?” she demanded, her tone hovering somewhere
        between exasperation and incredulous amusement.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio smirked, her cockiness returning in full force.
  </p>
<p>
   “What’s the Fifth?” Nicky asked, his voice full of curiosity.
  </p>
<p>
   “The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,” Rio explained smoothly, as if she were back in law
        school. “It protects people from self-incrimination, meaning they can refuse to answer questions or provide
        information that might get them into trouble.”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky’s eyes grew comically wide, his lips parting as he processed this groundbreaking revelation. He turned back
        to Agatha, jabbing a finger in Rio’s direction.
  </p>
<p>
   “I do that!” he declared triumphantly.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha groaned, throwing her head back against the couch as Rio erupted into laughter, her smirk now a full-blown
        grin.
  </p>
<p>
   “Of course you do,” Agatha muttered, pinching the bridge of her nose. “
   <em>
    Unbelievable
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha narrowed her eyes at Rio, a warning in her gaze that was met with nothing but a small, unbothered smirk.
        Finally, she let out a resigned sigh, turning her attention back to Nicky.
  </p>
<p>
   “Okay—look we’re all going to make better choices, okay?” she said softly, her tone serious but still maintaining
        warmth.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky looked up at her, his small face thoughtful as he absorbed her words. Then, with a serious nod, he
        repeated.
  </p>
<p>
   “Because we only get one body.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s chest tightened at his words, her heart aching with a pang of bittersweet emotions. She remembered those
        terrifying nights when he was so sick, the fear that gripped her, the helplessness. Her eyes flicked to Rio, and
        another wave hit her—this time, the memory of how close that bullet had come.
  </p>
<p>
   She had come so close to losing them both.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” she murmured, her voice steadier now but still laced with tenderness. “We only get one body. So, we need
        to make sure we protect it. No more unnecessary risks, even for cookies, okay?”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky nodded earnestly, and without another word, he crawled forward and nestled himself between the two women on
        the couch.
  </p>
<p>
   “Sorry about the cookies,” he said in a small voice, his head dipping slightly. “I knew it was naughty.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha smiled, her fingers running gently through his hair.
  </p>
<p>
   “Next time, just wake me up and ask, sweetheart. I would’ve let you have some.”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky nodded, the three of them falling into a comfortable silence for a moment, before his head tilted back, his
        wide eyes gazing up at her curiously.
  </p>
<p>
   “Did you hurt your hand in your bedroom?” he asked suddenly.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the question, her hand stilling in Nicky's hair.
  </p>
<p>
   “No, honey. I hurt it at work,” she said carefully.
  </p>
<p>
   “Oh,” Nicky replied, but his little brow furrowed in a way that Agatha instantly recognized as dangerous. “I
        could’ve sworn I heard banging last night and a loud cry coming from your room when I was walking back to my
        room after I got the cookies.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha stiffened, heat rising up her neck. She opened her mouth to respond, but Rio was already on her feet.
  </p>
<p>
   “And on that note,” Rio interjected, her voice a little too chipper, “I’m going to make breakfast.”
  </p>
<p>
   She bolted to the kitchen with such speed that her coffee nearly tipped over, and Agatha’s jaw dropped as she
        watched her retreat.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Traitor.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   She flicked her gaze down to Nicky, whose curious blue eyes were locked on her—waiting.
  </p>
<p>
   “Rio didn’t tie her shoes and fell again,” Agatha blurted, pulling the excuse out of nowhere. “That’s what you
        heard.”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky’s eyes went wide.
  </p>
<p>
   “Rio—you said you were being careful!” he called out, twisting around on the couch to peer over its back.
  </p>
<p>
   From the kitchen, Rio’s voice rang out, incredulous and dripping with betrayal.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Agatha!
   </em>
   ”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha feigned innocence, turning her head slowly to look over her shoulder. Rio stood there, a frying pan in
        hand, staring at her like she couldn’t believe what she’d just heard.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha shrugged, her expression smug.
  </p>
<p>
   “
   <em>
    Rio...
   </em>
   ” Nicky sighed shaking his head at her as his little voice adopted the same exasperated tone
        Agatha often used herself.
  </p>
<p>
   He turned back to Agatha with a serious expression.
  </p>
<p>
   “We really need to order her those velcro shoes, Mom.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha grinned, her lips twitching into a full smile as she shot a look at Rio that practically screamed
   <em>
    take
            that.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   “Excellent thinking, honey,” she said, reaching for her phone and unlocking it with a flourish. She handed it to
        him, the Amazon app already open. “I’ve got a couple matching pairs in the cart. Pick which ones you like for
        you and her.”
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky’s face lit up as he grabbed the phone, and Agatha leaned back with a victorious smirk, her eyes locking
        with Rio’s.
  </p>
<p>
   “Ohh...I like these Marvel superhero ones!” exclaimed Nicky.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio narrowed her eyes at her from the kitchen, but Agatha only winked, her grin absolutely wicked.
  </p>
<p>
   Nicky was off to school, leaving the house quiet, and Agatha found herself standing in her closet, still wrapped
        in her purple silk robe. Her makeup was flawless, her hair styled to perfection—but the outfit, the
   <em>
    pièce de
            résistance
   </em>
   , was still undecided.
  </p>
<p>
   Today was pivotal.
  </p>
<p>
   The final day of the Vanguard trial, barring any surprises from the FBI leaking their evidence to the opposing
        party. She needed something sharp, commanding, and unmistakably Agatha Harkness.
  </p>
<p>
   Her gaze swept across the rows of her expansive walk-in closet, every inch meticulously organized with designer
        clothes hung in neat, color-coordinated lines. Not her doing, of course. Without the help of a professional
        organizer, the space would look like a luxury bomb exploded.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha knew herself.
  </p>
<p>
   Professionally, she was controlled chaos, but personally?
  </p>
<p>
   She was just chaos.
  </p>
<p>
   And this closet? It wasn’t just a wardrobe—it was an investment. Enough designer labels were packed into this
        space to purchase a chic condo in an up-and-coming neighborhood. The least she could do was pay someone to treat
        them with the respect they deserved.
  </p>
<p>
   Still, as she stared at the array of choices, she felt the stirrings of indecision. Power suits, elegant dresses,
        tailored trousers—all weapons in her arsenal, but none of them
   <em>
    felt
   </em>
   quite right.
  </p>
<p>
   Not yet.
  </p>
<p>
   Not for today.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha crossed her arms, her manicured nails tapping lightly against her cast—another thing she had to figure out
        how to hide, scrutinizing her options. Today needed the perfect balance: sharp enough to remind everyone in the
        courtroom who they were dealing with, but not so severe as to give off power bitch vibe and spook the jury.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a fine line to walk, but if anyone could do it, it was her.
  </p>
<p>
   Suddenly, she felt hands slide over the silk at her waist, and her body tensed instinctively before softening as
        she recognized the touch. She let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding, tension melting away as
        Rio’s hands circled her waist.
  </p>
<p>
   The press of Rio’s front against her back was grounding, and Agatha practically sagged into her, her head tilting
        to rest on Rio’s shoulder. She closed her eyes as Rio buried her face in the curve of Agatha’s neck, breathing
        her in deeply.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’ve been in here for ten minutes,” Rio murmured against her skin, her voice low and warm, sending shivers
        down Agatha’s spine.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha sighed, the sound soft, almost involuntary, as if Rio’s presence had unlocked a tightly coiled spring
        inside her. She barely had a moment to register the relief before Rio’s lips pressed against her neck, trailing
        kisses slowly upward.
  </p>
<p>
   A quiet moan slipped from Agatha’s lips before she could stop it.
  </p>
<p>
   “Someone’s wound up,” Rio teased, her tone dripping with smug satisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha could practically feel the smirk against her skin, and it only made her huff in response.
  </p>
<p>
   “Knock it off,” she muttered, though she made no move to step away. If anything, her body betrayed her, leaning
        slightly into the contact as Rio’s kisses continued. “I don’t have time for this. I need to be out the door in
        twenty minutes.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio chuckled, her breath warm against Agatha’s neck.
  </p>
<p>
   “I could get it done in two.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t even hesitate—her elbow shot back, landing squarely in Rio’s ribs. A surprised “oof” escaped Rio as
        her grip loosened, and Agatha took the opportunity to step away, smirking to herself.
  </p>
<p>
   “Serves you right,” Agatha said over her shoulder, running her fingers along the neatly organized rows of
        designer outfits. She tried to focus, hoping one of them would magically “spark joy” in true Marie Kondo
        fashion.
  </p>
<p>
   Behind her, Rio chuckled, but the sound quickly faded into a thoughtful silence.
  </p>
<p>
   “Big day today,” Rio murmured, her tone softer now.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned, her gaze landing on Rio—and her lips twitched with both amusement and irritation when she caught
        sight of the sweatshirt Rio was wearing. Faded gray, slightly oversized, with “Harvard” emblazoned across the
        front in bold lettering.
  </p>
<p>
   Her sweatshirt.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s eyes narrowed.
  </p>
<p>
   “Nicked it from your dresser,” Rio said sweetly. She tugged at the hem of the sweatshirt as if staking her claim.
        “Full disclosure—this is mine now.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips twitched, betraying her. She hated how much she loved seeing Rio in her things, how easily it
        softened her. But, of course, she wasn’t about to let Rio know that.
  </p>
<p>
   “Full disclosure,” Agatha countered, arching a brow, “if you ever catch me wearing that hideous orange Longhorn
        sweater from your alma mater, check me into the nearest psychiatric facility, because I’ve clearly lost my mind.
        Orange—honestly, you look like a walking creamsicle, Rio.”
  </p>
<p>
   She shivered for dramatic effect, adding a disdainful flourish with her hand.
  </p>
<p>
   But a moment later, her mind finally connected the dots. Rio was makeup-free, her hair pulled back in a messy
        bun, and she was wearing sweatpants.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re not going to work today?” Agatha asked, her voice soft but hesitant.
  </p>
<p>
   And of course, Rio caught it immediately.
  </p>
<p>
   Honestly, the idea of Rio leaving the house today—after everything with James Hughes yesterday—had been gnawing
        at Agatha since the moment she opened her eyes. The thought of her stepping out into the world where a
   <em>
    very
            real
   </em>
   threat loomed over her made Agatha’s stomach churn.
  </p>
<p>
   Worse, Agatha had been ready to let her go, to pretend like she wasn’t worried. Because she didn’t want to fight.
  </p>
<p>
   Not again.
  </p>
<p>
   Not after yesterday.
  </p>
<p>
   She didn’t want to push Rio away, didn’t want to risk saying the wrong thing, but gods—this entire situation felt
        like a lose-lose.
  </p>
<p>
   And Agatha hated losing.
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” Rio said quietly, her voice pulling Agatha from her spiraling thoughts. “I called in.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s breath hitched at that, a mixture of relief and something warmer blooming in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   “You called in?” Agatha repeated, her brow furrowing slightly as she tried—and failed—to mask the rush of emotion
        swelling in her chest.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio nodded, closing the distance between them until there was barely a breath of space left. Her hands came up to
        cup Agatha’s face, her thumbs brushing softly over her cheeks in a gesture so gentle it made Agatha’s knees
        threaten to buckle.
  </p>
<p>
   “Jen’s letting me work from here,” Rio murmured, her voice low and soothing. The corners of her lips quirked
        upward into a smile that was equal parts affectionate and teasing. “Figured I’d stick around and make sure
        someone doesn’t overthink herself into a frenzy before one of the biggest days of her career.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips twitched, her initial instinct to glare completely undermined by the way she leaned into Rio’s
        touch. She knew the look she managed was more petulant than intimidating, but she couldn’t quite bring herself
        to care.
  </p>
<p>
   “I do not overthink,” she countered, though her voice lacked conviction.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s brow arched, her skepticism radiating loud and clear.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’ve been standing in your closet for the last 10 minutes.”
  </p>
<p>
   “I was picking out a statement piece!”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s smirk deepened as her hands slid from Agatha’s face to encircle her waist, pulling her close.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’ve had three cups of coffee.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha pressed her lips together in defiance.
  </p>
<p>
   “I function better caffeinated.”
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s chuckle was soft, a low hum of reassurance as her hand trailed up and down Agatha’s back, the touch as
        steady as the ground beneath her feet. Her dark eyes locked onto Agatha’s, and in an instant, the teasing gave
        way to something more profound—a kind of understanding that made Agatha’s chest ache.
  </p>
<p>
   “And you’re trying very hard not to admit you’re glad I’m staying home,” Rio murmured, her voice warm and
        knowing.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha opened her mouth, a sharp retort at the ready, but it withered on her tongue. She hesitated, swallowing
        the urge to deflect. Instead, she let out a slow breath, the tension in her shoulders easing as her gaze
        softened.
  </p>
<p>
   “I am,” she admitted quietly, the words slipping free like they had been waiting to be said. “Glad, I mean.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her hands moved almost instinctively, reaching up to settle on Rio’s shoulders. Her fingers brushed through the
        soft baby hairs at the back of Rio’s neck before raking gently against her scalp. The response was
        immediate—Rio’s eyes fluttered closed, and a quiet hum of approval escaped her lips, a sound so content that it
        made Agatha’s heart tighten.
  </p>
<p>
   “Thank you,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling just enough to betray the depth of her emotion. “I can’t—I
        didn’t want to think—”
  </p>
<p>
   She broke off, struggling against the weight of what she wanted to say.
  </p>
<p>
   The words felt too heavy, too fragile, too much.
  </p>
<p>
   But Rio didn’t need the words.
  </p>
<p>
   She leaned in, her lips capturing Agatha’s in a kiss so sure, that it seemed to erase every unsaid thought and
        every lingering fear. The kiss wasn’t rushed or frantic—it was steady and a reminder of every reason why Agatha
   <em>
    fucking
   </em>
   loved this woman.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ll be safe here,” Rio murmured, her voice low and steady, punctuated by the tender press of her lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “I’ll stay put all day. I promise.”
  </p>
<p>
   Her hands slid up to cradle Agatha’s face as she kissed her again, this time firmer.
  </p>
<p>
   “You just focus on the trial,” Rio continued, her voice soft but laced with conviction, each word a whisper
        against Agatha’s lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “On Brooke.”
  </p>
<p>
   Another kiss, deeper this time.
  </p>
<p>
   “On bringing her family justice.”
  </p>
<p>
   She kissed her again, this time long and lingering, as though pouring every ounce of her strength, her faith, her
        love into Agatha. When she finally pulled back, Rio’s dark eyes burned fiercely, her fingers tightening on
        Agatha’s face.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “And holding those fucking bastards accountable
   </em>
   ,” she growled, the last words pressed against Agatha’s
        mouth like a command and a plea all at once.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha's thoughts spiraled as she kissed Rio, her lips moving with a fervor that conveyed everything she couldn’t
        put into words. She had never truly had this before—someone who didn’t just tolerate the demands of her career
        but understood it. Someone who respected the weight of her work and pushed her to be better—to be relentless.
  </p>
<p>
   The fact that Rio—Rio, who loved the law as much as she did, who loved work as much as she did—had willingly
        stayed home today for her, for her peace of mind, it was everything.
  </p>
<p>
   It was more than Agatha ever dared to ask for, more than she even knew she needed.
  </p>
<p>
   The thought hit her like a lightning strike, and she surged forward, her kiss searing and passionate.
  </p>
<p>
   The kiss wasn’t just a thank you.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a demand.
  </p>
<p>
   And it told Rio
   <em>
    everything
   </em>
   —that this wasn’t going to stop at a kiss.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio groaned against her lips, her hand slipping around Agatha’s waist as she backed her into the wall of neatly
        arranged shoes. The soft thuds of toppling heels barely registered as Agatha’s robe loosened, Rio’s fingers
        tugging it apart and slipping under the silk.
  </p>
<p>
   “I thought you didn’t have time,” Rio teased, her voice husky, her breath warm against Agatha’s lips as her hand
        cupped a bare breast, her fingers squeezing greedily, exactly the way she knew Agatha loved.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha gasped, her body arching into Rio’s touch, her fingers tangling in Rio’s messy bun and tugging her closer.
  </p>
<p>
   “You said you could get it done in two.
   <em>
    Chop. Chop
   </em>
   ,” Agatha goaded, her voice a mix of challenge and
        breathless need as she tilted her hips into Rio’s, her robe sliding further from her shoulders, forgotten.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio’s dark chuckle sent a shiver racing through Agatha, her lips brushing against Agatha’s jawline before
        murmuring in a low, smoky tone—
  </p>
<p>
   “Then I better not waste a second.”
  </p>
<p>
   And just like that, Rio dropped to her knees. She grabbed Agatha’s leg, her fingers firm as she hooked it over
        her shoulder. Agatha’s breath hitched, her chest heaving as she looked down, only to catch Rio’s a wink—a move
        that would have been infuriating if it weren’t so devastatingly hot.
  </p>
<p>
   Any thoughts of irritation dissolved the moment Rio’s mouth found her. Agatha’s head snapped back, her eyes
        slamming shut as a raw, guttural moan tore from her throat, so visceral it startled even herself. The sound of
        more heels clattering to the floor barely registered.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio was right.
  </p>
<p>
   She only needed two minutes, and as Agatha sagged against the wall, legs trembling, Rio stood up, licking her
        lips with a grin so smug that it made Agatha’s head spin.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha shot her a glare, just as weak and wobbly like her legs, and she knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio smirked unapologetically, turning to walk out of the room to give Agatha space to collect herself. But then
        she stopped mid-step, tilting her head as her eyes scanned the closet. She looked to her left, then back across
        the room, her gaze thoughtful. Without a word, she strode across the room and plucked a pair of plum-colored
        pants from their hanger.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha blinked in confusion, still trying to steady her breathing, as Rio moved to grab a crisp white button-down
        that had a jeweled button that secured the collar and then a navy-teal blazer.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio turned back to her expression neutral as she crossed the room toward Agatha.
  </p>
<p>
   Wordlessly, Rio placed the outfit into Agatha’s outstretched arms. Agatha stared down at the ensemble, a faint
        laugh escaping her lips, but Rio wasn’t done. Leaning forward, she brushed
  </p>
<p>
   against Agatha—deliberately, of course—and pulled out a pair of sleek navy heels from the rack and added them to
        the pile in Agatha’s arms.
  </p>
<p>
   “Wear that,” Rio instructed, her smirk practically dripping with confidence.
  </p>
<p>
   She stepped back, her gaze lingering on Agatha for a moment longer, as though committing her to memory. Then, she
        turned and started to walk away.
  </p>
<p>
   But just as she reached the door, Rio paused.
  </p>
<p>
   She glanced over her shoulder, her dark eyes meeting Agatha’s, and a devastatingly beautiful smile curved her
        lips.
  </p>
<p>
   “Go get ’em, killer.”
  </p>
<p>
   The midday courtroom buzz carried an undercurrent of tension as Agatha leaned back in her chair, allowing herself
        a fleeting breath before the next round. She’d put Brooke’s parents on the stand first thing this morning, their
        testimony painting a portrait of a loving, hardworking daughter, full of life and ambition.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox had pounced on every opportunity to claw at their credibility, treading carefully to avoid leaving a bad
        taste in the jury’s mouth being the “big corporate” lawyer bullying grieving parents. Her questions were
        measured, her tone gentle, and while she managed to chip away at the edges of their testimony—pointing out that
        living states away meant they couldn’t know “everything” about their daughter’s life—it wasn’t enough to destroy
        the picture Agatha had drawn.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha knew better than to underestimate Fox.
  </p>
<p>
   Every five feet she earned, Fox clawed back four, her counterstrikes as relentless as they were precise.
  </p>
<p>
   It was a game of cat and mouse, their movements circling the jury like a carefully choreographed dance, each word
        spoken an adjustment, a feint, a recalibration.
  </p>
<p>
   But for now—for this fleeting moment—Agatha was ahead.
  </p>
<p>
   She knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   And Fox knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   But this morning was just a warm-up.
  </p>
<p>
   The real battle was about to begin.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha rose to her feet.
  </p>
<p>
   “We call Harrison Smith to the stand.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha and the rest of the court room turned as Harrison Smith walked down the aisle, dressed in a sleek blue
        suit that fit him like a glove. His boyish charm was undeniable, his clean-cut features and hesitant smile
        toward the jury radiating an air of harmlessness.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes at the performance.
  </p>
<p>
   Of course he was polished.
  </p>
<p>
   Of course he was perfectly packaged for the jury’s sympathy.
  </p>
<p>
   If Madeline Fox ever left the law, she’d make a fortune in dog training. Only Fox could take men this dangerous
        and reframe them as harmless, tail-wagging puppies.
  </p>
<p>
   She waited for him to adjust himself in the chair, his hands folding neatly on the edge of the stand as though he
        were posing for a magazine spread. The jury’s eyes were on him, already softening under the weight of his
        hesitant smile.
  </p>
<p>
   When he finally shifted, his gaze flicking nervously toward Fox, Agatha spoke.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good afternoon, Mr. Smith,” she said, her tone polite. She stepped forward, her heels clicking sharply against
        the courtroom floor, commanding attention with every movement.
  </p>
<p>
   Rio after all, picked an amazing outfit.
  </p>
<p>
   “Good afternoon,” Harrison replied, his voice smooth, rehearsed—almost too perfect.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha arched a brow. Of course it was rehearsed. Everything about him screamed preparation, from the suit to the
        carefully calibrated smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “You’re the head of logistics at Vanguard Industries, correct?” she began, her tone deceptively casual.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes, that’s correct,” Harrison replied, his smile widening just enough to flash teeth.
  </p>
<p>
   “And you’ve held that position for, what, three years now?”
  </p>
<p>
   “That’s right.”
  </p>
<p>
   “You must be quite the standout, Mr. Smith,” Agatha said, tilting her head slightly. “At thirty years old,
        already managing such a vital department at one of the country’s largest defense corporations. Quite
        impressive.”
  </p>
<p>
   “Thank you,” he said, his cheeks coloring faintly in what could have been feigned humility.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned gracefully, walking back to the counsel table with her heels clicking sharply against the polished
        floor. She picked up a thick stack of papers, holding them up for the court to see, her expression one of
        calculated detachment.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mr. Smith,” she began, her voice calm but pointed, “here is a list of every employee currently working at
        Vanguard Industries.”
  </p>
<p>
   She allowed the weight of the stack to land audibly on the table, the sound reverberating through the silent
        courtroom.
  </p>
<p>
   The jury’s attention shifted from her to Harrison, who seemed to straighten slightly in his seat.
  </p>
<p>
   “My team,” Agatha continued, briefly thinking of Rio and the countless days she’d poured into combing through the
        data, “did some research.”
  </p>
<p>
   She let the words hang for just a moment before lifting her gaze back to Harrison.
  </p>
<p>
   “Off the top of your head, could you estimate the average age of individuals holding leadership positions at
        Vanguard? Positions equivalent to yours.”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison’s hesitation was palpable. He blinked once, his jaw tightening just slightly as he shifted in his seat.
  </p>
<p>
   “Uh... I’d say somewhere in their... late-thirties or early-forties?” he guessed, his voice carrying just a touch
        of uncertainty.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha tilted her head, her lips curling into a faint smile that didn’t reach her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “Late thirties,” she repeated, her tone almost thoughtful. “Interesting.”
  </p>
<p>
   She picked up another document from the stack, flipping through it slowly, deliberately, as if to prolong the
        silence just enough to make him sweat.
  </p>
<p>
   “Because,” she continued, lifting her gaze again to meet his, “our findings indicate that the average age at
        promotion for your level at the company is actually forty-eight. Quite a bit older than your twenty-seven,
        wouldn’t you agree?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed, but he nodded slightly.
  </p>
<p>
   “I suppose so,” he said cautiously.
  </p>
<p>
   “And yet here you are,” Agatha said, gesturing toward him with an open hand, “managing logistics at one of the
        country’s largest corporations, years ahead of the curve. Truly remarkable.”
  </p>
<p>
   Fox shifted in her seat, her sharp gaze fixed on Agatha, who didn’t so much as glance in her direction.
  </p>
<p>
   “Tell me, Mr. Smith,” Agatha said, leaning forward slightly as she clasped her hands behind her back. “Do you
        think your friendship with Brandon Vanguard—your college roommate, no less—might have helped accelerate your
        rise to such an influential position at 27?”
  </p>
<p>
   The courtroom was silent, every pair of eyes fixed on Harrison.
  </p>
<p>
   “I... I don’t think so,” Harrison said after a beat, his voice tighter now. “I’d like to think I earned my
        position based on merit.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let out a soft hum, neither affirming nor denying his statement. Instead, she turned, picking up yet
        another piece of evidence from the arsenal Rio had meticulously prepared for her.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well see if your merit speak for itself,” she said, handing it to the bailiff for distribution. The jury leaned
        forward as they examined the document—authored and signed by Harrison.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox’s expression didn’t falter, but Agatha saw it—the subtle tension in her jaw, the way her fingers tightened on
        her pen.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha was about to drop a bomb, and Fox knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha held up a sheet of paper, unassuming in its simplicity. She approached the witness stand.
  </p>
<p>
   “This,” she began, holding the document up for the jury’s scrutiny before handing it to Harrison, “is one of your
        logistics reports, correct? Prepared and approved by you?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison leaned forward slightly, his fingers brushing the paper. He glanced over it, his lips thinning into a
        straight, carefully controlled line.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” he replied, his tone measured. “That’s correct.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha tilted her head slightly, her expression sharp but feigning curiosity.
  </p>
<p>
   “Why is a senior manager writing reports, Mr. Smith? Shouldn’t you just be approving them?”
  </p>
<p>
   The question hung in the air like a loaded weapon. Harrison shifted, his discomfort flickering across his
        features for a split second before he masked it with a polished response.
  </p>
<p>
   “I still get my hands dirty with the logistics agents,” he answered smoothly, his voice carrying just enough
        humility to sound genuine. “It keeps me aware of any issues or bottlenecks my employees might be facing. And,
        frankly, I think my team appreciates a boss who isn’t afraid to get into the trenches with them.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes, but she could practically feel the smirk radiating from Fox across the
        room.
  </p>
<p>
   Of course.
  </p>
<p>
   Such a good fucking answer.
  </p>
<p>
   She hated it.
  </p>
<p>
   With a carefully neutral expression, she stepped closer, as if acknowledging the response but not letting it
        derail her momentum.
  </p>
<p>
   “Well, that’s admirable, Mr. Smith,” Agatha said smoothly, her tone cool, unbothered, though her mind raced ahead
        to her next move. “I’m sure your employees do appreciate it. But tell
  </p>
<p>
   me—when exactly do you find the time to personally draft these reports? Between overseeing an entire department
        and, as you said, being in the trenches?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison blinked, the faintest flicker of uncertainty flashing across his face.
  </p>
<p>
   “I, uh, prioritize,” he said after a beat. “I make time where it’s needed.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha tilted her head, her expression thoughtful, almost indulgent.
  </p>
<p>
   “Of course. Prioritization is key in any leadership role. So, if you’re personally drafting reports, I imagine
        these must be particularly important. Wouldn’t you agree?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison hesitated again, his jaw tightening.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” he said carefully. “Important enough to require my direct attention.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha smiled—a slow, deliberate curve of her lips that sent a ripple of anticipation through the courtroom.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned back to her desk, and reached for the next document. Lilia had it ready, sliding it into her hand
        without missing a beat. Agatha lifted it, holding it up for the jury, the dense text and numerous pages clearly
        visible even from a distance.
  </p>
<p>
   “This,” she began, her voice crisp and commanding, “is one of Vanguard’s standard logistics reports. You’re
        familiar with these, I assume, Mr. Smith?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison straightened in his seat as she walked toward him, the document extended. He took it, his fingers
        flipping through the thick stack of pages. His brow furrowed slightly as his eyes skimmed the densely packed
        data.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” he said after a moment, his tone cautious. “It looks like one of our standard reports.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha clasped her hands behind her back, giving him a moment before tilting her head slightly. “How many pages
        would you say that is?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison hesitated, flipping to the back before glancing up.
  </p>
<p>
   “Twenty-two.”
  </p>
<p>
   She nodded, stepping closer.
  </p>
<p>
   “And would you agree it’s fairly detailed? Inventory, dates, itemized costs, carrier information—all laid out in
        exhaustive detail, correct?”
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” he said, his voice tightening.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned to the jury, her tone shifting to one of conversational authority.
  </p>
<p>
   “Ladies and gentlemen, this is a logistics report for a shipment valued at ten point three million dollars.
        Twenty-two pages. Every item accounted for, every dollar explained.”
  </p>
<p>
   She returned her gaze to Harrison, her eyes narrowing slightly.
  </p>
<p>
   “Now, Mr. Smith,” she continued, “you mentioned earlier that you personally draft reports when they’re
        particularly important. Is that correct?”
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” Harrison said again, visibly bracing himself.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha pivoted, reaching for another document. She held it up, this one noticeably thinner, almost flimsy in
        comparison to the first.
  </p>
<p>
   “And this,” she said, her tone sharpening, “is the report you personally wrote and signed for a shipment valued
        at eleven point two million dollars.
   <em>
    One page long
   </em>
   .”
  </p>
<p>
   She strode forward, placing the single-page document in front of him.
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison shifted uncomfortably in his seat, glancing at the single-page report in front of him as if it might
        offer some kind of escape.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” he said slowly, his voice slightly uneven. “But that’s because—due to the nature of this particular
        shipment—it was entirely classified. National security protocols require us to keep certain details off the
        logs.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded as though considering his words, but the sharp gleam in her eyes told a different story. She
        stepped closer to the jury, gesturing to the two reports she had presented earlier.
  </p>
<p>
   “I see,” she said, her tone calm but edged with skepticism. “National security. Certainly a valid concern for a
        company like Vanguard. But let me ask you this, Mr. Smith.”
  </p>
<p>
   She turned back to face him, her heels clicking with purpose.
  </p>
<p>
   “In the 23-page report we reviewed earlier—the one for a $10.3 million shipment—there are ten items labeled as
        ‘logistic supplies,’ totaling $789,000. The rest of the cargo, however, includes meticulously detailed entries:
        missiles, drones, top-of-the-line surveillance gear. Each item explicitly listed, down to the model and serial
        numbers.”
  </p>
<p>
   She let her words hang for a moment, then took a step closer to the witness stand.
  </p>
<p>
   “Would it surprise you to learn that my team”—her lips curved into a faint smile as Rio crossed her
        mind—“reviewed every single logistics report filed over the last three years? And that in every single case
        where Vanguard cited ‘logistic supplies’ or ‘security hardware,’ they accounted for less than 5% of the reported
        cargo?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison opened his mouth, but no words came. He hesitated, clearly trying to formulate a response, when Fox’s
        voice cut through the courtroom.
  </p>
<p>
   “Objection.” Fox’s tone was sharp, clipped. “Is counsel testifying, or is she going to ask a question?”
  </p>
<p>
   Judge Marks barely glanced up.
  </p>
<p>
   “Move it along, Ms. Harkness.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t miss a beat, her smile tightening as she turned back to Harrison.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mr. Smith,” she said smoothly, her voice ringing with quiet authority, “the average shipping report for Vanguard
        contains only 5% classified material. But this report”—she pointed toward the single-page document still sitting
        before him—“claims the entire ship’s cargo is confidential. Is that correct?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison fidgeted again, his shoulders stiffening as his eyes flicked down to the stack of reports Agatha had
        placed before him. His hand hovered for a moment before reluctantly taking the documents.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” he said finally, his voice barely above a murmur. “That’s correct.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded slowly, her expression sharp and calculating as she moved back to her desk. Lilia was already
        there, sliding a stack of reports into her hand like clockwork. But instead of approaching Harrison immediately,
        Agatha leaned casually against the table, letting the tension in the room simmer.
  </p>
<p>
   “When you select the reports to write, Mr. Smith, do you have certain accounts you prefer to manage, or do you
        simply help wherever your team needs assistance?” she asked, her tone deceptively light.
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
  </p>
<p>
   “I just help where the team needs help,” he said carefully.
  </p>
<p>
   “So, you don’t choose?”
  </p>
<p>
   “Objection—asked and answered,” Fox interjected, her voice cutting through the room.
  </p>
<p>
   “Sustained,” Judge Marks said firmly. “Move it along, Ms. Harkness.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned her head slightly, giving the judge a brief nod of acknowledgment before pivoting back to Harrison.
  </p>
<p>
   “Do you believe in luck, Mr. Smith?”
  </p>
<p>
   A scoff sounded from Fox’s side of the courtroom, and Agatha could practically feel her opponent bristle beside
        her. Good.
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison blinked at the question, clearly thrown.
  </p>
<p>
   “I—I guess so,” he said hesitantly, his voice shaky. “I don’t know if I believe in luck as much as I believe in
        just... working toward what you want.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s smirk deepened, the predator in her sensing blood. God, he just set himself up.
  </p>
<p>
   “‘
   <em>
    Working toward what you want
   </em>
   ,’” she repeated, her voice slow, deliberate, as if savoring the words.
        She took a step forward and extended her hand toward the stack of reports he was now holding.
  </p>
<p>
   “So, tell me, Mr. Smith—would you call it luck that you—
   <em>
    and only you
   </em>
   —are the logistics agent who files
        reports on the
   <em>
    Meridian Star
   </em>
   ? The same ship that carries tens of millions in ‘only classified cargo’
        almost bi-weekly for three years? Or would you say you ‘
   <em>
    worked toward what you wanted
   </em>
   ,’ ensuring that
        no one else writes these reports but you?”
  </p>
<p>
   The question lingered in the air, each second of silence stretching longer than the last. Harrison’s throat
        bobbed as he swallowed hard, his face pale under the weight of the courtroom’s collective gaze.
  </p>
<p>
   His silence spoke louder than any denial could.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t need him to answer.
  </p>
<p>
   She already had him cornered.
  </p>
<p>
   "Mr. Smith," Agatha began, her voice cutting through the charged atmosphere, "were you aware that Brooke Sinclair
        flagged one of these reports when she noticed the account number didn’t align with any known accounts, and the
        ‘vague itemization’ raised concerns for her?"
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his hands tightening on the edges of the witness stand.
  </p>
<p>
   "I was aware," he admitted, his tone guarded. "She worked in a different department than my team, but her
        supervisor did escalate it to me. I worked with her, and due to the confidential nature of the manifest—"
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha cut in smoothly, her tone cool but pointed.
  </p>
<p>
   "Confidential or not, she flagged the report, didn’t she? She raised questions about the validity of the account
        number and the lack of transparency in the itemization."
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison nodded, though reluctantly.
  </p>
<p>
   "Yes, she did."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha raised her eyebrows, leaning slightly against the edge of her table as if settling in for a particularly
        interesting story.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha took a step closer, her heels clicking deliberately on the floor.
  </p>
<p>
   "And what exactly did you do in response to her concerns?"
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison hesitated, his jaw tightening.
  </p>
<p>
   "I explained to her that certain logistics details are classified, as per company policy. I assured her that the
        proper protocols were followed and that there was no need for concern."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha tilted her head, her eyes narrowing.
  </p>
<p>
   "You assured her? And did that satisfy her concerns, Mr. Smith?"
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” he replied, a touch too quickly. “As far as I could tell, she understood the explanation and moved on.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha nodded slowly, as though considering his response. Then she straightened, her posture tightening as her
        tone took on an edge.
  </p>
<p>
   “And yet, Mr. Smith,” she said, stepping closer to the witness stand and fixing him with an unrelenting stare, “a
        week later, Brooke Sinclair flagged another one of your reports. This time, she took her concerns directly to
        James Hughes, didn’t she?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison froze for a beat, his mouth opening slightly before he seemed to catch himself.
  </p>
<p>
   “I—I wasn’t aware of that.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha arched an eyebrow.
  </p>
<p>
   “You weren’t aware that she raised her concerns about your report with Vanguard’s Head of Security?”
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” he said, his voice wavering slightly. “That wasn’t brought to my attention.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s lips curved into a small, sharp smile.
  </p>
<p>
   “Interesting. Because emails between Ms. Sinclair and Mr. Hughes, obtained during discovery, show that she
        explicitly questioned discrepancies in your report. Would you like me to read them for the court?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison’s face drained of color. Fox immediately rose.
  </p>
<p>
   “Objection, Your Honor. This line of questioning is argumentative and speculative without proper context.”
  </p>
<p>
   “Overruled,” Judge Marks said, his tone measured but firm. “Proceed, Ms. Harkness.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha held up a printout, her movements deliberate.
  </p>
<p>
   “In one email, dated five days before her death, Brooke Sinclair wrote, and I quote, ‘
   <em>
    This manifest doesn’t
            align with standard protocols. The vague itemization and missing account details are alarming. I believe
            this warrants further investigation
   </em>
   .’”
  </p>
<p>
   She let the words hang, her eyes boring into Harrison’s pale face.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mr. Smith,” Agatha said, her voice quiet but icy, “do you still believe Brooke Sinclair was ‘satisfied’ with
        your explanation?”
  </p>
<p>
   The courtroom fell silent. Harrison sat frozen, his lips parting slightly as if to respond, but no words came
        out.
  </p>
<p>
   The weight of Agatha’s question hung in the air, suffocating and inescapable.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s gaze didn’t waver.
  </p>
<p>
   When Harrison finally attempted to speak, it was little more than a stammer, his carefully rehearsed composure
        beginning to crack.
  </p>
<p>
   “I—uh, well, I mean—”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha took a deliberate step forward, cutting him off smoothly but firmly.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mr. Smith,” she began, her voice steady and razor-sharp, “in front of you, you have over 100 logistics reports,
        all authored and approved by you for the
   <em>
    Meridian Star’s
   </em>
   cargo. However,” she paused for effect,
        letting the silence stretch just long enough for everyone to hang on her next words, “you are not the final
        approver, are you?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison shifted in his seat.
  </p>
<p>
   “No,” he admitted, his voice barely above a murmur.
  </p>
<p>
   “These reports,” Agatha continued, stepping closer, her tone growing sharper with each word, “typically require
        two additional signatures—one from a member of senior leadership and another from security to confirm the
        contents and approve the course of direction. Correct?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison fidgeted, his fingers curling against the edges of the stack before him.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha tilted her head slightly, her smile razor-sharp.
  </p>
<p>
   “Please read the leadership approval on your report. Pick any one—it doesn’t matter.”
  </p>
<p>
   He hesitated before reaching for the top report, his hands trembling ever so slightly as he flipped to the
        signature page.
  </p>
<p>
   “Brandon Vanguard,” Harrison finally said, his voice cracking just enough to betray him.
  </p>
<p>
   The courtroom fell deathly silent, as though the very walls were holding their breath.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha tilted her head ever so slightly, her eyes sharp as a blade.
  </p>
<p>
   “And the security sign-off?” she pressed, her voice calm, almost conversational—a stark contrast to the storm
        brewing beneath.
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison hesitated, his eyes darting briefly toward Fox, who sat rigid, her face impassive yet brimming with
        restrained fury.
  </p>
<p>
   There was no lifeline for him here, no escape.
  </p>
<p>
   “James Hughes,” he said finally, the name falling from his lips like a stone sinking into dark waters.
  </p>
<p>
   The mention of that name made Agatha’s stomach churn, revulsion crawling under her skin. But she didn’t let it
        show—not even for a second. She took a deliberate step forward, her heels clicking against the polished floor,
        the sound echoing like a ticking clock.
  </p>
<p>
   “James Hughes,” she repeated, her voice quieter now, but no less piercing. “The Head of Security at Vanguard
        Industries. The same James Hughes to whom Brooke Sinclair escalated her concerns. Is that correct?”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, his discomfort visible for all to see.
  </p>
<p>
   “Yes,” he croaked.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha let the admission hang in the air, heavy and damning. She moved to the edge of the jury box, her gaze
        sweeping across their faces, ensuring they felt the gravity of every word spoken.
  </p>
<p>
   “Grab another report,” she instructed, her voice steady. “Let’s see who signed that one.”
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison swallowed hard but complied, pulling another report from the stack.
  </p>
<p>
   “Brandon Vanguard and James Hughes,” he read aloud, his tone flat but strained.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t miss a beat. She stepped forward, plucking a random report from the middle of the stack.
  </p>
<p>
   “And this one?” she asked, handing it to him.
  </p>
<p>
   Harrison’s fingers trembled as he scanned the page.
  </p>
<p>
   “Brandon Vanguard and James Hughes.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha raised her eyebrows, her lips curving into a faint smirk.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let’s try from the bottom, shall we?”
  </p>
<p>
   “Objection!” Fox’s voice rang out, sharp and tinged with exasperation. “This is a waste of the court’s time.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha turned toward Judge Marks with the measured grace of someone who knew exactly how to wield the room’s
        attention. Her expression was composed, deliberate, her voice steady yet cutting.
  </p>
<p>
   “Your Honor, I agree. To save the court’s time, we will stipulate that all 123 one-page reports authored and
        approved by Mr. Smith—each connected to the Meridian Star cargo carrier and containing vague classifications
        such as ‘logistics supplies’ and ‘security hardware’—share one undeniable commonality. Every single one bears
        the signatures of Brandon Vanguard and James Hughes.”
  </p>
<p>
   A ripple of murmurs spread through the courtroom.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mrs. Fox?” Judge Marks prompted, turning his attention to the opposing counsel.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox hesitated, her jaw tightening as she weighed her options.
  </p>
<p>
   “We will stipulate that for now,” she said finally, her voice clipped, “but reserve the right to retract pending
        verification of those signatures.”
  </p>
<p>
   “So stipulated,” Judge Marks said with a nod, before turning back to Agatha. “Anything else for the witness, Ms.
        Harkness?”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha smiled, slow and predatory, the kind that made people sit up straighter, bracing themselves for what was
        coming next. She raised a single finger, her movements precise as she pivoted toward Harrison.
  </p>
<p>
   “Just one,” she said, her tone deceptively light.
  </p>
<p>
   She stepped closer to the witness stand, her eyes locking onto Harrison’s.
  </p>
<p>
   The silence in the courtroom was deafening, the tension coiled tight as a spring.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mr. Smith,” she began, her voice low but cutting enough to slice through charged air, “would you say it was luck
        that Brooke Sinclair died before she could escalate her concerns even further? Or would you call it what you
        just described earlier—‘
   <em>
    good old-fashioned working toward what you want
   </em>
   ?’”
  </p>
<p>
   The question hit the room like a semitruck into one of those electric clown cars—and the collective gasp from the
        gallery confirmed it. All eyes turned to Harrison, whose face drained of color, his mouth opening and closing as
        if searching for a response that would not damn him further.
  </p>
<p>
   “Objection!” Fox’s voice rang out, sharp and desperate, with a thin veneer of control barely masking her
        frustration. “Argumentative! Counsel is clearly attempting to inflame the jury with baseless accusations.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t so much as blink.
  </p>
<p>
   Instead, she turned to Judge Marks seeing the warning look.
  </p>
<p>
   “Withdrawn,” she said smoothly, though the smirk tugging at the corner of her lips hinted that she knew the
        damage was already done. The words she’d left hanging in the air had planted themselves firmly in the jury’s
        minds, like red wine spilled on cream carpet, impossible to erase.
  </p>
<p>
   “No further questions, Your Honor,” she added, her tone crisp and biting as she cast a final, scathing glance at
        Harrison Smith before striding back to her table.
  </p>
<p>
   Her heels clicked against the courtroom floor, each step radiating a confidence that only deepened when she got
        closer to Fox and Ratcliff.
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha didn’t need to look back to know she’d rattled her opponent.
  </p>
<p>
   The tension was practically tangible.
  </p>
<p>
   But when she finally did glance over, she was greeted with the sight of Fox exchanging hushed words with
        Ratcliff, her frustration written in every sharp gesture, her mask of composure slipping just enough to reveal
        cracks.
  </p>
<p>
   And for the first time, Agatha saw it.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox was floundering.
  </p>
<p>
   There was no regaining control here—Agatha was pulling ahead, and Fox knew it.
  </p>
<p>
   “Mrs. Fox, any questions?” Judge Marks prompted.
  </p>
<p>
   Fox hesitated, clearly startled, and Agatha felt a surge of satisfaction ripple through her. She leaned back
        slightly in her chair, her smirk widening as Fox glanced at Ratcliff, their conversation growing quieter but
        more visibly strained.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, Fox rose to her feet with a forced calm that didn’t quite meet her eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   “No questions at this time, Your Honor,” she said stiffly. “We reserve the right to recall Mr. Smith after
        reviewing the reports in detail.”
  </p>
<p>
   “Granted,” Judge Marks replied, dismissing Harrison Smith with a wave of his hand. “Ms. Harkness, call your next
        witness.”
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha felt the victory settle over her shoulders like a familiar mantle, but it wasn’t without weight. A nervous
        coil twisted low in her stomach as she straightened, her broken hand flexing instinctively against the cast as
        she cleared her throat to call the next—and final witness.
  </p>
<p>
   “We call James Hughes to the stand,” she announced, her voice steady, though the gravity of the moment sent a
        ripple of tension down her spine.
  </p>
<p>
   The doors at the back of the courtroom opened, and all eyes turned toward them.
  </p>
<p>
   James Hughes strode down the aisle, dressed in a sleek black suit that did nothing to mask the swelling around
        his nose or the deep bruises under his eyes. Agatha’s gaze flicked upward, locking onto his face, and she felt
        the smallest, sharpest thrill.
  </p>
<p>
   She’d done that.
  </p>
<p>
   A slow, deliberate smirk spread across Agatha’s lips as he passed, her gaze locking onto his with an intensity
        that made the tension in the courtroom practically hum.
  </p>
<p>
   James Hughes glared back at her, his expression a volatile mix of resentment and barely concealed rage.
  </p>
<p>
   Her smirk deepened, her fingers instinctively brushing the edge of her cast—a quiet reminder of the satisfying
        crack that had reverberated through her fist just yesterday.
  </p>
<p>
   She watched as James Hughes strode to the witness chair. He settled into the seat, his gaze locking onto hers,
        sharp and defiant.
  </p>
<p>
   For a moment, the courtroom seemed to fade, the air between them charged. And then, like a flame sparking in the
        dark, Rio’s words echoed in her mind, steady and sure, filling her chest with fire.
  </p>
<p>
   "Go get ’em, killer."
  </p>
<p>
   Agatha’s smirk widened into something lethal.
  </p>
<p>
   Oh...she was going to fucking destroy him.
   <br/>

   Chapter End Notes
  </p>
<p>
   Thoughts? I really love writing Agatha in court. I just love how she commands a scene and she may not have any
        magical powers in this story, I feel like she certainly has a flare for magic when in her element as a
        lawyer.

```
Agatha leaned back slightly in her chair, savoring the moment like the most expensive bottle of whiskey she owned. The one that she only broke out for special occasions.
   </p>
<p>
    James Hughes sat before her, visibly bristling beneath his carefully composed exterior, but it wasn’t just his discomfort she was savoring—it was the sheer gravity of what this moment represented.
   </p>
<p>
    James Hughes was so many things to her.
   </p>
<p>
    At first, she thought Vanguard itself was her ultimate target—her great adversary. But when Rio had pulled back the curtain on the company’s underbelly, her focus had shifted. Her white whale wasn’t Vanguard. It wasn’t even Brandon Vanguard or Harrison Smith, as much as she’d relished taking them apart piece by piece.
   </p>
<p>
    No, the real prize, the true puppet master pulling every blood-soaked string, was sitting right in front of her.
   </p>
<p>
    James. Fucking. Hughes.
   </p>
<p>
    In the beginning, Brandon Vanguard, Harrison Smith, and James Hughes had always reminded her of that three-headed dog from Harry Potter—what was it called?
   </p>
<p>
    Ah yes, Fluffy.
   </p>
<p>
    Together, they guarded their arms smuggling empire they’d built, the so-called “stone” of their operation. But Agatha’s gut, that instinct she trusted more than any piece of evidence, told her the truth.
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes wasn’t one of the heads.
   </p>
<p>
    He was the brains.
   </p>
<p>
    The Voldemort of this twisted operation.
   </p>
<p>
    God—she really needed to stop reading Harry Potter to her son.
   </p>
<p>
    But now that the metaphor had taken root, she wasn’t about to let it go.
   </p>
<p>
    Because, like Voldemort, Hughes had made the ultimate mistake:
    <em>
     he’d come for her family.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The bastard had threatened Nicky.
   </p>
<p>
    And worse, he had actually tried to kill Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    But this is where this analogy stopped.
   </p>
<p>
    Because Agatha wasn’t some naive, broomstick-clutching eleven-year-old who thought she could take down the ultimate dark wizard with luck and courage.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
      No.
     </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
    She was everything the rumors whispered about her.
   </p>
<p>
    She was the Witch of Wall Street.
   </p>
<p>
    She was powerful.
   </p>
<p>
    She was merciless.
   </p>
<p>
    She was relentless.
   </p>
<p>
    And most importantly—she always,
    <em>
     always
    </em>
    , finished what she started.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips curved as her nails rapped on the table in a restless movement before she stood, smoothing the lines of her plum pants. Her heels clicked against the courtroom floor with the precision of a metronome.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Click.
    </em>
<em>
     Click.
    </em>
<em>
     Click.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Each step drew the jury’s attention.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned to face him fully, her gaze locking onto his. And for just a moment, she let the silence stretch savoring the tension—
    <em>
     the anticipation.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Then, ever so slowly, her lips curved into a predatory smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, Mr. Hughes,” she began, her voice just as sharp as her smile, “shall we begin?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes just stared at her that flicker of defiance still shining in his eyes.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     And god
    </em>
    , if that didn’t send a pleased thrill down her spine.
   </p>
<p>
    She loved when they thought they could hold their ground against it her.
   </p>
<p>
    It made tearing them apart so much sweeter.
   </p>
<p>
    “You are the Head of Security at Vanguard, correct?” she asked, her tone innocuous, like she was just ticking off a box.
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes’s jaw tightened. For a moment, she thought he might not answer, but then he gave a stiff nod.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” he said, his voice clipped.
   </p>
<p>
    One-word answers.
   </p>
<p>
    Smarter than his peers.
   </p>
<p>
    But she wasn’t worried.
   </p>
<p>
    She just needed to pry him open like a stuck pickle jar—and everyone knew the best way to unstick a pickle jar was to slam the lid on the countertop.
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze flickered briefly to his face, taking in the bruises, the swollen nose, the undeniable evidence of her fist meeting his face. She resisted the urge to smirk, fighting it back with every ounce of willpower.
   </p>
<p>
    Time to give him a little tippy-tap on the metaphorical countertop.
   </p>
<p>
    “The injury to your face looks painful,” Agatha said, her voice laced with feigned concern, her expression a perfect mask of mock sympathy. “Did you get that at work?”
   </p>
<p>
    The words had barely left her lips when the courtroom erupted into motion.
   </p>
<p>
    “Objection!” Fox shot to her feet, her voice sharp and furious, the word echoing off vaulted ceilings like a god damn opera house.
   </p>
<p>
    “Ms. Harkness!” Judge Marks barked, his tone clearly unimpressed.
   </p>
<p>
    But Agatha didn’t flinch.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t even blink.
   </p>
<p>
    Her focus was singular—locked on James Hughes.
   </p>
<p>
    His reaction was all she cared about.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     And
    </em>
    —
    <em>
     there
    </em>
    —
    <em>
     it
    </em>
    —
    <em>
     was
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    His eyes narrowed, his jaw clenched, and his lip curled into a snarl—a visceral, unrestrained display of the fury she’d been hoping to bring out.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s chest filled with satisfaction, allowing the evil smirk she was holding back to curl slowly and
    <em>
     fucking
    </em>
    deliberately.
   </p>
<p>
    She wanted him to see it, to
    <em>
     feel
    </em>
    it, to know exactly who had just gotten under his skin.
   </p>
<p>
    Judge Marks was most certainly going to rip her apart in a second, but she couldn’t bring herself to care.
   </p>
<p>
    Worth it.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Every bit of it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The jar was officially loosened.
   </p>
<p>
    “Counsel,” Judge Marks said, his tone sharp and scolding. “Bench.
    <em>
     Now
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned away from Hughes calmly, though the cockiness in her stride faltered just slightly under the weight of Judge Marks’ glare. As she approached the bench, she caught the soft sound of footsteps behind her—Fox, moving to walk next to her. Their shoulders nearly brushed as Fox leaned in just enough to murmur under her breath.
   </p>
<p>
    “You have balls, Harkness,” she muttered, a hint of reluctant admiration in her tone. “I’ll give you that.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips twitched, a brief flicker of amusement threatening to break through her composed exterior.
   </p>
<p>
    But there was no time to bask in the rare compliment from Madeline Fox. Because like a coin flipped in midair, as soon as they reached the bench, Fox’s demeanor changed entirely.
   </p>
<p>
    “Your Honor,” Fox began, her voice brimming with indignation, “Ms. Harkness is blatantly baiting the witness. Yesterday’s events were to be explicitly kept from the jury to not prejudice my client with opposing counsels' baseless accusations. Her reckless disregard for this court’s instructions is—”
   </p>
<p>
    Judge Marks exhaled heavily, raising a hand to cut off Fox mid-rant.
   </p>
<p>
    Her words died instantly, though the heat in her glare remained fixed on Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Ms. Harkness
    </em>
    ,” Marks said, the simmering warning in his tone clear as he leaned forward slightly, his gaze locked onto hers. “Let me make myself crystal clear. If you so much as hint at yesterday’s events again—if you even think about dancing near that line with your clever little word games—I will not just fine you, I will hold you in contempt.”
   </p>
<p>
    His voice dropped further, the weight of his words pressing down like a gavel.
   </p>
<p>
    “And unlike the last time I held you in contempt—
    <em>
     you will go to jail
    </em>
    ,” he said, his gaze locked onto hers. “And not only that, but I will personally ensure my sheriffs escort you to the dirtiest, most uncomfortable cell the great city of New York has to offer.”
   </p>
<p>
    Then, with a slow exhale, he continued, his voice as sharp as ever.
   </p>
<p>
    “And, as I’m sure you’re aware, paperwork moves slow down there. So don’t test me, Ms. Harkness. Am I making myself clear?”
   </p>
<p>
    Judge Marks’s words hung heavy in the air, filled with enough warning and bite to make even her pause.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha was a master at walking the line—no,
    <em>
     she fucking lived on it
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    That razor-thin boundary where control and chaos teetered, where risk flirted with reward. She loved that line, thrived on it, and danced along its edges with a near manic grin. But Agatha knew, the line was different for everyone, and for most, she relished in finding out what lay on the other side.
   </p>
<p>
    But Judge Marks?
   </p>
<p>
    He was one of the rare few where crossing the line wasn’t a game. With Judge Marks, she had no desire to find out what waited on the other side.
   </p>
<p>
    So, she nodded, keeping her expression neutral.
   </p>
<p>
    “I understand, Judge,” she said, making sure to lace her tone with just enough contrition to be believable.
   </p>
<p>
    Marks studied her for a long moment, his eyes narrowing as if trying to gauge the sincerity of her words. The silence stretched between them before he finally leaned back in his chair and gave her a curt nod.
   </p>
<p>
    “Continue with your questioning, Ms. Harkness.
    <em>
     But tread carefully
    </em>
    ,” Judge Marks warned.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha gave a nod, her gaze snapping briefly to Fox. She threw her a pointed look as they stepped back from the bench. Only when Fox was seated again, Agatha pivoted her focus back to James Hughes.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mr. Hughes,” she began, her voice steady, “what does the Head of Security at Vanguard actually do?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes shifted in his seat, his movements stiff, his jaw tightening before he answered with a gruff voice.
   </p>
<p>
    “Due to the nature of Vanguard’s work,” he started, his tone laced with well rehearsed authority, “we must ensure that the weapons we create are protected from our enemies both internal and overseas. I oversee all surveillance and security at our warehouses. Additionally, I ensure that when transporting those weapons—whether by ground or sea—they are safeguarded. That is my job, Ms. Harkness. I protect.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips twitched slightly at his choice of words.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Protect.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    What a joke.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned forward slightly, her eyes sharpening as she let her next question roll out.
   </p>
<p>
    “To be in such a vital position at Vanguard, one would assume you have some experience in law enforcement, security, or the military. Is that a correct assumption, Mr. Hughes?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes answered without missing a beat.
   </p>
<p>
    “I was a captain in the Marines. Served 15 years. Retired. I completed three tours in Iraq. Special forces.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded, her jaw tightening briefly before she forced out the words, her voice professional but clipped.
   </p>
<p>
    “Thank you for your service, Mr. Hughes.”
   </p>
<p>
    He didn’t acknowledge her thanks—not a nod, not a glance. He simply stared back at her, impassive.
   </p>
<p>
    Good.
   </p>
<p>
    She didn’t mean it.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let the silence hang for a moment before tilting her head slightly, her tone turning curious but no less pointed.
   </p>
<p>
    “When you say special forces, are you referring to a branch of the military called a Marine Raider?”
   </p>
<p>
    The slightest flicker of surprise crossed Hughes’s face. It was brief—so brief most people wouldn’t have noticed—but Agatha did. She knew she’d thrown him off.
   </p>
<p>
    He swallowed, his Adam’s Apple bobbing, before replying.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes. For five years.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded again, already knowing the answer. It had taken a ridiculous amount of favors and no small amount of leverage to unearth that piece of his past. Her government contacts had pulled strings she didn’t even know existed, and she was certain the debt she owed them now was a ticking time bomb waiting to explode.
   </p>
<p>
    Because if you thought Wall Street was filthy, the government? It was a fucking cesspool.
   </p>
<p>
    But it would be worth it in the end.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes bore into Hughes as she leaned casually against her table.
   </p>
<p>
    “What does a Marine Raider do, exactly?” she asked, her tone deceptively light. Then, without missing a beat, she added, “The unclassified version, of course.”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes’s jaw ticked.
   </p>
<p>
    It was subtle, but Agatha caught it. He didn’t like being cornered, and she was dragging him there, inch by inch.
   </p>
<p>
    “A Marine Raider,” he began, his voice still gruff but now more measured, “is responsible for direct action missions, special reconnaissance, and foreign internal defense. We’re trained to operate in hostile environments and neutralize high-value targets. Among other things.”
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Among other things
    </em>
    ,” Agatha repeated not for her but for the jury, her tone carefully neutral, though her lips twitched in amusement at his vague deflection.
   </p>
<p>
    She took a step forward.
   </p>
<p>
    “So, essentially,” she continued, “you’re highly trained to assess threats, execute operations with precision, and ensure mission success by any means necessary. Would you agree with that summary, Mr. Hughes?”
   </p>
<p>
    He shifted slightly, his posture still rigid.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha paused, letting the weight of that admission settle over the courtroom.
   </p>
<p>
    “And would you say those skills translate well into your current role at Vanguard?” she asked, her voice smooth, almost conversational, as if she weren’t about to tie a noose with his own words.
   </p>
<p>
    “They do.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded, the familiar curl of excitement stirring in her chest—the thrill of laying the foundation for her case.
   </p>
<p>
    She was building something here—brick by deliberate brick.
   </p>
<p>
    This wasn’t a criminal case, she didn’t need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that James Hughes was responsible for Brooke Sinclair’s death. This was a civil case, and all she needed was a preponderance of the evidence—a tipping of the scales that suggested her version of events was more likely than his.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha returned to the table, retrieving one of Harrison Smith's one-page logistics reports for the
    <em>
     Meridian Star
    </em>
    . She held it up, letting the jury take in the familiar document before turning her attention back to Hughes.
   </p>
<p>
    “Do you sign all logistics reports, Mr. Hughes?” she asked.
   </p>
<p>
    “No,” he replied, his voice clipped. “That would be impossible with the sheer amount of work we do—I’m only one person. I have lower-level managers who sign off.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded, taking a few measured steps forward.
   </p>
<p>
    “So, you don’t sign any reports yourself?”
   </p>
<p>
    “I didn’t say that,” Hughes snapped, his words coming out a little too harshly before he quickly caught himself.
   </p>
<p>
    He exhaled, steadying his tone.
   </p>
<p>
    “I sign off on our larger-level projects—depending on the cargo or if the destination is flagged as hostile.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips curved faintly, her gaze sharpening.
   </p>
<p>
    “I see. So, your signature indicates a higher level of scrutiny? That a shipment is significant enough to require your personal approval?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes nodded stiffly.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let the moment breathe, her silence deliberate as she scanned the jury, letting the weight of his words hang in the air. Then, she turned her attention back to Hughes, the report still in her hand.
   </p>
<p>
    “When a signature is placed on a logistics report,” she began, her tone thoughtful yet probing, “what does that mean, exactly? What do you and your team evaluate before approving a report?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes shifted in his seat, clearly considering his response.
   </p>
<p>
    “We look at the cargo contents,” he said carefully, his voice steady but guarded. “We evaluate the destination, assess current threats. We coordinate with the military and the Department of Defense to ensure they are aware of our cargo’s movement. And we select the best path to ensure the shipment reaches its destination safely.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded, her expression composed, though her mind buzzed with precision.
   </p>
<p>
    “So, you’re telling this court that every signed logistics report represents a comprehensive review—cargo, route, security, coordination with external agencies—all of it?”
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” Hughes affirmed, though a faint edge of impatience colored his tone.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Perfect
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Right where she wanted him.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned, walking back to her table where Lilia handed her a neatly prepared, vividly color-coded diagram that Rio had painstakingly put together. It compared one of the
    <em>
     Meridian Star’s
    </em>
    routes to a standard Vanguard cargo run.
   </p>
<p>
    She strode forward with purpose, handing one copy to Hughes while placing another on the display for the jury to see.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mr. Hughes,” she began, as she gestured to the diagram, “on this chart, you’ll notice two lines across the Atlantic Ocean. The green line represents the
    <em>
     Queen’s Voyager
    </em>
    , a cargo ship carrying $11.3 million worth of equipment. All details for this shipment were meticulously laid out in the standard 23-page logistics report we reviewed earlier. The ship departed from New York on June 7th and arrived at Camp Lemonnier in Africa 15 days later.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, letting Hughes and the jury absorb the clear trajectory marked on the chart.
   </p>
<p>
    “Would you consider this route and timeframe typical for a Vanguard shipment of this scale?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes glanced down at the chart, his jaw tightening slightly before answering.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes, that’s a standard route and timeframe.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips curved ever so slightly—a predator circling its prey.
   </p>
<p>
    “Thank you,” she said, her voice cool and sharp. She pivoted slightly, her hand now gesturing to the red line on the diagram, that was all over the place on the document.
   </p>
<p>
    “And this,” she continued, her tone hardening, “is the
    <em>
     Meridian Star’s
    </em>
    trajectory. A cargo ship carrying $11.2 million in ‘
    <em>
     classified materials
    </em>
    ,’ according to your one-page report. It departed from New York on April 12th, and arrived at the same destination.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused again, this time locking her gaze on Hughes.
   </p>
<p>
    “Do you notice anything... unusual about this path, Mr. Hughes?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes shifted in his seat, his eyes darting from the diagram in his hands to the one displayed for the jury. His jaw worked slightly as he stared at the red line, its erratic path unmistakably out of sync with the efficient trajectory of the green line.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s not... standard,” he admitted, his voice tight.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha tilted her head, her expression carefully neutral.
   </p>
<p>
    “Not standard. That’s one way to put it.”
   </p>
<p>
    She took a step closer to the jury, letting the diagram stay in their view.
   </p>
<p>
    “The
    <em>
     Meridian Star’s
    </em>
    route, as you can see, took nearly
    <em>
     double
    </em>
    the time of the
    <em>
     Queen’s Voyager
    </em>
    to reach the exact same destination—28 days instead of 15.”
   </p>
<p>
    She turned back to Hughes, her eyes narrowing slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mr. Hughes, can you explain why a ship carrying ‘classified materials,’ requiring such high levels of security and oversight, would take an indirect, erratic path across the Atlantic Ocean, extending its journey by almost two weeks?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes fidgeted, his hand gripping the edge of the witness stand.
   </p>
<p>
    “There could be several reasons for that,” he said cautiously. “Weather, unexpected logistical changes, ensuring the ship avoided potential hostile territories.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let his answer hang in the air for a moment before stepping forward again, her heels clicking with deliberate precision.
   </p>
<p>
    “Interesting. Because according to meteorological records, the weather was clear on the
    <em>
     Meridian Star’s
    </em>
    entire route during that time. And Vanguard’s own internal communications show no mention of logistical changes. In fact...”
   </p>
<p>
    She returned to her table, picking up a new document with a flourish.
   </p>
<p>
    “...this internal memo dated April 11th states that the Meridian Star’s path was
    <em>
     pre-approved
    </em>
    by security management. Care to guess whose signature authorized that pre-approval?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes’ jaw tightened, and a flicker of discomfort passed over his face.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yours, Mr. Hughes,” Agatha said, her voice sharp. “So, again, I ask you—why would you send a ship carrying $11.2 million in ‘classified materials’ on a route that doubled its travel time? Was it really about avoiding potential risks? Or were there... other reasons?”
   </p>
<p>
    Fox immediately rose to her feet.
   </p>
<p>
    “Objection, Your Honor. Counsel is clearly speculating!”
   </p>
<p>
    Judge Marks raised a hand to Fox but kept his focus on Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “Move it along, Ms. Harkness.”
   </p>
<p>
    She walked back to the table, her heels clicking with a deliberate rhythm, and picked up a neatly organized stack of cargo paths Rio had meticulously created for the
    <em>
     Meridian Star
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Turning back to Hughes, she approached the witness stand slowly, her expression sharp but calm, every move calculated.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mr. Hughes,” she began, holding up one of the diagrams for the jury to see, “would it surprise you to learn that the
    <em>
     Meridian Star
    </em>
    —regardless of date, weather, or geopolitical climate—routinely takes two, sometimes three, times as long as a standard cargo ship to reach its destination?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes’ lips pressed together so tightly they nearly disappeared, his discomfort palpable.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes,” he said after a moment, his voice clipped. “That does surprise me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyes gleamed as she set the records down and reached for the stack of logistics reports authored by Harrison Smith. She lifted them with a deliberate flair, the weight of the evidence clear in her posture as she approached him.
   </p>
<p>
    “Why would that surprise you, Mr. Hughes?” she asked, pausing just long enough to let the tension stretch.
   </p>
<p>
    “After all...”
   </p>
<p>
    She placed the stack of reports directly in front of him with a soft thud, her voice dropping into something quieter, sharper.
   </p>
<p>
    “You approved the path for every single one.”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes’ jaw tightened, the faintest flicker of something—panic, perhaps—passing through his eyes before he schooled his expression.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha relished the crack in his composure, knowing she was beginning to pry the lid off the jar.
   </p>
<p>
    She stepped back, letting the jury absorb the weight of her words, before continuing.
   </p>
<p>
    “So, tell us, Mr. Hughes—why would want the
    <em>
     Meridian Star
    </em>
    , a ship carrying sensitive and classified cargo under your direct approval, to take such an inefficient, erratic route?”
   </p>
<p>
    She folded her arms, her gaze unrelenting.
   </p>
<p>
    Mr. Hughes cleared his throat, his voice carefully controlled as he responded,
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s not standard. But the nature of our work can’t always accommodate a procedure. Sometimes adjustments are necessary.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha tilted her head slightly, her lips curving into a small, calculated smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “But every time, Mr. Hughes? Doesn’t that seem... suspicious?”
   </p>
<p>
    “Objection!” Fox shot to her feet, her voice sharp. “Counsel is asking the witness to speculate.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha didn’t miss a beat.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned to the judge.
   </p>
<p>
    “Your Honor, Mr. Hughes is a highly trained military professional. He is, quite literally, an expert witness in speculation.”
   </p>
<p>
    The murmurs that rippled through the courtroom were immediate, and Judge Marks raised a hand for silence. His eyes narrowed at Agatha, a warning in his gaze, but his tone was even as he replied.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’ll allow it,” he said finally, though his voice carried an edge of caution. “But tread carefully, Ms. Harkness.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned back to Hughes, her gaze locking onto his with a sharpness that made him visibly stiffen.
   </p>
<p>
    “Answer the question, Mr. Hughes,” she said, baiting him. “Using your long history in the military and examining intel, doesn’t it seem suspicious to you that every single route taken by the
    <em>
     Meridian Star
    </em>
    deviates so drastically from standard procedure?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes hesitated, the tension in the room thickening as he struggled to find a response. His lips parted, but no words came immediately.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha was getting closer, and she wasn’t about to let him wriggle free now.
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes finally exhaled, his jaw tightening as he leaned slightly forward.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s... unusual,” he admitted, his voice measured but strained. “But I wouldn’t immediately classify it as suspicious. There are many factors that could contribute to deviations.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s eyebrow arched.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Unusual
    </em>
    ,” she repeated, letting the word hang in the air like a cloud.
   </p>
<p>
    The courtroom was silent, every pair of eyes locked on Hughes.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s expression didn’t change, though inside, the shift in gears felt like sliding a blade under a gap in armor—
    <em>
     strategic
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    She tilted her head slightly, her voice calm.
   </p>
<p>
    “Did you know Brooke Sinclair?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes straightened immediately at the sudden change in questioning.
   </p>
<p>
    “No, I never met her. But I did read the email that was escalated to me. I was just looking into investigating when I found out about her suicide.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha paused, letting his words hang in the room before taking a slow step closer to the witness stand.
   </p>
<p>
    “So, just to clarify for the jury, you’re telling us that you never met Brooke Sinclair?”
   </p>
<p>
    “That’s correct.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips curled into a faint, calculated smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “Interesting,” Agatha said, pacing slowly.
   </p>
<p>
    She stopped near the jury box, her gaze sharp and calculating.
   </p>
<p>
    “Back to your military background, Mr. Hughes. From what I’ve learned about Marine Raiders, their expertise isn’t limited to just protecting assets. They excel in strategic offensives—calculated moves to neutralize threats before they can even become a problem. Would you say that’s an accurate description?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes exhaled deeply through his nose.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha tilted her head, her lips curling into a faint, knowing smile.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned and walked back to her desk. Lilia was already holding out the flash drive, and Agatha took it with a small nod of gratitude before handing it to the courtroom clerk.
   </p>
<p>
    “Could you display this on the monitor, please?” she asked, her tone calm but carrying an undercurrent of anticipation.
   </p>
<p>
    The courtroom clerk nodded, moving to the large flat-screen TV bolted to the wall, positioned perfectly for the jury and the witness to view. Meanwhile, Agatha leaned against her table, her fingers tapping softly on the wooden surface. Her gaze bore into Hughes, who stared back, his expression stoic but Agatha could see the flicker of unease in his eyes.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Oh, she was going to bury him.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “It’s all set, Ms. Harkness,” the clerk said, breaking the silence.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded her thanks, taking the pointer remote and gesturing toward the screen, which displayed a grainy, black-and-white video feed of a quiet, unassuming street. The jury leaned forward, their interest piqued, as Agatha stepped closer to the monitor.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mr. Hughes, do you recognize this street?” she asked.
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes scoffed lightly.
   </p>
<p>
    “No, it looks like any other street.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha nodded, as she picked up an affidavit from her desk, before carrying it up to the judge.
   </p>
<p>
    “This,” she began, holding the paper aloft for the courtroom to see, “is an affidavit signed by Amit Kannan, owner of the Quick Stop market on the corner of Berkley and Kline Street, here in New York City. Mr. Kannan attests that the footage was taken by my associate Rio Vidal on October 12th.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, turning slightly to point at the TV screen where the grainy footage of a street corner stood frozen.
   </p>
<p>
    “This camera,” she continued, “is positioned to capture activity on Berkley Street.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused, turning back to face the room.
   </p>
<p>
    “Brooke Sinclair lived on Berkley Street. Her townhome isn’t visible in this footage, but it’s just three houses up from where the camera cuts off. So, anyone walking toward the camera would be heading directly toward Brooke Sinclair’s home.”
   </p>
<p>
    She pivoted to James Hughes, her gaze sharp and unwavering.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mr. Hughes,” she said, her voice soft but cutting, “can you read the timestamp in the top- right corner for us?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes squinted slightly, leaning forward. The hesitation was small, but Agatha didn’t miss it.
   </p>
<p>
    “July 18th, 2019, 9:13 PM,” he said, his voice carefully neutral.
   </p>
<p>
    “And where were you on July 18th, 2019, at approximately 9:13 PM?” asked Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes immediately shook his head.
   </p>
<p>
    “That was over five years ago,” he said nearly incredulously. “I couldn’t say for sure, but I was likely at work.”
   </p>
<p>
    “You work that late?” Agatha asked, her tone almost casual.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m on call every day, all year round,” Hughes replied, his voice firm, though the defensiveness in his tone was impossible to miss. “This job keeps me very busy.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips curved, the faintest flicker of a smirk threatening to surface.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m sure it does,” she said almost mockingly.
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze never wavered from his as she brought up the remote and clicked it. The footage on the monitor shifted, zooming in on a black car parked under the dim glow of a streetlamp.
   </p>
<p>
    “Let’s talk about that vehicle, Mr. Hughes,” she said, her tone hardening ever so slightly. “Do you recognize it?”
   </p>
<p>
    He barely looked at it.
   </p>
<p>
    “No, I don’t recognize it"
   </p>
<p>
    “Are you sure?” Agatha pressed, her voice sharper now, though still maddeningly polite. “Take your time, Mr. Hughes. It’s a very distinctive vehicle—a black Cadillac with tinted windows. You’re telling me you’ve never seen it before?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes’s lips thinned, but he didn’t answer.
   </p>
<p>
    “Okay then. Let's move on shall we? Keep your eyes on that car, Mr. Hughes,” Agatha instructed as she fast-forwarded the footage.
   </p>
<p>
    On the screen, the SUV sat unmoving, all night, leaving during the day, and then returning every night.
   </p>
<p>
    “This vehicle,” Agatha continued, her voice slicing through the growing tension in the room, “can be seen on this street every night for five consecutive days. All leading up to July 23rd —the night Brooke Sinclair died.”
   </p>
<p>
    She paused the footage on the final night. The courtroom was so silent that the faint hum of the tv seemed deafening.
   </p>
<p>
    Then she pressed play again, and the screen moved, and a figure finally emerged from the SUV. Their shadow stretched long and ominous across the pavement as they began to walk down the street.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha timed it perfectly, and paused the video just before the figure stepped into the pool of light cast by a streetlamp.
   </p>
<p>
    “When I hit this button,” Agatha said, holding up the remote, her gaze sweeping the room, “that man will step under the streetlight, and we’ll all see his face. You, me, the jury—
    <em>
     everyone
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
<p>
    She turned to Hughes, her stare unrelenting, drilling into him with the force of inevitability.
   </p>
<p>
    “So, Mr. Hughes,” she said, her voice low and challenging, “I’m giving you one last chance. Would you like to change any part of your previous testimony?”
   </p>
<p>
    Hughes didn’t answer.
   </p>
<p>
    He just stared at her.
   </p>
<p>
    His face was unreadable but his silence wasn’t just damning—
    <em>
     it was everything.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    And then for the first time since he took the stand, James Hughes looked towards Madeline Fox.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned watching the look catch—watching the exact moment Fox understood what
    <em>
     that look
    </em>
    meant.
   </p>
<p>
    And then suddenly, Agatha watched the realization flickered across Fox’s face.
   </p>
<p>
    The silence in the courtroom stretched unbearably until the scratch of a chair shifting abruptly across tile floor sounded.
   </p>
<p>
    “Your Honor,” Fox said, rising to her feet, her voice tight, “the defense would like to request a brief recess.”
   </p>
<p>
    Judge Marks didn’t like delays, and the tight set of his jaw made it clear he was seconds from denying the request. But Agatha, could already see the writing on the walls.
   </p>
<p>
    “We have no problem with the request, Your Honor,” she said smoothly.
   </p>
<p>
    Marks looked at her, surprise flickering across his face, before he sighed heavily.
   </p>
<p>
    “Recess granted,” he announced begrudgingly, banging his gavel. “You may step down, Mr. Hughes.”
   </p>
<p>
    His gaze flicked between Fox and Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “You have twenty minutes.”
   </p>
<p>
    The courtroom stirred as Judge Marks stood, prompting everyone else to rise.
   </p>
<p>
    The tension that was left in the room upon his exit was palpable, thick enough to cut with a knife.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha returned to her table and sank into her chair beside Lilia, her eyes never leaving the scene unfolding across the courtroom. Hughes strode past her, glaring at her while Ratcliff immediately intercepted him, leaning in close and speaking in a hushed but urgent tone.
   </p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, Fox was glued to her phone, her posture taut with tension. Her lips pressed into a thin, unforgiving line as she glanced sharply in Agatha’s direction. Their eyes met for a brief moment, and Fox’s expression darkened further as she brought the phone to her ear.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yeah...we have a problem...”
   </p>
<p>
    Fox’s voice carried faintly, her words trailing off as she moved toward the door, her heels clicking against the floor with uncharacteristic speed.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned back slightly, arms crossing over her chest as she watched each moment of turmoil across the aisle feeding the steady drumbeat of triumph thrumming beneath her skin.
   </p>
<p>
    “You had him,” Lilia whispered, her voice cutting through the moment, low but insistent. “Why didn’t you finish it?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned her head slowly, her gaze meeting Lilia’s questioning eyes. A smirk spread across her face, cocky and full of confidence.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’ll see,” she murmured.
   </p>
<p>
    Reaching for her phone, Agatha tapped the screen to life needing the distraction.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
     100 unread emails.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
     10 messages from Billy about clients.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
     1 message from Jen.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    She opened that one and snorted.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
      “Don’t fuck it up.”
     </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes and then her attention snagged on a different message entirely.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
     1 message from Rio.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Her hand stilled, hovering above the notification. Slowly, she clicked it open.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
      “I love you.”
     </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Three words.
   </p>
<p>
    So simple, yet—the way they leapt off the screen and settled into her chest felt like a punch.
   </p>
<p>
    Her fingers hovered over her phone screen, trembling slightly, before her body seemed to move of its own accord.
   </p>
<p>
    Suddenly, the words
    <em>
     “I love you too”
    </em>
    were typed out in the reply bar, stark and waiting.
   </p>
<p>
    It was right there.
   </p>
<p>
    All she had to do was push send.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Just do it.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her thumb hovered over the button, every instinct screaming at her to press.
   </p>
<p>
    To leap.
   </p>
<p>
    But she couldn’t.
   </p>
<p>
    Her body refused to obey—betraying her as it always did when it came to Rio Vidal.
   </p>
<p>
    Because even her body knew better.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t enough to send it in a text.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     This isn’t what she deserves.
    </em>
<em>
     This would be a cop-out.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Her hand dropped from the phone, the message bar glowing on the screen, mocking her with its unsent words. She stared at it, the weight of hesitation pressing heavily on her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    "Agatha."
   </p>
<p>
    Fox's voice sliced through her internal war, snapping her back to reality. Agatha blinked, looking behind her to see Fox standing a few feet away from her. The sharp set of Fox’s jaw and the narrowed focus of her gaze told Agatha everything she needed to know before a word was spoken.
   </p>
<p>
    “A word?” Fox asked.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips twitched, half-tempted to quip back, but instead, she turned and lightly smacked Lilia on the arm, nodding for her to follow. Lilia gave her a questioning look but obeyed, the two of them standing and trailing behind Fox out of the courtroom.
   </p>
<p>
    Fox led them down the hallway with the precision of someone who knew exactly where they were going. She opened the door to one of the shareable attorney conference rooms, stepping aside to let Agatha and Lilia enter.
   </p>
<p>
    As soon as they crossed the threshold, Agatha froze for the briefest of moments, her sharp gaze landing on the man seated at the table.
   </p>
<p>
    William Vanguard.
   </p>
<p>
    Founder and CEO of Vanguard Industries.
   </p>
<p>
    One of the richest—and most dangerous—men in the world.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia faltered beside her, catching herself mid-step, but Agatha didn’t break stride. She moved forward, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took in the room. Ratcliff sat at one end of the table, his face a blank mask, but the way his hands fidgeted with a pen betrayed his unease.
   </p>
<p>
    William Vanguard, on the other hand, looked perfectly composed. His tailored suit was immaculate, his silver hair brushed back with precision, and his steely eyes were locked directly on Agatha as though she were the only person in the room.
   </p>
<p>
    Fox closed the door behind them, and the soft click of the lock seemed to reverberate louder than it should have.
   </p>
<p>
    “Ms. Harkness,” Vanguard said smoothly, his voice carrying the polished weight of someone accustomed to being obeyed. He didn’t stand or offer a hand—he merely gestured to the empty chairs across from him. “Please, sit.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s smile was laced with mock politeness.
   </p>
<p>
    “How gracious of you,” she drawled, sliding into the chair opposite him without breaking eye contact. Lilia hesitated for just a fraction of a second before following suit, her gaze darting nervously between Agatha and Vanguard.
   </p>
<p>
    Fox moved to the side of the room, her arms crossed as she leaned against the wall, her sharp eyes watching the interaction like a hawk.
   </p>
<p>
    “So,” Agatha began, leaning back in her chair and crossing one leg over the other. Her tone was casual, almost lazy, but the sharpness in her eyes was unmistakable. “To what do I owe the pleasure of this little meeting?”
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard’s lips curved into a small, tight smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “I thought it was time we spoke,” he said, before giving her a look. “Man to man, so to speak.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned back in her chair, a low, dark laugh spilling from her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    The audacity of William Vanguard was almost impressive.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Almost.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha just lifted a brow at him.
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard leaned forward, his fingers steepled on the table before him.
   </p>
<p>
    “I am prepared to settle this—
    <em>
     privately
    </em>
    ,” Vanguard said, his tone calm and measured, the voice of a man who believed he was holding all the cards. “Two hundred million. Here and now. And you drop your suit.”
   </p>
<p>
    The room went utterly still.
   </p>
<p>
    Beside her, Lilia inhaled sharply, and Agatha could practically feel the tension radiating from her.
   </p>
<p>
    Understandable—if they took the deal, the firm would pocket a seventy-two million dollar contingency fee, the largest in its history. But Agatha didn’t so much as flinch. Her expression remained unreadable, her gaze locked on Vanguard with a searing intensity that could have sliced steel.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Two hundred million
    </em>
    ,” she repeated slowly, as though testing the weight of the words. Her lips curled into a faint smirk, and she tilted her head slightly, as if considering his offer.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, she laughed again—low and mocking.
   </p>
<p>
    “You think this is about money?” Agatha’s voice was sharp, precise, each word a barb aimed straight for William Vanguard’s composure.
   </p>
<p>
    She leaned forward, mirroring his posture, the faintest glint of malice shimmering in her eyes.
   </p>
<p>
    “Do you honestly believe two hundred million is enough to make me walk away? After everything your company has done—not just to Brooke Sinclair, but to my family?”
   </p>
<p>
    The weight of her words hung in the room like a thundercloud, echoing, rumbling, and threatening to strike.
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard’s jaw tightened, his mask of corporate indifference slipping for the briefest of moments. He exhaled sharply, his hands flattening against the table as if to steady himself.
   </p>
<p>
    “I did not authorize...
    <em>
     that
    </em>
    ,” he said at last, his voice low but firm, as if the word alone could distance himself from the atrocities committed under his company’s banner.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     That
    </em>
    , of course, being the murder of Brooke Sinclair and the threats made against Agatha’s family.
   </p>
<p>
    “But I am the leader of this company,” he continued, his tone shifting—hardening. “And I acknowledge that my grandson is involved in this scheme. I want this resolved, Ms. Harkness —quietly. Efficiently. So I’ll ask again: What is it going to take?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned back slightly, considering his words, the weight of them and the man himself. William Vanguard was powerful, yes, but he was also desperate—a cornered beast trying to salvage what remained of his empire.
   </p>
<p>
    The thought made her heart pound, not with fear, but with exhilaration.
   </p>
<p>
    “Let me get this straight,” she began, her voice cool, calculated, every word dripping with controlled venom. “You want me to name my price so you can sweep this under the rug, protect your legacy, and keep your name out of every headline that screams ‘murder,’ ‘conspiracy,’ and ‘corruption.’ Is that about right?”
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard didn’t answer, but the slight narrowing of his eyes was all the confirmation she needed.
   </p>
<p>
    She tilted her head, tapping a single finger on the table.
   </p>
<p>
    “And you think money is the solution,” Agatha said, her voice laced with sharp disdain. “That throwing enough cash at me will make me forget the death threats. The attempted murder of the woman I love and Brooke Sinclair’s blood on your company’s hands.”
   </p>
<p>
    She heard the soft intake of breath from Lilia beside her, and it jolted her.
   </p>
<p>
    The weight of her own words echoed in her mind.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     The woman I love.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Oh.
   </p>
<p>
    She’d said it out loud.
   </p>
<p>
    Not to Rio, where it belonged, but here—in a room full of adversaries during a negotiation.
   </p>
<p>
    Such a Harkness, move.
   </p>
<p>
    Her chest tightened, but she shoved the thought aside. Vanguard, thankfully, seemed oblivious to the revelation.
   </p>
<p>
    “Then tell me,” Vanguard said, his voice clipped and controlled, though the tension in his jaw betrayed him. “What will it take?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let the silence stretch, her eyes narrowing as she searched for the perfect response. Her mind replayed a specific statement made by Brandon Vanguard during Fox’s cross- examination. A smug, offhand comment that had stuck with her like a thorn.
   </p>
<p>
    She leaned forward, her gaze fixed on William Vanguard, her words deliberate and slow.
   </p>
<p>
    “Your grandson and your counsel,” she said, her tone almost conversational, though the edge in her voice was unmistakable. She paused to flick her eyes briefly to Fox, then back to Vanguard. “They alluded earlier that as a ten-billion-dollar company, three hundred and sixty- one million dollars isn’t outside the realm of possibility to lose without really noticing it.”
   </p>
<p>
    Her lips curved into a faint, calculated smirk.
   </p>
<p>
    “So,” Agatha said, her voice dripping with finality, “
    <em>
     just so you really feel it
    </em>
    —make it three hundred and seventy-two. Even.”
   </p>
<p>
    The room fell into a suffocating silence. Even the faint hum of the overhead lights seemed to dim under the weight of her words.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha crossed her arms, her body language unshakable, her gaze steady as she waited.
   </p>
<p>
    This wasn’t a negotiation.
   </p>
<p>
    She was dictating terms.
   </p>
<p>
    Fox pushed off the wall, throwing Agatha an outraged look.
   </p>
<p>
    “That is absolutely ridiculous—”
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard silenced her with a single raised hand.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Fine
    </em>
    ,” he said, his voice cold as he moved to stand. “My attorneys will draft the agreement.”
   </p>
<p>
    He paused as he reached Agatha, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. There was a begrudging respect etched into his expression.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stood, meeting his gaze head-on.
   </p>
<p>
    He extended his hand towards her.
   </p>
<p>
    “I mean this with the greatest amount of respect, Ms. Harkness—but I sincerely hope our paths never cross again.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha grasped it firmly, her grip steady, her eyes unflinching.
   </p>
<p>
    But as he moved to pull away, she tightened her hold, just enough to halt him—to pull him closer to her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Get your people in line, Mr. Vanguard,” she said, her voice whispered but razor-sharp. “If your attack dog come after me or
    <em>
     mine again
    </em>
    , I can promise you one thing: our paths
    <em>
     will
    </em>
    cross again. And if you put us on that road—I can assure, I will be the only one who makes it to the end. Do you understand?”
   </p>
<p>
    William Vanguard’s jaw tightened, his expression hardening into a mask of reluctant acknowledgment before he gave a single, stiff nod.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s grip on his hand loosened, releasing him. She watched as he turned on his heel and strode out of the room, clothing the door behind him.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned back to find Lilia watching her with wide eyes, a faint smile curling on her lips— small but unmistakably proud. The sight stirred something unfamiliar and warm in Agatha’s chest, but she quickly buried it, her focus snapping to the remaining occupants of the room.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, the gang’s all here,” she quipped, her tone light and mocking as she clapped her hands with exaggerated flourish. “Let’s go tell Judge Marks about the agreement, shall we?”
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze landed on Fox and Ratcliffe, both of whom looked less than thrilled.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha arched a brow, her gaze sweeping over them, letting the moment stretch just enough to revel in their unease. Then, with a sly smirk, she flicked her fingers toward the door.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Vámonos
    </em>
    ,” she said, her tone dripping with wicked amusement, before breaking into a delighted cackle.
   </p>
<p>
    And then with her trademark flair, she pivoted sharply on her heel, the movement a seamless blend of precision and theatrics, before walking out of the room.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stepped out of the courthouse, the heavy oak doors swinging shut behind her with a sharp finality. The crisp evening air filled her lungs as she took in a deep breath, and for the first time in years, she felt something close to weightlessness. The burden she had carried for nearly five years—Vanguard, Brooke—was finally lifted.
   </p>
<p>
    It was over.
   </p>
<p>
    The preliminary agreement was signed, the case dismissed.
   </p>
<p>
    Justice,
    <em>
     albeit quiet and purchased
    </em>
    , had been served.
   </p>
<p>
    Brooke Sinclair’s parents had sobbed when she delivered the news of the settlement and they accepted the payout without hesitation. But their relief crumbled into heartbreak moments later, as the reality settled in.
   </p>
<p>
    The settlement was proof.
   </p>
<p>
    Their daughter hadn’t taken her own life.
   </p>
<p>
    She had been killed.
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard had finally acknowledged what they always knew, even if only in the shadows.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha exhaled slowly, letting the chill seep into her bones as she felt Lilia move to stand quietly to her side. And with that, Agatha's thoughts turned briefly to the firm.
   </p>
<p>
    Now, one hundred and thirty-four million dollars richer.
   </p>
<p>
    The biggest settlement in the firm's history.
   </p>
<p>
    Her lips quirked into a faint but tired smirk.
   </p>
<p>
    After a while, Lilia broke the quiet.
   </p>
<p>
    “Alice and Jen are waiting for us at Bemelmans,” she said, her voice light but carrying a spark of excitement. “Celebratory drinks are very much warranted.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha hesitated.
   </p>
<p>
    Normally, that’s exactly how she’d celebrate a victory—surrounded by admirers, a drink in hand, basking in the glow of recognition. The liquor warming her body, their compliments fueling her ego. And if there was ever a case deserving of such a triumph, it was this one.
   </p>
<p>
    But as the thought settled, she realized that wasn’t what she wanted.
   </p>
<p>
    Not tonight.
   </p>
<p>
    Her mind wandered, immediately, to Nicky’s laughter no doubt echoing through the house. To Rio likely being the reason behind his laughter.
   </p>
<p>
    Her heart flipped, happy but certain.
   </p>
<p>
    If that wasn’t answer enough, she didn’t know what was.
   </p>
<p>
    She turned to Lilia with a small, genuine smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “Rain check on Bemelmans?” Agatha asked, her voice quieter than usual.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia blinked, momentarily caught off guard by the deviation from Agatha’s typical post- victory routine. But then she really looked at her.
   </p>
<p>
    And, of course, she saw it immediately.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia’s lips curved into a warm, knowing smile.
   </p>
<p>
    “Go home, Harkness,” Lilia teased gently.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t stop the smile that crept onto her face—soft, almost bashful. But it didn’t take long for her to catch herself. She quickly masked the smile with a glare, shooting it at Lilia as if to blame her for pulling that reaction out of her.
   </p>
<p>
    Lilia met the mock glare with an infuriatingly knowing smirk that had Agatha huffing and walking away.
   </p>
<p>
    Descending the courthouse steps, Agatha strode toward her town car. Dan was already there, holding the door open without a word. She slid inside, settling into the cool leather seat as the door closed with a soft, final click behind her.
   </p>
<p>
    For a moment, she didn’t move. The weight of the day hung in the air, heavy yet strangely cathartic. Slowly, she reached into her purse, pulling out her phone. The screen lit up as she unlocked it, her fingers hesitating for a beat before navigating to her messages.
   </p>
<p>
    And there it was.
   </p>
<p>
    The words
    <em>
     I love you
    </em>
    stared back at her from the text box, still unsent to Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Dan’s voice crackled softly through the intercom.
   </p>
<p>
    “Where to, Ms. Harkness?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stared down at those words.
   </p>
<p>
    “Home, Dan. Take me home.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha wasn’t sure what to expect when she walked into the house. The lack of greeting at the door caught her off guard—odd, considering Nicky was home. She quickly toed off her heels, the relief immediate, and shrugged out of her coat, hanging it neatly on the hook by the door.
   </p>
<p>
    The faint hum of the television drifted down the hallway, its volume gradually increasing as she moved closer.
   </p>
<p>
    Sonya was in the kitchen, stirring something on the stove. She glanced up, her expression flickering with surprise at seeing Agatha home so early. But she recovered quickly, offering a warm smile.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha returned it, brief but genuine, before heading toward the living room.
   </p>
<p>
    Peeking over the back of the couch, she spotted two dark heads of hair, both facing toward the TV. Her gaze shifted to the screen, and she had to bite back a snort of disbelief.
   </p>
<p>
    A documentary about bugs.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Bugs.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Seriously?
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stepped forward, rounding the couch quietly to get a better view, and her heart nearly exploded at the sight before her. Nicky was snuggled against Rio’s side, practically glued to her as they both watched the TV intently. Rio, still wearing Agatha’s Harvard sweater, had one arm draped casually over the back of the couch, the other resting lightly on Nicky’s shoulder.
   </p>
<p>
    The sight hit Agatha like a tidal wave of warmth.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s head turned at the sound of her approach, her dark eyes going wide in surprise before softening almost instantly.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hey,” she said softly.
   </p>
<p>
    At the sound of Rio’s greeting, Nicky’s gaze flicked up, his eyes wide at seeing Agatha home way earlier than usual. But instead of scrambling off the couch to run and hug her like he usually would, he stayed exactly where he was—tucked against Rio’s side.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hi, Mom,” he said with a big smile before promptly returning his attention to the TV, clearly more interested in the documentary than her.
   </p>
<p>
    Shaking her head with a bemused smile.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Bugs.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Bugs outranked her.
   </p>
<p>
    She huffed as that she stepped forward and eased herself onto the couch, settling in beside Nicky—now sandwiched between his two favorite people. Nicky detached himself slightly from Rio, to press himself equally between them.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha reached out, fingers threading through his dark hair in a motion so familiar that he didn’t even glance away from the screen. His focus remained on the TV.
   </p>
<p>
    “I heard about the deal—congratulations,” Rio said, her voice low and warm.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha looked over at her.
   </p>
<p>
    “News travels fast,” Agatha replied with a small shake of her head, a soft smile tugging at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    “You win, Mama?” Nicky asked casually, still glued to the television, not even bothering to look up.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes with exaggerated fondness, her hand gently ruffling his hair.
   </p>
<p>
    “Of course, honey,” she said with a mock air of offense.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio snorted at that.
   </p>
<p>
    The three of them sat there quietly for a few moments, the only sound the narrator’s voice on the documentary and the occasional rustle as Nicky shifted against them. Agatha sagged into the couch, letting the weight of the day begin to melt away.
   </p>
<p>
    But after a while she felt the instinctive urge to touch Rio, and let her hand slide from Nicky’s hair, her arm draping across the back of the couch. She hesitated for a heartbeat, then let her fingers brush against Rio’s shoulders, dancing lightly over her skin before moving up to her neck, playing gently with the loose strands of her hair.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio relaxed into the touch, but her eyes turned to Agatha, locking onto her with a quiet, questioning look. Agatha’s hand in her hair wasn’t unusual—but in front of Nicky?
   </p>
<p>
    That was something entirely new.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s gaze lingered, her expression asking a silent question.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Are you sure?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Agatha answered not with words but with a gentle tug on Rio’s hair, a small, playful pull that drew a smile to Rio’s lips. Then, just as easily, her fingers returned to their soothing rhythm, combing through Rio’s dark strands.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio sighed softly, her eyes fluttering closed as she leaned into Agatha’s touch, contentment radiating from her like a warm glow. They sat like that for a few quiet minutes, Agatha’s fingers threading lazily through Rio’s hair, the gentle murmur of a narrator discussing some beetle playing softly in the background.
   </p>
<p>
    The silence stretched, peaceful and unbroken, until Rio’s voice emerged, carrying a weight of quiet curiosity.
   </p>
<p>
    “How does it feel?” she asked, her words soft. “To finally get them... to be done with it?”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha let the question hang in the air for a moment, her fingers pausing briefly before continuing their movements. She contemplated her answer, carefully turning the words over in her mind.
   </p>
<p>
    Honestly, she wasn’t sure how she felt about it. For years, she’d envisioned this exact moment. She had imagined what it would feel like to take Vanguard down, to win against all odds, to come out on top. In her mind, the victory had always been accompanied by a surge of power, an intoxicating high that she believed would fuel her for the rest of her career.
   </p>
<p>
    But now, sitting here with Nicky curled between them and her fingers threading through Rio’s hair, the reality was so different.
   </p>
<p>
    Vanguard—her white whale, her ultimate victory—felt so insignificant in this moment.
   </p>
<p>
    Because, as corny as it sounded,
    <em>
     this
    </em>
    —Nicky and Rio, together—
    <em>
     with her
    </em>
    , this was her real win.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha felt the thought settle deep in her chest, warm
    <em>
     and so fucking unshakable
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze fell to Nicky, nestled comfortably between them, his wide-eyed focus locked on the screen. He looked so content, so at ease—
    <em>
     so happy
    </em>
    . Everything she wanted him to be.
   </p>
<p>
    Then her eyes shifted to Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio, who had taken her by complete surprise. Rio, who had walked into Agatha’s meticulously controlled life and flipped it upside down like a snow globe, scattering all her carefully laid pieces and rearranging them into something far more beautiful, far more chaotic, and yet—far more alive.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, her throat tight as the weight of the question and this moment settled over her. She wasn’t used to this—to feeling her heart so full it threatened to burst. But as she looked at the two of them, her son and the woman she loved, she realized something undeniable.
   </p>
<p>
    It wasn’t the power she’d chased or the victories she’d stacked like trophies.
   </p>
<p>
    It was this.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     It was them.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Without fully realizing what she was doing, her fingers slid behind Rio’s neck, curling gently, and she tugged Rio forward. Rio’s eyes widened slightly, but before she could say anything, Agatha’s lips met hers in a soft kiss, right above Nicky’s head.
   </p>
<p>
    The kiss lingered just a moment before Agatha pulled back, her forehead brushing lightly against Rio’s. Her heart hammered in her chest, but this time, she didn’t hesitate.
   </p>
<p>
    “I love you,” Agatha whispered, her voice barely audible, yet carrying every ounce of truth she felt.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio blinked, utterly still for a beat, as if the world itself had paused. Then, slowly, that beautiful radiant smile—the one always made Agatha’s heart lurch in her chest—bloomed across her face, reaching her dark eyes making them almost glimmer.
   </p>
<p>
    “I love you too,” Rio murmured, her voice thick with emotion.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha leaned in, kissing her again, this time softer, as though sealing the words into each other.
   </p>
<p>
    “Ew, gross,” Nicky’s voice piped up, cutting through the tender moment.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha pulled away abruptly, expecting to see him looking up at them in horror. Instead, his eyes remained glued to the television, his hand out stretched and pointing at it.
   </p>
<p>
    “Look how many legs that bug has,” he exclaimed, scrunching up his nose in exaggerated disgust.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha turned toward the screen, her own nose wrinkling at the sight of a massive, multi- legged creature crawling across it.
   </p>
<p>
    She shivered too, because he was right—that was disgusting.
   </p>
<p>
    “That’s
    <em>
     eumillipes persephone,
    </em>
    ” Rio said smoothly, beating the narrator to the punch. “It has the most legs of any known animal—up to 1,306.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha rolled her eyes fondly because—of course, Rio would know that.
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze drifted to Rio, who watched the alien-like bug crawl across the screen with genuine interest, her brow slightly furrowed in concentration. There was something so quintessentially Rio about it—her effortless intelligence.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips curved into a smile, unbidden and warm. A familiar feeling blossomed in her chest, spreading outward like sunlight breaking through the clouds.
   </p>
<p>
    She recognized it now, clearly and unreservedly:
    <em>
     her love for Rio.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    “Mama,” Nicky said, pulling her attention away from Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha looked down to find him staring up at her with that soul-piercing blue eyes of his. He reached up, his small hand brushing her cheek.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re smiling,” he said so innocently, yet so yet profound.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s chest tightened at his words—and at the gentle touch of his small fingers tracing the faint lines on her face. Lines that had she was more than aware had grown more defined lately, not from stress or worry, but from the sheer amount of smiling she’d been doing.
   </p>
<p>
    Since Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    Her gaze flicked upward to the woman in question, who was watching the interaction with an expression so achingly soft it made Agatha’s breath catch in her throat.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha swallowed hard, shifting her attention back to Nicky.
   </p>
<p>
    Today had already been full of admissions she never thought she’d voice, but this one came more easily. It felt natural, as though saying
    <em>
     I love you
    </em>
    had opened some hidden door inside her, one that now let all her vulnerable truths flow freely.
   </p>
<p>
    “It’s because I’m happy, baby,” Agatha said, her voice soft and tender.
   </p>
<p>
    Nicky’s face lit up at that, his thumb gently tracing the curve of her smile as if committing it to memory.
   </p>
<p>
    “I like it when you smile, Mama. It’s my favorite,” he said with childlike certainty.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s gaze lifted to Rio, who was watching the exchange.
   </p>
<p>
    Without a word, Rio’s hand came up to cover hers.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mine too,” she murmured in agreement.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s heart swelled, her fingers tightening around Rio’s as she glanced back at Nicky.
   </p>
<p>
    She had spent her life chasing power—commanding boardrooms, conquering courtrooms, bending the will of some of the most powerful men in the world.
   </p>
<p>
    Power had been her fuel, her purpose,
    <em>
     her identity.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    But now, sitting here with Rio’s hand in hers, Nicky tucked close, she realized:
    <em>
     this was power.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Not the fleeting, transactional power of deals and victories, but something deeper, something enduring.
   </p>
<p>
    The power to be seen.
   </p>
<p>
    To be loved.
   </p>
<p>
    To love.
   </p>
<p>
    To build a life that was hers undeniably hers.
   </p>
<p>
    Her fingers squeezed Rio’s again, and she smiled softly, feeling the warmth of it spread through her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Mine too,” Agatha echoed, her words reverberating out of her mouth with a newfound strength, a quiet, undeniable certainty.
   </p>
<p>
    And it was in that moment, surrounded by the family she never thought she deserved, Agatha Harkness—the Witch of Wall Street—realized she had finally found the one thing she had been chasing all her life.
   </p>
<p>
    True power.
   </p>
<p>
    And God—she felt invincible.

<p>
   Wow. Honestly, I can't believe its over. This journey has been nothing short of incredible. Thank you to all the
        kudos and comments, they have truly fueled me to write.
  </p>
<p>
   The Epilogue is already planned and will be a 2 year jump into the future. I am hoping to get it up before the
        new year, but we will see. Once again, thank you all so much :)With her trademark flair, she pivoted sharply on
        her heel, the movement a seamless blend of precision and theatrics, and swept out of the room with
        purpose.

   Chapter Notes
   <p>
    This epilogue practically wrote itself. Tonight, I found myself with an unexpected gift— time. With my wife out for drinks and child at a sleepover with my MIL, I had the rare opportunity to write uninterrupted.
   </p>
<p>
    So here we are—it’s done.
   </p>
<p>
    I’m not sure if I feel more relieved or emotional—maybe a mix of both? This epilogue has been in my head for a long time, and seeing it finally come to life after sitting as a rough draft for weeks feels incredibly satisfying.
   </p>
<p>
    I truly hope you all enjoy it.

2 years later
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sat in her leather chair, one leg crossed over the other, as the soft glow of her office lamp illuminated the sleek, organized space. The New York Times article was splayed across her desk, the bold headline Vanguard’s Ghosts: A Legacy of Violence nearly jumping off the screen. She scrolled further, pausing at the photograph of James Hughes in handcuffs, his jaw clenched and his eyes blazing with fury as he glared into the camera.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips curved into a slow, satisfied smirk.
   </p>
<p>
    That glare—it felt personal, as though Hughes had aimed it squarely at her.
   </p>
<p>
    And, to be fair, he had every reason to.
   </p>
<p>
    If it hadn’t been for her civil case against Vanguard, the mountains of evidence unearthed thanks to Rio’s work, and her ability to leverage that evidence in open court, he would have walked away unscathed.
   </p>
<p>
    When William Vanguard had first offered the Sinclair family and Agatha an NDA and a generous payout, it had been a chess move. On the surface, it seemed like the company was tying up loose ends, silencing their adversaries with a gilded gag. But Agatha had seen the opening, the weak spot in the armor, and she’d taken it.
   </p>
<p>
    Getting the Sinclair's to sign had been a delicate negotiation. They had balked at the idea of silencing Brooke’s voice, of letting Vanguard appear to sweep their daughter’s death under the rug. But Agatha had assured them, that this wasn’t the end—it was a pivot.
   </p>
<p>
    They had trusted her to take the case, and they trusted then as well, and they signed.
   </p>
<p>
    The payout was substantial, but it wasn’t the money Agatha cared about—it was the clause. The NDA barred her from disclosing what she knew about Vanguard’s actions, but nowhere did it prohibit her from other forms of influence.
   </p>
<p>
    That loophole became her weapon.
   </p>
<p>
    She made a series of generous donations to key political figures the following year, each accompanied by well-placed hints. An investigation into Vanguard, she suggested in private meetings, would be the perfect statement piece for any ambitious politician’s platform. After all, as she’d pointed out coyly, the FBI already had all the evidence they needed—the case files shared
    <em>
     before
    </em>
    the NDA had been signed.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     And what do you know?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Within months, those long-forgotten case files were resurrected, breathing new life into an investigation that had once seemed doomed to gather dust on a shelf. The wheels of government bureaucracy turned slowly, as they always did, but with Agatha’s subtle prodding, momentum built. Over the years that followed, subpoenas were issued, testimonies were painstakingly collected, and the walls began to close in on Vanguard’s dirty little secret.
   </p>
<p>
    In the end, justice caught up with them.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha smirked to herself, the edges of her lips curling as she scanned the article. It felt like finally reaching the last page of a book she'd been eager to finish for two long years. And now—now she could finally close that book, slide it onto her shelf, and move forward.
   </p>
<p>
    Her moment of quiet triumph was interrupted by a knock at the door. Without looking up, she assumed it was Billy, probably with another client update or an unnecessary stack of paperwork.
   </p>
<p>
    “Come in,” she called distractedly, still scrolling through the article.
   </p>
<p>
    The sound of multiple footsteps made her glance up, and her eyebrows shot up in surprise.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen, Alice, and Lilia walked into her office.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s brow furrowed immediately, her mind racing to figure out why they were here. She mentally scanned her calendar—no meetings, no case updates, no glaring oversights she could think of. The blankness of it all left her uneasy, so she defaulted to what had always been her best defense when blindsided by this trio.
   </p>
<p>
    Resigned, she leaned back in her chair, narrowing her eyes at them.
   </p>
<p>
    “I didn’t do it,” she said preemptively.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen arched a brow, Alice smirked, and Lilia outright snorted.
   </p>
<p>
    “Relax, Harkness,” Jen said, crossing her legs. “You’re not in trouble. For once.”
   </p>
<p>
    Relief flickered through Agatha, though she didn’t fully trust it. Rising from her chair, she walked around the desk, her nails drumming a steady rhythm against the wood as she rounded toward them. Her sharp gaze landed on Jen.
   </p>
<p>
    “Now you’re making me want to misbehave, Jen,” she teased, taking a seat across from them and letting her eyes sweep over the trio.
   </p>
<p>
    She flicked her hand, gesturing for them to get to the point.
   </p>
<p>
    “So, what’s this all about?”
   </p>
<p>
    The three women exchanged glances, a silent battle of wills playing out between them. That alone was enough to set Agatha on edge. These weren’t just any women—they were powerhouses, each one as formidable as she was. For them to hesitate? It meant whatever they were about to say, Agatha probably wasn’t going to like.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, Lilia exhaled a long-suffering sigh, muttering under her breath, “c
    <em>
     owards
    </em>
    ,” before squaring her shoulders and meeting Agatha’s gaze head-on.
   </p>
<p>
    “We need you to talk to Rio.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, utterly caught off guard. For a moment, all she could do was stare at Lilia, before dragging her eyes to Jen and Alice, both of them nodded in confirmation—albeit a little shaky.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sat back in her chair, mind whirling as to why
    <em>
     she
    </em>
    —of all people was being asked to talk to Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    “Why? What did she do?” Agatha asked, her tone equal parts curiosity and amusement.
   </p>
<p>
    Jen gave her a pointed look, clearly unamused.
   </p>
<p>
    “She’s on a rampage, Agatha. She’s making the first-year associates cry. She’s turned the bullpen into a warzone where people are afraid to even breathe in her direction.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha snorted, unable to hide her amusement. If there was one person in the firm who had zero tolerance for coddling the first years, it was her.
   </p>
<p>
    But the situation still puzzled her. Why were they bringing this to her?
   </p>
<p>
    She leaned back, crossing her arms as her mind churned.
   </p>
<p>
    “Correct me if I’m wrong,” she said, her voice taking on that sharp, mocking edge, “but there’s a very lengthy HR document on file that explicitly states I have no say or authority over Rio due to our... relationship.”
   </p>
<p>
    She let the words hang in the air, her gaze sliding over the three women.
   </p>
<p>
    “And you two,” she continued, pointing at Lilia and Jen, “are practically the patron saints of rule-following. So why, exactly, are you coming to me with this?”
   </p>
<p>
    The room went silent.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s sharp eyes scanned their faces, and as she really looked at them, realization struck.
   </p>
<p>
    Her eyes widened, her mouth falling open in disbelief.
   </p>
<p>
    “Wait—are you... scared of her?” she asked incredulously.
   </p>
<p>
    The three partners exchanged hesitant glances, their silence speaking louder than words.
   </p>
<p>
    Finally, Alice cleared her throat, shifting slightly in her seat before meeting Agatha’s gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    "Agatha—your wife is terrifying," Alice said, her wide eyes emphasizing the point. "She
    <em>
     literally
    </em>
    growled at me yesterday when I pointed out her page numbers were off on the brief she sent me."
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha bit her lip, fighting to keep the grin threatening to break across her face.
   </p>
<p>
    One... she would
    <em>
     never
    </em>
    tire of hearing someone call Rio her wife. Just the thought of it sent a warm flutter through her chest, and instinctively, her fingers found the wedding ring on her hand—a sleek gold band with a stunning 3-carat dark gray diamond at its center. She twirled it almost absently, a habit she developed since Rio placed the ring on her finger a year ago.
   </p>
<p>
    And two... the idea of Rio growling at Alice? It had her on the verge of actual giggles because she could picture it so vividly because Rio had been very spicy lately...understandably so.
   </p>
<p>
    Little did the partners know though, she had been trying—and failing—to get Rio to take even the smallest step back from work. Not to stop entirely, because that wasn’t who Rio was, but to ease off the accelerator just enough to catch her breath.
   </p>
<p>
    It was like trying to convince a hurricane to take a day off.
   </p>
<p>
    She sent a look toward the partners, noting the faint hopefulness etched on their faces.
   </p>
<p>
    It was almost amusing.
   </p>
<p>
    They clearly thought Agatha took the more dominant role in her relationship with Rio. She was older, wildly successful, and carried a presence that commanded any room she walked into. Of course, they would assume she was the one steering the ship at home.
   </p>
<p>
    But that couldn’t have been further from the truth.
   </p>
<p>
    Sure, Agatha had a say—of course she did. They were a team, a
    <em>
     great fucking team
    </em>
    , one that moved in sync and complemented each other in ways Agatha had never thought possible.
   </p>
<p>
    But Rio?
   </p>
<p>
    She was a force of nature.
   </p>
<p>
    That natural order of all things.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio never let Agatha “dominate” anything unless they were in bed, and even then,
    <em>
     that
    </em>
    was only on the rare occasion Rio allowed it.
   </p>
<p>
    Their dynamic was entirely flipped from what anyone might expect.
   </p>
<p>
    And Agatha didn’t mind in the slightest—she loved it.
   </p>
<p>
    But
    <em>
     they
    </em>
    didn’t need to know that.
   </p>
<p>
    So, Agatha sighed, adding just the right amount of exasperation for dramatic effect.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fine. I’ll talk to her,” she said, injecting as much bravado into her voice as she could muster —like she had any chance of accomplishing what they were asking without having the kitchen sink hurled at her head—metaphorically of course.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha had just stood up from the chair and was halfway to the door when a thought struck her. She stopped, turning slowly to face the three partners, her eyes narrowing suspiciously.
   </p>
<p>
    “Wait a second,” she said, crossing her arms. “You three have
    <em>
     never
    </em>
    hesitated to air your grievances with me. Does this mean”—her gaze sharpened as she pursed her lips—“you’re more scared of her than you are of me?”
   </p>
<p>
    The idea sounded impossible, ridiculous even, as she said it.
   </p>
<p>
    But the words had barely left her mouth before the replies came in unison.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yes.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Absolutely.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Without a doubt.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha blinked, completely stunned by the rapid-fire responses. Her mouth opened and closed as she tried to find a rebuttal, but for the first time in a long while, she had nothing.
   </p>
<p>
    The three partners exchanged smirks, clearly enjoying her rare moment of speechlessness. Agatha shot them a glare, as she turned on her heels and walked out the door.
   </p>
<p>
    On her way to Rio’s office, her mind was already working overtime.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Scarier than me?
    </em>
<em>
     Rio?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The idea was ludicrous.
   </p>
<p>
    She wasn’t sure whether to be insulted or impressed—or maybe a little of both.
   </p>
<p>
    Her fingers danced at her side as a mischievous glint creeping into her eyes.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     If they think I’ve gone soft, maybe it’s time to remind them who they’re dealing with.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Nothing too dramatic, of course.
   </p>
<p>
    Just enough to reestablish her dominance and put some respect back on her name.
   </p>
<p>
    Still, the fact that anyone thought
    <em>
     Rio
    </em>
    was scarier than her?
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha snorted.
   </p>
<p>
    "Ridiculous," she muttered under her breath, but her steps slowed as she approached the door to the best office in the third-year hallway. Her hand hovered over the handle as she paused, Rio’s mood this morning flashing in her mind like a neon warning sign.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha Harkness wasn’t scared.
   </p>
<p>
    She was being cautious.
   </p>
<p>
    She was being smart.
   </p>
<p>
    And...
    <em>
     oh
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Her lips pressed into a tight line as the realization hit her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     She was being a little bitch.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The thought was like a slap across the face, and it snapped her out of her hesitation.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha Harkness didn’t back down from challenges—not in the courtroom, not with corporate overlords, and certainly not with her wife. Even if
    <em>
     said wife
    </em>
    had, over the past few months, perfected a glare so fierce it looked like she was ready to reap your soul.
   </p>
<p>
    With her signature flair, Agatha pushed the door open and stepped inside, her gaze sweeping over the space as a familiar mix of affection and amusement tugged at her lips.
   </p>
<p>
    It had been Rio’s office for only four months, yet it looked as though she’d occupied the space for years. Rio, in true fashion, never did anything half-assed. Her office was a seamless blend of structure and life, like a greenhouse masquerading as a workspace.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t say a word about it, though, considering every single plant in this room had been her doing. One for Rio’s first office. Another to celebrate her first chaired case. Another for her first win, and then her second-anniversary at the firm. And, of course, there were more than a handful of "apology plants" scattered about—peace offerings for when Agatha’s foot had firmly lodged itself in her mouth.
   </p>
<p>
    The result was less an office and more an art gallery of rare, expensive plants. Rio loved them all, treating each one with the meticulous care that only she could manage.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha couldn’t name a single one.
   </p>
<p>
    But Rio?
   </p>
<p>
    She knew every single one, down to the tiniest detail.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s smirk deepened as her eyes landed on Rio, seated behind the desk, completely absorbed in the document before her.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     God, she was beautiful.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Not that this was news—Rio always looked beautiful—but today, she seemed to glow. It was an understated radiance, the kind that left Agatha a little breathless if she thought about it too long.
   </p>
<p>
    Without even glancing up, Rio spoke.
   </p>
<p>
    “What brings you to my neck of the woods, my love?”
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     My love.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    No matter how many times Agatha heard it, the soft flutter in her chest was always the same.
   </p>
<p>
    She stepped forward and took a seat in one of the dark leather chairs—ones she’d gifted Rio during her first year. Afterall, if Agatha was going to sit in Rio’s office, she was going to be comfortable.
   </p>
<p>
    “So...” Agatha began slowly, watching Rio’s reaction to her words. “I need to talk to you about something. And I need you to not bite my head off.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio didn’t look up immediately, but Agatha didn’t miss the slight tension in her jaw. Her wife’s eyes stayed fixed on the paper, as though determined to finish whatever she was reading first. After what felt like an eternity, Rio set the document aside and leaned back in her chair, finally meeting Agatha’s gaze.
   </p>
<p>
    “I make no promises,” Rio said evenly, her eyes narrowing just enough to make Agatha feel like she was being sized up for battle.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha fought against the urge to fidget. Give her a high-profile suit or a high-stakes negotiation any day. Hell, throw her into a boardroom with ten stuffy old white guys who loved to mansplain corporate law—she’d take it all over this conversation.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     But this?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Convincing her wife to take a step back from work?
   </p>
<p>
    This felt like walking into a lion’s den with a steak necklace.
   </p>
<p>
    “Honey...” she started, her tone laced with forced sweetness.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s narrowed eyes sharpened even further, cutting through Agatha’s attempt to soften the blow with a pet name.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha sighed, and decided to bite the bullet.
   </p>
<p>
    “The partners,” she began, bracing herself, “have asked that you... maybe take a step back. Work from home a couple of days? Or even take some time off?”
   </p>
<p>
    The silence that followed was deafening. Rio leaned back in her chair, her expression inscrutable as she regarded Agatha with the weight of a thousand unsaid words.
   </p>
<p>
    And then, finally, she spoke.
   </p>
<p>
    “They asked?” Rio said slowly—dangerously, her jaw tightening. “
    <em>
     Or did you plant the idea?
    </em>
    ”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha winced internally, knowing exactly why Rio would jump to that conclusion. After all, the new plant sitting proudly on Rio’s desk—was the most recent apology plant. Agatha had bought it after their last attempt at this same conversation went spectacularly south. Not her finest hour, and certainly not Rio’s most forgiving mood. The fallout, despite the plant’s hefty price tag, had left Rio a little tender on the subject.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha immediately held up her hands, palms out, a gesture of surrender.
   </p>
<p>
    “I did not—I swear,” she said earnestly.
   </p>
<p>
    They didn’t lie to each other.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Ever
    </em>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    Not even when it would have been easier.
   </p>
<p>
    Not even when it hurt.
   </p>
<p>
    That softened Rio slightly, her posture relaxing just enough for Agatha to notice. She tilted her head, her gaze sharp but tinged with curiosity.
   </p>
<p>
    “Why? I’m still operating at my usual capacity.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha lost the fight against a smirk as her next words bubbled up.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re making the first years cry too much,” she said, almost proudly. “Which, as you know, I fully support. But apparently, it’s creating a ‘
    <em>
     hostile environment
    </em>
    .’”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes widened in mock outrage, her mouth opening to launch into what Agatha was sure would be a fiery retort—until a visible wince crossed her face. Rio closed her eyes and her jaw tightened as she took a deep, controlled breath.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha instantly sat up straighter, the smirk vanishing as her worried gaze locked onto Rio.
   </p>
<p>
    She held her breath, every nerve on high alert.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio took a few more deep breaths before opening her eyes and leveling a pointed look at Agatha.
   </p>
<p>
    “Come talk to your daughter,” she said, exhaling a frustrated huff. “She’s been a menace all day.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha stood, a sly grin creeping back onto her face as she moved around the desk.
   </p>
<p>
    “Funny, the partners said the same thing about you,” she quipped.
   </p>
<p>
    But her teasing trailed off as she rounded the desk and saw Rio’s very, very pregnant belly fully on display now, unobstructed by the desk. Agatha’s heart did that thing it always did when she saw it—flipped, softened, and swelled all at once.
   </p>
<p>
    A soft smile spread across Agatha’s face as she moved forward, lowering herself onto her knees in front of Rio. Her hands reached out instinctively, smoothing over the curve of Rio’s stomach. The firm kicks that met her palm were immediate, startlingly strong, and drew a sharp hiss from Rio above her.
   </p>
<p>
    “She’s treating my insides like a rage room,” Rio huffed, her voice a perfect blend of exasperation and reluctant affection.
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, she
    <em>
     is
    </em>
    my daughter,” Agatha quipped, her lips curling into a smirk. “And, if given enough time, I can turn any room into a rage room. She’s been in there for 38 weeks, my love —of course, she’s going to rage.”
   </p>
<p>
    She leaned closer, her face softening as she directed her attention to Rio’s belly.
   </p>
<p>
    “I know you’re getting antsy in there, sweetheart,” she murmured, her tone shifting to something gentler, though still playful. “But I happen to be very partial to your
    <em>
     mami
    </em>
    , and you’re not making this easy for her with all your little tantrums.”
   </p>
<p>
    In true to Harkness fashion, her daughter responded with a firm kick against Agatha’s hand.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio groaned above her, a sound that was half frustration and half pain.
   </p>
<p>
    “I swear,” Rio said through gritted teeth, glaring down at Agatha like it was somehow her fault. “I know she doesn’t have your DNA, but you’ve clearly managed to pass your attitude down to her anyway.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Well, she developed her ears like 10 weeks ago,” Agatha said, smirking as she gently rubbed her hand over the swell of Rio’s stomach. “I can’t help it if she’s already picked up on my stellar personality.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio groaned, rolling her eyes as she sank further back into her chair.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fantastic. She’s going to come out negotiating nap times and winning arguments by sheer force of sarcasm.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Only if we’re lucky,” Agatha teased, leaning in to press a soft kiss to Rio’s belly. “But let’s face it—she’s going to be a powerhouse. Just look at her parents.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips quirked into a smile despite her irritation, her fingers ghosting across Agatha’s cheekbone.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re way too proud of her already, and she’s not even here yet.”
   </p>
<p>
    “Of course I am,” Agatha said, tilting her head up to meet Rio’s gaze. “She’s already making her mark, even if it’s on your bladder.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio couldn’t help but laugh at that, though the motion made her wince slightly.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha was instantly alert, concern flickering across her face.
   </p>
<p>
    “Are you really okay?” she asked, her voice softening as her hand stilled on Rio’s belly.
   </p>
<p>
    “I’m fine,” Rio reassured her, though her voice carried the unmistakable weight of fatigue. “She’s just... very active today.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line. The past couple of weeks had been grueling. Rio was barely sleeping, and their daughter seemed determined to test her limits with relentless kicks and flips, as though preparing for her debut with a vengeance.
   </p>
<p>
    “Honey,” Agatha said softly, her voice stripped of its usual bravado, replaced by pure, unguarded warmth. She reached for Rio’s hand, threading their fingers together gently. “I know you don’t want to step back. But you can’t keep pushing through this on sheer willpower alone. You barely slept last night, and I can see how exhausted you are. And now, with her kicking you like this...”
   </p>
<p>
    Her voice trailed off, but the concern in her eyes spoke volumes.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio sighed, leaning her head back against the chair, her free hand coming to rest over their intertwined fingers.
   </p>
<p>
    “I just... I hate the idea of slowing down,” Rio murmured, her voice tinged with frustration and weariness. “Of feeling like I’m not doing enough.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha squeezed her hand gently.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’ve already done more than enough, my love. The partners wanted me to remind you— and I’m quoting here—
    <em>
     that you’ve doubled your peers’ billable hours and brought in three times the revenue this year alone
    </em>
    . Slowing down? You’d still be miles ahead of everyone else.”
   </p>
<p>
    She leaned closer, her free hand brushing softly over Rio’s belly, where their daughter gave another assertive kick.
   </p>
<p>
    “You’re not slowing down, honey. You’d just be moving at the same pace as everyone else for once.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio huffed a quiet laugh, a small smile breaking through the stubborn tension on her face.
   </p>
<p>
    “That’s not exactly comforting, you know.”
   </p>
<p>
    “No?” Agatha arched a brow, a teasing glint in her eyes. “Then let me put it another way: you can take a step back because you’ve earned it. And, selfishly, I want you to—because I need you to take care of yourself. For her.”
   </p>
<p>
    She pressed her hand gently to Rio’s belly.
   </p>
<p>
    “And for me.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s eyes softened, her resistance finally cracking under the weight of Agatha’s words.
   </p>
<p>
    “I hate it when you’re right,” she muttered, her voice tinged with reluctant affection.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s lips quirked into a smug grin.
   </p>
<p>
    “Must be so hard for you to be with me, then—since I’m always right,” Agatha quipped, her grin unapologetically smug.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio huffed, arching an eyebrow at her.
   </p>
<p>
    “Not always
    <em>
     wise,
    </em>
    though—considering you think making smart comments to your very pregnant wife is a good idea.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha laughed softly, leaning in to press a kiss to Rio’s hand.
   </p>
<p>
    “I am Agatha Harkness, darling. I live on the edge. It keeps things interesting.”
   </p>
<p>
    Rio rolled her eyes but didn’t pull away.
   </p>
<p>
    “Interesting isn’t the word I’d use,” she muttered, though the corner of her mouth betrayed a faint smile.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha smirked, squeezing Rio’s hand gently.
   </p>
<p>
    “You love it.”
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Debatable
    </em>
    ,” Rio shot back, but her smile widened as she looked at Agatha. Her expression softened as she leaned back into the chair, exhaustion momentarily forgotten. “I do love
    <em>
     you,
    </em>
    though.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s smirk faded into something warmer
   </p>
<p>
    “I love you too,” Agatha said, the words rolling off her tongue with an ease she still wasn’t entirely used to.
   </p>
<p>
    She still didn’t say them often, but this moment warranted it.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s lips curved into a soft smile, one that quickly twisted into a grimace as she winced in pain.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha immediately felt the sharp, determined kick against her palm.
   </p>
<p>
    “Hey, none of that now,” Agatha chided gently, addressing the culprit inside Rio’s belly.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio groaned, her hand pressing against the swell of her stomach.
   </p>
<p>
    “Sing her that song,” she said through gritted teeth. “The one that always settles her down.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha raised an eyebrow, her expression incredulous.
   </p>
<p>
    They were at work, and if anyone walked in on her singing to Rio’s stomach, her reputation would undoubtedly take a hit.
   </p>
<p>
    “Agatha,” Rio said firmly, sensing her hesitation. “If you want me to go home and stay home, I need to be able to walk. And for that to happen,
    <em>
     she
    </em>
    needs to calm down.”
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha was backed into a corner.
   </p>
<p>
    “Fine,” Agatha huffed, glaring down at Rio’s stomach as if her daughter could see her displeasure. “But if Jen catches me doing this, I will never live it down. And you—” she pointed a finger at Rio “—will never hear the end of it.”
   </p>
<p>
    Another sharp kick.
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     Agatha
    </em>
    ,” Rio said, her tone bordering on a growl.
   </p>
<p>
    “Yup, yup. I’m going,” Agatha muttered, resigned. She took a steadying breath, shooting another wary glance at the door, and then began, her voice a low melodic cadence.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     “Seekest thou the road to all that’s foul and fair”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Rio leaned back in her chair closing her eyes, her breathing easing almost immediately.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Gather sisters fire, water, earth and aira
    </em>
<em>
     Darkest hour, wake thy power, earthly and divine
    </em>
<em>
     Burn and brew with coven true and glory shall be thine
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Their daughter responded too, the fierce kicks softening into faint, rhythmic movements beneath Agatha’s hand, as if soothed by the melody.
   </p>
<p>
    Agatha’s voice softened further as she continued to sing, her fingers tracing lazy circles over Rio’s belly.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Down, down, down the road
    </em>
<em>
     Down the witches' road

<em>
     Down, down, down the road
    </em>
<em>
     Down the witches' road
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The song was one she’d carried with her for years, though she rarely thought about its origins. It was an old tune she’d learned from her eccentric elderly neighbor—a woman who her mother had sworn was both a witch and the devil.
   </p>
<p>
    Naturally, that made Agatha seek her out because coincidently, Evanora called Agatha the same thing.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Circle sewn with fate
    </em>
<em>
     Unlock thy hidden gate
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Turns out, the woman was neither witch nor devil, just a lonely widow who had taken an unexpected shine Agatha. When Evanora was off on one of her infamous benders, Agatha would slip away to the widow’s house. She’d sit at the old woman’s worn kitchen table, eating food that tasted real.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Marching ever forward
    </em>
<em>
     'Neath the wooded shrine
    </em>
<em>
     I stray not from the path
    </em>
<em>
     I hold death's hand in mine
    </em>
<em>
     Primal night, giveth sight
    </em>
<em>
     Familiar by thy side
    </em>
<em>
     If one be gone, we carry on
    </em>
<em>
     Spirit as our guide
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    The widow always sang this song when she cooked. Said it was passed down through the women in her family, and since Agatha was the closest thing she’d ever have to a daughter, she taught it to her.
   </p>
<p>
    It had stuck with Agatha ever since.
   </p>

     Down, down, down the road

    It stuck with her through the chaos, the fights, and the aching loneliness of her childhood years. It became her battle cry, her lullaby, her anchor. When Nicky was sick, lying in a hospital bed, she’d sung it to him too, softly stroking his hair while his small body fought so hard against what was trying to take him from the world.

    And when Nicky noticed Rio wincing at their daughter’s increasingly ferocious kicks, he’d been the one to suggest Agatha sing it to her.
   </p>
<p>
    “It always makes me feel better,” he’d said matter-of-factly, as if that alone was reason enough.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio, of course, had lit up at the idea. Encouraging it with her signature grin, knowing full well how mortified Agatha would be singing to her wife’s stomach. But Agatha never backed down from a challenge.
   </p>
<p>
    And so, she sang.
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     The road is wild and wicked
    </em>
<em>
     Winding through the wood
    </em>
<em>
     Where all that's wrong is right
    </em>
<em>
     And all that's bad is good
    </em>
<em>
     Through many miles of tricks and trials
    </em>
<em>
     We'll wander high and low
    </em>
<em>
     Tame your fears, a door appears
    </em>
<em>
     The time has come to go
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Much to her surprise—and Rio’s amusement—the fiery daughter calmed immediately.
   </p>
<p>
    And now, it was the only thing that seemed to soothe her.

    She smiled softly, her voice carrying the last verse with all the love and warmth blooming in her chest.
   </p>
<p>
    “ Follow me, my friend ,” she sang, her gaze lifting to meet Rio’s.
   </p>
<p>
    Rio’s tired eyes softened. Her lips curved into a faint, tender smile, and Agatha felt their daughter’s restless movements still beneath her palm.
   </p>
<p>
    And then Rio’s hand came down, their fingers intertwining. The subtle bump of their wedding rings against each other sent a quiet ripple of meaning through Agatha—a reminder of the life they had built, and the one they were still creating.
   </p>
<p>
    As the last words of the song left her lips, Agatha felt it settle deep in her chest, filling her with a peace she never thought she’d have.
   </p>
<p>
    “To glory at the end.”
   </p>
<p>
    THE END.

<p>
   What a journey this has been.
  </p>
<p>
   I am going to take a break for a while, but I do have some plans for future stories, one being a spin off from
        this one, from Rio's POV.
  </p>
<p>
   Okay...well...I will see you when I see you. Its been fun :)
