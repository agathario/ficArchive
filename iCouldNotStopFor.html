<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>"Mama."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had had this dream before. This nightmare.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama, wake up."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was nudged forcefully in her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was new.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was touch. Touch was physical. Touch wasn't possible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pressed her fingertips down. As they pushed into the softness of the mattress, she frowned, she was in her bed. In the same bed she had been in in Westview. How could she forget the lumpy mattress?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was that impatient replica again. Agatha squinted her eyes open, keeping them narrow in case it was a trick. But no. It wasn't a trick. Stood in front of her, with a mop of brown hair falling over his little forehead was her son. Her boy. Her baby. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you said you wanted to sleep in, but I'm hungry and I wanted to make you breakfast but I can't reach the top cupboard where the Lucky Charms are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicholas,” Agatha’s breath escaped her as she sat up. Her eyes searched for him, his face, even down to the dinosaur pyjamas he wore. His determined expression didn't change as he stood expectantly in front of her. His blue eyes they had shared were firm in their determination.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I just wanted to make you breakfast in bed," he huffed. Agatha reached out almost hesitantly, afraid her hand would pass through him but instead it made contact with the soft strand of his hair. He was real. She pushed his hair from those determined eyes as she tried to form any words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's very kind of you, Nicky," Agatha whispered. Afraid if she raised her voice in the slightest he would disappear. His name on her lips felt foreign. It had been so long since she had spoken his name aloud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky's cheeks bloomed as he blushed over his complexion. "So, are you getting up to come help?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His impatience was intoxicating. Agatha shifted, suddenly aware that she was in nothing more than a lace slip. What the hell was going on?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why don't you get the bowls and milk ready?" Agatha suggested. "I'll be there in a minute."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're not going back to sleep," Nicky accused, his eyes narrowing as his arms folded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No," Agatha reassured softly, pushing her own hair from her face. It was still long and curled. Still getting in her way. "I won't go back to sleep."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky turned, clearly accepting her words and made his way to the doorway of the bedroom. Agatha turned as he did and began looking around the bedroom. Her bed was the same green vine leaf duvet cover and her closet was still the same. It looked exactly as she had decorated it before going under Wanda's curse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda's curse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Was that what this was?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha wasn't so sure. Wanda was meant to be dead. Besides, Wanda didn't know about Nicky. No one did except-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama?" Agatha turned back to Nicky as he stood in the doorway. His brow dipped impatiently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll be there in just a second," Agatha reassured as she moved to exit the bed. The seven year old took it and left the room. Peeling back the covers, Agatha scoured the room. Everything was exactly as she recalled it in every significant detail. Except her locket. Opening the clasp, she gasped. Her locket wasn't filled with his hair. It was empty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking around, everything else was identical. With a sigh, she lifted the robe draped over the chair in the corner and made her way downstairs. Pulling it over her bare shoulders and tying the tie tightly, she braced herself at the foot of the stairs as an excited giggle passed through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Chocolate chip- No- Blueberry- No - Nutella!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How about all three?" Agatha's spine froze at the voice. Panic filled her. She couldn’t let her take Nicky again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She moved without thinking but halted at the doorway because sitting on the counter was Nicky, a wide grin on his face and Rio stood in her shirt and hair tied back, just like Agatha remembered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama, look! Mami's home!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha forced a fake smile. "I can see that."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I missed you, Mami," Nicky admitted and Agatha watched Rio's entire being soften.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I missed you too, buddy," Rio placed a soft kiss on his temple and Agatha couldn't help the emotion clog her throat. "Hey, why don't you do me a favour? Why don't you go get the cartoons ready and I'll begin making the mix huh?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like a flash, Nicky was gone, leaving them alone. Agatha immediately rounded on Rio, Rio who's gaze was hard and void of emotion. Just as she had been when they had met in London and again in the middle of the Atlantic upon the unsinkable ship. It had been rare to get a rise from Rio but that didn’t mean Agatha hadn’t tried. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What the hell is going on?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio frowned back at her. "This wasn't you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you really think I'm that much of a masochist?" Agatha hissed. Her anger rose by the second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's lips pouted as she tilted her head. "You know we were always pretty liberal."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not when it came to this." Agatha snapped. "Not when it came to him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's seriousness returned, her eyes darkening. "Are you lying to me?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course, I'm not," Agatha huffed. "I didn't do this."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked around slowly. Her eyes drifting over items, her head tilting this way and that. Eventually, she sighed. "It all feels real."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But it can't be." Agatha whispered, her denial kicking in until one little glimmer of hope peaked through. "Can it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I carried him through myself," Rio's dark gaze locked on hers. "I know he was at peace."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But," Agatha's mind tried to catch up but all she could feel was the hand on her shoulder. The one he had pressed into her shoulder not ten minutes ago. "I felt him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So did I," Rio whispered. Looking around once more, the cosmic entity huffed and began pulling out a large bowl and whisk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What are you doing?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What does it look like?" Rio gestured to the eggs in her hand. "I'm making our son pancakes."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We don't know what the hell is going on."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know that my son is in there and is real. Feels real, has a soul that I can sense," Rio hissed. "So, I'm going to do what I should have always done."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And what's that," Agatha drawled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm going to be there for him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that was how Agatha stood at the dining room table with coffee in her hand as she flicked through the Westview Reporter. Half her gaze was trained hard on Nicky and Rio. His brow scrunched tight as he added the ingredients to all three pancake batters. Honestly, just because Rio was a cosmic entity that could make her form how she wished didn't mean Agatha could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"All right," Rio praised. "Now let's see if we can flip them."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha wasn't really sure who was having more fun making the pancakes, Nicky or the immortal being who somehow had spilled batter over the counter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Can I try, Mami?" Nicky asked, his eyes wide and hopeful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sure-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No." Agatha snapped and it made both turn. Rio's brow drawn close, her lips immediately downturned in anger. But it was Nicky's confused pout that made her stutter. "Maybe, let Mami, do it first? It can take some skill."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky accepted it, stepping out of the way and Rio's brow arched at hers in a smug win. It was infuriating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Alright here we go."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's first attempt landed on her ceiling. The second on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Maybe third times the charm," Nicky said hopefully. Rio at least smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Maybe it'll land on her head." That earned her a glare. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched from the corner of her eye as Rio’s concentration focused and attempted the task. She didn't expect Nicky to cheer and jumped when he did. His eyes alight with an excitement she hadn't seen in centuries. She dared to glance at Rio. Rio who watched with a mirrored expression. One of awe, like she had never heard anything like it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha wondered if she had. She thought of their time together, just her and Nicky, and she found tears welling at the memories of them running around together, exploring the states. Constantly moving. Rio had barely been there for most of his life, it was harder then. There were more souls to ferry and collect. It meant she had to be in more places than one. But now? Now something had shifted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took another four attempts before Rio got the hang of the pancakes. As all seven year olds, he was bored, turning back to her and leaning into her side. Without thought, she pushed his hair from his forehead, earning a toothy smile up at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Will we sit at the table for breakfast?" She asked like it was the most natural thing in the world. Nicky happily nodded, moving to set the table like it was what they did every Sunday morning. As Agatha reached for the paper a hint of silver caught her eye. She had a ring. Not just any ring, it was her ring. The one Rio had given her all those years ago. But it was on the wrong finger, or right finger, she supposed. With it was a simple silver band, one that sat perfectly on her ring finger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled her hands to herself as if she had burned and traced the two bands. She hadn't felt rings there in centuries. Not since before. Not since the decision to have Nicky was made. Not since Rio herself broke the rules.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama, can we have orange juice?" Nicky pulled her from her thoughts and Agatha took a deep breath, transported back to this crazy reality she found herself in. Nicky stared patiently up at her as he waited and Agatha quickly nodded. Habitually, she moved to the giant fridge freezer that no longer had a dent in it as a consequence of Rio flinging her against it. Without thought, she pulled the carton from the fridge and poured three glasses. Her eyes caught Rio who watched her with a veiled look, one Agatha had seen before but couldn't put her finger on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking her head as she walked away from the dark eyes, she set the glasses down and settled beside Nicky, who grinned back up at her with the happiest smile she could only just recall from a different time. "So, what do you think about the pancakes?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky laughed at her as Rio set the large stack on the table. It may have been exactly 427 years since she had parented Nicky directly but something still stirred within her at the thought of all the sugar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"They're gonna be great," Nicky grinned, holding his plate up to Rio who happily set two down. Agatha half expected her to settle at that but then there was a hand waiting expectantly for her own plate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's jaw moved once, twice and found herself staring into that subtle smirk that had her more riled than she'd care to admit. Her jaw snapped shut as a brow arched and lips pursed. Pushing aside the flustered nature that Rio put her in, she pushed her plate into the taller woman's hand. It was brief, barely there, but as Rio's warm touch grazed Agatha's own, she felt herself tense involuntarily. She quickly pulled her hand back and put it in her lap. She wasn't ready to feel Rio, in any capacity. Setting the plate down, she dared to meet the dark eyes that settled next to her. Dark eyes didn't leave her own and Agatha shifted under the gaze. It stirred something within her. Something she had hidden away for a very, very long time. Something, she had tried not to let slip onto their journey on the road. The road-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A scrape of a knife on the plate made her turn. Nicky's brow was deep as he attempted to cut the pancake himself, his tongue sticking out one corner in concentration. Something endearing stirred in her as she asked. "You need assistance there?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky's blue eyes looked up at her wide and irritated. "Mama."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a soft laugh, she reached over and like it was 1750 again cut the meal on his plate. Once she finished, she sat back and her eyes connected with Rio's, whose head tilted ever so slightly to one side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's the plan?" Rio eventually broke the silence. Her question was pointedly directed at Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You need to help me with my Halloween costume, Mami."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That made Rio's brows shoot up. Her dark eyes falling on their son. "I do?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky looked almost apprehensive as he said, "You promised."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I did?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You don't have to go work again do you?" Something fractured inside Agatha's chest and even Rio visibly crumbled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm not going anywhere," Rio reassured, reaching across the table to squeeze his arm. "I promise."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky accepted the words as he focused on his plate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Did you decide on your costume?" It distracted Agatha, her mind drifting to the Maximoff Twins from a time before, their excited grins in their superhero costumes grinning up at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama, you said you'd help too." Nicky whined. "You didn't forget too?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I was just teasing," Agatha laughed off quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, if I'm going to be a wizard then you shouldn't tease me, I can put you under a spell!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt something in her panic, something deep in her gut and she shared a laugh with Rio who looked back at her with as much confusion as she felt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"A wizard huh? Not a witch?" Agatha pressed a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Johnny Malkin's says boys are wizards and girls are witches," Nicky pouted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, that's not true at all," Rio jumped in, leaning forward a little eagerly as she rested her forearms on the table. "I know plenty of boy witches. They're just warlocks."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not wizards?" Nicky's brow scrunched.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nah," Agatha reassured, brushing his hair from his eyes. "Wizards need help to tap into their magic. Witches and Warlocks are born with it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What kind of help?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Normally with rings or other kinds of items, it comes to us witches naturally." Agatha explained softly, it made Nicky ponder a moment before he nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I think I get it," Nicky said, moving back to his pancakes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So, um, what specifics do you need with the costume?" Rio asked, sipping the orange juice in front of her. It gave Agatha a moment to really take in the scene around them. They were literally playing house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I need help making a broom," Nicky said, shovelling the last of the pancake on his now chocolate covered face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"A B-Broom?" Rio stuttered. Agatha's brow arched. Rio had never stuttered in her long life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah," Nicky nodded. The underlying 'Obviously' was there. "You and Moma had brooms in the older days."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well that was a bit different," Rio protested weakly. "There weren't cars or bikes or well, any decent mode of transport."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Exactly," Nicky nodded. "If I'm going to be Wizard or or Warlock, then I need a broom."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned to Agatha for help. With the best sickly sweet voice she could muster, she grinned. "You heard your son, he needs a broom."</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>It was certainly one thing teasing Rio about their son being on a broom, but it was a completely different matter seeing it in action. As soon as they started to clear up, Nicky off to wash the gross sweet treats of his face, she grabbed Rio's arm. She knew the result would be Rio grabbing her own wrist and spinning her, pinning her to the counter with inhuman strength.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You are not putting my baby on a broom."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio softened, "I have no intention of sticking him on a broom."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to step back but Rio was close, the smell of cut grass in the rain. The hint of pine in her nose made it almost intoxicating. "We-We need to work out what this is."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's eyes drifted lower, to Agatha's lips. "What do you remember?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's breathing felt hard, her nerves fraying and her need to escape higher. Agatha swallowed. "We were at the end. I wanted my prize."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And?" Rio pressed, her nose brushing Agatha's.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I kissed you," Agatha recalled. "I tried to take-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's finger shot up pressing a finger to her lips silencing any recollection. Agatha’s brow knitted. It didn't make sense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama?" Nicky's voice called.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, baby?" Agatha asked back, she didn't miss the way Rio's head tilted, listening but her finger traced patterns on her jaw line that had Agatha's heart rate doubled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I need help," Nicky's insistence immediately made Agatha give in. She pushed past Rio before stopping at the foot of the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This conversation isn't over."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky's emergency was his outfit for Halloween. "You know most people don't start getting ready for All Hallows Eve until nightfall."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You need to help me stitch it Mama."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Stitch it?" Agatha's jaw dropped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah," Nicky nodded, "It needs to be all floaty."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Floaty?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And dark." Nicky added holding up the black cloth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Right," Agatha nodded. She took the fabric from him and turned. Hopefully where ever the hell they had ended up she might have a sliver or magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once everyone was showered and dressed, Agatha began to take stock of her new realm. The house was exactly as she had fantasised about with Rio. But it was in Westview, it was that idiot mans house she’d commandeered when she had tried to steal Wanda's powers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Setting the bunch of fabric on the dining room table, she sat, rolled her shoulders and with practised ease she flexed her fingers summoning her power from deep within. Nothing happened. Stretching her neck, she tried once more, her concentration on the flow of it through her veins, the desire of her power to assist her in her need. Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed, her frustration etching out. The thunder of the stairs revealed Nicky in his jeans and t-shirt, a hoodie draped over his shoulders and arms full of cardboard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's all that for?" Agatha couldn't stop herself, she didn't want to miss a moment of this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's for my broom." He practically vibrated with excitement. As if on queue, Rio descended the stairs in a simple black sweater, rolled to her elbows. Her jeans and shoes made Agatha's breath hitched. It wasn't something she had ever expected to see.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"On his bike," Rio added, her hand curling around his shoulder as she stopped beside him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood, slowly approaching them, as if she got too close Rio might snatch him away once more. "I see and where are you going to be riding-" Nicky scowled and she quickly corrected course. "Sorry, flying off to?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mami says that the appropriate prot-protocols are to fly together," Nicky recited with wide blue eyes. It reminded Agatha of the road. Of their ritual escaping the Seven.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next words out her mouth tasted like ash. "And she's right. Which means we don't want you going anywhere without both of us."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky rolled his eyes. His huff clearly indicated that he thought  his mother was being over reactive. But it was Rio that made her lookup with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nicholas."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Course, Mama."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why don't you get your bike ready?" Rio suggested, far more softly than her previously warning tone and waved him in the direction of the back yard. Without another thought, Nicky bounced off out the backdoor and Rio rounded on her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can't go anywhere, Agatha."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It immediately put her on the backfoot. "What do you mean?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't have my normal power."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So you have no power?" Agatha practically choked on her words. Rio completely defenceless was something else entirely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, I have my normal, Death powers." Rio clarified. "But I have nothing else. I can't teleport, I can't shift out of this form. I can feel it, but it's not there."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Interesting," Agatha folded her arms over one another and tapped a finger to her lips. "So if I was to stab you, would you die?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You know that's not how being cosmic works."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't know how it works because you never told me," Agatha bit out. Her anger rose with every word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's not exactly something I can put into words for a human to understand," Rio snapped and Agatha felt victorious. It was always hard to get Rio to crack. But now, without the protection of her powers, she was cracking and it showed in the downward tilt of her lips. "Do you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you think I would tell you if I did?" Agatha arched a brow as she rested against the door jam.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Agatha," Rio took a step towards her but Agatha only lifted her chin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No," She said with a purse of her lips. "I don't have anything."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not even a spark?" Rio pressed, stepping closer. She took Agatha's hand almost forcefully and Agatha ripped it from calloused hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, nothing." Agatha huffed. As she did, she watched Rio place her hands on her hips and huff. Dark hair shielding her face. "Not exactly as much of a walk in the park as you thought being mortal?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn't help the goading but Rio's jaw clenched as she looked back at Agatha. Her nostrils flared and her fingers ticked in the impatient way she got. Agatha saw it. The faint glint of a black band on Rio's finger. It made her stomach twist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's mouth opened to likely lash back at Agatha but as she did, the backdoor swung open. "Mami! Come on! I need the scissors and tape!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's look of death softened as she turned with a forced smile. "Of course, let's go," She said, walking to the kitchen with practised ease and collecting what they needed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a slam of the door, Agatha was left in silence. With a sigh, she pushed from the frame and looked around. She was in some kind of alternate world, she was sure of it. The house wasn't as dark as it had been, it was still all dark woods but the couch was light and far less man child that Bohner had. On the walls were photos of Nicky she knew couldn't have existed and her breath caught in her throat as she traced them. One of him at a lake, smiling at the camera. Another with him on Rio's shoulders laughing. One of him as a baby on the mantle. Another of Rio and Agatha stood in the shadows but there was no mistaking their silhouettes with their foreheads pressed together. On the stairs, there was more. Nicky picking out a pumpkin, him holding Senor Scratchy. Another of Agatha pregnant. A photo of the three of them at the top of a hill.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tears rolled freely down her cheeks as she lifted a hand to trace them. They hadn't had this life. They never had. Who was cruel enough to give it to them now? </span>

  <p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha hated manual labour. In fact, she hated it so much she was ready to burn the damn fabric in front of her. The only thing stopping her was the excited look Nicky had given her when he pushed the costume into her hands. So, once she had gotten over the heartbreak of the photos that surrounded her, she collected herself, deciding she would investigate later once Nicky was asleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After stabbing herself for what felt like the 700th time with the needle and thread, she held the costume up. It wasn't her finest for sure but it wasn't awful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The backdoor slammed open as Nicky raced in, his eyes alight. “That looks awesome.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart grew about four sizes at his words. “You think?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah!” He rushed to her side as he eyed the material. “I’m going to look so cool.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sure are, bud,” Rio chuckled as she stepped in, clapping the boots on the mat as she did. Like it was second nature. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky grinned and bounced off to his room. Rambling something to himself about Senor Sratchy needing his own costume. Agatha slightly winced for her familiar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Since when do you know how to sew?" Rio began as she stepped further into the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha glowered openly at the woman. "Since I was thirteen."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's brow arched at the hostility before her smirk that Agatha was growing to have a serious love hate relationship with. "It's a long time to remember a skill like that."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, when you have my mother as a teacher it's literally beaten into you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's eyes softened as she stepped closer, her voice dropping so only they could hear. "Have you worked out what this is yet?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No clue." Agatha sneered as she looked around her home once more. "Anything outside?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You mean in the greenhouse with rare and exotic plants only a green witch could keep alive?" Rio said and Agatha glared. She didn't need the snide remarks. "No. Just a soccer ball, Nicky's bike and standard garden items."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're not planning to tie me to the trellis again are you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's grin was practically feral as she leaned close to her. "Only if you ask for it, baby."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed, pushing past the witch and into the kitchen. She needed coffee or wine or bourbon or anything to get her through this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So what could it be?" Rio asked, looking around. "Another hex?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I doubt that could hold you," Agatha countered. "An illusion?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I already told you, I don't have all my power." Rio said, her irritation showing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"A curse?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Curses don't happen like this," Rio looked around. "You and I both know that."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed. "Well then what could it be?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned to Rio who shook her head, her dark eyes landing on the photos on the wall. She watched the witch walk and take in the fantasy Agatha knew they both had. Some part of her was pleased to watch the pain flicker across Rio's face. The way her head tilted at the photo of Agatha heavily pregnant made her turn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I remember you like this," Rio muttered. Agatha stood taller, her walls flying up as fast as she could make them. "You were so beautiful carrying him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If you mean scrambling in the woods in labour," Agatha snarked but Rio turned, her dark eyes soft and it pierced Agatha to the spot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I used to listen, when you thought I wasn't there, to the stories you would tell him in your belly about our adventures."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha could remember it. She remembered it like it was yesterday. "Don't." She didn't want to recall any of it, just to have it all slip away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's gaze dropped and she turned back to the living room, she stepped around, Nicky's toys scattered the floor as the TV played.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What about something else?" Agatha distracted. "Another realm?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. "No, we're not allowed to jump across the multi-verse."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You mean-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That there's other version of our lives?" Rio continued. "Yes, but there's billions of them, and we wouldn't be in another one so easily. I certainly wouldn't."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why not?" Agatha couldn't help her curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, "because I'd be stepping on another Death's yard. I have my job. My realm in our universe. Another version of Death has theirs."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha chewed on the information before she huffed. "Great, so we're still no further forward."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Maybe we play it out?" Rio suggested with a shrug as she settled on the chair she frequented while Agatha was under Wanda's curse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Play it out?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah," Rio leant backwards. Her face and voice softened. "This is the life we dreamed of my love."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't call me that."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's features hardened. "You can't stand there and tell me part of you doesn't want this? Doesn't want to watch him grow up?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's cruel, Rio." Agatha choked. "I gave up on that dream when you took him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I told you I could only give you more time." Rio growled. "I broke so many rules for you Agatha."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No you didn't," Agatha scoffed. "You toyed with me. You gave me what I thought we wanted and then you snatched it away."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I didn't have a choice." Rio was now standing, her hands twitching like they did when she was getting ready to fight, to draw on her power.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You are literally life and death," Agatha laughed. "Of course you had a choice!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Stop!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both turned to find Nicky standing on the stairs. His brow drawn tight as he looked between them. His lower lip wobbled. "Don't fight."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's hands went to her hips. "Nicky-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We weren't fighting, bud," Rio softened, as she lowered herself to his height. "We were just having a disagreement."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's fighting," Nicky argued back and Agatha tried not to laugh at his pedantry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We didn't mean for you to hear us," Agatha smiled, pushing her hair behind her ear. "We're sorry."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded, slowly descending the stairs and stepping into Agatha's space, his arms wrapping around her waist as he buried his face into her hip. "I don't like it when you fight."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's knee's practically gave out as she slowly knelt and wrapped her arms around his thin frame. "I'm sorry."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't do it again." Nicky's small order had her pressing her cheek to his hair and meeting dark eyes. An unspoken agreement fell between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We won't," Agatha whispered. "We promise."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded back at Agatha in silent agreement as she stepped forward and ran her fingers through his hair. "Promise, </span>
  <em>
    <span>mijo</span>
  </em>
  <span>"</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Once Nicky was content that they were in fact telling the truth, he settled with Agatha on the couch, curled into her side while Rio made herself scarce. She hoped feeling the disappointment from their son for the first time might scare her off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat with one of his books as she listened to him read aloud for her. She had missed his voice, the little scrunch of his face as he concentrated hard. But it was peaceful and it was nice even as melancholy set over Agatha's bones when she reminded herself none of this was real. Maximoff might have been right with her twins. Maybe the bad guys could have a happy ending?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course their peacefulness was ruined by Rio slamming through the backdoor. Nicky jumped and instinctively, Agatha pushed him behind her, glaring at the intruder. Immediately, however, Agatha laughed. It spilled from her in probably the most undignified way she could imagine. Because practically spilling from her arms were three of the largest pumpkins Agatha had ever seen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If we're going to do this equinox properly," Rio announced as she set them on the table. "Then we're carving pumpkins."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky was off the couch faster than she thought he could move. "They're huge!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned almost manically as she nodded. Agatha rolled her eyes as she set the book on the coffee table and stood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What do you think, Nicky?" Agatha tried to enthuse, she must admit she shared Lilia's feelings about Halloween. "What are you going to carve to keep the ghosts away?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky giggled and Agatha glanced up at Rio to watch her lip curl. She really did hate ghosts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I wanna make a proper one!" Nicky giggled, his blue eyes wide with wonder and excitement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All Agatha could do was smile back at him. "Alright then."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her kitchen was a mess. That was the only regret Agatha had as Rio and Nicky expertly scooped out the guts of the pumpkins into the trash.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It stinks!" Nicky squealed as Rio taunted a handful of seeds into his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's growing its next life," Rio explained as she set the seeds to the side with expert hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Maybe we can grow some for next year?" Nicky asked with bright eyes and Rio and Agatha shared a panicked look. Would there be a next year?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We can certainly try," Agatha smiled down at him as she tried to contain the mess of her kitchen. Honestly, it was pancakes round 2. "Now can you both try and keep the guts to the trash? I don't need the house smelling like rotting vegetables."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky giggled as he finished his scrapping across the bottom of the pumpkin. "Mami, I'm ready to carve."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked at Rio who's eyes were alight with excitement and she settled beside him. "I'll do the main cutting ok, the knife's sharp."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky dutifully nodded, and Agatha watched closely as Rio carved the pumpkin under his quiet instruction. Once the main cut was done, Rio handed him a much duller knife. One approved by Agatha herself. Agatha continued watching them out of the corner of her eye as Rio and Nicky made their pumpkins. Her own was one of a cat while Rio's to her vague understanding was supposed to be the flower she expertly carried. It took most of their afternoon and once Nicky announced his finished, Agatha placed the tea lights inside as they positioned them by the front door. As they did, Agatha took a moment to look onto the street. It was decorated for Halloween, pumpkins and signs lined the drives.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So it's not limited to our house?" Agatha pondered and Rio shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Doesn't look that way."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama," Nicky ushered bouncing on his toes. "Come on, we have to get ready."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In true fashion of wherever the hell they had landed up, two costumes hung in the closet. A witch and a grim reaper's outfit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm going to quote Lilia," Rio drawled as she looked at it. "This is demeaning."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Put it on," Agatha grumbled. She'd already been down this track with Wanda. "Or you'll face the wrath of your son."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn't take long before Nicky was dragging them down the street. Agatha in her pointed hat and Rio with her black cloak and scythe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey, Vidal family!" Herb? Was that his name? Agatha couldn't remember, called over to them with a wave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha forced a smile on her face. "How's it going?" Agatha dared to ask. She hated this town.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh you know, trick or treaters are always super excited." He laughed. "Looks like little Nicky's got a good costume this year. You make it yourself?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why?" Agatha immediately jumped to defence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Looks good that's all," he laughed. "Man, wish I had moms like you growing up."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey Herb," Nicky grinned up at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey little man," so his name was Herb, Agatha recalled. "You ready to get a good haul in this year?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah," Nicky laughed. "Have Tommy or Billy been around yet?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha and Rio shared a sharp look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not yet but I'm sure they won't be far behind." He smiled before looking to them both. "How's business, Rio?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another glance was shared and Rio smiled, "oh you know, booming."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sharply elbowed the witch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio quickly cleared her throat. "But busy."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sharp tug on her dress had Agatha looking down to Nicky. "Come on Mama, I don't want to be behind."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course," Agatha smiled, running a hand over his gelled hair. "Candy waits for no one."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It was nice to see you," Rio waved off as they were dragged down the street. Nicky dragged them from house to house where they listened to Nicky sprout trick or treat. On the rare occasion someone asked for his trick, he began to sing. Agatha more than once had to turn away to hide her tears. As they walked, Nicky held her hand tightly as they walked around the neighbourhood. Eventually however, they came to Wanda's old house and Agatha visibly stiffened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey Nicky," Rio tugged them back. "Why don't we do some apple dunking in the house?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha mouthed a soft 'thank you'. Nicky accepted it, his sack now full of candy that Agatha silently dreaded. Walking home, she felt herself drift closer, her arm around Nicky's shoulders as Rio's hand brushed the base of her back. The Scythe resting on her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You know, it suits you," Agatha hated that she leant into the touch. "Almost better than your dagger."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"My knife is a bit more subtle than this handheld lawn mower," Rio huffed as they rounded into the drive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It could be worse," Agatha laughed. "You could have the modern portrayal as your costume."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Isn't that what this is?" Rio snarked as Nicky led the way into the house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned on the stoop and smirked, "you're missing the boney parts, honey."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha brushed her fingers along Rio's jaw and the taller witch jerked back with a sneer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It clicked in Agatha's mind. "You're stuck in this form aren't you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted as she set the scythe against the wall. "I can't say I'm thrilled about it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Missing making grown men weep at the sight of you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, pushing past Agatha into the house. "Please, you love that form."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes as she removed her shoes and the cloak. "You know the form I really love?" Agatha asked, stepping close into Rio's space as she shut the front door. "The transparent one. The one where I can't hear or see you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled darkly. "Well unfortunately you're stuck with this one, baby."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed but she couldn't help but drag her eyes over Rio's dark form, all muscle and darkness. Her long fingers curled on the frame and it made Agatha's breath hitch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking her head, Agatha moved away from the temptation. In the kitchen, Nicky was pulling apples into a large basin. Where he had found both Agatha didn't want to know. The pair moved into the dining room where Nicky was attempting to climb on her oak table to position himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are we sure about this, sweetheart?" Agatha couldn't help but ask. The wild grin he sent her made her glance rather uneasily at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio for the most part looked a bit baffled. "Well, you can't say he isn't embracing his heritage."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Last time I checked none of my coven were drowned."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No," Rio's lips pursed. "But you did nearly drown on the Road."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No one drowned on the road," Agatha scoffed with an eye roll but Rio's arched brow sobered her. R.I.P. Mrs Hart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Alright," Agatha diverted her attention back to Nicky. "Shall we?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who's judging?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama's judging." Nicky announced with a proud puff of his chest. If only he could be that proud of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arched a brow of challenge to the older witch to her left and Rio looked less than impressed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure the original green witch isn't afraid of getting a little wet?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's gaze darkened as she stepped close to Agatha. "It's not me that's going to be wet, my love."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's spine straightened as her heart raced. Her arms broke out in goosebumps as Rio's breath tickled her ear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Come on, Mami!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes, of course, my prince," Rio grinned, moving the chairs they had sat at that morning and braced her hips against the table. Nicky was expertly leaning over but Agatha held up a hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just in case anyone thinks of cheating," Agatha made a pointed look at Rio, who only rolled her eyes. Of course. Then Agatha was slipping a cloth over the taller woman's eyes. Rio made a noise in the back of her throat that thankfully only Agatha caught.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She ignored it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do I need a blindfold, Mama?" Nicky's sweet voice asked and she smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course not," Agatha quickly waved off. "I trust you completely."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He grinned back at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Everyone ready?" There were nods and Agatha counted down. "3, 2, 1. Go!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both plunged their heads into the water and she kept a close eye on Nicky. Unfortunately, he was struggling in comparison to Rio. Agatha silently wondered if the green witch was using some form of power to pull the apples in her direction. Of course, she couldn't let Rio win and Nicky lose. Without a second thought, her hand pushed down on Rio's dark hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio came up sputtering at the same time Nicky sat up victorious with an apple between teeth. Agatha cheered for her son as Rio wiped the water from her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well done, Nicky," Agatha grinned at Rio who frankly looked murderous. Handing Nicky a towel, Agatha moved around the table collecting the basins. Reaching up, she whispered into Rio's ear, her lips brushing the shell of her ear. "Don't be a sore loser."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time Agatha cleared up, and wiped her hands of the sticky toffee residue Nicky had left across most surfaces thanks to his mucky paws, she was exhausted. She didn't remember him being this full on. She wondered if it was different, that wherever they were meant he was more of a boy than when he was when he was actually alive. The pain in Agatha's chest returned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking her head, she moved, keen to get out of this witch get up. A glance at the clock on the wall showed it was getting closer to dinner. As if on queue, Nicky appeared, wide eyed and bouncing on the balls of his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama, I'm hungry, can I have some of my sweets?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Agatha could respond, Rio was on his heels. "How about we have some actual food? Then we can have candy if you're still hungry?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky was quick to nod and again with oddly practised ease, Rio moved into the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Since when could you cook?" Agatha asked under her breath as Rio opened the fridge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please," Rio scoffed. "We both know you would sooner burn this house to the ground than be able to cook a meal."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's jaw dropped. "I will have you know-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's brow arched and Agatha's jaw snapped shut. The witch was right, disgustingly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm going to to go get changed." Agatha huffed. She strode from the kitchen with a wave to Nicky who happily turned and followed her up the stairs to his own room. Agatha changed and pulled her hair into a loose bun as she stepped onto the landing. As she did, she found Nicky curled on his floor, his chin resting on his knee as Senor Scratch hopped around him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey," Agatha breathed, stepping into the room. Nicky looked up with that little smile of his. Agatha settled on the floor beside him, bumping her shoulder to his. Like 250 years hadn't passed. "Penny for your thoughts?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky shook his head and shifted closer, burying his head into Agatha's shoulder just as he had done as a baby. The wind was knocked from Agatha's body as she wrapped her arms around his small body. He settled in her lap and just curled there as Agatha held him. Running her fingers softly through his hair as she softly hummed. She didn't know how long she just held him, her own eyes squeezed shut to hide away the tears that threatened to spill. A soft knock on the door frame had her looking up at dark eyes. Dark eyes that were filled with pain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Dinner's almost ready," Rio whispered and Agatha pulled away ever so slightly to look at Nicky's face. He rubbed his eyes as he sat up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why don't I run you a quick bath and we get the pj's on?" Agatha asked. She had never said those words in all her life and yet it felt like the most natural thing in the world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Can we watch Nightmare before Christmas?" Nicky asked and Agatha looked at Rio for help. She didn't know why Lady Death might know what that was but from her wide eyed look, she did not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course," Agatha said, uncertainty peeking through with her high pitch. Nicky nodded into her shoulder and Agatha shifted. She managed to lift him into her arms as she made her way to the small bathroom at the top of the stairs. Rio followed almost dutifully, taking their son from Agatha's arms as she drew the bath. Nicky was tired. His hand rubbing at his eyes and Agatha felt panic set into her bones. This was how he was before he died.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She briefly glanced at Rio with worry etched into her bones, but the witch only shook her head. "He's fine," Rio whispered as she set him down. The bath didn't take long to run, Rio excusing herself to sort their food and part of Agatha hoped she hadn't poisoned it. Instead, she focussed on Nicky as he quickly stripped and climbed into the warm water.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm going to put Scratchy away for the night, ok?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gave her a nod and went back to playing with the bubbles. Moving, she lifted the rabbit and found the hutch at the back of Nicky's room. She tried to hide her smile, he was always caring for animals. She gave a light scratch to the rabbit's ear before popping him to bed. She set out Nicky's pj's and moved back downstairs. As she did, she found Rio setting bowls around the coffee table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s this?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I made tapas,” Rio waved at the small dishes. “Figured with the amount of candy we consumed outside, you wouldn’t be that hungry.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Agatha reminded herself. “You don’t eat.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged but looked down at the bowls. “You say that but something tells me I should.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head shot up at that. “Surely not.” Rio’s brow drew at her words. “Surely you can’t be mortal.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head.”I don’t think so. At least, not completely.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is this?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know.” Rio breathed. “But it’s terrifying.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s nerves grew cold. What scared Death? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama!” Agatha turned and climbed the stairs two at a time. Rio was hot on her heels. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky! Nicky? What happened?” Agatha rounded the door to find Nicky half dressed in his pj's, his head and arms stuck as he waved them around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A breathy laugh escaped her as she quickly moved, tugging the top down so his head poked out. “There,” Agatha smiled. “All fixed.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on,” Rio waved. “Dinners ready.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“With the film?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You might need to tell me how to work it,” Rio sighed as he led them both back to the living room. Nicky laughed like she was joking, only Agatha knew Rio had probably never worked a TV in her life. Not that Agatha was much better. After the radio she gave up on modern technology, it was all just noise. Although, she couldn’t fault the planes or the zeppelin. Really, she was blamed for the Hindenburg but she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. It took Rio staring at Nicky like he had three heads before he turned the TV on and put the DVD in the system. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Honestly, Agatha wasn’t sure what reality she was in where her son, born in 1750, her cosmicly ancient wife and herself who hadn’t ever kept up with technology except only where necessary were sitting down to watch a film. A film about a skeleton no less. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to pay attention to the screen but honestly, she just isn’t one for watching cartoons. Instead, she looks around to find Rio and Nicky both engrossed in the film. Nicky leaning into her side as she combs her fingers through her hair, his legs on top of Rio’s as they both watch. And Agatha hates how painfully domestic it is but something in her heart loves it. She loves every second of it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even if deep down she knows it’s not real, and that at any moment it could slip between her fingers like sand. Sand that ebbs and flows with the movement of time, just like it had once upon a time. In a different life, waking up with his body against hers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha takes a sharp breath as she pushes back the memory and when she looks up, she finds Rio’s dark eyes on hers. Guilt riddled in those brown irises. Silently, Rio reached behind the couch where Agatha’s hand lay and for the first time in over a century Rio’s fingers laced through her own. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes slipped shut at the tingling it sent through her body. How she missed the contact between them. Agatha let Rio’s fingers trace mindless patterns over the back of her hand, the softness of her hand met the rough of Rio’s fingertips, even when Agatha glanced at the taller witch, Rio’s eyes were trained forward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, the end credits rolled and Agatha shifted looking down to find Nicky fast asleep against her. Her heart clenched at the sight. Rio also gently lifted his legs from her own, slipping out from underneath him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.” Agatha immediately snapped and Rio’s jaw clenched. Agatha softened, Rio didn’t mean it. Agatha knew that but something inside her worried. “I mean, I’ll take him up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio only nodded once and stepped away, giving them space. Agatha managed to lift him, now all limbs and sinew as she collected him in her arms. She could remember when he was still a babe and she carried him everywhere against her chest. Climbing the stairs with him made her muscles scream but then she was in his room and the soft glow of his bedside light illuminated his relaxed face, soft snores falling from his lips. Peeling back the covers she slid him into bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” His eyes barely opened as she tucked the covers to his chin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m right here, Nicky,” Agatha could keep the tears from her voice. She brushed the hair from his eyes as he struggled to open them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mami?” Agatha’s brow drew close at the mention of Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right here, bud,” Rio’s voice was softer than she could ever remember and with two long strides she was kneeling in front of his bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky gave another sleepy nod as Agatha placed the stuffed rabbit in his arms, his eyes falling shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sleep tight, Nicky.” Agatha whispered as she lent and placed a kiss to his head. Her fingers tracing the same route they had years ago. Agatha didn’t know how long they sat their watching their son sleep but eventually Rio stood. Her fingers brushing Agatha’s wrist in a silent sumon to follow. Agatha refused. She wouldn’t be tricked into letting her take her son this time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice was soft and Agatha dared to take her eyes from him. “He’s not going anywhere.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried not to scoff in disbelief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on,” Rio called. “Let’s see if we can work out what this is.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like a glacier, Agatha slowly parted from her son promising to be just a moment away if he needed anything. Eventually though, Agatha knew she had to work out where the hell they were. So she made her way back to the living room and in true cursed agatha style, she had a notebook and post-its on the walls of the dining room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you had left Detective Vidal behind?” Agatha croaked as she stepped into the room. All of the boxes had vanished with the appearance in this new world but Rio had clearly lived enough to know the process. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was a special agent, actually.” Rio grinned. As she turned back, it fell from her face as she began scribbling notes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Agatha perched on the edge of the table. “Any further thoughts?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The annoying human across the street-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Herb?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Rio confirmed with a wave of the pen. “He was in your Westview. He seemed completely at ease here. Which means we aren’t in hell.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your realm perhaps?” Agatha volunteered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My realm wouldn’t be this happy,” Rio drawled as she moved around. “You still have no powers?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a flicker.” Agatha confirmed with a wiggle of her fingers. “You?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Rio muttered. “I can still sense things but the acts aren’t possible.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about the basics of your powers, as a green witch?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Rio asked as she turned slowly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just growing a plant?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha,” Rio sighed, yes it was demeaning but it would be a start. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Humour me, please?” Agatha said, offering the half dead cactus in the corner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio dropped the notepad and rolled her shoulders stepping up to the plant. Her fingers flexed, rolling and nothing. Not even a crackle. Rio growled. She had never been silenced. It was nearly impossible. Yet someone had done it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess that answers that,” Agatha huffed as she lifted the discarded notepad. Rio’s scribbles were barely manageable but Agatha had spent enough time with her wife to know what half of it meant. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let's rewind,” Agatha thought. “What kind of magic could warp anything for you? Chaos magic?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ancient magic, maybe?” Rio pondered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How ancient? Like cosmic magic?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s patience snapped. “I don’t know Agatha, no one’s been crazy enough to even try and trap me in a realm without my powers.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was pacing and Agatha hadn’t seen her this mad in quite a while. It stirred something in her. Something she was absolutely </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> thinking about. This was serious. There was absolutely no time to be thinking about letting Rio express her anger through sex. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio paused in her pacing as she thought, her eyes flickering back and forth as she thought. “Everything here is real.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As in I can feel it, smell it, hear it.” Rio explained more to herself. “It’s not an illusion like Eldritch magic.This is real.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Which means witchcraft?” Agatha probed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potentially.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s patience grew thin. “We don’t have time to talk in riddles. You are over six billion years old, surely you must have something rattling around in that brain of yours.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m trying, Agatha,” Rio sneered, stepping close. “But in case you weren’t paying attention, I don’t have all my powers.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, what? We’re just stuck in this alternate reality?” Agatha sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It would seem so,” Rio muttered in her morose way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sucked her teeth as she pondered next steps but Rio beat her to it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What if we played along to this life?” Rio suggested. Her dark eyes looking back at Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean raise Nicky?” Hope swelled in her chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not just Nicky,” Rio added. “Whatever this is has painted us as the all American dream. So let's play into that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you mad?” Agatha’s eyes were wide at the implication. It was one cruel thing to ask her to pretend the boy upstairs was her actual son, but it was another to play happy families with Rio as well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Think about it, Agatha,” Rio implored and God, Agatha hated how her body reacted to Rio saying her name. “We play into this role and we learn as much as we can about this scenario and this version of ourselves that's been created. Then we work out how to get the hell out of here."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You want to play happy families and just hope we manage to find a way out of this?" Agatha's disbelief had her reeling. There was no way she could put herself through that pain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just to see if there are any obvious defects in this illusion that we can find ourselves." Rio waved a hand around Agatha's living room and Agatha bit the inside of her cheek to keep from snapping.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Swallowing her attitude she asked a simple question. "I'm human. You are not. Not only that, we have never been an all American white picket fence couple- how the hell do you plan on convincing this town of sheep that we fall into that category?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's smile was a slow curling one as she stepped close to Agatha, her eyes falling to her lips and Agatha's darted to the plump ones in front of her. "It's simple, my love. We play the long game," Rio's finger curled under her chin, tilting Agatha's eyes upwards to the dark gaze that waited for her. "You've always been good at that."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's nostrils flared, her gaze diverting. Rio was right. It was only a matter of time before they worked it out and causing a scene was not the way to do it. She could work it out, mainly so this nightmare would end. Gritting her teeth, she pushed past the taller witch and made her way to the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Agatha?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stopped on the second step and turned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Where are you going?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's gaze narrowed at the witch. "To bed. If I'm going to play your doting wife then I'm going to need my beauty sleep."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glared but then stepped to the stairs. Agatha raised her palm stopping Rio on the first step.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And where do you think you're going?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"To bed," Rio smirked. "With my wife."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"One." Agatha began. "I'm not your wife. Two. You don't sleep."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That you know of," Rio countered. "And the ceremony in London in 1692 says otherwise."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio taunted her by even lifting her ring finger and there on it was a black band. Agatha's own anger spiked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You sleep down here."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha growled as she spun and stomped up the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How will Nicky take that?" Rio asked, hot on her heels. "He doesn't want us fighting."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He doesn't need to know that you were sleeping on the couch," Agatha threw over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Agatha," Rio spun her and Agatha's hand raised only to be caught by Rio's hands. "We need to play the game."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's rage simmered as she tugged away from the grip. "You're sleeping on the floor."</span>

  <p>
  <span>"Mama?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's eyes snapped open. Her ears caught the faint shuffling. She sat up as she heard the creak of floorboards in the hall. With a snap decision she tossed the throw pillow at the peaceful witch on the floor. A grunt sounded as the pillow made contact.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Rio, get up here."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You've changed your tune," Rio grumbled as she stood, her hands going to the hem of the sleep shirt she had found in a drawer the night before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not for that." Agatha hissed. "Nicky."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's brow drew close but the rattle of the doorknob had the taller witch moving quickly into the bed, ruffling the covers as if she had been there all night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama?" Nicky's hair was ruffled as he stepped into the room. One leg of his pants caught up his thigh as he stumbled towards the bed. "I had a bad dream."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha moved, turning on the lamp, her own eyes squinting at the brightness. "Come on," Agatha whispered, shifting to the edge. "I can lie with you till you fall back asleep."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wanna sleep with you and Mami." He rubbed his tired eyes as he lent his weight into her. Agatha looked over her shoulder at Rio who shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nicky," Agatha couldn't face lying together like that, like everything was normal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please Mama," those big brown eyes made her curse slightly as she felt all defences cave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Only for tonight."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky gave her that dimpled smile before Rio patted the bed with a heavy hand. Nicky happily climbed in, his stuffed rabbit cradled closely as he curled into Rio's arms. Agatha felt sick. Had he ever fallen asleep in Rio's arms? Agatha didn't get the chance to dwell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha climbed back into bed, wrapping her arms around her baby boy. He buried his face into her shoulder as he always had. Agatha lay there in the early hours of the morning, listening to every breath he took and never closed her eyes.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Much later, when Nicky had awoken and grumbled his entire way down the stairs in Agatha's arms while Rio lay peacefully in bed, Agatha looked around the home in more detail. It reflected how she had decorated during the Hex. All greys and swirls. She listened to Nicky babble about his dreams, always avoiding his nightmares.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His comment caught her off guard however. "Mama, do you have my lunch?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nicky you haven't finished your cereal," Agatha sighed as she curled her coffee cup to her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But I need my lunch for school." The silence that followed filled Agatha with panic as her eyes widened. The expectation as he blinked up at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right, he would go to school. He would disappear for hours at a time to learn. Unlike Wanda's hex this was more real. Children filled the neighbourhood, people appeared to have their normal lives. So what even was this suburban nightmare?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I will do it right now," Agatha smiled as she set the cup down. Right. Lunch. That couldn't be that hard right?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As it turned out it was a nightmare. First, she had the wrong ratio to peanut butter and jelly. And honestly, it was disgusting. What even was peanut butter?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then she had cut the shapes wrong, squares instead of triangles to which Nicky was convinced tasted completely different.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time it came to snacks, Agatha was ready to shove an apple in Nicky's mouth to just silence his small dictatorship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is everyone nearly ready?" Rio's impertinent voice grated her last nerve.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why don't you get Nicky ready for school?" Agatha threw over her shoulder with her glare.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rios' spine straightened but Nicky was already bouncing off, tugging Death after him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With Nicky's lunch largely complete, down to the irritating little juice box. She set it on the kitchen table before moving to the front door. There by the front door was a backpack with Nicky's name sharpie-d on the inside. With a drawn brow she opened the bag and ruffled inside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were a series of books with his scribbled handwriting and then further down a pencil case with a group of superheroes on. Of course wherever they were would have these annoying pests. She dropped it back into the bag. There wasn't much information beyond this. Nothing about their life or anything, so she turned heading back into the living room where she investigated further.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Beyond the photos were series of books that she recognised from her life before. Her first editions that she loved were placed on a bookshelf, Bronte, Dickens, Dumas, Alcott. Further up, clearly out of reach of grabbing hands there were other books that looked older. Older than even her. With a purse of her lips she reached, her fingers brushing across the spines as Latin, Greek and Chinese looked back at her. Interesting. These were not her books, so they had to be Rio's. She recalled a time when Rio would lie with her head in Agatha's lap, under a tree both reading. Agatha could still feel the peace it had brought her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mama?" Agatha turned as Nicky and Rio descended the stairs. Rio in a shirt and black pants similar to the look she had had as a faux FBI agent, her hair was down this time in loose ringlets around her shoulders. A suit jacket tossed over her arm and fuck- Agatha hated how her body reacted to the look. The power she exuded as she approached.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky distracted her thankfully as he bounced into her, his arms wrapping around her waist. "Mama the bus will be here soon."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right, Nicky had to go to school. Even in his black trousers and polo he looked so hopeful. "Of course, I'll walk you down-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky curled his nose. "Mami walks me to the bus."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's brows nearly hit her hairline as her heart rapidly thundered in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, as if sensing Agatha's panic, slipped a hand up her back. It took all of her urge not to slap the taller witch. "Maybe Mama could do it for a change?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky looked between them like they were crazy. "No."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stuttered because clearly Death was not used to being told no.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You take me to the bus on the way to work Mami, that's the rules."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's fine," Agatha swallowed her fears as her hands shook. "We don't want to upset the rules."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio frowned at Agatha but Agatha nodded, more trying to convince herself that everything would be fine. This reality, this world hadn't screwed her over just yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Here," Rio said as they watched Nicky collect his lunch and backpack. Agatha looked down to find a cellphone in her hand and she reluctantly took the device.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What am I supposed to do with this?" Agatha's lip curled as she squinted down at the screen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Keep me updated if anything happens," Rio chuckled. "It's like carrier pigeon, only a bit faster."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha glared but held the phone in her hand as Rio shrugged her jacket onto slim shoulders. "You'll be back?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course," Rio nodded quickly. "I apparently have a job to do according to Nicky and when I found these," Rio held up her own phone. "I figured it would be worth a shot to get more information out of a grown up."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. Irritatingly, it was a good idea. There was only so much their son would be able to tell them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Come on Mami," Nicky called from the front door and like gravity Agatha followed them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bye Mama," Nicky grinned and like she had done a thousand times before Agatha curled and kissed the crown of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Have a good day, baby."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll learn lots!" Nicky called halfway out the door. Agatha waved him off as Rio stepped to follow, keys in hand, and Agatha caught her arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You'll keep a sense on him," Agatha ordered, but Rio was already in agreement before she had finished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course I will." Rio smiled before turning but Nicky watched them with a curious tilt of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You didn't do it," Nicky said with a scrunch of his brow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do what?" Rio chuckled, twirling the keys on her finger. Honestly, if she crashed the car Agatha wouldn't be surprised.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Kiss Mama goodbye," Nicky said. "Like you do every morning."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nicky-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha cut Rio's protest off by spinning the witch and quickly kissing her. She had intended for it to be a peck, to be a point of show but then Rio's arm curled round her waist in instinct and her lips caught Agatha's. Their eyes fluttering shut as Agatha fell into the kiss, the feeling of those plump lips against her once more. She felt ready to give more, to receive whatever she could from Rio, like their hatred wasn't rooted in her bones. But then Rio was pulling away, her eyes wide as Agatha stared up at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Gross," Nicky's voice made them both turn with wide eyes. The heat of the kiss crept up Agatha's neck and she quickly shook it off with a clear of her throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Right, go, have a good day," Agatha waved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"See you at school at 4, Mama," Nicky called with a wave as Rio quickly shuffled out the door and jogged to catch up with Nicky, his hand in hers as they walked down the street. Agatha watched them round the corner and not five minutes later a yellow bus drove past, Nicky waving from the back. Something deep inside her told her it was fine, that he would be back. Thought her heart was playing catch up, her eyes filling with tears as she imagined a familiar horror of Rio leading him into a different plain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned away from the scene, that familiar nightmare springing to the forefront of her mind. He's fine, she tried to tell herself. He's real. Whether or not this reality she found herself in was real was a different matter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Rio was going to find information about their circumstance, then Agatha was going to find out too. Maybe this was another hex that either Billy or Wanda or some other Chaos witch had cooked up? If so, she could find the edge of it and work out if she was trapped here or not. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once dressed, she made her way out of her small suburban corner of the street and turned left, her eyes drawn to Herb’s house. It was no different than what it was when it was free of Wanda's spell. Maybe it wasn't Wanda, maybe it was Billy? Could Billy give her a happy ending like the one she had once dreamt of? No, she quickly shook the thought away. Billy couldn't see inside her mind. She had made sure of that a long time ago. When that pesky little psychic had seen her intentions to take her power and then ran off calling her a witch killer. She couldn't fault the truth, but she could have come up with a more inventive name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shoving her hands into the back pockets of her jeans as she walked, she took in the houses across the street. Halloween decorations were coming down as Thanksgiving went up. This town sure loved its holidays. She hated to see what the Christmas aisle barfed over number 2809’s house. She tried not to think about Nicky waking her up at the crack of dawn to open presents. Christmas hadn't been what it was now and she often felt angry she would never see it. Maybe, just maybe someone out there would give her that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stopped in her tracks. She would know that nasally squeak anywhere. Agatha turned slowly to her left half expecting a rotting zombie equivalent but no, instead in the most heinous floral patterned cardigan and brown slacks was Mrs Hart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes must have practically fallen out of her head because this woman was almost certainly dead. Billy couldn't bring people back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mrs Hart?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh just Sharon, dear,” the housewife waved off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha forced a smile onto her face, “Of course, I'm still getting used to the new names.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sharon's eyes narrowed for only a moment. “Of course, the first week of school is always a toughy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s faux smile faltered as she drawled, “Right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had to find out something from the neighbourhood busy body. “Listen, Sharon.” Geez did that feel disgusting in her mouth. “Did you happen to notice anything odd the last few weeks?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She kept the look of being aloof as she looked up and down the street. It was enough to have the older woman following her gaze. Her brow drawn before looking Agatha up and down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Mrs Hart said with an air of caution. “The kids were so excited for Halloween yesterday and Mrs McWilliams already has her decorations up for Thanksgiving this morning.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Already?” Agatha felt bile rise in her throat at the feigned act Wanda had once put on her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Mrs Hart laughed with a light wave. “But some people just love the holidays. How are you all celebrating?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh it's not something we’ve ever been very good at celebrating,” Agatha forced a smile. Honestly, she could remember when it had first appeared. Her mother forced them to sit and be thankful. It was disgusting and yes, it was hypocritical of her but really, the witches she had murdered hadn’t been deserving of that power. The natives had kept to themselves, there was really no need to incorporate the western traditions on them and commit genocide. Agatha shook her head most to herself. She really had to stop thinking like Lilia. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well maybe this year will be different,” Mrs Hart enthused in her unhelpfully giddy nature. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span> Agatha tried to quickly hide the curl of her lip but Mrs Hart’s eyes narrowed further. Her small spine straightened to look at Agatha fully. “Agatha dear,” Her voice took that nauseating tone of concern. “Are you sure you’re alright?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Agatha feigned a laugh. Her panic rose. “Why wouldn’t I be?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s just the last time I saw you acting like this you were pregnant with Nicky,” Mrs Hart’s arms folded as she visibly took in Agatha’s stomach. Agatha who’s hand flew to her lower stomach with widened eyes. Mrs Hart had seen her pregnant. That was not possible. Impossible. Mainly because Mrs Hart hadn’t even been a figment of genetics in 1750. Mrs Hart’s voice lowered. “You aren’t pregnant again, are you dear?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Absolutely not.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it wasn’t enough, Mrs Hart seemed to take it but her eyes dragged over Agatha again. Tightening her jacket, Agatha stood taller. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not,” Agatha clarified softer. “I’m just tired is all. Nicky’s having nightmares.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh poor dear,” Mrs Hart moved on, content with the answer. “Well I hope it settles. He’s such a sweet boy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure he’ll grow out of it,” Agatha’s nausea returned. He wouldn’t. He was dead. “Anyway, I should get going, leave you to your garden.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course dear, not going to campus this morning?” Mrs Hart asked as she lifted a potted plant. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mind reeled. “Um, no, not today.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mrs Hart took it and waved her off as Agatha slowly backed away down the drive. Her heart was thundering in her chest as she walked along the street. Her hand still rested on her midsection, she wasn’t pregnant. Agatha shook her head, absolutely not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Her strides down the street eventually led her to the town square. The grocery store was still there, with the chemist. The disgusting little white gazebo and lawn was there. Agatha distinctly remembered crashing through it and yet here it was. Still perfect in place. She crossed the street and took in the shop fronts. One after the other until she stopped. Her heart sank. It was not possible. She crossed quickly and peered in the window. There, standing, behind the counter was Lilia. Clothing hung from racks around them. She hummed to herself and Agatha slowly crept forward. Lilia was dead. They had watched her shut the doors of the Iron Maiden. She could still remember Jen’s screams. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The brush of her shoulder on a neon pink set of leggings had Lilia’s eyes snapping up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha,” Jen smirked. “What brings you to my little corner of town?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hadn't prepared a lie and it fell on her lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky put his knee through another pair of pants?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Agatha naturally defended before coming up with what might be the worst lie ever. “I just came in for a browse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia scoffed, both hands braved on the counter. “Please, you only come in here when you want something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I've changed,” Agatha shrugged with a purse of her lips. “People can do that, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“People,” Lilia smirked. “Not you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something panged deep in her chest but Agatha shook it away. “Anyway, how is business?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Lilia’s lips pursed as she took in Agatha. “Something’s different about you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widened in hope. “Oh really?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia nodded once. “Hmm, maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched her turn and then quickly Lilia looked sharply over her shoulder. “Nicholas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit her tongue as she stepped forward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia shook her head. Her hand reached to her temple. “No, I'm sorry. You know sometimes I get confused.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit her lip and nodded, stepping back. As she did the bell rang on the shop door to announce other patrons. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you aren't here to buy anything, Agatha, then excuse me. I need to help real customers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek to bite back the snark. She turned with a flourish of her jacket and stalked out into the cold of the late autumn sun. This was useless. How could Lilia be here? Surely this was some kind of hell? But Rio? Rio was real. Rio knew everything. Was she in Rio's realm? No, Rio didn't have her powers and no matter how cruel death was, she wouldn’t do something like this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stalked back to the house, her anger and frustration rising as she slammed the front door. How could it be this hard to work out? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There had to be something here. Shrugging out of her jacket she tossed it over the back of the couch. Looking around, she looked beyond the photos of her perfect family life, she opened every door and rifled through every closet before she finally opened what was Nicky's room in her possessed state. Now, there was an office. All dark wood and walls lined with books. Books on everything to do with Salem, witches and women's rights in the 16th and 17th century. Agatha walked slowly around the desk. A heavy manuscript sat beside the laptop. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The Ballad of the Witches Road by Dr A. Harkness </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes practically dropped out of her head as she sat in the desk chair, without thought she read the pages. The pages that depicted the history of the Ballad. Everything. Everything that didn’t make sense in this other reality she had found herself in. She read about the great Agnes O’Connor. How her son Nathaniel died, what happened to her wife, the mass murder. It depicted it in every excruciating detail Agatha had hidden away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking up she wondered what kind of spell could possibly do this? Chaos Magic? Perhaps but Wanda was as good as dead. The Darkhold gone. Green magic? No, only Rio possessed magic this strong but even then, it didn’t warp reality, it didn’t resurrect the dead. And most importantly, they had never lied to one another. Not once in their 400 year relationship. With a flourish, she lifted the black biro and got to work. She scribbled every question in margins. Her mind rattling off memories that she had vaulted away for nearly a century. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was startled from her questions as a chime went off in her pocket. The phone. With a curl of her lip, she fished it out and squinted at the screen. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Nicky. School. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Honestly, Rio needed lessons in texting etiquette. But then Agatha’s panic rose. Nicky was at school. Nicky needed to be collected from said school. Quickly, standing she ran, pulling her coat on and like a habit lifted the keys from the bowl. Once the front door was locked and she made her way to the drive she felt hot with anger. There on the drive was a blue SUV that had a booster seat in the backseat. Agatha tried to control the surge of disgust as she opened the car and slid into the driver's seat. Someone had a cruel sense of humour. Hell, she couldn’t remember the last time she had driven a real car. It took some fiddling and a lot of cursing. Afterall, she had learned on manual, not this self driving hybrid nonsense. What was so wrong with a good old fashioned gas stick car? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take long to drive to the elementary school, her muscle memory kicked in and she hated it. Wherever she was, her body remembered the movements to get to the right places. Pulling into the car park she was quick to get from the car, to see her son again. She needed to see him. To confirm this cruel place wasn’t a one trick pony. Walking into the courtyard as the bell rang and students filtered out, she stopped at the sight before her. There, as kids were embracing their parents and smiling up at them, was a familiar sight. It made her muscles coil, her body reacted as she made two long strides forward because there kneeling on the asphalt was Wanda Maximoff, her two twin boys and Nicky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her hand was on her son's shoulder and she had every intention of making the witch die for what she had done. For the threat she was posing to her son. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s bright smile made her stop in her tracks as blue eyes fell on Agatha. They creased with a polite smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fancy seeing you here Agatha.”  </span>

  <p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Fancy seeing you here, Agatha</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to hide the sneer as Nicky barrelled into her legs with a tight grip. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You'll never guess what we learned today, Mama!” Nicky bounced at her feet. Sweeping down in her protective nature, she lifted Nicky into her arms. He happily accepted as she smiled back at him. That feeling in her chest returned. The longing. The loss. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can't wait to hear all about it,” Agatha grinned down at him. She turned back to Wanda who had stood, a protective hand on each twin's shoulder. Agatha could play this one of two ways, she could call Wanda out, see if she remembered exactly what had happened. Alternatively, she could play along. ‘Play the role’ as Rio had called it. Agatha knew that the third option of just killing Wanda was unfortunately off the table. Especially with Nicky in her arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With Nicky on her hip, Agatha turned back to Wanda that sickening smile on her face. She added the voice to the act. “I wanted to make sure Nicky was keeping those two in line.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fake laugh filtered off easier than expected. Wanda's smile was tight but nodded. “Well, he certainly does that. I only asked since normally Nicky walks home with us. You know he's safe with us.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What a lie. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her son was anything but safe with the Scarlet Witch. A figment of imagination or not. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just missed him.” Agatha punctuated her point with an extra squeeze that left Nicky giggling. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda’s smile forced its way onto her face and Agatha watched her from the corner of her eye as the twins rattled off a plan. Something to do with a skateboard and ice cream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Wanda’s forced laughter had Agatha looking back at her. “We best be going. See you later, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha waved with Nicky waving after them before Agatha set him on the ground. His hand clasped tightly in hers as she walked them back to the car. Both deep in thought. Nicky clambered into the car all limbs, settling into the car seat and buckling himself in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” Nicky asked almost hesitantly as Agatha strapped herself in and turned the key. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mrs M was weird today.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mrs M, Maximoff. Agatha kept her voice light. “Oh? How so?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha managed to tilt the mirror to see the small draw of his brow. “She kept asking me weird questions.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What kind of weird questions?” Agatha pulled out of the car park as her grip tightened on the wheel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She asked me how I liked living here?” Nicky’s reveal was quiet and subdued. His brow drawn tight as his lips pursed. “But I've always lived here, Mama.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm sure she was just having an off day,” Agatha waved but inside panic rose. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A quick glance in the mirror revealed Nicky’s pout that only made Agatha wary. His brow scrunched in the way it did when he was troubled or worried. “It was weird.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hum was noncommittal. She would need to tell Rio. If the Scarlet Witch knew where she was, then Rio would need to know. She recalled a conversation once about different types of magic. Chaos was everything Rio was against. Rio was the natural order of things and Chaos was everything against that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” Nicky’s worried voice had her meeting his concerned filled brown gaze in the mirror once more. “Can we have storytime tonight? Like before?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s heart thundered hard in her chest. It had been close to three centuries since she had told Nicky of her adventures and she felt the tears well up as she nodded. “Sure, baby.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The drive back was silent the rest of the way, even when Nicky hopped out the car and Agatha collected his rucksack. She spared a cautious look around the street and found it empty of threat before she followed Nicky into the house, her hand brushing his shoulders protectively. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once the door shut them within the sanctuary of their home, Nicky visibly perked up. He dug through the papers of his bag and produced two dark purple jotters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Homework?” Agatha asked as she followed him into the dining room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Math and animals.” Nicky nodded as he pulled the papers out, spreading them on the table methodically. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you need help?” Agatha dared ask as she lifted the lunchbox out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a firm shake of his head and his words made Agatha’s spine tingle with rage. “Mami’s better at them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Biting back the anger she hid it from her son as she deposited his lunch on the counter. Fishing the phone from her pocket she sent Rio a message simply saying: </span>
  <em>
    <span>Development</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The witch would be curious enough to come home earlier if she was truly in the dark. Making coffee, she was about to sit on the couch when the door opened to reveal her wife. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You're home?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You said there was a development,” Rio answered with a shut of the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mami!” Nicky ran from the dining room into Rio's arms. Rio, like it was nothing, scooped him up with a laugh and held him close. Agatha could see it, the tight grip of her hand on his back. The way dark eyes fluttered shut as she held him close. She missed their son. The son she had barely spent time with, but had watched grow from afar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you have a good day, </span>
  <em>
    <span>mi vida</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky and Rio's smile was almost identical and it made the grip on her cup tighten. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Si, </span>
  </em>
  <span>we have homework,” Nicky pointed to the dining room and like they had done every night, Rio's face turned serious as she nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then lead the way. We can't let standards slip.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried not to show her confusion but Rio had never done homework with Nicky ever. Let alone like they had every night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mrs Jones said that I was in the top 3%,” Nicky boasted. His chest puffing out in pride. Pride that Agatha felt herself brimming with. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That's amazing, bud,” Rio grinned down at him as she set him down and he tugged her into the dining room. Agatha couldn't help but listen as they spoke away in Spanish to one another. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But school was really ok?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, Mama was there for me coming out too,” Nicky said without care. “I like it when she gets me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama needs to work too, Nicky,” Rio reminded him, but Agatha brow drew tight, her anger spiking. How could Rio possibly know that? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, I just wish she didn’t have to sometimes, then she’d always be there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She is always there,” Rio reassured and Agatha felt the anger wash away as her emotion grew thick in her throat. “Sometimes she just gets wrapped up in what she’s doing. Just like you do.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky let out a giggle and Agatha was sure Rio must have lightly tickled him as he squealed again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” Rio directed. “Let's do the two times tables.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha left them to it, returning to the office where she began deciphering her facts of the day, hiding from the fresh reality she was in. Rio loved their son. She had taught him Spanish, just like she had with Agatha once upon a time. She wanted to hear about Nicky's day and she knew things that didn't make sense. Was this Rio's cruel torture? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A knock on the door made her look up to find Rio leaning on the door jamb, her dark eyes watching Agatha under intense scrutiny. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Penny for your thoughts?” Rio eventually asked as her eyes roamed over Agatha’s office. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no point in lying to the older witch. Afterall, if this was Rio she would only be playing along. “I'm making a list.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And checking it twice?” The smirk was firmly in place as she pushed off the frame and made her way closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of all the differences that we've noticed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's smirk died but she still propped herself against the edge of the desk, her brow arching as she looked at the notepad. Before launching into the list, Agatha met dark eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where's Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Upstairs, playing with Mr Scratchy,” Rio nodded above them. “I came in here to ask you if you wanted dinner?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since when did you become such a homemaker?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Call it intuition,” Rio's eyes flashed dangerously before they fell back to the notepad. “I saw something at work today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A grave marker for William Kaplan,” Rio's seriousness sent shivers down her spine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please tell me your job isn't a coroner?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Worse,” Rio snorted. “We own a Green Cemetery.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A what?” Agatha’s lip curled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, rather than just put the body in the ground they plant a tree in the person's memory.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Isn't that fitting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bit on the nose,” Rio grumbled. “But anyway, what did you find?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed thickly, there was no going back now. “The Scarlet Witch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's eyes widened as her anger rolled off her in waves. “That's not possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Agatha’s lips pursed. “I also found the twins, Lilia and Mrs Hart, our dearest next door neighbour.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha slowly climbed to her feet, putting her nose to nose with Rio. “So, if this is some hellscape you've designed for me, my love,” Agatha brushed some non-existent lint from Rio's tense shoulders. “I've figured it out. Checkmate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's nostrils visibly flared and for a split second Agatha thought she had won. That she'd caught Death herself in her lie. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then Rio's smirk drew into a grin and then into a laugh. “This isn't some long con, Agatha.” Rio eventually laughed. “There's no trick that I'm playing with you”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then how do you know those things with Nicky?” Agatha snapped, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What things?” Rio’s confusion was honest and Agatha hated it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That I work, that- that you do homework with Nicky, that you walk him to the bus in the morning.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I don’t sleep like you,” Rio reminded. “When you two were fast asleep I was down here trying to find clues. Clues you’ve obviously also found.” Rio said as she gestured around the room, her eyes flashing dangerously. It made Agatha recoil. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This isn't some game, Rio.” Agatha growled, her patience at the end of her tether. “I can't lose him again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut. Not to hold back the tears and grief that threatened to spill, but to hide from the pitying look she knew would be on Rio's face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” it was a breath of a whisper on the wind and it made Agatha open her eyes to look down at Rio. The witch hadn't moved from her seat on her desk and she looked worried, her brow dipped, her lips turned down as her dark gaze flittered back and forth in thought. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was like gravity, the way Rio grounded her from her pain. Once the constant source and her only solace from it, the only thing that Agatha knew was real in this place. Reaching, she stepped into Rio's space, her hand brushing the dark fabric of her thigh. Dark eyes snapped up to ocean blue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need you to be honest with me,” Agatha breathed, her fingertips dancing up a strong thigh, over toned arms and up shoulders that angled up to her. Agatha tried to ignore the way her body reacted as fingers brushed over the sides of her own thighs. Those rough hands falling to her hips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have never lied to you, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her head drop, her forehead brushing Rio’s as her eyes fluttered shut. She could feel the air between them shift. She hated it. Hated her. But Agatha needed her. She needed Rio to get out of this hell hole to work out how to put this suffering at an end. She couldn’t continue to see her son’s happy face forever, knowing he was long gone and wouldn’t come back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unless. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I dead?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes opened to find a dark soft gaze back at her. Rio’s jaw clenched as she looked up at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, is this the other side?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed as her head dipped. “No.” The older witch breathed. “It would be easier if it was.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easier?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d have my powers, I’d give us a better life,” Rio admitted. “But you didn’t want to see my face. That was what you asked of me, Agatha.” Rio’s dark gaze snapped up to her own. “That was what we agreed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped back, visibly shocked that Rio recalled their discussion so vividly. It felt like a gut punch, a smack in the face at how easily she had agreed to never see this witch again. Agatha reeled, she had always known Rio. For most of her life she had known every little detail about the witch and now? Now, it was no different. The pain etched on her wife’s face was almost too much to bear. “So what, I kissed you, tried to take your power and-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh I watched you die,” Rio nodded with a purse on her lips. “I made you a nice grave. Lots of azalea’s just how you like.” Agatha curled her lip. “I went to find your soul and well, ended up here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a flourish of her wrist, Rio hopped off the desk and turned to face Agatha fully. “Now I don’t know where we are. I have limited power, you have none. Our son who was at peace in the afterlife is here as is apparently every other person that we thought was dead.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But some are,” Agatha countered, folding her arms. “William Kaplan is dead.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A human,” Rio paced as she spoke, her fingers working as quickly as her thoughts. “Not a witch.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mrs Hart?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dead by Billy Maximoff’s hand,” Rio spun. “Or the road, depending on your preference.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lilia, also sacrificed herself while on the road,” Agatha muttered as she thought. “But Nicky?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky is the irregularity,” Rio pondered. “But then, so are you,” Rio pointed at her as dark eyes fixed on Agatha. “Maybe Death isn’t the pattern here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what?” Agatha prodded. “We aren’t all witches.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Rio hummed. “But you, you are the common denominator so far.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think I did this?” Agatha practically cackled in disbelief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed as she paced back and forth across the room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s walls flew up faster and higher than ever before around Rio. “Please, we both know I don't care enough about those has-been’s to bring them back from the dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stopped in her pacing. “No, you don't.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm guessing you haven't came across anything like this before?” Agatha’s probing was obvious but it wasn't beneath her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned, her eyes dragging over Agatha before she shook her head. “The Scarlet Witch came close with her little slice of heaven but no. Nothing of this scale and certainly not bringing back souls from the other side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha could see the agitation in her eyes, the only thing hiding the rage that simmered beneath the surface. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It goes against the natural order of things.” Agatha pointed out as Rio rolled her shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It makes me uneasy.” Rio's long strides continued around the room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It makes you angry.” Agatha had known Rio long enough to know what made the older witch tick. She had seen her anger underneath the surface at being unable to take Billy. Her anger at Agatha’s mother. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the divine mother, she hoped that the old bat had stayed dead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's finger twitched impatiently and Agatha decided to poke that wound a little harder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And without your full power,” Agatha let out a low whistle. “Have you ever felt it before?” Agatha whispered. “Being stunted?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio spun with a sharp glare. Her voice lowered to a dangerous tone. “Don't push me, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio took a breath. Raising her chin as her eyes matched Agatha’s. “It’s like it’s there, I just can’t reach it. I can feel the souls around me, the ones that I know are coming to an end, the ones that are just starting but then it’s like I can’t reach for them, to take them.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt the bile rise in her throat as her thoughts flew to Nicky. Had Rio stolen him from his sleep like she had always pictured? She turned away and made her way across the office, putting any and all the space she could between them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So we still play this ridiculous game?” Agatha’s lip curled as she moved the conversation away from Nicky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We've already uncovered a lot. Most without even looking for it.” Rio's hands slid into the pockets of her slacks. The lithe muscles of her forearms flexing as she did. “We’ll uncover more if we lean into the all American dream.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sound… confident.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm just looking at the evidence presented,” Rio shrugged. She turned however, making her way from the office in a dramatic turn Agatha was almost envious of. “I'm going to make food.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dinner was chaotic. Rio and Nicky argued over which flavour of deep fried potato was better in rapid Spanish, while Agatha poured herself her second glass of wine. Listening to the bickering was giving her a headache and honestly she could only take so much of their infectious energy. It was everything she had wanted once. But now, all she saw was the pain she felt when they were both gone and Agatha was alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She picked at the carrots on her plate before sipping the wine. Nicky was shovelling food into his mouth like he had never been fed, Agatha wrinkled her nose when he grinned at her and all she could do was strain a smile. Honestly, her son had never been this excited in his actual time. Never been this happy. Pain radiated through her chest like a hot poker and Agatha surged to her feet, lifting her plate and moving to the kitchen as tears welled in her eyes. Had she done this to him? Suffocated his happiness because of her own gain? Dropping the plate in the sink she forced her eyes shut to stem the tears that threatened to fall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don't want to hear your pitiful shit right now, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words were harsh but Agatha needed to have any kind, even just an ounce, of defence from the witch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn't hear a response, instead she felt the soft pressure of her hand on the centre of her back. Rooting her. Sliding up and into the hair at the base of her neck. Relaxing her. Slipping past her thorns with expert hands. Her response was automatic. Her body betrayed her mind, as she relaxed back into the touch. Slowly, Agatha turned, Rio's eyes soft and filled with understanding. It made Agatha’s walls crumble as she lent into the touch that stroked along her neck, over her clavicle before resting on her sternum.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You feel so much,” Rio whispered and Agatha's knees caved, she embraced the touch, slipping her arms around Rio's shoulders as she buried her face into the taller woman's neck. Tears unleashed against cool skin. Strong arms held her tightly. Her body being the support she needed to stay upright. Agatha’s tears cascaded down her cheeks as the waves of pain hit her rolling one after another. Waves she had kept at bay for centuries. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” Agatha pulled away. Her walls firing back up as she swiped at her eyes. It was too late. Agatha had matched those deep concerned eyes standing in the doorway of the kitchen. “What's wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing,” Agatha’s lies were awful. His deep concern for her set rot into her chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama just had a bad day,” as usual Rio didn't lie, she only twisted the truth. She lowered herself to Nicky's height but to Agatha’s surprise rough fingers laced through her own. “Just like we all do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s brow scrunched in the adorable way it always did when he faced a problem. “How do we make it better?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The matching gaze to Rio’s made the older witch stutter for a moment but it had Agatha dropping to their height and opening her arms to her son. Magnetically, Nicky stepped into her arms and wrapped his body around hers. Agatha automatically closed her eyes to revel in the feeling of her son in her arms. The feeling of his soft form against her own had the muscle memory kicking in. And even though it was centuries since she had done this, she still pulled away with a light dig of her fingertips into his ribs. It earned her a giggle and bright eyes looking up at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That,” Agatha answered. “That always makes it better.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s bright smile had her matching it with enthusiasm Agatha didn’t even know she had. Before she knew it, Nicky tackled her in another tight hug. It hit her with such a force it had her falling back into the tiled floor. She held him tight as he burrowed his face into her neck just as he had always done. With a light laugh, she felt her eyes draw to Rio who stood. A look of longing in those dark eyes that had Agatha’s chest tightening, but then Rio stepped away. She was letting Agatha have her moment with her son. The moment Agatha had put off since waking up here forty eight hours ago. So Agatha took it with both hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She held Nicky like her life depended on it. She carried him, despite being a lanky seven year old, she propped him on her hip and settled onto the couch with him as he pushed a book into her hands and she took the hint as she read aloud to him, his head propped on her shoulder, the soft glow of the lamp the only light in the den as she read. Agatha didn’t know how long she sat there reading about Greek Mythology to Nicky but at some point she must have drifted off. The familiar yet distant weight of her son lulling her into a familiar sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the shifting that had her eyes snapping open. Rio stood above her, her dark eyes soft and melancholy. “It’s late.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky?” Agatha stiffened, the familiar pain pulling at her chest as her arm wrapped around the boy beside her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s only asleep, my love.” Rio whispered, her eyes flickering to Nicky who was fast asleep beside her. “I’m going to lift him so you can get that crick that I know you will have in your neck out.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave a bleary nod as she shook the sleep from her body. As she did, Rio stepped close, lifting Nicky into her arms with a familiar strength she knew Rio had always possessed, powers or not. As Rio said, as soon as Agatha moved pain radiated up her neck and she found herself rubbing away the ache. Agatha moved behind Rio, a habit that felt all too natural, one that had set into her bones over time. Turning lights off, locking doors and as soon as she climbed the stairs after Rio, she found her tucking Nicky into bed. His mouth half open, as he drooled over the taller woman's shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was all so painfully domestic and Agatha was transported to a time when she had fantasised about this scene in particular. Rio tucking Nicky into bed as Agatha placed his plushie into the bed beside him while turning on the night light she knew he’d need. Agatha watched as Rio soothed the dishevelled locks on his short hair before turning to the door and then Agatha felt alone with her son. Leaning down, she placed a kiss to his forehead that earned her a tired grumble. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We fell asleep,” Agatha whispered as she ran her fingers through his soft locks. “Mami put you to bed.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Story?” He murmured sleepily and Agatha stifled her laugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enough stories for one night, Nicky.” Agatha gently scolded. He accepted it as he always had, his eyes closing on him. She didn’t know what overcame her as she hummed the familiar tune to the Ballad. It settled him, his eyes drifting shut once more and when Agatha was sure he was asleep, she stood, pulling the door over, and made her way to her room. Like she had a thousand nights before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She found Rio in green flannel, thumbing through the closet, her head tilted curiously. “Do you have memories?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” Agatha felt the exhaustion of the day creep into her bones. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you have memories of this life we have, Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha really wanted to sleep, her eyes felt heavy in her head. “Of course I don’t.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She changed into her slip without thought and when she climbed into the bed, Rio’s head tilted curiously at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s lips pursed but she shook her head. “Nothing.” Rio moved and settled on the blanket on the floor and pulled the covers to her chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt a chill pull up her spine. “Rio?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha cleared her throat as she shifted. Suddenly uncomfortable with offering Rio even an inch. “Do you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do I what?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have memories?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a heavy silence. “Go to sleep, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It made Agatha shift, settling into the comfort of the pillows and she heard Rio shift on the floor. Turning this way and that. “You’re making too much noise.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gave a dark chuckle. “Are you concerned I’m making too much noise or trying to find an excuse to invite me to bed?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want </span>
  <em>
    <span>that.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Rio taunted. “Cause we’ve never crossed that line before.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to keep sleeping on the hard wood floor or not?” Agatha snapped as she sat up looking down at the pale woman with her eyes closed on the floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes opened. “Well, since you offered so nicely.” Rio climbed to her feet and stepped over to the bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached over, stopping her from pulling back the sheets with a pointed glare. “Keep your hands to yourself.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s grin was feral. “Please, we all know that you are always in control, my love.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s teeth ground to dust. Rather than encourage Rio she turned, pulling the covers to her chin and turning her back to her ex wife. The mattress dipped as Rio settled beside her and with a click of the lamp the room plunged into darkness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You never answered my question,” Agatha pointed out as her eyes grew heavy. “About the memories.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s breathing was steady and for a moment Agatha was sure she was asleep. The silence spread between them until Rio whispered, </span>
  <span>“Yes, Ags. I have memories.” </span>

  <p>
  <span>When Agatha woke, she expected to be alone again. She had hoped. She thought she might have time to collect her thoughts, but instead she woke to a familiar weight she hadn’t felt since before Nicky. When she lived in a little cabin with the one person who knew every single part of her. Only now, she was in a house, not a cabin. With her son and her wife. Her wife who she didn’t want anywhere near her. Her wife who was currently curled around her with her arm draped around her waist and her nose tucked to the back of her neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha immediately stiffened at the gentle puffs of breath against her neck. The flood of their conversation from the night before hit her like a tidal wave. Rio had memories. She had memories of this life. A life Agatha had never been in before. Shifting, Agatha spared a glance over her shoulder to Rio’s sleeping form. Rio, who Agatha had known, only ever to rest for a few hours. Now she was sleeping and sleeping deep enough for Agatha to slip from her embrace and make her way quietly downstairs. She went about her routine, making tea as she always had, found her notepad and began jotting down more information that she had learned from the previous day. </span>
</p><ul>
<li><span>She had died. She remembered that correctly. </span></li>
<li><span>Rio had come to convince her to go over to the other side and they had ended up here. </span></li>
<li><span>Here which was still Westview, not their original home. </span></li>
<li><span>Rio could sense souls but not interact with them.</span></li>
<li><span>She couldn’t sprout flowers like normal or have any witch powers that either of them should have. </span></li>
</ul><p>
  <span>Agatha made a note to follow up on that. If she didn’t have powers, and Rio didn’t have powers, were there any forms of magick in this place? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha continued her list. </span>
</p><ul>
<li><span>People were alive that were supposed to be dead. Wanda, Lilia, Nicky. </span></li>
<li><span>Nicky wasn’t a figment of her imagination. He was real. As real as Agatha herself could be considering she too was meant to be dead. </span></li>
<li><span>Rio had memories of a life that Agatha couldn’t remember. </span></li>
</ul><p>
  <span>What was powerful enough to screw with Death? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A small voice in the back of her head reminded her that Agatha herself had screwed Rio many, many times. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, trying to focus on her task. Now was not the time to be thinking about Rio like that. She had to work out where the hell she was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that Agatha got the chance. Five minutes later, Nicky appeared, bleary eyed and reaching for her. He curled into her chest and Agatha relished the feeling of him needing her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Had another bad dream, Mama.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smoothed down his bed ridden hair. “Do you want to tell me about it?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were hurting someone,” Nicky whispered into her shoulder. “But it wasn’t you. It was like you were a zombie from that scary film.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s brow knitted together as she gently rocked him. “Well, I can assure you, I’m no zombie.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky didn’t respond, only curled closer. Naturall, Agatha held him tighter. “I’m right here, Nicky,” Agatha breathed, rubbing soothing circles on the back of his hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky held tighter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was how Rio found them, twenty minutes later, curled around one another. Nicky sipping his orange juice, Agatha holding him with her tea curled against her chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s wrong?” Rio asked in lieu of a greeting. Her brow drew tight as her muscles tensed. Agatha hid her smile in Nicky’s hair as she recognised the familiar protectiveness of Rio slip through. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky had a bad dream again,” Agatha explained, it resulted in Rio immediately coming close, crouching to meet Nicky’s eyes. Her protectiveness disappeared and suddenly worry etched across Lady Death's face. It wasn’t an emotion Agatha saw very often from Rio Vidal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You need me to beat up any bad guys?” Rio asked quietly, a knowing smirk playing on her lips. Nicky shook his head into Agatha’s shoulder and Agatha smirked almost victoriously. Rio pondered playfully for a moment before asking. “Did Mama beat up the bad guys?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky tensed and Agatha resisted the urge to kick Rio. He buried his face into her neck once more, fresh sniffles falling from him. Setting her mug down, Agatha held him tightly, gently shoving Rio as she did. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio mouthed wide eyed but Agatha only rolled her own eyes as she held her son. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go make yourself useful and make breakfast,” Agatha suggested, trying to hide the bite in her words. Rio, to Agatha’s relief, took the hint and stood, turning and walking deep into the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took another twenty minutes for Nicky to lift his head from Agatha’s shoulder and wipe his eyes with the corner of his pyjama top. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, baby?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think you could take me to school this morning?” Nicky asked, his eyes downcast with his lower lip jutting out in an expert pout. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Agatha automatically agreed. Why wouldn’t she? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need to go into work?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha grit her teeth. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck this make believe world. </span>
  </em>
  <span>“No, I’m sure I’ll get away with another day at home.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Careful,” Rio called as she emerged from the kitchen with fruit and granola for the adults, and Fruit Loops for Nicky. “They might think you’re going to be a homemaker instead of a History professor.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha blinked for a moment and she watched as Rio’s brow drew close but it was barely there before it was gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, would that be so bad?” Agatha taunted, pushing her walls up as high as they could go. Rio only chuckled at the notion before sitting opposite them. Agatha shifted Nicky so he was at the head of the table, nestled between them. Breakfast was a quiet affair from then on in. It didn't take much for Agatha to keep an eye on his quiet demeanour. Whatever his nightmare, it had been worse than the night before. She waited for him to excuse himself, rushing off to get dressed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you need a hand?” Rio called after him, only to be met with a shake of his head before he took off upstairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He never used to have nightmares,” Agatha muttered only loud enough for Rio to hear as she turned back to her. “When it was just us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's brow knitted as she pulled the notepad over. “What if his nightmares are linked to all this?” she asked, pointing to Agatha’s bullet points.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pondered her words, thinking of the last time it was like this. “When Wanda had the hex, she kept the children asleep in their beds until she needed them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could his nightmares be linked to whatever this world is?” Rio asked but Agatha wasn't sure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your memories,” Agatha pointed to Rio. “What do you think from your memories of here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn't work that way,” Rio's frown was infuriating. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then how does it work?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I remember things when I'm not thinking about it, like its habit,” Rio explained as she stood. Collecting the bowls she moved to the kitchen with Agatha trailing after her. “Like when I was looking at the photo on the wall of you pregnant I remembered watching the ultrasound and crying.” Rio huffed as she placed the bowls in the sink. “But I can also remember lying in our home and feeling him kick in your belly when lying in our bed back in 1750.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha could feel the frustration rolling off strong shoulders. She could feel the habit that Rio spoke off but she had yet to pick apart any firm memories she didn’t have. She thought of Billy trying to read her mind. To craft a makeshift trial for her. Was this what this was? Could it be Chaos Magic but dialled to a 1000? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened her mouth to prod further, but then she saw it. She really saw it. The pain etched on Rio’s face. The same pain Agatha knew had simmered under the surface since Nicky was born. Rio had kept a distance. Had kept far away where she could. She hadn’t been able to see their son the way Agatha did. Stepping forward, Agatha lifted her palm and with a moment of hesitation she thought of the night before. Of Rio holding her in this very room as she let grief wash over her for the first time in centuries. Had Rio felt that? Stepping closer, she let her hand make contact with the soft fabric of Rio’s shirt she’d slept in. The wrinkles danced under Agatha’s palm but underneath she could feel the warmth that Rio often expressed when she was trying to be human, trying to embrace that side of her. Agatha watched dark eyes fall closed as her head dropped. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This place is going to kill us Agatha,” Rio whispered as Agatha stepped impossibly closer. She slid her hands around the narrow waist of the taller woman and with a decision to give into the temptation of the woman she loved for the first time in centuries, Agatha lay her head on the blade of Rio’s shoulder. Felt the rise and fall of her breathing. The gentle thump of her heart beneath her ear. Calloused hands slid over the backs of Agatha’s as they held one another. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s calling made Agatha part from the moment she had impulsively fallen into. Rio stiffened beside her and turned to look down at Agatha. Dark eyes searched for any understanding of what the hell they were doing. But Agatha already had a number of questions that needed answers. A whole host of questions that she wasn’t sure made any sense to anyone but her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clearing her throat, she looked away from those piercing eyes. “I should get ready to take him to school.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her excuse gave her the exit she needed. She passed Nicky on the stairs with a quick kiss to the crown of his head and a promise she’d be quick. She took the stairs two at a time to escape the reality that she was happily falling into beneath her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once showered and dressed, Agatha returned to the foot of the stairs to find Nicky waiting, his backpack at his feet. His knees tucked to his chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mami had to go to work,” Nicky voiced as he refused to look up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s alright,” Agatha waved off. Hopefully it meant she would get away without another impromptu kiss that her body definitely missed. “I’m sure she’ll be home sharp.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She didn’t say bye to you,” Nicky pointed out, his dark eyes looking up at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s important Mama,” Nicky protested, surging to his feet, forcing Agatha onto the back foot. “Mickey Stevens' parents stopped saying bye and kissing and doing things together and - and they argued all the time and now they're divorced.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, hey,” Agatha knelt in front of him, her hands grasping his small shoulders. “Look at me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Familiar dark eyes met her own and all Agatha saw was worry. So much worry for such a small person. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Mami and I aren’t getting a divorce,” Agatha’s words felt like syrup in her mouth but she had never lied to Nicky and she sure as hell wasn’t going to start. “Everything's just been a little crazy lately but-” Agatha paused, she shouldn’t. She should keep this secret to herself. But no. She wouldn’t lie to him. “But we love each other. Deep, deep down, we do.” Agatha cleared her throat. “But most importantly, we love you so, so much. Which means you have nothing to worry about.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah,” Agatha cut off. She pushed his stray hair from his eyes. “I want you to promise me, Nicky.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s brow drew tight, his lips turned down in frustration. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Promise me you won’t worry about your Mami and I. Nothing is going to change for you, I swear.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky seemed to accept it, stepping into her space as Agatha embraced him tightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” Agatha cleared the emotion from her throat as she pulled back. “We better get you to school before we’re late.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It earned her that expert dimpled grin she knew she would cave to for anything. “Mrs Crow always gets upset when anyone is late.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand froze over the bowl which held the keys. “Mrs Crow?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Nicky shrugged his backpack onto his shoulders. “Remember she took over from Mrs Vulpes last term.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,”  Agatha smiled, strained against her face as her Latin caught up. Her son's elementary teacher was one of the seven. Agatha only had one thought as she ushered Nicky out the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck this hell hole.</span>
  </em>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Dropping Nicky off was harder than Agatha cared to admit but the drop off zone appeared to be more of a war zone than the actual saying goodbye to her son for the day. First of all, Dottie cut her off on the way into the parking zone, which she’d forgive if she hadn’t sent her that obnoxious smirk at the same time. If Nicky wasn’t in the car Agatha might have just ran her off the road. Secondly, the parking warden was far too much of a busy body as she guided Agatha to park like it was a plane for god sake. It was barely a minivan. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have a good day,” Agatha called and Nicky nodded as he unclipped his belt. “And if you need anything you let them know. I’ll come right over.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, Mama,” Nicky grinned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And don’t forget your lunch!” Nicky laughed with a wave as he hopped out, his rucksack and lunch bag in hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bye Mama!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And like that Nicky was gone into the sea of other small humans for the day. Her heart lurched at the thought but Lilia had no recollection of their previous life, Wanda hadn't murdered her on the spot so there was hope.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With her newfound freedom, Agatha used the time to explore this new Westview further. She walked around the town square, into the old department store, the grocery store and it was underwhelming. It was exactly the same. The same soccer moms laughing at the cafe on the corner. The same elderly women dithering along the sidewalk. She half expected Mrs Hart and Lilia to be arm and arm but she imagined Lilia was still selling overpriced leggings and Sharon pruning her Azaleas. By the time Agatha was done, she was back at the house and no further forward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, she distracted herself. Rio had told her to play into the role so how bad could it be? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The answer?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Awful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once opening the computer, which lets face it, she hadn't looked at since 1970 when they were all the rage for five minutes and like cars stuck around like that annoying freckle on her ass. It took her some fumbling but after twenty minutes she was going through the manuscript and underscoring sections. Deleting others and simply rewriting while sections. She grew lost in the monotony of writing about witches during Prohibition. The memory of her smuggling homemade wine into the cottage filled her mind. She smirked at the memory of Rio's laugh at the sight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before she knew it, she had grown lost in the day. A small reminder in the corner of her screen notified her to collect Nicky and she dutifully followed the instruction like it was normal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pulling into the car park she found Nicky stood waiting, a small scowl on his face. Panic rose in Agatha's chest. She was only a minute late thanks to those asshole roadworkers. Climbing from the car, she tentatively approached him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘How was school?” She smiled in leu of a greeting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to go home,” Nicky's eyes didn't rise to meet her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's jaw worked for a second before she nodded, guiding him back to the car with a brush of her hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The car ride home was silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took until Agatha finished putting away her things and mindlessly tidying before she came and sat opposite her son. She watched his pencil scratch across the paper. His brow was still drawn tight across his small face. She kept silent, waiting for him to open. It took a long moment before Nicky set the pencil down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” His pout was in full effect. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked up at her, nibbling his lower lip as his brow was drawn tight. “Do you lie?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat back with a heavy thud on the wooden chair. Her eyes wide. “Nicky-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you- do you lie to me?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached for him, halting just short of his tense hand. “Why would you ask that?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky only looked up at her, his dark eyes wide and expecting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a sharp breath. “I’ve never lied to you, Nicky.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His lower lip trembled at that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would you ask something like that?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A soft hiccup escaped him as he swatted at thick tears welling in his eyes. “Tommy said his mom and dad love each other a lot.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s brow drew tight. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fucking Wanda.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s why him and Billy are getting a little sister.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s brow was practically in her hairline, flashes of the first time Wanda was pregnant going through her mind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gave a little shrug of his shoulder as his hands fidgeted. “I just thought if you and Mami loved each other then that’d happen but it hasn’t and-”  Nicky’s breathing caught and began to increase sharply. “-and then Tommy and Billy said it was normal for grown ups to lie but I said you wouldn’t. He called me stupid.” Tears fell in thick streaks now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That little-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But, but then I started thinking about it and you said you and Mami loved each other but you’s have been so weird and then I realised that maybe Mickey was right. What- what if you don’t love each other and that’s why I’m alone and your being weird and and and-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Agatha stood sharply, quickly moving around the table to kneel in front of her son. “Okay,” Agatha spoke softer, turning Nicky’s chair to put them eye to eye. “I have not lied to you Nicky.” The words were thick in Agatha’s throat as she spoke. “I do love your mother. I’ve loved her for a long, long, long time. But babies- they don’t magically happen for some people.” Agatha thought of that particular night, the memories punching hard in her chest. “But that doesn’t mean we don’t love each other, love you, with everything we have.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But Tommy-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy Maximoff doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” Agatha snapped harshly. Nicky looked down at his hands cupped in his lap. “Nicholas Scratch you look at me.” Dark eyes met her own. “I’ve never lied to you. I will never lie to you. Do you hear me?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s eyes were wide as he looked back at her. “Yes, Mama.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Agatha relaxed marginally. “Now, I don’t know about you but I think we deserve pizza after the day you seem to have had. What do you think?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Relief washed over Agatha as a toothy grin flashed up at her. Without thought, she pulled him into her arms and she could feel the cool touch of his nose against her neck. She didn’t know how long they sat on the floor but soon her legs cramped. Standing with Nicky in her arms, she pulled out the phone and fumbled until Nicky laughed, taking the phone from her and doing it. She felt heat creep up her cheeks at the relief that her allergy to technology was normal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as it was placed, they climbed the stairs and descended not a few moments later in sweats and hoodies. Agatha collected every blanket she could find and bundled them both onto the couch, Nicky tucked into her as he dictated what to watch. The sound of a car pulling up had Agatha standing. Two steps from the porch, Rio stepped in. Pizza box in hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I intercepted Dennis on the drive,” Rio chuckled as she shut the door behind her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need to talk to you,” Agatha uttered under her breath, taking the pizza and grasping the taller woman’s hand. Ignoring the spark at the tight grip Rio returned. She ignored the wave she gave to Nicky as she dragged her into the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha, what the hell is going on?” Rio asked through a fake smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need you to be in love with me,” Agatha whispered with a glance to see Nicky's head turned back to the film. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m flattered but last time I checked we were busy trying to kill each other,” Rio chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky suspects,” Agatha said, ignoring the jibe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Suspects what?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He thinks we don’t love each other, we aren’t acting like our normal selves to him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t know what that is,” Rio huffed. “Not exactly.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know but you have memories,” Agatha pointed. “I have impulses, like a habit. So we should act on them while we sort this-” Agatha gestured impatiently to the house. “Out.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” Nicky’s voice called as she heard the thud of small footprints. Agatha’s panic filled her. She acted impulsively, a knee jerk reaction that she knew she would regret. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gripped that perfectly tailored shirt collar and pulled Rio’s lips to her own. It was easy. The same way it had always been centuries ago. Those soft full lips pressing against her own, the pull of Rio’s lip, tugging her between her own. The feeling of Agatha relaxing into the strong grip on her waist as she tilted her head up to accept Rio’s tongue slid along her lip, teasing for entrance, all while her hands gravitated into those perfect dark locks. It was almost too much and not enough at the same time as she felt Rio press closer to deepen the kiss between them and part of Agatha would have happily given into it. Happily gone back to the feeling of those strong hands on her hips, have the taste of Rio on her lips. She would have had it all if not for five little words crashing around her. Reminding her of why she hated this woman so much. Why she was even going back down this road.   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You two are so gross.” </span>

  <p>
  <span>There was only one word to describe what had occurred over the past week. A simple word that had been playing on Agatha's mind as she lay with her eyes fixed on the ceiling above her. A loose thread of the blanket twirled between her long fingers as she processed the actions they had taken to keep Nicky calm. It had started with That kiss, and only became worse. Rio had taken to the role of doting wife a little too well. The kiss had only been the start, now it included holding Agatha's hand while listening to Nicky's day, running her fingertips over the back of Agatha's wrist as they bracketed Nicky while watching television late at night. It had even triggered pecks on the cheek as she had run out the door with Nicky in the mornings. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that wasn't what had her boring holes into the ceiling with her glare. No, what had her boring holes into the plaster was the fact that here she was lying waiting for her wife to finish putting their son to bed so Agatha could sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Odd. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was that little pesky word that kept rattling around in her head for the past week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Odd. Peculiar. She'd go as far to say strange if it wasn't for strange beyond words, that is if it weren't for her being in a world that wasn't her own, no longer dead, her son resurrected nearly two hundred years since his death. People that were almost certainly dead if not certainly dead had returned. And no one has their power. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Peculiar, strange, whatever, none of it even began to put a scratch on her current situation. And let it be known, Agatha Harkness had been in some crazy situations.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The closing of the bedroom door had Agatha glowering. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It's not that bad,” Rio answered her glare. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You're secretly enjoying this,” Agatha snapped. Rio’s chuckle was deep and annoying. And the same chuckle when she had teased Agatha for hours- No. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha refused to think about that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you aren't?” Rio taunted. “You're only lying to yourself if this isn't something you wanted. The all American dream with Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted, “Please, I'm not Wanda Maximoff looking to rewrite reality to get over my grief.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Rio lips pursed as she climbed under the duvet beside her. “You just use Nicky's song for personal gain to go on a mass murdering rampage that spans nearly two hundred years.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha couldn't stop herself, she laughed. “Please, I was doing that long before Nicky.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio settled back against the pillows, her smirk still on her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Besides, you've never complained about it before.” Agatha smirked. “I'm surprised they never gave you some kind of bonus for the bodies I gave you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There's not exactly a quota, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I'd hit it out the park,” Agatha taunted, her arrogance shining through. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio only shook her head and rolled to the side, her back to Agatha. “Good night, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha settled into the warmth of the bed, her mind running through the possibilities. Agatha could barely remember the last time they slept so close, let alone shared a bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached out to the lamp, pausing to perhaps wish Rio good night, but before the thought was there it was gone with a curl of her nose. She had never once wished Rio goodnight ever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Plunging the room into the darkness, Agatha concluded she wasn't going to start now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha wanted to think that was it for playing the game of life with Rio but this fucked universe had another curve ball to throw her the following morning when she descended the stairs to find Rio standing in the kitchen. A thin sheen of sweat covered darkened skin that left her flushed and Agatha's breath caught in her throat at the sight of Rio in a thin tank and leggings. Her ass perfectly curved as she made her way around the kitchen. Regaining her breath, Agatha tightened the robe to prepare herself as she cleared her throat, announcing her presence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning,” Agatha all but croaked as Rio glanced over her shoulder with an arched brow. Fuck, Agatha hated that look. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning,” Rio chirped as she slid the coffee over the counter. “Is Nicky still asleep?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Muttering in his sleep about fractions,” Agatha waved to the stairs with a purse of her lips. “Where have you been?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The azaleas were dying and the trees needed to be cut back for winter so figured I'd get a head start.” It was said with such a casual tone Agatha almost settled into the comfort that this could be normal weekend behavior. Except she hates Rio, despite the way dark eyes dragging over her had her flushing like a fifteen year old, she doesn't want to have that with her. But then Rio continued and yes, Agatha definitely still hated her with what came out those perfect lips afterwards. “Bumped into Sharon and Herb, apparently there's a winter solstice festival in the town square. Everyone’s expected to be there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you didn't think of a way to get us out of it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Think of it as a fact finding mission,” Rio turned fully to Agatha now, her dark eyes dragging to the top of her robe as she stepped closer. “Like the old days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The old days used to be filled with something good at the end.” Agatha rolled her eyes, there was magic here and definitely no sex. They weren't crossing that line. That wall. That- Rio stepped close into Agatha's space, bracketing her between long arms with hands that braced against the counter. Agatha could smell the dirt on her skin, the cold air radiating off her and shit those dark eyes watched her so closely just like they always had. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They can still be filled with something good, Agatha.” Rio's voice dropped low as her fingers tangled in dark hair. Fingertips scraping along Agatha's scalp that had her head tilting back, her eyes fluttering closed as her skin prickled at the sensation. “I'm sure you can be good for just an afternoon.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It almost escaped, almost. But she swallowed the moan that threatened to escape and instead she blinked up at Rio. Rio who was in her space, the smell of freshly turned soil and cut grass filling her nose. Those plump lips only millimetres from her own. “You smell like dirt.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted at the break of the tension and stepped back. As she did, a small thump of feet landing at the foot of the stairs had them turning. Nicky appeared, his hair in disarray as he shuffled to Rio’s side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a sleepy rub of his eyes, he pressed his face to Rio’s hip and with a smile that split her entire face, Agatha’s heart thrummed hard in her chest. A smile that Agatha had only ever seen a handful of times. “Mami?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, pequeño?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky lifted his arms in the silent request and Agatha watched Rio swoop down without thought and lift him into her arms. “What time do we have to go?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In a few hours,” Rio hummed into his hair as he burrowed into the taller witches shoulder. It didn’t stop the feeling of jealousy that bubbled in her chest at the sight but there was something else. Something warm and filling, like that weight in her chest had finally vanished after years of being ever present. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can we go on the carousel?” Nicky asked, his dark eyes finding Agatha next to him and she couldn’t stop but step close to them. Her hand sliding up his back as he slowly woke. The other to Rio’s hip. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure we can,” Agatha smiled and for once it wasn’t short or hiding anything. It felt genuine, like their small family was complete. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <span>A few hours later, and an outfit meltdown from Nicky, they walked down the street towards the town square. Nicky ran ahead, his green scarf billowing behind him as he ran. Without thought, Agatha slipped her hand into Rio’s. The green witch’s brow drew tight for only a moment as she looked at their hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t question it,” Agatha grumbled as they crossed the street. “We’re blending in.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Rio chuckled with a squeeze of her hand. Walking into the town square they could see triangular bunting lining the lampposts and a hay maze around the centre. “Is this a common human holiday?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s own brow drew tight as they paused. “No,” She said slowly, taking in the music and potluck. “It’s not. This is something my coven did.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned fully to her then, “Something your coven did?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We used to celebrate the coming of the sun. The reduction of the night. Nicky and I celebrated it too. It was one of the few  good memories I had.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Interesting,” Rio hummed. Rio looked around and Agatha turned to follow her eyes. Her eyes found Wanda, then Lillia, and Sharon. All dead. She let Rio guide them further into the fair, their eyes taking it in. It was no different than any other town fair she had seen over the years. Herb was grilling some meat on a barbeque and Rio tugged Agatha closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Keep your eyes peeled.” Agatha tried not to roll her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t realise special agent Vidal was joining us,” Agatha croaked but it earned her a smug grin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only when you want to, baby.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” Agatha’s back went ramrod straight at the voice and turned. Nicky automatically stuck close to her side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wanda,” Agatha’s fake smile couldn’t hurt more. “Vision, twins.” Each she regarded looked identical to how they did in the hex. Agatha made a note to write down her findings later. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you enjoying the festivities?” Vision asked, his human form in full view as he looked around them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve only just arrived,” Rio smirked and Agatha hated how the witches' eyes narrowed at the sight of them. “Do you have any recommendations?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you’d be good at the ducks Nicky,” Tommy sniggered and it earned a glare from Agatha. “Nice and easy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure Nicky can pick things on his own,” Agatha practically growled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Wanda laughed with a wave. “Tommy just meant that it might be best for Nicky to start easy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded slowly but then Rio jumped in. “So, how has life been Maximoffs? Have a nice Halloween?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, we had a lovely time.” Vision answered with a chuckle. “The boys went as Avengers which was a bit on the nose given, you know, but since retirement it was a bit of fun to put the old suit on, wasn’t it darling?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda gave a strained smile and a hum but said nothing further. “How has Nicky been getting on at school? The boys said he was a bit upset the other day?” Vision clearly had no tact or the inability to read the room. Agatha could imagine why, he was a robot after all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Better,” Rio answered. “Right bud?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky nodded from Agatha’s side but he only kept his eyes downcast. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hear congratulations are in order?” Agatha pulled all attention back to Wanda. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda had the decency to blush at the praise. “It was quite the surprise, right Vis?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh yes, certainly,” Vision chuckled bashfully and it made Agatha feel nauseous. “Very spontaneous.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That does seem to be a theme with you two,” Agatha teased through gritted teeth. Wanda briefly looked murderous before it was hidden away behind a tight smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky mentioned you were having a girl,” Rio smiled and Agatha hated how Wanda’s hand went to her stomach. Honestly this charade was hard enough. “Almost like the perfect all American family.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha elbowed Rio as subtly as she could at the implication but Wanda and Vision only beamed at the news. It was disgusting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A light tug had her looking back down at Nicky as he quietly asked. “Can we go now, Mama?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Using the escape given to her, Agatha flashed a smile. “Of course we can, have a good night.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her hand gripped Rio's painfully tightly as they walked around the carnival. Nicky dragged them to the juggler, his eyes wide in awe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think she knows?” Rio asked quietly once he was distracted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That this whole thing is a weird charade?” Agatha hummed, shoving her hands deep in the pockets of her trench coat. “No,” Agatha pursed her lips. “I think she’s still got her magic though. How else would she be pregnant?” Agatha paused with a frown before asking, “she is pregnant right?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, “yeah, she’s created another life.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha could see the storm in her eyes, the one that Rio often had when talking about Chaos Magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Four souls is a lot,” Agatha mused. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio only hummed, her eyes still dark. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does she balance it?” Agatha's curiosity always did get ahead of her but it seemed to press at wounds she didn't know Rio had. The older witch turned glaring down at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They're the product of chao magic. Not natural magic. Her magic upsets the natural order of things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's jaw dropped at the sharp tone Rio gave. “I know,” Agatha relented slowly. “But you say everyone's to balance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not chaos magic. That's why it's chaos. It does what it wants, takes what it wants. Makes what it wants.” Rio's brow was drawn tight and Agatha stepped close to Rio. Habit took over as she reached for the deep scowl over her brow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Agatha whispered, running the pads of her fingers over Rio's temple. “I'm just trying to find connections wherever I can. I'm not purposefully antagonizing you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio released a sharp snort. “Makes a change.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, well, I can always go back to that,” Agatha pursed her lips as her walls flew back into place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Rio quickly amended and naturally Agatha took a step back. But then there was a strong hand on her hip. “I'm enjoying seeing my caring brilliant wife again.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hated the warmth that filled her chest, the longing that filled her at the thought of Rio wanting that life- No, it wasn't real. It was just a cruel joke that she was at the end of. She couldn't fall for it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a scoff, Agatha pushed off, moving to where Nicky stood at the ‘hook the duck’. His dark eyes wide with excitement as he grinned up at her. Rio to Agatha’s credit stood back and watched them. Agatha wanted to be good, to prove to Rio she could do it, but instead they were awful and came away with a bottle of 50c bubbles. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama, can we try again?” Nicky looked up with hopeful eyes and Agatha winced. She was awful at this game and it was only getting worse. Not only had she smacked the attendant with the hook, she herself had nearly fallen in the pond. Twice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t we try, bud?” Rio’s voice made relief wash through her. Nicky bounced on the balls of his feet in excitement. His body vibrated with impatience. Agatha watched with frustration as Rio knelt beside Nicky and guided him, but once again it was joined with an emotion she hadn’t felt in a long time. The one that made her stomach fill with wool and her throat thicken with melancholy and longing. Agatha tried to push it away, tried to shove it into the deepest parts of her but there was something about the way they smiled at one another as Nicky hooked a duck that had tears of joy pricking at the corner of her eyes. Containing the emotion, she felt her own smile at her son's joy slip from her. It broke out unrestrained on her face and it was a long moment before she shifted her gaze to the warm brown eyes that watched her with another emotion she hated to see. Hated but wanted. That look of complete love in Rio’s gaze that Agatha hated to be reminded of. Something told her to shrug it off, to avert her eyes, but instead she continued. She allowed herself to fall into it for just an afternoon. It was something she hadn’t dared do but something told her she should. She should enjoy her time with her family and who was Agatha if she didn’t break the rules? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Later, when the night had drawn in and she lay in that small wooden bed as she ran her fingers over Nicky’s exhausted brow, she watched the way his eyelids slowly fought to stay open. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed as she fought her own exhaustion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had fun today,” Nicky’s quiet exhausted voice was the only thing she was interested in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had fun too,” Agatha whispered. It was more a confession to herself than her exhausted son. She’d had fun. She thought of the unrestrained grin that had filled her face as she raced Nicky through inflatables. She thought of the cotton candy she had shared with Rio and she had never felt this weightless in all her life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think we could go tomorrow?” Nicky asked, his eyes now shut and Agatha smiled down at the sight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe another weekend,” Agatha reassured. “We can’t have you getting too good at beating the games.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky hummed in a way that was eerily similar to Agatha herself. She watched him snuggle in closer as his eyes eventually shut and his breathing evened. He was such a peaceful boy, his body relaxing into the warmth of his bed. With a few soft hums Agatha eventually gently pulled away, tucking him in tighter. She made her way down the stairs with a roll of her neck. Stepping into the living room, she found Rio placing a record on the player and arched her brow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m surprised you know how to use that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smirk had butterflies fluttering in her chest. “We aren’t all allergic to technology like you.” Rio placed the needle down and the soft tune filled her ear. “Nicky asleep?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, stepping around the couch and lifting the sleeve. A smile slipped from her at the modern rendition. Memories of their cottage filling her as Rio recounted the poem, a different era, a different tone but all the same. “Where did you find this?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged and took the sleeve, her calloused hand slipping into Agatha’s. “Dance with me?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” Agatha’s chastisement fell like a whisper on the wind. Dark eyes met her own and Agatha could see nothing but the adoration that remained there for centuries. Ever since they had met in the woods one fateful night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio ignored Agatha’s weak protest, pulling her closer ever slowly. Giving her ample opportunity to push back, to step away and put the distance they should have between them. But that wall that Agatha had spent so long fortifying between them was crumbling to sand. Ever slowly, like a magnet, Agatha stepped closer until Rio was in her space. Her hand in Agatha’s holding it so tenderly as if she held it too tight Agatha might slip away. Agatha could smell the faint perfume underneath the sweetness of the fair that day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dark eyes watched her carefully, watched and waited for Agatha to put that wall up between them, but the memory of Rio’s smiling face with Nicky that afternoon flashed and she stepped closer. A soft request slipped from Rio. “Please, my love.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha slowly and cautiously, waiting for the bubble to burst, slid over Rio’s exposed arm, over her shoulder as she stepped into the embrace. She let Rio’s hand slip over her hip and it made that fluttering in the pit of her stomach flutter hard. Over her hip to the small of her back and Agatha’s eyes slipped shut at the prospect of those hands on her again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” a quiet protest slipped her lips as the taller witch stepped back and guided them in a slow sway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you remember the last time we danced like this?” Rio whispered, her breath tickling the shell of Agatha’s ear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yes, Agatha wanted to say. Yes, it was on the Carpathia with 699 passengers, it was the last time she had let herself relax into this same embrace. It was the last time she had seen Rio before she had found the Darkhold. Instead, she simply fell into the dance, into the sway of their bodies as they moved in time to the lyrical notes. She pushed the memories away and fell into the feeling of Rio against her body, of the warmth that she gave off in the moment. It was the fleeting feeling of bubbling in her chest at the memories of their cottage. The roar of the fire and the sentiments of their time. This was different, this wasn’t sentiment, it was something new, tentative and cautious. But even when the song came to a slow end, Agatha didn’t move, her cheek tilted to rest against the softness of Rio’s own hair that cascaded around her shoulders. The smell of her perfume, the soft tones of rain and humidity, the faint fringes of flowers. It made Agatha’s eyes squeeze shut as she let her head drop to Rio’s shoulder. Her hand slipped up to cup the back of Rio’s neck as she pressed closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had missed her. She had missed Rio Vidal and everything she was. The constant strength that Agatha had once needed, the fun they had once had running through the new world together, causing nothing but chaos. But that was before. Before Nicky. Before Rio left her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t want to think about it. She wanted to stay here, in this moment. This life. The one where she got to watch her son grow up, the one where she could have her wife and not lose her to her cosmic requirements. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” It was Rio that slowly pulled away, her calloused hand reaching to cup Agatha’s cheek. “I-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t,” Agatha whispered, pulling away to look up at those dark eyes that were filled with so much regret. “I don’t want to talk.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes flickered with recognition before she dipped her head and Agatha relented. She relented just once in this godforsaken life she had been given. She was tired of fighting. Of running. Instead, she accepted the feeling of Rio’s lips on her own. The pull that had always lain deep within her ran through as the push and pull fluctuated between them. The taste of Rio’s lips against her own, the strength of those hands on her body. Agatha could feel herself falling, slipping deeper into that want. But she couldn’t. She couldn’t forget, at least not completely. A flash of the cold still body against her own had her pulling back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice was soft and curious as eyes watched her carefully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped back out of the embrace and forced a small smile on her face. One, Rio had seen many times before. She turned slowly, making for the stairs. As she reached the foot of them, she turned to where Rio stood waiting. With a hand on the banister, she looked over their life and before climbing the stairs she looked fully into those patient dark eyes. “Goodnight my love.” </span>

  <span>They don’t talk about it. Agatha doesn’t want to, after all, she’s a master avoider. They had kissed not once but now twice. Agatha had let her guard down and Rio had grasped onto whatever slither of Agatha she could take. Nicky was thankfully oblivious. He hadn’t picked up on the shift between them, nor the fact that Rio was in bed long after Agatha and up long before either she or Nicky rose. Instead, Agatha left her at night on the couch and then woke to find her making coffee in the kitchen. It was an odd routine for the second week of this bizarre place but Agatha could do avoidance. She was an expert. After all, she had avoided her grief for nearly two hundred years. What was two weeks of distance from her ex wife? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As it turns out, hard. They didn’t stop the charade. For Nicky’s sake as per Rio’s words. Agatha couldn’t really argue. Afterall, the whole reason she had put her lips on hers was for Nicky. Agatha silently thought of all the things she would do for her son that was not on her bingo card. Kissing Rio as she left for her morning with Nicky wasn’t and neither was lying cuddled against one another at night as they listened to Nicky recite the events of his day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had been staring at the god forsaken crown moulding for hours now. For once the darkness wasn’t giving in to allow her to sleep. Instead, she thought of Rio’s soft touch, of her pillowy lips and the taste of her on Agatha’s tongue. Agatha rolled to the side and huffed. This was ridiculous. It had been over a century since she had given in to temptation and one kiss. That was all it took to break down Agatha’s fortress. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She ran a hand over her face as she thought about how she couldn’t think of anything else apart from that bloody kiss. Rio, who was lying next to her with even breathing, had clearly fallen asleep easily. So much for a cosmic entity who didn’t need to sleep. Agatha huffed under her breath. She was ready to rise from the bed and go and do literally anything else when Rio stirred beside her. Rolling onto her back, not a position Rio was ever in when it came to sleeping or even resting. Agatha could see the draw of her brows in the darkness, the down turn of her lips as she twitched through her dream. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Rio's voice escaped her softly as her brow drew tighter and her eyes squeezed shut. “No, please, not him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio's head tossed violently to the side and Agatha's eyes widened. She was having a nightmare. Her eyes scrunched as Agatha shifted, her name a whisper on Agatha's lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing changed. Only more strained words. “No, please, I can't- I, no.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” Agatha tried a little louder, her hand on Rio's burning shoulder. “You need to wake up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not him,” Rio pleaded to her night terror. “Please, not Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's hand retracted as if burned. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Nicky.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Rio was having a nightmare about Nicky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can't- No- Please don't make me, not again.” Rio's painful sob ricocheted through her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” Agatha's voice was soft, her concern etching into the whisper. “Rio, it's ok, you need to wake up, my love.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no, no,” Rio's head arched back, tears forming under scrunched eyes and Agatha's heart cracked. “Not Nicky. Not again. Please!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My love,” Agatha shook Rio's shoulder, using her other hand to brush sweat slicked hair from her forehead. “Nicky's fine, he's asleep across the hall. Come on, wake up for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky-” Rio sobbed, tendons prominent under tanned skin as her neck arched.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” Rio surged upright, dark eyes frantically looking around. But what had Agatha reeling was the pulse of energy that surged across the room. For only a moment did she stare at the fractured glass showing her jaw dropped, eyes wide and a face of only shock staring back at her. Rio- Rio had flung a surge of magic only she could possess across the room leaving fractures across mirrored glass. Rio has magic. How- When? But ragged breathing made her turn, made her forget it for a moment as she looked to the trembling body next to her. Rio. Her Rio. Rio, who was hunched and curled in on herself.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s jaw worked for a moment struggling to find the words. But then something deep inside her told her to get a grip. “It’s alright, it was just a dream.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“N-Nicky?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Asleep in his bed,” Agatha reassured without thought, her hand moving to push back dark hair stuck to Rio’s temple. For a moment, she paused, reminiscent of the same gesture Rio had when Agatha had first gone into labour, but then dark eyes snapped up to her own and Agatha brushed the strands away. Rio’s breathing was the only noise filling the room, her eyes squeezed back shut, her brow drawn close. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could see it all, see it all happening again,” Rio’s voice broke as she curled her knees to her chest. “I-I had to take him again.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bile rose in Agatha’s throat. “But you aren’t going to, are you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t do it again, I can’t do it again Agatha,” Rio’s voice rose in pitch as panic set into her bones. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, my love, I know,” Agatha breathed and she moved without thought, she pulled Rio into her arms and held her close. “I couldn’t survive it either.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t know how long she sat there curled around Rio, holding her as she tried to ground herself. To move away from the thoughts that plagued her. She thought of waking, holding her baby boy and not knowing if it would be the last time she got to feel him breathing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I used to watch you both, you know,” Rio whispered into the flannel of her sleeping shirt. “I used to see the adventures you would take him on. I hated myself for so long for what I’ve done to you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I still hate you,” Agatha muttered more out of habit than truth but she wasn’t about to let Rio know that. “I just can’t lose him again.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t do that to us again,” Rio shifted and perched on the edge of the bed, she hunched over, her elbows braced on her knees. “I won’t do it again.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t promise that Rio,” Agatha sighed, moving closer. “But I appreciate the thought.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean it, Agatha,” Rio huffed as she stood. “I’m going to check on Nicky.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let him sleep,” Agatha protested, her fear returning as she thought of the last time Rio had gone near Nicky when he slept. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be back in a minute.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was nearly halfway out of the bed but Rio was gone. With an internal cry, Agatha moved and followed Rio into the hallway. She paused however at the vanity table and ran a thumb over the cracked mirror. She hadn’t imagined it. Moving, she walked quietly to find Rio standing, leaning against the door jam, her face blank. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Within the room, Nicky slept peacefully and Agatha stopped at the sight. The sight of her wife watching her son sleeping. Protecting herself, protecting their son. Watching over him. It was something that made Agatha’s stomach do somersaults. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She let Rio watch him for several long moments. Then slowly, she stepped close, as if she had done it hundreds of times before. “Come back to bed, my love.” Agatha whispered, softly and dark eyes turned to her. “Let him sleep.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To Agatha’s surprise, Rio relented, she let Agatha take her hand and lead her back to bed. Once back under the covers, she let Agatha hold her and when the room plunged once more back into darkness, even breaths soothed and relaxed her into sleep. It wasn’t until Agatha’s eyes felt heavy did Rio’s question set her wide awake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha? What happened to the mirror?” </span>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was a master at diversions which is why she managed to avoid telling Rio she had performed magic from her nightmare. Instead, she chalked it up to her being clumsy with the dusting. Honestly, the fact Rio bought it up shocked her more. Agatha was 99% sure she had never dusted in her life. She kept the information to herself only to do some research. She had to find out the limits of magic in this world, which was hard when all of the witches that she knew of suddenly didn’t have their powers. She hauled every book out of her little library and scoured every source she had on magic. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not a drop of helpful information. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a heavy sigh and an exhausted rub of her eyes, she looked up to find Nicky in the doorway watching her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky? What are you doing?” Agatha’s voice wavered because if you have ever just caught a child staring at you, it's creepy. Creepy wasn't an adjective she often wanted associated with her son, but it was. He was stood there with his brow furrowed and an expert pout to match, Agatha sat back in her office chair and waited as his lower lip wobbled before he shuffled closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t you happy Mama?” He asked in that little voice of his. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean, my love?” Agatha’s heart clenched as it always did when he asked her questions like this. She turned the chair and opened her arms to him at which he gladly shuffled closer to her and then he leant against her knee, his head dipped. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just want you to be happy with us,” Nicky said, his voice still low and wavering but Agatha’s natural instincts took over. She scooped him up and settled him on her thigh. He was almost too big to do this now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am happy Nicky,” Agatha reassured with a squeeze. “I’ll always be happy with you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then can we go to the park tomorrow?” His asks, his eyes hopeful. How had Agatha ever said no to this boy? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course we can.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The park was, of course, Agatha’s idea of hell. Snotty noses, crying children and screaming and shouting. At least, Rio was equally suffering beside her. The scowl on Death’s face made it worth every cry for a mommy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t remember Nicky being this loud,” Rio grumbled as a young girl screamed at the prospect of being caught by another child. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He wasn’t,” Agatha grimaced as she watched a child wipe snot over the handlebars. “He was an angel.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s head snapped like a whip at the snort Rio gave. “What?” Agatha sneered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He wasn’t an angel,” Rio chuckled. “You’re being biased.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So what if I am?” Agatha sniffed. “He is perfect. He isn’t loud or boisterous. He’s content to play by himself, he doesn’t whine or cause trouble.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yet,” Rio sniggered. “He’s only six.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes well,” Agatha rolled her shoulders at the prospect of watching Nicky grow up. It was terrifying. “I’m sure he’ll stay this way forever.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice lowered, her tone turning dark. “Do you ever wonder when the bubble’s going to pop?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked up and was shocked to find Rio watching her closely. The kind that made Agatha shift under the intense gaze. “Of course.” Agatha hated how her voice wavered. “Do you know when that might be?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s grin was feral. “We both know this isn’t me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’d be easier if it was,” Agatha grumbled under her breath as she watched Nicky run after a young blonde. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And why’s that, my love?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because then I could work out how to get out of this nightmare.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re just worried you might actually be happy for once,” Rio called out, her tone void of emotion that had Agatha looking back at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you? Would you be happy here?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned, her dark eyes taking Agatha in, “I’m happy wherever we are. As long as it’s the three of us this time.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The corner of Agatha’s eyes crinkled as she slowly spread a smile over her face. “That’s sickening.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smirk was slow and purposeful. “That’s what we’ve always been, right? Sickening?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I doubt the PTA wants to hear about the sinking of the Hindenburg,” Agatha teased as she straightened her shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean they don’t want to hear about the anniversary gift you gave me?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who said it was for you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I doubt you did it for Hela?” Rio sipped the coffee in her hand with a slow smirk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please,” Agatha snorted. “I have better taste than that overdramatic Asguardian.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled as she leant back into the wooden bench, her elbow draped over the back, knees crossed as she took in the playground where Nicky ran happily. Agatha watched Rio, really watched her, the slight crease of her eyes, the way her jaw was raised with an air of superiority only Rio could manage. She watched dark eyes follow their son, the way she occasionally lifted a hand to wave as Nicky turned back to check they were where he left them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does it make you proud?” Agatha asked, forcing Rio’s eyes back on her. “To know that all this life is in balance.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brow crinkled for a moment, her smirk falling before the mask was back in place. A small smile graced her face as she turned back to Nicky. “Does it make you happy knowing that you could potentially have your son forever if you left whatever this is alone?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But it’s not natural, you said it yourself,” Agatha quietly countered, pushing dark locks from her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I don’t care,” Rio huffed. “Maybe this is what I want. What I always wanted.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Rio snapped under her breath. “I know it's not real, or natural but sometimes when I sit and listen to his day all I can think about is how badly I missed out on all of this.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You chose not to be there,” Agatha sneered. Her lip curling as anger licked hot in her chest. “You chose to not see him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I watched from a distance, Agatha.” Rio sighed. “I didn’t want you constantly hiding from me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let it drop, the pressure in the wound becoming too much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s happy here,” Rio voiced after a long, painful moment. “He seems more energetic, content.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There's indoor plumbing and medical care, what do you expect?” Agatha griped. Of course he would have been better off in this time. He could have lived, he could have had this perfect life that had been crafted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled low in her throat, “my point is-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your point is that you want to accept this,” Agatha snapped. “But what happens when it all gets ripped away again, Rio? What happens when Nicky is dead and I’m gone and you are alone again?” Agatha’s tirade spilled and erupted from a place she didn’t know she was capable of going. “Can you honestly say you would be happy knowing about what you could have had? I know what it's like to have my world ripped from me and I know I won’t handle that again.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s silent as her dark eyes are soft as she looks forward. Her face was blank and unreadable. “Do you think I didn’t grieve for Nicky?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched as those dark eyes slowly and painstakingly turned to her. “Because I did, Agatha. I spent centuries seeing that little boy in every soul that was similar. Every boy that crossed into my realm I thought was him. But I had already committed the one crime I know I should never have done and it rips me apart every time I think of him. Lying, cold and dead in your arms.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Rio growled, turning to face her fully. Tears threatening to fall from dark lashes. “You seem to think I did this to you. But I did what I did because I had too. I wasn’t going to let him wander the plain between worlds just because you couldn’t cope with the reality that I had to take him and yes, it kills me to know that he was safe in my world but I can’t think of doing it again. I know I can’t take him or lose him to Death again. He was my son too and he never deserved to die but it's the natural order of things, Agatha and even I can’t cheat myself.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you’re burying your head in the sand?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m enjoying the time I never got to spend with my son,” Rio’s words slip through clenched teeth. “I don’t want to miss anymore if I don’t have too.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what about when it all slips away, Rio?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I’ll fight to get it back.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha can feel the argument grow weary in her bones. “Rio-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama!” Agatha doesn’t get to finish her caution as Nicky runs to them, his eyes wide and alight with excitement. His soft locks windswept from running. “Did you see?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course we did,” Rio chuckled, soothing his dishevelled hair. “Some excellent climbing.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I went so fast down the slide!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sure did,” Rio laughed at his energy and it was infectious. The happiness that seeped from their pores when they were with one another- who wouldn't want this? Could Agatha really blame Rio when deep down she wanted this too? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And then did- did you see-” Nicky's gasps came in short and sharp and Agatha shifted closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky, slow down,” Agatha pleaded softly, her flashes to a memory of Nicky coughing made her go cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine, Mama,” He wheezed and now her brow drew tight as she shifted closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky,” Agatha warned as she held him against her knee. His breaths in short sharp gasps, with a pleading look she turned to Rio who had shifted closer, worry splashed across her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky, just slow down ok?” Rio’s voice took that authoritarian tone that it took when things didn’t go to plan, when she was deeply concerned and she couldn’t hide it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky’s breaths were struggling to come out in an even form now, his own brow drawn tight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s panic rose and she turned to Rio, Rio who had equally turned to her with worry sketched across her face. “Rio? Rio, what’s wrong with him? Why can’t he breathe?” Agatha turned to Nicky, whose eyes were filled with panic and tears. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m calling an ambulance,” Rio announced in a tone Agatha swore she had never heard before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Amb- What?” Agatha all but screeched, her body frozen, her limbs wouldn’t move. No- No this wasn’t happening. Not now. “Rio!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned her eyes dark. “He can’t breathe, Agatha, he needs a doctor.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” Nicky’s wheezing panic snapped Agatha from her own panic. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright baby,” Agatha forced herself to smile. “We’re going to fix it, ok? We’re going to make it all better.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take long, his breathing continued to fill her with fear and terror that she knew was happening, but then the paramedics were there and the people in the park were watching with wide eyes that made Agatha’s teeth on edge. She didn’t care as she followed them into the back of the ambulance and there was no question as Rio announced she would follow with the car. Agatha didn’t even look back. Her eyes were only for Nicky with that awful plastic over his nose, his forehead stricken with sweat and his eyes wide with fear. She tried, painfully, to reassure him, to tell him it would be alright but it was hard when her hands shook and her tears fell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mama?” Nicky’s wheezing voice made her force a smile but he only griped her hand tighter. “Where’s Mami?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s coming Nicky, it’s going to be ok, try not to worry, they’re going to make everything better I promise.” Agatha was rambling, it wasn’t a promise she knew if she could even keep. She had been here before. She had watched him battle that fever and there was nothing she could do. Now, she was just as helpless. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ma’am, we’re here,” She hated how the paramedic looked at her with those pity filled eyes. But before she could even snap, Nicky was whisked away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, Nicky!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright,” A nurse, urgh she hated it, stepped in her way. “We’re going to run some tests, the doctor will update you soon.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swore under her breath as she began to pace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are there any allergies we need to be aware of?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No- No, he’s just a boy, a normal boy,” Agatha felt her voice crack as she uttered those words. She’d uttered them before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” There was that pitying smile again. “We’ll update you as soon as we can.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span> She was on her fifth stride and plotting how to rip the nurses eyeballs out when Rio ran in. Her eyes wide and for the first time since waking up here. Murderous. “Where is he?” Rio growled at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They took him, they- they said they had to run tests,” Agatha gestured to the double doors her son had disappeared through. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you’re still here?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want him to live, Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So do I!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, let them do their jobs,” Agatha spat. Agatha froze, her next words tasting like venom “Unless you know something I don’t.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio spun and redirected all the anger at Agatha, her jaw set, her eyes wide and her nostrils flared. “I’m not here for that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t justify her with an answer and instead went to the desk. Rapid Spanish ensued and Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. Her head was pounding. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha spun, never before happy to hear that tone of distaste in her life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jen!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha walked quickly over to where Jen stood, pink scrubs and all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky- They- they took Nicky-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen visibly softened. “I know, come with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen led her and Agatha didn’t even think as she followed. “He had an asthma attack, undiagnosed previously but that’s what it was.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded as they reached the small ward, filled with colourful animals on the wall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now before I go back and get the noted sociopath of your ex, I’m hoping to god you remember.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nearly fainted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You- You aren’t under the spell?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Agatha, I am not.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“H-How?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Jen squawked. God, Agatha wanted to ring her neck. “I was hoping you could tell me since the last thing I remember was unbinding myself and then I’m here, stuck in this hospital wandering empty halls until you turn up and it’s like an episode of Grey’s Anatomy in here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What The Fuck.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to regain her footing. Jen knew. Jen knew who she was. “Alright, alright.” Agatha grounded, holding her palm flat. “You remember, that’s- that’s good. So far it’s only you, Rio and I that can remember anything.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the hell does that mean?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a really long story,” Agatha sighed, pushing her hair from her face. “First things first, I need to see Nicky.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t wait and turned, pushing through the doors to find Nicky propped up in the bed. The sight floored her. He was here. He was fine. That toothy grin smiled back at her and despite looking tiny in that hospital bed he was fine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dr Jen fixed me, Mama!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nearly crumbled to tears as she curled around him and kissed the crown of soft hair. He was here. He was still here. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She did,” Agatha bit back her sobs and as she did, she looked up to find Rio stepping into the room. Her hands shaking, her body trembling as dark eyes were still welled with tears. “He’s alright,” Agatha whispered and it earned her a shaky nod, one that had her stumbling to the bed and Agatha wrapped them both in her arms. Her family. That’s whatever this life had given her. Her family. The family she had never had. The one she had only briefly had with Nicky but with both Nicky and Rio, she felt complete. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe- Just maybe she could enjoy whatever this was. </span>
