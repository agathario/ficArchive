     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      “I don’t think you want to hurt me, though,” Rio said. And she meant it.
     </p>
     <p>
      “No.” Agatha raised her hand to Rio’s face, fixing a strand of hair behind her ear. Rio didn’t flinch. “But I may not be able to resist it. Self-control is not my strong suit.”
     </p>
     <p>
      They stood quietly for a second, Agatha’s hand lingering near Rio’s cheek.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Bite me.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The words slipped from Rio’s lips before she could think them through. The idea had been dancing in the back of her mind since she stepped into the office that night, the request the thing that had been keeping her there, stopping her from escaping.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agatha blinked at her like she was an alien. “What?”
     </p>
     <p>
      or
     </p>
     <p>
      Rio is a vampire-obsessed nerd investigating the mysterious attacks on campus. Meet Agatha Harkness, the occult studies professor who may have a few explanations and secrets. What could go wrong?

      It was far too early for her to be sitting at her desk, an open book waiting to be read.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Under normal circumstances, there was no way in hell Rio Vidal would be awake at 10 a.m., let alone reading. She should’ve still been sound asleep, her alarm not set to ring for another two hours, allowing her just enough time to shower, eat the half-cookie she’d left on her desk the night before, and sprint to her first class.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This was not a normal circumstance.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had spent the past week—the past month, to be honest—neglecting her coursework to obsessively investigate the recent spike in criminal activity at Westview University. It wasn’t like she didn’t have things to worry about. Her professors, in their infinite wisdom, had conveniently decided to schedule their major deadlines for the same week. She was drowning in unfinished projects and rapidly falling behind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her roommate, Jennifer, had no idea what was wrong with her. Why couldn’t she just let it go? Who cared if there was a serial killer loose on campus? They already had finals to worry about.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And yet, Rio couldn’t stop scanning the pages of the book in front of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Ever since the semester had started, almost two months ago, weird shit had been happening on campus: animals from the surrounding woods turning up drained of their blood, students suffering violent animal attacks, stumbling into the nursery with serious memory loss issues.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      What was even more surprising was no one seemed to be asking questions.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had tried. She’d gone to the police, approached the students, but they all had given her the same monotonous answer. Yes, they were okay. No, they couldn't remember what had happened. And she should just leave it alone and get back to her studies.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sure, they weren’t wrong about that last part. She
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       should
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      be focusing on her post-graduate work, opening her laptop instead of flipping through those old and dusty books, refining her codes to make sure her project worked instead of chasing ghosts. But there was a strange magnetism pulling her towards the open cases. A need for answers that wouldn’t let her sleep what few hours she allowed herself each night.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Someone
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       had
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      to care about the attacks. Someone
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       had
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      to be seeing what she was seeing. Animal attacks beginning at the same time as all the students came back from break? It couldn’t be a coincidence.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had always been interested in the supernatural, probably a side effect of watching
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Twilight
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      too many times as a teenager—which, in her defense, was Kristen Stewart’s fault. She had spent most of her formative years at the local library, digging through the mythology section. Fairies, pixies, werewolves, vampires. Rio had desperately wanted to believe it could all be real. It was an escape for her. She couldn’t count how many times she’d dressed up as Dracula for Halloween, her mother tying the red-lined cape around her neck, carefully applying fake blood at the corners of her mouth to scare all of the other kids.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The memory stung.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When she’d first started college, Rio had sworn she would stop digging through ancient archives, getting her hopes up for a world that didn’t exist. She’d thrown all of her notebooks away, letting them become evidence of a childish obsession, something she had to grow out of. If she wanted to make it out of university sane, she knew she needed to focus on what was real. Normal human beings. Computers. Things she could touch and control.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But when the crimes had first started piling up with no satisfying conclusion, that old urge to investigate had weaved its way back into her brain. It was as if her entire body ached for an answer, for closure for the victims, and maybe for herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That morning, an alert lit up her screen just before dawn.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Another attack, in the middle of the night. A girl, her neck covered in blood, had been found by a security guard wandering campus barefoot. According to the article, it had been ruled out as yet another animal attack.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had been on her feet in a matter of seconds.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Now, as she flipped through the dusty brown pages, Jen caught sight of her before leaving for her own class, her backpack slung over one shoulder. She probably clocked the dark bags under Rio’s eyes but had the decency not to comment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know, you should talk to my professor about all of this,” she’d suggested, leaning against the doorframe.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio looked up from her desk, eyebrows raised in mock offense. “Are you suggesting I see a shrink?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, you idiot,” Jen said, smacking her arm. “I mean my
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       occult studies
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      professor. She might actually get all your weird nerdy shit.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio tilted her head to the side, lips curling into a grin. “Is this your polite way of saying you want me and my nerdy shit out of the room?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She was well aware that wasn’t what Jen meant. It was fun teasing her anyway.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m just saying,” Jen said as she grabbed her water bottle. “Talking to her won’t hurt. Plus, she’s like,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       really
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      hot.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh my God, get out of here!” Rio groaned, half laughing, half serious.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen winked and shut the door behind her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shook her head, exhaling and guiding her eyes back to the book. She’d spent the morning reading up on vampirism, the focus of her latest obsession. Dragons were out—no traces of fires in the woods. Fairies seemed pretty much harmless from what she’d read. Zombies… Well, that was a rabbit hole she wasn’t ready to go down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She’d narrowed her options to two possible explanations: werewolves, or vampires.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had decided to first focus on vampires, since she still remembered most of what she’d learned when she was younger.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The basics were pretty much common knowledge: blood, onions, wooden stakes, sunlight. That last part didn’t add up. Most attacks had happened at night, sure, mainly after some unsupervised party in the woods. Alcohol and animals could easily be blamed, but vampires were still on the table.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then, last week, a girl had shown up in broad daylight with a fresh bite mark on her arm, blood still dripping. She couldn’t remember how, but she’d woken up in the woods, the wound on her arm pulsing. Rio had been working in the empty classroom facing the clinic, waiting for something exactly like that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She remembered the jolt of excitement, the smile on her face when she saw the wounded girl. She’d had to wipe it off immediately, afraid of looking like a psychotic killer herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That had been the first and only attack to happen under broad daylight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And it meant vampires were off the table, too. Vampires didn’t walk in sunlight. Everyone agreed on that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Still, Rio couldn’t shake the feeling there had to be something more. The book in front of her contained the same information she’d read thousands of times already: vampires cannot walk under the sunlight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was clear, not leaving much room for doubts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But she’d seen the bite mark on that girl’s arm. It didn’t look like it had come from a raccoon or a fox. Not anything that lived naturally in Westview’s woods, at least.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Maybe the information was outdated. After all, her sources all dated from the eighteenth century or earlier.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Which brought her back to Jen’s suggestion.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If there was anyone who could help her figure out whether vampires could survive in daylight—or if they existed at all— it’d be the occult studies professor at the university where the crimes were happening.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio closed the book then, carefully covering it in a plastic sleeve to protect it from one of Jen’s inevitable tea spills. Then she opened her laptop to search for the professor in question.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen was right. She
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       was
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      hot.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And luckily, Rio still had time to catch office hours.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She hopped on the shower quickly, changing from her sweatpants and old dirty shirt into something more presentable. Something that meant she was to be taken seriously. The last thing she needed was a college professor thinking she was insane, too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Once she was sure she didn’t look like a teenage boy—her dark jeans and over-sized black button-up making her feel more like herself—Rio stepped out of her dorm room and walked toward the professor’s office.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stopped in front of the closed door.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Office 69
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Clever.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She took a moment to gather herself. Knowing the professor was hot had kind of thrown her off. For some reason she couldn’t yet decipher, she wanted to make a good impression. And a student asking questions about the latest attack on campus? Not exactly the smoothest icebreaker.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But she needed to know.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio raised her hand and knocked on the wooden door. Once. Then twice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come on in,” said a voice from inside.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio opened the door and stepped in. The moment the door shut behind her, all the light coming from the hallway was seemingly absorbed by the room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Even if, according to the rest of the country, it was the middle of the day, it was late in the evening inside that office.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The place was dimly lit, with only a few warm lamps illuminating the space and lighted candles decorating floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. As her eyes adjusted to the sudden change of lightning, Rio was able to make out a heavy oak desk sitting near the far window, its dark curtains drawn tight. Behind it, sitting in a chair that resembled a throne more than office furniture, was professor Harkness.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio walked to the desk and, looking everywhere but her face, took the hand the woman was offering. Her skin was soft to the touch, as if it had never been wrinkled. Not once.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hi, Professor Harkness. I’m Rio Vidal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It felt ridiculous, introducing herself like that, like the woman was supposed to care about a student’s name.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But she smiled as she shook her hand. “Pleasure to meet you. Sit, please,” she said, gesturing to the empty chair across from her with her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio obeyed, settling into the seat and pulling out her notebook and pen from her backpack. She took a moment to glance around.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was a pile of papers on the desk, probably midterms the professor had been in the middle of grading, a fancy and visibly expensive fountain pen abandoned beside them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, Ms. Vidal,” the professor began, “I’m fairly certain you’re not in my class. I’d remember you, trust me. So what brings you here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The words made Rio do a double take.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       What?
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sensing her confusion, the professor laughed softly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s eyes snapped upward at the sound. And
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fuck
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It had to be illegal, someone having eyes like that. That color, that shade of
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       blue
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . There had to be a law somewhere that said no one should be allowed to have such beautiful, hypnotic eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They were mesmerizing, and more than a little terrifying.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I mean,” the woman carried on casually, “most students avoid this part of the building like the plague. I’m guessing you’re not most students, though.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Rio. GET IT TOGETHER. This is just a professor. You are a normal human being who knows how to speak. TALK.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right,” she replied once she remembered how to speak, nodding way too many times. God, she was a mess. “My roommate, Jennifer Kale, is in your class, and she suggested I should talk to you. About… paranormal things.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She hoped her stutter was barely noticeable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Professor Harkness leaned back against her chair, her hands neatly folded on her lap.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Go on, shoot your question.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sure you’re aware of the attacks happening on campus over the past month,” Rio began, feeling more in her element as she recounted what she’d found. Talking to a beautiful woman was hard, but talking about things out of the ordinary? She could handle that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The police say it’s wild animals from the woods attacking the victims, but I don’t buy it. I’ve seen the victims, spoken to them. They can't remember anything, and they all have these weirdly clean marks on their arms and necks.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio took a breath, realizing she was talking too fast, saying too many things at once. “I just thought you might have, I don’t know, expert insight.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio braced herself for laughter. For dismissal. It would’ve been the normal, expected reaction. Instead, though, the professor nodded once, slowly, like she was genuinely considering Rio’s words.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The professor moved the stack of papers on her desk to the side with deliberate care. “You think it’s drugs? Group delusion? I might know a thing or two about that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before Rio had time to reframe her question, the woman leaned in across on the desk, her chin resting on one of her hands.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Or do you think something… occult is going on here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio tilted her head, the trace of a smile ghosting over her lips. “Just curious. Doesn’t it all sound weirdly coincidental to you? The memory loss, the bite marks…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The professor chuckled under her breath. “What exactly are you saying, Ms. Vidal?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Suddenly, the space around them felt charged with electricity.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio held her gaze, drawing a breath. The question felt like a challenge. She was either about to ridicule herself, or come one step closer to finding the answers she needed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Vampires. I’m saying I think it’s vampires.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There it was. Her most insane theory, laid bare in front of the hottest woman Rio had seen in all her life.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But the professor didn’t laugh, nor look at her like she was insane. She kept her smile steady and just stood up, moving around the desk until she was standing right beside Rio’s chair.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, you think vampires are attacking students,” she said, “and instead of flying back home, you decided to come to me for answers? How brave, Ms. Vidal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was trying—really trying—to keep a clear head. But this woman was making it impossible to focus. The hair was tied in a loose ponytail, strand of it falling in soft waves around the professor’s face. Her big glasses framed her face perfectly, sliding slightly down her nose as she looked down at Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And the way she spoke made it even more confusing. It sounded like she believed what Rio was saying was within the realm of possibilities, and yet she sounded so alarmingly calm, so relaxed for someone who was considering the actual existence of vampires.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Narrowing her eyes, Rio tilted her head. “You’re not scared.” She didn’t frame it as a question. “You’re almost…
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       entertained
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      by the idea.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The professor’s eyes glinted as she smiled. “Honey, I teach
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       occult studies
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . I take joy wherever I can find it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nodded, even if she didn’t fully understand the answer. “Right. So you’re saying you think it’s possible? Vampires being real, I mean.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman pressed her lips together. “If I didn’t, I’d be out of a job.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re dodging my question.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not dodging, just answering artfully.” She grinned. “There’s a difference.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio frowned, but she couldn’t let up now. “Fine, I’ll rephrase. Do
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       you
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      think there’s something non-human attacking students here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman leaned back against the desk, her hands holding on to its edge. Rio had to will herself not to stare at the veins in those hands.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I think the university’s definition of non-human changes based on donor funding. But I think
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       you
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      think that, and that’s enough to pique my interest.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio prayed the low lights hid the faint reddening on her cheeks. She felt like an idiotic high-school kid, flustered by the first compliment from her highly attractive professor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right. I’ve gathered some evidence—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But the professor cut her off before she had time to take out her folder. “Not so fast, darling. Here,” she said, reaching into her pocket and producing a small piece of paper.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She handed it to her. A phone number.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Text me and I’ll call you once I’ve done some investigating myself. Okay?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stood up, her notebook still blank in her hand, and grabbed her things.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right, sure,” she said, almost stumbling over the words.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She made her way to the door. The woman stood in place, watching her the whole way.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before opening it, Rio turned back. “Thanks for your help, Professor Harkness.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “God, please call me Agatha or I’ll kill myself.” The woman chuckled. “And you’re welcome, Ms. Vidal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nodded and stepped out of the office.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She now officially had more questions than answers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio skipped most of her classes that day.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her conversation with Professor Harkness—Agatha—had left her even more confused than before. There was something unsettling about their conversation, something that kept nagging at her even as she attempted to finish her more urgent project.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      How could she have been so calm as they discussed the possibility of vampires being real? She hadn’t even flinched at the mention of the memory loss, nor when Rio had mentioned the bite marks she’d seen. It was almost as if Agatha knew all of that already…
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Which didn’t add up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shook her head, forcing her eyes to stay focused on the screen. She had to get this code right, but she was unable to find the source of the error.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And the letters and numbers kept floating away, her attention drifting to blue eyes, a big nose, wavy hair…
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If Agatha knew something about the attacks, why hadn’t she reported it to the police? Unless she was the one behind them, it didn’t make sense.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      No.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio tried not to think about that possibility. And yet, somehow, it almost made sense.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She opened up a new tab. She typed in
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha Harkness
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      into the search bar, and waited for the page to fill up with links.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But it didn’t.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was only one link leading to her profile on the Westview University site. No Facebook profile, no previous jobs, no personal information. Nothing. It was as if she hadn’t existed before this year, when she’d started working there. The only picture online was the one from the university’s profile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The gears in Rio’s head started turning.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She opened her notes on the attacks. The names of the victims, where they’d been found, the little details they’d remembered. All of them were women. The first victims had been visitors on campus, then the attacks moved on to students. Most, if not all of them, had attended Agatha’s class at least one, according to the records Rio found online.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Either it was all a massive coincidence, or something was up with Agatha Harkness.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She needed to come up with a plan. And it wasn’t long before she came up with one.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio spent the rest of the afternoon and early evening
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       actually
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      checking her project. She even managed to find the source of that pain-in-the-ass error, so she was feeling pretty damn proud of herself when she finally left her room later that same night.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Rio had asked earlier, Jen had mentioned there was a rumor going around  about Professor Harkness. According to extremely unreliable sources, she could be found most nights at the local underground bar just off campus, flirting her way through the night on her own, an old fashioned in her hand at all times.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t believe them, though. Mainly because there was no way in hell a woman like
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       that
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      was single.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And so, as Rio walked into the bar, she was genuinely surprised to find Agatha sitting on a stool at the bar. She had her back turned to her, and even if she’d only seen her once before, Rio was able to immediately recognize her by the waves of her hair, her posture, the energy she exuded. She’d rather die than admit it, but there was something so attractive about her it sent a shiver down Rio’s spine.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She signaled a waiter, ordered a beer, and sat at an empty table in the corner of the room. Her eyes never left Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was dressed plainly, in all black—jeans and a fitted shirt. Her best attempt at a spy disguise. Agatha, however, looked straight out of a magazine. Rio was unable to notice much from the waist down, but she could not tear her eyes away from the white button-up Agatha was wearing, her sleeves rolled up, her hair falling loose down her back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had to tell herself she was only staring because it was part of the investigation. That was it. And the only reason she was feeling heated was because someone had decided to turn the heating all the way up. No other reason. Certainly nothing to do with her friend’s university professor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Apparently that was distraction enough, because suddenly a woman Rio didn’t recognize appeared beside Agatha, talking to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio sat up straighter, leaning in, unable to look away. The professor was clearly responding, because the woman kept talking and giggling like a flustered teenager. The stranger must’ve said something quite funny, because then Agatha was laughing, her hand reaching out to lightly brush the woman’s arm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For a second, Rio wished she could switch places with the woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She shook the thought away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It turned out the rumors were true. There was no criminal activity taking place, however, so she was once again stalled in a dead end.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Just when Rio was about to stand up and leave, Agatha did. She had her hand wrapped around the woman’s wrist, and when she turned, Rio was able to catch the outline of her side profile, so perfectly carved against the dim lights it made her want to close her mouth around that nose.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      God, she had to find a way to stop thinking about biting her main suspect.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha guided the woman across the bar, far from Rio’s table, and out through a backdoor she hadn’t noticed before. The second the door closed behind them, Rio was on her feet, following them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she closed the door, Rio found herself in a dark, quiet hallway. The music from the bar was barely a distant echo, like the entire length of the space was shielded from any interference from the rest of the world.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She stayed close to the door, her entire body tense, holding her breath. Where the fuck was Agatha?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      To her left, something moved. A shadow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio descended the two steps separating her from the ground. She stepped closer until she was able to distinguish two figures against the wall.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman was caged between the bricks and Agatha’s body. The only sounds were Agatha’s gasps of evident pleasure as she kissed the woman’s lips, her jaw, her neck.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio couldn’t tear her eyes away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And Agatha couldn’t tear her lips away, it seemed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A heated rush surged through Rio’s body as she watched, her insides turning with sudden, unfamiliar need. Agatha moved like she was in a trance, her back still turned to Rio, yet somehow moving in ways that made her ache for her touch. She was desperately devouring the other woman, keeping her pinned and not letting her move from under her grasp.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She knew it was weird, watching a professor making out with a stranger in a back alley in the middle of the street. But there was something that felt so right. So good it made Rio want it all to last forever.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio exhaled through her nose, the arousal in her body making her feel like she was on the verge of exploding, when Agatha finally leaned her head backward, lifting her lips from the woman’s neck.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stepped back into the shadows, trying to conceal herself away from the broken twinkling streetlight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The professor made a low, animalistic sound, almost like a growl. And then, her teeth: sharp, gleaming fangs. Canines, impossibly long.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With eyes wide open, Rio watched as Agatha sunk them into the woman’s neck.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her hand flew to cover her mouth to smother her surprised gasp.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rationally speaking, the next logical move would’ve been to run away and call the police. Or animal control. Or both, probably.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But logic had clearly abandoned Rio’s brain by then, because she didn’t move. Not one inch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She was terrified, and yet… And the warmth in her body was only increasing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Okay, maybe it wasn’t warmth. Maybe she was very explicitly
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       turned on
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She looked away for a beat, but her eyes kept drifting to the professor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s mouth was still latched onto the woman’s neck, sucking, hungry hums of pleasure filling the air. A few moans escaped from the woman’s lips—not of pain, but satisfaction. It lasted only a few seconds, but to Rio it felt like an eternity.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Once she was satisfied, Agatha stepped away and held the woman’s face by her chin, licking her lower lip.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Fuck, that's hot
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , Rio thought.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha said something then, her voice low and commanding, her eyes intensely staring into the woman’s.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “...Forget everything you saw and …” was all Rio could make out, the rest of it dying as a whisper.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Automatically, and moving like she was a robot, the woman walked away. She brushed past Rio, but didn’t even glance her way once. Like she was hypnotized.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before Agatha could turn around and catch her stalking like a creep, Rio slipped back into the bar through the door. She rested her back against it once she was safe inside, her breathing agitated, her chest heaving rapidly up and down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was true. It was real.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Everything she’d read, everything she’d been made to think was just a girl’s fantasy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Real.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And professor Agatha Harkness was one of
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       them
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As if she could somehow read her thoughts, Rio’s phone vibrated in the back pocket of her jeans.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After Rio’s polite
     </span>
     <em>

     <span>

     </span>

     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t know what the hell she was doing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had a presentation due the following day, and she hadn’t even started writing it. Because whenever she’d tried to that day, her mind kept drifting back to blue eyes, messy waves, and blood-stained lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She’d tried coming up with logical explanations for what she’d seen the night before, but none of them satisfied her. She hadn’t even told Jen about what she’d witnessed. How could she, when she couldn’t make sense of it herself?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And yet, despite all the unanswered questions and the ever-present sense of danger she felt, she was still walking around campus at night, heading straight into the wolf’s mouth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she neared Agatha’s office, her hand slipped into her back pocket, feeling the smooth skin of the fully peeled onion she’d stashed there. It felt stupid, but she would take all the protection she could get.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Rio found herself in front of the closed door, the number 69 barely visible in the darkness, her hand froze mid-knock. She knew, deep down, that once she stepped inside there was a good chance she wouldn’t come out the other side alive. This was her one chance to escape, to turn around and run back into her room and pretend this entire ordeal had never happened in the first place.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alas, she had never been one to walk away from a mystery.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The second her fist knocked on the wooden door, she heard Agatha’s voice calling from inside.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come in.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Squaring her shoulders, Rio pushed the door open and walked in, her entire body taut even as she tried to arrange her features into a somewhat calm expression.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Just like in their first meeting, Agatha was sitting behind her desk. The top buttons of her dark shirt were undone, and Rio had to force her eyes away. Her waves were trapped in a messy bun, but strands of it still managed to escape and fall onto her face, framing it in a way that was entirely unfair.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Remember: vampire. Danger. Not hot
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had to snap back to reality and ignore the twist in her lower belly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She shut the door behind her and, without waiting for an invitation, sat down on the empty chair across from Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hi, professor— Agatha,” she said, correcting herself. The sound of the name slipping from her lips sent a wave of heat through her chest, and she could’ve sworn she caught Agatha’s eyes going darker at the sound.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nodded with a smile, leaning back in her chair. “Hello, Rio.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Folding her hands neatly on her lap, Rio waited.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And waited.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And waited.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Of course Agatha would make her work for it. Not even acknowledging that
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       she
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ’d been the one to summon her there.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, why am I here?” she said, mirroring the professor’s movements and leaning away, putting some more distance between them. Just as a precaution.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a laugh, Agatha tilted her head to the side, like she found the question amusing. “I don’t know, Rio.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Why
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      are you here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio frowned.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       What
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ? “You told me to—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I told you to come, and you came,” Agatha interrupted. Her smile had turned deeper, almost wicked. As if the mere idea that Rio had done exactly what she’d told her to was profoundly satisfying to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow. It was only fitting for Agatha to get off on people following her orders.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Under any other circumstances, Rio would’ve found it extremely hot. Considering her life was hanging by a thread, her attraction was mixed with a sense of dread she couldn’t shake.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What did you find?” she asked, purposefully ignoring the sexual innuendo in Agatha’s words.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha dragged her chair closer to her desk, her hands shuffling through the stacks of paper sitting there until she found what she was looking for. Without saying a word, she slid the piece of paper across the table for Rio to see.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was… a wall. A stone wall, visibly old and weathered. Covered in symbols that looked like ancient graffiti and made no sense to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What is this supposed to be?” she asked, her eyes flicking between the image and the unreadable expression on Agatha’s face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Agatha wasn't even glancing back at the evidence. She was watching Rio, focused and intense. Like she didn’t really care about the evidence. Like she only cared about Rio, and her reaction.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Those,” Agatha said, leaning forward, one of her fingers tracing the lines of the symbols, “are runes. Used in ancient Germanic languages as a sort of alphabet.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio couldn’t look away. Not because she was particularly interested in old, dead languages, but because Agatha’s fingers were long and slender, her nails short. She couldn’t fight the very inappropriate thoughts that popped up in her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       She’s a vampire, Rio. She’ll kill you, Rio
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , she kept reminding herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But deep down, she thought she wouldn’t mind being murdered by such a gorgeous creature.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And? What do they mean?” she asked, forcing her eyes to stay on the paper.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When a few seconds passed and Agatha didn’t reply, Rio teared her eyes from the page, looking up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha was staring right at her again, seemingly transfixed by something only she could see.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Shit, maybe I have something on my face
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , Rio thought, raising a hand to touch her cheek and check. She couldn’t find anything. But Agatha’s eyes would not leave her face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      No, not her face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her neck, bare and exposed by the over-sized shirt she was wearing. Her pulse fluttered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha?” she asked, her body tensing up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was enough to snap Agatha out of her trance. She blinked, her eyes lifting to meet hers. “Yes, sorry. What were you saying, love?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio couldn’t focus back on the runes. Not with her mind racing, trying to figure out an escape, a way to keep Agatha distracted long enough so she could escape.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Because it was clear she was hungry.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And Rio was her obvious prey.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Where were you last night?” Rio asked, leaning back again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s brow furrowed. “Here, in my office. Why?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t lie to me, Agatha,” Rio replied, a fake confident smile on her face. “I saw you at the bar just outside campus.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smiled, too, but there was a lingering hint of threat in it. “So you’ve been keeping an eye on me,” she said, slowly standing up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She circled around her desk until she was standing in front of Rio, just like she had done during their first encounter. Except this time it looked like a dance, like a predator circling its victim.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Should I be flattered, or concerned?” Agatha added, her lower back resting against the side of the desk, closer now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s self-preservation alarms were sounding off, yelling at her to get the hell out. To escape while she still could. And she was trying, she really was, to focus on the task at hand: gathering information, maybe throwing an onion to the professor’s face, and running away to look for the police.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And yet her eyes couldn’t leave Agatha’s, her pupils now blown wide, the blue in her eyes engulfed by a deeper darkness that screamed
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       danger
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio couldn’t leave without a confession.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She needed the truth, and she needed to see it for herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She stood up, deliberately tugging her own shirt down and casually brushing her hair to one side, exposing even more of the skin on her neck to the professor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Probably a bit of both,” she murmured, stepping closer into Agatha’s space.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The air in the room seemed to shift, to become thicker. Agatha’s dark eyes were once again focused on Rio’s neck, her tongue darting out to wet her lower lip.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If Rio had been a normal, sane human being, she would’ve felt scared. Terrified, even. She was standing right in front of a non-human being who could probably tear her head from the rest of her body in a matter of seconds, who could kill her before she even had time to blink.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio Vidal was definitely not sane.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Screw the plan
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And she meant that literally.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Because all she could feel was the heat gathering in her lower belly, the flush in her cheeks, the electricity buzzing through her body, every single inch of her skin begging to touch Agatha’s. Her fingers trembling with the need to graze the woman’s lower lip, gone dark red because of how hard she was biting it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Their breaths mingled—hers warm, Agatha’s cool.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha raised a hand then, holding it still but dangerously close to Rio’s jawline.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This was her time to react.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       are
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      you, professor Harkness?” Rio whispered, dreading the answer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Without tearing her eyes from her neck, Agatha replied, “What do you think?” in a low, almost pained, voice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s body was on the verge of shutting down, her arousal mixing with the excitement of being so close to the creature she had spent her childhood dreaming about.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I think the way your eyes just turned blood-red is pretty telling,” she replied.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She wasn’t exaggerating. The blue in Agatha’s eyes was long gone, replaced by a dark, intense red, the veins around them blooming just beneath the surface of her pale skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Like she was seconds away from losing control.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And it was
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       so goddamn hot
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Suddenly, as if a switch had been flipped, Agatha snapped her head back. Her eyes returned to their normal color.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You should leave, Rio,” she muttered, her chest heaving up and down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio couldn’t. Not when she was so close.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It was you, wasn’t it? Attacking those students?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looked down at the floor. “I didn’t… I didn’t mean to actually hurt them,” the woman started, and she sounded sincere.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You could’ve killed them,” Rio said harshly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, Rio,” Agatha replied, looking up to meet her eyes. “I never kill. If I did, I’d run out of food so fast I’d be starving in a month.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She smiled quickly, but Rio saw right through her. Agatha was playing it off, acting like she didn’t care about what she’d done, about what she was. But underneath that facade, Rio could sense the guilt.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She took a step closer, closing the space between them, trapping the older woman between her body and her desk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha exhaled. “Please, leave. I’m hungry, and I
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       will
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      hurt you if you stay.” Her tone was almost pleading.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t think you want to hurt me, though,” Rio said. And she meant it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No.” Agatha raised her hand to Rio’s face, fixing a strand of hair behind her ear. Rio didn’t flinch. “But I may not be able to resist it. Self-control is not my strong suit.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They stood quietly for a second, Agatha’s hand lingering near Rio’s cheek.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Bite me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The words slipped from Rio’s lips before she could think them through. The idea had been dancing in the back of her mind since she stepped into the office that night, the request the thing that had been keeping her there, stopping her from escaping.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha blinked at her like she was an alien. “What?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This was her chance, her opportunity to take it back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Except she didn’t want to.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She wanted to feel Agatha’s lips on her skin, wanted to help her ease her hunger, to know what it felt like to be the one thing she craved, what she needed to survive.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Bite me,” she repeated, her voice clearer this time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffed, lowering her hand and looking away. “You don’t know what you’re asking.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes, I do,” Rio replied, enunciating each word with strength. “I’m asking you to bite me,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       professor
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She laced the last word with every ounce of charm she could muster, hoping it would be enough to break her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You should be running from me,” Agatha said then. But the way her eyes raked over Rio’s figure betrayed her true thoughts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She was looking her up and down like she was the most delicious thing she’d ever tasted. And Rio was more than ready to prove her right.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You don’t scare me,” she said softly, inching her lips closer to Agatha’s ear.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha bit her lower lip again, an act of restraint that was clearly failing. “Then you’re not paying attention.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smiled, rising to the tip of her toes so that her lips slightly brushed the skin of Agatha’s earlobe. “Make me,” she said, her voice dropping to a whisper, her stomach turning and somersaulting as the words left her mouth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s hand shot to Rio’s jaw, pulling her back and forcing her to meet her gaze, her thumb digging into the skin beneath her lip.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It would’ve been terrifying had it not been for how hot it actually was. Rio was beginning to think her knees might give out at any time, turning her into a mess of a puddle, melted by the sheer intensity of Agatha’s stare.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio,” she said, her voice thick, her tone a warning. “I might not be able to stop.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I trust you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You barely even know me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes. Now, are you going to bite me or do you need me to slice my neck open for you?” she pressed, trying to free herself from Agatha’s grasp.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She failed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha did not let go, but she didn’t lean in either. Instead, she waited, like she was giving Rio a chance to turn away, like she was expecting her to.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So, she figured she had to take matters into her own hands.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio jerked her head deeper within Agatha’s grasp until the woman’s thumb was resting on the skin of her bottom lip. Then, without breaking eye contact, Rio opened her mouth, capturing the finger between her teeth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t move.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio took it as a sign to keep going.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She closed her lips around Agatha’s thumb. Agatha’s grip softened, her finger pressing gently further into Rio’s mouth, urging her forward.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was happy to obey.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She sucked the finger in her mouth, her tongue wrapping around it, her cheeks hollowing with each deliberate stroke. It was intoxicating, the taste of Agatha’s skin in her mouth, the pressure of her hand keeping her head in place.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio thought she had never been more wet, and that was just out of sucking Agatha’s finger. She was pretty sure she would combust when the woman finally bit her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a loud pop, Rio leaned her head back, releasing Agatha’s thumb.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s lips were parted, her breathing faintly rushed. All Rio wanted to do was kiss her right there and then, to let the woman do whatever she wanted with her body, to let her have all of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tell me to stop,” Agatha murmured.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her eyes had turned bloodshot red again, and from the non-existent distance separating them, Rio could see how her canines turned bigger and sharper until they no longer looked like human teeth. They were fangs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio felt no fear. All her body could focus on was how turned on she was, how pathetically wet she already was for this woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Please, Agatha,” Rio said under her breath. She wasn’t above begging. Not when she was so close to getting what she wanted. “Bite me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This time, Agatha didn’t hesitate.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She placed both her hands on Rio’s hips and pushed her until she was the one trapped against the desk. Rio grabbed onto the woman’s shoulder to steady herself, gasping at the sudden switch of position.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha traced two fingers along Rio’s jawline, her cold skin sending shivers down Rio’s spine. She kept moving along her chin, then down her neck, the pads of her fingers stopping right above Rio’s jugular vein, pressing until she could feel the pulsing beneath. Her other hand was still on Rio’s waist, holding her in place, keeping her locked right under her body.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The woman wasn’t waiting for consent. She’d already gotten it, and very explicitly. All the waiting, the stalling. She was savoring the moment, clearly enjoying Rio’s submission, judging by the way her lips curled into a sly, satisfied smile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then, like she was unable to fight it, Agatha’s head snapped back, only to sink back into the crook of Rio’s neck a moment later.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She didn’t feel it at first, the sting. Her mind was a blur, and all she could think about was the feeling of Agatha’s body pressing harder against her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But then, the pain was sharp and deep. She could feel Agatha’s fangs tearing the thin skin on her neck and sinking deeper, her sucking, her lips closing around the wound.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It hurt, and yet Rio didn’t want to move away. Somehow, pain and pleasure had mixed together, pushing her further toward the edge.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A low moan escaped from her lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s hand dug deeper into her waist, her finger pinning her, her own hips crashing against Rio’s. Agatha groaned against her throat, sucking harder, marking her skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was pathetic, how close Rio was to coming.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Slowly, Agatha released her neck. Her tongue darted out to lick the drops of blood around the wounded skin, soothing the pain. When she finally looked at Rio, she seemed shy. Embarrassed, even.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was blood dripping from her bottom lip, her entire mouth stained, the red in her eyes fading and giving way to its usual ocean blue.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had never looked hotter, Rio thought.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you okay?” Agatha muttered, her gaze searching in Rio’s eyes for a sign of regret, a reprimand even.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio couldn’t think. It was as if she’d forgotten how languages worked, how to pick and choose the words she needed to express a thought, and how to pronounce them. The only coherent thought in her mind was that she could almost feel how turned on she was already.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Dropping her hand from Agatha’s shoulder to graze her arm, she exhaled. “I’m fine,” she said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The worried look wouldn’t leave Agatha’s face. “Are you sure? I can take you to the hospital—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t catch the rest of that sentence. She leaned in until her lips collapsed against Agatha’s, the only way she could find to shut the professor up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha responded immediately, her mouth chasing Rio’s, devouring her. It was a dance, Rio’s lips parting, Agatha’s tongue pushing into her mouth, gently grazing the soft skin of her lips. They moved in feral synchronicity, their bodies pressed flush together until Rio’s back slammed against the edge of the desk again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sank her now-human teeth into Rio’s bottom lip, tugging it with deliberate care until she was able to elicit a moan from the younger woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ve been thinking about this from the moment you first walked out of my office,” Agatha whispered once she had released Rio’s lip. “Your lips, your scent, your taste.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio felt her knees go weak at the thought of Agatha wanting her so badly. It lit a rare confidence in her chest, so unfamiliar she didn’t quite know what to do with it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Have you, now?” Rio replied, unable to shake the smirk off her face. “Lucky I’m here for you to taste, then.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffed, like she found Rio’s teasing amusing. “We shouldn’t, Rio. I’m a professor, you’re a student.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not your student, though,” Rio shot back, desperate enough to scream if Agatha didn’t touch her within the next ten seconds. “I’m twenty-seven and you’re what? Forty, at most? Wait, you could be like a hundred years old, right?” she said, her eyes wide open with excitement at the idea.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Excuse you, I look thirty-eight, you disrespectful little shit” Agatha exclaimed, feigning offense through her smile. “And second, yes, I could be a hundred years old.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before Rio could counter with even more questions—the supernatural nerd in her peaked with curiosity—, Agatha placed her hands at the sides of Rio’s thighs, tracing the curve of her ass through the fabric of her pants. “Is this okay?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes,” Rio replied, rolling her eyes. Hadn’t she made it clear enough how badly she wanted this woman to fuck her?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But then, Agatha’s hands were directly on her ass, grabbing at the skin there to lift her up and make her sit on the edge of the desk. Rio felt something pressing against her, but tried to ignore the discomfort. Agatha, however, took a step back, a confused frown on her face. She dug her hand into Rio’s back pocket, fishing something out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What the fuck is this?” she asked, holding the thing out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio blushed, remembering her original plan to take the vampire out, not be seduced by her. “An onion,” she murmured. “It was meant for protection, but I’m guessing that’s a myth.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha laughed, throwing it behind her without looking. “God, you’re cute.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Cute enough that you’ll eat me out?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha stepped closer, placing her body in between Rio’s legs, parting them open with her hands with almost no force. Rio was willing to do whatever it took to get that woman’s mouth and fingers on her cunt.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that what you want?” Agatha murmured, one of her hands grazing over the button of Rio’s pants, playing with it without undoing it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Even the thought of the professor’s hand so close to where she needed it most made her head go dizzy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes, please, Agatha,” she managed to reply.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, then, if you ask so nicely…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With almost superhuman speed—which was completely possible, Rio reminded herself—, Agatha undid the button and zipper on her pants, tugging them down Rio’s legs until she was sitting on the desk in her underwear, her skin faintly trembling on the cold wooden surface.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha tilted her head, her eyes now focused on Rio’s center, staring like she might be able to make her come if she stared with enough intensity. Given how sensitive Rio already was, it was plausible.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fuck, Rio, you’re so wet you’ve ruined your underwear”. Agatha’s voice was thick with want, her pupils blown wide. “All of this just because I bit you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had the same look she’d had before biting Rio’s neck: pure, complete hunger.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha trailed her fingers around Rio’s thighs, her pale skin contrasting against Rio’s more tanned look. Pressing gently into the inner part of her legs, Agatha hummed with pleasure when Rio squirmed under her touch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mh, you’re sensitive,” the woman noted, her fingers trailing closer to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Stop talking and fuck me before I find a stake and drive it through your heart,” Rio muttered through her teeth, the desire pooling in her lower belly making it impossible for her to think straight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So feisty,” Agatha replied, her movements still painfully slow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Finally, the professor hooked her fingers around Rio’s underwear, tugging it down her legs. Rio lifted herself off the desk to make it easier, faster, knowing she couldn’t take the teasing for much longer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha threw the curled-up ball of fabric to the side, her lips parting as she watched Rio intently. With the tip of her finger, she traced figures on Rio’s skin, digging onto the soft skin, making her way through her and stopping above Rio’s exposed center.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With her finger lingering there, Agatha’s spare hand wrapped around Rio’s waist, pulling her closer to the edge of the desk, closer to her own body. “I’m gonna need you to keep that pretty mouth of yours shut, okay?” Agatha said. “We’re still on campus property, and this very much goes against university rules.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Something in her tone warned Rio that going against her orders would not end well for her. She nodded in agreement enthusiastically, the eagerness to be touched by the most beautiful woman she’d even seen making her giddy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha seemed pleased with her reaction, and she finally slid a single finger along her folds, teasingly playing with her pubes, her dark blue eyes never once leaving Rio’s face, wanting to watch her response. She added a second finger, gathering the slickness in them and rubbing it on her. Rio could actually
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       hear
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      how wet she was, and the arousal bubbling in her lower belly grew stronger, making her entire body buzz with anticipation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After teasing her entrance, drawing tight circles around it, Agatha finally slipped both fingers inside of her with pathetic ease thanks to how soaked Rio was already. She started out slow, only picking up the pace when Rio’s breathing became ragged, Agatha’s lips pressing against hers to prevent her from making any noises, swallowing her moans.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha leaned her head back, and Rio couldn’t resist chasing after her, her lips complaining at the sudden loss of contact.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Where are you going?” Rio whispered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smiled smugly. “Didn’t you want my mouth somewhere else?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio couldn’t nod fast enough. “Yes, yes, please.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The older woman laughed, amused with Rio’s eagerness.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Without another word, Agatha sank to the floor on her knees, her face at eye-level with Rio’s throbbing cunt. Rio leaned forward, her hands spread out behind her to keep herself steady, her eyes locking with Agatha’s as she looked up at her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had never seen something so gorgeous. Professor Agatha Harkness, probably-ancient vampire, on her knees in her office for a postgraduate student. She took a mental picture for later use.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Smirking, Agatha leaned against her, her tongue slowly licking long stripes along Rio’s folds. The woman hummed against her, the vibration sending ripples down her spine and quickening her pulse
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s tongue didn’t stop moving for a second, circling around Rio’s entrance before dragging upward to gently tease her clit, lapping over it until Rio had to bite her own hand to prevent herself from screaming out in pleasure.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Good boy,” Agatha mumbled against her skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was something in those two words put together, and coming out from Agatha’s lips, that made her wish she could keep hearing them all the time until the end of her days.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wrapped her lips around Rio’s clit, then lower, her nose grazing the sensitive bundle of nerves as her tongue slipped into her. Rio’s hand flew to Agatha’s hair, her fingers digging into her bun, her nails scraping her scalp, both searching for balance and urging her deeper into her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The professor tilted her head back under Rio’s hand, searching for a very much needed breath, judging by her accelerated exhales and the way her chest was heaving up and down. “You taste
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       so
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      good, Rio,” she said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t even have a chance to come up with an appropriate response, because Agatha’s mouth was once again around her clit, and she’d thrust two fingers inside of her at the same time, picking up her rhythm, helping Rio chase her orgasm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It didn’t take long, Rio’s hips jerking frantically, her head thrown back, her back arched, spasms coursing through her as Agatha’s mouth slowed its pace, helping her ride her climax. Rio was biting her own spare hand with such strength she was afraid she’d draw blood and trigger Agatha’s bloodlust.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But the woman was too focused on Rio’s pussy, her tongue drinking up her juices as if they tasted even better than blood.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha stood like that, kneeled with her face buried deep against Rio, until the younger woman stopped moving, finally resting her exhausted body on the desk, her head hitting the wood with a soft thud. Once she calmed down, Agatha gently removed her fingers from inside her and stood up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio sat up straight again, her body now aching for more, for a taste of Agatha herself, for her skin under her own fingertips. When she watched Agatha lick her lips—licking Rio’s wetness—she surged forward, expecting to be met with Agatha’s lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Agatha leaned back, putting some distance between them. Rio frowned, but the professor was smiling.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not so fast, sweet girl. It’s late, and I think that’s enough
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Interview with the vampire
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      for you today,” Agatha said.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Rio began to pout in response, Agatha tutted. “You’ve just discovered vampires are real, had liters of blood drained from you, then had mind blowing sex with me.” Rio didn’t even try to argue with her about that last part. “You should get some rest, clear your head. I’ll still be here tomorrow, and the day after that, and so on for all eternity.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha laughed when she said that, but it reminded Rio of where she was, what she was doing, what she’d come there to do.

      “Right,” she murmured, jumping from the desk to stand up.

      “Thank you for not running away screaming—” Agatha started, but Rio cut her off.

      The worst part was she’d asked for it. She’d had countless opportunities to back down, to leave. She knew Agatha would’ve let her walk out the door with no consequences.
