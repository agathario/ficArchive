<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio Vidal’s first year of teaching elementary school comes with many challenges - challenges that she believes she is well prepared for, or at the very least, able to manage on the sly (or in the worst case scenario, be able to ask her teaching mentor): rowdy students, helicopter parents, classroom management - what have you.</p><p>This, however, she’s woefully unprepared for.</p><p>Her degree program did not meet this requirement; no training covered this either. She does not know what protocol dictates; her colleagues don’t have the experience either.</p><p>For you see, a first grade teacher shouldn’t have to attend the funeral of one of her sweet, sweet little students: Nicholas Harkness.</p><p>--<br/>OR: First year elementary school teacher Rio Vidal falls in love with one of the parents of students as a medical diagnosis turns all their lives upside down.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“You had the <em> whole </em> day to do this,” Alice grumbles, daring to stand on her tiptoes on the plastic student chair to better lift and straighten the green paper border of the pinboard - one of three that still needed to be decorated before tomorrow’s start of the school year. “ <em> How </em> are you so <em> behind </em>? Ah, there! How’s it look?” </p><p> </p><p>From the opposite side of the classroom, Rio tilts her head and wrinkles her nose, inspecting the newly framed pinboard. “I don’t know if it’s <em> completely </em> straight,” she comments, mostly in jest. </p><p> </p><p>“What do <em> you </em> know about straight?” Alice retorts back, hopping down from the chair.</p><p> </p><p>“Just about as much as you,” Rio quips back as Alice crosses the room to inspect the work as well. “Thank you for coming to help out - best roommate ever.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice snorts as she leans against the wall with her arms folded over her chest, “Don’t try to talk me up, Vidal - I’m already here and I’m not going anywhere. Plus, I know you’d do the same if, you know, I was forced to decorate my own highschool classroom. I could never do elementary..”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> I </em> don’t think I could ever do high school,” Rio replies in earnest. She barely tolerated the experience the first time around. She couldn’t imagine having another go at it. “I’m also your ride back to the apartment, so you can’t go anywhere even if you wanted to.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs a dark green poster board from the small pile spread across a group of four student desks. The room is filled with 24 of them. <em> Twenty-four </em>, she’s counted an embarrassing amount of times, as if each count could numb her to that fact. 24 empty desks that tomorrow morning - bright and early - would be filled with 24 students.</p><p> </p><p>She isn’t a stranger to a classroom. Her student teaching went swimmingly well, but from tomorrow on, she will be a <em> teacher </em> teacher. No safety net. It would be all on her. She will be the adult in the room with <em> twenty freaking four </em> children that belonged to <em> families </em> that <em> cared </em> about them and that will <em> entrust </em> Rio with them.</p><p> </p><p>The thought sits as a nervous pit in her stomach, one that has been present for the last few weeks for one reason or another - mostly work related.</p><p> </p><p><em> Mostly </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Well, Rio guesses one could argue it was all work related, just not all related to the same job. </p><p> </p><p>After graduating at the beginning of the summer season, Rio gifted herself a trip backpacking through different countries in Latin America, one that brought her many cherished memories and, well, a considerable amount of debt that would not wait for her first teaching paycheck that she knew would be abysmal. </p><p> </p><p>So, she applied - and was hired - at one of the local lgbt+ cafes that doubled as a bar during the evening hours. The range of shifts also meant she could maybe balance it with the teaching, or that is what Rio hopes, anyway. It would be a shame to give it up so soon, especially when she needs the money.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe it would also be a shame to give up seeing one of her morning regulars: a dark-haired woman always impeccably dressed with the most piercing blue eyes who refuses to give up her name. The first time Rio asked for it to scribble on the cup, the woman simply replied, “No.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s interest had been piqued. Not to mention, watching the woman smirk as Rio <em> actually </em> did call out “No” in a crowded morning cafe did make Rio rather proud of herself. The confusion from the other customers had been worth it.</p><p> </p><p>The order itself is simple enough - one that Rio memorized right away: four shots of espresso with a splash of oat milk (Rio doesn’t judge the amount of caffeine consumption among her customers, not when her tips relied on said caffeine). She could easily have it made before the woman reached the counter, but what fun would that be? She’d miss out on all the not-her-actual-names that Rio kept asking for.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> In a hurry.” </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You think you’re funny.”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “This is ridiculous.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> “ </em> You’re <em> ridiculous.”  </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> “That witch.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Scratchy.”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> “Señor Scratchy.” </em> Rio commented on the lack of originality and then was impressed the woman didn’t jump the counter to strangle her. Her glare had revealed that intention to Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Yesterday was Rio’s last day until the following Saturday. Jen, the owner, gave her the time off so she could adjust to her teaching schedule. They would meet before her next shift to determine what her shifts would look like in the future.</p><p> </p><p>So, this also meant that yesterday would be the last day Rio could see this mystery woman until next week. Rio didn’t wait for her to reach the counter to put in her order. Instead, it was ready when she approached. Rio didn’t write down a name - she didn’t have one to write.</p><p> </p><p>In its usual place, Rio wrote down her number. The woman paused when she saw it, making Rio’s heart drop. Rio couldn’t read her, but there was no emotion conveyed to be read - a complete neutral expression. </p><p> </p><p>But Rio couldn’t help but smile when she realized that this woman left her double the amount of tip than usual. Whether it was for the impeccable service or the number, the verdict was out. She hoped it was a bit of both.</p><p> </p><p>Well, a bit more of one than the other, if Rio were to be completely truthful with herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was met with the first text when she woke up today. <em> That </em> adrenaline rush was better than any cup of coffee she’s ever drank.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Missed you this morning. Coffee was burnt. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh, I’ll let Jen know the roaster’s on the fritz. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> Personally, I think it’s the lack of a beautiful barista </em>.</p><p> </p><p>The text throughout the day. It distracts Rio from the self imposed task she reserved for this Sunday: finish decorating her new classroom at Westview Elementary. By sundown, she realizes she needs to call in reinforcements - hence Alice currently helping her cover the last bulletin board with the dark green poster board. </p><p> </p><p>“Plus, considering your track record with setting your classroom on fire, it’s probably for the best there’s less inflammable objects in that science lab,” Rio comments, taping the last of the poster boards in place.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Listen </em> , it <em> wasn’t </em> the classroom - it was just my grade book,” Alice defends herself with a huff. “And it only happened twice! Also, I should really get credit for ensuring the district’s fire extinguishers are not expired.” </p><p> </p><p>“It shouldn’t have happened once!”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t try to stifle young science innovation, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“And who still uses a physical grade book anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“You know, I don’t think the walk to the apartment is actually that long.” </p><p> </p><p>“No, no, no, I’m sorry!” Rio apologizes, looking over her shoulder towards Alice who was staring back at her with her hands on her hips. “Those freshmen love you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Those freshmen are budding arsonists - do you know how easy it is to turn a bunsen burner into a flamethrower?” Alice asks. </p><p> </p><p>Rio bites back the comment she wants to make, that Alice is probably the one who showed them all how to do it. Sensing the thin line she’s already walking, Rio, instead, gestures towards the canvas bag on her desk at the front of the room. “The stuff for the welcoming board is in there,” she directs.</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, a <em> welcoming board </em> , how elementary,” Alice groans, dragging herself over to the desk. “I could <em> never </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s going to be a flower vase,” Rio continues, knowing it would further Alice’s displeasure. “They’ll make flower petals tomorrow - paper cut outs of their hands. Ain’t that <em> cute </em>? What are you doing tomorrow?”</p><p> </p><p>“Setting my grade book on fire,” Alice answers nonchalantly. “Gotta start my third year memorably, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Alice </em>.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, a Señor Scratchy is texting you?” Alice says with a hint of confusion, making Rio immediately turn around toward the other woman hovering over her desk with the canvas bag in hand. Rio left her phone next to it, apparently (honestly, she had lost track of it). “They wanna know if they’re seeing you tomorrow morning? Who the hell is Señor Scratchy?” </p><p> </p><p>In the blink of an eye, Rio is at her desk and snatching her phone to tuck away into her back pocket. She will text back later, explaining that her next shift isn’t until the weekend. “That’s.. It’s - she’s,” she struggles, grabbing the canvas bag from Alice. </p><p> </p><p>The stutter is enough for Alice to piece the pieces together. After all, Rio had informed her of yesterday’s plan. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, my <em> god </em> , is that <em> the </em> mystery woman from the cafe?” Alice asks. She adds after a beat, “Oh, my god, is that why you’re behind with this decorating? <em> Rio </em>. Spill.” </p><p> </p><p>“Please, shut up and help me,” Rio begs. She walks back over to the board and sets the canvas bag on the floor before fishing out the necessary materials to create the craft she envisioned (or, rather, stole from one of the first year teacher social media accounts she had mass followed).</p><p> </p><p>Alice follows at her heels, “I’ll help if you tell me <em> everything </em>. What’s her name?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio admits, handing her the pieces of construction paper they would soon structure into a 2-D vase.</p><p> </p><p>“You <em> still </em> don’t know?” Alice gasps in genuine shock. “What do you <em> mean </em> you still don’t know-” </p><p> </p><p>“There seems to be a lot of commotion in here for school after hours.”</p><p> </p><p>The sudden new voice causes both of them to jump. In said commotion, both failed to hear the footsteps coming up the hallway and pausing outside the open doorway to Rio’s classroom. The older woman leans against the doorframe. How long had she been standing there? How much did she hear?</p><p> </p><p>Rio would never get those answers; she didn’t want to ask.</p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Calderu,” Rio says, breathless, as she pulls herself up onto her feet. “I’m sorry, we didn’t mean-” </p><p> </p><p>“Rio, you <em> are </em> allowed to address me by my first name now, since we are officially colleagues and all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia,” Rio corrects herself. Her former first grade teacher’s name still feels and sounds very foreign to her. Part of her believes it will never feel natural. The fact that Lilia is <em> also </em> her teaching mentor doesn’t help either. Isn’t that just another student-teacher relationship with more complicated layers? For the record, however, Rio wouldn’t want anyone else as a mentor.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here?” Rio asks.</p><p> </p><p>“My dear, I could ask the same of both of you,” Lilia answers, straightening up. On the day before the  start of the school year, it is a very unnecessary question. All three teachers know why they are here. Well, Lilia probably has to guess why one of the high school science teachers is here, but there’s not enough wonder to earn an actual question. Lilia takes a step inside the classroom, gives it a glance over, and then offers Rio a nod of approval before handing her a sheet of paper.</p><p> </p><p>“What is this?” Rio asks with a frown, giving the sheet a look over. It looked like her classlist - like the one she has on her desk, already printed.</p><p> </p><p>“Your new classlist.”</p><p> </p><p>“My new what?” Rio’s head snaps up. “What do you mean ‘new?’ A new one <em> again </em>?” </p><p> </p><p>Lilia sighs, shoulders falling slightly, as she shakes her head, “Welcome to public education, Rio.. I <em> tried </em> to reason with her, but there is no reasoning with Agatha Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>“With who?” Rio asks, eyebrows furrowing in further confusion. Who is this Agatha Harkness and why should Rio care? Why is she messing with her classlist? </p><p> </p><p>“Her son, Nicholas, was registered in my first grade class,” Lilia explains. “But we both know how <em> that </em>situation went.” </p><p> </p><p>Ah, yes. </p><p> </p><p>At the rather last minute, the new kindergarten teacher decided not to move to Westview. They didn’t even provide a reason, nor did it seem they were going to inform the district either. Admin only reached out when they failed to show up to the mandatory district wide inservice training, leaving Principal Davis to scramble up a back-up plan.</p><p> </p><p>The initial solution involved moving Rio, but Lilia put her foot down. It would be inhumane to do such a thing to a brand new teacher, Lilia defended before offering herself to teach kindergarten - she’s done it before and the prep wouldn’t take her much. The students in her own first grade class were divided among the others, leaving Rio, on top of her new teacher training, and the other first grade teachers to change their classroom set up. </p><p> </p><p>Honestly, it was more preferable than trying to work a whole new grade level curriculum.</p><p> </p><p>“But what does that have to do with this?” Rio asks, waving the classlist. “I thought the kids were divided equally.” </p><p> </p><p>“They were, but.. when Agatha noticed I was no longer her son’s teacher, she demanded to know why, asking how admin could allow just <em> anyone </em> to teach him.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, helicopter parent,” Alice whispered. “Those are the worst.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then why assign him to a literal <em> brand new teacher </em> ?” Rio questions, the panic rising in her voice. She did <em> not </em> need a helicopter parent right out the gate. Couldn’t she get through her first week? Hell, even her first day of school? “The others all have <em> at least </em>five years on me,” she says with more of a whine than she’s proud of. </p><p> </p><p>“Although that is true, I was the one who recommended you, Rio,” Lilia reveals.</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia-!” </p><p> </p><p>“I <em> know </em> you, Rio,” Lilia states. Rio can hear the pride in her voice and she would be lying if she says it didn’t pull on her heartstrings. “How hard you’ve worked and how hard you’ve persevered in life. I <em> know </em> you are going to be a great teacher, especially under <em> my </em> own mentoring.” </p><p> </p><p>A smile tugs on the corners of Rio’s lips. She lowers her head in a poor attempt to hide her blush. “Forever humble as always, Lilia,” she mumbles, shaking her head, but it snaps up immediately when the realization hits her.</p><p> </p><p>Twenty-five.</p><p> </p><p>Not twenty-four.</p><p> </p><p>“I have to find another desk,” she states. “I have to change the room-” </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Alice interrupts. “No, absolutely not. Not again. Just add a fifth desk to one of the groups of four and call it a day. Or night, rather.” </p><p> </p><p>“It won’t be equal!” Rio protests.</p><p> </p><p>“Groups of five,” Lilia says, nodding. “Unfortunately, the desks won’t be even, but you’ll make it work.”</p><p> </p><p>“I thank God everyday I’m not in elementary,” Alice murmurs under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Both Lilia and Rio choose to ignore the comment. </p><p> </p><p>“Wrap up the bulletin board, kiddo, and do call it a night,” Lilia says, finding herself agreeing with Alice. “The room doesn’t have to be perfect, but <em> you </em> should be well-rested.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio gives the classroom one more glance over, already planning how to rearrange the desks, which she will tackle in the morning. “Honestly, I think I’m too nervous to sleep,” she admits.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia can’t help but smile. “I will let you in on a little secret - one veteran teacher to a new one: you will <em> always </em> be nervous about the first day of school. The nerves prove that you care.” </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>As predicted, sleep evades Rio for most of the night, leaving her staring up at her ceiling for much longer than she cares to admit. She manages maybe a couple of hours, but not enough to classify herself as ‘rested,’ let alone ‘well rested.’</p><p> </p><p>She gets to school early. It’s enough time to put up the finishing touches of the decorations, an attempt to really pull the overall theme of plants and growth together to match with their first science unit. She’ll change it as they proceed with their units, but for now it was.. mostly perfect. A part of her wants to set up a line of plants along the window seals.</p><p> </p><p>Then again, Rio would find any possible reason to buy herself new plants - debt be damned.</p><p> </p><p>She manages to finish rearranging the desks and creating Nicholas’ nametag to tap on his own just a few minutes before the twenty-five children walked into their new classroom, toting along backpacks that were far too big for their little bodies. </p><p> </p><p>Rio watches them and offers them her best, welcoming smile as her heart flutters both in excitement and a bit of anxiety. This is the moment - <em> the moment </em> - she worked towards for four years. Longer, technically. She knew for a while that she wanted to be in education - especially elementary.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia Calderu had been her driving force for it, too. </p><p><br/>
She owes a lot to Lilia, but Rio refuses to think about it now. She needs to concentrate on this day; she needs to concentrate on these students.</p><p> </p><p>They take the time to go over introductions - each and every one of them. All twenty-six of them, Rio included. They tell her what they are most excited about; they share what their summers were like. Rio shares pictures of her own summer adventures - mostly pictures from Amazonia. It’s a good transition into the start of their plants unit.</p><p> </p><p>But not all the transitions were.. decent. Lilia says it’ll come with practice and that sometimes there just isn’t a good way to switch subjects. It reassures her.</p><p> </p><p>And honestly, the day goes by in a blurr. </p><p> </p><p>Before she knows it, the final bell rings and they say their goodbyes. Whereas the majority of them immediately head towards the door with shouts of ‘bye Ms. Vidal,’ a few linger behind to give her hugs.</p><p> </p><p>One child doesn’t move from his desk, Rio realizes when she turns away from the classroom door.</p><p> </p><p>With a smile, Rio crosses the room over to him, where he is still sitting. She kneels down next to him, an action that summons his attention. He turns towards her.</p><p> </p><p>“Is everything alright, Nicholas?” she asks.</p><p> </p><p>Nicholas tilts his head slightly, as if pondering the question, before looking back at his name tag - the one that Rio set up just that morning. He taps his finger against his written name. “Can this say ‘Nicky?’” he asks. “No one calls me Nicholas.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Of course it can, Nicky,” Rio answers, purposefully using the preferred name he presents.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama says it’s my nickname,” Nicky explains. “But she uses it way more than my actual name. She calls me ‘Nicholas’ when I get in trouble,” he reveals.</p><p> </p><p>In a slight dramatic fashion, Rio gasps slightly, “You don’t get in trouble often, do you, Nicky?” </p><p> </p><p>He immediately shakes his head. “Nope!” he says proudly. “And Mama says that ‘Nick’ is too grown up. I’m not a grown up yet.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio wrinkles her nose and nods, “I think your mom is right. ‘Nicky’ suits you very well.” </p><p> </p><p>“Do you have a nickname, Ms. Vidal?” </p><p> </p><p>“I mean.. Rio’s already a <em> pretty </em> short name,” she explains, standing up straight. It leads Nicky to stand as well. She helps him sling his backpack over his shoulder. “But sometimes people try to call me ‘Ri.’”</p><p> </p><p>This time it’s Nicky who wrinkles his nose as he looks up towards her. “I like ‘Rio’ better, Ms. Vidal,” he states. </p><p> </p><p>“Me too,” Rio agrees. “I hope you had a good first day today, Nicky. I’ll change your name tag - you’ll have a new one for tomorrow.” </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Ms. Vidal,” he grins. “Did you have a good first day, too?” </p><p> </p><p>Placing her hand on his backpack, Rio begins to gently lead the boy towards the door of the classroom. She can still hear Alice’s comment clearly in her mind: <em> helicopter parent </em>. She didn’t need his mom wondering where in the world her son is. </p><p> </p><p>Before they could reach the door and before Rio could answer Nicky’s question, the door is pulled open. Rio doesn’t know what to expect, but the thought of… <em> her </em> standing there in the entrance to her classroom isn’t in the realm of possibility. </p><p> </p><p>Four Shots of Espresso and Oat Milk - no, wait. No. Señor Scratchy – no.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness steps into her room.</p><p> </p><p>Both women stand with the same frozen expression, one mixed with shock and confusion. Both tried to stand a little straighter, tried to get their bearings after having the wind knocked out of them. In those eyes that made her chest tighten for weeks (not that this moment is any different), Rio catches a hint of.. Amusement?</p><p> </p><p>Nicky throws himself against his mother, wrapping his arms around her middle in a tight hug. “Hi, Mama!” he greets enthusiastically. He pulls away and turns his attention towards Rio. “This is my teacher! Her name is Ms. Vidal!” </p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” Agatha repeats, offering a hand which Rio takes. “It’s nice to.. <em> meet </em> you. Officially.” </p><p> </p><p>“The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Harkness-” </p><p> </p><p>“Ms.,” Agatha corrects. “Or Agatha, I guess. If you prefer.” </p><p> </p><p>“So, it’s no longer Señor Scratchy?” Rio dares to ask, raising an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>From the corner of her eye, Rio sees Nicky frowns in confusion. “Why does Ms. Vidal know our rabbit’s name?”</p><p> </p><p>Immediately, Rio’s eyebrows shoot up as amusement now graces her own features. “You used your rabbit’s name?” she asks, offering Nicky no context. She also wants to ask if they <em> really </em> have a rabbit (as well as to see pictures, but Rio holds back).</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>“You used that, too,” Rio points out. </p><p> </p><p>“Adults are weird,” Nicky murmurs, the conversation now lost on him.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, baby, you have <em> no idea </em>,” Agatha agrees, taking his hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Goodbye, Ms. Vidal! See you tomorrow!” Nicky says, now pulling his mother along. He probably wants to get home to that rabbit of his, Rio notes.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll see you tomorrow, Nicky,” Rio repeats before meeting the other woman’s eye one final time. “Agatha,” she says with a nod.</p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” Agatha replies before stepping out of the classroom.</p><p> </p><p>Rio decides to not change Agatha’s contact information in her phone. Instead, she asks for a picture of the bunny. Agatha only sends an emoji of a rabbit. Rio rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>–</p><p> </p><p>She’s able to sleep better that night. The exhaustion of the first day caught up with her nearly as soon as she crossed the threshold of the apartment she shared with Alice who did not come home until much later. There’s a knock on her bedroom door after she’s collapsed onto her bed nearly immediately after dinner.</p><p> </p><p>“Come in,” Rio groans.</p><p> </p><p>The creaking of the opening door is followed by her roommate’s cackling laugh. The sight of Rio in pajamas planted face first into pillows and limbs spread must be quite the amusing sight? Rio’s too tired to care.</p><p> </p><p>“Long day?” Alice asks.</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels the edge of the foot of her bed sink. She rolls towards the movement, onto her side, so she can meet Alice’s eye. She nods, before adding, “You?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice nods too and then tells her, “Caught that grade book on fire. Already have them eating out of the palm of my hand.” </p><p> </p><p>“You set the fire on purpose?” Rio questions.</p><p> </p><p>“Gotta get them interested somehow,” Alice remarks, shrugging her shoulders. “Give them something to talk about, you know? Might as well be <em> science </em>, right? Anything exciting happening in the land of first grade? How many shoes did you have to tie?” </p><p> </p><p>“Five,” Rio answers, automatically.</p><p> </p><p>“Riveting,” Alice replies. “You know what, though? Honestly, I thought it would be more.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses for a moment, the thought just now crossing her mind. “Me too,” she agrees. She waits another second before revealing, “Señor Scratchy is one of my students’ mom.” </p><p> </p><p>When Alice doesn’t respond right away, Rio forces herself to sit up. She sits just in time to meet Alice’s shout of, “Excuse me, <em> what!? </em> I’m sorry, why didn’t you lead with <em> that </em> ? What does that <em> mean </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>With a groan, Rio throws herself back against the bed. Her back meeting the mattress knocks the wind out of her a little bit. She pulls one of her pillows over face. “I don’t know,” she admits. “Do you think I might’ve pissed off a cosmic entity in a previous life?”</p><p> </p><p>“Have <em> you </em> seen <em> you </em> ?” Alice remarks. “You probably <em> were </em> the cosmic entity and now you have to live among us mere mortals.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t help but snort.</p><p> </p><p>“But, girl, I don’t know either,” Alice admits, referring back to Rio’s question, not that she has the intention to offer a potential solution. “However, this sounds like it’s going to be interesting. What are you going to do?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m too tired to even <em> try </em> to think about it,” Rio says into the pillow. It must’ve muffled her voice because in the next second, it’s pulled from covering her face. Rio lets out an annoyed sigh. “But she knows I’m at the cafe on Saturday.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, didn’t that other first grade teacher quit and abandon her life?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Alice </em>,” Rio warns. “Not funny.” </p><p> </p><p>“Sounds like we’re waiting to see what happens on Saturday then?” </p><p> </p><p>“Why are you invested in this?” </p><p> </p><p>“Rio Vidal, I’m <em> offended </em>. Of course I’ve invested in your happiness,” Alice retorts, standing. “Or the good story that comes out of it that we’ll drink over later.” </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Goodnight </em>, Alice,” Rio huffs. </p><p> </p><p>–</p><p> </p><p>The second day of school, Rio arrives at the standard thirty minutes prior to the first bell of the day with the intention of ironing out the wrinkles of yesterday’s lesson plan, adjusting today’s, and fixing Nicky’s name tag. The name tag is the first thing on her to-do list lest Nicky arrive early to still see his old one. </p><p> </p><p>She peels off the old one with relative ease and just as she finishes taping the new one to the desk, the classroom door opens. Anticipating some students arriving early, Rio takes a half step back when instead she finds Agatha once again in her classroom.</p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Harkness, good-” </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” she corrects and then holds up her to-go cup. “I mean, you know my coffee order. Might as well.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio repeats, nodding. </p><p> </p><p>“I should’ve put it together when my son’s teacher and my barista have the same first name,” Agatha comments. “There can’t be too many ‘Rio’s in Westview. Didn’t expect them to be the same person.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs as she teases, “You probably haven’t had your insane amount of caffeine yet that morning.” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re ridiculous - <em> don’t </em>,” she warns, pointedly, earning herself a laugh from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“What name did you give Jen this morning?” Rio asks, curious.</p><p> </p><p>“One that I probably shouldn’t repeat in an elementary school,” Agatha answers without missing a beat. “Coffee’s still burnt.”</p><p> </p><p>Grinning, Rio doesn’t press, despite being curious. She looks down at the old name tag still in her hands. Agatha’s gaze follows. Rio offers it to her. “In case you’re one of those sentimental parents,” she explains.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes it from her, her touch gentle as she does so, as if its the most precious treasure in the world. The way she looks at it, the warm, genuine smile it gives her.. Rio can’t help but smile herself, too.</p><p> </p><p>She also can’t help but think how beautiful Agatha is.</p><p> </p><p>Catching herself in the middle of the thought, Rio quickly straightens and clears her throat. “Is there anything I can help you with, Agatha?” she asks, remembering that it was the older woman who sought her out in the classroom. “Is Nicky okay?” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, he’s fine,” Agatha instantly replies, now fully present in the moment. She sets her coffee down on a random student’s desk, allowing her to tuck away the name tag into her purse as well as pull out a familiar little ziplock baggie. Rio sent each student home with one, filled with a singular bean just starting to sprout wrapped in a paper towel.</p><p> </p><p>“Homework on day one? Of first grade?” Agatha protests.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tenses. </p><p> </p><p><em> Helicopter parent </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, relax, I’m teasing,” Agatha backtracks. “I know - the science unit. It’s just.. the stem of ours kind of.. Shriveled? I’m not a plant person. I mean. I know what a living plant <em> looks </em> like, but <em> this </em> is not <em> that </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“And <em> I’m </em> the one who needs to relax?” Rio teases right back, reaching out for the bag. She explains it for a moment and then turns towards the window seal. “I have extras just for this situation - let me grab you another one,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>“Was it anything we did?” Agatha asks, following after.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head, “No, sometimes bean sprouts just die.”</p>

<p>
<span>Friday comes around soon enough, much to Rio’s delight (and salvation, not that would openly admit it to any of her colleagues). Though she stresses that she does enjoy the job - because she </span>
<em>
<span>absolutely</span>
</em>
<span> does enjoy the job, she looks forward to this evening’s program of becoming one with the living room couch watching some questionable television with take out from one of her favorite hole in the wall Chinese restaurants.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Student teaching did not prepare her for this utter exhaustion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, that evening is still a few hours away, unfortunately. She still has half a work day to tackle and get through before releasing these munchkins back to their parents for the entirety of the weekend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And, fortunately, her daily break is scheduled right in the middle of the day, giving her a moment to breathe: the coveted prep-hour/break schedule of back-to-back the kids’ lunch and recess, followed by one of their specials classes (music, art, and physical education). Today was physical education, for the second time this week. So far, it’s Rio’s favorite solely because they come back to her after letting nearly all of their energy out with one activity or another.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just a few minutes after the end of the kids’ recess, while they are probably already eagerly dividing themselves into teams with their PE coach in the school gym, there’s a knock against Rio’s propped open classroom door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you eat?” she hears Lilia ask, her voice laced with a slight concern pulling Rio’s attention away from her computer screen and lesson planning for the following week. She doesn’t want to stay after the students leave for the day, not when she has a very desirable date this evening with the sofa and television.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, </span>
<em>
<span>Mom</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio teases, smirking ever so lightly. It earns her a soft, affectionate eye roll from Lilia. Pen still in hand, paused from scribbling down notes, she then gestures towards the potted fern in Lilia’s arms. “What’s that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, sorry for being concerned over you missing our usual lunch date,” Lilia responds with feign offense as she walks up to Rio’s desk where she sets the plant down. Upon discovering they shared the same lunch period and prep period (something Rio suspects was Lilia’s doing, though Lilia refuses to admit), Lilia insisted on Rio joining her for lunch all week. It was their little check-in: a moment for LIlia to see how things were going and a moment for Rio to ask any questions, or for both of them to simply talk about their day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Today, however, Rio decided to skip to finish preparing for next week.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Again, </span>
<em>
<span>nothing</span>
</em>
<span> is going to keep her after work this afternoon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio is determined to become one with that living room couch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>God help whoever dares to stop her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>(Her money is on Alice.)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This, my dear,” Lilia begins to explain. “This is your ‘you survived your first week of teaching’ gift - granted, I am assuming that you’ll make it through the next few hours and that you’re bolting as soon as that bell rings. I wouldn’t hold that against you either.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Plan instantly discovered and attention now diverted from the lesson plans on her desk, Rio throws her head back in a laugh, bringing herself to her feet. She comes around the desk to pull Lilia into a quick hug. “You didn’t have to do that, Ms. Cal-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Lilia</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio corrects, stepping back from their quick embrace. “Thank you, that’s very sweet of you. And not at all necessary. Truly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not having it, Lilia waves a hand in the air as if to dismiss Rio’s comment physically. “Please, as if we shouldn’t mark important milestones and we both know how much this week - the moment - means to you, Rio. I just hope you still enjoy plants. Perhaps I should have checked before assuming.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sentiment isn’t lost on Rio; she knows what Lilia is referring to, even though neither of them put them into words (they don’t have to): the car accident and drunk driver that left her an orphan at such a young age, her own long recovery from the crash, the lost memories - some of which she never remembered, the less than stellar foster homes throughout the years, putting herself through school entirely by herself, landing this job - the one she hoped would be available after her graduation, starting this career..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, Rio doesn’t give any of those memories a voice. She doesn’t need to open the floodgates at work (or, rather, at all, for that matter), not with half a day to get through with twenty-five smiling faces. Plus, with the heavy silence lingering between the two of them, Lilia already knows how Rio feels. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After all, Lilia was there through everything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So, instead, Rio says reassuringly, unable to hide the thick emotion in her voice, “</span>
<em>
<span>Love</span>
</em>
<span> them still. Can’t get enough.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As if an attempt to bypass the heavy air between them, Lilia clears her throat and dares to change topics altogether. “The first year teachers get together is this evening,” she states as if the social invitation for all district employees hasn’t been sitting in her calendar all week. “Will you be attending?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s furrowed eyebrows and wrinkled nose is all the answer Lilia needs. Even Alice has been nagging her to go all week, but with an early morning shift at the cafe tomorrow and the growing level of exhaustion complying all week, Rio officially declined the invitation end of day yesterday.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”I’ll try for the next social event,” she promises. “There’s one at the end of the calendar year, right? Before the winter break?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia opens her mouth to comment, but before she can, she is interrupted by a loud chiming from Rio’s computer that makes them both jump to attention out of habit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, that’s-” Rio replies, returning to her office chair and scooting herself closer to her monitor to check the instant message from the school’s system waiting for her. “That’s the nurse,” she finishes with a frown. Her heart drops into her stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is everything alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Shaking her head slowly, she clacks away at her keyboard and sends off a quick response to the sender. Rio looks up at Lilia as she returns to her feet. “Nicky fell during PE,” she reports, concerned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicholas Harkness?” Lilia asks for clarification.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a sigh, Rio stands from her desk once more and nods, gently correcting, ”Yeah, Nicky. The nurse is saying he split his lip. I want to go check on-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t apologize, my dear - go,” Lilia says.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s a short walk from her first grade classroom to the nurse’s office - one that Rio hoped she didn’t have to make so soon, but yet here she is quickly taking long strides. Rio finds Nicky sitting in the corner of the small office, ice-pack to his mouth. The desire to comfort overcomes her and she talks a step towards him, but a sudden hand on her shoulder stops her in her tracks in the middle of the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ms. Vidal,” the nurse greets. Embarrassingly enough, Rio struggles to recall the woman’s name. They briefly met last week when Rio was bombarded with information during training. “The bleeding’s finally stopped, but we’ll want to keep the ice pack on for a little longer to help reduce the swelling. I don’t think he should return to PE today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nods in agreement, taking the few remaining steps that separate her from Nicky in the corner of the room. She leans forward slightly and holds out her hand towards the sniffling boy, tears still welling up in his eyes. “He can come hang out in our room for the rest of the time, no problem,” she offers with a gentle smile. “I could use the company.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lesson plans be damned; she could stay after work a little while if it meant making him feel better.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky, trying to furiously blink back those tears brimming on the corner of his eyes, reaches out to grab Rio’s hand - his touch tender and meek. He doesn’t look up, shuffling towards her in silence acceptance of her invitation. She gives his hand a small squeeze as if to silently reassure him that everything is okay. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everything will be fine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“According to the coach, he tripped over himself as the kids were all running around and fell face forward,” the nurse states. “Fortunately, he didn’t hit his head - little miracles. I will go ahead and contact his mother to let her know what happened, that everything is alright.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s a knee jerk reaction that escapes her instantly. “Oh, no,” Rio finds herself quickly replying before she can stop herself or even think the idea through. “I can call Ms. Harkness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The last time they spoke was Tuesday morning before the start of the school day when Agatha showed up to pick up Nicky’s replacement bean sprout for their plant unit. The last text exchange was still that rabbit emoji from Monday. Many times over the last few days, Rio found herself debating whether to reach out - whether to continue their previous conversation from Sunday. To continue the playful flirting and bantering that left her smiling all day that previous Sunday - the distraction that caused her to frantically decorate her room last minute before the first day of class.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio also found herself hesitating more times than she cares to admit on their text exchange, becoming a far cry from that bold barista who wrote her number on a to-go cup of coffee in hopes to continue the banter her week away from the cafe. The recent developments - discovering that Nicky, her student, is also Agatha’s son, gave Rio pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She also found her roommate shouting ‘</span>
<em>
<span>just send a message already</span>
</em>
<span>’ a handful of times across the apartment - something about the aura of their living quarters feeling too nervous and anxious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sometimes, those shouts were followed or led with ‘</span>
<em>
<span>you only live once - don’t the youths still say that?’</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They, for the record, do not.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice is also quick to point out that Rio was her barista first before she ever was her son’s teacher - by a few weeks, even.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Despite her best interest and her wants, Rio never did reach back out and, well, she could blame work - the first week being chaotic and all that. She can easily behind the excuse instead of admitting that she didn’t know how to proceed forward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Honestly, a part of her wishes that Agatha would break the silence and force her own hand - make the decision for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead, Rio relies on this moment, presented to her in the form of a swollen lip and a defeated little boy missing out on dodge ball. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or maybe kickball? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Either way..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on, buddy,” Rio says gently, leading Nicky out of the nurse’s office and into the hallway to make their walk back to their quiet safe haven.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He follows Rio silently and lets go of her hand once they are back in the classroom, making a beeline straight for his desk opposite the room from her own. Rio, grabbing her phone  and a tissue from her desk, walks over to him and kneels down to his level.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Rio asks gently, tilting her head to the side, offering him a kind smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From behind the ice pack that Rio suspects he’s also just trying to hide behind, he nods his silent response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good, I’m glad you’re okay,” she says, using the tissue to tab at the tears in his eyes. She places it on his desk. “That was probably quite the shock, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Again, he nods and Rio fears this would be the extent of their conversation, but then his tiny voice asks, “Does it look bad, Ms. Vidal?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She reaches out for the ice pack and carefully lowers it, revealing the cut running down the left side of his puffy lower lip. She smiles warmly again at him when he meets her eye and shakes her head. “Not too bad. It’ll heal up quick,” she promises. “Do you want to talk to your mom?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” he answers, his voice still so small. She wants to reach out and pull him into a hug. Instead, Rio pulls up Agatha’s contact information and Nicky tilts his head in confusion that echoes in his words. “Why is my mom Señor Scratchy in your phone?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhh,” Rio hesitates for a second, willingly herself to quickly find a believable answer, one that doesn’t reveal the truth of Agatha being a smartass a couple weeks ago while ordering herself coffee. “It’s.. well.. It’s to remind me that she </span>
<em>
<span>still</span>
</em>
<span> hasn’t shown me your pet bunny,” she explains, begging to any listening deity that the excuse is convincing enough to a six year old.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Rabbit</span>
</em>
<span>,” Nicky corrects with an air of offense, leaving Rio to question if there is a difference between rabbits and bunnies. She’s fairly certain there isn’t, but this child, with all his sudden bold confidence, is making her second guess her entire education. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“..rabbit,” Rio decides to correct herself. Honestly, she is grateful that Nicky isn’t asking </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span> she had his mother’s contact information to begin with, though she probably could scrounge up another excuse, need be. She’s his teacher, after all. Of course she has her contact information.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Small victories.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She dials the number; there’s an answer on the third ring.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ms. Vidal? What’s wrong?” Agatha says quickly. Direct mixed with confusion and concern. Of course she is. Rio hasn’t contacted her in days and now she’s calling during the school day, no less.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hi, Agatha,” Rio replies, meeting Nicky’s gaze. “I have you on speaker and Nicky’s sitting with me-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s happening?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m okay, Mama,” Nicky speaks up, sensing the rise of his mother’s panic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hi there, baby..” There’s a shift in Agatha’s voice. It grows immediately warm, full of the love that she has for her son. Rio can’t help but smile at the endearment. For a moment, the panic disappears. There’s even a small sigh of relief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicky </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> okay now,” Rio reassures. “But he did have a tumble in PE just a little bit ago that landed him in the nurse’s office-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There was so much blood, Mom, but I didn’t get any on my shirt!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicky, </span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The panic instantly returns in full force. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wrinkling her nose, Rio closes her eyes tightly. Damn. Next time they would have to go over their tack. Rio hopes there isn’t a next time, though. She doesn’t want to call Agatha like this again (though she wouldn’t mind calling Agatha again, if she were to be completely honest with herself - courage, where art thou?)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He cut his lip in the fall,” Rio explains. “But it’s all under control. It’s fine; he’s fine.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Does he need to go to urgent care? Do I need to come over?” Agatha asks. “I’ll come over. I can leave work-“ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You do not need to come over, Agatha, and he does not need medical attention - the nurse cleared him,” Rio reassures again, glancing over at Nicky. “But the school was going to inform you regardless of the incident. I figured it would sound better coming from me. Err, from us.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There’s a pause. For a split moment, Rio thinks the line died, but Agatha speaks up and offers a soft, “Thank you, Ms. Vidal, for the call then. Nicky, baby, I’ll see you after school, okay?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re welcome, Agatha,” Rio responds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bye, Mama!” Nicky sneaks in before Agatha actually does hang up the line. He puts the ice back on his lip. “She’s really worried, I can tell. Her voice got </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> high.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your mom really loves you,” Rio grunts and stands up, wincing slightly from the amount she spent kneeling. She really should’ve pulled up one of the student chairs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She walks back over to her desk and sits down. Nicky’s gaze is still on her, watching intently. He points to the plant on her desk. “Ms. Vidal, what’s that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, this?” Rio asks, picking up the pot containing her new fern and lifting it to give Nicky a better view of the plant for a moment. “Ms. Calderu gifted me this little guy. Isn’t that sweet of her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyebrows furrow. “Little guy? That’s a plant, Ms. Vidal,” he points out, bypassing Rio’s question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It is,” Rio nods, watching Nicky stand up and wander over to her desk. He stands next to her; they’re almost eye level. She pulls the pot closer to the edge of the desk. “I tend to think of my plants like people. Or pets, I guess. They’re living, too. Like your.. rabbit.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You almost said </span>
<em>
<span>bunny</span>
</em>
<span>, didn’t you?” he accuses, eyes narrowing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio holds her hands up as if she were caught in her terrible, </span>
<em>
<span>terrible</span>
</em>
<span> crime. “You caught me,” she admits. “But, anyway, your rabbit has his own special name, doesn’t he?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Señor Scratchy,” Nicky says proudly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Señor Scratchy,” Rio repeats, nodding. “I like to give my plants their own names, too.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you going to name this one?” Nicky asks, curious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” she says honestly with a small shrug. “We just met, so nothing’s come to me yet. I got to give it some more time, you know? See what kind of personality he has first.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky nods, but his face lights up after a moment, graced with an idea. “Ms. Vidal, do you know how we have our bean sprouts? And the bean sprouts we keep here in class, too? Can </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> be the class’ too? It could be our classroom pet. Our classroom plant.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The idea makes Rio smile. She tilts her head, giving it a thought (as if she didn’t make her decision automatically). “That sounds wonderful, Nicky,” she answers. “Then maybe we need to give him a name as a class. We’ll do some brainstorming when everyone comes back. How does that sound?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Amazing</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looks up towards the clock when the final bell rings and then diverts her attention back to the twenty five students shuffling in their seats to grab their backpacks. “Alright, my little noodles,” she announces from her own desk. “Have a good weekend and I will see you on Monday, bright and early!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There’s a mix melody of “bye Ms. Vidal”s and “have a good weekend”s as they lift their small chairs onto their desks and head to the classroom door. Just as the last of them filed their way out, Agatha bolts her way in and Rio realizes that Nicky lingered behind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Hello, Ri- Ms. Vidal,” Agatha says quickly, correcting herself, as she makes a beeline to Nicky hovering at his desk. She doesn’t glance her way as she walks past and Rio doesn’t fault a worried mother wanting to see her child. “Nicky, baby,” she cooes, kneeling down to his level. “Oh, look at your lip, sweetheart. Does it hurt?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mama, did you know that today I’m spaghetti?” Nicky states, bypassing all of her concern nonchalantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha is taken aback, confused. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”What?” Rio echoes from behind her own desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky nods in confirmation, as if such a little notion could explain anything with any sense of certainty. “Today, we’re noodles.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh!” Rio gasps, covering her mouth. Agatha, still kneeling, shifts on her feet to turn towards Rio, confusion ever present.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”That’s what Ms. Vidal called us today. Noodles,” Nicky explained. “So I decided I’m spaghetti. Billy and Tommy are probably macaroni. Yesterday, we were nuggets.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Struggling to keep a straight face, Rio explains, “The day before, they were cinnamon rolls.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”What’s with all the processed foods?” Agatha asks, standing straight as she helps Nicky put on his backpack.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Yeah, maybe I should call them my little bean sprouts on Monday,” Rio muses. “I </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> considering pizza rolls.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky’s face lights up at the mention. “Mama, can we have pizza rolls for dinner? It’s </span>
<em>
<span>Friday</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Should I be afraid that you share the same diet as a six year old boy?” Agatha questions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”You heard the kid, it’s </span>
<em>
<span>Friday</span>
</em>
<span>. He </span>
<em>
<span>clearly</span>
</em>
<span> deserves pizza rolls,” Rio says, siding with Nicky. “Plus, I think that’ll help with the whole cut lip thing. I know it would make </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span> feel better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky beams up at his mother in excitement, taking her hand into his. “Yeah! It’ll help!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha lets herself get pulled towards the windows of the classroom, but she glances over her shoulder back towards Rio. “Don’t encourage him,” she playfully hisses, as if she hasn’t already caved at the idea of giving the boy exactly what he asked for.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Besides, you </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> to celebrate completing your first week of first grade - that’s a rather important milestone, if I do say so myself,” Rio, indeed, continues to encourage him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky stops at the window seal lined with growing bean sprouts and the new potted fern. He tilts his head to look back up at Agatha, agreeing, “Yeah! We </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> to!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know, that </span>
<em>
<span>isn’t</span>
</em>
<span> a milestone I remember reading in all those parenting books.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, really? Then you </span>
<em>
<span>don’t</span>
</em>
<span> know how you celebrate the end of the second week?” Rio questions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Enlighten me, Ms. Vidal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a mischievous smile, Rio meets Nicky’s eye. He matches her grin and mouths the words ‘chocolate cake’ at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leans back in her office chair and responds, “Obviously, it’s a slice of–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A whole one!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A whole chocolate cake,” Rio immediately corrects herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Like the one Aunt Wanda made for my birthday over the summer!” Nicky exclaims with a little bounce.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looks between him and Rio, narrowing her eyes as she shakes her head, mostly at Rio. “I don’t like this little team up you two have going on here,” she states. “All this talk about celebrating - how’s Mama supposed to celebrate these so clearly real milestones?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll share the pizza rolls </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> the cake,” Nicky says, matter of factly. “And you can have wine,” he adds nonchalantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tries to hide her laugh, tries to play it off as a cough and covers her mouth. It’s not convincing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha opens her mouth to respond, but Nicky pulls on her hand again. He points at the fern and explains, “We have a class plant, Mama! I don’t think Ms. Vidal can be trusted with an </span>
<em>
<span>actual</span>
</em>
<span> class pet. She doesn’t know the difference between a rabbit and a bunny.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh?” Agatha’s eyes narrow slightly, meeting Rio’s with a mischievous and playful glint. “You’re right, Nicky. That </span>
<em>
<span>simply</span>
</em>
<span> won’t do.” She then mouths the words, carefully enunciating ‘there is no difference.’ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ensuring that Nicky isn’t paying her any attention, Rio makes a grand gesture of rolling her eyes and shaking her head. Her smile never leaves her face - if anything, it only grows due to this ridiculous interaction she’s quite enjoying. It’s one that won’t last for much longer, she fears. “I promise, I’ll do some research this weekend!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm, I’ll check your homework on Monday then,” Nicky remarks. “Mama, we named it Ferny. As a class!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ferny?” Agatha repeats, raising her eyebrows.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was a unanimous decision made by a room full of first graders,” Rio quickly follows up in her own defense. “I immediately was out voted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s a </span>
<em>
<span>good name</span>
</em>
<span>, Ms. Vidal!” Nicky defends, puffing out his chest as he defended his classmates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha throws her head back in a laugh, one that only ensures that Rio keeps smiling (she likes the sound of that laugh; she wants to hear more of it). This time, it’s Agatha who gives Nicky’s hand a gentle tug before heading towards the classroom exit. “Come on, my love. We don’t need to keep Ms. Vidal away from her own weekend any longer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky walks in step with his mother. “Bye, Ms. Vidal!” he calls back over his shoulder as they step into the hallway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bye, my little meatball!” Rio calls after him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From down the hall, although it is nearly overshadowed by Nicky’s loud bemused giggles, she hears Agatha groan, “</span>
<em>
<span>Stop that!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio can’t help but chuckle to herself.</span>

<p>
<span>“One last </span>
<em>
<span>final</span>
</em>
<span> plea,” Alice's voice comes from behind Rio lounging comfortably on the middle of the couch in oversized pajamas and wrapped in a fuzzy throw blanket (the very definition of lazy comfort, if she says so herself). The cushions on either side of Rio’s head sink under her roommate’s hands pressed firmly into them. She looks up to see Alice’s face hovering above her own, pouting as if </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> would work against Rio at all - as if she did not face twenty-five different daily versions of that multiple times this week alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice would have to try </span>
<em>
<span>much</span>
</em>
<span> harder to get her to cave because currently? There isn’t a force strong enough to separate her from this couch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Rio, determined, is not going to cave, not when she has been looking forward to this very evening - this very moment - for the better part of three days now. There are no words to describe the level of exhaustion aching throughout her entire body. She didn’t anticipate first grade to be so relentless - how could they have </span>
<em>
<span>so much</span>
</em>
<span> energy?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why do I feel this </span>
<em>
<span>isn’t</span>
</em>
<span> the final plea?” Rio questions as she narrows her eyes accusingly at her roommate, using chopsticks to grab a potsticker out of the takeout container she holds. As she takes a bite, she tilts her head to the side and raises an eyebrow, not breaking their shared gaze as she chews. “My answer hasn’t changed from the thousand of other times that you asked, Alice,” she enforces. “Hasn’t changed since we got the invitation. Which I replied to, by the way. Nope.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dramatically, Alice throws her head back and releases a guttural sigh. “Come on,” she whines, looking down at Rio again. “Aren’t you even the least bit tempted to see Calderu throw back some flaming shots? Or Davis wine drunk?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you even the least bit tempted to have me pay rent on time?” Rio retorts without missing a beat. “Plus, I can’t even </span>
<em>
<span>picture</span>
</em>
<span> Calderu in the same vicinity of a shot glass. Davis and wine, however, I can definitely see. That woman’s definitely too..p</span>
<em>
<span>erky</span>
</em>
<span>. She’s hiding something.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ll never know if my quest to get her to was successful or not - I won’t tell you,” Alice grumbles, childishly. “Besides, the rent for September was due last week. You still have plenty of time to get October’s in order–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>An eruption of screaming voices from the television set across the living room jerks both of their attentions towards it. Alice waves a dismissive hand at the screen displaying shaking night vision footage of men freaking out at each other, yelling at the top of their lungs. “I can’t believe I’m being stood up for trash ghost hunting shows. You hate ghosts,” she points out in despair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Hate</span>
</em>
<span> them,” Rio concurs, nodding as she pulls the throw blanket closer to herself in an attempt to signal that she isn’t changing her mind. She is officially tucked in and she has </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span> plans to leave this apartment - hell, or even the boundary of the living room for that matter. Would she even drag herself to her bedroom later? Who knows? Not even she does.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Doesn’t getting appropriately smashed with your colleagues throughout the district sound more fun than whoever </span>
<em>
<span>they</span>
</em>
<span> are?” Alice gestures towards the tv. Somehow - </span>
<em>
<span>somehow</span>
</em>
<span> - the camera is still shaking and the group of men are still yelling at each other about who knows what.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s not as strong of an argument as you think it is,” Rio remarks, taking a stab this time at another potsticker.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Fine</span>
</em>
<span>,” Alice says, shifting gears and changing tact. “How about drinking some liquid courage, watching said colleagues get appropriately smashed, and maybe - </span>
<em>
<span>maybe</span>
</em>
<span> - you get the nerve to actually text your crush back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If I wanted to get drunk and text Agatha, I know where your cheap ass bottle of tequila is,” Rio grumbles. “But I </span>
<em>
<span>really don’t</span>
</em>
<span> want to drunk text her. And it’s not about </span>
<em>
<span>nerves</span>
</em>
<span>, Alice..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It is a </span>
<em>
<span>little</span>
</em>
<span> bit about nerves.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But it is mostly the circumstances Rio finds herself in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>..and nerves.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, </span>
<em>
<span>strictly</span>
</em>
<span> for clarification’s purposes, we </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> finally admitting that Agatha is your crush now?” Alice asks. “Good to know. Hey, can I have a dumpling?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The rush of heat to her checks causes Rio to tilt her head down, not wanting to give Alice any sense of satisfaction for the blush now present. There’s also a tiny part of her that doesn’t want to give her a potsticker either, but does so reluctantly and refuses to look up to give her any gratification.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you!” Alice replies, chipper, plucking the potsticker from between the pair of chopsticks and taking a bite. “I’ll be sure to give you a play by play if anything scandalous goes down - don’t want you to feel excluded from unofficial district nonsense. Or for you to hear it from anyone else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckles lightly - smiles even, but it fades a tad as Alice steps away from the back of the couch and towards. Rio sits up and turns herself towards Alice who is already unlocking the door. “Hey,” she calls out, tone now incredibly serious as the television continues playing, forgotten.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice turns around and gives Rio a reassuring nod. “I know and I will if I have to, promise,” she says for added reassurance, her own tone matching that of her roommate’s. It’s not a new conversation; it’s practiced and memorized. Frequent. Regardless, ever since their friendship solidified, it is one that Rio insists on having, even with fewer and fewer words as time goes on. The reassurance keeps her anxiety at bay, so it’s one Alice doesn’t mind having whenever it raises its head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s important to Rio, so it’s important to Alice -  sometimes, it truly is as simple as that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But-” Alice tries to begin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No but’s,” Rio immediately interrupts, shooting her a warning glare. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m a butt person,” Alice deadpans. “You </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> this, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re a freaking idiot,” Rio states, her smile returning as she once again shakes her head in disbelief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Unfortunately, your idiot, though,” Alice grins. “What I </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> going to say is that it’s technically a work function and I have my limit - I don’t need those stuffy admin stooges knowing anything they shouldn't know about me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Like you being a budding arsonist?” Rio guesses. “And that you’re encouraging future budding arsonists as well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Exactly. </span>
</em>
<span>Don’t wait up for me - enjoy hate watching ghosts,” Alice says, pulling their front door open. Before she takes a step out, she looks over her shoulder. “And, you know, just ask her how the kid is doing - probably the easiest way to start a conversation tonight-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Bye</span>
</em>
<span>, Alice,” Rio calls out, returning her attention and self back to the television.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hearing the closing of the apartment door and the lock clicking itself back in place, Rio allows herself to relax back into the soft couch cushions for what she assumes would be for the rest of the evening. She takes small bites of the remaining dumplings as she absentmindedly watches these group of three people, in various shades of green, talk back and forth with feverish furor about who would be locked in the basement in complete darkness for the next hour - the very same basement where they stumbled upon remains of some sort of satanic ritual.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When it is revealed to also have been the scene of a murder over a hundred years ago, Rio can’t help but roll her eyes at the new information. She foresees an EVP claiming to be an evil demon before the end of this episode.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So over the top..” she murmurs under her breath, reaching for another potsticker, only to find the container now empty. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Shoulders falling in defeat (and perhaps thinking a bit too longingly about the one dumpling that got away via means of Alice), Rio sighs heavily as she forces herself to sit up against her will in order to reach the coffee table to set the container on. Her hand lingers over the styrofoam container with her fried rice and main entree of orange chicken.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She tilts her head to the side, contemplating her next course of action. She </span>
<em>
<span>could</span>
</em>
<span> just continue with her evening. She could just continue to enjoy the ordered food she had delivered, and mutter to herself regarding the ridiculousness of this show’s hosts and unoriginality into the nothingness of the now empty apartment, or…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grabs her phone from the coffee table instead, unlocks it, and brings up her text thread with Agatha. “Don’t overthink,” she warns herself. She can also hear Alice reminding her that she technically met Agatha at the coffee shop weeks before their paths crossed at Westview Elementary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She quickly types out a message and hits send, not allowing herself a second to ruminate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey! I wanted to check in, if that’s alright: is Nicky still okay? You?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nearly instantaneously, a speech bubble appears to the left, under her sent message. Three dots flashing in a patterned unison, causing her heart to skip a beat and for her to hold her breath. They vanish just as instantly as they appeared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then they reappear once more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And disappear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Reappear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Vanish.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The perfect storm of what happens next takes Rio by complete surprise: the screen containing her messages disappears, replaced by an incoming phone call from Señor Scratchy herself. Agatha had determined, obviously, that texting would not suffice. The high pitch ring tone, however, mixed with the screaming hosts from the television causes Rio to jump in fright and her phone is tossed into the air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit!” Rio hisses, lunging forward after her device. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She misses it completely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The phone lands on the carpet, under the coffee table, with a couple of soft thuds.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck me,” she grumbles, hunched over to reach under the table. She feels around, brushing the carpet with the tips off her fingers until she finds the phone that is no longer ringing. Did the line drop? Did Agatha hang up? Had she not meant to actually call? Did Rio decline it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She quickly puts the device up to her ear. “Hello..?” she says, breathless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, is </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> what you want me to do?” Agatha’s voice, bemused, says from the other end of the line.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The line did not drop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha did not hang up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> mean to actually call.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio most definitely did </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>decline it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha clearly heard everything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A little mortified, Rio’s mouth hangs agape as her eyes widen in the realization the phone was, indeed, answered and Rio was certainly heard. Agatha’s brash comment leaves her speechless, searching for her own voice that momentarily fails to return to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There’s that cute little barista that gave me her number,” Agatha all but purrs. “I was wondering where she had gone off to this last week.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t actually - I just..” Rio stutters, grabbing the remote from the coffee table and pausing the streaming show. Fuck ghosts for getting into this mess. “I mean, I..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re adorable when you’re flustered,” she teases with a soft chuckle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio takes a moment to swallow hard, pinching the bridge of her nose in hopes the little jolt of subtle pain would help ground her after Agatha so easily wiped the metaphoric rug from under her feet. “I dropped my phone,” she explains, sighing heavily. “And I am very capable of swearing like a sailor when not surrounded by pairs of tiny, little ears.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”When you’re not surrounded by your little Brussels sprouts, you mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Why would I ever insult them by calling them Brussels sprouts?” Rio asks, mocking offense. “Brussels sprouts are nasty,” she adds with a more serious tone. She is not joking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Have you ever had them?” Agatha questions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Have </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio immediately counters in response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groans, “You actually </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> have the same diet as a six year old, don’t you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Despite Agatha not being able to see her, Rio shrugs her shoulders regardless, using her free hand to grab the food container (chopsticks balancing on top) before she leans back into the couch. “I don’t know about that,” Rio says. “I mean, I’m pretty sure between the two of us, only one of us had pizza rolls for dinner tonight. </span>
<em>
<span>That </span>
</em>
<span>sounds pretty much like a six year old’s diet to me. I have orange chicken and fried rice - very adult.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bold of you to assume I didn’t make myself something else,” Agatha remarks, now taking her turn to counter Rio’s statement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”But did you?” Rio challenges, using her shoulder to now hold the phone. Chopsticks in hand, she opens the container and starts picking away at the smaller bites of the orange chicken. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There’s a pause that follows with a silence so deafening, Rio is convinced the line has gone dead, but then Agatha grumbles a nearly silent “…no” under her breath, a singular word traced with the faintest sense of embarrassment if one listened close enough - and Rio did. She listens intently to Agatha’s every word. “And I am desperately trying to wash away both the cheapness and indigestion with a second glass of wine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know that’s only going to make the indigestion worse, right? You need a base like milk to reduce the acidity - it’s basic chemistry,” Rio explains, trying to pick up a chunk of fried rice with her chopsticks. The majority of which tumbles onto her blanketed chest instead of her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Damn.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Smooth, real smooth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At least Agatha can’t see her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, what are you, some kind of </span>
<em>
<span>teacher</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha teases. Through the phone, Rio also hears the rumbling of small objects being shaken in what she assumes is a hard plastic container. “I may or may not be accompanied by some antacids for after the wine - </span>
<em>
<span>God</span>
</em>
<span>, this is not how I envisioned this conversation going. At all.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio finds herself laughing lightly, amused and no longer paying attention to the newly created mess, “I don’t know.. If I do say so myself, discovering that your son literally has you wrapped around your finger makes for a pretty fun conversation.” She lets out a sudden gasp, “</span>
<em>
<span>Please</span>
</em>
<span> tell me that he even made you dip the pizza rolls in ranch-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I will admit to no such thing.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The quickness of that response is admission enough to the guilt-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And here I thought </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>was the lawyer-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re a lawyer?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Focus</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“On what? On the fact that one </span>
<em>
<span>simply</span>
</em>
<span> cannot have pizza rolls any other way?” Rio questions ever so boldly. This is silly, but if Agatha is willing to lean into it, then she is too (she also cannot picture Agatha doing such a thing - dipping pizza rolls or, hell, </span>
<em>
<span>eating</span>
</em>
<span> them for that matter). “Plus, I bet I can get Nicky to tell me </span>
<em>
<span>everything</span>
</em>
<span> on Monday. All secrets will be revealed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s diabolical: using my own son against me? Again?” This time it’s Agatha who gasps dramatically. “How </span>
<em>
<span>dare</span>
</em>
<span> you, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Ms</span>
</em>
<span>. Vidal,” Rio corrects, cheeky - proud of herself. She scoops another bite of fried rice into her mouth, only dropping a minimal amount this time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Small victories.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She really should grab a fork.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Formalities,” Agatha scoffs before she clears her throat, finally returning to the concern that led to this phone call in the first place. “To actually answer your message, though: I’m fine and, more importantly, Nicky's fine, too. It’s.. It’s really nice of you to follow up with me. You didn’t have to do that. He even said you were very caring today when it happened - when he fell.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The corners of Rio’s lips tug into a soft, small smile, “I was just doing my job, Agatha. Anyone else would’ve done the same. I could tell he was pretty shaken up by everything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think it’s a little bit more beyond ‘doing your job,’ Rio, and </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> everyone would have done the same,” Agatha compliments, voice laced with a tenderness and love that holds dearly for her little boy. “He was worried about ending up in the urgent care again-“ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Again? What do you mean again?” Rio questions, frowning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Over the summer, right after his birthday - at soccer practice,” she begins to explain. “A group of the kids went after the ball the coach kicked out towards them - not a single one of them were looking up - and they all collided into each other. Nicky took a cleat just under his chin.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hisses in sympathy to the painful incident.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Yeah, you’re telling me,” Agatha huffs heavily. “And not a single one of them got to the damn ball either! There was so much blood. It got all over his white practice shirt. There was no salvaging it. It wasn’t even worth the effort to try - it looked straight out of a horror movie. It scared the crap out of both of us. I definitely didn’t keep my cool and it did </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> help the situation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Suddenly, their earlier interaction during the school day makes perfect sense: Nicky proudly proclaiming that he didn’t dirty his shirt this time; Agatha’s worry about rushing him to get medical attention; and Nicky wondering how bad the cut must’ve looked overall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”That must’ve been pretty scary,” Rio murmurs with genuine concern. “I’m sorry you guys went through that this summer - and I’m sorry for the panic today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing to apologize for - it’s not like </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> tripped him in the gym. In that case, we would be having a </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> different conversation, probably with the school board or in a courtroom-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”I would </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> want to be opposite you in a courtroom,” Rio interrupts, earning herself a small laugh from Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Believe me, there’s a lot of people in Westview who share that very same sentiment.. Sometimes I believe that kid’s trying to put me in an early grave on purpose,” Agatha grumbles. “Or give me my first white hairs, but he’s literally all I got.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honestly, I think that you’d look great as a silver fox,” Rio finds herself commenting before she can stop the words from coming forth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”</span>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>? And what makes you say that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”I mean, you’re already pretty foxy - have you </span>
<em>
<span>seen</span>
</em>
<span> yourself?” Rio replies, emboldened, despite being painfully aware of how fast her heart is currently beating. She closes the food container and places the chopsticks on top of it, now just a tad little bit too nervous to continue eating the meal. She carefully sets the container to the side, against the couch cushions, and finally holds her phone with her hand again. “Women must be throwing themselves at your feet,” she adds.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hell, Rio would be the first in line. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There’s only one I have my eye on, if I were to speak truthfully,” Agatha responds rather nonchalantly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, really now?” Rio doesn’t know how her heart can beat any faster, any more painfully against her chest. She can also feel herself flushing. Suddenly, the living room feels too warm and the throw blanket very obsolete. She pulls it off herself, but it offers very little relief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm,” Agatha hums. “The rather unfortunate thing is that.. I haven’t really been able to see her as much as I would’ve liked the last few days and, well, if </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> wasn’t tragic enough, my coffee order has been burnt all week this week at my favorite little coffee shop downtown - whether there’s a correlation is </span>
<em>
<span>anyone’s</span>
</em>
<span> guess.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What a plight you’ve been enduring - sounds absolutely horrific,” Rio comforts, trying not to allow much eagerness into her own voice. Truth be told, it’s a shared tragedy. She’s missed her mornings with Agatha, too, however short and fleeing they were. “Whatever will you do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs heavily into the phone, “I think I need to find a new coffee shop-“ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>What</span>
</em>
<span>?!” Rio squeaks as she sits up straighter, unaware she could even hit such a high frequency. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Again, you’re </span>
<em>
<span>adorable</span>
</em>
<span> when you’re flustered,” Agatha chuckles, bemused. “I can only </span>
<em>
<span>imagine</span>
</em>
<span> how hard you're blushing right now,” she teases. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Am not,” Rio grumbles lightly, trying to disguise her laugh. She </span>
<em>
<span>knows</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha can’t see her, but she pulls the hem of her t-shirt over her nose anyway, covering her burning cheeks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Fine, fine, whatever you say,” Agatha concedes. “I’ll give the place another shot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”As you should - I swear your coffee won’t be burnt tomorrow,” Rio promises. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When are you in?” Agatha asks, curious. “I don’t want to accidentally miss you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Opening until 3,” Rio instantly answers without missing a beat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, I’ll see you before 3, then,” Agatha confirms. “It’s a date.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At once panicked, Rio immediately freezes as her heart jumps into her throat. Her mouth goes dry; she can’t find her voice, let alone any words to respond with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Goodnight, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hears the sound of beeping. Rio pulls the phone away from her ear to stare at the screen, confirming that the line goes dead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”…a </span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio whispers to the screen of her phone as the power turns off.</span>

<p>
<em>
<span>It’s a date</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Those three little words keep Rio awake for most of the night. She tosses and turns, unable to find a comfortable spot or position in bed. Her pillows were too lumpy, the blankets too scratchy, and her mind plagued by the constant replaying of those three damn little words - a constant loop with varying tones that would slightly change the meaning each and every single time she hears them echo again and again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t think Agatha is serious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then, no, what if she is? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nah, she’s only teasing Rio - that’s it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, what if she isn’t?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s thinking too much about this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s not thinking enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s a rushing train of thought that rudely helps her evade a restful night’s sleep. At most she dozes off here and there every now and again, only to be jolted awake by a new scenario, courtesy of her very own subconscious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her alarm goes off much too soon. The walk to the coffee shop feels like a marathon this morning, despite it still being barely a block away on main street. The September morning also feels just a tiny bit </span>
<em>
<span>too</span>
</em>
<span> chilly, making Rio wish she could be back in her bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Those pillows and blankets suddenly look absolutely perfect. No complaints.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She reaches the coffee shop at the same time as Jen, who unlocks the front entrance and lets them both in. They still have another hour before opening at 7 - plenty of time to make herself a cup of coffee to try to shake last night’s poor sleep. She finds herself making four shots of espresso with a dash of oat milk. There’s no bitterness. There’s no burnt taste. The machine and the roast are fine, but the amount of caffeine in this one drink makes her wonder if she’ll end up seeing sounds and hearing colors later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For a moment, Rio wonders if perhaps Jen sabotaged Agatha’s order on purpose (or if the issue had been resolved earlier), but only for a moment. She’s still too tired and not fully awake to entertain mundane conspiracy theories.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rather, she and Jen spend the time setting up for the morning rush and to go over what Rio’s work schedule will look like now during the school year. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The morning rush doesn’t start right away - it never does on a Saturday. Rio doesn’t envy her coworkers working the weekday mornings and Rio makes her own coffee at home during the week to avoid the chaos of the pre-work crowd. She’ll see them again during the district’s winter closure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s able to hold down the bar by herself, leaving Jen to take care of the behind the scenes business in the back office, until about 9:30 when the line gets a little too long. Despite it, Rio finds herself grateful for the constant turnaround of customers. It keeps her busy; it keeps her mind off things (</span>
<em>
<span>when</span>
</em>
<span> exactly is Agatha coming? Oh, someone came through the door - is it her? What does one mean by ‘</span>
<em>
<span>it’s a date</span>
</em>
<span>’ in the context of visiting another’s place of work? The usual questions).</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, instead, she’s able to focus on making different drink orders coming through.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Cappuccino, double shot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dirty chai latte.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>English breakfast tea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Flat white.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Decaf black coffee (</span>
<em>
<span>heathens</span>
</em>
<span> - how was your full night of sleep?).</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Americano.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>London fog.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Iced coffee.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Cold brew.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Something something with an outrageous amount of sugar.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The lull begins around 1pm, as Rio anticipates.She spends the next hour cleaning machines, wiping down counters, and washing cups. Alice shows up just a little after 2pm. Before she can give Rio her order, Rio warns her in an audible grumble, “If you tell me how much sleep you got last night, I </span>
<em>
<span>will</span>
</em>
<span> throw you through the front window of the shop.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Such delightful customer service skills - top notch,” Alice comments. “Can I have the usual? On my tab, of course.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t have a tab, Alice,” Rio states, grabbing a mug and taking a couple of steps over to the espresso machine. “I just don’t ever let you </span>
<em>
<span>pay</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re my favorite kind of tab – and roommate,” Alice quickly adds, sidestepping along the bar to follow Rio. “How did you end up having a rough night? You didn’t even come out with me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio whines, a sound that is covered by the whirling and grinding of the espresso machine producing two shots of the dark liquid. She waits for the macchine to settle and right before she begins to froth the milk, she adds, “I texted Agatha last night. She called me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This time, it’s Alice’s voice that is drowned out - hers by the steaming milk. Rio is fairly certain it’s just a standard, high pitched ‘</span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>’ she misses out on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then again, with Alice, anything is fair game.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How very not millennial of her,” Alice comments as Rio assembles the cappuccino and slides it over to her. “But how did it go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips thin and her eyebrows furrow together as she ruminates how to respond. She wishes she has a task to busy her hands, to distract her mind from overthinking - or even to drown out Alice’s inevitable reaction. She waits for her roommate to finish taking a sip from her cup of coffee.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She said she’d come in today before the end of my shift, but I, uh, couldn’t tell if she was joking or not when she said it would be a date,” Rio admits.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice sets the cup down against the counter town with a heavy hand, sloshing some of the liquid onto the bar. “Excuse me, again, </span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>?” she hisses.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, with her hands propped against the edge of the counter opposite of Alice, leans forward. “That’s what </span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> said,” she hisses right back. “</span>
<em>
<span>After she hung up without any further details</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think that I may be pointing out the obvious here,” Alice begins. “But doesn’t your shift end in forty-five minutes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More or less,” Rio confirms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before Alice dares to make a remark, their attention is both pulled towards the entrance to the coffee shop. The door pushes open, clanking against the bells hanging just above it which signals the arrival of  a new customer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It signals </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> arrival.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio whispers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice picks up her mug and brings it to her mouth in order to hide her lips as she gives Agatha a quick glance over. “Well, shit - good for you-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop it,” Rio warns, giving her a tiny glare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m going to go bother Jen for a bit,” Alice takes a sip of her cappuccino and dismisses herself. “Good luck.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio watches as Alice turns on her heel and heads towards the back to Jen’s office. Shaking her head, Rio reverts her attention back to work and walks up to the cash register where Agatha is waiting. In practiced movement, Rio grabs the top of the stack of to-go cups and black sharpie, but Agatha shakes her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think I’ll hang around today,” Agatha muses, fingers tapping against the counter as she tilts her head in thought. “And maybe I should behave and only go for a double.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Only</span>
</em>
<span> a double?” Rio repeats, turning her back to Agatha to grab an espresso cup. Returning her attention to Agatha, she quickly glances around her, searching for-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We had soccer games this morning and then Nicky wanted to hang out with his Aunt Wanda and the twins,” Agatha supplies before Rio can even ask. “Something about a new trampoline or another.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aunt Wanda, huh?” Rio repeats, shuffling over to the espresso machine. “Your sister..?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha follows in step, with the counter in between them. She waves a dismissive hand in the air at the thought. “Annoying colleague begrudgingly turned best friend and Nicky’s godmother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Begrudgingly, though,” Rio comments, scooping enough grounds necessary for the two shots and feeding them securely into the machine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She wore me down until I didn’t find her presence to be so..” her voice trails off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The word you used was ‘annoying,’” Rio recalls with a small smirk, hitting the switch to bring the brew to life after placing the mug under the nozzle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You also have the twins in your class,” Agatha says, raising her voice to speak over the sudden noise of the roast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, the Maximoffs!” Rio confirms. “And here I thought the Three Musketeers were just fast friends.” She kneels down to open one of the mini fridges under the bar. She pulls out the oat milk and holds it up for Agatha to see, asking a question that requires no spoken word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nods, watches Rio stand back up, and asks, “Are you referring to the literary classic or the chocolate bar?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you think?” Rio grins, adding the smallest of splashes of oat milk to the espresso - not much space to work with. “It’s the best chocolate bar-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excuse me, Almond Joy, no question.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Almond Joy</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio repeats, wrinkling her nose in disgust. “Get out of my coffee shop.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll be sure to tell Jen of the sudden change in ownership,” Agatha says, not missing a beat, as she reaches out for her cup of coffee that’s held out to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio places her hands against the edge of the counter, across from where Agatha now sits, and leans forward. She raises her eyebrows and half nods towards the beverage - another silent question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha meets her gaze, holds it, and brings the rim of the warm mug to her lips to take her first small sip. Eyes still not wavering, she makes it a point to show Rio she swallows before setting the mug back down on the counter. Agatha gives her a small half shrug of the shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Shaking her head as a grin of disbelief tugs at the corner of her lips, Rio rolls her eyes. Is she surprised that Agatha won’t admit there’s an improvement of quality ? No. Does Rio believe there was ever an issue? Also no.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, so, now,” Rio begins slowly as she leans forward, resting her crossed arms against the counter. “Since your coffee is clearly back up to your standard-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And how would you know?” Agatha challenges, also leaning towards Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This is the closest they’ve ever been - a fact that Rio is highly aware of and causes her heart to beat faster. She sees just how piercing Agatha’s eyes are, how incredibly </span>
<em>
<span>blue</span>
</em>
<span>. She catches a glimmer and - wait, did Agatha just glance down at her lips?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Focus</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because,” Rio begins slowly, grounding herself in certainty and confidence. “Every time  I heard from you this last week, you </span>
<em>
<span>immediately</span>
</em>
<span> complained, but </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> are completely </span>
<em>
<span>silent</span>
</em>
<span> this morning, so in conclusion..,” Rio tips her head towards the beverage. “</span>
<em>
<span>That</span>
</em>
<span> is the best cup of coffee you’ve had since last Saturday.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her firmer tone causes a flare to flash in Agatha’s eyes, one that Rio does not miss. She forces herself to not squirm under such a gaze that threatens to devour her. Instead, Rio leans just a tad bit closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tell me I’m wrong,” Rio challenges her right back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks, slowly takes another sip of the cappuccino, and tilts her head to the side. “Oh, </span>
<em>
<span>there</span>
</em>
<span> she is - my favorite feisty barista,” she all but purrs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio bites the inside of her cheek, focusing on the pain and praying to deities she does not believe in - hasn’t since she was a child - that it keeps her blushing at bay. A heavy silence lingers between them as Agatha complies in saying nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their eyes never waver; they’re still locked on each other. Neither one looking away, neither one backing down, as if this too were a challenge issued between them. One of them would flatter first; one of them would have to give in and look away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Therefore,” Rio dares herself to continue, feeling a little too bold for her own good. “I think that really earns me the right to finally see your rabbit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that a euphemism?” Agatha questions without missing a beat. She leans back in her bar stool, dramatically placing a hand over her chest. “Ask a girl to dinner first, why don’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And just like that, Rio’s cool (was she ever?) and confident demeanor instantly crumbles. Her cheeks erupt in a hot blush that consumes, Rio fears, her entire face. Elbows propped against the counter now, she buries the embarrassment and her face into her hands. She groans, “That’s not what-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll show you mine, if you show me yours,” Agatha says, her voice low and husky, not risking to be overheard in the nearly empty coffee shop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, forever grateful for the afternoon lull, snaps her head back up to see that Agatha is once more leaning forward. Her own elbows are resting against the bar, too. She’s resting her chin over her folded knuckles, her smile wicked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And there’s my favorite flustered teacher,” she hums, amused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Swallowing hard, Rio desperately tries to find any coherent word - string of words - to offer a.. She doesn’t even know. A remark? An apology? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A strong desire to climb over this very counter and say yes, despite her better judgement?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>(Would that be a little too forward?)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A clank of ceramic against the counter grabs both their attention. Rio didn’t hear Alice’s return to the front of the shop with her empty mug. “Sorry to interrupt,” Alice says (Rio knows she’s not - she wonders if Alice saw her floundering all the way from the back). “Just wanted to return some dirty dishes. I’m Alice,” she introduces herself, turning to Agatha who doesn’t reply. “Rio’s roommate,” she adds to clarify. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, Al,” Rio speaks up, standing straight and pulling the empty mug towards her. “Which is the best chocolate bar: Three Musketeers or Almond Joy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice wrinkles her nose, “Neither. Butterfingers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>That’s pure sugar</span>
</em>
<span>,” both women say in unison before immediately looking at each other. Rio tears herself away to place the mug in the sink behind her. She flushes it out with water, to be washed later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, isn’t that just the </span>
<em>
<span>tiniest</span>
</em>
<span> bit judgmental,” Alice huffs as Rio steps back into the conversation. “Anyway, I’m heading back home - will I see you later?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before Rio can answer, Agatha cuts her off with a sly smirk, “Hopefully not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And,” Alice continues, not giving Rio a chance to linger on Agatha’s comment. “I’m taking your leftovers - consider it the repercussion for not going to the first year teacher social last night.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s your first year teaching?” Agatha asks, turning to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice shakes her head. “Third year - </span>
<em>
<span>she’s</span>
</em>
<span> the first year who didn’t come,” she points out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head immediately snaps in Rio's direction and, under this new glare, one that feels as if Agatha is trying to see right through her, she feels suddenly as if in an interrogation. “This is your </span>
<em>
<span>first</span>
</em>
<span> year?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yeah, Rio </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> wants to be in a courtroom with Agatha, she confirms. “I never said that it wasn’t,” she replies, her voice meeker than what she likes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia highly recommended you!” Agatha says in disbelief. “When I asked her who would be best for Nicky.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s my mentor!” Rio states. “And, well.. also </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>former first grade teacher, so that’s </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> nothing. Plus, Nicky </span>
<em>
<span>adores</span>
</em>
<span> me - you can’t deny it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice clears her throat and takes a step away from the counter. “As much as I wish I could enjoy the rest of this conversation, it’s not doing any wonders for this lingering hangover. I’ll see you later, Ri.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gives her a small wave and watches her head towards the cafe’s entrance to step back into the main square and to start the short walk back to the apartment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hears Agatha mumble something under her breath. Rio barely makes out a ‘he’s not the only Harkness.’ She doesn’t ask her to repeat herself, not when she can already feel her cheeks starting to flush </span>
<em>
<span>again</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How old are you, anyway?” Agatha asks, point blank.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With Alice out of sight, Rio returns her attention back to the woman still nursing her cup of coffee. “Twenty-three,” she responds. “I finished my degree last May.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nods along. “Twenty-three,” she repeats with wisps of disbelief. After a second, she frowns in confusion. “So, what, did you take a gap year after high school..?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio winces slightly at the question and shakes her head. “I, uh, was held back a year in elementary school,” she admits. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Which grade?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I.. really don’t think you want to know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Which </span>
<em>
<span>grade</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio?” she repeats.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“First.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, my </span>
<em>
<span>god</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha gasps. She folds her arms against the counter top and rests her forehead on top of them. “You’re telling me my son’s first grade teacher </span>
<em>
<span>failed</span>
</em>
<span> the first grade.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Or, rather, she’s done it twice, kinda, and </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> knows the experience,” Rio tries to comfort, not there is anything </span>
<em>
<span>to</span>
</em>
<span> comfort. Although it’s only been one week, Rio knows she’s good at her job. She knows that she is well trained. She knows she has Lilia in her corner as back up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha peeks up from her self made fortress. “That’s not funny,” she grumbles, begrudgingly sitting back up. “How does one even fail the first grade? How many bean sprouts did </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> ferry off to the afterlife?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A genuine laugh escapes her, causing Rio to throw her head back slightly. She clears her throat in an attempt to dismiss any echoes of the laughter and then shakes her head at Agatha. “I think we need to save the traumatic tragic backstories for later - promise it was for good reason. Ms. Calderu didn’t have any vendetta out for a six year old.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nods along, slowly, but then shrugs her shoulders. “I’m not entirely too sure about that, you know.. Calderu was </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> first grade teacher, too-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How old are </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why did you say it like </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio apologizes at once. “I didn’t mean it like that, I swear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thirty-four,” Agatha answers, draining the rest of her espresso cup. “I think retirement’s long overdue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio takes it from her. “Do you want to be the one to suggest it? Because I’m convinced she’s going to be at Westview Elementary literally forever.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wouldn’t be Westview Elementary without her. Or Principal Davis,” Agatha finds herself agreeing. “And you’re right, let’s save the tragedy for not our first date.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The espresso cup clunks loudly against the countertop. Rio immediately picks it back up, impressed that the thing is still fully intact. “If you coming into my place of work is considered a-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, hell no,” Agatha interjects, wrinkling her nose in disgust at the mere idea. “There’s a fairly new gastropub up main street that has a happy hour starting in a few minutes, if you’re willing to completely forget that you’re my son’s teacher and I’m the mother of one of your students - because it </span>
<em>
<span>doesn’t matter</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio. I mean, within limits.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And here Rio thinks she was subtle with her inner personal/professional turmoil. She wonders when Agatha first noticed - probably the first day of school when Rio suddenly went radio silent. That would be her bet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nods slowly. “Within limits,” she agrees before pointing out the obvious. “You know, </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> place has a happy hour in a few minutes, too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah, but as you said - I can’t </span>
<em>
<span>possibly</span>
</em>
<span> take you to your place of work. What kind of standard am I setting?” Agatha points out. “And, besides, I don’t want to give Jen any more money than I already am.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rude,” Jen’s voice comes from Rio’s right. Rio did not hear her come behind the counter. “Just for that, charge her double, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No family and friends discount, Jenny Kale?” Agatha feigns a gasp.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Triple</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio,” Jen corrects herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio glances between the two women. “You guys are.. friends?” she asks. The tension in the air is thick, verging on uncomfortable. Rio begins to wonder if Jen actually burnt those shots of espresso on purpose throughout the week.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs, “Friends, co-signer on a business loan - what have you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen decides to ignore her. “You’re done for the day, Rio. Your tips are waiting for you in the back. I’ll see you tomorrow morning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, tomorrow morning, bright and early,” Rio sighs and then turns to Agatha. “I’ll meet you outside in five minutes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Five minutes,” Agatha repeats. “And I don’t tolerate tardiness, Ms. Vidal.”</span>

<p>Rio wastes no time gathering her belongings from the back office - not that she has much to gather beyond the tips Jen indicated and her messenger bag which she swings over her neck and shoulder. She gives herself a quick glance over in the mirror hanging next to the door. Rio runs her fingers through her hair before deeming herself presentable (as if she hadn’t just spent the last however long conversing with Agatha, looking just fine - <em> that </em> portion of her day wasn’t <em> this </em> portion where she’s moments away from a happy hour leading to who knows what). In a perfect world, she would run back to the apartment for a quick shower. She doesn’t think Agatha would mind if she asked. </p><p> </p><p>But she also doesn’t want to prolong anything.</p><p> </p><p>With minutes still to spare, Rio wizzes through the length of the coffee shop, giving Jen a small wave after her boss gives her a cautious laced ‘good luck.’ She chooses not to read into it. </p><p> </p><p>Stepping outside, she finds Agatha hovering along the edge of the sidewalk, phone to her ear and smiling sweetly. Rio doesn’t have to guess who is on the other line; she knows immediately.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad you’re having fun, sweetheart, but please be extra careful. I’ll see you later. Love you, too.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky.</p><p> </p><p>Even after the conversation ends, Agatha stares lovingly at her phone (Rio, if she were a betting woman, would place money on Agatha’s background being a picture of her son - that sounds like a winning bet, if she ever heard one). </p><p> </p><p>“Everything okay?” Rio asks. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha jumps at the sound of her voice, taken by surprise. She glances at Rio and then quickly back to her phone. “You technically still have two minutes,” she grumbles, as if caught red handed in a moment of private weakness. </p><p> </p><p>“You told me not to be late,” Rio reminds her, shrugging. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks when Agatha mumbles something under her breath about not having to take things quite so literal. Agatha tucks her phone away into her pants pocket and then confirms, “Everything’s okay - the twins taught him to do a backflip on the trampoline, the little menaces, and he <em> had </em> to share.”</p><p> </p><p>“Backflips are cool,” Rio deadpans.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t encourage them.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, one: not a single musketeer is in our presence to be encouraged,” Rio points out. “And two: I am not on the district’s clock on the weekend - I don’t have to be a fully responsible adult.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes in a mixture of amusement and, based on the smile tugging at the corners of her lips, only some minor annoyance. “Come on, it’s a short walk.” </p><p> </p><p>Both women fall in step with each other, walking along the sidewalk that runs along Westview’s mainstreet, leading up to the town’s little square, marked with a quaint stage and gazebo used primarily for holiday functions or whatever community event the local city government deems fit. They’re never big, never too extravagant, but it would be Westview without it. Rio often found solace in those events growing up, especially after–</p><p> </p><p>“Here,” Agatha announces, reaching out and grabbing Rio’s wrist to pull her along inside. </p><p> </p><p>The gesture, however small and unserious, makes Rio’s heart skip a beat. The feeling of Agatha’s skin against hers causes a pit to form in the middle of her stomach. Although the touch doesn’t linger long (Agatha releases her grip as soon as they are inside), Rio’s nerves continue to shoot off for moments to come. They don’t settle until they’re both seated in a booth in the back of the dimly lit, modernly decorated pub - until their first round of drinks arrive.</p><p> </p><p>Whisky on the rocks for both of them (Rio may have panicked and just ordered whatever Agatha did).</p><p> </p><p>“Have we decided on any of the appetizers? The ones listed under happy hour are currently half off regular menu price,” their waiter reminds them.</p><p> </p><p>“Would it be weird to order for no parmesan on the garlic parmesan fries?” Rio asks, looking up from the happy hour menu. “With the aioli on the side?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio catches Agatha peering over at her. Rio tilts her head to the side and smiles lightly. “You get your coffee with oat milk every morning,” she explains, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s rather attentive of you..” Agatha mumbles, hiding her own smile behind her hand as she returns her attention to the menu.</p><p> </p><p>The waiter confirms Rio’s order, “Garlic fries, hold the cow - got it. And for you, ma’am?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyebrow twitches; Rio smirks. She guesses it’s the <em> ma’am </em>. She doesn’t bring it up.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m going to be a bit of a rebel and order from the regular menu,” Agatha warns, holding the happy hour flyer towards the waiter who takes it. She looks back at Rio and picks up her glass of whisky, leaning back against the cushioned seat of the booth opposite of her. “Because I know the Brussels sprouts here are to <em> die </em> for.” </p><p> </p><p>The smirk vanishes off of Rio’s face and her mouth hangs open as the waiter repeats Agatha’s order back to her. Agatha confirms with a nod and takes a sip of her glass when the waiter steps away.</p><p> </p><p>”Is this a <em> ruse </em> to get me to try <em> Brussels sprouts </em>?” Rio questions in disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>With a shrug of her shoulders, Agatha sets her glass down. “Two birds, one stone,” she answers. “When’s the last time you ate a literal vegetable, Rio?” </p><p> </p><p>“I <em> just </em> ordered fries!”</p><p> </p><p>”Potatoes are a starch.”</p><p> </p><p>”A starchy root <em> vegetable </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m trying to keep you from getting scurvy,” Agatha deadpans. </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forward, over the table. “Let me remind you, I have a whole class of bean sprouts.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, so that’s your grand plan: spend all term growing maybe - <em> maybe </em> - one serving of vegetables. Great scheme there, Vidal,” Agatha smirks, bemused. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wants to kiss that smirk right off her face.</p><p> </p><p><em> …what </em> ? Where did <em> that </em> come from?</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Rio is glad she decided to sit across from the woman and not next to her, for both of their sakes. Rio grabs her glass and takes perhaps too large of a sip. She swallows hard. She tries to ground herself.</p><p> </p><p>”Actually,” she says, clearing her throat as she tries to reel in her thoughts. “I <em> do </em> want to propose a school vegetable garden in the future. I think it’s an important skill set for the kids to have and, I don’t know, maybe the town will get on board with it - start a community garden space.” </p><p> </p><p>Arm laid across her chest, propping up her elbow, Agatha nods along, resting her chin against the back of her hand. “So, why not? Propose it, I mean?” she asks with genuine curiosity. </p><p> </p><p>Resting her arms against the tabletop, Rio shrugs, “I’m still trying to find my footing here. I want to have a little bit more experience before I try anything of that caliber. I think I’m still a bit too… <em> green </em>.” </p><p> </p><p>“Did you just..?” Agatha’s voice trails off. </p><p> </p><p>Rio offers a goofy smile (she’s rather proud of herself, she won’t lie). They both take a sip of their respective drinks.</p><p> </p><p>“So, why education?” Agatha asks, leaning forward. Glass in hand, she swirls the amber liquid around the melting ice. “Why teaching?”</p><p> </p><p>It’s a potential loaded question, one that Rio knows she will have to dance around for now. She doesn’t want to lie; she wants to be honest, but there are some things she isn’t willing to offer so readily just yet.</p><p> </p><p>”Lilia,” she settles on an answer.</p><p> </p><p>”<em> Really </em>?” Agatha instantly replies, but immediately backtracks. “Sorry, I didn’t mean it like that. I just.. she’s that inspirational, huh?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods slowly, “She was there for me during a pretty big transitional moment in my life.”</p><p> </p><p>“In first grade..?” Agatha seeks clarification, eyebrows raised slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmhmm,” Rio confirms, biting the inside of her cheek. She takes a moment to piece together what she wants to say next. Agatha doesn’t interrupt or offer any comment - she waits for her to continue. “I had a good childhood until.. I <em> didn’t </em> and Lilia was there for that every step of the way. She continuously checked in on me over the years and offered me a small refuge whenever I needed it - the woman <em> made </em> me a garden in middle school in her <em> own </em> backyard. I want to be that kind of teacher - hell, I want to be that kind of <em> person </em>.” </p><p> </p><p>Out of pure reaction, Agatha reached across the table with her free hand to grab Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath hitches.</p><p> </p><p>”You <em> are </em> that kind of person, Rio,” Agatha states with a strong sense of certainty and conviction reflected in those piercing, blue eyes that hold such determination, as Agatha is ready to convince her if Rio tries to say otherwise.</p><p> </p><p>Which..</p><p> </p><p>“That’s.. really kind of you to say,” Rio begins, her voice now barely above a whisper. “But I’ve only been in this position for a week.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Agatha counters. “I have one six year old who will vouch for you. Probably three if I could get my godsons’ attention for more than two seconds.”</p><p> </p><p>A small laugh escapes Rio as she lowers her head for a moment. When she looks back up, Agatha still has her gaze firmly locked on her. She squeezes Rio’s hand gently, earning herself a soft smile from the younger woman.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky really adores you, you know,” Agatha says. “You <em> and </em> that little bean sprout. He takes it with him to bed every night - has a special little spot for it on his nightstand and everything. He uses a tissue to <em> tuck it in </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shoot up in disbelief. “Stop, no way.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, it doesn’t end there,” she carries on. “He brings it back downstairs to the living room in the morning because when that second bean sprout came home, he was <em> so </em> determined to find the best spot in the house that gets the most sunlight because this one isn’t going to die this time.”</p><p> </p><p>The laugh that escapes Rio this time is louder - genuine and real.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re <em>laughing</em>? I’ve had <em>stress</em> <em>dreams</em> this week about Señor Scratchy eating the damn thing, Vidal, and you’re <em>laughing</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls her hand away from holding Agatha’s to cover her mouth in an attempt to stifle her laugh from growing into a full on cackle. Tears prick at the corners of her eyes, daring to stream down her face, but she dabs them away with her other hand.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s funny,” Rio manages to choke as she tries to gather herself with a couple of deep breaths. “It’s also endearing.”</p><p> </p><p>“You find me having stress dreams endearing?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head, “No, no, no - it’s endearing how amazing of a mom you are to him. Really warms the heart, you know? You’re good, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums. As quick as a soft smile appears on her lips, it vanishes. She lifts her glass to her mouth and drains the rest of the whisky. “Trust me, not everyone would agree with you there,’ she comments, her eyes growing dark. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio asks, confusion growing.</p><p> </p><p>“Ask me what type of law I practice,” Agatha provokes.</p><p> </p><p>Before the question can even find Rio’s voice, the waiter returns and places their appetizers in front of them. He eyes Agatha’s empty drink and Agatha nods. He turns to Rio’s and frowns. “Are we not keeping up with the pace over here? What’s going on?” </p><p> </p><p>“Hang on, hang on,” Rio murmurs, taking the last swing from her glass before offering it to him. “But can I do something sweet this time?” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re an infant,” Agatha groans, throwing her head back.</p><p> </p><p>The waiter hesitates and looks Rio up and down, probably kicking himself for not asking for her ID when they first ordered.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m twenty-three,” Rio corrects before stage whispering. “And if you can sneak over a Smirnoff Ice for m’lady, that would be great.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m in my 30’s, Rio - not ancient. I <em> know </em> what getting Iced is,” Agatha declares.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know that frats throw 90’s parties now?” Rio asks without skipping a beat and, well, rather boldly. “And that the 2000’s are considered vintage?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasps, perhaps a bit too dramatic - a bit too over the top, and places a hand on her chest. “They <em> are </em> not!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m with her,” the waiter agrees, pointing at Agatha. “And I’m leaving before this conversation causes any more emotional damage. What are you having, you bearer of false news?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio bites back a laugh and decides, “A vodka sprite.” She swears she sees Agatha mouth the word ‘basic’ as he confirms her order before leaving the table.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t care what the bill comes out to be, I’m tipping that man one hundred percent,” Agatha states firmly, unraveling her silverware set to find her fork. “You are a menace.”</p><p> </p><p>“Like the Maximoff twins,” Rio nods, pushing her basket of fries towards the middle of the table. She keeps the aioli closer to herself. “Seems like I’m in good company - maybe we can talk Nicky onto our side,” she muses, picking up and taking a bit of a singular garlic loaded french fry.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stabs a brussel sprout with her fork and gestures the silverware towards her to punctuate each word, “Don’t you dare corrupt my sweet, innocent bean sprout caretaker.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio wrinkles her nose at the dreaded vegetable, as if its very existence has caused her great personal offense. “You should really consider getting him an actual plant of his own,” she suggests. “Especially if he’s this partial to a little bean.” </p><p> </p><p>“I have been known to kill succulents - that may not be a good idea,” Agatha remarks, bringing the brussel sprout to her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Shaking her head slowly, Rio rolls her eyes and teases, “Fortunately, I’m talking about Nicky and not you, plant killer - set some reminders on your phone.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs and stabs at the dish of veggies once again. The waiter returns with their second round of drinks - nary a bottle of Smirnoff Ice insight.</p><p> </p><p>“A golden pothos might be a good one to start with,” Rio continues, ignoring her reaction. “It can handle a missed watering - doesn’t need <em> too </em> much light. You can also propagate them, if you’re feeling confident enough as a plant parent, <em> and </em> they grow out in a trailing vine which makes for some cool decorations.”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Rio hesitates and then admits, “I’m not sure if they’re safe for rabbits, though. One second..”</p><p> </p><p>As Rio fishes her phone out of her pocket, Agatha reaches across the table for Rio’s silverware set to unravel. After a quick search, Rio frowns, shaking her head. “Toxic to rabbits,” she sighs, setting her phone down. “I’ll think of something else,” she states, determined, but the determination disappears in an instance upon noticing her silverware across the table. “What are you doing?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes the napkin and knife aside, as they won’t be needed. She pierces two pieces onto the end of the fork and holds it towards Rio. “I don’t think an explanation is necessary.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Those </em> are toxic to Rio Vidals,” she says firmly, eyes narrowing at the shriveled monstrosities at the end of the fork.</p><p> </p><p>“If you want to see the rabbit, you’ll taste the Brussels sprouts,” Agatha states, just as firm and eyes just as narrowed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio meets her gaze. ”I don’t negotiate with terrorists.” </p><p> </p><p>“He’s a <em> real </em> fucking cute rabbit, Rio.” </p><p> </p><p>The air between them is electrified, charged with a nonsensical energy that ebbs around them as neither back down from their stance, nor drop their glare. Is this how Rio envisioned today going? Not in the slightest, but the fact that Agatha can drop her guard and be ridiculous? </p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t complain.</p><p> </p><p>”The fluffiest white fur,” Agatha describes. “Speckled with brown spots. The floppiest ears and the bushiest little tail.” </p><p> </p><p>The tip of Rio’s tongue pushes against the side of her cheek. Her eyes narrow a hair further as she questions, “What about your <em> other </em> rabbit, hmm?” </p><p> </p><p>It’s faint, but it’s there: a small flush across Agatha’s cheeks, a sign of Rio’s tiny victory. Rio bites back a smirk, not daring to provoke her any further. This would do just nicely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clears her throat, trying to find her grounding once more, and shrugs her shoulders. The tip of the fork is still waved in Rio's general direction. “Guess there’s only one way to find out,” she teases. </p><p> </p><p>Stares never break, Rio reaches out and grabs the damn fork. Reluctantly, she brings it up to her mouth and seductively runs the tip of her tongue against the metal prongs and veggies before pulling them free with her teeth. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a sudden loud bang, the table jerks, and Agatha hisses in pain as she leans over to rub her shin, breaking their gaze.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits up straight, using her free hand to cover her mouth as she chews against her will. “Are you okay?” she mumbles.</p><p> </p><p>”Peachy,” Agatha groans, still wincing. “Found the damn table leg.” </p><p> </p><p>“Should I go get some ice-“</p><p> </p><p>”No, no,” Agatha interrupts. “Let’s not embarrass myself and wound my pride further. It’ll be fine in a minute. So, how is it?”</p><p> </p><p>Swallowing, Rio answers, “I’d rather have scurvy.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, come on! They’re cooked in bacon fat!” Agatha defends. “<em> And </em> there’s a toasted pistachio crumble!”</p><p> </p><p>”What a waste of bacon <em> and </em> pistachios,” Rio sighs heavily. She takes a few fries in her hand and dunks it into the aioli - anything to get rid of the wretched taste in her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re ridiculous,” Agatha grumbles. “More for me.”</p><p> </p><p>”Oh, yeah, they’re definitely <em> all </em> for you,” Rio confirms, shoving more fries into her mouth. A beat of silence passes between them before she answers, returning to their previous conversation. “So.. what type of lawyer <em> are </em> you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips thin as they press together, giving the answer some thought before giving it voice, “I’m a criminal defense lawyer. I haven’t been known to always represent the best people and that.. <em> really </em> does some great things to one’s reputation.” </p><p> </p><p>Another moment of silence falls between the two women. Rio slowly nods, taking in the information and really processing what Agatha said. “So, for example..” she says, carefully piecing her words together. Her eyes are fixated against the tabletop. She doesn’t want to look up at her; she doesn’t want eye contact. Part of Rio fears Agatha would see right through her. “You’d potentially be the lawyer representing a drunk driver charged with vehicular manslaughter?”</p><p> </p><p>There’s another silence, one that lasts a little bit longer than the last. The swirl of Agatha’s glass eventually breaks it.</p><p> </p><p>”Bingo.”</p><p> </p><p>”Why did you get into that type of law?” Rio asks, looking up from the table.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head and reminds them both, ”No tragic backstories on the first date, remember?Let’s not ruin the mood.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods slowly  in agreement and then proposes, ”I think we need to do a couple rounds of shots.” </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to tell me twice,” Agatha agrees, turning herself to look over the edge of the booth and away from Rio to catch their waiter’s attention. He takes a couple paces towards their back corner, but stops when Agatha holds up two fingers. She must’ve mouthed the order over to him since Rio doesn’t hear a word. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifts back in her seat, returning focus to Rio. “We’re doing double shots of tequila,” she confirms. </p><p> </p><p>“Whoa, okay, then, umm..” Rio surveys their miniscule amount of food. “Then we should maybe order something a bit more substantial to eat.” </p><p> </p><p>“Nicky swears by the chicken tenders here,” Agatha suggests. “You know, considering you two have the same palate.”</p><p> </p><p>With a roll of her eyes, Rio counter suggests, “I recall seeing a prosciutto and goat cheese flatbread with a hot honey drizzle. Would you split that with me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure.”</p><p> </p><p>A beat.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that why you wouldn’t tell me your name?” Rio asks, bluntly, returning slightly to their previous conversation. “When I first started at the coffee shop?” Although she did agree to not delve into tragic and complicated pasts and in that aspect, Rio wouldn’t dare push, not with a boundary so clearly set. However, it didn’t stop her from putting some pieces of the puzzle together. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t want the cute, new barista looking me up and writing me off,” Agatha replies, shrugging her shoulders before stealing a couple of the french fries from the middle of the table. “Though, if we’re being truthful, I also didn’t expect me to actually write and then <em> call out </em> whatever nonsense I said that morning for nearly <em> three weeks </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks, rather proud of her ridiculous antics. “I was determined to wear you down until you finally told me, but then.. I took a week off and kinda had to speed up the process a little bit - didn’t want you losing interest,” she shrugs and takes a sip of her drink. “Would you have though? Told me eventually?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha steals another fry, takes a bite, and chews slowly - whether it’s to buy time or mull over a response, Rio can’t tell. Her expression is stoic, unyielding to whatever emotion the older woman is experiencing.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio? </p><p> </p><p>She finds herself holding her breath in anticipation.</p><p> </p><p>Finishing off the rest of the fry, Agatha leans back against the back of the cushioned booth seat. She folds her arms over her chest. Confused, Rio furrows her eyebrows and purses her lips. Is it that difficult of a question?</p><p> </p><p>Then, she feels the side of Agatha’s leg slowly moving up between her legs, running along her inner right. The breath Rio is holding escapes her in a surprised huff of air. With her prize earned, the corner of Agatha’s lips tug into a light smirk.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says simply, confidence radiating off every inch of her.</p><p> </p><p>The waiter delivers them each their double shot of tequila rimmed with salt and a saucer of lime slices. “Anything else, ladies?” he asks. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Rio squeaks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, “We’ll take the prosciutto and goat cheese flatbread.”</p><p> </p><p>“Coming right up.”</p><p> </p><p>As the waiter walks away, Agatha pulls away from Rio from under the table, much to Rio’s disappointment. When Agatha scoots closer to the table and picks up one of the shot glasses, Rio mimics her every movement through throwing the shot glass back. </p><p> </p><p>The conversation ebbs and flows, each learning a bit more about each other. Agatha learns that Rio moved back to Westview only a month ago, after trekking through different countries in South America. She’s fluent in Spanish and picked up a little Portuguese, but definitely not enough  to confidently speak despite Agatha’s insistence (the Spanish, however, makes Agatha a bit flustered - Rio will keep this knowledge in her back pocket). She spent four years earning her degree in elementary education, with a minor in biology, at New Jersey City University, paying her way mostly through a scholarship program where she needed to commit to a New Jersey school system for three years or face repaying the total amount on top of the student loans she needed to take out to cover the rest of her expenses. It made the most sense to come back to Westview.</p><p> </p><p>They pick away at the fries and brussel sprouts - yes, even Rio, earning her some more teasing from Agatha (“<em> admit it </em>, they’re growing on you.” ‘That sounds like a very serious condition, I should get it checked out”). They sip on their drinks until empty, both feeling the intended buzz.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reveals she grew up outside of Salem, Massachusetts (and suddenly the <em> that witch </em> coffee cup name makes much more sense) until elementary school when her mother suddenly moved them to Westview. She left for Boston for law school and never looked back. She did a small stint in New York City, but couldn’t imagine raising a child there. She had always wanted to be a mother and being on her own wasn’t about to stop her from achieving that goal.</p><p> </p><p>They share the flat bread once it arrives and continue their delicate little dance of learning, engaging, and teasing until nothing but crumbs remain on their respective plates. They agree on one last round of shots - <em> singles </em> this time, if only to keep the tipsiness going. </p><p> </p><p>When they realize that they’ve lost track of time, Agatha pulls out her phone to text Wanda an apology, but Wanda doesn’t mind. Nicky asks if he can have a sleepover and Agatha grants permission without a second thought. </p><p> </p><p>Just as she earlier insisted, Agatha pays the bill, only so she <em> can </em> tip the waiter one hundred percent - both for his service and, well, for Rio making both him and her feel like they have one foot in the grave (“seriously, what are you? The grim reaper?”). </p><p> </p><p>The sun is setting when they finally leave the establishment and step onto the sidewalk, happy hour long behind them.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you drive..?” Rio asks. “You definitely shouldn’t drive now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Walked,” Agatha answers. “I’m not too far from the main square.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods and insists, “Let me walk you home, then.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not necessary-”</p><p> </p><p>“I wanna be chivalrous - let me be chivalrous,” Rio interrupts, puffing out her chest in defiance and only sways slightly. She’s not taking no for an answer.</p><p><br/>It earns her a small laugh from Agatha who quickly looks her over before nodding. “Alright then,” she agrees. “ <em> Vamanos </em>, my knight in shiny armor.”</p>

<p>
<span>Rio knows she doesn’t have to walk Agatha home, but such an opportunity to do so? Why pass? They fall in line with each other in relative ease, walking side by side as they retrace their steps to the coffee shop, tipsy and swaying only slightly from the effects of the alcohol.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Main street and the square are mostly empty and quiet. Rio spots a few of Westview’s residents mingle about: a family of three sit at one of the outdoor seating tables on the lawn leading up to the town square’s stage and gazebo, eating cones of ice-cream no doubt purchased from the ice cream parlor. A middle aged couple sits on a bench on the edge of the sidewalk and grass, lost in conversation. There was also a group of teenagers taking turns between skateboarding and recording themselves for whatever current trending social media hashtag. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they continue to pass the gazebo, Rio slows her pace to a halt in front of the community board. Agatha, realizing she is now a couple steps ahead, stops and turns. Rio gestures to the newly hanged flyer. “Spots opened for the talent show next month,” she summarizes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you hiding a special talent that you want to enter?” Agatha teases.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The memory escapes her before Rio realizes what she is saying. “My older sisters and I entered when I was six,” she explains. “We formed our own three girl rock band. Well, I guess not so much ‘we.’ A friend of theirs dropped out last minute and I was itching for any excuse to beat the living daylights out of that drum set.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you win?” Agatha, with piqued curiosity, now asks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Second place,” Rio grumbles, unearthing the same disbelief emotion from all those years ago. “Who the hell votes </span>
<em>
<span>against</span>
</em>
<span> a </span>
<em>
<span>six year old child</span>
</em>
<span> playing the drums?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Probably the same people actually listening to that very six year old child playing the drums,” Agatha answers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gasps, a tiny bit over the top (whether that’s the after effect of the last couple of shots or genuine displeasure is anyone’s guess). “You wound me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorts before returning to give attention to a detail of Rio’s memory. “Do your sisters still live here in Westview, too?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio replies instantaneously, keeping her eyes focused on the flyer - a fixed point to concentration on as she weaves through soft memories and the immense self inflicted guilt they carry, even after all this time, that causes her heart to beat painfully loud and fast in her chest.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Clearing her throat, a small and pathetic act to try to dispel nerves insisting of growing the pit of anxiousness in her stomach, Rio questions in hopes of a distraction, “Have you or Nicky ever entered?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Speaking of voting against six year olds..” Agatha grumbles, crossing her arms over her chest. “Well, a five year old in a magician suit and his pet rabbit he struggled to even get into a top hat. You missed a good show last year.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The thought of this little boy in costume with Señor Scratchy is enough to banish previous and lingering self inflicted dreaded emotions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> “Wait, a </span>
<em>
<span>magician</span>
</em>
<span> suit?” Rio repeats, calamitous sensations vanishing. “No way! That level of adorableness had got to be a shoe in!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean, personally, I think Nicky’s performance was an absolute masterpiece,” Agatha shrugs, not addressing her clear bias. “He didn’t even place - asshole judges.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio puffs her cheeks out, shaking her head at such travesty. “Asshole judges..” she repeats, voicing her own agreement. “They haven’t changed one bit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s laugh, along with her arm that now links into Rio’s, turns that anxious pit in her stomach into fluttering butterflies. Although they are only linked for a couple of strides, just enough to clear and leave the community board behind them, the butterflies remain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The rest of the walk doesn’t take them long - a right off of main street, followed by a couple of blocks. Agatha makes a comment about getting coffee </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> steps most mornings under her breath as they take the few porch steps leading to the front door. Rio comes to a stop next to her, parallel to the door. Her self imposed task is complete.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio can’t help feeling the tiniest bit of disappointment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wants more time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t want this to be over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wants more time with Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This is me,” Agatha says, vaguely gesturing around the front porch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, so we’re </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> ding dong ditching a random neighbor. Damn,” Rio sighs. A faint goofy smile plays on her lips when Agatha rolls her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha fishes her house key from her pants pocket. “Actually the principal's house is a few doors up that way - the one with all the flower beds” she informs, pointing up the street.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio bits back a nervous laugh, brought forth in knowing that her boss is only a stone throw away. “I’ll keep that in my back pocket,” she acknowledges. “I mean, if I were to ever need such information.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You let me know the moment she even </span>
<em>
<span>thinks</span>
</em>
<span> about denying your vegetable garden project and we’ll set Scratchy loose on those petunias,” Agatha states firmly, accented by a sharp, confident nod. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The laugh that escapes Rio this time is softer, more genuine. She tilts her head down, loose strands of hair fall forward - all a ruse to hide her smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The gentle touch against her chin takes her by surprise. With the tip of her fingers, Agatha lifts her face until their eyes meet. “Come on, if I earned that smile, don’t I have the right to at least see it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Rio mumbles, still smiling as her cheeks begin to flush, but she doesn’t pull back from the tender touch. She allows for Agatha to look her over, to take her in.  “Can I ask you something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm,” Agatha grants.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The question hovers on the tip of her tongue, begging to be released. The hammering of Rio’s heart, mixed with the still fluttering churning of her stomach claws to hold it back, but in the end, it comes out as a quiet whisper, “Can I kiss you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t answer right away, but Rio wouldn’t call it a hesitation. No, instead, Agatha continues to take her in. She meets Rio eyes with such an intense stare, as if trying to </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> see into her - into her intentions and thoughts. Agatha takes a step around Rio, who follows, never breaking their gaze. Still waiting for a response, Rio’s back is now parallel to the front door of the Harkness residence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When the answer does come, Agatha’s voice is low and slow. “I would very much like that, but..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But...?” Rio’s whisper is horsed, painful. Her heart drops into her stomach, both at the implied rejection and humiliation for even asking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But I’m afraid that if you do,” Agatha continues, taking a step closer to the younger woman who also takes a step back. Rio’s back pushes against the door with a soft, surprised ‘oof.’ Agatha can’t help but smirk. She takes another. Their bodies now barely an inch apart. They were so close.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With not much room to, Agatha leans her head forward. Rio can feel her breath against her skin. “I’m going to want </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> much more,” Agath admits.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you want?” Rio inquires, but she’s met with silence. Agatha’s breath, she can feel, is shaky. A clicking of an unlocking door pulls Rio’s attention away. She glances down to see Agatha had reached past her to insert her house key into the lock. The small act, hiding intentions that Rio assumes Agath has, bolds her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice grows stronger. “Tell me what you want, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It is no longer a question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”I want to kiss you,” Agatha finally answers, the statement escaping her quickly, no longer able to be held back. “Then..” Agatha’s voice trails off as her blue eyes dart between Rio’s lips and eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then..?” Rio repeats in anticipation, voice once again hushed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then, I want to push you through that front door, drag you up the stairs to my bedroom,” Agatha states, emboldened once more. A sigh escapes Rio when she feels Agatha’s knee press in between her legs. Agatha places the palm of her hands against the now  unlocked front door, between Rio’’s head. “And then I want to do something that I have been thinking about every single morning when you’ve boldly and confidently called out those ridiculous names written on those coffee cups.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio frowns slightly and her eyebrows furrow in confusion. Agatha’s been thinking about something for weeks now? Because of Rio’s morning antics?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Which is..?” she asks, her voice trailing off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I want to fuck you sensely until it’s my </span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span> name you call out,” Agatha says. Her lips hover, barely touching Rio, who swears she feels the whisper of them brushing against hers. “Now, </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> tell </span>
<em>
<span>me.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swallows hard, her mouth suddenly very dry. Agatha lifts her knee, bringing herself closer to Rio. Rio’s breath hitches and she desperately searches for her voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you want, Rio?” Agatha repeats when she takes too long to supply an answer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A sigh escapes Rio. The warmth against Agatha’s skin turns the corners of her lips into a smirk. Rio swallows again and she wills herself to speak, just barely above a whisper. “I </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> want you to kiss me,” Rio admits. “And I </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> want you to make good on your word.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everything next happens quickly. With a shared mutual consent made explicit, Rio barely registers Agatha’s eyes growing dark, pupils blown with want as their lips crash hungrily against each other. Rio hands snake their way up Agatha’s body until they’re cupping her jaw. Her thumb tenderly stroke’s the other woman’s cheek as Rio leans further into the kiss, willing herself to lip and taste every last inch of Agatha’s mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s right arm wraps around Rio’s lower back and pulls her closer, away from the door. Her left turns the knob and pushes it open, allowing for the both of them to stumble through the threshold, neither stepping away from the other’s mouth or relenting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Perhaps they should, especially facing the climb up the stairs to the second floor, but bad judgment and their shared desire get the better of them. Knowing the lay of the land - knowing these stairs in particular, Agatha’s hold on Rio grows more firm and protective; she be damned to let the younger woman either break from the kiss or fall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s not sure which would be more devastating.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They separate once Agatha leads them into the master bedroom. They break apart, panting and trying to catch breath. Curiosity getting the better of her, Rio glances around the room, taking in her new surroundings: a king size bed pristinely made, two nightstands (one clearly more in use than the other), and a dresser across from the foot of the bed home to a moderately sized television. There are also two other closed doors - Rio assumes a closet and a bathroom. Everything getting to this spot is a blur. She meets Agatha’s eye and nods slowly. “So, um, great tour of the first flo-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before Rio can finish, Agatha speaks up, interrupts, “I swear, I’ll bend you over the dresser if you keep up the smartass remarks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirks and then whines, “But </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> sounds fun - ahh!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hands on Rio’s hips, Agatha pushes her towards the bed. When the back of her knees collide with the edge of the mattress, Rio tumbles backpacks and a surprised squeak escapes her. She tries to sit up, but Agatha is immediately on top of her, knees on either side of her hips. She pushes Rio back onto the mattress and pins her hands above her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you always so mouthy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Think you can find ways to shut me up,” Rio challenges, bucking her hips against a deviously smirking Agatha finding the invitation most welcoming. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For the rest of their early evening and into the late night, time moves both too slowly and vanishes in a blink of an eye - there’s plenty of it and not enough. They peel and pull away at layers of clothing, scattering them around the room. Skin against skin, they explore their new uncharted, warm territories - kissing, licking, and sucking little marks along the way as if to leave a trail - evident of a completed exploration, one that is retaken again and again and again over the course of their evening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She gets what her way and her very clearly expressed wants over and over and over again throughout the night: Rio, voice taunt and desperate, calling out her name with each and every orgasm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha Rio’s, of course (Rio already knows she will never tire from hearing it).</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sudden shrill of an unfamiliar ringtone immediately pulls Rio away from sleep. Confused and unsure of where she even is, Rio lifts her head from where she rested nearly face down against the pillow that isn’t her own. She squints through the darkness as the form next to her shuffles and scoots over towards the edge of the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There’s a sound of a plastic phone case scraping against wood and then the dim lighting of the phone illuminates Agatha’s face. The events that led to this very moment all come flooding back to Rio: the coffee shop, the happy hour, the walk back to Agatha’s, and, well, the sex. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s Wanda. It’s almost 3 in the morning,” Agatha murmurs, sitting up. They were asleep only for a couple of hours - maybe three at most. She brings her phone up to her ear. “Hey, what’s wrong? What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The panic in her voice is familiar to Rio - it’s the same tone Agatha had answered her own call Friday during the school day. What Rio wasn’t able to see with her own call, however, is the physical toll such a flare causes in Agatha. Her body is tense, ridged with the anticipation of what awaits her on the other end of that phone call. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolls over onto her side to better observe Agatha and she props herself up on her elbow. A part of her - nearly every part of her, honestly - wants to pull herself closer, to sit at her side, wrap her arms around the other woman, and maybe even place tiny, soft kisses on the bare skin of her shoulders in an attempt to get her to relax.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t act on those thoughts. Maybe they’re too intimate, too sweet - or even overstepping an unknown boundary. Rio doesn’t want to overstep, so she stays still and she listens to the one side of the conversation she has privy to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, no, it’s okay,” Agatha replies. She clears her throat to try to rid herself of the sleep in her tone. “He’s not feeling well, I’ll come get him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio frowns.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Tell him — Nicky, baby, hi,” Agatha says, her voice softening. “Hey, it’s okay. I’ll be there as soon as I can.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Oh, poor Nicky. Rio’s heart aches for the little boy; she can’t even imagine what Agatha must be feeling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I love you, too. I’m leaving in five minutes - bye, my love,” Agatha promises, now reaching over to turn on the lamp on her nightstand. Rio watches in continued silence, admiring the way Agatha’s naked body moves, twists, and stretches.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With the phone call ended, Rio gently asks, “What’s wrong?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s shoulders fall when she meets Rio’s gaze. “Wanda said he woke up with a headache and a low grade fever. He isn’t feeling well,” she explains.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”And he wants to come home,” Rio fills in the blanks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nods and allows for a beat of silence to pass between them before attempting to continue , “And, Rio, I’m sorry, but..“ she trails off, frowning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I know. It’s okay,” Rio reassures, now sitting up herself. The shoulders falling. The silence heavy with worry and disappointment. The frown that Agatha wears.  She easily understands what the other woman struggles to say. “I can’t be here when he comes back - you don’t need to apologize.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Within limits</span>
</em>
<span>, she recalls Agatha saying at the cafe yesterday morning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll give you a ride back to your place-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”I don’t want to keep you, I can walk,” Rio interrupts as they both detangle themselves from the sheets. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s three in the morning,” Agatha repeats.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”It’s Westview - what’s going to happen?” Rio asks, swinging her legs over the edge of the bed. She leans over to reach for her haphazardly discarded clothes from the floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More than you think. I’m driving you,” Agatha says from behind her as she stands, her protective tone filled with a finality that marks this is not up for further discussion. Agatha knows </span>
<em>
<span>exactly</span>
</em>
<span> what </span>
<em>
<span>could </span>
</em>
<span>happen. She’s defended those people in court.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha adds, “It’s </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> turn to be chivalrous.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t protest. If driving a few minutes out of her way gives Agatha some peace of mind during this bout of chaos, then Rio will gladly give it to her. It’s the least she could do - perhaps the only thing she really can do. She doesn’t know how else she could potentially be of any further help. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Both dressed - Rio in the attire Agatha tore off her hours ago and Agatha in purple sweatpants (did they.. say ‘naughty’ across her ass?) and an old, faded t-shirt - they shuffle their way out of the bedroom, down the stairs, and to the garage in an uneasy silence that Rio reminds herself is not of their own doing. This is not how either of them envisioned the night going. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t ask about the sweatpants.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She desperately wants to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not the time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They climb into Agatha’s black Mercedes, both still not saying a word. Agatha’s mind must be running a mile a minute; Rio doesn’t wish to intrude. Agatha doesn’t ask for directions, but Rio immediately notices she’s driving them towards the coffee shop. Once it comes into view, Rio gives her directions - just a couple blocks up the street, and then a right turn. The car comes to a stop in front of the three-story brick facade apartment building. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio unclicks the seatbelt and turns towards Agatha who is already staring at her. Rio can’t exactly put her finger on </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span>, but her stomach ties itself into a tight knot when she meets those piercing, fierce blue eyes. She catches them glancing those towards her lips and again to her own dark eyes - a silent question that needs no verbal answer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Rio begins to lean over the armrest that separates the two of them, Agatha’s right hand leaves the steering wheel and reaches out towards her face, gently sliding around to the back of her neck. Agatha, leaning forward, also pulls her closer. Their lips meet in a soft, tender kiss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rests her forehead against Rio and sighs, “I owe you breakfast.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Or,” Rio begins, stealing a quick peck of a kiss against Agatha’s lips once more. “You can let me know when </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> are home safe and we’ll call it even.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s </span>
<em>
<span>late</span>
</em>
<span> - hell, early, even, depending on your definition - and you have to be at work in a couple hours,” Agatha points out, her thumb caressing the nape of Rio’s neck which causes her to shiver.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fortunately, I have a steady stream of caffeine at work because, you know, it’s a </span>
<em>
<span>coffee shop</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio remarks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Smartass.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckles, going against her desire to remain as close to Agatha as possible. She pulls away, scooting closer to the passenger side door and Agatha’s hand returns to the steering wheel. “Besides, it’s a half shift - plenty of time to nap after,” Rio explains, hand on the door handle. “And I’ll refuse to go back to sleep until you text.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Pain</span>
</em>
<span> in the ass,” Agatha amends with a glare, one that doesn’t last too long. It softens as she gives in. “Fine, I will.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Great</span>
</em>
<span> ass,” Rio corrects, pulling on the handle of the door and opening it slightly ajar. “And thank you - in advance for letting me know and for today. Well, yesterday, I guess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Good..” Agatha’s voice trails off for a second as she hesitates. “Well, night, I guess? Morning?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, good whatever-the-hell-this-is. </span>
<em>
<span>Te veo</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha,” Rio grins with a shoulder shrug, pushing the door fully open and climbing out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She walks towards the entrance of the apartment, perhaps a tiny bit slower than usual to give Agatha a view of one of her finer assets. Rio </span>
<em>
<span>knows</span>
</em>
<span> she has to be watching. She can hear the car idling behind her. It’s not until Rio unlocks the main door and pulls it open that she hears the car drive away from the curb.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha waited until she was inside - a small gesture that makes Rio’s heart swell as she begins climbing the stairs to the third floor. She’s in trouble, she knows, but with the excitement of the chaos lulling, Rio is too tired to dwell on those particular thoughts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As expected, the apartment is silent and Rio does her best to keep it that way as she moves through the living room and to the kitchen to fetch herself a bottle of water to take with her in retreat to her own bedroom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The now two nights of less than stellar sleep catches up with her; Rio just wants to forego everything and collapses into bed, but she knows how quickly she’ll fall asleep if she does. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And she rather not miss Agatha’s text.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So, instead, she rummages through her dresser for anything deemed pajama worthy. She settles on a pair of dark shorts and a very loose fitting white tank top. After checking on the various plants scattered around the room, she drags herself to the bathroom, ignoring the sweet, sweet call of her soft pillows and warm comforter, knowing that their time together is fleeting with each passing moment. She’s killing time until her phone finally lights up with a message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her phone vibrates twice in her hand. Rio finally gives herself permission to turn off the overhead light in the room, leaving only the soft glow of the lamp on her nightstand. Rio falls into the comfort of her bed and checks her messages.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sees the shaky, slightly blurry picture of Agatha lying in a small bed with a sleeping Nicky curled close against her chest. Underneath the image is a text.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Already feeling better. Medicine kicked in. Insisted on not sleeping alone and, well, my room is not currently suitable for.. reasons.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirks to herself and instantly writes back: </span>
<em>
<span>Sorry for being “reasons”. Glad he’s feeling better. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Part* of the reasons - don’t take all the credit. It was clearly a team effort.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Then, I’m happy to have been part of the team.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio, go to SLEEP.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Can’t. This really,  REALLY hot woman keeps texting me. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Good. Night. Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Good. Morning. Agatha.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Smartass. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, I’m sorry, am I being too ~Naughty~ for you?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Put your phone down, menace. S l e e p. (They’re REALLY comfortable sweatpants for the record.)</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a chuckle filled with the built up two day’s worth of exhaustion that is ready to drag her into the land of dreams, for however short her stay would be to her extreme disappointment, Rio places her phone on its charger on her nightstand and turns off the lamp, shrouding the room in darkness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rolls onto her side, pulling the covers close to her chest. Her eyes only close for a few, short moments before springing open again, the realization of a heavy grievance pulls her a bit further away from her return to sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Rio’s eyes shoot open as the realization hits her hard. She rolls onto her back, frustrated. Balling her hands into firsts, she hits them against the mattress that is followed by a loud groan of annoyance. “I didn’t even meet Señor Scratchy.”</span>

<p>The alarm screeching from Rio’s phone two hours after falling asleep in her own bed is the most veil sound in the history of mankind - since the beginning of time, Rio is certain. She’s never been more certain about anything in her life. She wants to grab the hellish device, chuck it out her third floor bedroom window, and hide under her comforter for the rest of.. forever, if she’s being serious.</p><p> </p><p>If she were to be realistic, it would be for the rest of the morning.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to be realistic. </p><p> </p><p>She wants to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Five and a half hours to go, she reminds herself as she sits up in bed. That’s all she has to be a functioning human being for on this Sunday. It’s not an incredibly tall ask, but Rio’s going to bemoan every single second of it.</p><p> </p><p>Five hours to go, Rio clocks in in the back office where Jen greets her and asks how the rest of <em> yesterday </em>went. Rio plays dumb and says fine. She doesn’t have the energy to read into anything or be interrogated. </p><p> </p><p>Four hours to go, Rio finishes her double espresso splashed with oat milk. Oat milk is growing on her.</p><p> </p><p>Three hours to go, she contemplates having another double shot. She wonders if the heart palpitations are worth the risk - the four shots <em> did </em> get her through yesterday just fine. Yes, it was entirely the caffeine. Definitely not spending time with Agatha. She wonders how Agatha is doing. And Nicky.</p><p> </p><p>Two hours to go, Agatha texts her to check in. Distracted, Rio spills hot milk down her front. At least it’s not scalding. She <em> really </em> wants to go back to bed. She forgets to text back.</p><p> </p><p>One hour to go, Rio cleans and wipes down the different stations and does the last of the dishes.</p><p> </p><p>At 11am, sweet freedom welcomes her. The walk back to the apartment building is the length of a marathon. The stairs? She might as well be climbing a mountain. The unit is empty. She can’t remember if Alice told her about any plans or if she is meant to join them - Alice would’ve stopped by the cafe if that were the case. </p><p> </p><p>Either way, Rio appreciates the silence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kicks the door close behind her as she finally responds to Agatha’s message from a couple hours ago (<em> Hoping you aren’t feeling too rough this morning </em>.)</p><p> </p><p><em> Pretty sure this is what death vaguely feels like. I just got back home </em>, Rio texts back as she crosses the living room to get to the hallway. She tosses her phone onto her bed and retreats to the bathroom to refresh and get rid of the damned milk covered jeans. </p><p> </p><p>Back in the pajamas she reluctantly abandoned this morning, Rio falls fast first onto her bed and sighs heavily against the comforter. Her entire body, muscles aching from the sheer exhaustion, relaxes against the mattress. She could fall asleep right here, just like this. </p><p> </p><p>She probably shouldn’t. </p><p> </p><p>She won’t.</p><p> </p><p>With a disgruntled groan, Rio pulls and scoots herself up the bed, until her head is aligned with one of three pillows and then she rolls over onto her back, promptly right in the middle of the queen sized bed. She extends her arms out, waving them back and forth against the mattress until the tips of her fingers swipe over her phone.</p><p> </p><p>Grabbing it, the screen lights up with a message from Agatha. <em> I’m sorry again for the broken sleep. Get some rest </em>, it reads.</p><p> </p><p>Rio unlocks her phone and quickly taps out, <em> No need to apologize - not your fault. How are you fairing? The lil hot pocket? </em></p><p> </p><p>She snickers at herself for the dumb pet name for Nicky. Rio would give herself a high five if she had the energy to lift her arms. She does not.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha immediately sends back an eye rolling emoji.</p><p> </p><p>With a gleeful smirk, Rio deems her message a success.</p><p> </p><p><em> We are all doing fine </em>, Agatha’s reply comes through. It’s followed by a photograph, taken from Agatha’s vantage point. Still in pajamas, Nicky’s lying on his stomach, against Agatha’s stretched out legs, facing away from her and the camera that he’s completely oblivious to. His attention is on the television on the dresser parallel to the bed playing, from what Rio gathers, some sort of Disney movie. She couldn’t tell you which one; she isn’t well versed in them - didn’t grow up watching them.</p><p> </p><p>Something with fish, though, based off what she sees in the sent picture.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes trail to the lower right corner of the photo, to the back of a furry white blurr with specks of light brown on Agatha’s lap.</p><p> </p><p><em> AGATHA HARKNESS </em>.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh, you’re right. Please accept my sincerest apologies, I didn’t mean to send such a lewd picture.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sends another with the same composition with Scratchy no longer in sight and Nicky is looking over his shoulder towards his mother and the camera, now confused and uninterested in the movie playing in the background.</p><p> </p><p> Rio huffs at the thought of the wretched Brussels sprouts from the previous day. </p><p> </p><p><em> I sacrificed good taste buds to see that rabbit </em>, she texts back.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Listen. Scratchy can sense the mere thought of a camera. Consider yourself lucky you got a blurry shot of his behind. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha quickly sends off another message, <em> And that you got to see the.. other rabbit. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio sends a string to crying face emojis, followed by: <em> (I am very lucky, but STILL, AGATHA) </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> He’s under the bed; he’s not coming out any time soon.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio can send another obnoxious amount of emojis, Agatha informs her, <em> Nicky has gone under the bed to try to coax him out, but I think I’m just going to have two boys under the bed. </em></p><p> </p><p>A beat.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Yeah, Nicky just declared them co-Kings of the Kingdom of the Land of Dust Bunnies. Sounds like they have that fortress on lockdown. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorts, smiling at herself at the sweet scenery she is missing out on. <em> Maybe you should vacuum more - can’t have a dust bunny kingdom if there aren’t any dust bunnies. </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> Go take a nap, Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Monday morning comes way too quickly for Rio’s liking, even more so when she convinces herself the night prior that she needs to come in earlier than expected to wrap up her lesson plans for the week for her mentor to look over before the start of the school day. </p><p> </p><p>Alice drops her off at the front of the elementary school before taking both herself and the car to Westview High. </p><p> </p><p>Barely 7:15am.</p><p> </p><p>Rio scans her ID badge, granting her access to enter via the main office. She greets the secretary with a half nod - a silent good morning between colleagues still struggling to wake up and begging for the caffeine to kick in any second now. </p><p> </p><p>But Rio doesn’t need caffeine, not when she comes to the end of the hallway and turns the corridor to the first grade wing to find a parent hovering just outside of her classroom door. A rush of energy waves over her once she realizes that it’s a deep purple business suit wearing Agatha, waiting with a water paper bag in hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, in her black slacks and green blouse, feels a little underdressed.</p><p> </p><p>Hearing Rio’s footsteps, Agatha turns around and grins when she sees that it’s her - just the person she is waiting for. “Good morning,” she greets.</p><p> </p><p>“Morning,” Rio responds, albeit with some hesitation. “Is everything alright, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods and holds up the paper bag, “I owe you breakfast, remember?”</p><p> </p><p>The tension in Rio’s shoulders ease; the worry she carries about Agatha or Nicky not feeling well dissipates. A soft smile takes over Rio’s facial features as she steps around Agatha to unlock her classroom door and push it open. She holds it for Agatha to step inside.</p><p> </p><p>Rio follows suit, flicking on the lights, and locking the door behind her. Agatha takes notice. She raises an eyebrow at the younger woman.</p><p> </p><p>”Just in case,” Rio murmurs, walking over to her desk only a few feet away. Agatha follows after her. Rio gestures towards her office chair. She herself perches against the edge of her desk.</p><p> </p><p>”Just in case <em> what </em>?” Agatha challenges, smirking as she takes the offered seat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio flushes and clears her throat, “You didn’t have to do that - bring breakfast.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs, “It’s just bagels and not even great ones at that. It’s also the least I can do after making you go home at 3 in the morning.” Pulling out a wrapped bagel from the bag. Agatha offers it to her. “Plus, it gives me an excuse to see you again.”</p><p> </p><p>Unwrapping the plain bagel and cream cheese, Rio lowers her head in an attempt to hide her sheepish smile. “Well, then, thank you,” she murmurs. After a beat, her head snaps up as the realization hits her. “Hang on, wait-“</p><p> </p><p>”Wait?” Agatha repeats, leaning back in the office chair, confused as she unwraps her own bagel. “For what?”</p><p> </p><p>”What’s the difference between a rabbit and a bunny?” Rio questions, dead serious. “There <em> is </em> no difference, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha throws her head back and laughs.</p><p> </p><p>”No, <em> seriously, </em> Agatha,” Rio speaks over her, fighting back a giggle over her own. Agatha’s laugh is infectious. “Nicky <em> will </em> ask me. He gave me <em> homework </em>.” </p><p> </p><p>“And Ms. Vidal failed to complete the homework? Sounds like that means no recess,” Agatha teases, licking the excess cream cheese running along the edge of the bagel. </p><p> </p><p>The sight makes Rio’s mouth grow dry; a pit forms in her stomach. She swallows hard and shakes her head, willing the not so work appropriate thoughts away. “There’s no difference,” she states again.</p><p> </p><p>”Right, no difference,” Agatha confirms, crossing her legs. She rips off a piece of bagel. “But ‘bunny’ sounds like a word a baby would use and he, as he will very adamantly tell and remind  you, is <em> not </em> a baby.”</p><p> </p><p>”So, what do I tell him?” Rio asks, frowning. “I can’t imagine that’s an answer he wants to hear, especially if potentially surrounded by some of his own peers.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs, popping a bit into her mouth and speaking around the piece, “You’ll figure it out, I’m sure.”</p><p> </p><p>”Thanks for the help,” Rio mutters in disbelief. She <em> will </em>come up with something, that much she knows, and it might as well be on the spot - something that she will not overthink. Something is bound to come to her. </p><p> </p><p>“Happy to offer it - speaking of which,” Agatha begins. “The PTA - or the school - I don’t remember. The emails are very similar. Anyway, whoever sent out a message about the first grade field trip in two weeks.”</p><p> </p><p>Ah, yes, their trip to Westview’s little botanical garden - a tie in to their current science unit. The kids were already buzzing with excitement for their excursion outside of school during school hours. It is mostly because they get to ride the school bus like the big middle school kids for once. </p><p> </p><p>These kids.. always wishing to be older, to be more grown up. Rio wishes they could hold onto their own innocence for as long as they can; there’s no need nor rush to become an adult. It’s not as cracked up as they make it out to be while young.</p><p> </p><p>Instead of voicing a response, Rio nods in confirmation.</p><p> </p><p>”And it states that parental chaperones were needed,” Agatha continues. “Usually, I would <em> never </em> offer my services. Frankly, there are only three kids that I willingly keep an eye on, but.. considering that they’re all three in the first grade and that I am.. quite fond of a particular teacher. I’m thinking of throwing my name into the ring - with Nicky’s permission, of course.” </p><p> </p><p>“I..” Rio’s voice trails off, her mind still stuck on <em> quite fond of a particular teacher </em>. She knows this about Agatha - her desire to make these little comments that knock the wind out of Rio. Rio, usually, can stand her ground, even if the flushing out of her facial features gives her away. </p><p> </p><p>But here at school? It’s an uneven playing field, one that Agatha recognizes and uses in her teasing nature and advantage. She knows Rio will try not to react.</p><p> </p><p>“Umm, do you want <em> me </em> to put your name down? Or -“</p><p> </p><p>”I’ll email whoever once Nicky gives me the green light,” Agatha answers, taking another bite. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s is still on her desk, untouched. She’s too distracted to eat.</p><p> </p><p>”Thanks - I think Mrs. Maximoff is helping out, too.” </p><p> </p><p>“Of <em> course </em>, Wanda is,” Agatha finds herself grumbling as she finishes off the top half of the bagel. </p><p> </p><p>Frowning, Rio tilts her head and asks, “Are you sure you two are friends?” </p><p> </p><p>“Best of, unfortunately,” Agatha sighs dramatically. “Seriously, though, when push comes to shove, I <em> know </em> Wanda will out mamma bear any one of those other assho-“</p><p> </p><p>”Language.” </p><p> </p><p>“Dicks-“</p><p> </p><p>”That’s not any better, Agatha,” Rio groans with a chuckle. “See, this is why I locked the door.” </p><p> </p><p>“And here I thought I was getting a private session with Ms. Vidal,” Agatha sighs, wrapping the rest of the bagel for later. “Though, as a second thought, I don’t really mind the reprimanding.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is a mystery, one that Rio <em> wants </em> to solve, but there’s a complexity behind her that leaves her, well, mystified.</p><p> </p><p>”You’re incorrigible,” Rio says, folding her arms over her chest as she shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>”Come on, don’t you prefer me horizon-“</p><p> </p><p>”Don’t finish that thought,” Rio interrupts.</p><p> </p><p>”Why?” Agatha asks, leaning forward and looking up to meet Rio’s gaze. She now hovers just above Rio’s lap. “Afraid I’m right?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio isn’t afraid; Rio is well aware that Agatha is very much right.</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio can respond, there’s a knock on the classroom door, followed by the sound of the locked doorknob turning, but refusing to grant access. The sound makes both women jump slightly, but only Rio hops up onto her feet. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a second knock just as Rio grabs the door knob and pulls it open for Lilia who takes a step inside. Her lips thin when she spots Agatha pulling herself up onto her feet from Rio’s office chair.</p><p> </p><p>”Ms. Vidal, our doors are to remain unlocked during school hours,” she chastises. “You know the rules.”</p><p> </p><p>”Yes, Ms. Calderu, I know - must’ve forgotten to keep it unlocked on my way in,” Rio quickly explains. “Honest mistake.”</p><p> </p><p>”Let’s ensure it doesn’t happen again, hmm?”</p><p> </p><p>”Always a stickler for the rules. Technically,” Agatha begins, making her way over to the two women. “School hours start at 8am. It’s a little before 7:30. My client is innocent, Honorable Judge Calderu.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia looks Agatha over and shakes her head, “You haven’t changed one bit, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>”And neither have you, Calderu,” Agatha replies, inching towards the door. “I was just on my way out. Ms. Vidal, thank you for listening to my concerns.”</p><p> </p><p>”Yes, you're welcome,” Rio murmurs. “Let me walk you out.”</p><p> </p><p>”<em> Chivalrous </em> , this one,” Agatha comments. “The district should be <em> very </em> proud of this hire - give her a raise <em> immediately </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Biting back a smile, Rio rolls her eyes, shaking her head.</p><p> </p><p>If only the promotion process were <em> that </em> easy.</p><p> </p><p>“Hurry back, Ms. Vidal - we have our Monday morning meeting,” Lilia reminds. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods and then follows Agatha out into the hallway, retracing the steps she took this morning on her way in. They step off the curb together and cross into the parking lot, with Agatha fishing her keys out of her blazer pocket.</p><p> </p><p>”Thank you for the breakfast,” Rio says, breathlessly, once they reach the familiar black Mercedes. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha waves a dismissive hand and unlocks the door with her other, “No need to thank me, really.” She pulls the door open. “Though, I am sorry it was rushed - there’s more that I wanted to talk about.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh? What about?” Rio asks, trying not to sound surprised.</p><p> </p><p>”Not here, not now,” Agatha answers with a finality that does not allow for further questioning, especially now that their time has no short. “Nicky has soccer practice at 6 this evening at the high school, if you’re willing to join. It usually lasts an hour.”</p><p> </p><p>A soft ‘oh’ escapes Rio once again as the invitation takes her by surprise. “Um, yeah, I can be there, but would it be a little odd if I showed up..?” </p><p> </p><p>“In the conquest of the Kingdom of the Dust Bunnies yesterday, it.. may have come up that we are..” Agatha’s voice trails off as she glances Rio up and down. “That we’re <em> friends </em>.” </p><p> </p><p>“Friends,” Rio repeats, slowly as to enunciate the word. A smile threatens to tug at the corner of her lips once more this morning. “Now, why do you say that with such displeasure?” </p><p> </p><p>“Because I don’t necessarily make it a point to fuck my friends,” Agatha remarks without missing a beat.</p><p> </p><p>The forceful, blatant response chokes Rio. She coughs roughly into a clenched fists and immediately looks around their surroundings for any potential eavesdroppers. The parking lot is still relatively empty, thankfully.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks rather gleefully because <em> of course she does </em>. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you feeling alright there, Ms. Vidal?” Agatha asks, bemused. “You know, I was just thinking: the morning air is starting to get a little crispier, isn’t it? Wouldn’t want you to catch anything now.”</p><p> </p><p>The joke’s on Agatha - Rio’s already caught something, indeed, but Rio keeps that particular feeling to herself.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll see you this evening, Ms. Harkness,” she manages.</p><p> </p><p>–</p><p> </p><p>Alice lends her the car for the evening; it didn’t take much convincing, not after Rio willingly reveals her invitation for the soccer practice. Alice claimed that she was doing her part “in getting this ship sailing” - those were her direct words - right before insisting that Rio could have the car whenever, if it meant updated details. </p><p> </p><p>She was too invested in this.</p><p> </p><p>The soccer field is behind the school, Rio drives along the perimeter of the grounds until she reaches the sports fields’ parking lot. The spots near the fence entrance are already taken, claimed by parents and their children who arrived early and not at 6:05 (Rio lost track of time, unsure what to wear; the clock pressured her into a simple pair of dark jeans and her alumnae university sweater - the laundry situation is dire, she realized).</p><p> </p><p>Rio parks a row over, kills the ignition, and scrambles out of the car. Agatha’s words from their date echoing in her mind: I don’t tolerate tardiness.</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, but she didn’t say it <em> this </em> time, Rio points out to herself. It doesn’t stop her from jogging up to and squeezing through the gate. She scans the group of parents standing on the sidelines and then over to the ones sitting on the bleachers. </p><p> </p><p>Not a Harkness in sight.</p><p> </p><p>Fallen shoulders spring back up hearing a voice - an adult, rather unexpectedly - call out, “Ms. Vidal!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns her attention back to the parents standing along the edge of the field. A redhead in black leggings and red flannel waves her over. </p><p> </p><p>“Mrs. Maximoff,” Rio greets, approaching the woman. She reaches out for a handshake. “It’s good to see you again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha and Nicky are running late,” Wanda explains, keeping her eye on the twins running among the children on the field. “They were having issues with Sca– boys!” Wanda raises her voice, addressing her children in a language that Rio doesn’t recognize.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Mom </em>!” Billy shouts back in surprise.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re <em> not </em> allowed to push them!” Tommy condons. </p><p> </p><p>“At least <em> try </em> to practice <em> speaking </em> Sokovian,” Wanda grumbles under her breath, offering an apologetic smile to the women standing within earshot to their right.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, recalling Agatha’s colorful, near complete sentiment regarding the woman deemed her best friend: if push comes to shove, Wanda will out mamma bear the rest of the other parents.</p><p> </p><p>“I was the same way their age with Spanish,” Rio shares. “Understanding was no problem. My parents talked to me consistently in Spanish. But speaking? I stubbornly refused until I was older.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Wanda laughs dryly. “What changes between now and then. Give me something to look forward to, please?”</p><p> </p><p>“They’ll realize how important it is to keep a connection like that with their family,” Rio answers softly with sincere honesty, eyes focused on the kids trying to steal the ball away from each other in small groups.</p><p> </p><p>“And what do they think of your Spanish now?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses, caught off guard by the question she doesn’t know how to address. Before she thinks of a way to evade answering all together, a blur of a small child runs between her and Wanda, dropping a water bottle on the grass at their feet.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda calls out to him, “Nicholas Harkness! Is that how you tell your favorite aunt ‘hello?’”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re my <em> only </em> aunt and I’m <em> late </em>, Aunt Wanda,” Nicky yells back, not bothering to look as he continues towards Billy and Tommy. “Scratchy hates the car!”</p><p> </p><p>“Scratchy..?” Rio repeats, eyebrows furrowing.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda turns towards the parking lot and calls out to the woman making her approach towards them, “Did you seriously bring the rabbit, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio follows Wanda’s lead. The moment her eyes land on a very dressed down Agatha (a completely different version from this morning), the wind is knocked out of Rio’s lungs, especially when she spots the brown spotted, white fur little creature curled against her chin. Was he wearing a harness? And, oh god, he had a <em> leash </em>?</p><p> </p><p>It takes everything in her willpower to not self combust.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I did,” Agatha confirms, stopping a couple of feet in front of them. With a coy smirk, as she continues to rub small little circles against Scratchy’s side, Agatha meets Rio’s gaze. “I am a woman of my word after all. Also, don’t take that tone with your god-rabbit,” she adds, turning to Wanda, now frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, <em> Christ </em>,” Wanda sighs, exacerbated. “There is no such thing as god-rabbits.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what <em> you </em> think,” Agatha snaps back, tilting her chin down to touch her chest so she can place a small kiss on the top of Scratchy’s head. He ducks a bit from the sudden movement, but escaping is not an option. His nose continues to twitch and his eyes dart around - Rio could die right here and right now from the cuteness overload. Whether it would be from the rabbit or Agatha is anyone’s guess. </p><p> </p><p>“But if anything happens to <em> me </em> ,” Agatha continues. “You’re getting <em> both </em> Nicky <em> and </em> Scratchy, Wands. I have an ironclad will and you’ll be stuck with <em> both </em> of my boys.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re ridiculous,” Wanda murmurs, shaking her head. The loud screech of a whistle pulls her attention back to the practice at hand. She yells out something once more in Sokovian.</p><p> </p><p>“So I’ve been told,” Agatha mumbles before turning to Rio. With the tilt of the head towards their left, she explains, “Let's go to the other end - people make him nervous, <em> especially </em>Maximoffs.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda doesn’t return her attention to the two other woman, but regardless she defends, “Tommy pulled his ear one time <em> on accident- </em>”</p><p> </p><p>“And one time was <em> enough </em> - the little heathen. Isn’t that right, Scratch?” Agatha asks the rabbit for confirmation. Scratchy only continues to wiggle his nose. “Come on.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t need to be told twice. </p><p> </p><p>She would follow Scratchy into battle, not to just the opposite end of the field’s bleacher. Agatha is the first to sit down on the first row - a good choice, considering Rio knows the rabbit doesn’t mind launching himself from at least the height of Agatha’s bed. Agatha shimmers the tote bag off her shoulder and onto the bench; Rio takes a seat next to it.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re going to have to bribe him with treats,” Agatha explains. She uses one hand to hold Scratchy in place against her chest and the other to blindly fish around the tote bag. “This asshole has been known to bite - he bit me yesterday morning after I realized I forgot to feed him dinner Saturday night.”</p><p> </p><p>She finds the small plastic bag containing thin apple slices and holds it out to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“And <em> he’s </em> the asshole?” Rio asks, pulling the bag open and grabbing one of the slices between her finger tips. She leans forward towards Scratchy and holds it up to him. The rabbit pushes away from Agatha’s chest and inspects the treat carefully before he begins to nibble. “I would have bitten you, too.” </p><p> </p><p>“You <em> did </em> bite me!” Agatha reminds, carefully moving Scratchy towards Rio, who cups him into her free, appleless, arm. </p><p> </p><p>Scratchy immediately leans into Rio’s body, confirming one very important thought: Rio would die for this god damn rabbit.</p><p> </p><p>“That same night,” Agatha continues. “You’re the reason I forgot-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t blame <em> me </em>!” Rio’s head snaps up at the unfinished accusation. She tilts her head back down towards the rabbit. “Scratchy, don’t listen to her,” she speaks now in a baby voice. “She’s already trying to destroy our friendship.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, “Don’t speak to him like a toddler - he’s more <em> dignified </em> than that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re right,” Rio agrees with a chuckle, fishing out another apple slice. “He’s a true gentleman.”</p><p> </p><p>A silence lulls between the two of them - well, three of them. They watch as Scratchy truly relaxes, nearly flops against Rio, as he finishes the second apple slice. Content, Rio gently begins to stroke the rabbit’s soft fur. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was right: he <em> is </em> a really fucking cute rabbit.</p><p> </p><p>“I owe you an apology,” Agatha speaks up, breaking the comfort of both the silence and the moment.</p><p> </p><p>“For trying to turn Scratchy against me?” Rio asks, too distracted to hear the seriousness in Agatha’s tone. “For calling him an asshole?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, an actual genuine apology,” Agatha clarifies.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up, confused.</p><p> </p><p>“I wanted to say this to you this morning,” Agatha continues. “But Lilia’s intrusion made me realize it wasn’t the best time. You had a whole work day to get through and it wouldn’t have been appropriate. Not my most brilliant move.”</p><p> </p><p>“But apologize for what, exactly?” Rio asks.</p><p> </p><p>“I.. “ Agatha begins slowly, carefully searching for the words as she looks Rio in the eye. Rio holds onto Scratchy a little bit tighter, trying to soak in all the grounding comfort the little guy is providing. ”While we were enjoying ourselves Saturday - at the bar, specifically - you alluded to something I couldn’t stop thinking about. I should have let it be, but.. I didn’t think anything would turn up because what are the odds?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice grows incredibly soft as she pushes again, “What do you mean..?” </p><p> </p><p>Blatantly and to the point as to no longer continue beating around the bush, Agatha blurts out, “I found the crime scene report from the accident.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </p><p>And there it is: the rug being pulled from underneath her (she’s glad she’s already sitting down); the stomach punch that leaves her breathless; the immediate stinging of her dark eyes. Rio immediately turns her head away from Agatha. She focuses on the kids now running up and down the field - no soccer ball in sight; she focuses on the soft fur underneath her finger tips; she focuses on not suddenly drowning.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha says gently. “I’m sorry. Truly.”</p><p> </p><p>A dry, short laugh escapes Rio before she can bite it back, “Sorry for losing my parents and sisters or sorry for looking it up?”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a beat of silence, a moment before Agatha asks in return, “Can it be both?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods slowly, keeping her eyes forward - keeping her gaze on the practice.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t go beyond that first page,” Agatha insists. “I know it wasn’t my right to find out this way. I won’t, however, apologize for also looking up the verdict after the fact because I needed to know-”</p><p> </p><p>“How good his criminal defense lawyer was?” Rio knows she sounds more bitey than intended; she knows none of this should be directed at Agatha. That, however, doesn’t stop her voice from being curt, laced with sharp edges as the scared little girl from <em> years </em> ago lashes out in a dormant, now reawakening fright.</p><p> </p><p>“That he got what he deserved,” Agatha states immediately and firmly. “There are plenty of times where you don’t want these people winning, Rio, but then you remember the oath you took.”</p><p> </p><p>“So then why do <em> you </em>do it?” Rio questions, an answer seeks from their shared Saturday together.</p><p> </p><p>“For the people who are truly innocent. Wrong place, wrong time, or things gone astray. I do it for the people who are <em> good </em> and need <em> help </em> getting others to see it,” Agatha explains. Rio still doesn’t look at her - she can’t. It’s taking every last ounce of herself to hold everything together.</p><p> </p><p>“But people like this guy?” Agatha continues. “Who leaves a six year old completely abandoned and orphaned? I’m glad to see he served out his life sentence.”</p><p> </p><p>The last sentence hangs in the air. Rio sits up a little bit straighter, eyebrows furrowing as she struggles to understand that string of words tied together. Frowning, she finally forces herself to turn to Agatha. There can be no trace of confusion.</p><p> </p><p>There <em> can’t </em> be <em> any </em> confusion.</p><p> </p><p>“Served out..?” she says, slowly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitates, desperately looking over the younger woman’s tense features as if meticulously trying to figure out how now to further cause her any harm. Instead, Agatha offers only the truth, “Rio, he passed away two years ago.”</p><p> </p><p>The dam immediately breaks, but Rio refuses to allow herself to be overcome right here, right now. Not in front of these kids and their parents - some of which were her own students and their parents. No, she wouldn’t permit it.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha tries again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio holds Scratchy out to Agatha who instantly scoops him back into her arms.</p><p> </p><p>“I need to go,” Rio all but whispers as she stands up and beelines for the parking lot. If Agatha calls after her, she doesn’t hear it; she can’t hear anything over the loud ringing in her ears, mixed with the sound of her rapid heart beating so painfully against her ribs, feeling as though it could explode at any moment.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t register her movements; she’s functioning on autopilot. She couldn’t tell you how she got into Alice’s beaten up Subaru, or how she managed to roar the engine into life, or pulling out of the sports area parking lot. </p><p> </p><p>No, the next moment Rio realizes where she is, she’s in front of the high school drop off area - at least even not in control, she has the good sense to not try to drive home.</p><p> </p><p>The loud, watery sob that escapes her, takes her by surprise. Rio crashes a hand against her mouth, trying to silence herself as tears cascade down her cheeks. With a shaking free hand, she grabs her phone from her pocket - nearly drops it into the abyss of the nooks and crannies of the console. </p><p> </p><p>Trembling fingers find the contact she seeks. Her call is answered on the second ring. She knows she can’t hide the emotion thick in her voice, so she doesn’t bother. All she says is, “Alice..”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Don’t you dare move. I’ll be right there </em>.”</p>

<p>“Where is she?” Alice demands, out of breath, as she jogs up to the car that Rio is leaning against. “I swear to god, Rio, I’ll knock some sense into her right here, right now - ow!”</p><p> </p><p>Alice grabs the stitch that radiates a sharp ache from her side and doubles over, wincing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, who had been leaning against the car with her arms crossed over her chest tightly, pushes herself away from the vehicle. She uses the back of her sleeve to wipe at her tear stained face as she stands over Alice, a hand on her back. “Are you okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Are <em> you </em>?” she pants, trying to catch her breath. “Did she hurt you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you run the entire way here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, did she <em> hurt </em> you?” Alice repeats in between breaths, evident that yes, she <em> did </em> run all the way here from the apartment. She stands up as straight as she can and stares at Rio, waiting for an answer - waiting to see what her next move should be. </p><p> </p><p>Oh, Alice, always the protector - <em> her </em>protector. </p><p> </p><p>Ever since their first group therapy session as rebellious preteens - both hurting in their own unique way, both pushing the limits of the boundaries set for them instead of by them.</p><p> </p><p>Swallowing the lump in her throat, Rio slowly shakes her head. Her bottom lip trembles and tears collect along the brim of her eyes once again. She tilts her chin down, trying to hide the visibility of being upset, but she knows it’s all for nothing. Alice, who reaches out and places a hand on Rio’s shoulder, already knows. There’s no hiding. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Alice says softly.</p><p> </p><p>”The driver’s dead,” Rio chokes the words out, followed by a heavy sigh masking another sob that threatens to escape. When she looks up at Alice, the tears fall and trail down her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>”The driver..?” Alice repeats, frowning, but the realization hits her a moment later. “Oh! <em> The </em> driver! Shit, Rio, I’m sorry - are you okay? Did they just call you?” </p><p> </p><p>“No, it was  years ago,” Rio struggles to verbalize. “<em> Two </em> years ago.”</p><p> </p><p>“And they’re just telling you now?” Alice, perplexed, asks. “That’s fucked up.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head, “<em> They </em>didn’t tell me anything.” </p><p> </p><p>Alice stares at her a moment longer and then begins to slowly shake her head as she pieces the metaphoric puzzle Rio gives her into place. “No,” she states firmly. “No, no, no, no - <em> that’s </em> fucked up. She looked you up? How would she even have acc—“</p><p> </p><p>”Can we not do this here?” Rio practically begs. “Their practice is about to end and I really don’t want to be here anymore, Al.” </p><p> </p><p>“Say less, then,” Alice sidesteps around Rio to grab the driver side’s door handle. “Let’s get out of here.”</p><p> </p><p>Much to Rio’s relief, the drive back home to the apartment is a silent one, though not as short as she hoped it would be. Alice insists on stopping at the grocery store for what she further insists are necessary items. Rio stays behind, curled up in the passenger seat, trying to hide from the world that seems just a bit too big. Too scary.</p><p> </p><p>She feels like she’s six years old all over again, waking up in the hospital to the life shattering news that she’s completely and utterly alone.</p><p> </p><p>Alice returns with a singular bag of ‘necessities’: two pints of rocky road ice cream, a bag of gummy worms, and double stuffed Oreos. The gesture makes Rio well up again.</p><p> </p><p>Once home, Alice hands her a plastic ziplock bag and their meat tenderizing hammer, officially putting Rio on Oreo duty (and unofficially letting her release any built up tension from the last hour). It’s when the ziplock bag rips open in the middle from the excess pounding that Alice reminds her they need chunks, not crumbs. In response to Rio’s glare, Alice thinks crumbs would work just fine, too.</p><p> </p><p>In separate bowls, they throw in various scoops of ice cream and a handful of gummy worms, topped with the crumbs and dust of the smashed cookies before collapsing onto the couch with their concoction. </p><p> </p><p>For the longest time, neither of them speak. They sit, leaning against the couch and each other, and pick away at their ice-cream. Rio focuses on excavating the gummy worms - focuses on anything else than the events of this evening.</p><p> </p><p>Alice is the first to speak.</p><p> </p><p>”I’ll still jump her for you, you know.” </p><p> </p><p>It’s short and curt, but Rio lets out a singular laugh. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s a defense attorney,” Rio answers her question from the high school drop off. “I think that’s how she has access.”</p><p> </p><p>”So, what? She does a background check on all her potential dates?” Alice asks through another spoonful of ice-cream. </p><p> </p><p>“God, I hope not,” Rio murmurs under her breath. “We did some dumb shit back in the day.”</p><p> </p><p>”Don’t drag me into it - your record is your own,” Alice points out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio decides to ignore the comment. <em> Record </em> is too strong of a word anyway. It’s only a couple of misdemeanors at best. “She says she only looked at the first page and the verdict. So, that would be the accident report, I think?”</p><p> </p><p>”That’s a first page too many,” Alice grumbles, trying to rip apart a cold gummy worm where the seam of the two flavors combine.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think she meant to find anything-“</p><p> </p><p>“But she looked.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not what I’m most upset about,” Rio admits, stirring the melting ice cream.</p><p> </p><p>Silence.</p><p> </p><p>“Two years,” Rio murmurs, shaking her head. “For two years, I didn’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you want to know?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs and continues to stir - a distraction. “I don’t know,” she ultimately confesses. “It doesn’t change anything. Nothing is different.”</p><p> </p><p>“Everything is different.”</p><p> </p><p>“Everything is different,” Rio repeats in a mumble with a slow nod. “You’d think it would’ve been a moment - a moment where the universe shifted or something? <em> Anything </em> to let me know what happened - a sign. Hey, the reason why you and your sisters never started that band? The reason why your parents never got to see you grow up? Yeah, karma finally came for that asshole. But I got nothing. I didn’t know. No one told me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha told you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha told me,” Rio echos the confirmation.</p><p> </p><p>“But she only told you after looking up your entire childhood trauma.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio throws her head back against the cushions so she’s staring up at the ceiling and releases a disgruntled, heavy sigh. “Not <em> all </em> of it, if she’s being honest. That can’t fit onto a page.”</p><p> </p><p>“Your ice cream is turning into soup,” Alice informs.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s better that way,” Rio mumbles, looking back down into her bowl of mostly melted ice cream and gummy worms. She pushes the pieces of candy around, from side to side. </p><p> </p><p>Rio adds softly, “Thank you, by the way, for coming.”</p><p> </p><p>“Any time. You know that,” Alice replies, just as gentle.</p><p> </p><p>She’s also thankful that Alice doesn’t push her to talk, that they sit there in silence just finishing up the rest of their ‘dinner’ (Rio tries not to hear Agatha’s voice in her head, commenting on her ability to eat exactly like a six year old - she, the woman holding onto her bowl of ice cream she’s calling dinner - fails miserably). She is equally thankful in the morning when Alice offers to take her substitute plans in so Rio doesn’t need to leave the apartment.</p><p> </p><p>Mental health day, she decides, is necessary; she can’t possibly channel her bubbly teaching persona today. The mere thought is enough to drain what little energy she possesses. </p><p> </p><p>When Alice leaves, manila folder in hand, Rio retreats to the sanctity of the living room couch, with its throw blankets, and returns to the ghost hunting ‘docu-series’ from the previous week (or was it the week before that? She doesn’t remember - time is both an illusion and melding all together anyway). She’s still not a fan of ghosts - would never want to encounter one herself, but the program satisfies a morbid curiosity, even if the hosts tend to get under her skin in nearly every episode she watches.</p><p> </p><p>She’s nearly done with her second episode of the morning when there is a knock at the apartment door, one that startles her into a jump. Furrowed eyebrows, Rio pauses the television and stares over her right shoulder towards the door. She’s not expecting anyone, nor anything for that matter (most of their packages get delivered downstairs anyway). Had the television been too loud? Did she accidentally disgruntle a neighbor?</p><p> </p><p>The notion of ignoring it and hoping it goes away is thrown out the window when a second series of knocks raptures from the door, relentlessly forcing Rio onto her feet which she drags all the way over. Still clad in hunter green pajama pants and the same hoodie from yesterday, Rio opens the door just a crack - enough space to slam it back shut if need be.</p><p> </p><p>When her swirling mind registers that it’s Agatha standing on the other side, holding a bouquet of white tulips in one hand and her other behind her back, Rio isn’t sure if she wants to slam it back shut or open it.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she settles with a soft and confused, “How..?” Because Rio is sure she never gave Agatha her apartment number.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifts back and forth on her feet before sheepishly admitting, “I figured yours would be the one with the four potted plants outside of it. Or rather, I <em> really </em> hoped it was otherwise this would’ve been pretty awkward.” She reveals the hand behind her back, clutching onto a bag of mini three musketeers. </p><p> </p><p>“And how did you know I wasn’t at school?” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I tried making a delivery there first - the ancient looking man at your desk looked very delighted until I told him they were for someone else,” Agatha explains.</p><p> </p><p>A slow nod. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s all this for?” Rio asks as she continues her line of questioning, still not opening the door beyond the three inch crack she’s peeking through.</p><p> </p><p>“An apology,” Agatha answers, truthfully. “One that I am really hoping you’ll accept. I’m sorry, Rio. You should’ve been the one to share such intimate and personal information. And I’m sorry for bringing it up at practice - for wanting to bring it up yesterday morning at your work. Neither would’ve been or are appropriate.”</p><p> </p><p>”I mean, kudos for picking the better of the two shitty options,” Rio comments. “At least you brought an emotional support rabbit.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha repeats again. “I just.. once I saw it - <em> knew </em> about it - I panicked. I felt caught and I needed to confess <em> immediately </em>. I didn’t think about your own well being.” </p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha’s voice becomes uncharacteristically small, “I can be good, Rio.” </p><p> </p><p>Eyeing the tulips, Rio tilts her head to the side as she listens to Agatha’s confession. The question escapes her rather bluntly, “Did you google ‘flowers symbolizing forgiveness’ and went with the first choice?”</p><p> </p><p>A beat.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha admits, wincing. “Is it that obvious?”</p><p> </p><p>Wrinkling her nose, Rio shrugs her shoulders and finally opens the rest of the door. “I appreciate the effort. The lack of the emotional support rabbit dings you some points, though,” she teases, taking both the flowers and the bag of chocolate.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha enters with a cautious step. “Scratch is currently serving out his near daily sentence known as the Harkness school and work day.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio closes the front door and notices Agatha’s shoulders tense. “Not the best analogy, I’m —“</p><p> </p><p>”It’s fine,” Rio interrupts, offering up a small smile of reassurance. “Do you want some coffee? Can’t promise you espresso. Or oat milk, but I find it drinkable. We only have a coffee pot.” </p><p> </p><p>“What are you trying to offer me, Vidal?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, “Probably something you’d consider a war crime against taste buds is my guess.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulders relax at the return of the bantering - the return of familiar territory and playing field. She follows Rio across the living room and into the kitchen where the earlier brewed coffee awaits them. Rio sets the bouquet and candy down on the counter before rounding it to fetch two mugs from the cupboard. </p><p> </p><p>She pours and then pushes one of the mugs, along with a small container of brown sugar, towards Agatha who remains standing on the opposite side of the counter from Rio. Agatha helps herself to a spoonful as Rio mixes in some milk into her own mug.</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes meet when Agatha lifts the mug to her lips for a sip. Agatha tries to hold back any sign of a reaction, but Rio catches the small twitch of an eyebrow and she can almost hear the biting comment trying to claw its way out.</p><p> </p><p>”Best cup you’ve ever had?” Rio goads. </p><p> </p><p>“Best I’ve had in this apartment,” Agatha remarks. It’s technically the truth. Rio can’t fault her for it, but leave it to Agatha, of course, to find herself a loophole.</p><p> </p><p>A soft laugh escapes Rio as she reaches over for the sugar. She pulls it over to herself and scoops two spoonfuls into her own coffee. Watching the liquid carefully, she slowly begins to stir. </p><p> </p><p>When she stops and sets the spoon on top of a paper towel, she begins to speak, “It was around Christmas that year, we were driving back late from the city. I think there was ice on the road-“ </p><p> </p><p>“Rio, you don’t have to-“ </p><p> </p><p>“It’s fine; I’m fine,” Rio says, looking up to meet Agatha’s soft gaze. “It.. It was a long time ago.”</p><p> </p><p>But there are times when grief raises its ugly head, engulfs her, and makes it feel as though it were still fresh - as if no time has passed and, at the same time, it was truly an eternity away.</p><p> </p><p>The fact that she doesn’t remember any of it bothers Rio most of all. The head injury, the brain swelling and bleeding, she sustained stole those memories from her, along with the ones of her last family outing. It was the most consequential day of her life and she had to be told about it through reports, police officers, and medical professionals. To her, it was all a series of facts and cold details. There was nothing personable, yet.. the consequences were anything but.</p><p> </p><p>The consequences were <em> real </em> and <em> irrational </em> and <em> so unfair </em>. </p><p> </p><p>“We had just spent the day in the city - it was my and my sisters’ first time,” Rio recalls fondly. The trip had been on the calendar in the kitchen for weeks. Each Vidal sister took turns crossing out the days leading up to it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles fondly at the memories she <em> does </em> have. At least she has <em> something </em>. “We were so excited to see the tree and go ice skating. Our parents even surprised us with tickets to the Lion King on Broadway a couple days before. It had collectively been our favorite movie - it’s the only Disney movie I remember ever really watching.”</p><p> </p><p>Listening intently, Agatha takes a sip from her mug. Rio pauses to follow suit.</p><p> </p><p>“My parents decided to drive us back here after the show,” she continues. “Hotels were expensive and it’s not that long of a drive back. From what I’ve pieced together, we had just taken the exit ramp - the one where you come off the freeway and the ramp does a 360 loop?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmhmm,” Agatha acknowledges. “That’s a terrible ramp.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio sighs heavily, casting her gaze down to the faux marble countertop. “Even more so when you have a drunk driver driving the wrong way pushing 90. The report says everyone died on impact.” </p><p> </p><p>She pauses when she hears Agatha exhale sharply. <em> Don’t look up </em>, Rio tells herself, reaching the moment where people start to look at her with a deep pity that makes her want to crawl out of her skin. It always has.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs her shoulders, tracing little doodles on the counter. “Small mercies, I guess,” she murmurs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sets her mug down with a gentle <em> clank </em>. “You don’t remember?”</p><p> </p><p>It is not the usual reaction, so curiosity tilts Rio’s head up. Agatha is watching her. Intently. But it’s not with the gaze of pity she feared. Instead there’s.. a faint frown plays her lips in confusion. Is that.. admiration?</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t remember the accident,” Rio says, shaking her head. Her voice drops, becoming small as she adds, “<em> Or </em> the trip.”</p><p> </p><p>She sees Agatha’s jaw clench. The older woman also bites down on her lower lip. “Agatha..?” she cautiously asks.</p><p> </p><p>“I keep thinking how you were Nicky’s age,” Agatha remarks, voice low. Her gaze darkens. Her grasp around the mug tightens. “And it just.. it makes me <em> so </em> angry.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was angry for the longest time - definitely did my fair share of lashing out, I’ll tell you that much,” Rio confides. “Now it comes in waves, like grief - mostly when I least expect it.”</p><p> </p><p>”Like when some moron with a rabbit-“</p><p> </p><p>”Yes, exactly that,” Rio chuckles lightly, taking one last swing from her mug. Now empty, she carries it over to the sink. “But, I also have to admit that I don’t know when I would’ve learned about.. <em> him </em> if you didn’t say anything.”</p><p> </p><p>She walks around the counter and stands next to Agatha who turns to her. Agatha searches through Rio’s features, lingering especially on her eyes - her dark, tired eyes - for any sign warning her to stay away or welcoming her closer. Rio reaches out and takes Agatha’s hand, clearing the air of confusion.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls gently on Agatha’s hand, encouraging her to take a step closer. When she does, Rio leans into her and snakes her arms around Agatha’s waist, resting her forehead against the other woman’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>With slight hesitation, Agatha follows suits, placing her arm around Rio’s middle and her other hand stretching up to and running through hair. Rio leans into Agatha’s hand, inhaling deeply at the soothing comfort - a fleeting moment as once the tips of fingers brush over the edge of a scar running along the side of her head, she freezes.</p><p> </p><p>“It was pretty gnarly,” Rio speaks against Agatha’s shoulder, not looking up. “They had to remove a part of my skull due to the brain swelling. I was in and out of the hospital for the rest of the academic year.”</p><p> </p><p>“And that’s why you had to repeat the first grade,” Agatha concludes. “I’m sorry for teasing you about it.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a moment of silence before Agatha speaks up again.</p><p> </p><p>“Why didn’t I notice this Saturday?” she asks, confused. They spent so much time exploring - discovering - one another. Agatha would not have forgotten this.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilts her head back, but not away from their touch, so she can look at Agatha. “Because I didn’t <em> let </em>you,” she answers simply, as if it is the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha immediately frowns, narrowing her eyes at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio copies the very frown, though out of confusion. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Is that why it took you so long the first time?” Agatha questions.”You were all up in <em> your </em> head while <em> I </em> was giving you-”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, <em> Jesus Christ </em>,” Rio hisses, lowering her head back down against Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>“No, no way - he’s not welcomed in this conversation,” Agatha retorts. “You were <em> distracted </em>, weren’t you? Fess up.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was <em> nervous </em>,” Rio groans against her. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Nervous </em>?” Agatha purrs back. The playfulness in her tone makes Rio whine - the older woman is insufferable. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a half step back, forcing Rio to pull her head up. She meets Agatha’s gaze with a slight pout. “Have you <em> seen </em> you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Have <em> you </em> seen <em> you </em>?” she remarks right back, running the pad of her thumb back and forth over a small portion of Rio’s scar. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, content, as she leans back into the touch. She tilts her head down, meeting Agatha’s eyes. Leaning forward now, she brushes her lips softly against hers and Agatha presses harder against Rio’s. Both smile into the kiss, both–</p><p> </p><p>A sharp vibrating emitting from Agatha’s pant pocket causes both of them to pull away. Rio glances down at the vibration and then back up at Agatha. She doesn’t say a word, but she raises an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t look at me like that, you menace,” Agatha huffs.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> I </em> didn’t say a <em> word </em>, Harkness,” Rio points out.</p><p> </p><p>To Rio’s dismay, Agatha carefully untangles her hand from the younger woman’s hair and takes her phone out of her pocket. She silences the alarm and slides it back to its spot. “I have a meeting in the office in an hour,” she sighs, not bothering to cover her disappointment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio squeezes Agatha tighter for a moment, steals one last kiss, and then breaks their embrace. “Don’t want to make you late,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>She’s not convincing. </p><p> </p><p>Not even to herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Liar,” Agatha calls her out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grins and shrugs her shoulders. “Just trying to behave. I gotta shake this menace title somehow.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what your number is saved as on my phone,” Agatha deadpans. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Menace </em>?” Rio huffs, puffing out her cheeks. “I’m saved as-”</p><p> </p><p>“Am I still Señor Scratchy in yours?” she challenges.</p><p> </p><p>Rio deflates and wrinkles her nose.</p><p> </p><p>It’s an answer in itself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles; Rio smiles instantly, grateful for falling right back into their ridiculous banter. She follows Agatha, who abandons half of her coffee on the counter (Rio doesn’t blame her), to the apartment door. Rio unlocks and opens it for her, allowing for Agatha to step out into the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>She turns around and Rio waits for the salutation, but instead she is met with a request: “Come have dinner with us this Friday.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Us </em>?” Rio repeats.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, “Me, Nicky, and the love of your life.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am so glad my status in Scratchy’s life is well known,” Rio deadpans. “But would that be okay..?” </p><p> </p><p>“Nicky was bummed he didn’t get to see you after practice - again, the kid adores you,” Agatha reiterates. “And if there’s a way for me to make him happy and, well, I get to see you - two birds, one stone and all that animal cruelty.”</p><p> </p><p>“Can I bring anything?” Rio offers, leaning against the doorframe.</p><p> </p><p>“It.. has been politely requested that you be put on dessert duty,” Agatha replies. “Something about having better taste.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, yeah, your favorite chocolate is an Almond Joy,” Rio teases. “If you have to announce the joy, it can’t <em> really </em> be that joyful.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have the power to veto this request, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>She sees right through Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head, “But you won’t because you wouldn’t dare disappointing that little boy, would you? What time should I be there on Friday?”</p><p> </p><p>–</p><p> </p><p>6:58pm - almost 7 o’clock on the dot, Rio’s phone shows her. She tucks it away into her jeans pocket and returns her free hand to the white box containing the chocolate cake she picked up after work from the bakery on main street. She bounces up the handful of porch stairs and rings the doorbell.</p><p> </p><p>The quiet neighborhood’s peaceful lull vanishes to the sound of running feet against wooden floors with an echo of ‘<em> Mama, she’s here! Mama! </em>’</p><p> </p><p>The rampage stops just on the other side of the door. “Hi, Ms. Vidal!” Nicky shouts through the door. “I’d answer the door, but I need Mama’s permission first.! <em> MAMA! </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice doesn’t radiate as loud from wherever she is further in the house, but a muffled “Make sure it’s her.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Okay </em>!” he yells back.</p><p> </p><p>His little voice disappears. Rio stares at the door, perplexed. She takes a step back to inspect the windows on either side, half expected to see Nicky pushing his round face against the pane, but both have their curtains drawn.</p><p> </p><p>She’s half way to reaching the doorbell again when he finally speaks up again. “Ms. Vidal, I need to make sure it’s you,” he says. Rio can hear the seriousness in his tone from through the door. She bites back the smile threatening to take over her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“We have a class plant,” Nicky states loudly. “You don’t like the name we gave it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Geez,” Rio murmurs under her breath, knowing the kid couldn’t hear her. “What’s with the guilt trip there?”</p><p> </p><p>“What is the name of the plant?” he asks boldly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “Ferny,” she grumbles. When she realizes he probably didn’t hear, she speaks up louder, “Ferny!”</p><p> </p><p>“Correct!” he calls back. “And what did <em> you </em> want to name it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fern Ando,” Rio states proudly.</p><p> </p><p>A second of silence passes as if Nicky is taking a moment to truly consider her provided answers and trying to see any flaw.</p><p> </p><p>The door unlocks and pulls open. Nicky walks around it, beaming up at her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile takes over, but she forces it into a frown. “You know who’d appreciate that kind of humor, though? Second graders,” she taunts.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m <em> not </em> in second grade <em> yet </em> , Ms. Vidal,” Nicky reminds. “First grade <em> just </em> started.”</p><p> </p><p>“True, very true,” Rio nods in agreement. She steps through the door after Nicky fully opens it for her, allowing her to enter. “That means you’ll fully appreciate what a great name that is for our plant next year.”</p><p> </p><p>As an afterthought, Rio adds, “Are you feeling better, bud?” In the late morning, she had to send him to the nurse’s. She gave Agatha a heads up: nauseated and headachy. She would keep an eye on him and keep in touch. He perked right up after lunch, as if nothing happened.</p><p> </p><p>“Yup! We’re making spaghetti with tomato sauce and meatballs,” Nicky explains as he closes and locks the door again behind them. He starts to lead Rio around the stairs she is already <em> very </em> familiar with. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky leads her through the open concept living room and dining room. “I wasn’t allowed to help cut the vegetables for the sauce this time because Mama said I was jittering like a jitterbug,” Nicky explains matter of factly. “Do you know what a jitterbug is, Ms. Vidal?”</p><p> </p><p>“A term from the ancient 1900’s,” Rio snorts.</p><p> </p><p>“I <em> heard </em> that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head snaps up towards the dining room in which Agatha seemingly appeared out of thin air (or, more logically, through the double door behind her - the kitchen, Rio guesses).</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Nicky, can you check to see if Scratch’s eaten his dinner? He’s been <em> real </em> picky this week with his new food,” Agatha requests. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky nods, running past her and through the double doors that swing back shut.</p><p> </p><p>She walks up to Rio who holds up the cake box. Agatha places her hands over Rio’s and leans over their shared grasp. It’s quick; it takes her by surprise; and it leaves Rio reeling and wanting. Agatha steals a short, but hungry kiss. </p><p> </p><p>Rio blinks, stupefied. “I..” her voice trails off. “I thought we weren’t going to-”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re not, but I wanted at least one.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is there even new rabbit food?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head, “He’s been eating this brand since we got him.”</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio could remark, Nicky comes hurriedly through the doors again. “He ate everything, Mama!” </p><p> </p><p>“That’s <em> great </em>!” Agatha grins, taking the box from Rio. She gestures over her shoulder, indicating Rio to follow. “Do you want to show Ms. Vidal Scratchy's space?”</p><p> </p><p>“You can call me ‘Rio’ when we’re not in school, Nicky. Your mom, too,” Rio says, following both Harkness into the kitchen. Two pots were simmering on the stove, almost ready by the looks of fragrant smell of things. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, okay, Ms - umm,” Nicky hesitates for a moment. “Ms. Rio! Come on, he lives over here.” </p><p> </p><p>“Close enough,” Rio shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha diverts from the group, heading left towards the fridge to store the cake. Nicky leads Rio to the right, through another door into the laundry room. The back half, however, is fenced off by a baby gate. Although she wouldn’t admit it, <em> Rio </em> is now the one jittering. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky walks her up to the edge of the gate and points to Scratchy sitting lazily next to his empty food dish. Nicky shows her and explains what each toy is for scattered in the enclosure (looks like Scratchy had a pretty playful day, she comments).</p><p> </p><p>He also shows her that he has two harnesses and two leashes, both sets a different dark shade of purple - it was his and Mama’s favorite color. He explains that they don’t really walk him - you don’t really need to walk a rabbit for exercise, but he gets the zoomies some times when they take him outside (Rio is determined to bear witness). Scratchy <em> loves </em> being outside - he never doesn’t mind snow if he wears a jacket.</p><p> </p><p>The mental image nearly makes her combust.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not a problem being in the backyard because they have a wooden fence and Scratchy can’t get out. The front yard is too open. There have been more than two occasions where Scratchy has been found eating Principal Davis’ petunias - that sneaky rabbit!</p><p> </p><p>Rio can still very much recall crystal clear Agatha offering to let Scratchy loose in Principal Davis’ flower beds for Rio’s sake. She just needed to say the word.</p><p> </p><p>Sneaky rabbit, indeed.</p><p> </p><p>They help themselves into the enclosure and sit with the rabbit. Nicky gives her toys to offer him. Within a couple minutes, Scratchy hops into Rio’s lap and contently accepts all of her pets. Agatha calls them to the table not too long after. Nicky instructs the both of them to wash their hands in the laundry room sink before joining Agatha at the table.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as they sit, Nicky leads them through a very detailed retelling of dinner prep, about all the ways he helped Agatha in the kitchen this evening - the perfect shoe chef. Nicky has no idea what shoes have to do with any of this.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is <em> very </em> impressed by his hard work (and Agatha’s too). She’s never had a better bowl of spaghetti in her life. Nicky tells her there’s better in Italy - that’s where spaghetti is from. He wants to go there, but doesn’t think it would be a good idea. Scratchy is afraid of the car. Can you imagine an airplane? </p><p> </p><p>Nicky can’t. He’s never been on one. Rio explains how it takes off, the weird sensation you get in your tummy when the wheels lift off from the ground, and how it lands - the landing can <em> feel </em> a little scary, but pilots know how to do their job safely. </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Nicky wonders if he should be a pilot. Agatha reminds him he can be whatever he wants. For now, Nicky settles on pilot. Maybe Scratchy would be less scared if Nicky is the one in the cockpit.</p><p> </p><p>At the end of dinner, they all help clear the table, retreating to the kitchen to each help with the dishes (it’s only fair, Nicky stresses). After Agatha closes the dishwasher door and begins the load, she turns her attention back to the other two hovering around the kitchen island.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes focus on Nicky first. “Movie and dessert?” she asks.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky nods and then looks up at Rio, asking the same question, “Movie and dessert?”</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps not as enticingly, Rio nods, too. “Movies and dessert,” she states.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Finding Nemo </em>?” Nicky suggests. “That’s my favorite!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns, “I’ve never seen it.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky gasps and he looks immediately at Agatha. “Mama!”</p><p> </p><p>“I know!” Agatha replies, dramatically and matching Nicky’s energy. “How’s that even possible? It’s the <em> greatest </em> piece of Disney cinema. You don’t even need to watch the other 100 or whatever other ones. Who needs them when you can quote <em> Finding Nemo </em> word. For. Word.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio bites back a laugh. “Seems like we’ve decided then.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll go set up the tv!” Nicky exclaims. Before either one of them could protest, he vanishes from the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>With the boy gone, Rio now allows her to laugh lightly. She helps herself to the cake box in the fridge and sets it down on the island. Agatha fetches three dessert plates.</p><p> </p><p>“Seems like I have a seal of approval, yeah?” Rio asks, slowly and carefully lifting the lid.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re a packaged deal,” Agatha replies, not missing a beat. “You don’t get one without the other and he’s already smitten.”</p><p> </p><p>“Seems like a sweet deal,” Rio grins, unfolding the walls of the box so the cardboard lays flat. “Is he the only one that’s smitten?” she asks. Although she means to be gentle - to be teasing, she knows she comes across boldly.</p><p> </p><p>She looks up at Agatha for an answer. Rio spots flushed cheeks and avoiding eyes. When Agatha clears her throat and changes the topic, Rio doesn’t push. It’s fine if there’s no answer.</p><p> </p><p>“Chocolate cake, huh?” Agatha gestures. “Just like you promised.”</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t celebrate your second week of first grade without it,” Rio points out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha calls out for Nicky, but the little boy provides no response. “Probably looking for the remote,” she guesses. “Rio, can you see how big of a slice he wants?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re leaving that question to a six year old?” Rio asks, raising her eyebrows.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s the end of the second week of first grade, isn’t it?” Agatha repeats. “Plus, it’s Friday night. Cut loose a little bit, babe.”</p><p> </p><p><em> Babe </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Uhh,” Rio stammers. “Yeah, I’ll, uhh. I’ll go check on him. Be right back.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes her way through the kitchen and into the empty, but now clean, dining room. “Nicky?” she calls out. </p><p> </p><p>Movement from the couch in the living room catches her eye. She makes her way towards it and comes around the armrest. The sight steals the air from her lungs. Rio’s eyes widen and she quickly yells for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky’s laying on his side against the cushions of the living room couch, eyes rolled into the back of his head and convulsing.</p><p> </p>

<p>“Agatha!” Rio yells over her shoulder. “Agatha, get in here!”</p><p> </p><p>As Rio rounds the back of the couch, she bends over to grab the edge of the solid wood coffee table and pushes it as hard as she can, granting herself enough room to kneel in front of the couch, in front of Nicky’s sporadically shaking little body. They’re fortunate he’s on the couch; this could have been a <em> very </em> different situation. </p><p> </p><p>Rio tries not to think about the heavy coffee table and its sharp corners and edges. Instead, she tries to focus on the district’s safety and first aid training from a few weeks ago. Rio’s desperately trying to recall the presentations and practice workshops.</p><p> </p><p>She grabs one of the throw pillows leaning against the armrest and carefully places it under his head.</p><p> </p><p>The kitchen doors swing open with a loud bang followed by Agatha’s hurried steps and her concerned question, “What’s wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>“How long were we in the-” Rio begins, pulling the other throw pillows towards herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Nicky!” Agatha exclaims, rushing to kneel to Rio’s left, hovering over his head which she reaches out to hold.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabs her wrist out of caution. “We don’t want to restrain him,” she warns, releasing her hold on Agatha. “Help me get him on his side.”</p><p> </p><p>Both women sit up on their knees. Agatha supports Nicky’s shoulder while Rio his lower back, allowing for them to roll the boy onto his side, facing the two of them. Rio places the throw pillows behind him and then turns to Agatha who is pale as a ghost watching helpless as Nicky continues to jerk. A trail of foamy spit begins to trickle down from the corner of his lips.</p><p> </p><p>“About three minutes? Four?” Rio guesses. “That’s how long we were alone in the kitchen?”</p><p> </p><p>“I-I don’t know, maybe?” Agatha stammers. “We need to call - my phone, I left it-”</p><p> </p><p>“I have mine,” Rio says, pulling away from her hold on Nicky to fetch her phone from her pocket. After unlocking it, she immediately dials 911, puts the call on speaker, and holds the receiver up between her and Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>The dispatcher takes an infuriating amount of time to pick up - at least, that is what it seems to Rio. Any amount of time with Nicky unresponsive feels like too long. When the line is picked up, a sigh of relief escapes Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“911, what’s your emergency?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s my son,” Agatha immediately blurts out.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s been seizing now for at least five minutes,” Rio adds. “He’s unresponsive.”</p><p> </p><p>They hear typing from the other end. “What’s your address?”</p><p> </p><p>“2804 Sherwood Drive,” Agatha answers. </p><p> </p><p>“Alright, we’re sending a unit to your location,” the dispatcher informs. “How old is your son? Does he have a history of seizures?” </p><p> </p><p>“No. No, he doesn’t,” Agatha answers, shaking her head. Her voice cracks, she struggles to hold back a whine. “He’s only six.”</p><p> </p><p>The scared, painful cry breaks Rio’s heart. This is not the Agatha she has come to know over the last month - a far cry from the strong, stubborn, and confident woman Rio has feelings for. Feelings she doesn’t dare voice. This version of Agatha.. Rio wants to make everything right for her; she wants to take away her fear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sets the phone down on the couch cushion, cautious of Nicky. She pulls herself back onto her feet and places a hand on Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha can barely tear her eyes away from her son to glance up at her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll go outside - flag them down,” Rio offers.</p><p> </p><p>As Rio makes a beeline for the front door, she hears the dispatcher relay, “Ma’am, I’ll stay on the line with you until they arrive. Is your son still seizing? Is he breathing?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio unlocks the door, hearing a shaky Agatha confirm both accounts, but he isn’t convulsing as much. He still isn’t responding. </p><p> </p><p>The fresh air hits Rio’s lungs in an oddly refreshing way, providing the smallest amount of calm in the ocean of adrenaline and anxiety. She doesn’t feel like she’s <em> completely </em> drowning in panic - a panic she wouldn’t let Agatha see. It would help either of them any right now.</p><p> </p><p>She almost prides herself in the calmness she is keeping - she’s usually pretty good at it. Rio <em> has </em> to be. She grew up alone, with only herself to watch out for, and she couldn’t afford to allow anyone to see her panic.</p><p> </p><p>The soccer practice had been a close call.</p><p> </p><p>And crumbling in front of Alice? Alice is the closest thing she has to family. She has seen her at her lowest of lows and celebrated her highest of highs. Alice’s seen her through the best of the worst. Rio doesn’t need any walls with Alice. </p><p> </p><p>She wants that with Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>She wants <em> a lot </em> with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>It scares her how much she wants.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio usually doesn’t allow herself frivolous things like wants.</p><p> </p><p>Now’s not the time to think about it, but it lingers. She wants to do what’s right by her and Rio really hopes that she is.</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes the porch steps two at a time. She can hear the wailing of an ambulance’s sirens in the distance, quickly approaching. She jogs down the driveway, reaching the end where it meets the road as the ambulance turns the street corner. She waves her hands over her head, catching the driver’s attention.</p><p> </p><p>The ambulance backs up into the driveway, stopping a few feet away from the house. Rio walks up along the edge of the concrete, still watching as one of the paramedics bounce up the porch steps and through the front door Rio left open. The other rounds to the back of the ambulance to help the third bring down the stretcher before following inside.</p><p> </p><p>Hovering to the side of the porch steps, Rio waits. She doesn’t want to get in anyone's way and the living room is already awfully crowded. She wouldn’t be of any help.</p><p> </p><p>The waiting feels like an eternity. </p><p> </p><p>Is time even moving?</p><p> </p><p>She can vaguely hear what’s happening inside, but she can’t really make out the conversation between the paramedics and Agatha. She can only guess. The seizing has stopped, but given the duration and it being his first episode, they’re going to take him to Westview General.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heart painfully tightens in her chest when they carry the stretcher past her - Nicky somehow looks smaller and more fragile. Agatha follows suit, hesitating in front of Rio when she catches the woman’s eye.</p><p> </p><p>”Go - I’ll take care of everything here,” Rio reassures, giving her a confident nod. She reaches out and grabs Agatha’s hands to give it a small squeeze. “And I’ll meet you there at the hospital, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha matches her nod. She pulls on Rio’s hand, making her take a half step closer. “Thank you,” she whispers, placing a small kiss on her cheek before taking the couple of strides that separate her from the ambulance.</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a couple of steps closer. The paramedic offers Agatha a hand and helps her climb into the back of the emergency vehicle. His attention then turns to Rio, then to Agatha, and back to Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you coming too?” he asks. “You’re his other mother, right?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio begins, “I’m not-“</p><p> </p><p>”She’s not his-“ Agatha begins at the same time, but stops mid-sentence, struggling. “She’s his.. She’s just a friend.”</p><p> </p><p>”Okay then,” the paramedic responds, closing the door and leaving Rio with Agatha’s response hanging heavily in the air.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She’s just a friend. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The ambulance pulls out of the driveway and turns back, retracing its route here. Even when it is completely out of sight, Rio continues to stare at the empty road. The gravity of the evening starts to settle in her bones. She begins to shake. </p><p> </p><p>She almost doesn’t hear the high pitch voice calling out her name from up the street. It takes her a second longer to realize it’s her boss (well, one of them.)</p><p> </p><p>”Ms. Vidal!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns and instantly clocks Sharon Davis walking towards her. <em> Ah, shit </em>. How much did Principal Davis see? Rio wonders if she could release Scratchy to cause a distraction. </p><p> </p><p>But she probably shouldn’t risk losing the rabbit on top of everything else this evening.</p><p> </p><p>“What happened? Are the Harknesses okay?” Sharon asks, her worry genuine. Rio pegs her to be a very dotting, friendly neighbor - one that Agatha probably found overbearing. “What are you doing out?”</p><p> </p><p>”I, uh…” Rio’s voice trails off in search for a believable answer. She finds none. “I was in the neighborhood - saw the commotion. Ms. Harkness was distraught, so I wanted to help-“</p><p> </p><p>”Oh, it’s not sweet, little Nicholas, is it?” Sharon interrupts.</p><p> </p><p>”Nicky,” Rio corrects. </p><p> </p><p>“And look at that!” Sharon huffs. “The house is still open and everything!” </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll take care of it,” Rio says. “I told Ms. Harkness I would.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, isn’t that very good of you, Rio!” Sharon beams. “Such a good samaritan - Westview needs more people <em> and </em>educators like you. I hope you can get back to your walk soon, dear.”</p><p> </p><p>”Yeah, thank you,” Rio murmurs.</p><p> </p><p>”No, no, no - thank <em> you </em>. Have a good evening, dear,” Sharon replies. “I’ll make sure to call Agatha and ask about the rabbit - Itchy, isn’t it?” </p><p> </p><p><em> Scratchy </em>, Rio mentally corrects. She keeps it to herself. It’s not a far-fetched idea that Nicky’s first grade teacher would know the name of his pet rabbit, but there’s enough on Rio’s plate at the moment. “Good evening to you too, Principal Davis,” she says before walking up the porch steps.</p><p> </p><p>She steps into the foyer and looks out into the living room: the armchair and ottoman are pushed aside. The coffee table is further back - closer to the television stand. Her phone is also there. The paramedics needed more space - needed to get the stretcher in. </p><p> </p><p>Rio takes it upon herself to move each piece of furniture (and phone) back into its original place, using the indents on the rug as her guide. She also puts the throw pillows back in their intended spots. </p><p> </p><p>It almost seems like nothing happened. </p><p> </p><p>Almost. There’s a lingering charge in the air that does nothing to calm Rio’s nerves.</p><p> </p><p>She turns off the television and fiddles with light switches until they do turn off. Rio inspects the dining room they previously cleaned. With nothing else to do in this room, she continues into the kitchen where the forgotten chocolate cake resides on the kitchen island, knife pierced in a mid-slice.</p><p> </p><p>A reminder of what this evening could’ve been.</p><p> </p><p>Should’ve been.</p><p> </p><p>Grasping the handle of the knife, Rio pulls out the sharp blade from the moist cake and rinses it off in the sink before returning it to the others in the knife block. She does her best to reassemble the box the cake came in from the bakery. It’s not perfectly straight, but it will get the job done. </p><p> </p><p>Cake safely back in the container, Rio slides it onto a fridge shelf and then makes her way into the laundry room to check on one last thing - arguably the most important thing.</p><p> </p><p>Scratchy is hiding in the open pen, draped with a blanket in the left corner of his enclosure - nose twitching and eyes darting. Rio doesn’t know what stress looks like in rabbits, but his actions mirror those from the soccer field, when Agatha told her that he’s not a fan of people. </p><p> </p><p>“Did you hear all that ruckus, Scratch?” Rio asks gently. “Sounded pretty scary, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>She knows the rabbit can’t answer.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reaches into the cabinet Nicky pointed out earlier. Scratchy immediately perks up. She grabs a bag of treats - dried banana slices. She takes them with her as she climbs over the gate. It doesn’t take Scratchy long to climb into her lap once she sits down and opens the bag. She places a couple of sliced bananas on her lap to Scratchy’s delight.</p><p> </p><p>”Nicky’s gonna be okay, Scratchy,” Rio reassures, giving the small animal a reassuring nod as she pets along his back. </p><p> </p><p>She also needs to hear it for herself.</p><p> </p><p>With a heavy sigh, Rio takes her phone out of her pocket. No notifications. She isn’t expecting any. She assumes the ambulance must be at the hospital by now. Hell, she hopes Nicky is already being seen.</p><p> </p><p>She texts Alice first, if only to give herself a few more minutes of peace with Scratchy, to explain the turn of events. That she is going to meet up with Agatha and Nicky at the hospital.</p><p> </p><p><em> This is not the night over I wanted you to have </em>, Alice immediately texts back from her one person evening at their apartment.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> On a serious note: I hope the kid is okay. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>”Me too,” Rio finds herself murmuring at her screen. Alice is still typing.</p><p> </p><p>Her message comes through a moment later: <em> I’ll keep my sound on, in case you need anything for any reason. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio sends off a quick thanks and then finds her text conversation with Agatha. <em> Hey, not expecting an answer, but I’m leaving the house in a few minutes. I’m bringing your car to the hospital. </em></p><p> </p><p>She let’s Scratchy enjoy a couple more pieces of the dried sliced bananas as she watches the screen of her phone. There is no typing, no texts. Rio’s not surprised, but a small grim smile plays on her lips when she needs that Agatha liked the message - confirmation of life.</p><p> </p><p>”Okay, bud,” Rio says, putting her phone back in her pocket. She scoops Scratchy into her arms and moves him onto the floor before she stands up herself. “Let’s go make sure your little human is okay.” </p><p> </p><p>She double checks the gate is locked and leaves the laundry room door open just a crack, just as Nicky did when they were called to the table for dinner. She turns off lights along the way on her walk back to the foyer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finds a key hook next to the door to the left of the entrance to the house. She grabs Agatha’s keys, steps into the garage, pushes the button to open the garage door, and slips into the driver’s side of the black Mercedes. </p><p> </p><p>The drive to Westview General is a short one. <em> Any </em> drive to <em> anywhere </em> in Westview in a short one in the small town. Rio follows the signs to the emergency bay and parks in the designated parking lot. She steps out of the car and locks it. She sends Agatha a quick message to let her know that Rio is here.</p><p> </p><p>Looking up at the building - at the entrance to the emergency room specifically, Rio sighs heavily. Her heartbeat begins to race. She hates hospitals. She hates <em> this </em> hospital.</p><p> </p><p>Not that she was ever mistreated, no. She received the best care possible. Every single nurse dotted over her - of course they did. How could you not be anything but sickeningly sweet to the child who lost her entire family tragically? A child that they knew they’d have to turn over to the state, to be put in the foster system.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hates this hospital because <em> this </em> is where she woke up, confused and scared - and god, the <em> pain </em>. She remembers waking up sobbing from the pain and calling out for her mother.</p><p> </p><p>Subconsciously, she ranks a hand through her hair, over the scars - permanent reminders that it wasn’t her mother sitting at her side to offer comfort.</p><p> </p><p>It was Ms. Calderu.</p><p> </p><p>Her first grade teacher.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia, who came to her ICU room every single day when six year old Rio was in a coma, medical professionals unsure when she would wake up - <em> if </em> she would wake up.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia, who made sure that the pain was under control and she was no longer crying before anyone could tell her anything.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia, who chased the social worker out of the room because she refused to let such heavy news come from a complete stranger.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia, who told her about the accident and about her family.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia, who held Rio as she wailed for so long and so hard, she made herself sick.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hates this hospital because this is where her life changed forever. The sentiment weighs heavily on her - it always does - and settles in the pit of her stomach, forming a tight ball of anxiety. Swallowing hard, Rio takes a deep breath and walks.</p><p> </p><p>The doors slide open and she steps inside of the waiting room. Rio makes a beeline for the reception desk until she catches a wave from the corner of her eye. She spots Agatha to her left, peeking behind heavy doors leading into the emergency room. </p><p> </p><p>“How is he?” Rio asks, breathlessly, approaching her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs her hand and leads her. “He’s stopped seizing and he’s responsive,” she answers. “He’s really tired.”</p><p> </p><p>”And how are you?”</p><p> </p><p>The only response Rio gets is a sigh; it’s a loaded question after all.</p><p> </p><p>They pass a couple of curtained off rooms and turn right into the third they come across. Rio follows Agatha through the curtain into the small room where sleepy Nicky is propped up on a hospital bed, connected to an IV. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, baby, look how I found,” Agatha says gently, coming up to his left side. She runs her hand through his hair. “Try to stay awake, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>”Ms. Rio,” Nicky murmurs softly.</p><p> </p><p>”What’s up, buddy?” Rio, standing next to Agatha, greets. “You gave us a scare there.”</p><p> </p><p>”Are we still going to have chocolate cake?” he asks. </p><p> </p><p>Priorities.</p><p> </p><p>Rio catches Agatha’s eye. When she nods in approval, Rio does the same. “Yeah! Of course! It’s how you celebrate the second week of first grade. Of course we’re still going to have chocolate cake.” </p><p> </p><p>“When we get home,” Agatha adds. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky nods slowly and narrows his eyes, as if pondering a very important question that he then asks, “Ms. Rio, what do we do to celebrate the <em> third </em> week?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns to her, waiting for an answer. Rio notes how tired, drained Agatha suddenly looks, but when she also catches the older woman’s bemused smile (one that Rio wants to keep there during such stress), she plays right into the utmost serious conversation.</p><p> </p><p>”Oh! The third week, hmmm,” Rio takes a second to think. “You know, what? I have to go back and refer to the handbook. I don’t have it all memorized yet.”</p><p> </p><p>”You <em> don’t </em>?” Nicky gasps.</p><p> </p><p>”Kid, it’s <em> my </em> first year of first grade, too - cut me some slack.”</p><p> </p><p>”It’s technically your third,” Agatha mumbles under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>”<em> You </em> cut me some slack, too!” </p><p> </p><p>“What’s slack?” Nicky asks, wrinkling his nose in confusion. “And why are we cutting it for Ms. Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>Before either woman could explain, there’s a loud knock against the propped open door and the curtain is then drawn open, revealing a middle aged man in dark blue scrubs. He pauses when he sees a new addition to the room. “Oh, you must be the-“</p><p> </p><p>“Rio. I’m Rio,” she interrupts, not allowing the sentence to be finished.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright then, well,” the nurse begins again, walking to the head of the bed on the right side. “The room upstairs is ready for transfer, so if you’ll follow us right this way, please.”</p><p> </p><p>A younger gentleman steps into the room to help disconnect the various wires connected to different machines. Both Rio and Agatha take a step back, as close as they can to the wall to allow them to work.</p><p> </p><p>When they start to roll the bed out of the room, Rio lingers to allow Agatha to follow first. Rio brings up the rear, following them down the hallway and into an elevator that takes them to the third floor and into another nearly identical hallway like the one downstairs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hates it.</p><p> </p><p>Hates that everything looks the same.</p><p> </p><p>Hates the beeping coming from the occupied rooms they pass.</p><p> </p><p>Hates the silence of the ones that are empty.</p><p> </p><p>Hates the squeaking of rubber soles on tiles, mixed with medical chatter.</p><p> </p><p>Hates the smell of-</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly there’s another pair of footsteps in line with her. Rio looks up and turns her head. How long has Agatha been watching her? How long did she frown at the ground as if it had committed a grave crime against her? She didn’t think she was being watched.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, now in step, brushes her fingers against Rio’s - an invitation that she instantly accepts. She takes a hold of Agatha’s hand. Agatha gives it a quick squeeze.</p><p> </p><p>The hallway, it feels, goes on forever, but Nicky is eventually turned into a room and reconnected back to the different machines. The IV bag is placed back on its hook. Agatha lets go of Rio’s hand to stand by his side. Rio hovers at the foot of the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Before taking leave, one of the nurses fills out the whiteboard with Nicky’s information: name, birthday, symptoms, and labels him a neuro patient. The other informs that depending on the results of the blood test, they may have to do more - whether it will be before or after the MRI is anyone’s guess at this point.</p><p> </p><p>Rio catches Nicky flaring his nostrils at the board when the nurses leave. She catches the culprit immediately. Picking up the magnetic dry erase marker from the board, she uncaps it and writes <em> “Nicky” </em> under Nicholas Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs dramatically, sitting on the edge of the bed. “Whoever named you ‘Nicholas,’ what were they even thinking?”</p><p> </p><p>“You're silly, Mama. It was you!” he points out with a giggle that makes Agatha smile wide.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re <em> so </em> right!” Agatha confirms, giving him a wink. “‘Nicky’ suits you much better, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky nods firmly in agreement before he’s consumed by a worrying thought, “Mama, what if Scratchy is scared? He doesn’t know what’s going on.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I let him know,” Rio confirms, capping the pen and sticking it back onto the whiteboard. She takes a seat at the end of the hospital bed, opposite of Agatha’s side. “He <em> was </em> a little scared, so I gave him some of the treats you showed me earlier.”</p><p> </p><p>“The sliced bananas?”</p><p> </p><p>“The very ones,” Rio answers. “I told him that everything was going to be okay. Now, he’s just waiting for you to get home.”</p><p> </p><p>Again, Nicky nods, slowly this time as he absorbs Rio’s response. To both Rio’s and Agatha’s surprise, the little boy frowns - pouts. Tears well up on the brim of his eyes. He lowers his head to try to prevent either of them from seeing.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Agatha says softly. Rio hears her voice crack. “Hey, sweetheart, what’s wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>His voice is so small. He doesn’t look up. “<em> I’m </em> scared,” he admits, quietly. “They tried to make that machine sound cool, but it sounds scary and I don’t want to do it, Mama.”</p><p> </p><p>It is not about Scratchy being alone and scared - never was.</p><p> </p><p>It’s all Nicky.</p><p> </p><p>He’s scared.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn’t understand what’s going on.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cups her hands around his cheeks, using the pads of thumbs to wipe away at the tears that now trail from his eyes. “You are being <em> such </em> a brave boy, Nicky,” she tries to soothe. Leaning forward, she very carefully wraps him in a hug. “I need you to be brave for a little bit longer.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m <em> not </em> brave,” Nicky whimpers against his mother’s chest. “I’m a scaredy cat. We didn’t have to do the big scary machine last time..”</p><p> </p><p>Last time - he split his chin open playing soccer, Rio recalls Agatha telling her. Over the summer, before the start of the school year.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reassures, “It’s okay to feel scared when you have to be brave. It’s not easy - or fun - sometimes when we have to be brave.” </p><p> </p><p>“Rio’s very right,” Agatha agrees, placing a kiss on the top of his head. “It’s okay to be scared,” she echos.</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” Rio begins slowly. “When I was your age, I had to get an MRI scan, too. A ton of them, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky peeks around Agatha. “Really?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns slightly to look at Rio, too.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods.</p><p> </p><p>“Did your mom tell you to be brave, Ms. Rio?” Nicky asks.</p><p> </p><p>The innocent question sucker punches her straight in the gut and steals the air from her lungs. Rio forces a smile - she knows both Nicky and Agatha are watching her - and blinks perhaps a bit <em> too </em> much, but her eyes are stinging and she refuses to allow them to betray her. </p><p> </p><p>“She always knew I was brave,” Rio answers, side stepping his question, but still doesn’t lie. She knows her mother would have, if she could. Her mother would tell her she’s been the bravest in the face of everything.</p><p> </p><p>”Were you scared?” Nicky follows up.</p><p> </p><p>”Mmhmm, but you know what helped?” Rio asks in return.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky shakes his head.</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoots herself closer to him (and Agatha). She leans towards him. “When it starts to feel a little too loud or a little too claustrophobic-“</p><p> </p><p>”What does claustrophobic mean?” Nicky interrupts.</p><p> </p><p>”That there’s not enough space, sweetheart,” Agatha explains.</p><p> </p><p>”Exactly what your mom said,” Rio agrees. “If it feels like there’s not enough space, close your eyes and think about being in your happy place.”</p><p> </p><p>”My happy place?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, “Think of a place where when you know you’re there, you’ll be happy. Do you have a place like that, waffle fry?”</p><p> </p><p>”Curly fries are better,” Nicky argues.</p><p> </p><p>”You’ll understand when you’re older that you are <em> so </em> wrong, hash brown,” Rio huffs. </p><p> </p><p>“Is your happy place a potato field?” Agatha cuts in.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wrinkles her nose, “Idaho doesn’t really call to me.”</p><p> </p><p>”Can our backyard be my happy place?” Nicky asks, looking up towards Agatha who nods at him.</p><p> </p><p>”It can be wherever you want it to be,” Agatha reassures. </p><p> </p><p>“And with whoever you want,” Rio adds. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky nods slowly, thinking over this new bit of information before proclaiming, “Then Mama will be there. And Señor Scratchy!”</p><p> </p><p>”A given,” Agatha grins.</p><p> </p><p>”Billy and Tommy, too,” Nicky continues. “And Aunt Wanda and Uncle Vis. Oh, Ms. Rio, do you want to be in my happy place, too?” </p><p> </p><p>“You’d want me there..?” Rio asks, genuinely touched. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky nods eagerly.</p><p> </p><p>”Then I’ll definitely be there, tater tot.”</p><p> </p><p>“Where’s your happy place, Ms. Rio?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t have to think about it for it is a place that she visits more often than not, but she still hesitates for a second before telling him, “There’s this beach in Puerto Rico - it’s an island in the Caribbean Sea. I’m there, in the <em> bluest </em> water you’re ever seen with my two older sisters. My mom and dad are watching us from their spots in the sand.” </p><p> </p><p>Nicky listens intently, but he doesn’t push with any follow up questions. Instead, he turns his attention to Agatha. “And you, Mama?” </p><p> </p><p>“Anywhere I’m with you,” Agatha answers, not missing a beat.</p><p> </p><p>”I’m <em> always </em> gonna be with you, Mama.”</p><p> </p><p>”So, it seems I’ll always be happy then.” </p><p> </p><p>With a longing ache in her chest, Rio scoots herself over to the edge of the bed and stands herself up. Before dismissing herself, she points towards the door and explains, “My legs fell asleep. I need to stretch them.”</p><p> </p><p>A heavy sigh escapes her as she steps into the hallway, she takes a few long strides and comes to a stop when she is certain she’s no longer within hearing distance of the room. Hands on her hips, Rio tilts her head back, allowing herself to look up towards the ceiling. Her dark eyes are stinging again, dammit. She blinks furiously, but instead of keeping the tears at bay, they’re unleashed.</p><p> </p><p>A silent sob parts from her lips, Rio immediately clasps her hand over her mouth, desperate to not be overheard. She needs to pull herself together; she needs to find a bathroom to hide—</p><p> </p><p>A gentle hand rests against the small of her back. Rio doesn’t need to turn around to know who it is.</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t want you to be selfless, Rio,” Agatha says softly. “And sometimes, being brave means admitting when something is too much.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio slowly turns around to face her, dark eyes meeting blue.</p><p> </p><p>“You can tell me the truth,” Agatha continues, tone still just as gentle. “If being here is hard for you, then it’s okay-“</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha-“</p><p> </p><p>“I signed up for this, willingly. All of it,” Agatha points out. “From that first positive pregnancy test, I knew I was accepting <em> everything </em> that came with it. The late nights, the bumps, the bruises, the heartbreak, and hospital trips..”</p><p> </p><p>The words spill forth from her lips before Rio can process what she’s saying - before she can stop herself. “And what if I want to sign up for you?” she asks. “For the package deal?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio <em> never </em> reveals her wants and she never takes; she keeps things to herself - never one to ask, never one to tell.</p><p> </p><p>The little space between them disappears when Agatha takes a step forward. She cups Rio’s face; she holds her tenderly, as if she were fragile.</p><p> </p><p>She <em> feels </em> fragile. She’s trembling and she knows Agatha can feel it, too. Being here, surrounded by these walls, sounds, and smells - it’s putting cracks in her delicate facade. Rio can’t hide it and with Agatha’s sharp gaze searching her features so carefully, she’s not sure that she can even if she tries.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss is slow. It’s soft. It’s a reassurance Rio doesn’t realize she’s seeking. Taking a hold of Agatha’s wrists, Rio leans into her - into the kiss until Agatha pulls away, leaving Rio breathless.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t thank you enough for your help,” Agatha whispers, resting her forehead against Rio’s. “But, I know you’ve been on edge since you got here and I can’t blame you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine-”</p><p> </p><p>“You come in here and give that sweet little boy of mine such good advice to take care of himself - I wish you’d take some of it and take care of yourself, too.”</p><p> </p><p>With a heavy sigh, Rio lowers her head onto Agatha’s shoulder, forcing Agatha to remove her hands from cradling her cheeks. Agatha snakes them around Rio’s waist and holds her close. Rio allows for herself to be held. She likes being held by Agatha - likes the steady comfort it brings.</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds like he has a brilliant first grade teacher,” Rio murmurs.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know, actually - verdict’s still out,” Agatha says with a shrug. “I’ve heard she had to repeat the first grade. His Ms. Rio, though, she’s the definition of brilliance.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorts, “Wait till you find out about <em> her </em> academic record.”</p><p> </p><p>“She <em> is </em> a bit of a nerd,” Agatha teases, pulling away from the embrace. “Go home and get some rest.”</p><p> </p><p>As much as Rio wants to fight back, there’s a finality to Agatha’s voice deterring such an effort. “Will you be okay..?” she asks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a moment before answering, “I’ll have to be.”</p>

<p>Rio doesn’t leave the hospital without saying goodbye to Nicky, without giving him one more round of extra assurance and a hug for give measure, too. Maneuvering around the wires he’s connected to causes an ache in her chest that remains for the rest of the night.</p><p> </p><p>He asks, in such a small voice, one trying to mask the fears that quivers ever so slightly in it, if that maybe he can call her if he’s feeling extra scared?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries, in a tone so soft, to deny such a request - Rio hears it before it can fully leave her lips, but she interrupts. She ensures him - both of them, actually -  that he can call whenever. <em> They </em>can call.</p><p> </p><p>She’ll answer. </p><p> </p><p>She promises.</p><p> </p><p>The path out of the hospital is old and familiar. When she steps outside into the evening air, she begins to type out a text to Alice - one that is never sent. Rio decides to walk. She <em> needs </em> to. Agatha would protest, if she knew, and Alice as well, but the pent up anxious energy begs - claws - to be released.</p><p> </p><p>So, instead, she walks, knowing it will take her longer to get back to the apartment, it also knowing it gives her the opportunity to process through old, enormous tidal waves of emotions to work through. </p><p> </p><p>She hasn’t been on this side of town in ages - and for good reason, too. The hospital is in the same area as her childhood neighborhood. Even in the quiet of the night, Rio hears the echoes of the ghosts of the past and the shadows of a robbed life and future.</p><p> </p><p>The cracks of the sidewalk begin to look eerily familiar. Rio doesn’t bother to look up when passing the house her parents used to rent - the place she called home for the first six years of her life. </p><p> </p><p>The guilt sits in the pit of her stomach, a reminder that she also hasn’t been to visit her family since moving back to Westview. She wonders if her mother would be disappointed in her - if her father would come to her defense, given that their little girl was starting a career and is super busy with all that entails.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses when she reaches Main Street, in front of the gazebo. The Vidal sisters <em> really </em> should have won that talent show that year. They really work hard during those two weeks of practice.</p><p> </p><p>Then again, Rio knows that she is biased. </p><p> </p><p>She catches herself wondering about the type of women her sisters would’ve become. It’s an odd feeling: being the baby out of the three of them, but the oldest any of them would ever be.</p><p> </p><p>This is the most she’s thought about them in a while; Rio feels a bit ashamed of herself.</p><p> </p><p>Survivor’s guilt.</p><p> </p><p>Still.</p><p> </p><p>She’s convinced she’ll never overcome it.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone vibrates in her pocket; she doesn’t have to guess who it is. She knows it’s Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Did you make it back? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t want to lie, so she avoids the question entirely: <em> has Nicky been seen yet? </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t push. Instead, she texts back, <em> No. I think we’re in for a really long night here. </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> Do you need me to check in on Scratchy in the morning? Or bring you anything? I don’t mind.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I’ll keep you posted. Thank you for offering. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>But when Rio wakes early in the morning very much against her will (sleeping didn’t come easy), there’s no text from Agatha. She checks her phone throughout her morning routine, her walk to work at the café, and periodically at various points in her shift.</p><p> </p><p>Complete radio silence.</p><p> </p><p>By the end of her shift, there is not a single update, but Rio didn’t necessarily expect one, either. Why would she be privy to any information? Alice, when they are both home in the late afternoon, tries to argue because of the situationship. Rio, using the same parameters, doesn’t think it’s a strong argument.</p><p> </p><p>No, Rio doesn’t hear from Agatha until that evening - just a little before 9pm. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> I know it’s getting late, but can you come over? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio rereads the message over and over a few times, frowning. She sends back, <em> Are you okay? </em></p><p> </p><p>This time, it is Agatha who chooses avoidance. </p><p> </p><p>It’s an answer in itself.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Do you work in the morning or can you spend the night? It’s been a really long day. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio, reading between the lines, has her response: Agatha, despite claiming she’d have to be, is not okay.</p><p> </p><p>Instead of responding, she goes back to her messages and finds the conversation labeled “Teen.” The last text from her high school aged fellow barista read, aggressively in call caps from weeks before: <em> THANK YOU I OWE YOU. </em></p><p> </p><p>Time to pay up, kid.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I know it’s last minute, but I’m calling in that favor. Cover me tomorrow? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t wait for a response; she springs into action instead. From her closet, Rio grabs an empty black backpack and quickly packs an overnight bag. Slinging it over her shoulder, she informs that she’s leaving in two minutes and that she’ll see her soon.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Rio reaches the small lobby of the building, there are two messages waiting for her: Teen and Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Teen’s is a crying face emoji, followed by the word <em> fine </em>.</p><p> </p><p>A man of his word.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s isn’t much longer: <em> The front door’s unlocked. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Front door’s…?” Rio whispers, eyebrows furrowing in confusion as she frowns. </p><p> </p><p>Sighing heavily, she shoves the phone back into her pocket and pulls her hoodie closer to her body. She walks at a faster pace than usual - a woman on a mission. She makes it to the Harkness residence in record time, her calves burning from the forced stress.</p><p> </p><p>She walks up the empty driveway, noting there are no lights emitting from any of the windows that all have their curtains drawn. If she didn’t know any better, it is just a typical Saturday night, mother having put son to bed before retiring for the night herself. Rio gives herself a moment on the dark front porch, a chance for her screaming muscles to relax and momentarily recover.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wraps her hand on the front door’s knob and twists. Unlocked just as told. She pushes the door open slowly and carefully, trying to be mindful of any potential noises as she allows herself into the empty foyer.</p><p> </p><p>Quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Not a soul in sight down here.</p><p> </p><p>She locks up and heads to the staircase. Rio’s too preoccupied to be embarrassed as to how easily she is able to take the stairs in the dark. Her initial visit didn’t provide much visual, just muscle memory.</p><p> </p><p>The upstairs hallway is just as draped in darkness like the rest of the house, apart from the dim, golden light glowing from the crack underneath Agatha’s bedroom door. Rio hesitates in front of it, hearing the pacing of feet against carpet on the other side.</p><p> </p><p>Barging in doesn’t seem appropriate.</p><p> </p><p>But knocking and waiting feels equally silly, especially after letting herself into the house.</p><p> </p><p>So, Rio - ever pragmatic - settles for both.</p><p> </p><p>Curling her index finger, Rio taps her knuckle against the bedroom door, bringing the pacing on the other side to a halt. She pushes the door open and peeks inside. As soon as her eyes land on Agatha, the wind is knocked out of her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not an unfamiliar sensation: losing her ability to breathe in the older woman’s presence; her ability to think or talk succumbs to an elegant beauty that Agatha makes seem effortless.</p><p> </p><p>This, though?</p><p> </p><p><em> This </em> is the complete opposite of <em> that </em>.</p><p> </p><p><em> This </em> is a version of Agatha that Rio has yet to see: a shell of stubborn, confident, impeccably dressed lawyer who refused to give up her name for nearly three weeks when they met. Those sullen blue eyes that normally pierce straight through her are so red and puffy from tears that stain her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>Exhaustion radiates off her - making her frame, shrouded by a purple robe laced with flowers, seem smaller.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio says ever so softly, slipping into the room and closing the door behind her. “Agatha, what’s-”</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio can finish asking what’s wrong, or what happened, she is pushed up against the wall next to the door and Agatha’s lips are clashed against hers, as Agatha’s hands cusp her face. Rio tastes her tears - her desperation - as Agatha tries to kiss her harder and deeper.</p><p> </p><p>Grabbing a hold of Agatha’s wrists and as much as she wouldn’t mind the moment continuing, Rio pulls her face free and cranks her head back. She smacks it against the wall behind her with a wince and a hiss - a noise that stops Agatha in her tracks and causes the welling up of fresh tears to collect on the brim of her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio tries again, still speaking gently. “What’s wrong? Talk to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can barely meet her gaze. Blinking frees the built up tears. Now it’s Rio’s turn to hold her face, to brush away those tears with the pads of her thumbs.</p><p> </p><p>“I want to <em> stop </em> feeling like <em> this </em> ,” Agatha confesses, her meek voice cracking. “Make me feel something <em> else </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The begging claws at Rio’s chest as Agatha presses her body against her. In that moment, with the robe loosely undone, Rio registers that it is Agatha’s bare skin she’s feeling on her. She’s wearing only her undergarments underneath. She’s-</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Please </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Something primal and cardinal snaps in Rio when the plea hits her ears. She crashes her mouth against Agatha, inhaling her deeply as she pivots the both of them around so now it’s her pinning the older woman against the wall.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss is hot - biting, even, as Agatha not so silently begs for more, but when the groans dissolve into sobs that Agatha can’t mask, Rio pulls away, again. </p><p> </p><p>This time, Agatha buries her face against Rio’s chest. Rio wraps her arms around her tightly, trying to ground her as fresh, hot tears fall onto Rio’s sweater.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice is muffled by fabric and Rio desperately hopes that she mishears when Agatha shares, “The scans showed a mass.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels her heart drop straight into the pit of her stomach. Her skin, every inch of it, feels like it's been struck by thousands upon thousands of sharp needles.. “What?” she whispers In disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky’s scans from the hospital,” Agatha murmurs, shaking her head against Rio’s chest. She pulls back, still in Rio’s embrace, to properly meet her eye. She sniffs and her lips tremble as she tries to find the strength to voice those damning words again, confirming that Rio unfortunately did not mishear a thing.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice shakes, but the information is clear. ”They found a mass in his brain.”</p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Rio nods. The weight of the new reality begins to rest heavily on her shoulders. “Come on - come here,” she says gently, leading the both of them to the edge of the left side of the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“What does that mean?” Rio asks, concerned.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs heavily and crawls into bed. Rio follows her lead and lays down, too. She props herself on her elbow to better look at Agatha who shakes her head. “We won’t know until they remove it and biopsy it,” she answers.</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio can stop herself, the question comes tumbling out, her voice small. “They <em> can </em> remove it, can’t they..?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha murmurs, lip trembling. Rio is certain she can physically feel her heart breaking into pieces. She extends an arm out, an open invitation for Agatha to curl up against her. When she does, Rio holds her close, providing any sense of comfort she can muster. She doesn’t know what else to do; she doesn’t feel like she’s doing enough.</p><p> </p><p>After a wavering exhaled breath, Agatha continues, ”He has a follow up with a specialist - a neurosurgeon - this Friday out in Jersey City. We’ll find out more then.”</p><p> </p><p>“Friday, huh?” Rio repeats.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you’re out a chaperone - sorry, toots,” Agatha apologizes and for a mere microsecond, Rio sees and hears that confident woman from the coffee shop all those weeks ago. She vanishes just as instantaneously as she appears. “I’m going to have one <em> really </em>upset little boy on my hands. He doesn’t know yet.”</p><p> </p><p>“About the appointment? Or about the mass?” </p><p> </p><p>“The appointment,“ Agatha clarifies. ”But I don’t think he understands the gravity of the situation just yet. I refused to break down in front of him.”</p><p> </p><p>So, instead, Rio concludes, she waited until Nicky went to bed to break down in the privacy of her own bedroom in the middle of the night before seeking Rio’s company.</p><p> </p><p>Tears return to Agatha’s eyes as she starts to babble,”I should have known better. I should’ve seen the signs: the headaches, the falling. I’m a terrible mother-”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, don’t do that to yourself.” Rio immediately cuts her off. “You’re a <em> great </em> mother, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a moment of silence, as if Agatha allows herself to process those sacred words - or better yet, allows herself to believe that they are true.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you.” Her voice is so small. So weak. So, so tired. </p><p> </p><p>She needs to rest, of this Rio is very much aware, and is starting to feel weary herself. “Do you still want me to stay..?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything, but she holds onto Rio tighter.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, then let’s try to get some sleep.”</p><p> </p><p>–</p><p> </p><p>Rio wakes first Sunday morning. Dark eyes flutter open slowly before wandering over to the other side of the bed where Agatha is curled up on her side, under the blankets and comforter, still fast asleep.</p><p> </p><p>She looks at ease - without a stress in the world - and, if Rio has to guess, it’s probably the first time since Friday evening that Agatha is. It’s probably also the first time since then that Agatha has also slept.</p><p> </p><p>So, Rio decides not to disturb her. </p><p> </p><p>She lets her continue to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, however, realizes how <em> warm </em> she suddenly is. The bedding is too hot; she’s wearing too much. She <em> never </em> wears a damn sweater to bed. </p><p> </p><p>Too much distraction last night.</p><p> </p><p>She carefully frees herself from the entanglement of sheets and scoots herself over to the edge of the bed. With one fluid motion, Rio pulls her alumni sweater off and leaves it at the foot of the bed before checking her phone for the time.</p><p> </p><p>9 in the morning.</p><p> </p><p>Oh, that’s considered a late morning in Rio’s book.</p><p> </p><p>She glances over her shoulder towards the slumbering Agatha and wonders if this is ‘sleeping in’ for her, too. Rio’s not going to find out. She will let Agatha sleep as long as she can.</p><p> </p><p>Her movements are deliberately slow as Rio also wonders just how light of a sleeper Agatha is. Rio takes careful steps towards the bedroom door which is cracked open, allowing for an easy escape.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tip toes into the hallway and quietly pads her way towards the stairs where she swears she hears the faint sound of animated gunshots coming from the first floor. When she is halfway down the stairs, it suddenly vanishes and is followed by a very soft whisper of “<em> dang it </em>!”</p><p> </p><p>That little voice - those two words - bring a crack of a smile to Rio’s face, as well as a crack in her heart. </p><p> </p><p>Taking a couple steps more, Rio leans over the banister and peeks into the living room where Nicky is sitting, relaxed, against the middle of the couch. The television is on, displaying a video game with <em> such </em> an overwhelming blue screen proclaiming that he placed 18.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll do better next time, Scratchy,” he says, his voice just a hint above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Ah, <em> shit </em>.</p><p> </p><p>She should go back upstairs, wait for Agatha to wake up, Rio decides, uncertain how to address her presence this early in the Harkness home. When she shifts to turn back around, the wood underneath her foot lets out a wail, one that immediately freezes Rio in place and causes Nicky to whirl his whole body towards the stairs, drastically, as if catching Rio red handed.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, Ms. Rio,” Nicky says nonchalantly, still not at full volume, as if Rio being here is nothing to fuss over. “Did you sleep okay? Mama has the most comfiest bed.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth falls open and stays agape as she stares blankly at Nicky, at a loss due to the string of words she just hears. </p><p> </p><p>Did he just..? </p><p> </p><p>He didn’t..? </p><p> </p><p>How..?</p><p> </p><p>What is happening?</p><p> </p><p>Nicky smirks at Rio’s lack of response and in that moment, he looks exactly like Agatha, Rio notes. That same smirk, that same glint in their eyes - one that silently, but proudly proclaims: <em> gotcha </em>. He turns his attention back to the television set. Rio hears him pat the couch cushion next to him, inviting her to sit.</p><p> </p><p>This little…</p><p> </p><p>He’s his mother’s son, no single argument there.</p><p> </p><p>And <em> that </em>is why Agatha’s bedroom door was already opened.</p><p> </p><p>With a forced huff of disbelief, Rio walks down the rest of the stairs. She joins him on the couch, on his right, tucking her legs under herself as she sits and leans into the corner of the sofa. She looks him over, spots Scratchy lazily resting across his lap. His attention is back to his game. </p><p> </p><p>“You..” Rio starts slowly, still trying tip toe around the conversation. She desperately wishes Agatha were awake for this, that she were downstairs here with all of them.</p><p> </p><p>“Knew you were here?” Nicky finishes for her, glancing at her as the comic book drawing of a load screen appears on the tv. “I went into Mama’s room earlier and saw you in her bed with her.”</p><p> </p><p>Ah, so that sound of a cracking door wasn’t a wisp of a waking dream.</p><p> </p><p>She watches Nicky’s character (a… banana person..?) load into a sandy beach. Other various designs load in around him. “Nicky..” Rio begins again, though she still has no clear way out to approach the topic. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky, however, decides to go forward, full steam ahead.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you like my mom, Ms. Rio?” he asks.</p><p> </p><p>Right, no beating around the bush.</p><p> </p><p>After a second, Rio asks right back, “Would that be okay with you?”</p><p> </p><p>Okay, maybe a little beating.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah!” Nicky answers immediately, as if it is the most natural response in the world - as if there are no other potential answers.</p><p> </p><p>His enthusiasm causes Scratchy to perk up. The rabbit twitches his nose at his little human and hops off his lap, settling between him and Rio. Rio resists the urge to pull him into her own lap.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Rio repeats, a smile tugging on the corners of her lips at the affirmation.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama <em> really </em> likes you. I can always tell when she’s texting you, Ms. Rio,” Nicky points out, returning his attention back to the television at the sound of a bus horn.</p><p> </p><p>Is.. is that bus flying? Is it a hot air balloon?</p><p> </p><p>Focus, Rio tells herself. There are more important topics at play.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh?” she simply follows up, trying her damndest not to sound too eager or reveal the craving for more information - information that Agatha herself does not willingly part with.</p><p> </p><p>“She thinks she’s sneaky, but she’s not,” Nicky continues to explain, to reveal all of Agatha’s closely guarded secrets as his banana character skydives out from the blue bus. “She smiles a lot when you guys talk and I like it when she smiles.”</p><p> </p><p>In a soft voice, Rio admits, “I like it when she smiles too.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad you like my mom, Ms. Rio,” Nicky comments as he runs his character around a small village and opens various yellow treasure chests. “I like you, too. Like, not just as a teacher, but like just you.”</p><p> </p><p>The little boy’s sincerity, mixed with the gravity of the last forty eight hours, pulls at Rio’s heart strings. “You’re a good kid, Nicky,” she says, earnestly and hoping the thick emotion in her voice doesn’t give anything away.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama thinks so, too,” he hums.</p><p> </p><p>Of course Agatha does. Agatha thinks the world of him.</p><p> </p><p>He <em> is </em> her world, Rio knows this much to be true.</p><p> </p><p>And her world is being threatened by a malicious invader she doesn’t know how to fully protect him from. </p><p> </p><p>The dull ache in Rio’s chest returns again, but she can’t dwell on it. Instead, she focuses on the video game on the living room’s television set. The banana person is now swimming across a river.</p><p> </p><p>“So, umm, is this the game you guys keep talking about in class instead of staying on task?” Rio semi-teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! I’m <em> always </em> on task!” Nicky huffs in offense. “It’s <em> Tommy </em> and <em> Billy </em> who aren’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs her shoulders and bites back a smirk. “Whatever you say, my little musketeer, but the three of you make a whirlwind of a trio at recess and sometimes - I’m just saying - the ruckus carries over into class.”</p><p> </p><p>Instead of gracing her with a response to her completely factual statement, Nicky puffs out his cheeks, caught in a truth from which he cannot defend himself. Regardless, Rio knows, he <em> is </em> a good kid the majority of the time - when not acted upon by outside influence.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky is never the instigator.</p><p> </p><p>(Agatha is right in calling the Maximoff twin menaces - a fact Rio wouldn’t dream of repeating in front of Wanda lest she too be at the end of a Sokovian “encouragement.”)</p><p> </p><p>A comfortable silence falls between the two of them and, well, Scratchy who wiggles his way over to lean against Rio’s tight. Slowly, she reaches over and picks up her fluffy best friend to place on her lap. Scratchy doesn’t protest against the movement. Accepting his fate, he curls up against her and nudges her hand with his head: a silent ask that Rio immediately obliges. </p><p> </p><p>As Rio continues to watch the video game match, her pet turns into scratches behind his ears once Nicky informs her that it's his favorite spot. The rabbit melts into the touch, flopping flat on Rio’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>It’s a simplicity of a quiet and peaceful Sunday morning that Rio dares to enjoy - a normalcy she didn’t know she craves until this very moment: the family pet demanding from cuddles from anyone breathing; the kid entertaining himself with a task just beyond her familiarity and comprehension; and upstairs her.. </p><p> </p><p>Rio halts the living daydream and challenges herself to complete the thought: her what, exactly? Agatha is her what? What does Rio <em> want </em> her to be?</p><p> </p><p>Her girl-</p><p> </p><p>“It’s just me and two other people!” Nicky exclaims, sitting up straight on the edge of the couch. </p><p> </p><p>Both Rio and Scratchy jump at the sudden noise. Scratchy curls up again, trying to hide his face in the crook of Rio’s arm. Rio glances over her shoulder towards the stairs, wondering how far Nicky’s excitement carried in the house.</p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s just one other person now, Ms. Rio!”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky is now on his feet, his whole body tense as he stares at the television. Rio can’t help but sit up herself, mindful of Scratchy in her arms.</p><p> </p><p>“What does that mean?” she asks, heart racing.</p><p> </p><p>“That means I could win and get a crown!” Nicky says, rounding the coffee table to get closer to the screen. “Do you see them?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forward, squinting in an attempt to better see off in the distance of the brightly colored map. “I don’t see..” Rio begins, frowning. Then, she spots movement. “Wait! There! Top right!”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky gasps at the sound of gun fire. “They’re shooting at -“</p><p> </p><p>The motion of the screen slows and a bright light takes over the top half of the screen, forming into a banner proclaiming ‘VICTORY ROYALE.’ </p><p> </p><p>”I got a <em> headshot </em>! I did it!” He shouts, leaving no doubt in Rio’s mind that his little voice definitely did carry up the stairs this time. The thought is extra confirmed considering how fast Scratchy darted off Rio’s lap and dove under the armchair for safety.</p><p> </p><p>Rio congratulates, “Way to go, bud.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky walks back over and hops onto the couch, nearly colliding into Rio as he holds out his controller to her. “Do you want to try?” he offers. “You should try - that way you can know what we’re talking about during recess.”</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes look back and forth from Nicky to the controller. She shrugs her shoulders and takes it. That is some sound logic and what does she have to lose anyway? She purposefully fails to tell him that their recess was one of her few precious breaks in her day away from their feralness. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky leans onto her and reaches over to hit a button, launching the load screen of the game and then launching into a whirlwind of a tutorial that Rio struggles to fully follow - way too much information, way too fast.</p><p> </p><p>She is still trying to grasp at his directions when suddenly the weird flying blue bus is back on the screen. When Nicky tells her to drop, she looks up at him, blankly. He tells her it’s the A button. Furrowing her eyebrows, she looks down at the controller, scanning for said button.</p><p> </p><p>When Nicky determines she’s taking too long, he reaches out again and hits the button for her. </p><p> </p><p>The banana man, Rio dubs (Nicky told her his actual name - she doesn’t remember), feels like he’s falling forever. It stresses her out, but since Nicky isn’t reacting, she concludes that she’s not doing anything wrong.</p><p> </p><p>At least not yet.</p><p> </p><p>She lands at a small campsite on top of some grassy mountain. Nicky instructs her to search the glowing yellow chests and pick up the treasures that explode forth. Rio moves the character towards the edge of the cliff, trying to pick up a light blue potion bottle.</p><p> </p><p>“Watch out for fall damage!” Nicky warns.</p><p> </p><p>Again, Rio frowns and asks, just as the humanoid fruit creature steps off the edge. “What’s fall damage-“ </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, the banana disappears and the number 86 flashes on the top half of the now annoying blue screen.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s when you <em> fall, </em> you get <em> damage </em> ,” Nicky points out. “And sometimes <em> die </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that.. that checks out. I see that,” Rio nods, handing off the controller.</p><p> </p><p>”I won’t tell the kids that you’re terrible,” he promises.</p><p> </p><p>”Thank you for protecting my street cred,” Rio deadpans.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky turns to her and narrows his eyes. ”You owe me a crown, though.”</p><p> </p><p>”I don’t know what that <em> means </em>,” Rio sighs heavily, throwing her head back dramatically.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when Rio sees her from the corner of her eye. Rio sits up and turns to her right to find Agatha at the landing of the stairs, wearing a pair of dark sweatpants and — that’s Rio’s alumni sweater.</p><p> </p><p>Her breath catches in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>”What’s all the excitement down here?” Agatha asks. She leans down towards the floor and picks up Scratchy who ventured over. She walks along behind the couch and around the armrest before claiming the spot on Nicky’s left.</p><p> </p><p>”Mama, I got a crown!” Nicky explains, eyes not leaving the screen as the new round begins. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that’s so good-“ </p><p> </p><p>“Then Ms. Rio accidentally killed my character and I lost it.”</p><p> </p><p><em> Ohhhh </em>, that’s what he means, Rio realizes. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs and when a snort escapes her, she quickly covers her mouth. The sound tugs a smile out of Rio. She can’t help but look over at the other woman fondly. When Agatha meets her eye, she clears her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you have to go to work this morning? Or afternoon?” she asks.</p><p> </p><p>“Nope,” Rio answers, shaking her head. “I’m yours all day today.” </p><p> </p><p>Then, she bites down on her inner cheek, keeping her additional thought to herself:  <em> I’d be yours every day, if you let me. </em></p>

<p>The laziness of Sunday morning claims each and everyone of them. Nicky curls up against Rio, practically on her lap and leaning against her chest - a necessity as he continues to explain aspects of the game in the middle of the new round he is playing. With her head resting against her first, elbow propped against the couch’s armrest, Rio watches, humming along with her acknowledgments. She interjects every now and then to ask a clarifying question to show that she actually is listening and paying attention, even if the majority of the information goes over her head.</p><p> </p><p>There’s a relaxed sigh that catches Rio’s attention to her left. Turning her head, she catches Agatha staring at the two of them with such warmth and affection (most of which, Rio assumes, is directed towards her son).</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly bashful, as though Rio caught her in a private moment, Agatha hides her smile behind her hand. Amused by the new found shyness radiating off of Agatha, Rio gives her a quick wink - one that Agatha instantly rolls her eyes at and shakes her head. Both of her actions are small, not wanting to garner Nicky’s attention.</p><p> </p><p>Just as Rio begins to conclude that maybe Agatha is fond of soft little moments, the other woman rests her other arm against the top of the couch’s backrest. Any questions Rio has of maybe Agatha reaching towards her dissolve when Agatha slightly wiggles her fingers at her: an invitation.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glances down at her right arm, trapped against the couch cushions behind Nicky who is still focused on the game. In a move she’s not entirely proud of, as she channels her inner frat boy, she feigns a yawn and stretches her arm free. None the wiser, Nicky falls into her more, leaving the liberated Rio to now also rest her arm on the back of the couch. </p><p> </p><p>She places her hand on top of Agatha’s, the tips of her fingers curling around it in a light hold. The pad of Agatha’s thumb runs gently and lazily back and forth over Rio’s hand - a small, mundane gesture connecting the two women. </p><p> </p><p>“Aw, dang it,” Nicky whines. For a split second, Rio debates pulling her hand back, but when Agatha doesn’t move, neither does she. </p><p> </p><p>The blue screen of the television shows the number 12. The match, Rio can confidently confirm, has come to an end (it’s the only aspect of this game she’s confident in - the end screen).</p><p> </p><p>”Not bad,” Agatha commends, slowly nodding. “Almost top ten, sweetheart.” </p><p> </p><p>“Mama!” he exclaims with such ferocity that Rio jumps. He scampers away from her and scoots over towards his mother. He presses a button on the controller to queue for another match. “You should take a turn, too!”</p><p> </p><p>”Me?“ Agatha scoffs. Her thumb stops moving and Rio feels pathetic at how much she already misses the small movement. “I’m not any good at this game!” she reminds as the queue pops.</p><p> </p><p>”That’s not true!” Nicky protests as she shoves the controller at Agatha, forcing her to pull her hand away to Rio’s dismay. “Whenever you and Billy play one v one, you make him cry!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barks out a singular laugh. ”It doesn’t take much to make that little-“</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Nicky, although wobbly, is standing on his knees against the sinking cushion of the couch, making himself eye-level with Agatha. Both Harkness stare each other down. </p><p> </p><p>”Swear jar!” the little boy states with a tone of practiced finality. He sounds <em> almost </em> like a miniature version of his mother. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is both amused <em> and </em>terrified.</p><p> </p><p>The weird banana man is now on the weird floating hot air balloon blue bus, but that doesn’t stop Agatha for now it’s her turn to whiningly protest the turn of events: “That’s not how a swear jar works, Nicky! I didn’t even <em> say </em> anything!”</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio can stop herself, she questions, “You have a fucking swear jar?”</p><p> </p><p>”Ms. Rio!“ Nicky gasps, immediately turning towards her with such a look of disbelief, you’d think Rio insulted Scratchy’s honor (where <em> did </em>that rabbit run off to?). “Swear jar!” he proclaims before launching himself at her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio barely catches his upper body in time, but his knees collide against her stomach, knocking wind out of her. “Agatha,” she groans. “Why is your kid such a <em> narc </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>”Hey, now!” Agatha lacklusterly chastises. “We don’t need you hurting Ms. Vidal - I mean, Ms. Rio. I mean, fuck, what do I call you?” Agatha asks, glancing over at the two of them. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirking; Nicky puffs out his cheeks and chest before loudly proclaiming, ”Swear-!”</p><p> </p><p>Either emboldened by the ridiculous conversation at hand or completely distracted by the slight pain in her abdomen (it’s anyone’s guess), Rio interrupts Nicky to tell Agatha, “<em> You </em>, hot stuff, can call me whatever you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Returning her attention to the game (the banana man is surfing through the sky), Agatha snorts, “Keep your pants on.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky wiggles free from Rio’s grasp and shifts his little body around, allowing him to now use Rio as his own personal seat - a role she did not take on willingly. “Why are we taking off our pants?” he asks, voice ringing with confusion.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> No one </em> is taking off <em> anything </em> ,” Rio stresses, trying to maneuver herself out from under the child. “Nicky, I can’t <em> breathe </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not without explicit consent, we aren’t.” Agatha says boldly as the banana touches the ground. “You remember what consent is, Nicky?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Nicky answers, rolling off of Rio to retake his original spot between the two women. ”But what’s a narc?” </p><p> </p><p>Before either woman could attempt an appropriate answer, there is a loud crash of a door banging open in the game and the ringing out shotgun blasts. 97th place quickly appears on the screen and the three of them stare at the screen, dumbfounded.</p><p> </p><p>Rio boldly decides to break the silence.</p><p> </p><p>“You know. I at least got 86th place <em> without </em> even trying,” Rio gloats with a shit eating grin that earns her a glare from the older Harkness. Agatha passes the control off to Nicky and rises to her feet, grumbling something about making breakfast. Rio stands up and follows after her towards the dining room.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama!” Nicky calls after the both of them. “Make sure Ms. Rio puts money in the swear jar - I need v-bucks!”</p><p> </p><p>Shaking her head and not bothering to look back, Rio firmly states, “I am not funding this habit.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, kid,” Agatha agrees, waving a dismissive hand in the air. “We got to make sure that Mrs. Potato Head over here can pay her rent.”</p><p> </p><p>Now it’s Rio’s turn to glare daggers at Agatha’s back, “<em> Hey </em>!”</p><p> </p><p>Pausing mid step, Agatha rests her hand flat against the swinging door that leads into the kitchen and glances over her shoulder at Rio before asking, “Are we not feeling the potato nicknames this morning?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mrs. Potato Head is a respectable <em> lady </em>,“ Rio points out, stepping up right in front of Agatha. They are barely inches apart now. “She’s not a food, you pierogi.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows immediately shoot up as she stares at Rio in utter disbelief. “Don’t you <em> ever </em> call me that again,” she warns.</p><p> </p><p>”Or what?” Rio challenges, pressing a palm against Agatha’s forearm and pushing her through the door into the kitchen. When Agatha turns around to step into the room, Rio reaches out to place a gentle - she swears, gentle - slap on the woman’s ass.</p><p> </p><p>Stopping abruptly, Agatha turns on her heel to face Rio who nearly collides into her. The door swings back, hitting a wincing Rio on the shoulder. Agatha places her hands on Rio’s hips and pulls her closer to herself, clearing them both of the entrance.</p><p> </p><p>”Damn the previous owners for making a swinging <em> unlockable </em> door,” Agatha grumbles.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hums in agreement, her own arms resting against Agatha’s shoulders. ”How believable would it be to send him to the Maximoff’s for brunch?” she asks, jokingly.</p><p> </p><p>Well, semi-jokingly, actually.</p><p> </p><p>She’s a bit more serious than she cares or will ever to admit, but you can’t blame a girl for trying.</p><p> </p><p>With a light eye roll, Agatha snorts, “Can you imagine? ‘Hey, kid, go up the street for twenty minutes.’”</p><p> </p><p>”Up the street-? Wait, just <em> twenty </em> minutes?” Rio repeats, her sense of confusion intertwining with offense. “Hang on, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What’s happening here?” she demands.</p><p> </p><p>”The Maximoff’s are practically neighbors,” Agatha points out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns, dawning upon the realization. ”So, that night, you drove <em> so </em> completely out of your way to drop me off?”</p><p> </p><p>”Again, I didn’t want you walking alone that late at night,” Agatha shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>Eyes narrowing, Rio then asks, ”How do you think I got here last night? Or left the hospital?”</p><p> </p><p>It stops Agatha in her metaphoric tracks, mouth hanging open. She freezes, contemplating the thought. “Rio, you <em> absolute </em> ass-“</p><p> </p><p>”Swear jar, Harkness,” Rio interrupts.</p><p> </p><p>The unexpected ”thank you” and sudden wave of gratitude takes the confused Rio by surprise. ”For what?” she asks, tilting her head to the side.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, shoulders dropping as she explains, ”For making the last twelve-ish hours <em> almost </em> feel normal.” </p><p> </p><p>Ah, yes, the giant, massive elephant in the room - the one weighing down on both of them with its heavy sense of the unknown. </p><p> </p><p>Five days. </p><p> </p><p>They will - well, <em> Agatha </em> will have her answers in five days, along with a course of action, she assumes. Rio plans on supporting her - supporting Nicky - in any way that she can muster.</p><p> </p><p>In any way that Agatha would let her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forward to place a soft kiss against Agatha’s lips, one that Rio hopes conveys that she’s here and she <em> will </em> be here whenever she’s needed. She hopes Agatha will remember that.</p><p> </p><p>However small, Rio feels Agatha smiling against her before she takes a step back and turns around to step further into the kitchen. Rio follows, ready to claim Nicky’s precious title of ‘shoe chef,’ but hesitates when she spots a cluttered kitchen island with an open plastic binder and papers scattered across the marble.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s all this?” she asks, approaching the edge of the island. Agatha falls into step by her side.</p><p> </p><p>The admission is soft, twinged with a sense of embarrassment. Agatha didn’t mean for Rio to see. She seems to have forgotten the state she left the kitchen last night. ”Nicky’s medical records - going all the way back to the day he was born,” she explains, shuffling some of the papers around. Rio spots a birth certificate, but it’s the two pictures resting on top of it that Agatha pushes towards her.</p><p> </p><p>One is a close up for a newborn baby (Nicky, of course, but Rio is a firm believer that all newborns look the same); the other is of an exhausted, drained, younger Agatha holding the new babe in her arms, cradling him close to the bare skin of her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“He put me through 32 hours of hell on earth, but I wouldn’t trade any of it away,” Agatha recalls, almost fondly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stares at the pictures, more so of the one that includes Agatha, but her focus pulls at what the image lacks. ”You were alone?” she asks, gently, turning her head to meet the other woman’s eye.</p><p> </p><p>Gaze never flattering and never leaving Rio, Agatha admits without any shame (if anything, there's pride), ”I’ve <em> always </em> been alone. I made that little boy all by myself - from scratch - and I was just fine welcoming him by myself, too.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues, returning her attention back to her first picture with her son, “Wanda wanted to be there, but she was dealing with newborn twins at home - I threatened to run her over with my car on my way to the hospital if she dared to try.“</p><p> </p><p>Rio is not surprised.</p><p> </p><p>“Jen showed up unannounced though,” Agatha adds. “Wanda denies it, but I am incredibly certain she told her. I’d put money on it, but she still denies it to this day and Kale won’t say anything either. I made her wait in the waiting room for <em> both </em> our sake and sanity.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio watches as Agatha begins to collect the various reports into a uniformed pile. Her mind lingers on Jen, on her relationship with Agatha, and how harsh the two women had been to each other at the coffee shop. </p><p> </p><p>She questions, ”How did you two even meet?”</p><p> </p><p>”I was her lawyer in a— nope.” Agatha begins, but her better judgement stops herself. Rio is one of Jen’s employees after all. “I was her lawyer. For a reason. Period.”</p><p> </p><p>”And then you helped her start a new business…?” Rio presses.</p><p> </p><p>”Don’t read too much into it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, but the curiosity behind the mystery of Jen’s skincare productions vanishing into thin air still gnaws at her. Rio would have to draw her own conclusions later. Instead, she forces her curiosity to refocus elsewhere. In its place, she questions, ”So.. why do you have all of Nicky’s medical records out here?”</p><p> </p><p>There’s no point in trying to hide her intention, so Agatha admits, ”Trying to see.. if I missed anything. If his doctor missed anything. If we could have caught this sooner - way before now.”</p><p> </p><p>Why else would she be digging through years worth of records?</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t do that to yourself, Agatha,” Rio says, gently, familiar with this spiral. It’s one that she sometimes will find herself in as well with different parameters. It’s why she hasn’t looked at a single file relating to the accident for years and it’s probably why she missed out on the driver’s demise two years ago, she assumes. She’ll never know. She’ll never check. It wouldn’t do her or anyone any good. “You’ll drive yourself up a wall.”</p><p> </p><p>”I know,” Agatha sighs heavily, returning the stack of papers to their rightful place in the binder before swinging the cover close. “I did stop, though. Last night. Once I realized how insane I was being - I texted you. I needed a distraction to keep my mind off of things.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a slight pause, but Agatha persists, Thank you again for coming. For staying.”</p><p> </p><p>”Of course I stayed.” She couldn’t see herself being anywhere else.</p><p> </p><p>”When I found the bed empty this morning, I honestly thought you left and, well, I couldn't even blame you if you did,” Agatha admits, sheepishly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns, ”What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>A short, dry laugh escapes Agatha. ”It’s endearing that you’re purposely refusing to acknowledge-“</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not refusing anything.” Rio injects. </p><p> </p><p>It takes a moment, but Agatha admits, ”Last night was pretty ugly.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs her shoulders, ”That’s life, isn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head snaps up from the cover of the bender towards Rio and her simple, easy truth.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not always going to be pretty.” Rio goes on with another small shrug. “Sometimes you draw the short straw - the <em> majorly </em> short one. It’s going to happen, so why would I refuse it, you know? If anything, the only complaint I have is that you sleep with <em> way too many blankets </em> . It’s <em> disgustingly </em> warm. Well, no, two complaints: you stole my hoodie.” She pokes against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t have any complaints after your first night here.” Agatha retorts. She pulls at the draw strings hanging against her chest. “And <em> this </em>? This is mine now. It looks better on me.”</p><p> </p><p>“It would look better on the ground, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>A factual statement.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I can get you twenty minutes, Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, pressing the tip of her tongue against her cheek. “You know, I was <em> very </em> naked in that bed my first night here,” she tries to defend herself.</p><p> </p><p>“I tried to get a repeat occurrence last night, but <em> someone </em> was a hot mess,” Agatha points out.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, you got the ‘hot’ part right,” Rio agrees, earning herself a snort from Agatha who rolls her eyes at her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio half nods towards the binder still on the counter. “That’s pretty thick for six years worth of medical history.” She <em> did </em> notice that only have the contents were skewed around when they entered the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>”That’s.. because…” Agatha starts slowly, as if debating how much she wants to reveal. “That’s because there’s also evidence and reports of my mother dearest trying to continue to make my life hell.“</p><p> </p><p>Agatha settles for the whole truth.</p><p> </p><p>“Figured it’s easier to have <em> all </em> the important files in one spot - less things to flip through under duress and wanting to commit a murder,” she explains. </p><p> </p><p>“A criminal defense lawyer committing a murder?” Rio reiterates, raising her eyebrows.</p><p> </p><p>”Just means I have a pool of all the best in the area and then some - I’d get away with it.“ Agatha radiates confidence. “Hell, I’d even do time if it meant never having to look over my shoulder for Evanora Harkness.” </p><p> </p><p>Without missing a beat, she adds, “Also, you’re a first grade teacher who failed the first grade.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio, just as quickly, starts listing off while counting on her fingers for good measure. “Coma, piece of my skull removed, never ending migraines, ward of the state-“</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, I was just tease— no, I’m sorry. That’s it. No excuse. I shouldn’t tease.“ Agatha chastises herself. After a second, a worry appears. “Do you think this is going to majorly disrupt his education?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll cross that bridge when you get there, but I hear that his teacher swears she’ll do whatever to make sure he doesn’t fall behind this year,” Rio answers in earnest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches out and grabs the younger woman’s hand. She squeezes it. “Thank you, Rio. Genuinely.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s a shy smile, but it’s a smile nonetheless. Rio nods slowly, accepting her role - accepting the help that Agatha is allowing her to give. When she looks up from their joined hands, she tries to make her voice as soft as possible.</p><p> </p><p>“Your mom’s a piece of work then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, did you think you’re the only lesbian with a tragic backstory?” Agatha scoffs, pulling away from the grasp.</p><p> </p><p>”It’s our trademark,” Rio deadpans, watching Agatha walk around the kitchen island to the fridge.</p><p> </p><p>That’s right, breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>They actually <em> did </em> have a task at hand here.</p><p> </p><p>“Right from the beginning the old hag had it out for me,” Agatha says, bitterly. Rio doesn’t think she’s heard this tone from her before. She hates it. “I grew up with her constantly telling me that I was <em> born </em> evil - that she should’ve gotten rid of me the moment I left her body.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s blood runs cold. She’s never judged someone so quickly before in her life and she is already one hundred percent certain that she is not misjudging Evanora Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>“What? <em> Why </em>?” </p><p> </p><p>It comes out harshly. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>“I had the audacity to be born on the wickedest day of the year: Halloween - in <em> Salem </em>, Massachusetts of all places. Witchcraft mecca of the world. Apparently that’s enough to make me the devil incarnate,” Agatha explains matter of factly.</p><p> </p><p>She pulls out the box Rio picked up from the bakery only a couple of days ago. Leftover cake for breakfast is a breakfast she can get behind, no complaints, even if the frosting might be a tad bit stale. Rio reminds herself of that circumstances that led to the potential outcome.</p><p> </p><p>“She thought by naming me Agatha - <em> good </em> - that maybe it would rub off on me, but the bitch was set in her ways on day one: I was a <em> burden </em> , a <em> waste </em>of her precious resources that she could’ve been giving to her cult of a church instead - not that it actually stopped her from donating anything and everything to that damn establishment,” Agatha continues, returning her attention the fridge. She collects a few containers of various berries and stacks them on the counter next to the sink.</p><p> </p><p>After a second, Agatha corrects herself while fetching a bowl, “Establishment is too good of a word for that hell hole.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio continues to watch, to listen. It’s not lost to her that Agatha won’t look at her as she speaks. </p><p> </p><p>”I’m pretty sure it’s why we had to move out here to Westview for a few years when I was a kid - had to lay low for whatever <em> stupid </em> reason,” Agatha retells, running the water in the kitchen sink to wash the berries. “I was never told, but whatever it was, it had to be worse than me being caught at eighteen with a girl in the church basement.”</p><p> </p><p>Did Rio hear her correctly? “Discovered where? With who?” She swears her brain is short circuiting a little.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, listen,“ Agatha turns from the skin and carries the bowl of fruit over to the island.  She finally looking at Rio again - there’s that familiar mischievous glint in her eye, if only for a second.”The lord moved us in mysterious ways and I was compelled to be moved between this girl’s-“</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p> </p><p>The seriousness returns.</p><p> </p><p>“Then she added the term ‘abomination’ to the list of things that I clearly was.”</p><p> </p><p>”That you clearly <em> aren’t </em>,” Rio corrects.</p><p> </p><p>“But when you’re told for a <em> really long time </em> that you’re a terrible child - a horrible person, you… start to believe it,” Agatha says a bit more quietly, shrugging.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not, you know,” Rio presses, really hoping that the other woman is listening. She moves around the island to reclaim her spot next to Agatha’s side. Agatha turns towards her, allows for Rio to pull her into a loose hug - to be pulled into a blanket of comfort. “You drew a shitty, short straw.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well, you may be the only person who thinks so,” Agatha murmurs. She’s not looking at Rio again.</p><p> </p><p>“Think there’s a little boy in the next room who’d make that number <em> at least </em>two,” Rio explains as Agatha wiggles free from her grasp, not to Rio’s offense. Agatha goes to fetch plates, so Rio continues, “Then I’m sure there’s the whole Maximoff-“</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, yeah, point taken,” Agatha interrupts, trying to wave off the sincerity. “ It’s just.. the moment Nicky was placed in my arms for the first time - when <em> he </em> left <em> my </em> body, I thought my chest was going to explode from all the bursting love I had for him. I would do <em> anything </em> for him.”</p><p> </p><p>The plates meet the marble counter of the island with a soft clank. </p><p> </p><p>”And at the same time,” Agatha sighs softly. “I couldn’t help but wonder.. why didn't she feel that way with me? How couldn’t she?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head, trying to dismiss her own thoughts, knowing that her mother, after all this time, is set in her ways. Rio, once again, stays quiet. She listens.</p><p> </p><p>”She keeps tabs on me somehow - I know she does,” Agatha points out, slicing the remains of the cake into three pieces (a breakfast that would make Nicky exclaim it is the best Sunday ever). “I haven’t been able to figure it out, but she knew when I was pregnant and I <em> definitely </em> didn’t share that bit of news with her. She made sure to know what a harlot I was, but she was surprised I had ‘befallen such a state’ to begin with.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorts before she can stop herself from making a nose. Thankfully, the ridiculousness tugs a smile at the corner of Agatha’s lips as she scoops the mixed berries onto the plates, but it soon vanishes just as quickly as it appeared.</p><p> </p><p>”Then she wanted grand parental rights to Nicky - the absolute fucking <em> nerve </em>,” Agatha scoffs in disbelief, still even now. “She tries every now and again. The last time was last year when he was in kindergarten. She showed up to the school to try to check him out for the day, demanding to meet her grandson. I’m still impressed I didn’t get arrested that day - I was a complete banshee. I thought he was with her and I was out for blood.”</p><p> </p><p>Last year’s incident - Rio heard about it from her colleagues in passing and, well, it did become part of the district’s training, but the finer details weren’t shared. Rio decides to keep that bit of information for herself.</p><p> </p><p>”Speaking of being out of blood,” Rio repeats, picking up a couple of plates. If they are to return to the coziness of the living room, it is also time for the lightest of the mood to make a reappearance as well. “Do you really make Billy Maximoff cry because of that game?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha picks up the remaining plate and the bowl of extra berries for herself to carry. “He pulled Scratchy’s ear and scarred him for life - I do it to protect his honor,” she states as if it is the most natural repercussion given the situation. “It’s not my fault the kid doesn’t know how to avoid boogie bombs and shotguns.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns, eyebrows furrowing in confusion. “At soccer practice, you said <em> Tommy </em>was the one who pulled his ear.” </p><p> </p><p>Pausing for a second, Agatha remarks, “In my defense, they look alike.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, because they’re <em> twins </em>, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>With a nonchalant shrug, the older woman holds up the bowl of berries. ”Wanna see Scratchy do a Monty Python impression?”</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<span>Sitting at the counter, spoon from her bowl of cereal in her mouth, Rio reads and rereads the district email in her inbox from the screen of her cellphone - a taboo she promised Alice she wouldn’t do (work/life boundary and all that), but curiosity gets the better of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The weekend was silent - no word from Agatha. They last spoke Thursday, when Agatha picked up Nicky from school after Rio offered to tutor him on the material he would miss Friday after the first grade morning field trip to the botanical gardens. She sent a text, along with a photo of the entrance to the garden, wishing the two of them were here and good luck in Jersey City.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaves it be, knowing the amount of stress Agatha is currently under. She busies herself at the coffee bar, even offering to stay later both Saturday and Sunday. She even sneaks away to the elementary school to work on lesson plans to distract herself from constantly checking her phone - she’s now weeks ahead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She is aware she’ll eventually learn the outcome of Friday’s appointment. She didn’t realize it would partially be through a standardized, automated email from the school district the Monday following the field trip.</span>

<p>
<span>Hello,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<span>This is an automated generated email from the office of Student Affairs Assistance (SAA) in the Westview Unified School District (WUSD). The goal of the SAA is to provide support to students and their families who have experienced an unexpected event or crisis in their life. The SAA office is currently working with the family of </span>
<b>Nicholas Harkness</b>
<span>, a student enrolled in your class. The WUSD was notified that: </span>
<b>a serious medical situation will prevent Nicholas from consistent attendance. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<span>The SAA encourages flexibility and accommodation based on the WUSD’s absence practice which can be found </span>
<span>at the following link</span>
<span>. It is the responsibility of the student’s family to work directly with teachers and the principal to determine how to complete any missed work or discuss the possibility of withdrawal.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<span>Sincerely,</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>The Office of Student Affairs Assistance</span>

<span>Rio glances at the corner of her phone screen alerting her this isn’t the newest message in the thread. Frowning, she refreshes the browser. She immediately snorts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course the district has two different email addresses for Agatha. Rio guesses which one was readily provided (“personal”) and which one the district probably had to hunt down themselves to try to reach her (work).</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Despite knowing that Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>does</span>
</em>
<span> check that account (hence knowing about the field trip and offering to chaperone), it momentarily distracts Rio from the subject matter - from the body of the email itself.</span>

</blockquote><p> </p><p>
<span>There’s a shuffling of feet behind her, but Rio’s not fast enough to turn off her screen. From over her shoulder, Alice gasps.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“School email?” Alice groans, dragging herself towards the coffee pot on the counter where an empty cup waits for her. No one can accuse Rio of being a terrible roommate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Continuing to whine, Alice  pours herself a cup, “In this apartment? At 6:30 in the morning? Riooo, be </span>
<em>
<span>better</span>
</em>
<span> than this. You </span>
<em>
<span>are </span>
</em>
<span>better than this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not gonna apologize,” Rio states firmly, taking another bite of her fruit loops cereal. “Student with a serious medical situation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t explain further. Alice chokes on her sip of coffee. “Little Nicky?” she coughs, turning on her heel to face Rio. She hisses when the coffee splashes out of her cup and onto her hand. “What did Agatha tell you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio spoons different colors rings of cereal around her bowl, watching the patterns emerge in the milk. There’s an uneasy feeling sitting in the pit of her stomach. “Yeah and.. nothing. She didn’t tell me anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” she repeats, following with a half shoulder shrug after a second. Was she owed a response? Rio circles between thinking so and not.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice mimics the action and then narrows her eyes at Rio. “Are you two okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She mumbles, “We aren’t a ‘you two.’”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Is she being a little moody this Monday morning? Probably. But has she and Agatha ever defined what they are? No.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, she has your favorite hoodie.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you still have my favorite pair of sweatpants,” Rio counters. “That doesn’t mean anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, bullshit - do you want to hash out our history?” Alice proposes, challengingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Them as messy teens in group therapy together, bonding over shared trauma, and the fact they had both found a fellow queer in a gathering of youths that just ‘wouldn’t understand them?’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Those years can stay firmly in the past. How Alice manages to herd teenagers five days a week, she’ll never understand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio grumbles, scooping more cereal into her mouth. She speaks more to the bowl than to her roommate. “Just want my sweatpants back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice scoffs before taking a swing of coffee, “They were never yours to begin with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still a very debatable topic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The one about her and Agatha?That particular topic? Also a subject that Rio can argue both ways to the dismay of her nerves and anxiety.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This means..” Rio trails off, shaking her head slowly as she stares at the last couple of bites of cereal floating in the now sugared milk. “It confirms something’s wrong, doesn’t it? She’s stressed. I know she is,” she murmurs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She doesn’t tell you when she’s stressed? Or when something is wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t look up. Last week, providing a response would have been easier than at this moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There were texts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I know it’s getting late, but can you come over?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even wanting, begging pleads.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I want to stop feeling like this. Make me feel something else.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>But now? Nothing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But now it also feels different.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Heavier - a shift shaking the foundation that is being built, threatening to crack and crumble.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead of answering, Rio asks in return, “When are you heading out? Twenty minutes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Fifteen, hopefully,” Alice corrects. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Alice disappears to her room, Rio takes it upon herself to clean the kitchen of any remains of their morning breakfast, already ready to head to work. She ends up waiting seventeen minutes for Alice - a happy medium between fifteen and twenty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Per usual, Alice drops her off in front of the elementary school. Rio finds herself lingering and observing the student drop off area, looking for a very specific black Mercedes she knows usually pulls up around this time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead, she spots the Maximoffs’ mini van. The twins scramble out of the back passenger side door and run pass her, shouting their greetings in chaotic unison and drowning out Rio’s warning to </span>
<em>
<span>walk</span>
</em>
<span> not </span>
<em>
<span>run</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She lingers a moment more, enough to catch Wanda’s eye from the driver’s seat. Rio gives her a small wave, one that Wanda returns and - is that a sad smile?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or is Rio reading too much into things? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Seeing something that isn’t there?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The uneasy feeling in her stomach from breakfast returns. It follows her into her classroom. The pit only grows when the morning bell rings and her students come piling into her room - no Nicky in sight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hopes the morning lessons will shake her free from the feeling, or at the very least distract her. They do neither. The worry sits heavy with her and only multiples when she checks her school email before joining Lilia for lunch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>An appointment was added to her schedule.</span>

<p> </p>
<p>
<span>Hello Ms. Vidal:</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<span>The front office received a phone call from one of your student’s parents . You will notice that a last minute meeting has been added to your schedule this afternoon. The parent in question (Nicholas Harkness’ mother, Agatha Harkness) insisted it must be today, as well as insisted that the time would  be fine.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<span>Please let me know if you have further questions.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<span>Best,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>

<span>Westview Elementary School</span>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
<span>Further questions? Rio has a million of them - none of which she wishes to direct to the staff member sitting at the front desk of the school’s reception.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wants to direct of all them at the parent in question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Frowning, Rio reaches for her phone sitting screen side down on her desk. She flips it over, hoping to have at least one alert - one message from Agatha explaining what is going on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No notifications.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No missed calls.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still in the dark.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She unlocks her phone and pulls up the contact page still labeled Señor Scratchy. Her thumb hovers over the phone number, but a knock on her classroom door prevents her from tapping it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia’s voice travels from the doorway, “What has you looking so concerned, Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s head snaps up towards the older teacher. She sets her phone back down on her desk and stands up from her office chair to offer, but Lilia waves a dismissive hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your room, your desk, your chair,” she insists.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you make a comment about these small chairs and my age, I’ll-“ Lilia begins to warn, tone tilting on that of threatening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ll what, Ms. Calderu? Threaten your </span>
<em>
<span>favorite</span>
</em>
<span> former student?” Rio calls her out with a taunt and with a smirk, lowering herself back into her seat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dragging one of the student chairs up to Rio’s desk, Lilia takes her own seat and sets her lunch box in her lap. “Ah! Stop, right there. Do not accuse me of such a thing, Rio. I do </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> have favorites - there are just students I like more than others,” she clarifies. “And you happened to be one of them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can we at least agree that I’m your favorite former student turned colleague then?” Rio’s smirk turns into a grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia lets out a dry chuckle, “Rio, you’re my </span>
<em>
<span>only</span>
</em>
<span> former student turned colleague.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So that automatically makes me the favorite,” Rio concludes, matter of factly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There’s no confirmation, but there’s also no denial and that is good enough for her (although she knows she’s right - she </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> the favorite). It would be even better if Lilia didn’t double back to her original question upon entering the first grade classroom. Rio’s hope of her mentor forgetting vanished immediately.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The question lingers, waiting for an answer. She’s not sure how much she wishes to reveal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sighs, glancing back at her computer screen. “Last late afternoon teacher parent conference,” she decides to answer honestly, grabbing her own lunch bag out from one of her desk drawers. “Wasn’t anticipating a long Monday, especially after a long weekend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So don’t accept it - you don’t have to bend to a parent’s every whim,” Lilia remarks. “You have the ultimate say. Make sure </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> value your time, especially after the school day. Free time is already limited as it is, but yours even more so, balancing two jobs on your plate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Front office said the parent was </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> persistent,” Rio comments. “Sounds like it would be less of a headache - less of a push back - if I just accept the meeting as is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The fact that she also wants to keep in because she knows she’ll be able to see Agatha - that Agatha wouldn’t be able to avoid her? She keeps that fact to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With Rio’s response, Lilia doesn’t miss a beat, “Agatha Harkness.” She shrugs when Rio looks up at her guess. “Tell me I’m wrong,” the older teacher challenges. “That woman hasn’t changed since </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> was in first grade.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With eyebrows furrowed in perplexcity and curiosity, Rio finds herself asking for clarification while fishing out her peanut butter and jelly sandwich from the brown paper bag (she hears the faint echo of ‘same diet as a six year old’ in the back of her mind and she bites her inner cheek). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The memories from decades ago tug on the corner of Lilia’s lips, but there is a sadness that lingers along the edge of the smile. “Even back then Agatha was as headstrong as ever and loved with such ferocity. Stubborn as all living hell,” she explains with a small, silent huff of a laugh. “There were so many times that child made me want to rip my hair out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio now presses the tip of her tongue against her cheek she previously bit, envisioning a six year old Agatha Harkness running circles around Ms. Calderu. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m glad to see that she’s done well for herself,” Lilia admits, helping herself to the Tupperware in her lunch box. “She didn’t come from an easy background. Nasty witch of a mother, that Evanora Harkness - I remember that parent teacher conference very well. I still can’t understand how she could blame all the family’s misfortune on a </span>
<em>
<span>child</span>
</em>
<span>. I remember being so worried about her home life. For her well being, especially as she got older - middle school, high school.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The question leaves her before she can give it a second thought. “What happened as she got older?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Is it appropriate for her to ask to begin with? Rio doesn’t entertain the self inflicted inner debate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia sighs heavily and that is enough to break Rio’s heart. Her answer, however, shatters it. “She learned that the love she tried showing wasn’t being reciprocated.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The soft gasp escapes her before Rio can catch herself, as does a fleeting, “Oh, poor Agatha.” Her body immediately tenses, freezes. “I mean,” she backtracks in a panic. “Mrs. Hark-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”You aren’t as subtle as you think you are, Rio,” Lilia comments with a knowing smile. “And there’s no need to hide anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio suddenly becomes very focused on her sandwich, picking at and removing the crust. She’s bashful, caught in a secret not needed to be kept. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia chuckles lightly, “And I surmise that is precisely why you’re taking the late meeting this afternoon. Though, I suspect not many </span>
<em>
<span>can</span>
</em>
<span> tell that woman ‘no.’”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A silent, small smile graces Rio’s features. She lowers her head in hopes that her mentor doesn’t spot it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Is there reason for concern? For the meeting this afternoon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Without glancing up, Rio nods, smile disappearing just as quickly as it appeared. Of course there are reasons for concern, none of which she knows how to share.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Lilia presses, “Concerns for Ms. Vidal? Or, perhaps, for Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dark eyes narrow, contemplating over the question that causes Rio to purse her lips together and her hunger to flee all together. She puts the sandwich back into the paper bag and places it on her desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For both,” Lilia concludes when Rio doesn’t answer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Leaning back in her office chair and crossing her arms over her chest, Rio looks up at Lilia who takes a bite of her pasta salad.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know,” Lilia begins again after swallowing. “There’s a plot of soil in my yard - rather small patch, but it’s been known to produce a fair amount, especially when shown a lot of love and care.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm, yeah?” Rio hums, tilting her head to the side. “You reserve that for your </span>
<em>
<span>favorite</span>
</em>
<span> former students turned colleagues?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a click of her tongue, Lilia warns her to not push her luck. The hint of playfulness, barely audible, reveals Lilia’s unseriousness; Rio sees right through her facade - that is, until Lilia addresses her well being.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t forget to also take care of yourself, Rio - burnout among new teachers is not something to take lightly,” Lilia reminds her from the beginning of the year's district training session. “Nearly fifty percent-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Leave within the first five years of their career,” Rio finishes. “I know, I know - are you already worried about me, Lilia?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With an incredible sense of earnest concern that makes Rio look away bashfully, Lilia truthfully admits, “I am </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> worried about you, Rio. If I don’t, who would?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio finds herself tugging and fiddling with the hem of her maroon blouse in a poor attempt to give her hands something - anything - to do as she quietly remarks, “Alice.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia’s chuckle gets her to look up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The budding arsonist science teacher at the high school?” the older teacher asks for clarification. “The one who was </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> insistent on taking flaming shots at the beginning of the year icebreaker? The one you did not attend?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio offers a nod of confirmation, adding, “Also known as my roommate and closest friend, yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dryly, Lilia deadpans, “My worry only grows.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Throwing her head back, Rio laughs. An actual genuine laugh. It’s the first time since Thursday - four days ago, not that she would admit it. It feels a little pathetic, if she were to be completely honest with herself - to be so reliant on someone she met only a couple months ago now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She did not expect </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> when she wrote her phone number on that takeaway coffee cup a few weeks ago.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, she anticipated a fun fling with the gorgeous, stubborn, challenging woman who had given her such a difficult time every single morning for weeks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t anticipate Agatha taking her on a date; the meals shared with her and her son whom she loved so dearly and fiercely; and, god, Nicky - he’s the sweetest little boy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It sideswiped Rio - the falling that she still can’t bring herself to admit to or voice, taking her by complete surprise. Is that why she’s hesitating to reach out? Is she not supposed to be feeling this way already? The concern and worry for a mother and child she’s still barely met.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But truly, my dear,” Lilia continues, sincerity returning as she pulls Rio away from her spiraling thoughts. “If you need a moment to yourself, you’re always welcome to restart that vegetable garden in the yard. Granted, it’ll require a bit of cleaning to get it back to its former glory - it hasn’t been touched since you left for university, but it’s nothing a little love and work can’t fix. It’ll be a good stress reliever for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Pausing for a moment, albeit grateful for the familiarity of her sanctuary of peace from her adolescence, a light frown takes over Rio’s features. She tilts her head to the side slightly and asks, “Do I seem stressed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you given yourself a break since the start of the academic year?” Lilia counters.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Rio..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”I </span>
<em>
<span>know-</span>
</em>
<span>“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia sits up straighter, as best as she can in that ridiculous small student chair she stole from one of the desks (Rio makes a mental note to find another normal size chair for the room, precisely for this type of situation). In a tone oozing finality and no room for argument, she states, ”Send me a list of materials to pick up for the garden. You’ll come over Sunday after that second job of yours for a late lunch. You can bring your roommate as well, as long as she promises not to set any fires.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t protest, aware of the futile, pointless attempt would fall on deaf ears. A home cooked meal, one made without the primary use of a microwave </span>
<em>
<span>does</span>
</em>
<span> sound rather appealing - so does getting down in the dirt and working with the earth. A welcoming distraction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The lunch period reaches its end much quicker than both women like. Naturally and unfairly, the rest of the work day moves at a snail's pace: whether the fact that it’s Monday or her after school meeting is to blame, Rio can’t decide. She puts equal blame on both.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At least she has a herd of hyperactive children to distract her for the remainder of the day. It’s after they leave, offering their loud good byes and hugs that she’s incredibly fond of, when she swears that time no longer moves. At one point, she is convinced that it’s been 3:24 for the last five hours.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She tries to busy herself, but there’s only so much she can do, having already worked ahead during the weekend. She ventures out and wanders the hallways of the elementary school to track down a custodial worker to beg for an adult sized chair, as she can’t imagine having any type of conversation with Agatha in a seat made for six year olds.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The little venture kills most of the remaining time and Rio returns to her classroom, triumphantly carrying her prize. She sets it perpendicular from her office chair behind her desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The knock on her closed classroom door comes at 3:58. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before Rio can say anything, it swings open. Her heart begins to race, pounding loudly in her ears as the woman she’s longed to see allows herself inside the room. Agatha, dressed down in a pair of dark blue jeans and a deep purple sweater, pushes the door close behind her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They’re alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their eyes meet and Rio freezes in place. Awkwardly, a very exhausted and sullen Agatha momentarily rocks back and forth on her feet, debating her next step, just the same as Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio wants to get up and go to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio wants to embrace her and not let go, all while telling her that it’s okay.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, after four days of silence, just wants to hear her voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And she does, but the words that part from her lips cause her heart to sink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Ms. Vidal.”</span>

<p>Agatha’s voice is stoic, void of any emotion to which Rio’s grown accustomed. The cold, nearly monotone “Ms. Vidal” strikes straight through her heart, but Rio steadies herself. She sits up straighter, praying to deities she long ago stopped believing in that Agatha doesn’t notice how bothered she is by the formality, when only four days ago - an <em> eternity </em> now -  Agatha, in comparison, might as well have sung the sweet sound of “Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s pathetic, Rio thinks, how she’s desperate to hear it again, <em> right now </em>. She doesn’t trust herself to not pine for it, so she stays silent for a moment longer as if desperately hoping that Agatha would correct herself.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t.</p><p> </p><p><em> Thank you, Rio </em>, Agatha said on Thursday as Nicky gathered his belongings that afternoon after their one-on-one tutoring session after school. Well, technically, after Rio gave them a small list of fun things for a six year old to do in Jersey City, if they had time. Nicky’s eyes widened when Rio told him she lived there for four years. He was impressed she lived away from Westview; he had never left the town limits.</p><p> </p><p>He was excited to go on a roadtrip with his Mama; he asked if Rio knew the rule about road trips. When Rio guessed that there are no limits on snacks and you play the best music ever, he jumped up and down excitedly, ready to devour so many Almond Joys.</p><p> </p><p>Because <em> of course </em>, Agatha’s son would also love Almond Joys.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Ms. Vidal. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It echos, vibrates in her chest. Her mouth is dry, parched as her lips part to respond, but fail to utter a single word. She’s desperate to voice one in particular: <em> Agatha </em>.</p><p> </p><p><em> Agatha </em>.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha, Agatha, Agatha. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>A familiar chant to them both, once yearned in high pitch desperation - a desperation Rio finds herself wanting to use now. A different kind of burning desire to achieve what she needingly wants, but she won’t admit it. Not right now. That’s not the purpose of this visit. This meeting.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Ms. Vidal. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallows painfully hard, hoping the deep breath she takes isn’t noticeable as she tries to ground herself in her role: the first grade teacher at a parent conference. That’s all she can be at this moment.</p><p> </p><p>She waves a gentle hand towards the seat that’s been in the room for all of ten minutes, the one she now wishes she placed across from her desk to give them more space instead of perpendicular from her own.</p><p> </p><p>There’s an alternate universe where Agatha addresses Rio by her name and where Rio shares the story of her and the custodial worker nearly ransacking the whole school looking for a chair that wouldn’t wreck Agatha’s joints. There’s another universe where this meeting isn’t happening at all, a universe where Rio doesn’t find out the non-update of Nicky’s medical situation via an automated districted email, but maybe with a phone call. Hell, there’s a universe where Rio didn’t have to give Agatha a list of recommendations of things to do in Jersey City because she went with them. She went and offered a supporting hand, both metaphorically and actually.</p><p> </p><p>She  is currently not in any of those alternative universes. Ms. Vidal is in <em> this </em> one.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, take a seat, Ag-“ Rio catches herself, bites down on the tip of her tongue with a sharp canine. The jolt of pain halts her potential misstep and allows for her to correct herself: “Ms. Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>The bitterness of the name sits on her tongue, begging to be washed down.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The older woman hesitates, but from nearly being addressed by her first name or with formality, it’s uncertain. There is no clarification to be asked, Rio tells herself, ignoring the urge to question, <em> I’m sorry, but aren’t we closer than this? </em></p><p> </p><p>Before this last weekend, Rio thought she knew the answer. </p><p> </p><p>Now?</p><p> </p><p>Now she isn’t sure - zapped of all confidence that was rather fragile to begin with.</p><p> </p><p>Each step Agatha takes feels so, so slow, as if they must be taken with precise precision. Rio watches her carefully, looking for any cracks in the steel armor she’s shielding with. Agatha doesn’t look at her. Those blue eyes Rio already misses getting lost in are steadily cast on the carpet flooring.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t immediately sit down in the seat. She grabs the back of it and pulls it back a couple of feet, further away from Rio’s desk as if the proximity is already too much. The action makes Rio bite down on her inner cheek. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha does sit, she leans back and crosses her arms over her chest. She opens her mouth to speak, but Rio cuts her off.</p><p> </p><p>”I received an email this morning from the district,” Rio informs, keeping her voice level. Professional. “In regards to Nicky’s future attendance.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha physically pulls herself back in the chair. “Yes, that <em> is </em> the purpose of this meeting,” she confirms - her tone unrecognizable. Rio wonders if this is how Agatha addresses her clients, or maybe how she conducts herself in the courtroom.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky’s incredibly fortunate to have a parent on top of school district policies,” Rio comments. “For an automated email to be sent out first thing on a Monday morning, the form must’ve been sent off midday Friday - beat that weekend delay.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s a challenge disguising itself as a compliment. Rio hopes that Agatha can read her intention loud and clear because it is taking every fiber of her being to keep them to herself: <em> you could have told me sooner than this; I </em> wanted <em> to know sooner than this. Why didn’t you tell me? </em></p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Agatha begins, slowly as if carefully trying to pin her thoughts together. “Time is of the essence and I do <em> not </em> have any to lose - not with Nicky’s health involved.”</p><p> </p><p><em> If that’s so important, then why didn’t you </em> call me <em> over the weekend? </em> Rio swallows down the demand before it can escape and break them both.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” Rio says instead with a half nod. “His well being is of the utmost importance. I assure you I can work around his needs. And <em> yours </em>,” she stresses.</p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes meet brown momentarily, but Agatha quickly looks away, shifting in her seat while under Rio’s gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s focus on Nicky,” Agatha replies. “<em> Please </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes narrow slightly as she continues to watch Agatha, who has become particularly interested in the carpet. It is a request she can abide by, so Rio nods slowly in agreement.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Agatha,” she says, the name slipping before she can catch herself.</p><p> </p><p>Seeing Agatha tense at the mention of her name, Rio quickly turns her attention to her computer screen and pulls up her class roster. She takes her time, slowly going through the alphabetical list to find ‘Harkness, Nicholas.’ It’s a sad attempt to buy time, to see what Agatha would say or how she would react.</p><p> </p><p>All Rio hears is a huffed sigh and she wonders what <em> that </em> is supposed to mean. Did she cross a line? She didn’t <em> mean </em> to. It just-</p><p> </p><p>Focus.</p><p> </p><p>She needs to focus.</p><p> </p><p>She <em> needs </em> to get through this meeting in one metaphorical piece.</p><p> </p><p>She knows she won’t.</p><p> </p><p>She already feels herself cracking and breaking into fractured pieces threatening to crumble.</p><p> </p><p>How did they get like this?</p><p> </p><p><em> Why </em>did they get like this?</p><p> </p><p><em> Those </em> are the questions <em> Rio </em> wishes to address. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Ms. Vidal. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio clicks on Nicky’s full name, pulling up his student profile for the school district. The medical situation is already in his notes, put there by a faceless admin in an office that would never know him beyond his student ID number. It’s there, glaring in bold: <b>UNEXPECTED EVENT - MEDICAL SITUATION</b>. She clicks the text box and hits the enter key, ready to add in her own notes.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll check with the district if future medical notes are needed for absences,” Rio says as she types at the same time, making note of attendance policies. She hates how impersonal she sounds, how cold. “And considering all will be excused, we don’t have to worry about state law-“</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to quote the law to me,” Agatha interrupts, a slight bite to her tone. “And <em> of course </em> I would submit all the necessary notes-“</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t say otherwise,” Rio cuts in, defending herself. She looks up from her computer screen. “I want to make sure we are on the same page and have the same information moving forward.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks her over - a move that once made Rio feel warm with butterflies in her stomach. Now it’s making her uneasy. Nauseous, even. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha speaks again, she does so slowly and carefully, “I have no intention of him missing any days until the day of the surgery in two weeks, plus the recovery time after.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Surgery. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio tries to hide any little hint of her surprise. It’s not the surgery in itself - Rio knew it was coming. Agatha told her that night she begged Rio to come over - the same night where Agatha threw herself onto her, looking for a distraction, a moment where she could forget what was happening.</p><p> </p><p>No, Rio saw the surgery going.</p><p> </p><p>The way it is being confirmed to her, though, she did not.</p><p> </p><p>“Then,” Agatha continues, her voice flattering for a second as she pushes through a potential unwelcoming future. “If he needs to miss any more, I’ll let the district know as soon as I do.”</p><p> </p><p><em> I’ll let the district know </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Another automated generated humanless email.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finds herself biting down on her inner cheek again. She adds Agatha’s comments to the text box.</p><p> </p><p>“And how would you like to address the missed material?” Rio forces herself to ask, evenly.</p><p> </p><p>“I believe <em> you </em> should be better equipped to answer that,” Agatha replies.</p><p> </p><p>Whether Agatha means it as a dig or perhaps the stress and tense situation caused a momentary lapse in judgment, Rio feels the hurt regardless. Part of her believes it’s now in her professional right to demand why she’s being addressed in such a way, to know why Agatha is lashing out at her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio keeps her gaze firmly on her screen. She types away at the keyboard - not anything of importance, just to not give Agatha any more of her attention. She repeatedly types the phrase ‘this is stupid’ over and over again, to later be deleted.</p><p> </p><p>(God, she hopes she remembers to delete it - that’s not a meeting that she needs with any of the admins.)</p><p> </p><p>Let Agatha believe she’s hard at work and not struggling to keep both her temper and attitude in check.</p><p> </p><p>“I..” Rio trails off and then swallows back any biting remarks, reminding herself that she <em> is </em> at work. “Then I will submit a plan to Principal Davis and the district to look over within the next day or two. I suspect they will reach out to you via email by the end of the week, so please keep an eye out.”</p><p> </p><p>At least the two of them can both give non-answers.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, then.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright.”</p><p> </p><p>A beat of silence passes between them.</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Agatha speaks up. Rio can hear the chair being pushed back. “Very productive meeting.”</p><p> </p><p><em> Was it </em>? Rio doesn’t dare ask.</p><p> </p><p>The temptation is there though.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad we can both be on the same page,” Rio lies through her teeth. She isn’t even sure if they’re reading the same book.</p><p> </p><p>The metaphor is stupid.</p><p> </p><p>“A pleasure.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio glances up. Agatha is standing and already heading towards the door. “Likewise,” she responds, casting her eyes back down until Agatha walks past her desk. She waits for the sound of the door opening, for the sound of Agatha letting go of the handle before Rio dares to look up again.</p><p> </p><p>Holding her breath, she watches the door slowly swing to a close. Once she hears the latch, Rio sighs heavily and her tense shoulders finally drop. She throws herself back against the office chair which tilts back, giving her a view of the ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck was that?” she moans, disgruntled and in disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>The meeting - if it can be called such (Rio wants to classify it as a torture session) - replays in her head and she grimaces. She could have handled it better; she could have done things differently; and she could have asked the questions she really wanted to ask, but at what expense?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lashing out after school hours?</p><p> </p><p>The walls of this elementary school building didn’t need another Harkness story to hold.</p><p> </p><p>After a handful of minutes pass, Rio leans forward and pulls herself closer to her desk. She removes her unnecessary paragraph of ‘this is stupid’ phrases and adds in sentences actually related to the situation at hand. She’ll work out a more solid plan in the morning.</p><p> </p><p>Right now, all she wants is to go home.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe help herself to Alice’s tequila collection.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Alice would join her.</p><p> </p><p>(She would.)</p><p> </p><p>Rio powers down the computer before stuffing her phone and key ring into her pockets. She slings her work bag over her shoulder and makes a beeline for the door, turning the lights off on her way out.</p><p> </p><p>Just as quickly, she walks through the dark halls of the school and steps through the main entrance, fishing through her bag for her headphones in order to tackle the walk back to the apartment. </p><p> </p><p>She comes to a stop at the edge of the curb. Pulling out the case of her wireless headphones, triumphantly, she looks up and that’s when she spots the back of the familiar black Mercedes still in the parking lot. The headphones are dropped back into her bag.</p><p> </p><p>What possesses her to take that step into the parking lot, Rio doesn’t know. She <em> really </em> doesn’t know what comes over her to make her walk with such conviction towards the car, rounding up to the front passenger side.</p><p> </p><p>Not a thought crossed her mind, evidently, when Rio grabs the handle and yanks hard, swinging the unlocked door wide open. She slips inside with practiced ease and slams it shut behind her before turning herself to face the other woman.</p><p> </p><p>With a tear stained face and red, puffy eyes, Agatha jumps in her seat, twisting her body towards Rio. For a second, her mouth hangs open, trying to process the moment. When it catches up, she nearly shrieks, “What are you doin-!”</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me what I did wrong,” Rio demands, firmly, despite her wavering conviction. She had not anticipated tears; the sight of them makes her stomach churn as she wonders if she is the cause. </p><p> </p><p>Was she too callous during their meeting? Maybe she should apologize. She took it too far-</p><p> </p><p>“You need to get out of this car <em> right now </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio defies, all thoughts of an apology vanishing into thin air. “I want to know what I did for you to treat me like this, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ri-!” Agatha stops mid word, grimaces even as her lips thin. She tries to correct herself, “This is <em> highly </em> inappropriate, Ms. Vi-“</p><p> </p><p>“<em> No </em>,” Rio says again, a bit bolder now with a bit more bite. “Say it,” she challenges. “Say my name, A-ga-tha.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a flare in those bright, baby blue eyes tinged with red, one that makes Rio want to shrink back and pull herself as far away as possible in the small space in which she enclosed herself, but she refuses. She stands her ground. </p><p> </p><p>Well, rather, she sits, technically.</p><p> </p><p>Either way, Rio does not budge.</p><p> </p><p>(Maybe she didn’t have to draw out Agatha’s name like that, but the damage is done.)</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she speaks up again, but this time she allows for her voice to be softer (though she fears the damage is already done), “What did I do to make you treat me like this? I haven’t heard from you since Thursday-“</p><p> </p><p>“You’re too young,” Agatha interrupts.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” she questions, breathlessly. The wind’s knocked out of her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha repeats,“You are too young, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>At least she uses Rio’s name.</p><p> </p><p>Isn’t that what she wanted?</p><p> </p><p>There’s no gratification to it.</p><p> </p><p>Or satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>Rio only feels numb, incapable of believing what she is hearing. “I’m an <em> adult </em>, Agatha,” she stresses in disbelief, exasperated.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stares at her with a mirrored expression, equally in bewilderment. Her eyebrows furrow, her nose scrunching as she questions, “In what world does a twenty-three year old willingly accept all of <em> this </em>? Why would you?” </p><p> </p><p>“Why would I?” Rio repeats, frowning. Isn’t it obvious why she would?</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha doubles down. “<em> Why </em> would you?”</p><p> </p><p>”Because I lo-” Rio immediately stops herself, biting down on her lip before she can finish the thought. She takes a breath and continues, “I <em> care </em> about <em> you </em> , Agatha. <em> A lot </em> . And I adore <em> him </em> , too. Don’t you see that? <em> Can </em> you see that?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulders fall. Her lip trembles and the younger woman wants nothing more than to reach out and comfort her - to hold her and tell her that everything will be okay. Instead, she remains still in her seat.</p><p> </p><p>Shaking her head, Agatha begins, “Rio-“ </p><p> </p><p>“This is not a decision you get to make for me,” Rio cuts her off before she can say anything to attempt to convince her otherwise. Not that Agatha actually could. Rio’s mind is stubbornly made up and she has held onto these thoughts since Friday evening. She is not going to hold anything back anymore. “You can tell me how young I am all you want, but it won’t make a difference in any of this. It’s not going to make a difference because this is <em> my </em> life, Agatha, and <em> I </em> get to accept what I want in it. And I want <em> you </em> . I want you <em> both </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a dry, short laugh, “Do you even realize what it is you want to accept?”</p><p> </p><p>”How can I if you won’t even <em> tell </em> me?” Rio counters. “I’ve been waiting since Friday to hear about Nicky’s appointment. I didn’t think you would ghost me-“</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t ghost you.”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Rio, a bit dumbfounded, stares. It takes her a second to find her voice again. ”What would you call it then?”</p><p> </p><p>”Protecting you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio throws her head back, releasing a loud, singular laugh. She stares at Agatha in incredulity. Protect her? By pushing her away? By ignoring her very existence? That’s not protection, that’s-</p><p> </p><p>”How can I ask you to stick around through <em> literal </em> brain surgery?” Agatha pushes. “How is that remotely fair to you? And that might not even be the end of it, Rio. His medical team - yes, he has a <em> whole </em> team - they’re throwing around the big fucking ‘C’ word around. He’s six. He’s only fucking <em> six years old </em>.” </p><p> </p><p>A sob escapes her, one that Agatha is not expecting. She covers her mouth with her hand and shifts in her seat so she is now facing the steering wheel.</p><p> </p><p>Six years old.</p><p> </p><p>It isn’t fair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio knows a thing or two about life and its unfairness.</p><p> </p><p>Gaze never leaving Agatha, she speaks softly this time - gently, “You wouldn’t have to ask. You don’t have to. <em> Packaged deal </em>, remember?” </p><p> </p><p>“Rio..” Agatha sighs, lowering her hand into her lap.</p><p> </p><p>”Don’t, no. You can’t talk me out of it, even if you tried - not that I’d let you anyway,” Rio states, tone a little bit firmer. “You don’t get to rip the both of you away from me because life gets hard, Agatha. That’s not protecting. And why should you carry such a heavy burden alone?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’ve done everything-“ </p><p> </p><p>“I know, but you don’t <em> have </em> to anymore, Agatha,” Rio reassures. For a moment she hesitates, but then she reaches across the car console and takes a hold of Agatha’s hand. A wave of relief washes over her when Agatha doesn’t pull away. Testing the waters further, Rio gently leads their hands up to her face and presses a soft kiss against Agatha’s knuckles. </p><p> </p><p>“Let me help you,” Rio all but begs. “Let me be there for you. How can I prove to you that this is something I am more than willing to accept? You. Him. Everything. Don’t push me away. <em> Please </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>She can feel Agatha’s piercing blue eyes scan her over, taking in every single one of her features, as if looking for a crack, a break - <em> something </em> that would show that Rio didn’t mean it. She won’t find it. </p><p> </p><p>Because it’s not there.</p><p> </p><p>Every word Rio says is genuine. It’s the truth and she desperately needs Agatha to see it as such. There are no lies. No alternate motives.</p><p> </p><p>Just an utterly smitten barista completely in love with the snarky customer who refused to give her name. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s not ready to say it just yet; she’s scared Agatha doesn’t feel the same way. She’s afraid they’re both just a little bit too fragile.</p><p> </p><p>But she hopes that Agatha <em> feels </em> it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her hand away and Rio gasps lightly, fear immediately freezing her in place, but she immediately relaxes when Agatha reaches out to run her fingers through Rio’s hair, resting against the side of her head. They find home tracing against her scar.</p><p> </p><p>Her situation isn’t the same as Nicky’s - not even close, but Rio can definitely relate to the boy and maybe, just maybe that is enough.</p><p> </p><p>As if second nature, Rio relaxes against Agatha’s touch. Agatha slides her hand down to the back of Rio’s neck, cupping it and tugging her towards her. Rio immediately obliges and leans over the console.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha meets her halfway, leaning into the soft kiss. She murmurs an apology and an ‘I missed you’ against Rio’s lips, which only makes Rio push herself more against the console, more into the kiss. </p><p> </p><p>Because she’s missed Agatha, too.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s nearly about to climb over the console itself when a knock against Agatha’s drivers’ side door pulls them apart. Rio immediately lowers herself as much as she can in the passenger seat. Agatha fully turns her body towards the window, trying to block Rio from view.</p><p> </p><p>”Oh, Ms. Harkness!” Rio hears from the other side of the window. </p><p> </p><p>She instantly starts cursing to herself mentally.</p><p> </p><p>Fuck. Fuck. <em> Fuck </em>.</p><p> </p><p>The window opens just a crack and Agatha replies with an overly, dripping sweet, “Principal Davis, good to see you!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hopes against all odds that Agatha’s windows are illegally heavily tinted.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m so sorry to hear about Nicky,” the woman - Rio’s <em> god damn </em> boss - says. “I’ll keep that sweet boy in my prayers. I hope everything turns out alright for the both of you! Is.. is that Ms. Vidal in your passenger seat? Ms. Vidal-“</p><p> </p><p><em> Fucking </em> fuck.</p><p> </p><p>”Yes, yes it is,” Agatha confirms.</p><p> </p><p>The confirmation, given so easily, sends Rio whirling further into a state of panic.</p><p> </p><p>What the <em> fuck </em>?</p><p> </p><p>Overdramatically in only a way that Agatha can muster, she sighs heavily, “As we were leaving our meeting, she took a tumble off the curb and twisted her ankle, the <em> poor </em> thing. I offered her a ride home so she wouldn’t have to walk on it. We don’t want her to cause any further damage, do we?”</p><p> </p><p>”Isn’t that just so very kind of you, dear!” Principal Davis gushes. “Isn’t Ms. Harkness kind, Ms. Vidal? How lucky are we to have such great parents for our students!”</p><p> </p><p>”<em> Very </em> lucky, Principal Davis,” Rio agrees in a murmur, pulling herself up in the passenger seat. Her mind races for an excuse for her antics. She doesn’t find it convincing, but it’s better than nothing, she supposes. “Was, uh, looking for my phone - fell between the crack.”</p><p> </p><p>”Make sure you put in for a sick day tomorrow right away, dear,” Principal Davis advises. “We don’t want you walking on that ankle now. Ms. Harkness is right, you don’t want to damage it any further - make sure to ice it!”</p><p> </p><p>”I’ll see how it feels tonight,” Rio replies.</p><p> </p><p>“If you say so. Have a good evening, ladies,” she says with a wave before leaving them in peace.</p><p> </p><p>Closing the window, Agatha turns to Rio and states, “Take the sick day.”</p><p> </p><p>”For my non twisted ankle?” Rio asks, raising an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>”Take the sick day,” Agatha says again, this time more slowly and firmly. “And come over to the house by 9 tomorrow morning.”</p><p> </p><p>The realization then hits her. Now both of Rio’s eyebrows are raised.</p><p> </p><p>”<em> Oh </em>.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Tuesday morning, Rio silently vows to herself that Agatha will never say her name stoically ever again. Not a murmur, nor mumble, nor whisper. She wants Agatha to moan, to cry, to fucking scream it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She gets her to do just that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Over and over again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Rio’s fingers pump forward and back, Agatha’s walls clench around her as Rio’s name escapes from her. Rio licks and sucks moan after moan from the older woman until Agatha’s tights snap against the sides of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For a moment, Rio struggles to breathe, but she doesn’t pull away for air. She thinks there might not be a better way to meet Death, lost in the midst of Agatha’s ecstasy with her own name gracing that woman’s lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She almost doesn’t feel Agatha sliding her fingers through Rio’s hair; she does, however, feel her pull. The quick sensation of mild pain catches her attention and Rio lifts her head from Agatha’s folds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When dark, determined, and focused eyes meet heavy lidded, hazy blue, Rio finally hears the plea to stop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tugs Rio’s hair again and Rio obeys the request. Withdrawing herself from Agatha and earning herself a small whimper, she places her hands against the mattress on both sides of her and Rio crawls her way back to the pillows to lie beside her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Is someone sensitive..?” Rio purrs teasingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”You’re a fucking </span>
<em>
<span>menace</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha huffs back, drawing her in and placing kisses along Rio’s chin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At first, Rio pouts, a complaint sitting on the tip of her tongue until she realizes when she feels Agatha tongue against her skin that she’s tasting and cleaning herself off of Rio. The pout pulls into a smirk as she brings her two soaked fingers up to Agatha’s lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s tongue lapping around her slender digits before taking them into her mouth and sucking reignites a fire in the pit of Rio’s stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”You like that, sweetheart?” Rio coos, replacing her previous pout with a grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a small shrug of her shoulders, Agatha draws away from Rio’s fingers and leans forward towards her, lifting her head off the pillow. “Don’t let it get to your head, but..” she begins, placing a kiss against the corner of that wicked grin. “I like yours better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turns her head slightly, catching Agatha in a deeper kiss. Agatha rests her head back down against the pillow, pulling Rio along with her. Rio lays half on top of her, against her shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”You want another taste?” Rio teases. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How are you still going?” Agatha whines, throwing her head back further against the pillow. “How do you still have </span>
<em>
<span>energy</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s an action that earns a short, low laugh from Rio as she leaves open-mouth, wet kisses against Agatha’s neck. “Having a hard time keeping up with </span>
<em>
<span>the young</span>
</em>
<span>?” she says against her skin, further teasing the older woman.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”I hate you,” Agatha grumbles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve missed you,” Rio replies without missing a beat. “And something tells me </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> is far from the truth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”I don’t think I can move my legs if I tried,” Agatha keeps grumbling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Bemused, Rio rolls her dark eyes and begins to hoist herself up and over Agatha. “Luckily for you, you don’t have to move a single - ah!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snakes her arms around Rio’s torso before she can get far and pulls her down on top of her, earning the startled squeak. “You’re not going </span>
<em>
<span>anywhere</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha states firmly, a hint of a playful growl lacing the edge of her voice. “You’re mine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their faces are barely an inch away from another; Rio’s hovers over Agatha’s. She can feel her steady breath against her skin. Rio tilts her head forward, brushing her lips against Agatha’s softly for a quick kiss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>You’re mine.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her heat jumps high into her throat and pounds loudly in her ears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Mine.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The words leave her before Rio can register what she is saying, “</span>
<em>
<span>Me lo juras?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The silence echoes their shared surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Shifting underneath Rio, Agatha’s arms slide down her sides, her grasp now resting against Rio’s lower back. “It’s silly,” she says slowly, as if the heaviness of a confession so mundane weighs her down. Agatha scrunches her nose; Rio’s has never seen anything more endearing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But.. I forget that you can speak another language,” Agatha admits, sheepishly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio huffs a light laugh and shrugs her shoulders, trying to keep the lightness of the mood between them, but she struggles “Don’t get to speak it much,” she admits right back, scooting herself lower so she could rest the side of her head against Agatha’s chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a lull, Rio gives voice to a gnawing truth that plagues the deepest corners of her mind. “Despite working hard at it, I’m afraid that I’m going to forget it,” she says quietly, sitting in the fear for only a moment by herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s more than just the language.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She releases a heavy sigh, swallows hard, and then she squeezes her eyes shut, allowing herself to be vulnerable: “That I’m going to forget </span>
<em>
<span>them</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hold on her grows tighter. Rio curls into her more, willing herself not only to be closer, but to be the closest she possibly can.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s never told anyone that before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>won’t</span>
</em>
<span> forget them,” Agatha’s voice is firm and steady, as though anchoring Rio in the truth she desperately wants to believe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I haven’t visited,” Rio reveals, just above a whisper. She doesn’t think she can muster up anything stronger. “Not since I moved back. What kind of daughter and sister does that make me?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She feels Agatha place a kiss on the top of her head. “Hey, none of that,” the older woman softly chastises. There is no malice behind her words, only concern. “You’re the kind that is accomplishing her dream of being an elementary school teacher; the kind that works two jobs after putting herself through college; and the kind that goes above and beyond for a single mother and her son.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha interrupts. “You’re the kind of daughter and sister that they would be </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>incredibly proud of.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In that moment, Rio instantly crumbles. A pent up sob escapes her and the tears are immediate - stinging and hot as they trail down her cheeks. She turns her head and buries her face against Agatha’s shoulder, partially out of embarrassment at how quickly she crackled, but mostly out of comfort.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha drags one of her arms up Rio’s back, until she’s soothingly stroking through Rio’s hair. Her other hand rubs gentle circles against her back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Silent acts of comfort; she doesn’t say a word - just lets Rio lean into the sudden emotions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Rio tries, but Agatha shakes her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely no need to apologize,” Agatha reassures.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio inhales a deep shaky breath, willing herself to calm down. “Not how I envisioned this going,” she murmurs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Humming, Agatha presses another soft kiss to the top of Rio’s head. “Hey, how about we get up and pick up some lunch? Maybe a change of scenery will do you some good,” she offers. When Rio nods, Agatha pulls her arms back and shifts towards the end of the bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A change of scenery - something to get out of her head a little bit - did sound like a good plan, Rio agrees. She follows Agatha into the bathroom and joins her in the shower, claiming interest in saving water (naturally - she’s incredibly considerate like that).</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The worry of being seen in public, while taking a day off, does cross Rio’s mind, but Agatha points out she doesn’t even need to get out of the car, that she can run inside to pick up their order. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They settle for the gastropub from their first date, but Agatha waffs about what she wants to order. They climb into the parked car in the garage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You have to decide what you want,” Rio says, looking up from her phone. “We’re going to get there before the food’s ready.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Buckling herself in and putting the keys in the ignition, Agatha shrugs her shoulders nonchalantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine, fine.” Agatha roars the engine to life. “The </span>
<em>
<span>brussel sprouts</span>
</em>
<span>, then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Gross</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio hisses, narrowing her eyes as Agatha smirks at her. “Fine.. But I’m also getting us the flatbread.” She also puts in an order of fries, nearly recreating their first date. Car now pulling into the street and garage door closing, Rio sends out the order. She waits for the confirmation and the car comes to a slow stop at the end of the street, but they don’t proceed. Feeling Agatha’s hand on her tight, she looks up from the screen, confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio asks, “Is something wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We have time, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I.. I guess?” she answers, double checking the status of their order. The restaurant still hasn’t accepted it. “Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The blinker indicates they’d be returning right, instead of left. They’d be driving away from the town square and their destination. Agatha glances to the rearview mirror to double check that the road behind them is still empty. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then..” Agatha begins slowly. “Do you want.. to pay </span>
<em>
<span>them </span>
</em>
<span>a quick visit..?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Them</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The air is sucked out of Rio’s lungs. She turns to stare at Agatha who is already watching her so intently, so carefully. Words fail to come to her when she opens her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Witnessing the struggle, Agatha switches the blinker off and cautiously broaches, “We don’t have to. That is also an option. We’ll go straight into town-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I want to go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sentiment surprises even Rio, but Agatha nods at the granted permission. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The car moves forward; Agatha returns her eyes to the road and her hand to the steering wheel. Rio instantly finds herself missing her touch and the weighted comfort it brings. It’s replaced with tension and building anxiety.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Excuse after excuse clouds her mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She can’t just show up empty handed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No flowers? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No little offering? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Literally nothing at all?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What would they think?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s supposed to be resting at home from a sprained ankle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What if someone sees her out and about on said ankle?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Also, what if the cemetery suddenly changed their hours?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Should they take such a risk? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They had brussel sprouts to pick up, after all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>(Even the mere thought of the brussel sprouts is enough to tug Rio back into reality and make her wrinkle her nose.)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where do I need to go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” Rio looks up towards Agatha who half nods towards the windshield. Rio follows her gaze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course they were already here.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Getting anywhere in Westview never took too long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Rio sighs. Right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They proceed forward slowly, with Agatha following Rio’s directions, until they are near the back of the cemetery. Agatha pulls over and parks on the side of the road. Rio’s attention pulls to the passenger window - to the collection headstones. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She already spots the one she’s looking for a handful of rows back, the one shared by the four people she misses the most in this world. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The ones she hasn’t visited since graduation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sudden guilt summons forth a wave of nausea, one that Agatha’s voice manages to cut through: “Do you want company? Or should I wait here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please come?” Her voice is smaller than she likes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t need to say it twice. Agatha exits the car before Rio can even unbuckle herself. Hell, Agatha even opens the door for her. She follows a couple steps behind and although she doesn’t speak, her presence alone is louder and more profound than anything she can say in that moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha lingers still behind her when Rio comes to a stop a couple of feet away from the mundane looking headstone - plain, nothing extravagant. The fact that it is even erected is one that Rio is still grateful for. The thought crossed her mind years after their death: where the funds came from to pay for her family’s funeral, burial, and grave site.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio owes her the world.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her eyes land on the weathered program from the university’s graduation ceremony, still sitting under a rock that Rio placed it under months ago now. The little New Jersey City University flag pokes from underneath it - must’ve fallen over (the stick that she stuck into the ground is snapped in half). Someone tucked it away. Rio guesses it must’ve been either Lilia or Alice’s doing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The thought warms her, that at least </span>
<em>
<span>someone</span>
</em>
<span> came while she was away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The apology tumbles out of her before anything else. It’s quiet. It’s in Spanish. It feels more natural when Rio talks to them (and, god, does she wish any single one of them could talk back to her).</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t offer any excuses, not that she thinks that any are good enough. Instead, finds herself slipping back into the habit of filling them in about the events in her life that happened since her last visit: landing the first grade teacher position at the elementary school; her trip to their familial land and then off through South America; the things she learned trekking through the different places; moving back to Westview; starting her job; and, well, meeting Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio speaks sweetly of her, how she’s never felt such a way about anyone else before. She wishes they could’ve met her and experienced the sheer force that is this incredible woman. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And her son.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Once she stops talking, the touch - the arm - around her waist catches Rio’s attention. Agatha’s step up to her side and now pulls her close. Rio leans back, resting the side of her head against hers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You talked about me.” It wasn’t a question, but the statement carries curiosity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Had to update them about the changes in my life,” Rio replies, shrugging. “You know, especially the biggest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah? What do they think?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What Rio would give to know the answer to that question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She forces a little grin before teasing, “That you need better taste in vegetables.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes. “Are you sure that message wasn’t directed at </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>?” she counters. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio steps away from Agatha’s hold and grabs her hand. With a gentle tug, she begins to lead them away from the shared tombstone and back towards the car. Once settled back in the front passenger seat, she turns to the other woman and shares a genuine thank you.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing to thank me for,” Agatha replies. “We had the time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But you didn’t have to do this,” Rio points out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She recalls Lilia’s words: how Agatha, from such a young age, loves so fiercely. How she’s drawn away in the reality of how it is not always returned, leaving her so guarded. In their time together, Rio’s learned that maybe it’s not easy for Agatha to always express her feelings as easily as she does herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can I ask you to do something?” Agatha asks out of the blue as they drive away from the cemetery.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Rio says with a nod.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha lingers for a moment, as if silently debating to carry through with the request. Ultimately, albeit bashful, she proceeds, “Can you say something else in Spanish? Please?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha learned that the love she tried showing wasn’t always reciprocated.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, in all her power, will always ensure that it </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Reciprocated, even if neither of them would be rather direct.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She thinks for a moment, heart pounding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Tengo miedo de lo mucho que me gustas</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio, with her dark eyes locked on Agatha whose attention is on the road, finds herself confessing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It scares me how much I like you.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She then admits, “</span>
<em>
<span>Me gustaría usar palabras más fuertes pero.. No quiero que me entiendas.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>I would like to use stronger words, but.. I don’t want you to understand me.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha, none the wiser, replies, “That sounds beautiful.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio returns to school the following day, her ankle miraculously healed. Nicky’s there, too - more subdued that she’s seen him since the start of the academic year. Once an energetic little boy, he sits at his desk, drawn into himself and ignoring the Maximoff twins for most of the morning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There’s a part of her that wants to reach out to Agatha, to ask for advice, but she thinks better of it. She doesn’t want to give her any extra worry, not when Agatha has already informed her of his change in behavior yesterday over lunch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha already knows; Rio’s just now witnessing it for herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky doesn’t join his classmates for lunch. He asks if he can stay in the classroom with her, nodding when Rio asks if he’s sure. The tears welling in his eyes is all the confirmation she needs (he would later admit that Tommy called him a ‘party pooper’ for not joining them for lunch and recess - she would have a word with Tommy later). They have a picnic on their reading circle rug, soon joined by Lilia who peeked into Rio’s classroom when she didn’t show up for their own lunch gathering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio notices Nicky perking up when LIlia explains that she taught his mom when she was his age. With each story shared and every comparison - similarities - between him and his mother expressed, the glint in his eyes slowly returns. The adoration he has for his mother warms her heart and she knows Agatha feels the same way for him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the end of lunch, Rio catches Lilia’s gaze and tilts her head towards the boy who is distracted with cleaning up after himself. She mouths the word ‘Sunday’ and the silent request is met with a nod.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So at the end of the day, Nicky lingers behind, as he often does now - waiting for his classmates to clear the room and Rio for the parking lot to mostly clear before she walks him out to Agatha’s parked car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky runs around the car, to the back right passenger door, as Rio walks up to the driver side, its window already rolled down. Rio leans over, resting her arm against the edge of the door and peeking her head in. Agatha’s turned towards the backseat, however, with her attention fully on Nicky who’s climbing into the car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you have a good day at school, baby?” she asks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mhmm,” Nicky hums, swinging the door close behind him, blissfully unable to recall the rough morning much to Rio’s delight. “Ms. Rio and I had lunch together. And Ms. Calderu joined us!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you now?” Agatha hums right back. She turns towards Rio, gaze lingering a moment too long on her lips before forcing herself to stay locked in on her dark eyes instead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The temptation sits in the middle of her chest, aching, but Rio wills herself to ignore it. She knows it could be quick - a fleeting shared moment between them. As she stands on her ‘completely healed’ ankle, Rio, however, remembers their last rendezvous in the parking lot. So she keeps to herself, very much against her will.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We both needed a low key lunch,” Rio replies with a shoulder shrug. “And I nearly always have lunch with Lilia, so she came looking for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mama,” Nicky speaks up again, earning the attention of both women who crank their necks towards him. “Did you know that Ms. Rio </span>
<em>
<span>can’t</span>
</em>
<span> make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Really</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha laughs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth immediately falls and hangs open. </span>
<em>
<span>That’s</span>
</em>
<span> what he decides to tell his mother? Not any of the stories that Lilia told him over lunch about Agatha? “That’s </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> true!” she remarks, her voice a tad too squeaky for her own liking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We were </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> trying to tell her how to make a sandwich step-by-step, like we wrote in our essays” Nicky continues. He stands up from his seat and hovers over the middle console. “And, Mama, she’s </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> bad at following directions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Am not!” Rio exclaims.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re arguing with a six year old,” Agatha points out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Welcome to my professional life,” Rio grumbles before looking over at Nicky. “And </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span> was I so terrible, you potsticker? Why don’t you tell your mom </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky decides to ignore Rio’s request and continues recounting his own version of the story, ”We told her to put peanut butter on one side and jelly on each side of the bread and you know what she did, Mama? You’ll </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> believe it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did this absolute menace do?” Agatha asks, not even bothering to hide the amusement in her tone. She’s reveling in his excitement - a welcomed change in his demeanor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let me </span>
<em>
<span>defend myself</span>
</em>
<span>-!” Rio tries to speak up, but she’s immediately drowned out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>She put the peanut butter and jelly on the outside of the whole loaf!</span>
</em>
<span>” Nicky exclaims, still in the midst of disbelief at the day’s last lesson. He stares between his mother and Rio with wide eyes. “</span>
<em>
<span>With her bare hands, Mama!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a groan and rests her forehead against her arm, hiding her face from both Harkness. She can hear Agatha throw her head back in laughter and Nicky’s giggle from the backseat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky catches his breath in the middle of Agatha’s laugh and proceeds (because of course he’s going to tell her more about their classroom antics), “Then, Mama! Then, when we told her she needed to </span>
<em>
<span>open</span>
</em>
<span> the plastic bag? Do you know what happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”It was a lesson!” Rio attempts again to defend herself, but her whining tone gets her nowhere. She can’t compete against Nicky’s vivid storytelling, but she continues nonetheless. “In informative and descriptive writing! It’s in the first grade curriculum!  I’m not a </span>
<em>
<span>complete</span>
</em>
<span> menace!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Keep telling yourself that, toots,” Agatha teases before she encourages her son. “No, sweetheart, tell me what happened next.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I ripped the bag open,” Rio mutters with a heavy sigh, answering before Nicky could provide his own perspective. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>From the middle</span>
</em>
<span>!” Nicky stresses. “Bread flew </span>
<em>
<span>everywhere</span>
</em>
<span>! All over the room! It even got on our desks!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“All over,” Rio confirms, still grumbling under her breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Slowly, she tilts her head to the side, allowing her to peek up at Agatha who snorts, mid-laugh. The sudden noise perks Rio up immediately, a smile blossoming on her lips, just as Agatha hides her own face behind her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The top half of Nicky’s body is leaning completely over the console now - he’s practically in Agatha’s lap. “That’s how you know it’s Mama’s </span>
<em>
<span>real </span>
</em>
<span>laugh,” Nicky says matter of factly, nodding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio says fondly, resisting the growing urge to lean further into the car as she watches Agatha wrap her arms around the small boy and pull him into her lap.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky erupts in a sequel of laughter as Agatha peppers his face with kisses. “Stooooop!” he begs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No!” Agatha denies in between kisses. “Someday, I won’t be able to because you’ll be </span>
<em>
<span>too cool</span>
</em>
<span> for your mom, so I’m taking </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> my opportunities </span>
<em>
<span>now</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ms. Rio! Help!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head, chin still resting against her forearm, “Nope, she has a point.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Plus, he just spent the last how long telling this tale painting her as incompetent? Questioned her ability to make a sandwich?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, she refuses to help - at least in this instance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>(Not that she would </span>
<em>
<span>ever</span>
</em>
<span> say that part aloud.)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She watches Agatha hug him tight, planting one last big kiss against his cheek. Agatha turns to her again, matching her smile. “Thank you for keeping him company during lunch,” she says. “Tell Ms. Calderu, too, for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anytime,” Rio nods, finally standing up straight, but her hand remains on the frame of the door. “The kid makes for good company.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky wiggles his way out of Agatha’s arms and scoots himself back over the console into the backseat. “Join us for dinner, Ms. Rio!” he states, hopping back into his seat. He finally buckles himself in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Placing her hands on the steering wheel, Agatha deadpans, “We’re having peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mama’s lying!” Nicky gasps. “She told me tacos this morning!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re working on the concept of sarcasm,” Agatha informs dryly before her voice warms. “Can we give you a ride at the very least?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a quiet laugh, Rio pulls her hand away from the car door and folds her arms over her chest. “I still have a classroom to clean up. Some menace threw bread everywhere-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That was you,” Nicky interrupts to remind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He won’t let her forget.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And speaking of forgetting, before she did, she finally asks (the whole purpose in her walking out with Nicky this afternoon to the parking lot). “Ms. Calderu at lunch this afternoon,” Rio begins slowly, as if afraid she would word this request wrong. “She extended an invitation for Sunday afternoon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sunday afternoon?” Agatha repeats, tilting her head to the side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lunch after I finish up at the coffee shop,” Rio continues, heart now pounding. Why is she nervous? “And setting up the vegetable garden in the backyard, if you’re interested. In both. Or one or the other. I won’t force you to get your hands dirt-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Mama! Can we?” Nicky practically erupts from the backseat. “Ms. Rio, we could do a </span>
<em>
<span>whole</span>
</em>
<span> garden of bean sprouts!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His enthusiasm makes both women smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”It’s uhh, consider it a makeshift family lunch, I guess? Alice will be there, too. You met her,” Rio explains. She pauses for a moment. “It’s a pretty small family.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Introducing me to the makeshift family - seems like a pretty big step, doesn’t it?” Agatha teases.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio feels the blush creeping up her neck. “You don’t have to,” she tries to reel back. “Don’t feel obligated-“ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll be there,” Agatha confirms - a confirmation that causes Nicky to whoop as he hops up and down in his seat. “Send me the info later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Swallowing hard, Rio nods. With butterflies now fluttering about in her stomach, she wonders if maybe she did overstep - if this was too big of a move, especially after the shaking ground they’ve barely departed from. She hadn’t seen it as intensely as Agatha projected; she had only wanted to cheer her budding little gardener up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Too late to take the invitation back now, especially with Nicky so eager.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio weakly gestures over her shoulder towards the school building. “I should get back. You know, before a colony of ants takes over. Or before the custodial staff puts me on their shi— never mind.” She momentarily forgets that she is one, at work and two, still in the presence of a student. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bye, Ms. Rio!” Nicky waves and shouts from the backseat, as if she would have any problem hearing. “See you tomorrow!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”See you tomorrow,” Agatha echoes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bye, Nicky,” Rio replies, matching his wave and his energy - it’s contagious. He’s done a complete 180 from their late morning lunch picnic in their classroom. He’s almost - almost - the energetic little boy she’s come to know. It’s faint, but it’s there: the tiredness and worry from a weight that shouldn’t be placed on his small shoulders - a weight she knows his mother is bearing the most of.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio silently promises to help in any way that she can, on any front that she can.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turns to the older woman with a gentle smile, tone growing softer. “Bye, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Bye, </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She says her name with such warmth and clarity - a hidden apology for Monday’s antics and behavior, not that further apologies were needed or necessary. Regardless, the warmth sits comfortably in Rio’s chest. With one final nod, Rio turns and walks back towards the school. She hears the car shift into reverse and pull away from the spot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Returning to her now empty classroom, Rio busies herself with the intentional mess she made not even an hour ago, finding slices of bread perhaps a tad too far from the front of the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There are a few clear across on the other side of the classroom - just how much force did she rip that plastic bag? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> want to give them a show,” she grumbles, kneeling down with a grunt to fish a couple of slices that landed a bin of books. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At what cost, Vidal?” Rio murmurs, walking over to the half shelving units. She leans over them, taking a peek and counting her blessings; she spots only dust bunnies.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From her desk, her phone vibrates. She crosses back to the other side of the room to fetch it and check.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Señor Scratchy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She still refuses to change the name.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>This is the first time since last Friday that Nicky’s been himself. Thank you for helping him forget, even if for a little while. He’s excited for Sunday.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiles down at the message and quickly types out, </span>
<em>
<span>No problem. I’d do anything to help him. To help you.</span>
</em>
<span>  But Rio immediately hesitates and deletes the last couple of sentences. She nearly starts over and then sends: </span>
<em>
<span>No problem - I’d do anything to help.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a second, she adds, </span>
<em>
<span>He was upset up until then. I’m guessing the news from the appointment is hitting him hard, too?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>It is. It’s been hard to cheer him up. So, again, thank you, Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a smile, she tucks the phone into her pants pocket and then returns to her task at hand, tackling a different corner of the room to glance over. She considers writing the custodial staff a card, already apologizing for the bugs she’s going to potentially attract.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It doesn’t take long for her phone to vibrate again: still Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>He is politely asking/requesting if Señor Scratchy can join us (but please don’t let us impose).</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio can clearly envision Nicky, holding his dear rabbit close to his chest, pleading with Agatha to include their beloved pet. Rio would’ve joined him in a heartbeat because how could they just </span>
<em>
<span>leave</span>
</em>
<span> Scratchy behind during their lunch date?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I’ll ask Lilia and I’ll let you know. Do you think the picture I have of him would be convincing evidence of good behavior?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>No</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha responds immediately, quickly followed by: </span>
<em>
<span>Please don’t show my former first grade teacher a picture of our family rabbit looking like he just committed a heinous murder, Rio. I will not stand for that kind of Scratchy slander.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snorts. </span>
<em>
<span>It’s now your contact image when you call.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Honestly, that very photo almost became Rio’s home screen wallpaper altogether. It must’ve been the best day of that rabbit’s little life: the sheer amount of raspberries he ate, given to him by all three of them to encourage the growing mushy mess so Rio could get the </span>
<em>
<span>best</span>
</em>
<span> Monty Python-sequel photo.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s final text that afternoon is incredibly short - a singular word: </span>
<em>
<span>Menace.</span>
</em>
