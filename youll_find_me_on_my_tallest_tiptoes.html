<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It all started with great-grandfather Santiago Vidal, a journalist so deep in Puerto Rico’s business, his name might as well have had a byline in history. He covered blackouts, uprisings and every political disaster imaginable, frequently from the center of the storm. </p><p>Word on the street is that he once snuck into a governor’s exclusive press conference by hitching a ride in the back of a mariachi band’s van. No one’s quite sure how he pulled it off, but three days later, the governor got impeached and Santiago’s story was front page news.</p><p>His son, Juan Miguel Vidal, picked up the pen where Santiago left off, becoming a household name in the ‘70s for his fearless coverage of the Puerto Rican independence movement and the government’s murkier dealings that most reporters were too scared, or too bought, to touch.</p><p>Then came Mateo Vidal, Rio’s dad, who brought the family legacy stateside and somehow turned sleepy Delaware into headline material. Whether it was a small-town mayor laundering campaign funds or a state senator caught pants-down with a lobbyist, he covered it all, and chased every story relentlessly, fearlessly, right up until the day he didn’t come home.</p><p>Three generations of ink-stained overachievers. </p><p>A family tree built on deadlines, bylines, and sheer journalistic stubbornness. </p><p>So, of course, everyone just assumed Rio would carry the torch. </p><p>And she would have. She badly wanted to.</p><p>She didn’t bust her ass through crappy internships and back-to-back shifts just to claw her way to a journalism degree at NYU for nothing. She meant it. She wanted to be the first woman in the family to out-report, out-write, and out-hustle every man who came before her.</p><p>But life, being the smartass it is, had other plans.</p><p>One botched coffee run, one misunderstood job listing she barely skimmed, and somehow Rio had ended up with “the job a million girls would literally kill for” — junior assistant to a woman known for her terrifying IQ, terrifying wardrobe, terrifying record of never losing an argument, and just being generally terrifying.</p><p>That woman is none other than <b>Agatha Harkness</b> , the famously brilliant editor-in-chief of <em> Nocturne </em>, the most iconic, glamorous, and unapologetically cutthroat fashion magazine on the planet. Neither Agatha nor the magazine had ever appeared on Rio’s radar until about five weeks ago. Not exactly the path she imagined when she dreamed of Pulitzer Prizes and hard-hitting journalism. </p><p>But then again, life rarely sticks to the script.</p><p>“Come on, dude! It’s one day,” Rio hears Alice yell over the blender, which sounds like it’s choking on a rock. “Just call in sick. Literally everyone does it. It’s not a crime. It’s basically a human right at this point." She pauses, only to smack the side of the blender like that’s gonna fix the dying noise it’s making. “And aren’t you, like, her baby assistant? You told me she barely knows you exist. She’ll be fine. She probably won’t even realize you’re gone.”</p><p>Rio drags herself out of her room, wearing an old sweatshirt two sizes too big and nothing but a pair of underwear underneath. She drops into a chair at the kitchen table and grabs the first fruit she sees. It’s one of those rare Sundays when her phone hasn’t already blown up with some kind of work emergency. </p><p>Peace, however fleeting, tastes like sleep breath and Granny Smith.</p><p>“You do realize who we’re talking about here, right?” she says, chewing on a bite of her apple. “I can’t just call in sick. I’ve only had this job for, like, five weeks. That’s like asking for vacation time when they’re still printing my ID. And sure, maybe Agatha won’t notice, but Jen definitely will. And she’d one hundred percent murder me.”</p><p>Alice pokes her head out from behind the blender, holding something green and pulpy. </p><p>“Okay, then let her! You don’t even like the job. You’ve been bitching about it since day one. You don’t care about fashion mags, you don’t even dress like you work at one, and you didn’t even know what a lookbook was when you got hired. So why are you still busting your ass for Satan’s mistress?” </p><p>She slides a mug of coffee across the table, and Rio catches it with both hands before it can spill.</p><p>“Because busting my ass for Satan’s mistress apparently looks great on a resume,” she explains with a straight face. “And as much of a stone-cold, succubus bitch Agatha is, I kinda need her recommendation to get taken seriously. I’ve got to make a solid impression if I even want a shot at The Times. A year at Nocturne and I can pretty much write my own ticket. You know that.”</p><p>Alice drops into a chair, arms crossed. “I mean, I don’t. But what I do know is you’re a damn good writer, and you deserve better than fetching coffee and answering calls for someone who probably doesn’t even know your full name.”</p><p>Rio shrugs, lips brushing the rim of her glass before taking a slow sip. </p><p>“It’s only for a year. I’m not planning on marrying the job or anything.”</p><p>Alice gulps down her green whatever-the-hell. “Yeah, well, a lot can happen in a year. And I still have no idea how you’re surviving a boss that hot. Evil or not, if I had to see her every day, I’d be completely useless, and I’d be drooling on the desk.”</p><p>Rio coughs out a laugh. </p><p>“Well, lucky for both of us, I’m not you. And Agatha’s about as straight as a ruler. She will not be distracting me in any way, because I don’t go for straight girls. And you damn well know that.”</p><p>“And what makes you so sure she’s straight?” Alice says, and Rio just scrunches her nose. “I’m serious. Everything about your boss screams dyke,” she goes on, gesturing with her drink like she’s pointing out obvious landmarks. “Did you not see that People cover? The suit? The pants? Those arms?” She shakes her head like Rio’s the one being ridiculous. “Come on, Rio. You’re not blind.” Then she grins. “And I’m, like, ninety percent sure it’s huge.” </p><p>Rio groans. “Okay, first of all, stop thirsting over my boss. Second, I’m around her pretty much all the time. I answer her calls, and the people calling are always rich guys, boring guys, every flavor of guy. I’m also the one who signs for the endless parade of flower deliveries. And guess what? The cards are always from dudes. Trust me, there’s nothing remotely gay about Agatha Harkness.” </p><p>Alice shrugs. “Fine. She’s your boss, you’d know. But that still doesn’t get you out of tomorrow. I’ve let you bail on, like, every gig, every show, every weird little queer thing I drag you to. But leaving me to go to Pride alone with Billy? That’s betrayal of biblical proportions in this friendship. I’m not babysitting a baby gay all day by myself. So take your pick: Monday at work, or Monday with me.” </p><p>Rio groans again, dragging a hand down her face.</p><p>“You can’t seriously make me choose.”</p><p>“I already am making you choose.”</p><p>“Now, that’s evil. You’re being evil, Alice Wu-Gulliver.”</p><p>But there’s nothing quite as devious as faking a cold and firing off a carefully crafted sick email at four in the morning, strategically late enough that her boss can’t respond with a no, but early enough to make it look like she tried. Evil? Maybe. But also kind of genius. </p><p>Because deep down, Rio knows she wanted this. Pride is fun. Pride has always been fun. And right now, that’s being confirmed in the loudest, gayest, most glorious way possible.</p><p>Rio’s practically singing and dancing down the street, high on the music, the heat, and the sweet freedom of not having to be anybody’s assistant today. She’s wearing ripped jean shorts and a thrifted crop top that says “eat your girl or i will” in cracked, glittery letters. There’s cheap rainbow face paint smeared across her cheeks, glitter in her hair, and someone’s Pride flag tied around her shoulders like a cape.</p><p>She’s flanked by Alice, decked out in red and razor-sharp eyeliner wings, and Billy, the gay kid from next door, who came out just last month: cheeks redder than the stripes on his flag but grinning like he’s finally figured out how to breathe.</p><p>The whole street smells like cannabis, sunscreen, body spray, cigarettes, and rainbow paradise cocktails. Basically, Pride in a bottle. And Rio, though she couldn’t explain it if she tried, just feels everything in her bones. Like home, but much noisier and happier. </p><p>Then a neighboring mob breaks into a chant, and without missing a beat, she and Alice jump in, singing like it’s some hallowed gospel handed down to them by their lesbian ancestors:</p><p>“Every woman is a lesbian at heart,</p><p>Every woman is a lesbian at heart,</p><p>Every woman is a lesbian at heart, </p><p>Including Billy’s mom!” </p><p>They practically scream their own version of the last line, pointing right at the teen walking next to them, who’s laughing so hard he nearly drops his tiny Pride flag.</p><p>“This is probably the best day of my life!” Billy blurts out.</p><p>Rio looks at him. He’s smiling in that stunned, too-happy kind of way, as if he doesn’t totally believe he’s allowed to feel this good. “Kid, you’re seventeen. You’ve had, what, like five good days total?”</p><p>“And this one’s number one!”</p><p>Alice laughs and throws an arm around his shoulders.</p><p>“That’s because you’re not stuck working for Satan’s mistress.”</p><p>Rio flips her off without looking. “I can hear you.”</p><p>Billy looks between them with that same wide-eyed, annoyingly earnest little smile.</p><p>“You guys are so lucky and cool. I wanna be like you when I’m older.”</p><p>“Oh god,” Rio mutters. “Aim higher, kid.”</p><p>He just grins, and for once, Rio’s got nothing to say. The kid gets on her nerves almost daily. Always glued to Alice’s hip, always running his mouth, always poking around in stuff that’s not his business, always hijacking the aux cord to blast Taylor Swift loud enough for her to hear it through her bedroom wall. But seeing him like this — happy, comfortable, finally himself — reminds Rio why she’s always loved going to Pride. And why calling in sick today was absolutely worth it.</p><p>They continue to move with the crowd, dodging between floats, flags, and half-naked strangers until everything suddenly slams to a pause. Something about a stalled float, or maybe a couple of homophobes playing human traffic cones. Whatever it is, the whole street bottlenecks right in the middle of 8th Street. But Rio doesn’t care. The sun’s on her face, the music’s still thumping, and she’s got a cold drink in one hand. She’s good. Totally fine.</p><p>Until, of course, Alice lets out a very loud and very theatrical, “Holy. Shit.”</p><p>Rio turns, brows raised. “What?”</p><p>Alice doesn’t answer. She just stands there, frozen, eyes locked on something past the crowd.</p><p>“Seriously, what is it?” Rio asks again, this time more annoyed.</p><p>Then Alice grabs her arm hard enough to nearly knock the drink out of her hand and points.</p><p>Rio follows with her eyes, peering over a sea of sequins, body glitter, and a bunch of shirtless guys passionately butchering ABBA. And there, maybe twenty feet away, walking through a break in the crowd like some terrifying fashion shark, is Agatha Harkness. Agatha freaking Harkness.</p><p>She’s in head-to-toe black and aviators, looking more like she’s on her way to a funeral than a Pride parade, with that usual look on her face like the world kind of grosses her out. But what really surprises Rio more is the girl hanging off her arm. A walking rainbow, all blonde hair, heart-shaped sunglasses, and a bubblegum pink romper, smiling like she’s never had a bad day in her life.</p><p>“Didn’t you say your boss was straight?” Alice says, eyes still glued to the scene in front of them. “Then why does someone who looks exactly like her just happen to be at Pride...with what looks a whole lot like a hot, gorgeous, probably very gay date?”</p><p>Alice’s jaw is on the pavement, and Rio’s stomach instantly drops like it just got personally yeeted into the underworld to be gnawed on by Hades and Persephone’s joint custody hellhounds.</p><p>“No,” Rio blurts, way too fast, whipping her head in the other direction. “That’s impossible. What the hell would she even be doing here? That’s definitely someone else.” </p><p>“I don’t think it is,” Rio hears Alice say, and she risks another glance, just to be sure. And if it is indeed her freakishly terrifying boss, they’re running. And sure enough, big mistake.</p><p>Because the second she looks again, those unmistakable piercing blue eyes lock onto hers. One second. Maybe two. But it feels like Rio’s entire soul just got siphoned straight out of her body.</p><p>Even behind those massive, unnecessarily intimidating aviators, Rio can tell Agatha is just as surprised. She’s only been working for her a little over a month, but she’s been observant enough to know the small tells. The tight clench in her jaw. The barely-there purse of her lips. The slight twitch of her eyebrow.</p><p>They’re all there. Right there. Flashing across her face in less than a second before she smooths it over with that usual picture of deathly calm and cold neutrality. </p><p>“Oh, shit. That is her, isn’t it?”</p><p>Alice nods and swallows, probably realizing she just dragged Rio straight to her doom. </p><p>Rio stares, wide-eyed, praying this is some kind of stress-induced mirage. But it’s not.</p><p>“I’m getting fired,” she mutters under her breath. “Fuck. I’m so getting fired.”</p><p>“Okay, stop overthinking,” Alice argues, not even slowing down. “She probably doesn’t even recognize you. Didn’t you say you’re not even sure she knows you exist half the time? So just act cool, man. Keep walking like we don’t see her. And for the love of God, don’t look her way.”</p><p>Billy, completely out of the loop, squints ahead. “Wait, who are we not looking at?”</p><p>“Just keep walking, kid,” Rio exclaims, yanking her pride flag around like it’s a damn invisibility cloak.</p><p>The universe, meanwhile, being the little shit that it is, laughs and refuses to let the crowd move. Some float’s still jammed up ahead, so no one’s going anywhere. Which means Rio is now standing exactly twenty feet — twenty painfully clear, obstacle-free feet — away from Agatha and her rainbow arm candy of a date. Rio clutches her drink closer, resisting the impulse to melt into the asphalt.</p><p>“Is she still looking?” Billy asks, not helping.</p><p>Alice slowly turns her head halfway, then snaps it back. </p><p>“Shit. She’s definitely still looking.”</p><p>“Of course she’s still looking,” Rio hisses. “She knows it’s me.” </p><p>Rio’s stomach once again drops straight into her Pride socks. She takes a slow sip of her drink and tries not to keel over. Her heart’s pounding in her ears, and the panic is crawling up her throat. She looks again. Agatha is still staring. Like she already fired Rio in her head and is now picking out the font for the email. Fired and probably blacklisted. Hell, she might not even be allowed to read The Times after this. </p><p>She swallows. Fuck. Why the hell would someone like Agatha Harkness be at Pride of all places? </p><p>The woman hates everything. She probably has a running list. She hates crowds. She hates fun. She hates loud noises, bright colors, glitter, children, brunch, small talk, joy in general. She probably hates the gays too. And now, thanks to Rio’s dumbass decision to fake a cold and show up here, she’s definitely been added to that list. Fuck. She is so getting fired tomorrow.</p><hr/><p>The next day, Rio walks into the office like she’s headed to her own funeral. </p><p>This is it. The end of her journalism career. Dead. Buried. Cremated. And it didn’t even get a chance to live. She’s packing up, moving back to Delaware, buying a chunk of sad dirt behind a Wawa, and becoming a goddamn farmer. A disgraced lesbian tomato farmer. </p><p>And sure, she likes her little window garden in their shoebox apartment, but she didn’t survive three unpaid internships and that one time she cried in a restaurant freezer just to end up growing kale for the rest of her life. But now it’s all over. </p><p>All because she straight-up lied to Agatha Harkness. A woman who considers lying a fucking felony. </p><p>By the time Rio drops into her desk, she’s already drafted six versions of her resignation letter in her head, ranging from formal and weepy to one that just says “sorry” in Comic Sans and a sad face. </p><p>But weirdly, spookily, horrifyingly enough, Agatha just strolls in like she didn’t catch her junior assistant gay-panicking twenty feet away at Pride yesterday.</p><p>Is it really possible she didn’t recognize her? No. That’s impossible. A woman like Agatha doesn’t forget a face, Rio thinks. Still, she clings to the microscopic thread of hope that maybe, just maybe, her boss didn’t clock her lie, and forces herself to get on with her day.</p><p>As usual, Agatha asks for her coffee. Agatha asks for the lookbook. Agatha tells Jen, and Jen tells Rio to email seven different people, find a photographer, and track down a vintage Galliano jacket that may or may not even exist. Which, in Rio’s personal dictionary of working for Agatha, translates to: business as terrifyingly, unnervingly, aggressively typical. Or so she thinks. </p><p>Because by the time lunch rolls around — if you can even call it that, since she never actually gets one — her phone won’t stop ringing. She’s got it pinned between her shoulder and ear, juggling fifteen garment bags like an overworked octopus while trying not to get flattened by traffic on Wall Street.</p><p>“Are you there yet?” Jen barks through the phone. “I swear, I don’t know why I have to keep repeating myself, but she wants fifteen of those pleated sculpted skirts from Calvin Klein. Fifteen, Rio. Do you have them with you? Please tell me you have them, because she’s suddenly in one of her moods again.” </p><p>“Yes, uh, I have them here,” Rio says, barely getting a breath in before Jen steamrolls right on.</p><p>“Oh, and Studio 5B needs to be booked for 8 am tomorrow, not nine. Let the downstairs team know about the schedule change. Also, tell Sue to rethink those shiny metallic purses Monica just sent over for the Pride shoot in Williamsburg. She took one look and said they belonged in a clearance bin at a gas station in Reno. Don’t actually say that to them, obviously, but you know the drill.”</p><p>Jen doesn’t stop.</p><p>“Also, tell Carol she’s taking Kamala for the run-through this afternoon if Kate’s still stuck in Tokyo. Unless Kamala’s eye is still twitching, if it is, forget it. You know how Agatha feels about twitchy interns. And while you’re out, swing by Hermès and pick up those thirty-five scarves we ordered for her last week.”</p><p>Rio moves the phone against her shoulder, trying to avoid dropping all fifteen garment bags or getting hit by a bike. She opens her mouth to ask a question, but Jen’s still going.</p><p>“And she stepped out to meet with Mr. Stark, but she’ll want another Starbucks when she gets back. Scalding hot. Like, burn-your-tongue-off hot, Rio. Not whatever sad lukewarm crap you handed her last week. And she needs you back here by one.” Rio checks her watch. It’s already 12:15. Fucking hell. </p><p>“But how am I supposed to—” and the line drops before Rio can even finish the sentence. </p><p>Okay. Maybe Rio was wrong earlier. Maybe Agatha did recognize her. Maybe Rio is really getting fired today. Maybe this is Satan’s mistress orchestrating her final punishment: one last impossible to-do list before she slams that termination letter on Rio’s desk and banishes her soul to fucking purgatory.</p><p>Rio stumbles back into the office at 1:10. </p><p>“Is there some world-ending reason why my coffee isn’t here yet? Did she drop dead or something?” Agatha sounds mad enough to murder. Unlike earlier, her office is now packed with people from downstairs doing some kind of run-through, and judging by the way her tone could kill a man, Jen definitely wasn’t kidding about her mood taking a hard left.</p><p>Before Rio can even catch her breath, Jen appears out of nowhere like a bat out of hell, snatching the coffee right out of her hand. “What the hell took you so long? Dump those bags in there before she sees you,” she snaps, already turning on her heel. Then, without missing a beat, she gives Rio a once-over and adds, “And for God’s sake, check a mirror. You look like shit.” </p><p>And Rio fights the overwhelming urge to curse, cry, or combust.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon feels like a slow, painful death by a thousand errands, which, to be fair, is pretty on brand for her job. She’s been at it for a while now. Five weeks is a while. And in all that time, Agatha hasn’t really spoken to her directly, hasn’t looked her in the eye, and pretty much acts like she’s invisible.</p><p>Today, however, feels unusually brutal and extra hellish, because Rio just knows, deep in her gut, that Agatha is now fully aware she exists. She’s a gut girl. Always has been. Her gut told her not to eat gas station sushi once, and it saved her life. </p><p>So, when her gut says Agatha knows, she believes it. And whatever this treatment is, her boss is doing it on purpose. Rio isn’t just being overworked, she’s being tortured. And somehow, this is worse than being fired on the spot.</p><p>By 7 pm, the floor starts to empty out. One by one, people shuffle off to their cats, their dinner reservations, or whatever it is that normal, functioning adults with salaries do after work. </p><p>Jen gets sent to meet a supplier on Bleecker Street, leaving Rio alone with Agatha, who’s in her office, probably nose-deep in her laptop or the so-called book.</p><p>Rio is used to waiting for her boss to leave before she does. She’s done it a hundred times. But tonight feels more loaded. Like she’s being led to her own execution.</p><p>And then, right on cue, it happens.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha calls from her office.</p><p>And Rio pretends that hearing her name, maybe for the first time, from Agatha’s mouth doesn’t send a shiver down her spine. Of course Satan’s mistress finally learned her name. People always name their sacrifices before throwing them into the volcano.</p><p>Rio’s stomach twists into a pretzel as she stands in front of Agatha’s table, watching her read something with that unreadable expression. She feels like she’s about to be skinned alive and turned into a limited-edition handbag. For a solid five seconds, she actually considers making a run for it. Or hurling herself out the window. Whichever’s faster. Then Agatha speaks, still without looking up.</p><p>“You were editor-in-chief of The Washington Square back in college, is that correct?”</p><p>Rio blinks. The question visibly catches her off guard, not because it’s not true, but because it’s coming from her boss. Nonetheless, she manages a quiet, “Yes.”</p><p>Agatha still doesn’t look up. Just flips a page in the file she’s holding.</p><p>“It also says here you once won some national competition for college journalists. Something about undocumented workers in Sussex County. The piece that blew open that mess with the fake employment records from that state senator’s office. Is this true?” </p><p>Rio’s stunned for a second. She hadn’t expected Agatha to be holding her file, let alone to have actually read it. But she finds her voice, and manages another, “Yes.”</p><p>“Did I accidentally hire someone whose entire vocabulary is just yes?”</p><p>Rio’s spine straightens. “No. I mean, sorry. I just...I don’t know why you’re asking me all this.”</p><p>“Well, since you allegedly spent four years of your life devoted to journalism, I’m assuming you can name the first global charter of ethics for journalists. Should be floating around in that head somewhere, no?”</p><p>Rio nearly chokes. “What?” </p><p>Where the hell is she going with this?</p><p>“Haven’t you learned, in all your weeks here, that I don’t like repeating myself?”</p><p>Rio clears her throat, scrambling. “Right. I-I’m sorry. I think, um, I think there are sixteen core principles. The first one’s about respecting the facts and the public’s right to the truth and—”</p><p>Agatha leans back in her chair, looking vaguely satisfied. “The truth. There it is.” </p><p>And then, finally, their eyes meet. It’s only for a second, but it lands like a punch to Rio’s gut.</p><p>It’s the first time she’s really looked into Agatha’s blue eyes up close, and they’re somehow colder and more beautiful than she expected. She tries to hold the stare, but it’s like looking straight into an eclipse. Blinding, dangerous, and a little too breathtaking for her own good. </p><p>She drops her eyes to the floor before she forgets how to breathe.</p><p>“I actually spent all day wondering if I’d ever hear that word from you,” Agatha says calmly. “You know, considering you straight-up lied to me.” </p><p>Rio goes still. She tries not to picture Agatha thinking about her all day, because that would be stupid, especially given the impending doom she’s about to face. Her mouth opens, then shuts, then opens again like a broken vending machine. Not a single word comes out.</p><p>“What you do outside these walls is entirely your business,” Agatha continues. “You want to dance in the street? Wrap yourself in a rainbow flag? Paint your face and scream your lungs out to bubblegum pop at 2 pm? Go for it. Knock yourself out. I really don’t care what you do when you’re not at work. Spend them however you want. Glitter, flags, half-naked dancers, whatever. I truly don’t give a damn.” </p><p>There’s a pause, and Rio feels like she’s about to pass out.</p><p>“What I do care about is being lied to. And I do not tolerate being lied to.”</p><p>Rio swallows. God, this is humiliating.</p><p>“I know. I understand. What I did was really stupid. There’s no excuse for it. I lied, and I’m really sorry,” She hesitates, then adds, “And if you’re going to fire me, just please—”</p><p>“I didn’t say I was firing anyone.”</p><p>Rio’s head snaps up. “What?” </p><p>She blinks. That definitely wasn’t in the mental script she’d been rehearsing.</p><p>Instead, Agatha reaches into her bag, pulls out a sleek black envelope, and hands it to her. </p><p>“There’s a restaurant address inside. You’re going to pick up the most expensive bouquet you can find, go there, and give it to the person waiting. Tell them I’m running late because of a meeting, but I’ll be arriving shortly. Whatever happens, do not let them leave. I don’t care how you do it. Just make sure they’re still sitting there when I walk in. Got it? Or do I need to start repeating myself again?”</p><p>Rio blinks again. “You, uh, you want me to deliver flowers? Like, for you?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes land on her again, like she’s seriously debating whether to fire Rio, just like she probably intended to in the first place. “Unless, of course, you’d rather be unemployed.” </p><p>Rio quickly shuts her mouth and grabs the envelope. “Nope. Got it. Flowers. Restaurant. Don’t let them leave.” She starts backing out the door, confused as hell but at least still in one piece. </p><p>Rio buys the flowers. Thank God her mom was one of those women who believed knowing your florals was just as important as knowing your algebra. So she picks out the biggest, most dramatic-ass bouquet she can find: peonies, lilies, and anything else that looks expensive. Something that screams, “Sorry I’m late, sorry I’m a bitch, but mostly sorry I’m late.”</p><p>She grabs a cab, rides with the bouquet squished awkwardly in her lap, and still has no idea what the hell she’s doing. She’s not fired, that’s the good news. The bad news is…well, this. Being Agatha Harkness’s personal gay flower courier apparently.</p><p>The restaurant is one of those obnoxiously fancy places that makes you feel poor the second you walk in. Rio asks the host for Agatha’s reservation and gets directed to a two-top with those ridiculously high-backed chairs that make it nearly impossible to see who’s actually sitting there. But as she gets closer, she finally gets a good look at Agatha's date.</p><p>Seated alone with her back to the entrance, nursing what looks like the last five minutes of a martini, is the blonde. Yes, the same blonde from the parade. Big smile, heart-shaped glasses, pink romper. Except now, the romper’s been swapped for something classier, the heart-shaped glasses are gone, and she looks thoroughly pissed off.</p><p>“You must be the messenger,” the blonde says as Rio walks up.</p><p>Rio clears her throat. “Hi. Um, yeah. Agatha sent me to let you know she’s still in a meeting and will be running a little late. But she’s definitely coming. She just has a full-on schedule today.”</p><p>The blonde just stares at her. “Of course she is. She’s always on her own damn schedule.”</p><p>She says it in a way that’s both calm and absolutely done. Like she’s been through this exact situation a hundred times. She picks up her drink, downs the last sip, then sets it down with a little clink like a period.</p><p>“She said she’ll be here shortly,” Rio adds, though she honestly has no idea if that’s true.</p><p>The blonde gives a short, dry laugh. “Tell her not to bother. Whatever this is, it’s done.”</p><p>“Wait, what? No, no, no, please. Just give her a few more minutes,” Rio stammers, stepping in like she might actually block the exit. Which, for the record, she’s about 80 percent ready to do. Legality pending. “She really said she’s coming. She wanted to see you.”</p><p>“I said, tell her not to bother,” the blonde says. “We’re done.”</p><p>“No, seriously. Just hang on a few more minutes. Please. She’s coming, I swear.”</p><p>“She always does this,” the blonde continues. “She says she cares. She makes the plans. And then she doesn’t show. And somehow, I’m the one left sitting here like an idiot.”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth, but the blonde keeps going. </p><p>“If she really wanted to see me, she’d be here by now. Not sending you, with an overpriced apology bouquet like that’s supposed to fix anything.”</p><p>“She does want to see you,” Rio insists. “I swear she does.”</p><p>But the blonde shakes her head, already standing. “Tell your boss I’m done. Done begging for scraps of her time. I’m done waiting around, pretending like I don’t see exactly where I fall on her list of priorities. If she ever wants real commitment in her life, she needs to figure out how to make people feel like they’re more than just filler in her fucking calendar. And maybe stop being married to her fucking job.”</p><p>She grabs her purse and slings it over her shoulder. “Hope she and her job have a nice life together. Really stupid of me to think I’d ever come first.”</p><p>And before Rio can think of anything else to say or do, like maybe duct-tape her to the chair, the blonde turns on her heel and walks straight out the door. </p><p>Rio is left standing there, holding $200 worth of flowers and looking like the last girl picked for dodgeball. She sits down slowly in the now-empty chair, plops the bouquet on the table, and exhales.</p><p>“Oh, I’m so dead.” </p><hr/><p>Almost an hour has passed since the blonde walked out, but Rio’s still parked in the same chair. Not because she wants to. But because she’s literally frozen in the goddamn chair. The flowers are sprawled across the table like a fainting Victorian lady. Even they seem embarrassed to still be here. She half-expects them to apologize for not doing a better job of keeping the blonde in her seat.</p><p>“What the hell am I supposed to do now?” Rio tells herself. She can’t call Agatha. That’s just asking to finally get fired over speakerphone. So she does the only logical thing left: she waits. Might as well get fired face-to-face, like a woman with dignity.</p><p>She sighs and opens her phone, mostly just to give her hands something to do besides sweat. She types in what little she knows: Agatha Harkness Dating History. And sure enough, the algorithm delivers. A few blind items on Reddit all seem to point to a Natalia Romanova. Dancer at the New York City Ballet.</p><p>Rio squints at the screen. The blonde finally has a name.</p><p>“Huh,” she mutters. “Gotta hand it to her. Agatha’s got taste.”</p><p>Then it hits her all over again like a glitter brick: <em> Agatha. Harkness. Is. A. Dyke. </em></p><p>She slumps in her seat, almost horrified. </p><p>She should’ve known. God, of course Rio should’ve known. How could she have missed the very obvious fact that her boss might not, in fact, be straight? “What kind of lesbian am I?” she whispers to herself. “How the hell did I not know?” Then she turns to the bouquet next to her. “You knew, didn’t you?”</p><p>But before the bouquet of flowers can even start surprising her and magically sprout a mouth, a soft quick kiss lands square on Rio’s left cheek, and she instantly freezes. </p><p>“Sorry,” says a familiar voice. “Tony wouldn’t stop going on about her wife and—”</p><p>Rio whips her head around so fast her neck cracks. And there she is. Agatha. Agatha freaking Harkness. Her boss. Leaning in way too close, eyes just as wide and stunned as Rio feels.</p><p>“You’re not—” Agatha blinks. “What are you still doing here? And where the hell is she?”</p><p>Rio stammers, still recovering from the fact that her boss just kissed her. Planets have formed entire moons in less time than it’s taking her brain to reboot. </p><p>“She…she left,” Rio finally gets out. “Almost an hour ago.”</p><p>Something flashes over Agatha’s face.</p><p>Disappointment, perhaps. Or confusion. Perhaps both. There’s even a short epiphany of embarrassment, something Rio had no idea Agatha was capable of. But in true Agatha fashion, she snaps back quickly. She straightens her back, wipes the emotion off her face like she’s brushing away a stain, and just like that, she’s unreadable again.</p><p>“She left an hour ago and you didn’t think to tell me?”</p><p>Rio stumbles over her words. “I’m sorry. I was going to, but I just didn’t know how to tell you. I even thought about body-blocking her, I really did. I tried to stall, but she just wasn’t having it. I’m so sorry, Agatha. If you’re gonna fire me, I get it. I’ll write my resignation tonight and hand it in first thing tomorrow.”</p><p>She stands up, already picturing her career crashing in slow motion.</p><p>Agatha sinks into the empty chair across from her. “Why do you keep thinking I’m going to fire you?” she says, sounding more exhausted than angry. “Sit down.”</p><p>Rio stares. “What?”</p><p>“Did all the glitter from yesterday rot your hearing? I said sit.”</p><p>And Rio sits. </p><p>“I dropped a small fortune on this damn reservation,” she says, yanking a napkin onto her lap. “And I’m not about to sit here like some pitiful charity case waiting for a pity date. You’re going to eat, and you’re going to act like it’s the best meal you’ve ever had. That’s how you’re going to thank me for not firing your lying, barely-competent little ass. Are we clear?”</p><p>Rio stares at her, still stunned. “So, you’re not mad?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m furious,” Agatha replies, “But I’m also starving.” </p><p>Then she picks up the menu and flags the waiter down like the last two minutes didn’t even happen.</p><p>The wine arrives first, followed by the meal, and they just sit there, eating in a silence so thick, every clink of the fork sounds ten times louder than it should. </p><p>Across the table, Agatha eats with the slow, mechanical elegance of someone who’s been wealthy too long to chew with her mouth open. Rio keeps stealing glances at her, careful not to get caught, and says nothing. And for a second, she seriously contemplates faking her own death. It’s surely easier than whatever the hell this is.</p><p>By the time the check comes, she feels like she has aged ten years. They step outside together, awkward as hell, standing in silence at the curb while the valet calls for Agatha’s car. Rio clears her throat. “These were supposed to be for her,” and holds out the bouquet, as if her boss even needs reminding.</p><p>Agatha does not even look at it. “What exactly do you expect me to do with it? Water it with gratitude?” she replies, stepping forward as the car pulls up. “Just keep it. Put it in a vase. Or the trash. Whichever feels more appropriate.” Then she climbs into the car without waiting for a reply.</p><p>Rio spends the whole night thinking about Agatha. </p><p>Not that she didn’t try not to, but the stupid flowers on her nightstand make that mission impossible. They just sit there in a vase, smug and expensive-looking, like a scented reminder that her boss (who she has now officially confirmed is extremely gay) kissed her on the cheek and then practically blackmailed her into some bougie dinner. She keeps slapping herself in the face, counting sheep and regrets at the same time. This could’ve happened to any poor assistant, she tells herself. Over and over. Like a bedtime lie.</p><hr/><p>The next morning, and the five mornings after that, are pretty much the same. Agatha is still Agatha. Still terrifying. Still demanding. Still allergic to small talk. Still expecting her coffee exactly how she likes it. And Rio is still Rio. Still gets the coffee. Still grabs the lunch. Still answers the calls. Still de-coats and de-bags her boss like a very gay bellhop.</p><p>But now, for some reason, Agatha actually calls her by her name. Not Jen. Not Rachel. Not Renee. Not Riley or Rita. Not even “that girl who sits outside my office.” But  just Rio. Like she finally decided to learn it, or worse, like she’d always known it and just didn’t feel like using it until now.</p><p>And God, Rio really loves the way her name sounds coming out of Agatha’s mouth. It’s like getting a gold star and a slap from a terrifying high school teacher who finally remembered she exists. Either way, it’s weirdly hot, and she’s absolutely not proud of that.</p><p>And another curiously specific thing Rio notices is that Agatha stares at her sometimes. And it’s not the usual terrifying, soul-piercing boss stare, but something else. Like she’s not just looking at Rio, but looking into her. And Rio has no idea what to do with that. Except, of course, allow her foolish, functioning heart to do that idiotic little skip it has absolutely no business doing.</p><p>“She just got in from Paris and now she wants the mock-up dropped off at her place tonight,” Jen says, tossing a key at Rio, who barely manages to catch it. “I don’t know what’s up with her lately, or what the hell you did, but whatever it is, guard that key, and the book, like your life depends on it, okay? I’m serious. Lose either, and we’re both dead.”</p><p>Even before Rio can get a word in, Jen’s already marching toward her desk. “Alright, listen up,” she says, snapping her fingers. “The book will be ready around ten. Maybe ten-thirty if the layout guys stop dicking around. But you wait for it. Then you grab it, pick up her dry cleaning from the front, and a car’s gonna take you straight to her townhouse.”</p><p>She plants both hands on Rio’s desk and leans in. “Agatha is a very private person. She doesn’t like other people in her space. Only a handful even know where she lives. So here’s what you do: you let yourself in, and walk straight through the front door. Don’t talk to anyone. Don’t look at anyone. You’re a ghost there, Rio. A ghost. Got it?” </p><p>Rio nods. “Right. Casper my way in, Casper my way out.” </p><p>Jen just rolls her eyes. Rio knows the woman in front of her is probably still wondering how the hell Agatha ended up hiring her in the first place. Rio still remembers showing up to that interview: scuffed-up boots, black jeans, a wrinkled button-down she’d stolen from an ex, and the way Jen had looked her up and down like she’d just walked in from a hardware store.</p><p>“You go in,” she continues, “Hang the dry cleaning in the closet right across from the stairs. Drop the book on the table next to the flowers, and you leave. No wandering around. No poking through drawers. No snooping. And don’t even think about opening her fridge.”</p><p>“Jesus, okay,” Rio says, throwing her hands up. “I’m not trying to move in, Jen.”</p><p>Rio keeps Jen’s instructions in her head like a checklist. She waits upstairs for the book, and just like clockwork, it shows up at 10:15. She grabs it, heads downstairs, spots the black car already idling out front, and gets in. It’s a twenty-minute ride to the Upper East Side, and Rio spends all twenty of those minutes sweating bullets, clutching the mock-up on her lap like it’s a newborn.</p><p>When the car eventually comes to a stop in front of Agatha’s townhouse, Rio sits for a moment, squinting at it. She can’t help but stare at the house, which looks like old money had a baby with good taste and had no idea what rent was. The type of place which makes people forget about the garbage piles, subway rats, and existential anxiety, and fools them into believing New York is attractive instead of merely noisy, filthy, and ridiculously expensive.</p><p>When she gets to the front, she enters as discreetly as possible. The entire place is dead silent, making Rio instinctively walk on her toes, even though it doesn’t look like anyone’s around. She heads straight for the closet across from the stairs and hangs up the dry cleaning. Then she turns around and freezes.</p><p>There isn’t just one table with a vase of flowers. There are three. Three tables. Three vases. And one very stressed-out Rio frozen in the middle of the foyer. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” she mutters to herself, eyes darting between the three different floral arrangements.</p><p>She pulls her phone from her blazer pocket, ready to call Jen and ask where the hell this damn book is supposed to go, when voices from upstairs stop her cold.</p><p>“I don’t understand why you even bother coming here if all you’re going to do is criticize every choice I make,” Agatha snaps from upstairs. “I’m a grown-ass adult. I don’t need a running commentary from you every time I breathe. My life is perfectly fine. Why is that so hard to accept, like how normal parents do?”</p><p>There’s a pause, followed by the distinct sound of heels on hardwood and the colder, clipped accent of a considerably older woman. “Fine? This is what you call fine? Living alone in this city, squandering your potential, throwing away your education on useless periodicals, and running around with God knows who? You went to Harvard, Agatha, for God’s sake. This isn’t a real career. You should be helping your father. You should be home with us. Settling down. With someone appropriate.” </p><p>Rio hears Agatha let out a dry, bitter laugh. She knows she should move, leave, do anything but stand there frozen in the hallway. “Oh, of course it’s about that. It’s always about that, isn’t it, Mother?” She hears her continue. “You want me to come home so you can keep pretending nothing about me makes you uncomfortable. Well, newsflash, that part of me isn’t going anywhere.”</p><p>“You watch how you talk to me.” </p><p>There’s another beat of silence before Agatha’s voice cuts through again. </p><p>“Just please leave. I’m asking you nicely while I still have an ounce of respect left for you as my mother. But if you ever show up uninvited again, I won’t think twice about filing a restraining order. You really want your church friends and country club pals to find out your own daughter had to legally cut you off? What do you think God would say about that?”</p><p>Another beat of silence, then: “I should’ve done something the second I saw the signs,” her mother spits, voice dripping with disgust. “I kept praying you’d grow out of this...monstrosity. But you’ve only gotten worse. Sometimes I wonder if the Lord only gave you to us just to test how much shame one family can take. You’ve been nothing but a disappointment. Right from the start.”</p><p>Rio feels something twist hard in her chest. She hadn’t even realized how tightly she’d been clutching the book until the words sank in. How the hell does a mother say something like that to her own child? </p><p>Then she hears footsteps coming down the stairs. Rio stands frozen, holding her breath, until Agatha’s mother materializes. The old woman gives her a brief, cold look, as if she wasn’t surprised someone else heard her say all that. Like Rio was just part of the furniture. </p><p>Then she walks right past without saying a word.</p><p>Just as Rio’s about to step back, Agatha appears at the top of the stairs. </p><p>Rio freezes again when their eyes meet. Agatha looks shaken, clearly still reeling from the fight with her mother, and genuinely surprised to see her there. For a brief moment, something passes over her face, as if she’s trying to figure out how much Rio has heard. “What are you doing here?” she asks.</p><p>Rio swallows hard. She pushes down the wave of pity climbing up her throat and tries to keep her face neutral, though she is aware, she’s doing a terrible job of it. </p><p>Because this isn’t the Agatha she knows. This isn’t the commanding, unshakeable editor-in-chief of the most cutthroat magazine in the city. This Agatha is barefoot, clad in a silky floral kimono, her hair falling in loose, unkempt waves. She doesn’t look the least bit terrifying. She looks like a kid who just got yelled at and is trying really hard not to fall apart. Or cry.</p><p>“I-I was just dropping off the book,” she explains, “You asked Jen to have it delivered tonight, but I wasn’t sure which table I was supposed to leave it on so—”</p><p>“Just leave it in there,” she says, tilting her head toward the living room. She doesn’t sound angry. Just tired. Bone-deep tired, the kind Rio’s never heard from her before.</p><p>Rio nods without saying anything and walks over. She sets the thick book down on a table beside a vase of flowers: azaleas, she realizes right away. Her mami’s favorite too. Then she turns and heads back to the foyer. </p><p>Agatha is standing by the door, arms folded and staring straight ahead. Rio knows she should just walk past. That would be the wise thing to do. But she has never been good at shutting up when it matters. And something about seeing Agatha like this prompts her to speak. </p><p>“You’re not a disappointment,” Rio says gently. When Agatha doesn’t reply and keeps her eyes ahead, she adds, “I know I haven’t worked for you that long, but I’ve seen enough to know that.” </p><p>She watches Agatha’s jaw clench. A breath, then a small shake of her shoulders as she brushes her hair back. “I don’t remember asking for your opinion,” Agatha says bluntly. “And now that your task here is done, I’d appreciate it if you could see yourself out.” She doesn’t wait for a response. Just turns and walks back up the stairs without looking back.</p><hr/><p>The day after that, Rio’s running stupidly late for work. Because of course, the one day the MTA decides to throw a tantrum is the exact day she’s supposed to be in the office by 8 am. Sharp. The Starbucks line doesn’t help her either. Some poor intern behind the counter messes up three drinks in a row and nearly starts a riot. People were two misspelled names away from flipping tables.</p><p>By the time Rio gets her order, she’s practically sprinting the last few blocks, trying not to spill scalding coffee all over herself. She rushes into the building and bolts straight for the elevator, only to find Agatha already inside, and alone. And that’s the thing. Agatha is always alone.</p><p>It’s basically gospel across all forty floors of Stark Publishing that no one rides the elevator with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Doesn’t matter what department you’re in, how high up you are on the masthead, or if you're two minutes from getting fired.</p><p>If she’s already in there, you wait for the next one. </p><p>Rio hesitates, fully expecting a death glare or maybe just the doors to slide shut in her face. But instead, Agatha gives her a single look, rolls her eyes like it physically pains her, and tosses her the world’s tiniest nod. Still, Rio takes it like a golden ticket and slips inside before she can change her mind.</p><p>The doors swing shut, and just like that, the air goes dead silent. Thank God for the cheesy elevator music, Rio thinks, though under normal circumstances, she would rather be hit by a bus than willingly enjoy smooth jazz. They’ve barely made it to floor 20 when Agatha finally says something.</p><p>“From now on, you will be the one bringing the book to my house at the end of each day,” she says, as if the decision has already been made and Rio is simply catching up. “The key that Jen gave you is now your responsibility. I expect it to remain safe with you, and that there will be no incidents involving burglary, murder, or anything else that might warrant police attention.”</p><p>Rio blinks, about to say something, when Agatha raises a finger without even glancing up. “I’m not finished.” Rio's mouth shuts instantly. “You will bring the book to my place every evening. I’ll go over it, leave notes, and it’ll be back on my desk by morning. From now on, that is the new routine, well, yours anyway. The book doesn’t end its day here. It sleeps at my place. Make absolutely certain that happens without fail. Understood?”</p><p>“Y-Yes. Yes, Agatha,” Rio answers, dumbfounded, and still convinced she’d fucked up the job last night.</p><p>The elevator dings.</p><p>“Good.” Agatha steps out. “I do love a girl who knows how to take simple instructions.” She says it without turning around, but Rio swears there’s a hint of something else in her tone that makes her forget how to breathe for a second. Then, over her shoulder, she adds. “And Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?” </p><p>“That coffee better still be scalding when it reaches my desk. We’ve got a long day today.” </p><hr/><p>By the end of another week, Rio has the routine down to a rhythm. Pick up the dry cleaning. Wait for the book. Let herself into Agatha’s townhouse. Drop it off in the living room. Then head home. The incident from that first night, or anything even remotely like it, never happened again.</p><p>And every time since, the house has always been dead silent whenever she slips in, except for that one time she found Agatha in the living room, sitting cross-legged on the couch, completely absorbed in a thick book. She didn’t even look up, and Rio didn’t stick around long enough to see what the cover said.</p><p>Every day starts feeling like the exact same loop, until a random Tuesday, when Agatha doesn’t show up to work. And that never happens. Because Agatha does <em> not </em> miss work. When she’s not out of the country for Fashion Week or off at some exclusive invite from the Met or Anna Wintour herself, she practically lives in her office. She doesn’t take days off. Not for birthdays, not for holidays, not even during that suspicious package scare in the building last year, according to Jen.</p><p>Still, Rio follows the routine. Picks up the dry cleaning, waits for the book, grabs it, heads downstairs, slides into the car, and makes her way to Agatha’s place. It’s supposed to be like every other evening. </p><p>But the second she steps inside on that same random Tuesday and heads to the living room, she knows something’s off. Things look different. There’s a trail of used tissues leading from the couch to the floor, a half-drunk mug of tea sitting cold on the table, and a blanket crumpled in a sad little heap near the rug.</p><p>She debates whether to just ignore it and do what she came here to do. But then she notices the door to Agatha’s home office is open. She knows she shouldn’t, but the word just slips out before she can stop it. </p><p>“Agatha?” </p><p>No one answers, so Rio steps in farther, her shoes tapping softly against the hardwood like a metronome for her rising panic. That’s when she sees Agatha, lying facedown on the floor. </p><p>Rio drops the book without thinking, already rushing over. “Holy shit,” she breathes, heart kicking hard against her ribs as she drops to her knees beside her. “Agatha? Hey, Agatha, can you hear me?” Rio spends the next five seconds in full-blown panic, until a low groan rises from the floor.</p><p>“Why are you yelling…” </p><p>Rio exhales as if she had been holding her breath for a year. “Jesus, I thought you were—” She breaks herself short, staring down at her boss. Her skin is flushed, her hair is a mess, and, dear god, she’s wearing a worn-out Harvard sweatshirt and a pair of baggy sweatpants. </p><p>“You don’t look so good,” Rio says, dumbfounded. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t even lift her head. “No shit.” </p><p>Rio has to blink a few times, because she’s not entirely convinced this is real. The same woman who once shut down an entire shoot because the lighting was “too pedestrian” is now facedown on the floor of her home office. Rio has to snap herself out of it. “What the hell are you doing on the floor?”</p><p>But before she can even move to help, Agatha suddenly pushes herself up, stumbles to the nearest bathroom, and slams the door shut just in time to throw up.</p><p>Rio rushes after her. “Agatha? Are you okay?”</p><p>Another round of vomiting seems to answer Rio’s question. She winces at the sound and hovers uselessly by the door. “Do you want me to call someone?” she adds, flinching again as more retching echoes back, unsure if Agatha can even hear her over the sound of it all, then comes the flush of the toilet a few seconds later.</p><p>“Just leave the book and go.”</p><p>She hears Agatha say something else after that, but doesn’t catch it, because the next round of vomiting is louder, more violent. There’s no way that’s normal, Rio thinks. “Okay, I can’t just leave you like this,” she says, giving the door a soft knock. “Can I come in?”</p><p>“No!” </p><p>Then silence. And after a few seconds, the toilet flushes again.</p><p>“Agatha?” No response. “Agatha?” Rio tries again, already pulling out her phone. “Okay, that’s it. I’m calling Javier. We’ll take you to the hospital right now.” </p><p>“No, you’re not doing that. I’m fine,” Agatha says hoarsely, though her voice is paper-thin and fraying. After a pause, she adds. “Could you just…grab me some blankets? They should be in the linen closet, just off the service corridor by the laundry.”</p><p>Rio nods, already stepping back, then stops. “Right, uh, where exactly is that?”</p><p>“Past the kitchen. First door on the right.” </p><p>Rio sprints down the hall, finds the linen closet, and grabs a couple of blankets before rushing back. </p><p>“I’ve got the blankets. I’m coming in, okay?” She calls out, but when there’s no answer, she pushes the door open anyway, and there’s Agatha, sitting on the floor by the toilet, shivering and almost ghost-pale. </p><p>Without saying a word, Rio kneels beside her and gently drapes the blankets over her shoulders and Agatha pulls them tight around herself. </p><p>“If you don’t want to go to the hospital, can you at least please tell me what’s going on?” Rio asks carefully, trying not to piss off her already sick-looking boss.</p><p>“That godawful restaurant on Thompson Street,” Agatha mutters hoarsely. “Have someone file a complaint and get in touch with my lawyer. I’m pressing charges, or whatever it is people do when they’ve been poisoned.” She leans back against the wall, eyes closed. “God, I don’t know what that man was thinking. Dragging me to that place just because his mistress happened to be at the next table. And for what? Mediocre food and puking my guts out? That man is going to be the death of me.” </p><p>Rio puts the pieces together as she realizes Agatha must be talking about Tony Stark, owner of Stark Publishing. She remembers noting that dinner meeting on Agatha’s calendar a few days ago. </p><p>“I really think you should see a doctor,” she says gently.</p><p>“And I really think you should mind your own business,” Agatha blurts out, then pauses, realizing how harsh that might have sounded. She adds, “I said no. I’m fine.”</p><p>“You’re clearly not fine.” </p><p>“If you’re going to keep insisting that, then just leave.”</p><p>“No. I’m not leaving you like this,” Rio snaps. Okay, maybe not the best way to talk to her boss, so she quickly softens. “You look one vomit away from dehydration, and we don’t even know if this is something worse. If you won’t go to the hospital, at least let me stay and help.”</p><p>Agatha sighs like Rio’s the biggest inconvenience in the world. “Fine. There’s some fluids in my room upstairs. First door on the right. If you’re so hell-bent on playing Florence Nightingale, be my guest.”</p><p>Rio gets up, heads up the stairs, and finds the IV bag sitting neatly on the bed, because of course Agatha has her own personal rehydration kit. Ultra-rich, nepotism-soaked people and their ridiculous perks. She snatches it up and hurries back downstairs. More retching. Then the toilet flushes again. </p><p>Rio taps lightly on the bathroom door. “I’ve got the IV.” Agatha’s still on the floor when she steps in, head resting against the wall, eyes shut. “I’ve got it,” she repeats, holding up the bag.</p><p>“Just give it to me.”</p><p>“I can do it.”</p><p>Agatha cracks one eye open. “Do you even know how?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, my mom was a nurse,” Rio tells her. “I used to watch her do this all the time.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer, but she doesn’t protest either. She sighs, raises her arm. </p><p>“If you mess this up and I die, I’m absolutely firing you.”</p><p>“Whatever you say, Agatha,” Rio quips, carefully setting up the line and hanging the IV on the rack above the toilet. “If my mami were your nurse, she’d probably roll her eyes at you. She never had much patience for mouthy adult patients who acted like kids when they were sick.” She snorts.</p><p>Agatha just watches her for a second, then closes her eyes again and lets her arm rest in Rio’s hands. </p><p>After a few more rounds of throwing up and a bit of back-and-forth bickering, Agatha finally lets Rio help her upstairs.</p><p>She’s still wobbly on her feet, wrapped in a blanket like some grumpy burrito, leaning into her assistant more than she probably realizes. Rio, meanwhile, keeps one hand on the IV bag and the other on Agatha’s back, partly to guide her, and mostly to make sure she doesn’t suddenly faceplant.</p><p>Once they reach the bedroom, Agatha sinks onto the edge of the bed and mumbles, “I need to change.” </p><p>Rio just blinks at her. “Okay,” she says. And then just stands there. </p><p>Agatha slowly lifts her head and gives her a look. </p><p>“I said I’m going to change. Are you seriously thinking about watching your boss strip right now?”</p><p>Rio nearly dies on the spot. Her brain, unhelpfully, flashes an image of Agatha in literally any state of undress, and she immediately wants to sink through the floor. </p><p>“What? No, I wasn’t. God, no!” she stammers, whipping around to face the wall. “I’m just gonna, uh, go check downstairs if there’s any food you can eat,” she blurts, eyes glued to the paint, and practically side-stepping out the door.</p><p>Rio heads downstairs and pokes around the kitchen, figuring soup might help. Something hot and easy to stomach.</p><p>She’s sure Agatha has ingredients lying around to make a proper one. But when she opens the fridge, she immediately scrunches her nose. It’s packed with microwave meals. Rows and rows of them, neatly stacked and organized by flavor and brand. </p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding me. Is this seriously how rich people eat?” she mutters to herself, grabbing a chicken noodle soup, pouring it into a bowl, and popping it into the microwave. </p><p>As it heats, she remembers Jen once telling her never to open Agatha’s fridge under any circumstance. Rio snorts. She hadn’t even expected to be the one microwaving soup for her tonight, but here she is, doing exactly that.</p><p>When Rio heads back upstairs, she finds Agatha in a fresh set of silk pajamas. </p><p>“I would’ve made something more decent, but this is literally all you have downstairs,” she says, setting the tray of soup and water on the bedside table. “Do you ever keep real food in your fridge?” </p><p>Agatha just shrugs and mumbles something about barely being home and not seeing the point of groceries. She doesn’t even protest when Rio insists she eat. She just picks up the spoon and slowly brings it to her mouth like she doesn’t have the energy to be her usual terrifying self.</p><p>Once Rio’s sure Agatha’s eaten enough, she heads back downstairs. She drops the used bowl in the sink, shrugs off her blazer and tosses it over a chair, then ties her hair up, now just in a tank top and jeans. She ends up tidying a bit: tossing the trail of tissues, rinsing the empty mug and bowl, and folding the random blanket left on the floor. </p><p>Once the mess is mostly dealt with, she heads back upstairs.</p><p>She finds Agatha fast asleep, curled up on her side with the blanket pulled tight around her. The soft golden light from the nightstand spills across her face, making her look calm, almost delicate, but there’s still a faint paleness in her skin that makes her look cold. </p><p>Rio stands there for a second, unsure what to do, then quietly grabs another blanket draped over the chair and lays it gently over her, careful not to disturb her sleep.</p><p>Rio props herself on the little loveseat by the door, pulling her knees up and hugging a throw pillow to her chest. For a minute, she just watches Agatha. Head tilted, chin resting on the armrest. </p><p>From this angle, it almost feels like they’re lying in the same bed.</p><p>Agatha looks so peaceful. Not like the boss-from-hell who stomps through the office and scares grown adults into crying. Not the woman who can ruin a career with just one look. Agatha looks totally harmless, softer, and almost unreal, if Rio’s being honest. </p><p>What kind of cosmic glitch landed her here, sitting and watching her terrifying boss sleep like some love-sick weirdo? Rio immediately straightens up the moment she realizes where her thoughts are headed. No. Absolutely not. She’s not going down that rabbit hole.</p><p>Rio looks up at the clock and sees it’s already close to midnight. She should probably go home, get some rest, and try to reset for tomorrow. But something in her gut won’t let her leave, not when Agatha’s up here alone and sick. It simply doesn’t seem right.</p><p>Instead, she lets her eyes wander around the room. It’s the first time she’s really taken a good look at it. It’s bigger than it seemed earlier. Very Agatha. </p><p>The curtains are long and lavender, the sheets look pristine and probably cost a fortune. There are a few black-and-white photos on the wall, most of which are of buildings and city shots. No people in any of them. Even her room feels kind of cold and fancy, just like Agatha. Still, Rio doesn’t hate it.</p><p>She gets up quietly and walks over to the shelf under the TV, picking out one of the books lined up there. She flips through it without really reading, just trying to stay awake. She yawns. Her eyes are starting to feel heavy. Then she yawns again. And before she even realizes it, her head leans back against the pillow, and the last thing she sees is Agatha, half-covered in a blanket, fast asleep.</p><hr/><p>Rio wakes up with a stiff neck and a dull ache in her back. Her cheek is stuck to the cushion, and when she pulls away, there’s a suspiciously damp patch. </p><p>Oh god. Had she been drooling? </p><p>She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, mortified, and slowly sits up. There’s a blanket draped over her shoulders, definitely not something she remembers grabbing before falling asleep.</p><p>The thought alone of who might have put the blanket over her makes her ears warm. She blinks a few times, letting her eyes adjust before looking at the clock over Agatha’s bed, which is now empty. </p><p>Rio stands and stretches, her body stiff from even that short hour of sleep, then pads quietly out of the room. The house is silent until she reaches the bottom of the stairs, where light spills out from the kitchen and she hears the faint sound of typing.</p><p>She finds Agatha perched on a tall stool at the kitchen island, still in her silk pajamas. She is wearing a pair of thin reading glasses, hair pushed back, and is typing calmly on her laptop like it’s just another Tuesday afternoon, and not, in fact, the middle of the night.</p><p>Without even lifting her head from the screen, Agatha says, “And here I thought I was the one who’s sick.”</p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t mean to fall asleep.” Rio scratches the back of her neck as she regards the woman in front of her. Just a few hours ago, she was hugging the toilet and looking half a breath from death. </p><p>Now she’s back to work like nothing happened. </p><p>Does this woman ever rest? Rio wonders.</p><p>“Anyway, you seem fine now. I should get going.” And then, betrayal in its purest form, her stomach growls loud enough to rattle the walls. The silence in the house also does nothing to save her dignity. </p><p>Rio winces, suddenly remembering she hasn’t eaten a thing since she left the office.</p><p>“Someone’s hungry.”</p><p>Rio feels her ears burn. “I’m fine. I-I’ll just eat at home.”</p><p>“And when’s that going to be? After almost an hour’s drive?” Agatha says. And Rio tries not to dwell on the fact that Agatha might’ve somehow found a way to learn where she lives. “Stay. I already ordered some food,” she adds, shutting her laptop with a soft click. “Real food,” she reiterates, giving Rio a pointed look as if she clearly remembers what she said earlier. </p><p>Rio frowns. “At this hour?”</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms and rolls her eyes. </p><p>“Oh, please, darling. I’ve made way more impossible things happen before breakfast.”</p><p>Not five minutes later, the doorbell rings, and Rio blinks like she’s in a fever dream as a delivery guy in a sleek black uniform hands her a paper bag that smells like heaven. Inside: steak, truffle mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, and a tiny chocolate cake that looks too pretty to eat.</p><p>Rio stares at the spread as she slides onto a stool. “Which Michelin chef did you blackmail for this?” she asks, still in awe. Agatha simply arches her brow like she’s above answering, and the two of them begin to eat in complete silence across from each other. </p><p>Every so often, Rio sneaks glances across the island. </p><p>Almost without meaning to, she catches the way Agatha’s brows pinch slightly as she scrolls through something on her phone, the way she absentmindedly pushes her glasses up her nose. She’s still a little pale, clearly not fully recovered, and her hair’s a bit of a mess, but somehow, she still looks effortlessly put-together in a way that Rio will never understand.</p><p>Again, the question from earlier drifts back in: what kind of cosmic glitch landed her here?</p><p>“If you’re planning to keep your eyes glued on me the entire time, the least you can do is turn it into a conversation,” Agatha says, still not looking up. “So whatever it is you’ve been dying to ask, just ask. I’m in a very generous mood.”</p><p>“What makes you think I have a question?” Rio coughs on a bite of cake.</p><p>Agatha finally looks up, and for a second, Rio forgets what planet she’s on. Her eyes, God, those eyes, are like the ocean right before a storm. Dark, cold, and impossible to reach. And yet, some part of her still wants to dive in. Like if she just swims far enough, she might definitely find something worth drowning for.</p><p>“Am I wrong?” Agatha asks, like she already knows she’s not.</p><p>Rio shakes her head and sets her fork down. </p><p>“It’s just...I still don’t really get why you didn’t fire me when you had the chance. You caught me lying, like, straight to your face, and any other boss would've fired me without thinking twice. But you didn’t. You still let me keep the job. And even before that, I’ve always kind of wondered why you hired me at all. I’m nothing like the other girls at that company. I didn’t even know who you were when I applied, but you still gave me the job.”</p><p>Rio catches herself, hearing how that must have sounded, so she adds, “Not that I’m ungrateful, because I am. I am grateful. I mean, at the time it was either Nocturne or Drive Monthly, so believe me, I know I got lucky. I’m just...curious, that’s all.”</p><p>Agatha studies her for a moment, then slips off her glasses and sets them neatly beside her plate.</p><p>“You’re right,” she says. “I always hire the same type of girl. Polished, put-together, breathes and bleeds the magazine, practically have themselves foaming at the mouth to please me. Normally, I would’ve ended the interview the moment you admitted you didn’t know who I was. You didn’t know fashion, and clearly, that hasn’t changed, though I did hope you’d have made some sort of effort by now.” Her eyes drift briefly to what Rio’s wearing, and Rio suddenly becomes very aware of her tank top and jeans.</p><p>“Anyway,” Agatha continues, “I do hire the same kind of girl. And they always end up disappointing me. But then you walked into my office with your impressive resume and that little speech about your so-called work ethic, and I thought, what the hell, maybe I’ll take a calculated risk. And for a while, you didn’t disappoint. Not until that moment.” She pauses, and Pride comes rushing back to Rio.</p><p>“But even then, I told myself: I’m not going to fire someone just for having the guts to do what I’ve never been able to.” She pauses, and Rio doesn’t know what to say to that. “I wasn’t even supposed to be at that parade. But the woman I was seeing at the time. Let’s just say she manipulated my schedule, and made sure I ended up there. And I was livid, not at her, not really. I was more angry at myself. Because standing in that crowd, all I could think was, why can’t I be like everyone else? Why can’t I be out there, unapologetic, proud, free?” She then lets out a breath. “So no, I didn’t fire you. Maybe it’s not the most professional call I’ve ever made, but hell, call it gay solidarity or whatever. That’s the real reason. Whether I liked it or not, you reminded me of a version of myself I’ve never quite had the courage to be.” </p><p>Rio is suddenly speechless, still taking in everything Agatha just said. It’s strange, hearing someone who seems so in control, so powerful, so untouchable, speak like that. As if she wasn’t made of steel after all. And before Rio can stop herself, it leaves her mouth before she can catch it.</p><p>“Then why haven’t you come out yet? Like…really come out?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer right away. Her fingers tap lightly against the edge of her plate. </p><p>“Because it’s not that simple,” she says. “Weren’t you there during that conversation with my mother?” She pauses again, then looks back at Rio. “I built this career from the ground up. Every inch of it. I clawed my way into rooms no one wanted me in, earned respect from people who would have laughed me out of the building if they knew everything about me. I’ve worked too hard to have what I have now reduced to a headline. My job is all I’ve really had. I can’t risk it, not for something that will always be true anyway. I’ll always be gay, even if I never say it out loud on some front page. And maybe it’s not ideal, but I’ve made peace with living in the in-between.”</p><p>“But isn’t living in the in-between kind of lonely?” Rio asks.</p><p>“Some days more than others." She reaches for her glass of water, takes a sip, and sets it back down. “But it’s the kind of loneliness you eventually get used to.”</p><p>Sensing the conversation might’ve drifted somewhere a little too personal, Rio clears her throat and tries to steer them back to safer ground. </p><p>“So, let me get this straight: you hired me because I’m smart. And didn’t fire me because you found out I’m gay,” she says, piecing it together out loud. “Cool. I think I’ll have that engraved on my tombstone some day.” She lets out a chuckle, and it actually earns the tiniest twitch of Agatha’s lips. </p><p>“Well,” Agatha says suddenly, “I do like smart gay girls.”</p><p>And Rio’s chuckle falters just slightly as she looks at Agatha, who seems to realize at the same moment what just came out of her mouth. She clears her throat and immediately straightens in her seat. </p><p>“Right. Anyway, I think I’ve paid my dues for the night. Have Javier come pick you up and take you home,” she says, already standing. "And don’t worry about the mess, I’ve got someone coming tomorrow.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio mirrors, grabbing her blazer and slipping it back on. “I should go.”</p><p>“Yes. And I should get back to bed,” Agatha says, already moving out of the kitchen. </p><p>Rio follows her into the hall.</p><p>At the stairs, Agatha pauses and looks over her shoulder. </p><p>“You can see yourself out?”</p><p>“Of course. I’ll just lock the door when I leave.”</p><p>Agatha nods and turns to head upstairs, but before Rio can even touch the doorknob, her voice floats back down. “And, Rio?”</p><p>Rio turns. “Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha hesitates for a beat. She opens her mouth like she might say something else, but instead, she settles on, “Don’t be late. Just because you played nurse all night doesn’t mean you get a pass.”</p><p>Rio offers a small, sheepish smile, hands tucked into her pockets. </p><p>“Right. Sleep well, Agatha. Or what’s left of the night, anyway.”</p><p>Agatha just gives her a look, but there’s something a bit soft buried in it. For a moment, it seems like she might say something, but then she changes her mind, says nothing, and disappears up the stairs.</p><hr/><p>Hours later, Rio finds herself in the dreaded weekly editorial conference. It’s the all-hands meeting where every editor, section head, creative lead, and senior contributor squeezes into the glass conference room to finalize the end-of-month Pride issue. </p><p>It’s the magazine’s first time releasing one, and Rio, running on barely four hours of sleep and a large coffee, is doing everything she can to stay awake.</p><p>She hides each yawn behind her notepad, but at one point, Jen would lean over, and would subtly pinch her arm, and shoot her a look. If only Jen knew why Rio was up so late, she’d be gagged. Hell, she could barely believe it herself.</p><p>At the far end of the table, Agatha is in full business mode. A far cry from the woman curled up on the bathroom floor last night. This version of her is sharp, composed, and articulate as she addresses the room, while Rio and Jen sit off to the side, silently taking notes.</p><p>Most of what’s being said goes in one ear and out the other for Rio, but she catches snippets. Something about an out-and-proud lesbian actress requesting her cover story drop the same week as her film release. Agatha, unimpressed, shoots that down with a curt, “We’re not rearranging our editorial calendar around some actress’ press tour.”</p><p>Then she taps on a layout spread. “The Pride fashion feature looks like a department store flyer. And worse, like it was designed by someone still halfway in the closet. It needs edge. Energy. Make it bolder. Louder. Make it unapologetic.”</p><p>Then she flips through the next set of proofs and frowns. “We’re pulling the nightlife feature. It’s falling flat, no depth or angle worth keeping. I want something that actually says something about queer spaces right now, not a roundup of where to get overpriced cocktails. Also, lose the dating app essay. It’s tired. We've read that story a hundred times, and this version doesn’t even add a single new thought to the discourse.” </p><p>She flips to one last page and exhales sharply. “This <b> <em>History of Pride</em> </b> column. What is this? It reads like someone copy-pasted from a goddamn Wikipedia page. It’s dry, too careful, too clinical, and completely devoid of voice.” She tosses the proof back on the table with a groan. “Did anyone actually show up to work today? Because everything I’ve read so far is underwhelming at best.” </p><p>The room falls silent.</p><p>“Miss Vidal,” Agatha says, formally. And just like that, every eye swings to Rio. Good thing she isn’t mid-yawn. “I saw you read the History of Pride piece earlier this week. What do you think it’s missing?”</p><p>Rio looks up like she’s just been called on in class without raising her hand. </p><p>“Me?” she croaks.</p><p>Agatha blinks once. “Yes. You.”</p><p>Rio had read the piece. Thought it was dull by the end of the first paragraph. But she’s still an assistant, barely six weeks into the job, and it’s not exactly her place to say anything about it. </p><p>Still, she clears her throat. “Um…I personally think it’s trying too hard to be polite. It wants to include everything, but, unfortunately, it ends up saying nothing. It lists events, but there’s actually no story here. Just dates and names. Basically, a summary. But Pride isn’t a summary. It’s people. It’s supposed to make you feel things. And you don’t feel anything in this.”</p><p>Agatha keeps her eyes on her. “So, what would you suggest?” </p><p>Rio hesitates for half a second, then speaks. “Maybe it needs to start with a person. A real moment. Something that pulls you in. Like…imagine opening with a teenager at their first Pride parade. They’ve spent their whole life thinking they had to hide, and now they’re standing in the middle of a crowd that’s loud and joyful and unapologetically themselves. Maybe they hear people cheering, and for the first time, they realize the cheering includes them. That they belong in it. That they’re not alone.” She pauses, then adds, “That’s what Pride is. Not just history. It’s a memory. People just don’t remember timelines. If you want the reader to care, you have to make them feel something first. A heartbeat.”</p><p>The room falls into a quiet pause. Jen looks halfway to gaping, and a couple of senior editors glance at each other and lower their pens. Across the table, Agatha just stares at Rio for a long, unreadable beat. Then she gives a small, simple nod.</p><p>“Have someone redo the piece,” she says, turning to the editor beside her. “Use that note. Start with a heartbeat. I want that tone in the rewrite.” And just like that, she flips to the next page and keeps going. </p><p>The butterflies in Rio’s stomach don’t ease up, even hours later. She’s just settling back at her desk after a quick errand downstairs when a cup of coffee suddenly lands in front of her. She looks up, just in time to catch the unmistakable back of her boss, already walking into her office without a word.</p><p>Rio quite literally forgets how to breathe. She stares at the cup for a long second, only snapping out of it when Jen gives her a confused squint from across the desk. Rio can practically hear what she’s thinking, so she shrugs and tells her, “Maybe it’s because of what I said earlier.”</p><p>But deep down, a sneaky part of her wonders if this cup of coffee has less to do with her input, and more to do with the fact that Agatha’s the reason she’s running on fumes, and she might’ve seen Rio yawning halfway through the meeting.</p><hr/><p>Everyone had gone home. The majority of the building is now dark, except for a few low strips of light still glowing along the floor, the soft hum from Rio’s desk lamp, and the warm spill of light from Agatha’s office. It’s just the two of them left on the entire floor again. Rio, waiting for the book, and Agatha, probably still finalizing the last pieces to go in it.</p><p>Rio is halfway through going over Agatha’s schedule for the week, cross-checking meetings and interviews with her color-coded sticky notes, when she hears her name.</p><p>“Rio?” </p><p>Rio gets up and makes her way to Agatha’s office. “Come in for a second,” the other woman says, not looking up right away. She’s standing at her long worktable, sleeves casually rolled to her elbows, surrounded by a sea of printed photos, page layouts, and headline drafts. Her glasses are slipping a little down her nose, and she’s holding a red pen like she’s been deep in editing mode for hours.</p><p>“I need to finalize the replacements for the pieces we cut this morning,” Agatha adds, her eyes still on the scattered pages. “I’ve narrowed it down to six. I want you to help me decide which ones go in.”</p><p>Rio hesitates, still a little surprised every time Agatha asks for her opinion on anything. But she steps closer to the desk, eyes scanning the pages spread out. There’s a long-form draft on Gen Z drag artists thriving in conservative towns. A raw photo series of queer-owned barbershops in the South. An interview with a newly out athlete who just signed a major pro deal. But Agatha gestures to a few printouts. </p><p>“There’s a photo essay on underground ballroom culture. Great and strong visuals, but not much context,” Agatha says, tapping one page. “And this one on queer-owned vintage shops in Brooklyn. It has potential, but the angle’s a bit weak. What do you think?”</p><p>Rio reads through the first paragraph. “What if it focused more on sustainability? Not just queer-owned, but also fashion-forward and ethical. It would fit better with the Pride issue’s bigger message.” Agatha looks at her so Rio continues. “Right now it feels like a listicle, but if the angle is more about identity and conscious fashion, it could feel like a real movement. Not just a shopping guide.”</p><p>Agatha makes a thoughtful sound, her eyes returning to the spread as if reevaluating it through Rio’s suggestion. “Okay. If we tighten the intro and cut some of the fluff, it might actually ground the culture section better than what we had before,” she says, then adds, almost offhand, “Hmm. That could work.”</p><p>And Rio nods like that didn’t just set off a small firework in her chest.</p><p>“Your professors must’ve either adored you or wanted to strangle you.”</p><p>Rio chuckles. “Most of them actually liked me. I toe the line just enough to be endearing.”</p><p>They stand there a little longer, going over the other options side by side. Rio leans in to point at something on the page, and Agatha moves closer to get a better look. Suddenly, they’re almost shoulder to shoulder, heads tilted toward the same spot. That’s when Rio catches the soft scent of Agatha’s lavender perfume. She looks up without meaning to, only to realize Agatha’s already looking at her. </p><p>And for one dizzy second, Rio’s pretty sure she sees her blue eyes drop down to her lips.</p><p>Rio tells herself not to read into it. Not to freeze. Not to stare. But something in her doesn’t listen. Because all she can think about now is how close they are. How Agatha’s lips look even softer up close, just barely parted, like she’s about to speak or forgot how to. And somehow, in the middle of all that thinking: Rio realizes, really realizes, how badly she wants to know what it feels like to kiss her. What it would be like to make someone like Agatha lose control, even just once. </p><p>And before she can stop herself, she leans in just enough to cross that thin line between looking and wanting. Her breath catches. She doesn’t even know what she’s doing anymore. It’s like something else is taking over. And to her surprise, Agatha doesn’t even move away.</p><p>And then…</p><p>A knock at the open door.</p><p>Both of them flinch at the same time, like teenagers caught doing something they shouldn’t. Rio straightens up so fast she almost knocks the papers off the desk, while Agatha clears her throat and turns away, her expression snapping back into something more neutral and composed, but also a bit pissed off. </p><p>Rio recognizes the face as one of the new junior editors. He’s poking his head through the glass door like he’s not entirely sure he should be doing this. </p><p>“Hey, sorry to interrupt,” he says, and Rio can already tell that he’s probably never spoken to Agatha before. Maybe someone from layout dared him to be the messenger. “Just wanted to give you a heads-up. The book might be a little delayed tonight. One of the printers downstairs is acting up. We’ve already called maintenance, but—” </p><p>Agatha doesn’t even look up from the spread. </p><p>“And what exactly do you expect me to do with that information?”</p><p>Rio watches him instantly freeze in the doorway.</p><p>“I—I just thought you should know.”</p><p>Rio hears Agatha let out a dry, humorless laugh. The kind that doesn’t mean she’s amused at all. She shakes her head slowly like she’s trying to hold onto her patience by a thread. </p><p>“Why?” she says, finally looking up at him. “Did you honestly think I’d be thrilled to hear that? Or were you hoping I’d roll up my sleeves and fix the printer myself?” </p><p>The whole room goes still, and Rio watches the poor junior editor shrink two inches on the spot. He opens his mouth, then clearly thinks better of whatever he was going to say.</p><p>“What’s your name?” Agatha asks. </p><p>“Um. Dylan.”</p><p>Poor Dylan, Rio thinks, wincing a little on his behalf.</p><p>“Well, Dylan,” Agatha says, drawing out his name like it leaves a bad taste in her mouth. “Let me make something very clear. If you’re going to knock on my door, don’t walk in here just to hand me a problem, unless it’s a problem that’s already been fixed. Otherwise, don’t come in at all. Am I making myself clear?”</p><p>Dylan nods quickly. “Yes, absolutely. Sorry. I’ll, uh, I’ll just go now,” he stammers, turning on his heel so fast and practically speed-walking. Rio’s sure she hears a tiny whimper as he disappears down the hall. </p><p>Agatha exhales through her nose, pinching the bridge of it. “Why is basic competence so rare?” she grunts, more to herself than to Rio, before walking over to her other desk and sinking into her chair. </p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything. She just stands there, still stuck on what almost happened before someone walked in and cut it short. Her mind keeps replaying it, trying to make sense of what just happened. She swears she didn’t imagine it. Agatha didn’t pull away. She didn’t even stop her. She was leaning in too. Right? Or is Rio just sleep-deprived and starting to lose her mind?</p><p>Before the silence can stretch too long and turn weird, Agatha clears her throat. </p><p>“I’ll take the book with me tonight. You don’t have to wait around for it.”</p><p>“Are you sure? I really don’t mind waiting—”</p><p>“You’ve done enough,” Agatha says, her tone a little too close to the one she used on Dylan just seconds ago. And even though Rio tells herself not to take it personally, it still stings. “You’ve had a long day,” Agatha adds. “Just go home. Get some rest.”</p><p>Rio hesitates, still feeling something humming under her skin from that almost-moment. But she lets it go. “Alright,” she says carefully. “Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t even look up. Doesn’t say anything back. Just stays hunched over her desk, flipping a page like nothing happened at all.</p><hr/><p>“What if I just quit?” Rio calls out from the bathroom, a toothbrush hanging from her mouth.</p><p>Alice, somewhere in the kitchen probably making her usual peanut butter and jelly sandwich, yells back, “Honestly? I’d say it’s about damn time.” Then there’s the unmistakable clink of a butter knife against a jar. “But didn’t you say there’s been some progress with you, like, finally speaking up at meetings and having opinions and whatever?” </p><p>Rio spits, wipes her mouth on a towel, then pads barefoot into the dining room in an old NYU hoodie and a pair of boxers that definitely shouldn’t count as pants. “Yeah, I was. I mean, I am. But I don’t know. I don’t think I like it there anymore. Lately, it’s been hard to focus. Too many distractions.”</p><p>Alice pokes her head out from the kitchen, peanut butter knife in hand. “Distractions?” she repeats, suddenly very interested. “What kind of distractions?” Rio says nothing as Alice narrows her eyes, then her jaw drops. “Holy shit. You slept with your boss. You slept with her, didn’t you?” </p><p>Rio’s mouth falls open. “Jesus, no! I didn’t sleep with anyone!”</p><p>“Is that why you came home so late the other night?”</p><p>“No!” Rio groans and covers her face. “No, Alice. I didn’t sleep with my fucking boss!”</p><p>Alice hurriedly walks into the dining room and drops onto the chair across from her. </p><p>“But you want to. You’ve been thinking about it.”</p><p>Rio doesn't answer.</p><p>“Oh my god. You want to get into her designer pants. I knew it! You’ve had that look on your face for days every time her name comes up. You want to climb that terrifying woman like she’s a jungle gym.”</p><p>Rio glares at her. “Alice, do you even hear yourself right now?”</p><p>Alice just grins. </p><p>“Look, I get it. I mean, I was a little worried natural brunettes might not be her type, but you’ve got a thing. Kinda weird, kinda intense. Most girls dig that. And you’re hot. Very hot. And charming. And smart. She’d be out of her mind not to want you. And you’d be even hotter if you went blonde again, by the way.”</p><p>Rio hides her face again, but the pink creeping into her cheeks gives her away. </p><p>“Alice, can you not?” she grumbles. “And you’re right. I’m not her type.”</p><p>“But you like her.” Alice smirks. “Admit it. You’ve always had a thing for older women.”</p><p>“That’s not true.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? What about the adjunct professor from junior year with the motorcycle? The 40-year-old tattoo artist who drove a hearse? And that divorcee from Brooklyn who made you vegan brownies and cried so hard when her cat died?” </p><p>“Okay, okay, stop. Fine. Maybe I like her. A little. But that doesn’t mean I’m going to sleep with her. There is no sleeping. There is no sex. Zero. None. Absolutely no boss-fucking.”</p><p>“Who’s not fucking their boss?” Billy announces as he walks through the open door </p><p>“Jesus, kid. Ever heard of knocking?” Rio groans.</p><p>“Sorry. But your door’s open,” he shrugs, then steps back out just to knock on it. Rio flips him off as he strolls to the table and flops into the chair beside Alice. “So. You’re not doing your hot boss from Pride?”</p><p>“I swear to God, I’m gonna strangle both of you,” Rio hisses. “And no, I’m not <em> doing </em>my boss. And stop calling her hot. And can you not insert yourself into grown-up conversations?”</p><p>“I’m seventeen. I’m legally allowed to have opinions on sex,” Billy argues.</p><p>“And apparently, none on volume control,” Rio retorts.</p><p>Billy lunges forward and grabs the sandwich Alice hands him.</p><p>“So, if you’re not sleeping with her, maybe it’s because you don’t exactly look like someone she’d want to sleep with. No offense. You’re definitely hot. Even my lesbian friends say so.” He takes a bite, completely unbothered, and Rio instantly regrets showing up to one of his school plays last month. “Hot in a scary, slightly threatening sense. But if you want her to see you differently, you’ve got to look the part.”</p><p>“I don’t want her to want me, okay?” Rio says through gritted teeth. “I don’t even have the part.” </p><p>“I think you do,” Billy insists, dead serious. How old is this kid again? “And I can help. Alice and I can help. You’ve got the raw materials. Cheekbones, bone structure, and all that. But you dress like you’re Shane’s mechanic in that lesbian show my mom won’t shut up about. Clothes matter, okay? Trust me.”</p><p>“The kid has a point.” Alice sips her juice. “About the wardrobe, I mean. No offense. You know I love you.” </p><p>“And I fucking hate you right now,” Rio says, squinting at her. Then she turns to Billy. “And don’t you have better things to do? Like wash your mom’s car, text that guy you keep pretending you’re not into, or livestream yourself ranking every Taylor Swift bridge in chronological order?”</p><p>“Did all three earlier,” Billy shrugs. “I’m free now. So if you want, we can go out, check a few places. Just see what we can find. Give your closet a little…glow-up or something.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shoot up. </p><p>“Absolutely not. There is no way I’m letting a seventeen-year-old play dress-up with me. I’d rather chew glass. I will rip out my own eyebrows with pliers before I let either of you give me a makeover.”</p><p>But a few hours later, Rio walks out of the salon with fresh layers and curtain bangs she never asked for, but secretly kind of loves. She’s got three thrift store bags hanging from each hand, while Alice and Billy trail behind her, grinning, arms full of their own haul.</p><hr/><p>Weirdly enough, Billy and Alice forcing a makeover down Rio’s throat the day before turns out to be freakishly well-timed. Agatha, apparently still in Miami but will be flying back shortly, had called Jen to say that Rio will be tagging along to the annual benefit tonight, helping Jen make sure every guest on the list would think Agatha knows exactly who they are.</p><p>Billy, of course, had treated it like he’d been training his whole life for this, practically shoving Rio into a midnight blue suit, tailored fit and a plunging neckline, like some dangerously hot, gender-bent version of Cinderella on her one shot at the ball.</p><p>Billy had said she looked great. Alice had said she’d turn heads. And that’s what Rio keeps repeating to herself as she steps out of the car and walks toward the venue. Jen’s already by the bar, champagne flute in hand, clearly waiting for their boss. She gives Rio a once-over and lifts her glass, “You clean up alright.”</p><p>They stay like that for a while, keeping their drinks slow, just sober enough not to lose their jobs, while watching the crowd swell with stylists, models, writers, sponsors, execs, and even interns. </p><p>The lights get warmer, the music louder, and half an hour goes by. Then, like a flip of a switch, heads suddenly turn toward the entrance, and a swarm of photographers rushes toward the doors in a whirl of shutters and shouts of “Miss Harkness! This way, Miss Harkness!”</p><p>Agatha walks in wearing a black satin gown, her hair falling in soft waves, lips painted a sharp, perfect red. She smiles for the cameras, greets a few guests, and takes photos with some. </p><p>All eyes are on Agatha, but hers ultimately settle on just one. Blue meets brown, and for a second, she slips. As if she forgets to hide it. The surprise. The softness. That stunned little breath she takes, like she wasn’t prepared to see Rio like this.</p><p>The night drags on with Jen and Rio trailing closely behind Agatha.</p><p>Jen spends most of it leaning in to whisper names into Agatha’s ear just in time for each handshake, saving their boss from blank stares and awkward greetings. </p><p>Here and there, Rio helps out too, usually when Jen’s caught up somewhere else. But every time she gets close enough to whisper, she catches that now-familiar scent of lavender clinging to Agatha’s skin, and it takes everything in Rio not to stupidly lose her composure right there.</p><p>The benefit wraps up right at midnight, and to Rio’s surprise, it ends with Agatha leaning in close, her breath warm against her ear as she whispers words Rio didn’t expect.</p><p>“If you were trying to make an impression, then consider me...thoroughly impressed.”</p><p>And it requires every bit of strength Rio has not to think about it for the rest of the night.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The day after the benefit, and Rio finds herself an absolute mess. </p><p>She’s been stuck in fashion hell for the last fifteen minutes, trying on half the stuff Billy and Alice gleefully stuffed into her closet over the weekend, and none of it makes any sense. She can’t tell which shirt goes with which pants, or why there are suddenly so many damn buttons, or why every top makes her look like she’s about to lead a prayer circle. And she doesn’t even go to church.</p><p>To make things worse, her so-called fairy godmothers are both missing in action.</p><p>Billy’s off at a friend’s house doing God knows what, and Alice hasn’t even come home. She’d texted last night saying she’d found “the cutest redhead at this gig” and had zero plans of returning before lunch.</p><p>Which leaves Rio completely alone and wildly unqualified to decide what to wear to work today.</p><p>She groans as she holds up yet another pair of pants that make her look like a substitute art teacher on sabbatical. Maybe she should just throw on jeans, her usual band tee, and slap a blazer over it, same as any other day. But then she imagines the look Agatha would give her, and tosses the pants into the growing mountain on her bed.</p><p>Rio, without question, is a lost cause when it comes to fashion. But Agatha had actually complimented her last night — “thoroughly impressed,” she said. Thoroughly. And for some completely stupid, godforsaken reason, Rio is now on a mission to not completely ruin the streak.</p><p>She throws on another outfit. This time, a pencil skirt, a tucked-in button-down, and a pair of modest heels. Suddenly, she looks a lot like Jen and all the other perfectly polished women on their floor who somehow never spill coffee on themselves or forget their lunch in the fridge. It’s a little terrifying.</p><p>Still, she thinks Agatha might actually like this. Or at least not roll her eyes at it.</p><p>“This’ll do, I guess,” she mumbles to herself before turning to check her own ass in the mirror. </p><p>Anyone would want to look at this ass, she thinks, then gets a little freaked out that she’s basically wearing this just so people will start staring at her butt. </p><p>Well, she does want people to look. If ‘people’ pertains to a 38-year-old editor-in-chief of a top fashion magazine, living on the Upper East Side of New York.</p><p>But then the real horror sets in. Not the heels. Not even the skirt, which, to be honest, should have been the scariest part, considering Rio never liked wearing them in the first place. And not even the weird, corporate Barbie metamorphosis staring back at her in the mirror. </p><p>No. </p><p>It’s the deeply uncomfortable, unsettling truth that Agatha Harkness’s opinion suddenly matters to her. Way more than it should.</p><p>The unsettling truth then gets smacked into full confirmation the second Agatha walks past her desk, slows just enough to give her a look, says absolutely nothing, and disappears into her office. </p><p>Rio stares at the door, suddenly questioning her entire outfit choice. Did Agatha hate it? Because if that look meant what she thinks it did, then she may have just squeezed herself into a skirt, wobbled around in heels, and sacrificed her feet to the gods of Blistertown for absolutely nothing.</p><p>“Great. All this pain and not even a <em> single </em> hello,” Rio grumbles, earning a confused, scrutinizing look from Jen across the room, completely clueless about her coworker’s inner turmoil.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Agatha asks as Rio sets the coffee on her desk hours later. “What is this?”</p><p>“Your extra-hot triple-shot oat milk flat white?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t even look at the cup. Her eyes are already sweeping over Rio from head to toe.</p><p>“Not my coffee. You. This. Whatever this is,” she replies, gesturing vaguely at Rio as if she’s been itching to ask all morning. “Did you finally retire the walking billboard look for every obscure New York punk band you’re obsessed with?”</p><p>Rio looks down at her mid-thigh skirt, suddenly feeling about twelve.</p><p>“I thought you said I should start looking like I take the job seriously.”</p><p>Agatha regards her, then brings the cup to her lips, eyes locked on Rio the whole time.</p><p>“So, am I supposed to assume this whole ensemble is for my benefit?”</p><p>Rio’s throat goes dry, and her face suddenly feels way too warm. </p><p>“What? No, no, it’s not like that! I just didn’t want to give you another reason to fire me or anything. This has nothing to do with you.” She wants to disappear, anywhere but here, at how much she’s stumbling over her words. Lately, she’s been turning into a headless chicken every time this woman is around.</p><p>“I see.” Agatha gives her another long look. “Well, if you’re going to keep playing dress-up, at least make sure you don’t look like you looted someone else’s closet. It’s a bit…distracting.” She lets the words settle, then adds, almost offhand, “You’re actually more tolerable when you just look like yourself.” A beat. Then a flick of her hand, her signature move when dismissing her employees. “Off you go.”</p><p>Rio nods slowly, cheeks noticeably warmer as she tries to shove down the ridiculous thought that maybe, just maybe, Agatha actually likes her the way she is. Or maybe that’s just her delusions talking.</p><p>She reaches the door, then pauses and turns back. “I'm not actually obsessed with them.” </p><p>“What?” </p><p>“Most of the bands on my shirts. You assumed I’m obsessed with them. Well, I’m not. I don’t actually listen to them that much. I just really like the shirts. They look cool. The graphics, mostly. I’m actually more into boygenius, Snail Mail, Fourth Wanderers…you know, indie rock, kind of folky stuff.”</p><p>Agatha leans back in her chair, eyeing Rio like she’s not quite sure what to do with that information.</p><p>“I have no idea who any of those are,” she says, and Rio can’t tell if she’s being serious.</p><p>“Seriously? Not even boygenius? Phoebe Bridgers? Lucy Dacus? Julien Baker?” Rio blinks. “They’re, like, everywhere now. You’re kidding, right?”</p><p>“Do I look like I’m kidding?” Agatha replies bluntly. When Rio doesn’t answer, she calmly looks back down at the proofs on her desk. “Now, if you’re done sharing your niche music preferences, I suggest you get back to work. Some of us have an actual magazine to run.”</p><p>Rio clears her throat, the change in Agatha's tone biting harder than she anticipated. It’s as if last night never happened. As if she hadn’t whispered in Rio’s ear or looked at her the way she did. </p><p>“Right. Of course. Just let me know if you need anything. I’ll be at my desk.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer, doesn’t even look up. So Rio walks out, trying (and failing) not to let it get under her skin. That ended up being the only conversation they had all day. Everything else had come through email, with Jen acting as the go-between for every instruction.</p><p>Days blur into weeks, and everything just falls back into the same old routine. </p><p>Coffee runs, dry cleaning, delivering the book, picking up proofs, sitting through meetings, jotting down notes. No one asks for her opinion anymore. No surprise invitations to Agatha’s office to look through articles like before. No more offhand remarks or lingering stares. It’s as if a switch has flipped yet again, and Agatha has rebuilt the wall between them. Like it was never down to begin with.</p><p>“She’s back,” Rio announces as Alice and Billy walk into the apartment, arms full of paper bags rustling with chips, canned beer, and a couple of sodas.</p><p>It’s <em> The One Where We Drink </em> Night: a sacred tradition where she and Alice park themselves on the couch, quote their favorite Friends episodes, and drink until probably past midnight.</p><p>Tonight, though, Billy’s crashing the party. His mom’s working late, which apparently earns him chips and soda — because Alice still refuses to let him near beer, but if it were up to Rio, she’d hand him a can — and front-row seats to two lesbians probably arguing, once again, over whether Ross ever actually deserved Rachel. Or whether it really should’ve been Rachel and Monica. Or maybe that one ex-girlfriend of Chandler’s who looked exactly like Julia Roberts.</p><p>“Who’s back?” Billy calls out, popping his head into Rio’s room just in time to catch her lying on her small, slightly lumpy bed, feet resting against the wall, and head hanging upside down like a bat.</p><p>“Satan’s mistress,” Rio mumbles, sitting up and tugging on her favorite <b>I Have a Nut Allergy</b> hoodie, the one that’s definitely not about anything you’d find in a snack aisle. </p><p>She hops off the bed and trudges into the living room to join them.</p><p>“Didn’t you say she was starting to warm up to you? What happened to that?” Alice calls from the kitchen, sliding cans of beer into the fridge.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio admits, rubbing the back of her neck. “Out of nowhere, she just turns back into this cold, distant, indifferent succubus bitch.” She runs a hand through her hair, suddenly regretting the word. It felt almost unapologetic before, but now it leaves a sour taste in her mouth. “It’s like I’m walking on eggshells all the time, never knowing which Agatha I’m gonna get.”</p><p>“Maybe she just needs more wooing,” Billy offers, plopping onto the couch. “Mom says women like to be wooed. Pretty sure that applies to your hot boss too. You <em> have </em> been wooing her, right?”</p><p>Rio squints at him. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>“What have you been doing to make her warm up to you?”</p><p>Rio thinks for a second. Has she even done anything? As far as she can remember, Agatha simply began warming up to her, in glimpses, like flashes of sunlight through clouds. </p><p>She hadn’t really done much or tried. She was just being herself. “Nothing,” she replies.</p><p>“Well, there’s your problem.”</p><p>Rio throws her hands up. “And how exactly am I supposed to <em> woo </em> her?” She even throws in the air quotes. “She barely talks to me anymore. It’s like I don’t exist again. And every time I see her, I just want to strangle her and pin her to the wall and —” <em> kiss her </em> is what her brain offers, unhelpfully.</p><p>“— slit her throat,” she finishes instead.</p><p>Alice, now joining Billy on the couch, lets out a short laugh. “Well, aren’t you a romantic?” </p><p>Rio just rolls her eyes and nudges her over to make space. </p><p>“What Billy’s trying to say,” Alice goes on, curling her legs up under her, “is maybe try winning her over the old-fashioned way. Bring her flowers. Cook her something. Bake cookies or whatever.” She gives Rio a teasing look. “Didn’t you used to do all that cheesy stuff to woo a couple of girls back in college?”</p><p>Rio snorts as she grabs the remote. </p><p>“Absolutely not. I’m not wooing my boss like she’s some kind of girlfriend.”</p><p>Alice side-eyes her. “Then why are you this upset about her ignoring you?”</p><p>Rio pauses, reaching for an excuse. “Because…I thought I was finally making progress. You know, career-wise. Like, maybe getting a seat at the table. Even if it’s the kiddie table, with plastic chairs and juice boxes.” She sighs. “I thought I was this close to actually being allowed to write something.” </p><p>Then she hits play on the first episode.</p><p>“You know denial isn’t good for you. It’s not very healthy,” Billy says, chips crunching between words. “Mom says it’s like trying to mop up a flood with paper towels. Pointless, messy, and you just end up on your ass. She also says it’s like holding in a fart at a dinner party. The longer you pretend it’s not there, the more it hurts, and eventually everyone’s gonna notice anyway. Might as well just let it out before you explode or ruin the couch.”</p><p>Rio shoots him a look, part annoyed, part grossed out. “Did you really have to use a fart metaphor?” she cringes, shaking her head. She can already imagine how painful it would be to be stuck in a room with Billy and his mom. Endless advice, weird sayings, and unsolicited therapy. It’d be torture. And yet, the kid kind of has a point. But is she really in denial? And if she is, what exactly is she denying?</p><p>After hours of zoning out and only half listening to Billy and Alice argue over the best Friends character, Rio now lies on her bed, staring up at the ceiling, wondering how the hell she managed to land herself in this predicament. Wanting Agatha’s attention, wanting her approval, and, God help her, just wanting to be around her, in whatever manner she could justify.</p><p>And finally, she traces it all back to that one day at Pride. If she hadn’t lied and called in sick, maybe none of this would have happened. That was the moment. The spark that lit the fuse.</p><p>Because ever since then, it’s like someone has turned the volume up on Agatha. </p><p>Every little detail is suddenly louder and impossible to ignore. </p><p>The way she rakes her fingers through her hair when she’s exhausted. The little shoulder shimmy she does when something actually gets to her, even though her face stays all business. The way her mouth tightens, lips pressed in that exact shape Rio now recognizes as seconds from homicide.</p><p>At first, Rio tells herself it’s just a crush. Harmless. Fleeting. Fucking temporary. </p><p>Her boss is gorgeous and hot and somehow walks around radiating the gravitational pull of a dying star. And as Alice once pointed out, Rio is not blind. It doesn’t have to mean anything. Just a little brain static. A hormonal hiccup. A blip. A glitch in the gay matrix. Nothing that actually matters.</p><p>But then she slowly becomes aware of Agatha, and painfully aware of just how aware she is. Agatha lives in her head now, occupying space like she’s built a summer home inside. </p><p>Rio prints files she could just email, just so she has an excuse to walk into Agatha’s office and stare into those clear blue eyes. She even gets a little thrill when she hears Agatha’s voice on the phone when she’s passing calls. Sometimes, she also walks over to Jen’s desk for no real reason, just to catch a quick glimpse of Agatha through the office glass.</p><p>Rio does this. Frequently. Almost obsessively.</p><p>And now, unfortunately, Rio comes to a very real, very inconvenient conclusion: </p><p>She’s into her boss.</p><p>She’s into Agatha.</p><hr/><p>Rio is in an unreasonably cheerful mood as she breezes back into their office, having just completed a covert operation earlier that morning. Fortunately, she’s made a few friends in the bullpen who haven’t asked too many questions about why she showed up so early, only to loiter downstairs for almost an hour.</p><p>That had been the plan: to wait until Jen and, more importantly, their boss are already in. That way, no one will make the connection between Rio and the peace lily sitting on Agatha’s desk.</p><p>It’s a solid plan. One of her finest. And to be fair, Agatha’s office could use a little green. Everything in there is white, black, gray, and just the faintest hint of purple, if you squint.</p><p>She walks to her desk and, out of habit, steals a quick glimpse toward Agatha’s office. </p><p>But one look at her boss and she nearly stumbles.</p><p>Agatha is glued to her laptop, fingers furiously speeding over the keys. Her jaw is taut, her brow furrowed low, and she looks either aggravated or just terrifyingly focused. </p><p>Then Rio angles her head, scanning for the peace lily she’d dropped off earlier. But it’s gone. Not on the desk. Not by the window. Not anywhere. </p><p>Her heart does a small, awkward flop. </p><p>Either Agatha moved it somewhere out of sight, or it’s currently living in a trash bin.</p><p>Rio doesn’t know what kind of plant Agatha might actually like, but a peace lily feels like a safe bet. They’re supposed to turn bad energy into good energy, and help make things a little more peaceful between people. And that’s all Rio really wants: a little peace between her and Agatha.</p><p>Rio’s fingers are mid-sentence on her keyboard when a sharp clack slices through the office, followed by Agatha’s venomous voice: “I said review the layout, not tear it to shreds like an amateur with a goddamn glue stick. Do you even realize how much this mistake is going to cost us? That’s hundreds of thousands of dollars down the drain in ad space and printing, because you couldn’t be bothered to double-check before sending it to print. This is not some student paper stapled together in a dorm. Don’t even bother finishing the day. Pack your things. You’re fired!”</p><p>Rio looks up just in time to see her boss slam the phone into its receiver, eyes locked on the handset like it might have the nerve to ring again. </p><p>Curious, and maybe a little nervous, Rio grabs a few random files and makes her way across the room, passing Jen’s desk. “Okay, what fresh hell is that all about?” </p><p>Jen doesn’t even look up. “Someone left her a psycho plant.”</p><p>Rio feels her stomach sink like stone. </p><p>“I’m sorry, what?” Her voice jumps an octave. “What do you mean, psycho plant?”</p><p>“A peace lily, of all things. Can you imagine? Those things are basically the houseplants of death. You only send them when someone has died. They’re funeral flowers. Obviously, Agatha had it chucked immediately. I suggested calling security, but she was so pissed I think she’d rather track the person down herself. People these days are just so messed up.” </p><p>Rio feels her throat closing from the inside. The internet had said nothing about peace lilies being floral condolences. She had thought they were very pretty, calming even. Exactly the kind of thing someone like Agatha, with her ice-cold office, could use. How did she mess up the one thing she’s usually good at?</p><p>Her eyes return to her boss, where fury is practically carved into every line of her face. She looks like she could incinerate someone with a single, precision-grade glare. Rio forces herself to swallow.</p><p>Oh boy. She didn’t just annoy her.</p><p>She poked the bear.</p><p>And now the bear looks more than ready to maul.</p><p>“You didn’t happen to see who dropped it on her desk, did you?” Jen asks, snapping Rio’s attention back to her. “I think she’s really on a warpath, trying to hunt down whoever had the deranged idea to do it.”</p><p>“Nope. I just got here, remember?”</p><p>Rio’s not exactly a great liar, but when her job (or more importantly, her life) is on the line, she can fake it well enough. Still, her stomach twists into a tight, guilty knot. </p><p>So much for the peaceful gesture. This is not how peace is meant to start. </p><hr/><p>Later that night, Rio gets sent to a penthouse belonging to someone who goes by just Kingo, an actor-turned-designer who apparently ditched his last name the moment fashion decided he was a genius. </p><p>Jen had told her she only needed to “pick something up for Agatha,” which sounded simple enough. What she conveniently forgot to mention was that Kingo lives somewhere in the clouds and hosts parties on random weeknights. </p><p>The second Rio steps through the massive double doors, she’s swallowed by music, chatter, and the very specific scent of wealth. The place is ridiculous: sleek marble floors, gold accents on anything that doesn’t move, and movie posters everywhere featuring Kingo himself in varying degrees of heroic brooding. </p><p>The whole penthouse feels less like a home and more like a shrine. To himself.</p><p>“Welcome! May I help you?” comes a warm, slightly accented voice.</p><p>Rio turns to find a man with a kind face and a gentle belly. </p><p>“Hi. Yes. I’m looking for Kingo?” she says, half-shouting over the music.</p><p>The man places a hand over his chest and gives a small, respectful bow. </p><p>“My name is Karun. My master is just this way.”</p><p>Before Rio can even process the whole “my master” thing, he’s already gliding through the crowd, with her trailing behind him. They weave through clusters of people until they reach Kingo himself, sipping something bright pink and animatedly telling a group about the time he landed a movie with James Cameron while tagging along to Cannes with Harry Styles.</p><p>Kingo doesn’t notice them at first, too busy acting out a slow-motion walk down a red carpet, one hand on his chest, the other pretending to block out fake camera flashes.</p><p>Karun clears his throat politely. “Excuse me, sir. You have a guest.” Kingo spins mid-pose, eyes landing on Rio like he’s assessing a new accessory. Then his face lights up with recognition, or something close to it. “This is Miss...?” Karun adds, gesturing toward Rio to fill in the blank.</p><p>“Uh, hi. Yes. I’m Rio. Agatha Harkness sent me. I’m here to pick something up for her.”</p><p>“Ah! You must be the new Jen,” Kingo says, striding toward her with his arms thrown wide. </p><p>Rio lets out a small laugh, unsure if she’s supposed to hug him or dodge. </p><p>“They didn’t tell me Agatha’s new assistant was such a beauty,” he adds with a wink, already turning away before she can respond. Then he snaps his fingers, more out of habit than rudeness. “Karun, would you mind grabbing the folder from my nightstand? The black one with the gold clasp. Chop-chop. Let’s not keep this lovely guest waiting.”</p><p>It isn’t long before Karun returns, holding a black folder. “My latest design,” Kingo says proudly, taking it and handing it to Rio. “It’s a sketch of what Agatha will be wearing in Berlin. Part of my next collection. No one’s seen it yet. Not even the press. So, you know, don’t go losing it.” He gives her another quick wink. </p><p>“Of course. Got it,” Rio says.</p><p>“And now,” he announces, looping an arm around her shoulders, “since you’re working for the great Agatha Harkness, I’m guessing you could use a very strong drink.”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth to protest, but Kingo's already dragging her to the bar. “The strongest thing you’ve got for this lovely lady,” he tells the bartender, “who, in my humble opinion, has the hardest job in the world.” He takes the drink the bartender hands over and offers it to her with a flourish.</p><p>Rio snorts despite herself and accepts the drink. “Thanks.”</p><p>“Now that you’ve got a drink in hand, I should go mingle. Clearly, I’m very popular tonight.” He gives her a quick, almost fond salute before slipping back into the crowd, already laughing at something someone shouts his way. “Lovely meeting you!” he calls over his shoulder.</p><p>“You too,” Rio calls back, watching him disappear. She looks down at the drink in her hand and is about to take a sip when a voice beside her chimes in.</p><p>“Last time I drank something like that at one of Kingo’s parties, I ended up in the fetal position in someone’s bathtub.”</p><p>Rio jumps a little, then turns to see a tall woman leaning against the bar. “Oh,” she says, immediately setting the glass back down. “Yeah…probably not a great idea.”</p><p>The woman chuckles. “Smart choice.” Then she holds out a hand. “Hela Odinson.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen. “Hela Odinson? As in The Wall Street Journal Hela Odinson?”</p><p>“No, that’s my twin.”</p><p>“Hela has a twin?”</p><p>The woman lets out a full laugh this time. </p><p>“Sorry, I’m just messing with you. But I do wish I had a twin. Instead, I got stuck with two idiot brothers.” Her tone is dry, but there’s a spark of humor in her eyes. “Though I see you’ve read my work.”</p><p>“I’ve read almost everything you’ve written. I even used your essay collection for my college paper.”</p><p>“Look at you, flattering a journalist’s oversized ego. Did you also mention my devastating good looks and irresistible charm?” She watches Rio with a smile that feels just a little too warm. </p><p>The latter offers a nervous smile, unsure what to say. But Hela leans in, closing the space between them just a little. “So, what is it you do? A writer too, I’m guessing?”</p><p>“Um, yes. I do write, but—” </p><p>“Well then, you should send me something,” Hela says. “I’d love to read it.”</p><p>“Wait, are you serious?” Rio blinks, and Hela just nods. “Wow, that’d be really great,” she says, then pauses as the reality catches up to her. “But the thing is, I haven’t written anything new in a while. I’ve kind of been tied up lately…working as Agatha Harkness’s assistant.”</p><p>Hela stops mid-sip. “Oh, you’re kidding, right? Really? Agatha Harkness?” she says, as if simply saying the name puts a foul taste in her mouth.</p><p>“Yes. She’s my boss. That’s why I’m here,” Rio replies, holding up the black folder.</p><p>Hela lets out a low whistle and takes another sip of her drink. “That’s rough. You’re not gonna last.”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“I’m just saying, any job tied to Agatha Harkness doesn’t exactly come with long-term potential,” Hela says with a dry smile. “The woman’s ruthless. A total sadist, and not the fun kind, either.”</p><p>Rio isn’t sure why she feels the need to say anything, but the words come out before she can stop them. “Okay, sure, she’s tough. But if Agatha were a man, no one would be calling her anything. They’d just be talking about how damn good she is at what she does.”</p><p>Hela gives her a look. “Ah. We’ve got ourselves a worshipper.”</p><p>“I don’t worship her.” She is, however, teetering dangerously close to it. </p><p>“Well,” Hela says, laughing under her breath, “you seem very smart. And way too nice to be working for someone like Agatha. I’m just saying, someone with a soul doesn’t deserve to be taking orders from someone who doesn’t. That job doesn’t really suit you, darling.” She gives Rio a once-over, the smirk never quite leaving her face.</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath and just gives her a tight smile. “I think I’ll head out.”</p><p>Hela chuckles, clearly sensing she might’ve touched a nerve. “Alright,” she says, reaching into her clutch and pulling out a card. “No hard feelings. And I really meant what I said about your writing. Send it my way anytime, or whenever you finally escape Agatha’s clutches.” She hands it over with a small, crooked smile.</p><p>Rio takes the card politely. “Thanks. And…thanks again for the heads-up,” she says, nodding toward the abandoned drink before turning and walking off.</p><hr/><p>The next morning, Rio shows up early at work, just like last time. She walks into Agatha’s office before anyone else arrives, carrying a small bunny ear cactus, and carefully sets it down on the desk. </p><p>Clipped underneath is a printed note explaining the real meaning of a peace lily, along with a short handwritten message that reads: <em> “In case things got lost in translation.” </em></p><p>She’d spent hours last night scrolling through the internet, making sure the message couldn’t possibly be misunderstood again. Feeling cautiously hopeful, Rio turns to head to the bullpen, only to freeze when she sees Agatha standing in the doorway. </p><p>What the hell? Why is she here this early?</p><p>“What exactly do you think you’re doing?” Agatha asks. She’s in a trench coat, hair pulled back into a ponytail, and Rio tries not to get too distracted by how unfairly good she looks, given the situation. Agatha’s eyes land on the cactus on her desk. “What is this? Are you trying to be funny?” </p><p>“No! No, of course not.” Rio nearly trips over herself as she quickly grabs the note and holds it out to her. “I didn’t mean for the peace lily to come off like that. That wasn’t the point. Just…here. Read this.”</p><p>Agatha reads the note silently, then looks back up at her. “This still doesn’t explain why you keep leaving little green footprints all over my office. Do I look like someone who wants to adopt your plants?” </p><p>“I’m just trying to make peace,” Rio confesses. Agatha only stares at her, so she keeps going. “I don’t know what I did, or why you started ignoring me again, but whatever it is, I’m trying to make up for it.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow arches. “All this because you think I’m ignoring you?”</p><p>“Yes, and we both know it.”</p><p>Agatha gives her a long look. “So what, you think you’ve got me all figured out now?”</p><p>“No. Not even close. But I’d really like to.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” </p><p>“I said I want to get to know you,” Rio says. “And I think you're a little curious about me too.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her for a moment, then lets out a small, dry laugh. “Well, aren’t you bold, saying things that blunt to your boss in a job you haven’t even had long enough to settle into.”</p><p>Rio glances at herself, almost questioning it. </p><p>Four months, isn’t that long enough? It sure feels long, given everything that’s happened. </p><p>“My dad used to say that too, that I get too blunt and honest when I’m frustrated. I always told him I got it from him, and he’d just laugh, because it was true.”</p><p>She looks at Agatha, who still seems to be processing what she just said.</p><p>“But if I read you wrong, if I thought you wanted to know me the way I wanted to know you, then I apologize,” Rio adds. “Just know the peace lily wasn’t meant to mock you.” She reaches for the cactus, ready to take it back, when Agatha finally speaks.</p><p>“I have to go to Carlton later this afternoon. Make sure you finish all your work before lunch so you can come with me,” she says. They look at each other for a beat. “And leave the plant,” she adds. “But that’ll still be your responsibility. I don’t know how to take care of it, so don’t expect anything from me. If it dies from neglect, I’m tossing it straight in the bin.”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio says, trying not to sound too pleased.</p><p>Agatha walks past her to her desk. “And would you please wipe that grin off your face,” she tosses over her shoulder. “No one should be that cheerful at seven in the damn morning.”</p><p>But Rio can’t help it, her smile only grows as she slips out of Agatha’s office.</p><p>The thing, whatever it is, just keeps going. One outing turns into two, then three, and before Rio knows it, three weeks have passed. Agatha brings her everywhere now. </p><p>Meetings. Site visits. Run-throughs. Dress fittings. Fabric picking. Private showroom appointments in tucked-away studios. Walkthroughs for campaign photoshoots. One painfully silent lunch with a notoriously terrifying designer who looked at Rio like she was chewing with her mouth open. And then there was that one morning Agatha made her choose between two dresses that looked exactly the same, except one was “winter white” and the other was “bone.”</p><p>“Let Jen know I’m meeting Pepper tomorrow,” Agatha says from the backseat, eyes still on her phone as they speed down the highway to the Hamptons. “Tell her to schedule it over lunch. I want a believable excuse to escape that woman whenever I feel like it.” She sighs, setting her phone down. “I still don’t understand why that old man insists on getting married out here. There are plenty of overpriced venues in the city that could match whatever ridiculous spectacle he’s planning for wife number seven.”</p><p>“Seven? Seriously?” Rio asks from her corner of the backseat, keeping a safe distance between them.</p><p>“Oh, you’d be surprised how often men feel the urge to stick their dicks into something new the second they get bored,” Agatha says, sliding on her sunglasses. “I just wonder how many wives he’ll burn through before his sad wrinkled dick finally gives out and dies.”</p><p>Rio looks over at Agatha, then turns to the window. The sky is clear, but the air feels heavy, like rain is just around the corner. Nature’s got jokes today. All that money, and not one of these rich people thought to check the weather for their big wedding. Or maybe it’s just God’s way of messing with the wealthy.</p><p>“If you hate coming out here so much, then why even bother?”</p><p>Agatha finally turns to her, sunglasses on, but Rio can still see her eyes through the tint. </p><p>“Because, unfortunately, that dreaded dick owns a sizable share of Tony’s company. And if things go sideways with these ego-driven idiots, Ross might just yank it straight from Tony’s ass.” She leans back in her seat. “That’s why we’re here. Stuck dealing with the same bullshit, just a different side of it.”</p><p>They arrive at the venue for what’s supposed to be a dreamy beach wedding. </p><p>The ceremony goes off without a hitch, aside from the strong wind, the sky turning the color of bruised peaches, and the nearly torrential downpour shortly before the reception. </p><p>“Perhaps this is what happens when a 78-year-old man marries someone young enough to be his granddaughter fresh out of high school,” Agatha had said when she found Rio in the corner and told her it was time to head home. </p><p>“Okay, so aside from your lunch with Ms. Potts tomorrow, you have a video conference scheduled with Nocturne France and Madrid first thing in the morning,” Rio reads from her phone as rain lashes against the windows. “Then there’s a brief walkthrough with the stylists scheduled at three.”</p><p>Rain drums harder against the windows, and every so often, thunder rumbles in the distance. It’s not loud, but close enough that Rio catches the subtle flinch her boss makes. She is angled slightly toward the window and hasn’t said a word since the car pulled out.</p><p>“Jen also said some people from Harper’s dropped by your office,” Rio continues. “Didn’t leave much detail. Just said they needed to speak with you in person. Want me to send a reply?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“What?” Agatha blinks, as if she’s just been pulled from a deep thought. “Oh, right. Just tell them I’ll be available the day after tomorrow. Afternoon only. After all my actual priorities.” </p><p>Rio lowers her phone, watching her a beat longer. “You alright?”</p><p>Agatha turns her head slightly. “What makes you think I’m not?”</p><p>“Sorry. You just seem a little—” </p><p>She doesn’t get to finish the thought, because the car suddenly slows to a stop. </p><p>Rio leans forward, spotting the problem right away. There’s a large tree sprawled across the road, with a few people in ponchos gathered around it like they’ve been there for hours.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Agatha asks, sitting up straighter. “Why are we stopping?”</p><p>Javier looks at them through the rearview mirror. “There’s a big tree down up ahead, Miss Harkness. Looks like the wind took it out. It’s blocking the whole road.”</p><p>“Is there another way around it?” </p><p>“I’ll check.” Javier opens the door, grabs an umbrella from the side pocket, and steps out into the rain.</p><p>With just the two of them left in the car, Rio casts another glance at Agatha, who appears even more tense now that they’re not moving. After a few minutes, Javier returns, brushing rain from his shoulders.</p><p>“Sorry, ma’am. Locals say the tree’s not getting cleared until sometime tomorrow. It’s too big to move without heavy equipment. The only option is to turn around.”</p><p>“Turn around?” Agatha echoes. “What do you mean turn around?” </p><p>“I’m really sorry, Miss Harkness but we’ll have to find somewhere nearby to stay the night.”</p><p>She exhales slowly through her nose. “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”</p><p>The fifth hotel they pull into is more rundown than anything Agatha would normally set foot in. But stuck in Manorville with the miserable, godforsaken timing of a storm and every other place fully booked, it’s their only shot at staying dry and maybe getting a half-decent night’s sleep.</p><p>“One?” Rio asks, standing there soaked through, arms wrapped tightly around herself. “Just one room?”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am. All the other rooms were booked earlier after the road closed.” </p><p>Rio leans forward, dripping water onto the counter. </p><p>“Are you absolutely sure? Could you maybe check again? Sometimes rooms don’t show up in the system right away, right? Or maybe there’s one that just hasn’t been cleaned yet? That happens.”</p><p>“I’m really sorry but I already checked twice. Just the one.”</p><p>Rio can feel her teeth wanting to chatter from the cold, and maybe from stress, too. The receptionist keeps typing like this happens every day and isn’t, in fact, a minor crisis for Rio personally.</p><p>“Well?” Agatha says as she walks up, sliding her phone into her coat pocket, fresh off a call and clearly out of patience. “How long does it take to book a damn room in this town?”</p><p>“They’ve got a room,” Rio says. “Just one.”</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow. “And?”</p><p>“And it’s yours. I’ll see if there’s another place nearby. Javier might’ve found something already.”</p><p>“He did,” Agatha replies. “Said something about a motel ten minutes down the road.”</p><p>“Great,” Rio nods. “I’ll have him swing back and pick me up.”</p><p>“That won’t be necessary. I already told him to pick us up here tomorrow morning.”</p><p>Rio blinks. “Us?” </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow. “You didn’t seriously think I was going to sleep here alone, did you?” She gestures vaguely at the sad little lobby: the flickering light, the lumpy floral couch that’s probably older than both of them, and the faint smell of damp carpet. “What if I need something later? Are you planning to drive back through a storm? Or do you have teleportation powers I should know about?”</p><p>Rio’s head is still reeling from the fact that she and Agatha will be sharing a room, she can’t even get a word out.</p><p>“And if you think I’m sleeping in some roadside motel, you’ve clearly lost your mind,” her boss adds, turning to the receptionist. “We’ll take the room. And if you’ve got an extra mattress, kindly send it up.”</p><p>Rio blinks again. “You’re actually serious?”</p><p>“What? You’d rather your boss sleep on the floor?”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth to argue, then closes it again. </p><p>Because of course Agatha Harkness would say that with a straight face.</p><p>And of course Rio’s dumb enough to follow her up the stairs anyway.</p><hr/><p>Rio steps out of the shower, wrapped in a robe the hotel provided. She’d usually just wear a tank top and boxers to sleep, she never minded people seeing her like that. But something about Agatha makes her hesitate. Confidence doesn’t come as easy around her boss.</p><p>She finds Agatha sitting on the bed, back against the headboard, flipping through channels like she’s annoyed at all of them. The volume’s cranked up so loud, Rio can barely hear the rain or the distant rumble of thunder outside.</p><p>Rio hovers by the bathroom door for a second, then steps further into the room, drying her hair with the towel draped over her shoulders. She squints at the blaring screen. </p><p>“Does it have to be this loud?” she calls over the noise.</p><p>But Agatha doesn’t answer. She just keeps flipping through the channels: news, weather, an old black-and-white movie, static, then news again. Her eyes don’t move much. Nothing seems to catch her attention, and it’s pretty clear she’s not finding whatever it is she’s looking for.</p><p>Rio tries again. “You’re not even watching anything.”</p><p>Agatha keeps flipping. “Everything’s either depressing or stupid.” Then she sighs, tosses the remote aside, and leans her head back against the headboard.</p><p>A second later, thunder crashes. Loud and close, like it struck right outside the window.</p><p>Rio jumps a little. “Jesus,” her breath catches, placing a hand on her chest.</p><p>The lights cut out all at once. The TV goes black. The room immediately descends into darkness, punctuated only by the sound of rain pounding hard against the windows. </p><p>“Shit. The power’s out,” she adds, stating the obvious as she squints toward where Agatha had been sitting. For a second, Rio thinks her boss might say something. But when her eyes adjust to the dark, she realizes Agatha hasn’t even moved.</p><p>She’s sitting stiffly against the headboard, knees now pulled up, hands over her ears, and eyes shut tight. Rio watches from where she’s standing, and just like she guessed earlier, Agatha’s afraid of thunder.</p><p>“Agatha?” She takes a step forward, careful not to trip on anything. “Hey, it’s okay. It’s just thunder.” She kneels gently at the edge of the bed. “You’re alright. It’s just the storm. The lights will come back on soon.”</p><p>But before Rio can even reach out to comfort her, there’s a sudden knock at the door. </p><p>She gets up quickly and crosses the room in a few careful steps. </p><p>When she opens the door, a hotel staff member is standing there with a flashlight, rain dripping from his coat. “Sorry for the trouble, ma’am,” he says, slightly out of breath. “Lightning hit a nearby transformer. Power’s gonna be out for a while.” Then he hands her a small emergency lantern. “This should help for now. Just press the button on the side.”</p><p>Rio nods. “Alright. Thanks for coming up and letting us know.”</p><p>She closes the door and switches on the lantern, filling the room with a soft, warm glow, and sees Agatha still on the bed. She's no longer covering her ears, and her eyes are open, but her face remains blank and seemingly distant. Rio walks over and sets the lantern down on the nightstand. “Hey, you okay?” she asks her again, even though it’s clear she’s not. But what is Rio even supposed to say?</p><p>Then, as if the light turned on a switch, Agatha sits up straighter and takes a long, deep breath before schooling her face into something calmer and more neutral. “I’m fine,” she adds, grabbing for her phone, only to scowl. “Of course, it’s dead. Damn it.” Without hesitation, she flings it against the nearest wall, causing the phone to crack before bouncing to the floor. She then turns to Rio like nothing happened. “Hand over your phone. I need to check a few emails.”</p><p>Rio stares at her with wide eyes. “Should I be worried you’ll throw mine too if it’s dead?” Agatha only shoots her a glare. “Because it is,” Rio adds, holding up her hands. “I forgot to charge it.”</p><p>Her boss rolls her eyes. “What kind of assistant forgets to charge her phone?”</p><p>“The kind who ends up unexpectedly stuck in a storm with her boss,” Rio replies, deadpan.</p><p>Agatha lets out a tired sigh and leans back against the headboard. </p><p>“Fine. Just make sure to tell Jen to have a new one waiting on my desk the minute we’re back in the city.”</p><p>Another rumble of thunder rolls through. It’s not as loud as the last one, but Agatha still flinches somewhat. She curls her hand into a fist, and she appears more annoyed than anything else, as if she is frustrated with herself for reacting at all.</p><p>Rio notices it but doesn’t say anything at first. Then, softly, “Let’s just try to get some sleep.” She walks over to the other side of the bed where the extra mattress has been set on the floor and lies down without another word. The rain keeps pouring outside, but neither of them says anything.</p><p>Another low rumble of thunder comes through, a bit louder this time, but not enough to make the windows shudder. From the floor, Rio hears the soft rustle of sheets and the creak of the mattress above her.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>There’s a pause. Then Agatha replies, “I’m fine.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” </p><p>“I said I’m fine, Rio.” </p><p>Rio doesn’t believe it, but she doesn’t push.</p><p>She stares at the ceiling for a while, trying to focus on the sound of rain tapping against the windows. But she can still hear Agatha shifting above her, like she just can’t get comfortable. </p><p>“You know,” she attempts, trying to redirect Agatha’s attention away from the storm outside, “when I was a kid, every time it rained like this, my dad and I would build a fort in my room. Blankets, pillows, chairs, whatever we could find. He always said as long as we were inside, no thunder could get us.”</p><p>There’s no reply, but she keeps going. “I used to believe him. Even when I got older. I think I still do, a little.” Her eyes trace the faint lines on the ceiling.</p><p>“We also had this old flashlight shaped like a duck,” she continues. “Beak lit up yellow. It barely worked, but we always used that one for the fort. Dad said the warm light made it cozier. I think he just liked that it looked stupid.” She smiles to herself, eyes closing for a moment.</p><p>“He also said storms were just the sky throwing a tantrum. Like maybe it needed someone to talk to.”</p><p>Rio turns her head slightly toward the bed. “So if you hear me talking too much...just know I’m just giving the storm a conversation.” She pulls the blanket up to her chin. “He also used to say the best way to handle fear was to make something out of it. A story, a joke, a pillow fort.” She snorts.</p><p>There’s a pause. Long enough that she thinks maybe Agatha has already fallen asleep. But then:</p><p>“What does he do now? Still building pillow forts in his spare time?”</p><p>Rio’s smile fades a little and stares at the ceiling again. </p><p>“No,” she says. “He died when I was fifteen. My mami followed four years later.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha says. She doesn’t follow it with <em> I’m sorry </em>, and Rio’s oddly thankful for it. Another beat, and then Agatha adds, “He sounds like he was a good dad. And I’m guessing your mom was, too.”</p><p>Rio nods, even if Agatha can’t see it. “Yeah. They were.”</p><p>The room falls silent again. The rain keeps its rhythm outside, but it starts sounding like it’s finally tired itself out. Rio figures that’s it. That her boss has finally drifted off, or at least lost interest in talking.</p><p>But then, softly, almost like she’s asking more out of instinct than intention. </p><p>“What happened to them?”</p><p>Rio takes a breath, eyes still fixed on the ceiling. </p><p>“My dad was a reporter. Always chasing something. Stories, leads, the truth, or whatever piece of it came closest. He was driving back from an out-of-town assignment, trying to make it in time for this writing competition I’d joined. He was exhausted, hadn’t slept in over a day.” She pauses, remembering how she was still clutching the medal she eventually won when she got the news. “He dozed off behind the wheel, and he just never made it.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond but Rio can feel she’s still listening.</p><p>“And my mom. She always said her heart gave out when he died. I thought it was just a figure of speech, you know, something people say when they’re grieving. But it turned out she actually had heart disease. She never told anyone, not until it got really bad. She fought hard, though. For me. But Dad was the love of her life. So in the end, I don’t think anything could’ve kept her from finding her way back to him.”</p><p>Some people used to say they felt sorry for Rio. That it was a tragedy, losing both her parents so young. That she should be upset at them for leaving her behind. </p><p>But Rio never was. </p><p>She’d seen how much her parents loved each other. How deep that love ran. And if those same people had witnessed it, really seen it, they might’ve understood why one couldn’t live without the other. </p><p>And her parents had loved Rio so deeply, it felt like it could last a lifetime. So she never felt unloved. If anything, she felt grateful. </p><p>“And you’ve been on your own since?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“Not exactly. I was already legal when my mom died, so I didn’t go into foster care or anything like that. But our next-door neighbors, Lorna and her daughter Alice, who I grew up with, took me in. Lorna was like a second mom, and Alice felt more like a sister than a friend. So they were basically family.”</p><p>Another beat passes, and as if sensing where the conversation is headed, Agatha finally speaks.</p><p>“I’m guessing Alice was the one you were with at Pride? The girl with the red streak in her hair?”</p><p>“Yeah, that was her,” Rio says, a grin slowly spreading across her face. “She’s the reason I even went to that parade in the first place. And the baby gay we were reluctantly assigned to babysit.”</p><p>“The kid with the eyeliner?”</p><p>“The teenager with the eyeliner, yes.” Rio snorts. “Honestly, I’m surprised you even remember that.”</p><p>“Well, it wasn’t exactly subtle. It was the first time someone had the audacity to lie to my face.”</p><p>Rio lets out a real laugh. “Hey, in my defense, it was a harmless lie.”</p><p>“And in mine,” Agatha replies, “it was still deeply irritating.”</p><p>Rio laughs even harder, and to her astonishment, she hears a soft chuckle from Agatha too.</p><p>Another boom of thunder rolls through, and the laughing fades.</p><p>Rio wants to ask why it rattles Agatha so much, why every rumble seems to reach something deep. </p><p>But there’s something in the way she reacts that tells Rio not to push. At least not tonight. So she keeps the question to herself.</p><p>Instead, as the thunder quiets down, she looks up toward the bed and says, “Do you want to build a fort?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a real laugh, with a small snort in the middle that makes Rio blink in surprise. It’s the first time she’s heard her boss laugh like that, and she can’t help but smile.</p><p>“I’m serious. A fort will keep the thunder out. My dad swore by it. And your blanket would make a solid roof, by the way.”</p><p>“No, Rio. I’m thirty-eight. I’m not building a fort with you.”</p><p>“You sure? It’ll be so much fun.”</p><p>“Build your own damn fort. I’m going to try and get some sleep.” Her boss sounds annoyed, but Rio can still hear the endearing smile tucked behind the words.</p><p>“Do you want me to hold your hand? My mom said that helps too.”</p><p>“Now you’re just being annoying,” Agatha says, tossing a pillow at her assistant, who can’t stop grinning to herself in the dark.</p><hr/><p>The days that follow feel like a fever dream for Rio. She still does her usual work, but it doesn’t feel as bad as it did when she first started. It doesn’t even feel like punishment anymore. </p><p>In fact, being in the office actually starts to excite her, especially when she sneaks in extra potted plants for Agatha’s office early in the morning, before anyone else arrives. She leaves little notes under each one and sometimes catches a glimpse of Agatha trying not to smile or laugh at the things she wrote.</p><p>On a random Wednesday, she gives Agatha a flash drive full of songs she actually listens to. Her boss, of course, had acted like she wasn’t interested and couldn’t care less. But a few hours later, Rio catches her with earphones in, fingers drumming lightly on the desk. And when Rio teases her about it, Agatha doesn’t deny it, and just rolls her eyes. Which, to Rio, basically feels like a confession. She now considers it a personal achievement: being the one who finally got the great Agatha Harkness to listen to boygenius.</p><p>More than before, Rio keeps joining her boss in closed-door meetings and starts picking up on Agatha’s little tells. She always looks calm, in control, and like the most put-together person in the room. </p><p>But Rio catches the small things: how she zones out for half a second, the sighs, the quick glances at her watch. How her face changes just a bit when someone talks too much. Those had become Rio’s cue to stage a fake phone call from the office, giving her and her boss the perfect excuse to leave.</p><p>Then there’s the magazine work again, where Rio somewhat helps Agatha sort through articles. </p><p>At one point, Agatha even tells her she’s surprisingly good at deciding what goes in, at least when it’s political and not just runway gossip. That’s followed by Agatha casually asking where Rio plans to apply once she starts taking journalism seriously. It catches Rio off guard because she hadn’t even realized Agatha had noticed, let alone thought about it. But the latter just says, “Your heart’s in writing. I knew it the minute you walked into my office that first day.”</p><p>At the end of each day, Rio still delivers the book at Agatha’s townhouse, and sometimes she catches her in the home office or the living room, half-dressed and surrounded by a swarm of stylists. </p><p>It doesn’t escape Rio that Agatha asks for her opinion every so often, even though she knows Rio has no clue about fashion, and even though it always earns a few confused, curious glances from the rest of the room. Still, Rio figures Agatha thinks she has an eye for what works, and maybe she’s right. </p><p>Because, boy, Rio does have eyes. Especially when it comes to how a dress hugs Agatha’s waist just right, how a slit shows just enough leg, how black and navy make her skin practically glow. </p><p>And, well, most of the dresses do an excellent job of pushing her breasts up in all the right ways. </p><p>That’s usually the part where Rio has to remind herself to look literally anywhere else, and to stop looking like she might drool.</p><p>“Is there anything else?” Agatha asks, slipping on her coat as she looks at Rio. It's past seven on a Friday night, and the entire floor has emptied out, leaving only the two of them in Agatha's office as usual.</p><p>Rio double-checks her notes. “Nope. That’s everything. You’re free for the rest of the evening.”</p><p>“And you? Also free the rest of the evening?”</p><p>Rio blinks. “Me?”</p><p>“Well, since I’m miraculously free, I assume you are too. Or do you have some tragically average date waiting at a rooftop bar like the rest of the lost souls on this godforsaken floor?”</p><p>Rio chuckles. “No. No dates. No plans either. Alice is out of town for a gig.”</p><p>“Perfect. That means you’re coming with me tonight.”</p><p>“Coming where, exactly?”</p><p>“I’m in the mood for sea urchin pasta, truffle risotto, and maybe a whole Breton lobster flown in from Brittany. Oh, and a bottle of something older than both of us. You’ll join me while I indulge.” Agatha breezes past her, heels clicking against the tile, then pauses at the threshold when Rio doesn’t follow. “Why are you still standing there? Come on. The place closes at ten.”</p><p>Rio just stares, tongue pressed to the inside of her cheek. </p><p>“Agatha, are you asking me out on a date?”</p><p>Her boss looks at her, a little taken aback, then actually laughs. </p><p>“Sometimes I forget how ridiculous and blunt the things are that come out of your mouth.” Agatha rolls her eyes as Rio’s grin only widens, that signature gap between her teeth on full display. “But no, it’s not a date. I’m simply rewarding my infuriatingly competent assistant for a job well done this week.” She waves a hand, already turning away. “Now wipe that smug little grin off your face and meet me in the car.”</p><p>The restaurant is set al fresco, right by the river, with the city lights dancing on the water like tiny stars. </p><p>It’s obvious Agatha comes here often from the way the staff greet her like they know her well, already leading them to her usual table and reciting her usual order without being asked. </p><p>The air smells of fresh herbs and grilled seafood, and Rio can faintly hear traffic from the bridge nearby. </p><p>It basically feels like New York pretending to be Paris.</p><p>“Okay, so this was peak stupid,” Rio grins as she spears a piece of shrimp. Agatha had just asked her about a fond memory growing up. “Alice and I were like nine, maybe ten. She had this janky old pink Barbie Jeep, one of those Power Wheels that were all the rage back then? She begged Lorna for it for Christmas. And for some reason, our idiot friends thought it’d be genius to duct-tape Roman candles to the back. Like we were turning it into a damn rocket or something.”</p><p>Agatha slowly sets her glass down. “And let me guess, you thought it was genius too.”</p><p>“Hey, I was a kid obsessed with outer space. Of course I thought it was genius,” she laughs, then leans in a little, evidently enjoying herself. “So there I was, in the driver’s seat of this pink Barbie Jeep, goggles on, Alice riding shotgun, and the plan was she’d light the Roman candles while I drove.”</p><p>Agatha tries not to look too entertained. “And did this plan of yours actually work?”</p><p>“Oh, it worked, alright,” Rio says proudly, laughing so hard she can barely get the words out. “For seven glorious seconds, we were flying down the street in this pink, plastic firework chariot. The most beautiful kind of madness a ten-year-old could ever dream of.”</p><p>Agatha simply looks at her fondly, and Rio isn’t sure what to do with it so she just keeps talking. “But then the battery dies halfway. The car just stops, completely dead, right in front of Mr. Miller’s yard, which was conveniently covered in a giant pile of dry leaves.”</p><p>“Oh god, you didn’t?” Agatha says, smiling now like she already knows where the story’s going. </p><p>Rio grins, shrugging. “The Roman candle sparks shot straight into the pile of leaves.”</p><p>Agatha gapes at her, laughing. “You little arsonist.”</p><p>“Well, to be fair, it wasn’t even that big. It was just a baby fire,” Rio says through a laugh. “But unfortunately, it was still enough to send Mr. Miller sprinting out of his house in slippers and a fishing hat, screaming bloody murder and calling the Delaware Fire Department.”</p><p>And her boss actually laughs out loud. “And somehow, you both still made it to adulthood.”</p><p>Rio rests her chin in her hand, still smiling. “Barely. We were grounded for two weeks and banned from anything that plugs in or uses batteries. But totally worth it. That Barbie Jeep really looked badass.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, smiling despite herself, then watches Rio for a beat longer.</p><p>“Do you miss it?”</p><p>“The Barbie Jeep?” Rio grins.</p><p>Agatha snorts and rolls her eyes, but Rio catches the softness in it, and knows exactly what she meant. Her own smile lingers as she leans back, eyes drifting to her glass.</p><p>“I mean…yeah, sometimes. Delaware’s always gonna be home in a way,” she answers with a small shrug. She pauses, then adds, “I’m actually planning to go visit them in a few weeks. It would’ve been their 25th anniversary. And I’ve got a feeling they’d straight-up haunt my ass if I didn’t show.”</p><p>A waitress then approaches their table with two beautifully plated desserts, and Rio looks between them, realizing hers is different from what Agatha is having. </p><p>Her boss seems to catch the look and says, “I figured you’d like that one better, since you always scrape off the frosting on those cheap cupcakes you bring to the office, and you barely touched that caramel drink Javier got you the other day.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond right away, caught off guard once again by the fact that Agatha had noticed something so small about her. But instead of sitting with that realization, and noticing that Agatha doesn’t seem to think much of what she just said, she blurts out the first thing that comes to mind.</p><p>“Alright, enough about me. What about you? Any fond childhood memories?” </p><p>Agatha raises a brow, as if the idea itself is foreign. She takes a slow sip of her wine before replying, “Nothing quite as exciting as yours. I was homeschooled most of my life, so I didn’t really grow up with friends. The closest thing I had were our old neighbors and a pet rabbit my father gave me. Probably just to shut me up about wanting to go to an actual school.” </p><p>Rio tilts her head. “Wait, seriously?”</p><p>“I was homeschooled until high school by this old hag named Mrs. Parker who used to smack my wrist with a ruler if I so much as slouched,” Agatha says simply, and Rio just looks at her, not sure what to say. “I was mostly on my own. Sometimes my parents had friends over, and they’d bring their kids, but let’s just say I didn’t exactly make the best impression to earn their friendship.”</p><p>“And why’s that?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs, taking another slow sip of her wine. “I once put gum and a beetle in one of their daughters’ hair after she called me a freak for not going to school like the rest of them.”</p><p>Rio chokes on her drink, trying not to laugh. “That’s diabolical. And kind of sad.”</p><p>“Well, I beg to differ,” her boss replies dryly. “Because that was when my mother finally decided I needed proper socialization. So she threw me into an actual school. Catholic, of course, but at least it got me out of the house. And it also happened to be where I realized I really, really like girls. So I guess I should be thanking my dear mother for that.”</p><p>As Rio laughs into her drink, a voice speaks from behind them.</p><p>“Agatha?” </p><p>They both turn, and Rio looks up at an older woman in pearls and a cream shawl, clutching what looks like a very expensive handbag. She appears to be in her late seventies, with perfectly combed hair and a face pulled so tight Rio could almost count the Botox injections.</p><p>Agatha sits up a little straighter. “Mrs. Davis.”</p><p>“My goodness, it’s been ages,” the woman coos. “I almost didn’t recognize you. My, how you’ve grown. The last time I saw you, you were practically glued to your nanny’s hip at every garden party. How are you, dear?” But before Agatha can answer, the woman barrels on. “I heard your cousin’s wedding is next week. She’s marrying that sweet rich boy from Monaco, yes? Will you be attending?”</p><p>“I’m still working through my schedule,” Agatha replies, though Rio knows her boss hasn’t even thought about clearing her calendar for it next week. “Running a magazine keeps me pretty busy.”</p><p>“Oh, just like your father. Always so driven and all business. My Lisa recently tied the knot, too. Lovely ceremony. Good young man, and very well-off,” she says with a self-satisfied chuckle. “They’re already talking about babies. You know, women your age aren’t getting any younger. I always wondered when you’d settle down with a nice man yourself. Your mother wouldn’t say a word when asked about you. She just tells us you’re too busy to even find a man. Or maybe you already have?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t blink. “No, I haven’t found a man,” she says, raising her glass. “And I manage just fine without. But please give Lisa and her husband my best. I’m sure there’ll be grandkids soon enough to wear down your already fragile hips. If they haven’t started already.” She sips her drink slowly, still smiling, as if she’d just paid the woman a compliment.</p><p>Rio nearly chokes on her drink trying not to laugh, but the stern look Mrs. Davis throws her way says she didn’t quite pull it off. The older woman straightens her shoulders, visibly trying to recover her dignity as she turns back to Agatha. </p><p>“Still as spirited as ever, I see. Well, I won’t keep you. My husband’s waiting in the car.” Her eyes pass over Agatha, then linger on Rio a little longer, her courteous smile barely concealing the judgment behind it, before returning to the other woman. “It was really lovely seeing you, dear. I’ll let your mother know you’re…doing quite well.” She throws one last loaded look to the both of them, then turns and walks away.</p><p>Rio watches the old woman reach the doorway, a sarcastic comment already forming in her head. But when she turns back, the words instantly disappear, because Agatha is already looking at her. And if Rio is not imagining it, there’s something in her eyes. A little worry. Maybe even a bit of fear.</p><p>“Hey, are you okay?” She places her hand on top of Agatha’s without really thinking. </p><p>The touch seems to snap Agatha out of whatever thought she was lost in. She looks at their hands for a moment, then quickly pulls hers away.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she clears her throat and takes one last sip of her drink. “But I think we should call it a night. I just remembered I’ve got an early weekend tomorrow. And also, all this wine is starting to get to me.”</p><p>Before Rio can say anything, Agatha raises a hand to get the waiter’s attention. </p><p>“Simon. The check, please.”</p><p>The ride to Rio’s apartment is thick with silence. She’d wanted to take the subway, but Agatha insisted on driving her and made sure Javier was okay with it. Javier, of course, said he didn’t mind. </p><p>Rio has no clue why the mood between her and Agatha turned so sharply after that awkward run-in with one of her mother’s high-society cronies. They’d been laughing and talking just moments before, and now it feels like someone hit a lever, and Agatha’s icy wall slides right back up into place. </p><p>Guess even fever dreams have a bedtime.</p><p>Rio looks across at her, who is pointedly staring out the window as the city lights blur by. Then her eyes drop to the small space between them, their fingers just inches apart. She knows Agatha feels it too.</p><p>She stays still for a few more seconds, staring straight ahead and weighing the consequences of what she’s about to do. </p><p>But then, perhaps fueled by a late surge of courage from all the wine she’d had earlier, she takes a deep breath and slowly hooks her pinky around Agatha’s. </p><p>Their fingers touch for a brief second before Agatha moves her hand, flicking a strand of hair behind her ear. </p><p>“I almost forgot,” she breaks the silence as well as Rio’s fragile rush of bravery. “Tell Jen I won’t be coming in next week. Have her cancel all my personal meetings, and move the important ones online if you can.”</p><p>Rio stares at her briefly, then pulls out her phone. </p><p>“You’re going to your cousin’s wedding?”</p><p>She doesn’t even try to hide her surprise, especially since Agatha never had any plans to begin with, and has also been deliberately ignoring every call from Morris County that’s come into the office since that last conversation with her mother months ago.</p><p>Agatha answers the question with another instruction. </p><p>“Also, tell Sue and Monica to send a few dresses and suits to my place tomorrow morning. One for the wedding, obviously. One for the rehearsal dinner, and two more in case my family throws any last-minute crappy get-togethers. And it’s going to be a garden wedding, so nothing floral and absolutely no frills. If they so much as send me anything with ruffles, I’ll strangle them with it myself.”</p><hr/><p>The first three days of Agatha being out of the office feel like a peculiar kind of withdrawal for Rio. </p><p>She keeps finding her eyes drifting to the glass walls of her boss’s office, half-expecting to catch her mid-rant on a call or hammering away at her keyboard. But, of course, the room stays empty.</p><p>The hours drag on, and Rio feels oddly useless since Jen’s getting most of the calls and direct orders from their boss, who seems to be ignoring her again on purpose. Rio hates that all she can do is stupidly perk up every time she overhears a “Yes, Agatha. I’ll get to it,” or an “Okay, Agatha. I’ll let them know.”</p><p>The fifth day drags on like the rest, but Rio snaps out of her funk when she hears Jen sneezing, sniffling, and coughing nonstop while juggling papers and phone calls. At one point, unable to take the awful sounds anymore, Rio hands her a tissue. “How’s that cold holding up?” she asks.</p><p>Jen snorts. “Like I’m already dead.” She drags her hands to her face. “God, I can’t afford to be sick. Especially now. There’s still so much to get done here, and Agatha expects...” She trails off as another sneeze interrupts her. Rio hands her the whole box of tissues. “Thanks,” Jen mutters, wiping her nose.</p><p>“Why don’t you just take the day off?” Rio says, eyeing Jen, who looks like she’s one sneeze away from collapsing. “Tell Agatha you’re sick, and have her call me for anything she needs.” It’s not like Rio really misses hearing Agatha’s voice, but she’s genuinely worried about Jen.</p><p>Jen seems to consider it but then shakes her head. “No. She’d kill me if I took a day off. She specifically told me to keep things running here while she’s gone. So, I’m not sick. I’m fine. Absolutely fine.”</p><p>Turns out Jen hasn’t been fine at all when she calls Rio around 6 pm on a Saturday, saying she’s at the hospital after passing out while grabbing coffee at a café below her apartment.</p><p>“Jesus, for real? What hospital are you at? Do you have someone with you? Do you want me to come?” Rio says into the phone, already pushing herself up from the couch.</p><p>“Charmed, but no. I’m fine now. Nurses are taking care of me,” Jen says from the other line. “And trust me, I wouldn’t be calling if what I’m about to tell you wasn’t important. Look, this is kind of embarrassing, but I need you to do me a favor.”</p><p>“Okay, just tell me what’s up,” Rio says, not sure what to expect next.</p><p>“I know it’s a Saturday, but I need you to go to the office right now and grab something for me. It’s a black envelope in one of my drawers. Should be easy to find. I keep my drawers pretty organized, and it’s probably the only envelope with a label on it. So don’t touch anything else,” Jen says, then starts coughing, making Rio pull the phone away from her ear at how rough she sounds.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re okay? Is there anyone with you besides the nurses? I can send a friend over if you want someone to keep an eye on you.”</p><p>Jen coughs again. “No, I don’t need your friend, and I don’t need a babysitter. What I <em> do </em> need is for that envelope to get to Agatha in an hour, or I’m dead.”</p><p>“Wait, what? What do you mean get it to Agatha?”</p><p>“Rio, you’re delivering the envelope to Jersey. Were you even listening?” Jen snaps and Rio instantly freezes. “There’s a car waiting at the office,” Jen continues over the phone. “You have to drive it yourself because none of the company drivers are available on a damn weekend. Now I have to go. They’re poking me with something again, taking more blood or whatever. You’ve got one hour, Rio, so move!”</p><p>The call dies before she can even process everything. “Seriously?” she mutters, staring down at herself in boxers and a loose tank. She practically bolts to her room, yanks on the first pair of black jeans she can find, grabs a white button-up, and throws on her oversized Colorado hoodie, because of course it’s starting to get fucking cold outside.</p><p>She catches her reflection in the mirror and groans. </p><p>If she’d known she’d be driving to freaking New Jersey to see Agatha today, she might’ve at least tried to look halfway decent. But it’s too late to dig through her closet now, so she throws on her shoes, grabs her bag, storms outside, and immediately flags down a cab.</p><p>It takes about fifteen minutes before she reaches the office, grabs the envelope from one of Jen’s drawers, skips the elevator, races down the stairs, jumps into one of the company cars in the basement, and pulls out into traffic. </p><p>More than an hour, one gas stop, and a flat tire later, Rio’s nerves are fraying by the mile. Her eyes keep darting between the road and the blue arrow inching closer to the drop-off point Jen had texted her.</p><p>By the time she finally turns into the gated neighborhood on the lakefront fringe of Morris County, the sky has already faded into a deep blue. She rolls to a stop in front of a massive mansion of white stone and glass, with clean lines and perfectly groomed hedges. The driveway alone could host a block party. And there’s a fountain. Of course there’s a fountain.</p><p>Rio puts the car in park and just stares. “Jesus Christ,” she mumbles, eyes wide at the house.</p><p>Suddenly, she feels entirely out of place. Of all the days she could have shown up here, of course it had to be the actual wedding day. And she appears like she just crawled out of a subway grate, even if she technically showered this morning and is squeaky clean.</p><p>She immediately tugs off her hoodie, chuntering a curse under her breath, and tries to smooth out the creases on her button-up. It’s a lost cause, but she does it anyway. Then she grabs the envelope from the passenger seat, braces herself, and steps out of the car.</p><p>The house is flanked by rows of shiny, expensive-looking cars. From the front lawn, she can see a giant white tent out back, with music and chatter spilling over the hedges. </p><p>She heads toward the noise, clutching the envelope she’s meant to deliver. The backyard is almost crowded with people talking too loudly, laughing too hard, and already tipsy on overpriced champagne. A waiter with a tray of tiny hors d’oeuvres nearly bumps into her as he maneuvers through the crowd.</p><p>“Oh, excuse me, dear,” an older woman with diamonds stacked on her wrist stops Rio, holding out her empty glass. “Would you mind getting me one of those cucumber cocktails? I’m parched, and I can’t seem to find any help around.” </p><p>Rio blinks. “I, uh, I don’t—”</p><p>The woman’s polite smile falters at her mumbling, the corners of her eyes wrinkling as she gives Rio a meticulous look from head to toe. Rio follows the woman’s gaze to her own black jeans, untucked button-up, and scuffed sneakers. Then she looks around at the waitstaff gliding past them in spotless white shirts and matching black trousers.</p><p>But before she can even try to explain, someone behind them speaks up. </p><p>“What seems to be the problem here?”</p><p>Rio turns around and immediately stiffens at the sight of Evanora Harkness standing in front of her, posture impeccable, dressed in an elegant pale blue dress that undoubtedly costs more than Rio’s monthly rent. The older woman doesn’t recognize her right away and gives her that distant, courteous look that wealthy people save for strangers below their tax bracket.</p><p>Then, just as she feels herself gradually sinking beneath Evanora’s trenchant stare, a familiar voice pulls her back to the surface just in time.</p><p>“Rio?” </p><p>Agatha walks over to them quickly, looking like she’s just seen a ghost. Dressed in a cowl-necked, uranian blue satin dress, she looks every bit the composed socialite, except for how her eyes somehow dart anxiously between Rio and her mother.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”</p><p>Rio regards her for a second, realizing it’s the longest she’s gone without seeing Agatha. She’s almost breathless just looking at her. Dark brown hair swept into a loose bun, soft waves framing her face. But it’s her blue eyes that hold Rio still. Wide. Surprised. Maybe even a little alarmed. Agatha clearly wasn’t expecting to see her here. That much is obvious.</p><p>Rio opens her mouth. “Jen sent me. She said you needed this—” </p><p>But before she can finish, Agatha grabs her firmly by the arm.</p><p>“Excuse us, Mother. Mrs. Crawley,” she says, wearing the tightest smile imaginable. “I need to speak with my assistant.” Then she turns on her heel and pulls Rio away from the gathering and out to the front lawn before either woman can get a word in.</p><p>“Why are you here? Where the hell is Jen?” Agatha scowls, letting go of Rio like she just realized she was holding something she hadn’t meant to. Rio merely blinks at her, clearly taken aback by the cold reception. Agatha didn’t even bother to ask how the trip was.</p><p>“Jen’s at the hospital. She’s been working sick since Monday and passed out earlier, but she says she’s fine now. Anyway, she said you needed this, so I drove it over.” She hands Agatha the envelope.</p><p>“You drove all the way here? By yourself?”</p><p>“There was no one available to take me.”</p><p>Agatha takes the envelope, frowning as she looks off to the side. </p><p>“Jen shouldn’t have sent you,” she murmurs, almost to herself, but Rio still hears it.</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>Instead of answering, Agatha holds out her hand. “Give me your phone.”</p><p>Rio hesitates. “Why?”</p><p>“Just give it to me.”</p><p>She hands it over, and Agatha types something in before giving it back. “That’s the address of the hotel I’m staying at. Go there, give them my name, and they’ll take care of everything. You’ll get a room across from mine. Stay there tonight and head back tomorrow.”</p><p>“But it’s still early. I can make the drive—”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says firmly. “It’s late. I’m not letting you drive back alone.”</p><p>Rio tries her best not to blush in front of her boss, but fails the moment she feels her cheeks start to warm. The butterflies in her stomach aren’t helping either. </p><p>“Wait,” she realizes, frowning a little. “You’re staying at a hotel? Not here?” She jerks her thumb at the massive house behind them. The place probably has ten bedrooms, at least, Rio thinks.</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “You really think I’d stay in that house for a whole week? I’d rather sleep on the street.”</p><p>Finally, she turns back to Rio, and for a second, she could swear Agatha’s blue eyes are saying she misses her too. Or maybe that’s just the whiplash from the sudden trip talking, and she’s just imagining it.</p><p>“Now go,” Agatha adds, brushing down her dress. “I still have to scream at the newlyweds to hurry up and consummate their marriage right in front of this whole Catholic freak show so we can all finally be put out of our misery.”</p><p>Rio snorts, shaking her head as Agatha starts walking away. But something tugs at her, something she hasn’t said yet. “Wait. Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s halfway across the lawn when she turns around, already looking annoyed again. “What?”</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath and stuffs her hands in her pockets so Agatha doesn’t see they’re slightly shaking. Then she says what’s been on her mind since the moment she laid eyes on her earlier.</p><p>“You look really pretty.”</p><p>Agatha sort of freezes, then lifts an eyebrow. “Pretty?” she repeats, like it’s an understatement.</p><p>Rio smiles shyly and gives a small shake of her head. </p><p>“Beautiful,” she corrects herself. “You look really beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips part slightly. Her cheeks turn a soft pink. She opens her mouth like she’s about to say something, but doesn’t. Instead, she nods once, turns around, and walks back into the party.</p><hr/><p>Rio peers at the clock on the wall. It’s already past midnight when she finally switches off the TV, realizing she hadn’t really been watching it anyway. </p><p>She’s in nothing but her button-up and boxers, planning to sleep in them since she didn’t bring any clothes. Maybe next time she should pack extra for unexpected trips like this. </p><p>Her eyes then drift toward the door, wondering if Agatha’s already back and in the room across the hall.</p><p>Rio considers texting her boss to ask if she’s back, but that feels kind of unprofessional, doesn’t it? Then again, the line between professional and not has gotten pretty blurry lately. So really, what’s the harm? </p><p>Still, she hesitates. What would Agatha even think? What would Rio even say? <em> “Hey, are you back yet?” </em>What is she, her needy girlfriend? Jesus. Rio groans and tosses her phone into the pillows.</p><p>Perhaps it’s just the high from seeing Agatha again after a few days apart. It will pass eventually. </p><p>So, like the professional grownup she’s supposed to be, one who has no idea what to do with the growing feelings she has for her boss, Rio shoves the thoughts aside, crawls into bed, and forces herself to sleep.</p><p>She manages maybe an hour of sleep before she is jolted awake by intense, heavy pounding on her door. Still groggy and with her heart lurching, she scrambles out from under the sheets and opens it.</p><p>“Figured you’d be awake,” Agatha quips, standing in the doorway with two bottles of wine, one empty glass, and of all things, a blunt in her other hand. “Found my old stash in the attic. Probably tastes like shit, since I had this back in college. But this is all I have.”</p><p>Rio just blinks at her, caught somewhere between confused and concerned. </p><p>“Are you gonna make me beg? Let your boss in, Rio.”</p><p>Wordlessly, Rio steps aside, and Agatha walks in as if she owns the place — which, to be fair, she sort of does, given that she’s the one footing the bill. She kicks off her heels with a sweep of her feet and collapses on the bed as if it were her own.</p><p>Rio closes the door behind her, still a little stunned. Agatha already appears to have had a touch too much. Her mascara’s smudged, and now that Rio’s eyes have adjusted, there’s a puffiness to her face she hadn’t noticed before. Had she been crying?</p><p>“Why are you still standing there?” Agatha calls out as she lights the blunt. “Am I supposed to enjoy all this by myself?” She takes a drag, immediately breaks into a violent cough, and makes a face. “God, that’s disgusting.” Still, she takes another hit, then shoots Rio a crooked grin and pats the bed. “Get your ass over here, Vidal. I don’t bite.”</p><p>Rio walks over and sits beside her. Agatha pours her a glass without asking and hands it over.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha exhales through her nose, smoke curling as she leans back. “Why do you always ask that?” Rio just gives her a look. “I’m fine,” she huffs. “This is me being fine. Celebrating it, actually. You should be grateful I decided to let you tag along.” She passes her the blunt.</p><p>Rio hesitates but takes a hit anyway, and immediately coughs like she’s being strangled. </p><p>Agatha laughs. “Told you it was awful.”</p><p>“How much of that bottle have you had?” Rio asks, nodding to the nearly empty wine.</p><p>Agatha looks down at it, counts on her fingers, then lifts four, and adds a thumbs-up for good measure.</p><p>“Somewhere around there.” </p><p>“Jesus, I think you’ve had enough,” Rio says, reaching for it, but Agatha quickly pulls it away.</p><p>“Hey, you’re not the boss of me,” she warns, wagging a finger. “I’m drinking. You’re here. So either join me, or I’ll take all this back to my room and enjoy this on my own.”</p><p>Rio watches Agatha for a second. She doesn’t know what happened at the party or in that big fancy house, but something clearly rattled her. So she sighs, takes another hit then immediately doubles over coughing so hard she nearly spills her wine.</p><p>“I can’t believe with all your money, this is the best you could dig up,” she wheezes.</p><p>Agatha snorts, sinking back against the headboard. “Please. It was last minute. It’s not like I could waltz into my father’s study and start digging through his desk for the good stuff.” </p><p>By the time they’re almost through their second bottle, Rio somehow ends up upside down on the bed, feet near the headboard, lazily toying with Agatha’s toes like a bored cat. She briefly wonders, very stupidly, very suddenly, what Agatha would do if she leaned in and sucked on one.</p><p>Then immediately slaps herself — mentally, probably, though there’s a chance her actual cheek took a hit. Hard to tell at this point. Damn it. She hadn’t expected Agatha’s college weed to even hit this hard. </p><p>Then again, maybe rich people’s weed ages like fine wine and just gets more potent with time.</p><p>Rio has completely lost track of what they've been talking about for the past hour. Maybe it was something about her first molly at Pride when she was seventeen. Or that time she’d gotten chased by a hellhound of a Doberman while covering a student council scandal for their college paper. </p><p>Or when Agatha casually shares how she once punched a politician right in the face after he cornered her and tried to make a move by the bathroom entryway at a fundraiser, back when she was still trying to make a name for herself at Nocturne. Rio, halfway through her wine, had demanded to know the guy’s name, swearing she’ll find him and punch him all over again. But two glasses later, maybe five, maybe six, she ends up mixing up the names and vows vengeance on a completely different guy. </p><p>Agatha had nearly choked on her drink laughing.</p><p>Then, noticing how quiet it’s gotten, Rio lifts her head to check on the other woman, only to find her already watching, like she’s been doing it for the past ten minutes. </p><p>“You know, you should really stop looking at me like that if you’re not planning to tell me what you’re thinking,” she grumbles. “It’s driving me a little crazy.”</p><p>Agatha chuckles, her hair now loose in soft waves from the bun it had been in earlier. She crawls over and stretches out on her stomach beside Rio, resting her head on her arms. </p><p>“<em> You </em> drive me crazy,” she says, like it’s the simplest truth in the world. Rio, brain still fogged from the wine and weed, can’t even come up with a comeback before she adds, “Because you don’t know how to keep your mouth shut.”</p><p>Silence falls as Agatha’s eyes search Rio’s like they’re flipping through pages only she can read. </p><p>“Has anyone ever told you how much of a conundrum you are?” she murmurs, her finger lazily tracing the slope of Rio’s nose. Her mind, clearly floating somewhere a few feet above the bed.</p><p>“No. And I’m pretty sure most people I know now don’t even use that word anymore,” Rio mumbles, her eyelids drooping from the high, but she keeps them open, stubbornly memorizing Agatha’s face.</p><p>For a moment, there’s nothing but the sound of the night outside the hotel window. Then Agatha’s hand stills and moves to cup Rio’s cheek, her thumb gently brushing her skin.</p><p>“Well, you are, Rio Vidal,” she says, like it just slipped out of her. “You’re a conundrum. <em> My </em> conundrum.”</p><p>The weed might be fogging up Rio’s brain too much for her to fully process what Agatha is saying — or how she’s slowly leaning in, closing the small space between them. Rio’s eyes almost flutter shut, but she forces them open, holding on with everything she’s got for whatever’s about to happen.</p><p>And then, like the fog slowly lifting, Agatha moves closer and simply presses her lips to hers, soft and light as a breath.</p><p>And just as quickly, it’s over.</p><p>Agatha gradually pulls away, rolls onto her back, and lets out a soft yawn, as if nothing earth-shattering just happened to Rio. “You wouldn’t mind if I closed my eyes for a bit?” she mumbles, already halfway there before Rio can answer.</p><p>Rio, still caught in her head over what just happened, freezes like she’s in some kind of trance. Her brain keeps looping the fact that her boss, Agatha Harkness, of all people, just kissed her. Well, technically, it still counts as a kiss, right? Even if it was barely more than Agatha pressing her lips to hers.</p><p>But instead of overthinking what had just transpired, all of Rio’s uncertainties dissipate the second she hears a few soft snores from the woman next to her. And she can’t help but smile.</p><p>She watches as Agatha rolls onto her side, the hem of her satin dress riding up just enough to reveal the long lines of her legs. Carefully, Rio tugs it back down, reaches for the blanket, and drapes it gently over her. She lingers in the moment a minute longer, brushing a strand of hair off Agatha’s face.</p><p>“The thing about conundrums,” she whispers, “is that you’re mine just as much as I’m yours.”</p><p>Rio wakes to sunlight slipping through the hotel drapes like a slow leak of everything warm and way too bright for her throbbing head. </p><p>Her mouth is dry as hell, and her limbs are tangled in the sheets. She blinks up at the ceiling, needing a second to remember where she is and why the room smells faintly of smoke and a familiar lavender scent. On instinct, her hand reaches across the mattress, only to find the space beside her cold.</p><p>She slowly turns her head, eyes landing on the bedside table. There’s a tall glass of water, a couple of advil, and a folded note scribbled on hotel stationery. Her stomach flips a little before she even reads it.</p><blockquote>
<p>
<em> Left early. Drive safe.  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> — A.H.  </em>
</p>
</blockquote><hr/><p>A good journalist, Rio’s dad used to say, is always three steps ahead of the story. He drilled that into her at a young age, told her it was the one thing she should always carry with her. But somehow, that valuable lesson’s gone out the window now that Agatha’s back to pretending she doesn’t exist.</p><p>Rio should’ve seen it coming. She should’ve known the moment she saw the note. That was Agatha’s way of putting her walls back up, one careful brick at a time. And Rio, of all people, should’ve known better. She should’ve picked up on the signs, seen the change rolling in again, like a storm she’s already been through once before.</p><p>She studied journalism. She’d written articles, chased leads, connected dots from a single thread of truth. And even if she’s not writing anything right now, not in any official capacity, this job she’s had for months doesn’t change the fact that, at her core, she’s still a journalist.</p><p>And journalists are supposed to see what others don’t.</p><p>But when it comes to Agatha — Rio is blind. Not because she isn’t looking, the hell, she is, but because something about that woman scrambles every instinct she’s ever trusted.</p><p>Rio has eyes. But with Agatha, it’s like she doesn’t even know how to use them.</p><p>Days go by since that night in Jersey, and on the surface, everything slides back into the usual routine. At least, that’s what Rio tells herself, and she tries to believe it’s fine. </p><p>Except for all the little things that keep crashing into it, poking holes in Rio’s carefully patched composure, and making her feel like she’s five seconds away from combusting into flames.</p><p>Take Thursday’s run-through, for instance. Nothing out of the ordinary: just her, Jen, some stylists, and a dozen models waiting to be approved or adjusted. </p><p>Except Agatha, for some reason, has suddenly decided that she wants to get handsy. Fixing collars, brushing hair from shoulders, laughing a little too long at some other woman’s joke. Rio nearly snaps her pen in half. Because one, Agatha Harkness never flirts on the job. It’s like a rule. And two, the only time she’s ever even come close is with Rio. </p><p>Another test of Rio’s patience and composure comes when a couple of gorgeous, long-legged editors from Nocturne France and Madrid show up at Agatha’s office, looking like they just walked off a runway. As if that wasn’t enough, Rio even catches wind of a juicy little rumor that Agatha might, or might not, have a history with one of them. Or both. </p><p>Rio tries to shove the thought aside, but it’s impossible when she hears Agatha laughing from her office at whatever those runway-ready editors just said. </p><p>It also doesn’t help that she can hear Agatha slip into French every now and then. Normally, that’d be sexy as hell, have Rio swooning, and undoubtedly turned on. But unfortunately, she’s too upset and way too jealous to even appreciate any of it. And that just makes her even madder.</p><p>The last straw for Rio, because she’s only human, with burning feelings and a heart that can only take so much, comes when a familiar blonde strides confidently toward the office, asking for her boss. The very same woman who, months ago, was supposed to be out of the picture. Or at least, out of Agatha’s.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but Agatha’s in an important meeting right now,” Rio says, stepping in front of the blonde. “And I don’t think we can accommodate you without an appointment.”</p><p>The blonde woman smiles, all pleasure and self-assurance. </p><p>“Oh, I don’t really need an appointment. She’s been expecting me.” </p><p>“She has?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t mean for it to sound as surprised as it does, but it earns her a curious look.</p><p>“Yes, she knows I’m coming today,” the woman replies. “But if she’s still in an important meeting, like you said, I’ll just wait for her in her office.” She’s already moving toward it as she speaks.</p><p>Rio seems to be in a completely different dimension, professionalism-wise, because she immediately steps in to block the way again. “I really don’t think I can let you do that.”</p><p>Jen, buried in paperwork at her desk, looks up and eyes Rio like she’s wondering what the hell she’s doing. Rio’s asking herself the same thing, especially when the blonde starts to look a little annoyed.</p><p>“And why’s that?” she asks. </p><p>“Like I said, no appointment. Agatha doesn’t like other people wandering into her office unannounced.”</p><p>The woman leans in slightly, eyes gleaming with recognition and just the right amount of entitlement. She lowers her voice so only Rio can hear her. “Sugarplum, we both know I’m not just <em> other people </em>.”</p><p>And Rio knows it. Of course she does. Maybe that’s exactly why she’s so hellbent on getting this woman as far away from the building as possible. Six months ago, Rio would’ve slapped herself for acting like this. But before Rio can say anything else, a voice speaks up behind them.</p><p>“Natalia?”</p><p>“Aggie!” The blonde’s face literally lights up as Agatha walks in.</p><p><em> Aggie? </em>Rio fights the urge to visibly flinch. She straightens up, then looks at Agatha like an obedient soldier waiting for orders. “I told her you were in a meeting and she didn’t have an appointment but—” </p><p>“I asked her to come.” The words unexpectedly hit Rio like a dagger to the chest.</p><p>“You asked her to come?” Rio repeats, almost to herself.</p><p>None of them seem to have heard it, except for Agatha, who then turns her attention to the blonde. “I’m sorry I didn’t call you about the meeting. It came up at the last minute. Did you wait long?”</p><p>“Oh, not at all. No worries. I just got here,” the woman says easily. </p><p>Agatha only responds with a polite smile, then turns back to Rio, who, for some reason, is still standing there like she forgot how her legs work. </p><p>“Rio, would you be so kind as to get me a double espresso? Scalding hot. My head’s still spinning from that meeting,” she says, in the most sugar-coated, fake-polite tone Rio’s ever heard from her. Then, with a sweet smile, she turns to the blonde. “And you, sweetheart? Would you like Rio to get you anything too?”</p><p><em> Sweetheart? </em> And the dagger just twists a little deeper.</p><p>“Just a latte,” the woman replies.</p><p>Agatha then shoots Rio a look. “You heard her. A double espresso and a latte. Now, please be so kind and do your job.” With that, she turns and strides toward her office, the blonde following close behind.</p><p>And Rio doesn’t know why she feels like she’s about to burst into flames, or why her eyes suddenly burn with something else. </p><hr/><p>The days that follow are harder for Rio, especially because it’s her own damn decision to shove down whatever feelings she’s been carrying and just act the way Agatha clearly wants her to: indifferent and professional. Agatha wants her to do her job, so that’s exactly what Rio’s doing. </p><p>No stolen glances, if she can help it. No soft smiles that won’t be returned. And most especially, no lingering eye contact. In fact, she’s doing her best not to look Agatha in the eyes whatsoever. </p><p>Because if Rio doesn’t know how to use them around the woman without giving herself away, then maybe it’s better not to use them at all.</p><p>It seemed to have worked, whatever switch flipped, it cooled the wildfire in Rio’s chest, or maybe Agatha just miraculously decided to stop flirting with everything that walked and went back to just lashing out about everyone’s incompetence instead. </p><p>Rio had managed not to take it personally, as long as it wasn’t directed at her. That was the plan, after all. Finish the year, keep her sanity, and eventually move on to a job her heart actually wanted.</p><p>Though lately, her heart’s been a little unclear about what it really wants.</p><p>But just when Rio thinks she might actually survive a few more months of this job, another storm rolls in. </p><p>This time in the form of Evanora Harkness, looking like hell’s personal emissary as she storms into Agatha’s office without so much as a glance at Rio or a nod to Jen, who barely gets out a polite, “Ma’am, I’m not sure if—” before being completely ignored.</p><p>“You ungrateful, insufferable, selfish child!” The office door’s wide open when Evanora slams her palm against Agatha’s desk hard enough to make the glass tremble.</p><p>Rio is already halfway out of her chair, instinctively moving toward the open office when she hears Evanora say, “What do you think you’re doing, huh? You think you can pull something like that and just get away with it?” But before she can even reach the threshold, Agatha is suddenly there, standing in the doorway, like she knew Rio would come.</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha says. And after days of avoiding her eyes, Rio’s heart feels like it’s breaking just from looking into them now. Because the way Agatha’s eyes speak to her is not of warning, but of a plea. </p><p>And that’s what makes her stop.</p><p>Rio’s left with no choice but to stay outside as Agatha shuts the door, cutting off most of the sound. Through the thin frosted glass walls, she can only watch: Evanora’s hand furiously slicing through the air while Agatha stands still, saying nothing. Their voices don’t carry clearly, but Rio doesn’t need to hear the words to know it’s serious. Whatever this is, it’s not just a mother scolding her daughter.</p><p>“Jen, call security,” Rio says, her eyes locked on the heated argument behind the office glass. She tries to keep her voice even and calm, but her hands are already clenched.</p><p>“What?” Jen blinks, clearly just as stunned.</p><p>“I said call security.”</p><p>“But Agatha told us not—”</p><p>“Jen, I said call security. Right fucking now,” Rio snaps, not caring what her coworker might think. Her only priority is getting Agatha the hell away from her vile excuse of a mother. “Please.”</p><p>Though confused by Rio’s loaded reaction, Jen doesn’t argue. She scrambles up, snatches the phone off the receiver, and punches in the number.</p><p>Inside the office, the muffled voices swell like a storm.</p><p>“…don’t talk to me like I’m one of your staff—”</p><p>“...I won’t let you destroy everything I’ve built just to settle a score—”</p><p>“…this is about you dragging someone else into this—”</p><p>“…you really think this protects her?”</p><p>Before Rio can fully piece together the conversation, the security personnel Jen called finally rush in, and without thinking, Rio steps forward and pushes the office door open, as if she’s been dying to do so for the past ten minutes.</p><p>Evanora whips her head toward them, still full of rage.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Mrs. Harkness, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to leave,” Rio says, summoning every ounce of courage she can gather. She glances at Agatha, who meets her eyes with an uncertain kind of relief, along with something else Rio can’t quite name.</p><p>“How dare you call security on me?” Evanora hisses, whipping her attention back to her daughter.</p><p>Agatha straightens. “They’re only here to escort you out. Unless you’d rather I have them physically remove you,” she says, schooling her features into something more unreadable. “Now please go, Mother. You’ve already disrupted enough of my day.”</p><p>Evanora’s mouth twitches, like she’s biting back one last insult, but she holds her tongue. She turns on her heel, but not before her eyes briefly land on Rio. Just for a second, there’s a vestige of recognition before snapping back at Agatha. Whatever she sees, whatever she realizes, it curls at the corner of her mouth in the form of a cold, knowing scoff. Then she walks out, not saying another word.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio asks, keeping her distance, though she doesn’t miss the way Agatha’s shoulders seem to sink the moment Evanora is gone. </p><p>But she doesn’t answer.</p><p>She walks around her desk instead, back turned, one hand pressed against her temple like she’s trying to hold her thoughts together. Then, finally, without turning around. “Why did you do that?”</p><p>Rio freezes. “What?”</p><p>She turns, eyes locked on Rio with a stare that’s almost angry, hurt, and disappointed. “I told you not to interfere.” Her lips are pressed tight, like she’s holding back something else she wants to say. </p><p>“I was just trying to help.” </p><p>“That was none of your business!” The shout is so loud, the glass walls seem to vibrate. </p><p>And in all the time Rio has worked for her, Agatha has never, not even when furious over someone’s incompetence, raised her voice like this. </p><p>Rio stares at her, then looks down at her hands which are shaking even more than they were before she worked up the courage to face Evanora. This is not how she expected the day to go. </p><p>“What was I supposed to do? Sit on my hands while you let your own mother tear you apart?”</p><p>“You were supposed to do your job!” Agatha looks like she’s one second away from throwing Rio out. “Which didn’t include throwing yourself into something you don’t even understand just because you felt like playing a fucking hero!” </p><p>“I wasn’t playing anything!” Rio’s eyes are wide now. “She stormed in here and insulted you. Again, what was I supposed to do? I couldn’t just stand there and let her do all that to you.”</p><p>“It’s not your place to decide how I deal with my own mother,” Agatha says, holding on to what’s left of her composure. “That’s my problem, not yours! You really think making a scene in front of the entire floor makes anything better?”</p><p>“I wasn’t trying to make a scene. I was trying to stop one!” Rio fires back. “She was out of line!”</p><p>“You’re the one who’s out of line!” Agatha’s hands slam on the desk. </p><p>Rio freezes at the words, her chest rising and falling as she tries to speak. </p><p>“Only because I couldn’t just stand there and do nothing.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs, rubbing a hand down her face. “God, you really don’t get it, do you?”</p><p>“Get what?” Rio shoots back. <em> “That I care,” </em>is what she wants to say next, but the words get caught somewhere between her throat and her pride.</p><p>Because the truth is, what she feels for Agatha isn’t just some stupid crush or passing admiration. </p><p>Rio knows it’s something more. Because Agatha, with all her sharp edges and impossible walls, became someone who mattered to her. And that’s the thing. That’s why she couldn’t just stand there and watch someone talk down to her, touch her wrong, or look at her like she was anything less.</p><p>Because Rio cares. So deeply that the only thing running through her mind when Evanora stormed in was the need to protect her. Because somewhere along the way, Agatha stopped being just a job. Because suddenly, when it comes to Agatha, Rio's instinct isn’t just to stand beside her. It’s to stand in front of her.</p><p>“That I give a damn?” she says instead.</p><p>Her boss still seems to understand what she means, and she softens just a little. And Rio instantly feels like the worst person alive for raising her voice, especially with Agatha looking more vulnerable than she’s ever seen her. But the feeling only lasts three seconds.</p><p>“I think it’s clear this arrangement is no longer working.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t move. Doesn’t even breathe. After the heat that just came off both her and Agatha, it’s obvious someone’s hanging by a thread. And judging by the look on Agatha’s face, Rio knows exactly who it is, and pretty soon, everyone on the floor will too.</p><p>“I need someone who knows when to do their job, and when to stay the fuck out of things that don’t concern them. And lately, you’ve been terribly failing at both.”</p><p>Rio wants to scowl, wants to throw the damn hypocrisy back in Agatha’s face, because if anyone’s been crossing lines, it’s her. But she doesn’t. She can’t. She won’t. </p><p>“So, what, you’re firing me now?” she mutters under her breath. </p><p>Her eyes feel glassy, but she doesn’t let the tears fall.</p><p>Agatha slowly walks to her chair and turns it to face the window, instead of looking at Rio. </p><p>Then she calls out, “Jen!” who practically stumbles through the door, eyes wide, and breathing hard. Her eyes jump between Rio and their boss. She must’ve heard enough from outside to know something’s gone very wrong.</p><p>And then with a low, displeased voice from behind the chair. </p><p>“Please escort my former assistant out of my office and inform Human Resources that I will be needing a replacement by tomorrow. As of this moment, Miss Vidal is no longer employed here.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Three days later, Rio finds herself half-melted into the couch, surrounded by a mess that eerily resembles the aftermath of her first real heartbreak back in college. </p><p>She’s in a hoodie she hasn’t washed in a week. Around her are crumpled takeout bags, a teetering tower of Coke cans and Red Bulls, a few half-drunk Budweisers, a spoon stuck in a bowl of what used to be ice cream and is now just sad, milky sludge, and a half-eaten bag of chips. </p><p>She just finished watching Carol for the second time, or maybe the third. Hard to say. Her head hurts. Her stomach feels worse. She’s not sure she’ll ever move again.</p><p>“Jesus, dude,” Alice says as she walks in from work, drops her bag by the door, and takes one look at Rio. “Unemployment really does not look good on you.”</p><p>“I’m thriving,” Rio rasps, not bothering to lift her head.</p><p>Alice crosses the room, plucks the bag of chips off Rio’s stomach, and tosses it onto the coffee table.</p><p>“You’ve been marinating on that couch for days. Tell me you’ve at least packed.”</p><p>“Don’t say that word,” Rio groans into the cushion.</p><p>“I’m serious.” </p><p>“Well, I don’t need to pack much. We’re only going for a couple days. And I’ve got stuff at your place anyway.” She turns her head just enough to look at Alice with one bleary eye. “But are you sure you wanna come? You really don’t have to, you know. I can go by myself. I don’t want you missing that gig on Friday.” She pauses, then smirks a little. “You’ve been talking about debuting that song where you rhyme ‘heartbreak’ with ‘car brakes’ for, like, three weeks.”</p><p>Alice snorts. “Please, that song bangs and you know it. But I can drop it whenever. Also, I’m still figuring out the bridge anyway. Maybe a little hometown misery will help.” She grabs a can off the floor and chucks it in the bin. “Besides, it’s your parents’ anniversary, I’m way overdue for a trip to see my mom, and not to mention, it’s your damn birthday. You really think I’d let you and her celebrate it without me?”</p><p>Rio stares up at the ceiling, blank and unmoving. She’d almost forgotten her birthday. Figures. The universe had really gone all in this week, leaving her jobless, mildly humiliated, and just the right amount of heartbroken to kill her appetite for pretty much everything. What a thoughtful little gift box.</p><p>“Now that you mention it…I don’t even feel like celebrating.”</p><p>Alice snaps her head toward her. “Oh, come on. We always celebrate your birthday.” She studies Rio for a beat, then shoves her legs off the couch and drops down into the cushions. “You’ve been sulking for days, you seriously need a shower, and despite what your mood suggests, the world’s not actually ending. Yet.” She grabs a chip from the coffee table. “There are still jobs out there. Didn’t you say that journo from <em> Sesame Street </em> wanted to see your stuff?”</p><p>“Wall Street,” Rio snorts, but Alice ignores the correction. Whatever. Rio gets the point. “It’s not like I can just send her my stuff out of nowhere. We talked once. I doubt she even remembers me.” She pauses, frowning at nothing. “And even if I did send something, that doesn’t mean I’d land a job. There’s still the whole question of whether my work’s even good enough.” Then another thought hits her, an uglier one, with a familiar name behind it. “And let’s not forget the very real possibility that a particular someone might have already blacklisted me from every publication in New York.” </p><p>It frustrates her that she can’t even bring herself to say <em> her </em> name now.</p><p>Alice looks at her, already knowing who she means. “Come on. You really think your ex-boss would do that? Are you seriously thinking she’d go that far? Is she really <em> that </em> heartless?”</p><p>Rio’s frown deepens. Is Agatha Harkness heartless? </p><p>She wants to believe that. She really does. It’d be easier if it were that simple. But then she thinks about those blue eyes, how they’d soften every time they landed on her, like Rio was someone worth paying attention to. The way Agatha smiled at her dumb jokes, or every time she said something weird just to get a laugh. The way she held her that night, like it actually meant something. If Agatha Harkness is really that heartless…then what the hell was all that?</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio mutters. “And I don’t even care anymore.” She yanks the cushion over her face, her voice muffled. “Now just let me sulk in peace before I make it your problem.”</p><p>“No. I’m done with this. I’m officially drawing the line on day three,” Alice says, standing up and yanking Rio’s arm like she’s trying to haul her out of the underworld. “You need to stop sulking, pack your stuff for tomorrow, and for the love of God, take a shower. I’m not letting you stink up the apartment. Also, email your stuff to that hot journo from Sesame Street or whatever. Worst-case scenario, she doesn’t respond. Big deal. At least you tried.” She waves a hand at the disaster zone around them. “And this? This is not healthy. If Mom hears about any of this, you’re gonna get an earful the entire time we’re back home.”</p><p>Rio lets out a long, miserable groan and smashes her face into a cushion again. Alice pats her leg like she’s consoling a dying animal. Then, slowly, like a corpse reanimating, Rio peels herself off the couch. </p><p>“There we go,” Alice says, hands on her hips like a smug coach. “Look at you. Rising from the ashes.”</p><p>“God, you’re annoying,” Rio grumbles, flipping her off halfheartedly as she shuffles down the hall. “I don’t know why I haven’t smothered you in your sleep yet.”</p><p>“It’s the unbearable love you have for me. I get it.” </p><p>And Alice is not mistaken, because Rio does unbearably love her. In that gloriously dysfunctional, obstinate, sibling way that has her chasing Alice through the mayhem of Penn Station the next morning, running on autopilot, gripping her coffee like it's the only thing keeping her upright. </p><p>Last night, Alice had made her shower, put on clean clothes, even helped her pack, but none of it helped her actually sleep.</p><p>Alice checks the board, then glances over her shoulder. “Alright, I’m gonna go grab the tickets and see if I can find something edible since someone decided we were too depressed for breakfast.” She eyes Rio’s coffee cup. “You good here?”</p><p>Rio simply nods, grateful she doesn’t have to move.</p><p>“Uh-huh. Just try not to pass out while I’m gone,” Alice points at her before disappearing into the crowd.</p><p>Rio stays where she is, cradling the last of her lukewarm coffee. </p><p>She’s just about to get up and toss the cup in a nearby trash bin when her phone starts ringing.</p><p>“She wants you back,” Jen states the second Rio picks up and can’t even be bothered with a greeting.</p><p>A dry, incredulous scoff immediately escapes Rio. “I’m sorry, she wants <em> what </em> now?”</p><p>“She already fired three writers in the bullpen,” Jen goes on, like she’s been waiting to drop this and fully expected Rio’s reaction. “Then another one yesterday, an editor this morning, and probably someone else after lunch. That’s five or six people in under four days. And the issue goes to print next week.” </p><p>Rio squints at her phone. “And what exactly does that have to do with me?”</p><p>“You need a job,” Jen says slowly, like Rio’s the one not connecting the dots. Rio bites her tongue, resisting the urge to snap <em> “and whose fault is that?” </em>but her former coworker just keeps going. “The magazine’s underwater right now, staff-wise. Half the applicants can’t even properly string a sentence together. She needs someone who actually knows what the hell they’re doing.”</p><p>“Un-fucking-believable.” </p><p>People pass by on either side of Rio, hauling luggage, yelling over announcements, but she just stands there, wide awake now, and furious.</p><p>“So?” Jen asks. “Are you interested?”</p><p>“In working for Agatha Harkness again?” Rio scoffs. “She just fired me last week, remember?”</p><p>“And since then, she’s been clearing house. You’re not the only one. Now do you want the job or not?”</p><p>Rio pinches the bridge of her nose. “Again, Jen. She <em> fired </em> me.”</p><p>“I know that. I was there,” Jen snaps, irritated now. “But is that a yes or a no?”</p><p>Rio finally tosses her coffee into the trash with more force than necessary. </p><p>“I don’t know what Agatha thinks she’s doing, but—” </p><p>“She wants you in the pit. Am I not being clear?” Jen cuts in. “She wants you back here as soon as possible. Said she needs someone she can actually rely on to do the job. And she told me to tell you…it comes with the thing you’ve been chasing since day one.”</p><p>“What? Is she offering me a pony?” </p><p>“Rio, she’s offering you a shot to actually write,” Jen declares, clearly starting to lose her patience.</p><p>Rio stops to think, just for a second. Then, like a punch to the gut, she remembers Agatha’s face, how she looked at her with anger and disappointment. The way she raised her voice. The way she dismissed her like she was nothing more than an easily replaceable employee.</p><p>“No. You can tell her I said no,” Rio says flatly. “If she thinks dangling a shiny little carrot is enough to get me crawling back and kissing the ground she walks on, she’s out of her damn mind.”</p><p>“She knew you’d say no at first.”</p><p>“At first?” Rio barks out a bitter laugh. “No, Jen. I’m saying no completely.”</p><p>Jen sighs, like Rio’s the one being unreasonable. And Rio thinks, not for the first time, that she and Agatha really are a perfect match as boss and assistant. </p><p>“Alright, what’s going on with you? You used to talk my ear off about how badly you wanted to write. You literally lit up every time Agatha asked your take on a piece. And now you’re just…what? Dropping it? She’s handing you an actual shot here, Rio.” </p><p>Rio stares out at the crowd, teeth clenched, like she’s trying to freeze whatever is swelling up in her chest. Then she groans, mostly at herself, for even bothering to argue with Jennifer Kale of all people. </p><p>“Fine. Then riddle me this,” she muses. “Why does she really want me back?”</p><p>“She said you'd ask that too, by the way.”</p><p>Rio resists the urge to roll her eyes. “And?” </p><p>“She said it’s a professional decision,” Jen supplies, and Rio pretends it didn’t hurt something in her. “Now, should I tell HR to start drafting you a new contract?” </p><p>Rio lets out a breath and stares at the floor. “No. Tell your boss I don’t sit back down in burned chairs.”</p><p>“Fine. Your call. I could rattle off a dozen writers who’d sell a kidney for this kind of shot. But if clinging to your pride makes it easier to pretend this isn’t exactly what you want, even when it’s clear as day to someone like me, who barely even cares about you, then go ahead.” </p><p>Rio sends out an impatient sigh. “You’re missing the whole damn point, Jen,” she scowls. “If Agatha Harkness wants me back, she can get off her high horse and ask me herself. And make damn sure she hears that, word for word.” She finishes the call with a quick jab of her finger.</p><hr/><p>Delaware has always felt the want to breathe again after keeping it in for too long. The second they cross state lines, it’s as if the world finally takes its foot off the gas. </p><p>It’s definitely much calmer here. </p><p>Less traffic, fewer people, less bullshit. Just open roads, rows of trees, and that unique serenity that only little towns like Hockessin seem to hold. The sort that allows Rio to hear her own thoughts.</p><p>Her old neighborhood looks pretty much the same. The houses are still spread out, each with a big, slightly uneven yard. Mailboxes leaning just a bit. Porch swings creaking in the breeze. A kid’s bike lying on the grass, like someone ran in for dinner and forgot all about it.</p><p>Their cab slows as it rolls past Mr. Miller’s house, and Rio can’t help but smile a little. Same white picket fence. Same crooked birdhouse hanging on by one stubborn nail. The same dented mailbox from when she crashed her bike at five. There’s even a pile of dry leaves by the gate that looks a lot like the one she and Alice accidentally set on fire.</p><p>She can almost hear herself telling that story. Almost hears Agatha laughing at it. Then she catches herself and shakes the thought off. She’s home to clear her head, not let that woman’s voice take up space again.</p><p>The cab pulls up in front of a familiar house, and there on the porch is Lorna, waving them in with both arms. “Well, if it isn’t my two city girls,” she grins, stepping down to meet them. “Look at you, skin and bones. What the hell have you been eating in New York?”</p><p>Alice groans as she steps out, grabbing her backpack. </p><p>“Mom, come on. We talked about this. You can’t say stuff like that anymore.”</p><p>“What? I’m just calling it like I see it,” Lorna huffs, pressing a kiss to her temple and ruffling her hair like she’s still five. Then she turns to Rio, arms already open. “And you, young lady. Have you even been sleeping? Or is that boss you once told me about still being a pain in the ass?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond right away. She just shakes her head and steps into the hug, letting herself be squeezed tight. Lorna still has no idea she got fired, and Rio’s not about to start now. There’s no point in making it someone else’s burden. “I missed you too,” she mumbles into her shoulder instead.</p><p>“Welcome home, little bao,” Lorna says gently. She seems to sense Rio’s holding something back but lets it slide. “Now come in, both of you. I’ve got pot roast in the oven and lemon pie on the counter.”</p><p>“Now that is the best thing I’ve heard all week,” Alice says, pushing the door open.</p><p>“Well, good. Just wash your hands first. God knows what you touched in that city.” </p><p>Dinner rolls around, and soon the kitchen fills with the sound of clinking plates, clattering silverware, and Lorna’s running commentary about the neighbors, local politics, and how the new ‘mailman’ has absolutely no idea where to leave the packages. </p><p>Alice fires back with her usual dry sarcasm, tossing in updates from work, band drama, run-ins with drunk regulars, and a bald guy named Rick who keeps texting her at 2 am asking if she’s “still up for that jam session.”</p><p>Rio smiles and nods along, nudging chunks of pot roast around her plate. </p><p>But the truth is, she’s barely catching anything. </p><p>Her phone buzzes again in her lap, for the sixth time now, and she just presses the mute button without looking up. She already knows who it is. Has that tight feeling in her stomach about it. And she’s not in the mood to even hear that voice tonight. </p><p>It’s only hours later, after the dishes have been cleared and Lorna and Alice have retreated to their rooms, that Rio steps out of the shower in a large shirt and boxers, her damp hair sticking to the back of her neck, and a towel hanging loose over her shoulders. The hallway light is dim, and the floor creaks beneath her bare feet as she heads toward the spare room.</p><p>It’s the same room she and Alice used to crash in during summer breaks, the one that eventually became hers after her mom died and Lorna took her in like family. Two twin beds pushed together, faded posters still taped to the walls, and a corkboard with a few lonely pushpins left behind. Some of her old books still sit on the shelf, and she makes a mental note to flip through a few while she’s here.</p><p>Rio walks over to the window and pulls the curtain aside. Across the street sits their old house. Same porch swing, though now it has a pair of mismatched cushions. Same big tree out front, still leaning slightly to the left. The shrubs appear different, trimmed in a way her mom would’ve complained about. Warm yellow light spills from the windows, like the place hasn’t changed at all, even though it has.</p><p>She used to swear she’d never sell it. But in the end, it helped her get through college without drowning in student debt. It had been a hard decision, but Lorna once told her that it was just a house. </p><p>That her parents, the love, the memories, the real parts of home, were what she carried with her, no matter where she went.</p><p>Now there’s a new family living there. A mom, a dad, twin girls who leave their pink bikes scattered across the lawn, and a dog that barks every morning at six. Lorna used to say it drove her nuts, but like everyone else on the block, she eventually got used to it.</p><p>It doesn’t hurt to look at their old house, not exactly. But it’s strange, seeing someone else living in it. </p><p>The place used to be where her mom and dad drank coffee on Sunday mornings. Where she scraped her knees, did homework at the kitchen table, blew out candles year after year.</p><p>It still looks like home. Even if it isn’t hers anymore.</p><p>She’s just about to set an alarm for her visit to the cemetery tomorrow when her phone buzzes again. Rio groans, grabs it off the nightstand, and finally answers, more out of pure irritation than anything else.</p><p>“What the hell do you even want? I already said no. Is that really so hard to understand?”</p><p>There’s a beat of silence on the other end, but it doesn’t cool the blood still boiling in Rio’s veins. Does Agatha even know how to leave things alone? </p><p>Then a familiar voice cuts through, and for a split second, Rio freezes.</p><p>“Okay, not the greeting I was expecting but—”</p><p>“Hela?”</p><p>“Glad to know that outburst wasn’t meant for me,” Hela says, a little amused. “I’ve been trying to reach you, but you keep dropping my calls. Is everything okay over there?”</p><p>“That was you? Shit, I’m so sorry. I really thought you were someone else.” Rio sighs, dragging a hand down her face. “Wait, you’ve been calling me? Did you get a chance to read the stuff I sent?”</p><p>“I did. Haven’t finished all of it yet, but from what I’ve read? It’s good. Actually, kind of impressive.”</p><p>“Wait, seriously?”</p><p>“Seriously,” Hela affirms, and for once she’s not teasing, especially with her voice sounding all business. “If you’re up for it, I can put you in touch with my editor. He’s tough but he knows good work when he sees it. I can arrange an interview as early as tomorrow, if that works for you.”</p><p>Rio flops back on the bed, towel still draped over her shoulders, eyes fixed on the ceiling. </p><p>“Uh...yeah, of course. That sounds great. I’d really love that. It’s just that I’m not in the city right now. I’m home for a bit. Well, not home-home, but back in Delaware. Visiting family. I’ll be here until Sunday, so if the interview could be after that, I’d be all in.”</p><p>“Delaware?” Hela repeats, as if she’s trying to picture what kind of place could’ve possibly raised Rio.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio says, sitting up a bit straighter.</p><p>“Alright, so Monday then,” Hela says, the tiniest smirk in her voice. “And I’m guessing the fact you finally sent those files, and are actually saying yes, means you’ve officially broken free from Agatha’s clutches?” </p><p>Rio exhales. “It’s a long story, but yeah. That’s why I’m free on Monday.”</p><p>“Glad to hear it,” Hela says. “Like I said, working with Agatha Harkness was never going to be a long-term arrangement. I’m not sure how you made your exit, but what matters is that you did. I’m looking forward to working with you, Rio. See you Monday.” </p><p>The call ends before Rio can say anything else. She sets her phone on the nightstand, hair still damp, and lies back, staring at the ceiling with an unsure smile. But then, just like that, Agatha’s face pops into her head again. She frowns, swings her legs off the bed, and crosses the room to hang her towel on the hook behind the door.</p><hr/><p>The next morning, as if the neighbor’s dog barking across the street was her personal alarm clock, Rio wakes up early and decides to visit the cemetery alone. She walks out to the front yard, picks a bunch of azaleas from one of Lorna’s bushes, and wraps them in a plain brown paper. She does not ask Alice or Lorna to join her, and they are both aware that this is something Rio prefers to do on her own.</p><p>The cemetery’s nearly empty when Rio gets there. Just the groundskeeper trimming the grass, birds calling from the trees, and the soft crunch of gravel under her sneakers. </p><p>She spots the headstone right away, kneels down, and places the azaleas gently at its base. Then she brushes off a few dry leaves and rests her hand on the cool marble.</p><p>“Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.” </p><p>She sits cross-legged on the grass beside them, letting the silence settle around her. </p><p>For a while, she doesn’t say anything else. She just sits there, fingers running lightly over her parents’ names. Eventually, she starts talking. About New York. About her job, or what used to be her job. About how messed up things have been lately. And about this woman, the one at the center of it all, the one she can’t seem to stop thinking about no matter how hard she tries.</p><p>She tells them she misses them. That some days still feel heavier than others. But that she’s still doing okay, well, mostly okay, despite getting fired, and despite the mess of emotions that came with being fired by the woman she kind of likes. Or liked. Or whatever the right word is. Then she tells them about their old house, how one of the twins living there now waved at her on her way over.</p><p>It’s probably been over three hours when Rio finally pushes herself to stand. Her knees crack a little, and she lets out a soft laugh, muttering that she must be getting old, then remembers her birthday tomorrow. She brushes the dirt off her jeans, gives the headstone one last look, and walks back down the path. </p><p>It’s a bit of a walk to town, but Rio doesn’t mind. </p><p>She shoves her hands in her pockets and just keeps going, watching life happen around her. </p><p>The sun’s up, but some gray clouds are rolling in, and the air smells like it might rain soon. </p><p>The streets are slow. People are walking their dogs or sitting outside the town’s only decent coffee shop with their drinks. Kids zoom past on bikes. She walks by the familiar diner, the hardware store, and the old bakery that used to hand out free cookies to her and Alice when they were little. </p><p>She doesn’t even notice how far she’s gone until her legs start to ache.</p><p>That’s when she hears a car slow down behind her. A familiar black one. Too shiny, too sleek to belong to anyone from around here. She takes one look over her shoulder, just to confirm, then snaps her head forward with a sigh as the window rolls down.</p><p>“Get in the car,” Agatha says, and just the tone of it makes Rio instantly angry.</p><p>She doesn’t stop walking. “What the hell are you doing here?” </p><p>“I’m not here to argue.” </p><p>“Well, that’s too bad,” Rio mutters, still moving. “Because I’m very much in the mood.”</p><p>Agatha leans closer to the window. “Can you just get in?”</p><p>“And why would I do that?” Rio says, not even glancing at her.</p><p>“Rio.” </p><p>“No. No way.” </p><p>“I’m a very busy woman. Can we not do this in the middle of the street?”</p><p>“Then don’t.” Rio shrugs, eyes flat. “Nobody asked you to.”</p><p>“You told Jen I should ask you myself.” </p><p>“Yeah, well, clearly Jen didn’t catch the sarcasm.”</p><p>“But now I’m here. So can we not do this out in the open? Just get in the car.”</p><p>Rio scoffs. “Again, why would I ever get in a car with you? You’re not my boss anymore. So why don’t you do us both a favor and drive back to whatever corner of hell you crawled out of.”</p><p>She hears Agatha sigh through gritted teeth. “Rio, I swear to God, I’m not getting out of this stupid car to chase you in my Jimmy Choos! Get in, or I’ll have Javier drag your ass inside!” </p><p>Rio stops walking the second Agatha raises her voice, and she hates how fast it still works on her. With a groan, she turns around, yanks the door open, and slides into the seat beside her, stiff as stone. She doesn’t even look at Javier in the front seat. Just folds her arms and stares hard out the window.</p><p>Agatha’s lavender perfume hits her first, like a slap and a hug all at once. It’s ridiculous how familiar it is. Annoying, too, because of course it still gets to her. The real betrayal, though, is that she actually missed it. Stupid, backstabbing, emotionally-compromised nose.</p><p>“Whatever you came here to say, just say it. I’ve got better places to be.”</p><p>“In this town?” Agatha says, one brow lifting, almost amused.</p><p>Rio glares. “Are you seriously mocking me right now?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head right away. </p><p>“No, I didn’t mean it like that. I just meant, where else would you even wanna be?”</p><p>“Obviously, literally anywhere but here with you.”</p><p>A heavy silence settles between them.</p><p>“Why won’t you take the job?” Agatha finally asks.</p><p>Rio lets out a dry, bitter laugh. “You’re seriously asking me that?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio still doesn’t look at her. “For someone so smart, it’s impressive how clueless you are, or how good you are at pretending to be. Why the hell would I want to work again for the woman who fired me — for sticking up for her, no less. To her bitch of a mother.”</p><p>“I meant what I said. It wasn’t your place to defend me.”</p><p>“Well, fuck me then. Sorry for actually caring, I guess.” It slips out too fast, and Rio clears her throat right after, like the noise might cover up the fact that it was too honest.</p><p>“Don’t you want to write?” Agatha asks, obviously trying to steer the conversation somewhere safer.</p><p>“Of course I do.”</p><p>“Then what exactly are we arguing about? I’m offering you a job that lets you do just that.”</p><p>“You’re offering me a job right after firing me. Humiliating me. I mean, who does that?”</p><p>“Can we not go in circles? Yes, I fired you. But I didn’t humiliate you. I would never do that—” Agatha pauses, recalibrates. “It was because you overstepped. Whether you admit it or not, it wasn’t your place.”</p><p>“So what is this, then?” Rio says. “Some weird power move? A slow-burn punishment? I overstepped, so now you’re offering me a job just to prove I was wrong?”</p><p>“You really think that’s how my mind works?”</p><p>“Beats me how your mind works!” Then their eyes finally meet. And in that pause, Rio sees the way Agatha’s hurt sits just beneath the surface. It catches her off guard and softens her, just a little.</p><p>“You’re a conundrum,” she adds, not with heat this time, but with something closer to the truth.</p><p>Agatha lets out a quiet breath at the familiar word, and her eyes drop to her lap. </p><p>“Well, you seem to share the same affliction.” </p><p>Another stretch of silence settles between them, barely inches apart, until a pointed throat-clearing from the driver’s seat snaps them both out of it. </p><p>“I can’t believe you dragged Javier all the way out here for this,” Rio scoffs, turning back to the window. “Hope she’s paying you well, man.” Javier doesn’t say a word. Just keeps his eyes on the road.</p><p>Agatha straightens in her seat, ignoring the jab.</p><p>“The job is on the table. It’s yours. Whether you take it or not, it’s your call. Do whatever you want with it.”</p><p>Rio hesitates, then asks, “Did you regret it?” The question had been sitting in her head since Jen called yesterday and said Agatha wanted her back. “Firing me that day?”</p><p>Agatha pauses, thinking it over. Then she shakes her head. </p><p>“I made that decision for a reason. You crossed a line, and while your intentions may have been good, I didn’t ask to be defended. I am fully capable of doing that on my own.”</p><p>Rio fixes her with a glare. “You dismissed me out of your office like I didn’t matter. Like I was just another name on your payroll, someone you could easily replace.”</p><p>“You are not just another name,” Agatha meets her eyes again. “I was angry, yes. Furious, even. But that doesn’t mean I ever saw you as disposable. I don’t—” She exhales, the words catching for a beat, then adds instead, “I’d never treat you like that.”</p><p>“You actually believe that?”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha says simply.</p><p>Rio licks her lips, nerves crawling up her throat, but she asks anyway. “And what about us? What happens to us if I do take the job and work for you again?”</p><p>Agatha blinks, as if robbed of her armor. “Us?” And Rio notices something in her face that she can’t quite recognize, but it makes her chest squeeze nonetheless. “You’d be writing for the magazine. I’d be the one signing your paycheck. What kind of ‘us’ do you think that leaves room for?”</p><p>“So that’s it?” Rio presses, fidgeting with her sleeves. “Like none of it happened? You firing me...and everything else before that?” </p><p>She doesn’t say the rest out loud, but it’s loud in her head: their talks, that almost-kiss or whatever it was, the way Agatha looked at her like she wasn’t just some random person in her office. The way Rio noticed it and missed her when she wasn’t there. Was it all just going to stay inside her head? Was that really it?</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth like she’s about to say something else. Her nostrils flare. Then, calmly, like she’s locking it all away, she says, “It’s easier that way.”</p><p>“Right. That’s what I thought,” Rio mumbles. She lets out a long sigh. Javier glances at them in the rearview mirror, and Rio taps the window. “Puedes parar aquí, Javier. Por favor.” </p><p>“What?” Agatha snaps, a hit of panic and disappointment breaking through as the car slows to the curb. Suddenly, she understands what Rio just said. “You can’t just take off without—”</p><p>“I can, Agatha,” Rio cuts her off, pushing the door open. “And I’m not taking the job.”</p><p>Before her former boss can say another word, Rio slips out into the overcast day. </p><p>She hears Agatha calling after her, but she doesn’t look back. She rounds the corner without slowing down, letting the shouts fade until all that’s left is the pounding of her own heartbeat in her ears.</p><p>Later that night, the same black car sits parked down the block, barely visible through sheets of heavy rain and the low rumble of distant thunder. Lorna asks, just in passing, who it might be, and Rio shrugs, saying it’s probably just someone visiting the neighbors. </p><p>In her room hours later, Rio stands by the window, arms crossed, watching the car idling beneath the streetlight. She wonders how long Agatha plans to keep this up, whatever this is. </p><p>And though she hates herself for it, she also wonders how Agatha’s holding up, especially with the rain and thunder that haven’t let up all night. </p><p>With a tired sigh, she switches off the light and steps away. When she peeks out again a few minutes later, the street is empty.</p><hr/><p>The next morning, Rio wakes up early again. </p><p>Something about being home always pulls her out of bed with the sun. She throws on a hoodie, tightens her sneakers, and heads out for a run. Just a couple of laps around the block, enough to get her blood moving and clear her head a little. </p><p>It’s become a bit of a tradition by now, starting her birthday with a run, like it might help set the tone for the rest of the day.</p><p>By the time Rio makes her way back to Alice’s place, she’s sweating and already preparing herself for the usual breakfast chatter with Lorna, who’s probably up by now, halfway through flipping pancakes, and for her daughter to be dragged out of bed like a stubborn high schooler. </p><p>She steps into the kitchen, wiping sweat from her brow with her hoodie sleeve, but suddenly freezes when she notices Lorna and Alice aren’t alone.</p><p>“Morning, birthday girl,” Lorna calls out cheerfully from the stove, completely unaware of how Rio has frozen in the doorway. “Look who wandered in today.”</p><p>There’s an open white box of pastries on the table. And sitting right in front of it, legs neatly crossed, wearing a sleek deep mulberry coat like she owns the goddamn place, is Agatha fucking Harkness.</p><p>“You didn't tell us your boss was in town,” Lorna adds, looking over her shoulder.</p><p>Across from her, Alice sits frozen in her pajamas, clutching a cup of coffee with an expression that screams this is not at all her fault. She catches Rio’s stare and quickly mouths, <em> “I didn’t invite her here,” </em> before sneaking a pointed look behind her at her mom and mouthing again, <em> “Blame her.” </em></p><p>Agatha seems to notice the wordless exchange between them and gives Rio an overly polite smile, showing all her teeth and blue eyes that look like they could start a fight at eight in the goddamn morning.</p><p>“I hope you don’t mind the visit. Alice’s mom was kind enough to let me in.”</p><p>“And she brought cake,” the clueless older woman pipes up from the stove again. “You’ve told me plenty about your boss, but somehow you conveniently left out the part where she’s actually thoughtful,” she snorts, shaking her head.</p><p>Rio bites back the urge to say she’s not her boss. At least, not anymore. If Lorna had any clue this woman kicked her out of her office less than a week ago, she wouldn’t be making eggs and offering her a seat at the family table. But Agatha, with that whatever-it-is charm she usually saves for investors and sponsors, clearly worked her magic on Lorna too.</p><p>“It’s purely a coincidence,” Agatha goes on smoothly. “I have several important meetings in the area and thought I’d drop off something for Rio. My other assistant mentioned it was her birthday.”</p><p>Rio knows it’s a lie. A well-packaged one, sure, but a lie. First off, Jen probably doesn’t even know it’s Rio’s birthday. And second, what important fashion meeting could there possibly be in the middle of nowhere Hockessin? Still, her chest does a stupid little flip just thinking that Agatha remembered at all.</p><p>“Well,” Rio forces a smile and reaches for Agatha’s arm, ready to pull her out of the house. She’s not in the mood to linger. “That’s very kind of you, Miss Harkness. But I’m sure those important meetings are waiting for you right now. We both know how busy your schedule is. Allow me to see you out. And thank you for stopping by…and for the cake.”</p><p>“Actually, I don’t mind staying a while. Lorna invited me for breakfast,” Agatha says, evidently settling in now that she’s been granted access to the house. “I might’ve let it slip that I’m not a fan of the food at the hotel I’m staying at.” </p><p>What a witch. Whatever spell Agatha used to charm billion-dollar donors clearly works just as well on suburban moms.</p><p>“I did! And you’d be glad you said yes, because I make the best scrambled eggs and flapjacks around here,” Lorna says proudly, already rummaging through the kitchen cabinets. “I bet you never had anything like them. We use eggs from our neighbor’s chickens. Fresh and straight from the backyard. All from scratch. None of that store-bought, factory stuff you’re used to in the city.” </p><p>Rio shoots another look at Alice, who looks like she’s holding herself together by sheer willpower. The tension between Rio and her so-called boss is thick enough to choke on, and her own mom, blissfully unaware, is not helping in the slightest.</p><p>“Right.” Rio clears her throat, trying not to snap. “Would you excuse us for a second?” she says, stepping forward and finally grabbing Agatha by the arm with a too-sweet smile. “Pretty sure Agatha here would love to personally see where those fresh eggs come from.” With that, she quickly drags her out the back door before anyone can argue.</p><p>The second they step into the backyard, out of earshot from the others, Rio lets go of Agatha’s arm like it burns. “What the hell are you still doing here?” she finally snaps, letting herself say it. “I already told you, I’m not taking that damn job.”</p><p>The other woman smooths down her coat as if she wasn’t just dragged through someone else’s kitchen.</p><p>“And I’m not accepting that rejection.”</p><p>Rio stares at her in disbelief. </p><p>“You told me I could do whatever I wanted with that offer. I said no already. How many ways do I have to say it?” She paces a bit, then stops and looks right at her. “What do you actually want, Agatha?”</p><p>“I thought that was obvious. I didn’t suffer through a four-hour drive from fucking New York City and spent the night in some godforsaken roadside hotel in Hockessin for nothing.” </p><p>She also looks like she might combust, but Rio just raises an eyebrow, waiting. </p><p>Finally, like dragging teeth, Agatha spits the words out, each one sounding like it physically pains her. </p><p>“Okay, fine! I’m here to apologize. I shouldn’t have taken my anger at my mother out on you.” She clears her throat. “Rio, I want you back.”</p><p>A beat.</p><p>“At work. I want you back at work,” she clarifies, almost too quickly.</p><p>Rio crosses her arms tightly over her chest. “You said that already. And my answer is still no.”</p><p>“Well, you should know by now, I don’t take no for an answer,” Agatha says, exhaling. “I really mean it, Rio. I need you back.” </p><p>Rio exhales too. “Well, that’s too bad, because I already found a job.”</p><p>“You did?” </p><p>Rio nods, ignoring the way Agatha’s eyes suddenly deepen with something like loss and disappointment.</p><p>“Yeah. I start Monday.”</p><p>Technically a lie, since it’s still just an interview. But there’s no harm in a little manifesting. And honestly, she’d say just about anything right now if it meant getting Agatha off her tail.</p><p>Agatha stands straighter, as if the last three seconds didn’t happen. </p><p>“I’ll raise your salary then. Whatever that company’s offering you, I’ll double it.”</p><p>Rio lets out a bitter chuckle. “You really think that would change my mind? I don’t need the money, Agatha. What I needed was to be treated with basic respect. I was good at that job. Damn good. And you threw me out over something I only did for you.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t deny it. She just breathes slowly, like her ribs are too tight. </p><p>“Okay. I said it already, didn’t I? I said I was sorry. I was wrong to lash out. Isn’t that what you wanted to hear?” she says. “But I still stand by what I did. I didn’t need protecting, Rio. I didn’t need you to defend me. That’s not what I needed from you!” </p><p>“Then what the hell do you need from me?”</p><p>“I just—” Agatha’s eyes find Rio’s for a second before looking away again. “I need someone who can keep up with me, who can see what I can’t see. Someone who actually gives a damn about the work.” </p><p>“And you really think that’s me?” Rio asks, arms still crossed.</p><p>“I know it’s you,” Agatha puts forth, like it’s a fact. </p><p>Rio sighs. “And what happens the next time I overstep?”</p><p>“I’ll be expecting you not to make the same mistake twice.”</p><p>Agatha looks at her again, but this time, for a long second. Her eyes soften a little, but not nearly enough.</p><p>Rio curses herself for looking at those almost-pleading blue eyes, how easily she gets blinded the second they show even the slightest bit of vulnerability.</p><p>She groans, presses her fingers to her temple, and starts pacing again. Kicks a pebble across the yard and fights the urge to scream at this infuriating woman who's somehow making her blood boil and her heart race like she just downed three shots of espresso.</p><p>“Okay, fine! I’ll take the fucking job,” Rio snaps. “But only on one condition.”</p><p>Agatha straightens up, her eyes instantly filled with optimism and something else Rio still can't quite put her finger on. Those stupid, stunning, hypnotizing ocean-eyes of hers. God, they were annoying.</p><p>“Which is?” </p><p>Rio points a finger at her, heat rising in her chest. </p><p>“Every damn time you look at me like that, or whatever the hell that face means, you tell me what you’re thinking. Whatever it is, I get to ask. And you have to tell me.”</p><p>Agatha squints at her. “What?” </p><p>“You heard me.”</p><p>“That’s not even a reasonable condition.”</p><p>“It is now.”</p><p>Agatha just stares at her, baffled. “You want me to narrate my thoughts every time I look at you?”</p><p>“Only if I ask.” </p><p>“You can’t be serious.”</p><p>“I am serious.” </p><p>“And if I do say yes?” </p><p>Rio comes out with, “Then you stop chasing me around.” She stares at Agatha like she’s daring her to back down, but the latter seems just as determined. “And I start Monday.”</p><p>They stare at each other for a while before Agatha finally lets out a breath, her shoulders dropping just a bit. “Okay. If that’s what you want, then fine. I accept your stupid condition. Now, I expect nothing but to see you on Monday, Miss Vidal.” She turns to head back to the house, but stops and looks over her shoulder. “Oh, and I almost forgot. Happy birthday.” </p><p>Rio stands there a moment longer, hands on her hips, staring up at the cloudy sky like it might give her a sign. If she could call Zeus and ask for a lightning bolt straight to the face, she probably would.</p><p>“I’m such an idiot,” she mutters to herself.</p><p>Then she groans once last time and heads back inside after Agatha, like the absolute clown she is.</p><hr/><p>It must’ve been dumb luck, or maybe just Rio’s weird superpower of making friends with people who somehow always managed to keep their jobs, that not a single one of her bullpen buddies had been fired by Agatha in the week since Rio herself got booted out of the building.</p><p>The bullpen down on the lower floor is nothing like the glass-walled fortress Rio used to work in as Agatha’s junior assistant. That top floor, where the so-called beast of Nocturne reigns alongside her army of well-dressed, stiletto-sharp demons, is a whole other species.</p><p>The bullpen is its own strange beast entirely.</p><p>A systematic maze of boxes that looked like they hadn’t been updated since flip phones were cool. Half the desks were buried under old printouts, mood boards, empty coffee cups, and the occasional lip balm.</p><p>The other half had at least one aggressively cheerful quote taped to the wall, usually sitting beside a picture of Troy Bolton (if the person was gay), Keira Knightley in Bend It Like Beckham (if the person was also gay), or a chunky ginger cat in sunglasses (if the person was barely holding it together).</p><p>Somehow, Rio had ended up with a desk right in the middle of all three varieties. </p><p>“You know,” Shuri, the youngest of the bunch, says around a mouthful of sandwich as she wheels her chair over to Rio’s desk, “we should seriously build a shrine in your honor down here in the pit.”</p><p>Rio gives her a look. “And why exactly would we do that?”</p><p>“Cause you earned it,” Shuri says, pointing at her with half a sandwich. “Like, who else gets fired by Agatha freaking Harkness and actually comes back? Nobody. I’m pretty sure you’re the only person in Nocturne history to ever get that kind of special treatment.” She shakes her head, still kind of in awe.“That’s some real phoenix energy, dude. Rising straight from expensive-ass, designer-smelling ashes.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. If she had a nickel for every time someone compared her to a phoenix, she could’ve bought herself a better chair by now. Still, she can’t help but smile, thinking Shuri, Alice, and especially Billy would get along just fine if they ever crossed paths.</p><p>“Nah,” Darcy calls out from across the row, eyes still glued to her screen. “Still feels like a downgrade, if you ask me. Getting tossed down here with the rest of us when you could’ve stayed up in Fortress Harkness with the fashion angels and that stupid fancy coffee machine? Sounds more like punishment than anything. Down here? When it rains, it rains hellfire.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” comes Bob’s gentle voice from the next cubicle. “I think Rio is already starting to like it here. Right, Rio?” Bob, bashful and sweet, peeks over the divider like a shy meerkat. Darcy once pointed out that he probably says “sorry” at least five times before lunch. And one of them was to a chair.</p><p>Rio looks at all of them. “Well,” she says, stretching her arms behind her head, “Bob’s right. I think I do like it here. At least here, I actually get to write.”</p><p>And at least here, she doesn’t have to spend the whole excruciating day pretending not to look at Agatha.</p><p>It’s been almost a week since she started down here, and the only glimpse she’s had of the so-called fortress beast was when she had to swing by the deputy editor’s office for some random paperwork.</p><p>“Hey, Rio?” A woman from the other side of the bullpen taps lightly on the edge of her cubicle. “Melina wants to see you,” she says, then turns and walks off before Rio can even get a word out.</p><p>All three of Rio’s nearby friends turn to look at her, probably wondering the same thing she is. She just shrugs, grabs the hoodie draped over her chair, and pulls herself away from her desk.</p><p>One of the few things she actually likes about working down here in the pit is that there’s no need for blazers, heels, or stiff trousers. Just hoodies, sneakers, and whatever gets you through the day without crying into your keyboard. The perks of being a writer who rarely has to deal with visitors.</p><p>She heads toward Melina’s office, tucked in the far corner of the floor. It’s bright and unassuming, nothing like Agatha’s intimidating tower upstairs. Open space, just a single divider, a cluttered desk, and a large glass window with a view of the neighboring building.</p><p>Rio knocks once on the doorframe. “You wanted to see me?” she says, already stepping inside.</p><p>Melina looks up and gives a quick nod. “Yes, Rio. There you are. I need you to drop these proofs off at Agatha’s office,” she points to the pile in the corner of the table before turning back to her keyboard. “She needs to review all of them before tomorrow’s editorial meeting.”</p><p>Rio immediately stiffens at the idea of going up to Agatha’s office. She hasn’t set foot there since the incident, and definitely not since she came back. </p><p>“Me?” she asks, hoping maybe her deputy editor meant someone else. Anyone else.</p><p>“Yes, you, Rio,” Melina says, barely glancing at her. “Is there a problem?”</p><p>Yes. Because if she had even an ounce of a choice, she sure as hell wouldn’t be hauling herself upstairs. Working here would be infinitely more tolerable if she never had to lay eyes on Agatha Harkness, on most days, or any damn day, really.</p><p>“No, of course not,” she quips, grabbing the proofs from the desk and walking out.</p><p>The walk to the elevator feels way less like a quick errand and more like Orpheus heading into the underworld, except somehow, she’s going up. Her legs keep moving, but her brain is spinning.</p><p>Maybe, if she slows down just enough, some poor intern will come running after her to say Melina changed her mind and spare her the whole ordeal.</p><p>But Rio seems to have lucked out, because by the time the elevator doors slide open, her palms are clammy and her heart’s pounding like it knows something she doesn’t.</p><p>The first person she sees upstairs is the girl who ended up replacing her. The new assistant looks exactly like someone the company would hire. Someone who might have been grown in a lab specifically to match Agatha’s aesthetic, and the whole floor of corporate plastic clones. Flawless posture, a polished veneer of a smile, and no soul behind the eyes. Poor thing.</p><p>Then Jen looks up from her desk and gives Rio a once-over, making her painfully aware of what she’s wearing, which is nowhere near top-floor aesthetic in her faded college hoodie and worn-out ripped jeans.</p><p>“She’s been waiting for that,” Jen says, trying very hard not to comment on the outfit directly.</p><p>“Nice seeing you too, Jen,” she greets her former floor-mate, then heads toward Agatha’s office.</p><p>Inside, Agatha doesn’t look up when Rio enters, her eyes locked on the screen. But it’s clear she’s been expecting her since she doesn’t even need to look to know who it is. </p><p>“I was beginning to think you’d already forgotten how to find your way up here.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Rio clears her throat. “Here are the files you asked Melina for.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything else and just points to the side table, still without looking up.</p><p>Rio walks over and places the stack beside the other piles. </p><p>But she freezes abruptly as she notices a familiar little succulent sitting right on top.</p><p>It’s not dead. Not even a little wilted. It’s green, and actually thriving.</p><p>Rio had honestly assumed Agatha would’ve tossed it the second she was gone. Either that, or let it rot out of pure indifference. She wasn’t the plant-caring type, as she’d pointedly told Rio once, but the thriving succulent seemed to say otherwise. </p><p>Did Agatha actually take care of the plant Rio gave her?</p><p>She shakes herself out of it. “Well, that’s all she sent me,” she says, turning back. “If you need anything else, you can just call her, I guess.”</p><p>She’s halfway to the door when Agatha speaks.</p><p>“Did I say you could leave?”</p><p>Rio stops in her tracks. “Huh?” </p><p>“I have a presentation to finish for Stark in about an hour,” Agatha says, still focused on her laptop. “While I’m doing that, you can go through the drafts. Pick the ones you think fit for our next issue.”</p><p>“Here?”</p><p>Agatha finally looks up. “Is there somewhere else you’d rather be?”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth, then closes it again.</p><p><em> I’d rather be anywhere than sitting here trying not to look at you, </em> her brain offers.</p><p>Instead, she says, “No. Fine. I’ll just...sit here, then.” </p><p>It’s barely been twenty minutes since Rio sat down, but it already feels like she’s being slowly roasted alive. She tries to concentrate on the pages in front of her, but it’s hard when she can feel Agatha sneaking stares her way. </p><p>And she knows she’s not imagining it. She got a full eight hours of sleep last night. This isn’t sleep-deprived paranoia. Agatha is definitely looking at her. </p><p>The most annoying part, though, is that Rio can’t look back without being obvious. All she gets are quick peeks from the corner of her eye, which is totally unfair.</p><p>However, it seems like some gay god of yearning heard Rio’s silent plea, because not long after, there’s a knock at the door and Jen pokes her head in.</p><p>“Agatha? Paris is on the line. They’re asking to speak with you directly.”</p><p>“Transfer it,” Agatha says, already reaching for the wireless phone. She then answers it mid-turn, walking toward the large glass window behind her desk.</p><p>Rio thinks about leaving, but then again, Agatha didn’t tell her to. So she stays in her seat and pretends she’s not hearing any part of the conversation. But it doesn’t take long for the calm to break.</p><p>“No, I’ve seen the numbers,” Agatha says into the phone. “And no, I’m not concerned. Why would I be? I’m not about to let a temporary spike throw off months of planning. Let her have her little win.”</p><p>A moment later, the French starts. And Rio really tries not to listen. But it’s hard to ignore a storm when it’s happening three feet away. Not that Agatha seems to care what Rio hears.</p><p>The latter then lets her eyes travel toward the other woman. There’s something tired about her today, more than usual. Dark circles beneath her eyes, mostly covered by makeup, but not enough to fool Rio. </p><p>Has she even been sleeping?</p><p>Then Rio notices the lunch. A perfectly cooked steak, golden potatoes, and a little side salad on a sleek white plate, sitting untouched beside her laptop. She glances at the time. It’s almost three in the afternoon, and Agatha clearly hasn’t eaten yet. </p><p>Has she even taken a break all day?</p><p>But before Rio can dwell on it, Agatha turns halfway around, and she quickly snaps her eyes back to the pages in front of her like a kid caught staring. </p><p>Agatha’s voice rises again. Whoever’s on the other end of that call is definitely pissing her off.</p><p>“Je sais ce qui est en jeu. Don’t insult me by thinking I don’t. Valentina peut brandir ses chiffres toute la journée, qu’elle le fasse. Je m’en fiche. I have no need to compete with people beneath me.”</p><p>Rio frowns, trying to catch bits of the meaning from the one French class she took back in her first year of college. But before she can make sense of it, Agatha ends the call sharply.</p><p>“No, we’re done here. And yes, I’m sure I’ll have a lovely day. Though certainly not because of you!”</p><p>Agatha slumps back into her chair at the same time she drops the phone back into its receiver.</p><p>“Imbéciles,” she mutters, running a hand down her face and leaving it there. </p><p>That’s when Rio stands slowly, papers in hand, and walks over to the desk. She sets the stack down gently in front of her, just as Agatha pulls her hand away and looks up.</p><p>“What’s this?” she asks. </p><p>“I think some of these drafts are good to go. But you can go through them yourself too, just to be sure.”</p><p>However, Agatha is eyeing the Snickers bar Rio had placed on top of the stack, pulled straight from the pocket of her hoodie. “I meant this,” she says flatly, pointing at it.</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer right away. Agatha definitely doesn’t need to know she noticed the untouched lunch, or that, for a second, she thought Agatha looked one phone call away from passing out.</p><p>“You’re not you when you’re hungry,” she says with a shrug, trying hard to keep her face free of any trace of concern and hoping a bit of dry humor might cover for it, too. “If you don’t need anything else from me, I’ll head back downstairs,” she adds, hands slipping into her pockets.</p><p>She turns and walks out before Agatha can say anything, doing her best not to overthink the way she can still feel Agatha’s eyes on her all the way to the door.</p><hr/><p>The days that follow feel like a slow, cruel experiment, one specifically designed to test Rio’s tolerance for Agatha Harkness, or maybe just to see how long she can hold out before being sucked back into her orbit like some helpless satellite.</p><p>Because somehow, Agatha has been seen in the pit more than usual.</p><p>Sometimes she’s heading to Melina’s office. Sometimes she’s supposedly checking in on layout progress. And sometimes, Rio swears, she’s just walking through for absolutely no reason, like a lion casually strolling through a petting zoo.</p><p>Even Shuri noticed. “She’s down here again?” she had whispered one afternoon as they watched Agatha’s heels disappear around a corner, pointing out how she rarely ever set foot in this part of the building. Normally, prey came to her. “But now, it’s giving: an apex predator on a casual hunt,” Shuri had joked.</p><p>Rio and the others had laughed it off. </p><p>Obviously, Agatha wasn’t down here because of <em> her </em>. That would be ridiculous. Why would she be?</p><p>Still, the theory gets harder to dismiss when, one morning, a box of fresh coffee arrives in the bullpen, ordered, apparently, by Agatha herself.</p><p>And sure, maybe she’d been making some team-wide announcement about an upcoming deadline. Rio honestly couldn’t say, because she hadn’t heard a single word of it. Because all she could focus on was the way Agatha had walked past the desks, barely sparing anyone a glance, and then wordlessly placed a cup of coffee — Rio’s usual, not-too-sweet cup of coffee — right on her desk.</p><p>But despite all the little things piling up, despite her ongoing hypothesis that maybe Agatha keeps showing up in the pit for her, Rio refuses to let it get to her head. She’s not about to start spiraling over a cup of coffee and a few unexpected hallway sightings.</p><p>So instead of having lunch with her friends in the noisy company cafeteria, she grabs her sad little takeout, and heads out for a walk. The nearby park isn’t anything fancy, just a stretch of green and a few scattered benches. People are walking dogs, eating ice cream, and scrolling on their phones.</p><p>Rio finds a spot under a tree and sits down, unwrapping her lunch. She watches people for a while: an old man feeding birds, a young couple arguing, a kid trying to chase a pigeon, and lets the buzz of everything around her fill the space that Agatha’s been taking up in her brain.</p><p>She’s halfway through her cold sandwich when she hears a sharp curse from a nearby bench.</p><p>“Maledizione.”</p><p>Rio looks up. The voice belongs to an older woman, fussing with something in her lap. She’s draped in layers of fabric: flowy, bright, a mess of color. Big rings, jangly bracelets, a scarf that keeps slipping off her shoulder. A sketchpad rests across her knees.</p><p>Rio watches her for a second. Then, not one to let people struggle alone, she asks, “Everything alright?”</p><p>The woman huffs, patting her clothes like she’s lost something. </p><p>“I can’t find my glasses. I had them with me when I sat down. I know I did.”</p><p>Rio stands and walks over, trying not to smile when she sees the said glasses, resting perfectly on top of the woman’s head. “Uh,” she says gently, pointing upward. “You mean those?”</p><p>The woman freezes, then bursts out laughing. A loud, full laugh that turns a few heads.</p><p>“Oh for heaven’s sake,” she says, still chuckling. “Getting old is hell.”</p><p>Rio chuckles as well. “Happens to the best of us.”</p><p>She adjusts the glasses and settles back into her seat, still smiling.</p><p>Rio lingers a moment. “Are you an artist?”</p><p>The woman raises an eyebrow like Rio just asked if she breathes air. </p><p>“Well, you could say that.” </p><p>Rio nods and the woman regards for a while. </p><p>“Heart troubles?” </p><p>“Sorry?” </p><p>“People don’t come here at this hour just for the view, dear. They come because they’re either chasing a bit of inspiration, or trying to hush something in their chest that’s been making too much noise.”</p><p>Rio then understands what the older woman means. </p><p>“Oh, no it’s not. It’s not like that.” then a pause. “I’m just having some trouble at work, that’s all.”</p><p>The older woman only gives her a look and hums. “And where do you happen to work?” she asks. Rio hesitates, unsure if she wants to burden a stranger with her troubles. “You know what they say, it’s easier to share things with strangers,” the woman adds, sensing her hesitation.</p><p>Rio sighs and sits on the far edge of the bench. There is a strange comfort in telling things to a stranger. But how was she supposed to explain her mess of a work life, let alone anything involving Agatha Harkness? “I work at a fashion magazine,” she says instead, keeping it vague.</p><p>“You? At a fashion magazine? Do you even like fashion?” the woman asks, all genuine surprise.</p><p>Rio considers being offended, but maybe that’s just how old people talk. Blunt and no sugarcoating. “I do get that a lot,” she says politely and chuckles. “I used to be an assistant to someone who’s basically a genius when it comes to fashion. Now I write for the same magazine, even if I still don’t know half the things I probably should.”</p><p>“Is that why you look so miserable?” the woman asks, but not unkind. She doesn’t wait for Rio to answer. “If you don’t love it, why are you still doing it?” she adds, squinting at her like the question genuinely baffles her. “Life’s too short to waste on things that don’t light you up, sweetheart. Trust me, I’d know.”</p><p>“I did leave. Or more like, I was forced to leave,” Rio says, rubbing the back of her neck. “But then my boss asked me to come back, and I couldn’t exactly say no to her. Which is stupid, but—”</p><p>“Does your boss know?” the woman hums.</p><p>“Does she know what?”</p><p>She glances at Rio’s name tag, her eyes landing on it with a faint smile. </p><p>“That you like her, Rio.”</p><p>Rio blinks. “What?”</p><p>“So she doesn’t,” the older woman concludes. “And why haven’t you told her?”</p><p>Rio just stares at her. “Because I don’t—” She cuts herself off. No way was she about to explain to a complete stranger how her hormones basically snapped to attention whenever Agatha was within ten feet. It was already pathetic enough that she’d admitted it to herself.</p><p>“Oh, kid,” remarks the older woman. “I’ve lived long enough to know that look when I see it.”</p><p>Rio swallows. “What look?”</p><p>The woman smiles gently. </p><p>“You seem like a smart young woman. I think you already know.” She sets her sketchbook aside and gives her knee a gentle pat. “So? What is it you’re so afraid of?”</p><p>Rio still wants to deny it, but what’s the point of lying to someone who doesn’t even know her, and somehow clocked her in seconds? </p><p>“Well, it’s kind of complicated. Okay, not kind of. It’s really complicated. She’s not exactly the kind of person you can just say things to. Not without thinking she’ll walk away the second you do.” Her thumb runs along the seam of her sleeve. “Even though...lately, it kinda feels like maybe she wouldn’t.</p><p>The woman studies her for a moment, intrigued.</p><p>“Then why can’t you tell her? What’s the worst that can happen?”</p><p>Rio lets out a small, dry laugh. “My job, for starters.” </p><p>But the older woman isn’t done. She tilts her head, like she’s piecing something together.</p><p>“But you said it kind of feels like maybe she wouldn’t. Why’s that?”</p><p>Rio hesitates, wondering if she should even mention the almost-kiss. Or the kiss that was more than almost. Or all the moments in between. But then she realizes how weird it would be to spill all that to a stranger who doesn’t even know her. So instead, she settles for the smaller, safer truths.</p><p>“I don’t know if I’m imagining it. But somehow she keeps showing up where I am. I mean, yeah, we work in the same building, but I think you get what I mean. And then she does these little things. Like remembering exactly how I take my coffee. Or asking me to work in her office. I’m really trying not to read into it. I really am. I don’t want to make something out of nothing. But she’s making it very hard.”</p><p>“Why is she making it hard? Did she ever hurt you?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head slowly. “No. Not exactly.”</p><p>The woman looks at her, eyes crinkling with something knowing. And she smiles, one of those smiles people have when they’ve lived through every shape of love and loss. “The thing is,” she drawls, “some people don’t realize they’ve left a mark on you until they finally see the shape of it when you walk away.”</p><p>It’s so vague and doesn’t seem to make sense for Rio, but she sits with that for a second.</p><p>“And what am I supposed to do with that?”</p><p>The woman shrugs. “That depends. Do you want her to see it? Or are you trying to forget it’s there?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer. She just allows the words to rest between them for a time before steering the conversation elsewhere. There is no need to burden this poor woman with her problems.</p><p>“You don’t exactly look like you’re supposed to be here either,” she quips instead, nodding at the woman’s sketchpad. “Let me guess, out hunting for inspiration?”</p><p>The woman cackles and shakes her head, like the words coming out of Rio’s clueless mouth are stupidly endearing. “I do find inspiration in the oddest places, yes,” she says, though she doesn’t seem too eager to elaborate, and Rio respectfully doesn’t press. </p><p>The younger woman is just about to say something else when her phone buzzes. It’s a text from Darcy.</p><p>
<b> <em>Better get your ass back here. Fortress Harkness wants everyone in the conference room in 30.</em> </b>
</p><p>Rio sighs, slipping her phone back into her pocket. “I guess I have to go. Lunch break’s over,” she says, standing from the bench with a half-apologetic smile. “I hope you find whatever it is you’re looking for here, whatever kind of inspiration this place is supposed to give.”</p><p>The older woman nods, brushing invisible crumbs off her lap.</p><p>“Oh, I think I already did, kid.” </p><hr/><p>By the time Rio gets to the conference room on the top floor, it’s already packed. Practically everyone from the pit is there, clustered around the long table or standing along the walls. She scans the room instinctively and spots Agatha right away, up front, pacing with a phone pressed to her ear. As per usual, whoever’s on the other end is clearly getting torn to shreds.</p><p>Melina sits up front too, arms crossed, watching the room like she’s already predicting bloodshed.</p><p>Rio weaves her way to the corner where Darcy, Bob, and Shuri have carved out a spot. Bob looks like he might pass out. “What’s going on?” she whispers, sliding into the seat next to him.</p><p>“Numbers,” he mutters, not even looking up as he squeezes one of his neon, squishy stress balls.</p><p>“What about it?” </p><p>“Reader stats. Stark saw the latest analytics and apparently threw a fit.” </p><p>Just then, Agatha ends her call with a vicious stab at her screen, jaw clenched so tight it’s a miracle her teeth don’t crack. She doesn’t so much as glance at Melina or the other senior editors beside her. Just stares straight ahead like she’s counting down to detonation.</p><p>Rio watches her from where she’s sitting at the far end of the room. And then, like she can feel someone staring, Agatha’s furious blue eyes land on her. For a second, something in her shoulders eases, and her face softens. Like seeing Rio is the only thing in the room not currently driving her insane. But it’s gone just as fast and the mask snaps back into place almost immediately.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, strides to the front, and picks up the mic. She doesn’t even bother with pleasantries, and doesn’t wait for the room to settle down. “I’ll get straight to the point. Mr. Stark has raised concerns about Nocturne’s engagement numbers dropping compared to some rival magazines, and I’m not in the mood to waste anyone’s time with a slideshow about it.”</p><p>“But while that’s happening,” Agatha goes on coolly, “it just so happens we might also have the exact story that could pull our numbers back up. Has anyone here heard of Lilia Calderu?”</p><p>A ripple of recognition moves through the room, a few murmurs rising, but Rio just blinks and furrows her brows. “Who’s Lilia Calderu?” she whispers to Shuri.</p><p>Shuri twists sharply in her chair to stare at her. “Are you serious right now?”</p><p>Rio shrugs, palms up. “I don’t know, is this one of those things I was supposed to be born knowing?” </p><p>“She’s practically a legend,” Shuri says, her voice dropping low so the people up front won’t hear. “Like, people in fashion call her the Oracle. They say she dreams of her designs before she even sketches them. Like fashion just visits her in her sleep.” Rio raises a brow, but Shuri’s not done. “She’s been MIA for fifteen years. Some say she retired in Italy. Others think she just lost it.”</p><p>Agatha eventually cuts through the chatter. </p><p>“Lilia is a notoriously elusive designer who hasn’t given a single interview in over a decade. But it’s been confirmed she’s back in New York for the City Ballet Fall Fashion Gala. And that gives us a rare opening. If we can secure a sit-down with her, it won’t just be a strong feature, but it could also spike our numbers across print and digital. Though, we’ll need a standout pitch to cut through the noise. Especially since De Fontaine and her team at Oxe are after the same story. They’ve been chasing her for years. We cannot let them get there first.” </p><p>She then turns to Melina. </p><p>“Miss Vostokoff and I have already decided who’s taking the lead and which team’s handling it. She’ll call you into her office shortly. I expect a confirmed interview by the end of the week.”</p><p>From the back, Darcy lets out a quiet, almost pitying, “Well, good luck with whoever that is.”</p><p>Rio looks over at her. “Why?”</p><p>Darcy glances up from her nails. “Because whoever Melina sends might not even get past Lilia’s front door. Not if Lilia knows who Nocturne’s editor-in-chief is.”</p><p>Rio frowns. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Rio, you really need to brush up on your company history, girl,” Darcy says with a teasing shake of her head. “The last person to land an exclusive with Lilia Calderu was none other than baby Agatha Harkness. Back when Satan’s mistress was still just one of the spawns,” she adds in a mock whisper. </p><p>She leans in a bit, lowering her voice. “And let’s just say, the piece wasn’t exactly flattering. Might have even been what pushed Lilia off the grid. But to be fair, that article also made Agatha a name. Like, front page, overnight-sensation kind of thing. Can’t really blame her for riding that wave.”</p><p>Later that day, Rio’s back at the pit when she sees Mary Jane Watson walk out of Melina’s office. Of course it’s Mary Jane. One of Nocturne’s more seasoned fashion writers. She and her team were behind that Zara labor exposé and the Vogue burnout profile that ruffled all the right feathers.</p><p>Rio drops into her chair, still thinking about what Darcy said, about that article Agatha wrote.</p><p>The one that might’ve pushed some mystery designer to disappear for fifteen years. </p><p>She turns to her computer and types in the right keywords. </p><p>Not much comes up. No press photos. No profile pictures. Barely any interviews, and the few that do exist are written, nothing on video. It’s like Lilia had someone scrub the internet clean. All that’s left are runway photos with her name flashing faintly on an LED wall in the background.</p><p>What the hell did Agatha write to make someone just vanish?</p><p>She scrolls further, clicking through dead links and buried fashion archives, until her eyes finally land on an article, with a familiar name on the byline.</p><blockquote>
<p>
<b> <em>The Illusionist: Inside the Strange Genius of Lilia Calderu</em> </b>
</p>
<p>
<em> By Agatha Harkness </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> Published: November 2010, Nocturne Magazine </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> “Genius,” they say, “walks the line between brilliance and madness.” In Lilia Calderu’s case, that line is an unpredictable, obscured runway, one that defies convention, logic, and any clear sense of direction. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> To call Lilia Calderu a fashion designer is to call a thunderstorm “a bit of rain.” She’s unlike any other. She doesn’t conform to anything resembling a standard process. She dreams. Literally. She wakes up and scribbles designs on the backs of receipts, napkins, sometimes even on her own skin, she says. And the fashion world has long eaten it up with a gold spoon. Hungry for the myth, starved for meaning. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> But what happens when the myth doesn’t hold? </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> Calderu greeted me barefoot in her Brooklyn brownstone, and she offered me rose tea and wore an embroidered robe. Coffee, I was told, was unwelcome in her home, something about caffeine and restless spirits. Her speech wandered the way her thoughts did: wispy, scattered, dipped in mysticism. She spoke of her fabrics like they were haunted, ghosts she was trying to stitch into submission. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> The thing is, she is fascinating. There’s a reason the fashion world hailed her as a visionary. Her pieces are haunting. Ethereal. Unbelievably intricate. But beneath all the silk and smoke, you start to wonder: where does the art end, and where does the performance begin? </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> After nearly two hours of spiraling talk about past lives, moon cycles, and a dress that supposedly weeps when worn by the wrong person, the illusion began to fray. Strip away the mystique, and what’s left is a woman propped up by the industry’s endless appetite for the eccentric, the unknowable, the myth of the so-called genius that defies definition. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> She is allergic to labels, but conveniently benefits from every one they give her: “witch, oracle, prophet in couture.” Calderu claims to hate stereotypes, but plays right into them when it suits the story. She is deeply private, yet willingly mythologized. She refuses the mainstream but hosts trunk shows in palazzos. She is somehow a contradiction, an illusionist who dares you to call her out on it. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> And then there’s the question no one wants to ask: what happens when the magic runs out? </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> Sources close to her team describe missed deadlines, spontaneous design changes hours before shows, entire collections scrapped because of a ‘bad dream.’ One former assistant, who requested anonymity, said, “You don’t work for Lilia. You orbit her. And eventually, you burn out.” </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> In person, Calderu was charming. Kooky, but kind. It’s easy to fall under her spell, to believe in the mythos. But charm doesn’t build a legacy. And kindness alone can’t dress a model. At some point, a designer must descend from the clouds and face the ground. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> What Calderu creates is beautiful, sometimes even extraordinary.  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> But so are shooting stars. And both disappear just as quickly. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> The industry needs more than dreams. It needs discipline, clarity, and, dare I say, reality. Perhaps it’s time we stopped chasing illusions and started asking: what, really, is worth worshipping? Because at the end of the day, even the most haunting magic trick still leaves you staring at an empty stage. </em>
</p>
</blockquote><p>Rio finishes reading and just stares at the screen. She’s not sure what to think. But three things are clear.</p><p>First, no wonder Agatha Harkness is where she is now. How do you even write like that at twenty-three? </p><p>Second, of course it was Agatha. Of course a twenty-three-year-old version of her walked into a legend’s house, called her kooky to her face (and to half a million readers), and somehow made the woman disappear from the whole industry for over ten years. Who else could pull that off and still sleep at night?</p><p>And third, most embarrassing of all, is the way Agatha writes. It’s kind of hot. Like, disturbingly hot. And Rio has no idea what it says about her that someone’s writing style is suddenly turning her on.</p><p>The piece is brutal. But there’s also something weirdly respectful in it. It’s honest and raw. Like Agatha wasn’t out to humiliate Lilia, but simply expose the cracks. Hold up a mirror and ask, “do you even see what you’ve become?” Which makes Rio wonder, what kind of mirror would Agatha hold up to her?</p><p>But before Rio can even begin to rewire her brain to deal with that thought, her phone lights up with a text from Jen: <b> <em>She summons you. </em> </b></p><p>Rio frowns, slips her phone into her pocket, and gets to her feet.</p><p>She finds Agatha mid-call in her office. “Yes, I know that,” she says, spotting Rio but continuing. “Oui, Natalia, je sais ce que je fais. Oui, I might have to call you back. Of course. Take care of yourself.” </p><p>Rio stiffens as it sinks in who’s on the other end of the call. </p><p>From the bit of French she caught, it’s not hard to guess. She pretends her heart didn’t just drop. </p><p>So maybe Agatha and her blonde ex were back together. Why wouldn’t they be? They’re practically the perfect magazine power couple. Natalia’s exactly the type Agatha would proudly have on her arm, someone she wouldn’t mind being seen with.</p><p>Rio shifts on her feet, frowning. Why the hell did Agatha even call her up here?</p><p>The call ends but instead of speaking to Rio, or even looking her way, Agatha just sinks back into her chair and starts typing away on her laptop. So Rio clears her throat, hovering a safe distance away. </p><p>“You called for me?” </p><p>Agatha doesn’t look up. “Have you chosen a suit yet?”</p><p>Rio blinks. “A suit?”</p><p>“Yes. Didn’t Monica show them to you?”</p><p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Agatha exhales through her nose, still not looking up. “The suit you’ll be wearing to the Gala on Saturday.”</p><p>Rio suddenly remembers their whole floor had been strongly encouraged to attend the Gala. </p><p>But she’d already decided in her head she wasn’t going. </p><p>For very specific, totally rational reasons. Which absolutely had nothing to do with the fact that it was the New York City Ballet’s event. Or that someone from there just so happened to be someone she’s trying to avoid. And now, thanks to Agatha’s little reminder, Rio remembers exactly who that person is.</p><p>Why on earth would she willingly subject herself to being in the same room as Agatha and her blonde eye candy, breathing the same damn air, when she could be at home, horizontal on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, sad-boying to Boygenius, and eating chips straight from the bag?</p><p>“I’m not going,” she says flatly. </p><p>Agatha finally looks up. “And why not? Didn’t your floor receive an invite?”</p><p>“We did. But it’s not even mandatory, so—”</p><p>“Do you want me to make it mandatory?”</p><p>Rio blinks. “I don’t even know what I’d do there.”</p><p>“It’s called networking,” Agatha says, like it physically pains her to explain the concept. “Many editors will be there. Journalists you might actually want to meet. Doesn’t that interest you?”</p><p>Rio hesitates. Why would Agatha care if she meets other editors? Unless…was this some elaborate way to make firing her again easier later? The audacity of this woman.</p><p>“I mean, it does. But—”</p><p>“Then you’re going,” Agatha cuts in. “There’s a selection of suits waiting for you downstairs. I already had Monica pull some options. Just go pick whatever you want.”</p><p>Rio squints at her. “Do the rest of the employees get this kind of special treatment too?” </p><p>She knows it sounds bratty and ungrateful even to her own ears, but she can’t help it. </p><p>Why was Agatha suddenly all up in her wardrobe like this?</p><p>“Only the ones who clearly need it,” her boss comments, giving Rio’s current choice of ensemble a slow once-over: rumpled navy tee, washed-out jeans, beat-up boots, and an oversized flannel that looks one dry cycle away from disintegrating.</p><p>Rio opens her mouth to fire back, but Agatha’s already dismissing her with a wave. </p><p>“Now go on. Don’t keep Monica waiting. And tell her to come see me after.”</p><hr/><p>Rio would blame being fashionably late to the gala on the impromptu haircut Alice and Billy gave her earlier that day, not on the very real, very valid reason of not wanting to be there in the first place. It was just supposed to be a little trim, but Billy insisted she’d look cool with a short bob–wolfcut hybrid that would “frame her cheekbones.”</p><p>She actually thought about skipping altogether. But then she saw the outfit Monica had picked out for her: a deep burgundy Alexander McQueen suit with sharp lapels, a striped shirt underneath, and a tie that was already perfectly knotted. Backing out suddenly felt like a waste.</p><p>Monica has good taste. Of course, it comes with the job of being a stylist. But more importantly, Monica’s nice. She doesn’t deserve to be ghosted. Also, Rio’s not stupid enough to end up on her bad side.</p><p>Alice drives them in Billy’s mom’s car, because obviously, Rio can’t ride the subway in a suit that probably costs more than their monthly rent.</p><p>When she arrives, she walks through a handful of camera flashes. Not because anyone knows who she is, she’s just background noise to the rich and powerful inside, but someone must’ve thought she looked important. Still, she doesn’t stop for photos.</p><p>Her plan: find one person she actually wants to talk to, and cling. Her friends from the bullpen didn’t bother showing up (which, to be fair, neither would she have). </p><p>But any coherent plan falls apart the second she steps into the venue and sees Agatha.</p><p>Agatha stands at the center of the room, half-turned, deep in conversation, but Rio’s eyes go straight to the gown she’s wearing. The bodice is fitted and sculpted, leaving her neck bare, while oversized puff sleeves drape over her shoulders like folded clouds. The color is nearly identical to Rio’s suit.</p><p>Did Agatha coordinate their outfits?</p><p>No. That’d be ridiculous. Absurd. Stupid.</p><p>But what’s even stupider is how Agatha’s blue eyes easily find hers across the room and Rio swears she sees the faintest twitch of a smile tug at her mouth.</p><p>However, what’s most stupid is the heat blooming in Rio’s ears when she also spots the blonde Agatha’s speaking with. Oh, great. Of course, Agatha’s blonde ballerina is here. Time to drown herself in champagne and pretend her heart isn’t the dumbest organ in her body.</p><p>“I didn’t expect to see you here.”</p><p>Rio turns, and there’s another blonde. This one is familiar in a more tolerable way.</p><p>“Hela.”</p><p>“Didn’t peg you for the type to actually show up to these things,” she greets, sipping her drink. “Especially now that you’re not her assistant anymore,” she adds, subtly nodding toward the woman in burgundy in the middle of the room. “Which, by the way, I’m still a little salty about, because somehow, you still didn’t actually <em> leave </em> her. But whatever. So, how’s the glamorous life of a fashion writer treating you?”</p><p>Rio smiles, a bit apologetic. </p><p>“I’m actually really sorry about that. If it’s any consolation, I was seriously considering it, and I was grateful, really. But then things just shifted, and I couldn’t take it. Work’s been going well, though.” </p><p>Surprisingly, writing-wise, it is going well. She’s still on the short, back-page stuff since she only started recently, but it’s still progress. Though, part of her wishes she was writing something else. Something grittier. But Hela doesn’t need to know that.</p><p>“I hope she’s worth it.” </p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Hela says simply. “I just hope she’s worth whatever you’re putting on hold for yourself. People like her…they don’t make it easy to feel things for them. I just hope she doesn’t burn you out.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw goes slack. </p><p>Has she really been that obvious? Heart eyes and all? Even people she barely knows are clocking it? Jesus. Is she really that transparent? Why does her stupid face have to give everything away?</p><p>“Oh please,” she scoffs. “I don’t have feelings for her.”</p><p>“You turned down a perfect shot at doing what you really want, just to work under her again…at her request. If that’s not feelings, I don’t know what is.” Hela takes a sip of her drink, while Rio wishes she could melt right into the marble floor from sheer embarrassment. “I’ve ghostwritten enough memoirs to recognize that look. You’ve got it bad, darling.”</p><p>Rio lets out a breath, rubbing the back of her neck. “It’s not like I’m putting things on hold for her, okay? Going back to Nocturne was my call. I thought maybe I’d try something different first, see what it’s like before chasing the stories I actually care about. Maybe it was a stupid move, but it’s mine to make.”</p><p>Hela hums, amused, and grabs a flute of champagne from a passing server. </p><p>“Oh, Rio. You’re charming and foolish to a fault.” She hands it to her.</p><p>Rio chuckles, about to fire back, when another server approaches them. </p><p>“Excuse me, Miss Vidal. Miss Harkness would like to speak with you.”</p><p>Rio’s brows pull together just as Hela says, “Well, looks like your ice queen’s calling.” She takes a sip of her drink, eyes darting toward Agatha. “I’ll let you go, then. But if you ever have a change of heart, my offer still stands. I can still put you in touch with my editor. Think of it as your safety net, for when all this inevitably blows up in your face.” She winks, then turns and glides off, drink in hand.</p><p>When Rio walks over, Agatha doesn’t waste time.</p><p>“So. Who was that?”</p><p>Rio pauses, glancing sideways at her. The blonde Agatha had been talking to earlier is nowhere in sight now, and it’s just the two of them. Jen’s nearby, but thankfully caught up in another conversation.</p><p>“Just someone I know,” Rio replies. “From Wall Street.”</p><p>“Wall Street?” Agatha lifts a brow. “Huh. And here I thought you were aiming higher.”</p><p>Rio blinks. Was that supposed to be an insult? A joke? A weird compliment in disguise? She doesn’t get the chance to figure it out when Agatha is already turning and walking ahead, nodding for her to follow.</p><p>“I heard Meredith from the Times is here,” she adds over her shoulder. “Bit of a jump, I know. But Jessica’s around too. She handles the weekend section. Do you want me to introduce you?”</p><p>Rio looks at her. “And why would you do that?”</p><p>“Didn’t I say this event is for networking? Or do you need a crash course on how that works?”</p><p>Rio knows how the whole networking game works. But what throws her off is Agatha being the one to push her toward it. “Why would you even want me talking to other editors?” she asks, frowning. “I mean, isn’t that kind of unethical? I currently work for you.” </p><p>She doesn’t bother hiding how confused she is. None of this makes sense coming from Agatha.</p><p>“If that’s how you see it,” Agatha draws in that usual neutral tone, matching her face. “Then I worry about how far you’ll actually get. This industry doesn’t reward loyalty, Rio. You should learn the difference between that and opportunity, before it costs you both.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tenses. Her blood starts to simmer.</p><p>“Of course you’d say that,” she mutters. “You always know how to twist things just to make it work in your favor, even if it means stepping over people to do it.”</p><p>It came out harsher than Rio meant, and she sees it land as Agatha’s face stiffen for a split second before she smooths it over like it didn’t hurt. Okay, perhaps Rio went too far. She’s just about to take it back, or at least say something a little less cruel, when someone else steps in front of them.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness. What a vision.”</p><p>They turn, and an older woman with silvery-streaked hair and a too-sharp smile is gliding toward them.</p><p>“Valentina,” Agatha greets tightly. “I could say the same.” They do the double-cheek kiss thing, all très chic, and Rio swears she can feel Agatha’s shoulders stiffen.</p><p>Both their smiles don’t even reach their eyes. </p><p>“Though I’m surprised to see you here,” Agatha adds, tilting her head. “Weren’t you supposed to be in Shanghai? I heard Fashion Week there is always a little dull without you.”</p><p>Valentina clutches her chest like she’s touched. </p><p>“Oh, and miss this? Never. Besides, I’ve got more pressing business here in New York. Our numbers are looking fabulous, if I do say so myself. Couldn’t really stay away.”</p><p>Agatha swallows whatever profanity is on her tongue. “Of course. Quite the stellar issue you’ve got this month. Let’s just hope it’s not a fluke, and that it actually lasts. Readers these days can be so fickle.”</p><p>That hits something in Valentina. </p><p>“Oh, it’ll last,” she replies, all sugar and threat. “And I’m very committed to making sure it does.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a too-sweet laugh. “Aren’t we all?”</p><p>Valentina matches it, plastic and tight.</p><p>“Well. Ciao, chérie. I need to make a few calls. My assistant left the studio’s lookbook in Milan, can you believe it? Sometimes I wonder how civilization survived this long with so many idiots walking around.” </p><p>And just like that, she spins off, already tapping at her phone. </p><p>Agatha exhales once Valentina’s out of sight. “God, I need a drink.”</p><hr/><p>Almost an hour passes, and Rio stays planted near the entrance, well out of Agatha’s orbit, who, at some point, apparently decided to drink more than necessary. </p><p>Not that she’s sloppy about it. She still moves with the same cool elegance of someone who’d never been caught drunk in public. But her cheeks are definitely pinker than usual, and Rio can’t help but notice. </p><p>Should she stop their boss from downing another glass? Then again, isn’t that Jen’s job? Or maybe the job of her ballerina girlfriend, who’s suddenly nowhere in sight.</p><p>“When I had a feeling that day wasn’t the last time I’d see you, I didn’t think it’d be this soon.”</p><p>Rio turns and sees the familiar older woman from the park.</p><p>“Hey. Hi. You’re here,” she blurts, a little caught off guard.</p><p>The woman lets out a warm laugh. “Oh, sweetheart. There’s nowhere else I’d rather be.” </p><p>Before Rio can say anything, there’s a sudden ripple in the room. People start looking their way, and camera flashes go off like fireworks aimed in their direction. Rio blinks, thrown off for a second, and gets the creeping feeling she’s missed something important.</p><p>“Lilia, over here!” a photographer shouts, and Rio’s jaw drops.</p><p>“Wait. Lilia? You’re Lilia Calderu?”</p><p>Lilia laughs again. “Oh, you better close that mouth, kid. You don’t want them snapping photos like that. Trust me, it’d cost you a huge fortune to get them taken down,” she says with a wink. “And I’m sorry I didn’t introduce myself sooner. I just figured you’d catch on eventually.”</p><p>Rio snaps her jaw shut. “I, uh, God, I feel so stupid.” </p><p>“Oh, don’t be. Happens to the best of us,” Lilia chuckles again, and Rio can’t help but smile at hearing her own words echoed back at her. “So, I’m guessing you’re not here alone?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “No, I’m not alone,” she says, then quickly realizes who she’s actually with, and what that might mean to Lilia. Oh god. This woman’s probably going to hate her now, isn’t she? “I’m actually here with my boss,” she adds, trying not to sound too guilty about it.</p><p>“Your boss?” Lilia repeats, and there’s a coruscation of knowing in her eyes. </p><p>And because the universe is a cruel little shit, her boss materializes right then.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha throws out as she steps up beside them, smelling like champagne and lavender. “You didn’t mention you knew Lilia.” Her eyes are all on the older woman now. That same tone she used with Valentina is back. “The one and only. Nice to see you back, Miss Calderu. How’s Sicily this time of year?”</p><p>Lilia ignores her and turns to Rio instead, brows raised. “<em> She’s </em> your boss?”</p><p>Rio nods slowly, throat suddenly dry.</p><p>Lilia’s smile fades entirely. What’s left looks a lot like disappointment, maybe even a little betrayal. She looks at Rio like she’s trying to make sense of something, and whatever it is, it makes Rio want to disappear into the floor.</p><p>Agatha watches them both like she’s already done the math. “I take it I’ve come up in conversation,” she chirps, and where she’s getting this much confidence from, Rio has no idea. “All flattering, I hope?”</p><p>Lilia’s smile returns, but this time it’s cold and a little disbelieving. She turns fully to Agatha. </p><p>“Oh, you wouldn’t believe it, Harkness.”</p><hr/><p>Monday rolls around, and Rio’s juggling four cups of coffee and tea, doing her best not to spill any when Mary Jane Watson suddenly bursts out of the elevator, shoulders shaking and bawling her eyes out.</p><p>Rio nudges Darcy with her elbow as she passes a cup. “What happened to her?”</p><p>“Lilia, the Oracle, turned her down. Didn’t even let her inside her house. Slammed the door right in her face and left her standing in the rain for hours,” Darcy says, taking her drink. “Told you, whoever gets stuck with that task is doomed. Even picture-perfect MJ never stood a chance.”</p><p>“I heard she even called her a hack and a washed-up gossip columnist,” Bob mumbles, clutching his cup. “And, um, I think Agatha might’ve said something even worse just now. Poor Mary Jane.”</p><p>Rio winces. She suddenly remembers the look on Lilia’s face when she came eye to eye with Agatha after all those years. Yeah, poor Mary Jane. She indeed never stood a damn chance.</p><p>“Wait. Is Agatha firing her?”</p><p>“She wouldn’t be crying like that if she wasn’t,” Shuri mutters, already typing away. “Jesus, I hope I don’t get that assignment. I actually like my job.”</p><p>Rio looks over to where Mary Jane is silently shoving her things into a cardboard box. Her mascara’s halfway down her cheeks. They weren’t exactly close, but Rio still feels bad. She’s about to say something to her when Melina appears at their cubicle.</p><p>“Rio. What are you working on right now?”</p><p>She scrambles to minimize the browser tabs and pulls up her draft. </p><p>“Uh, I’m working on a piece about the underground designers who crashed the Faeber Runway. Still on the first draft. Just need one more decent quote before—” </p><p>“Drop it and give it to Bob,” Melina cuts her off. “That alright with you, Bob?”</p><p>Bob nods a little too fast. His cheeks go pink. “Y-Yeah. Sure.” </p><p>Then Melina turns back to Rio. “Agatha wants to see you. Come with me.”</p><p>All three of her coworkers look up at once, eyes wide.</p><p>“Did she say why?”</p><p>“Did Jesus say how he turned water into wine?” Melina deadpans.</p><p>Fair enough. Agatha usually makes her own calls anyway. Half the people who work with her can’t even tell what the hell’s going on in that mind of hers.</p><p>Rio follows Melina to the elevator, and they ride in silence to the top floor. When they reach Agatha’s office, the woman herself is standing at the window, back to the door. She doesn’t turn until they’re inside.</p><p>“There you are,” Agatha says. Then she turns to Melina. “You can leave us, Melina. Thank you.”</p><p>Melina only gives Agatha a look Rio can’t quite read before nodding and walking out. </p><p>Whatever it was, Rio doesn’t like it one bit.</p><p>Agatha turns back to the window. </p><p>“Do you want something to drink? Water? Coffee? I can have Jen bring your usual tea, if you’d like.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “I’m good. I just had one downstairs.”</p><p>Agatha nods but doesn’t say anything for a moment, just keeps watching the city outside.</p><p>This isn’t going to be one of those conversations, is it? Where Rio just stands around waiting for Agatha to finally talk. So she lets out an impatient sigh. “Why am I here, Agatha?”</p><p>Her boss’s shoulders rise and fall in a slow breath. </p><p>“Lilia agreed to an exclusive interview with the magazine.”</p><p>Rio thinks back to Mary Jane bawling downstairs. </p><p>“And what’s that got to do with me? Didn’t Mary Jane already—?”</p><p>“Miss Watson has formally dropped the assignment, and her position at the company,” Agatha says, finally getting to the point as she turns to face her. “Lilia has agreed to grant Nocturne the exclusive, but only under one condition — that you handle the interview and write the piece. No one else. Just you.”</p><p>Rio blinks. “Me? Why me?”</p><p>“It seems you’ve made quite an impression on her, and from my experience, that’s no easy feat. But somehow, you managed it, whatever it is you did. And now the magazine has to follow her terms. Even if you haven’t done a piece like this before, I have no choice but to assign it to you.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth goes dry. Agatha’s right. She’s never written anything like this. And she’s not stupid. She knows this is basically a world exclusive. A story that could tip the scales for the magazine’s reputation.</p><p>Agatha takes a step closer, eyes on Rio like she’s trying to say more than what the words will let her. </p><p>“This is important, Rio. Really important. To the magazine, and to me. And I’m not trying to dump any pressure on you, I swear I’m not. And if I had any other option, I wouldn’t—” she quickly stops herself. “But maybe Lilia’s terms are weirdly working in our favor, because if there’s anyone here I trust to pull this off, it’s you.” She hesitates, bites her bottom lip, then tries again. “I just need to know, do you think you can do this? Can I count on you?”</p><hr/><p>Agatha’s words still echo in Rio’s head as the company car pulls up outside Lilia Calderu’s brownstone, four days later. </p><p>Rio had done all the research she could: dug through old interviews, combed through dusty archives, even pulled a quote from a fashion spread in Vogue Italia that Lilia probably gave in passing back in the nineties. Darcy, Bob, and Shuri had all helped, though not without giving her a look before she headed out. The kind that said <em> good luck </em> and <em> you're gonna need it </em> without saying a word.</p><p>But really, what could go wrong? Lilia had seemed kind enough at the park. Warm, even. Okay, sure, maybe she hadn’t known at the time that Rio worked for Agatha, but would that really change things? </p><p>Alice had offered two theories over beer and cold pizza the night before. One: Lilia was out for revenge. Against Nocturne and by extension, Agatha Harkness. And Rio, unfortunately, was just going to be collateral damage. But Rio didn’t buy it. Lilia didn’t strike her as the vengeful type. </p><p>Which left her with theory two, the one Rio is now clinging to for dear life: that maybe Lilia had simply enjoyed her company that day in the park, and that maybe she’d seen something in Rio that made her want Rio to be the one to do this interview and write this piece, and no one else.</p><p>“I’d offer you coffee, but I can’t in good conscience serve you anything that tastes like motor oil,” Lilia says with a dry smile as they settle into the living room, teacup in hand. “Coffee here in America has never quite suited my taste.” She then gestures for Rio to relax. “Make yourself comfortable. I’ve got about an hour before I’m dragged into another meeting. Seems like a lot of people caught wind that I’m not staying in New York past the weekend, so they’re trying to squeeze in whatever they can.”</p><p>“You’re not staying?” Rio asks as she pulls her notepad from her bag.</p><p>“Did you really think I came back to New York for good, like everyone else?” Lilia laughs, shaking her head. “My life’s not here anymore, kid. I only attended the gala because my granddaughter’s one of the newest ballerinas. She’s always been a beautiful dancer, our <em> piccola cigno </em>, even when she was little. Left Italy to chase her dreams. How could I say no to that?”</p><p>Rio nods and flips through her notepad of questions. She’s just about to speak when Lilia beats her to it. </p><p>“Oh, sweetheart, put that notepad away. I’m not answering anything you’ve written there. Not if you want this interview to actually happen. I want this to feel like a real conversation, like what we had at the park. That wasn’t so hard, was it?”</p><p>“I, uh, I’m sorry. Of course, we can do that,” Rio stammers, unable to meet her interviewee’s eyes. </p><p>For Pete’s sake, she’s about to screw this up big time. </p><p>She can even practically see Agatha’s disappointed look from miles away.</p><p>“You’re not nervous, are you?” Lilia asks, watching her closely, but not unkindly.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snap up. </p><p>“What? No. I mean…” She groans and gives up. There’s no point in pretending when it’s written all over her face. “Okay, yes. To be honest, I’m really nervous. I haven’t done anything even close to this before. I mean, I did interviews back in college, but those were with student council officers, alumni who ran cafés, local politicians, labor organizers. You, on the other hand, are world-famous. And I didn’t even realize who you were at first, which makes me feel like the biggest idiot alive.”</p><p>She watches Lilia’s mouth twitch but she blabbers on. </p><p>“Why did you even pick me, Lilia? And why our magazine, considering…” She trails off.</p><p>“So you’ve read the infamous article,” Lilia supplies. “The one your <em> amore </em> so mercilessly wrote.”</p><p>Rio flinches. “Agatha is not my—” She cuts herself off and sighs. There’s no point in arguing either. “I did. I read it. I also had to, so I could prepare myself for this. And, well, curiosity got the best of me.”</p><p>“Oh, stop that. Don’t look so guilty. Curiosity’s what keeps the world turning, kid. The rest just sit around waiting to be fed,” Lilia explains vaguely. Then she looks at Rio like she’s figuring her out. “So, since you have read it, what did you think of the article?” </p><p>Rio looks back at her, puzzled. </p><p>Wasn’t she supposed to be the one doing the interview, not the other way around? </p><p>Still, she clears her throat.</p><p>“I’ve actually been thinking about it, and I think it was brutal,” she drawls. “Brutal in a way only Agatha can be.” Lilia nods and Rio hesitates, but pushes forward. “But if you’re asking what I really think of it...I also think it was honest. The kind of honesty only someone like her is capable of. And perhaps, someone bold enough to say it to a person who actually needs to hear it.”</p><p>Rio questions whether starting the interview with such honesty was a wise idea. She sees Lilia's expression change into something unreadable, brows up, lips slightly open, and braces herself to be kicked out of the brownstone at any time. But then Lilia gives her a knowing nod.</p><p>“I never actually liked that article,” she says. “Read it once. Couldn’t bear to read it again.”</p><p>Rio tries not to visibly sweat, though her underarms are dangerously close to betrayal.</p><p>“But maybe that’s just human nature. We don’t like the truth when it’s thrown in our faces,” she continues, taking a sip of her tea. “What Agatha wrote, brutal, as you called it, made me realize there’s more to life than the glitter and noise of fashion. That world…it was very exciting, yes, but it was also an illusion. At least, for me. They called me the Oracle, yet I couldn’t even see my own marriage falling apart, or my children slipping away from me,” she says somberly. </p><p>“I had my time in fashion. A long, glorious run. But Agatha, bless her sharp tongue, reminded me that maybe it’s time I did just as well in the other aspects of my life. And now, I finally am.”</p><p>Rio just stares at her, trying to catch up with everything she’s just heard. But Lilia goes on. </p><p>The interview, which was only supposed to last an hour, ends up stretching into the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>At some point, Lilia cancels all her scheduled meetings and tells Rio to stay. She gives her a full tour of the brownstone, four floors and nearly six thousand square feet of fashion history and personal relics, then leads her through photo albums she’s had for decades. </p><p>They’re stacked in drawers, lined on bookshelves, tucked behind glass cases. Page after page of Lilia’s life, with her running commentary full of warmth, bite, and all the little details only she would remember. </p><p>She talks about her two children, both now living quiet lives back in Sicily. One of her grandchildren even calls during the tour, and Rio gets a glimpse of the villa Lilia has in the Italian countryside: sunlit, peaceful, and nothing like the world she once ruled, but fitting for the woman she’s become.</p><p>What Rio also gets to see are Lilia’s old sketches, designs she never had the chance to bring to life during her reclusive years in Italy. Some are delicate and romantic, others bold and strange in ways Rio wouldn’t have expected. She tells Lilia how stunning they are, how full of feeling, and admits that even though she’s never been a fan of skirts, she’d wear one of them in a heartbeat.</p><p>Since Lilia hasn’t allowed photographers into her home, she lets Rio take photos on her phone, on the condition that nothing unflattering makes it to print. Now Rio can only hope the editors back at Nocturne can turn her iPhone shots into something worthy of the pages they will publish.</p><p>It’s already dark outside when Lilia walks her out after a delicious dinner, the company car waiting at the curb. “I might want a word with your beloved tyrant of a boss before the piece goes to print. Can you arrange that for me, Rio?” she asks as they step outside.</p><p>“Of course. I’ll let her know,” Rio says, tucking her hands into her coat pockets against the chilly air. She’s just thanked Lilia for the interview and the meal when the older woman calls her back.</p><p>“Let me be honest, kid. Don’t let it get to your head, but it’s rare for me to like someone this quickly. But it also doesn’t take much for me to know you’re a good egg. I gave your magazine this exclusive, mainly because of that. Because of you. Make sure they know that. And you should know too, you’ve earned whatever comes from this. Maybe even more. And fine, maybe a smidge because of Agatha, though I still think she’s the biggest pain in the ass this side of the Atlantic.”</p><p>She waves a hand, like brushing off lint, while Rio just stands there trying to process.</p><p>“But if someone like you ended up falling for her, maybe she’s not all storm and undertow after all. Just be careful, though. Sometimes the thing you think is anchoring you is actually the thing pulling you under. Don’t let that happen to you. And if she really feels the same way, she won’t let it. She’ll let you swim.”</p><hr/><p>It’s creeping past nine when Rio steps out of the company car, her bones tired but her heart electric. </p><p>The day had gone better than she could’ve expected, from something that started with nerves and ended with laughter, tea, dinner, and someone she hadn’t expected to like so damn much. </p><p>She mumbles thanks to the driver, still grinning as she turns toward the apartment, only to stop short as a familiar black car rolls up to the curb.</p><p>“About time,” drawls a familiar voice as the tinted window slides down. “I was starting to think you’d been held hostage by that wispy old witch. What’d she do, start the story from the day she was born? Javier’s circled your neighborhood so many times he could probably give guided tours by now.”</p><p>Rio squints at the car like it might be a hallucination. “God forbid someone actually enjoyed my company.” She crosses her arms. “What the hell are you even doing here, Agatha? Is this a new hobby of yours? Pulling drive-by check-ins on your employees?”</p><p>“Just get in,” Agatha demands, suddenly clipped and imperious as ever.</p><p>“I’m actually kind of beat. Can we just do this tomorrow?”</p><p>“I said get in.”</p><p>Rio stares her down, weighing at least a hundred different ways to tell her where to shove that bossy tone. She’s halfway through picking the juiciest Italian curse she learned from Lilia when Agatha says something that stops her cold. Two words she’s never heard come out of her mouth in the same breath.</p><p>“Please, Rio.”</p><hr/><p>“Where are you even taking me?” Rio complains as she sinks into the backseat beside Agatha, keeping the usual few inches of distance between them. “I’m not kidding about being tired. Whatever this is, please make it quick. I had a really long day and all I want is to sleep in an actual bed.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha agrees calmly. “That’s why I’m bringing you to my estate in Scarsdale. We’re taking the team there tomorrow, and you’ll be writing Lilia’s feature from there.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, what?”</p><p>“Did you really think I’d risk leaving you and that exclusive sitting in your apartment, just waiting to fall into the wrong hands?” Agatha stares at her and smiles. That rare, full smile of hers. It’s the kind that says she’s thoroughly enjoying the confusion written all over Rio’s face. “I’d never let that happen.”</p><p>Rio squints at her. “I still don’t get the exact reason why I have to write it at your estate,” she says, dragging out the last word and pretending to gag at how rich it sounds.</p><p>“I have a feeling Valentina’s already sniffed out that we landed Lilia’s exclusive,” Agatha says simply. “And I don’t want her hovering around you for it. Now, is that enough reason?”</p><p>“Why would you even worry? Don’t you trust me?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t even hesitate.</p><p>“Of course I trust you. It’s the people who’ll be trying to get close to you that I don’t.”</p><p>The rest of the drive passes with Rio holding out her phone and Agatha hunched slightly toward it, scrolling through the photos Rio had taken earlier. </p><p>She talks her boss through each one, where it was taken, what Lilia had said, and how some of the shots might actually work as cover options with a little help from Nocturne’s layout team. </p><p>But what Rio’s really enjoying is the look on Agatha’s face, wide-eyed, lips parting every now and then in something close to awe, completely taken by the photos, especially the ones of Lilia’s unseen and unreleased designs, carefully laid out like memories across a worktable. Rio watches her with a kind of smug delight. It’s not every day you get to see Agatha Harkness look like a kid in a candy store.</p><p>Rio had half-joked that Lilia’s designs were basically Taylor Swift’s vault tracks in fashion form, only to be met with a blank stare from Agatha, like she’d just been spoken to in Morse code. </p><p>Rio had nearly choked from laughing. Of course her nearly forty-year-old, chronically offline, pop culture-dodging boss wouldn’t know the sacred language of Swiftie lore.</p><p>It doesn’t escape Rio how easily they’ve slipped back into the familiar intimacy they had before the firing, the arguments in the streets, and all the awkward, avoidant stares. Whatever resentment or leftover anger she still has toward her boss is suddenly gone. And maybe she should hate herself for that. But right now, hearing Agatha laugh and seeing her smile, Rio doesn’t even care.</p><p>“She really said we can publish these?” Agatha grabs the phone from Rio and scrolls to another image. Her eyes widen. “Why the hell is Lilia keeping all these designs in her archives? Oh, I would kill to wear this.” She’s referring to a sharp, architectural piece with a plunging neckline and sculpted shoulders. </p><p>“She signed the release forms and gave us full permission to publish all the photos I took, as long as nothing unflattering makes it to print. She also asked for physical copies once the story’s out. And she also wants a private word with you before it runs.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look away from the screen. “Did she say why?”</p><p>“Nope. Guess you’ll have to call her.”</p><p>“I’ll have Jen set that up.”</p><p>She swipes again and pauses. The next photo shows Lilia holding one of her old, unreleased designs, looking at it like she’s just remembered a part of herself. But instead of looking sad, she’s smiling, bright and real. There’s also something unguarded about her in the picture, something almost youthful. Like the years had peeled back for a second. </p><p>“This is the one. This should be the cover,” Agatha says, touching the screen. “It might take a bit of work to get the quality print-ready, but our editors can work magic when they want to.” She lingers on the photo, then turns to Rio with a soft, almost bashful smile. “But these are beautiful, Rio. I hope you know just how incredible your work is. You should be really proud.” </p><p>Rio is thankful it’s sort of dark inside the car, otherwise, Agatha would definitely see how red her face is from blushing. She takes the phone back from her, their fingers brushing for a second too long before she slips it into her bag. But when she looks up, Agatha is still watching her with that same proud look. Then something passes over her face, like a sudden, loud thought, and she quickly looks away.</p><p>Rio, who’s learned the language of Agatha’s tells and micro-reactions, squints at her.</p><p>“What is it?” </p><p>“Nothing.” Agatha shakes her head. “Just a thought. I’ll tell you once we’re at my place.”</p><p>Agatha’s Scarsdale estate turns out to be a modern two-story house, maybe four thousand square feet, with sleek black-framed windows and a pale gray brick exterior that glows under the porch lights. The front garden is a patch of lawn wide enough to host a wedding, and a few Japanese maples scattered like curated brushstrokes. </p><p>It’s simpler and a bit smaller than Agatha’s family estate in Morris County, but Rio still knows she can’t even begin to guess how much this all costs.</p><p>“The guest room’s at the far end of the hall. That’s where you’ll be,” Agatha explains as she leads the way through a quick tour. “My room is on the opposite end.” Rio immediately frowns at that. It’s not a long walk, exactly, but it feels too far for her liking. But she doesn’t say anything.</p><p>“If you need anything later, just knock,” Agatha adds without looking back. She pauses at a linen closet halfway down the hall and opens it. “Extra blankets in here, it gets very cold in the early mornings. There are toiletries in the bathroom. Towels. Hairdryer’s in the cabinet under the sink. And I already had my housekeeper leave a few sets of clothes on the bed. That is…if you don’t mind wearing some of mine.”</p><p>Rio pauses for half a beat, her brain snagging on the image of her in Agatha’s clothes. “I don’t mind,” she replies. Then adds, with just enough bite to hide the flutter in her chest, “Though if you had let me pack earlier and, I don’t know, not basically kidnapped me and dragged me here, that wouldn’t be necessary.”</p><p>Agatha just rolls her eyes and keeps walking.</p><p>“The whole team’s getting here tomorrow at ten. You’ll have enough time to rest before the madness starts. And make no mistake, it will be utter madness.” She stops at the end of the hall, turning to face Rio. “I’ve put the entire print schedule on hold for this piece. That means every department is waiting on you. Including me. You get to call the shots now, Rio. But you’re on a very inflexible deadline. You still think you can handle that?”</p><p>Rio takes a breath. The nerves are still there, sure, but so is something else. A buzz in her chest that feels a lot like readiness. She already knows how she wants to shape the piece. She can feel the bones of it settling into place. She’s never written a feature on someone before, especially not someone in fashion, but she can be passionate and perceptive if she puts her mind to it. </p><p>And that interview with Lilia had been one of the most meaningful, and unexpectedly enjoyable, interviews she’d ever done. It did something to her. Loosened a knot she hadn’t even realized was there. And now, all she wants is to chase that feeling. Put every bit of it into words.</p><p>“I’ve got it,” she says. “Just make sure the coffee and tea keep coming tomorrow.” </p><p>Agatha gives her another one of her rare smiles and opens the guest room door. </p><p>“Here you are. I better leave you to it,” she exhales. But just before turning to leave, she adds, “Rio, I hope you know how big this is for the magazine. And how much of that is because of you. De Fontaine can shove her numbers up her smug little binder once your piece drops. I honestly can’t wait to see her face if she even thinks about competing.” She steps back. “Anyway, if you need me, I’ll be downstairs.”</p><p>Rio watches her disappear down the hall toward the stairs, still stuck on that weirdly soft little paroxysm in Agatha’s piercing blue eyes. </p><p>It might actually be the happiest she’s looked since Rio came back to Nocturne. Like something dangerous in her had finally lit up again. The thrill of the kill. </p><p>And, annoyingly, Rio finds that stupidly attractive.</p><hr/><p>Rio takes a quick shower, letting the hot water wash off the long day. After, she slips into one of Agatha’s matching flannel pajama sets. They look barely worn, but they still carry that faint lavender scent that clings to Agatha. She blow-dries her short hair, then gathers what she can into a half-hearted ponytail before heading downstairs, the sleeves of the pajama top brushing past her knuckles as she goes.</p><p>She finds no sign of Agatha. Maybe she’s upstairs getting ready for bed or in the shower. So Rio wanders into the living room. It’s all too tidy but a little colder than she expected, probably because the fireplace isn’t lit. Shelves line the far wall, filled with books. Some titles she recognizes, others she doesn’t. </p><p>On top of the cabinet under the window are framed pictures, but not the kind you’d normally see in someone’s house. There are no baby photos of Agatha, no family portraits.</p><p>Most of the photos are with people from the industry, smiling at cover launches, clinking glasses at packed events, caught mid-laugh in some dimly lit office. </p><p>There’s one of her as a fresh-faced intern at a publishing house called Coven Press, then a few more from her early days as a writer at Nocturne. And finally, several with Stark, but this time with her name on the masthead: Editor-in-Chief.</p><p>Rio takes it all in. Agatha had come a long way, despite her filthy rich background, despite the easy assumptions people probably made about her. And unlike the usual nepotism babies Rio knew, Agatha had actually worked her ass off to get to the top. </p><p>She fought her way up, earning every inch of it.</p><p>Then it dawns on her, how much trust Agatha’s putting in her now. How she hasn’t even heard the full interview. How she’s only seen the photos. How Rio isn’t even sure Agatha’s ever read a single thing she’s written. And yet somehow, she believes Rio can do it.</p><p>Her chest aches at the thought, and a sudden rush of sadness and something bitter creeps in before she can stop it. She scowls, dragging her hands down her face. She should be celebrating. So why does it feel like something’s sinking in her gut? What the hell is going on with her?</p><p>Rio sinks into the couch and pulls out her phone, scrolling through the quotes from Lilia she’d jotted down in her notes app. When she’d typed them out, she hadn’t expected the night to bend into whatever this was now. But then it hits her, Agatha had been saying it all along, in the way she looked at her, in every little thing she said since the car ride and the second they walked through her door.</p><p>She got the job at Nocturne hoping that one day, Agatha would give her a recommendation, something that could get her into any publication she wanted. </p><p>Rio isn’t dumb. With Lilia’s story right in front of her, she knows this could be her ticket out. Once she finishes the article, she could finally leave Nocturne and go after whatever dream she had before Agatha came into the picture.</p><p>And she knows Agatha knows that too. </p><p>That’s probably why she looked a little weighed down back at the office when she gave Rio the assignment. But she still gave it to her, knowing it might mean letting her go once it’s all done.</p><p>A sound pulls her out of her thoughts, and when she looks up, the very conundrum at the center of her tangled mess of feelings is standing in the threshold, watching her. </p><p>She’s already changed into an adorable set of Gucci pajamas, holding a glass of red wine in one hand and a black folder in the other.</p><p>“So,” Agatha says, “you finally figured it out.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer. She just watches as Agatha walks over and takes the seat across from her.</p><p>“I knew I had to let you go the second Lilia called and said she wanted you to write her piece. I’m not even sure what really got into me, bringing you here. Perhaps part of it was I wanted to secure the exclusive, but mostly, I think I just wanted to see you one last time, like this…by my side.”</p><p>“You know, I don’t even have to quit,” Rio says quickly, trying to piece her thoughts back together. “I mean, sure, I’ve got other doors open for me now, I know that. But I could still be working for you—” </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha stops her. “Why did you take the job as my assistant months ago? And please don’t say it was for my warm and charming personality, we both know you had no clue who I was before you applied.”</p><p>Rio gives a weak laugh, then looks down. “Because I wouldn’t have picked Drive Monthly even if someone had a gun to my head, or hell, a knife to my throat.”</p><p>“Cute.” Agatha mirrors her laugh. “But I’m being serious. Be honest. You already answered this once, if I remember right.”</p><p>Rio sighs. </p><p>“It just made sense at the time, okay? Working for you looked really great on paper. It’s a solid line on my resume, and Nocturne’s one of the best. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try it out, even if it was just for a year.”</p><p>“Is that it?” </p><p>“I also hoped I’d get on your good side and maybe earn a recommendation, though I found out later that’s extremely rare, since you barely ever give those.” </p><p>“All my employees hope for that. But why did you even want mine?”</p><p>“Because you’re Agatha freaking Harkness. Your name’s like a press pass to anywhere. If I had your reference, I could land a writing job at The Times, or pretty much anywhere I wanted.”</p><p>Agatha nods slowly. “Exactly. Which is why I’m telling you something I’ve never told anyone who worked for me before.” She leans in. “You no longer need my name, Rio. And you don’t need me.”</p><p>
<em> No. I do. </em>
</p><p>The words hover on Rio’s tongue, but she swallows them back. </p><p>She turns Agatha’s words over in her head. Is she right? Yes, probably. Why would Rio even go back to writing about things she barely cares about, when what she really wants is to chase stories that truly matter to her, to do the kind of journalism she’s dreamed of since she was a kid?</p><p>The truth is brutal and unpleasant, worse than getting fired right then and there. Sure, she always meant to leave the magazine eventually. But now the thought of not seeing Agatha anymore, of not being in her orbit, of not being around her all the time, hurt more than she wanted to admit.</p><p>She tries to smile, but it barely holds, and she looks away. </p><p>Agatha sets down the folder and a pen on the table between them. </p><p>“I had Jen draw this up earlier. It outlines how you’ll move forward with Lilia’s story. I went through it myself to make sure you have full creative control. The final edits and what gets published are completely up to you. You can have a lawyer review it if you want, but for now, take your time reading through it.”</p><p>Rio flips through the pages, scanning the legal terms. The agreement grants her full ownership and copyright of the article, even if she parts ways with Nocturne. The payment also extremely exceeds her expectations, enough to give her a real shot if she decides to go freelance afterward.</p><p>And this is exactly what Rio’s been wanting all her life, isn’t it? It’s the most sensible thing anyone can do when they’re finally, finally chasing their dreams.</p><p>
<em> Sometimes the thing you think is anchoring you is actually the thing pulling you under. Don’t let that happen to you.  </em>
</p><p>She looks down at the pen and the contract, fully aware that Agatha gave it to her knowing exactly what’s inside and what it all means. It seems Agatha has quietly taken care of everything for Rio, making sure the road ahead is hers to choose.</p><p>
<em> And if she really feels the same way, she won’t let it. She’ll let you swim. </em>
</p><p>Rio picks up the pen.</p><p>“Are you really sure about this?” Agatha asks.</p><p>There’s something in her voice that makes Rio stop and look up. She’s seen that look before, right after closing a deal with an investor or winning an argument against Stark or some other hardheaded shareholder, when Agatha lights up with pride and that unstoppable fire. But this time, there’s something else underneath, like an unspoken sadness. </p><p>Could it be that even her boss, who everyone swears is Satan’s mistress, might actually feel a little hurt? Would she even miss Rio as much as Rio’s going to miss her?</p><p>Rio gives herself a mental slap. She’s clearly imagining things. Why would Agatha miss her, after letting her go once and now doing it all over again? No. Agatha Harkness doesn’t miss people. The thought almost makes her laugh, but she shoves it down.</p><p>She skims the contract one last time, nods at Agatha, then signs.</p><p>
<em>She will miss her.</em>
</p><hr/><p>The rest of the night stretches in the living room, scattered with bits of conversation. </p><p>Rio talks loosely about the tone she already has in mind for the piece, and how for once, she’s actually excited for people to read it. </p><p>Somewhere between that, she also drifts into stories about Lilia’s time in Sicily: how she allegedly scammed someone out of his Vespa, and started a limoncello business with a nun. None of it had anything to do with fashion, and definitely not what you’d expect from someone like Lilia Calderu.</p><p>At one point, as their knees nearly touch on the couch, Agatha laughs and says, “I still don’t get it. How someone that private, basically a hermit for fifteen years, just opens up to you and starts telling absurd stories like that after two meetings. Not many people in this industry have that kind of pull and charm. I didn’t even get that close when I interviewed her. You’ve got a gift, Rio. No doubt about it.”</p><p>Rio, who’s never quite known what to do with compliments, especially the rare, genuine kind from her boss, keeps her eyes on her glass and hides the heat rising to her cheeks by gripping it a little too tightly.</p><p>“I don’t know about that. Maybe Lilia’s just easy to talk to. Turns out she’s kind of a professional rambler.” She takes a sip of the wine. It’s rich, velvety, and tasting unmistakably like wealth. “Jesus. I think you’ve officially ruined beer and cheap liquor for me because nothing else is ever going to come close.”</p><p>Agatha swirls her wine. </p><p>“Consider it a rite of passage. You’ll be drinking more of that once you start landing bigger writing jobs, whatever publication you set your sights on. After Lilia’s story drops, people won’t just be knocking at your door. They’ll be chasing you. And not just editors, either. You might not know this, but a lot of very attractive women in the industry get something close to an orgasm from a smartly written piece.”</p><p>Rio almost chokes, sputtering into her glass. “You’re not even a hundred percent sure how the article’s going to turn out. What if it’s not even that smartly written, like you put it?”</p><p>“Oh, I’ve never been sure of anything in my life.” She smiles at her again, and maybe it’s the wine talking, but it takes a lot of effort for Rio not to lean in and kiss her. “But I meant what I said. After this exclusive, there’ll be a line just for you. And more than a few of them will want you in their bed within twenty-four hours of it going live. You’ll have options laid out like a buffet. All you’ll have to do is pick.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t want women lining up for me,” Rio admits, setting her glass down. “And besides, I already know who I want in my bed. I’m just not sure if that person feels the same.” It comes out so honest, so bare, that the silence that follows feels thick and too loud. She instantly regrets letting the thought slip. “I mean, realistically, with the work I’ve got ahead of me, I probably won’t be in anyone’s bed anytime soon anyway,” she adds, with a small, self-conscious smile.</p><p>Rio immediately catches Agatha’s expression of surprise. She clears her throat, also sets her glass down, and taps her knees once before standing. “I suppose it’s getting late. And it’s going to be a very big day tomorrow. Especially for you. And trust me, you don’t want to face what’s coming with a hangover.” </p><p>“Right. We should probably get some rest.”</p><p>Rio stands and gathers their glasses, heading to the kitchen. Agatha follows quietly, tidying up a few things along the way. Rio washes the glasses while Agatha dries them with a cloth and places them back where they belong. Once everything’s taken care of, they walk upstairs together. </p><p>At the top landing, just as they’re about to part ways, Agatha calls out to her.</p><p>She exhales slowly. “I know you haven’t fully wrapped your head around it yet. But you have absolutely no idea what you’ve managed to do, how you somehow waltzed in and pulled off the kind of story most writers chase for decades. This is going to change everything for you, Rio. It’ll make your career.”</p><p>She pauses, then looks at Rio in a way that steals the air from her lungs. “I’d be lying if I said I’m not a little jealous of everyone else getting to have you after this. I really wish I could’ve kept you by my side just a little longer. But that wouldn’t be fair, to you or to me. You’re meant for more, Rio. And they’re all about to find out just how brilliant you are. I just hope you already know.”</p><p>Rio is speechless after hearing those words from Agatha. Something about it makes everything feel more real, how close morning is, how close she is to everything she’s worked for. In just a few hours, she’ll be chasing her dreams. And that also means leaving Agatha behind, at least a little.</p><p>Maybe they’ll still see each other now and then. Maybe they’ll stay in touch. But Rio would be lying if she said that’s all she wants. She doesn’t want glimpses or quick hellos in passing. She wants more. She wants Agatha — all the time, if the world would just let her.</p><p>She’s been sucked into Agatha’s orbit for a while now, drawn in, held there, like gravity had a name and it was hers. And now, with everything changing so suddenly, the thought of breaking free, of drifting out into the world without that pull anchoring her, terrifies her more than she wants to admit. </p><p>Rio is not sure she can do it. She’s not even sure she wants to try.</p><p>“Agatha,” she calls after her as she starts to walk in the other direction.</p><p>When Agatha turns, all the noise in Rio’s head falls away, leaving just one thing.</p><p>She incontinently crosses the space between them and, without a second thought, claims her lips. It’s nothing like the quick, unsure kiss they shared before. This one is full and deep, her lips parting against Agatha’s. She hears her gasp softly into it, and that sound alone nearly knocks the breath out of her.</p><p>To Rio’s surprise and utter delight, Agatha kisses her back just as fiercely, as if she’s wanted this too, maybe for just as long. And for one breathless moment, Rio stops thinking. She lets herself fall, completely and without fear, lets herself be taken under by it. By her.</p><p>Rio has no idea how long the kiss lasted, only that when Agatha slowly pulls back, everything feels different. Rio opens her eyes, heart hammering, and looks at her nervously. But Agatha doesn’t look shaken like Rio expected her to be. She doesn’t even look like she regrets any of it.</p><p>If anything, she looks sure.</p><p>She lifts a hand and gently cups Rio’s face, her thumb brushing softly across her cheek.</p><p>Then she gives a small, warm smile. </p><p>“Get some sleep. I’ll see you in the morning.”</p><p>And with that, Agatha turns and walks away, leaving Rio frozen in place, heart pounding, thoughts rushing back in. But for the first time since she got here, her thoughts are evident and clear.</p><p>
<em> Agatha will miss her, too. </em>

<p>Rio wakes up without really knowing how she fell asleep after everything that happened last night.</p><p>She grabs her phone to check the time. A little past eight. The team’s not arriving until ten, so she has at least an hour to brace herself for the madness Agatha warned her about.</p><p>Which, of course, brings Agatha right back into her thoughts.</p><p>How Agatha had assured her the article was going to be great, even though she hadn’t fully heard the interview or gone through Rio’s notes. </p><p>How she kept saying, almost too many times, how proud she was of her: in her words, in the way she looked at her, and of course, in the kiss they shared.</p><p>She lifts her fingers to her lips, almost without thinking. </p><p>And for a second, it feels like the phantom of Agatha’s kiss is still there, the kind of kiss that could’ve been a dream, if not for the way her heart still stumbles at the memory.</p><p>Then her eyes land on the door, slightly ajar, even though she clearly remembers closing it last night. </p><p>Had Agatha come to check on her while she was still sleeping? Rio swallows, feeling the blush creep up her neck. God, she hopes she wasn’t drooling if Agatha really did come in. </p><p>Hearing faint rustling from downstairs through the narrow gap, she swings her legs off the bed and pads out.</p><p>She expects to find Agatha, but stops short when she walks into the kitchen and sees a woman, probably a bit older than Lilia, standing by the stove, flipping something that smells surprisingly good.</p><p>Rio hesitates at the doorway, unsure whether to step back before the woman mistakes her for a burglar.</p><p>But before she can retreat, the woman speaks without turning. “I take it you slept well?” She finally glances over her shoulder and catches Rio mid-step, looking exactly like a kid caught sneaking snacks.</p><p>“You must be Rio,” the woman adds, gesturing to the tall chair across the kitchen counter. “Go on, have a seat. I’m almost done with breakfast. There’s fresh tea in that pot if you want it. But Agatha said you prefer coffee in the mornings, so help yourself to the other one.”</p><p>Still half-asleep and thoroughly confused, Rio perches on the tall chair, now wondering two things: Where the hell is Agatha? And who is this warm, sprightly older woman talking to her like they’ve known each other for years, or at least like she knows exactly who Rio is?</p><p>“Oh, for heaven’s sake! I’m so sorry, where are my manners?” the woman says with a laugh. “I’m Susan, but Agatha calls me Marmee, so feel free to do the same if you’d like.” She throws Rio a quick grin over her shoulder. “I live in that very average-looking house across the street,” she adds with a playful wink. “I’d come over and shake your hand, or give you a big old hug, but I’d rather not burn your breakfast on our very first meeting.”</p><p>Rio blinks, still trying to catch up, but before she can say anything, Marmee’s already talking again. “How do you like your eggs?” she asks, as if they’ve done this a dozen times before.</p><p>Rio opens her mouth, then closes it again. Still processing.</p><p>“Scrambled or sunny side?” Marmee prompts, waving her spatula.</p><p>Rio clears her throat. “Sunny side, please. Thank you.”</p><p>Marmee hums, as if that was the right answer, and turns back to the stove.</p><p>Rio glances around the kitchen, then asks, “I’m sorry, but…have you seen Agatha?”</p><p>“Oh, she’s probably in her office, taking calls,” Marmee answers brightly. “She was already up when I got here.” She turns to Rio again with a smile. “Do you like jam or honey on your toast?”</p><p>“Honey’s fine,” Rio says, pouring herself a cup of coffee. </p><p>There are a dozen questions racing through her head, but she keeps them all to herself.</p><p>“You’re probably wondering why some old lady is in Agatha’s kitchen,” Marmee chuckles, and Rio flushes, a little startled she basically read her mind. “Well, brilliant as that kid is, she still can’t boil an egg to save her life. And her housekeeper’s off today. So she roped me in. Said you’re a real breakfast person and would come looking for actual food the second you woke up.” Marmee laughs again. </p><p>Rio tries not to blush, hiding behind her mug, but the thought of Agatha making sure she’s being taken care of does something to her. It’s ridiculous, and stupidly unprecedented, coming from her boss. </p><p>Making sure she’s eating properly isn’t exactly the same as giving her flowers or a love letter. And yet, somehow, the gesture feels more intimate than either.</p><p>Not wanting the silence to stretch too long, Rio blurts out a question, right as Marmee slides a plate of sunny-side-up eggs and toast in front of her. “So, how long have you known Agatha?”</p><p>“Oh, since she was a little girl,” Marmee says, turning back to the stove. “We used to live next door to her family’s estate on the Morris side. She’d sneak into our house for snacks and end up beating my husband at chess on the front porch. Drove him absolutely nuts.”</p><p>Rio can’t help the image that pops into her head, tiny Agatha, brows furrowed in concentration, completely outsmarting a grown man in a chess match.</p><p>“But then we had to sell the house,” Marmee continues. “He got sick, and we moved here to be closer to the cancer center. He never did get better, but I ended up loving the place, so I stayed.”</p><p>“I’m sorry about your husband.” </p><p>Marmee hums. “It’s alright. Wherever he is now, I just know he’s not hurting anymore. And we had good years. Real good ones.” She smiles faintly before continuing. “Anyway, a few years after he passed, Agatha bought this house. Right around the time she became something fancy at that magazine company of hers. She said she wanted a place to clear her head when the city got too loud,” Marmee adds, chuckling. “But I know better. She just missed my cooking.”</p><p>“Does she come here often?”</p><p>“Only when work really gets to her. Though she did stay here for nearly a week last month, the longest she’s stayed all year, I think. She’d drive back and forth to the city but always came home to sleep. Poor thing looked like she hadn’t rested in years.” </p><p>Rio nods and realizes it was around the same time Agatha fired her. </p><p>So Agatha had been staying here then.</p><p>She takes another sip of coffee, attempting not to think too deeply about it.</p><p>But as she looks up, Marmee is staring at her, as if she knows something about Rio that Rio has not yet figured out.</p><p>“Sorry, is there something on my face?” Rio asks, giving the older woman a shy smile. She’d be mortified if she drooled in her sleep and still had dried spit on her face, especially since she forgot to wash up before heading downstairs.</p><p>Marmee just chuckles. </p><p>“No, nothing like that. You’re just exactly how Agatha described you.”</p><p>Rio’s head perks up. “She’s been talking about me?”</p><p>“She’s mentioned you once or twice,” Marmee answers with a smile. “Said you were the first person ever to lie to her just to get out of work.” She laughs. “I think you left quite an impression after that.” </p><p>Rio winces, then laughs under her breath. </p><p>“Yeah, that was a mistake,” she admits, “but I’m not really starting to regret it now.”</p><p>“Well,” Marmee says knowingly, “you shouldn’t.”</p><p>Before Rio can dwell too long on what that means, the sound of footsteps padding across the hardwood draws her attention, and then Agatha appears in the doorway, mid-call, and everything else blurs. </p><p>She’s in a purple morning robe, soft curls falling around her face, glasses perched low on her nose. Breathtaking. Effortlessly so.</p><p>Rio swears her heart skips, or maybe stumbles. </p><p>Either way, it’s a miracle she doesn’t drop her mug right there and then. </p><p>“Then send the other transcriptionist,” Agatha snaps, waving a hand like the caller can see her. “Yes, whoever. I don’t care if it’s one person or a whole damn typing cult, just get me someone who can transcribe a five-hour interview before lunch.” She ends the call with a forceful tap and sets her phone on the counter. “I swear to God, it’s like herding lobotomized cats.”</p><p>Agatha exhales loudly through her nostrils, squeezing the bridge as if she could somehow wish patience to exist.</p><p>She doesn't even notice Rio is staring until Marmee clears her throat pointedly. </p><p>“Now, what did I tell you?” Marmee says, turning a slice of French toast in the pan. “It’s not good to start the morning with furrowed brows, young lady. You’ll scare the poor girl away.” </p><p>“Don’t worry,” Rio chuckles, lifting her mug. “I’m kind of used to it by now.” </p><p>Marmee snorts as she flips another toast. “Of course you are. You poor thing.”</p><p>“I see you two are getting along.” Agatha walks over and settles into the seat across Rio. Whatever had her all worked up seems to ease off her shoulders the second their eyes meet. “Did you sleep okay?”</p><p>Rio wants to say she barely remembers falling asleep. </p><p>That she spent hours tossing and turning, thinking about last night, and that, at one point, she even considered knocking on Agatha’s door, since the latter had told her to knock if she ever needed anything.</p><p>And Rio had needed answers. </p><p>But now, seeing how Agatha seems perfectly calm and normal about the kiss, Rio just nods and takes a sip of her coffee instead.</p><p>“I did,” she says. Then, because she needs at least one answer today, she asks, “Did you?”</p><p>Agatha appears to catch the implication underneath the question, and for a second, something small but telling slips through her calm, collected demeanor. Not enough for most people to notice, but Rio does.</p><p>Maybe because she’s been watching too closely, or maybe because she’s known for a while now how to understand the way Agatha communicates without words.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha answers softly, then reaches for the coffee pot and pours herself a mug.</p><p>Marmee seems to notice something between the two of them. Her eyes move from Rio to Agatha before she clears her throat again, turns off the stove, and sets the pan in the dishwasher. “Well, since you both look caffeinated, fed, and settled, I’m gonna go check on my Fanny.”</p><p>“Who’s Fanny?” Rio asks.</p><p>“Marmee’s dog,” Agatha says.</p><p>“She’s a very sweet Mastiff,” Marmee chimes in proudly. “Agatha adopted her from a rescue about a year ago and gave her to me. You’re welcome to swing by the house anytime if you want to say hi. Fanny loves meeting new people.”</p><p>Rio perks up again. She’s always had a soft spot for dogs, but having one was never really an option.</p><p>It was either too expensive or too cramped in their apartment, and with her and Alice both working nearly all day, it just never felt possible.</p><p>“Really? I’d love that,” she says, smiling. “I’d love to meet Fanny.”</p><p>“And Fanny would probably love to see you too,” Agatha adds. “But only after today. May I remind you, you’re about to walk into hell. I’m not letting you get distracted by a dog’s charm offensive.”</p><p>Marmee chuckles. “Agatha’s right. My Fanny can be very distracting. She’s got this one wrapped around her little paw almost every time.” Rio tries not to visibly smile at the picture of the ever-composed Agatha Harkness softening up for a floppy-eared Mastiff. </p><p>“Well,” Marmee adds, wiping her hands on a dish towel, “you two enjoy your breakfast. And good luck with whatever hell you’re walking into today.” </p><p>With that, Marmee heads out of the kitchen. Agatha murmurs a soft thanks, and Rio echoes it a beat later. </p><p>On her way out, Marmee throws Rio another look, one of those knowing, lingering ones she’s been giving her since she walked in. </p><p>And if Rio’s reading it right, it almost feels like Marmee’s the one who’s thankful for her.</p><p>As soon as they’re alone, Agatha doesn’t give the silence a chance to settle.</p><p>“Jen should be here in a few minutes. She’s coming ahead of the rest of the team. I gave her full control over what you’ll wear today.” She shoots Rio a look before the latter can protest. “Relax. I told her to keep it within the bounds of whatever it is you call comfort, and to somehow attempt to match your famously <em> impeccable </em> taste.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “What's wrong with my clothes from yesterday? Also, I couldn’t find them in my room.”</p><p>“I sent them out for laundry.”</p><p>She opens her mouth to speak, but Agatha cuts her off again. </p><p>“Don’t worry. You’ll get your precious subway clothes back by the end of the day.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t even have it in her to look annoyed. Her brain immediately stutters at the fact that Agatha did not only walk into her room, but also picked up her clothes and sent them off to be cleaned, which explains why the door had been slightly open earlier.</p><p>But what really mortifies Rio is knowing that Agatha saw her sleeping. Again. That's the third time now. And something about that feels unfair. Unbalanced. </p><p>Rio’s seen Agatha asleep twice, and she wouldn’t mind seeing that again. And again. Preferably with the two of them in the same bed, in the warm glow of morning light, perhaps with a lazy arm thrown over her waist. Agatha’s bed or hers, it doesn’t really matter. Just as long as she’s waking up beside the woman in front of her.</p><p>The same woman, sipping her coffee and going on about the day ahead, who seems completely unaware of the disarray unfolding, like last night’s kiss hadn’t completely rearranged the furniture in Rio’s brain. </p><p>She wants to bring it up. She really does. </p><p>But the more reasonable part of her is screaming that this isn’t the right time. </p><p>Today is going to be huge. </p><p>She needs every ounce of focus she can wring out of herself.</p><p>“Do you have any other specific requests besides the endless stream of coffee and tea?” </p><p>Rio blinks out of her thoughts, eyes focusing on Agatha, who’s still glued to her phone. </p><p>“Nope, that’s about it,” she says, taking a long sip of coffee. She needs to shake off the fog and wake up fast. “Wait, actually, one more thing. Think I could get a pack or two of Spirits? I’ve got a backup stash at my place, but—”</p><p>Agatha finally looks up from her phone, brows lifting.</p><p>“You smoke cigarettes?”</p><p>“Only when I’m about to write a beast of a piece. Helps me shut everything else out.”</p><p>Agatha gives her a long look, like a girlfriend catching her boyfriend sneaking a beer before noon. Then she sighs, muttering, “Fine. I’ll have Jen pick some up. But just one. And you’re not smoking it in here.” She starts typing into her phone, still grumbling. “Can’t believe you smoke that crap.”</p><p>“Says the woman who made me smoke a ten-year-old weed,” Rio shoots back, laughing under her breath.</p><p>That gets Agatha to pause for half a second. Right. That night. The first time Agatha had kissed her.</p><p>The look on Agatha’s face is enough to keep Rio from bringing up last night. And she gets it. She understands. Whatever happened between them can wait. </p><p>Today is all about business and keeping things as professional as they can manage.</p><p>“This is so good, by the way,” Rio says, pointing her fork at the French toast, eggs, and a couple strips of bacon. “Marmee just earned a spot right under Lorna for best breakfast.”</p><p>She says it half-jokingly, hoping it patches up whatever unease she might have caused.</p><p>Agatha, after all, is still technically her boss, for a few more hours.</p><p>“That’s why I keep her around.” Her lips twitches close to a smile before hiding it behind her mug.</p><p>Rio nudges the conversation elsewhere. “She mentioned you used to play chess when you were a kid.” </p><p>“I did. One of the few things my parents forced on me that I actually ended up liking. Mostly because I enjoyed watching grown men lose to a little girl. Although, Henry wasn’t one of them. He and Marmee were the only ones I could stand in that neighborhood.”</p><p>Rio figures Henry must’ve been Marmee’s late husband.</p><p>“So, what other things did they put you through that you didn’t absolutely hate?”</p><p>Agatha considers that, still nursing her mug. </p><p>“Just chess, I’m afraid. My father tried to make me play tennis, but I hated being sweaty and flat-out refused to chase balls like some Labrador. Though I’ll admit, a racket did come in handy when I was one minor inconvenience away from smashing someone’s skull. Meanwhile, my mother shoved me into ballet class, but Madame Lévesque promptly told me I had two left feet and the grace of a drunken duck.”</p><p>Rio chuckles. “You? With two left feet? I don’t buy it.”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head at her. “Do you honestly think I dance?”</p><p>“You’re telling me you’ve never danced?”</p><p>“Oh, honey. You’re more likely to see a raccoon pirouetting across Fifth Avenue than catch me dancing.”</p><p>Rio grins. “What if I bet on it?”</p><p>“Bet on what?”</p><p>“You. Dancing. I’m betting you’ll cave and dance before I see a raccoon do a pirouette.” </p><p>Agatha smirks. “Well, that’s a bet you’re going to lose.”</p><p>“I don’t think so. Back in high school, girls were ditching their prom dates just to dance with me.” </p><p>“So what, you think I’m gonna be next?”</p><p>“That’s the idea.”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes. “You really think I’d dance with you?”</p><p>“I think it’s very possible,” Rio answers with a shrug. “And I’m persuasive.”</p><p>“You’re the opposite. You’re easily persuaded.”</p><p>“I let myself be persuaded when I want to be. Totally different.”</p><p>“That makes zero sense.”</p><p>“You can think whatever you want. But I’m going to be the first person to get Agatha Harkness to dance.”</p><p>“You poor, deluded thing. That’s never gonna happen.”</p><p>“Never say never, baby.”</p><p>The nickname slips so naturally off Rio’s tongue, even herself doesn’t catch it in time. And judging by the slight jolt of expression on Agatha’s face, she didn’t expect it either. So, Rio adds —</p><p>“And when I manage to do it, you’ll owe me ten bucks. And a trip to the ice cream store.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a genuine laugh. “What are you, twelve?”</p><p>“I sometimes do have the cravings of a twelve-year-old. But I’m not ashamed of it. And I’m also dead serious. Ten bucks and an ice cream date, Miss Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “No. I’m not taking orders from someone who just openly admitted to having the cravings of a middle-schooler.”</p><p>“You’re just scared you’ll lose.”</p><p>“Trust me, I’m not.”</p><p>“Trust me, you are.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“You totally are.”</p><p>“You’re just doing this to annoy me.”</p><p>“No, I’m doing this to convince you.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “You’re unbearable.”</p><p>Rio grins. “So is that a yes?”</p><p>Agatha looks away, but she’s clearly trying not to smile. </p><p>“Fine. If, and I mean if, that ever happens, I’ll give you your ten bucks. And your stupid ice cream.”</p><p>Rio beams. “Told you I was very persuasive.”</p><p>“I just said yes so you’d shut up. And to prove how wrong you are.” </p><p>Rio’s smile stretches, the little gap between her teeth unapologetically showing. “Still counts.” </p><p>“Will you please stop that?”</p><p>“Stop what?”</p><p>“You know exactly what.”</p><p>Agatha lifts her mug again, sipping her coffee like it’ll protect her from smiling.</p><p>But Rio takes it as an opportunity to really look at her. Ever since she woke up this morning, she’s been wondering if last night actually happened.</p><p>But now, watching Agatha smile, laugh, and spar with her like this, there’s no doubt.</p><p>It happened. </p><p>She kissed Agatha. </p><p>Agatha kissed her back.</p><p>And while she may not be able to talk about any of it with her just yet, she’s content with this. </p><p>They’re talking. Agatha’s laughing. Agatha’s smiling. And it’s all because of Rio.</p><p>Then Agatha’s phone rings.</p><p>Rio takes a bite of her toast and watches the woman across from her start to rebuild her fortress, or perhaps just the mask, as she answers the call.</p><p>“Yes, Tony, I’m well aware of what’s happening. The decision to pause the print run was mine.” Agatha’s tone is curt, and it’s only a matter of time before she runs out of patience. “Yes, we’re changing the cover. I know the board will have opinions, but that’s not my concern right now. Trust me, this story is worth it.”</p><p>Her eyes meet Rio’s for a second before she looks away again.</p><p>“It’s a world exclusive. And while I understand you’re looking at this from a business standpoint, you, of all people, should know that a bit of short-term fallout is basically nothing compared to what we’re about to pull in. You told me to fix the numbers, and that’s exactly what I’m doing. The boost in readership and revenue will more than justify this decision.” She doesn’t blink. “Frankly, instead of wasting my time with this lecture, you should be thanking me for landing the biggest story this magazine has had in years.”</p><p>She stops, listens, then her brows cross. </p><p>“What do you mean I’m overdue for humility?” She’s clearly not happy. “Don’t you dare insult me, Tony. You know better than to compare me to her.” Another beat, then her voice drops a degree colder. “No. I’m the editor-in-chief. I know what the magazine needs. We’re running this story. And that’s final.”</p><p>The call ends with Agatha nearly slamming the phone down on the counter. Whatever smile she had earlier is gone, replaced by a hard look and a clenched jaw. </p><p>Rio watches her, and against all logic, finds it kind of hot. Hotter than it should be.</p><p>This angry, commanding side of Agatha. </p><p>There’s something about the way Agatha takes control that gets into her bloodstream. </p><p>And Rio wants to be the one to find out just how far that control goes.</p><p>“Stark doesn’t want to run Lilia’s exclusive?” </p><p>It is safer to ask a question than let herself spiral in her own burning thoughts.</p><p>“No, he’s not worried about that,” Agatha says, a touch calmer now. “He’s just being stupid, worried about the few thousand he’ll lose changing the cover at the last minute. As if that actually matters. He knows how explosive this issue is going to be. For all I know, he just doesn’t want to dip into his yacht fund to cover layout revisions and press overtime.”</p><p>“So, you’re still running it? I’m still writing the piece?”</p><p>Agatha turns to look at her, and this time the anger in her blue eyes completely melts away.</p><p>What remains is all conviction. And something far gentler. </p><p>“Yes, Rio. You’re still writing the piece. And no one, not even Stark, not the board, not anyone, is going to stop me from running it. You deserve to tell this story. And I’ll fight like hell to make sure it sees print.”</p><hr/><p>Rio is honestly kind of surprised, and pretty grateful, that Jen didn’t hate her enough to hand over whatever Barbie-coded uniform the girls at the Fortress wore daily. </p><p>Instead, she gave her a perfectly comfortable Alexander Wang shirt, a pair of soft Tom Ford jeans, and even tossed in a new pair of Calvin Klein underwear, still in the packaging.</p><p>Fresh out of the shower and dressed, Rio eventually heads downstairs. </p><p>The house isn’t quiet anymore like it was earlier. </p><p>The living room and kitchen are full of people from Nocturne. </p><p>Some are in suits, others holding tablets or coffee. Everyone’s talking, moving, busy with something. </p><p>And it’s slowly hitting Rio that she’s about to be right in the middle of all of it.</p><p>“I don’t care if you have to walk twenty-five miles to get here, David. I made it perfectly clear we’re on a tight schedule. So if the best you can do is complain about traffic, don’t bother showing up at all. I can easily find someone who actually knows how to do their job, unlike whatever brand of incompetence you’re pulling right now…” </p><p>Rio turns toward the voice, and of course, it’s Agatha on the phone again. </p><p>She’s ditched the robe from earlier and is now in a light cerulean button-down and tan pants.</p><p>Rio almost never sees her in pants, and for some reason, that makes her stare a second longer than she probably should.</p><p>“Everything okay?” Rio asks when Agatha catches her staring. She only realizes how soft her voice sounded when Agatha gives her a neutral look in return. Right. They’re not alone anymore. </p><p>“Everything’s fine,” Agatha answers coolly. “Jen uploaded the first part of the interview transcript on that laptop. You can work wherever you want. The kitchen, the living room, the study, the patio. Your choice. But I’d prefer if you stayed inside so we can keep an eye on your progress.”</p><p>Rio hesitates for a beat, thrown by the sudden switch in tone, but she nods. </p><p>“Uh, yeah, the kitchen’s fine,” she says. “I’ll work here. With everyone else.” </p><p>“Good,” Agatha nods. “Kale’s at your disposal today. Whatever you need, just ask her.” She points at her assistant, and Rio follows her gaze. Jen doesn’t exactly look thrilled but manages to keep a straight face.</p><p>“Now if you’ll excuse me,” she adds, already picking up her phone again, “you should start writing. I still have a few calls to make.”</p><hr/><p>Rio doesn’t know how many hours have passed since she started typing.</p><p>It simply felt like the second she opened the laptop, something inside her snapped into place. She can’t remember the last time she’s been this focused — this fast, this clear. </p><p>She’s never written a feature like this before, but something about that interview with Lilia sets her on fire. Her fingers move like her head might burst into flames if she slows down. </p><p>And somewhere in the middle of it, she thinks of her dad. </p><p>How he used to vanish into his office and come out with a story. </p><p>She wishes he could see her now. </p><p>Would he be proud? Of course he would. </p><p>A world exclusive, bigger than anything the men in their family have ever landed. </p><p>Mateo Vidal would be the first to cheer her on.</p><p>Every now and then, someone drifts by her side. </p><p>Jen would set down a fresh cup of coffee without saying a word, sometimes a granola bar, sometimes a warm croissant, or a powdered sugar donut on a small plate.</p><p>Melina would also swing by to check if the tone felt right or if a sentence sounded too bold for print. </p><p>A guy from layout, Rio keeps forgetting if his name is Johnny or just John, would also float in and out with a tablet, asking where the photos should go or if she had picked a pull quote yet. </p><p>It’s like being in the eye of a well-oiled storm. Everyone’s moving around her.</p><p>It’s maybe another hour later when Rio finally notices the dull ache in her back and butt from sitting too long, and the strain in her fingers from typing nonstop. </p><p>Still, the work feels never-ending. </p><p>Coffee and tea come and go, same with plates of food she can’t even remember eating, if she ate them at all.</p><p>She’s also lost count of how many yuppie sticks she’s lit, despite Agatha’s warning not to smoke indoors. </p><p>Not that Agatha’s been around to stop her. </p><p>She seems to be the only one who hasn’t checked in since Rio started writing.</p><p>The words are starting to come together, but now Rio’s running into an issue with making everything make sense and coherent, and if she’s being honest, it’s an absolute mess. </p><p>Her draft skitters from one piece of Lilia’s life to another, from one absurd adventure to the next, each scene loud and strange, but none of them landing quite right. </p><p>Somehow, the tick of the clock isn’t just ticking anymore, it’s drilling into her skull. </p><p>Footsteps from the kitchen to the living room and back echo like a metronome gone rogue, slipping in and out of her focus, while the clinking of plates, cups, and silverware scrapes her nerves like nails on a chalkboard. </p><p>And the different voices: the talking, the rambling, the arguing over what goes where, bleed straight through what’s left of her concentration. </p><p>All of it presses in, too close, like the walls themselves are inching forward. </p><p>The words on her screen start to blur, drowned out by everything outside it, and it feels like if one more thing breaks her focus, she just might fucking burst.</p><p>“Can everyone just shut their noise holes for two goddamn seconds?!”</p><p>She hadn’t exactly thought about how everyone might react to her snapping until the whole house goes dead quiet.</p><p>Conversations stop mid-sentence, coffee cups freeze halfway to mouths. Heads turn. Eyes widen. </p><p>And there’s Rio, suddenly the center of attention, having just silenced a room full of people who outrank her, out-age her, and have probably been working at Nocturne since before she even knew the magazine existed.</p><p>Jen is the first to catch her eye, staring at her with wide, stunned disbelief. </p><p>But what really makes Rio want to sink into the floor is how the crowd seems to part, like a divine curtain peeling back, revealing Agatha standing just a few feet away, phone suspended mid-air, eyes locked solely on her. </p><p>From the speaker of her phone, a voice crackles: “Hello? Miss Harkness, are you still there?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer right away, and just stares at Rio. There’s something disbelieving in her eyes, like she’s just caught a glimpse of what else Rio might be capable of.</p><p>And if Rio’s not imagining it, Agatha swallows once, subtly, before her mouth sets into a tight line.</p><p>“Yes, but I’ll have to call you back,” she says, then hangs up without breaking eye contact.</p><p>Nobody dares speak after that, and Rio starts to wonder if she took it too far.</p><p>But Agatha finally pulls her eyes away, looks around the room, and says, “Everyone clear out of this space and keep your voices down.” Then she turns to Jen. “Make sure no one disturbs Miss Vidal again.”</p><p>And with that, she walks out.</p><p>Jen opens her mouth, probably to rally the troops, but Rio beats her to it. Embarrassed by the attention, she gets to her feet in a hurry. “No. No, it’s fine. You all stay. I’ll move to the study,” she blurts out, grabbing her laptop and backing out fast.</p><p>She slips into the study, finally alone, her cheeks still warm. And as much as she wants to melt into the floor, there’s a small part of her that kind of genuinely enjoyed it.</p><p>The way the whole room fell quiet at her voice. The way Agatha looked at her. The way it felt like she was the one holding the reins.</p><hr/><p>Hours later, there’s a knock at the door, finally pulling Rio out of her screen. Her eyes sting from staring at the laptop too long.</p><p>She blinks, then glances at the clock, only now realizing it’s already close to five. </p><p>She expects Jen, or maybe someone else checking in, but it’s Agatha who steps through the door. “Is now a good time?” she says, settling into the chair across from her. “Or am I about to get yelled at again?”</p><p>Rio rubs the back of her neck. “Yeah, sorry about that.”</p><p>“Don’t be. Everyone was breaking your focus, you had every right to do that. If it were me, I would've done worse. And I did say you were the one calling the shots today.” She pauses, gives Rio a look as she crosses her legs. “Turns out, having control suits you,” she adds, like it just slips out.</p><p>Rio just nods and turns her head away, refusing to meet the way Agatha’s looking at her. </p><p>She better not be blushing right now. </p><p>“First draft’s done,” she tells her. “I sent it to Melina about twenty minutes ago. I’m just rereading in case I missed anything. Lilia’s life is just so full and interesting, I didn’t want to leave out something good. Do you think it was smart to open with her getting kicked out of the Vatican gift shop?”</p><p>Agatha unexpectedly lets out a short laugh. “Oh, that’ll grab anyone’s attention. No doubt about that.”</p><p>Rio feels her exhaustion slip off the second she hears it, her eyes crinkling into a smile.</p><p>“Do you want to read it? It’s just the first draft but—” </p><p>Agatha doesn’t wait. She crosses the room and leans down just enough to be level with Rio’s laptop. The sudden closeness makes the latter forget how to breathe for a second.</p><p>“I’ll just take a quick look,” Agatha says, her eyes already scanning the screen. “But I’ll give the final draft a proper read once Melina and her team have polished it for publication.”</p><p>Rio just nods and takes the chance to quietly watch Agatha as she scans through the article. </p><p>She realizes she’ll never get tired of that familiar lavender scent, or of tracing the slope of Agatha’s nose with her eyes, or of looking at the soft creases that form when she almost smiles.</p><p>And then it dawns on her that there’s a real chance she might not get to do any of that anymore after tonight.</p><p>Agatha seems to notice her staring and turns to her, their faces now only inches apart. Rio tries to act normal, as if her heart isn’t suddenly pounding in her chest.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything at first. But she doesn’t really have to. Her eyes subtly lower to Rio’s lips for the briefest breath. And Rio does the same.</p><p>Then their eyes meet again, right at the same time. And Agatha looks at her in that way she always does, the one that makes Rio’s heart trip over itself, again and again. And just like that, she remembers.</p><p>“What are you thinking, Agatha?”</p><p>She throws the question almost under her breath, as if saying it too loud might scare away whatever frail thing is hanging between them.</p><p>Agatha looks a little caught off guard, like the question tugged something loose. Then she also remembers their deal back in Delaware and says, “You know I’m not required to answer that anymore. That only counted when you were still working for me.”</p><p>“Technically, I still am. My last day’s not over yet.” Rio nods toward the clock. They’ve still got five minutes before five. “So why don’t you hold up your end of the deal and tell me what you’re thinking?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a small breath, like she finds it funny. “I think you’re a great writer. I think anyone who reads this will see that. And they’ll be lucky to read anything you put out.”</p><p>Rio realizes this is the first, and probably the last, time she gets to pull the card she and her boss agreed on. So she’s going to make it count.</p><p>“What else?” She swallows. </p><p>“While I do think your article is strong, I still think Melina’s going to tear your draft apart with edits,” Agatha informs her. “She might be nicer than me, but she’s ruthless when it comes to clarity and tone. She won’t let anything slide, especially not with something this important.”</p><p>Rio lets out a dry little laugh. “I did expect that.” She pauses, searching her face. “But what else, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha’s blue eyes drop to her lips again, and Rio feels her whole body go still.</p><p>“I think you’re…” she breathes, as if weighing the cost of saying more than she usually allows. “I think you’re an exceptional writer, and any publication with half a brain would be foolish not to want you.”</p><p>To Rio’s dismay, Agatha stands up straight and takes a small step back, putting space between them again. Whatever was building in that moment slips away immediately after. </p><p>She clears her throat. “Now, while Melina’s team tears through your draft with their red pens, I’d say this calls for a celebratory drink. Perhaps a glass of…” She walks over to a shelf and picks out a bottle of Macallan. “I think you’ll like this.” Then she grabs two glasses and pours a generous amount into each.</p><p>Rio watches her the entire time, trying not to show the disappointment on her face. And when Agatha hands her a glass with the smallest smile, Rio takes it and tries to smile back.</p><p>“To the job they say a million girls would kill for,” Agatha practically announces, lifting her glass. “And to the job you’ve always truly wanted.”</p><p>Rio looks at her for a moment, still trying to figure out what’s going on behind her eyes. But then she lets herself settle into whatever Agatha is offering. She raises her glass and clinks it lightly with hers.</p><p>“And to whatever comes next,” Rio adds, almost to herself.</p><p>“Whatever comes next?” Agatha repeats, glass halfway to her lips. “Which means?”</p><p><em> Me finding a way to stay in your life, and you finding a reason to let me, </em>Rio wants to admit.</p><p>But instead, she says, “Just that we don’t become complete strangers after this.”</p><p>Agatha hums, but there’s something a little sad in the sound. </p><p>“Right,” she mumbles, lifting her glass again. “To whatever comes next, then.” </p><p>She then downs her drink in one go, sets the glass on the table, then claps her hands once and shakes her shoulders lightly.</p><p>“Anyway, the layout’s all arranged, your photos included. Why don’t you finish your drink, take a breather, and come see how your work looks on the page?” </p><p>She’s smiling, but Rio can tell it’s forced.</p><p>“I’ll meet you outside.” </p><p>Rio only nods. </p><p>She turns to leave but slowly pauses at the doorway. She looks back at Rio one last time, and somehow, it feels like the last. They simply regard each other before Agatha says — </p><p>“I want you to know that this is just the beginning.” </p><p>
<em> Then why does it feel like goodbye? </em>
</p><p>“You have a whole world ahead of you now.” </p><p>
<em> Will Agatha want to follow her into it? </em>
</p><p>Agatha gives her another one of those small smiles, the kind that almost reaches her eyes.</p><p>“Congratulations...” A passing beat. “Congratulations, Rio.”</p><hr/><p>Rio used to picture this day as nothing short of magic when she was a little girl. Blue, clear skies. Birds singing outside her window. Even the sound of cars would feel like music to her ears.</p><p>The sun would be beaming, like it was proud of her. But instead, she wakes up to the sound of her skull complaining.</p><p>Her first world-exclusive, hopefully not the last, is out today. </p><p>Her name on newsstands, in bookstores, and basically anywhere that sells magazines.</p><p>And all she can think is: ow.</p><p>Was it wise to knock back a few cans of Heineken alone in her room two nights after leaving Agatha’s Scarsdale estate? No. Definitely not.</p><p>But it was the only feasible thing Rio could think to do, just to fall asleep, just to shut off the thoughts about “whatever comes next.”</p><p>Now with the very real possibility that <em> whatever comes next </em> doesn’t include Agatha anymore.</p><p>A knock on the door pulls Rio out of her musings. She hasn’t moved an inch from where she’s curled up, limbs tangled in the sheets. But before she can even sit up, the door swings open.</p><p>Alice walks in first, and behind her, Billy nearly trips over himself, arms raised, clutching something like it’s a sacred artifact. “Guess who’s famous now?” he grins, waving the glossy magazine.</p><p>Rio blinks. “Good morning to you, too.”</p><p>Alice tosses a smug look over her shoulder as she shuts the door behind them. </p><p>“Trust me, we tried to wait until ten.” </p><p>Billy practically throws himself onto the bed beside her, already flipping through the magazine with the energy of someone who had sugar for breakfast.</p><p>“Look! Look! Page five.” He jabs his finger at the byline. “Rio Vidal. Right there. Your name. In print. On real, dead-tree paper that people actually pay for.”</p><p>Alice flops down on the other side, boxing Rio in the middle. The bed’s obviously too small for three people, and Rio lets out an annoyed sigh.</p><p>“Can you believe it?” Alice grins, just as wide as Billy’s. “We’re friends with a published writer. Not just published, but front cover, big-shot published. Mom’s gonna go absolutely ballistic over this.”</p><p>“I’m gonna cry,” Billy says, fanning his face. Rio scrunches her nose at him. “I’m buying, like, six more copies. Maybe twelve. And I’ll literally do whatever you want today, anything, just to make you sign them. Then I’m selling them on eBay or Etsy and buying myself a giant Squishmallow. Or one of those tiny skincare fridges. But I’m not sure yet. I’m still deciding.” </p><p>“I'm not signing anything,” Rio laughs. Still half-asleep, and still somewhere between disbelief and awe. She takes the magazine from him, tracing her name with her eyes. </p><p>Her name. In a real magazine. Out in the world.</p><p>The two on either side of her keep rambling, something about Alice saying, “We should frame the page,” and Billy chiming in with, “If you won’t sign to sell, maybe you could sign some of my friends’ copies for five bucks.” Rio just nods along, but her eyes stay fixed on the name. </p><p>She’s genuinely happy for herself. She really is. </p><p>And yet, all she can think about is Agatha.</p><p>Would she have knocked on Rio’s door too, grinning, breathless, ready to jump on the bed with her?</p><p>Would they have read it together, side by side, and stayed under the covers all day, marveling at the thing?</p><p>It’s Rio’s first real achievement as a writer, but even now, even here, she wonders what it would’ve felt like if Agatha had been part of this moment. Someone with a thousand victories already, but maybe still soft enough to make room for one more.</p><p>After a long, hot shower and an even longer, meandering breakfast packed with overlapping chatter and half-finished stories from Alice and Billy, Rio finally makes it back to her room, only to find her phone buzzing like a kicked beehive. Missed calls. Voicemails. Texts. Dozens of them.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t been joking when she said people would come running the second the story dropped. </p><p>It’s like the whole world decided to storm Rio’s doorstep all at once. </p><p>But the first thing Rio wants to know is who the hell gave her number to the entire planet?</p><p>She listens to a few in stunned silence. Vogue wants to interview her about how she landed the story with the ever-elusive Lilia Calderu. The CBC left a message asking if she could share a bit about the experience, what it was like, and how she pulled it off.</p><p>Vanity Fair and Harper’s Bazaar both want her to call them back, both “very eager” to talk about what comes next for her.</p><p>Even The Drew Barrymore Show, for God’s sake, wants her to come on and talk about Lilia. Or maybe with Lilia. Rio stares at the message and shakes her head.</p><p>She loves Drew, adores her, but absolutely not. There’s no way she’s getting on TV. Nothing on earth, not even Drew’s radiant smile or the promise of a cozy couch interview, could make her do it. Over her dead body. And probably someone else’s, too.</p><p>With texts still flooding in, Rio dials the one person who might have answers.</p><p>“Oh great. Ruining my perfect workday wasn’t enough, and now you have to go and call me like everyone else? What do you want?” comes the greeting, laced with annoyance.</p><p>“Hi, Jen.”</p><p>“You’re really starting to become a full-time problem in my life, you know that? My inbox has been blowing up since your article dropped. I can’t even pick up one call without three more coming in. People are acting like I’m some kind of customer service hotline because of you. And I’m not exactly thrilled about it.”</p><p>“Yeah, so about that,” Rio mutters, rubbing the back of her neck. “My phone’s been blowing up too. I was just wondering if maybe, possibly…you gave out my number?”</p><p>“Well, isn’t that what you’ve always wanted?” Jen snaps on the other end. “But no, I didn’t give anyone your number. If I hated you that much, I’d rent a damn billboard and throw your home address on it too.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t actually do that…would you?” Rio asks, half-joking, half-concerned.</p><p>“I just might. Three more annoying calls and I’ll be googling billboard rates.”</p><p>“Jen!” </p><p>“Oh, relax your size six ass. For all intents and purposes, you happen to be on Agatha’s protected list now. You’re off limits to the press, unless it’s your choice. She made it real clear that anyone who leaks any of your private info loses their job on the spot.”</p><p>“What? She did that?” </p><p>“No, Rio. I hallucinated it during my morning meditation,” Jen deadpans.</p><p>“Did she say why?” </p><p>“Of course I asked her why,” Jen says dryly. “Then we had a lovely little tea party and braided each other’s hair while talking it over in her office.” Then her voice rises. “Do I look like someone dumb enough to poke the lioness? You clearly don’t know her if you think she explains anything to anyone.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio mumbles. “Sorry.”</p><p>Jen lets out a dramatic sigh, “It was really good, by the way.”</p><p>“What?” </p><p>“Pick up the pace, slowpoke. Did you dump all your tiny brain cells into that article? I read it this morning on my way to work. And I’ll admit, it was way better than I expected. Agatha made the right call running it. And somehow, you were the right one to write it.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t bother holding back her laugh, especially with how physically pained Jen sounds. </p><p>“Thanks, Jen.” </p><p>“Don’t get used to it. I’m still annoyed at you for turning my day, and probably the rest of my week, into hell on earth,” Jen complains, but there’s more exhaustion than bite in her voice. “Anyway, there are still some papers you need to sign here. I haven’t slotted you in yet, so I’ll just email the details. Agatha’s been in nonstop meetings, and I’m still trying to figure out where to fit you in.”</p><p>At the mention of Agatha, Rio perks up, already opening her mouth to ask, but stops when she hears Agatha’s voice in the background, paired with the familiar click-clack of her heels. God. It’s only been three days, and she already misses the sound.</p><p>“Oh, she’s here. I’ve got to go. Good luck with the vultures,” Jen says, filled with caustic joy.</p><p>Then the line goes dead before Rio can reply. She stares at her phone, sighs, and tosses it onto the bed before grabbing a towel and running it through her hair.</p><p>Not even a minute later, her phone starts ringing again. Then again. And again.</p><p>Different numbers each time, none of them saved, none of them familiar.</p><p>So, she lets them all go to voicemail.</p><p>Throwing on a hoodie and the first pair of shorts she can find, Rio heads out without brushing her hair.</p><p>She walks to the corner newsstand near her apartment, buys herself a copy of Nocturne, tries to act casual about it on the way home, and curls up in bed the second she gets back.</p><p>She flips through the magazine, each page gleaming with careful work. </p><p>Her story, her words, appear almost surreal in print, wrapped in clean layouts and powerful photos that make it feel bigger than just her. </p><p>Now more than ever, she can see how much Agatha, as the editor-in-chief, cared about this issue. It’s like a gift packaged in pretty paper, handed gently into her hands by Agatha herself.</p><p>She sighs, feeling a familiar wave of missing someone wash over her. It’s frustrating, this strange ache, the restless yearning, this stubborn longing. </p><p>She knows she shouldn’t be feeling anything but happiness. She should be celebrating. This is a milestone, after all.</p><p>But how can she celebrate this when she hasn’t heard from the one person she really wants to share it with?</p><p>More days pass, and every time the phone rings, Rio hopes it’s Agatha. </p><p>Between replying to a handful of job offers and turning down a few pushy interview requests from eager media outlets, Rio also keeps an eye out for an email from Nocturne. </p><p>Jen did mention there are still papers she needs to sign, and Rio wouldn’t mind using that as an excuse to see Agatha again. But the messages never come. Nothing at all.</p><p>Not even when Rio sends Agatha a photo of a bus with their magazine’s cover on it, or another picture of a woman reading the issue in a subway.</p><p>Not even when she shares part of her text chain with Lilia, where Lilia says she loved the article, has decided to stay a little longer in America, and is throwing a party before heading back to Italy. One she invited Rio to attend, and by extension, Agatha too.</p><p>Rio spends most days playing phone tag with editors and magazines that want her on board. </p><p>Some offers sound decent. Others, not so much. Other fashion magazines, as expected, reach out with their usual pitches. And then, out of nowhere, she even gets an email from Oxe. </p><p>But does she really want to write for them? More fashion stories? When she even barely enjoyed it before? And the only thing that made it bearable was getting the chance to see Agatha around the office. And now, that’s gone.</p><p>One afternoon, Hela sends Rio a text about a freelance writing job for The Wall Street Journal, and maybe even The Washington Post if she’s interested. </p><p>The work would be serious reporting: digging into financial trends, corporate scandals, and breaking down complex economic issues.</p><p>It’s the kind of hard-hitting journalism Rio’s been craving all her life. And freelancing for these outlets might be exactly what she needs right now.</p><p>But instead of jumping at the opportunity, Rio keeps herself busy with other mundane things like cleaning her room, scrubbing the kitchen, baking cookies, planting new greenery on their tiny balcony, and calling Lorna to ask for her recipe for pot roast and homemade bread.</p><p>Anything to keep her hands moving during these last few free days while her mind spins through the choices suddenly tossed her way.</p><p>It’s only when a package shows up at her doorstep that Rio is finally pulled out of her New York domestic bender.</p><p>Inside is a black, full-length, tuxedo-style coat, double-breasted with structured shoulders, clean white cuffs, and a metallic silver bow tie folded neatly on top. </p><p>Tucked beside it is a long note in Lilia’s unmistakable scrawl: </p><p>“Hope you don’t mind me dressing you up for my party, kid. My driver’s picking you up. And don’t even think about bailing. I want to flaunt the writer who told the world about my wildest adventures.” </p><p>At the bottom of the paper, embroidered in shimmering gold, are the words: <em> I Died in Paris, 1978. </em> </p><p>Rio can only assume that’s the theme.</p><hr/><p>The night of the party sneaks up faster than Rio expects. </p><p>With Agatha still radio silent, she debates about backing out altogether. </p><p>She looks at the tuxedo laid out on her bed and comes up with a hundred excuses to stay home: her stomach hurts, her foot’s acting weird, or Mercury’s probably in retrograde. </p><p>She paces around her room, heart thrumming against her ribs like it’s trying to crawl out. </p><p>But she owes Lilia at least a quick appearance. </p><p>One hour, tops, she tells herself. Show up, say thanks, then head back home.</p><p>The venue is a renovated theater house downtown, dressed like a funeral’s dream. </p><p>Black and white everywhere. Black roses in tall crystal vases. White candles that are so realistic they’re actually melting wax onto silver platters. </p><p>As Rio’s come to expect, it smells like expensive champagne and too much perfume the moment she steps inside.</p><p>Somewhere in a far corner, a cello quartet plays a mournful version of what Rio’s pretty sure is The Phantom of the Opera. </p><p>Jesus. This might just be the craziest, and somehow coolest, party she’s ever been to.</p><p>She weaves through the crowd, scanning the sea of black and white for Lilia, partly to thank her, mostly to anchor herself in this surreal scene. </p><p>People weren’t kidding when they said Lilia throws the most lavish, over-the-top parties in fashion history.</p><p>Perhaps, this is her way of reminding New York’s fashionable elite exactly who she is, even if she purposely chooses to stay out of the spotlight.</p><p>Rio trades a few polite smiles. Some people nod back. Others just throw a look at her before moving on, probably wondering who she is.</p><p>Unlike the usual industry functions she’s been to, where she knows at least half the room, here almost every face is new. Just a few names she recognizes: editors, stylists, people who never miss a party.</p><p>She politely turns down champagne flutes offered by a handful of men in shiny suits and keeps walking. </p><p>Right now, her only plan in mind is to find the elusive and legendary hostess, and perhaps cling to her for the rest of the night like a well-dressed barnacle.</p><p>Rio is halfway across the marble floor when the lights around her suddenly dim, and the music morphs into something slower, lusher, and less haunting: a swell of cello layered with a voice full of longing and velvet sadness. A ripple moves through the crowd as heads turn toward the center of the room, where the space clears like magic.</p><p>Then, from the high ceiling, long sheets of diaphanous silk — black, white, and ghost-gray — begin to float down, spinning gently like they have a mind of their own. </p><p>They don’t fall so much as drift, slow and weightless, like spirits moving through the air in search of something long forgotten. </p><p>The room pulses with strobe lights, casting everything in flashes of shadow and glow.</p><p>A figure in a floor-length white dress moves with the falling fabric, hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat and veil, guiding the silk, indeed like spirits caught in her hands.</p><p>The room is silent, except for the music and a few soft gasps nearby. It’s beautiful, luminous, otherworldly, and Rio can’t look away.</p><p>She stops walking and somehow completely forgets what she came for. For a long suspended second, it’s just her and the performance in front of her. </p><p>Then, as if she can feel her presence among the blur of people, her hazel eyes catch someone across the room, standing near one of the arched windows — looking as beautiful, as luminous, as otherworldly as the light allows.</p><p>Her face is tipped up toward the swirling silks. She’s dressed in a long, structured white coat-dress with a tailored, blazer-style top and soft lapels, while the bottom blooms into a full, sweeping skirt. It’s as if Rio is seeing her in a wedding gown that had fallen in love with a power suit.</p><p>Rio promptly goes still at the sight of the face she’d come to miss more than she realized, and it takes her a moment to believe what she’s seeing. Deep down, she had hoped to see her here. But only a small part of her truly believed she would.</p><p>When their eyes meet across the room, time doesn’t slow but stops altogether. Just for a breath. Just long enough to steal the air from Rio’s lungs. They move toward each other, meeting halfway between a marble pillar and a swan-shaped ice sculpture Rio couldn’t care less about.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio blurts, voice scratchy with things she’s not saying.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha echoes, just as softly.</p><p>“You look…” Rio trails off, because what is she supposed to say? </p><p>
<em>You look like everything I’ve been missing. And it’s only been a week, but I’ve come this close to hopping the subway and showing up at your door just to tell you how much I miss you.</em>
</p><p>“You clean up well yourself,” Agatha says instead, sensing Rio’s run out of words. “One of Lilia’s, I assume? I could tell by the cut,” she adds, gesturing to the sharp lines of the tux Rio is wearing.</p><p>Rio rubs the back of her neck. </p><p>“She insisted.” Then, not wanting their conversation to end there, she adds what she should’ve said seconds ago. “You look really good, by the way. I mean, the color looks really good on you.”</p><p>Agatha smiles. “Oh, honey. Everything looks good on me.”</p><p>Rio blushes at the way she says it. God, she misses how Agatha’s voice can just drop like that, so natural and effortless. They stand there in silence for a beat before Rio blurts out, “I wasn’t sure you’d come.”</p><p>Something crosses Agatha’s face, and Rio is bold enough to assume it’s a bit of guilt. But Agatha shakes it off like she always does, brushing her curls back with a subtle shrug.</p><p>“I wasn’t entirely sure I’d come either. I’ve been in back-to-back meetings since the new issue dropped. But I also didn’t want to miss one of Lilia’s parties. It would’ve been a shame to miss the spectacle. And who knows how many more years we’ll have to wait before she decides to throw another one.” She looks around at the crowd surrounding them. </p><p>Rio simply nods and looks at her. But there doesn’t seem to be a single coherent thought in her head while staring at Agatha, just one question repeating over and over: </p><p>“Are you holding up okay?”</p><p>Agatha turns back to her, clearly surprised by the question. She doesn’t answer right away, and the silence stretches just enough to make Rio fill it. “I mean, how’s work? You said you’ve been in meetings nonstop. I was just wondering how you’ve been. I hope you’re taking care of yourself.”</p><p>Agatha meets the question with a small, unreadable smile. “Other people’s inefficiency and stupidity still follow me around, but I manage. This isn’t my first world exclusive, after all.” She pauses, then adds in a more businesslike tone, “You, on the other hand, how are you keeping up with all the attention? Have you decided which road you’re going to take, with all the publications lining up to get you under their wing?” </p><p>Rio shrugs. “Not really.”</p><p>“Not really?”</p><p>“I mean, not yet.”</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow. “Why not?”</p><p>“There are a couple I’ve started talking to, but I haven’t really committed to any of them yet. I mean, I’m still thinking it through. Also, there are some freelancing offers that I, um, I might try first. They seem kind of promising and I’m—” </p><p>“Rio.” The sound of her name from the other woman stops her mid-ramble. </p><p>She then meets Agatha’s sapphire eyes again. </p><p>“I know everything feels overwhelming right now, but don’t let any of it mess with your head, okay? Just because a lot of people are making offers doesn’t mean you have to say yes to something that doesn’t feel right. I mean, you’re doing great, taking your time, figuring it out. Choose what you really want, and build from there. You don’t have anything left to prove, do you understand? You’ve already done that. Now it’s about choosing what makes you happy.”</p><p>Rio lets Agatha’s words settle in. And damn it, she’s right. She always somehow is.</p><p>Like she knows the exact thing to say, even when Rio hasn’t fully figured out the feeling herself. It really is her choice now. Whatever road makes her feel like herself. Whatever makes her happy. </p><p>But what if what truly makes Rio happy is for the woman standing right in front of her to finally realize that she has somehow, unexpectedly but inevitably, become Rio’s happiness?</p><p>Agatha seems to catch the look on Rio’s face and pauses. “What is it?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head, half-smiling. </p><p>“Nothing. You’re just being oddly nice.” </p><p>Agatha arches a brow. “Haven’t I always been?”</p><p>Rio huffs a soft laugh. “More than usual.”</p><p>“Well, I wouldn’t make a habit of expecting it.”</p><p>Before Rio can say something to keep the conversation going just a little longer, someone nearby calls Agatha’s name. She straightens almost instantly, slipping back into that polished, untouchable version of herself. “Looks like I’m needed elsewhere.” </p><p>She takes a step, then glances over her shoulder. Rio expects her to say something, anything, that might quiet the storm in her head and the thudding ache beneath her ribs. </p><p>But instead Agatha just says, “You might want to avoid the red punch, unless you feel like throwing up all night and waking up with a headache.”</p><p>That ends up being the last real conversation Rio has with Agatha all night, and she hates how ridiculously disappointed she feels because of it.</p><p>Eventually, she spots Lilia in the middle of a story, making a small group of guests laugh.</p><p>Lilia lights up when she sees her, pulling her in and introducing her like a proud grandma showing off her favorite granddaughter who just won something big.</p><p>They talk for a while, and Rio tries to stay present, but nothing seems to hold her attention. </p><p>Not when Agatha is just a few feet away, smiling at people who aren’t Rio and making small talk with people who definitely aren’t Rio. And all Rio can do is watch from afar.</p><p>Is this how it’s going to be between them now? </p><p>Just short, polite words at parties? Glimpses from across crowded rooms? Smiles that never quite reach the eyes? Like nothing ever <em> almost </em>happened between them? Like they hadn’t come so close to being something more? Like they never once looked at each other like the world had stopped spinning, just to make space for them, and them alone?</p><p>Lilia hands her a flute of champagne and a plate of delicate pastries Rio can’t even pronounce right — fancy little things that pull her out of her gloomy thoughts for a bit. </p><p>But Lilia is the hostess, so it doesn’t take long before she’s swept away by more guests, more stories to tell, leaving Rio standing alone, lost in a crowd of suits and dresses. </p><p>“And here I thought someone like you couldn’t possibly get any hotter.” </p><p>Rio turns toward the voice, oddly relieved to see a familiar face. At least she won’t have to squeeze into a group and pretend she’s not quietly cringing at compliments from people who just found out who she is. </p><p>“I have to say, fame suits you,” Hela adds. </p><p>“This was all Lilia’s doing,” Rio nods to her tux, right as Hela swaps her empty glass for a full one.</p><p>“A million-dollar tux and a front-page exclusive. Talk about a winning streak,” Hela notes with a sly smile. “I’d wager every editor in New York is tripping over themselves to get you on staff. A bit exhausting, isn’t it? When the dream finally catches up, and suddenly you’re not sure if you can keep up?”</p><p>“I’m…getting used to it.”</p><p>Hela shoots her a look over the rim of her glass. “I hope you’re not having second thoughts about the pitch I laid out for you. A byline with us and the Post would make your resume practically bulletproof.”</p><p>Rio knows that. Her dad used to read these papers religiously. </p><p>“I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want it. But I just need my first assignment to be something I can really sink my teeth into. If it is, then yeah, you’ll have my byline.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t worry. You’ll have more than enough to sink your teeth into. And trust me, it’s a smart move, career-wise,” Hela assures her. “Though, for a second there, I thought you’d crawl back to your old magazine and get buried in fashion again. A lot of people did, actually. Some even bet Agatha wouldn’t let you leave after that global exclusive.”</p><p>In a heartbeat, Rio’s eyes soften at the mention of Agatha’s name. “She didn’t think it would be fair to me if I stayed and kept writing about things she didn’t think I was as interested in.”</p><p>“Which definitely surprised a lot, just in case you haven’t heard the industry whispers.”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve got enough connections yet to hear those.”</p><p>“Well, you’re about to.” Hela takes another slow sip of champagne. “Anyway, how are things going with the rotten apple of your eye? Now that you’re no longer with the magazine, I’m guessing HR’s not an issue anymore, which is lucky for you, ’cause you could kiss her stupid and no one would file a report.”</p><p>Rio nearly chokes on her own drink.</p><p>“I—what?”</p><p>“Aren’t you two already dating? I mean, if ‘dating’ is even a thing Agatha Harkness does.”</p><p>“Dating? No! Agatha and I are…we’re not—” Rio fumbles, eyes wide.</p><p>Hela chuckles and shakes her head. “Is that so? I could’ve sworn she’d have pounced on you by now.”</p><p>This time, Rio almost hacks up a lung. “Why would you even think that?”</p><p>“Because she clearly has feelings for you too.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw drops at Hela’s words. “No, she doesn’t. If anything, I think she’s just trying not to hate me.”</p><p>Even when they shared a kiss and perhaps a few more. </p><p>Even when Agatha looked at her the way she always does when it’s just the two of them.</p><p>Even when there were little cracks that made Rio almost hope Hela was right. </p><p>Even then, Rio tells herself it didn’t mean anything to Agatha.</p><p>Hela laughs, loud enough that a few people nearby glance over before turning back to their drinks. </p><p>“I thought overnight fame would at least make you a little less clueless, but it seems nothing has changed. Then again, I can’t really blame you. That’s part of your faultless charm.”</p><p>When Rio just looks at her, Hela goes on, downing the rest of her champagne before swapping the empty flute for a fresh one from a passing tray. </p><p>Rio wonders how someone can drink like that and still talk in full sentences.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Hela states, slow and pointed, “is a power-hungry, terrifyingly well-dressed succubus whose entire life revolves around her magazine. And yet, she had in her hands a brand-new writer. Someone with barely a byline, who somehow became one of her best almost overnight. Someone she could’ve had wrapped around her finger without even trying. But instead of keeping her, as her reputation would suggest, she lets her go. Willingly. So that writer can chase her dreams. If that’s not screamingly obvious, Rio, I genuinely don’t know what is.”</p><p>Rio turns it over in her head. As absurd as it sounds, Hela’s words land somewhere stubborn in her chest and refuse to budge. And, like always, her mind circles back to the kiss.</p><p>Agatha kissed her back.</p><p>Not passively. Not indifferently. But longingly. </p><p>But then why hasn’t either of them brought it up? Why has Agatha been acting like it never happened? </p><p>Rio lets herself believe that perhaps it was just a moment, a strange, spontaneous blip brought on by adrenaline or gratitude. Perhaps kissing her back was Agatha’s twisted way of saying thank you for landing the exclusive.</p><p>Or perhaps it was merely pity.</p><p>Rio had been the one who leaned in first, after all. Perhaps Agatha didn’t want to embarrass her by pulling away. Or maybe it was simply something else entirely.</p><p>The truth is, Rio doesn’t know. And the more she tries to make sense of it, the less she understands.</p><p>Rio looks around and spots Agatha almost instantly, standing near the windows with a glass of wine in hand, half-listening to someone in a suit.</p><p>It had always been easy: finding her. Like Rio’s eyes had been trained to do it long ago.</p><p>She watches from a distance, and even across the room, nothing about Agatha slips past her. </p><p>The way her eyes darken when she’s deep in thought. The faint scrunch of her nose when something fails to impress her.</p><p>And then there’s her smile. Rare, reluctant, as if it costs her something each time, yet still enough to make Rio feel as if the ground under her had moved.</p><p>Then she’s reminded of where they are, of how easily Agatha moves through this world. And Rio, by contrast, still feels like she’s fumbling her way through it. </p><p>She shakes her head and turns back to Hela. “Even if she does, which I still don’t believe, I’m not the kind of person someone like her would want. We’re too different. And I’m just not worth the trouble.”</p><p>Hela lets out a long-suffering sigh and tilts her head back, like the ceiling might offer her more patience than Rio ever could.</p><p>She looks thoroughly exasperated, as if she’s speaking to the stupidest person in the room.</p><p>Rio pulls a face, wondering if Hela’s had one too many flutes of champagne before this. </p><p>She’s about to make a comment about her alcohol intake when Hela cuts her off. </p><p>“I haven’t the faintest idea where all this bullshit is coming from. But what I know is, you like her, and she likes you. Truly, why do we, as lesbians, always make things so needlessly more complicated than they need to be?”</p><p>With zero warning, Hela slips an arm around Rio’s waist, pulls her close, and presses a kiss to the corner of her mouth just as the lights drop for the next performance. </p><p>Strobe lights burst across the room, camera flashes firing like fireworks. </p><p>And out of the corner of her eye, Rio catches a glimpse of an image she wishes she hadn’t.</p><p>Agatha, still as a photograph, eyes locked on them while everyone else is looking the other way.</p><p>Before Rio can even have a heart attack, Hela pulls away with a wink, leaving her blinking like she just walked into a lamppost.</p><p>“What the hell was that for?”</p><p>“Just the starting pistol.” Rio wants to slap the grin right off the other woman's face as she says it, if she weren’t so thrown and still catching her breath. “We both know your woman likes to win. I just gave her a reason to realize what she’s about to lose if the two of you keep being this stubborn, slow, and stupid.”</p><p>Then she leans in, still grinning like a Cheshire cat, and Rio’s instinct is to take a small step back, but Hela is fast enough to cup her cheek.</p><p>“You’ll thank me later, darling.”</p><p>And with that, she strolls away like she didn’t just light a match and drop it into the dry kindling, with Rio standing right in the middle.</p><hr/><p>“It’s like the seventh circle of hell in here!” </p><p>Rio winces and immediately yanks the phone away from her ear, stepping off the subway just in time to dodge someone who clearly never learned the basic courtesy of letting people exit before barging in.</p><p>“I don’t even know what set her off this time,” Jen tells her, then pants like she’s been running. Maybe she has, Rio thinks. “She came in looking like she hadn’t slept in a week and just started snapping at everyone. I think this might be a personal record for how many people she’s fired in a day. She even let go of three models before the shoot, two for being too tall and slender, and another just for having naturally warm blonde hair. Can you believe that?”</p><p>Rio perks up mid-step at the description. She knows someone tall, slender, and with naturally warm blonde hair. But she shoves the thought aside and keeps walking.</p><p>“Monica’s probably crying in the bathroom, Sue’s gone full statue in front of the mood boards, and we’re supposed to pull off eight looks with one model who looks two seconds away from bolting. I honestly don’t know how we’re getting through this shoot alive.”</p><p>There’s a loud clatter in the background, something falls, and Jen mutters a curse under her breath.</p><p>“Are you on your way? Please, please tell me you’re coming. And for the love of God, can you swing by Starbucks and grab her usual? Piping hot,” she says, then barrels on before Rio can even open her mouth. “I know you don’t technically work here anymore, but the assistant who replaced your replacement keeps messing up this one thing, and I cannot get thrown under the bus for it again. I’ve gone through four of them this month, and I am not about to train another full-grown toddler on training wheels.”</p><p>“But is now really the best time for me to show up there?” Rio manages to squeeze in a word as she heads up the stairs. “I mean, I can always come by and sign the rest of the papers another day.”</p><p>Rio might not admit it, but the way Jen’s describing things at Agatha’s office is starting to make her genuinely nervous.</p><p>And as much as she tries not to, she can’t help but wonder if this sudden rampage has anything to do with Hela kissing her last night.</p><p>“Oh god. She just snapped at Melina. Melina, Rio! That’s how bad it is here. I never even say please, but I’m begging you. Crawl, teleport, hitch a ride with a pigeon, I don’t care how you do it, just get your ass up here with her Starbucks. Or I’m faking a seizure and letting the paramedics carry me out.”</p><p>“Watch it!” someone snaps as Rio narrowly avoids bumping into them. </p><p>She mutters an apology but hears Jen’s voice still crackling in her ear. </p><p>“Five minutes, Rio! I need you here in five minutes.”</p><p>“But I—” Her protest quickly dies in her throat the second the call drops, just as she glances up and spots the familiar green logo staring directly at her across the street.</p><p>A few minutes later, Rio’s in the elevator, fidgeting with the coffee tray in her hands.</p><p>It oddly feels like the day after Pride all over again, her nerves fraying with every floor the metal box climbs.</p><p>And maybe she would’ve found the humor in it, if she hadn’t just nearly crashed into a crying, six-foot model wobbling in sky-high Louboutins.</p><p>“And here I thought you’d died. What took you so long?” Jen hisses the second she spots Rio approaching her desk. “Go. Just get in there. She genuinely looks like she’s about to breathe fire.”</p><p>Rio stops short, eyebrows shooting up. “Wait, why me? Shouldn’t you be the one giving this to her?” she asks, already halfway to shoving the coffee into Jen’s hands. But the latter quickly pulls them back.</p><p>“Because you’re ten minutes late when I told you I needed you here at five,” Jen snaps, all but shoving Rio toward the door. “If I walk in there with that cup, I’ll be walking out without a job. You, however, already got fired twice. So, consider yourself fireproof.”</p><p>Somehow, Rio miraculously manages to balance the coffee, even as Jen gives her a shove that nearly sends her stumbling into Agatha’s office.</p><p>And Jen hadn’t been exaggerating about Agatha’s mood when she walks in and sees the woman with her back towards her, standing by the glass window with her arms crossed, glaring down at the street like she’s about to crush every car and pedestrian beneath her.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio greets, a little too brightly, showing the gap in her front teeth like it might help. “I, uh, brought you coffee.” She walks over, sets it gently on the desk, then takes a careful step back.</p><p>Agatha barely throws her stormy eyes at her before dropping into her chair and dives straight into her laptop, fingers flying over the keys like she’s typing out a grudge letter by letter.</p><p>“You must’ve missed the joy of fetching lattes,” she comments, not bothering to look up. “Last I checked, you no longer work here, unless, of course, you’ve taken up delivering coffee as a charitable endeavor.” </p><p>Rio feels the chill of her voice run down her spine, colder than the AC humming in the corner. </p><p>“I was already on my way, so—” </p><p>“I wasn’t really asking,” Agatha says dryly, and Rio slowly tucks her hands behind her back. </p><p>Instead of saying more, Rio waits for Agatha to speak again, but the latter just picks up the coffee, takes a sip, and starts hammering away at her keyboard again.</p><p>Rio watches her, unsure if she’s actually typing something or if the screen’s just full of angry gibberish. Either way, her former boss is definitely pissed.</p><p>Growing a little uncomfortable with the silence and angry tapping of the keyboard, Rio opens her mouth to speak, only for Agatha to pull her hand from the keys and push a folder across the desk toward her, still without looking up. </p><p>“These are the final documents you need to sign,” she begins, her tone more clipped than usual. “A standard post-publication release, confirming that the rights to your article remain with the publisher. Customary, especially for first-time contributors.”</p><p>Rio steps forward and grabs the folder, flipping it open to scan the first page.</p><p>“You’ll find the full payment breakdown enclosed,” Agatha continues. “Now that the issue’s out, the remainder of your fee is being processed. It should reach your account by the end of the week.”</p><p>Rio flips through the pages slowly, eyes skimming the fine print even though she already knows she’s going to sign it.</p><p>Her first instinct is to get it over with, but some stubborn part of her brain keeps telling her to take her time, to stay just a little longer.</p><p>“I don’t see anything about reader metrics or reach. Will I ever get those?”</p><p>“You’ll receive a performance report in sixty days. Circulation numbers, site analytics, demographic breakdowns. Everything you’d expect on that front. We just don’t release projections until after the second wave of press. I figured you knew that,” Agatha answers, still focused on her screen, or pretending to be, as Rio notices.</p><p>And sure, Rio does know that. But she’s not about to walk out without Agatha at least glancing her way.</p><p>She clears her throat, tossing out another question even though she already knows the answer. “Just to be clear, the exclusivity clause means only Nocturne gets to publish it, right? No syndication deals?”</p><p>Agatha furrows her brows at that, still not looking at Rio, seemingly unaware of what she’s trying to do. “It was a global exclusive. That means no reprints in other magazines, no overseas editions, and definitely no syndication. The embargo covered all of that, as you know full well.”</p><p>Rio nods and pretends to flip to the next page. She bites her lip, hesitating before voicing another seemingly stupid inquiry. “And the online version stays up indefinitely? Or is it pulled after a while?”</p><p>“It’ll remain in the digital archive, same as print. Standard policy for cover features.”</p><p>“So that’s it, then? It’s out, done, and over with?” Rio asks again, hazel eyes still on Agatha, who seems hell-bent on avoiding eye contact for the entirety of their conversation.</p><p>“As far as the publisher is concerned, yes.” Agatha sips her coffee, still without looking at Rio.</p><p>Rio presses her tongue to the inside of her cheek, pausing again before saying anything. </p><p>It might be her dumbest question yet, but it’s the only one left in her head, and the only one she thinks might finally get the woman in front of her to look up.</p><p>“Did I do something wrong?”</p><p>That causes Agatha to pause. Her fingers hover mid-air, frozen between keystrokes.</p><p>For a beat, she just stares at the screen, schooling her face into its usual inscrutable expression. Then, as if the question had not touched her at all, she resumes typing.</p><p>Rio lets out a long, tired sigh, suddenly feeling just bold enough, perhaps foolish enough, to steer the conversation toward her early hypothesis. “If this is about last night—”</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha cuts in, cold and immediate. “I couldn’t care less about what you were up to last night.”</p><p>Rio pushes anyway. “I know you saw us.” She swallows hard, then adds, “But whatever you think that was, it wasn’t. She was just messing around. Trust me, it didn’t mean anything. Hela and I aren’t even—”</p><p>Agatha stills again, but this time, her hands drop to the desk. </p><p>“I told you once that whatever you do outside these walls is none of my concern. And now that you’re no longer part of this company, that sentiment applies even more. I don’t care what alpaca you let suck on your tongue, and I certainly don’t care about you and your reckless, flighty, attention-seeking lips.”</p><p>“I didn’t—” Rio stands there, a little stunned, only just beginning to believe that Agatha’s rampage might actually be about her kiss with Hela. “I just thought you deserved to know that it wasn’t—”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>This time, Agatha finally looks up. Her storm-bitten blue eyes meet Rio’s, and lately, more than ever, Rio can’t tell what’s behind them. Only that something’s there, tucked too far back for her to reach.</p><p>“Let’s not pretend whatever happened between us mattered enough to owe each other explanations.” </p><p>This is the first time Agatha has ever brought up their <em> almost </em> — the thing Rio had once been desperate to talk about, desperate for Agatha to acknowledge, but also the one that apparently didn’t matter enough. </p><p>And now that it’s out in the open, all she wants is for Agatha to take it back.</p><p>“Now, if you’re done wasting my time with your questions, I believe you still owe me a signature,” Agatha presses on, nodding toward the papers.</p><p>Without a word, Rio picks up the pen, signs in angry loops, and sets it down, just short of slamming it. </p><p>She then heads for the door, but stops once, her jaw clenched as she looks back.</p><p>“Well, for the record,” she snaps, fists curled tight at her sides, “you don’t get to call my lips attention-seeking when you used to look at them like…” She cuts herself off and shakes her head. “You know what, forget it. You’re Agatha fucking Harkness. The truth only matters when it serves you,” she scoffs, and storms out without another glance.</p><hr/><p>Rio is well aware she could’ve said all that a little less harshly. Then again, there’s only so much you can do when your better judgment gets drowned out by a pissed-off mouth.</p><p>Instead of going home and dumping whatever lousy, godawful energy she picked up after talking to Agatha on Alice, and probably Billy, Rio lets her feet take over. </p><p>She spends the rest of her day drifting through the streets of New York, aimlessly kicking dented soda cans and nursing bitter thoughts, until she stumbles on a half-hidden speakeasy tucked behind a flower shop just off West 11th.</p><p>By the time her third sazerac is sweating in her hand, her phone lights up on the bar. Her brows knit together, and the drink suddenly tastes warm and bitter in her mouth.</p><p>Agatha’s name blares on the screen, the answer button practically daring Rio to do something stupid. </p><p>But lucky for her, she’s not drunk enough for that kind of stupidity yet. </p><p>So she ignores it, lets it ring out, and leaves it to go to voicemail.</p><p>It doesn’t even take three seconds before her phone lights up again. This time, it’s a text.</p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> You left one document unsigned. Could you return to the office to take care of it? </em></p><p>Rio scoffs and catches the time glowing at the top of her screen. It’s already past eight. She closes the app with a flick of her thumb and sets the phone face down.</p><p>But not even a full minute passes before the phone buzzes again, skittering slightly against the wood. </p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> Legal needs this on their desk by morning. </em></p><p>Rio still doesn’t bother typing a reply and sets her phone back down on the bar.</p><p>If Agatha thinks Rio is going to march all the way back to the office at this hour over one unsigned page, and especially after everything that was said earlier, then she’s sorely mistaken. </p><p>But then, because she knows exactly how relentless and annoyingly persistent her former boss can be, Rio sighs, picks the phone back up, turns off all notifications, and shoves it deep into her jacket pocket, just as the bartender slides a fresh drink toward her.</p><p>“Rough day?” he asks.</p><p>She taps a finger against the rim of her glass and drinks. “Something like that.”</p><p>Another hour passes, maybe two, maybe more, Rio can't really tell.</p><p>But the warmth in her limbs and the slow, lazy spin in her head tell her she’s definitely had more than enough to drink.</p><p>However, when she finally reaches for her wallet to settle the tab, her fingers meet nothing but empty fabric.</p><p>Her brows pull together in confusion.</p><p>She checks her other pocket. Then the other. Then again, just to be sure she didn’t miss it. Still nothing.</p><p>A simmering panic starts to bubble up as she pats herself down: jacket, pants, inner lining, back pockets. She even leans sideways to peek under the bar stool, just in case. But there’s no sign of it anywhere. </p><p>Running a hand through her hair, she tries to retrace her steps in her mind, thinking hard about where she could have left it. </p><p>Slowly, and to the utter horror of anyone who decides to drink alone on a whim, she comes to the conclusion that she must’ve dropped it somewhere earlier during her angry little walk through the city, when she wasn’t paying attention to anything else except her own thoughts.</p><p>“Shit,” she mutters under her breath. “You gotta be kidding me. Shit, shit.” </p><p>She blows out a breath and digs into her pocket for her phone, fingers clumsy and slower than she wants them to be.</p><p>Her head’s swimming just enough to make everything feel a beat off. She then curses herself for having one drink too many. Then curses Agatha for this stupid chain reaction of a day. </p><p>Easier to blame it on Agatha anyway, Rio thinks.</p><p>She flips to her recents, taps the first name she sees, and holds the phone to her ear, silently praying to whatever version of God might still be awake on a Friday night that Alice picks up.</p><p>The phone rings once, twice, three times, then, to Rio’s shaky relief, Alice finally picks up on the fourth.</p><p>“Hey, Al,” she says, then immediately hiccups. Great. Now Alice would know instantly just how far gone she is. The hiccups have always been a dead giveaway, always hitting when Rio is past tipsy and heading straight into should’ve stopped two drinks ago territory. </p><p>Her ears are hot now, and she can feel the flush rising in her cheeks and up the back of her neck. She rubs it instinctively, as if that might somehow cool her down.</p><p>“I, uh, kinda lost my wallet,” she mutters, glancing around the bar like it might turn up if she just looks hard enough. “I’m at this bar. It’s behind a little flower shop, somewhere off Eleventh. It’s called the Burning Bush. I think. Or something like that.” A breathy laugh slips out of her. Jesus, she’s definitely drunk. “Can you come get me? Please? And before you ask why I’m here, I’ll explain. Later.”</p><p>Rio’s brows draw together when the other end stays quiet a little too long. “Hello?” she asks. “Alice? You still there?” She knows the call connected. Alice had definitely picked up. But just as she pulls the phone back to check if the line dropped or if Alice hung up on her, the phone dies in her hand.</p><p>“Fuck,” she hisses, then lets out a bitter little laugh as she thunks her forehead against the bar. </p><p>This is definitely not her brightest night. </p><p>She stays like that, forehead pressed to the wood, stewing in the realization that getting drunk alone without thinking it through was a very, very stupid idea. </p><p>On a normal, sober night, she would’ve figured something out by now.</p><p>She’s usually good at that.</p><p>But she’s drunk, walletless, and completely cut off from the one person who might’ve helped.</p><p>Okay, maybe, on the bright side, if Rio keeps betting on the better parts of people, the universe might throw her a bone.</p><p>Maybe some kind stranger will spot her and offer help. Or maybe the bartender, out of sheer pity or mercy, will wave off the tab and call her a cab home. </p><p>It’s not that far-fetched. New York isn’t completely heartless.</p><p>She isn’t sure how long she’s been sitting like this: forehead pressed to the bar, arms folded like a shield, when she senses someone step up beside her.</p><p>She hears the soft click of heels break through her haze, and registers a faint presence in her periphery.</p><p>Her head’s getting fuzzier, and she barely catches the sound of someone speaking beside her.</p><p>“I’ll take care of her tab.”</p><p>Rio lifts her head slowly, squinting through the strands of hair falling into her eyes. </p><p>And even if every block of ice in the bar’s backroom freezer had been dumped over her, it still wouldn’t match the chill that shoots down her spine the moment she recognizes the face.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” she hisses, straining her already half-lidded eyes. Stupid lightweight genetics.</p><p>Her thoughts scatter, and all she can really register are those familiar blue eyes, staring right back at her.</p><p>They look calmer now, or maybe that’s just the lighting. But she still can’t tell if the storm from earlier has passed or if it’s just lying low.</p><p>Agatha’s lips are drawn in a tight, unreadable line. Is she still as angry as Rio is? Hard to tell. Rio’s drunken brain isn’t exactly the most reliable source right now.</p><p>“You called,” Agatha says, watching her while the bartender swipes her card.</p><p>Rio frowns. “No, I didn’t. Not to you, anyway.”</p><p>“Yes, you did,” Agatha says, just as the bartender returns and hands it over. “Though I’m guessing you meant to call Alice.”</p><p>Rio blinks, and her stomach drops as the pieces slowly start to come together. She hadn’t even looked at which name she tapped earlier. “Oh, shit,” she mutters, running a hand down her face.</p><p>Agatha slips her card back into her own purse. </p><p>“I hate to interrupt whatever…party you’ve decided to throw for yourself, but it’s time to go.”</p><p>Rio snorts. “I’m not going anywhere with you.” </p><p>It’s only then that she really notices how out of place Agatha looks in here, with her long jet black trench coat and blood-red pumps that have definitely never seen a sticky bar floor.</p><p>“Yes, you are. I just saved your ass, and I’d prefer not to waste the effort.”</p><p>Rio turns back to the bar. “Which, by the way, I clearly didn’t need you to do. I’ll pay you back tomorrow. Now, if you don’t mind, you can go. I can handle my own shit.”</p><p>“If you could, I wouldn’t be here. You’re drunk. Your phone is dead. You’re in a bar you can’t pay for. If this is you handling your shit, I’d hate to see the alternative.”</p><p>Before Rio can fire back, the bartender leans in and nods toward Agatha. </p><p>“You should probably go with your girlfriend, sweetheart.”</p><p>“She’s not my girlfriend!” Rio whips her head toward him. “And I’m not your sweetheart.”</p><p>The bartender raises his hands in surrender, and Rio sighs. </p><p>Great. Now she’s picking fights with bartenders. </p><p>She presses her fingers to her temple, trying to will away the slow throb building behind her eyes, then turns back to Agatha. “I really don’t need a babysitter. You can go home.”</p><p>“Not when you’re acting like someone who clearly does.” And before Rio can even come up with a comeback strong enough to knock her off her pedestal, Agatha adds, “There’s a car parked outside. You can argue with me here, on the sidewalk, or in the passenger seat of a warm Mercedes. Your choice.”</p><p>“Again, I’m not going anywhere with you, Agatha.” </p><p>Agatha exhales slowly, in a manner someone does when they’re trying very hard not to roll their eyes. </p><p>“You know I could easily pay someone here to carry you to my car. It would take all of thirty seconds.” Then, softer, but still unbending. “But I’d rather not do that. So I’m giving you a choice. Walk out with me like a functioning adult, or be dragged out and cause a scene. Either way, we’re both leaving.”</p><p>Rio knows Agatha doesn’t bluff. She makes a threat, and follows through.</p><p>With a groggy sweep of her half-lidded eyes, Rio scans the bar. Just her luck: it’s full of guys who could probably lift her without breaking a sweat, even if she kicked and screamed the whole way.</p><p>She looks down at the empty glass in front of her. Then at the dead, useless rectangle that is her phone. Then, finally, back up at Agatha’s expectant, unmoved face. </p><p>Rio groans and drops her head onto the counter again.</p><p>“I hate you.” Her voice is muffled but she knows Agatha heard it.</p><p>“Well, you wouldn’t be the first.”</p><p>There’s a pause. Then Rio stands and brushes past her, stumbling a little but ignoring the arm that reaches out to steady her.</p><p>Good thing Agatha doesn’t insist. She simply follows.</p><p>So this is what it feels like to walk ahead of her former formidable boss instead of behind. </p><p>Too bad she’s too angry, and too goddamn drunk, to revel in it.</p><p>True to Agatha’s word, there’s a car parked out front. But this time, Rio immediately notices there’s no Javier waiting inside.</p><p>Did Agatha actually drive here herself?</p><p>“Where’s your driver?”</p><p>“Home with his family.” </p><p>“And you didn’t call him to drive you?”</p><p>“I’m not a monster. And I figured you’d prefer I not ruin his night, too,” Agatha says, already opening the car door like it’s an order, not a suggestion. “Get in.”</p><p>Rio crosses her arms. “I’m not getting in that car.”</p><p>“I thought we already established that I’m the only adult in charge tonight. Get in the car, Rio.”</p><p>“I’d rather call a cab than get in that car with you.”</p><p>Rio had been cursing the alcohol ten minutes ago, but now she’s kind of grateful for it, because somehow, she’s managing to hold her ground against the unshakable Agatha Harkness. </p><p>God bless liquid courage.</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow. </p><p>“Your phone is dead. You don’t have your wallet. How do you plan to pay for that, exactly?”</p><p>Rio hiccups and immediately wants to disappear. If only said liquid courage came with a halfway functional brain to match. This is beyond embarrassing.</p><p>“Fine. Can I borrow ten bucks?” </p><p>Not exactly the power move she was hoping for.</p><p>It doesn’t help that she catches the tiniest twitch at the corner of Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Oh, Jesus. She’s finding this funny, isn’t she? The more she thinks about it, the more Rio wants to sink straight into the pavement and never come back up.</p><p>“Adorable, but no.” She schools her face into something more serious again. “Now stop wasting both our time and just get in.”</p><p>Rio stays planted, arms crossed, glaring and pouting like a kid refusing to get in the car after a bad day at school.</p><p>Agatha lets out an exhausted sigh. “Can we be done with the tantrum, please? I’d rather not be photographed here looking like I just dragged a college student out of a divebar.”</p><p>Another beat. Rio still doesn’t move. </p><p>If she could tie herself to the doorframe, she would. </p><p>Actually…that’s starting to sound like a solid plan.</p><p>But apparently, she’s pushed her luck far enough, because the next thing she knows, Agatha grabs her by the arm with all the calm of someone absolutely done.</p><p>“Alright, that’s it! I’ve had enough. In the car, now.”</p><p>“Ow,” Rio complains loudly, mostly for show. But Agatha’s already steering her toward the seat, one hand slipping behind her head so she doesn’t smack it on the way in.</p><p>She tells herself not to blush. Really, she tries. But a small, annoying part of her kind of wants to.</p><p>“Stay,” Agatha states, pointing at her. Their faces just inches apart as she clicks Rio’s seatbelt into place.</p><p>Rio fights the urge to swallow.</p><p>Agatha lingers for a second, then finally pulls away and heads for the driver’s seat.</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m doing this,” Rio hears her grumble just before the door shuts.</p><hr/><p>Rio doesn’t remember when she fell asleep, just that it was raining outside, the window glass was cold against her temple, and her head hurt like hell.</p><p>She only stirs when the car slows to a stop and the engine goes quiet. She blinks at the familiar townhouse outside.</p><p>“Why are we at your place?” she mumbles, still half-asleep.</p><p>“I couldn’t remember how to get to your apartment. Turns out having a driver for years kind of kills your sense of direction,” Agatha mutters, and Rio knows she’s right.</p><p>This is actually the first time she’s ever seen Agatha drive, and she’s not even sure if the woman has a license.</p><p>“You could’ve woken me up,” Rio grumbles, then winces. “God—my head.”</p><p>“Well, we’re here now, so unless you want to sleep in the car, stop complaining and come inside.”</p><p>Before Rio can even argue, Agatha grabs the umbrella from the backseat, circles around the car, and opens the door for her.</p><p>“Here, put your arm around me.” They squeeze under the same umbrella as they head up the stairs to Agatha’s front door and step inside the house.</p><p>They’re not soaked, but they’re not exactly dry either.</p><p>“Stay here. I’m getting a towel,” Agatha says, slipping off her trench coat, kicking off her heels, and leaving Rio on the couch as she heads upstairs.</p><p>It doesn’t take long before Agatha comes back to the living room.</p><p>She wraps the towel around Rio without saying a word, and Rio’s too out of it to even think about protesting. But even if she weren’t, she probably wouldn’t.</p><p>Because something about this: Agatha being gentle, quietly taking care of her, like they’re just two normal people, makes her want to stay right here.</p><p>Even with all the anger still buzzing under her skin, Rio can’t help it. </p><p>She still wants this. Still wants <em> her </em>.</p><p>“Take off your shirt,” Agatha tells her, snapping Rio out of her daze momentarily. </p><p>She blinks up at her, just as Agatha finishes towel-drying her short hair.</p><p>Realizing how that sounded, Agatha quickly adds, “I mean, your clothes are soaked. You need to change, or you’ll catch a cold. Here.” She holds out a soft, worn T-shirt. “It’s clean. Just…yeah.”</p><p>She turns away slightly, giving Rio her version of privacy.</p><p>Rio hesitates, then slowly peels off the damp shirt and pulls on the one Agatha gave her.</p><p>It’s soft, a little oversized, and smells devastatingly like Agatha and she has to physically stop herself from moaning like some kind of lovesick idiot. </p><p>Once it’s over her head and settled on her shoulders, she clears her throat. “You can turn around now.” </p><p>Agatha does. She looks like she’s about to say something, but stops. </p><p>Instead, Rio picks up the towel and gently pats at Agatha’s damp hair, brushing it off her shoulders. When Agatha doesn’t pull away, she keeps going.</p><p>“You didn’t have to come get me,” Rio mumbles, mostly to herself. The alcohol’s making her drowsy again, but even through the haze, she can feel the silence between them sitting heavy in her chest.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha says honestly, her eyes never leaving Rio.</p><p>“Then why did you?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer.</p><p>The scene from the office earlier flashes back in Rio’s mind. If everything that had happened didn’t mean anything to Agatha, then why did it still feel like it did? Like it still does.</p><p>In the way she speaks to her when she thinks Rio needs gentleness. In the way her hands linger when they touch. In the way her eyes seem to tell the truth her mouth refuses to.</p><p>They sit there, facing each other in silence, both waiting for the other to speak, while their eyes do all the talking.</p><p>Rain taps against the windows, and thunder starts to roll somewhere far off.</p><p>Rio’s voice cracks before she can stop it.</p><p>“Why don’t you want me?”</p><p>Agatha freezes, like she didn’t expect the words. “I…” Her mouth opens, then closes again. Her eyes drop to the floor. “I’ll just…get the guest room sorted.”</p><p>She stands and walks out before Rio can ask anything else.</p><p>Rio slumps against the arm of the couch, the towel still balled in her lap, and the sweet scent of Agatha’s shirt begins to cling stubbornly to her skin. She shuts her eyes.</p><hr/><p>When Rio wakes up for the second time that night, the house greets her with its usual silence.</p><p>It’s still raining outside and the thunder hasn’t let up either. </p><p>People should probably be worried. New York’s weather is starting to screw around.</p><p>She shifts on the couch, a blanket now draped over her chest. Then her eyes dart to the big wall clock. It’s already three in the morning. </p><p>Her head is still throbbing, but her gut tells her she needs to get out of here.</p><p>Rain or not, she doesn’t care, she’ll walk through it if she has to. She just doesn’t want to wake up and see Agatha’s face in the morning.</p><p>And Agatha probably feels the same way.</p><p>She slips on the shoes she kicked off earlier and heads down the hallway, moving slow and careful, even though she probably doesn’t need to, since Agatha’s likely asleep upstairs.</p><p>But just as she nears the door, a voice calls out from the kitchen.</p><p>“Rio? Is that you?”</p><p>She stops. Why the hell is Agatha still awake?</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer. For a second, she wonders if there’s someone else in the house. But the silence says otherwise. She shakes it off and keeps walking.</p><p>“It’s still raining,” Agatha calls out, her voice making it clear she hasn’t slept yet. “You’re not gonna find a cab outside at this hour. And walking nine miles in this weather isn’t exactly smart.” </p><p>Rio sighs. She hates that Agatha has a point, a point she refuses to acknowledge.</p><p>“I’m not exactly aiming for smart,” she shouts back, not bothering to turn around.</p><p>From the kitchen, Agatha fires back without missing a beat. </p><p>“And how’s that been working out for you so far?”</p><p>Rio spins halfway, ready to snap something equally biting. </p><p>But before she can, Agatha’s voice cuts in again. “Will you just come in here?”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes at the way Agatha makes it sound like a command, like she’s so sure Rio will listen.</p><p>She decides to ignore it, hand already on the doorknob, when Agatha adds, “Please, Rio.”</p><p>Rio fucking hates how all it takes to make her cave is Agatha Harkness saying please, with the added cruelty of tacking her name onto it. Like some magic spell that cracks straight through her defenses.</p><p>She groans under her breath, fists clenching like she might punch a wall, or herself. Then she sighs, mutters something unflattering, and pads toward the kitchen. </p><p>As she rounds the corner, Rio finds Agatha at the kitchen counter, a half-full glass of red wine in hand, a book resting beside the open bottle. </p><p>She’s in a matching set of soft olive pajama shirt and shorts, glasses perched on her nose, and soft waves of hair falling messily around her face in that unfairly perfect way that makes Rio maybe want to stare a little longer than she should.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything when Rio sits down across from her. She just stands, grabs a clean glass, and fills it with water instead of wine. She then places it in front of her.</p><p>“I’m not thirsty,” Rio lies. Her throat feels like sandpaper.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t even look up. “Do I have to make you drink it like a five-year-old?”</p><p>Rio sighs, dragging the glass toward her. “Fine.” She drinks, and the second the water hits her tongue, it’s like her whole body remembers how much it needed it.</p><p>Like she’s just been dragged out of a goddamn desert somewhere in Arizona. She downs the whole thing in three seconds flat.</p><p>Agatha just hums, not even trying to hide the smugness. She sets the pitcher down in front of them without saying anything else. And Rio quietly pours herself another glass.</p><p>After a full second of Rio audibly gulping her water, Agatha says, “You’re probably starving too.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio counters stubbornly, too fast and too defensive, praying her stomach doesn’t pull the same stunt it did last time Agatha asked her that. </p><p>It’s bad enough she just drank like a dehydrated animal in front of her. She doesn’t need a repeat of Agatha hearing her stomach growling loud enough to be heard across the room.</p><p>She already feels like a stray cat getting adopted by a rich, elegant cat lady.</p><p>If the cat lady also happened to be terrifying, beautiful, and the exact kind of person who makes Rio feel confused, hurt, embarrassed, flustered, and just plain crazy.</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow but doesn’t argue. Instead, she takes another sip of wine, rests her elbows on the counter, and goes back to her book. </p><p>Meanwhile, Rio shifts in her seat, suddenly too aware of how the oversized shirt keeps slipping off her shoulder.</p><p>She glances at Agatha, watching her for a moment too long before clearing her throat and turning toward the window, focusing on the soft patter of rain against the glass.</p><p>The silence stretches between them, almost peaceful and calm, until a low, deep rumble of thunder rolls in and breaks it.</p><p>Just as Rio predicted, Agatha flinches.</p><p>She shuts her eyes almost instantly, holds them shut for a bit, then opens them again and takes a small breath, which Rio wouldn’t have noticed if she hadn’t already been watching.</p><p>“Is this why you’re still awake?” Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look up. “One of a few reasons.”</p><p>Rio props her elbow on the counter, resting her cheek against her hand as she watches Agatha. </p><p>She’s always wondered why the sound of thunder seemed to rattle someone usually so composed. </p><p>The question has been sitting with her for a while, ever since that night at the hotel, but she’s never been brave enough to ask.</p><p>And she doesn’t want to push. Not now, especially, when the chances of Agatha actually opening up feel close to zero.</p><p>Then, to her surprise, Agatha speaks.</p><p>“When I was a kid, I used to love playing in the rain,” she starts, eyes still on her book. “But only when I was lucky enough to get the chance. Usually when my mother was away on a church retreat with her friends and my father was out on a business trip or working late. I’d sneak past the nannies and into Marmee’s backyard. Just run around out there for hours until I was soaked and covered in mud.”</p><p>A small smile slowly forms on Rio’s face as she pictures little Agatha, soaked and muddy, running around in the rain.</p><p>She and Alice used to do the same thing when they were kids. But the thought of Agatha not being able to do it freely the way a kid should, dulls the smile just as quickly. </p><p>“I was nine when I told my mother I thought this new girl from church was pretty. With her pigtails and little blue dress,” Agatha goes on. “I didn’t even really understand what I was saying. I didn’t even know I liked girls yet. I just thought she was simply pretty.”</p><p>She still doesn’t look at Rio when she says it.</p><p>“That’s why I was so confused when my mother locked me in my room after that and made me fast for three days. Said I shouldn’t be entertaining ‘iniquitous’ thoughts.” She lets out a dry laugh. “I was a very smart kid, but even I didn’t know what the hell that word meant.”</p><p>Rio feels something twist in her gut. How could a mother do something like that to her own child?</p><p>“But that wasn’t the worst part,” Agatha continues, and she looks like she’s using every bit of courage just to say it out loud. Rio almost opens her mouth to tell her she doesn’t have to share it if she doesn’t want to, but Agatha pushes through anyway. </p><p>“She ignored me for weeks. Then one night, there was a storm. Thunder so loud it shook the windows. She told me that if I was still thinking sinful thoughts…God would hear me clearer if I was outside.”</p><p>Rio’s chest stays still, bracing for what she already suspects comes next. Can a mother really be that cruel to her own flesh and blood?</p><p>“She dragged me into the yard. Barefoot. Still in my nightgown. Locked the door and left me there,” she carries on, still not looking at her. “I stood there for hours. Soaked, shivering, begging God to stop being mad at me, even though I didn’t understand what I’d done wrong. I prayed for the rain to stop. The storm. The thunder. Or whatever it was in me that made my own mother hate me so suddenly. But it didn’t. I just cried until I made myself sick.”</p><p>She turns toward the window, eyes following the rain as she slowly swirls the wine in her glass.</p><p>“I was nine,” she repeats, probably thinking the same question Rio is. </p><p>How could anyone do that to a child?</p><p>Rio doesn’t say a word. Because really, what can you say to something like that? </p><p>Now, all she can think about is every time she stood face to face with Evanora, and how stupid she was not to sock that woman straight in the jaw while she had the chance.</p><p>Agatha drains the last of her wine and sets the glass down. “Anyway. Now you know.” </p><p>Agatha pours herself another glass, but Rio notices the way her shoulders have gone more rigid.</p><p>“What about your dad?” Rio finally asks, “Didn’t he find out?”</p><p>“There are a lot of things my father doesn’t know about me,” Agatha answers, with none of the warmth Rio usually has when she talks about her own parents. “Whether it’s because he really doesn’t, or simply because he just doesn’t care enough to.”</p><p>“And Marmee?”</p><p>“They weren’t home that night,” says Agatha. “And I never told them. I knew Marmee and Henry would’ve tried to stand up for me, but I also knew what my mother was capable of. So, I didn’t say anything.” She pauses, swirling her wine again. “But that was it. That was the worst thing my mother ever did to me as a child. After that, I slowly started making her life hell. So, I think I still got even.”</p><p>She gives Rio a faint, dry smile, but Rio can’t bring herself to return it. “I’m sorry,” she tells her. “I’m really sorry you had to go through that.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything. She just lifts her glass in acknowledgment, and drinks.</p><p>Nothing is said for a while, until Agatha sets her glass down again, the sound almost lost in the rain.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she says, not quite looking at Rio. “For what I said earlier. At the office. I was wrong for saying things I knew would upset you.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t look at her either. “Yeah, you’ve made a habit of that lately. Saying the wrong things.” </p><p>“Only because I never know how to say the right ones when it’s you.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t know how to respond to that. </p><p>There are still parts of this conundrum in front of her — this impossible, infuriating, terrifying, beautiful, and deeply guarded woman — that she doesn’t fully understand. Agatha says one thing, means another, and holds the rest close to her chest. </p><p>But for reasons Rio can’t always explain, she still wants to keep trying. Even when it’s confusing. Even when it’s hard.</p><p>Something in her keeps choosing to understand Agatha, over and over, again and again.</p><p>Then Agatha finally looks at her and closes her book. “Well,” she says, and Rio can already tell she’s about to change the subject. “Are you going to explain why that woman kissed you?”</p><p>Surprise jolts through Rio. “I—” Hela kissing her was the last thing she thought Agatha would bring up again. “I thought you said we didn’t owe each other explanations,” she answers, blinking at her.</p><p>“Wasn’t that also what my apology was for?” Agatha lifts one of her brows.</p><p>Rio tries not to visibly cheer at the fact that, in her own guarded and roundabout way, Agatha is taking back what she said.</p><p>That what happened between them matters enough for her to care that Rio’s lips were on someone else.</p><p>That seeing Rio with another woman got under her skin enough to need an explanation.</p><p>Which totally goes against what she said earlier that upset Rio in the first place.</p><p>“I mean, I already told you, it was nothing.”</p><p>“That doesn’t really tell me anything.”</p><p>“It tells you everything.” Rio meets her eyes, hoping Agatha can see how earnest she is.</p><p>“So, you’re not into her?”</p><p>“And why would I be? When all I’ve been thinking about is you?”</p><p>Rio feels her stomach twist in a way that’s hard to name. It’s the first time she’s laid her cards out so clearly in front of Agatha, and the woman just stares at her, inanimate and unmoving.</p><p>For a second, Rio wonders if Agatha can hear her heart pounding from across the counter.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, sets her reading glasses down, and rises to her feet. </p><p>“I’m going to bed,” she announces.</p><p>And Rio tries and fails to keep the disappointment off her face. </p><p>Her eyes drop to Agatha’s abandoned wine glass, unsure now if she said too much.</p><p>But right before disappearing down the hall, Agatha stops and throws a glance over her shoulder.</p><p>“Well? Are you coming or not?”</p><p>Rio’s head snaps up in Agatha’s direction. It takes her a second to process what she just heard.</p><p>“I—what?” </p><p>She crosses her arms, eyes locked on Rio the entire time. </p><p>“To bed. Unless you’re feeling especially attached to that couch.”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth but then shuts it again, too stunned to come up with anything clever. Her heart’s pounding loud in her ears as she slowly stands, legs almost unsure beneath her. And she walks toward Agatha before her brain can even make sense of why.</p><p>“I’ll be fine on the couch. Really.” </p><p>Rio wants to slap herself for that answer. Either she’s being delusional for reading too much into what Agatha just said, or she’s being dumb for pretending it didn’t sound exactly like an invitation. </p><p>Either way, one of them is being vague on purpose, and Rio can’t tell if it’s Agatha, or just her own hopeful imagination getting ahead of her.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio can only nod as Agatha suddenly moves in front of her, close enough that her back nearly hits the wall. “I don’t think you are, honey,” Agatha adds, and she steps even closer.</p><p>Rio holds Agatha’s gaze, her stomach twisting with that nervous, breathless, fluttery feeling she always gets when they’re this close. It rises fast, warm and aching, filling her chest, crowding her throat, and suddenly all the words she wants to say are stuck.</p><p>“Do you also think about this, whenever you let yourself think of me?”</p><p>Agatha’s warm breath carries the rich scent of the expensive red wine she’s been drinking since, well, God knows when. But Rio can tell she’s sober enough to know exactly what she’s doing.</p><p>“What do you think?” Rio finally finds her voice. She’s almost certain Agatha can hear the thunder in her chest. It feels like whatever line they’ve been tiptoeing around has just split clean down the middle.</p><p>A sluggish smile spreads across Agatha’s bare face, tugging at her soft lips, rounding her high cheekbones, and warming her blue eyes. It feels like finding a window open in a locked room.</p><p>Then her eyes drop to Rio’s lips, and the look alone sends a jolt of heat through her entire system. She sucks in a breath and instinctively squeezes her legs shut. </p><p>Her chest rises and falls, her lips part just slightly, and her green-rimmed eyes drop to Agatha’s mouth before lifting back to meet her blue eyes again.</p><p>She looks at Agatha the way you trace a scar on someone you love, and Agatha mirrors the path just as closely.</p><p>The gap between them suddenly feels vexing, a slow tug-of-war of will-they-won’t-they, so heady and rhapsodic that it makes Rio feel even more drunk than she was at the bar. </p><p>She doesn’t even realize she’s the first to slightly lean in.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen, a physiognomy that can only be called an agglomeration of astonishment and yearning.</p><p>“I think you do.” Her voice drops deliciously deep, causing Rio to suck in another obvious breath, her tongue slithering out to lick her lower lip.</p><p>A deeper heat settles low in Rio’s belly, mixed with a sense of satisfaction.</p><p>It’s the only way to describe the feeling flowing through her. She’s about to kiss Agatha, and Agatha is about to kiss her.</p><p>But this time, not surprised, not caught off guard, but both fully aware and ready for what they’re about to do.</p><p>She slowly pulls at Agatha’s top, drawing her closer against her body, and Agatha smiles as her fingers brush along Rio’s arm.</p><p>Rio then slips her hands around Agatha’s waist, holding her gently, and the latter looks at her before moving her hands to Rio’s forearms, curling her fingers around Rio’s toned biceps before letting them slide up to her shoulders.</p><p>“I think I do too,” she says, as Agatha’s hands rise to cradle her face before leaning in slowly, letting her lips hover over hers.</p><p>They lock eyes again, their uneven breaths loud enough for both of them to hear. </p><p>Then Agatha moves her mouth to Rio's jaw, brushing just below her ear, then slowly trailing across her cheek, over her temple, up to her forehead, down the bridge of her nose, and finally back to the other corner of her lips.</p><p>One corner of Rio’s mouth lifts, a smile she can’t help. She gently brushes her nose against Agatha’s.</p><p>“This is sweet and all, but if you don’t kiss me soon, I might actually start begging.”</p><p>Agatha leans back just slightly, a slow, knowing grin curving her lips.</p><p>“Believe me, I’d have no moral objections to that.”</p><p>Rio spreads both hands across Agatha’s waist and pulls her in closer. </p><p>“You’d enjoy that, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>“Very much.” </p><p>Finally, Agatha presses her lips to Rio’s bottom lip. Slow at first, then deeper, hungrier, like she’s trying to memorize the shape of her mouth. </p><p>“You’re shaking,” Rio manages to whisper against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“So are you.” </p><p>Rio tries to keep pace, heart drumming between her chest, but the second Agatha’s tongue brushes hers, something rough tears out of Rio — a deep, hungry sound pulled from her chest. </p><p>Agatha responds without hesitation, opening her mouth fully to her as if that sound was exactly what she’d been waiting for.</p><p>Agatha tastes like merlot, perhaps with hints of vanilla or berries, or whatever was in that pricey wine bottle left behind in the kitchen. Either way, Rio can’t get enough of it. </p><p>She’s so caught up in the way their tongues move together that she barely notices Agatha guiding them toward the living room.</p><p>Agatha’s hands are in her hair, along her neck, then slipping down to the small of her back.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio’s hands find their way under Agatha’s shirt, fingers trailing along her bare hips like they’ve been waiting forever for the chance to touch her like this.</p><p>Their kiss only breaks when the back of Rio’s knees bump into the couch, sending her tumbling into the pillows with a soft gasp.</p><p>But it doesn’t even take long before she’s pulling Agatha down on top of her.</p><p>Both of them burst into laughter, but when Agatha purposely slides her knee between Rio’s legs, their playful cadence shifts into something heavier.</p><p>And just like that, Rio flips them over. Her aching need to go down on this untouchable, breathtaking woman becomes utterly unendurable. </p><p>But she plans to take her time, savor every second of it.</p><p>Rio’s hands slip under Agatha’s shirt again, gliding over her stomach and then up along her ribs, moving closer to the breasts she’s been aching to touch, and more than anything, to taste.</p><p>“Is this okay?” Rio asks, her thumb just resting near the edge of Agatha’s bra. Agatha simply gives a small nod, so Rio unclasps it and lets it slip to the floor.</p><p>Then she slides her knee between Agatha’s thighs, pressing right where she thinks Agatha wants it most. </p><p>She kisses Agatha again, their tongues moving together as if they’ve done this a hundred times in their heads, making Rio’s whole body ache with want. </p><p>And they’re not even fully undressed yet. </p><p>Then she trails lower, pressing hungry, almost bruising kisses along Agatha’s jaw, the side of her throat, and down to the base of her neck. </p><p>Shortly, her hands drift up to Agatha’s chest, gently rubbing and lightly pinching her breasts before brushing her thumbs over Agatha’s nipples.</p><p>A startled breath slips from the woman beneath her before she can stop it. Her rosy peaks harden right away, even with Rio still touching through her shirt.</p><p>She arches her back, clearly needing more, so Rio gives it to her.</p><p>She lowers her head and closes her mouth around Agatha’s right breast, still over the fabric, while one hand keeps teasing the other.</p><p>Agatha gasps, and Rio knows she feels the heat of her tongue even through the shirt. </p><p>“Honey, if you’re planning to undress me at all, I’d suggest doing it now. We’re not seriously doing this fully clothed, are we?” Agatha manages between ragged breaths, clearly growing impatient.</p><p>A chuckle escapes Rio as she pulls back just enough to look up. “Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing.” She then presses another kiss to her covered nipple before meeting her eyes again. “Do you trust me?”</p><p>Agatha looks at her, visibly exasperated, yet her hand is impossibly gentle as she strokes Rio’s cheek, fingers coming to rest at her chin. “As torturously slow as this is, I do trust you.” Rio leans into the touch. “Now, by all means, don’t let me stop you from continuing at your glacial pace.”</p><p>“Yes, m’lady,” Rio grins, flashing that little gap in her teeth, but before she can get another word out, Agatha sinks her fingers into her hair and firmly guides her mouth back down to her chest.</p><p>Rio hears Agatha let out a breath as her hand keeps moving, exploring.</p><p>But Rio is determined to draw more than just that, so she sucks Agatha’s nipple into her mouth again, more deliberately this time, but still through the fabric, and smiles when she hears the needy moan it pulls from her.</p><p>“Rio, for the love of—just keep going,” Agatha says, and Rio’s pretty sure she could come just from hearing those desperate sounds coming out of her former boss. She feels Agatha start to lift her shirt, probably wanting to feel more, but Rio gently pulls it back down.</p><p>“Not just yet.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a noise somewhere between a groan and a whine. “You can’t be serious.”</p><p>Rio leans in close, stopping just before their mouths meet. “I thought you trusted me?”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha says. “But you’re making it really hard right now.”</p><p>Rio laughs softly, hands moving to the waistband of Agatha’s pajama shorts. “Just relax, okay?”</p><p>“Relaxing isn’t exactly my strong suit.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio tells her, her voice gentle. “That’s why we’re taking our time.” Then she runs her finger lightly along the waistband of Agatha’s underwear. “Is this okay?”</p><p>Agatha only nods. And holy hell, if anyone had told Rio she’d one day be drinking in the sight of the powerful, usually-so-in-control Agatha freaking Harkness — now breathless, flushed, and open beneath her — she wouldn’t have believed it.</p><p>“I need to hear the words, Agatha. Say it.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha breathes out, barely holding it together. “God, yes. Please.”</p><p>Then Rio’s hand finally slips into Agatha’s pajama shorts, brushing over the soft patch of hair beneath her now clearly damp underwear. “Thank God you have hair,” she mutters before she can stop herself.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha glances down, brow raised.</p><p>“I mean, I just thought you’re one of those models who shave everything,” Rio says honestly. </p><p>Who could blame her? </p><p>Agatha works in fashion, and Rio’s seen enough magazine shoots to assume that look came with the territory.</p><p>Not that she’s against shaving, she just doesn’t think women should go through all that effort unless they actually want to.</p><p>“Would you have preferred that?”</p><p>“Jesus, no. Yours is perfect,” Rio answers quickly, though not as quick as the unhurried rhythm she keeps with her hands. </p><p>She leaves their clothes on, her fingers moving over the soft fabric of Agatha’s underwear.</p><p>Tracing, testing, drawing soft shapes, grazing back and forth in measured, thoughtful motions, as if she’s tuning into every tiny signal Agatha gives her.</p><p>Agatha spreads her legs a little wider to allow Rio more access, which Rio gratefully accepts. She applies a bit more pressure, slipping two fingers from Agatha’s opening up to just beneath her clit.</p><p>She feels Agatha’s body react immediately to it, shifting toward her touch, and the warm, sweet, heady scent of her arousal fills the space between them.</p><p>“You’re so soft and warm down here.” Rio lies close along Agatha’s side, their bodies touching, but she doesn’t kiss her, still doesn’t rush. Instead, she stays pressed in, her fingers moving in insouciant circles over the heat between Agatha’s thighs. “All this just for me?”</p><p>“Will saying yes speed this up or just make you smug?”</p><p>“A little bit of both,” Rio muses with a grin, then gets back to work. This time with even more fervor. </p><p>Rio knows the combination of her fingers and the rub of Agatha’s underwear on her core is almost too much.</p><p>So she listens closely to every sound Agatha makes, adjusting her touch with care to match.</p><p>It doesn’t take long before Rio feels Agatha’s body start to tremble, light at first, then building. </p><p>She can feel her grinding down against her hand, clutching at her shoulders like she needs something to hold on to.</p><p>So Rio hooks her free arm around Agatha’s waist, pressing her closer while her fingers do unspeakably good things to her clit.</p><p>“I think I can’t—I can’t take it anymore,” she hears Agatha gasp and moan, nails digging into Rio’s skin. “Please, Rio. I need you to make me come. Please, I need to come.”</p><p>Jesus. At this rate, Rio might be the one to come first. Just from hearing Agatha beg like this. She feels powerful, sure, but there’s a kind of power that also leaves her completely undone.</p><p>The kind that crawls under her skin and burns through her. Not because she don’t have control, but because <em> she</em> does.</p><p>Because she’s the reason Agatha’s falling apart like this, saying her name, pleading for release like there’s no one else who could give it to her. It’s too much. It’s too good. It’s fucking everything. </p><p>And it’s taking her apart from the inside out.</p><p>She dips her head and bites hungrily at the skin just above Agatha’s breast, her teeth grazing through the fabric as her fingers work harder and harder against her clit. </p><p>Rio can practically feel a surge of heat building inside Agatha.</p><p>So relentless, sudden, and all-consuming that it floods every part of her, mercilessly.</p><p>The fabric between her legs grows soaked and catches every bit of it.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck—” Agatha lets out a string of raw, helpless sounds as she comes.</p><p>Rio’s both stunned and deeply satisfied that the other woman doesn’t hold any of it back.</p><p>She tightens her grip on Agatha’s waist, her hand still moving, not stopping until every last tremor passes.</p><p>It takes a few breathless heartbeats before Rio hears Agatha speak again, and she wonders: just how far out of Earth’s orbit she sent her.</p><p>“Okay. Okay, I need a second,” Agatha pants once she’s finally back on solid ground. “God, that was embarrassing. I mean, that was—”</p><p>Rio brushes the damp hair from Agatha’s forehead. “That was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen,” she murmurs, still dazed herself, bemused by the way Agatha had come undone right in front of her.</p><p>Agatha can only look at her with half-lidded eyes as Rio presses a soft kiss to her cheek.</p><p>“Now I need to know what it’s like to have you come in my mouth,” she whispers against her skin. Her hands slide down to Agatha’s ass, pulling her even closer. “Is that okay?”</p><p>“That’s literally what I’ve been asking for this whole time.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t bother hiding her amusement. She lets out another soft chuckle, kisses Agatha quickly on the lips, then yanks her pajama bottoms off and tosses them somewhere behind her. Probably where Agatha’s bra ended up.</p><p>“Not exactly the scenario I had in mind for our first time,” Rio quips as she lifts Agatha’s shirt over her head and also tosses it aside.</p><p>It takes her a second to fully register what she’s seeing. How she’s really looking at Agatha’s bare chest. How she never thought she’d get to see it, let alone taste it.</p><p>And god, her breasts. Rio thinks they’re almost too breathtaking to look at for long. Somehow, impossibly, even more unreal and so goddamn perfect than she’d dared to imagine.</p><p>“Would you have preferred a bed? We could still go upstairs.”</p><p>“No,” Rio answers quickly, shaking her head as she pulls herself out of her thoughts. “It’s not the picture-perfect setup, but trust me, I wouldn’t want it any other way.” She trails her fingers along the waistband of Agatha’s underwear. “May I take these off?”</p><p>Something gentler hides behind the smirk when Agatha asks, “Will you always be this polite every time we have sex?”</p><p>Rio chuckles at the comment, but then her head snaps up as the words really land.</p><p>“Every time?” she asks, almost unsure she heard right.</p><p>Agatha frowns at the question, and for a second, something passes across her face, something that makes Rio regret even asking. </p><p>But then Agatha pulls herself back.</p><p>“Considering you just made me come with my clothes still on. I’d say that earns you a second time. Maybe even a third.” Then, she leans in. “Now please, continue what you said you were supposed to do”</p><p>But Rio doesn’t want just a second or a third. She wants more.</p><p>So she cups Agatha’s breasts, rolling her nipples between her thumbs and fingers, then lowers her head again.</p><p>Her tongue circles one of Agatha’s hardened tips, and this time, there’s nothing between them. No fabric, and just skin.</p><p>Agatha lets out a sound Rio doesn’t even understand, but god, she loves hearing it, especially with Agatha’s hands gripping her hair as she kisses her way down, mouth brushing over her belly and the soft skin just below.</p><p>Yeah. That should convince Agatha to also want more than just a second or a third.</p><p>She hooks both thumbs into the sides of Agatha’s underwear and starts sliding them down slowly, but just like she predicted, Agatha’s too impatient to wait and yanks them off herself.</p><p>Rio bites back a laugh at what Agatha just did, but a thought follows right after.</p><p>“Hold on, I’ve got something better in mind,” she says, earning a soft whine from Agatha. “Trust me, you’ll be more comfortable this way.”</p><p>She lets her mouth trail softly down Agatha’s arm, planting gentle kisses along the way, then takes their hands together and slowly guides them both to the floor. </p><p>Luckily for both of them, there’s a clean carpet underneath. And since Agatha doesn’t protest, Rio figures it must be, probably thanks to her housekeeper who changes it every couple of days.</p><p>Agatha starts to lie down beside her, but Rio shakes her head. “No, not there,” she says, patting her chest with a soft smile. “Right here.”</p><p>Agatha squints at her. “Seriously?”</p><p>Rio catches the confusion on Agatha’s face. And sure, she’s already made her come once, but now — with Agatha fully bare in front of her — asking her to sit on her face feels a little bold for a first time. </p><p>Still, Rio wants it. She wants her. She wants to take care of her the way she knows she needs to be taken care of, especially someone like Agatha, who keeps so much of herself locked away, yet letting Rio see her like this anyway.</p><p>Rio beams and sits up, gently guiding Agatha to straddle her waist. “Come closer.” Then she lies back down, hands still on Agatha’s hips as she pulls her up, closer to her mouth.</p><p>Rio sees the way Agatha hesitates.</p><p>“You really want me to—” she starts, but doesn’t finish, clearly realizing what Rio’s asking, and that she’s the only one completely naked.</p><p>So Rio doesn’t even think twice. She pulls off her shirt, unhooks her bra, and tosses them aside. Something she probably should’ve done earlier, if she hadn’t been too busy obsessing over the sight of this woman.</p><p>But now, with Agatha clearly letting herself be this vulnerable, Rio wants to meet her there.</p><p>Rio’s not exactly the bustiest, but her breasts are firm, and she’s always been confident they looked good.</p><p>And judging by the way Agatha swallows, her pupils darkening a shade, that confidence feels completely justified.</p><p>Still, she can’t help but blush. “I wish you could see yourself the way I see you right now. You’re very beautiful,” she says softly, brushing her thumb gently over Agatha’s wetness, then bringing it to her mouth. She sucks it slowly, eyes never leaving Agatha’s. “And I really want you to.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth falls open in surprise, and Rio laughs endearingly, sliding her hands around Agatha’s hips and guiding her up again.</p><p>In no time, Agatha is straddling her shoulders, her knees pressing into the carpet as Rio wraps both arms around the backs of her thighs. </p><p>“Oh, God,” Agatha breathes as Rio’s mouth closes over her, and Rio can’t help but hum in response. She knows the vibration alone might be enough to send Agatha floating. </p><p>She takes her time, moving slowly, kissing gently, lingering in the soft places where Agatha’s thighs meet her hips, before finally making her way back to where Agatha needs her most.</p><p>When her tongue eventually dips into Agatha’s wet heat, Rio hears her gasp, hands flying back to grip Rio’s hips for balance.</p><p>Then Agatha starts to move her hips, grinding slowly over her mouth, and Rio is more than happy to follow her lead.</p><p>The sounds Agatha makes now are rougher and more raw than earlier, and Rio feels a little proud hearing them.</p><p>“You like it when I do that?” she asks against Agatha’s wet skin. Agatha can only nod and bite her lip, clearly lost in herself as something deeper takes over.</p><p>Instead, she adjusts a little, leaning over Rio and sliding her hands into Rio’s short hair. Rio’s fingers rest on Agatha’s ass while her tongue moves over her wet cunt, dipping inside before her lips close around her clit and eventually suck. She pulls back a little.</p><p>“Is this okay?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s perfect. God, you’re perfect,” Agatha gasps, grinding harder against Rio’s mouth. The way she’s lost in it pushes Rio deeper, more focused. “Oh, God, yes, right there. Rio, don’t stop!”</p><p>So Rio keeps kissing, flicking, sucking, and letting out soft moans of her own.</p><p>“Fuck,” she hears Agatha again and again and again as Rio’s mouth moves ardently. “Rio, fuck,” Agatha breathes out, and then she’s coming. Shaking hard, eyes shut so tight, and mouth wide open. </p><p>Jesus fucking Christ! Rio’s had a handful of women come for her in her twenty-five years on Earth, but none of them even come close to this.</p><p>Because Agatha really is by far the most breathtaking thing she’s ever seen.</p><p>And Rio wants to remember every second, every sound, every look, every breath, every touch.</p><p>She wants to burn the whole image into her brain so she never, ever forgets.</p><p>Agatha then presses down harder and harder against her mouth, fingers buried so deep in Rio’s scalp it makes Rio’s own clit throb. </p><p>“Alright. That was—Again, that was—” Agatha manages after a few long seconds, and Rio can’t hide the satisfied grin forming on her lips, knowing it clearly took Agatha a while to recover from the second orgasm she just gave her.</p><p>Agatha then moves down from Rio’s shoulders and straddles her hips.</p><p>“Perfect?” Rio smirks as she looks up at her, propping herself up on both her elbows.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but the corners of her mouth are already turning up.</p><p>“Oh, stop giving me that face.”</p><p>“Can’t help it.” Rio’s still grinning, like a kid who found all the birthday presents early. “This face is permanent now. I might actually frame it and hang it over my bed.”</p><p>Agatha laughs, and for a second, Rio thinks maybe she should be framing that smile instead of her own.</p><p>Then Agatha leans down and kisses her. It’s slow, and Rio can tell she’s tasting herself on her lips.</p><p>But there’s more than just lust and hunger in the kiss, there’s something tender in it too, something gentle and soft that Rio feels deep in her chest.</p><p>“My turn,” she says against Rio’s lips, gently dragging her nails down her neck.</p><p>And Jesus, Rio isn’t ready for how Agatha’s eyes darken even more, similar to a predator finally closing in on her prey.</p><p>She starts kissing down the middle of Rio’s chest, then her stomach, then the skin just above her waistband before pulling both her pants and shorties off.</p><p>“Now we’re almost even,” she says. </p><p>And by <em> almost</em>, she means she’s about to take Rio apart just like Rio did to her.</p><p>She moves Rio’s hands off her hips and extends both arms above her head.</p><p>Rio starts to protest, but stops when Agatha lowers her head and drags her canine roughly across her collarbone.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Rio sobs as Agatha does it again. </p><p>This time on the side of her left breast, paired with a cruel grind of her hips.</p><p>After a bit, Agatha lets go of her hands, but hell, like always, Rio would do anything this woman asked, so she keeps her arms right where they are, offering herself up completely, and letting Agatha do whatever she wants.</p><p>Her hands slide down to cradle Rio’s breasts, thumbs brushing over her already stiff nipples before pressing them into her own chest, drawing a grunt from both their mouths.</p><p>“Holy fuck,” Rio moans, squirming beneath her. “You feel too fucking good.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha gasps for breath, voice breaking apart. She grinds down harder on Rio, her whole body chasing friction like she’s starving for it, her center slick and desperate.</p><p>Her nipples drag with almost cruel slowness but frantic need over Rio’s now-hard peaks, like she can’t get close enough, can’t get enough.</p><p>“I need—fuck, I don’t even—” But the rest dies in her throat as her eyes slam shut, and a desperate moan tears from her lips, like she can’t hold it back either.</p><p>Rio always thinks her favorite sound is Agatha’s laugh, only to discover it might be her moan too. And now, she’s set on hearing it again and again. </p><p>Rio’s hips are starting to move on their own, the need to touch Agatha again, to make her come again and to come herself, only getting stronger.</p><p>But just as she reaches up to grab Agatha’s waist, Agatha opens her eyes, stops humping, grabs Rio’s wrists, and pins them back down. </p><p>“No. You stay right there.” </p><p>Agatha then moves fast, letting her fingers crawl down to Rio’s core.</p><p>She slowly slides two fingers in, up to the second knuckle, and Rio’s eyes squeeze shut the second she feels it.</p><p>She opens her eyes again and sees Agatha looking down at her, their faces merely inches apart.</p><p>And something in Agatha’s now dark, dilated pupils suddenly hypnotizes her, and Rio shoots up to claim her lips.</p><p>To her pleasure, her own movement pushes Agatha’s fingers deeper.</p><p>“Fuck. Fuck, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha keeps touching her, watching every reaction Rio makes. How she looks like she needs more, like it’s the only thing keeping her breathing, even though it’s actually leaving her breathless.</p><p>Agatha must see it in her face, because she instantly drops her head, traps a nipple between her teeth, and moans like she can feel it just as much as Rio does.</p><p>Agatha keeps her eyes on Rio’s face, even while she stays completely engrossed in her chest. </p><p>“I want both our hands on you. Can you do that? Touch yourself for me,” she grumbles, sounding more like a command than a request. And Jesus, Rio feels like she might actually pass out.</p><p>Still, she obeys, slipping a hand down between them, her fingers brushing alongside Agatha’s. </p><p>“Yes, just like that, Rio. Do you feel how good you are? That’s it, honey. Keep going.”</p><p>It’s too much, too good, as Rio strokes her clit in quick, frenzied circles.</p><p>Her brain is in a jumble, but she is well aware that there’s no point in slowing down, not when Agatha already has her so tightly coiled.</p><p>Every time Agatha curls her fingers just right and finds that perfect spot, Rio’s gasps catch in her throat and fall apart into desperate, broken whimpers.</p><p>And Agatha continues watching her with the same kind of control she carries every time she walks into a room: focused, unflinching, like she always is when she wants to get something exactly right, when she’s set on making it perfect. </p><p>So it doesn’t take long before Rio is grunting, keening, panting, and almost shaking all over.</p><p>She doesn’t even recognize the sounds spilling out of her mouth, only knows that every thrust of Agatha’s fingers drives her further out of her head and deeper into the feeling.</p><p>She keeps losing pace on her clit, too caught up in the pull deep in her belly.</p><p>The kind that builds and builds and builds as if someone’s pumping air into a tire and forgot to close the valve, and now that tire is about to fucking burst.</p><p>And Rio knows she’s close. </p><p>“I can’t—I’m gonna—fuck, I’m gonna come.” She stops rubbing her own clit and presses down hard, her whole body, mostly her thighs, shaking as the orgasm crashes over her, pulsing around Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>Rio doesn’t know how long she’s been floating, only comes back to herself when she feels Agatha’s fingers on her chin, followed by a soft kiss on her lips.</p><p>The unexpected gesture makes her bite the inside of her cheek, trying hard to box up the dopey smile tugging at the edges of her mouth.</p><p>“Still planning on framing this face?” she hears her say through hooded eyes.</p><p>“Oh, shut up,” Rio rebuts, and Agatha climbs off her, settling on her side.</p><p>Wordlessly, Rio grabs the blanket from the couch and drapes it over both of them.</p><hr/><p>Turns out Agatha isn’t much of a cuddler when she sleeps. She doesn’t spoon, either. But she is something else entirely.</p><p>When they were both too tired to chase what was probably their fifth orgasm each, Agatha didn’t bother rolling over. She just went boneless on top of Rio and fell asleep. </p><p>Which is how Rio ends up brushing soft, fragrant waves out of her face as she breathes through the oddly comforting post-coital weight of the woman currently pressed against her.</p><p>Agatha must feel Rio stirring, because she groans and lifts her head just enough to squint at her. </p><p>“What time is it?”</p><p>Rio rubs her eyes and blinks up at the clock on the wall. </p><p>She almost laughs, realizing they’re still lying on the floor.</p><p>“It’s almost seven.” Her voice is probably the groggiest she’s ever heard it. Unsurprising, considering they’ve barely gotten two hours of sleep. Then again, it’s Saturday, and she’s pretty sure Agatha doesn’t have work. “Do you have to be somewhere?”</p><p>“I do, actually. Lunch with Pepper at Pastis.” Agatha sounds mildly annoyed, but instead of getting up like Rio expects, she just burrows in closer, nestling her nose against Rio’s collarbone. “Tell me if I’m crushing you.”</p><p>Rio lets out a dramatic groan, also not even trying to hide her grin. </p><p>“Yeah. I think my back might actually need a chiropractor after this.”</p><p>Agatha lifts her head again, already scowling. </p><p>“Then why didn’t you say so? I’ll get off—”</p><p>But Rio’s arms are already around her, locking her in before she can move.</p><p>“No. Stay right there.”</p><p>”But you just said I’m crushing you,” her voice comes out muffled against Rio’s collarbone, and Rio can practically hear the pout in it too.</p><p>Rio chuckles, nuzzling her nose into Agatha’s thick, messy hair as her fingers trail lazily down her spine. </p><p>“Yeah, well, I don’t really mind. I like you like this.”</p><p>The words slip out so casually, so easy and so natural that she doesn’t even pause to consider what she’s just said.</p><p>Not until she feels Agatha’s shoulder tense slightly does she realize just how soft and perhaps a little too open she sounded.</p><p>There’s a short pause before Agatha slowly starts to pull away from her arms. Rio lets her, even though her first instinct is to pull her back in.</p><p>“I’m starving,” Agatha murmurs, brushing a hand down Rio’s arm almost absently before sitting up. “Think you could whip up something for us in the kitchen? Don’t worry, the fridge actually has real food now, stuff you can actually cook.”</p><p>She reaches over and grabs her pajama shirt and shorts from where they were tossed nearby, slipping them on.</p><p>Then she stands, running her fingers through her hair to smooth it back. “I just need to check a few emails,” she adds, almost like an afterthought. “Five minutes.”</p><p>Rio can only nod, pushing herself up on her elbows.</p><p>“Sure, I’ll see what I can make.”</p><p>“Alright then. I’ll be right back.” Agatha gives her a small smile, then walks off down the hall, tying her hair up as she goes.</p><hr/><p>Rio’s just finished plating the last of the mushroom and cheese omelet she managed to throw together with whatever was in Agatha’s fridge when she hears soft footsteps coming down the hall.</p><p>Agatha shows up a second later. Hair in the same messy ponytail she clearly didn’t bother brushing, still in those matching pajamas from earlier, and phone now in hand. </p><p>And as if teasing Rio’s already ogling eyes, the morning light from the big-ass kitchen windows spills over her, all warm and golden, making her look stupidly gorgeous.</p><p>And Rio tries not to think too hard about how her former boss definitely has that glow people get after a night of completely reckless sex.</p><p>“That smells good.” Agatha walks around to the other side of the counter and sits down on one of the stools, watching as Rio splits the omelet in half and slides the pieces onto two plates.</p><p>“The eggs might’ve overcooked a bit,” Rio says, sitting across from her. </p><p>Agatha cuts into hers and takes a bite. “Still better than what I would have made.” </p><p>Then she stands, walks over to one of the cabinets, grabs two mugs, and pours fresh coffee into each from the pot Rio had already brewed.</p><p>Rio can only watch as Agatha prepares her coffee exactly the way she likes it, without even asking. </p><p>Rio mutters a soft, “Thanks,” as Agatha sets the mug in front of her. She then leans her elbows on the counter, warming her hands on the cup before looking up. “I’ve got a piece coming out in the Journal in a few weeks,” she tells Agatha, and sees her perk up a little. “The Post too. Just waiting for them to throw me an assignment.”</p><p>“That’s good,” Agatha nods in response. “So you’re actually committing to freelancing, then?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio clears her throat, fiddling with the handle of her mug, “it just feels like the most doable thing for me right now.” She shrugs. “And it’s kind of nice, waking up and not having to answer to anyone.” She grins when she sees Agatha raise an eyebrow at that. “But I did also send out a bunch of resumes to other outlets too. Just to see.”</p><p>Agatha hums, her finger absently tracing the rim of her mug.</p><p>“That’s smart. Keeping your options open,” she says, glancing up at Rio. “Also sensible, since you’d be wasting your reach if you settled this early, especially when half the field is already circling and trying to get you on their byline.”</p><p>Rio gives a lopsided smile, but drops her eyes to her coffee, trying to hide the way her cheeks warm.</p><p>Agatha squints slightly. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio mutters, still ducking her head. “I’m just...not really used to praise, I guess.”</p><p>Agatha quirks a brow. “Didn’t I just spend the better part of the night giving you plenty?”</p><p>Rio blushes so fast it’s almost comical. Jesus, this woman is going to be the death of her.</p><p>Agatha laughs, clearly pleased by the reaction. Then her laugh softens into a small, fond smile. “But all that aside...it’s just my way of saying I’m proud of you.”</p><p>Rio’s face somehow gets even redder, warmth spreading across her cheeks as she ducks her head, flustered beyond saving.</p><p>Agatha laughs again, clearly amused, and for a brief second the kitchen feels light and full in a way Rio doesn’t quite have words for. </p><p>Oh, Rio could stay here, right here, for who knows how long and never want to leave. </p><p>That thought dawns on her, and she must be making some weird, sappy face because Agatha’s laughter slows and her eyes settle on her. Suddenly, Rio wonders if she is thinking the same thing. </p><p>Would Agatha want to stop time too, stay like this, be with Rio?</p><p>But before Rio can follow the thought too far, Agatha’s phone lights up and rings across the counter, snapping her out of it. The other woman picks it up with a frown. </p><p>“Sorry. I need to take this. I’ll be right back.” </p><p>Agatha stands and walks off, phone to her ear. “Ah, yes, Pepper, darling. Bright and early as always. What do I owe the pleasure this time?” Her voice slips into that overly polite, sweet-as-syrup tone she uses for people she’d rather not deal with but has to.</p><p>Rio can’t help but smile as she watches her disappear down the hall.</p><p>When Agatha returns several minutes later, Rio’s finished eating and is nursing the last of her coffee. </p><p>Agatha sets her phone down with a sigh and takes the seat across from her again.</p><p>“My lunch with Tony’s condiment of a wife just got moved to brunch,” she says, rubbing her temple. “I have to head out in about twenty minutes. Do you mind staying here while I get ready?”</p><p>“Yeah, sure. I was thinking of heading out anyway.”</p><p>“You don’t have to,” Agatha says quickly, almost too quickly, which catches Rio off guard too. “I mean, if you’re not in a rush, I don’t see why you shouldn’t stay. It’s just a brief brunch. I’ll be out for a couple of hours and back before noon. After that, I’m entirely free.”</p><p>Rio stares and listens, trying to wrap her head around what Agatha’s actually offering.</p><p>“If you feel like freshening up or anything, the shower’s just upstairs, and there should be something in my closet you can wear. Whatever you’re comfortable in. And if you’ve got work to do today, my office is just there. You’re welcome to use the computer and any amenities you find useful.” She seems to catch herself then, noticing the way Rio’s just looking at her. “That is, if that arrangement works for you.”</p><p>Rio tilts her head, still trying to process. “Are you saying…I can stay the whole day?”</p><p>Agatha looks over, then immediately turns her attention to her now-empty mug.</p><p>“It’s actually more like, if you wanted to stay the weekend,” she continues, evidently unaccustomed to making such requests. “But only if you want to, of course. If you’ve got other plans or something lined up, I won’t hold you back. I just thought it’d be nice to come home later and see you still here.”</p><p>Rio is a little dumbfounded and completely speechless that Agatha actually wants her to stick around longer, but somehow, she finds her words.</p><p>“Yeah, sure. I mean, if you’re okay with it.”</p><p>“More than okay.” Agatha’s eyes soften with something close to a smile, and Rio feels her knees go a little weak. Ridiculous, really, considering she’s still sitting down. How she ended up here, wrapped in this unexpected kind of tenderness from Agatha Harkness of all people, she has no idea. “So you’ll stay?”</p><p>Rio can’t help the goofy, tooth-gap grin that spreads across her face. </p><p>“Yeah. I’ll stay.”</p><p>And that’s how Rio finds herself spending the entire weekend at Agatha’s place.</p><p>They eat dinner barefoot in the kitchen, sharing bites straight from the same plate, stealing sips from the same glass of wine, then fuck, right up against the counter, with Rio’s back pressed against the cold Calacatta marble and Agatha’s hands tugging her shirt off like she’s starving.</p><p>At some point, they also end up in the shower, laughing when Agatha gets shampoo in Rio’s eye, but that doesn’t stop the latter from sliding her hand between the older woman’s thighs. They slip, grab, press into each other, too turned on to care about anything else.</p><p>They watch a mix of fashion shows and climate documentaries on Agatha’s insanely big TV, the two of them sprawled on the bed, legs tangled in the sheets.</p><p>But somewhere between runway models in Paris and melting ice caps in the Arctic, Agatha decides to dip her head down, her mouth warm and unrelenting against Rio’s throbbing cunt. </p><p>Fortunately for Rio’s thriving career, she actually manages to get a bit of work done on Agatha’s ridiculously fancy desktop, before getting completely distracted and, yes, ending up having sex in Agatha’s home office too.</p><p>And somewhere on Monday, after all the orgasms, shared toothpaste, borrowed shirts, bottles of wine, and the stack of dishes left behind from the meals they’ve cooked and eaten together, and then stood side by side washing, Rio starts to realize they never once talked about what any of it is supposed to mean.</p><hr/><p>After a long week of chasing leads, digging through numbers, and piecing together quotes, Rio finally wraps up her draft and sends it in.</p><p>The article, her first non-fashion feature since the Nocturne exclusive, is set to go live on The Journal next week, so she’s meeting Hela at Fresco, per Hela’s insistence, to go over a few final notes and discuss placement.</p><p>As she sits in the backseat of her rideshare, Rio pulls out her phone and opens her messages. </p><p>Somewhere between writing and rewriting, she somehow keeps finding herself texting Agatha, who occasionally responds when she isn’t occupied in meetings or yelling at some unfortunate intern (if Shuri’s updates are to be believed).</p><p>Shuri, ever the relentless oversharer, continues to text Rio on a daily basis, even though Rio no longer works at Nocturne, something Rio silently enjoys more than she admits.</p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> How’s your day going? </em></p><p>She doesn’t expect a reply right away, but to her surprise, the message gets read almost instantly.</p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> Still dealing with the usual mediocrity and incompetence. Some intern ‘misplaced’ one of the pull quotes and now, instead of final proofs, I’m getting myself a headache. </em></p><p>Before Rio can even tap out a reply, another message lands.</p><p><b> <em>Agatha:</em> </b> <em> How’s your meeting with Helena? Have you made it clear to her that there would be no kissing you involved this time? </em></p><p>Rio shakes her head, grinning despite herself.</p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> First of all, her name is Hela. And I’m still in the cab on the way there. Second, no one’s kissing me anytime soon, unless it’s someone with steely blue eyes, most likely frowning at her phone right now, with her eyebrows doing that judgy little arch. </em></p><p>A few seconds pass.</p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> You might know a lot of people with steely blue eyes and judgmental eyebrows. </em></p><p>Rio laughs under her breath, biting her lip when the driver glances at her in the mirror. </p><p>She types back quickly.</p><p><b> <em>Rio:</em> </b> <em> I actually only know one. </em></p><p>And then, maybe just a little bolder than she intends, she sends another.</p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> Will I be seeing you tonight? It’s been a while since…well, the weekend. </em></p><p>She hesitates after hitting send, staring at her screen while chewing the inside of her cheek. Then, to her relief, the typing bubbles appear, followed by Agatha’s reply.</p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> Well, my weekend has been miraculously cleared, so I wouldn’t mind if you stayed again.  </em></p><p>Rio’s smile blooms before she can stop it. Jesus, what is this woman doing to her?</p><p>Then another message comes in, one that makes her smile stretch even wider.</p><p><b> <em>Agatha: </em> </b> <em> Also, I seem to remember you mentioning those cookies you used to bake specifically for wooing. My kitchen’s yours, should you feel inspired to test their powers on someone more difficult to impress. </em></p><p><b> <em>Rio: </em> </b> <em> Is that a challenge?  </em></p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha: </em>
</b>
<em>Only if you’re brave enough to take it.</em>
</p><p>Rio chuckles, shaking her head before tucking her phone back into her pocket, still grinning as the car rolls to a stop in front of Fresco.</p><p>Inside, she spots an open table tucked in the corner and starts to reach for her phone to text Hela, only to stop when a familiar pair at a nearby table catches her eye.</p><p>“What the hell?” Rio mutters to herself, brows furrowing as her confused hazel eyes land on the woman with dark brown hair marked by unmistakable blonde streaks, currently deep in conversation with none other than Tony Stark.</p><p>A pit opens in her stomach, and she swears again under her breath.</p><p>Because why the actual fuck is Tony Stark having a friendly little sit-down with Valentina Allegra De Fontaine, the editor-in-chief of Nocturne’s oldest and most notoriously competitive rival?</p><p>A peculiar tightness coils in Rio’s chest. Not panic, exactly. </p><p>But something that feels like a warning flaring just beneath her ribs. </p><p>And her first thought, immediate and instinctive, is of Agatha.</p>

<p>Rio feels like she’s confined in a cage, stuck in her seat while the whole world keeps moving around her. </p><p>It’s been more than fifteen minutes since Valentina De Fontaine and Tony Stark walked out of Fresco, leaving her restless in their wake. Hela had shown up not long after, sliding into the seat across from her. </p><p>Rio barely notices the waiter sliding a plate between them as her eyes stay fixed on Hela and her mind drifts somewhere else entirely, the other woman’s moving lips and voice blurring into a low hum against her own tangled thoughts.</p><p>Something about what the editor thought of Rio’s article and what happens next, but not a single word makes it past the fog in her head.</p><p>“So, Stewart says yours is one of the strongest they’ve had all quarter. But don’t let it go to your head, because now you’re stuck competing with yourself.”</p><p>Hela takes a sip of her Aperol spritz, glances at Rio, then keeps going.</p><p>“They’ll wire half the payment this week, the rest after publication. But I’ll email you more details tonight so—” She cuts herself off, squinting at Rio. “All right, what is this? I feel like I’m talking to a wall here. Are you even listening to a word I’m saying?”</p><p>Rio finally blinks, like she’s just surfaced from underwater. </p><p>“Uh, yeah, of course. I got it.”</p><p>Hela leans back, unimpressed.</p><p>“Really? Then tell me what I just said.” </p><p>Rio stalls, fiddling with her fork just to keep her hands busy, but no words come. </p><p>“Uh-huh. Just as I thought.” Hela sighs, setting her glass down with a clink. “So, what’s going on? And please don’t say nothing,” she adds, holding up a hand before Rio can even speak. “Whatever it is, it’s written all over your face.”</p><p>“It’s probably nothing,” Rio argues, “and maybe I’m just overthinking.”</p><p>“Overthinking what?” Hela asks. “If this is about your article, I literally just told you it’s great work.”</p><p>“No, it’s not the article.” </p><p>“Then what is it?” </p><p>Rio exhales slowly, eyes fixed on her plate as she absently taps her fork against the rim. </p><p>“It’s just…I don’t know what to make of it. I saw Stark with Oxe’s editor right before you showed up, and they were having—” she hesitates, searching for the words, “I don’t know, a really friendly chat. Which makes no sense, right? Why would Stark be even talking to the editor-in-chief of a rival magazine?” </p><p>She eventually looks up, catching the barely-there reaction that crosses Hela’s face. The balance between them suddenly tilts.</p><p>“You know something,” she concludes. “What are you not telling me, Hela?”</p><p>The other woman sidesteps Rio’s accusing eyes and takes another sip of her drink. </p><p>“I only picked up on it recently, though it looks like it’s been going around for a while,” Hela admits. “But it’s just a bunch of rubbish, baseless rumours, and I think you shouldn’t really be worrying about it, not with you being—”</p><p>“What baseless rumors?” Rio interrupts, leaning forward slightly.</p><p>She can tell Hela already knows she’s not the type to let something simply drop once it’s on the table, but Hela still says, “Again, I really don’t think you need to concern yourself with this.”</p><p>“Hela,” Rio presses, her focus locked on the woman’s blue eyes, too much like another pair she’d rather be staring into right now, the very ones at the root of the dread slowly knotting her chest. “Tell me. What baseless rumors?”</p><p>Hela sighs. “Fine. If you really must know,” she says, lifting her glass for another sip before setting it down a little too firmly. “Word’s been going around that Tony Stark might be trying to bring Valentina into his company, most likely to take over Nocturne by the end of the month.”</p><p>Rio stares at her, as if she misheard. </p><p>“Take over Nocturne?” The fork slips from her hand, clattering against the plate. Her stomach twists as the realization clicks into place. “You mean…no. No, you can’t be serious. That’s—Stark wouldn’t do that to Agatha. She’s been the backbone of that magazine for years. She practically built it. Why the hell would he even consider replacing her?”</p><p>“I don’t mean to sound harsh, but perhaps it’s because De Fontaine is a bit younger than Harkness—” </p><p>“That’s bullshit.” </p><p>“—and brings a fresher perspective,” Hela points out, rather regretfully. “Nocturne is one of the most expensive magazines in the business, and a lot of people have noted that Val can do the same work for much less. Tony Stark is a numbers guy, Rio. He’s a businessman through and through, and he always thinks about the ledger rather than loyalty. On top of that, I suspect Agatha’s recent stunt has probably pushed him even closer to making this decision.”</p><p>“Recent stunt?” Rio’s brows knit together.</p><p>“Your world-exclusive, darling,” Hela says, her eyes studying Rio’s reaction with intent. “It’s still the talk of the town. Partly for its sheer quality, but also for how Agatha managed to pull it off at the very last minute, directly against Stark’s explicit orders. And well, let’s just say it ruffled more than a few feathers.”</p><p>Rio blinks, disbelief written all over her face. </p><p>“What? That doesn’t even make any sense. That issue brought in almost ten times the revenue. How can he be upset? He’s the one always harping about numbers! Is he seriously that much of an idiot?”</p><p>Hela leans back, folding her arms.</p><p>“Yes, I agree. Most men are like that, both in this business and out of it. But he’s also an idiot with an exceptionally fragile ego.”</p><p>Rio feels a pit open in her stomach. “Agatha’s going to be devastated. Her whole life is about that magazine. It’s all she’s worked for. Stark can’t just screw her over like this.” She presses her face into her hands for a moment, then looks up again. “Does she even know?”</p><p>Hela regards Rio for a bit, then shrugs, a hint of worry in her eyes. </p><p>“I don’t know, but I like to think she’s aware of what’s going on. After all, this is Agatha Harkness we’re talking about. Hardly anything ever slips past her.”</p><p>Hela has a point. But Rio’s stomach twists further anyway.</p><p>“What do I do? I can’t just—I have to do something, right? I mean…it was my exclusive that set all this off. I should at least be doing something about this. Right?”</p><p>The blonde shakes her head. </p><p>“And what, exactly, could you do? If these rumours hold any truth, Rio, you’re still a greenhorn, a mere speck in the eyes of everyone else. You’re only just starting to carve out your own name here. You don’t need to play Romeo in this, do you understand? Agatha has been in this business far longer than you. I’m sure she can handle this on her own. You certainly don’t need to get involved.”</p><p>But what Hela said back at the restaurant doesn’t make things any easier for Rio as she steps out of the cab in front of Agatha’s house in Scarsdale, a duffel bag slung over her shoulder.</p><p>She and Agatha had decided it was safer to spend the weekend here rather than at Agatha’s Upper East Side townhouse, which would easily be crawling with photographers. </p><p>Yes, even on a fucking weekend. The vultures don’t rest, as they say. </p><p>And it doesn’t look right for Rio to be spotted there, since she’s neither Agatha’s assistant anymore nor a writer at the magazine.</p><p>Last weekend, she’d slipped out in the dead of night with a hoodie pulled low, and though it went unnoticed, she’d rather not tempt fate.</p><p>The last thing she wants is to cause Agatha any more trouble.</p><p>She hesitates, rocking awkwardly on her toes before finally pressing the doorbell.</p><p>A moment later, there’s a shuffle inside, and then Agatha opens the door, one brow already arched. </p><p>“The doorbell? Really?”</p><p>“What, you wanted me to climb in through the window?” Rio manages a sheepish grin, praying she doesn’t look as rattled as she feels. “Because I totally would. Might even be more romantic.”</p><p>“And borderline illegal,” Agatha retorts dryly, rolling her eyes but stepping aside. “I’m still buried in a few calls, but I’ll be free after. You can go upstairs, take a shower, whatever you need. Just make yourself at home,” she adds in a distracted ramble as she ushers Rio inside.</p><p>Rio trails after her, chewing over the thought of what she had seen earlier.</p><p>Part of her desperately wants to spill it right there in the hallway, but she swallows it back. She decides it’s better to bring it up later, when they’re both sitting down.</p><p>She does as Agatha suggested. She heads upstairs for a hot shower, then pulls on a pair of worn sweatpants and an old band tee before heading back down with her laptop in hand.</p><p>The living room is empty. So is the kitchen when she peeks in. </p><p>Agatha must still be in her office.</p><p>So Rio sinks onto the couch, only to jolt when a pair of big brown canine eyes peer at her from behind.</p><p>“Jesus, buddy, you scared me.” Rio presses a hand to her chest, but the mastiff just trots right up and starts sniffing at her. Rio lets her, crouching down to scratch behind her ears when the dog circles around in front of her. The mastiff’s tail thumps happily against the floor. </p><p>“You must be Fanny,” Rio greets her with a grin. The dog snuffles at her once more before licking her hand, and Rio’s smile brightens. “Well, aren’t you the cutest thing.” </p><p>She gives her another good scratch, and Fanny tips her head back, clearly asking for more. Rio settles onto the rug and starts rubbing her belly.</p><p>“So what are you doing here, huh? Aren’t you supposed to be with Marmee? Did she drop you off because you’re on babysitting duty? Or are you here to make sure your other human doesn’t forget to eat?”</p><p>The mastiff huffs through her nose and rolls over, leaving Rio no choice but to keep scratching. </p><p>Rio laughs under her breath. “Bet you’re better company than half the people she works with.”</p><p>“She’s more effective than half my staff, I’ll give her that.”</p><p>Startled, Rio lifts her head and finds Agatha standing in the doorway: arms crossed, glasses askew and hair just slightly out of place. She looks tired in a way only Rio would notice.</p><p>Fanny immediately abandons Rio’s hand to trot over to her other human. Agatha bends down, running a hand over the dog’s back before straightening again.</p><p>“Marmee’s out tonight,” she explains, adjusting her glasses. “One of her old friends is in the hospital, so she insisted on staying over to look after her.” She gives the dog another absentminded pat before glancing at Rio. “So it’s us and Fancakes tonight. Hope that’s not a problem.”</p><p>Rio pushes herself up from the rug, dusting off her sweatpants. </p><p>“Are you kidding?” She looks at the dog, tail wagging like a metronome. “Other than Marmee, she’s the nicest welcome committee I’ve ever had at your place.” Fanny lets out a single bark, as if in agreement, and Rio snorts.</p><p>The dog eventually loses interest, padding off to roam the house and leaving the two of them alone. </p><p>Rio’s fingers twitch at her side, the urge to finally say what she saw earlier tugging at her again. But before she can get a word out, Agatha glances at the clock and breaks the silence first.</p><p>“I’m starving, and I’m sure you are too. I was craving steak, so I had some delivered. It’s probably gone cold by now, but we can warm it up in the oven. Would you mind giving me a hand?”</p><p>Rio blinks, a little thrown by the domestic ease of it all, but nods. </p><p>“Yeah, sure.”</p><p>Agatha is already moving toward the kitchen, slipping her glasses off and setting them on the counter as she opens one of the paper bags. </p><p>The scent of seasoned meat wafts out, faint but still rich enough to make Rio’s stomach rumble. Her last meal had been hours ago, and she’d barely even touched it.</p><p>“Plates are in the top cabinet to your left,” Agatha says without looking up, distracted as she checks the containers. “Grab a couple, will you?”</p><p>Rio does as she’s told, watching her former boss slide their dinner into the oven. She debates again whether she should tell her right away. </p><p>Maybe they should eat first. Standing almost side by side in Agatha’s kitchen, the soft domesticity of the moment feels too fragile and gentle to shatter with something so serious. </p><p>Rio can wait a little longer. Surely telling Agatha can wait. </p><p>So, she decides to hold off, savoring this brief reprieve before reality comes calling again. </p><p>It’s only when Agatha is on her second pour of wine that she finally notices Rio’s restlessness, or perhaps she’s just grown tired of skirting around it. “All right, I can’t keep up this charade any longer. You’re here, but you don’t really seem present. Is everything okay?”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth, then closes it again, unsure how to start the conversation. Noticing her reluctance, Agatha sets her fork down and adds, “Is the steak not to your liking?”</p><p>“What? No, it’s perfect. I mean, the seasoning could be…a little different, maybe, but it’s perfect.” Rio rumbles. She’s always loved steak, a sucker for it, and she even cooks it well. She even wants to cook some for Agatha one day, and she could easily eat more of this, but tonight her appetite isn’t really in the right place.</p><p>“The wine, then?”</p><p>“No. The wine’s great too.”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes at her, clearly trying to figure out what Rio isn’t saying, then sighs in defeat. </p><p>“Fine. So if it’s not the steak or the wine, then what is it? Do you have somewhere else you need to be? I could call Javier now to pick you up, have you go wherever you need.”</p><p>Rio sits up a little too quickly. </p><p>“No, of course not! That’s not necessary. I really do want to be here.”</p><p>“Well, you don’t seem like it,” Agatha mutters to herself, though Rio still catches it. </p><p>She pouts, frowning at Rio, and Rio can’t help but feel her chest soften at the sight, seeing the older woman look so adorably frustrated, like Rio is ruining their perfect little evening. </p><p>Somehow, she really is.</p><p>Agatha sighs, letting herself calm. Well, mostly. That’s a recent development, Rio notes.</p><p>“If it’s not the steak, the wine, or the fact that you’re here, then what is it that’s been bothering you? Clearly, there’s something you’re not telling me, Rio.” </p><p>Rio stares at her for a moment. Since when had Agatha been so good at noticing when something was troubling her? And, stupidly, Rio kind of liked this new little rhythm in their back-and-forth. </p><p>But there’s a more pressing issue at hand, so she sighs and sets her utensils down as well.</p><p>“It’s about something I came across earlier, during my meeting with Hela. And it’s not exactly the kind of thing you’d be happy to hear,” Rio begins. Agatha looks a bit more impatient, but she doesn’t interrupt. “I saw Tony in a meeting with Val, Oxe’s editor, or at least it looked like some kind of a meeting. I’m not entirely sure, but it definitely gave me that impression.”</p><p>Rio’s suspicions, along with Hela’s earlier words about the rumors, seem to be true, judging by the sudden trace of something wary on Agatha’s face, only before she quickly masks it with a more neutral expression and returns to cutting her steak. </p><p>“And that’s been bothering you because?” </p><p>Rio should have expected it. Of course, Agatha would deflect. </p><p>She shifts in her seat, fingertips grazing the edge of the counter. </p><p>“I think you already know why.”</p><p>And once again, Rio knows she’s right, because she can almost see the familiar parabolic wall Agatha is putting up, piece by piece, between them. </p><p>The latter lets the wine roll over her tongue before lowering the glass carefully. She cuts another piece of steak, chews slowly, and only then does she glance up at Rio. </p><p>“Then trust me when I say it’s not something that concerns you,” she says at last. “Whatever you’ve convinced yourself is happening, it’s not yours to get tangled up in. Are we clear on that?”</p><p>Those words land more violently than Rio expects, hitting bone. </p><p>She fires back before she can stop herself. “What do you mean it doesn’t concern me? You’re in this position because of me.” Her voice comes out guilty and frustrated, mirroring how she’s felt all day. “No, Agatha, please don’t deny it,” she adds the moment the other woman’s lips part. “Tony is replacing you because of that stupid exclusive—”</p><p>“No one is replacing me. And that wasn’t some stupid exclusive,” Agatha cuts her off. “Do you really want to devalue what Lilia trusted us with?”</p><p>“No. That’s not what I meant.” Rio shakes her head hard. “I’m not talking about Lilia here. I’m talking about me. If we hadn’t run the piece I wrote, Tony wouldn’t even be thinking about doing this to you.”</p><p>Agatha exhales through her nose, setting her utensils down again like a punctuation mark. </p><p>“If we hadn’t published it, the numbers would have stayed disappointing. Tony would’ve still found a reason to screw me over.” She finally lifts her eyes to Rio. “Believe me, he was already making his choice long before your words ever hit print.” </p><p>That’s all the confirmation Rio needs: the rumors are true, and Agatha has known it for a while. </p><p>And somehow, even though Agatha makes it sound otherwise, Rio can’t shake the feeling that her fingerprints are still all over it too. </p><p>And she couldn’t deny the disappointment gnawing at her, because it feels like she and Agatha had been building some kind of trust.</p><p>Agatha had already shared so many truths with her, and yet this, something that clearly involved her, Agatha had chosen to keep her in the dark.</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me?” Rio asks more calmly, though even she herself can hear the hurt in her voice.</p><p>It takes Agatha a few seconds before she replies. </p><p>“Because you didn’t need to know,” she reiterates, almost protectively. “I ran that article because I knew it was what the magazine needed. It was entirely my call. I didn’t do it just for you.” Rio doesn’t have a word to throw back, so Agatha continues, “Try not to let this bother you, do you understand? I’m more than capable of dealing with this on my own.”</p><hr/><p>The one thing Rio can’t stand about herself is the feeling of helplessness, especially when she knows she could at least do something about it.</p><p>She remembers being a kid, sitting frozen in class while a classmate was unfairly scolded for talking, even though Rio knew it was someone else who had whispered first. </p><p>Or when the class hamster got sick and everyone just accepted it, but Rio stayed up late flipping through her dad’s old encyclopedia, trying to figure out how to help the poor thing, furious that no one else cared enough to even try. </p><p>Or the time her mom came home late, eyes tired and shoulders sagging, and Rio sat at the kitchen table with her homework, too young to lighten the load, but old enough to feel its weight.</p><p>Even then, she had always hated the idea that circumstances beyond her control could decide outcomes for her. </p><p>People had often called her stubborn, a complaint wrapped in exasperation, as if her refusal to bend was a flaw. </p><p>But like her dad, she believed stubbornness wasn’t weakness. It’s simply courage in disguise. As he once said, “Stubborn people are often the ones who carve their own roads when the world insists on walls.” She had always liked to think of herself as one of them.</p><p>She turns her head toward Agatha, naked under the sheets and curled up peacefully on her side of the bed. Rio had dreamed of this: waking up to see Agatha like this, to simply watch her sleep. </p><p>Even the strongest souls have a way of appearing fragile and serene when they surrender to rest, and Agatha is no exception. She looks so vulnerable and delicate, so entirely unaware of Rio’s eyes on her, that it makes Rio’s chest ache.</p><p>There’s no way Rio is going to let this woman face something alone when she’s right here to help. </p><p>She stands carefully, making sure the sudden shift of the mattress doesn’t wake Agatha.</p><p>Grabbing the boxers tossed on the floor and a loose white shirt from her overnight bag, she slips into them quietly.</p><p>Laptop in hand, she pads downstairs and finds Fanny already waiting at the bottom, her tail wagging. The dog must have sensed a human was awake, but thankfully, she doesn’t bark.</p><p>“Hey, buddy. Sorry to wake you,” Rio murmurs, scratching behind Fanny’s ears before moving into the living room and sinking onto the couch. Fanny seems to understand, curling up at her feet and soon drifting back to sleep.</p><p>Rio opens her laptop and types in a name, along with a few keywords she hopes will lead her to a way to help Agatha. She shakes her head while doing so. </p><p>If her dad could see her right now, he’d just roll his eyes. Not at what she was doing, but at the fact that she was doing it at all, stubborn as ever, just like him, right against Agatha’s insistence. </p><p>Some things, it seemed, ran deep in the family.</p><p>And Rio is doing this for the woman she…well, she hasn’t really put a name to it yet, but that doesn’t matter right now. </p><p>What matters is whether there’s dirt to find on this so-called billionaire, philanthropist, playboy Tony Stark. Her gut screams that there’s something there, and Rio is determined to dig it up.</p><p>Hours had passed, and Rio hadn’t even realized how long she’d been scrolling, reading, and bookmarking articles before she dozed off on the couch.</p><p>It’s the sunlight streaming through Agatha’s big windows and Fanny’s tongue on her arm that drags her out of sleep. </p><p>Panic shoots through her immediately, but thank goodness her laptop had auto-locked, so there’s no way anyone could have seen her open tabs.</p><p>“You certainly have a strong attachment to that couch,” Agatha quips from the threshold, arms crossed over her emerald satin robe. Rio quickly notices she doesn’t look thrilled to have woken up alone without Rio by her side. “What are you doing down here?”</p><p>Scratching the back of her neck, she tries to sound casual and convincing. “Sorry, I didn’t want to wake you. I couldn’t sleep, had a bit of work to catch up on, and thought Fanny might like the company.”</p><p>“So you’d rather have Fanny’s company than mine?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head with a sheepish grin.</p><p>“Am I imagining things, or is Agatha Harkness suddenly jealous of a dog?”</p><p>The older woman rolls her eyes. </p><p>“Oh, definitely the first one. I never get jealous.” She leans down slightly, letting her hand glide over Fanny’s fur, and the dog leans into her touch with a soft whine. “But enjoy Fanny’s company if you must. Truthfully, I’d also pick hers over yours anyway.”</p><p>“Why don’t you just get over here?” Rio pats her lap, and Agatha instantly raises an eyebrow. Rio laughs, knowing full well Agatha never willingly takes orders from anyone. Then, for the first time, she tries giving her puppy-dog eyes, something she’s sure Agatha can’t resist. “Please?”</p><p>Agatha sighs, though there’s no real protest in it, and slowly walks over. </p><p>Rio reaches up and guides her down, so she ends up straddling her lap. </p><p>Their eyes meet, pale ocean-blue against warm hazel, and suddenly their worlds feel a little closer as Rio says, “Good morning.”</p><p>Agatha smirks. “Shouldn’t a proper greeting come before any conversation?” But she still mirrors Rio’s knowing stare and snakes her hands around her neck. “Morning.”</p><p>Maybe it’s Rio trying to make up for the microscopical distance that lingered after their conversation in the kitchen last night, even through what came after in bed. </p><p>Or maybe it’s just seeing Agatha so domestic and unguarded that it swallows her whole. Her hands settle on Agatha’s waist as she leans in for a kiss, and Agatha meets her without hesitation.</p><p>When had they decided to be this sappy? When had Agatha let Rio get this close, let her touch her like gravity pulling a comet, let her kiss her like two stars caught in orbit, circling each other endlessly and burning bright? </p><p>But before Rio can get lost in the thought, Fanny barks at the door, and Marmee’s cheerful voice rings out from the hallway.</p><p>With this, Agatha quickly scrambles upright out of Rio’s lap and fusses with her robe, and Rio fights the urge to laugh at how she looks exactly like a kid caught misbehaving.</p><p>“Well, hello there, sweetpea! Have you been a good girl?” They hear Fanny’s barking stop abruptly, and Rio guesses Marmee is giving her a happy scratch behind the ears. Not a second later, Marmee shuffles into view, smiling at them both. “Would you look at that, you two are up early.”</p><p>“Marmee,” Agatha greets. “I thought you said you’d be back before noon.” Her cheeks are still a little pink from…well, almost getting caught with Rio in a near-makeout.</p><p>And really, who would want their second mom walking in on that? And yes, Rio knows exactly how Agatha feels about Marmee, even if she’d never say it out loud. It’s the same way Rio feels about Lorna.</p><p>“Oh, I couldn’t possibly leave Fanny with you two and ruin both your weekends any more than I already have,” Marmee declares, making her way toward the kitchen with a playful sway. “Hi, Rio, dear.”</p><p>With the way Marmee greets her, Rio can’t help but assume she has no problem with her being here with Agatha, as if she’s already on board with whatever it is they’re starting to be. </p><p>Still, all Rio manages is to awkwardly raise a hand in greeting.</p><p>Then she notices her carrying a few paper bags, the content of which she still can’t figure out. Rio hurries to catch up, offering to help Marmee with some of the load, while Agatha trails behind them.</p><p>“Fanny’s not as much of a handful as you think she is,” Agatha argues. The dog wags her tail like she knows she’s being talked about, trotting at their heels as they step into the kitchen. “And <em>we</em> really love having her here. Right, Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s stomach does a little unexpected flip at the “we,” mostly because of how easily Agatha says it. </p><p>The casual intimacy in her voice. </p><p>As if they’ve already become a unit overnight. As if that’s just what they are now. </p><p>Rio nods, though her thoughts scatter like startled birds. </p><p>Are they really already a unit? Have they even talked about being a unit? Or is Rio supposed to just assume it too?</p><p>“Oh, I know you do,” Marmee says, unloading the bags onto the counter. She raises an eyebrow at them. “But you couldn’t possibly have Fanny running around here while the two of you bake. Trust me, this girl is dangerous near an oven.” She snorts and sets down the eggs, flour, sugar, and everything else. Agatha must’ve asked her for a favor to gather it all. “I assume this will be enough?” Marmee turns to Rio, who’s only just now piecing it all together.</p><p>“Uh, yeah, I think that’s more than enough. Thank you, Marmee,” Rio replies softly, then glances at Agatha and leans closer to whisper, “We’re really baking?”</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms. “Yes. Unless, of course, you’re thinking of backing out of my challenge.”</p><p>Rio grins, leaning in just a little more, recalling their text exchange from yesterday. </p><p>“Not a chance. I’m dead set on impressing you with pastries today, Miss Harkness.”</p><p>They hold each other’s eyes for a beat, and Rio swears her heart stumbles into a faster rhythm. </p><p>She wonders if Agatha feels the same. </p><p>Then Marmee claps her hands together, snapping them both out of it. </p><p>Wait, did they really just lean in for a kiss? Right here? In front of someone? Rio can’t even tell. All she knows is she’s pulled to Agatha so strongly she doesn’t even have the time to figure out how much.</p><p>“Well now, it looks like you’ve got everything you need,” Marmee says kindly. “I even tucked a few extra things in the cupboard the other day, just in case. You never know when a bit of extra sugar might come in handy.” She chuckles to herself. “Now, dears, Fanny and I will go on our morning walk. You two enjoy the rest of your weekend, and do try not to burn the house down while you’re at it.”</p><p>She pats her knees, and Fanny springs up, tail wagging as she trots after her.</p><p>Rio lifts a hand in farewell, Agatha murmurs a polite thanks, and Marmee’s warm, crackling laughter trails down the hall as she finally shuffles out the door.</p><p>Rio glances at Agatha, then at the neatly lined-up ingredients on the counter. </p><p>“So…we’re actually doing this? Baking?”</p><p>“More like you’ll do the baking, I’ll do the supervising,” Agatha says, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“Oh no, you don’t.” Rio reaches out, letting her fingers brush Agatha’s. “You’re not getting out of this that easily. Today, you’re my charming assistant. We’re doing this together.”</p><p>Agatha folds her arms, giving Rio a cool, mock glare. “Very well. But you should know, much like Fanny, I’m a walking hazard near an oven. In fact, anything electrical in this kitchen would be wise to fear me.”</p><p>Rio bursts out laughing, already picturing the disaster coming. </p><p>And sure enough, Agatha hadn’t been exaggerating because when they start baking more than an hour later, the batter flies the second she takes the hand mixer from Rio, streaking across the wall and splattering the counter, while a few chunks even land on her own cheek. </p><p>Rio laughs even harder as she grabs a towel to wipe off said chunks from Agatha’s face.</p><p>By the time the clock nudges past one, the kitchen looks like it’s been through a type of war. </p><p>Flour dusts the counters, smudges the floor, and a thin trail of sugar sparkles wherever the sunlight hits. Agatha, to Rio’s surprise, hasn’t abandoned the ship.</p><p>Instead, she’s taken her role as critic-in-chief and assistant seriously, perched in one of Rio’s oversized shirts with an apron tied over it. </p><p>She had insisted her own clothes were too precious for the battlefield of baking.</p><p>Though Rio doesn’t let her handle any more moving tools, Agatha keeps busy passing ingredients and rinsing out bowls and measuring cups.</p><p>Every so often, Rio slips in close, hands finding her waist, lips brushing her temple or cheek, stealing kisses whenever she can.</p><p>Soon enough, with boygenius blasting through the speakers at Rio’s insistence, Agatha’s counters aren’t just crowded with one and a half dozen of chocolate chip cookies, but also a pan of salted caramel brownies and a whole glossy chocolate ganache cake — the kind so rich it has Agatha making noises so sinful Rio swears she could float straight off the floor.</p><p>“If you weren’t so dead set on becoming a journalist, have you ever thought about opening a bakery?” Agatha asks, lifting a forkful of ganache cake with her usual mechanical elegance. She takes her time with the bite before turning to Rio. “Where did you even learn to do all this?”</p><p>Rio wipes her flour-dusted hands on her apron. </p><p>“My mami and Lorna used to swap pastries all the time when Alice and I were kids. Sometimes they’d come over, and Lorna and my mom would bake for the neighbors while Alice and I hung around the kitchen, sneaking bites and pretending to help. Most of what I know comes from my mami, but the recipes? Most of these are Lorna’s.”</p><p>Agatha acknowledges her answer with a soft smile, but lets out another little groan around her bite. </p><p>“I think I could easily finish all of this on my own. This is just so good.”</p><p>Rio tries not to smile so hard her face might crack. Something about Agatha not even trying to hide how much she loves Rio’s baking makes her heart flutter. </p><p>“You should leave some for Marmee, though,” she quips.</p><p>“Oh, you’re right.” Agatha sets her fork down with a small huff of disappointment, and Rio can’t help snorting. Agatha swivels toward her, narrowing her eyes. “What?” she asks.</p><p>Rio tilts her head, tongue poking at her cheek. All this sweetness will probably give her a sugar rush. </p><p>“You’ve got a little something…” She doesn’t bother finishing the sentence and just wipes her thumb across the corner of Agatha’s mouth, smearing a streak of chocolate. She licks it off her finger, and Agatha’s cheeks flush bright red before she hides it behind a smirk. “There. All gone.” </p><p>“Well, you’ve got something too,” she echoes, and Rio’s brows furrow.</p><p>“I do?”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Agatha replies, hopping off the stool and leaning in before Rio has a chance to think. Their lips meet in a deep, teasing kiss, tongues brushing, and Rio swears she can taste the chocolate on Agatha’s. Oh, she really did a good job with that cake. Pulling back, Agatha taps her cheek, the smug grin on her face ebbing. “There. All gone.”</p><p>Rio’s face heats up like a tomato popped in a microwave. She can never win against Agatha in this little game, no matter how hard she tries. “I-It does taste good,” she stammers, “—the cake, I mean.” </p><p>Agatha chuckles, sits back up on the stool with her wine, and nibbles a cookie this time, watching Rio with a soft, satisfied smile. Then Rio attempts to recover her cool by saying, “So, does impressing you with my baking skills earn me any points?”</p><p>“Who says you’ve got me impressed?” Agatha teases.</p><p>Rio just shakes her head. “You’ve been literally moaning at every bite. That says a lot, actually.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes but doesn’t argue. “We should really take some of these to Marmee,” she parries, opening a drawer to grab some containers. </p><p>But as soon as her fingers close around one, her phone rings  and vibrates on the counter. </p><p>Before Rio can even see the caller ID, Agatha lets out a disappointed sigh and picks up the phone, giving the woman across from her an apologetic look.</p><p>“Afraid I have to take this. Mind if I leave you here for a minute?”</p><p>“It’s fine. Go ahead. I got this. I’ll get these goodies packed up.”</p><p>Agatha regards her briefly before nodding. “It’ll be just a quick call. I’ll be right back,” she says, brushing off her hands and sneaking one last bite of cookie. She hurries toward the entryway, and Rio begins arranging the pastries into the containers.</p><p>She smiles, imagining how much Marmee would love a few of these treats. And since Agatha mentioned that Marmee bakes, maybe she could even teach Rio some of the pastries she used to make for Agatha. </p><p>Rio shakes her head as she keeps at her task. </p><p>College Rio would have laughed at her. She once swore she’d stop baking after a fling called it too sappy and not really a useful skill, and for a while, she believed it. </p><p>But now, if she’s being honest, Rio could spend the whole weekend in this kitchen, as long as it means having Agatha close, flirting and laughing freely, without caring about anyone else. Just the two of them. </p><p>Ten minutes later, Agatha returns to the kitchen without her phone. A small detail Rio notices right away, forcing herself to stop grinning like an idiot because it’s obvious that after taking that call, Agatha doesn’t plan on letting anyone disturb them for the rest of the day.</p><p>“Shall we?” she says, and Rio follows, carrying their baked goodies across the street to Marmee’s house.</p><p>As soon as Rio steps inside, the house wraps around her like a warm hug. </p><p>Marmee's home feels lived-in, welcoming, and completely unlike the cold perfection of Agatha’s estate the first time she ever set foot there.</p><p>But somehow, on this second visit, Rio notices that Agatha’s place has grown warmer, softer, and more alive — and she finds herself wishing it could always stay that way.</p><p>After all, Agatha deserves that kind of warmth more than anyone else.</p><hr/><p>The afternoon stretches lazily in a slow, honeyed haze as the three of them lounge in Marmee’s backyard, teacups warm in their hands. Marmee had insisted, claiming, “These pastries are far too good not to be enjoyed with a proper cup of tea, dears.”</p><p>Every so often, Rio breaks away to toss a ball for Fanny, laughing as the dog barrels after it and skids across the grass, tongue lolling and tail wagging like a flag in the breeze. Marmee had chuckled more than once at the sight, noting how quickly Fanny had decided Rio was her new favorite person.</p><p>Though Fanny had always been a friendly dog, she usually needed a little patience, a few treats, and some gentle coaxing before she truly warmed up to anyone. But Rio had managed it effortlessly, at which Agatha commented offhand, “Rio has that effect on people. She’s just disarming without even trying.”</p><p>Thankfully, Fanny bounces over and licks Rio’s face just as Agatha says it, sparing her from having to respond at all, and, more importantly, keeping Agatha from noticing the warmth creeping up her cheeks.</p><p>After a few hours of being spoiled in the backyard, Marmee had insisted they both stay for dinner. It had been a while since she’d shared a table with anyone besides Agatha, and Rio was far too charmed to even think of declining.</p><p>She had slipped into the kitchen, sleeves rolled up and insisting on helping, while Agatha had been planted firmly on the living room couch, a book in hand to keep her occupied after Marmee and Rio had unanimously agreed she couldn’t be trusted anywhere near the stove.</p><p>“As I recall, I was a perfectly decent baking assistant earlier, and this is the thanks I get? Come on, buddy, no one here seems to know how to show genuine gratitude,” Agatha had said with mock outrage, patting her thigh for Fanny to follow as the two of them swept dramatically out of the kitchen. Rio could only laugh while she chopped vegetables for Marmee’s beloved beef stroganoff.</p><p>After more than an hour of dinner chatter, with Marmee doing almost all the talking and recounting how little Agatha made her husband Henry wear a tutu to help her practice a dance recital, or how she once tried to bake cookies with her only to end up covered in flour from head to toe, the three of them naturally move into the living room. </p><p>Marmee uncorks a bottle of white wine while Rio crouches by the shelves, carefully flipping through a stack of vinyls.</p><p>Every so often, Rio sneaks a glance at Agatha, curled up on the couch with yet another book. Fanny’s head rests on her lap, and she absentmindedly strokes the dog’s fur, completely absorbed in her reading.</p><p>It’s only when she finally takes in the full collection of vinyls that she gapes, her eyes briefly moving away from Agatha.</p><p>“This is quite the stash you’ve got here, Marmee,” holding one of the sleeves up to the light. “I think you and Alice would really get along. I don’t know much about music myself, but she’s got an impressive collection too, though she leans more toward eighties rock than anything else.”</p><p>Marmee’s eyes warm as they fall on the stack. “They’re not mine, actually. These are all Henry’s. They were his pride and joy. He treated them better than the furniture, if I’m honest.” She chuckles, her gaze lingering awhile on the stack, tracing the edges of the sleeves as if she can feel him there, then looks back at Rio with a small smile. “Go on. Play one.”</p><p>Rio glances at Agatha, who looks up briefly from her book, then back at Marmee. </p><p>“Are you sure? I mean, I don’t think I—”</p><p>Marmee shakes her head gently. “Dear, I hardly play them these days. My husband would’ve loved knowing they’re still being listened to, and not just sitting there gathering dust,” she says this as she finally settles back onto the other couch.</p><p>Rio regards Marmee one more time, then nods and turns back to the shelves. She runs her fingers slowly along the spines, pausing here and there, as if she can feel the weight of memory pressed into each one. </p><p>Finally, she pulls out a record: something she thinks Marmee, maybe even Agatha, will like.</p><p>She slips the vinyl carefully from its sleeve, sets it on the turntable, and lowers the needle. After a soft crackle, Sam Cooke’s <b><em>Nothing Can Change This Love</em></b> fills the room, almost at the same time Marmee presses the wine glass close to her chest, a soft, tender smile touching her lips.</p><p>“Henry and I used to dance to this,” she says, the memory clear in her voice. “He would always pull me out here in the living room, from the kitchen or the garden, spinning me around until our knees gave out, both of us laughing. This was one of his favorites.”</p><p>Rio, always quick on her feet, steps forward, and offers her hand. “I’d hate to let a beautiful song go to waste.” Her grin spreads, that signature tooth gap catching the light as she looks at Marmee, and she dips into a playful half-bow. “May I have the honor of stealing the loveliest lady here for a dance?”</p><p>“Oh, aren’t you a gentleman,” the old woman giggles, setting her glass aside as she lets Rio lead her to the middle of the living room. Rio slides her other hand around Marmee’s waist, and they begin to sway, slow and easy, to the music playing on the turntable.</p><p>From the couch, Agatha watches them wordlessly, her book forgotten now, lips curling into a sweet, affectionate smile. And Rio can’t tear her eyes away, tracing the line of her jaw, the gentle slope of her nose, the loose fall of her hair, and the faint smattering of freckles across her cheeks.</p><p>Her eyes, however, are what keep her rooted. Blue like winter yielding to spring, frozen one minute, alive with warmth the next. Impossible to look at without losing herself.</p><p>Rio wonders, half in hope and half in longing, if Agatha is feeling the same pull, the same silent aching in her chest, as the song wraps around them like honeyed light, thick and languid, while everything beyond their little space slowly recedes into obscurity.</p><p>Marmee chuckles lightly midway through the song, jolting Rio out of her reverie. </p><p>“Oh, I think that’s enough for me. I’m old, and my knees aren’t what they used to be. I think I’ll sit down.” She eases herself back onto the couch, still smiling as she catches her breath. Then she gestures between the two women. “Why don’t you two finish it for me?”</p><p>Agatha’s brows shoot up. “Marmee…you know I don’t dance.”</p><p>“Oh, nonsense. You could at least try,” the latter argues, waving a hand.</p><p>“Yeah, Agatha, you could at least try,” Rio adds with a grin, her hand already hovering.</p><p>“No.” Agatha crosses her arms “I know exactly what you’re doing. And I’m not dancing.”</p><p>Rio can’t help but grin wider. Marmee joins in, pretending dismay. “Well, my dear Henry would be so heartbroken if this song didn’t get danced all the way through.”</p><p>Rio can’t help but chuckle, grateful that even though Marmee knows nothing of the bet between her and Agatha, she’s unwittingly helping her case.</p><p>Agatha lets out a long sigh but straightens her shoulders.</p><p>“Okay, fine. For you…and Henry.” </p><p>She glances at Marmee, who claps joyfully, then looks at Rio. With a reluctant but amused shake of her head, Agatha accepts the hand Rio is offering, letting herself be led to the center of the room.</p><p>Eventually, Rio places her hand around Agatha’s waist, holding her gently but securely, while Agatha rests hers lightly on Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>They sway together to the song, the room slowly shrinking around them until it feels like everything exists only for the two of them.</p><p>At first, Agatha hesitates, her eyes darting away, unsure or perhaps a little bit scared, to meet Rio’s big, embracing amber eyes.</p><p>But when she finally looks up, their eyes lock, and a shiver runs through Rio as Agatha’s other hand slides from her shoulder to rest over her chest, directly above her beating heart.</p><p>And Rio wishes nothing more than that she could stop time, press her palm against the heartbeat of this moment, and never let it go. She wishes she could hold the sway of Agatha in her arms, the warmth of the room, Agatha’s stare, and bottle it all up: bright, endless, and infinite.</p><p>“This is cheating, by the way,” Agatha quips. Rio chuckles, utterly pleased that she also remembered their little deal and the consequences, conveniently, in Rio’s favor.</p><p>“What part of this is cheating?” Rio teases. “I think I convinced you, fair and square.”</p><p>“Technically, Marmee did all the convincing. Not you,” Agatha shoots back, but with an obvious smile tugging at her lips. Proof that she, too, is secretly pleased about this. </p><p>“Well, if we’re sticking to technicalities,” Rio says, leaning a little closer, “our bet was really about me seeing you dance. And by the letter of that bet…this counts. So technically, I win.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, and Rio can’t help but laugh even louder. She feels like someone who somehow got the prettiest girl in school to say yes to prom, her heart racing, completely certain that nothing could ever feel this perfect again. </p><p>“Now you owe me ten bucks and an ice cream date,” she adds. “Though if I’m being honest, the ten bucks can go. I’m good if it’s only the ice cream part, and that little place on the way here will do just fine.”</p><p>Agatha squints at her, mock stern, though the corners of her mouth are still smiling. “Alright,” she drags the word. “An ice cream date…or whatever you want to call it. Next weekend.”</p><p>Rio’s smile spreads effortlessly as she takes Agatha’s hand in hers.</p><p>She pulls her closer, letting their bodies move together with the music.</p><p>The sides of their faces press softly against each other, warm and tender, saying everything words cannot.</p><p>However, the smile drains from Rio’s face as soon as she thinks about this weekend ending and what awaits her.</p><p>Come Monday, she’ll be back to digging through articles and probably interviewing people about Tony Stark and the messes he’s been involved in. </p><p>Something she almost forgets entirely, lost in all this domestic bliss.</p><p>Had Agatha been deliberately distracting her? Or was she merely distracting herself? </p><p>Either way, Rio couldn’t bring herself to complain.</p><p>If this is the kind of distraction she’s being offered, she’ll take it gladly and relish every second.</p><p>On the last night of their weekend together, Rio had lost count of how many times Agatha moaned, gasped, and trembled under her touch, each second hanging on the edge as if it might never come again. </p><p>And maybe, with what Rio was planning in the next few days, something Agatha might not like, it truly wouldn’t. </p><p>So she spends the remaining hours lying awake, her eyes fixed on Agatha, who is half-asleep beside her.</p><p>She doesn’t mind that Agatha sometimes prefers curling up on her own side of the bed instead of snuggling close.</p><p>In fact, there’s something quietly liberating about being able to watch her like this without worrying about waking her.</p><p>Rio thinks she could never tire of this view: a dream made real.</p><p>But this time, Agatha seems to sense Rio staring, stirring slightly, her eyes still closed. </p><p>“What are you thinking?” she murmurs in a groggy, half-lidded voice, shifting closer so Rio can trap her in her arms. Okay, on second thought, Rio likes this even better.</p><p>She smiles at the familiar question. “Thinking you should go back to sleep,” she answers, pressing a soft kiss to Agatha’s forehead.</p><p>The latter doesn’t seem to notice the churn of thoughts in Rio as she drifts deeper into slumber, letting out even, gentle snores that Rio can’t help but listen to.</p><p>She regards Agatha for a minute longer, her mind racing over the plan she’s about to set in motion. </p><p>To many, Agatha often comes across as imposing and unyielding, even a little ruthless. Yet these very traits, which might push others away, only draw Rio in, making her admire Agatha all the more.</p><p>Because beneath it all, there is fire and passion, and an untamed heart that makes her who she is. </p><p>The side Rio has seen since the very first day she started working for her. That power, that intensity…it’s the heart of Agatha Harkness, and the magazine is a huge part of that.</p><p>And nothing, not even something stronger than Rio’s own will, could stop her from doing whatever it takes to protect it.</p><p>Perhaps Agatha would understand. Perhaps she wouldn’t resent her. Perhaps she’d see it for what it truly is: a promise from Rio to stand by her. That she will no longer have to face her trials alone, because Rio will be by her side through it all.</p><p>And now, seeing Agatha so peacefully asleep, Rio can only hope.</p><hr/><p>Rio’s gut had never steered her wrong, even when it led her to places she wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole. After four grueling days of digging through financial records, interviews, and insider tips, her efforts finally pay off. </p><p>She uncovers that Tony Stark has been systematically slashing the salaries of lower-level employees across all his businesses (including Nocturne) funneling the money into his extravagant yacht-and-private-island lifestyle, all while financing a string of high-profile extramarital affairs.</p><p>Poor Tony’s wife, Rio had thought to herself.</p><p>For a man who prides himself on being a devoted family man and a philanthropic genius, this revelation is devastating, harming the very image that forms the backbone of his carefully curated empire.</p><p>And Rio isn’t the least bit afraid to drag it into the light.</p><p>“I have a story to pitch,” she announces, practically storming into Hela’s office on Sixth Avenue. “And trust me, you’ll want to hear this one.” The sudden intrusion makes the blonde woman startle, nearly spilling her coffee across the polished mahogany desk.</p><p>Rio had spent the entire night holed up in her room, pounding out the article, so much so that even Alice had started to worry. She’d shrugged it off as “work stuff.” And technically, it was work stuff. Just the kind that exposes the man threatening to jeopardize Agatha’s life’s work.</p><p>“Has spending too much time with your girlfriend completely robbed you of your manners?” Hela jests, though her humor quickly fades as she watches Rio drop the files. Her eyes widen, snapping up to meet hers. “What is this—Rio, you can’t be serious. Didn’t I explicitly tell you to stay out of this?”</p><p>Rio stays standing, clears her throat, feeling a flutter of nerves in her chest, but she’s already made up her mind. “I actually almost didn’t bring this to you,” she admits, “because I knew exactly how you’d react. But I did it anyway, because I already think of you as a friend, Hela. So here’s the deal: you help me run this story, or I take it somewhere else. Though honestly, I’m really hoping it’s the first option.”</p><p>Hela slowly sets her coffee cup down, lets out a long exhale, and begins to skim the article Rio has written.</p><p>As her eyes light up ever so slightly and the corner of her mouth twitches, Rio is sure she thinks it’s a solid piece. Something any journalist would be proud to put their name on, and most of all, something that could rattle the business streets of New York. </p><p>This is real journalism. Rio knows it.</p><p>Any half-decent publication wouldn’t dare let a piece like this slip through their fingers.</p><p>Hela lets out another long exhale as she sets the paper down. </p><p>“I’ve got to admit, as a journalist, I respect the guts it takes to pull this off. I’ve only read a few words, but there’s no doubt, this is going to make waves. Hell, this could very well be the end of Stark. But as the friend you claim I am, my honest opinion is that you’re being reckless, and you might very well regret this.” She glares at Rio, then a trace of concern crosses her face. “Does Agatha even know?”</p><p>Rio reluctantly shakes her head. </p><p>“She doesn’t. And I intend to keep it that way, at least until this piece is published.”</p><p>Hela looks at her for another beat, then nods gravely before lifting the pages again.</p><p>“I’m going to run this past the higher-ups,” she continues, shifting to business. “You need to understand that publishing something of this magnitude comes with a lot of conditions. They’ll require thorough fact-checking, airtight sourcing, and the authority to tweak phrasing to manage any legal risk. You have to be ready to stand by everything you’ve written, before and after publication. That includes taking whatever fallout comes your way, work or personal. Once this goes live, there’s no taking it back. Think you can handle that?”</p><p>If it means Stark gets ousted and Agatha keeps Nocturne, then Rio can handle it.</p><p>”Yes.”</p><p>Hela shoots her a wary look and sets the papers down again.</p><p>“I just hope you really know what you’re getting yourself into.” </p><p>Rio knows she is doing the right thing, especially for the people being screwed over by Stark. What she isn’t sure about is whether it is the right thing between her and Agatha. </p><p>But like Hela, she hopes. She hopes Agatha will understand.</p><hr/><p>It had taken less than four days for the Journal to splash her story across the front page. </p><p>The lead photo had shown Tony Stark slipping out of the St. Regis New York late at night, while a set of blurred, censored shots had revealed high-profile wives and celebrities sneaking out the back. </p><p>The headline had blared in bold:<b> Luxury at Labor’s Expense: How Stark Funds His Affairs on Workers’ Wages. </b></p><p>Rio’s name had stared back at her from the byline. But unlike the first time it had appeared in Nocturne, she had felt a strange juxtaposition of exhilaration and apprehension and didn’t know what to make of it.</p><p>As Hela had warned her, the story had blown up within seconds of hitting the internet.</p><p>Every major news site had shared her article, and people had already begun debating the fate of Stark’s business empire, and who might take over the companies that now needed leadership without a questionable reputation.</p><p>Some had speculated it would be Ross, given he held the second-largest share.</p><p>Rio’s phone had been buzzing nonstop once again. Messages from friends and former colleagues congratulating her on yet another career break, news outlets asking if she had Stark’s list of high-profile mistresses, and editors from big-name magazines offering assignments she’d never even imagined.</p><p>Yet through all the noise of the past week, one silence cut deeper than the rest.</p><p>Agatha still hadn’t said a word.</p><p>And all the hope Rio had held onto slowly dropped like autumn leaves with each day that passed without hearing from her.</p><p>Had Rio underestimated the weight of the situation and left Agatha deeply upset? Or had she grown so sure of her feelings that she assumed Agatha would understand? </p><p>“Still nothing?” Alice asks, peeking in and leaning on the doorframe while Rio stays half-distracted by the countless emails and tabs open on her laptop.</p><p>Rio slumps deeper into her chair. She should’ve expected this, right? Agatha’s anger was inevitable after she’d gone behind her back. </p><p>But even if Rio had seen it coming, would it have hurt any less? She tells herself Agatha just needs time, that eventually she’ll understand why Rio did it and that it isn’t something to be gravely worried about.</p><p>“You don’t actually think she’s that mad at you just because of the article, do you?” Alice presses. Rio stays silent. “Okay, say she is. But probably only because you kept it from her and still went ahead after she told you not to get involved. Still, that doesn’t change the fact you did it for her. I’m sure part of her knows that, and maybe even appreciates the guts it took.”</p><p>“Then she would’ve called back, wouldn’t she?” Rio hates how hopeless she sounds.</p><p>Alice flops onto the bed with a groan. “You and your woman are starting to give me gray hair.” She props herself on her elbows. Then her voice gentles. “But for what it’s worth, getting that article out was brave, Rio. I know Agatha was the start, but you fought for it, for the people being treated unfairly. She might be upset you didn’t tell her, but I bet she understands why you did it. That’s still a good thing, no matter what. And I’m proud of you, and I’m pretty sure your mom and dad would have been proud too.”</p><p>Rio looks up from her laptop and gives her a small, genuine smile. “Thanks, Al.” </p><p>She hadn’t even realized how much she needed to hear that.</p><p>Alice gives her shoulder a nudge. “Now how about we celebrate? You sit tight while I go buy us some beers. No buts, you and I are having drinks tonight. You know you’ve earned it, at least. I mean, it’s not every day you write something that actually takes down a literal billionaire.”</p><p>Rio just rolls her eyes but lets Alice have her way. And yeah, she could definitely use a drink.</p><p>Alice is halfway out of the room when a knock at the front door beats her to it, and she and Rio exchange a confused look.</p><p>Who could be knocking this late? Surely it can’t be Billy. That kid never bothers to knock.</p><p>“I’ll get it,” her best friend offers, completely slipping out of Rio’s room.</p><p>Rio barely pays attention, until she hears the front door open.</p><p>Then Alice’s surprised voice carries down the hall:</p><p>“Agatha.” </p><p>And just like that, Rio freezes, her whole body sinking as if plunged into the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Then comes the familiar voice she hasn’t heard in days, slipping in like a ghost:</p><p>“Hi…Alice. Is Rio here?”</p><p>But before Rio can think better of it, her feet are already carrying her into the hallway.</p><p>And there’s Agatha Harkness, standing by the door of their shoebox apartment, looking like she just walked out of a meeting: classic black blazer over a crisp blouse, tailored pants, and her signature Jimmy Choos.</p><p>“I, uh, guess I’d better leave you two. I forgot Billy needs help with his calculus homework,” Alice mumbles (Billy doesn’t even take calculus) before edging past the unexpected visitor and into the hall. “Nice seeing you again, by the way.” But not before giving her best friend a look that clearly says she expects every single detail of whatever is about to happen.</p><p>Rio just stares, uselessly mute, as Agatha lingers at the threshold. They both look uncertain, maybe even a little nervous, but nothing compares to how Rio feels, especially with Agatha’s tight-lipped expression. She pushes the worry down.</p><p>There’s nothing serious to be concerned about, she tells herself, as if saying it enough could stop her from combusting under the tangle of emotions inside her.</p><p>“Can I come in?” the latter asks, the unexpected coldness of her voice cutting through Rio’s thoughts.</p><p>“Yeah, of course,” Rio stammers, blinking as she walks toward the door. “Sorry, it’s just…the place is a bit of a mess.” She steps aside and shuts the door behind them, shaking her head at herself. There’s nothing to be seriously worried about, she reminds herself yet again.</p><p>They’re halfway to the living room when Rio suddenly realizes she hasn’t brushed her hair or changed out of her plaid pajamas and Charlie Brown shirt since that morning.</p><p>A whole week without seeing each other, and this is how Agatha gets to see her. Rio is about to die of mortification.</p><p>“Can I get you something to drink?” she asks, fumbling for some sense of normalcy as Agatha’s eyes scan the room. “Alice has some of her mom’s special green tea tucked away in the kitchen. I could make you some if you’d like—”</p><p>Agatha waves her off without looking. </p><p>“No need. I’m not planning to stay long.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio says, trying and failing to hide the disappointment in her voice, as well as the gnawing dread that, based on Agatha’s cutting coldness, this conversation isn’t going to go well.</p><p>And that gnawing dread wells up as Agatha slowly turns to her, and it’s nothing like the calm face she had shown Alice just minutes ago. Now alone with Rio, her expression is a storm barely held in and ready to break.</p><p>But then her attention drifts, her eyes sliding past Rio and into the open room, landing on the laptop and scattered papers on the desk.</p><p>“Am I catching you in the middle of work?”</p><p>She follows Agatha’s stare and feels her throat go dry. She hadn’t expected that the pale green walls, the crooked Polaroids, the jungle of potted plants on the windowsill, and the books stacked sideways on the shelves would be enough for Agatha to quickly realize she was looking into Rio’s room.</p><p>Did Agatha really know her that well? </p><p>And for some reason, that fact felt almost more intimate than a touch. </p><p>A touch she had embarrassingly been starving for since last week.</p><p>“No, just catching up on some emails,” Rio says, edging toward the kitchen. She can’t let herself freeze there, her knees might give out if she does. “Are you sure you don’t want anything to drink?”</p><p>Agatha’s demeanor changes again, from stormy to distant, and now she looks at Rio with a grimness heavier than when she arrived, as if she’s just snapped out of something herself. </p><p>“No, I’m only here to—” She doesn’t finish the sentence, as if forcing herself to say it, but eventually lets herself settle on, “Javier is waiting for me downstairs.”</p><p>Rio stops mid-step and looks at her. </p><p>“I’ve been trying to call you, but you weren’t—”</p><p>“I’ve been busy. Damage control.”</p><p>Rio feels her throat tighten. Of course, Agatha also had to deal with the fallout from Stark’s mess, one way or another. She wants to skirt around the truth, but she’s not sure it would make a difference, since she already knows why Agatha is here. </p><p>“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about—”</p><p>“You don’t have to apologize,” Agatha cuts in, as if she’s also holding herself together. “What you wrote was necessary, and brilliantly done. Exactly what anyone would expect from you.” She exhales and turns slightly, and Rio can feel the disappointment radiating off her almost immediately. “Though I would have really appreciated it if you’d at least given me a heads-up.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio starts to say, but the words catch in her throat and die before they leave her mouth.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say another word until she’s standing in the middle of the room. Now there’s no mistaking it, she had been far more upset than Rio had allowed herself to believe. So much for hoping otherwise.</p><p>“Thanks to your article, Pepper Stark, well, Potts soon enough, will assume control of Stark Publishing,” she tells Rio, not beating around the bush any longer. “Most of his businesses, in fact, along with some estates and a few key investments. All part of what she’s getting from their spectacularly public divorce.”</p><p>She slowly lets herself sink onto the couch, legs crossed, eyes roving around the room as if she doesn’t even notice Rio staring.</p><p>“But contrary to whoever fed you some of their little stories, she’s known about her husband’s indiscretions for quite some time. And somehow, even with the way we see things so differently, she trusted me enough to let me know what was going on.” </p><p>Rio doesn’t dare speak or even move to sit. </p><p>That explains why Agatha had been seeing Pepper more often than usual.</p><p>“She had her own plans to expose him, but your article beat her to it,” she says, finally locking eyes with Rio. “Turns out she’s a lot more than just the picture-perfect housewife everyone assumes she is.”</p><p>She rises again and walks over to the shelf, fingers brushing over the frames until they settle on one of Rio’s college photos. Rio beams from the picture, a medal gleaming against her chest, hands gripping a framed award that proudly reads: <b><em>Best Investigative Journalist</em></b>.</p><p>“What you wrote was fearless and uncompromising. I get why you went for it, even after I told you not to get involved. You’re simply relentless when you go after something, and you don’t stop until you see it through. I suppose that’s just who you are. You’ve never been the type to shy away from the truth, and I’ve always admired that about you.” Agatha exhales, setting the frame down, and Rio catches the feeble crack in her voice. “But that’s also why we couldn’t see each other anymore.”</p><p>“What?” Rio’s heart immediately drops.</p><p>“Going behind my back despite your best intentions, was reckless,” Agatha tells her, calm but cutting. “Again, Rio. Every time it’s because of me. You’re reckless when it comes to me, and I won’t let it keep happening. Being associated with me could cost you more than you realize, and I won’t allow it.”</p><p>“And what’s so wrong with that?” Rio blinks, incredulous. “I’ve done other things for people before, what’s so different about doing them for you?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a sigh, as if Rio’s words are nothing more than fairy tales.</p><p>“Don’t you see? Once people figure out why you wrote that article, there’ll be speculations about you, assumptions about how you got where you are now. That I’ve been doing you favors, that I’ve been clearing the road. We both know that’s not true, but unfortunately, that’s the story most people will choose to believe. And I won’t let your brilliance, your hard-earned success, be overshadowed by it. I can’t let anyone think it’s anything less than yours because of me.”</p><p>The stillness after Agatha speaks suddenly feels too loud for both of them. And Rio can’t even look at her now, even if she wants to. The truth is there, burning and relentless in her chest, but saying it out loud feels like handing them both a loaded gun. </p><p>She swallows, her throat raw. </p><p>“I—I didn’t mean to…to make things worse. I just…”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes finally meet hers again, the storm behind them terrifyingly clear. This scenario feels eerily familiar, and Rio feels her heart drop lower than it ever has.</p><p>“I know,” she says, reaching out but stopping herself, her hands curling at her sides. “But I can’t let this keep going. We can’t. If we went on like this, we’d just continue becoming each other’s problem. And I won’t let your choices, no matter how well-intentioned, mess up everything you’ve worked for yourself because of me. I can’t. And I won’t. I’m really sorry, Rio.”</p><p>When Rio was a child, her parents always said that an apology for one’s transgressions could undoubtedly mend a wounded heart. But why does the sound of Agatha saying such words feel like it’s only tearing hers apart?</p><p>The apology barely leaves Agatha’s lips before she’s gone, the door slamming behind her and leaving Rio alone, frozen, rooted to the spot.</p><p>Only the faint rumble of a car engine outside the open living room window harshly drags her out of her haze.</p><hr/><p>Rio feels enclosed in a glass tank, the world outside distorted and distant, every sound both magnified and muffled at the same time. She presses her hands against the invisible walls, but they won’t budge.</p><p>Her thoughts float like tiny, panicked fish, darting in every direction, colliding with each other, unable to find a clear path.</p><p>The water feels both protective and suffocating, holding her in place as the world continues on outside, leaving her suspended, fragile, and utterly exposed.</p><p>Then, as if that world suddenly rearranges around her, one of the fish turns and speaks in a clear, recognizable, unmistakably human voice. It rushes through the water like sunlight breaking the surface, and everything stops for a brief while.</p><p>“Rio…” the fish says.</p><p>Rio blinks. </p><p>“Rio…” it says again.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Now why does the fish sound like Hela?</p><p>“You know,” she adds, the human Hela finally cutting through Rio’s near-impenetrable haze, the scene painfully familiar. How on earth did Rio even get here? “We should really stop meeting like this when you’re clearly not even hearing a word I’m saying.”</p><p>Rio blinks, suddenly realizing she’s been staring at the bread basket. “I—I’m sorry,” she clears her throat. “I’m listening.” At the same time, the clatter of dishes and low chatter returns to her consciousness.</p><p>Hela exhales, regarding Rio like a four-eyed fish gasping at the surface for air. Rio feels the same, suddenly parched, as if the water around her has thinned.</p><p>Then, with careful patience, she hears Hela say, “You know, we don’t have to talk about work if you’re not up for it.”</p><p>“No, I’m good.” Rio shakes her head. </p><p>What else would they even talk about? </p><p>She definitely doesn’t want to dredge up what happened last week. </p><p>The whole thing is almost laughable if she thinks about it. The absurdity of it. How does that even happen? How does someone end something that never really even started? </p><p>And yet…Agatha did. </p><p>She cut it off before Rio could even voice what she felt. What a tragedy.</p><p>Definitely not the kind of topic someone wants over a nice morning brunch.</p><p>Hela leans back, letting out a slow sigh. Though unconvinced, she drags out her words as she continues.</p><p>“Well, maybe this will help. Your first international assignment, if you’re interested.” She slides a file across the table. “Three months in Queensland, looking at how climate and other environmental changes are affecting life on the islands. It’s supposed to be mine, but I’d rather my family, especially my brothers, didn’t know I’m in Australia. It’s yours if you want it. I figured you might be better suited for it. Plus, a change of scenery could do you some good.”</p><p>Rio picks up the file and flips through it. </p><p>The assignment is detailed: a deep dive into coastal communities grappling with rising sea levels, gathering firsthand accounts from the locals and its leaders. She’s never done anything like this before, but she’s always wanted to.</p><p>“And when would I be leaving?” she asks, running her eyes over the notes.</p><p>“That depends on your schedule. But the team over there has already been informed someone could head out anytime this week.”</p><p>Great, Rio thinks, still staring at the file.</p><p>“And if I say I want to go tomorrow, could the publication arrange the trip?”</p><p>Hela blinks, disbelief written across her face. “You want to leave tomorrow?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio replies, sure of herself. Then, more seriously, she adds, “I’d rather be out there, actually doing something, than spend another day cooped up in my apartment.”</p><p>Hela studies her for a long stretch. “I mean, Peggy could have everything arranged by tomorrow morning. But you could at least give it another day. Three months is still a long time to be away from here.”</p><p>Rio considers it. Three months. That’s basically a year in dog years. Why she even thinks about dog years, she has no clue. Probably the hangover. She definitely spent a significant amount drinking last night.</p><p>Unsolicited breakups do that to people.</p><p>But she does need to get away. An international assignment is exactly the kind of opportunity that looks great on a resume, and she could even treat it like a mini-vacation. Might as well take it.</p><p>Pressing her lips together, Rio says, “I’m sure. Have them fly me out tomorrow. The sooner I start the assignment, the sooner the story hits print.” </p><p>And the sooner she can get away from Agatha.</p><hr/><p>Rio pushes open the restroom door and checks the time on her phone. Saying yes to Hela only minutes ago means she’s got barely a day to pack for a three-month trip. </p><p>She also still needs to give Alice and Lorna a heads-up. It will be only a quick call but Lorna will definitely have questions. </p><p>Luckily, Rio can frame it as work, because technically it is. An international assignment is an international assignment, even if it’s really just an excuse to disappear for a while and breathe.</p><p>But she barely looks up from her phone, tapping out a quick message to Alice about needing to talk when she gets home, before she accidentally bumps into someone.</p><p>“Good heavens! Do mind where you’re walking!”</p><p>“I—sorry,” Rio mutters, but the apology immediately dies the second she meets the woman’s baleful glare. </p><p>Whatever mess of feelings she still carries for Agatha sharpens into a sudden, hot burn when she recognizes Agatha’s mother. </p><p>Seriously, is the universe testing her now?</p><p>Evanora’s eyes narrow in instant recognition, her lips curling as if the sight of Rio offends her. </p><p>“I remember you.” Her voice drips with condescension, wrapped in a patrician drawl. “The assistant my daughter speaks of so fondly. How is she these days? I heard about that Stark business her little magazine got dragged into. I’ve always said those sorts of frivolous ventures of hers would never last. But, of course, she never listens, and look where that’s gotten her.”</p><p>Rio debates whether to give Evanora the satisfaction of a reply or just walk away, but the jab at Agatha is too much to let slide, even with Agatha being the last person she wants to think about right now.</p><p>And it doesn’t help that the memory of everything this woman put her daughter through flares in Rio’s chest like a lit match.</p><p>“Not that it’s any of your business, Mrs. Harkness, but I don’t work for your daughter anymore.” Her hands curl lightly at her sides, knuckles white, as she forces a controlled inhale. “However, I can assure you, her so-called ‘frivolous venture’ is doing just fine.”</p><p>She’s about to walk away when she hears Evanora’s loud and dismissive scoff. </p><p>“All that effort to dig up dirt on her own mother, and she still eventually got rid of you?” She lets out a cold, mocking chuckle. “Truly, evil never seems to be satisfied, does it?”</p><p>Rio feels a rush of heat pulse through her veins, but it’s the words before the insult that catches her attention.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>“I don’t repeat myself, child.”</p><p>Rio stiffens, staring in disbelief at the recognizable words. She can’t, for the life of her, wrap her head around the idea that someone like Agatha could have come from this woman.</p><p>“Why would your own daughter dig up dirt on you?” Rio asks, pressing despite herself. </p><p>Her mind goes back to the heated argument between Evanora and Agatha at the office the first time Agatha had fired her.</p><p>But it takes Evanora a few seconds of coldly scrutinizing Rio before she finally opens her mouth.</p><p>“What is it about you that makes my selfish, heartless, ingrate daughter go to such lengths? All because of one idle threat I made, that I could ruin your prospects and see to it that you couldn’t work wherever you pleased?”</p><p>Rio can’t believe what she’s hearing. </p><p>She remembers how Agatha had gone out of her way to keep her away from her mother. And now it all makes sense: why Agatha fired her and then brought her back, why she’d always been so careful with her career.</p><p>All this time, Agatha had been looking out for her just as much as she had been looking out for Agatha.</p><p>And for the first time, she realizes that everything she’s done, every risk she’s taken, has been because she <em>loves</em> Agatha. </p><p>And if Agatha has been doing the same for her, maybe, just maybe, Agatha has been feeling the same all along.</p><p>She almost forgets Evanora is still there until the rest of her words hit her ears.</p><p>“That poor child will end up alone, just as I’ve always told her. She’s nothing but a storm who leaves ruin in her wake. Nobody in their right mind, or anyone with God-fearing morals, would want to put up with that.”</p><p>Rio has had enough. She jabs a finger at the older woman, her patience finally snapping. Evanora should be thanking heaven they’re in a public place (and only partially out of sight from the rest of the restaurant) because if they weren’t, Rio would have no qualms about punching her in the face.</p><p>“It’s a shame you don’t see how lucky you are to have Agatha as a daughter, especially since she’s the strongest person I know, having survived you as a mother. You may think poorly of me, but I’ll make damn sure she’s never touched by your cruelty again.”</p><p>Evanora seems taken aback by Rio’s unexpected boldness, and it only gives the latter more courage to speak her mind.</p><p>“And you’re dead wrong. She will never, ever end up alone, because I know there are people who actually care about your daughter, in ways your narrow-minded faith and self-righteous bullshit could never understand. So stay the hell away from her, or you’ll have me to deal with.”</p><p>Rio jabs her finger once more before turning and walking out, leaving the older woman stunned and speechless.</p><hr/><p>Perhaps it’s the adrenaline still thrumming in her veins from verbally taking down a pompous white woman by the restroom of a crowded restaurant, and actually getting away with it.</p><p>Or perhaps it’s something else entirely. </p><p>Whatever it is, Rio finds herself sliding into a cab on a bustling afternoon, the city blurring past the windows, headed for an address she knows better than her own.</p><p>Being back in Nocturne is something she never thought would happen after the fallout with Agatha, yet the familiar walls immediately wrap her in a strange kind of comfort.</p><p>She had actually been thinking about this for a week. Bursting into Agatha’s office or showing up at her door, even briefly flirting with the idea of doing it drunk so she could at least blame her honesty on the booze.</p><p>But hearing those things straight from Evanora just hours ago made Rio realize she couldn’t let another day go by without Agatha knowing how she feels.</p><p>If things go south again, so be it. </p><p>She’s out of here tomorrow anyway. Australia’s big enough to let her heal in peace.</p><p>“Rio? W-what are you doing here?” Jen’s voice cracks with surprise and a hint of intrigue as she jumps up from her desk. </p><p>Rio doesn’t even look at her. “Where is she?” </p><p>The other assistant across the room, whom Rio barely registers, looks just as puzzled.</p><p>“She’s inside, but she’s on a very important call, so—hey! Where do you think you’re going? You can’t just barge in like that—Rio!”</p><p>Jen’s voice fizzles with irritation, like a mosquito meeting its pop on a bug zapper, the second Rio slips into Agatha’s office and slams the door behind her, locking it for good measure.</p><p>The woman inside startles, her tired eyes widening just a fraction as Rio freezes a few feet away.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha says, the name slipping out before she can stop it. But the phone currently pressed to her ear crackles. “No, not you, Jacqueline. That’s—it seems I’ll have to call you later. Oui, je te rappellerai,” she adds, her voice clipped in French before she sets the phone down, her eyes fixing on Rio.</p><p>The silence between them drags on a beat too long, as if the world itself decided to pause just to watch and listen. Agatha finally cuts through it again. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Rio paces in place, her feet mirroring the restlessness she feels in her chest. </p><p>Her heart drums like it’s trying to punch its way out of her ribs.</p><p>She had perhaps imagined this moment once or twice before, telling Agatha how she felt, but never like this.</p><p>She thought she would take it slow, wait until she was sure the other woman would not just bolt. But the timing now leaves no room for tiptoeing around it.</p><p>“You said I’m reckless,” she starts, chest rising and falling too fast, but she forces her voice to stay steady. “That I have a tendency to be, when it comes to you. And yeah, maybe I do. But that doesn’t mean I can’t handle my own shit.” Agatha doesn’t say anything, so she keeps going. “I’m not some fragile, incapable person you think I am. Yes, I’m younger. Yes, I’m new to this business. But that doesn’t make me any less capable of standing on my own, or of protecting myself from the consequences of my choices.” </p><p>Agatha could only stare at her, and Rio takes a deep breath. </p><p>The last time they’d had a conversation like this, it had ended with her getting fired, storming out of this very office, or Agatha leaving her apartment.</p><p>And now, this might just end the same way.</p><p>But she realizes this might be the only chance she’ll ever get to say what she truly feels. </p><p>Why she does the things she does for Agatha, why she can’t look away when Agatha tells her to, why she keeps getting herself into the problems Agatha wants to keep her out of.</p><p>Every unspoken word, every risk she’s ever taken, it all comes down to this. And even though she’s terrified of whatever comes next, she can’t let this pass without telling Agatha the whole truth.</p><p>“I’ve said it already, and I’ll say it again. I’ve done things for other people before, but for you I’d do them differently.” Rio takes a beat to breathe. “Do you know why Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha just looks at her intently, as if she, too, is holding herself together between breaths.</p><p>Agatha somehow managed to become Rio’s anchor, even if everyone else might think she’s the current pulling her under. But Rio knows, deep down, that Agatha is the one keeping her afloat, the one who keeps pushing her back to shore. </p><p>And even if it were the other way around, like everyone else thinks, Rio wouldn’t mind drowning.</p><p>Not when she can stare long and unflinching into Agatha’s eyes, seeing both the storm and the calm all at once.</p><p>In that moment, she admits to herself that she was never meant to withstand eyes like hers. She was made to sink completely, to let herself drift, piece by piece, at Agatha’s feet. </p><p>“The reason I do the things I do for you is because…” She falters, then forces herself to meet Agatha’s eyes. “It’s because I love you,” she finally admits, biting her lip and shaking her head. “No…you know what? That doesn’t even begin to cover it. Even saying ‘love’ feels too fucking small to describe this.” She presses a hand to her chest, over her heart. “But then I can’t call it anything else. And yes, I know that’s the kind of word you’d run from the second someone says it. But that’s exactly how I feel. That’s why I can’t help how I am around you. Everything I do, I do because I love you. I’m hopelessly, irreversibly, entirely in love with you, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha blinks, clearly caught off guard, her blue eyes widening briefly before softening into that familiar, almost fragile look Rio knows better than anyone. </p><p>“You’ve told me over and over that you trust me. Now let that trust be enough to tell me what’s really going through your head when you look at me like that.”</p><p>But all that comes in reply is a faint, almost whispered, “Rio.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head, determined to hear everything. “Just this once, Agatha. Please, the whole truth.” Her knees even threaten to buckle. “What are you thinking?”</p><p>Every nerve in Rio’s body seizes, and a sudden wave of nausea twists through her throat, made worse by Agatha, who is just staring at her.</p><p>If only she could read Agatha’s mind in this moment, then perhaps this whole conundrum would be easier to solve.</p><p>But she can’t. So now she’s stuck, eye to eye with the woman she loves, waiting for even a single word.</p><p>“I—” Agatha opens her mouth, then closes it again.</p><p>Rio only notices her own tears sliding down her cheeks when she sees Agatha struggling to hold back hers. Her blue eyes are faintly rimmed with red, glassier than Rio has ever seen. </p><p>Now, the stretching silence makes Rio almost wish Agatha would just blow her to pieces.</p><p>It might have hurt less than this dagger twisting between her ribs. Because now she feels the feeblest glimmer of hope, and hope is the most dangerous thing Agatha could ever give her.</p><p><em>Say it. Please, just say it.</em></p><p>Rio wills the words silently, letting her hazel eyes plead with the woman in front of her, hoping she can, in some way, feel them without hearing them. And by whatever god is listening, Agatha does feel the words behind Rio’s eyes, and finally, she speaks:</p><p>“I think you should leave.” </p><hr/><p>Frantic packing after a night of crying and drowning in the kind of cheap beer only a 24-hour convenience store can offer is not recommended if someone plans to survive an almost 24-hour flight halfway across the world.</p><p>Perhaps that should be Rio’s next article when she comes back: <b><em>Love, Loss, and Layovers: How Lesbians Handle Heartbreak at 30,000 Feet.</em></b></p><p>And if she were to write it, rule number one would be simple: never, ever fall in love with a stone-cold succubus of a woman whose full-time job is making other people miserable by being a stone-cold succubus. </p><p>More importantly, never lie at work to attend Pride, especially when the boss is likely to be there. That alone could save anyone a whole lot of heartbreak.</p><p>She stuffs the shirt she wore to last Pride into the back of her dresser. Unfortunately, digging through clothes while packing all day dredged it back up. She’d thought about burning it, but why waste perfectly good fabric, and poison the planet in the process?</p><p>Yesterday, she had told Agatha that she loves her. And it might have hurt less if, deep down, she knew Agatha didn’t feel the same. Because knowing her love answers in kind, and Agatha not choosing to say it back, makes it fucking worse. Fucking tragic, even.</p><p>Her tragedy might as well be shared by the heavens, because it’s been raining nonstop since morning.</p><p>Thankfully, there’s no warning of her evening flight being canceled. She doesn’t think she could survive another night of wallowing in her room.</p><p>She gives it one last once-over, making sure she hasn’t left her passport on the bedside table or anything else important for her three-month trip, then closes the door.</p><p>She pads to the kitchen and scribbles a note for Alice, who’d reluctantly left almost an hour ago for work.</p><p>Alice had insisted on driving her to the airport, and Rio appreciated it, really.</p><p>But she didn’t want her best friend hovering over her, feeling sorry for her, or quietly questioning this whole trip.</p><p>She sticks the note on the fridge, promising to call once she lands in Cairns.</p><p>She also warns Alice to keep Billy away from her plants while she’s gone, saying the kid couldn’t nurture a cactus if his life depended on it. He’s like a reverse Midas, turning every leaf he touches into instant death.</p><p>The same trait the woman who broke her heart yesterday had, just before Rio taught her how to.</p><p>But Rio quickly shakes the thought off. If she wants to survive this grueling, almost 24-hour flight to the land down under, it has to start with not letting herself cry again at the mere thought of the said woman.</p><p>She’s about to dump the coffee mugs she’s been drinking from all day into the sink when a frantic knocking rattles the front door.</p><p>Rio wonders who it could be, then remembers that Billy had texted her this morning, saying he’d try to leave his boyfriend’s place early to stop by before she left. It must be the teen coming to say goodbye.</p><p>She grabs her oversized rucksack from the couch, snatches her keys, and heads for the door. </p><p>It’s only when she opens it that she wishes she hadn’t.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing here?” She clamps down on the urge to slam the door shut.</p><p>She stares at the figure in front of her, silently hoping the disdain in her eyes comes through louder than the surprise. Because standing on her front door is Agatha. </p><p>Dressed in a dark blue velvet gown with long sleeves, the side panel a deep, dark fuchsia — a dress clearly meant for some gala or charity event, yet now drenched from the relentless rain outside. Her long, dark hair is plastered to her face and shoulders, droplets tracing the curve of her jaw, and a fob dangles loosely from her fingers.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Agatha retorts, eyeing the rucksack on Rio’s shoulder instead of answering her question. Her chest heaves, and she’s visibly shivering from the cold.</p><p>It takes everything in Rio not to look at her worriedly. Jesus. Did she really drive all the way here by herself? She shoves the thought down, and clears her throat.</p><p>“None of your business.”</p><p>Agatha frowns at her. “I’m asking you a question, Rio. Where are you going?”</p><p>Still, Rio doesn’t answer and just starts a staring contest. </p><p>Why give Agatha the satisfaction of a response? She could just slam the door in her face, right? Agatha at the very least deserves that. But seeing her like this, shivering, drenched, clearly exhausted, makes it harder for Rio to go through with it.</p><p>“Why do you even care? And I asked you first. What are you doing here?”</p><p>“No. I am asking you. Where on earth are you going?”</p><p>Rio scoffs at Agatha’s audacity but answers anyway. Might as well get this over with. “I’m heading to the airport. There. Now you know. Satisfied?” she snaps. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, you’re blocking my door.”</p><p>“And why would you be heading to the airport?”</p><p>Rio tugs her bag strap tighter. “Because I have a flight to catch. Why else?” </p><p>Agatha doesn’t back down. “Flight to where exactly?”</p><p>Rio exhales and crosses her arms. “You’re not going to let me leave until I answer, are you?”</p><p>“You do know me well.”</p><p>“Oh, do I really?” Rio hisses, arching an eyebrow, her tone dripping with sarcasm and frustration. It’s only when she catches the obvious hurt in Agatha’s eyes that she’s forced to relent just enough. “I’m covering another feature for the Journal. They’re sending me to Queensland to—”</p><p>“Queensland?” Agatha’s usual mask of practiced indifference slips just enough for Rio to notice. Rio nods, and Agatha follows with, “And you’re leaving right now?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t be standing at this door, about to leave, if I wasn’t.”</p><p>Agatha only stares at her, then nods, as if silently conceding she deserves the tone Rio is using. </p><p>Rio catches the subtle swallow. </p><p>“And how long are they sending you out there for?” </p><p>“About three months.”</p><p>“Three months?” Her blue eyes give her away. “And you didn’t even think twice about it?”</p><p>Truth is, Rio had thought twice about it because of Agatha. But it’s also Agatha who actually pushed her to do it anyway. But that’s not something Agatha needs to hear.</p><p>Rio lets out a small scoff, clicking her tongue against her cheek. “Why would I pass up a perfect opportunity for an international assignment? Now, please, step aside. I’m really running late.”</p><p>That’s a lie. She has nearly five hours to spare.</p><p>“Can we just talk for a minute?”</p><p>“No. We had plenty of that yesterday and the other night. I don’t have time for another now, so just get out of my way, Agatha.”</p><p>But Agatha bars the doorway with one arm.</p><p>“I’m not letting you leave unless we talk.”</p><p>Rio fights the urge to jump out a nearby window and hail a cab.</p><p>“As far as I remember, there’s nothing left to talk about. I got your message loud and clear, and I’ve already said everything I need to say. If you’re worried I’m upset, trust me, I’m doing my best not to be. Now, unless you want that to change, please move out of my way.”</p><p>Rio reaches to move Agatha’s arm, but Agatha plants her palm against her sternum and pushes back, harder than Rio expects from someone balanced on dagger-heeled Jimmy Choos.</p><p>“What the hell?” she glares, stumbling as her backpack drops with a dull smack. “Did you just shove me? For real?”</p><p>“I mean it, Rio. You’re not going anywhere until we talk.”</p><p>Rio steps back and checks her watch. </p><p>She still has a couple of hours to spare, but she’d rather kill time at the airport than spend another minute trapped in the agonizing presence of Agatha Harkness. </p><p>One more rejection from this woman is the last thing she needs before she leaves. </p><p>“Agatha, I really can’t do this right now,” she says, trying for authority, though her voice wavers more than she wants. “What’s left to talk about? I already said what I said. We’re not on the same page, I get it. What else do you want? For me to admit I’m an idiot for even saying it?” She bites her lip, refusing to repeat yesterday’s words. “Fine then. I’m an idiot. Now forget it, okay? We’re done here.”</p><p>“No. You don’t get to decide when this is over. I do,” Agatha snaps, jabbing a finger at Rio, who recoils. “And yes, you are, undeniably, an idiot. Dropping all that on me yesterday and now running off? Impeccable timing, Rio. Truly impeccable.”</p><p>Rio just stares for a beat, caught between shock and awe at the sudden ferocity in Agatha’s voice. “Seriously? You’re the one who’s angry right now?” She gives a short, bitter laugh. “Yeah, okay. Sure.”</p><p>Agatha tries to breathe, still visibly shaking from the cold, but Rio is too mad to offer even a hint of sympathy. She notices the quick rise and fall of Agatha’s chest as she struggles for composure, and, against her will, Rio feels her own anger beginning to thaw.</p><p>“Sorry. I shouldn’t have—” Agatha glances down at her drenched gown. “Just listen to me. Please, Rio?”</p><p>Rio hesitates, letting the silence stretch like a drawn-out chord. Then, with a reluctant tilt of her head, she sighs. “Fine. Just make it quick before I change my mind.”</p><p>Agatha perks up, and nothing could have prepared Rio for seeing her on the verge of tears just because Rio agreed to listen. Rio catches her own breath and forces her face into a neutral expression.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat. “I…uh, I’ve always prided myself on staying in control, on always knowing what comes next. I think you know that by now. That’s how I’ve built my life, and my career along with it. I plan, I anticipate, I stay one step ahead of everyone else. And I make sure nothing ever pushes me out of it.” </p><p>Silence stretches between them a bit until Agatha lets out a slow breath.</p><p>“And I’ve been doing that, keeping everything under control just fine — until you showed up. Suddenly, I’m chasing myself…and losing. And that’s impossible, because the Agatha Harkness I know doesn’t lose. But with you, it’s like there’s a version of me I’m trying to reach, and then you’re right there in the way, and I completely forget where I am, or what it is I’m even reaching for.”</p><p>Rio hates that her heart is racing. </p><p>She’s supposed to be mad, but her anger feels like it’s shrinking as she watches Agatha pause, visibly struggling to get the words out. She’s confessing that Rio unsettles her, that Rio has thrown her off balance, and Rio doesn’t know whether to step forward or step back.</p><p>“You asked me what I was thinking after you said all that yesterday,” Agatha begins again. “Well, the truth is, it’s the same thing I’ve been thinking long before you even said any of it.” She doesn’t break eye contact, even as Rio struggles to hold hers. “I mean, how could I not? How could I not, when you made it far too easy? That’s what runs through my head every time I look at you. Every thought I have of you starts there, and it never really ends.”</p><p>The command in Agatha’s tone wavers as she exhales again slowly. </p><p>And for the first time, her voice doesn’t even sound like it belongs to Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“When you make me laugh until I forget why I was angry. When you ramble about the dumbest little things and I forget why I was scared. When you sometimes say my name in your sleep. When your scent gets stuck on my clothes and I catch myself smiling like some lovesick schoolgirl.” Agatha pauses, then, with burning frustration, “I’m a grown woman, and the editor of the country’s most cutting-edge fashion magazine, for heaven’s sake! I shouldn’t be catching myself smiling like some stupid schoolgirl.”</p><p>Her eyes don’t cower, not even for a second. And that alone makes Rio hold her own breath.</p><p>“But what’s worse is realizing that I don’t even mind it anymore. And every time you stumble over your words, every time that ridiculous smile spreads across your face, I just want to kiss you like some stupid schoolgirl.” She draws another shaky breath. “Being with you makes it feel like I’m finally able to breathe. Because I know there’s no hiding when I’m with you. You see me. All of me. You see through me, and even though it fucking terrifies me, I’d still fucking let you. I’d still let you, because every part of me just can’t get enough of you, Rio. So tell me, how could I ever not <em>love</em> you?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t move. Not a word, not even a breath escapes her. </p><p>She just stands there, willing her legs not to give out.</p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, looks like she’s just stepped off a ledge. </p><p>Her composure, poise, and every piece of carefully crafted armor have utterly slipped. The hand that had been pointed at Rio only minutes ago drops uselessly to her side.</p><p>“But I’m afraid that I might fail at this. What can I even bring to a relationship? I don’t even know how to be in a normal one. You, of all people, know firsthand that I’ve miserably failed in that department. And I’m terrified that it could be you now, because what I can give you isn’t the full, perfect version of the love you deserve, and that scares the hell out of me because you’re—”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio quickly grabs her hands, her own tears falling down her cheeks. “Baby, there’s no such thing as a full, perfect version of love. At least, not at the start. Love isn’t a finished manuscript. You don’t hand over the final draft the first time you write. You revise, you fix, you send it out. Love’s the same way, and that’s okay. That’s how it grows.” </p><p>Another beat passes, just the two of them staring into each other’s tear-filled eyes.</p><p>“Do you ever wonder why you see me in the middle, when you said you were trying to reach this other, perfect version of yourself? The one who never loses? Maybe it’s because I don’t need that perfect version, Agatha. I’m in the middle because I simply want to meet you where you are. I’m here because I want <em>this</em> you, the one you are right now. The one who’s trying, the one who’s scared, the one who’s still learning. Even if it’s a grown woman who feels like a lovesick schoolgirl when she’s with me,” Rio says, letting out a soft chuckle they both share. “I’d still want you, even if it’s not the ideal version you think you should be. Just the version that makes you…whole enough to be with me.”</p><hr/><p>The ride to the airport passes in near silence, broken only by the sound of passing cars, the light patter of rain, and the boygenius album playing softly through Agatha’s speakers.</p><p>Neither of them has spoken much since their conversation at Rio’s apartment. Even though Rio keeps thinking of things she could say, the words just won’t come.</p><p>And Agatha, if anything, has said even less, right up until they reach the airport.</p><p>Still, the ride has at least given them a little more time together before she leaves.</p><p>And it seems Agatha wants to stretch that borrowed time a bit longer, too. Already changed into one of Rio’s hoodies, she pulls the hood up and tucks all her hair beneath it. Only after a quick phone call to a certain someone and a short talk about an escort pass do they finally step out of the car.</p><p>Now they sit side by side on the hard airport chairs, the hood of Rio’s hoodie pulled so low over Agatha’s head, sunglasses hiding her from any prying eyes even though it’s dark outside.</p><p>They wordlessly sip one awful airport coffee after another as they wait, and not once does Rio hear her complain.</p><p>Two hours pass slowly before Rio’s plane is finally called, and it’s time to go. They both stand almost at the same time, and Rio hesitates for a second before pulling Agatha into a long, tight hug.</p><p>She holds on longer than she intends, breathing in the familiar lavender scent, feeling the warmth of Agatha’s body pressed against her own. Agatha squeezes back just as firmly, a small sigh slipping against Rio’s ear, before they slowly step apart. </p><p>Rio gives her a small smile, and Agatha returns it just as softly.</p><p>“When I get back, you better have that ice cream date planned,” Rio teases, trying to lighten the mood without giving Agatha a chance to overthink anything else.</p><p>The latter just rolls her eyes. “As if you’d ever let me forget it.”</p><p>Rio chuckles, and they share a look, both exhaling at the same time.</p><p>After a brief glance around the nearly empty lounge, Agatha lets out another breath, slips off her sunglasses, and grabs Rio by the strap of her backpack, pulling her in without hesitation.</p><p>The kiss is searing and unrestrained, and Rio answers by pressing herself tight against Agatha, her hands curling around her waist as if bracing against gravity itself.</p><p>What has Rio done? Is it too late to back out now? How on earth could she possibly get through the next three months without this woman?</p><p>A tiny, frustrated sigh escapes Agatha as she pulls away, her cheeks flushed.</p><p>“That better carry you through your whole trip,” she quips, cradling her face with both hands, and can’t resist giving Rio another quick peck on the lips.</p><p>Rio smiles against her, the warmth of her body settling into her as she looks around. Can’t believe they just did that out here. Well, kissing in an airport is common enough not to draw much attention anyway.</p><p>Then she looks back at Agatha, and smiles again as she studies her.</p><p>Wearing Rio’s oversized hoodie, long hair tucked inside the hood, Rio’s faded jogging trousers, and scuffed white sneakers, Agatha looks nothing like the editor-in-chief of New York’s top fashion magazine. It’s far from her customary high-fashion standards, yet Rio can’t help but find it irresistibly endearing.</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking, and don’t even dare mention this to anyone. This doesn’t do my reputation any favors,” Agatha warns, aware of how she looks.</p><p>Rio chuckles and shakes her head, though inside she’s really thinking, <em>I can’t believe I get to love you like this. </em>Instead, she smiles a little and says, “Don’t worry, I intend to keep this particular picture of Agatha Harkness just to myself.” She tucks a strand of hair from Agatha’s forehead. “Try not to miss me too much.”</p><p>Agatha hums, then mutters, “I think I’ll survive.”</p><p>But the way her eyes look at Rio tells her everything she needs to know. They hold each other’s gaze a little longer, an intimate understanding passing between them, before Rio leans in for one final hug. </p><p>She feels Agatha close her eyes, pressing closer as she tightens her hold. </p><p>Yeah. There’s no doubt, they’ll miss each other terribly.</p><hr/><p>It had only taken about five and a half days before Rio had started receiving lengthy emails from Agatha, rather than their usual string of quick, back-and-forth texts.</p><p>Mostly reminders and gentle nagging to reapply sunscreen every two hours because the Australian sun is brutal at this time of year, not to forget drinking enough water or risk passing out on some beach, warnings that it’s still stinger season and how dangerously venomous the jellyfish can be, and never to neglect wearing a life vest whenever hopping from one island to the next.</p><p>From time to time, their correspondence had included updates about what had been happening in New York, particularly at work, and occasionally Agatha had vented a little about the prosaic catastrophe (as she likes to call it) unfolding at Nocturne headquarters.</p><p>Agatha’s emails had become her ritual at the end of each week, arriving whenever she returned to her small, rustic inn on one of the main islands, where she could get online before moving to another island that might, or might not, have reliable internet.</p><p>She opens her laptop, and clicks on Agatha’s email first among the dozens waiting in her inbox.</p><blockquote><p><b><em>Dear Rio,</em></b></p><p><em>I trust you’re actually taking my warnings seriously. Sunburn is not a joke. The jellyfish are not a joke either. And if you get stung by one of those tiny nightmares, I swear I will personally file a lawsuit against whoever thought it was a good idea to send you into harm’s way.</em></p><p><em>Did you know jellyfish stingers burn out once they hit something? I read it in an article. They’re designed for plankton, not journalists with zero sense of danger. </em></p><p><em>So please, for the love of the ecosystem, don’t go screwing up the food chain while you’re at it.</em></p><p><em>I imagine the Australians will have vinegar bottles lined up along the beach in case you, or someone equally reckless, wanders into a tentacle. You’ll probably think it’s quaint. I, on the other hand, see it as proof of how often people ignore the signs.</em></p><p><em>That said, I still expect you to have fun down there. Just keep yourself out of trouble. And, of course, think of me waiting here when you inevitably ignore that advice. </em></p><p><b><em>—Agatha</em></b></p></blockquote><p>Rio shakes her head slightly, a wide grin spreading across her face as she thought about how Agatha had actually gone and researched Australia’s marine life all for her.</p><p>She takes a sip of the bitter, lukewarm coffee from the inn’s chipped mug before starting to type her reply.</p><blockquote><p><b><em>My dearest Agatha, </em></b></p><p><em>Don’t worry, your warnings have been duly noted, though I can’t promise my grin will ever be any smaller when I think of them.</em></p><p><em>The sunburn situation is under control (thankfully I remember to reapply every two hours, just like you said), and you also don’t have to worry about me messing up the ecosystem with a jellyfish sting. I’m accompanied by a few very capable local guides who make sure I stay well out of trouble. </em></p><p><em>You’d be proud, though. They even showed me how to safely hold a tiny reef fish without startling it and taught me which shells are safe to touch.</em></p><p><em>Work going okay? Hope all the hubbub with the ownership change isn’t driving you crazy. A little bird tells me you haven’t been firing anyone, so I guess that’s a good sign. But please, don’t forget to eat. Even someone like you, who can handle anything, needs real food. I’d hate to hear you’re surviving on just coffee and whatever random snacks you grab on the go.</em></p><p><em>As for me…well, attached is a little proof that I’m somehow managing to follow your advice and have fun at the same time. It took a while to earn the locals’ trust since they’re very protective of their home, and I couldn’t blame them. It had only been two weeks, but the beauty of the islands had already captured my heart. It truly is a place that deserves protecting.</em></p><p><em>Luckily, I’ve made a few friends by helping them gather crabs, catch baitfish, and even learning to weave palm fronds into little nets. Now they’re showing me hidden swimming spots and pointing out all the tiny creatures I’d otherwise overlook. I’m learning more from them in a single day than I ever could from a textbook, and it’s been absolutely incredible.</em></p><p><em>Missing you more than I thought possible.</em></p><p><em>Yours,</em><b><em><br/></em></b><b><em>Rio</em></b></p></blockquote><p>Before hitting send, Rio attaches a photo of herself swimming with the local kids, wearing her forest green bikini top and shorts and a wide, sun-soaked grin.</p><p>A few days later, she opens Agatha’s reply, and it is every bit as pointed and prissy as she had anticipated.</p><blockquote><p><b><em>Dear Rio,</em></b><em> </em></p><p><em>I’m happy to see that you’re actually enjoying yourself. I can practically hear your laughter through this photo. Though I couldn’t help but notice that the shot includes a small crowd looking at you with more admiration than is strictly necessary. Do they know someone is waiting for you here when you return? If not, perhaps it’s time to enlighten them, don’t you think?</em></p><p><em>Work has been interesting, to say the least. And your little bird, whoever that may be (rest assured, I will somehow find out), is correct. No one has been fired lately. </em></p><p><em>I can only assume it’s either because I’ve been too preoccupied or, miraculously, people have finally started doing their jobs properly instead of being complete imbeciles. </em></p><p><em>Remarkably, Pepper has been handling things far better than Stark ever did. It’s almost unsettling how competent she’s being.</em></p><p><em>I’ll be attending a gala next month, and I’m still struggling to decide what to wear. Monica and Sue have been excruciatingly slow at preparing options.</em></p><p><em>And while you are finding the pleasure in all your little adventures, I’m still reminding you to keep your mischief within tolerable limits. I would like your fingers still intact when you get back.</em></p><p><em>Also, I admit, things here would be far more interesting if you were around.</em></p><p><b><em>—Agatha</em></b></p></blockquote><p>It’s late at night, just before she drifts off to sleep, that Rio finally sends a reply of her own.</p><blockquote><p><b><em>My dearest Agatha,</em></b></p><p><em>I’m happy you can hear my laughter through the photo, though I swear most of it comes from trying not to fall off the rocks while diving with the kids. </em></p><p><em>And don’t worry, my admirers know full well that someone very important is waiting for me back home. </em></p><p><em>I might have also mentioned, casually, that this someone is as possessive as a mantis shrimp when it comes to what’s hers, so they won’t be trying anything. I left absolutely no room for confusion.</em></p><p><em>As for my little insider, don’t even think about hunting them down. Let me have eyes there. It keeps me connected to you in a way and calms my thoughts while I’m here. I promise I’m only letting them report on the important stuff.</em></p><p><em>About your gala. Might I suggest darker colors? They’ll make those piercing eyes of yours stand out even more. Though I’m sure you’ll look breathtaking as always, no matter what Monica and Sue manage.</em></p><p><em>While I’m finding adventure in every corner, exploring hidden inlets, and making spectacularly clumsy attempts at fishing, I’m keeping your warnings in mind. Don’t worry, fingers intact, promise.</em></p><p><em>Also, I watched a breathtaking sunset today, and for a moment, it felt like you were right here with me. Even surrounded by all this beauty and adventure, I can’t help but miss you even more.</em></p><p><em>Yours,</em><b><em><br/></em></b><b><em>Rio</em></b></p></blockquote><p>Rio smiles as she reads Agatha’s reply a few nights later.</p><blockquote><p><b><em>Dear Rio, </em></b></p><p><em>It’s been a maelstrom here, though a productive one. I’ve been neck-deep in managing the latest issue, and, surprisingly, Pepper hasn’t raised a single concern about the budget. In fact, I think we’re aligning better than I ever expected. Almost makes me wonder if I’ve been too quick to doubt her.</em></p><p><em>Marmee and Fanny are staying at my townhouse for the weekend. Marmee just signed up for a two-day bonsai and flower-arranging workshop at the New York Botanical Garden. Apparently it’s the “latest craze” in her social circle.</em></p><p><em>And she’s been insisting on feeding me practically nonstop. So don’t worry, I’m well-fed, though I can’t help but wonder if I’ll still fit into the gala outfit I chose after Marmee’s enthusiastic ministrations. </em></p><p><em>I followed your advice, by the way. Going with a darker color, and I admit, it’s a perfect contrast to make my eyes stand out. When did you become such a fashion expert, I wonder?</em></p><p><b><em>—Agatha</em></b></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, it had taken longer than Rio had expected before she’s able to reply.</p><blockquote><p><b><em>My dearest Agatha, </em></b></p><p><em>I’m sorry I hadn’t replied sooner. We ended up stuck on a tiny, remote island longer than planned. The boat broke down, and we had to wait three extra days. But everything’s fine now. The locals there were kind enough to welcome me into their home and even taught me how to make these cute seashell bracelets. I promised them I’d bring you one.</em></p><p><em>I’m certainly still not an expert in fashion. Perhaps I’ve just grown to become an expert in you. :) </em></p><p><em>I’m happy to hear Marmee is taking on a new hobby and keeping you well-fed. And of course, Fanny must be loving all the extra attention.</em></p><p><em>The other islands here are even more beautiful than I imagined, but the beauty doesn’t exactly hide the struggle. I’ve watched fishermen dragging in nearly empty nets, kids carrying loads that are too heavy for their age, parents patching together a living however they can. It’s hard, exhausting work, and it humbles me every day. Though I’m grateful I get to tell their story, I just wish I could do more.</em></p><p><em>The time on that island gave me a lot of space to think. Mostly about you. Even more so after I met an old woman who waits on the shore every day for her husband to return from fishing. I asked her why she still does it after all these years. She just smiled and said, “The sea may not always be kind, but it always gives me back the man I love. So I wait at the shore, to remind the sea he has someone to return to.”</em></p><p><em>I haven’t been able to shake that. And it made me realize I don’t ever want to stop waiting for you either.</em></p><p><em>I love you, my dearest Agatha. Being here, so far from you, only makes me feel it more deeply. Because even surrounded by all this beauty, it’s still really you I’m thinking of.</em></p><p><em>Until I can tell you all of this in person, </em><b><em><br/>Rio</em></b></p><p><b><em>-</em></b></p><p><b><em>My Rio, </em></b></p><p><em>I was worried sick when I didn’t hear from you for a few days. My mind spun through every possible scenario, each one worse than the last. If I’m being honest, I was this close to booking a flight on impulse, tossing aside every rational thought, just to make sure you were safe. And embarrassingly enough, I even caught myself picturing storming every island there if I didn’t hear from you soon.</em></p><p><em>I realize now just how unbearable the thought of anything happening to you truly is. Even from halfway across the world, you occupy more space in my mind than anyone or anything else. </em></p><p><em>It’s infuriating, this hold you have over me. What on earth have you done? And why, despite all better judgment, do I find myself unwilling to be free of it?</em></p><p><em>Anyway, I have no doubt you’ll be writing a compelling piece, because that’s what you do. You have this rare gift of making people feel like they’ve been there themselves, like they’re seeing it all through your eyes. I can already imagine you’ll make their stories matter, simply because they mattered to you.</em></p><p><em>Also, how strict is that three-month timeline your editor gave you? Do you think there’s any chance you’ll be back the first week? I might need someone to make the other dreadfully boring guests at that gala I mentioned a bit more tolerable. But no pressure if you can’t, of course. </em></p><p><em>I’ve already started counting the days until you’re back, and somehow every second without you stretches into a year. I hate admitting it, especially as someone who prides herself on staying busy, but it feels like my whole world is on pause until you’re here again.</em></p><p><em>Yours,<b><br/></b><b>Agatha</b></em></p></blockquote><hr/><p>Rio tumbles off the plane like a storm-drenched rag doll, each step heavy with a backpack that feels even heavier than when she left. </p><p>Her short hair is wild and frizzy from nearly three months of sun, salt, and humidity. She didn’t have time to freshen up on the plane, hiding her tired eyes behind aviators. </p><p>Pushing through the throng of travelers, she rolls her backpack across the cracked tile, eyes scanning for the taxi line like a survivor finally spotting solid ground after months at sea.</p><p>“No need to hunt for a cab,” someone says, close enough to feel the words brush her ear.</p><p>Rio spins toward the voice, eyes wide. </p><p>“Jen? What—what are you doing here?” Seeing a familiar face after so much time away brings Rio an almost instant sense of comfort, even though it’s someone she didn’t really expect. “Wait, did Agatha send you? I very specifically said not to.”</p><p>Jen’s expression doesn’t change, though Rio can tell she’s clearly annoyed. A look she’s seen countless times during their shared past at Nocturne, one that hints at impatience and exasperation.</p><p>“No. She didn’t. I came on my own. Now get your ass moving. I had to park over there, and the last thing I need now is a parking ticket.”</p><p>“Really?” Rio asks, scratching her neck like a confused goldfish, but she still follows her former colleague toward the parked car. How did she even know Rio was coming home?</p><p>Rio wants to ask more questions, but seeing Jen look like someone’s holding a gun to her head, she decides not to pry and lets the heavy, awkward silence of the car ride speak for itself.</p><p>It’s also a bit of a relief, if she’s being honest. Nearly twenty-four hours trapped on planes have left her drained, and she can barely form a coherent thought anyway. </p><p>Ever since the plane had landed, her mind has been completely consumed with how badly she can’t wait to see Agatha again.</p><p>So, after a few perfunctory exchanges with her unexpected company, she sinks into her seat, closes her eyes, and lets herself welcome a brief reprieve.</p><p>Almost an hour later, Rio’s eyes crack open again, and she groggily takes in her surroundings. </p><p>They’re definitely far from the airport, she realizes, scanning the passing buildings. Still, she’s not so out of it to miss that this isn’t the way to her apartment. Where the hell is Jen taking her?</p><p>“I hate to complain, since I’m basically getting a free ride, but this doesn’t exactly look like the right way to my place. Are you sure you’re following the route I sent?”</p><p>“Who said we were going there?”</p><p>“We’re not? But…didn’t you ask for my address?”</p><p>“You gave it to me, dummy. I never actually asked.”</p><p>Right, it had been Rio who sent the link herself before dozing off.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio drags the word. “So, where exactly are we going? I don’t mean to freak out, but I’ve only got a few hours to get ready for that gala Agatha invited me to, and I haven’t even figured out what to wear. Not to mention, I haven’t showered since the flight, and my hair…well, let’s just say it’s not looking its best.” She also sniffs it cautiously. “Or smelling its best, either.”</p><p>“Can you stop whining? Your voice is frying my ears. And sit your butt down, we’re nearly there.”</p><p>“Nearly where?”</p><p>Shortly after, the car stops in front of a row of two-story brownstones. They’re not the flashy, over-the-top kind from the ritzy parts of town, but they look very decent and well-kept. </p><p>Still, Rio is as confused as a black cat in a dog park. What the hell are they even doing here?</p><p>Rio asks again, “Where on earth are we?”</p><p>“My place,” Jen answers dryly, reaching for her purse in the backseat.</p><p>“And what exactly am I supposed to be doing at your place?”</p><p>“Quit talking and just follow me.” </p><p>Jen doesn’t even look back as she unlocks the door, holding it open for Rio with a touch of obvious impatience. Rio steps inside reluctantly, dropping her oversized rucksack by the threshold.</p><p>Surprisingly, Jen’s home appears to fit in a wealthy family’s history book. Walls lined with oil paintings in plated frames, ornate furniture polished to a gleam, and thick curtains that scream old-money taste. </p><p>Rio hadn’t realized Jen was this rich. Jesus. What the hell is she even doing as Agatha’s assistant if she’s basically moving through life like a near-blue-blood herself?</p><p>“Make yourself comfortable,” Jen says, motioning toward the living room. “Want something to drink?”</p><p>“Just water, thanks.”</p><p>Jen disappears down a short hallway, and Rio collapses onto the plush couch. Her eyes wander around the room again as she twists her fingers nervously. </p><p>Jen isn’t some kind of psycho killer, is she? Rio hasn’t really been that much of a pain to her, right? Nothing that would make her want to, say, stab someone. </p><p>Hopefully that’s off the table, because Rio is still really looking forward to seeing Agatha.</p><p>Jen steps back into the room, holding a glass of cold water, and plunks it into Rio’s hand. </p><p>“Try not to spill. That upholstery didn’t come cheap,” she mutters, as if Rio’s mere presence is mildly inconvenient. </p><p>The latter takes the glass and watches Jen sink onto the plush couch across from her, legs crossed, fingers drumming on the knees of her sleek, dark pink tailored pants.</p><p>“I had a feeling you’d be in a rush and might not have time to sort out what to wear for the gala tonight,” Jen says. “So I went ahead and took care of it for you.” She nods toward the wall, where a modish tailored ensemble hangs neatly in a clear garment bag. </p><p>How had Rio not even noticed it until now? </p><p>“Not my top effort, but it’s the best I could throw together on such short notice. I’m guessing this is the kind of color you’d actually like?” </p><p>Jen must be fucking joking calling it “not her top effort,” because Rio can barely believe her eyes. </p><p>The said ensemble is a midnight-purple velvet blazer with slightly exaggerated shoulders and a high collar, draping gracefully at the waist with a soft sash, the lapels and cuffs edged with subtle silver embroidery.</p><p>Underneath is a dark-grey turtleneck, paired with high-waisted velvet pants featuring the same embroidered details along the sides.</p><p>Who did Jen have to twist an arm, or maybe blackmail, to get a piece like this?</p><p>Rio gapes, staring at it and then back at her.</p><p>“Jen! Where did you even get this? Agatha didn’t have anything to do with this, did she?” </p><p>“Why do you underestimate me? She isn’t the only one with connections to a ton of designers, you know. Sure, I got some of mine from her, but no. She had nothing to do with this. She didn’t even know I picked you up from the airport, remember? This is all me. Actually…me, with a little help from someone.”</p><p>“Someone? And who exactly?” Rio asks, completely baffled. The doorbell rings before she can ask more, and Jen gets up from the couch and heads to the door, leaving Rio staring in confusion.</p><p>When Jen reappears, Rio’s gape nearly turns into a full-blown jaw-drop, because standing beside her, sporting that very familiar scampish grin, is Alice. </p><p>“Surprise! Miss me?” her best friend practically shouts as she steps inside, arms wide as if she’s about to swallow Rio in a hug.</p><p>Rio’s eyes go wide as saucers, and she almost springs from the couch. “Alice?! What the—what are you doing here? How did you even—” She glances back and forth between her newly arrived best friend and the homeowner. “Wait, you two know each other?” </p><p>Alice beams at Jen, who just rolls her eyes. </p><p>“Oh no, I only met her outside,” Jen deadpans.</p><p>Alice chuckles, giving Jen a light nudge. </p><p>“Come on, babe. She just got here. Let’s cut her some slack.”</p><p>“Babe?!” If her eyeballs could roll out of her head, Rio’s would have done it already.</p><p>That explains how Jen knew Rio was coming home.</p><p>Alice nods eagerly, her grin stretching impossibly wide. </p><p>“Yeah. Can you believe it?” she says, positively vibrating with pride, as if the whole world should stop just to admire the fact that she’s dating Jennifer Kale. </p><p>Rio slowly shakes her head, still in shock. Jen fixes her with a pointed glare. “What? Don’t get me wrong, I’m genuinely thrilled for you two, but I’m completely lost here. How long has this been going on? And most importantly, how did this even happen?” She points at Alice. “And why didn’t you tell me?”</p><p>Alice shrugs, shoulders rising and hands lifting in a casual gesture, her grin tipping lopsided. </p><p>“I mean, I was planning to tell you the second we started dating, but I just hadn’t found the right time. I really didn’t want to distract you while you were there. Trust me, I spent a whole month dying to tell you, until Jen and I decided it was better to do it in person. Much more fun this way, don’t you think?”</p><p>Rio can only stare at the two of them. </p><p>Alice looks genuinely happy, and Jen, well, she’s been unexpectedly kind to her and seems just as happy as Alice. </p><p>Her best friend’s right, telling Rio in person was definitely the way to go. Halfway across the globe, and she wouldn’t have known how to properly react if she had found out any other way.</p><p>“So, how did you two meet?”</p><p>Alice chuckles. “Well, it’s actually a funny story because Jen here—”</p><p>But Jen interrupts her with a violent look. “How Alice and I met isn’t exactly relevant right now, okay? The point is, we’re dating, we’re very happy, and now you know. And yes, I freaked out and nearly died in horror when I found out she knows you and that you’re, in fact, the best of friends.”</p><p>It’s Rio’s turn to chuckle. She can picture Jen’s horrified face perfectly.</p><p>And now that she thinks about it, Jen and Alice were actually meant to meet before, because of her. </p><p>That one time she had offered a friend to keep Jen company at the hospital when she was sick, though Jen had turned it down back then. Still, a shiver runs down her spine at the thought. </p><p>The universe really has a funny way of making sure the right people cross paths when they’re meant to, one way or another.</p><p>Rio then can’t help but think of Agatha. </p><p>What if she hadn’t lied and called in sick that day at Pride? Would she and Agatha still be where they are now, or would Rio have remained invisible to the woman she loves?</p><p>“Alright, enough about me and Alice! You didn’t come here to stare at us, right? You’re here to get ready for tonight,” Jen snaps Rio out of her thoughts. “Shower’s upstairs. It’s the third door on the right. Towels, toiletries, everything you need is there. Now go make yourself look semi-human before I change my mind about playing chauffeur twice in one day.” </p><p>Right. She’s finally seeing Agatha again tonight. And sure, Agatha doesn’t care much about appearances when it comes to Rio, but Rio isn’t about to skip putting in the effort to impress her.</p><p>Rio nods and starts toward the stairs, but before she can take another step, she spins back to Alice, points at her, and whispers.</p><p>“You and I have a lot to talk about. I want every single detail, Alice Wu-Gulliver. And yes, I mean all of it.”</p><p>Alice laughs. “Yeah, yeah, you’ll get the full story, okay? But only after you tell me yours. Now please scram before you give my girlfriend any more headaches.”</p><hr/><p>Rio is about to climb the stairs, bracing for the crowd of photographers waiting at the top, when she hears a car pull up behind her. </p><p>“Rio?” The familiar voice makes her heart skip a beat.</p><p>A strangely familiar rhythm she had felt the very second she laid eyes on Agatha that fateful day at Pride.</p><p>Only now does she realize it wasn’t panic she felt back then because of a lie, but the truth of recognizing someone she was always meant to meet. </p><p>She spins around, her gaze drawn to the most breathtaking sight she’s seen in months.</p><p>Oh god, she missed her.</p><p>“Agatha!” She almost bolts toward the latter, lightning-fast, but stops herself when she remembers they’re still outside, and the whole place is virtually swarming with cameras. </p><p>It takes everything she has not to cross that line, not to lean in and press her lips to hers, or worse, spin her around like she’s seeing the love of her life after decades, which, honestly, is exactly how it feels right now. </p><p>“Wow, you look…incredible. That color looks really great on you.” </p><p>She lets her eyes shamelessly wander over the dress. Its top is a corset designed to look like sculpted golden armor, blending seamlessly with a fitted black gown, one sleeve extending into a glove. </p><p>Agatha looks like a goddess, Rio thinks. The sort of goddess who could command a room with just a glance. And Rio can’t believe her luck that this goddess is looking at her with such loving eyes.</p><p>“Well, someone said darker colors highlight my eyes. And since this someone claims to be an expert on me, I figured I’d take their advice to heart,” Agatha quips and leans in for a peck on the cheek.</p><p>But Rio notices the way she holds it just a beat longer than she should. Then, as if realizing too where they are, she straightens and regards Rio with careful attention.</p><p>“I must say, you also look great tonight,” Agatha adds with a smile, and Rio’s heart squeezes as she realizes how much she has missed it. If she could only sweep this woman away right now, she would. “So, who’s behind this whole look? I’d never doubt your brilliance in writing and just about everything else, but I don’t think I could ever have the same confidence in your fashion choices.”</p><p>Rio chuckles, clicking her tongue against her cheek. </p><p>“I wouldn’t have much faith in me either,” she chaffs. “But lucky for me, Jen was kind enough to help out. She pulled this whole look together and even picked me up at the airport earlier.”</p><p>“Jennifer? Really now?” </p><p>“Oh, I didn’t believe it either, but she came to the airport, brought me back to her place, and arranged all this,” Rio tells her. Then, remembering something, she adds almost unconsciously, “By the way, do you happen to know if she’s seeing anyone?”</p><p>“When you say ‘someone,’ do you mean Alice?”</p><p>“You knew?” Rio gasps, eyes widening. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p><p>Agatha just stares at her. “Aside from the fact that I have zero interest in meddling in my employees’ love lives?” she says matter-of-factly, and Rio realizes she’s right. “It wasn’t my place to tell. Besides, I was also too busy dealing with my own hopeless infatuation to pay attention to anyone else’s.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks turn pink almost immediately, though a sly smile spreads across it. </p><p>“Oh really? And this so-called hopeless infatuation of yours, what does she do?”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but a chuckle escapes her lips. </p><p>“See, she’s a journalist. Practically brand new to the job, extremely talented and ambitious to a fault. As a matter of fact, she just dragged herself back from a brutal three-month assignment ten thousand miles away, which left me wondering if I should get used to it, though I can’t say I like the idea of being thirty-nine and still having a pen pal at my age.”</p><p>Rio laughs at the jab. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I’d say that overseas adventure has run its course. Being away that long must’ve made her realize where her heart really is, and that being so far from you isn’t something she could handle. I’m pretty sure she’d constantly be thinking about you and missing you terribly if she ever did it again.”</p><p>“She sounds awfully confident. Did she actually say all that?”</p><p>“She did. And I’ve never heard her so sure of anything.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curl into a smile, and Rio sees her eyes soften in that way she’s always loved. Her ‘How could I not love you?’ eyes. That’s what Rio has decided to call those eyes in her head. </p><p>Well, Rio couldn’t <em>not</em> love Agatha either. If  anything, she knows she can only love her more.</p><p>The rest of the evening goes even better than Rio had anticipated. She chats with a few editors and other writers. Some are still asking about her Stark article from months ago, others curious about her trip to Australia. </p><p>Most of the time, she and Agatha move through the room separately, but Rio can’t help catching glimpses of her every now and then. It’s not really that hard to spot a goddess in a crowd. </p><p>And when their eyes meet, even for a second, Rio just completely loses all grip on herself, no matter what she’s saying or to whom.</p><p>Perhaps it’s the jet lag, or maybe it’s just that Agatha isn’t exactly subtle in the way she’s looking at Rio: flattering her with soft eyes, and biting her lip. </p><p>Oh, this woman is killing her. They have to get out of here soon, or she’s liable to crumple right on the polished marble floor, with cameras and flashes closing in from every direction.</p><p>Fortunately, not long after, Agatha appears at her side. </p><p>“I think I’ve reached my limit for social niceties tonight, and being stuck here past midnight with this crowd is hardly appealing. How about we have our own little celebration somewhere else?”</p><p>Rio’s breath catches.<em> Fucking finally,</em> she thinks, pulse kicking up. </p><p>She tries to play it cool, but the eagerness is already written all over her face, and Agatha can probably see it plain as day. So she gives in, letting the truth slip out with a crooked smile.</p><p>“I’ve actually been waiting for you to say that,” she admits. “Since pretty much the second we walked in.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a chuckle, setting her flute onto the passing tray. </p><p>“Then I suppose we shouldn’t waste another minute.” She slips her phone from her clutch and dials. “Javier, would you mind bringing the car around to the front? Yes. Rio and I are leaving.”</p><p>Rio smiles before she can stop herself. <em>Rio and I.</em> She could absolutely get used to the sound of that.</p><hr/><p>She feels Agatha’s tongue trace her bottom lip and parts for her, hands sliding up to rest on her hips. She whimpers into her mouth as pressing closer, and in that instant, all the longing built up over months apart collapses into nothing but heat and need.</p><p>“I missed you. I really, really missed you,” Rio gasps as Agatha’s fingers thread through her hair, her palm warm at the nape of her neck. “I learned a lot from that trip, but I’d be lying if I said every second away from you didn’t feel like hell. So remind me never to pull that shit again.”</p><p>Too much for playing it cool. But no one could really blame Rio. Kissing Agatha always did this to her, made her shiver from the inside out, every nerve alive, every thought gone, leaving only a desperate, aching need for the woman.</p><p>Agatha’s other hand slides down Rio’s back, nails pressing into the thick fabric, and an involuntary groan escapes her before she even knows it. “Honey, I’d print it on every cover if I could.”</p><p>Rio chuckles, and it’s only when Agatha licks her now-swollen lips, eyes drifting downward, that she realizes the latter has somehow unbuttoned her blazer without her noticing. </p><p>Is Rio too lost to care? Absolutely. She’s with Agatha now, and that’s all that matters.</p><p>The flush on her cheeks deepens, turning even redder as Agatha’s hands slide over her shoulders. Rio feels her turtleneck lifted over her head, and in seconds she’s standing more exposed in just her bralette and pants, while Agatha remains perfectly poised in her elegant dress.</p><p>But before she can say anything, Agatha’s mouth claims her neck, and the sudden heat against her skin rips yet another gasp from her. Her teeth nip at the tender spot below her ear, her head tipping back as her hands claw at Agatha’s hips.</p><p>She barely has time to stifle another moan before Agatha’s tongue drags over the hollow of her throat. </p><p>Oh, Agatha is devouring her whole, body and soul.</p><p>“You look insane in this dress, by the way,” Rio breathes, already feeling how wet they’re both getting. Her fingers tremble slightly as they slide down to the hem of the fabric, bunching it up to cup the firm, round ass beneath. “I really love this on you. Maybe even one of my favorites. Though tonight, I’m thinking it’d look better on the floor. Can I please take it off you?”</p><p>She feels Agatha’s chuckle vibrate against her lips before pulling back just enough to look at her.</p><p>Rio blinks up, meeting stormy blue eyes, darker than midnight, staring straight at her. The hunger in them makes her blood pound. </p><p>“I don’t think I’ve said this before, but you being such a gentleman really turns me on.”</p><p>Hearing that, Rio wastes no time, guiding Agatha toward the bed. She works quickly on her corset and the zipper of her black dress, pulling off her glove and planting kisses along her arms as she goes. </p><p>In no time, they’re both naked, designer clothes scattered and forgotten across the floor.</p><p>Agatha’s hands slide up her torso and cup her breasts, making Rio go instantly weak in the knees, heat pooling low in her belly. </p><p>Three months apart has made her crave Agatha’s touch, remembering exactly what she can do. How she can make her shiver, tremble, and beg.</p><p>The memory of Agatha’s hands and mouth on her alone is enough to make her give in completely, right here, right now, if she chooses.</p><p>But her hands shoot up, gripping Agatha’s wrists just as her thumbs graze over her already hard, sensitive nipples.</p><p>A moan slips out of her before Agatha jerks slightly, worry immediately flashing across her face as her hands loosen their hold on hers. </p><p>“Why? What’s wrong?” </p><p>Rio regards her for a beat, and the mere brush of Agatha’s presence fills her with an instinct to bend, to serve, to make Agatha feel the full weight of her power over Rio, while also coaxing her to surrender to her.</p><p>“I just want to touch you first. Can I please be the one to touch you first?” she finally says, noticing Agatha’s dark eyes go wide and lips part as she nods. Then, as if driven by famished hunger, Agatha’s mouth finds hers again. </p><p>Oh, to hold this kind of power over someone so indomitable, and have her heart entirely in return. </p><p>She brings her hands up off the bed and runs them over the curves of Agatha’s thighs, tracing soft, gentle patterns. But before she can continue, Agatha breaks their kiss, poking Rio’s nose with her own. “Why don’t we make ourselves more comfortable? Scoot back and lean against the pillows, sweetheart.”</p><p>Her heart races as she slides back against the pillows. Agatha follows, crawling across the mattress with deliberate slowness. </p><p>Rio is so desperate for her touch that she’s tempted to tug Agatha toward her herself, but the other woman reaches her first, climbing up her legs and straddling her thigh.</p><p>Agatha lifts her hands, one resting on Rio’s shoulder for balance, the other cradling her cheek. “Now show me how much you want me,” she says, and Rio doesn’t hesitate. Her mouth moves down Agatha’s sternum, tracing the curve of her breasts before capturing a taut nipple between her lips.</p><p>Agatha presses herself harder against Rio’s thigh because of it, and Rio jerks back, catching her breath. </p><p>“Holy shit, baby, you’re so wet.” </p><p>She looks up at Agatha, her heart pounding, unable to think of anything except how utterly ravishing and unbelievably beautiful Agatha looks like this.</p><p>“That’s right, sweetheart. Keep looking at me like that,” Agatha commands, her voice also thick with need as she grinds even harder, both hands pressing firmly now on Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>Rio revels in the way Agatha throws her head back in pleasure, not even holding back as a loud moan slips free. Rio catches her breath again.</p><p>“I could never tire of this view if I’m being completely honest.”</p><p>But before she can say more, Agatha guides her head back to her nipples, and Rio complies, still keeping her eyes fixed on her.</p><p>It doesn’t take much for Agatha to switch into a different pace, her hips rolling with more intent, making it impossible for Rio to ignore the friction of her clit against her thigh.</p><p>She nudges upward, testing the movement, and Agatha responds with a startled gasp that sends a thrill rippling through Rio as well. </p><p>“Does that feel good?”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip, another low moan escaping. “Yes…so good, Rio. Just keep doing that. Don’t stop.” She grinds a little harder, letting herself get lost in the sensation.</p><p>Rio can’t take her eyes off Agatha. The way her chest rises and falls, the flush on her neck, the parting of her lips with every breath. It’s all so beautiful. </p><p>“You’re so perfect, Agatha. So goddamn perfect. I hope I’ve said that enough,” she tells her, pulling back temporarily from Agatha’s breasts to meet her eyes. </p><p>Her eyes are half-closed, but Rio can still see the aching need in them as she runs a hand through Rio’s hair, before bending close and tracing her tongue along the shell of Rio’s ear.</p><p>“Put your fingers inside me. I want to feel you when I come.”</p><p>Rio moans at the words as Agatha’s hand guides hers between her legs. She circles her fingers gently just above her clit and relishes the sound of Agatha’s soft cry. </p><p>“Jesus, Rio,” Agatha gasps, fisting her hand in Rio’s hair again. “Please.”</p><p>“Please, what?” </p><p>“Don’t make me repeat myself.”</p><p>But Rio grins endearingly, tilting her head. “Please, what baby?”</p><p>The sound of Agatha’s groan alone makes Rio feel like she could come just from it. </p><p>“Fuck me now. Please,” Agatha gasps, eyes squeezed shut, teeth catching her bottom lip.</p><p>She then lifts her hips a bit, and their eyes meet again. </p><p>It’s Rio’s turn to bite her lip, mesmerized by the way Agatha is looking at her. She submits instantly, letting herself fall under her control once more. “How many do you want?”</p><p>Agatha cups her face and instructs, “Two fingers first,” which Rio obeys instantly, as Agatha’s hands return to rest on Rio’s shoulders, gripping her firmly to brace herself. Rio’s fingers disappear into her warm, slick folds up to the first knuckle, and a shared groan escapes them both. </p><p>As Rio begins to pump her fingers, Agatha’s hands clamp tighter on her shoulders, pulling her close. Their foreheads press together, and Agatha’s eyes bore into hers as if she’s reading every thought Rio hasn’t even said. “God, I can't get enough of you. You feel so perfect, and you sound just as perfect.” </p><p>Rio has never heard anything more intoxicating than the soft cries escaping Agatha, and she struggles between leaning in to kiss her and letting her keep making those irresistible sounds.</p><p>“Why don’t you give me one more then,” Agatha breathes, almost on autopilot. Her eyes flutter shut as she leans into Rio, lips seeking hers while her hips begin to move faster. “Really glad you kept your word and came home with your fingers intact,” smiling against Rio’s mouth.</p><p>Rio feels as if she’s floating into another dimension as she buries her tongue in Agatha’s mouth and pushes her fingers deep inside her pulsing cunt.</p><p>Time seems to slip away, and she doesn’t even notice how long they’ve been like this until Agatha’s wetness really coats her fingers. All she knows is that she’ll never tire of this, and the thought of being apart from Agatha again is thoroughly unacceptable.</p><p>Feeling Agatha’s growing need, Rio adjusts her hand, letting her thumb find and rub Agatha’s clit. Rio continues her work until their lips part and a guttural moan tears from Agatha’s throat, making Rio’s pulse spike more urgently at how much Agatha is loving this. </p><p>“You like that, baby?” Rio says, not slowing even a bit. “You like how I feel inside you?”</p><p>Agatha presses down harder, wordless heaving moans and whimpers coming out of her parted mouth. “Yeah—oh god,” she eventually manages. “Fuck—yes, Rio, right there! Exactly like that, sweetheart. Don’t stop—fuck! Keep going, just like that.”</p><p>Rio follows what she’s told, pressing and circling her palm and thumb against Agatha’s swollen clit with every grind of her hips.</p><p>In return, Agatha’s moans grow louder, ragged and desperate each passing second. Rio knows she could never erase this from her mind, and the truth is, she wouldn’t want to. </p><p>She wouldn’t mind leaving this as an imprint she knows she’ll crave again and again.</p><p>Rio lowers her mouth again, lips pressing a dark mark into the soft curve of Agatha’s breast, fingers still moving relentlessly. “Fuck—look at you. You’re so fucking beautiful like this. Taking it all so damn well.”</p><p>“Fuck—yes. Oh god, Rio—fuck,” Agatha gasps, hips jerking. “I can't—I think I’m gonna come. I’m coming, Rio.”</p><p>“Go ahead, baby. You can come. Do it. I’m right here,” Rio urges, her own body thrumming with heat.</p><p>Within seconds, Agatha cries out, trembling over Rio’s hand as she comes hard and unrestrained, more wetness coating Rio’s fingers and trickling down her wrist. </p><p>Rio then strokes her thumb over Agatha’s clit slowly, much as she would herself, prolonging the aftershocks as Agatha continues to move her hips, sporadically thrusting against her.</p><p>They stay in that same position for a while, Rio’s own heart almost beating in sync with Agatha’s as she rests her head on her shoulder, their chests rising and falling together. </p><p>When Rio finally shakes off her own stupor, she lifts the hand that isn’t still between Agatha’s legs and gently strokes her back, pressing kisses to her bare shoulder.</p><p>“I really missed this. I really missed you,” she whispers, drawing a weak chuckle from the woman slumped against her.</p><p>“How many times do you think I have to hear that tonight?” she teases, then, catching the sincerity in Rio’s voice, she leans back just enough to meet her eyes. “Trust me, I’ve missed you far more than you have me.” She plants a quick, soft kiss on Rio’s lips before adding, “Come on, scoot a bit so we can lie down.”</p><p>Rio nods, easing her leg to free her hand from Agatha, who lets out a soft groan. She then slides down the bed just enough to lie back, and Agatha moves off her, stretching out onto her own back.</p><p>Rio then props herself on her elbow and takes a moment to drink in the sight of Agatha lying contentedly beside her, one arm draped over her eyes. </p><p>She glances at the small digital clock glowing soft blue on the bedside table, chuckling softly as she leans down to press a kiss to Agatha’s cheek, and Agatha’s eyes blink open to meet hers.</p><p>“Happy birthday, baby.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a sleepy laugh and squints toward the glowing digits, not quite catching them. </p><p>“Wait, what time is it?”</p><p>“Five past one,” Rio replies, idly combing her fingers through Agatha’s long dark hair fanned across the pillow. “Which means someone very special just turned a year older.”</p><p>A smile spreads across Agatha’s face just as Rio’s does, but Rio can see there’s something more there, as if Agatha is holding back words she wants to say.</p><p>“What is it?” she asks, immediately worried. Had she said something wrong?</p><p>Agatha lets out a slow breath and shakes her head. “It’s nothing.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio gently tilts her chin to meet her eyes again. “Tell me.”</p><p>Agatha presses her lips into a small, genuine smile and cups Rio’s face, brushing away the worry she sees there.</p><p>“I just—you could’ve changed your mind, you know, while you were away. Three months is more than enough time to rethink being in something this complicated, to decide this might even be too much, especially with me. You’re young, brilliant, funny, and very attractive, and you could have anyone you wanted. And yet, you still chose me. You really had the chance to think this over, but somehow you didn’t. And I know it sounds ridiculous, but I’m still trying to figure out why.”</p><p>Rio looks at her for a beat, and her heart immediately breaks at the thought that Agatha, someone so confident and self-assured, could ever doubt that anyone would choose to stay with her.</p><p>She tries to lighten the sudden heaviness by saying, “Ever heard of the old phrase, ‘Distance only makes the heart grow fonder’?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a soft laugh, as if Rio just said something endearingly foolish.</p><p>“Hey, I’m actually quite serious,” she continues, leaning closer, her fingers brushing Agatha’s hand. “Being away from you only made one thing clear for me, okay? How much I need you, how much I love you. So you don’t have to wonder about it anymore because it’s the truth. And to be perfectly honest, I don’t really care about anyone else. It’s you that I want. Even when I tried to convince myself otherwise, even when life got in the way, it’s always been you. I’d even steal the fucking stars for you if I could. That’s how far I’d go, how completely crazy I am for you. Because I’m so in love with you, Agatha Harkness. In every way, through everything. No matter what. I’m just hopelessly in love with you.”</p><p>She doesn’t break eye contact, pouring every ounce of herself into that look, even daring Agatha to look away, but now, she knows with certainty she never will.</p><p>“I mean, how could I not?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes immediately glisten with unshed tears, and Rio cups her face, gently brushing the corners to catch them before they fall. </p><p>“You really mean all that?” </p><p>“Every word, my love.” </p><p>Agatha’s lips curl into a soft, tender smile, and she cups Rio’s face in return. </p><p>“Say that again.”</p><p>Rio can’t help but grin, her adorable tooth gap peeking through. </p><p>“Say what again?”</p><p>Agatha taps Rio’s cheek once, a tiny blush spreading across her own face as she does.</p><p>“You know what I mean. Say it again.”</p><p>Rio’s smile falters into a quiver of joy, her eyes welling with tears as well. She studies Agatha’s blue eyes, the ones that once seemed unreadable, now clear, open, and boundless like the sea. </p><p>She loves Agatha, and she knows, without a shadow of doubt, that Agatha loves her just as deeply.</p><p>So she says it again, this time much more certain than the last. </p><p>“My love.”</p><p>“I like that.” Agatha nods, a gentle, sweet smile pulling at her lips. She then leans closer, pressing a soft meaningful kiss to Rio’s lips before resting her forehead against hers. “My love.”</p><p> And the words feel like home.</p><hr/><p><b><em>Two years later…</em></b></p><p><em>Some days don’t announce themselves as turning points. Most times they arrive dressed in ordinary light, and only later, sometimes in the familiar rhythm of a single heartbeat, do you realize they’ve altered the trajectory of your life.</em></p><p>That thought had settled in Rio’s mind when the storm outside their bedroom had yanked her awake. Rain had been hammering the city since the afternoon, and she had kept herself in a light, watchful half-sleep, her arm draped over Agatha protectively, ready to catch the nightmare before it could ever reach her.</p><p>Like most stormy nights since Agatha had asked Rio to move in, she finds the other woman still sleeping, calm and warm in the circle of her arms, as if the storm outside has long since lost its claim on her fears. </p><p>Most mornings, Rio swears she’d need a crowbar to separate them, Agatha’s bare body resting against her like a second blanket, one leg anchored across her hip. The sight always warms Rio’s heart, and she watches her like that until sleep pulls her under again.</p><p>A few hours later, Rio wakes again to the shy first rays of sunlight slipping through the drapes, stretching across the glass windows and spilling into their silly little pillow fort. </p><p>She almost laughs before her eyes are fully open. </p><p>The storm last night had pushed her into building it, and yes, despite Agatha insisting they should have just stayed on the bed, they had spent the entire night christening the fort in ways that still leave her cheeks flushed just thinking about it.</p><p>Well, at least the rain had finally stopped, just in time and perfectly in favor of what is about to go down in the streets today. Really, if the world hates the gays, then why the hell do the gays keep winning?</p><p>She carefully turns her head and finds Agatha still fast asleep, half-curled on top of her, palm pressed against her sternum, one leg draped over hers, effectively trapping Rio like a sun-warmed cat that refuses to move.</p><p>Some of her muscles, ones she didn’t even know she had, are starting to complain, and her arm is numb under her girlfriend’s neck, but she doesn’t care. There is no other way she would rather wake up than wrapped around Agatha, exactly like this.</p><p>Looking at Agatha, Rio can’t help but marvel at how the hell they ended up here, how quickly time has slipped by since that single turning point.</p><p>One harmless lie, one unexpected encounter at Pride, and somehow every road since has curved toward this sweet piece of their life that still feels so unreal.</p><p>Most days the house smelled of garlic and rosemary. Rio at the stove or the oven, Agatha leaning against the counter with a spoon in hand, tasting, learning, stubbornly trying to match Rio’s skill so she could cook when Rio disappeared into her writing. </p><p>It hadn’t taken long for their days to settle into an easy rhythm — Agatha taking calls while Rio typed on her laptop, both pausing now and then for quick kisses over steaming coffee. </p><p>Sunny Saturdays had often meant Marmee’s backyard, Fanny trotting after them through the garden.</p><p>Rainy Sundays had stayed slow and soft, the two of them wrapped in blankets, each with a different book until one had started to read aloud, or until the books had slipped aside and the rest of the day had been spent with Rio’s head buried between Agatha’s thighs or Agatha’s fingers coaxing moans from Rio, leaving them both craving more even hours later.</p><p>Career-wise, Rio can say they’re both thriving. </p><p>Well, Agatha always had, but now she’s reaching even greater heights as a new shareholder at Stark Publishing while still running Nocturne, with record-breaking numbers climbing each day. </p><p>Rio, meanwhile, has collected several awards for her writing and has just submitted another piece to her dream publication, set to be published this month, for those curious.</p><p>But no matter how high their careers had soared, Rio always loved coming home to Agatha’s townhouse, now overflowing with her own scattered plants, notebooks, and half finished coffee mugs. </p><p>The house, which they both now simply called theirs, had grown alongside them: more greenery than ever, photographs tucked into frames on every surface, each one a small fragment of their life together. </p><p>Rio’s favorite showed her sprawled on a sunbed with a book, Agatha curled on top of her, asleep — a snapshot from their week in Sicily, courtesy of Lilia. </p><p>While Agatha’s favorite captured Rio grinning from ear to ear, with Agatha holding a horrendous-looking but somehow delicious cake in front of her, Marmee and Lorna on either side, while the photo was snapped by Alice, who had also introduced Jen to her mom that same day.</p><p>And now, after nearly two years of keeping their love mostly to themselves, they were finally going to Pride openly, side by side for the world to see. </p><p>Just days earlier, Agatha had stood on the steps of the MET, facing the glare of cameras during a red carpet interview, and let everyone know she is in a devoted, loving relationship with a fearless, award-winning journalist (now a celebrated writer for Times Magazine) named Rio Vidal.</p><p>Rio still could hardly believe it, because now the world had finally caught up to what she had always known in her heart.</p><p>When Rio eventually makes a move to get up, Agatha presses her leg down harder and immediately slides her hand from the center of Rio’s chest to her waist, effectively pinning her in place. </p><p>“No,” she says, her voice still rough with sleep. “Stay right here.”</p><p>Rio tucks a stray lock behind Agatha’s ear. </p><p>“Baby, I was only getting up to make us coffee.”</p><p>“I don’t need it.” Agatha tightens her hold without opening her eyes.</p><p>Rio laughs under her breath.</p><p>“Says the woman who downs at least three cups before noon.”</p><p>Agatha only nuzzles closer to her neck.</p><p>“I don’t know who that woman is. All I know is that five more minutes of this beats a whole pot of coffee.”</p><p>Rio smiles even though Agatha’s eyes stay shut. </p><p>“Alright, my love, victory is yours, as always.”</p><p>“I do like it when you say that.” Agatha idly traces circles along Rio’s side, her voice still muffled against her neck. “Why are you even up so early? I thought we still had—” her eyes stay shut “—how many hours do we have, my love?”</p><p>Rio peeks out from their pillow fort at the clock. </p><p>“About four and a half.”</p><p>“Which clearly proves my point,” Agatha replies, snuggling even closer.</p><p>Rio trails a hand down her girlfriend’s spine. “But we still need to get the guest room ready. Billy and Eddie are coming over, remember? You promised them they could crash here tonight after the parade.”</p><p>“I did?” Agatha lets out a low grumble. “And why exactly did I agree to that again?”</p><p>“Because you, my love, also told them we’d pick them up from that Pride party they’re dying to go to with their friends. And that all started with you—” Rio presses a kiss to Agatha’s shoulder “—being a total pushover who melted at Billy’s sob story about never having been to a fancy party in this part of town.” </p><p>Agatha nuzzles deeper into Rio’s neck. “No, I didn’t fall for his sob story. I simply assumed they’d end up at the party anyway. Better he spends the night here than passed out on some random curb.”</p><p>Rio smiles, knowing Agatha has come to care for Billy just like she and Alice have. “Just admit it, that kid got to you too. Though I don’t blame you. I don’t know how he does it, but he does have a way of getting through even the meanest of lesbians.”</p><p>Agatha hums. “Well, I suppose the teen’s got a certain charm—” Then, catching the other words Rio said, she finally opens her eyes and raises her head to meet her girlfriend. “—wait, did you just call me the meanest of lesbians?”</p><p>Rio laughs and can’t help but reach for her girlfriend’s furrowed brows. </p><p>“No, no, my love. I said prettiest. I believe you’re far too beautiful to be the meanest.”</p><p>“I know that,” Agatha huffs, burying her head back in Rio’s neck. “And you smell the sweetest, it’s distracting.”</p><p>“Well, as much as I’d love to stay here and keep you distracted,” Rio says, nuzzling Agatha’s hair, “we really should start on the guest room.” That earns a muffled, irritated grumble. “And my back is starting to kill me,” Rio adds, adjusting herself atop the blanket pile sprawled across the hardwood floor.</p><p>“I thought someone your age was meant to have sturdier muscles,” Agatha teases, shifting her leg slightly to put less weight on Rio. “And I did suggest we move back to the bed last night. But no, you insisted we stay here. I don’t get what it is with you and hardwood floors.”</p><p>Rio laughs again, pressing their bodies closer. “I don’t have a thing with hardwood floors. I wanted us to stay here because the fort only keeps the storm out if we’re actually inside it. That’s literally why it’s called a fort, my love.”</p><p>“Well, I never needed a fort,” Agatha whispers, lifting her head to meet Rio’s eyes. “Because I know no storm could touch me with you here. You’re more than everything I need.”</p><p>Rio can’t stop smiling. “You really mean that?”</p><p>“With all my heart, my love.” </p><p>Rio blushes but doesn’t hide it. “Wow, you must really be in love with me or something.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs. “I guess I am…doesn’t exactly do my reputation any favors, though.”</p><p>Rio chuckles, and Agatha mirrors it with a much more meaningful smile, those luminous blue eyes just locked on her.</p><p>Then, more seriously, Rio repeats, “You really are in love with me, aren’t you?”</p><p>Aligning herself along Rio’s body, Agatha cups her cheek and presses a gentle kiss to Rio’s nose. </p><p>“Yes, my dearest darling Rio. I’m hopelessly, ridiculously in love with you.” She then places a much more heartfelt kiss on her lips, her eyes glistening almost immediately. “I mean, how could I not be? I simply fucking love you.”</p><p>Later, walking hand in hand through the streets of New York, the city alive with color and music, Agatha repeats the same words amid a sea of cheering faces and smiling strangers around them.</p><p>The world might have seen them publicly for the first time, but Rio had always known.</p><p>Every cheer, every colorful flag, every shout of love from the crowd felt as if it were meant just for them, a perfect reflection of the life they had built, now celebrated by everyone else.</p><p>And everything began with one simple heartbeat.</p><blockquote><p><b><em>She Stands Taller Than the World and I Fell for Every Inch</em></b></p><p><em>By Rio Vidal / Times Magazine</em></p><p>The first time I met Agatha Harkness, she regarded me like an intruder who had unwittingly wandered into her impenetrable fortress. And in many ways, I had. I had shown up in a wrinkled thrift-store blazer, ripped denim, a faded graphic tee, and the unearned confidence that only comes from wanting a job at a renowned magazine I barely understood. One I’d been told a million other girls would kill for. </p><p>Agatha, by contrast, carried herself with an authority that felt innate, a woman with steel in her spine and command in her presence. It was only natural that she would look at me and question how I had managed to slip past her gates.</p><p>On paper, she is the editor-in-chief who transformed a middling publication into a cultural barometer in a matter of years. In practice, she is more complex than her reputation suggests, more exacting than her rivals give her credit for, and, though she would deny it, infinitely more human than most assume.</p><p>Because behind the glass walls of her office, beneath the mythology that has grown around her, Agatha Harkness is something else entirely. </p><p>To write about her is to confront a conundrum. </p><p>She has been called intimidating, brilliant, difficult, visionary. And she is all of these things. Yet the other truth is that she is also vulnerable in ways the world is too impatient to notice. </p><p>To appreciate her work is to embrace her contradictions: a ruthlessness tempered by aching tenderness, a need for control that conceals a deep vulnerability. It would be easy to mistake her armor for her entirety, but that would be like calling a cathedral simply a building.</p><p>This is where the article should end in professionalism. But it is said that objectivity fractures in the face of honesty, and I have always believed that a great profile is built on revelation. Mine is simple: Agatha Harkness carries a devastating softness she will never ever admit. </p><p>She has the most disarming smile when, at last, she lets her guard down. She also cares in ways she would never acknowledge—the way she tucks your hair behind your ear when your hands are full, drapes a blanket over your shoulders while you’re writing late at night, or presses a coffee into your hand, knowing you haven’t slept for hours. </p><p>Sometimes, I catch her on her tallest tiptoes, in the way she rises to meet the demands of the world. And yet, even at her peak, there’s a fragility beneath the reach. A reminder that the highest of heights often demand the most courage. Watching her there, I understand why she seems untouchable, and why anyone who truly sees her is inescapably, irrevocably moved.</p><p>It fills me with pride to share this side of her with all of you, especially in a time like this, when we celebrate who we love and who we are. But I also know I’m breaking one of her cardinal rules, “Don’t romanticize me,” she once said before she agreed to this feature. </p><p>However, this isn’t romanticizing. This is simply me showing the world what I see. Especially after I’ve watched her wrestle with her own heart in silence, isolated in the in-between, haunted by the fear of wanting love in a world that has punished her for who she chooses to love.</p><p>I’ve seen her strength and vulnerability coexist in ways few ever get to witness, and I feel compelled to make that visible, to let people understand that behind the armor is a woman who deserves to be seen, understood, and adored exactly as she is.</p><p>Agatha would tell me to cut most of this section. She would remind me that a magazine feature is not the place for confession. Surely, she would hate this piece, accuse me of overindulging, of smuggling sentiment where objectivity should be. </p><p>And perhaps she’s right. But then again, journalism, at its best, is about truth. </p><p>And the truth is this:</p><p>I have never loved anyone the way I love Agatha.</p><p>And perhaps that is the most important story I’ll ever write…</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>like any of the other work under this pseudo, i didn’t expect this to get so much love, and wow…i didn’t think it would take me this long to finish either lmao. what started as a silly premise somehow turned into a complete rollercoaster of a story, with THIS agatha and rio taking up way too much space in my brain for the past four months. i poured every word i had into this, battled imposter syndrome the whole way, and now my brain is officially fried. but please know, im really grateful to everyone who sent love, shared their thoughts, and stuck with me all the way through this. i fucking love you all :))</p></blockquote>
