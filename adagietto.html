</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal knows lots of things about her wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She needs at least ninety minutes to be in a good mood every morning, prefers orange tic tacs to any other flavor or mint, loves beets, and hates Parsnips. She grew up eating such bland ‘New England’ food that even a little too much black pepper in a dish can get her sneezing. She prefers a bath to a shower, but only if she doesn’t have to wash her hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, in the past five months of marriage, Rio has found that there is so much left to learn about Agatha. Luckily, Rio’s appetite for all things Agatha is bottomless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>One of the more surprising new developments was Agatha’s desire to be legally married. Rio was perfectly content to have an exchange of rings and private vows. Neither of them are religious, and Rio didn’t want to have to involve Agatha in her taxes, which are horrific and years overdue. Rio’s waiting for the day the IRS comes to lock her up for improper filing. Rio had offered to draft a document with a lawyer splitting all of her assets with Agatha and put Agatha’s names on all of her bank accounts, but Agatha specifically wanted to be Mrs. Rio Vidal, name change and all. Rio was shocked, and more than happy to oblige. They had a small courthouse wedding back in June with Lilia and Billy as witnesses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Another surprising development was Agatha’s driving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the entirety of their relationship, Agatha had been a true passenger princess. Rio enjoys driving, so it was never an issue. Until Rio broke her foot, that is. They were on a hike and Agatha’s ass in her hiking shorts was simply too stunning for Rio to look away from. Because Rio was only looking at Agatha, she didn’t notice the stray branch on the path and stumbled, breaking her foot and rendering her unable to drive.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although Rio maintains that staring at Agatha’s ass was worth the injury, she has decided it was not worth putting up with Agatha’s driving for the entire summer. Agatha is somehow simultaneously the most aggressive and the most panicked driver Rio’s ever ridden with. She rides the break and refuses to listen to GPS. Rio’s physical therapist said Rio’s recovery was the quickest he’d ever seen and Rio credits that entirely to her needing to have her wife stop driving.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Something else that had surprised Rio was how serious her wife was about starting a family. By the end of the summer, Rio thought that she had convinced Agatha to wait until after she graduated to start looking into their options for family planning. Agatha had just turned twenty-six, and her summer fellowship ended with a signed job contract to be the conductor's assistant for the New York Phil the September after Agatha completes her doctorate. Rio was certain Agatha would want to wait and settle into her new position before adding a baby in the mix, but Agatha was adamant that she’d rather get started now and get to focus on having a newborn for a few months before even starting the new job.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>In typical Agatha fashion, this wasn’t explained to Rio. Instead, Rio found a series of appointments with fertility specialists in their shared Google calendar. Rio and Agatha were delighted when they got pregnant on their first round of IVF back in September.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>But, this afternoon on the Monday before Thanksgiving, Rio has made a brand new discovery in agathaology. Agatha is irrationally and irrevocably afraid of Geckos. Now that Agatha’s almost through the first trimester, her mood swings have calmed down considerably. A month ago, Agatha screaming out of the blue could be chalked up to blind hormonal rage, but in the past<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Weeks she’d mellowed. Or rather, Rio thinks, gone back to Agatha’s version of mellow. Which still includes more chaos and rage than anyone Rio had ever met, which is one of Rio’s favorite things about her wife.</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha are in Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving break for a belated wedding celebration and to introduce Agatha to Rio’s family. Rio rented out a beautiful Air and b on the beach and is just finishing hauling their luggage from the car rental into the casita when she hears a blood-curdling scream. She drops everything and rushes to Agatha. After seeing that her wife is not in mortal danger and that there is no sign of anything gone awry with the pregnancy, Rio takes in the entire scene in front of her. Agatha is standing on a kitchen chair, her face is blotchy and covered in tears, and she pointing a large kitchen knife at a very small gecko on the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t help but laugh at the sight and quickly finds that the knife is now being pointed at her. <em>Maybe the mood swings were more so on a temporary break than gone</em>, she thinks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart?” Rio asks in a calm voice “You okay?’ She continues, biting her tongue to keep from laughing at the absurdity of it all. Agatha, who has made grown men cry with a single mean look, is reduced to this all because of a sweet little Gecko in the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio? Do I look okay?’ Agatha grits out.</p><p> </p><p>“You know Geckos are non-poisonous, right? I had a pet gecko as a kid’ Rio continues, “her name was Lola”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sniffs and lowers the knife. ‘You voluntarily had one of these in the house? Is this part of the air b and b? Is it a cultural thing I’m just not getting?’</p><p> </p><p>“I was just really into reptiles and bugs as a kid” Rio smiles “When I was ten I snuck an iguana into a Phil rehearsal in a briefcase. It almost ended my career then and there”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I was not into reptiles and bugs as a kid and am certainly not into them as an adult” Agatha snarks.</p><p> </p><p>She stares the gecko down, and Rio thinks it’s the most adorable thing she’s ever seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio calmly approaches the gecko, and quickly shoots her hands out, capturing it. She releases it out onto the veranda. When she comes back to the kitchen, Agatha is seated at the table, and to Rio’s horror, is sobbing. Rio rushes to her wife and gathers her up from the chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It’s been a long day, cariño. Lots of traveling,’ Rio soothes, and Agatha snuffles into Rio’s shoulder, nodding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I used to be so much tougher.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re still plenty tough, darling.” Rio soothes, taking her wife’s hand and leading her to the bedroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Let’s just lay down for a minute, hm?” Rio asks, and Agatha nods and begins to undress. Rio can’t help but stare as her wife takes off the simple tee-shirt dress she was wearing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s always been obsessed with Agatha’s body and loves seeing the small changes that have come so far with the pregnancy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At twelve weeks, Agatha’s stomach is not quite flat anymore. The smallest hint of a bump is just beginning to show. Someone who doesn’t spend hours a day thinking about Agatha's body might not even notice how her usually toned stomach now slightly paunches out. But, Rio certainly has noticed and is enamored with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Stop staring, you freak.” Agatha blushes under Rio’s gaze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You’re so beautiful that it literally hurts to look away”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re just obsessed with my tits now that they’ve doubled in size”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart, I’m obsessed with all of you,” Rio tells Agatha fervently. Agatha, dropping onto the bed, finally cracks a small smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Come lay with me?” Agatha asks sweetly, and Rio quickly sheds off her clothes and gets into the bed, wrapping her arms around Agatha. She turns to face her wife and kisses her chastely on the lips. Agatha’s interest in sex has diminished since the pregnancy, and Rio doesn’t want to pressure her. Instead of snuggling into Rio after the kiss, Agatha lets out a loud frustrated groan. Rio pulls away, looking at her wife quizzically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Anything you want to put into words?” Rio asks teasingly, and as soon as the words are out, she wishes she could suck them back in. Agatha is looking at her as though she’s planning a murder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio tries again, “How can I help you feel better, love?</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t touch me anymore,” Agatha cries out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Darling, I’m touching you right now” Rio laughs and Agatha lets out a sharp sigh of exasperation.</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Agatha grumbles, “That’s not what I mean.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio quickly realizes what her wife is saying, and curses herself for being so thick.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“How do you want me to be touching you?” She asks lowly, sneaking her hand underneath Agatha’s panties and making contact with sticky curls. Rio feels breathless and suddenly needs to taste Agatha, immediately. Agatha smacks Rio’s hand away from her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>‘I don’t want you to pity fuck me. I know you're not interested” Agatha says meekly and sounds on the verge of tears. Rio is shocked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What?” She sputters.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, we haven't had sex in two weeks.” Agatha cries. “And now you won’t even kiss me properly. I read about this happening. How pheromones change during pregnancy and attraction can change. I repulse you” Agatha sobs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio groans out. Agatha’s not always the most rational, but this is ridiculous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha” Rio cups her wife’s face with her hands, “that is the stupidest shit I have ever heard in my entire life.” Rio continues, “I haven’t been trying to get in your pants because you haven't been interested. Every time I touch your breasts you wince. When I kiss you, you feel nauseous. My love, I’ve been trying not to bother you” Rio exclaims hurriedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha glares at Rio, “Well I don’t feel nauseous now and my breasts have been feeling less sore for a week” She bites out, and Rio laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You think I don’t want you?” Rio shakes her head at Agatha, mystified, and Agatha nods.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Let me show you just how much I want you,” Rio says and takes Agatha’s hand and pulls it so it’s touching against the wet cotton of her underwear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Do you feel that?” Rio asks lowly and Agatha blinks, surprised.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I want you so badly that I’m leaking, cariño” Rio pants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I suppose I could help,” Agatha says testily, climbing on top of Rio,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Rio feels relieved that her wife is back to her old antics.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I need you” Rio whimpers softly, and Agatha just nods her head, and slips a testing finger into Rio’s underwear. Rio sees stars.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“So wet for me” Agatha purrs, and Rio nods, groaning lowly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I want you inside me,” Rio begs, and Agatha grins widely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“That can be arranged.” Agatha, says, gliding a finger through Rio’s wet folds and stopping at the bud of Rio’s clitoris. Agatha holds her finger against Rio’s sharp peak unmoving, and Rio begins to thrust her hips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Please, cariño” Rio begs, “I need you to fuck me”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs lowly in the back of her throat. “You’re so pretty when you beg for me, baby. You almost never want me inside.” Agatha looks tenderly at Rio. “Why is today different?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whines as Agatha starts to trace little circles around her clit. Rio gasps, as Agatha touches her in just the right way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I need you to know what you’re doing to me” Rio pants out. “I want you to feel me come all over your fingers. I know how worked up it will get you.” Rio shudders as Agatha slips two fingers inside of her and starts thrusting. Rio sees the way Agatha is clenching her thighs together, desperate for friction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You’re greedy and impatient, my love,” Rio tells Agatha. “Making you feel me and wait will just make you all the more desperate” Rio feels her peak coming as Agatha pumps into her harder and faster.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I want,” Rio is cut off by a moan she can’t control, “I want you to know what you do to me, and then I want to fuck you until you forget your own name.” Agatha lets out a whine at that and the sound takes Rio over the edge. She comes quickly and flips Agatha over, pouncing on her. Agatha lets out a squeal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“So mean to the mother of your child.” Agatha laughs, and Rio lowers herself down Agatha’s body, spreading a hand tenderly over her tiny bump, and nips at her hip.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a fistful of Rio’s hair and uses it to redirect her face first into her cunt. Rio moans and licks a long stripe through Agatha’s entire sex. Rio gives teasing light kisses to Agatha’s cunt everywhere except the place she knows her wife wants most. Agatha is practically vibrating.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What do you need, sweet girl?” Rio asks tenderly and Agatha bites down on her bottom lip.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to touch myself as I watch you put on the strap, and then you’re going to take me from behind.” Agatha orders and Rio practically leaps off the bed to unpack the strap. Once it’s on, she sees that Agatha is waiting for her on all fours. Rio comes over and teasingly brushes the strap through Agatha’s wetness. She then plunges into Agatha setting a steady rhythm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Instead of a cry or a pant or another of the telltale signs that she's going to cum, Agatha begins to chant quietly, “No, no no no”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio slips out of her immediately, moving to get a look at her wife's face to see what's wrong. As she does this, Agatha scurries off the bed and makes a beeline for the bathroom, retching.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio follows, the strap still attached, and holds back her wive’s hair. When Agatha is done, Rio gets her a glass of water and tucks her into the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My poor little love,” Rio tells Agatha softly, brushing a strand of hair from Agatha’s face. Agatha blinks slowly, curling into Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>‘M sorry” she mumbles, and Rio can tell she’s on the edge of sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You’re my hero” Rio whispers and kisses Agatha on the forehead. “My abuela might be able to help with the nausea if you’re okay telling her about the baby when you meet her tomorrow,” Rio says, stroking Agatha’s hair. “She’s kind of a witch”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, “I’ll try anything at this point.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, humming, and Agatha yawns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“We should probably start telling people anyway,” Agatha murmurs sleepily. “I don’t want people to think I’m just getting fat.” She says seriously, and Rio laughs softly and hopes her wife doesn't hear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio is watching Agatha finish frosting Jen’s birthday cake when she fully processes how unexpectedly domestic and lovely life has become. If you told Rio back in October that Agatha would happily go to Jen’s birthday party and even make the cake, Rio would have said that you clearly don't know Agatha very well; Agatha can’t stand Jen and has never baked in her life. But now it’s February, and Rio is amazed at how much has changed in just a few short months. Agatha is six months pregnant, finished with her doctoral thesis, begrudgingly fond of Jen, and has been taking cooking classes. Rio truly believes that anything is possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio should have anticipated that it would only take Agatha a couple of months to write her thesis. After all her wife is a genius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, Rio was nevertheless surprised when Agatha finished the last draft of her thesis at the end of the fall quarter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Due to, in Agatha’s words, ‘<em>some archaic academic bullshit,’ </em>Agatha is neither allowed to participate in coursework until her thesis is defended nor to defend her thesis until the spring quarter. So, without a thesis to write or an orchestra to conduct, Agatha has a full ten weeks of what Rio has deemed ‘funemployment’. Agatha has been extremely bored and adorably restless.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s first solution to Agatha’s boredom was to get her wife something to occupy her time with when Rio is teaching. This is how Scratchy came into their lives. Rio brought home the three-legged Tabby after the first day she went to campus without Agatha. Agatha and Scratch have been inseparable ever since. Rio knows that shelter cats can sometimes take time to get used to new environments, but Scratchy warmed up to life in their cabin immediately. It might help that Agatha spent that first night feeding him roast chicken off her own dinner plate with her hands and insisted that he slept in bed with them. Now Scratchy follows Agatha around the house like a baby duckling. It is decidedly not cat-like, and Rio is only a tiny bit jealous of all the time the cat gets to spend with her wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Predictably, a cat in the house was not enough mental stimulation to cure Agatha of her life’s new monotony, which is why Agatha begrudgingly became friends with Jen. Agatha was visiting campus during Rio’s lunch break, and Rio had a class run-over. Jen saw Agatha waiting for Rio in the faculty lounge and struck up a conversation. Agatha was amazed to learn that outside of rehearsal and when not talking about skin care, Jen is an interesting and intelligent person.</p><p> </p><p>Now, Jen and Agatha go on weekly walks. Rio is thrilled, as this new friendship means they also get to do game nights with Jen and Alice. Agatha is extraordinarily competitive, but it's okay because she always wins. And if Rio is helping her wife cheat at Catan, Jen, and Alice are none the wiser.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alongside cat motherhood and Jen-friendship, Agatha has been enjoying prenatal yoga classes, memorizing Bach’s Goldberg variations, and taking cooking lessons. Rio has never seen her wife so relaxed and couldn’t be happier.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio sneaks up behind Agatha while Agatha is covering the cake with foil. Rio moves Agatha’s hair away from her shoulder and gives an open-mouthed kiss to her neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Hi, love.” Agatha smiles at Rio and turns to face her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, my lady.” Rio kisses Agatha’s lips and sweetly places a hand on Agatha’s bump.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br/></span> “And hello, my baby,” Rio greets. </p><p> </p><p>The baby is about the size of a small cabbage, and Agatha’s carrying high. Her belly button is now fully popped out, and it’s Rio’s favorite thing to look at. Agatha’s wearing her silk robe with nothing underneath, its string just barely long enough to close the fabric around her belly. Rio takes a mental note to buy Agatha a bigger robe this week when she feels a familiar thump against her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“He’s saying hi to Mami” Agatha grins at Rio, angling her face up for Rio to kiss again. Rio obliges of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“He recognizes my voice,” Rio excitedly tells Agatha, “I was reading that this is the week when little dude starts to hear sounds outside of your body.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, “You know how I feel about ‘<em>little dude’</em>”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I thought you liked it more than Mr. Peanut?” Rio asks</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Peanut was definitely worse, but not by much.” Agatha purses her lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio junior, then”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pauses, “I don’t hate that”</p><p> </p><p>Rio barks out a laugh, “Oh my god, I was joking!” She grins. Rio feels another kick against her palm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“He agrees. Not Rio junior,” She tells Agatha sternly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I don't know”, Agatha wears a shit-eating grin, “I think that was him saying he’d love to be named after <em>Daddy.” </em>She smirks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio suddenly feels ten degrees hotter. Agatha smirks, knowing exactly what she’s done. Rio backs Agatha up against their lower cabinets and then sinks to her knees in front of her wife. She tugs at the string of Agatha’s robe and undoes the loose knot. Agatha is bare in front of her, and panting. Rio kisses her wife's inner thigh, and she can smell Agatha’s arousal. Agatha scratches at Rio’s scalp and whines. She’s been insatiable this past week.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Please, my love” Agatha begs, and Rio quickly darts out her tongue to taste her wife. It’s salty and sour and purely Agatha and Rio wants to drown in it. She makes sure Agatha is balanced against the counter and then swings Agatha’s leg over her shoulder. It’s a little awkward because of the belly, but when Agatha grinds her cunt into Rio’s nose, it is very much worth it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Wanna fuck you with my tongue” Rio mumbles into Agatha’s pussy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Anything you want. I just need you, only you, all of you” Agatha babbles, already close to the edge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio stiffens her tongue and fucks Agatha with it until she feels it get tired, then she sucks on Agatha’s clit, hard. A gush of water squirts out of Agatha onto Rio’s shirt and Agatha chokes out her name. Agatha leans against the counter, breathing hard. Rio gets up and wraps her wife in a hug.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” she tells Agatha reverently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Thank <em>you,</em>” Agatha breathes out. “Are you sure we have to go to this party? Can’t we just take a bath together and cuddle up on the couch tonight?” Agatha pouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio bites her lip, seriously considering. “Let’s get changed, head over early, and leave the party after just half an hour?” Rio compromises.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Fine” Agatha sighs, “I’m going to need a reward for being so good, then”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles prettily at her wife, “You were going to get one anyway” she winks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio puts an arm around her wife’s waist as they wait to be buzzed into Jen and Alice’s apartment. When the buzzer goes off, Rio tries to steal the cake Agatha is holding out of her hands. Agatha sidesteps Rio, still holding the cake, and starts to make her way up the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio breathes out, wondering if this fight is worth having. A mental image of Agatha crumpled at the bottom of the stairs flashes through her mind, and Rio decides to speak her mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Darling, please let me carry the cake. I want you to be able to use the railing if you need.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, “Excuse me?” She turns and looks at Rio venomously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It’s a lot of stairs.’ Rio shrugs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You think I need to hold onto the railing to get up one flight of stairs, Rio?” Agatha asks, offended.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses, knowing she’s hit a nerve and that she’s married to the most stubborn woman on the face of the earth. “Yes,” Rio says meekly and suddenly feels a little bit scared of her wife. “Just because of the extra weight-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is interrupted by Alice, who comes rushing down the stairs. “Hey, Guys!” Alice cheerfully shouts out. “Let me help you with the cake!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha immediately hands the cake over to Alice and smiles sweetly. “Thank you, Alice. You have impeccable timing. You just saved Rio from digging her own grave.” Agatha tells Alice, scowling at Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio continues her argument from earlier, trying to defend herself. “Extra weight of the-”</p><p> </p><p>“Woah, dude,” Alice stops Rio. “Are you about to say something about your pregnant wife’s weight?” Alice asks, looking at Rio with a horrified expression.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio groans. “Weight of the CAKE”. I thought Agatha might need to use the railing on the stairs if she was carrying the extra weight of the cake, so I was trying to get her to let me take the cake up.” Rio quickly explains, exasperated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It was very considerate of you to come and grab the cake, Alice” Agatha says ignoring Rio. Alice looks nervously between Rio and Agatha. When Agatha does pause halfway up the stairs and grabs the railing, Rio doesn’t say a thing, just places a supportive hand on her wife’s lower back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen and Alice’s apartment is cozy and charming. It has hardwood floors, and the walls are painted a soft millennial pink. They have floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, and a vibrant bright blue velvet sectional in their living room. The apartment is full of balloons, and Jen and Lilia are chatting animatedly in the kitchen as Rio, Agatha, and Alice come in.</p><p>“Agatha the baker!” Jen greets with a smile and goes to take Rio and Agatha’s coats.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br/><br/></span></p><p>“Happy birthday, Jen!” Rio greets cheerfully, “This cake is going to be out of this world. Agatha’s baking is almost as incredible as her conducting.” Rio brags and Agatha rolls her eyes but smiles and grabs Rio’s hand. Rio feels happiness unfurl in her chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“And how’s my baby?” Lilia asks smiling, getting up from the couch to say hello to Rio and Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m excellent!” Rio replies happily, and Agatha dissolves into laughter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I think she means the literal baby, baby” Agatha whispers, and looks lovingly up at Rio. Rio flushes red, and Agatha gives her a quick peck on the cheek.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My lovebirds!” Lilia coos. “Rio, you’ll always be my baby,” Lilia promises, squeezing Rio’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“The <em>new</em> baby is also excellent” Rio grins goofily at Lilia. “Did you get the picture I sent you of our last sonogram, where he was sucking his thumb?” Rio asks excitedly</p><p> </p><p>“She printed it out and even made us a copy, too” Alice chimes in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What else would a proud <em>nonna</em> do?” Lilia laughs.</p><p>“And Agatha, you look good enough to eat. You’re glowing.” Lilia sings, and Rio can’t help but agree.</p><p>Agatha is wearing a light purple sweater underneath denim overalls that gently hug her belly. Her hair is flowing loose down her back. Rio can’t help but admire the new fullness of Agatha’s cheeks and the subtle softening of her hips. Strong, beautiful Agatha, radiant and round. Rio almost wishes she could freeze time just so she could spend an eternity looking at her gorgeous wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha preens at Lilia’s compliment and rests a gentle hand on her bump, Rio’s heart does a little flip at the sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Your skin does look fantastic,” Jen tells Agatha. “Have you been using the night cream I gave you?” She asks. Rio and Agatha have both been using the night cream religiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha ignores Jen and smiles mischievously at Lilia. “What did you cook for me?” She asks Lilia with a twinkle in her eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen scoffs, “For <em>you</em>? Agatha, it’s my birthday” Jen points out testily and Alice goes over and takes her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I made us all Penna vodka and chicken parmesan,” Lilia answers diplomatically. Agatha looks questioningly at Rio raising her eyebrows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Penne vodka is Rio Junior’s favorite food. My poor wife listened to me wax poetic about it all morning,” Agatha tells Lilia, eyeing Rio suspiciously<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I told you she was psychic, cariño,” Rio says, even though she fully texted Lilia this afternoon asking her to make the dish for her wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen scrunches her nose in distaste, “You guys aren't serious about Rio Junior, right?</p><p> </p><p>Rio says “no” but it’s at the same time Agatha says “deathly”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Their plates are all clean, and Rio has been ready to leave the party for about an hour when Lilia brings up the possibility of Rio giving a faculty recital again. Lilia brings it up about once a year, and Rio always turns her down. Well, except for the year Lilia let her sing, but nobody seems to ever want to talk about that. (Rio got a very stern letter from the dean after, criticizing her for ‘making a fool’ out of the music department. Rio doesn't think she was that bad). This year, Lilia tries to get Agatha to join her cause.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia sighs out, “Agatha, will you please convince your wife to do a faculty recital this quarter? A Rio Vidal recital would sell enough tickets to fund an entire season for the opera department” Lilia implores.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, and Rio is taken aback by the sentimental look on her wife’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I want it as badly as you do, Lilia. I love getting to hear her,” Agatha says sweetly, “I miss it. I live with the best violinist of the modern age, and she won’t even play for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pouts and then goes for the cheap shot. “And, with the baby being able to hear outside the womb now, I thought Rio would start playing again. Classical music is so good for brain development. But you know as well as I do how stubborn Rio is” Agatha sighs, batting her eyelashes at Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Fine. yes. I’ll do it.” Rio says hurriedly. She forgot how manipulative Agatha can be,<em> Christ.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p> </p><p>“Really?” Lilia asks, astounded.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t realize Agatha wanted me playing so badly,” Rio grumbles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha blushes, not used to being so forthright with her desires. “For the baby. Brain development and whatnot,” She excuses.</p><p> </p><p>Jen laughs, “This baby is inadvertently going to fund a choir tour.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia beams. “Agatha will be your accompanist.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a startled laugh. “I don’t play piano publically, anymore, Lilia. Playing for a voice lesson or accompanying a choir rehearsal is one thing, but I can’t do a concert.” She reasons.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio takes Agatha’s hands in her own. “Please, please, please, please, please, please, please,” She begs. “If you play with me, this will actually be fun.” Rio insists. Agatha looks at Rio anxiously, and Rio can practically hear Agatha telepathically telling her to drop the subject.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Come on, Agatha, you’re about to have a baby. It’s time to heal your own motherwound,” Lilia says sternly, and Rio frowns at Lilia’s bluntness. Agatha is at a loss for words.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tries a gentler method; Enticing her wife with music she knows she can’t resist. “We’ll do the Mozart sonatas, and I’ll sing Brahm’s <em>Sapphische ode, </em>and I’ll even write us something new” Rio promises.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You sing?” Agatha asks, beaming.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No!” Lilia, Jen, and Alice emphatically respond.</p><p> </p><p>“That aside, Look at your family band! It’s giving the Von Trapps” Jen jokes.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m too young to understand that reference,” Agatha lies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lilia makes a few phone calls, and the Rio Vidal faculty recital is in the books with Agatha Vidal as her collaborative pianist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Rio wasn’t expecting to feel nervous the morning of Agatha’s thesis defense, but she wakes up with her stomach in knots. She opens her eyes and blearily reaches for her phone, seeing it’s only six in the morning. Agatha is soundly asleep next to her, snoring softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio loves the sound. Agatha never snored before the pregnancy and is adamant that she still doesn't snore, insisting that Rio was trying to get a rise out of her when Rio teasingly brought it up. Rio finds the sound soothing and hopes that Agatha will still snore after the baby comes. Agatha is curled into her pregnancy pillow, and Rio thinks about shifting the pillow and snuggling up into her wife, but she doesn’t want to disturb Agatha's rest. Rio leaves the pillow and Agatha as they are.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When Rio first brought the pregnancy pillow home, Agatha scoffed, claiming that pregnant people don’t need special pillows and that Rio had fallen victim to some clever marketing. That was fair, Rio <em>did</em> buy it off of Instagram. But, now that Agatha is thirty-eight weeks pregnant, she can only get comfortable enough to sleep if she’s using the pillow, and Rio’s number one priority is Agatha’s comfort. Especially with Agatha at the stage in her pregnancy where she is so rarely comfortable. This past week, the baby has dropped, and Agatha is now waddling, always needs to pee, and is fed up with being pregnant. Rio is certain that the baby will be here before they know it. She’s pulled away from her thoughts when Agatha shifts and starts to get up, groaning slightly with the effort. Rio smiles at the sound, knowing better than to laugh at her wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Good morning” Rio chirps, getting up and walking to Agatha’s side of the bed to help her up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha is now sitting but gratefully accepts Rio’s extended hand to get off the bed, “On three?” She asks sleepily, and Rio chuckles under her breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“One, two, three,” Rio counts softly, and Agatha lets Rio pull her onto her feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“How are you feeling, pretty girl?” Rio asks, watching Agatha support her lower back with her hands and frown slightly,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Like I narrowly avoided wetting the bed”. Agatha quips and rushes (it’s more of a speed-waddle if Rio’s being honest) to the bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Today's the day!” Rio shouts out to Agatha, sitting on their bed, waiting for her to come back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, “I mean we are technically at full term, but you know today’s not the due date, my love. What makes you say it is?” Agatha asks as she pees.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grins at Agatha as she comes back into the bedroom, “Sweetheart, today is the day of your thesis defense. Baby needs to keep cooking for two more weeks, no?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha whines “Rio, if I’m still pregnant in two weeks, I’ll be too big to do anything. I’ll be completely immobile.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha groans, and Rio snorts out a laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“The perfect excuse to wait on you hand and foot” Rio smirks</p><p> </p><p>“You do that anyway,” Agatha tells her, waving a hand dismissively.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio makes a soft humming noise. “Do you want to get a couple more hours of sleep before we head to campus?” She asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“There’s no way I’ll get back up today if I lie down again,” Agatha pouts and scratches gently at her bump, “also, your son is very much awake and hungry,” She informs Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles at Agatha, “What do you say I take you two out breakfast then?” She asks, knowing that Agatha will never turn down Westview Diner’s pancakes and hashbrowns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Taking me out on the town on a Tuesday, well don’t I feel special?” Agatha teases Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, “Happy wife, happy life.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio holds Agatha’s hand as she leads her into the Diner. They’re not quite regulars, but the little old woman running the place always asks about the baby when they come in, and even sent them home with free cake the last time they came in for supper.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Table for two?” Rio asks as they enter.</p><p> </p><p>“Not for long” the woman grins, grabbing two menus and leading them toward a corner table. “He dropped,” she says, pointing at Agatha’s stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Two more weeks,” Rio says excitedly as Agatha looks at the woman vaguely annoyed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The woman looks straight at Agatha, “End of this week, tops. I have a sense.” She says. She comes back with Agatha’s chocolate chip pancakes with a side of hashbrowns and scrambled eggs with a side of bacon for Rio before they even have a chance to order.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“So how are you feeling about your thesis defense?” Rio asks Agatha as she polishes off the pancakes. “You look calm,” She tells her.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda already told me I passed”, Agatha states casually, stealing a piece of bacon off Rio’s plate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“The committee loved my dissertation. Aparentally today is just a formality. Wanda was worried about causing me stress this far into the pregnancy so she told me a couple of weeks ago. I just have to show up today.” Agatha says with a flourish of her hand. Rio is gobsmacked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“And you didn’t mention it to your wife?” Rio asks, astounded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I didn't realize you were worried,” Agatha says, confused. “What, you thought I wouldn’t pass?” She laughs disbelievingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No! No!” Rio assures. “I just thought you might be feeling nervous. The whole reason I don’t have a doctorate is because I never wanted to defend a thesis.” Rio tells Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts a laugh, “And you didn’t need one to teach. Your name gets you through the door, love”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio rolls her eyes. “But seriously, I couldn’t be prouder to be Mrs. Doctor Vidal,” Rio says and feels the prickle of a stray tear at her eye. She wipes it away quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My big softie” Agatha coos, taking Rio’s hand and kissing it. “The defense is the last thing I need to do on campus. After today, I’ll be officially done at Westview University” Agatha muses.</p><p> </p><p>Rio clicks her tongue and smiles, “I think you're forgetting something important” she says coyly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha responds trying to shut down the conversation. Rio wouldn’t call this topic a fight, but she knows that it’s not<em> not </em>a fight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Cariño, you can’t skip your graduation.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, I have two higher ed degrees already and have never walked at a graduation before. I have no desire to walk at one now,” Agatha says tartly and puts a soothing hand on her belly. Rio knows the baby can sense when Agatha gets heated and will give her a few kicks when it happens. Rio thinks it’s the baby’s way of telling Agatha to calm down, but Agatha is convinced it’s the baby agreeing with her, tacking on an exclamation point to whatever she’s feeling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio moves on. “Also, you don’t have to, but I’d love for you to come to the music department fundraising gala this weekend. Lilia says I need to be there, and it will be a lot more bearable if you’re with me. I went a few years ago, and the food was pretty good.” She gives Agatha a pleading look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha pauses, confused. “I thought students weren’t invited to that. Because of the open bar?”</p><p> </p><p>“I get a plus one, and you’re my wife. Also, it’s black tie, so you’d get to see me in my tux” Rio grins rogueishly.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio” Agatha sighs, “What would I even wear to a black tie event? None of my formal wear fits.” She grouses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio grins, “I might’ve taken the liberty of picking something up for you the other day”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks intrigued, “When did you even go shopping?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looks genuinely confused, “when you weren’t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>teaching you’ve been by my side all week.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks sheepish, “Okay, Lilia picked it up, but she sent me pictures and I made the final call.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, so you’re all conspiring behind my back, that’s it?” Agatha jokes. Rio reaches across the table and laces her fingers with her wife’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It’s hanging in your closet,” Rio explains, suddenly shy, “I think you’ll love it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles indulgently at Rio, “Tell you what, if I’m still pregnant on Saturday I’ll go with you. How’s that sound?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles wide, “If you’re not still pregnant that means we have a newborn and neither one of us has to go”</p><p> </p><p>“You know, sex can trigger labor,” Agatha says lowly and winks. Rio feels a rush of heat between her legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>On Saturday Rio spends the day enjoying the temperate late April weather tending to her garden, and Agatha spends it watching Rio from their screened-in porch with Scratchy nestled into her side. When Rio finishes, Agatha is wrapped in a blanket and dozing lightly on an Adirondack chair, still in her pajama set, even though it’s nearly four in the afternoon. Rio feels a rush of love at the sight. She gently strokes Agatha’s hair and kisses her cheek to wake her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart, we should get ready for the gala,” She says gently</p><p> </p><p>“Rio” Agatha blinks slightly breathlessly. “I just had the most realistic dream” Rio notices that Agatha’s pupils are blown wide, and she looks a little flushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Darling, are you feeling okay?” Rio asks, putting the back of her hand against her wife’s forehead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, “The dream got me a little worked up, is all,” she humms, stretching her arms out languidly and smiling slowly. I’m okay, we’re okay,” She clarifies, placing a protective hand on her belly. Rio sits on the arm of Agatha’s chair, brushes the hair out of Agatha’s face, and kisses her. To her surprise Agatha opens her mouth immediately, inviting Rio to deepen the kiss. Rio licks into Agatha’s mouth, and Agatha whimpers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Baby” Agatha whines. The neediness in Agatha’s voice makes Rio clench around nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Did my sweet girl have a dream about me?” Rio asks innocently, knowing the answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha whines again. “I need you” she blushes, and Rio’s mouth goes dry with want.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I dreamt about your strap, baby,” Agatha pants. “Will you put it on for me?” She asks sweetly, and Rio’s knees nearly buckle.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls Agatha up out of the chair and leads her into the bedroom. Once there, she leads Agatha to the bed and starts undressing her. Rio undoes each button on the top of Agatha’s pajamas slowly until her breasts and belly are bare. Agatha’s breasts are swollen, and the nipples are puffy. Agatha’s breasts sit heavily on her pendulous belly, and her skin is shiny from being stretched so taut. She has a few silvery stretch marks lining the underside of her stomach and hips, and her belly button sticks out like a little marble. Rio loves Agatha’s body so heavily pregnant and is almost sad that she won’t remain like this much longer. She shimmies down Agatha’s pajama pants and finds that her wife isn’t wearing and underwear. The curls on her sex are damp to the touch, and Rio parts Agatha’s swollen folds with a gentle finger and bends down to lick at her clitoris. Agatha starts mewling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Baby” Agatha cries, “Please”</p><p> </p><p>“Please, what? Sweet girl?” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I need you to suck on my tits” Agatha whines. Rio immediately complies and Agatha moans out as soon as her lips wrap around a sensitive nipple. Rio slips two fingers inside of Agatha and gently starts to fuck her. Rio bites down at Agatha’s swollen nipple and feels a rush of liquid enter her mouth. It’s creamy and sweet. Rio swallows it down greedily. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“My handsome boy,” Agatha coos and strokes Rio’s hair as she suckles. “You can have more, but only if you put on your strap for me,” Agatha breathes out, and Rio lets Agatha’s breast fall out of her mouth with a wet pop. She gets up,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>quickly puts on the harness, and goes back to Agatha, who is lying on her side, waiting. Rio slips behind Agatha and spoons her. She kisses her neck and rests one hand on her belly. She uses the other hand to guide the strap into Agatha and pumps into her slow and deep. Agatha stays comfortably as little spoon and lets Rio do all of the work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I love you” Rio whispers into the shell of Agatha’s ear, and Agatha comes at the words. Rio has never been happier. Agatha slowly maneuvers herself so she’s facing Rio again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m too big to be good at sex” Agatha mumbles sadly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I think you’re very good at sex” Rio grins.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I want to eat you out, but I think it would be too hard for me to position myself. Do you want to sit on my face?” Agatha asks, and Rio looks at her like she has two heads.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Cariño, it’s okay to be taken care of. I don’t need anything in return. Besides, we should get ready for the gala” Rio says and Agatha smiles lovingly at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They arrive at the gala just on time, and Rio is pleased to see that seating assignments have been made she and Agatha are at a table with Lilia, Alice, and Jen. Wanda and her very boring husband are also at the table, but Rio is content to ignore them. The dress Rio and Lilia picked for Agatha is perfect. It’s an A-line wrap dress in purple silk so deep it almost looks black, and Rio is in awe of how stunning her wife looks. Lilia has been introducing Agatha to donors for the past few minutes, and Rio has been instructed by the dean not to speak to anyone, so she hangs back. Agatha leaves Lilia and a donor and starts to come back to the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio immediately can tell something is off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart” Rio stands up to meet her, “Are you alright” she worries.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Nothing is wrong physically, but I want to go home now, please,” Agatha says softly, and Rio immediately ushers her out of the building, unused to seeing her wife so subdued.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Should we get you some ice cream?” Rio offers once they’re in the car, trying to cheer up her forlorn wife. Agatha doesn’t respond. Rio feels nervous. “Did I do something?” She asks</p><p> </p><p>“One of the donors Lilia wanted to introduce me to knew me when I was a kid,” Agatha tells Rio. Rio sucks in a breath, knowing that Agatha’s childhood was a minefield.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“He dated my mother for a couple of years, and he was always nice to me. She was nice to me when he was around, too” Agatha says in a small voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“He recognized me immediately. He was so happy to see me, and to hear that I’m married and he was so excited about the baby.” Agatha continues in a dry voice, “And then he started talking about how happy my mother must be to be getting a grandchild.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed. “Agatha, our baby is already so loved by so many people.” She says seriously. “Our baby doesn’t need your mother. You don't need your mother. We have a beautiful community who loves us and loves our child” Rio promises.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha stays silent for a moment and then speaks. “That’s not what I’m worried about”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks questioningly at her wife and waits for her to continue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My mother didn’t love me, Rio. What if I don’t know how to love? What if I can’t love our baby?” Agatha asks fervently and begins to cry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My love. You already love our baby so much. Your actions every day prove that. You’re building the family you deserve.” Rio insists.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What if it’s different when he’s here? What if I can’t?” Agatha sobs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio knows exactly how to fix this. “Do you love me?” Rio asks Agatha, with a small smile</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be an idiot of course I love you.”</p><p>“Then you know how to love, sweetheart,” Rio assures her. Agatha stops crying and sniffs. Rio continues, “And if you love me, how could you not love my baby, hm?” She teases.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“So full of yourself” Agatha replies haughtily but smiles brightly the entire ride home.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
