<div class="userstuff">
<p>In theory, it’s not impossible to find a person one could be fully compatible with.<br/>Everybody has their quirks; hopes, dreams, routines, preferences, values– and everybody should, in theory, be capable of finding someone whose quirks line up with theirs.<br/>Some people fit the norm, for whom it should be relatively easy to find their significant other– some people possess traits which make them part of a minority, considerably decreasing the pool to fish from when it comes to finding someone who shares or respects those traits– however, still, in theory completely possible.<br/><br/>Agatha considers herself to be dripping down the edge of any spectrum in existence, making her a lone speck on a graph about categories of dateable qualities. If the spectrum of good and evil is a straight line, Agatha runs around it in circles. If the spectrum of hobbies and interests is a sphere, Agatha sits inside a locked square. If the spectrum of love languages is a five-point circular chart, Agatha is stuck to the back of it like a lizard to a wall. And if the spectrum of wants, needs, and desires is some unidentifiable, impossible to perceive, multi-dimensional concept, Agatha is a very clear shape, shifting into something else completely when being looked at.<br/><br/>She wouldn’t have it any other way. If one of her worst fears had to come true one day, she would wake up feeling <em> normal. </em> <em><br/></em> She is the kind of person who, when told to go right, doesn’t just go left: she goes up, out of sheer principle. She is someone who pushes when a door says <em> pull</em>, because <em> she will check that for herself, thank you very much</em>. She is <em> that </em> bitch who fakes an injury to use priority seating or access: her own rules make more sense anyway, and if they don’t, she’ll simply bend them.<br/>Agatha is an anarchist not just with a capital A, but capital NARCHIST too. If she can be trusted on something, it’s to always do or say the complete opposite of what is expected.<br/>It’s not about being right or wrong; it’s about complete and total autonomy. Freedom. And if a (mandatorily imposed) therapist had once labeled that behavior as a compulsive personality disorder, it had been his own fault for being fired during that same session.<br/><br/>Instead of a therapist, she’d gotten a dog– the fierce, slightly bigger than average German Shepherd had turned out to be an excellent, obedient, and –here’s the kicker<em>– </em> exclusively non-verbal replacement.<br/><br/>This does not mean Agatha has no desire to have other people in her life; it just means her definition of certain types of relationships might differ from other people’s.<br/>She has friends, of course: people she can vent to and get up to the craziest shit with.<br/>She has dated, too: even without wanting to be dependent she can see the appeal in having someone praise her for an extended amount of time– someone she can sexually please or be pleased by however and whenever she desires.<br/>And then there’s kink: ever since she’d stumbled upon the world of domination and discipline, she had found the one and only place where the already established rules made sense to her. She had learned to separate kink from sex too, shortening the list of requirements for the people she wants to do either with.<br/><br/>Yet that list of requirements is quite long for every single one of these categories, so she has always convinced herself she will never find everything she’s looking for in just one person, someone who meets them <em>all</em>.<br/><br/>This strong belief crashes down like a house of cards on a Tuesday afternoon in the early Summer, when Agatha leaves the grocery store–with <em>at least </em>60% of the contents of her shopping bag paid for–and she hears a female voice she doesn’t recognize.<br/><br/>“...I’d rather be tied down, choked up, and have my bare ass smacked all the way into next month by the Dalai Lama, but I appreciate the invitation, thank you.”<br/><br/>Agatha stops dead in her tracks, blinks for a baffled second, and cackles. Whoever this woman is, Agatha considers her a good candidate for the <em>friends-</em>category.<br/><br/>She turns around and sees Dottie, their neighborhood representative–or the town clown, as Agatha calls her–nearly tearing up at the unknown woman’s way of declining her invitation to, probably, one of her hair-pullingly boring town meetings.<br/><br/>Agatha snorts loudly as Dottie retreats to her car while lifting her phone from one of those ridiculous phone bungees, about to call one of her insufferable golf club friends–or the cunty club, as Agatha calls them.<br/><br/>Her shoulder jerks as her dog pulls on the leash, so Agatha decides to give him some leeway and continues the short walk home. But not even two steps in, Agatha suddenly halts again– her gears turning while she processes the appearance of that lady who had already made her day: expressive features, dark hair, careless demeanor and plump, full lips that will be of outstanding service to soften the landing when Agatha is going to use her face as a chair.<br/>It’s simple math, really: funny plus stunning equals an upgrade to the <em>dating</em>-category. <br/><br/>Agatha whirls back around and shamelessly lets her eyes roam over the woman’s body, lingering at her breasts, then her ass, and then her breasts again. God must have taken sculpting back up as a hobby when She made this creature.<br/><br/>But the shape of her body isn’t the only thing making it impossible for Agatha to tear her eyes away– it’s the black leather corset she wears over a white blouse, the laces intricately woven together at the back.<br/><br/>Then the words she heard just a minute ago drift back to her:<br/><br/>‘<em>...tied down, choked up, and have my bare ass smacked…’ </em><em><br/></em><em><br/></em>So had it indeed not been impossible? Had Agatha been wrong? (Unlikely; she is never wrong. Her prediction just had been slightly off, and who can predict the future? Nobody. How can she be wrong about something <em>nobody </em>can be right about?)<br/><br/>Agatha takes a lot of pride in all of her radars having an accuracy rate of 100%: her gaydar (for queer women) her naydar (for potential red flags) and her playdar (for people who hide their freaky kinks just under the surface). So when her gaydar and her playdar start beeping furiously at the blip that is this gorgeous woman in front of her, and her naydar has nothing to report, Agatha can’t help but assume she is looking right at a potentially perfect sub.<br/><br/>Within four deliberate strides, Agatha stands in front of this new specimen, immediately demanding all of her attention. She leans back, one arm over her chest, and inquisitively points at her.<br/><br/>“You’re new here,” she states, sweeping her hair back over her shoulder.<br/><br/>“I am.”<br/><br/>Agatha very obviously checks her out from head to toe. “And you’re going to join me for a drink.”<br/><br/>“I am?”<br/><br/>“You’re also going to give me your number,” she says, fetching her phone from her back pocket and dropping her voice into something more flirty, “And I’m going to text you a time and a place.”<br/><br/>“I am? You are?”<br/><br/>“Unless those are the only words coming out of your pretty mouth, then I’m uninterested.”<br/><br/>The woman smirks. Bingo.<br/><br/><em>Hook, line, and–</em><br/><br/>While maintaining eye contact, Agatha puts her hand behind her back and commands her dog to start barking with a trained gesture.<br/><br/>“Psycho!” she calls out, pretending to be shocked and offended. “Bad dog! C’mere, boy. Sit.”<br/><br/>The dog instantly goes quiet and he heels next to his owner, sitting down obediently. The woman’s eyes drop to the dog and she caves, kneeling down in front of him.<br/><br/>“Oh hi sweetie— Can I pet him?”<br/><br/><em>–sinker. </em><em><br/></em><em><br/></em>“You may,” Agatha allows her with a smile, feeling her giddiness grow at the woman being on her knees <em>and </em>asking permission to do something. <em>So trainable. </em><em><br/></em><em><br/></em>The woman starts rubbing his face and his ears, cooing at him softly as his tail sweeps the floor in excitement. Then, while keeping her hands on his neck, she looks up at Agatha.<br/><br/>“His name’s <em>Psycho</em>?”<br/><br/>“Short for Psychologist.”<br/><br/>An amused chuckle. “I’m sure there’s a story there.”<br/><br/>“And you? What do I call you when I need you to pay attention?”<br/><br/>The woman’s eyes darken and she focuses on Psycho. She scratches him under his chin and he tries to lick her hand.<br/><br/>“My name’s Rio,” she says to the dog. “And the next time you hear it, it’s gonna be screamed.”<br/><br/><br/></p><p> </p><p>By next Friday, ten days after their first interaction, Agatha is positively, irreversibly in love with Rio. After they’d agreed on a time and a place via text, Agatha had sent her multiple messages a day, with only about half of them being reciprocated. Rio must be doing something stupid throughout the day like having a job, but that only adds to her growing limerence. To make sure her interest is known–Agatha doesn’t do hard to get; she just has needs and it’s called self care–she had texted her cute flirty things like <em> I can’t wait to see you </em> and <em> You have beautiful eyes </em> and <em> I dreamt I came all over your face.  </em></p><p>When Agatha enters the local dive bar at a couple minutes past eight, Rio is already seated. She’s hunched over the bar to talk to the bartender, and Agatha gets a full view of her muscled shoulders and smooth skin thanks to the lacy top with a dangerously low cut in the back. Agatha automatically notices the lack of a bra since her back is free of any straps.<br/><br/>She approaches her and brushes her fingers over Rio’s spine to announce her presence. Rio turns around, gives her a reserved smile, and Agatha places a lingering kiss on her cheek.<br/><br/>“Hello beautiful,” she says, taking the seat next to Rio without invitation. At that moment, the bartender places a beer in front of Rio.<br/><br/>“I hope you don’t mind, I already ordered,” Rio says coyly. Agatha snickers– she’ll allow it. She’ll teach her some manners eventually.<br/><br/>“Thirsty?” she jeers, and lifts a finger to the bartender to order the same. “As long as you wait for me so we can make a toast.” </p><p>Without hesitation, Rio lifts her beer and takes a large gulp, leaving remnants of foam on her upper lip. She wipes her mouth with her thumb and shrugs. “Thirsty, yeah.”<br/><br/><em> Oh, so we’re dealing with a brat here? </em> Agatha’s eyes flash. What fun she’ll have breaking her.<br/><br/>“Where’s Psycho?” Rio asks, placing her glass back on the bar.<br/><br/>Agatha leans back in mock offense. “Am I not enough for you?”<br/><br/>“That, I don’t know yet. With Psycho, at least I already know he enjoys it when I pet him.”<br/><br/>“If you’re nice, I’ll take you to see him later tonight. And you can find out what other things he enjoys being done to him.”<br/><br/>“Still talking about the dog, right?”<br/><br/>“Nope.”<br/><br/>Both women grin at each other while Agatha receives her beer. Despite Rio’s rude gesture earlier, she still lifts her glass. “To you, for making Dottie consider early retirement,” she says. Rio touches her glass to Agatha’s and chugs the rest of her beer, immediately asking the bartender for another.<br/><br/>Agatha has been chronically turned on for over a week now, but not being able to give into the sensation between her legs by excusing herself and rubbing one out in the bathroom, is making her deeply uncomfortable at the moment.<br/><br/>She’s already decided to take Rio home after this–if she wants to, sure, but why wouldn’t she–and stick to vanilla sex for their first time. Or vanilla-<em>ish</em>, since Agatha wouldn’t want to be caught dead in missionary. <em> Here lies Agatha. Just like she did when she died. </em>Hell no. </p><p>She backtracks a bit and steers the conversation towards more smalltalk, which she uses to keep finding excuses to touch Rio. Her hand on top of hers, their legs brushing, her fingers on the other woman’s spine when she leans in to speak directly into her ear.<br/><br/>But then Rio has to go and ask dumb overrated questions like: “What do you do for work?”<br/><br/>Agatha rolls her eyes. “You get one night with the sexiest woman in this neighborhood and you waste your breath on questions like <em> that?” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “What else would you want me to waste my breath on?”<br/><br/>“I can think of a few things.”<br/><br/>Rio hums in anticipation. “But I already asked the question though. You might as well answer.”<br/><br/>What’s her fucking deal?<br/><br/>Agatha deliberately sighs. “I work for the government,” she says. It’s not <em> technically </em> a lie. “Happy? Did that piece of information spice up this date?”<br/><br/>Rio looks at her with a knowing smirk. “A date, huh?”<br/><br/>“Obviously. Or did you think I introduced myself to you because I want to crochet little sweaters for stray animals together?”<br/><br/>“Tempting,” Rio says, “and actually, you haven’t introduced yourself to me at all.”<br/><br/>“Didn’t I? Well, you could’ve <em> asked </em> me for my name.”<br/><br/>“I guess I assumed you’d tell me if I needed it.”<br/><br/>Agatha’s skin buzzes with the desire to shut this woman up in the most delicious way. <em><br/></em><br/>“What did you save me in your phone as?” she asks, curiosity getting the better of her.<br/><br/>Rio whips out her phone, navigates to their text chain and, almost defiantly so, shows Agatha her screen, which simply displays her phone number at the top.<br/><br/>Did she make that bad of an impression? She is still just a number in Rio’s phone?<br/><br/>“Yeah, that won’t do,” Agatha says, snatching the phone from her hand. She smirks to hide her disappointment and taps the <em> Add new contact </em> button.<br/><br/>“This is theft, you know,” Rio remarks, to which Agatha scoffs. <em> You know nothing about theft. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “Only if I don’t give it back,” she says out loud, while typing her own name and two emojis: a mouth biting its bottom lip, and one with two pieces of rope woven together. There, that’ll compensate for the lack of an impression she left on her.<br/><br/>When she hands Rio her phone back, she watches her–unintentionally–mimic the lip biting emoji when she reads Agatha’s contact name. One of her eyebrows raises as she meets Agatha’s gaze. “I had a hunch,” she says while trying to hide a smile.<br/><br/>A hunch about what? About her name? About her dabbling in bondage? Or about her favoring kink in general?<br/><br/>Rio distracts her from her thoughts when she asks: “What about me, <em> Agatha?” </em> she asks, letting the name marinate in her mouth. Agatha had never been particularly fond of her own name, but now that she’s heard it from Rio’s lips, she will make her say it over and over again or die trying.<br/><br/>“What’s my name in your phone?”<br/><br/>“Just Rio,” Agatha lies, but Rio is having none of it and beckons her with a hand to give up her phone.<br/><br/>“Show me.” Rio leaves no room for resistance.<br/><br/>Okay, feisty little thing. But careful what you wish for. </p><p>Agatha shows her the contact page saying <em> Funny </em> with a check emoji, <em> Hot </em> with a check emoji, and <em> Kinky </em> with an emoji of a woman shrugging. Rio laughs when she reads it, a low, breathy chuckle. She, too, takes the phone from Agatha’s hand and starts tapping.<br/><br/>When she’s finished, she returns the phone to Agatha, her contact page now saying <em> Ms. Rio </em> with two emojis: a peach, and a stretched out hand.<br/><br/>Now it’s Agatha’s time to chuckle. Ms.? <em> Must be her way of saying she’s available. </em> <em><br/></em> And those emojis— her palm starts itching. <em> God, when she gets her hands on her… </em><br/><br/>“Don’t let the Dalai Lama see this,” Agatha says, tucking her phone away.<br/><br/>“He won’t be an issue anymore, I ended up handing his own ass back to him.”<br/><br/><em> Marry me, Ms. Rio peach emoji hand emoji. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “Would you say no if I asked you to come home with me?” Agatha boldly asks, drawing a straight line across Rio’s upper leg with the nail of her index finger.<br/><br/>“You have an interesting way with words,” Rio says. “If you ask it like that, you don’t leave much room for people to say no.”<br/><br/>“That’s because I don’t want to leave room for you to say no.”<br/><br/>“Manipulative, much?”<br/><br/>Agatha leans forward on her stool to speak directly into her ear. “Come on now, Rio. You’re a big girl. You can still refuse if you don’t want to.” When Rio doesn’t flinch, she nips the shell of her ear.<br/><br/>“Are you like this in bed, too?” Rio asks, unfazed. She even turns her head and now she’s nose to nose with Agatha.<br/><br/>“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Agatha husks against her lips. “But you’re not going to find out today. I’m inviting you over for sex, just sex. We’ll see what happens next if I still like you afterwards.”<br/><br/>Rio doesn’t hesitate and closes the distance between them, sliding her hand around Agatha’s neck. Agatha gives in to the kiss by reeling Rio in by the waist, pulling her off the bar stool and making her stand in between her parted legs.<br/><br/>She feels Rio suck in her bottom lip to nibble on it, which makes Agatha squeeze her waist in warning. <em> This minx will eventually learn to only take what she gives her.  </em></p><p>Agatha’s warning squeeze seems to have the opposite effect as Rio gently bites down, pulling her lip outward as far as it stretches, and releases it with a wet <em> snap. </em> Agatha honest to God <em> growls. </em> It makes Rio’s pupils dilate.<br/><br/>Before Agatha can dive in for a reprimanding kiss, Rio whispers: “Let’s go, <em> Agatha.” </em><br/><br/>A shiver runs down her spine and she turns to the bartender to tell him to put their drinks on her tab. He doesn’t get the chance to remind her of her multiple outstanding bills, before she slides off the bar stool, fetches her bag and summons Rio to follow her with a nod of her head.<br/><br/>She hauls a cab and, to Rio’s visible surprise, gets in the passenger seat after she’d held the backdoor open for Rio. The fact that she’s going to take it easy tonight doesn’t mean she can’t still assert dominance. Besides, she needs them to leave the cab eventually, and she’s not sure she’d be able to stop once she’d start kissing her in the backseat.<br/><br/>When they arrive at her humble mansion, the two women barely make it past the front door. Agatha could tell Rio had been about to make a comment about the size of her house, but she’d cornered and kissed her before any words had been able to come out. She’ll give her the tour later; she needs a tour inside Rio’s panties first.<br/><br/>She unbuttons Rio’s dress shorts with her right hand to make room for her left, but pulls away when she reaches the waistband of her panties like they burned her on touch.<br/><br/>“Bedroom,” she commands, her voice gravelly, as she points to the stairs.<br/><br/>“Not so fast, you promised me to see Psycho. Where is he?” Rio asks, clearly just to dismiss her.<br/><br/>“Probably in his bed like he’s being <em> told, </em> behaving like a good boy. Now get up the <em> fucking </em>stairs.” </p><p>And Rio has the audacity to <em> laugh; </em> a clear, amused, high-pitched sound. Agatha wants to swallow it.<br/><br/>She follows Rio’s mouthwatering ass up the stairs and hooks her left hand in her waistband again to guide her to the bedroom. When they get there, she decides to give Rio two seconds to take the room and the giant four poster bed in, but Rio uses that unguarded moment to press Agatha to the wall using her entire body.<br/><br/>They kiss again; open-mouthed, hot, and heavy now that they’re alone. When Rio’s tongue snakes in to lick across the roof of her mouth, Agatha returns her earlier stunt by sucking her tongue in, trapping it in her own mouth.<br/><br/>She mewls, and when Agatha finally slides the palm of her hand down Rio’s panties, she feels Rio unceremoniously shoving her own hand past the waistband of Agatha’s slacks too.<br/><br/>They reach each others clit at the same time; Agatha releases Rio’s tongue and both woman sigh into their resuming kiss.<br/><br/>Rio makes quick work of spreading her folds using her index and ring finger– her middle finger gathering a generous amount of slick between her vagina and her clit. <em> Oh, she knows what she’s doing. She knows her way around a cunt. Hot. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> Agatha uses the same three fingers to cup Rio’s pussy, and presses down in a beckoning motion to swipe all of her wetness up towards her clit.<br/><br/>Flicking and rubbing each other’s most sensitive spot, it almost starts feeling like a game; who can make the other come the quickest.<br/>Agatha doesn’t play games she can’t win, so with their hands still down each other’s pants, she guides them to the bed.<br/><br/>In one fluent motion, she withdraws her own hand and uses it to pull Rio’s away too, only to quickly remove her shoes and slacks– maintaining eye contact to silently order Rio to do the same.<br/><br/>She considers whether she needs Rio’s torso bare too, and decides in a split-second that the visual of her boobs probably won’t hurt. She tugs on the sleeves of Rio’s lace top and it effortlessly slides down her shoulders thanks to the low cut on the back. As Rio frees her arms from the sleeves and pulls the shirt over her head, Agatha concludes she is, once again, right: her small, perfectly shaped boobs with dark, rock-hard nipples definitely deserve being on display.<br/><br/>Rio reaches out to undo the buttons of Agatha’s blouse, but she slaps her hand away. No time for incompetent fumbling. She nimbly opens the buttons with one hand herself and discards the shirt behind her, revelling in Rio’s hungry gaze. Finally she unclasps her bra and throws it at Rio, who swiftly catches it and carelessly hurls it over her shoulder.<br/>Before Agatha can blink, Rio’s mouth is on hers again.<br/><br/>“So hot,” Agatha breathes into the kiss, as her hands impatiently explore the newly exposed skin. Rio answers by crawling on the bed high on her knees, pulling Agatha with her by the waist, who does the same.<br/><br/>“Lie down,” Agatha commands, only slightly tapping into her Domme voice.<br/><br/>To her wild surprise, Rio smirks and responds: “You lie down, babe.”<br/><br/>Agatha’s system short-circuits for a brief moment, and she concludes this must be Rio’s idea of playful defiance when she reaches out to slide her hand back down Agatha’s panties. She lets it happen and quickly copies her; within no-time, both women lean into each other while furiously stimulating each other’s clit.<br/><br/>“C’mon, let me make you feel good,” Agatha grits through her teeth, desperately trying to find the spot that will make Rio’s knees buckle.<br/><br/>“I already feel amazing,” Rio purrs, closing her eyes and throwing her head back in ecstasy at the relentless pace of Agatha’s fingers. </p><p><em>Why won’t this goddamn woman just lie the fuck down? And why does she–oh fuck–keep hitting the perfect angle– </em>she can’t do her <em>job </em>like this–<br/><br/>“Oh honey, I can’t wait to tie you up,” Agatha says in a strained grunt, hissing when Rio hits another delicious spot. “Wanna see that look in your eyes and make you <em>beg</em> when you finally realize who’s in charge.”<br/><br/>Rio huffs in surprise, slightly canting her hips to get the pressure she needs. “You want to tie <em>me </em>up? That’s rich,” she smirks darkly.<br/><br/>“I have to say, even for a brat you have a big mouth,” Agatha responds, her disbelief slowly turning into horniness. “But don’t worry, darling, I know many ways to shut you up.”<br/><br/>Her mind starts providing her with images of all the possibilities, and she feels herself getting close to her peak at Rio’s agile fingers.<br/><br/>“<em>Who</em> are you calling a brat now?” Rio laughs, but Agatha can tell she’s close too. “That’s no way to speak to your future Domme.”<br/><br/>As her orgasm builds, Rio’s words are only vague sounds initially. But then some of them do make it through her brain’s processor, and–</p><p>“<em>My </em> future Domme?” she croaks, slowing the movements of her own hand down. “What’s that supposed to mean?”<br/><br/>“Don’t stop, Agatha,” Rio whines. “So close– c’mon, I thought we weren’t gonna play tonight–”<br/><br/>“Rio, you <em> are </em> a sub, right?”<br/><br/>“Huh?” Rio’s eyes fly open and her hand stills too. “The fuck are you talking about?”<br/><br/>“Wait.” Agatha reluctantly withdraws her hand for the second time, as Rio does the same. “I assumed– you gave me all these signs– I thought you were into kink, and so–”<br/><br/>“Oh, I am,” Rio says, looking almost offended. “But I don’t sub, Agatha. For nobody. Never have, never will. Are you saying <em> you </em> are a Domme?” <br/><br/>“Do I give off bottom energy to you?” Agatha snaps.<br/><br/>“With those hungry eyes? Yes, absolutely.”<br/><br/>“What the hell,” Agatha sighs defeatedly, sinking down on her heels. She desperately tries to ignore the pulsing of her clit. “You obeyed every order I gave you. It felt like you were <em> testing </em> me by showing me your bratty side. Fucking hell, you <em> look </em> and you <em> smell </em> like a sub, Rio.”<br/><br/>Rio laughs scornfully.<br/><br/>“What I don’t understand is in what <em> universe </em> you thought <em>I</em> could be a sub?” Agatha says, throwing her hands up in bewilderment.<br/><br/>“Oh please,” Rio says, letting herself fall to the side and roll onto her back. “Overdoing the self-confidence, stalking me like you’re <em> obsessed,” </em> she says to the ceiling. “I thought it was obvious you got your dog to obey so well because there’s no way you’d have a human follow your orders.”<br/><br/>Agatha goes red in the face. “Well,” she declares loudly. So <em> indeed </em> it turns out to be impossible to find someone she’d be completely compatible with. Fine, that’s <em> fine. </em><br/>“It seems like we’re dealing with a misunderstanding here. Clearly we can’t play with each other.”<br/><br/>Rio turns her head to look at her. “I guess so. And you don’t want to– you know, try? See if you like it?”<br/><br/>“I’ll turn straight before I’ll ever be a sub, Rio,” she barks. “And I <em> despise </em> men. You do the math.”<br/><br/>Rio snorts and turns onto her side, propping her head up on her hand. Unfortunately for Agatha, she looks like a fucking goddess like this.<br/><br/>“And besides,” Agatha continues to distract her from the view—she should’ve kept Rio’s shirt on after all. “If <em> one </em> of us should try, it should be you. You must be the softest fucking Domme ever, you seem like such a push-over. I didn’t think you had it in you.”<br/><br/>She had hoped this would antagonize Rio so much she would just get up and leave, but of course, the opposite happens.<br/><br/>“What’s wrong with being a soft Domme?” she asks, her tone genuine. “I worship my subs as much as they do me, but I’m still in charge. I don’t need to raise my voice or use harsh punishments to get someone to behave, Agatha.”<br/><br/><em> She should stop saying her name like that. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “My subs tend to <em> like </em> it when I’m strict. They <em> want </em> me to be rough with them,” she counters.<br/><br/>And Rio fucking shrugs. “We’re clearly not suited for each other when it comes to kink,” she says, “but that doesn’t mean we can’t still have sex–”<br/><br/>“No,” Agatha immediately interrupts her, her clit throbbing in protest. No, Rio has done enough damage as it is. She’d hoped she’d finally found someone who ticked all of her boxes, had put every ounce of faith in her, only for everything to fall apart like this.<br/><br/>“No, I was specifically looking for someone to play with,” Agatha lies.<br/><br/>“Then why did you propose to have sex first?”<br/><br/>“I don’t think I need to explain myself to you. Listen– we both assumed something and we were wrong. Let’s be adults about it and cut this off now. We know this isn’t going anywhere.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>When she watches Rio leave a few minutes later, her mind whispers a soft goodbye at her potential. <em> Of course </em> this had seemed too good to be true.<br/><br/>Agatha decides she deserves punishment for getting her own hopes up– and deletes Ms. Rio peach emoji hand emoji from her contacts.<br/><br/>Of course. Ms. Rio.<br/><br/>She hadn’t been flaunting her marital status. She was telling Agatha what to call her.<br/><br/></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha masturbates roughly nineteen times during the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
She’s been picturing Rio in nothing but a lacy pair of panties, the way she had looked before Agatha had sent her away, including widened pupils and goosebumps all over her skin.<br/>
<br/>
She touches herself so often to that image, she isn’t sure that the Rio in her mind’s eye is what Rio <em> actually </em> looks like. Forgetting her altogether would be ideal, but her nervous system has different plans. If her clit could talk, it would tell her ‘<em>No, not you, absolute bumbling idiot. I need that other lady,’ </em>every time she brings herself to orgasm. It’s relieving, still, but her pussy is very clear about not being completely satisfied unless Rio does the job. </p><p>Even when she goes to the graveyard section in her contacts app, texting a random person she’s fucked before, her body seems to slam the emergency brakes. Her clit shrivels up at the idea of having someone else try and fix the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so maybe deleting Rio’s number had been <em> a little bit </em> impulsive. There’s nothing she can do about that now. And while the realization that she doesn’t know where Rio works or lives sets in, she knows it’s hopeless.<br/>
<br/>
A quick Google search has her come back empty-handed too; she doesn’t have much to go on. <em> ‘Rio’ </em> isn’t exactly enough information to find someone, and why does that bitch have to have an existing, translated word for a name?<br/>
<em> ‘Rio, person, -river’ </em> doesn’t do much better either.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple of her dating apps keep mocking her with the message ‘<em>No new people in your area’, </em>so she won’t find her on there either. </p><p>Look, she might be getting a little desperate, especially since she was the one to kick her out and delete her number— but she just can’t keep bickering with her clit to convince it that <em>Rio isn’t gonna touch you</em>,<em> so just take what I give you.</em><br/>
<br/>
So sue her for getting a little creative. By the power of deduction, she lists the facts:<br/>
<br/>
Rio must live somewhere in Westview, since she’d walked to the grocery store.</p><p>When they had left the bar in a cab after their date, Rio didn’t say anything about having to leave her own bicycle or car behind, so that’s not how she had gotten there.<br/>
But if she lived a walkable distance from the bar, she probably would have suggested walking to her place instead of Agatha’s.</p><p>That leaves a cab or an Uber as her transportation options from her house to the bar. And since the date was planned, it’d been more likely she’d gotten an Uber instead of hauling a cab.<br/>
<br/>
So if Rio is a frequent Uber user, there’s a chance she Ubers to work, wherever that may be. Agatha remembers that Rio’s replies to her texts significantly lowered in frequency between 9am and 5pm, so standard working hours. </p><p>It’s all breadcrumbs, but hey, if she has enough of those, she might still get a whole loaf.<br/>
Determined to find her lost lover—like, sexual lover, as in, they’ll do it <em> once </em> and then <em> that’s it </em> kind of lover—she signs up through the Uber app as a driver. She enters Monday through Friday as her working days, with her working hours being 8AM-9AM. That one hour window should be enough to get matched up. As her profile picture she adds a photo of her car; her name is simply <em> ‘A’. </em><br/>
<br/>
During the first week, her phone <em> dings </em>with requests from mostly names that probably belong to middle-aged white men. Decline. Decline. Decline. </p><p>She gets a warning from the app on Friday; if she keeps declining routes, she is going to get banned.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha promises herself she’ll give this three weeks– if she hasn’t been connected to Rio by then, her theory probably isn’t perfectly watertight. </p><p>This means however, that she has to do at least one route a day to keep her account active, which is how she eventually finds herself pulling up to Dottie’s house with an exasperated frown that could make babies and small children cry.<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha? You’re an Uber driver now?” Dottie exclaims in surprise while she fastens her seatbelt in the backseat.<br/>
<br/>
“Not a <em> single </em> word<em>,” </em> Agatha grits through her teeth. When Dottie tuts in disapproval, she has half a mind to run her two month old electric SUV straight though a lamp post.<br/>
<br/>
She continues the drive to Dottie’s destination—some kitschy coffee shop with too many pastels and too little functioning brain cells behind the window—and she roars when her phone <em> dings </em> and her first review rolls in: three stars from Dottie.<br/>
<br/>
She hits the wheel in frustration, first with her hand and once more with her head for good measure, accidentally booping the horn. A couple of pedestrians get spooked from the sound, violently jerking up, and they turn around to scold her. Agatha double flips them off and lays on the horn on them for a solid 40 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s pussy better tastes like fucking ambrosia. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It goes like this until on Friday, Agatha decides she can and will not do this for another week. It’s the exact same day her phone <em> dings </em> at 8:12AM and it’s a ride request from Rio V.<br/>
<br/>
Jackpot.<br/>
<br/>
She jabs the <em> accept </em> button so forcefully she nearly breaks the screen, and drives to the pickup location going 15 over the speed limit while dousing herself in perfume.<br/>
<br/>
When she pulls up to the right house, Rio is already outside, eyes locked on to her phone. She looks up when Agatha stops the car in front of her, and walks up to the back door.<br/>
<br/>
“Hi! For Rio?” she asks while getting in.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you <em> want </em> to be kidnapped? You should ask the driver who they’re picking up, not tell them. Anybody could say yes,” Agatha says to her rearview mirror. Rio, who was in the act of buckling up, freezes mid-motion.<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha?”<br/>
<br/>
“Again, <em> ask </em> the driver what their name is, don’t <em> tell–” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “You’re an Uber driver? I thought you worked for the government!” Rio interrupts her, clearly caught off guard.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha considers lying– but she hasn’t suffered through driving Westview’s most obnoxious inhabitants around to be shy about it now. </p><p>“Listen, Rio, you’re literally impossible to track down,” she says, turning around in her seat to actually look her in the eyes. “This was my only option. I needed to ask you something.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s facial expression goes through all five emotional phases of change, thrice, before being able to speak again.<br/>
<br/>
“You… became a driver to talk to me? What’s wrong with just– I don’t know– a good old fashioned phone call?”<br/>
<br/>
“I dropped my phone in the toilet.” Okay, so maybe she doesn’t have to be honest about <em> every </em> little detail.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s right there,” Rio points to the phone attached to the dash, displaying Rio’s Uber request.<br/>
<br/>
“Mind your business,” Agatha snaps. “I think I deserve a little more credit for actually fucking finding you. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find someone who shares a name with the capital of Brazil?”<br/>
<br/>
“That’s Brasilia.”<br/>
<br/>
“Fine, the capital of Brasilia, whatever. <em> Not the fucking point.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Rio snorts and crosses her arms.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you actually going to take me to my destination or is this a kidnapping after all?”<br/>
<br/>
“So demanding, you should take that tone down,” Agatha remarks, but she turns back around and starts her car anyway. “Let’s see. We’re going to talk, while I’ll drive you to— <em>the fuck </em> are you going to the state correctional facility for?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m turning myself in for multiple homicide of my Uber drivers,” Rio deadpans.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh are you? Don’t forget to mention the brutal murder of the <em> mood </em> you committed by pretending to be someone you’re not.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha starts driving, naturally without any regard for other road users.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m sorry?” Rio scoffs. “It’s not my fault you’re so quick to assume things about other people. Besides, you threw me out— if anything, you should be locked up for your lack of manners.” </p><p>“Yeah, about that… That might’ve been a little… rash,” Agatha reluctantly admits, almost hitting the curb while rounding a corner. “I was wondering if I could still take you up on that offer.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio, while turning an unhealthy shade of green and gripping onto the handle for dear life, asks: “Offer? What offer?” Despite the aircon being on full-blast, she subtly rolls the window down an inch.<br/>
<br/>
“You know,” Agatha sighs in annoyance. “You could’ve– just stayed. For sex. We might as well have finished that part, and <em> then </em> go on our merry ways.”<br/>
<br/>
“<em>That </em> is why you tracked me down? Because you want me to get you off and– for the love of God, Agatha, a speed bump is meant to <em> slow you down—</em>”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s not called a <em> slow down bump</em>, is it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Did you know your overall rating is 2.2 stars? I almost cancelled the ride before you even got here.”<br/>
<br/>
“Westview is full of pussies,” Agatha waves a dismissive hand, making the car swivel to the left and scaring a person on a bicycle into some bushes.<br/>
“But there’s one pussy I made a lot of effort for, Rio. What do you say? Don’t you think it’s a bit romantic?” She wiggles her eyebrows in the rearview mirror, but Rio is way too focused on the road, trying not to paint the backside of the passenger’s seat with the contents of her stomach.<br/>
<br/>
“If you promise to delete the Uber app off your phone, I’ll do anything,” Rio pleads.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Anything?” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “A lot. There’s a lot I’d be willing to do. Fucking freak.”<br/>
<br/>
“Fantastic. Tonight, 9pm, my house. Wear something you think I’d like to unwrap.”<br/>
<br/>
It’s a bold request, but Agatha is a bold woman. She knows chances are Rio will bolt, possibly even move to another town. But if Rio feels anything like the need Agatha has experienced during these last two weeks, she’ll understand.<br/>
<br/>
When she tries to make eye contact through the mirror again, Rio just nods absentmindedly.<br/>
<br/>
“I could pick you up at home, if you l–”<br/>
<br/>
“NO! Agatha, I <em> beg </em> you–”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha does nothing to hide her smirk<br/>
<br/>
“That’s a start.” </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After dropping Rio off—and trying to get an honest answer out of her as to <em> why </em> she was going to prison, but to no avail—Agatha had been smart enough to copy her number from the Uber app and re-add it to her contacts, before resigning as a driver.<br/>
<br/>
At 9:05pm that evening, Rio rings the doorbell.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re late,” Agatha says while opening the door.<br/>
<br/>
“I could go?” Rio challenges her, jabbing her thumb over her shoulder. </p><p>“Get inside, idiot. Did you Uber here?” Agatha can’t help but ask.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m not getting in an Uber in the foreseeable future,” Rio says, “I almost paid for that last one with my life.”<br/>
<br/>
“Cry me a Rio.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ha-ha. No, Victoria took me here.”<br/>
<br/>
“Victoria?” Agatha repeats, already feeling her blood pressure rise. But when Rio points at the large black and metallic motorcycle parked just down the driveway, she slowly exhales.<br/>
<br/>
“Victoria is the love of my life,” Rio explains, damn near making heart eyes at it. Only now Agatha registers the leather jacket and pants Rio is wearing. It’s a practical outfit, sure… but leather sure as hell looks fantastic on her.<br/>
<br/>
“Is this something you’d enjoy unwrapping?” Rio asks when she catches Agatha staring.<br/>
<br/>
“Depends– what are you wearing underneath?” </p><p>“Would it be fun if I told you?”<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
</p><p><br/>
As it turns out, Agatha finds it is way more fun to find out the answer herself; the answer being <em> nothing. </em> Once they’re in the bedroom again, pulling down the zipper of the jacket reveals Rio’s cleavage first, then a perfect amount of sideboob; the nipples still covered by the loose hanging fabric.<br/>
<br/>
“No funny business,” Agatha demands before continuing, prodding Rio’s sternum. “I just need you to finish what you started. Do <em> not </em> try to top me– we’re doing this as equals. Capiche?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio smirks and starts playfully tugging on Agatha’s collar. “I can certainly try,” she says, <em> having no right to look this sexy, </em>“but I can’t always help it. Second nature and all. If only you could stop making subby eyes at me.” </p><p>Agatha would <em> love </em>to choke her. Would probably dream about doing exactly that tonight. </p><p>Instead, she says: “I’d really like for you to shut the fuck up. So I’m going to kiss you now.”<br/>
<br/>
She puts her actions where her mouth is, quite literally— and Rio welcomes it, gasping into the kiss. While her responses to Agatha’s behavior have been quite passive up until now, she loses any reservations as soon as their lips, tongue, and teeth meet.<br/>
<br/>
“Couldn’t stop thinking about this,” Rio breathes into her open mouth, while her fingers find the buttons of Agatha’s blouse. Agatha’s skin starts tingling at those words and she decides to allow Rio to continue undressing her this time.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the fact that she knows the two of them would never work together in the long run, Agatha feels her body respond in a way that can’t be ignored. Rio is, in many ways, exactly the kind of person who could drive her crazy. And not just because of the way she looks—which is definitely not hurting her eyes either—but because of her wit, her courage, her graceful confidence, the way she responds to Agatha and the way she knows how sexy she is and actively uses it against her.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, she would make such a <em> perfect little brat. </em>Both between the sheets and as a—</p><p>Agatha deepens the kiss and it gets sloppier and hotter while she slides her hands underneath the jacket to cup Rio’s breasts. She won’t allow herself to think about any possible future with this perfect— <em>almost</em> perfect woman. She can’t get her hopes up about making her into something she isn’t. Something she doesn’t want to be.<br/>
<br/>
So this has to be it, this will have to be the one and only time she gets to enjoy Rio and her body.<br/>
<br/>
When Rio has opened all the buttons of Agatha’s blouse, she wastes no time pulling the cups of her bra down to pinch both of her nipples. Hard.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha leans back out of the kiss with a hiss. “Ow! What the hell?”<br/>
<br/>
“Come on, Agatha,” Rio says in a sultry voice, stepping even closer. She soothes the pain by rubbing her thumbs over her nipples. “Even without one of us taking the lead, you can’t convince me you don’t like it a little rough.”<br/>
When she pinches one of her nipples again, the sting goes straight to her cunt.<br/>
<br/>
“Fuck you,” Agatha groans to hide her moan. She slides one of her hands up in Rio’s hair, the other one cups her ass. Then she leans in to speak directly into her ear: “I’m only gonna say this once, Rio. <em> Behave. </em> Because if you don’t, I’ll take it as a sign you’re allowing me to <em> make you behave.”<br/>
</em> She smacks her ass, soft enough to not make it seem like a serious attempt at a spank, but hard enough to emphasize her warning.<br/>
“Now, lie the fuck down.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio chuckles, a sound that instantly activates an awkward kind of rage within Agatha. Though for a second, it looks like Rio is about to comply when she turns her back towards the bed.<br/>
<br/>
Then she sticks out her leg and pulls Agatha in by her open blouse, making her trip and turning her onto her back on the bed mid-fall.<br/>
Immediately, Rio crawls on top of her while Agatha grunts in frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha tugs Rio up by the collar to crash their lips together again.<br/>
<br/>
“This–” a filthy lick across Rio’s lips, “–isn’t–”, a nip at her bottom lip, “– <em> fucking–”, </em> another desperate kiss on her lips, “–working.” <br/>
<br/>
She tries to finally push the leather jacket off of Rio’s shoulders, but has to stop herself multiple times in the process to absolutely <em> devour </em> Rio’s tongue with her own.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, Rio sits back up straight to shimmy the jacket off herself. “So let’s fuck, and I’ll be out of here.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha expects her to take her already open blouse off too, but instead Rio just pulls the fabric aside and undoes the very convenient front clasp of Agatha’s bra, revealing her naked chest. Even before Rio’s lips envelop one of her nipples, Agatha hears herself whimper.<br/>
<br/>
To distract herself from Rio’s tongue pleasuring her nipple in such a suggestive way that can only be meant as a preview of what she’s capable of when it’s her clit instead, Agatha fumbles around for the button of Rio’s leather pants.<br/>
Somehow, the sound of the zipper being pulled down is extremely erotic.<br/>
<br/>
“Sit on my face,” Agatha groans; it’s supposed to be an order, but it sounds more like a plea. She clears her throat, and says with more conviction: “Rio, get your cunt on my mouth.”<br/>
<br/>
She feels Rio smirk around her nipple, and she releases it after one more painful tug with her teeth.<br/>
<br/>
“As you wish,” she says mischievously, pushes back off the bed to rid herself of her pants. Agatha does the same while still lying down, kicking her slacks and her lacy underwear off her ankles.<br/>
<br/>
Rio, now fully naked, positions herself over Agatha again, taking a few seconds to look her in the eyes and place a line of possessive kisses in her neck; from under her ear all the way down to her shoulder. When she crawls further up, she again does something that Agatha is not expecting.<br/>
Rio turns around before lowering herself onto Agatha’s mouth; facing her feet instead of the headboard. Agatha doesn’t think much of it first— digging her nails into the delicious flesh of her ass and inhaling deeply when Rio’s pussy hovers just above her face.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Well, shit. Of course she had to be a fucking delicacy.  </em></p><p>She taps Rio’s thigh as a signal she’s ready for her to take a seat, which she does— but she also bends forward, landing straight onto Agatha’s exposed pussy with her mouth. Before Agatha even realizes what’s happening or before she can dive in, she feels Rio’s tongue parting her folds and already doing sinful things to her clit.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh— <em> fuck!” </em> Agatha cries out, bucking up her hips in surprise and pleasure. What the hell; the last time she sixty-nined, she must’ve been in her twenties. But that’s what she gets for wanting to fuck someone who refuses to bottom, she guesses.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to stay behind, Agatha cranes her neck and buries her own face in Rio’s pussy, earning herself a delicious moan from her, which she feels vibrating between her legs.<br/>
<br/>
What an idiot. If only she knew the amount of pleasure Agatha could give her if she wasn’t so adamant about returning the favor at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha starts with a few teasing licks first, but soon she notices that Rio is way past the teasing phase. The assault on her own pussy feels like Rio is a starved woman, wanting to taste and suck up every single drop that Agatha produces. The waves of pleasure that induces make Agatha work harder too, making sure to touch every spot of Rio’s cunt within reach. She circles her clit, sucks in her folds, even bites and lightly tugs on her pubic hair, evoking a muffled mewl from her.<br/>
<br/>
The grip on her ass tightens, pulling Rio even further down, but Rio wants to reciprocate and stuffs her own face even deeper into Agatha’s pussy.<br/>
Agatha jolts when Rio gives her clit tiny kitten licks while her nose presses against her entrance.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Rio!” </em> she gasps, followed by a drawn out moan. She closes her eyes for a second, and when she opens them again she greedily licks up a drop of arousal she sees trickling from Rio’s entrance. The other woman’s breath hitches when she does that, so she sticks out and hardens her tongue, entering her as far as she can manage. She pulls Rio’s pussy flush with her face and keeps digging her tongue in, purposefully licking her inner walls.<br/>
<br/>
Rio goes feral. Her hips keep jerking and Agatha has to use all of her muscles to keep her in place— meanwhile, her own clit gets sucked into Rio’s mouth, receiving such delicate and precise licks that her vision blurring with every single one.<br/>
<br/>
“Ah! Fuck! Oh, <em> shit— fuck—” </em> A string of unintelligible expletives sound from Rio’s throat, but they all get muffled between Agatha’s legs. Still, she gets a thrill out of all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha pulls back for a second and darkly whispers: “How about you come first, <em> softie</em>?”<br/>
<br/>
While focusing her ministrations on Rio’s clit again, the other woman responds: “I think <em> you’re </em> about to come first, loser.”<br/>
<br/>
And Agatha has to tense a <em> lot </em> of muscles for that not to be true. This slut has no reason to be so good at bringing her to orgasm so fast—<br/>
<br/>
Both women double their efforts, determined to get the other off first. For Agatha, this means she has to suck and lick every last drop out of Rio’s clit to not get too distracted by the waves of pleasure Rio causes between her legs.<br/>
<br/>
“Just— fucking <em> let go</em>, stubborn idiot,” she hisses while her own hips girate to get more from Rio’s mouth and get away from her at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>You’re </em> not as tough as you think,” sounds the answer.<br/>
<br/>
“Pussy.”<br/>
<br/>
“Weak bitch.”<br/>
<br/>
"<em>Fake-ass Domme</em>.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha has barely uttered those words when she’s used up all of her might to stop her climax from taking over her body. It rolls up and over her like a powerful, merciless earthquake, and she loudly releases every desperate moan she’s been holding in, all of her restraint resolved in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
It’s so all-consuming that she doesn’t know whether Rio has reached her orgasm too, but she does feel the other woman shudder on top of her.<br/>
<br/>
“Fuck,” Agatha lets out one last groan, before releasing her grip on Rio’s thighs and dropping her head back. If she needs to continue to finish Rio, she’s gonna need a minute.<br/>
<br/>
However, Rio crawls off of her right away, getting off the bed to look for her clothes without making eye contact.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha lifts her head in confusion, as far as her neck muscles currently allow her to.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, what are you— did you—?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yep,” Rio says curtly, shoving one of her legs back into her pants.<br/>
<br/>
“Rio?” <br/>
<br/>
No answer, only strained grunts from pulling on the tight leather.<br/>
<br/>
“Rio, what the fuck?”<br/>
<br/>
“You wanted to get off. You got off,” Rio snaps. “So that’s it, isn’t it? We fucked, and we already know this is as far as we could ever go between the two of us.”<br/>
<br/>
She flips the sleeves of her jacket, which had been turned inside out in the rush of getting naked, the right way again.<br/>
<br/>
“I mean, yes, but— wow, okay. I didn’t expect you to be in such a hurry to leave, though.”<br/>
<br/>
“No? Well, this <em> fake-ass Domme </em> has places to be, Agatha.”<br/>
<br/>
When Rio’s words finally make sense, it’s too late. Agatha hears her front door slam shut.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so <em> maybe </em> she went a little bit too far. That’s fine, <em> fine. </em> She got what she wanted, <em> her clit got what it wanted, </em>so now she can finally move on. </p><p> </p>

<p>The fact that Agatha now knows where Rio lives, has absolutely nothing to do with the newly adapted route she takes to walk her dog.<br/>
<br/>
Because of course it makes a lot of sense to manhandle a resisting Psycho into her car (he is perfectly capable of jumping in, but he outright refuses— forcing her to put his front paws onto the rear bumper and then quickly lifting his 82 lbs ass up into the trunk every time) to take him for a walk around just another (not so) random block of houses. </p><p>And if she only takes him there outside of working hours and struts up and down the same street four times per walk, that’s a total coincidence too. At least the new scents that come with a change of scenery seem interesting enough for Psycho.<br/>
<br/>
It comes as a total mindblowing surprise when, after a few days of this new routine, Psycho’s ears perk up at the sound of a motorcycle. Agatha briefly follows his gaze, and pretends to ignore the bike carrying her beautiful ex-one-and-a-half-night stand, coming to a stop in front of her house.<br/>
<br/>
Rio clocks Agatha and Psycho immediately, gets off her bike and turns around. Psycho starts barking at her full leather outfit and the helmet with the visor shut. Agatha quietens him with a small hand gesture.<br/>
<br/>
“What are you doing here?” The muffled question sounds from inside the helmet. Rio flips the visor up, revealing a small part of her squished face.<br/>
<br/>
“Rio?!” Agatha exclaims in shock. “Oh right, you <em> live </em> here! I thought this street looked familiar.”<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha, please. You’ve been doing laps in front of my window like you’re trying to pass the goddamn shuttle run test. I have the police on speed dial.” </p><p>“Who’s quick to assume now? Psycho really likes it here. Don’t you, Psy?” Agatha looks down at him and lifts her eyebrows. Psycho barks once.<br/>
<br/>
“Does he now?” Rio sounds unimpressed, but clearly can’t get over her weak spot for the dog. She, like during their first meeting, crouches down in front of him and takes the helmet off, revealing her flushed cheeks and sweaty locks.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha watches it happen in slow-motion and she regrets not carrying a bucket of water to throw at Rio.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey buddy. Do you remember me?” Rio asks, offering up her palm for him to sniff. When he does, he starts panting and his tail starts to wag.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha shoves her hand in her pocket and takes out a dog biscuit. “Wanna bribe him into liking you?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah!”<br/>
<br/>
When Rio reaches out to take the biscuit, Psycho gets distracted and jumps up to intercept the handoff.<br/>
<br/>
“Psycho!” Agatha warns him in a strict voice. She points at him with her index and middle finger, and when she has his attention, she flicks both fingers downward. Psycho immediately obeys by sitting down.<br/>
<br/>
“That’s cool,” Rio says, sounding more impressed this time. And were her cheeks <em> this </em> red before? She takes the biscuit from Agatha and asks:<br/>
“What more can he do?”<br/>
<br/>
“Hold out your hand, palm down,” Agatha instructs her, and Rio complies with her free hand. She catches Pyscho’s attention right away.<br/>
<br/>
“Good, now flip it.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio swiftly turns her palm up, and Psycho lowers himself on his belly, before rolling over onto his back. His paws lazily dangle up in the air.<br/>
<br/>
“Sweet!” Rio laughs, leaning forward on one knee to rub his belly. “C’mere, boy, you deserved your snack.”<br/>
But Psycho doesn’t move.<br/>
<br/>
“You sure he likes this?” Rio asks Agatha, a hesitant look at the biscuit she’s trying to offer him.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, he does. He’s just being a good boy. He won’t take it until he hears his release word.”<br/>
<br/>
“Which is?”<br/>
<br/>
“Ready to get smothered in dog kisses?”<br/>
<br/>
“You bet.”<br/>
<br/>
“Psycho— free.”<br/>
<br/>
Psycho gets back onto his paws, faster than lightning, and loudly devours the biscuit in Rio’s hand. But he doesn’t stop there; when he’s swallowed his snack, he jumps up at her, his big front paws land on her shoulders, and he starts gratefully licking her face.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh my– <em> oh my god,” </em> Rio giggles, scrunching her face at his enthusiasm. “Yes, hi, hello. Hi, you’re a good boy, alright, okay, that’s enough!”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s face hurts from keeping a neutral expression. “Heel,” she speaks softly, and Psycho lets go of Rio to take his place by Agatha’s side.<br/>
<br/>
Rio keeps looking at him and her expression turns into an unreadable one. Agatha wonders if Rio is still angry at her— or whether the door is still open.<br/>
<br/>
“You made him obey on your first try,” Agatha says, her tone sweet like honey. “He usually needs a while to warm up to new people. You must possess some powerful energy.”<br/>
<br/>
When she watches Rio’s mouth curve up into a shy smirk, she cheers inwardly. “Not bad for a fake-ass Domme, huh?” Rio boasts. Good, she seems to have taken the bait.<br/>
<br/>
“I suppose… yes. I’m sorry I called you that,” Agatha lies.<br/>
She knows when to take a step back, if only for her own benefit. And if having Rio just one more time is that benefit, she’s willing to fake being humble. She <em> needs </em> Rio one more time; only because whatever their thing was hadn’t felt wrapped up when Rio left in a hurry. Closure— Agatha needed closure.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, any chance you can watch him tomorrow?” Agatha pouts at her. “I have an appointment in Eastview and I can’t take him. He doesn’t like being alone.”<br/>
<br/>
She has an appointment absolutely nowhere with absolutely nobody, but it wouldn’t be the first time Psycho “Wingdog” Harkness would get her some ass.<br/>
<br/>
“Me?” Rio laughs incredulously and gets up. “Agatha— He’s cute, but you and I aren’t exactly friends, are we? I can’t help but think you’re trying to find an excuse to see me.”<br/>
<br/>
Perceptive cunt. “Moi?” Agatha touches her palm to her chest. “Puh-lease. If you think I need to trick you into spending time with me, you don’t know me at all.”<br/>
<br/>
“That is the point,” Rio snorts. “I don’t know you. At all.”<br/>
<br/>
Oh, all the ways she could punish Rio for making this so damn difficult…<br/>
<br/>
“Fine,” Agatha eventually says, overacting a shrug. “I thought I’d offer, since you're new here. Figured you’d like to make some friends. Even if it’s just a furry one. But don’t worry, I’ll ask someone else. I’m sure I can find someone who’s…” Agatha’s eyes knowingly flick down to her dog, “...<em>free</em>.”<br/>
<br/>
Psycho jumps up so high, all four of his paws come loose from the ground. He launches himself at Rio, licking her hand first and then climbing up at her; even when she’s standing up his front paws reach her shoulders. She gets a full face cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, you <em> bitch,” </em> Rio giggles, trying to pet him and simultaneously get him away from her face. “You can’t use him as a <em> weapon— Psycho! Stop it!” </em><br/>
<br/>
As Rio keeps crying out high pitched sounds of joy, Agatha’s stomach shrivels up like a raisin.<br/>
<br/>
“You’ll find that I <em> can, </em> actually,” she smirks lazily, doing nothing to stop her dog’s love attack.<br/>
<br/>
Rio tries to grab onto his paws and push him down, but he’s as adamant as his owner. “Alright, fine, <em> fine!” </em> she laughs. “I’ll come puppysit you. But you have to behave better than this, buddy!”<br/>
<br/>
“That’s what he wanted to hear. Psycho, heel,” she says nonchalantly, and the dog sits down by her ankles.<br/>
<br/>
“As for <em> you,” </em> Rio points at her, slightly out of breath. “You have already proven you’re not capable of behaving. So just keep in mind that I’m doing this for him.”<br/>
<br/>
“Of course, darling,” Agatha responds with a royal wave of her hand. “Just don’t tell him that,” she nods at Psycho and continues in a whisper, “he’ll let it get to his head.” </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha deserves a pat on the back for her ingenious way to reel Rio back into her life, so she decides to take herself shopping during the hours she’d convinced her she needed her to watch Psycho.<br/>
<br/>
She makes sure the house is squeaky clean and tries not to think with her cunt when she watches Rio arrive through her Ring camera.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey gorgeous,” she casually greets her a minute or so later, because either her brain is in her cunt or her cunt is in her brain, but there’s really no reason to <em> not </em> flirt with Rio.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey.” Rio gives her a placid smile when she takes her helmet off. If she keeps showing up in these leather outfits, she shouldn’t be surprised if Agatha carries around heavy duty scissors one day. “Is he ready for me?”<br/>
<br/>
Are <em> you </em> ready for <em> me? </em> Agatha thinks.<br/>
<br/>
“He promised to be on his best behavior for you,” she says instead, stepping aside to let Rio in. She walks off immediately after Rio takes her shoes off, to skip right over the awkwardness of Rio having been in her house twice and yet never having seen any other room than the hallway and the bedroom.<br/>
She leads them both through the large living room to the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
“I keep his food and water bowl here, but he should have enough for the next couple of hours. Don’t let him trick you into thinking he hasn’t been fed— he <em> will </em> make eyes at you. His leash is over here, it’d be great if you could walk him at some point—”<br/>
<br/>
“But how do I get him to my neighborhood?” Rio asks with an amused smile. “It <em> is </em> his favorite place to walk, right?”<br/>
<br/>
“He’ll survive just going around the block,” Agatha answers dryly. “Unless you plan to take him on your motorcycle, in which case; be my guest, but please do print a QR code of my Venmo account on your bike— people should be tipping to see that.”<br/>
<br/>
The sound of doggy footsteps on hardwood floors makes them both turn around. “Speaking of the devil,” Agatha says affectionately.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey bud!” Rio beams, tapping her chest with her hands as a sign for him to jump up. “Ready to learn some new tricks from Aunt Rio?”<br/>
<br/>
<em> Aunt Rio?! </em> Let’s see how much time it takes to turn that into Mommy Rio. They’re not goddamn <em> sisters. </em><br/>
<br/>
“If he acts up, just be stern with him,” Agatha continues, trying to ignore Rio’s radiating face while she connects with her dog, holding both of his large ears in her hands, wiggling them back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
“Only if reasoning with him doesn’t work,” Rio grins, booping his nose.<br/>
<br/>
“Good luck with that. He’s the captain of Westview’s Canine Debate Society and they’re on the state leaderboard for the third year in a row.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio snorts and shakes her head, finally looking up at Agatha. “You’re such an idiot.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha tallies that as a win in her mental notebook. “Careful, darling,” she says, taking one step closer to Rio. Her voice drops an octave. “He’ll always obey me before you, and I taught him to bite on command.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio meets her challenging gaze head on. “I bet he’s not the only one who bites on command.”<br/>
<br/>
“The question is: would you like it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Would <em> you?” </em><br/>
<br/>
The electricity between them crackles, the tension nearly visible. Agatha forces herself to laugh at her to not give away anything about her organs doing olympic flips.<br/>
<br/>
If she pushes Rio against the wall right now, slipping her hand inside those tight leather pants, would she let her..?<br/>
Agatha sucks in a breath— no, she’s playing the long game. She’s caught on to Rio’s reservedness after what Agatha had called her; pouncing now would not end well. She needs Rio impatient and wanting. </p><p>“Help yourself to <em> anything </em> you find around here,” she says slowly and deliberately. She leans in just a bit more and presses her lips to Rio’s cheek; too short to be suggestive, but not short enough to be friendly. “And thanks for helping us out. You’re a doll.”<br/>
<br/>
She watches Rio clench her jaw, and she leans back with a satisfied smile.<br/>
<br/>
“Well,” Agatha says, loudly clapping her hands together. She turns to walk back to the front door. “Time for mama to go. Be a good boy for me, yeah?”<br/>
<br/>
She pauses, looks over her shoulder, and narrows her eyes; her lips curve up into a wicked smile. “Oh, and Psycho— you too.”<br/>
<br/>
She doesn’t wait for Rio’s reaction. “Text me if you need anything!” </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha spends the short drive to Eastview loudly singing along to whatever Spotify picks from her liked songs. She almost neurotically drums her fingers on the steering wheel, drawing a breath to belt out Cher’s <em> Believe</em>—Spotify hates her—to not give space to the nervous feeling creeping up on her.<br/>
Yeah, she definitely deserves to take herself shopping. Window shopping, that is, and if she happens to trip and a few items happen to fall into her bag without her knowledge, that’s really not her concern.<br/>
<br/>
She throws her car into park, covering one and a half parking spots, one of which is an accessible one, and fishes for her phone which has already made a few notification sounds.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Movement detected, </em> her home camera app informs her. She clicks the app and chews her lip as it loads the livestream. All rooms are empty, except for the living room, where she watches Rio sprawled out on her couch, lazily petting Psycho with one hand and holding her phone with the other. <em> Phone addict. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> As she gets out of the car, she registers the accessible sign. She briefly contemplates limping away, but decides against it— she deserves to park here just as much as the next person, able-bodied or not. Hell, she pays taxes for this. Okay, maybe not as much as she <em> should, </em>but it’s the thought that counts. </p><p> </p><p>She enters Eastview Mall and helps herself to a few complimentary items from different stores—only big franchises with old, white males for a CEO, she’s not a <em> complete </em> animal—before she gets her first text message from Rio. It’s a photo of her outstretched hand with a dog biscuit in her palm.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Can he have this?  </em></p><p>Agatha types a quick message back: <em> Yes, but make him work for it.<br/>
</em> Rio responds with the saluting emoji. <em><br/>
<br/>
</em> After an insistent rumble of her stomach, she navigates to the food court. She’s about to indulge in a large bowl of phở when she receives another photo. Putting the soup spoon between her lips, she unlocks her phone. It’s a selfie— Psycho takes up most of the frame, flashing his best doggy smile; Rio’s face is squished up against his, but most of it falls out of frame. It’s just an eye, a perfectly shaped eyebrow, crows feet, and a strand of dark brown hair.<br/>
<br/>
<em> He’s not a fan of working for his money, but we made up. Psychopath and I are best friends now.  </em></p><p>Agatha hates the picture, has never hated anything in her life quite this much, in fact. She holds her thumb down to save it to her camera roll.<br/>
<br/>
<em> His full name is Psychologist, </em> she texts back.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Right. I keep mixing you two up. </em></p><p>Agatha’s teeth accidentally break the plastic spoon in half.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Are you sure you’re not a brat, Rio? </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em>She slurps the rest of the soup straight from the bowl. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>During the next hour, she keeps receiving photos. Psycho’s jaw clenched around a knotted rope, playing tug-of-war with a hand off-camera; a shot taken from behind him on the sidewalk, his leash leading to somewhere beneath the lens, his tail blurry from movement; and one of an index finger and a thumb holding up a very clearly well-used poop bag. The last photo is accompanied with a Venmo request for $3 that says: <em> Absolutely FOUL. </em></p><p>She ignores it as she, completely unrelated to anything going on in her life, enters a lingerie store and grabs four sets from the rack to take to the fitting rooms.<br/>
<br/>
While admiring herself in the mirror with the first set on—a dark burgundy, lacy bralette and matching thong—another message comes through. It’s a photo of a locked door by the stairs in her house.<br/>
<br/>
<em> What’s behind this door? </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Sex dungeon, </em> she responds.<br/>
<br/>
Three dots appear in the message thread, blinking for a minute.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Can I see? </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Do you think it’d be locked if you could? </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> The next photo is another selfie; it’s the lower half of Rio’s face, her lips curved down in a pout. <em> I thought you said I could help myself to anything around here. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Agatha’s palms start itching. Why is this she-devil out to provoke her?<br/>
<br/>
She looks in the mirror again and contemplates snapping a mirror selfie to send back— but that would give away her lie about having an <em> appointment. </em> However, she looks <em> too good </em> to do nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha clips her hair loose so it falls over her shoulders, holds her phone at waist height and angles the selfie camera up, framing just the top part of the bralette and half of her face, cutting right above her nose.<br/>
<br/>
There. She’ll give Rio a preview of what it looks like to be on her knees for her. </p><p>Curving one side of her mouth up in a smirk, she snaps the photo. She hits send and types: <em> Consider this: if you don’t have access, it’s not for you. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Oh, </em> is the first message coming through, the next ones following in quick succession.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Fuck </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Are you back soon? </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Fuck that </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Wait </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Scratch that </em></p><p><em> Fuck you </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Agatha grins dumbly at her phone and types: <em> Access requests will be processed within 3-5 business days. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> She changes into a new set while waiting for the reply. When it comes, she can’t hold back a groan. It’s another photo, taken in front of her bedroom mirror. It shows Rio from the waist down, one hand holding her phone and the other one disappearing behind the waistband of her pants.<br/>
<br/>
<em>You said you work for the government and it shows. Can I bribe you to speed the process up?  </em></p><p>Agatha curses silently, but welcomes the heat in her lower body. This is what she’d been aiming for anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<em> 25 minutes, </em> she replies. <em> Don’t touch anything else. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> She keeps the lingerie on, rips the tag off, puts her own clothes back on and drapes her old bra on the empty hanger, making sure to give a total of four items back to the store clerk.<br/>
<br/>
While leaving the store, another picture comes in through her phone. A shiver runs down her spine as she realizes Rio is standing in her walk-in closet and has pulled open a few of her drawers completely filled with sex toys, ropes, and floggers. <em> OMG, </em> is the accompanying message.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha speed walks to the car, furiously typing away.<br/>
<br/>
<em> When I say “don’t touch anything” and you go and touch the first thing you see, does that not scream “bratty sub” to you, Rio? </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Less texting, more driving, </em> Rio replies. <em> But please don’t hit anybody. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> About halfway during her drive, another notification comes in through her Car Play. Siri informs her that Rio has sent her an image, and reads the text out loud. “<em>How do you feel about doing this together?” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Agatha breath hitches; she coughs, jolts, and hits the curb, the top of her head nearly hitting the roof of the car as it bounces. She hears a faint screech somewhere behind her— which is good, screeching is good, it means the person it comes from can still breathe.<br/>
She feels a blotching redness creeping up from her neck to her face as her mind races with whatever the image could be that Rio sent her. And while she may be a little bit of a reckless driver, she’s not <em> a total idiot; </em> she won’t check her phone until her car is back on her driveway and in park.<br/>
<br/>
She accidentally hits the wrong numbers twice while unlocking her phone, finally succeeding on the third try.<br/>
When she opens the message, she slowly breathes out and pinches the bridge of her nose.<br/>
<br/>
It’s a photo of a flyer that she’d kept around, an invitation to a shibari workshop in New York. She’d been interested, but had already decided not to go as she doesn’t have a partner to bring.<br/>
<br/>
God, Rio’s such a loser.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha doesn’t answer the text but gets out of her car, loudly opening and slamming the front door of her house shut after she enters, the sound announcing her arrival. Her eye catches Psycho napping in his dog bed— Rio must still be in the bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
She takes the stairs with slow, deliberate steps, not knowing what she’s going to walk into, but determined to stay in control.<br/>
<br/>
But of course, she could, and should, have known better— there’s no salvaging her composure when she hears the faint, low moans coming from her bedroom. She stops dead in her tracks once Rio comes into view, and slumps against the doorframe.<br/>
<br/>
“Now that’s not exactly appropriate behavior for a dog sitter, is it?” she says, her voice low and sultry to keep it from wavering. “Poor Psycho. All alone.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio is on her back; knees bent and feet on the mattress, her hand shoved inside her pants just like in the photo she’d sent earlier— it’s moving, the hand; and going off of the sounds it elicits from Rio, it hits her most pleasurable spot perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
The scene causes a sharp, white hot sting between Agatha’s legs. She might as well have received a slap to the cunt. Fuck Rio. Fuck fuck fuck her.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio draws out the vowels of her name in an erotic sigh, voice dripping with ecstasy. Agatha wants to either pounce, or rip her own ears off. Gouge her eyes out, while she’s at it.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s hand slows down until it stops, but she doesn’t move its position. “So, how was your <em> appointment </em> ?” she asks, her voice gravelly, slightly lifting her head to look at Agatha.<br/>
<br/>
“Sublime,” Agatha says. “Best appointment I’ve ever had.” She’s 98% sure she might as well drop the act, but there’s more pressing matters now.<br/>
<br/>
“And how about that workshop?” Rio continues, weirdly conversational. She points to the flyer on the bedside table with her chin.<br/>
<br/>
“Rio.” Agatha clears her throat.<br/>
<br/>
“Hm?”<br/>
<br/>
“Your hand's inside your pants.”<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Very </em> astute observation,” Rio says, rolling her R. “Wanna finish my job for me?”<br/>
<br/>
And she does, <em> oh god, she does, </em> but she can’t— giving in would be letting Rio win, would be showing weakness. All while Rio is, quite literally, the one showing her soft underbelly. <em> What </em> a cunty move. <br/>
<br/>
Agatha exhales sharply through her nose. She’d <em> just </em> been winning their game, moving all her pieces with controlled effort, calling check— how is Rio the one check mating her now?<br/>
<br/>
“You’d let me tie you up?” she asks breathily, shifting the conversation back to the shibari workshop flyer.<br/>
<br/>
Rio chuckles; a deep, throaty rumble. “Nice try. I imagined it the other way around.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha huffs. “You'd need to know the basics. It’s not an introduction class.”<br/>
<br/>
“Which knots do you consider to be the basics? The half-hitch? Surgeon’s knot? Single or double column tie?” Rio sums up cockily. “I could also tie a harness or two.”<br/>
<br/>
A mixture of aggression and arousal is doing fascinating things to Agatha’s body. To the muscles in her legs, to her breath, and to the palms of her hands, specifically. She’s always had a hunch, but now she’s sure: this woman was created by the devil to drive Agatha mad.<br/>
<br/>
“Come here, Agatha,” Rio eventually husks when Agatha doesn’t answer. It doesn’t sound like an order, more like a stern suggestion— and obviously, <em> obviously </em> Agatha isn’t going to do what Rio tells her—<br/>
<br/>
So why are her legs moving? Why do her eyes flick down to Rio’s core when her knees hit the edge of the bed, watching her hand regain its slow movement? <em> What was in that fucking phở? </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> In a few swift movements, Agatha climbs on the bed, straddles Rio, yanks her arm from her pants and pins both of her wrists to the mattress above her head. She’s already breathing heavily when she lowers her head to capture Rio’s mouth in a searing kiss— but it’s all good, she’s got her, she’s on top, she’s in control. Even if the sinful sigh Rio lets out in her mouth makes her shiver.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha grinds her hips down and Rio sharply sucks in air through her nose; it eventually leaves her body as a low purr. She bucks her hips up in answer, making both women moan and speed up their movements, looking for more friction.<br/>
<br/>
“Come with me to New York,” Rio whispers against her lips. It’s not a question, but with her dark voice it’s a damn solid attempt at persuasion.<br/>
<br/>
“Only if you let me practice on <em> you,” </em> Agatha whispers back with the same intensity, nipping at her lips, occasionally teasingly dipping her tongue in the other woman’s mouth. "And if you'll let me drive." <br/>
<br/>
"Never in four hundred million years," Rio chuckles, reaching her neck out to try and catch Agatha's tongue.<br/>
<br/>
“How about we each get a turn?” she then suggests with a mischievous smile. “It’s not like… an <em> actual </em> scene. It’s just practice. It won’t be about dynamics. Just about technique.”<br/>
<br/>
And Agatha is not dumb enough to fall for that, obviously.<br/>
But it <em> does </em> sound reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
“Right,” she breathes, not entirely convinced. “Because we agreed we could never… <em> actually </em> do something like that together.” She kisses her way along Rio’s jaw to her neck, sucking lightly on her pulse point.<br/>
<br/>
“Exactly,” Rio groans. “So that’s all it would be. Just two Dommes refreshing their skills. As friends.”<br/>
<br/>
“As <em> friends?” </em> Agatha growls in her ear. Her nails dig into Rio’s wrists. “So I <em> am </em> your friend now?”<br/>
<br/>
“I watched your dog,” Rio’s voice strains in anticipation. “I fear that makes us friends.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha roughly drags her hips down again as she whispers: “In that case, I’m about to drive my fingers inside of you in a very friendly way.” <br/>
<br/>
“Does that mean we’re doing the workshop?”<br/>
<br/>
“It means I’m doing <em> you. </em> We’ll see about that fucking workshop if you behave.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh Agatha,” Rio chuckles breathlessly. “You can’t expect me to behave if you can’t overpower me.” </p><p>“No? I think I’m doing a pretty good job so far. Seeing as you’re already underneath me, completely at my mercy.”<br/>
<br/>
When Agatha is the one who comes; one, two, three times, with Rio’s head between her legs and her name on her lips, she realizes how very, <em> very </em>wrong she is. </p>

<p>Rio could not be convinced to let Agatha drive them to New York, just like Agatha had refused to get on Rio’s motorcycle. The compromise had consisted of Rio driving them in Agatha’s car.<br/><br/>And just like how it goes with all compromises; nobody is ever fully satisfied with the solution. That is why Agatha, in the passenger seat of her own car, will <em> not </em> keep her commentary on Rio’s driving to herself. God forbid Rio maneuvers through traffic recklessly.<br/><br/>After numerous gently motivating sentences like “<em>just overtake him, he’s going 57,” “check your left mirror, are you trying to kill us?” </em> and “<em>I will explain the difference between the brake and the gas one more fucking time,” </em> Rio turns the volume all the way up. Ava Max’s <em> Sweet but Psycho </em> blasts through the car.<br/>Agatha is having none of her antics and reaches to turn it back down, after which Rio covers the button on the dash with her right hand and turns the volume up with her left, using the button on the steering wheel.<br/><br/>“Oh ha-ha, very mature of you!” Agatha yells, to which Rio shrugs and points to her ears. The car swivels and a truck honks. Agatha flips the truck off first, then smoothly twists the back of her hand toward Rio.<br/><br/>Rio either doesn’t see or doesn’t want to see, so Agatha scrunches her face while annoyingly waving her middle finger in Rio’s aura to catch her attention.<br/>With her eyes fixed on the road, Rio calmly places a hand on Agatha’s wrist and presses it down and out of sight. Agatha lifts her other hand to continue doing exactly what she was doing.<br/><br/>“If you keep this up, I’m making you sit in the backseat!” Rio shouts over the music.<br/><br/>“Can’t hear you!” Agatha loudly sing-songs.<br/><br/>“The trunk works too!”<br/><br/>“What was that?”<br/><br/>“Or I’ll tie you to the tow bar if you’re lucky!”<br/><br/>“Ooh! Kinky!”<br/><br/>Rio side-eyes her, wraps Agatha’s middle finger in her fist and brings it to her mouth. Just as Ava sings <em>‘she’s poison but tasty,’ </em> Rio catches the tip with her teeth and brushes her tongue over the skin.<br/><br/>Unrelatedly, the heat in the car rises a few degrees. Agatha squints.<br/><br/>“Hey Siri! Play <em> Dirty Thoughts</em>!” she bellows, a mischievous glint in her eyes. As Chloe Adams starts singing the song title right away, Rio lets go of her finger and barks out a laugh.<br/><br/>“Hey Siri! Play <em> Not Into You </em> by Brooksie!”<br/><br/>Agatha pouts at being outwitted, but she’d rather throw herself out of this moving car than to lose this game.<br/><br/>“Hey Siri! Play <em>s</em><em>he calls me daddy</em>!”<br/><br/>The music changes again, and something in her chest flutters as she watches Rio lift her eyebrows, shrug, and smirk. Good<em>. </em>  <br/><br/>They get through about half of the song when Agatha realizes she’s still staring at Rio. Rio must’ve noticed it too, because she relaxes under her watchful gaze; her legs spread a bit further, and her knowing smile never falters.<br/>And while this confident, almost arrogant behavior is insanely attractive, Agatha can’t help but be annoyed at her own current position. Being in the passenger seat is already lowkey humiliating, and she’d already felt some of her control slip earlier when Rio had asked her who’d watch Psycho in her absence, and Agatha had to explain that the neighbors would check up on him— consequently exposing her earlier request for Rio to dogsit him as a ruse.<br/><br/>Agatha watches Rio rub her own thigh with a sweaty palm, an innocent gesture at first glance. But then her fingers start drawing deliberate patterns, clawing and flexing her long, slender fingers, and tapping to the rhythm of the music— almost hypnotizing Agatha with every micro-movement.<br/>Agatha clears her throat and turns her body away from her; right elbow against the window, chin in hand, staring straight ahead.<br/><br/>“Hey Siri! Play <em> Joyride </em> by Fletcher!” Rio shouts, and finally turns the volume down to a reasonable level. Agatha doesn’t recognize this song, but doesn’t show it. She stoically stares out the window as she listens to the lyrics. The first verse is graphic enough to make heat rise to her cheeks.<br/><br/>“<em>Nobody catches the girl, double dare you to try,” </em> Rio softly—and adorably off-key<em>—</em>hums along to the chorus. Agatha’s furrowed brows almost hurt in her attempt to strain the muscles so tightly that it will convince her that the song is just a random choice.<br/><br/>During the second verse, Rio’s eyes flick to the side when she sings: “<em>Who knew I’d meet somebody with a mind as perverted as mine?” </em><br/><br/>Agatha snorts as she compares that sentiment to everything the two of them have been up to; and let’s not forget their bags in the back— each containing a few of their preferred ropes, since they’re currently on a two hour drive to a bondage masterclass.<br/>It’s ridiculous, it’s stupid, it’s crazy, it’s exciting, and it’s <em> so them. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> When the chorus repeats itself, Agatha knows for sure that these notes are definitely not written for someone with Rio’s vocal range. That, and someone with Rio’s vocal range is definitely not made for Agatha’s ear drums.<br/><br/>“Hey Siri,” Agatha mumbles while crossing her arms and kicking one foot up on the dash, “play <em> Shut up and drive.”  </em></p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Upon arrival, Agatha is only half surprised by the fact that the workshop takes place in a dance studio on the first floor in one of the high rises. A very <em> unsexy, </em> well-lit by harsh lighting, faintly stenching of sweat, dance studio. Two adjoining walls are completely covered in mirrors and sport a barre in front of them. The large windows across show an impressive view of one of the many busy streets of New York.<br/><br/>Oh well. What should she have expected— <em> a brothel?  </em></p><p>A bulky, not unattractive male of about their age, sitting on his knees on the floor, greets them with a kind smile. He crosses their names off a list and directs them to the dressing rooms, where they, as previously instructed, change into their leggings.<br/><br/>Agatha makes a point of not looking at Rio while she unzips her jeans, and she convinces herself she does that because there’s nothing of interest she hasn’t seen before. A tiny voice in her head laughs.<br/><br/>She silently changes into her stretchy, eggplant colored leggings, uttering a few muffled curses as she strains to pull them all the way up. Then her gaze accidentally lands on the mirror, where she just accidentally catches a glimpse of Rio’s lacy panties before they disappear into her sage leggings.<br/><br/>Agatha swirls around and forces her eye muscles to not drop to Rio’s ass, but she loses that fight quickly and condemns the founder of Lululemon to hell for putting Rio’s bubbly butt on display like that.<br/><br/>While Rio braids her own hair behind her head, the lifting of her arms gives a great insight into the holes of her sleeveless tee. Thank fuck she wears a sports bra, at least. </p><p><br/><br/>When they return to the dance studio, barefooted and a little anxious, their instructor seems to have had the presence of mind to close the curtains both in front of the windows and the mirrored walls. The lights are dimmed and soft, relaxing music can be heard through the speakers. A few other participants have gathered on the floor in a half circle; most of them already have a piece of rope laying beside them.<br/>The instructor asks if Agatha and Rio need to borrow rope, but they thank him and each retrieve their own from their bags. They look interestingly similar; both are black and have a shiny, silky look to the intricate weaving. Rio gives Agatha a look— one that seems to communicate something along the lines of <em>great minds...</em><br/><br/>Just as they join the other participants on the floor, the instructor gets up and sits down across from the group. He introduces himself as Bruce, and informs them he will be assisted by his long-term play partner who will join him shortly. When he ventures off into a story about his experience in shibari and his history as an instructor, Agatha mentally checks out and topples onto her side, leaning on her elbow. She shifts her attention to her rope and fiddles with the end of it. She ignores the nudge from Rio’s foot against her shin.<br/><br/>“Ah, there she is,” Bruce cuts himself off mid-sentence. He beams at the door, Agatha follows his gaze, and does an honest-to-god textbook doubletake at the gorgeous redhead who enters the studio. She’s clad in a black leotard and shorts, displaying her feminine features beautifully. While joining Bruce on the floor, she casually rakes a hand through her shoulder length hair. Her lazy smile as she takes in the group makes Agatha blush like a hormonal teenager.<br/>It isn’t until she hears Rio clear her throat that Agatha realizes her mouth is ever so slightly open. She closes it with a clack of her molars and curiously observes Rio, who is now zeroed in on the rope on the floor in between her legs, untying a big knot with a deep frown on her face. Coincidentally, Rio’s cheeks are adorned by the same color change as Agatha’s.<br/><br/>“Hello everyone. My name’s Natasha,” the woman introduces herself, in a mesmerizingly low voice. Agatha can’t help but wonder if and how she uses that voice during play. “Or Nat’s fine.”<br/><br/>“Nat sure is<em> fine,” </em>Agatha mumbles under her breath, only because she revels in the way Rio starts buzzing like a hornet.<br/><br/>“If you’ve come here alone, please take one of those chairs over there,” Nat instructs the group. Her R’s are heavy; she has a light accent. “And if you’re here with a partner, please find a spot on the floor together.”<br/><br/>“Or friend,” Agatha announces loudly. She shrugs when everybody turns to look at her. “If you’re here with a <em>friend. </em>Does it need to be a partner, per se?<em>” Just so we’re clear. </em></p><p>“Sure,” Nat says dryly, with an intrigued nod. “Find a spot on the floor with your <em> friend. </em>As long as you’re clear on your dynamics.”</p><p>Rio scowls at her while they shuffle toward a back corner of the studio.<br/><br/>“What a moment of clarity,” she mutters. “I’m sure our hetero queen Nat will beg you to go out with her now that you’ve publicly announced your availability.”<br/><br/>“Please,” Agatha huffs, untying her rope and rolling it back up into a manageable coil. “I’m just making sure they won’t expect us to get all lovey-dovey with each other.”<br/><br/>Rio barks out an unimpressed laugh. “Because, one, that would make <em> so </em> much sense during a masterclass,” she drawls sarcastically. “And, two, can you imagine us having to touch or kiss each other? The absolute horror.” She feigns a shiver, and Agatha knocks into her with a shoulder.<br/><br/>“Twenty dollars she’s bi,” Agatha whispers after giving Nat another quick once over from a distance.<br/><br/>“Twenty dollars she’s uninterested,” Rio quips, casually watching the female instructor’s movements while retying the elastic in her braid. Then her eyes flick back to Agatha.<br/><br/>“How about those dynamics? Who’s gonna go first?”<br/><br/>Agatha’s stomach clenches at the idea of giving up control, the idea of having to helplessly wait until Rio has tied her up as per someone else’s instruction.<br/>But they’d agreed to take turns, and she had convinced herself the whole ordeal would be educational regardless of her position. She had also imagined how much Rio would owe her if she’d let her do this just one time, and how willing she might become to bend to Agatha’s will in the future.<br/><br/>“You go first.” Agatha nods at Rio’s rope, hoping the other woman will consider this a sign of generosity and trust. In truth, Agatha had figured they would start off with something simple, so the tables would eventually turn once they’d get to the more intricate and immobilizing knots.<br/><br/>Rio takes the bait, going off the glimmer in her eyes.<br/><br/>“Alright,” Bruce announces loudly, standing up in front of the class, followed by Nat. “As always, safety first.”<br/><br/>The duo goes through a set of rules; margins for breathing and blood circulation, emergency scissors, consent, communication, checking in, and being conscious and careful about the ends of the rope. Agatha and Rio keep stealing glances at each other; curious to see if those precautions sound logical to the other, whether they are truly familiar with the material.<br/><br/>Nat gets up to fetch an expensive looking, velvety red rope from the bag that Bruce had been rummaging through earlier. She absentmindedly wraps one end around her fist while she talks.<br/><br/>“Individuals who will be practicing on a chair today; turn the backrest of the chair toward you. Couples; have your sub sit on their behind with their knees up, feet flat on the floor. We will start with the legs, just from the knees down, so you’ll have your hands free for this one. Feel free to lean back.”<br/><br/>“<em>Not a sub,” </em> Agatha says through gritted teeth, but loud enough for Nat to hear.<br/><br/>“Right, pardon me— and the <em> friend </em> who agrees to temporarily sub for the sake of practice,” Nat adds, a slight mocking tone in her voice.<br/><br/>The tips of Agatha’s ears turn pink and she gets in position anyway. She wants to claw Rio’s sudden smugness off her face with an urgent sense of friendly violence. Instead, she leans back on her hands and watches as Rio gets up on her knees, preparing the rope for use in what seems to be practiced fashion.<br/><br/>“If this is going to be anything like our drive up here, don’t think I’ll hesitate to gag you in front of all these people,” Rio says softly, a sweet smile on her face. Her words in combination with the eye contact make Agatha feel like a wild current is pulling her under, and she groans uncomfortably at the sensation.<br/><br/>“I expect not to hear a single word from you.” Again, with the gentle voice. Still, the words leave no room for uncertainty, and together with the confident, relaxed demeanor, they’re giving Agatha a mental whiplash.<br/><br/>Who does she think she is anyway? Giving out orders like that?<br/><br/>“I expect <em> you </em>to not pretend to be my Domme,” Agatha fires back. There’s another glint in Rio’s eyes. </p><p><br/><br/>What follows is ten excruciating minutes, in which Rio calmly and patiently copies the rope work, which Nat is performing on Bruce, on Agatha’s legs. Agatha silently reprimands herself for being surprised at that— she’s not sure why she had expected it to be the other way around. </p><p>Rather than paying attention to the technique, she uses up all of her focus to ignore the things that are happening to her body. It’s not just the way her calves dent upon them getting wrapped up in rope, or her loss of balance that comes with having her feet pressed together— it’s the mushy feeling in her stomach when she gauges Rio’s caring movements, making tight knots but always making sure to deliberately, slowly, pull the end through the loops she creates, to not hurt her with a piece of rope flying loose.<br/>It’s the tightening of her lungs when Rio forcefully tugs every anchor point taut, making the tendon in her forearm stand out, only to tentatively slide two fingers between Agatha’s leggings and the rope, checking for circulation.<br/>It’s the knitting of her brows which subconsciously mirrors Rio’s expression at a particularly hard angle, often accompanied by her bottom lip disappearing behind her front teeth.<br/><br/>It mesmerizes her so badly that even Nat’s voice is being drawn out, because who cares what <em> she’s </em> doing, Agatha needs to pay attention to her own legs before this amateurish idiot Domme in front of her fucks her up—<br/><br/>She’s <em> angry. </em> It’s the only fitting word; the rapid beating of her heart, her tensed abs and thighs, the slight tremor in the shoulder she’s put most of her weight on; it’s unbridled and untameable fury.<br/><em> Why </em> she’s angry, she isn’t quite sure yet, but it probably has to do with that stupid amount of tension in her body. Isn’t Rio, her interim rigger, fake-ass pseudo con artist, fraud of a self-proclaimed Domme, supposed to make her feel comfortable? Huh? <em> It’s all about the sub, Rio, </em>she sneers at her in her mind. </p><p>“Stunning work,” Nat remarks as she walks by, pointing at the neat bow Rio finished up with.<br/><br/>“Stunning work,” Agatha repeats when Nat is out of earshot, a half assed attempt at mimicking her accent. “I look like a strung up beef tenderloin. For Christmas,” she adds, flicking the bow with a finger.<br/><br/>“Is that envy I hear?” Rio grins, completely immune to Agatha’s attack on her confidence. She sits down on her heels and leans ever so slightly forward, enveloping Agatha’s tied up ankles with her warm hands. “Wish you could be <em> this </em> good?”<br/><br/>Agatha scoffs. “Your anchoring is weak. A paraplegic could break out of this.”<br/><br/>Rio’s hands leave her ankles and she places them back on her own thighs with a slap. “Go on, try. But no hands.”<br/><br/>Agatha rolls her eyes at such a <em> juvenile </em> request, but sure, she will—<br/><br/>She won’t.<br/><br/>“Okay, <em> fine,” </em> she admits with a growl, when Rio’s expression at her futile struggles becomes more embarrassing than the fact that she can’t break free. “Astounding work. Unbelievable. Never in <em> history </em> have I seen such craftsmanship. I’d give you a standing ovation if I could, but I can’t, so untie me—”<br/><br/>“You’re too kind,” Rio squeals mockingly with a hand on her chest.<br/>“Can’t untie you yet, sweetheart. I’m awaiting further instructions.”<br/><br/>“Such a teacher’s pet,” Agatha jeers. “If you’re so desperate to be a good girl, I find it hard to imagine you have even a single dominant bone in your body.”<br/><br/>Rio snickers, covers her mouth with her hand and shakes her head.<br/><br/>“What?”<br/><br/>“Just wait until you’ll feel my dominant bone in <em> your </em> body.”<br/><br/>As Rio bursts out in laughter, Agatha stares off into the distance, nearly going cross eyed.<br/>She’s ready to tap out right then and there.<br/><br/>“Beautiful work everybody,” Nat interrupts her impending lack of will to live. “Now please untie your subs and check in with them; even in practice it’s important to help them through that. Neatly coil up your rope and get ready for the second technique. We will dive in a little deeper; next up is a pentagram harness for the upper body. Switches, this is the moment to swap positions.”<br/>She turns and kneels to untie Bruce’s legs.<br/><br/>“You heard the lady,” Agatha says, impatiently nodding at her own legs.<br/>Rio raises an amused eyebrow.<br/><br/>“So you identify as a switch?”<br/><br/>“I identify as a fist to your nose if you don’t hurry up.” </p><p>The look on Rio’s face stays there for the entire duration of the untying. Rio gathers the rope as Agatha makes a show of stretching her legs, determined to let people know that this <em> isn’t something she’s used to.  </em></p><p>Bruce instructs the subs to choose a position they’re comfortable in, either on their knees or on their ass. Rio opts to sit on her knees, but when she catches Agatha’s look, she untucks her legs and chooses to cross her legs in front of her instead.<br/><br/>While Bruce gives the group a few pointers before they start, and it’s probably something important, blah-blah-blah, Agatha fiddles with her own rope and looks at Rio as if she’s a lioness on the prowl and Rio just helpless prey. </p><p>Rio cocks an unimpressed eyebrow as she looks around the room, making Agatha follow her gaze; every person who is about to be tied up has their arms raised as their partners start securing the first loop around their bodies, just like how Nat has done with Bruce.<br/><br/>But not Rio.<br/><br/>“Well?” Agatha presses. “Why aren’t your arms up?”<br/><br/>“You have to <em> ask, </em> Agatha. Didn’t you listen to Bruce?”<br/><br/>Agatha clacks her tongue. “I don’t understand why you got to listen to Nat and I got instructions from <em> him.” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “Are you gonna complain about it or are you gonna get on with it?”<br/><br/>“You’re supposed to raise your arms!”<br/><br/>“You’re supposed to <em> ask!” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “What’s the problem, ladies?” Nat’s warm voice draws close.<br/><br/>“Just teaching her to be an attentive Domme, is all,” Rio says before Agatha can answer. <em> That little bitch.  </em></p><p>“It seems you haven’t quite gained your sub’s trust yet,” Nat turns to Agatha. “Do you have any idea why that is?”<br/><br/>“Because she’s a spoiled, insolent, <em> demonic </em> son of a—”<br/><br/>“Would you lift your arms for me, dear?” Nat interrupts her, directing her question at Rio, who smiles sweetly and obeys by, ever so slowly, placing her hands on her head without breaking eye contact.<br/><br/>“There you go. It’s that easy.” Nat nods approvingly at Rio, and gives Agatha a quick wink before she moves on.<br/><br/>Rio is blushing again, and so is Agatha, but both for entirely different reasons.<br/><br/>Agatha exhales slowly and cracks her knuckles, needing just a moment to compose herself before wrapping the woman in front of her in a potentially lethal harness. Before she begins, she captures Rio’s gaze one more time.<br/><br/>“I <em> do </em> hope you trust me not to harm you,” she softly speaks out. A corner of Rio’s mouth curves up.<br/><br/>“Don’t worry, I do trust your competence with the material. I just like to point out where your perception of dynamics could use some work.”<br/><br/>Agatha clenches her fist and wonders if there’s a way to wrap the rope around Rio’s jaw to muzzle her mouth shut.<br/>“Listen— I bit my tongue about eight million times while you practiced, because you asked me to. Do you think you could grant me the same courtesy?”<br/><br/>Rio nods slowly, once. And Agatha gets to work. </p><p> </p><p>With a few smooth movements, she wraps the rope around Rio’s torso as instructed. She tries not to get distracted by her scent or skin or by what she knows her sports bra is hiding— which proves to be quite difficult, as the harness she is creating is specifically designed to put one's chest on display. It’s usually supposed to be done on a bare body, but for the sake of practice she’s quite happy for everyone to be wearing clothes.<br/><br/>As she expertly loops the rope over Rio’s shoulder, under her opposite arm, and back through the valley of her breasts, she becomes more and more aware of how close she has to get to execute the technique properly. Some angles or knots require her to put her weight into it or to bring both of her arms around Rio’s chest, and she often finds either her face pressed into Rio’s neck, or Rio’s breath ghosting over her own throat.<br/><br/>“Stop that,” she hisses in Rio’s ear, after one of her soft groans sends a shiver down her spine.<br/><br/>“Can’t help it,” she softly whines, batting her eyelashes at Agatha while her hands still rest on top of her head. “It’s <em>so tight.” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> Agatha sighs and knows she has no choice but to ask. “Does anything hurt?”<br/>She starts checking for herself, gauging the tension on the rope near the knots, feeling for any possible chafing.<br/><br/>“Just your ego, I imagine,” Rio shrugs, with the little freedom her shoulders still have. “When I tell you that you messed up that last loop.”<br/><br/>Agatha frantically compares her work to Nat’s, chewing on her bottom lip in anticipation of finding her mistake so she can rectify it.<br/><br/>“I don’t see—”<br/><br/>“Just kidding.”<br/><br/>Agatha’s eyes flash, something inside of her snaps, and on impulse, she grabs one of the wrists on Rio’s head and twists it behind her back. She leans in from behind and whispers: “If you’re so set on convincing me you’re nothing but a Domme, why can’t you stop being a fucking brat all the time? Let me tell you this once more, Rio. If you behave like one, you’re giving me permission to treat you like one.”<br/><br/>Rio inhales sharply and lets out a soft: “Oh.”<br/><br/>Agatha tightens her grip, and she feels Rio leaning into her. “I’d seriously consider my options here if I were you, because the day you make me tame you, is the day you’re going to regret every <em> ounce </em> of retaliation you’ve ever shown me. You won’t be able to properly sit down for <em> days; </em>your ass is going to be such a beautiful shade of—” </p><p>“Ladies! Are we getting distracted?” Nat calls over to them. Agatha looks up and watches Nat shake her head in reprimand. She stalks closer so just the two of them can hear her. “If you want to turn this into something sexual, you’re allowed to do so in private. After this class.” She looks both of them over and adds: “Even if you’re <em> just friends</em>.”<br/><br/>“I am <em> so sorry, </em> Nat,<em>” </em> Agatha says in a sultry voice, leaning back from where she was breathing down Rio’s neck, releasing her wrist. “My brat was acting up. I was just gently correcting her behavior.”<br/><br/>She feels a sharp pinch on her arm at the words “<em>my brat</em>," but keeps smiling through the pain.<br/><br/>“You could be my friend<em>, </em> you know,” she casually flirts with the redhead. “I bet you’d be way better behaved than this one.”<br/><br/>Nat chuckles lowly. “Nice try, dear. Unfortunately, I have a thing for Latinas.” This time, she winks at Rio, before turning back around and leaving Agatha slack-jawed.<br/><br/>Rio can’t contain her giggles to save her life. “You owe me a twenty,” she snickers. “Very clearly not interested.”<br/><br/>Agatha exhales sharply through her nose. “Yeah. Well. Also very clearly bi. So.” She purses her lips and shrugs, pretending her ego wasn’t just smashed to shatters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Without many more words, Agatha finishes her work. She can’t deny Rio looks delicious like this— even with the harness over her clothes. She would definitely not mind repeating the same knots on her, somewhere more private and more naked. Oh, she would consume her like a fucking meal, make her come, then have her again for dessert.<br/><br/>After her final knot, a neat pentagram is on display on Rio’s chest. It sits a little bit awkward around her breasts because of the layers of fabric, but it’s not hard to imagine what it’s supposed to do to a body without clothes.<br/>She tucks away the last bit of the rope and catches herself just in time when she, on autopilot, is about to lean in for a kiss.<br/><br/>What the hell was that?<br/><br/>Since Agatha is the last person to finish her harness, she doesn’t get to enjoy the view for very long before they’re all being instructed to untie their subs.<br/><br/>“Shame,” she mutters, while leaning in to Rio’s front to carefully unwrap her. Rio hums noncommittally.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As she rolls up her rope, Agatha expects Bruce and Nat to get straight into aftercare. But what she hadn’t accounted for was a third exercise, and with a pang of shock and regret, she realizes that it’s her turn to get tied up again. </p><p>“This one is going to be more tricky,” Nat warns the group. “We’re going to attempt complete immobilization, for those who dare.”<br/><br/>And if <em> stupid </em> Nat hadn’t phrased it like that, she might’ve been able to talk herself out of it— but if it’s a matter of bravery, if she’s being dared to do something, she can't just walk away.<br/><br/>They’re instructed to wait for Nat and Bruce until she has fully tied him up this time, just so they can see the end result first.<br/>Nat takes her time with it, using two different ropes: with the first one, she ties his thighs to his calves while he lays down on his back, forcing his knees to bend. Then she helps him up into a kneeling position and uses the second rope to rig his upper body. When she’s done, a set of vertical knots adorn his chest and his spine. His arms aren’t wrapped, but from the way the rope tightens his shoulders, he doesn’t seem to be able to move them from their position behind his back. </p><p>There’s a shy applause from most people when Nat tightens the final knot, but Agatha is too busy keeping her eyes from falling from their sockets. Bruce looks like the ultimate sub like this, his entire body covered in rope. There is no way, <em> no way </em> she’s gonna let Rio—<br/><br/>“So, do you dare?” Rio asks, having picked her own rope back up and giving it a playful tug. “Or are you gonna chicken out?”<br/><br/>Welp. She doesn’t really have a choice now, does she?<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Rio gets to work, Agatha feels herself starting to dissociate right from the start. It must be the only way through, really, for someone who is meant to <em> do the goddamn rigging </em>instead<em>. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> But Rio, being the insufferable softie that she is, picks up on Agatha’s semi-voluntary submission pretty quickly.<br/><br/>“Agatha? Can you give me a traffic light color?” she asks tentatively, halfway through the rope around her legs. She doesn’t look like she’s entirely sure if Agatha will pick up on what she’s asking; they haven’t discussed any form of safewording yet, but apparently now, during a masterclass of all moments, Rio feels the need to bring it up. Considerate idiot.<br/><br/>“Green,” Agatha forces out. She’s not unfamiliar with safewording, even as a Domme she has used yellow and red on occasion. But right at this moment, she’s able to convince herself that she isn’t in any actual danger, and so she’ll power through.<br/><br/>Rio takes her in for a moment and nods, deciding to trust Agatha’s ability to set her own boundaries.<br/><br/>“Just so you know, you owe me big time,” Agatha informs her in an attempt to lighten up the tension, both in the air and in her own muscles.<br/><br/>“Yeah?” Rio breathes, while helping Agatha up to sit on her knees. Her lower body is done, so Rio moves onto using Agatha's rope to wrap her upper body in. “I’d definitely owe you more if you’d relax a little bit, you know. This won’t be comfortable if you keep holding on to your sense of control so badly.”<br/><br/>Agatha wants to either punch or kiss her at that gentle tone in her voice, she hasn't decided yet.<br/>Of fucking course she is going to hold on to every last bit of control, what else is there to do?</p><p>And yes, true power lies with the sub anyway, she knows, just like she always reminds her own subs before a session. <em> So what happened to that, Rio? Aren’t you supposed to make me feel good?  </em></p><p>But she doesn’t feel good. She feels… livid. Every point of contact sets ablaze with Rio’s touch. Losing the autonomy over her individual arms and legs shoots up a sting of electricity right through her glutes and further up, up, up, into the back of her neck where it cracks and sizzles, every time she unintentionally wiggles one of her tied up limbs.<br/>And Rio’s caring fucking nature drives her up the wall and back, <em> if only she could move, </em> that is.<br/><br/>She locks eyes with Rio, who’s eyebrows twitch in a silent question: ‘<em>are you okay?’ </em><br/>And fuck. It takes barely another second for Agatha to be filled with an immeasurable desire to throw Rio onto her back, to touch every piece of skin she can reach, to rip those stupidly tight leggings open at the crotch and to fill her wet cunt up, driving three of her fingers into her, again, and again, and again—<br/><br/>Wait. Is that <em> really </em> what that feeling is? That tingling sensation whenever Rio’s fingers brush against the exposed skin of her neck and her arms, those little pin pricks she feels when Rio firmly tugs on a knot…<br/><br/>Her imagination, wherein she’d been roughly fucking Rio until just now, quickly shifts like a switch has been flicked. All of a sudden, <em> she </em> is the one on her back, still tied up, still debilitated by both the rope around her body and a tight string around her fuzzy brain. And Rio is fucking into <em> her </em> now, relentless, a maddening pace, the tendon in her forearm popping at the amount of force she uses, and, <em> oh god, </em> she craves the soft brushes of Rio's fingers in between, those caresses, her kisses, the sweet nothings…<br/><br/>“Fuck me,” Agatha desperately breathes out, but her brain catches up right while the plea leaves her lips, making only the consonants audible. She hopes that, to Rio, it just sounds like a pained groan. </p><p>“Hey, where does it hurt?” Rio asks, which, bingo, she’ll hop onto that train.<br/><br/>“Legs,” Agatha mumbles, unceremoniously dropping herself onto her back. Rio wastes no time loosening up the knots around her knees, the fastest way to give her some wiggle room.<br/><br/>Agatha feigns a relieved sigh as her knees fall open, but she can’t hold the act up for very long; the distinct smell of her own arousal reaches her nose, and her eyes almost bulge out. She slams her legs shut in shock, which only makes it worse, as it sends another wave of her scent through the air.<br/><br/>She’s almost too embarrassed to make eye contact with Rio, but when she realizes the other woman has stopped moving altogether, she can’t help but look up at her.<br/><br/>Rio’s pupils are blown, fixed on the spot between Agatha’s thighs. She languidly inhales through her nose, but her lips are parted. With the end of the rope still in her hand, she seems frozen, mid-motion, and it takes another glance at her line of sight for Agatha to realize that her scent probably isn’t the only proof of her arousal.<br/>Now that her attention is back in her own underwear, she’s aware of how slick she feels, and consequently deduces that there must be a visible wet spot in her leggings.<br/><br/>Rio swallows and asks hoarsely: “...anything else uncomfortable?” </p><p>“‘Mfine,” Agatha dismisses her, and neither woman believes that she is, in fact, fine.<br/><br/>For a few seconds, Rio pretends to pick up where she left off, despite Agatha laying down now. She weaves the rope around itself in a useless attempt to look like she isn’t completely off her game, before she drops both the act and the rope and softly utters something really fucking unexpected.<br/><br/>“Fuck, I want to have you like this, Agatha.”<br/><br/>Agatha feels her pussy clench and she gasps, not sure which feeling is stronger: horniness from Rio’s words, or relief from the fact that she isn’t the only one affected by their predicament. She can’t help but silently wish for a peek at Rio’s crotch, just to confirm that it’s not just her who has gotten embarrassingly wet.<br/><br/>“I think we’re done,” Agatha breathes, to break them out of their staring contest. Rio nods in agreement, quickly—but still in a caring matter—helping Agatha out of her restraints.<br/><br/>When everyone else is finished, Bruce and Nat guide them through some gentle aftercare, emphasizing the importance of it— but Agatha and Rio’s minds have both drifted off somewhere far from here. When they check each other for bruises or rashes, probing joints and tendons, there’s something almost clinical to it.<br/><br/>“Thank you for joining us today,” Nat speaks to the group. “We hope you’ve learned some interesting new techniques and we fully encourage you to keep exploring in your free time— all safe, sane, and consensual of course.”<br/><br/>The other participants murmur their thanks and as they exit toward the dressing rooms, Nat turns to Agatha and Rio.<br/><br/>“Looks like you two definitely have some exploring to do,” she says ambiguously. “But I will say: it’s truly heartwarming to see such good friends partaking in our class.” </p><p>As she walks off, Agatha inhales sharply and turns to Rio.<br/><br/>“So! I could eat a horse. Dinner?”<br/><br/>“Dinner.”</p>

<p>After sharing a quick meal at the first decent looking burger shack they come across, Agatha eyes Rio up, who sighs, slumps down in her seat, and puts a hand on her full belly.<br/><br/>“So, how do you feel about the drive back?” Agatha casually inquires, dabbing her mouth with a napkin.<br/><br/>Rio groans. “I get really bad after-dinner dips from carbs.” Her head dramatically lolls to the side. “Give me thirty minutes, or an energy drink. You know what— both.”<br/><br/>Agatha winces at the idea. “I can drive us back, dear.”<br/><br/>“<em>Absolutely not. </em> There’s no doctor I would trust with putting my body back together the way it was after you’ve driven us through a brick wall.”<br/><br/>“So dramatic,” Agatha sighs, but her face breaks into a smile. She has her exactly where she wants her. “We could just go for the safest option, and get a hotel. Did you bring a toothbrush?” </p><p>“Agatha, I don’t do sleepovers.”<br/><br/>“Well, then we’ll get two separate rooms.”<br/><br/>“Are you paying?”<br/><br/>“Sure. I’ll get dinner too.” Agatha puts her credit card between her index and middle finger, flashing it at Rio, who cocks an eyebrow.<br/><br/>“Are we finally at a solid enough level in our <em> friendship </em> for you to tell me what you do for a living?”<br/><br/>“I told you, I work for the—”<br/><br/>“For the government. And what do you <em> do </em> for the government?”<br/><br/>“Don’t be nosy.” She slides out of the booth and taps Rio’s nose with the corner of the card. “Just say: thank you, Agatha.” </p><p>Rio shrugs and takes her phone from her pocket, unlocking it to read her messages. Agatha crosses her arms, still standing next to the booth. After a solid twenty seconds of Rio scrolling on her phone, she looks up with a questioning look on her face.<br/><br/>“What are you wai— oh for fuck’s sake. <em> Thank you, Agatha,” </em> she says with a healthy dose of reluctance.<br/><br/>“Wasn’t so hard, was it?” Agatha grins, before turning on her heel to take care of the bill. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Since she is paying, Rio agrees to bless Agatha with the task of selecting a hotel.</p><p>It takes them forever to navigate the crowded New York streets in Agatha’s SUV, and so Rio starts complaining.</p><p>”We should’ve taken Victoria. I would’ve squeezed us right past all traffic in minutes.”</p><p>”And give us a concussion when you lose balance on that ridiculous bike? Merci, but no.”</p><p>“You don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Agatha makes Rio pull up to the valet parking of the hotel of her choice, a tall building from a cute little franchise called Rosewood.<br/><br/>“The <em> Carlyle?” </em> Rio’s eyes almost pop out of their sockets. “Do you scam people for a living? Or are you the secret love child of a deceased rock star?”<br/><br/>“Dead on.”<br/><br/>After Rio hands over the keys to the valet driver, still with a baffled expression on her face, she follows Agatha into the lobby. Agatha revels in Rio’s reaction; loves that she can make an impression like this.<br/><br/>“Good evening,” the young host at the reception greets them. Agatha frowns at his badge that says <em> intern. </em> She motions for Rio to stay behind her as she leans her elbow on the desk. <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “Hello, teen,” she says flatly, quickly folding a five dollar bill around her credit card before sliding it over to him. “I <em> bet </em> there’s only one room left, isn’t there?”<br/><br/>“Would that be for tonight, ma’am?”<br/><br/>“No, Christmas Eve 2032. Yes, for tonight, teen.”<br/><br/>“Excuse me for a moment while I check our availability.”<br/><br/>Agatha turns around to bashfully shrug at Rio, who is quietly taking in the luxurious space.<br/><br/>“I have some excellent news for you, ma’am. We have plenty of rooms left. How many were you looking to–”<br/><br/>“You sure?” Agatha says through gritted teeth, glancing down at the five dollar bill. “Are you <em> absolutely sure </em> there isn’t just one room left?”<br/><br/>The intern nervously looks up at her, at the fiver on the desk, to the computer, and back at Agatha.<br/><br/>“Did you… did you want to book just one room?”<br/><br/>Agatha slams her palm on the desk. “Awe, are you kidding me?!” she says loudly, and whirls around to Rio with a flourish. “Well then, I guess we have no other option than to get that <em> one room you have left!” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “Naturally, ma’am,” the intern nods with a slight tremor in his eyebrow. He looks back at the screen in front of him and makes a few clicks.<br/><br/>“Would you prefer two twin beds, a double, a queen or a–”<br/><br/>“And it’s got a <em> double bed?!” </em> she shrieks, throwing her hands up in surrender. She quickly plucks another five dollar bill from her wallet and flashes it in front of the intern while turning back to Rio, shaking her head with an open mouth. “Just our luck!”<br/><br/>“Actually, ma’am, there are plenty of options–”<br/><br/>“–available at the complimentary breakfast buffet for our inconvenience? How thoughtful, teen. We’ll take the double room please.”<br/><br/>“I will have to charge you for the breakfast,” the intern mumbles under his breath, to which Agatha quietly hisses: “Just put it on the bill and shut up.” </p><p>The intern picks up the credit card and the two five dollar bills, and starts entering her information into the computer.<br/><br/>“E. Harkness?” he wants to confirm. Agatha nods quickly, leaning in on the desk once more. “Yeah, yeah, that’s me. Where do I sign? I’d like to use the room before the night is over, boy.”<br/><br/>He looks up at her once more, visibly growing less and less impressed with her, but decides to swallow his commentary in favor of the tip. After putting the card through the machine, he hands her a device she can use to digitally put down the signature that she flawlessly forges.<br/><br/>“Room 1811, on the eighteenth floor,” he informs her, handing her a keycard. “My colleague over here can help you bring up your luggage–”<br/><br/>“No need, teen, we didn’t bring much,” she says, lifting her small bag. “Thank you for your outstanding service.”<br/><br/>When she faces Rio again, she seems just as unimpressed with her as the receptionist.<br/><br/>“Only one room left, huh?” she says with her arms crossed. Agatha rolls her eyes and starts walking toward the elevators.<br/><br/>“Rio, I tried <em> everything. </em>The boy is just too damn stubborn. You’ll survive— I don’t snore.” </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Once the two women get settled in their small but fancy hotel room, Agatha isn’t quite sure how to move onto the next step of her plan. Sharing a room with Rio had, once again, been her clit’s idea, but now that she made it here, it feels weird to just take initiative. </p><p>“I’m gonna take a shower,” Rio announces to Agatha’s relief, and when she hears the shower running, she tries really hard not to imagine what Rio would look like. Naked. And wet.<br/><br/>Nope.<br/><br/>Instead, she decides to order a bottle of wine, take off her clothes and change into one of the fluffy white robes, and discard her contacts to replace them with her glasses.<br/><br/>By the time Rio has finished her shower, Agatha is sitting up against the headboard, mindlessly scrolling away on her phone.<br/><br/>“Shower’s free, if you want to,” Rio says while re-entering the bedroom.<br/><br/>“Are you trying to tell me that I stink?”<br/>She looks up from her phone and feels her throat go dry at the sight of Rio in a robe, drying her wet hair with a towel in one hand.<br/><br/>“Yes,” Rio deadpans, and snorts when Agatha pretends to be hurt. “Hey– you do you. I just figured you’d want to freshen up, if we’re going to… you know.”<br/><br/>Agatha smirks, intrigued.<br/><br/>“If we’re going to share a bed.”<br/><br/>“Ah.” Agatha kicks her legs off the bed and leaves her phone and her glass of wine on the nightstand. “Sure. I’ll go take a shower for you. Didn’t peg you for a cuddler.”<br/><br/>“I just don’t want your dirty body in my bed.”<br/><br/>“Copy that. No dirtiness in the bed. Help yourself to a glass of wine, dear. My treat.” She nods at the bottle and the wine glasses on the cart before stepping into the bathroom, leaving the door open just a crack— for air circulation, of course.<br/><br/>When she’s done and steps back out, Rio is already in bed; perched up against the headboard but her legs under the covers, still in her robe and with her damp hair up in a messy bun. As soon as she clocks Agatha, she slurps wine from her glass and sighs loudly.<br/><br/>It’s disgustingly domestic. This wasn’t what Agatha had in mind when she suggested getting a hotel room on a whim.</p><p>She almost wants to projectile vomit all over the bed.<br/><br/>But then she registers what Rio is holding: it’s the end of her black rope. The other end seems to be leading toward her own legs under the covers. Okay, less domestic.<br/><br/>Agatha decides to ignore it until she gets on the other side of the bed, taking a large gulp from her glass of wine.<br/><br/>“Going through the study material again, goody two-shoes?” she says in a challenging voice.<br/>Rio doesn’t bite, or get flustered, or stammer, or give any other reaction that would’ve satisfied Agatha.<br/><br/>“Yeah,” she simply says. “I saw Nat doing a particular knot in the end that I wanted to try for myself.” She scrunches her face in frustration as she tugs on the rope around her thighs.<br/><br/>Agatha’s not sure she has ever shared a bed with such an annoying person. If Rio wants to practice <em> Nat’s fucking knot </em> right now, then Rio should practice Nat’s fucking knot right now.<br/><br/>“Well, turn the lights off when you’re done. I’m about to close my eyes for the night.” She takes her glasses off, slides deeper under the covers and defiantly turns onto her side with her back to Rio.<br/><br/>“You’re still wearing your robe.”<br/><br/>“You’re still talking.”<br/><br/>“You’re seeking attention.”<br/><br/>“And you’re <em> still </em>talking.” </p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything after that, but she does grunt or sigh audibly every now and then. After five minutes, Agatha twists her upper body toward Rio; a murderous expression on her face.<br/><br/>“Can I <em> help </em> you?”<br/><br/>Rio loops the rope around her legs one more time, her tongue poking out in concentration.<br/>“So kind of you! But thanks, I’m okay,” Rio says sweetly.<br/><br/>“It wasn’t a question,” Agatha grumbles. She wonders if there’s a way to gag Rio for the rest of the night.<br/><br/>“Oh! No, but really, I’m okay,” Rio emphasizes, making no effort to finish up. Agatha slowly reaches her boiling point.<br/><br/>“Would you mind continuing in the bathroom then? Some of us are trying to sleep.” </p><p>“I would mind, actually.”<br/><br/>“Again, not a question.”<br/><br/>“Again, I’m perfectly fine right here.”<br/><br/>“Oh my god!” Agatha snaps. She fights the blanket to free her arm, and snatches the rope from Rio’s grasp. “Can you just— <em> not?” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> “Why, Agatha?” Rio asks calmly, lifting a single eyebrow. “Are you finding it hard to watch me?”<br/><br/>“You’re noisy,” Agatha bristles. “You’re moaning and huffing and <em> breathing, </em> you sound like a fucking porn star.”<br/><br/>“I wouldn’t stop you from masturbating, if that’s what you’re concerned about,” Rio smirks. “Just curious how noisy that would make <em> you.” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> Agatha stares daggers at her, her fist still wrapped around the rope. She doesn’t like the taunting look on Rio’s face one bit— if she’s not allowed to do anything about it, that is.<br/><br/>“Rio,” she says with a clenched jaw, but gets utterly distracted by the way she sees the other woman’s breath catch. Her eyes flicker toward the small piece of her chest that is visible between the lapels of her robe.<br/><br/>“Rio,” she starts again, but doesn’t progress beyond that this time either. Her eyes meet Rio’s again, and what does she read in there if not an invitation to make her go wild?</p><p>”Let me do it,” she whispers her suggestion, her thighs tensing up at the idea. </p><p>“Ha,” Rio barks out. “No.” She softly tugs on the rope to retrieve it from Agatha’s hand, but her grip tightens. </p><p>“Come on,” Agatha smiles naughtily, the image of tying Rio up earlier that day flashing by in her mind’s eye. Her mouth starts watering and she pulls back on the rope. “Let me.” </p><p>“No,” Rio says again, less convinced, but strengthening her words by tugging more firmly. It only causes Agatha to lunge forward, and she quickly scrambles back to put more weight into it.<br/><br/>It takes three more pulls in their tug-of-war—Agatha, Rio, then Agatha again—for Rio to give the rope such a rough jerk, it reels Agatha in all the way. She flies forward and lands onto Rio’s chest with a low groan, the rope still tightly clutched in the hand she uses to keep herself up, her face mere inches from Rio.<br/><br/>“Oh,” she says breathlessly, her fingertips starting to brush against Rio’s neck and chest out of their own accord. When she runs a knuckle over her jaw, Rio’s fingers close around her wrist, making Agatha look up.<br/><br/>“Yeah, fuck,” Rio sighs in surrender, losing an inward battle against herself. “I’m going to need you to kiss me,” she says almost matter-of-factly.<br/><br/>Agatha’s eyes are so locked onto her lips as she speaks, she almost completely misses the message. “Huh?”<br/><br/>“Agatha, kiss me. Right now, please.” This time, Agatha receives the message loud and clear. She pushes herself up just a bit more so she can reach Rio’s lips with her own— and wraps her fingers around the back of her skull to catch her in a searing kiss. Every little bit of tension that had just been strung taut between them is being funneled into their desperate kiss, again and again. Agatha inhales her, needs the feel of her lips, the smell of her skin— and keeps pressing her entire body further up against her.<br/><br/>Any reservations, any voices telling her ‘<em>I shouldn’t,’ </em>or <em>‘I’m above this,’ </em>or <em>‘she can’t give me what I want,’ </em>dissolve within mere seconds, and her bodily instincts take over in an attempt to just get <em>more</em> of Rio, Rio, Rio. It’s a quick fix, she is well aware, but the way her body screams for Rio can’t be ignored— and she knows how bad it can get when she tries anyway.<br/><br/>And the way the other woman melts under her touch and her body weight isn’t helping either. Agatha feels like enveloping her, shielding her from everyone and everything, keeping her to herself so that only she can kiss her and pleasure her, drive her crazy to the point where she can only ask for more.<br/><br/><em>More, more, </em>her mind echoes. </p><p>Rio deepens the kiss and is anything but shy about it: “Come on, kiss me like you mean it,” she whispers against Agatha’s lips, whose vision starts to blur as she sloppily slides her tongue into Rio’s mouth to get a better taste.<br/>Agatha finally lets go of the rope and slides one hand into damp hair—<em>and why is that so sexy on her?—</em>as her other hand fists the fabric of one side of the robe Rio wears, desperate to uncover more skin.<br/><br/>Rio exhales on a low, throaty sound as Agatha’s nails lightly scratch the skin between her breasts. The sound is so disarming that Agatha breaks free from the kiss to drop her head against Rio’s neck, once again deeply inhaling her scent between planting wet kisses on her skin. Rio’s hands find her waist in a firm grip, but quickly slide down to cup her ass over the robe. She squeezes firmly and uses Agatha’s surprised jolt to press their lower bodies together even more, which proves to be a difficult task with both of their robes and the duvet separating them.</p><p>“Oh, shit,” Agatha groans as she feels her pussy starting to throb. There really is no fighting the gravitational pull of the woman below her. She temporarily leans back to grab onto the duvet and snatch it from between them, draping it on top of them instead. She uses the few seconds of not consuming Rio, to gather her thoughts.<br/><br/>She is very, very clear to herself about what she wants, what she’s wanted for weeks now, but has always accepted the improbability of it happening. But why? Why wouldn’t she just fight for what she wants?<br/><br/>“Rio,” she croons, shuffling closer to her and pulling the duvet up until it covers both their heads. Rio chuckles at the makeshift tent and Agatha uses their renewed close proximity to pull her in for another filthy kiss. It elicits another delicious moan from Rio, who is clearly becoming impatient as her hands are everywhere in search of Agatha’s robe’s tie.<br/><br/>“Sub for me,” she asks in between kisses, “Please, Rio. Sub for me<em>.” </em><br/><br/>She somehow manages to make it sound determined instead of desperate. “I’ll make you feel so good, <em> so good, </em> I want to— oh god, Rio, the things I want to <em> do to you…” </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> Agatha almost gets lost in her fantasies, but is shaken up by Rio’s persistent “<em>No.” </em><br/><br/>Agatha grunts at that and their lips connect again, pouring all of their respective conviction and defiance into the kiss. Agatha feels the lack of oxygen from being under the duvet getting to her head.<br/><br/>“Rio, please,” she murmurs quietly, nipping at her bottom lip. “You’d be such a—”<br/><em> What would Rio want to hear? </em></p><p>
<em>A good sub? A good pet? A good brat? </em>
</p><p><em><br/></em> <em> “— </em> good boy for me.”<br/><br/>Bullseye. Rio shivers, groans, and bucks her hips up into Agatha, looking for friction.<br/><br/>“I’m not subbing for you, Agatha,” she strains with her eyes closed. “I won’t let you play with me, unless you can prove you can be soft with me.”<br/><br/>Agatha blinks at that, stops kissing her for a moment, and finally folds the duvet back so they can properly breathe. “What are you— what are you saying?”<br/><br/>Rio opens her eyes again and reaches up at her, brushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear, before cupping her cheeks.<br/><br/>“If you so desperately want to play with me, you’re gonna have to earn my trust. And you’ve got a long way to go, hot stuff.”<br/><br/>“Does that mean you’d be willing to…” Agatha trails off, the horny-alarm in her brain blaring so loudly she can’t form a coherent thought anymore.<br/><br/>“Hey, focus,” Rio chuckles, snapping her fingers twice in front of her face. “Only what’s happening <em> now </em> is relevant. And I’m telling you; I want you to prove you can be soft with me.”<br/><br/>Agatha whines, drops her head and rubs her nose against Rio’s temple while she contemplates what that means; what she should and shouldn’t do.<br/><br/>“I won’t sub, but I <em> can </em>be a bottom,” Rio clarifies with a sultry voice, grazing her teeth over Agatha’s earlobe. “So it’s up to you, really. Take my offer, or turn around and go to sleep.” </p><p>Agatha, despite herself, jumps at the opportunity. “I’m taking the offer.” </p><p>And while she dives back into a kiss, chasing Rio’s tongue with her own in an attempt to turn her on even more with anticipation, she wonders how she should go about this.<br/><br/>Rio is very clear about not subbing, meaning Agatha doesn’t have her permission to dominate her. Which is— <em> fine, </em> still. Excruciating, but <em> fine. </em><br/>But if she’s willing to bottom, at least Agatha can still take the lead, deciding when and how she gets her pleasure. And Agatha loves giving, <em> loves </em> being a top, but can she do it without accidentally having a little discipline slip out? Without challenging her to misbehave, without daring her to obey?<br/><em> Where does topping turn into dominating? </em> Where does Rio draw that line?<br/><br/>“Wait,” Agatha says, reluctantly but purposely distancing herself from Rio. She might be a menace to society, but in this world, her special little world of dominating and discipline, the rules are important— because they just <em> make sense. </em>She just needs to be sure that Rio is on the same page.<br/><br/>“You want me to be soft? We’re talking safety first,” she says hoarsely, placing a palm on Rio’s chest to keep herself from leaning back in.<br/>Rio nods, excitement creeping over her face. Agatha realizes that excitement comes from things getting <em> real, </em> and she feels herself heating up. Oh god, she needs her. <em> Soon. </em><br/><br/>If Rio is a seasoned Domme, this conversation shouldn’t take long anyway.<br/><br/>“Alright,” Agatha purses her lips. “So, traffic light works for you?”<br/><br/>Rio nods eagerly. “Yeah. Green means go. Yellow means check in. Red means stop,” she clarifies.<br/><br/>Agatha feels her breathing speed up. “Can I fuck you? Can I go down on you? Is there anywhere you don’t want me to touch you?”<br/><br/>“Yes, fuck yes, and no.”<br/><br/>While Agatha fires questions at her, Rio frees her legs from the rope that’s still partly wrapped around herself.<br/><br/>“Can I tie you up?”<br/><br/>“No.”<br/><br/>“Can I talk you through it?”<br/><br/>“Hmm. Yes.”<br/><br/>“Can I edge you?”<br/><br/>Rio’s eyes flicker mischievously. “I don’t know, <em>can you?” </em><br/><br/>“For fuck’s sake, Rio, I wanna get started— <em> may </em> I edge you?”<br/><br/>“Yeah. I might not like it though.”<br/><br/>“Can I punish you?”<br/><br/>“No.”<br/><br/>“Can I tell you what to do?”<br/><br/>“You can certainly try, but don’t think I won’t tell <em> you </em> what to do.”<br/><br/>“Can I spank you?”<br/><br/>Rio thinks about that one for a moment.<br/>“Not if you’re trying to reprimand me or anything,” she eventually says. “For pleasure, yes. But check in with me first.”<br/><br/>Agatha nods; she’s almost panting now, distracted by Rio’s swollen lips, and the piece of skin she can see.<br/><br/>“Anything else I need to cover for now?” she asks, putting an enormous amount of effort in hiding how hungry for Rio she is.<br/><br/>“Yeah,” Rio drags out the word while sliding her hands up Agatha’s chest and back down to pull on the tie of her robe. Agatha hisses as it falls open and a bit of cold air breezes past her hardened nipples.<br/><br/>“Just because I’m asking you to be soft—,” Rio says, walking her fingers back up Agatha’s chest until she reaches the collar and grabs it, “doesn’t mean I don’t like it when you’re a little rough with me.”<br/><br/>She yanks Agatha forward and their lips meet again in a hungry and noisy kiss, their groans indistinguishable from each other.<br/><br/>“Fuck,” Agatha breathes into her mouth, turned on beyond comprehension. “Green?”<br/><br/>“Green.”<br/><br/>Agatha wastes no time finding the tie of Rio’s robe and makes quick work of it, buzzing with anticipation of finally touching more of Rio’s skin. She lavishes her with open mouthed kisses down her neck and on her shoulder while she slowly peels off Rio’s robe entirely.<br/>The other woman had been loud and clear about her preferences; soft in attention. Rough in her touches.<br/><br/>When she finally has her naked, she quickly chucks her own robe to the side too.<br/>Agatha grabs Rio’s waist and starts hungrily licking and kissing the smooth skin of her stomach, reveling in the approving sounds coming from Rio’s throat. Her hands slowly slide upward and curve around the side of her breasts, not putting any pressure on them yet.<br/><br/>The further down her mouth travels, the more prominent the scent of Rio’s arousal gets. She could drag the whole thing out, sure, but why would she deny herself such a delicacy?<br/><br/>When her tongue reaches Rio’s happy trail, she blindly follows it all the way down with one steady lick. The hairs get coarser, more dense, and when she’s found the bush on her mound, she shamelessly presses her mouth and nose in, inhaling deeply. </p><p>“Fuck, you smell good,” she exclaims gutterally, before travelling even lower and spreading her labia with her tongue. Rio is wetter than she’s ever felt her, and she gathers a large amount of that slickness with her tongue. Then she lets go of Rio’s breasts and uses her hands to push herself all the way up and dive in for a hot and wet kiss, giving Rio a pretty intense taste of herself.<br/><br/>“More?” Agatha grins, ready to do the whole thing all over again.<br/><br/>However, when Rio whispers “<em>touch my nipples,</em>” her brain short-circuits.<br/><br/>As a Domme, she would’ve punished this kind of needy behavior. Her subs are always allowed to ask, but never to demand.<br/>But now, different rules apply. Should she just… oblige? Even when making an effort to be soft, she can’t be expected to be <em> that </em> soft, right?<br/><br/>Oh, but wait… she could softly respond— in a rough way. <em> The fun way.  </em></p><p>“Whatever you want, my dear,” she says low and mockingly, before trailing her fingers over Rio’s ribs, up to her breasts. She squeezes them once for good measure, and sticks out both her index fingers; almost like the claws on a bird of prey. Her nails are long, and perfectly suitable to inflict some discomfort when she uses them to scratch Rio’s nipples.<br/><br/>“Oh… for <em> fuck’s </em> sake,” Rio breathes out, her voice raising half an octave. But from the way her body convulses, Agatha can tell that she didn’t hate that.<br/><br/>So she does it again. </p><p>Rio’s body jolts with every touch of her nails, pressing her thighs together as if her nipples are in direct contact with her clit.<br/>The way her nipples turn red and pebble so beautifully at her touch, soon invokes a thirst in Agatha that can’t be ignored. Her mouth takes over from her right hand and she latches on, soothing the tortured nipple with her tongue before wrapping her lips around it and sucking— <em> hard. </em> <em><br/></em> <em><br/></em> Rio’s cry is music to Agatha’s ears, and she feels proof of her own arousal starting to leak from between her legs.<br/><br/>“Do it again,” Rio hisses, sliding her hands into Agatha’s hair to keep her close. “Suck— <em> ah, </em> suck my tits, Agatha.”<br/><br/>Somehow, Rio’s foul mouth makes it a lot easier for Agatha to just comply. </p><p>When she switches to the other side, she watches Rio’s face closely, and notices the different way it contorts now. Her expression goes from discomfort to relaxation, to unfiltered pleasure; the small muscle between her brow being the indicator of how much she is affected by Agatha’s mouth. And when she starts panting, it’s becoming more and more evident that her ministrations are doing <em> fascinating </em> things to Rio’s body. Something’s building up, for sure.<br/><br/>“Shit, oh my god, <em> oh my god,” </em> Rio gasps, sounding somewhere between ecstatic and surprised. “What the ffff— oh, this is good, this is so fucking good, don’t stop, please Agatha, <em> suck!” </em><br/><br/>Agatha’s heartbeat rings in her ears as she realizes what’s happening. She feels Rio’s body convulse and sucks even harder, adds in some teeth, clamping them around the nipple to pull on it. She squeezes the other breast with one hand, and lets her other hand slide down, dipping between Rio’s wet and swollen folds. </p><p>She has barely grazed her clit with a fingertip when Rio looks like she’s about to explode.<br/><br/>“Oh <em>fuck! </em>I think I’m gonna— <em>Oh, shit, I’m gonna</em>—”<br/><br/>And something in Agatha takes over.<br/><br/>“<em>Don’t you dare</em>,” she growls around a nipple. Rio’s head whips down to look at her in utter surprise, but it only fuels her. “Don’t you dare fucking come.”<br/><br/>She switches sides again, unforgiving in the way she uses her lips and teeth on Rio’s overstimulated nipple. One of the fingers near Rio’s cunt flicks her clit every now and then; but nowhere near in a steady rhythm. Rio’s entire body jerks every time she does it.<br/><br/>Agatha feels like she’s swimming in arousal; not just from the way Rio is so close to orgasm from having her nipples sucked, but she is also very clearly responding well to Agatha toeing the line of their rules.<br/><br/>“I’m so, oh—! <em>Fucking! Close!” </em>A long and sinful moan follows Rio’s desperate cry, and Agatha’s brain almost melts through her ears.<br/><br/>“No,” she says, tracing a few circles around Rio’s clit. “Don’t come. Don’t you fucking dare, Rio.”<br/><br/>Why Rio feels the need to obey at that moment, neither woman knows. But as her hips jerk away from Agatha’s touch to keep her from stumbling headfirst into her orgasm, the familiar itch in Agatha’s palms is back.<br/><br/>She releases Rio’s breast and has the presence of mind to, just in time, ask for permission.<br/><br/>“Can I?” she pants, her voice muffled around Rio’s breast. “Rio! <em>Can I spank you?”</em><br/><br/>“I— I don’t kn— fuck, <em>YES!” </em>Rio gasps for breath now. “Yes, god, Agatha— do it!”<br/><br/>Not even a full second after Rio has finished her sentence, Agatha’s palm connects to the side of Rio’s ass with a loud smack. It makes both of them groan.<br/><br/>She repeats the action with the same hand, twice, three times, each time evoking an even bigger response from Rio. Then, her focus is back on her nipples and her clit. But before she can bring Rio to the edge again, the other woman speaks.<br/><br/>“Make me come,” sounds her surprisingly needy but steady voice. Her grip tightens in Agatha’s hair. “Agatha, give me my orgasm <em>right fucking now.” </em><em><br/></em><em><br/></em>And Agatha, during a unique moment, is at loss for words— and belligerence, for that matter. The one and only desire she has as she takes Rio’s writhing body in, is to comply; to give her everything she wants and more, to <em>give her an orgasm </em><em>right fucking now. </em><em><br/></em><em><br/></em>Huh. So <em>that’s </em>what topping from the bottom really is, she muses.<br/><br/>It takes two more swipes at Rio’s clit for her to come, <em>hard, </em>and Agatha watches in awe as her entire body shudders and shudders, from her shoulders to her feet, leaving Rio sighing in relief when all tension eventually leaves her body simultaneously.<br/><br/>They both get to enjoy that blissful state of nothingness for just a beat, before Rio breaks.<br/><br/>“Yellow,” she utters as goosebumps appear on her skin and she starts shivering again. Agatha immediately ceases all of her touches and tries to make eye-contact, but Rio turns onto her side and curls up into a ball.<br/><br/>“Rio, talk to me,” Agatha says sternly but softly, placing a soothing hand on the top of her spine. “What do you need? Tell me. I am here, baby.”<br/><br/>The term of endearment escapes her by accident, but she highly doubts that that is the biggest issue at the moment. </p><p>To her surprise, despite Rio’s closed off position, she does make an effort to communicate.<br/><br/>“Hold me?” Her voice sounds small and fragile. Agatha doesn’t hesitate and lays down behind her; her front to Rio’s back, wrapping an arm around her waist, rubbing soothing circles on her skin with her thumb.<br/><br/>“Too much?” Agatha whispers into her skin. Rio shakes her head.<br/><br/>“Not too much. Just overwhelmed. I’m— I’m done for today, if that’s okay?”<br/><br/>“Of course,” Agatha responds, squeezing her for emphasis. And while she is not big on cuddling, she knows to never underestimate aftercare— which is apparently needed, even if they weren’t actually playing. Some boundaries were threaded, for sure.<br/><br/>“Do you want to talk about it?” Agatha asks, with a small slice of hope that the answer is yes so Rio can vent and she can eventually release her, turn onto her other side and go to sleep.<br/><br/>“No,” Rio says, because of course she doesn’t. “I will when I’m ready. Can we just go to sleep?”</p><p><em>Like this? </em>Well, if she <em>has</em> to…<br/><em><br/></em>“I’m green, I’m okay. I needed yellow to make sure we wouldn’t continue.”<br/><br/>Agatha quietly nods against her shoulder, reassuring her with another squeeze of her arm.<em><br/></em>As she feels Rio relax out of her curled up position, Agatha goes completely rigid when Rio moves her legs back, trying to tangle them with Agatha’s.<br/><br/>“Are you wearing fucking socks to bed?”<br/><br/>“What about it?” is Rio’s muffled response.<br/><br/>“<em>Were you wearing socks the whole time</em>?”<br/><br/>“Really? That’s what sets you off right now? Pick your battles, Agatha.”<br/><br/>Agatha is glad that Rio can’t see her smirk— at least she’s successfully taken Rio’s mind off of what made her so upset.<br/><br/>“If I’d known you were a psychopath, I wouldn’t be half as attracted to you.”<br/><br/>“You can’t possibly call me a psychopath for wanting warm feet?”<br/><br/>“Yeah, I can, and I just did. Did you not hear it?”<br/><br/>Rio defiantly prods her socked toes into Agatha’s calves. “It’s either this, or ten tiny ice cubes.”<br/><br/>Agatha sighs dramatically. “Listen, it’s really simple. If we’re ever having sex again— the socks come <em>off.” </em></p><p>“If I take my socks off, you have to ride Victoria with me one day.”<br/><br/>“What does that have to do with— There is absolutely no way I’m going to break my bones on that death sentence on two wheels.”<br/><br/>“Oh come on! Do you know how many people <em> don’t </em> get into accidents?”<br/><br/>“I’d rather not test my luck. But thank you for the invitation. Keep your fucking socks on.”<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Against everybody’s expectations, not testing her luck that next week turns out to be one of the best decisions of Agatha’s life. </p><p>They don’t talk about Rio’s small breakdown the next morning, or during the ride home, or the day after, or after that. Agatha does text her to check in, but her inbox stays empty.<br/><br/>After an entire day and a half of Rio ignoring her texts and calls, the phone rings after all.<br/><br/>“Finally found some time to acknowledge my existence?” is the first thing Agatha says when she answers. It doesn’t take very long for her to realize that something’s wrong.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry,” sounds Rio’s unusually vulnerable voice through the speaker. “I’ve been a little— preoccupied.”<br/><br/>Agatha doesn’t get the chance to make infuriating assumptions at that, because in the silence that follows, a beeping machine and some hushed voices can be heard.<br/><br/>“Rio? Do I want to know where the fuck you are–?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know,” Rio chuckles humorlessly. “But how about I tell you anyway? I’m in the hospital.”<br/><br/>And despite who she is and everything she stands for, Agatha’s heart skips a beat when she hears a sniffle.<br/><br/>“<em>What? </em> What happened?”<br/><br/>“It’s Vic… Victoria didn’t make it,” Rio manages through strained breaths.<br/><br/>“Rio, for fuck’s sake! I couldn’t care less about that stupid bike! What happened to <em> you</em>?”<br/><br/>“Oh, yeah,” Rio says, as if her own health is just a side issue, and she sniffles again. “I broke my leg. My fibula is shattered— I’m about to go into surgery.”</p>

<p>“You raging <em> idiot,” </em> are the first words Agatha says when Rio is being wheeled into the hospital room, still half asleep. Her eyes blink open; once, twice, and then they close again.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha is <em> not </em>going to give her a break. </p><p>“You dumb <em> bitch,” </em> she continues, silencing the nurse who is clearly about to make a comment with a single soul-shattering look, before he scurries out of the room.<br/>
<br/>
“Absolute motherfucking <em> cunt.” </em> It’s a little bit softer this time, as Agatha sees Rio’s eyes blink open again when she leans over the footboard of the hospital bed.<br/>
<br/>
“Agh…atha?”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re such a complete and total loser, Rio.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio closes her eyes again, her head lolls to the side and she sleepily wriggles her shoulders. “Mhmm. Talk dirty to me.”<br/>
<br/>
“I would gladly cuss you out for a couple more hours, so you better wake up and tell me what happened.” </p><p>“Wzn’t me. Wzza truck,” Rio mumbles half into the pillow, still with her eyes closed.<br/>
“Tire went: <em> boom,” </em> she explains, lifting her right hand to imitate an explosion by sprawling out her fingers. Agatha winces when she sees the IV in the back of it.<br/>
<br/>
“Truck went: <em> whoa.” </em>The hand makes a swiveling gesture, almost like imitating a fish. </p><p>“Rio went: <em> weeee.” </em> She draws an arch in the air with her index finger, “and <em> splat.” </em> Her arm drops back onto the bed, and she emphasizes the crash by making a fart noise with her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
“Uhuh,” Agatha nods in amusement, a portion of her concern fading. “And leg went <em> crack, </em> I suppose?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio giggles. “Leg went: <em> snap!” </em><br/>
<br/>
She makes two fists and pretends to break a twig in half. Agatha winces for a second time.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, yeah, okay, I get it. And then the ambulance went <em> wee-hoo </em> and then right away, apparently, your brain went <em> call Agatha?” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Rio shouldn’t have called her, really.  </em></p><p>“No, silly,” Rio giggles again, and for a moment it looks like she’s fallen back asleep. But then she takes a deep breath in and opens her eyes, looking more lucid this time.<br/>
<br/>
“Happened yezzerday.”<br/>
<br/>
<em> What? Why didn’t she call her sooner?  </em></p><p>“Whadya doin’ here anyway?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio stares at her, curious and confused, clearly still very drugged up.<br/>
<br/>
“What do you mean, ‘what are you doing here’? You called me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah,” Rio nods, and keeps nodding, and <em> keeps nodding, </em> until she realizes she’s been nodding for a minute, and then she continues: “To ledya know. Where I was. Not to <em> come over. </em> Dummy.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha tries to say something, but her sudden embarrassment catches her off guard. Her lips produce almost the entire alphabet before she’s able to voice her, debatably intricate, feelings: “Oh.”<br/>
<br/>
Oh. Rio was… right. She <em> hadn’t </em> asked her to come to the hospital. Agatha had just assumed.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh,” she says again, nodding and straightening her shirt. “Yeah. Okay.” She glances at the door. “So who is coming to get you?”<br/>
<br/>
“Alissssssss.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha has no idea who that is, but she nods in understanding. “Well, um— it was good to see you. Feel better soon.”<br/>
<br/>
In an awkward attempt at a comforting gesture, Agatha pats one of Rio’s blanket-covered ankles. She realizes her mistake when her palm connects to hardened plaster, and Rio <em> wails.  </em></p><p>“Whoops,” Agatha says softly, and has the decency to look embarrassed for at least three seconds while she takes Rio’s pained expression in. Then, she frowns, determined to turn her lack of critical thinking skills into anything but her mistake. “Aren’t you supposed to be on the good stuff?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah,” Rio groans. “Isn’t strong ‘nuff against you tryna break my leg <em> again.”  </em></p><p>“If you’re able to clown around three minutes after waking up, I’d say you’re going to be fine. See you around, Rio.”<br/>
<br/>
<em> “Waaaaaaait.” </em><br/>
<br/>
Agatha considers ignoring her for a second, but she’s already said “Yes?” before she can stop herself.<br/>
<br/>
“Canya… gemme glass o’water?” Agatha glares at her, and Rio continues: “Ya scared the nurse ‘way.”<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Fine.” </em> She can’t really say no to someone in a hospital bed anyway, so she grabs a glass from the cupboard and fills it up in the bathroom sink.<br/>
<br/>
“Straw please?”<br/>
<br/>
“Rio, you can kiss my big, fat, juicy—”<br/>
<br/>
Rio, again, breaks out in giggles, and Agatha makes an unimpressed face at the highly uncharacteristic sound. Then, the giggles turn into a groan of discomfort. </p><p>“What is it?” </p><p>“Itches,” Rio says, and points at her foot. Agatha starts shaking her head, there’s no way she’s gonna—</p><p>“Big toe.” </p><p>“Oh for fuck’s sake.” She carefully takes the blanket off of Rio’s left leg, and swallows when she sees the cast reach from her foot all the way up to just below the knee. While keeping a suspicious eye on Rio, she scratches the back of her big toe with the nail of her index finger. Rio sighs in relief, and to distract herself from that sound, Agatha traces the camouflage green pattern on the cast with her eyes. </p><p>“Were they out of colors for adults?” </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says, weak but displeased, “how else am I gonna be able to <em> hide?”  </em></p><p>“From <em> who?!” </em></p><p>“From <em> them.”  </em></p><p>Agatha looks around the room, wondering who ‘<em>them</em>’ is. “Uh-uh. Very smart of you. Now— you’ve got it from here, don’t you? We’ll catch up in… how many weeks are you in the cast for?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio holds up five fingers of her right hand, and one of her left. Agatha lets out a low whistle and is about to cover her with the blanket, but Rio stops her.<br/>
<br/>
“Gotta pee.”<br/>
<br/>
“Should I call a nurse for you on my way out?”<br/>
<br/>
“Nah. Got it,” Rio dismisses her with a wave. She uses both of her hands to lift her injured leg up and over the edge of the mattress. Agatha watches her with an amused expression on her face, until Rio’s fingers wrap around the IV stand and it looks like she’s about to push herself off the edge.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha rushes forward and clashes her chest into Rio’s just in time, extending her arms to catch her under the armpits. Rio limply drops all of her wait onto Agatha’s arms, and snickers.<br/>
<br/>
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Agatha says through clenched teeth; not only is she carrying Rio’s full weight, but her face is practically buried in the other woman’s neck. When she breathes, she realizes she can still smell the distinct scent that’s just <em> Rio—</em> earthly, but divine. <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Said I got it.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, you clearly got it, Looping Louie.” Agatha grunts as she hoists Rio back onto the bed, and she watches her frown in disappointment. The sense of concern she had before comes rushing back and takes over. There is no idiot on the planet who knows how to handle this idiot in front of her, she’s sure of that.<br/>
<br/>
“That’s it, you’re coming home with me.” </p><p>“Huh?”<br/>
<br/>
Huh indeed.<br/>
<br/>
“If you’re going to end up at home by yourself, you get to pick a nice matching color cast for your right leg by next week.”<br/>
<br/>
“But Alice—”<br/>
<br/>
“Will get a phone call from you that she’s not needed anymore. Listen, you’ve seen how spacious my house is, you’ll get your own room and enough privacy. Don’t expect any special treatment: I’m doing this for <em> me.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “For… you?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha knows how ridiculous this plan sounds, she <em> knows. </em> But the idea that she would have to call Rio every thirty minutes to check if she’s still alive… Taking her home is the lesser of two evils, really.<br/>
<br/>
When she looks at Rio, she realizes she’s still chuckling.<br/>
<br/>
“What?” Agatha barks, but after her very generous offer of care, it doesn’t carry any bite.<br/>
<br/>
“Nurse Agatha,” Rio says with the dumbest grin on her face. Her smile is so big that her eyes squint and her nose scrunches up. Agatha wants to deck her and also squeeze her cheeks.<br/>
<br/>
“Call me that one more time and I’m dumping you by the freeway. Come on,” Agatha says as her eyes land on a pair of crutches next to the bed. She grabs them and places them in front of Rio. “I’ll help you to the bathroom and then I’ll ask for your discharge papers.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio keeps giggling all the way through.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p>The giggles turn into wails not forty minutes after they get settled in Agatha’s home, and Agatha regrets her heroic act mere minutes later.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s drugs are starting to wear off, and she is very clearly set on making that Agatha’s problem entirely. </p><p>“For the sake of my sanity, Rio, take another Advil,” Agatha sighs, turning the volume of the TV up. She’s curled up in her favorite chair in the living room, and Rio has taken up the couch with her back against the armrest and her legs sprawled out in front of her. Psycho is on the other end of the couch, with his chin resting on Rio’s good leg.<br/>
<br/>
From the corner of her eye, Agatha watches Rio reach for the side table that carries her small pharmacy of painkillers. Agatha tries to ignore her, but Rio sighs audibly.<br/>
<br/>
“They’re just out of reach.”<br/>
<br/>
“Must suck to be you,” Agatha says, and turns up the volume even more. However, two strained grunts and three pained whimpers later, she caves and gets up to chuck the bottle of painkillers at her.<br/>
<br/>
“Thank you,” Rio says sweetly, screwing the lid off and popping two pills in her mouth. She washes them away with a sip of water and sinks back into the sofa cushion.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha has just taken her seat in the lounge chair, when she hears the chattering of teeth. She initially tries to ignore that too, but soon realizes it is making her dog go crazy as his ears perk up and gauges Rio with a stressed out kind of energy.<br/>
<br/>
“If you want a blanket, you’re first in line when I get up for my pee break,” she says with her eyes glued to the screen, in hopes of shutting Rio up.<br/>
<br/>
“But you just <em> went </em> to the bathroom?” Rio asks with a small voice.<br/>
<br/>
“I guess that means you’ll have to wait.”<br/>
<br/>
Even though she can’t see her, Rio’s pout is not lost on her. When she does look over, she watches Rio pat her thighs to convince Psycho to get in her lap. Maddeningly enough, he obliges.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey buddy. You’re nice and warm,” she coos, and Agatha doesn’t take it for passive aggressiveness right away, until Rio continues: “You know what I need, don’t you? Such a good dog. Yeah, you’ve such a big heart. That’s a good boy. Taking such great care of me.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha rolls her eyes and places her chin in her hand, almost staring a hole through the TV.<br/>
So yes. Taking Rio in was a highly regrettable choice. How much bad karma would she suffer if she shoved her back into the car and drove her home anyway?<br/>
She glanced at Rio’s cast once more from the corner of her eye, and— ugh. Why were injured people so hard to be mean to?<br/>
<br/>
At least Psycho seems capable of shutting her up for two entire minutes, before she pipes up again: “Did you ever think about how this is an anagram of my last name? What do you think <em> that </em> means?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha whips her head around to see what’s she’s on about <em>this time</em>. Rio is studying the bottle of Advil like it holds the answers to life’s questions.<br/>
<br/>
“Rio— if you’re fucking <em> bored, </em> that really shouldn’t be my issue.”<br/>
<br/>
“But can we play a game or something? To distract me from the pain?”<br/>
<br/>
“Absolutely not.”<br/>
<br/>
“Not a board game or anything. Just like… a questions game. Twenty questions.”<br/>
<br/>
“Nope.”<br/>
<br/>
“You can ask the questions.”<br/>
<br/>
“Nein.”<br/>
<br/>
“Okay, <em> I </em> will ask the questions?”<br/>
<br/>
“Não.”<br/>
<br/>
“So what if we each just ask <em> one—” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Rio, I’m running out of fucking languages to tell you no in. I’m not your goddamn <em> jester. </em> Now that the ship has sailed on our sex for the next six weeks, it would be in your best interest to <em> not </em> wind me up.”<br/>
<br/>
“Aww,” Rio says, and Agatha’s frown deepens. “You wanna have sex with me in six weeks?” </p><p>“I highly doubt it at this point,” Agatha grumbles. Rio seems to take that loss and keeps quiet for a minute, making Agatha smile contently.<br/>
<br/>
But then, Rio grabs a pillow from the couch and chucks it at her.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey!”<br/>
<br/>
“Are you saying this injury makes me less attractive?”<br/>
<br/>
“The injury? No. Your attitude? Fuck, yes.”<br/>
<br/>
Another pillow flies across the room, hitting Agatha in the shoulder. She breathes in sharply and pinches the bridge of her nose. It takes an enormous amount of effort not to get up and smother Rio with it. </p><p>“What the fuck do you think you’re doing, ungrateful—”<br/>
<br/>
“They’re not called <em> throw pillows </em> for nothing, are they?” </p><p>“Rio, I swear to fucking god, I will come over and break your other leg myself—”<br/>
<br/>
“Then tell me something! If I can’t walk for six weeks, my brain needs to be fed.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll feed your brain with a strong right hook—”<br/>
<br/>
“Why are you so violent?”<br/>
<br/>
“Why are you an <em> actual child</em>?!”<br/>
<br/>
Rio sighs dramatically, only proving Agatha’s point. “I was on my way to you, you know.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha shakes her head in confusion at the sudden change of topic. “What?”<br/>
<br/>
“When I got hit by that truck. I was on my way to surprise you with a visit.”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re making that up,” Agatha says flatly, only because she doesn’t <em> want </em> it to be true. “You’re trying to make me feel sorry for you.”<br/>
<br/>
“Am I?” Rio keeps her eyes locked onto Agatha’s while she softly strokes the fur between Psycho’s ears. “Were you home? Yesterday afternoon?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah…” Agatha answers, highly suspicious of what comes next.<br/>
<br/>
“Hm,” Rio nods. “Just like you are today. Which <em> really </em> has me wondering what it is you do for a living.”<br/>
<br/>
<em> What a fucking slippery worm. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Fine.” Agatha throws her hands up and turns the volume of the TV all the way down. “You get three questions. And then you’re <em> done </em>for the day.” </p><p>Rio’s grin returns so widely, it almost looks like she’s back on the hospital grade drugs. She lifts a finger of her right hand.<br/>
<br/>
“One: why aren’t you working normal office hours?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha sucks in a deep breath and scratches her chin. She was gonna have this conversation at some point anyway.<br/>
<br/>
“Because I’m on long term family and medical leave,” she reluctantly admits. Rio’s eyes grow wide.<br/>
<br/>
“What? You took medical leave for m—”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Agatha snaps. “It’s not because of you. And that was question two, by the way.”<br/>
<br/>
“What? No! I take it back.”<br/>
<br/>
“Too fucking bad.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ugh. Okay. So question three: who are you on leave for?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha clenches her jaw before answering: “My mother.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio opens her mouth to ask a follow-up question, but Agatha shushes her by making a sushing motion with her hand. “Alright,” she says as she slaps her thighs and gets up from her chair, “a blanket, was it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, not so fast,” Rio says, sounding almost disappointed. “Don’t you wanna ask me three questions?”<br/>
<br/>
“Sure,” Agatha says, stoically glaring at Rio while she puts her forefinger up: “Did you still want that blanket?”<br/>
<br/>
“Um— yeah?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha holds up a second finger: “Are you sure?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes?”<br/>
<br/>
And a third finger: “Will you shut up for the rest of the day?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio slumps down on the sofa, crossing her arms.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re <em> boring!” </em> She shouts as Agatha walks away. <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em>“And you’re the bane of my existence. We all have our crosses to bear.” </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Over the next few days, the ‘<em>I answer three questions and you shut up’- </em>theory proves an effective way to not completely drive Agatha insane, even if Rio still needs her assistance with basic care. </p><p>And even though Rio likes to pry in the parts of Agatha’s life she has no business with, Agatha always finds a way to answer her questions in such a concise way that they’re never very informative.<br/>
<br/>
That is until one day, Agatha is preparing lunch for the both of them, and Rio has managed to hoist herself up on a barstool at the kitchen island after having conquered the distance from the living room to the kitchen on her crutches. </p><p>“Are you a chicken?” Rio casually inquires while leaning forward on her elbows.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha, who stands behind the electric stovetop in the center of the kitchen island and thus facing Rio, shoots her an agitated look as she cracks some pepper in the pan. She really, really doesn’t want to take the bait, but Rio’s eyes sparkle so brightly, and… well, she’s missed that look ever since she picked her up from the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
“No, Rio, I’m not a chicken,” she sighs, placing the pepper mill back on the counter with a little too much force.<br/>
<br/>
“Then what are you doing?” Rio’s grin widens, and oh, she needs her to <em> not </em> be in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m making eggs…?” Agatha answers, one eyebrow all the way up to her hairline.<br/>
<br/>
“See,” the other woman says, flipping her hair back over her shoulder, clearly very pleased with herself, “you’re a chicken.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha refuses to roll her eyes, because rewarding that with a response at all would be giving her too much credit.<br/>
<br/>
“How about you make your own food, Robocop?” Agatha had taken a liking to using a different broken-leg-themed insult for Rio every time, and this one was, if she was being completely fair with herself, mid-tier at most. Oh well. She couldn’t <em> always </em> be on top of her game.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m good,” Rio says, using her sickeningly sweet <em> ‘thank you for taking care of me’- </em> smile. “What kind of eggs?”<br/>
<br/>
“Omelet,” Agatha answers curtly, before shoving the spatula under the barely solidified eggs and attempting a flip. Half the food falls apart, and the other half still sticks to the pan.<br/>
Without missing a single beat, she says: “Scrambled eggs.”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re lucky; I like my omelets scrambled.”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re lucky I haven’t tried to decapitate you with this spatula.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh please, stop turning me on, Agatha.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha knows by now: injured and helpless Rio is bad.<br/>
But injured, helpless, and <em> flirty </em> Rio is an absolute nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
The combination of providing care for someone <em> and </em> wanting to rail them, just doesn’t sit right in her head. Which is why she desperately tries to separate those two Rios in her head – railable Rio is on vacation anyway, she won’t be back for another five weeks – but it’s not an easy job with her.<br/>
<br/>
“I found you much less annoying when you were asking those stupid questions,” Agatha says while aggressively shaking a more than generous amount of red pepper flakes into the pan.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, I can go back to those.” Rio intertwines her fingers like she’s making an important point at a business meeting. “So when you’re <em> not </em> on family and medical leave, what kind of job do you do?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha turns around to retrieve plates from the cupboard as she contemplates getting away with any version of ‘<em>I work for the government’</em>. She knows she probably can’t.<br/>
<br/>
“I work for the US department of labor,” she says, avoiding Rio’s gaze as she sets the plates out in front of them. She can almost hear the gears turn in the other woman’s head.<br/>
“I assess… requests for medical and family leave.”<br/>
<br/>
“That seems… Awfully coincidental?” Rio says, slowly and carefully. Smart one, she is.<br/>
<br/>
“Is that your second question?” Agatha scoops half the eggs onto Rio’s plate and the other half onto her own.<br/>
<br/>
“No! Um— so, you’re on leave because of your <em> mother… </em>where— where is she?” </p><p>“Not here,” Agatha simply says, pushing Rio’s plate out to her. “Bon appétit.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio makes a buzzer sound with her throat. “Not an answer,” she says, picking up her fork and pointing it at Agatha. “Doesn’t count. So try again. Where is she?”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re really not going to let this go, aren’t you?”<br/>
<br/>
“I am not.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha places both her palms on the counter, looks down, and sighs. Then she scratches her temple, takes Rio in, and nods reluctantly.<br/>
<br/>
“Okay.”<br/>
<br/>
With Rio’s scrutinizing eyes glued to her, Agatha walks to the dresser against the wall between the kitchen and the living room. She opens the door on the far right, takes out a beige urn, and brings it back to the kitchen. With a <em> thud, </em>she places it in front of Rio on the counter. </p><p>“Mother, meet Rio. Rio, meet Evanora.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha thinks she’s finally done it; she’s broken Rio’s brain. She looks like a malfunctioning robot for a few seconds anyways.<br/>
<br/>
“Your mother is… <em> dead</em>?”</p><p>“No Rio, she’s just really tiny,” Agatha deadpans. “<em>Yes, </em> she’s dead. Very.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m… sorry.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha scoffs. “Oh, don’t be. She’s less of a mess like this, believe me.”<br/>
<br/>
“But, if she’s dead— how are you on medical leave to take care of her?”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re right!” Agatha dramatically smacks herself in the forehead. “I guess I should inform the <em>department of labor</em> about her passing soon, so they’ll take me off leave.”<br/>
<br/>
When she picks up her fork to dig into her eggs, Agatha feels the air around them shift as Rio slowly starts to catch on. </p><p>“Agatha…” Rio swallows, but her own eggs are long forgotten, “how long have you been on leave for? When did your mother die?”<br/>
<br/>
She stoically stuffs her mouth and starts chewing loudly.<br/>
<br/>
“Seventeen years ago.”<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Your mother has been dead for seventeen years?” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Your ears clearly remained uninjured in the accident, dear.”<br/>
<br/>
“Isn’t the limit for that kind of leave, like, twelve months?”<br/>
<br/>
“Correct! You should apply, there’s plenty of p—”<br/>
<br/>
“Jesus christ Agatha, have you been scamming the government for that long? How does that even work? How does…” Rio vaguely gestures around the spacious room, “...all of this work?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha puts her fork down and swallows her food. “Okay, listen. I will tell you <em> once, </em> and only because I will drive you to the top of a mountain and leave you there if you tattle.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio nods in understanding.<br/>
<br/>
“My mother was awful. I had broken off all contact ever since I became an adult, until one day she randomly showed up at my door with some sob story about having incurable cancer. She was running the department of labor at the time, and offered me a deal: she would get me a job if I agreed to take care of her.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio cocks her head, trying to connect the dots in her head.<br/>
<br/>
“I wasn’t interested in a government job, or in taking care of her for that matter, but she sold the idea to me based on the promise that she would approve my medical leave for me as soon as she announced her illness and went into early retirement. So I did the actual job for about two weeks before I went on paid leave.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio chews her lip and raises her eyebrows, intrigued to hear more. Agatha takes a deep breath, unsure whether the next part will make Rio lose all her respect.<br/>
<br/>
“Thus began the three worst months of my life; moving back in here with my mother. I often regretted that choice, especially since, while there was no cure for her cancer, she could still grow old with it. But, by some grace of divine intervention… three months in, she tripped on the landing, fell down the stairs. Broke her neck. She was dead before she hit the ground floor.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio gasps; an actual, audible gasp, and places a hand over her mouth.</p><p>No way back now.<br/>
<br/>
“I knew I was supposed to inform my manager about her death and my inevitable return. But since I hated the idea of working there so much, I kept putting it off. One more day, one more week, one more month… Until I realized that, if I didn’t tell anyone, nobody would know. My mother, the old hag, had no friends, so I didn’t have to worry about her being seen. And as far as anyone at work was concerned, she was sick and in bed, too ill to undertake anything.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio exhales languidly, blowing up her cheeks while processing what Agatha is telling her. “But how did you keep this up for seventeen years? Did nobody come over and check? Nobody raised any alarms after one year of paid time off?”<br/>
<br/>
“After the first year, I had figured out how to get into my mother’s work account. They had simply never closed it. I could keep renewing my leave under her name, year after year. Up until this day, I still pay her bills: insurance, taxes, you name it. I use her credit card to do so, to not raise any suspicions about her state of being. I live in her house, I keep it in good condition… and since she still gets her pension paid every month, I’ve grown used to— well, taking some financial compensation, if you will.” </p><p>“Agatha, this is insane… Aren’t funeral homes supposed to report the death of the people they cremate?”<br/>
<br/>
“You would be correct,” Agatha nods, before putting a fake pout on her face, “if not for a very distraught daughter who convinces the workers there that she works for the government and will report the death of her dear, <em> dear </em> mother herself.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s jaw drops slowly, and she shakes her head in disbelief. “That is— this is ridiculous. You’re downright <em> evil.</em>”<br/>
<br/>
And while Agatha is having a hard time gauging whether Rio is impressed or shocked, whether the only thing keeping her from running and screaming is her broken leg, she just smiles. “Thanks.” </p><p>A million things seem to happen behind Rio’s eyes, but Agatha doesn’t necessarily want her to do a deep dive into her decades-long fraud scheme.<br/>
<br/>
“What about you?” she asks, weirdly chipper for someone usually so uninterested in anyone else, “Don’t you think it’s time for you to tell me about your job?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio blinks, thrown off balance. “How kind of you to finally ask,” she says, unimpressed, and clearly not fooled by Agatha’s attempt at changing the conversation. She indulges her anyway.<br/>
<br/>
“So, the interesting thing about all of this…” Rio intensifies her eye contact with Agatha, making sure she locks in for this, “is that I am a lawyer. An employer defense attorney, to be precise. I defend companies who are dealing with any fraud-committing employees in court.” </p><p>All color instantly drains from Agatha’s face. It’s like her lungs are in a vice grip, she can’t breathe— the muscle above one of her eyebrows starts twitching.<br/>
<br/>
Has she really trusted the wrong person? Has she walked right into a trap, eyes wide open? Is she going to lose it all?<br/>
<br/>
“You— are you— you’re not serious, aren’t you?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s lip curls up into a shy smile, and she shrugs. “No, I’m not. But come on, you deserved that.”<br/>
<br/>
Now it’s Agatha’s time to let her jaw drop. Her brain starts buzzing. “Rio? What the fuck?!”<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, after getting away with this for almost two decades, you needed <em> someone </em>to put you in your place!” </p><p>“I’m kicking you the fuck out.” </p><p>And she means it, she really does, she <em> really means it </em> as she points a weak finger at the door. But then, Rio starts laughing.<br/>
<br/>
“You should’ve seen your face,” she sputters. “That was amazing. Absolute gold. You’re <em> so tough, </em> aren’t you? Except for when I try to poke a tiny little hole in that dam of yours.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha is angry; at the joke, at her response, at her laughter, at her entire existence. But knowing she is losing, she just needs something to do; so with a feral scowl, she snatches Rio’s untouched plate of eggs away from her.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, I was still gonna eat that!” </p><p>“Yeah? Well, eat <em> this,” </em> Agatha snarls, presenting her with her middle finger, before realizing that taking Rio’s food away is definitely not in any way improving her weak position. She all but frisbees the plate back toward her, shivers, and throws her hands up in a <em> whatever-</em>gesture.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn’t speak a word to Rio for the rest of the day— that bitch will find her way up the stairs on those crutches by herself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, as Agatha silently serves Rio a bowl of Lucky Charms— as per her own request— she still feels on edge while Rio chatters away like nothing happened. They’re in their respective seats in the living room again: Agatha in the lounge chair with her hair in a bun and relaxed house clothes on, and Rio on the sofa, clad in a tee and shorts for convenience regarding her broken leg, her freshly washed hair loose around her face. Psycho is fast asleep on the floor in between them. </p><p>“Rio—” Agatha interrupts the retelling of her entire night and the amount of discomfort her leg still causes her, “If you’re uncomfortable staying around after what I’ve told you yesterday… I would understand.”<br/>
<br/>
<em> Please be honest, please be honest. </em><br/>
<br/>
Rio snorts and shakes her head. “I thought about it for a little bit,” she admits, mouth full of cereal. “Since it’s, you know, ethically wrong in all the imaginable ways.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha just looks at her.<br/>
<br/>
“But after some careful consideration… I actually think it’s crazy, <em> stupid hot.” </em><br/>
<br/>
Agatha sputters into her coffee, making it splash back against her forehead. “Excuse me?”<br/>
<br/>
“I mean, think about it. Is it illegal? Yes. High risk? Also yes. Dangerous? Yes. Kind of clever and cunning? I could go on—”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re deranged,” Agatha says, while wiping the droplets from her face with her hand tucked into her sleeve. </p><p>“Yeah, <em> I’m </em> the deranged one,” Rio laughs. “No, but think about it. Who wouldn’t wanna get railed by a criminal?”<br/>
<br/>
When those words process in Agatha’s brain, she feels a lot of things happening at once. She knows Rio is just riling her up, she knows it damn well. The twinkle in her eyes only proves it further.<br/>
<br/>
“First of all: not a criminal if I’m not convicted,” Agatha says, holding up her hand before Rio can interrupt her. “Secondly: do not talk to me about railing when your current predicament makes that impossible.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio sets her bowl of Lucky Charms aside and tucks her good leg in under herself. “Who says?” she challenges innocently. “I don’t need my leg to make your eyes roll into the back of your head, Agatha.”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s not <em> that. </em> I would have a hard time getting off by the same person I have to basically hand feed, carry in and out of the shower, and tuck into bed.” <br/>
<br/>
Rio laughs sharply. “I don’t believe that. Would it be impossible for you to find me sexy like this?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha presses her lips together while she tries not to stare at Rio’s bare thigh which she puts on display by teasingly pulling the fabric of her shorts up.<br/>
<br/>
“Your little housewife act turns me on to no end, you know,” Rio says, gesturing around the room. “You fetch my meds for me, you cook for me, you do groceries, you clean, you help me get around the house… that level of obedience and devotion just— ticks all my boxes.”<br/>
<br/>
Her words make Agatha dig her nails into the fabric of the chair. There’s no way Rio is going to—<br/>
<br/>
“I wonder what else I can make you do.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m doing nothing for you anymore if you keep this up.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ve thought of three more questions,” Rio continues, pretending not to hear her. She twists her torso and leans over the armrest so she can make full eye contact with Agatha.<br/>
<br/>
“Excellent. Can’t wait for you to shut up after.” </p><p>Rio jabs her thumb over her shoulder, pointing toward the hallway.<br/>
<br/>
“What’s behind the locked door under the stairs?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha huffs. “We covered this already. Sex dungeon. What a waste of a question.” </p><p>“You’re not allowed to lie! What’s behind that door?”<br/>
<br/>
“Waste of a <em>second</em> question. Sex dungeon.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio rolls her eyes. “Fine, keep your secret. I’ll find out one day,” she mutters as she rakes her hand through Psycho’s fur, who had just gotten up from his slumber and is now stretching out next to her.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you think Psycho has started to like me better than you?” she wonders, playfully holding her finger in his mouth when he yawns. His jaw snaps shut, softly enough, and Rio chuckles as he gnaws on her digit.<br/>
<br/>
“Please,” Agatha scoffs, unimpressed. “I trained him for <em> years. </em> Your whole injured act isn’t gonna change where his loyalty lies.”<br/>
<br/>
“No?” Rio pinches his jaw to retrieve her finger. “Wanna bet on it?”<br/>
<br/>
And Agatha is too old to indulge in those kinds of games, too sophisticated, has too much self-respect—<br/>
<br/>
“What are we betting on? Will you stop asking about that goddamn door if I win?”<br/>
<br/>
“Sure, deal. Mm…” Rio folds one of Psycho’s ears between her fingers. It comically flops back as she releases it. She looks back at Agatha, and her eyes flash.<br/>
<br/>
“If I win, I want to give you five commands— as a Domme. And I want you to obey.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha barks out a laugh. <em> “Sure, </em> honey. What interesting fantasies in that head of yours. Are you sure you didn’t break your skull as well?”<br/>
<br/>
“Like I said, your housewife act is truly inspiring. I would <em> love </em> to boss you around. But if Psycho is as well-trained as you say he is, you don’t have to worry.”<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, okay, Rio does have a point…<br/>
Agatha’s eyes drop to her trusted furry friend. Of course he isn’t going to let her down. He is basically an extension of her own soul.<br/>
<br/>
“Deal.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio smirks and gathers her crutches to get up from the sofa. “Let’s stand on each side of the room. We’ll see who he runs to when he hears his release word from both of us. And we’re not allowed to say anything else to him.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha nods confidently, gets up from her chair and snaps her fingers to catch Psycho’s attention. “Stay.” </p><p>She watches Rio hop toward the kitchen, so she turns the opposite way in the direction of the entrance hall. When they both turn around to face each other, Agatha can’t help but chuckle at the way this whole setup feels like a cowboy duel. Rio only adds to the hilarity of the situation when she gives a small, but determined nod to tell Agatha she’s ready. </p><p>Agatha counts down on her fingers; <em> three, two, one, </em> and both women take a breath at the same time to call out across the room: “Free!”<br/>
<br/>
She watches her dog’s ears perk up, turning his head toward Rio first— and she can’t have that, obviously, so she bends forward to smack her own thighs in an attempt to get his attention.<br/>
It works, briefly, but Rio uses one of her crutches to stomp on the ground, directing his attention toward her. His tail is working overtime and he starts panting in excitement.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha can just about stop herself from calling his name, but can’t have Rio win like this: it’s <em> her </em> dog, for fuck’s sake. So again, she smacks her own thighs, clapping her hands after, only to make the ‘ <em> heel’- </em> gesture that she taught him. Her heart beats proudly in her chest when Psycho obediently trots in her direction.<br/>
<br/>
But before he can get to her, she hears another sound from across the room: Rio is clicking her tongue against her teeth, twice. And when Psycho hears that, he stops dead in his tracks, turns around, and sprints in Rio’s direction without any regard for furniture or other sounds Agatha makes anymore.<br/>
When he reaches her, he jumps up against her with too much enthusiasm and she loses her balance; falling back on her ass with the crutches still in hand.<br/>
<br/>
“Rio!”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha sprints across the room with almost the same determination as Psycho, her heart now in her throat at the possibility of Rio being even further injured—<br/>
<br/>
But when she gets there, she watches in surprise as Psycho frantically licks her face, clearly apologizing, and Rio belly-laughing at the sensation.<br/>
<br/>
“Are— are you okay?” Agatha genuinely wants to know, but her mouth can’t help but curl up at the sound of Rio’s laughter.<br/>
<br/>
“Am I okay?!” Rio shrieks while trying to push the dog off of her, “I am fantastic! I won!”<br/>
Psycho’s tongue licks over her ear and she <em> screams, </em> covering her ear with a hand and rolling onto her side.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha crosses her arms with an amused expression on her face. She was going to help her out and call Psycho back, but not if she’s being cocky about it.<br/>
<br/>
“You cheated, though,” Agatha calmly says, while watching the two of them wrestle on the floor. “You weren’t allowed to call him.”<br/>
<br/>
“I cheated?! You started it! You did the damn gesture and everything!”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, and you did the— whatever it was you did. Why’d he even listen to you, anyway?”<br/>
<br/>
“Psy, down,” Rio commands him from under her arms, with which she is shielding her face. Finally, he seems to get the hint, and he sits back on his hind paws.<br/>
<br/>
“Psycho and I may have spent some… quality time together,” Rio shyly admits while pushing herself back up into a seated position. “Whenever you’re cooking or doing laundry… Psy loves to learn some new tricks from me, don’t you, boy?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio scratches the dog under his chin, and Agatha cocks a surprised eyebrow. <em> Is this woman seducing her dog when she’s not looking? </em></p><p>“Yeah? What else did you teach him?” she asks incredulously.<br/>
<br/>
Rio grins up at her as if she’s been waiting for Agatha to ask. Then she aims her fore- and middle finger at Psycho, and her thumb upward; mimicking a gun.<br/>
<br/>
“Pew-pew.”<br/>
<br/>
And, well, Agatha doesn’t know if she should be surprised, frustrated, or amused; but while Rio acts out the knockback, Psycho limply flops onto his side with a sad whine. It would’ve been impressive if his tail wasn’t literally whipping up dust from the floor in excitement.<br/>
<br/>
“We’re still working on that,” Rio claims in all sincerity when she sees it too. “You gonna help me up?”<br/>
<br/>
“Why don’t you ask him?” Agatha nods at Psycho and truly considers leaving Rio there, but she is already looking up at her with extended arms and she really, really can’t deny those fluttering eyelashes anything.<br/>
<br/>
In a similar way to how Agatha had caught her in the hospital, she hooks her arms under Rio’s armpits. However, lifting her up from the ground takes a bit more strength, and she has to step even closer to the other woman to be able to bring her full weight into it. The moment she hoists her up and their bodies get pulled flush, she feels a strange instinct to just… not let go. To keep inhaling Rio’s scent— which is now mixed with her own laundry detergent— until she gets nauseous; to hold her like they melt together, to carry her until it’s time for the cast to come off.<br/>
<br/>
She gets shaken up from her fantasy when Rio, who has now wrapped her arms around Agatha’s shoulders, whispers in her ear: “So I won the bet, you know what that means, right?”<br/>
<br/>
A shiver travels up Agatha’s spine and lingers near her neck. All of a sudden, Rio’s playfulness is gone, her idiocy revolving around her broken leg and Psycho completely disappearing to the background, just from how she uses her voice.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you gonna behave when I tell you what to do?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha wants her to stop using that voice, and she also doesn’t. She cocks her head downward to see if Rio is ready to put her weight on her good leg, and lets go. Rio’s smirk burns a hole right through the back of her head while she bends through her knees to pick up her crutches for her. </p><p>The cockiness with which Rio hops back to the couch, followed by a miraculously revived Psycho, doesn’t quite carry through the room like it would if she wasn’t on crutches, but it agitates Agatha all the same.<br/>
<br/>
When Rio takes her place on the couch and realizes Agatha hasn’t followed her, she taps the chair with a crutch. Agatha stubbornly counts to 10 in her head before joining Rio in the living room, to make it look like it had been her own decision. </p><p>“We agreed on five commands, yeah?” Rio says with a calm smile as Agatha takes a seat. Where did this version of her arise from all of a sudden? Where was the whiny, attention deprived version of Rio? And why does this wave of confidence look so good on her?<br/>
<br/>
“We didn’t <em> agree, </em> exactly,” Agatha murmurs, draping her arms over the armrests of the chair to exude some kind of false self-assurance.<br/>
<br/>
“Just tell me whenever you’re ready to go to your subspace,” Rio challenges her with a wicked, amused grin, knowing full well there’s nothing ‘<em>just</em>’ about that.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t have a subspace.”<br/>
<br/>
“No? Come on baby, let me take you there.”<br/>
<br/>
She hadn’t considered losing their stupid bet earlier, but the way Rio takes her in with such a powerful calmth, awakes a surprising sense of curiosity in her.<br/>
Of course she’d always wondered what subbing felt like, but there was no way she would actually ever give in. So, sure— she could take her loss like a lady and make some kind of study out of it, some kind of experiment— it wouldn’t hurt her to experience dominance from the opposite side for once. To use that information to become a better Domme.<br/>
Especially if it happens in a framed environment of five commands max.<br/>
<br/>
Rio seems to be picking up on Agatha’s internal monologue, and she adds: “Don’t overthink it, or take it too seriously, Agatha. Let’s just have fun. I have no choice but to trust you these days; I’m only asking you to trust me back for a moment. Let’s just see what you’re made of.”<br/>
<br/>
And fuck her for knowing exactly how to provoke her; <em> of course </em> it’s hard to say no if she phrases it like that.<br/>
<br/>
“Sure. I’ll play your stupid game,” she eventually says, making a mental note that she’ll always have the option to just… walk away. </p><p>“Good.” Rio seems pleased enough with that answer. “One: I want you to take your hair out of your bun.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha huffs; that’s what she wants to start with? Easy enough.<br/>
As she complies, she can’t help but feel her skin itch at the sensation of being watched so intently. She shakes out her hair and quickly combs through it with her hand.<br/>
<br/>
Then she holds up the elastic with a questioning eyebrow, as if to ask what to do with it. Rio holds up her hand without saying a word, and before Agatha knows it, she has leaned over to place the elastic in her palm. Rio’s grin widens.<br/>
<br/>
“Very good, Agatha,” she says, and Agatha grumbles something intelligible at the realization of having obeyed without prompting.<br/>
<br/>
“Two: could you please close the curtains for me?”<br/>
<br/>
It’s asked in such a sickeningly relaxed manner, Agatha almost wishes Rio would just bark her orders. That way, it would be way easier to talk back. How is she supposed to defy these dumb <em> nice </em> requests?<br/>
<br/>
With an exasperated sigh, Agatha pads to the window overlooking the front yard and closes the curtains with two sharp tugs, not preventing any daylight from coming in, but blocking the view from outside in.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re doing perfectly,” Rio purrs, and it makes Agatha’s ears ring— can she just get it over with already?<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t need any praise, if that’s what you think,” Agatha snaps while she walks back to her chair, but it lacks conviction.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh?” Rio blinks at her a few times and tilts her head, clearly about to change trajectory. “I think you do.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha gives her a look, but Rio is having none of it.<br/>
<br/>
“Alright, in that case— three: I’m going to give you a compliment, and I would like for you to say thank you. And don’t try to be funny— try to mean it.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha never, ever thought she would prefer needy, whiny, helpless Rio, but at this point, she would. She one hundred percent would. This whole act of <em> fake power… </em> it just doesn’t fucking suit her.<br/>
<br/>
“I think you’ve obeyed wonderfully so far, Agatha.”<br/>
<br/>
Instead of the taunting smirk Agatha expects Rio to look at her with, she is met with a patient expression. Way too patient. Punchably patient.<br/>
<br/>
“Thanks,” Agatha forces out when she realizes Rio isn’t going to budge until she complies. But when she sees that one word of gratitude making Rio’s face radiate with joy, she starts to feel giddy all of a sudden—<em>really, Agatha? fucking giddy?— </em>and she clears her throat to cover it up: “Yeah. Thank you.”<br/>
<br/>
“I knew you could do it. You’re over halfway there,” Rio encourages her. Agatha twirls her finger horizontally, as if to say <em> get on with it. </em><br/>
<br/>
“Four…” Rio takes her time looking Agatha up and down, and an all-too-familiar shiver takes over her senses once again. Is this when she’ll finally have Agatha do something humiliating? Something sexual? </p><p>Without breaking eye contact, Rio taps the empty spot on the sofa next to her. “Come sit with me, please.”<br/>
<br/>
It makes Agatha’s breath hitch— yes, okay, Rio asks her to come closer… It’s not quite sexual yet, so she can do it, right? This does not cross any boundaries. It’s very doable. It’s just proximity. It’s nothing unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, while making her way over to the sofa, she feels a knot in her stomach and a throb in her lower belly that has nothing to do with the fear of having her boundaries crossed. Some might call it anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
As she takes a seat next to Rio, with just a few inches between them, Agatha sucks in her bottom lip. She’s got this— just one more command. One last act of <em> obedience </em> before she can rub in Rio’s face that <em> of course she could do it. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> <em> Because she’s powerful enough to choose whether she wants to obey. </em><br/>
<br/>
It’s hardly the first time her body is so close to Rio’s, and yet the proximity makes her kinesthetic senses crackle with electricity. And when she feels Rio leaning in, she briefly closes her eyes while the one million possibilities of what could be coming next, cross her mind. Is Rio going to ask her to kiss her? To touch her? To… <em> touch herself, </em> even?<br/>
<br/>
From the corner of her eye, she watches Rio take one of her crutches, and softly stroke the metal. For a second, it looks like she might pick it up to use it, <em> for something, but for what? </em><br/>
<br/>
“Five,” Rio husks, her voice close to a whisper, and Agatha needs to squeeze her thighs together to keep herself in check, “I’d love for you to get back to your chair and watch a TV show of your choice.”<br/>
<br/>
“You— <em> what?” </em> Agatha whips her head around and blinks at her. “You want me to—”<br/>
<br/>
“To get comfortable in your chair and to watch a show. You heard me.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha wants to protest but no words come out of her mouth, so she bottles her confusion and walks back to her chair, switching the TV on with the remote.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn’t even get beyond the ‘choose an app’ screen before turning back around to Rio.<br/>
<br/>
“What the hell was that?”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, you did wonderfully, babe. Now you can relax.”<br/>
<br/>
“No, no, no, wait.” Agatha shakes her head in disbelief. “You could’ve let me do <em> anything, </em> and you make me close the fucking curtains and watch TV?”<br/>
<br/>
“Did you expect something else?”<br/>
<br/>
“Well— I would— I don’t know,” she throws her hands up in frustration. “I thought you would’ve… you know, wanted to try and humiliate me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Is that one of <em> your </em> goals as a Domme? To humiliate your subs without consulting them about it?”<br/>
<br/>
“What? No.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio flashes her a knowing smile, but it only sends Agatha further into orbit.<br/>
<br/>
“Jesus christ Rio, you could’ve made me strip, made me get you off, get on my fucking knees or something—”<br/>
<br/>
“And I didn’t,” says Rio, with a way too self-fucking-satisfied smile. “I think you’ve got something to think about, don’t you?”<br/>
<br/>
“What do you mean?”<br/>
<br/>
“Why are you so upset that I didn’t make you do anything sexual?”<br/>
<br/>
And of course, there’s an obvious answer to that. “Because… Because I—” She’ll come up with the answer any minute now— <br/>
<br/>
“Because you wanted me to?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s jaw snaps shut and she promptly looks away. There’s no way Rio deserves to see what’s going on behind her eyes right now. </p><p>“Seems like Agatha Harkness has a subspace after all.”<br/>
<br/>
And what is there to say to that? Even though Agatha knows it’s <em> not true, </em> there’s no way Rio is going to believe that now.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m going upstairs,” she snarls, and pushes herself out of the chair.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah? What are you gonna do upstairs?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m—” Agatha looks around the room. “Ironing. I’ve got ironing to do.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio laughs knowingly. “You’re right, it’s high time.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha flips her off before walking toward the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, Agatha?”<br/>
<br/>
She <em> doesn’t </em> want to turn around and grace Rio with her attention, but for some reason, she does stop in her tracks to listen.<br/>
<br/>
“You know where to find me if you want five more commands.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s the middle of the night when a sound makes Agatha stir in her sleep. A floorboard creaking, maybe, the howling of the wind, or something else without a mere sliver of respect for her beauty sleep.<br/>
She turns onto her other side and pulls up the covers a little higher.</p><p>But then the sound happens again, and it seems eerily close by— in the room, even. Agatha pushes herself up on one elbow and lifts her sleep mask up from one eye, squinting to try and see in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
At first she sees nothing, and she’s about to let herself fall back on the mattress again when she clocks a moving shadow by the door of her walk-in closet. The door creaks open and a shiver runs down Agatha’s spine when she realizes that the door’s movement is not caused by a draught, but by something <em> living.  </em></p><p>Something that looks like— something that sounds like—<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Rio! </em> What the fuck?!” Agatha calls out, her voice hoarse from sleep.<br/>
<br/>
In the dark, she can vaguely make out Rio’s hunched over profile as she halts her movements, caught in the act. A few breaths pass.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, Agatha,” Rio whispers at the top of her lungs. How <em> considerate</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Waiting for Rio to explain herself, Agatha slow-blinks to adjust her eyes. However, Rio apparently deems her casual greeting more than enough acknowledgement of the situation, and she continues her creep walk toward the closet.<br/>
<br/>
Which could have been a haunting experience, if not for the clumsy <em> clank-clank </em> of her metal cane on the hardwood floor.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks have passed since the accident, and much to Agatha’s dismay, Rio had been allowed to forgo her crutches inside the house in favor of a cane, slowly easing her back into putting a little bit of weight onto her still cast-wrapped leg as per her doctor’s advice.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha had been delighted at first, perhaps even more than Rio, at the prospect of not having to report for duty at Rio’s every beck and call. Delight had quickly turned into irascibility and a throbbing migraine when she’d realized that Rio being back on her feet— or foot, singular— equals a toddler at the height of their excitement about taking their first steps.<br/>
<br/>
She had contemplated putting a lock on the cupboards and placing her glassware out of reach when Rio’s new predicament had turned out to be feeding into her boredom instead of giving her more freedom. Yes, she could walk— or limp— through the house now, but unfortunately for both women, that meant more distractions and more incentive to combat that boredom. </p><p>The absurdity of Rio’s current presence in her room hasn’t quite turned into something Agatha can make sense of yet, so she slides her sleep mask up to her forehead and she rubs her eyeballs with her forefinger and thumb. </p><p>While the self-induced dots slowly disappear from her vision, she hears a drawer sliding open, the <em> clonk </em> of wood hitting metal, and a breathy curse. </p><p>“What the hell are you doing?” Agatha hisses in an angry whisper— not that there’s a reason to keep her voice down. It’s just the law of the night and Agatha is nothing if not a rule follower.<br/>
<br/>
“You keep any sex toys in here?” Rio’s muffled voice sounds from inside her closet.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha feels the urge to rub her ears too. “What?” <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Sex toys— do you keep them in here somewhere? I thought I saw…”<br/>
<br/>
“By all means, help yourself <em> ,” </em> Agatha says, voice dripping with performative kindness.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah I’m <em> trying, </em> but I can’t find— oh! This one looks— no. Oh hey, I have this one too, in a different color! Do you have something like— ah. Woah, fuck! I want to try— never mind, battery’s dead.”<br/>
<br/>
There’s a shuffling sound, and Rio’s shadow appears in the doorway, but smaller this time: she’s sitting on her ass and scoots herself forward with her good leg. She holds up one of Agatha’s air pressure vibrators up in her left hand.<br/>
<br/>
“Did you not charge this, or is it battery-powered?”</p><p>“Rio, I genuinely don’t know what the fuck is going on right now.” </p><p>“Keep up, Agatha. It’s been me and my own fingers and me for <em>weeks. </em>I’m sure you can imagine a girl needs to change it up every now and then.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha blinks again and realizes it doesn’t make much of a difference if her eyes are closed; she can barely see anyway. But having her eyes closed feels good, it’s what her sleepy body needs—<br/>
<br/>
“It’s the absolute dead of the goddamn night…” she mumbles into the darkness, and that’s when she concludes: this scenario doesn’t make sense at all. She’s either sick, dying, or dreaming. And as she knows it isn’t yet her time, a lazy smirk casts over her face as she lets herself fall backward into her fluffy pillow.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment during which neither woman moves, Agatha folds a corner of the comforter open, creating an empty space in the shape of a triangle beside her.<br/>
<br/>
“Well? Get in here,” she says, calmly patting the spot next to her when Rio doesn’t move, wiggling her own body comfortably back into the mattress. Again, a stunned silence follows.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you sure?” Rio’s voice eventually sounds, a mix of suspicious concern and giddy excitement.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re not gonna find better than <em>these</em> in my closet, baby,” Agatha says in a low, gravelly whisper, moving her hand up in the air to suggestively curve her middle- and ring finger into her palm, even though it’s too dark to see. If this is the scenario her subconcious mind provides her with, she might as well exploit it.<br/>
<br/>
More shuffling follows; the sound of one bare foot finding grip on the hardwood floor, something heavy sliding in her direction, the <em>thump </em>of a hard cast hitting the floor, and a strained groan. Then, something small hits the mattress and bounces once, before a subtle buzzing sound carries through the room.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh… you <em>did </em>charge it,” Rio says sheepishly before hoisting herself up on the bed. Agatha snorts, reaches out to turn the vibrator off, and holds up one side of the comforter for Rio to get under.<br/>
<br/>
“Uh–”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s hesitation is palpable, almost as if thrown off by this soft, easy side of Agatha. But in this apparent dream world, there’s no need or patience for coyness.<br/>
Agatha blindly reaches out with her other hand and scrunches her fist around the fabric of Rio’s sleep shirt when she finds it. She gives it a sharp tug, and a rich, floral smell that is so distinctly<em> Rio</em> accompanies the small gust of air that follows Rio toppling over, her upper body landing half across Agatha’s chest with a surprised <em>oof. </em><br/>
<br/>
“Lay back, babe,” Agatha whispers against her face, dropping her hand to Rio’s hip and turning their bodies so that they’re both on their sides, facing each other. She feels Rio’s breath hitch and the chuckles; she pulls their bodies flush by hooking her leg around her hip, while Rio finds the edge of the comforter and drapes it over the both of them, tugging it up to their faces.<br/>
<br/>
“What’s gotten into you?” Rio asks softly, a small giggle escaping her throat. “Are you fucking <em>snuggling </em>me?”<br/>
<br/>
“Mmm, no,” Agatha says, nuzzling Rio’s face with her nose. Here, in the safety of her own imagination and their makeshift cocoon, it’s so much easier to follow her impulses.</p><p>To shut her brain down and act according to what her body needs, without consequences. </p><p>To give in to everything that feels <em> good, </em> to give in to the undeniable pull that is Rio, flame to her moth, capable of turning her into an idiot pile of loser mush if she won’t keep her guard up.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha drags her hand up and down Rio’s thigh before giving her ass cheek a squeeze.<br/>
“Turn around,” she says, unnecessarily so as she single-handedly wrangles Rio onto her other side, her right side, essentially turning her into the little spoon. She closes her eyes and snakes her arm around Rio’s waist, grinding her own hips against the curve of the ass of the woman now tightly pressed up against her. </p><p>Again, Rio lets out a surprised, but no less amused sound. “Agatha? I’m not complaining, but—”<br/>
<br/>
“Ssh, ssh, ssh,” Agatha interrupts her, rubbing soothing circles with her thumb on Rio’s bare lower stomach, her hand having slipped under where her shirt has ridden up. “Then don’t.”<br/>
<br/>
After another firm press of her own pelvis against the other woman’s ass, her hand travels down lower, past the waistband of Rio’s shorts, while she buries her nose in the crook of Rio’s neck. She hums approvingly when her fingers are met with more bare skin and a tactile patch of hair, through which she teasingly runs her nails.<br/>
<br/>
“Did you know you’re summoning the dream demons if you sleep commando?” she mumbles against Rio’s ear lobe, which makes the other woman shiver.<br/>
<br/>
“You gotta let her <em> breathe, </em> Agatha. Don’t tell me you confine her during the night?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha lets out a low chuckle, and retracts her hand to find Rio’s wrist and guide it toward the hem of her own nightgown. She then wraps Rio’s fingers to press them right up against her own bare pussy, making her groan as Rio now lets her fingers run through Agatha’s pubic hair.<br/>
<br/>
“I know, dear. And apparently I did summon a dream demon,” she whispers while she pulls their hands away, and finds her way back into Rio’s shorts.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Oh </em> …”<br/>
<br/>
The moment two of Agatha’s fingers connect to Rio’s outer lips, a soft sigh leaves her mouth. She traces them, gently teasing and carefully avoiding her clit, and when she realizes that she’s definitely felt Rio wetter before, she doesn’t even think when she sinks her teeth in the side of Rio’s neck.<br/>
<br/>
Rio gasps in surprise and her body jolts, sending her hips backward against Agatha’s core, who takes the opportunity to buck right back into her, pressing her hips flush with Rio’s ass. She moves forward so forcefully that Rio’s pussy gets pushed against her hand, effectively trapping her between Agatha’s strong hips against her back and her scrutinizing hand against her front.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Powermove, </em> her mind provides smugly, and Agatha makes a mental note to try this when she’s awake.<br/>
<br/>
“Did they never teach you that stealing other people’s toys is bad?” she murmurs against the skin of her neck that now displays faint teeth marks, which she softly laps at with her tongue. <br/>
<br/>
“Did they never teach you to share?” Rio bites back, but her defiant tone quickly turns into a whimper when Agatha spreads her folds with her thumb and middle finger, opening up her increasingly slick pussy. She briefly dips her index finger into her entrance —just the tip, not even an inch— to gather some of the moisture and swipe it up to her clit. But oh, she’s not <em> that </em> generous, so she circles it exactly once and withdraws her hand once more.<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring Rio’s complaining grunt, Agatha feels around the mattress to collect the earlier discarded vibrator. She needs Rio’s shorts off for what’s about to happen next, so she gives the fabric a compelling tug, springing the younger woman into action. She shimmies the shorts down her legs while still on her side, careful not to get them stuck on her cast. </p><p>The feeling of the cool, naked skin of Rio’s ass against Agatha’s pelvis, makes both women moan. Agatha can’t help herself, and gives the inviting taut glutes another firm squeeze.<br/>
<br/>
“You’ve never used one of these before?” Agatha asks while she presses a button to make the suction vibrator come to life. Upon a shake of Rio’s head, Agatha smirks at the prospect of what a first experience this will be for her.<br/>
“Open yourself up for me, pretty girl.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio, still on her side, lifts her broken left leg and plants the sole of her foot on the mattress, knee up, creating space between her thighs. Agatha’s approving hum spurs her on to bring both her forefingers to her pussy, spreading herself open to expose her clit.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha manages to bring her hand, now holding the vibrator, around to Rio’s front again. She seeks out the exact location of Rio’s clit with a scrutinizing finger, making her sigh and shudder when she finds it. “This is where it feels good, huh?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah,” Rio exhales weakly, maybe a bit sleepily even— well, that’s not going to last long. With the precision of a neurosurgeon, Agatha angles the suction head just right and brings it down, enveloping Rio’s swollen clit perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
The gasp that immediately leaves her body is music to Agatha’s ears; Rio gulps for air and snaps her thighs shut, trapping Agatha’s hand and the vibrator tightly between tensing and shuddering muscles.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Oh! </em> What the… <em> what the fuck!” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Yeah, that is about the reaction Agatha had expected.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s entire lower body shakes and trashes, and in the rare moment she isn’t cursing, a long, continuous, quivering moan leaves her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
“There’s n-n-n-o-o— <em> oh! </em> gentle build up with— ah, fuck— this thing!”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha smirks again and presses the button three times, intensifying the suction even more. The responsive jolts of Rio’s body make Agatha hook her left leg around Rio’s to keep it in place, and she has to put some weight onto the arm wrapped around Rio’s body too. The effort it takes to keep the vibrator in place vaguely reminds her of riding a mechanical bull.<br/>
<br/>
It feels <em> so good</em>; the sensation of a writhing Rio in her arms, being able to use that as an excuse to press their bodies so tightly together, knowing she’s about to send Rio halfway across the galaxy with an impending explosive orgasm…<br/>
<br/>
But it can feel even <em> better. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Hold this for me,” Agatha says, her voice low and demanding. Rio immediately takes over —she’s pretty sure there’s not much Rio wouldn’t agree to in this state— and holds the buzzing vibrator against herself while Agatha withdraws her hand, only to find her way back to Rio’s pussy from the other side, sliding her palm down her ass and between her thighs from behind.<br/>
<br/>
“Want me inside?” she husks as she circles Rio’s entrance with two fingers, gently massaging the edges.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>YES!” </em>Rio breathily calls out, and Agatha briefly wonders if she’s ever heard her being this needy. It’s nothing but delicious— and to keep her like this, what is there to do but give her what she wants? </p><p>Slowly, <em> very </em> slowly, Agatha slides one finger inside Rio’s warm heat, stretching her walls as she gets deeper. She can feel Rio pressing herself down, immediately asking for more. Her high-pitched moaning gets interrupted by a low grunt, and Agatha feels herself getting lightheaded at the thought of Rio losing control so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
When she slips a second finger in, she starts feeling around for Rio’s sweet spot, scissoring her fingers inside of her.<br/>
<br/>
“Ah– <em> ah— fuck!” </em> Rio’s ragged breaths sound almost delirious. “Oh god, oh fuck, <em> oh fuck— </em> so good, oh that's good<em>, fuck—” </em><br/>
<br/>
Agatha has half a mind to stop and reach for her phone to record the noise Rio is making. She would set it as her alarm, her timer, her ringtone. Make a playlist, put it on shuffle, and meditate to the sounds of Rio’s imminent climax— maybe listen to them at the gym, too. If anyone would ask her what she’s listening to that makes her break extra sweat on the stairmaster, she could always say “<em>motivational affirmations</em>”. Or <em> “a voice coach for workouts”. </em> To keep people from asking her to share the playlist, she should probably say “<em>classic beats” </em> or “<em>newly released bangers”, </em>technically not even a lie. </p><p>“Ag— Agatha, I need you to stop, I need you to stop <em> right now.”<br/>
<br/>
</em> Rio roughly pulls her from her own thoughts with an alarming tone in her voice. Agatha instantly slows down her pace, concerned something’s wrong.<br/>
<br/>
“Yellow? Or red?” she checks in with the still writhing woman.<br/>
<br/>
“No,” Rio says in a strained voice, and barely suppresses a sob. “I need you to stop because I’m going to… Because I’m— oh <em> fuck, fuck, fuck, </em>Agatha, I can’t hold it in!”<br/>
<br/>
A string of expletives follows as Rio’s voice gradually raises an octave, her warnings getting less and less coherent. Agatha, who has now caught on, bites her bottom lip to stifle a moan of her own.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh no,” she says in a mocking tone. “Can’t have that, of course.” She knows what Rio is trying to prevent, but Agatha wants nothing more than for it to happen. And because she always, <em> always </em> gets what she wants, she curves her fingers just right, stimulating a spot of Rio’s inner walls that make her squeeze her eyes shut and talk through gritted teeth.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m serious, fuck, I’m so, so serious, I’m not gonna be able to hold it in,” she keens almost in a panic, but Agatha has asked her for a safeword which she hasn’t given her, and on top of that, Rio is still holding the vibrator against herself— she might be ‘<em>so, so serious’, </em> but Agatha’s not an idiot. Rio does not want her to stop, she’s just being <em> polite.  </em></p><p>“Are you going to squirt all over the bed, babe?” Agatha taunts softly in her ear, her words articulated well and spoken slowly. “Is my little toy doing it for you?”<br/>
<br/>
Is it the best idea to make the bed wet in the middle of the night, when neither of them is probably going to want to change the sheets? Maybe not— but this is a dream, she'll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
“Do it, Rio. Ruin the mattress. Come all over the fucking sheets,” she challenges her, increasing the pace of her curling fingers. She realizes how much her words are affecting Rio, and she’s got way more where that came from.<br/>
<br/>
“Or is it all just big talk? Can’t actually do it, can you? ‘<em>Oh Agatha, I can’t hold it in’,” </em> Agatha mocks her, invigorating her words by putting even more force behind her movements.<br/>
<br/>
“Please,” Rio mewls in desperation, but neither woman knows what exactly she’s asking for. <br/>
<br/>
“Prove it to me. Come on Rio, I want to feel it, want to feel you <em> soak </em> the bed— and me, god, I need you to <em> fucking </em> spray me like—”<br/>
<br/>
With one last, violent, long shake of her entire body, Rio releases. <em> Really </em> releases; not only her muscles or the tension in her lower belly, but just like Agatha had asked, a few spurts of liquid leave her pulsating pussy in quick succession, soaking the sheets and Agatha’s thighs.<br/>
<br/>
Both women moan, and the feeling of her thighs getting sprayed causes such a forceful twitch of her own clit, Agatha nearly comes on the spot. Out of sheer impulse and unrelenting need, she brings her hand up to her own mouth and languidly laps at her own palm, desperate for another one of her senses to enjoy what had just transpired.<br/>
<br/>
When her orgasm fades away, Rio chucks the vibrator to the side as if it had offended her, not even bothering to turn it off. She turns onto her stomach and buries her face in a pillow, muffling a grunt that somehow embodies embarrassment, exhaustion, and pure bliss all in one.<br/>
Agatha turns onto her back, chuckles breathlessly at the ceiling, and gently places a palm on Rio’s bare ass cheek; a gesture of comfort and regulation.<br/>
<br/>
That’s when the puddle underneath her starts to cool down very quickly, causing a slightly unpleasant sensation against her skin. It’s cold, it’s wet, and strangely… real.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha brings her other hand to her own thigh, dragging her fingers through the remnants of Rio’s release, then holds them up in front of her face. She wiggles her fingers to test her own fine motor control, and her eyes widen at the realization—<br/>
<br/>
Wait, wait, <em> wait… </em>  <br/>
<br/>
Her hand lands back on her thigh with such force, a loud <em> smack </em> is audible. She claws her fingers and digs three fingernails into her skin, wincing at the sharp pinch it causes.<br/>
<br/>
“Rio?” she says, her voice hoarse. She’s not sure she even wants to know what she’s about to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Rio answers by huffing into the pillow once more.<br/>
<br/>
“This isn’t real, is it?”<br/>
<br/>
And that seems an absurd enough question to make Rio lift her head, her brows knit in confusion before her expression turns into a lazy grin.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t blame you for being impressed, I even surprised <em> myself—” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “No, no. I’m asleep, right? This isn’t really happening?”<br/>
<br/>
<em> Please. Wake up. You’ve done and said some things that… no. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Rio turns her whole body toward Agatha again, reaching out to draw patterns through the proof of her own ecstasy on Agatha’s thigh.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you asking me if this is a dream?” she asks, her chuckle half smug and half incredulous.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha tries to avoid Rio’s gaze, not ready to read whatever she’ll find in her eyes, but she inevitably locks on anyway. She screams at herself internally when she realizes how clear her mind is, and how much control she has over noticing Rio’s micro-expressions, how many of her senses are registering input simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
So did Rio catch her in a momentary lapse of reason?</p><p>But wait, Agatha can’t be the one to take all the blame, can she? Rio had waltzed into her bedroom in the middle of the night, demanding attention, <em> not stopping her </em> when Agatha invited her into her bed…<br/>
<br/>
“If I’m not asleep, and you’re not asleep, and we are having sex— then why were you so… compliant?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio huffs out a laugh. “I don’t know. You really sold it to me this time.”<br/>
<br/>
“But I didn’t even threaten you. Or demand, or restrain, or yell—”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah. Exactly.” Rio groans and closes her eyes, rubbing her thighs together with a smug smile on her face. “And it was <em> fucking </em> hot. <em> ”  </em></p><p>Agatha pretends not to notice how much lasciviousness the other woman still radiates, and opts to show defiance instead. “So it doesn’t make sense to me why you would just… surrender.”<br/>
<br/>
“Mm, Agatha,” Rio’s strained chuckle sounds almost painful. “It’s because you didn’t put on an act to be in charge. You just <em> were.”  </em></p><p>Agatha opens her mouth, and then closes it again as a rush of power and confidence, mixed with a sliver of confusion, sears through her veins. The longer she stares at Rio, the more terrain her confusion wins, until she eventually peels Rio’s hand off her thigh and pushes it away.<br/>
<br/>
“We’re not doing this,” she says, her voice raspy. She might’ve been in control just now, but the whole situation is rapidly slipping from her grasp. “You shouldn’t have come in here. This is not— we’re not supposed to—”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s fixed look is unwavering, there are tiny lights dancing in her eyes, however her expression seems neutral. It throws her off, and being thrown off makes her want to kick and scream.<br/>
<br/>
“We shouldn’t have sex anymore,” she wills her voice to be steady, ignoring the protesting throb of her own cunt, “I know we said this many times, but this is— this isn’t going anywhere. We’re stuck, yeah? We both want something more, but we want something from each other we can’t give, it’s just going to be frustrating for everyone involved.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio silently nods in understanding, which empowers her to keep talking. But why is her breathing getting heavier and why— why is she licking her lips? Does she <em> not </em> understand what Agatha is saying?<br/>
<br/>
“You can stay here until your cast comes off, but then you need to leave, okay? And we need some space. We can’t— we can’t see each other anymore. Got it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Got it,” Rio confirms with a sincere nod, which Agatha mimics. “Good.”<br/>
<br/>
And then Rio’s lips are on hers— or her lips are on Rio’s, she’s not sure; but it’s hot, heavy, and they claw at each other like wild animals while their bodies meet in the wet center of the mattress, fully pressed up against each other. </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha breathes into her mouth, her hand cupping the back of Rio’s head while her thighs are being pried open by a demanding knee.<br/>
<br/>
The whole world may collapse around her, as long as she can keep drinking Rio in like this.<br/>
<br/>
But she’s not done being overwhelmed by Rio, because her ears start to ring when she softly gasps: “Give me a command, Agatha.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha rips her face away from Rio’s to take in her expression, to see if she is mocking her somehow. But the blissful look and the desperate parting of her lips, her short breaths… Rio’s dead serious. Did she— did she get her to slip into subspace?<br/>
<br/>
She can’t believe this gift that has just fallen into her lap, ready to unwrap, ready to take on with both hands, to devour, to envelop, to ruin… one command, she has been granted <em> one command </em> to prove to Rio what she’s made of, that she can take the responsibility of giving her the absolute best experience she can think of…<br/>
<br/>
But her brain short-circuits. She can almost visualize the sparks flying from her scalp, sizzling and creaking while the cogs in her head come to a screeching halt.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Come on, think! </em> She can’t let this beautiful present go to waste, not when it’s everything she’s been wanting. But the panting woman in her arms makes her so goddamn horny, her whole system breaks down. She’s got nothing, can <em> think </em> of nothing, there’s only feeling left; the primal impulse to drop into her own body and <em> feel— </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Just kiss me,” she blurts out, damning herself because is that <em> really </em> the best thing she can come up with?<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, it doesn’t really matter when Rio wholeheartedly obeys, wraps her hands around the base of Agatha’s skull, and fucking kisses her. Kisses her like the world is actually collapsing, just like she had been imagining. Kisses her like it could be the only thing keeping both of them alive.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s tongue, her lips, her firm grip of her head, her subconsciously gyrating hips: it’s almost too much, it’s too good, <em> she’s </em> too good. It’s thorough, it’s confident, it’s so, so sexy and it sets her brain on fire. Rio is laying a claim on her and the only thing Agatha can do is take it, as she feels her last bit of dominance slide out of her ears.<br/>
<br/>
“Give me one,” she murmurs against Rio’s unrelenting lips, pressing herself even further up against her body. “Give me a command.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio gasps in surprise, taking her lips off of Agatha’s for just a moment, before her exhale turns into a groan and she dives right back in, sucking at Agatha’s tongue like it’s a long yearned for delicacy.<br/>
<br/>
“Spread your legs for me and let me lick you clean,” Rio husks eventually.<br/>
<br/>
Fuck. Yeah, that’s way better than what Agatha came up with.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha doesn’t even have it in her to protest, so she shifts onto her back and lets her knees fall open, giving Rio full access to whatever she wants. Rio hums approvingly and sends one of her hands down first to cup her pussy under her nightgown.<br/>
<br/>
The feeling of her cool hand against her hot flesh makes Agatha whimper, so while Rio hikes up the gown for better access, she wraps up the kiss to let Agatha breathe. Without hesitation, Rio disappears under the comforter, and the next thing she knows, Agatha feels a hot, wet tongue lapping at her thighs, and goosebumps all over her body.<br/>
<br/>
Rio licks her clean like she expects an inspection later, not skipping over a single inch of skin, and often getting annoyingly close to the crease where Agatha’s thigh turns into her vulva. It takes every bit of strength to not guide Rio’s head to where she wants her.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for her, when Rio seems to find that she’s done a decent job, she emerges from under the covers and crawls up, hovering over Agatha on her hands and knees to not put any weight on her lower leg. She dives in for another kiss while softly requesting another command.<br/>
<br/>
This time, Agatha’s mind is much clearer. <br/>
<br/>
"Finish the fucking job,” she sighs, sliding one hand into Rio’s hair to pull her back down. “Lick me till I come.”<br/>
<br/>
From the way Rio’s eyes roll back into her head, she gauges that Rio doesn’t hate the idea. And she’s right— when she disappears under the covers once again, she barely wastes any time finding her way to her dripping cunt, immediately lapping up long stripes from her entrance to her clit.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha feels borderline weightless. She knows Rio has a skilled tongue, but she’s so used to her teasing and edging. Now that she doesn’t, she can finally feel <em> exactly </em> how skilled her tongue is.<br/>
Rio doesn’t just give head; she combines technique with incredibly meticulous reactions to the way Agatha’s body responds, elevating the entire thing to a form of art. Agatha <em> feels </em> like a piece of art. The two of them should be doing this in a museum, making everybody learn and appreciate how it’s done.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn’t take long for the familiar pull in her lower belly to tense up to the point of breaking, and she’s so, <em> so </em> ready to go there…<br/>
<br/>
Which is when Rio licks a path up over her mound, through her patch of hair, toward her navel, and bites in the soft flesh of her belly before hovering over Agatha’s face again, a smug smile on her face.<br/>
<br/>
“What the fuck? <em> What the fuck?” </em> Agatha cries, completely out of breath, rubbing her thighs together for friction.<br/>
<br/>
“You said: ‘Lick me<em> till </em>I come’<em>. </em> Not ‘Lick me till <em>after </em>I've come'<em>.</em>” <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Oh, and that winning expression on Rio’s face, this stupid smart-assery, it makes her livid, it makes her helpless, it makes her… succumb?<br/>
<br/>
<em> Get your tongue back on my pussy before I finish this myself, </em> is what she wants to say. However, the words come out a little bit differently:<br/>
<br/>
“Another. Another command, Rio.” She hates how weak her voice sounds, but Rio clearly doesn’t.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha watches her contemplate something as her eyes flick to a spot on the pillow, right above Agatha’s head. Rio reaches out and plucks the sleeping mask from Agatha's wild, tangled hair; it must have slid off somewhere in the process. She dangles it in front of Agatha’s face between two fingers. “Put this on, cover your eyes.”<br/>
<br/>
<em> No, absolutely not. </em> There’s <em> no way— </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Trust me, sweetheart. I’ve got you.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s steady voice, even though it’s barely more than a whisper, somehow compels Agatha to take the mask from her and stretch the elastic band over her head. Before she can get scared and back out, she pulls it down over her eyes. The last thing she sees before her world turns dark, is a praising wink from Rio.<br/>
<br/>
What happens next, Agatha can’t describe as anything but worship. She can feel Rio crawl down her body, a bit clumsily because of her leg, and hike up her nightgown to gain full access to her upper body. She feels kisses, bites, licks, and the occasional suck on her sensitive skin, on her chest, her ribs, her belly, and for a full five minutes on her breasts. Her muscles have grown so weak, she probably wouldn’t even be able to lift an arm if she tried. </p><p>Just when she thinks it’s over, just when she thinks Rio has run out of energy, or appreciation for her body for that matter, her damn near holy tongue lands perfectly on her clit again.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn’t know why, doesn’t <em> want </em> to know why, but from the first flick of Rio’s tongue, it’s suddenly so easy to let go. She moans, <em> loudly, </em> without any sense of shame or embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
And as she feels her body sink down into the mattress while her spirit gets lifted higher and higher, somewhere in the back of her mind she knows: they’re about to have a long, <em> long </em> conversation. </p>

<p>That conversation, naturally, doesn’t happen.<br/>
<br/>
On the morning of Rio’s cast removal, both Agatha and Rio eat their breakfast in silence, a palpable tension between them; the anticipation of what happens next.<br/>
<br/>
Since Agatha doesn’t have the means to voice her feelings about Rio’s imminent absence, she does the next best thing: she lashes out. </p><p>“I can’t believe the day has finally come,” she says airily, cutting a few strawberries over her bowl of yogurt. “The day my kitchen cupboards will stop looking like I live with a prepubescent boy.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio pouts down into her bowl of oatmeal. Her jaw shifts while she stirs it with her spoon. The next moment she sticks out her tongue to show off a miniature green dinosaur right on the tip.<br/>
<br/>
“The dino eggs make me feel like an archeologist,” she says with a strong lisp. “It’s like a special search mission in every bowl.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha stares her down, unimpressed, until Rio gets the hint and swallows the dinosaur.<br/>
<br/>
“I also like to name them all. That was Larry.”<br/>
<br/>
“I rest my case,” Agatha deadpans, and she shoves an aggressive spoonful of yogurt into her mouth to show how annoying and not cute she finds Rio’s antics.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha spends the early afternoon gathering all of Rio’s things that have been scattered around the house over the last few weeks. It’s interesting how much stuff an injured person, temporarily unable to walk, can accumulate despite everything. A person who had no business staying at her house for that long, a person she has no responsibility over, a person who had gone from stranger to someone in her near vicinity almost twenty-four seven.<br/>
<br/>
But Rio had been an idiot, and Rio had needed help. And Agatha had, deeply altruistically, stepped up, because what else is she supposed to do when another human is in need?  </p><p>“Are you ready to— oh.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha stops dead in her tracks on her way to the front door, the strap of Rio’s last duffel bag in the crook of her elbow.<br/>
<br/>
Rio had been waiting on the living room couch for Agatha to finish rummaging around and must’ve gotten bored; she is fast asleep, with soft snoring sounds coming from her slightly parted lips.<br/>
<br/>
But that’s not what makes Agatha’s heart skip a beat— no, it’s the fact that Rio's half-upright sleeping body is curled up against Psycho, equally conked out, with his chin resting on Rio’s stomach and his fluffy tail protectively draped over her cast.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha wants to move and wake them up, because it’s time to <em> go, </em> but someone has somehow glued the soles of her shoes to the hardwood floor.<br/>
Also, someone is somehow guiding her hand to take her phone out of her pocket, open the camera app, frame her dog and her… liability, and snap a picture of them both. She looks at the result for a second before there’s an unpleasant tug at her heart, so she locks her phone and continues the original plan.<br/>
<br/>
“Alright, let’s go!” Agatha shouts, loudly clapping her hands. “Time to get you your freedom back!”<br/>
<br/>
Rio jolts awake and Agatha pretends she didn't know she was asleep in the first place. “Oops.”<br/>
<br/>
When she hands Rio her cane and helps her up one last time, it takes an enormous amount of effort to keep her mind from drifting to the fact that this might be the last time she’ll have Rio at her house. After this, there’s no reason for them to see each other again. Rio won’t need her help anymore, they’re not friends, <em> not really, </em> and they’re definitely not… something else.<br/>
<br/>
And that’s <em> fine, </em> Agatha thinks when she follows Rio out the front door. That’s <em> fine, </em> she thinks, locking it behind them. It’s totally <em> fine, </em> she thinks while throwing the last bag in the trunk and making her way to the driver’s seat.<br/>
<br/>
It’s <em> fine.  </em></p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Doctor Strange happens to live up to his name; he is weirdly cheerful as he talks Rio through the process. After clearing her X-rays he insists on removing her cast himself as opposed to leaving it to one of the nurses, causing a shiver to run down Agatha’s spine.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, it’s Rio who saves them all from an awkward situation when she looks up at the saw and asks if <em> she </em> can cut her own cast.<br/>
<br/>
Doctor Strange’s eyebrows shoot up in happy surprise, and Agatha almost wells up at Rio’s capability to save herself from almost any social interaction, and getting to do something cool in the process.<br/>
<br/>
After showing her that the electric saw can’t cut through skin, by holding it up against his own arm, Strange hands Rio the saw and tells her to cut down a vertical line.<br/>
<br/>
Rio nods, takes the medical instrument from him, and places it against her cast. Her tongue pokes out in concentration as she slowly works through the hardened plaster, and the closer to the bottom she gets, the more rapid her breathing gets.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh my god,” she calls out in relief when the thing finally splits in two. “Best feeling ever!”<br/>
<br/>
She hands Doctor Strange the saw and he puts it away, after which he breaks the remainder of the cast from her leg. Agatha realizes Rio’s relief has quickly turned into a concerned furrow in her brow, and when she follows her line of sight, she sees why.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s leg, her ex-broken leg, is skinny as a toothpick— her shin bone clearly visible through the thin layer of skin.<br/>
<br/>
“That will resolve itself with the proper amount of physical therapy,” Strange reassures her, answering Rio’s unasked question. “And keep using the cane for at least two more weeks. You’ll feel out of balance while your muscles grow back to their original strength.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio nods in understanding, but Agatha can’t help but notice her cheerfulness hasn’t quite returned. Agatha knows Rio had always had an active life, so her leg looking like a twig and the prospect of hours and hours of therapy before she’ll be back to normal again— yes, she can imagine that would require some processing time.<br/>
<br/>
“Doctor—” Rio’s voice cracks, so she clears her throat and tries again, “please, doctor, am I allowed to drive?”<br/>
<br/>
Strange gives her a lopsided smile. “A car, I hope? As long as it’s an automatic, I don’t see why not. You won’t want to handle a clutch with that swizzle stick of yours.”<br/>
<br/>
Before Agatha can punch him, Rio exhales loudly. “Oh god. Okay. Good.”<br/>
<br/>
“Did you miss driving that badly?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s eyes shift to where Agatha is sitting, and quickly back to the doctor. “Yes… and no. But if I spend one more minute as <em> her </em> passenger,” she says, flicking a thumb in Agatha’s direction, “I might be back for another X-ray far sooner than you think.”<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>And Agatha really shouldn’t have rewarded that by letting her in the driver’s seat on the way back, but the sparkle in Rio’s eyes when she all but begged for the keys was something that Agatha had quickly needed to ban from her vision before it could make her feel things.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s an automatic, too. That <em> has </em> to be a sign, Agatha,” Rio had whined, unaware of the fact that Agatha was already going to say yes.<br/>
<br/>
“All cars are, nowadays,” Agatha had huffed.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>I</em> wouldn’t buy an automatic! I’m a <em> real </em> driver, I’ve only owned manuals before.”<br/>
<br/>
“Just don’t kill us,” Agatha had said with a roll of her eyes, throwing her the keys over the roof of the car.<br/>
<br/>
Now, to emphasize her warning, Agatha is dramatically holding onto the handle while Rio goes 24 in a 25, mimicking Rio’s theatrics from when Agatha had been her Uber driver.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you mind if I add a stop on the way home?” Rio asks in a voice carrying so much innocence that Agatha doesn’t trust her one bit. </p><p>“If it’s a KFC, sure. If it’s Church’s, I’d rather you didn’t.” </p><p>Rio chews on her lip as she flicks the blinker on and comes to a stop at a red light.<br/>
<br/>
“Actually… I’d like to go see Victoria. They're keeping her at the police station.” Rio angles her head to be able to look up from under the visor, and stares at the stoplight so intensely she almost burns a hole through it. </p><p>“Oh,” Agatha says in surprise. <em> She wants to visit her totaled bike? </em><em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em>“Well, sure.” In the name of closure, or whatever. </p><p>The light goes green and Rio turns onto the main road. As she picks up speed, her hand hovers toward the stick, and Agatha has a few milliseconds to register what is happening— which is when her life-saving reflex kicks in and she slaps Rio’s hand away.<br/>
<br/>
“Ow! What the fuck?!”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s an <em> automatic!” </em> Agatha hisses. “If you try to shift, the engine blows up!”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh. Right,” Rio says, shaking her hand to relieve the pain. Mumbling, she adds: “No need to be so dramatic.”<br/>
<br/>
“You already totaled one vehicle, I’m not going to let you break mine. <em> With me in it</em>.”<br/>
<br/>
“That wasn’t my fault!”<br/>
<br/>
“That doesn’t matter! Now can you please drive like a normal person?”<br/>
<br/>
“Says <em> you! </em> You’re the one who’s an absolute maniac on the road!”<br/>
<br/>
“The road is wild and wicked, Rio. And if you can’t beat them, you should join them.” </p><p>Their continued bickering causes a throbbing vein on both of their foreheads by the time Rio pulls up to the police station. </p><p>When she gets out of the car, Rio frowns so violently that her brows cover half her eyes. It would’ve been upsetting, or even intimidating, if she didn’t have to retrieve her cane from the backseat to angrily wobble toward the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha quickly checks for CCTV, because if just one of the cameras catches the wide grin on her face as she watches Rio from the back, she’ll have to return with a baseball bat to destroy all physical hard drives on the premises.<br/>
<br/>
She just about manages to smooth out her face before following Rio in.<br/>
<br/>
“Hi, I’m here to see Victoria,” Rio still somewhat grumpily tells the reception desk guy, who has a comically large mustache. <em> Is that a requirement for white police officers?  </em></p><p>“Do you have an appointment? What’s your name?”<br/>
<br/>
“No I don’t. Rio Vidal, here to see Victoria,” she repeats herself.<br/>
<br/>
“Victoria…” Officer Mustache scratches his chin. “I’m not sure if she’s working today.”<br/>
<br/>
“Not sure if she’s…” Rio rolls her eyes at the realization. “Victoria is my <em> bike, </em> you id— sir.”<br/>
<br/>
She seems to discern just in time that, no matter her mood, insulting a police officer is never a good idea. Mustache raises a warning eyebrow to confirm that thought.<br/>
<br/>
“Let me see,” he mumbles, rolling the desk chair back to a cabinet full of folders. He takes one from the top of a, what seems like a random stack, patters himself and the rolling chair back over to the desk, and licks his thumb to open the cover of the folder.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha yearns for that baseball bat.<br/>
<br/>
“Black motorcycle, folded in half, probably illegally souped up,” Agatha impatiently helps him refresh his memory, side eyeing Rio at the last assumption, but feeling her lips curl into a faint smirk as Rio’s cheeks turn just a shade darker.<br/>
<br/>
“Ah!” Mustache exclaims in recognition, slamming the folder closed. “Curly Fry.”<br/>
<br/>
“Eh— what?” Rio stammers as the police officer gets up from his chair.<br/>
<br/>
“Curly Fry. That’s what the team has started to call it, ever since they brought it in,” he chuckles, walking around the desk to meet the ladies in the front. “You know, because the bike had completely wrapped itself around a— oh. I’m sorry.”<br/>
<br/>
Mustache registers Rio’s increasingly exasperated expression before he can finish his sentence. “My condolences,” he says instead, with a hand on his heart. It almost could’ve come across as genuine, if not for the amused smile on his half hidden lips.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha is exactly two seconds away from ripping his mustache clean off his upper lip when he steps away; “Follow me to the backlot, ladies.” </p><p>The two women trail after him, back outside to the parking lot and around the building; Rio still reeling and a little wobbly, Agatha on her guard for once in her life.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Mustache opens the electric roller door to a separate warehouse behind the station, the unmistakable wreck of a motorcycle comes into view. </p><p>And for how disrespectful Mustache –and the team– had been, there was some truth behind the nickname: the two wheels of the bike are almost touching each other. There is nothing left of the leather seat; the handles are angled in two different directions, the exhaust aims to the sky. The mounts of the mirrors are intact, but the mirrors themselves are missing— they probably shattered on the spot. Just like Rio’s leg.<br/>
<br/>
Without warning, Agatha almost doubles over as she feels a suckerpunch to the gut. She knows there’s nothing there— but her imagination springs to life and shows her Rio, on top of that wrecked bike, getting launched through the air. And worse; it shows her how Rio smashes into a tree at full force, how her spine snaps against a lamppost, how she lands on the asphalt and a truck drives over her.<br/>
<br/>
If <em>this</em> is the state of her bike, how the hell did she get away with just a broken leg?<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s airway tightens and her arm flies out to touch Rio, to check herself back in with reality; the reality that Rio is alive, and recovering, and in way better condition than she should’ve been.<br/>
<br/>
But before she reaches the woman next to her, she hears a gut wrenching sob. Her head snaps to the side and she watches Rio, indeed alive and standing, but lost in absolute devastation.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha can tell Rio is trying to fight the tears with everything she has, but she sniffles and hiccups, and the hand with which she leans on her cane starts shaking.<br/>
<br/>
The moment Rio breaks, so does Agatha’s heart. </p><p>“Oh Rio, honey…”<br/>
<br/>
Rio's chest heaves, her shoulders shake, her lip quivers, and as soon as a large tear escapes over the waterline of her left eye, she angrily swipes it away.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha takes a shuffled step toward her; but what does she do? Does she hug her? Does she squeeze her arm? Pat her on the back?<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll leave you alone for a minute,” Mustache says after loudly clearing his throat. Probably the smartest thing he’s said so far, Agatha thinks.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he walks away, Agatha reaches out to Rio again, whose gaze is still fixed on what once was her motorcycle.<br/>
<br/>
“Rio…” is the only thing Agatha knows how to say, and her fingers awkwardly wrap around the other woman’s bicep.<br/>
<br/>
“Leave me alone,” Rio spits, shaking Agatha’s arm away using so much force her good leg falters.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh— okay,” Agatha croaks, giving her a curt nod in understanding. But as she steps away and looks at the vulnerable human in front of her, she decides: “No.”<br/>
<br/>
Once more, she steps in, positioning herself behind Rio to put her hands on both of her arms, soothingly rubbing up and down.<br/>
<br/>
“I said, go <em> away." </em><br/>
<br/>
This time, there’s more venom in her tone. It spooks Agatha; she withdraws her hands as if Rio’s skin has burned them.<br/>
<br/>
“Rio, let me—”<br/>
<br/>
<em> "No.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Rio turns around to stare her down. Agatha has never considered herself to be an empath up until this point, but the amount of pure hurt in Rio’s eyes almost makes her tear up herself.<br/>
<br/>
“Leave. Me. Alone,” Rio sneers one last time.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha throws her hands up in defeat and staggers back, but before her foot lands behind her, Rio grabs the lapels of her jacket and pulls her in. She wraps her arms around Agatha’s waist as soon as their bodies collide, the cane clatters to the floor, and she buries her face against Agatha’s clavicle.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Oh, honey, </em> Agatha wants to say again, but she manages to put a break on her vocal chords before the words leave her mouth. Instead, she takes a deep breath and wraps herself around the sobbing woman in her arms, one hand on her back, and one in her hair.<br/>
<br/>
And while she didn’t know how to handle the situation mere seconds earlier, the soothing strokes her fingers make now come natural to her, just like how she keeps whispering the words “<em>i</em><em>t’s okay,” </em> and <em> “there you go," “let it out,” </em> over and over in her ear.<br/>
<br/>
During that moment, it’s enough to know that she might be exactly what Rio needs.<br/>
<br/>
It isn’t until much, much later that she’ll realize: more than one heart got broken and healed that day. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I feel stupid,” Rio sniffles twenty minutes later, perched on a plastic chair in the warehouse, a paper cup of water in her hand. Agatha sits by her on the floor, tracing soothing circles over the other woman’s knee.<br/>
<br/>
“You don’t have to,” Agatha says, because she doesn’t know what else to say.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s not even about that stupid bike,” Rio continues, ignoring Agatha. “It’s about… it’s about what it stands for, you know.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha stills her hand, frowns. “Hey. Don’t speak ill of the dead. She’s right there.” Her head tilts toward Victoria’s remains. It earns her a watery smile from Rio.<br/>
<br/>
“Care to elaborate?” Agatha then asks, not wanting to leave her hanging.<br/>
<br/>
Rio takes a breath and another sip from her water. “I’ve always valued my freedom as my most prized possession,” she says softly, her eyes briefly flicking to the motorcycle, and back to her cup.<br/>
<br/>
“I grew up in foster care, in a group home— which isn’t in theory, <em>or practice</em>, a whole lot different from a prison,” she continues, and Agatha decides to save the question of why she knows that for later.<br/>
“I value my freedom so much, because I know what it’s like not to have it. When I aged out of the system, getting my license and saving up for a bike was the first thing I did.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha nods; that makes sense. She’s heard stories of the foster system before. And while her own mother wasn’t exactly a walk in the park, she knows with a bit of bad luck, she would’ve been worse off in a group home.<br/>
<br/>
“Victoria’s been with me ever since. Losing her feels like… losing my freedom,” Rio admits, mindlessly plucking the rim of the paper cup. Then she lifts her head, inhaling deeply to start defending herself: “And I know, <em> I know, </em> this doesn’t mean I’ve actually lost it. But it’s—”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s about control,” Agatha finishes for her. “If things don’t happen on your terms, it makes you feel powerless.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio stares at her in surprise, nodding after a few seconds. “Yeah. Because if I’m the one in control, I have someone to blame when things go wrong. And I <em> need </em> that. So if control slips through my fingers, I lose myself. I think it could drive me insane.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha studies Rio’s face as she talks, registering the tiny twitches in her muscles gauging whether Agatha can follow her or not. Sadly enough, she can.<br/>
<br/>
“Does not being in control feel like drowning?” Agatha asks her, and it’s a shot in the dark, but driven by instinct.<br/>
<br/>
“I think— Yeah? It does?” Rio tilts her head as she mulls it over.<br/>
<br/>
“You make it sound like a question,” Agatha chuckles.<br/>
<br/>
“Because I’m surprised by the comparison.”<br/>
<br/>
It’s Agatha’s turn to look away, and she shrugs. “It feels like drowning <em> to me.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> And that’s everything.<br/>
<br/>
In those few words lies all understanding between them.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody answers the question <em> ‘how would you like to die?’ </em> with ‘<em>drowning seems like a pretty chill option’.<br/>
</em> Nobody wants to drown. Losing the ability to breathe, while simultaneously being taken over by something else, something filling up your every crevice until it’s claimed you, wiped you away— of course it makes a person panic, flail, trash.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s eyes lock onto Rio’s again. The ever present unfamiliar scripture in her eyes has turned into English, so she begins to read.<br/>
<br/>
Of course; the instinct that keeps someone from drowning is to hold onto something. Of course Rio chooses to ride a motorcycle, even if it’s dangerous— because it’s <em> her choice. </em> Of course Rio rarely opens up about herself, because it’s <em> on her terms. </em> Of course Rio is a Domme, and often a top in a relationship, because it’s <em> her responsibility. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> And of course, the only time she’d given that up, back in that hotel room in New York, it had freaked her out in the end… because she had handed it all to Agatha. That had been—<br/>
<br/>
“— <em> so fucking brave,” </em>Agatha whispers, her chest filled with an overwhelming sense of pride, and something else. It’s like a power cable between them, which had only sent sparks back and forth before, has now connected properly and lets the electricity coil freely. A nuclear reactor blasting a core particle through a never ending loop, flowing through both of them. </p><p>And while their newfound mutual understanding is apparently so powerful it can split atoms, that understanding comes with a few realizations.<br/>
<br/>
“Shit,” says Rio, and she swallows.<br/>
<br/>
A silence.<br/>
<br/>
“Shit,” Agatha agrees. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It takes no less than a whole week after Rio has left Agatha’s home and care for Agatha to drive herself up and down and through the fucking walls, because she is actually very adept at handling her feelings, thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
To show both of them exactly how very adept at handling her feelings she is, she finds herself beeping the horn of her car in front of Rio’s house, completely unannounced after a week of no-contact.<br/>
<br/>
Lucky for her and Rio’s neighbors, Rio shows up in the doorway after Agatha honks her third rendition of <em> row-row-row your boat. </em><br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s wrist drops from the wheel at the sight; Rio looks <em> good. </em>She leans on her cane with both hands, but her posture is confident, her balance seems better, and there’s an amused expression hidden under her unimpressed lifted eyebrow. </p><p>Rolling the electric window down, Agatha can’t help but smirk. “Get in, Hopscotch!” she shouts with her head out the window, slamming the outside of the door for theatrical effect.<br/>
<br/>
“Why?” Rio shouts back.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m buying you a car!” <em> Duh, </em> she almost adds.<br/>
<br/>
“What?!” Rio loses her demeanor and laughs incredulously.<br/>
<br/>
“You heard me!”<br/>
<br/>
“No fucking way, Agatha!”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha sighs, rolls her eyes, and brings out the big guns by pointing to the trunk. “Psycho wants to say hi!”<br/>
<br/>
Rio beams. “Give me ten minutes!”<br/>
<br/>
“You’ll get seven!”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even before Agatha has turned into a parking spot (or spots, plural, as the divider runs straight through the middle of the car), Rio starts spluttering in protest.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Electro Vehicles and Service</em>? Agatha, no— they only sell EVs here, that’s way too expensive.”<br/>
<br/>
“Shush,” Agatha simply says as she undoes her seatbelt, snapping her hand at Rio to shut her up. She turns the engine off and gets out of the car, opening the trunk to let Psycho out. “C’mere, boy!”<br/>
<br/>
Psycho jumps out of the car, panting excitedly, and obediently lets Agatha click the metal ring of his leash to his collar. By the time he's all ready to go, Rio has walked around the car.<br/>
<br/>
“Is that my best buddy?!” Rio calls out, finally able to pet him after the drive over. Psycho’s ears perk up and he sprints toward her, tugging on the leash and Agatha’s shoulder in the process. He seemingly reminds himself about Rio’s injury before he jumps up, so makes himself sit, shaking in anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s okay bud, come here,” Rio tells him, patting her hip on the uninjured side. She props her cane up against the car and Psycho jumps up against her, whining in his enthusiasm. Rio gently takes him by his fluffy ears and rubs his face between her hands, planting soft kisses between his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha was never, is not, and shall not ever be jealous of her own fucking dog.<br/>
<br/>
“You look well,” she clumsily blurts out, and nods at Rio’s leg. “Seems like you’re improving.”<br/>
<br/>
“Getting stronger every day,” Rio replies with a smile, and drops another kiss on Psycho’s forehead.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha recalls her dog with a snap of her fingers, rewarding him with a biscuit from her pocket when he heels beside her.<br/>
<br/>
“Ladies! What a surprise to see two beautiful women here on such a beautiful day! My name is Maxwell, and I may call you…?”<br/>
<br/>
The women in question turn around and watch a typical slimy car salesperson heading their way; light blue shirt, dark blue tie, and way too much gel in his short hair. Psycho barks twice; Agatha silences him with a stern look.<br/>
<br/>
“...Uninterested in this whole spiel,” Agatha answers him, vaguely gesturing in his direction. As he approaches them, he is followed by a cloud of strong male perfume, causing Rio to scrunch her nose in disgust. Somehow, that gives Agatha a satisfied feeling in her chest.<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t worry ma’am, I <em> completely </em> understand.” Maxwell claps his hands together and bows his head in fake humbleness. “But you <em> are </em> interested in a test drive, I presume? I haven’t told any other clients today, but I want to reward your honesty with an offer: we actually have the newest BMW on presale— not officially out yet, but if you’d kindly follow me, I can—”<br/>
<br/>
“No,” Agatha simply says, cutting him off by holding up her finger in front of his face. “I’d like a test drive in…” She cranes her neck to look at the neatly lined up cars behind the window. Her eyes land on a white Range Rover, and selects it because she likes the color. “...that one.”<br/>
<br/>
“Excellent choice, ma’am,” Maxwell praises her. “Though if you are interested in the Velar P400 series, might I suggest to take a look at—”<br/>
<br/>
“Am I speaking Korean, or did your hair gel leak down and clog up your ears?” <br/>
<br/>
Maxwell’s jaw keeps hanging open mid-sentence, and Agatha vaguely hears a muffled sound escaping from Rio’s throat.<br/>
<br/>
“Understood.” He bows his head again, and makes eye contact with Psycho in the process. He smiles and reaches out to him: “Oh hey there! Who’s a good little doggy?!”<br/>
<br/>
But Psycho is having none of it; he bears his teeth at Maxwell, who quickly retreats his hand.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha wants to make a comment, but Rio is faster: “So sorry about that. Our dog hasn’t had his lunch yet.”<br/>
<br/>
Maxwell’s face twitches in discomfort and he takes a step back. “I will return shortly with the keys.”<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he turns around, Agatha looks at Rio and mouths: <em>Our dog?! </em><br/>
<br/>
Rio shrugs a shoulder. “If you want him to stop flirting, we might as well pretend we’re lesbians in a relationship,” she says under her breath.<br/>
<br/>
Well, for a lesbian who is <em> absolutely not </em>in a relationship, Agatha muses, she has a fascinatingly strong urge to kiss her on the mouth.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>A good ten minutes later they’re fastening their seatbelts in the Range Rover; Agatha on the passenger’s seat, Rio behind the wheel, and Psycho in the trunk after being told explicitly the dog wasn’t allowed to go with them for the test drive.<br/>
<br/>
Rio, with her fingers brushing against the on button of the car, tries really hard –to her credit– not to look miserable in the huge vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
“What is it?” Agatha asks, opening the glove box to check for freebies. “If you don’t like the color, I’d question your taste, but I’m sure we could—”<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha, no,” Rio sighs, slumping down in the seat. “You know this is too much. This is absolutely crazy.”<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t wanna hear it,” Agatha says, and pushes the on button for her. The media screen on the dashboard flashes: <em> Hold down brake to start. </em><br/>
<br/>
“You heard him, hold down brake to start,” she reads out loud, tapping the screen and raising an expecting eyebrow. As Rio reluctantly complies and the electric engine starts running, Agatha lets out a sympathetic huff.<br/>
<br/>
“After what you’ve told me, I figured you deserve someone treating you for once in your life. Plus, with Victoria gone—”<br/>
<br/>
“You could buy me a donut if you wanted to treat me. Or a keychain, or pretty kitchen towels or something…” Rio trails off. “And Victoria is my responsibility. Not yours.”<br/>
<br/>
“First of all, if I want to treat you, that’s my choice,” Agatha starts listing off, raising her forefinger. “Secondly, you owning a car benefits the both of us, since you won’t fly off and break a bone, and I won’t have to worry that you do.” She raises her thumb too.<br/>
<br/>
“Thirdly…” She adds a third finger for the sake of clarity, and then taps her purse with that hand. “Mama Harkness is paying.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio snickers. “So generous of your mother.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yep, that’s good old Evanora. Bless her soul,” Agatha says sincerely, draping her hand over her heart. </p><p>“You’re going to hell,” Rio laughs and shakes her head, but does look down at the console to try and figure out how to put the car in drive.<br/>
<br/>
“Does it have to be an electric car though?” she asks after staring at the smooth leather in between the two seats, completely void of any buttons or levers. “I already told you, I’m a real driver. I prefer driving stick.”<br/>
<br/>
While Agatha does believe that, and just manages to hide a hot flash at the image of Rio smoothly shifting gears in an older car, she shakes her head.<br/>
<br/>
“EV’s are so easy to drive. Safer, too. And better for the environment.”<br/>
<br/>
“Easy? I have been staring at the console for an hour and I haven’t even located the hand brake yet!”<br/>
<br/>
“That sounds like a lack of insight on your part,” Agatha says smugly and taps the <em>controls-</em>button on the screen. A digital turning dial appears, and right next to it a red button saying <em>Hand Brake </em>in large white letters.<br/>
<br/>
“This is ridiculous,” Rio murmurs, and taps the <em>D </em>for <em>Drive </em>against her will.<br/>
<br/>
She smoothly drives the car off the parking lot, a continuous string of complaints about ‘<em>a goddamn toy car’ </em>and <em>‘don’t know what real driving skill is’ </em>leaving her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Next to her, Agatha crosses her arms with an amused smile on her face, quite enjoying Rio’s muttering about her 60k present.<br/>
<br/>
“If any random child can operate this bumper car, where is the fun in driving it?” Rio questions out loud, activating her turn signal before taking a right to drive the car up a hill.<br/>
<br/>
“You gotta pick a standpoint, sweetheart,” Agatha says, a challenging tone in her voice. “Which one is it? Is buying you a car <em>‘too much’</em>? Or is the car not up to your standards? It can’t be both.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I just paid for my <em>own car</em>—”<br/>
<br/>
“With what money?”<br/>
<br/>
“Insurance money.”<br/>
<br/>
“And buy a 1995 Subaru?” Agatha cackles as Rio grumpily presses down the gas to make it all the way up the hill. Then she drives the car over a bridge, and follows the road back downhill. “And pick you up from the garage every time it needs mainten—? <em>Rio!” </em><em><br/>
</em><em><br/>
</em>The car picks up speed by itself from rolling down the hill, and from the corner of her eyes, she sees Rio’s left thigh lift up as her muscle memory makes her go for the clutch— which doesn’t exist in this car, so she forcefully pumps down on the brake instead, activating the ABS and warning lights, bringing the car to a screeching halt and throwing their bodies forward so violently that Rio’s head hits the center of the wheel and makes the horn go off for a solid seven seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Then it’s dead silent in the car.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s fingers dig into the seat, and her eyes flick to the rearview mirror to check whether there’s a car behind them— but they seem to be alone on the road. Psycho’s ears pop up from behind the headrests; he curiously looks out the back window, and seems fine too.<br/>
<br/>
With her heart beating in her throat, she slowly turns her head to gauge if Rio is okay. While taking the other woman in, an involuntary puff of air leaves her mouth; Rio is still holding onto the wheel, her nose close to the horn and her face half covered by her own hair. Her eyes are wide, and she carries the most disastrous, profoundly embarrassed expression on her face. <br/>
<br/>
Rio’s slowly, <em>slowly </em>shifts her gaze from the road to Agatha— and the moment their eyes meet, Agatha loses it.<br/>
<br/>
She starts cackling, <em>howling, </em>gasping for air in between screeches. She tears her eyes away from Rio’s increasingly offended face to be able to calm down and breathe, but every time she looks back at her, she breaks. She snorts until she cries and grabs onto the door handle for dear life, and eventually has to unbuckle her seatbelt to throw the door open and jump out, fanning herself with fresh air as her bladder starts to cramp. </p><p>“You done?” Rio’s monotone, grumpy voice sounds from inside the car, causing Agatha to roll straight into another fit of laughter. She doubles over and waves her hand in front of her throat, as if to say <em> cut it. </em><br/>
<br/>
“Stop!” She snorts again, <em> “I have to pee!” </em> and crosses her legs for emphasis.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh do you?” Rio huffs, unimpressed.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, Agatha is worried Rio might actually be upset –-or worse, injured again—, but when she gets back into the car and refastens her seatbelt after a few deep breaths, she notices the tiniest wrinkle by Rio’s lips. Just a miniscule twitch in her facial muscles while she stoically stares out through the front window, waiting for Agatha to be finished.<br/>
<br/>
“Whew, that was… the funniest shit I’ve ever seen,” Agatha challenges her now in a much calmer tone, but still wiping the tears from her eyes. Rio pretends not to hear it as she taps a few buttons on the screen, trying to turn off the warning lights.<br/>
<br/>
“You enjoy yourself?” Rio asks her as soon as she gets the car moving again.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, very much so,” Agatha replies, another stray bubble of laughter leaving her throat. “Fuck, stop making me laugh. I <em> will </em> pee my pants.”<br/>
<br/>
“Not exactly how I was hoping to make you wet,” Rio says softly, almost inaudibly so. But Agatha catches it anyway, and she whips her head to the left.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh?”<br/>
<br/>
“You heard me,” Rio says, casually chewing her bottom lip.<br/>
<br/>
“I did, but I’d like you to elaborate,” Agatha drawls, shifting in her seat to get more comfortable. She places her elbow on the door handle, her chin against her hand, and stares at Rio with a wide smile on her face.<br/>
<br/>
“I would, if you hadn’t laughed at me so hard you had to <em> exit the fucking car.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Oh come on! That was funny as hell! Your <em> face </em> honked the car, that shit’s fucking hilarious—”<br/>
<br/>
“I dare you to keep talking, Agatha.”<br/>
<br/>
“—especially after your monologue about not needing any skill to drive this <em> ‘toy car’ </em> —”<br/>
<br/>
“Please go on, see what happens.”<br/>
<br/>
“—I swear I couldn’t make this up if I tried, this one’s going to haunt you for a while—”<br/>
<br/>
“So you’re choosing to be a brat?”<br/>
<br/>
“—goddamn, every time I replay it in my head, I’m a <em> goner—” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Fuck, Agatha, I <em> really </em> want to put you in your place right now.”<br/>
<br/>
“— <em> beeped the horn with your face! </em> Welcome to automatic driving, Rio, where there’s no—”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m pulling over.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh are you?” </p><p>Agatha cackles again. It isn’t until Rio actually turns on the warning lights again and steers the car to the side of the road, that Rio’s words slowly register in her mind. <em> Wait— brat? Put you in your place? </em><br/>
<br/>
As Rio brings the car to a stop –a gentle one this time–, Agatha realizes how heavy the other woman’s breathing is. Rio’s nostrils are flared; she rakes a nervous hand through her hair.<br/>
<br/>
“So,” she says definitively, activating the hand brake and unbuckling her seatbelt to be able to turn her body to Agatha. The look on Rio’s face brings shivers down her spine. Her jaw has tightened and she somehow looks more… authoritative than Agatha has ever seen her. When did that happen?<br/>
<br/>
“You sure you want to rile me up like that?”<br/>
<br/>
“Um,” Agatha stammers, swallows any retorts away. Her laughing fit is over, but Rio’s heaving chest is making her feel something more inappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
“Because if you’re behaving like a <em> brat, </em> Agatha,” Rio speaks slowly and licks her lips, “you’re making this really hard for me.”<br/>
<br/>
<em> Oh. Oh shit. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Rio isn’t agitated. She’s horny out of her fucking mind.<br/>
<br/>
Ready to pounce.<br/>
<br/>
Waiting for her cue.<br/>
<br/>
“Making what hard, exactly?” Agatha asks in her most innocent voice. Though this is unknown territory for her, excitement and curiosity win big time.<br/>
<br/>
Rio doesn’t waste a second and scoots forward, lifting her hand to cup Agatha’s cheek. A loving gesture, at first— until the hand slides further back and twists itself in a few strands of hair at the base of Agatha’s skull. Her grip is tight, bordering on painful, and Agatha has to tilt her head back slightly to make it less uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
During one fleeting moment, she feels the instinct to lash out, to yell, to cuss Rio out, to tear the whole car apart. But then her outward focus gets sucked in, funneled into the hand in her hair, making everything else fall away. </p><p>It’s the only sensation left.<br/>
<br/>
It’s overwhelming, it knocks the breath from her lungs. </p><p>And it’s not enough.<br/>
<br/>
“Hard to not want to take you down a few pegs,” Rio calmly says.<br/>
<br/>
Who the fuck is this woman?<br/>
<br/>
<em> And how can she lure her out? </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “You would’ve certainly been able to if you’d launched me through the windshield earlier,” Agatha chuckles dryly, her voice strained from her head being tilted back.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s grip tightens, making Agatha gasp softly.<br/>
<br/>
She has her pride, sure, but the desire to see more of this side of Rio is a wildfire that burns any other thoughts or feelings to ash.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m warning you, Agatha Harkness,” Rio says, making sure to articulate every syllable. Agatha feels Rio’s other hand land on her thigh, give her a meaningful squeeze. “Do. Not. Test. My patience.”<br/>
<br/>
“Or what? <em> Rio Vidal? </em> ”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s eyes narrow, she lets out a pained groan. “Fuck.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hmm?” Agatha goads her, but almost immediately regrets it when the hand on her thigh travels upward, slowly passing over her hips, her stomach, her breasts. A warm palm lands on her chest, applying almost no pressure.<br/>
<br/>
Rio leans in. Agatha can feel her breath on her lips, and shivers. The hand in her hair tightens once more.<br/>
<br/>
“Do I have your permission to try?” Rio whispers against her mouth, and Agatha gets hot, <em> hot, hot— </em> her face is on fire and the car has to be seconds from going up in flames.<br/>
<br/>
“To try what?” Agatha counters; not because she wants to provoke her, but because she needs to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
“To dominate you,” is Rio’s gravelly answer. “If this isn’t going to work between us, I at least want to have tried. And right now… you’re being so— <em> deliciously difficult. </em>”</p><p><br/>
Agatha wouldn’t admit it at gunpoint, but if she had known Rio would be like <em> this </em>as a Domme, she would’ve given in earlier. Way earlier. </p><p>“You keep calling me bratty, and difficult,” Agatha says, straining to swallow again. “Those aren’t very nice things to say to someone who’s buying you a car.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio exhales heavily as the hand on Agatha’s chest moves up to threateningly press against her throat. Agatha feels her squeeze the sides of her neck, and realizes her head is fully trapped between Rio’s hands.<br/>
<br/>
A weak position, she knows. Rio has all the power here. The power to control her, and the power to seriously harm her.<br/>
<br/>
But Rio wouldn’t. She knows that too.<br/>
<br/>
For all the times she’d called Rio an incapable Domme before, she isn’t sure she’s actually believed her own words even once.<br/>
<br/>
And now, with her own life almost literally in Rio’s hands, she can feel the truth –or maybe it’s adrenaline– searing through her veins.<br/>
<br/>
If she’d let someone break her, it’s Rio. But if she’d let someone build her up, it’s Rio too.<br/>
<br/>
“Take me to your house one last time.” Rio’s desire is palpable in the air, visible in her heavy lidded eyes with which she looks down upon the shaking woman in her hands.<br/>
<br/>
“What are you gonna do to me?” Terrified. Curious. Exhilarated. Agatha almost doesn’t recognize her own pitchy voice.</p><p>Parting her lips, Rio dips her head so she can take Agatha’s bottom lip between her teeth. She gives it a playful nibble, nowhere near an actual bite— a clear contrast with the strong hand in Agatha’s hair, still tugging on her scalp.<br/>
<br/>
“Everything I want.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha loses the ability to control the muscles in her chest and throat any longer, and lets out a shaky, needy whine. She startles herself, but doesn’t get the opportunity to get self conscious about it when Rio growls at the sound. “Fuck.” <br/>
<br/>
Rio pulls her in by the hair and crashes their lips together, panting into Agatha’s open mouth. Agatha’s vision starts to blur and she gives in, letting herself be guided by demanding hands, lips, and a deprived tongue.<br/>
<br/>
She’d always believed <em> ‘melting in someone’s hands’ </em>is just a turn of phrase, so why are her bones and muscles actively turning into liquid under Rio’s touch?</p><p>A high pitched whine sounds from the trunk. The two women break apart, tearing their eyes away from each other to look to the back of the car, where Psycho is intently staring at them, his head tilted to the side. One of his ears is folded, and the moment he realizes he’s being perceived, he starts whining excitedly.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, Rio. Yes, my house,” Agatha whispers hastily, chuckling at the interruption. At the realization that they’re in a car that’s not theirs, she awkwardly asks: “So… am I buying this one for you?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio drops her gaze, releases her grip on Agatha, and runs the back of her hand over her own mouth, sniffing as she shuffles in her seat.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re going to have to.”<br/>
<br/>
“Why?”<br/>
<br/>
A mischievous smirk appears on Rio’s face while she fastens her own seatbelt again, averting Agatha’s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“You ruined the passenger’s seat.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s mouth drops open as Rio starts the car, ready to defend herself, but she knows it’s futile. She huffs, and wriggles uncomfortably in her seat while Rio drives the car back onto the main road.<br/>
<br/>
“Something wrong?” Rio asks, keeping her eyes fixed on the road.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah,” Agatha says defiantly, “your assumption about what’s going on in my pants.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh?” Rio checks the side mirror before making a turn, and looks down at Agatha’s thighs before looking straight ahead. “Do you know what I <em> do </em> like about an automatic car?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha presses her lips together. “Hmm?”<br/>
<br/>
With a self satisfied smile, Rio reaches over to place her hand on Agatha’s thigh. “If I’m not using my right hand to shift gears, I can use it to check whether you’re lying.”<br/>
<br/>
The hand draws closer to the inside of Agatha’s thigh, to where she feels herself starting to pulse.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m not lying,” Agatha lies. Spurred on by the need to keep Rio on edge, she continues: “I’m so dry. The driest. I don’t think I’ve ever been drier in my life.”<br/>
<br/>
“Open that button for me,” Rio demands with a nod to the waistband of her slacks. Agatha’s heartbeat picks up. She doesn’t even think before complying, her expectant gaze fixed on Rio, whose jawline looks a lot tenser than usual.<br/>
<br/>
“Now put your hand inside, and tell me what you feel.”<br/>
<br/>
She really shouldn’t— this car <em> isn’t theirs. </em><br/>
<br/>
Naturally, she does.<br/>
<br/>
As two of her fingers slide through the generous wetness of her pussy, she lets out an involuntary moan. “<em>So dry,” </em> she mumbles with a lazy smile on her face.<br/>
<br/>
She feels Rio’s hand give her thigh a warning squeeze. “If I slide my hand in and it turns out you’re lying, you’re in trouble.”<br/>
<br/>
“Mmhm. Get in line,” Agatha says, drawing slow circles around her clit. If Rio wants to try and dominate her, she isn’t going to make it easy for her. Not because she likes being a bitch, or maybe because she likes being a bitch a little bit, but mostly because she needs Rio to keep proving she can take the responsibility. And if that makes her bratty— then so be it.</p><p>For a minute, Agatha assumes Rio has given up already, and she tries to keep her disappointment locked away in the back of her mind. But after Rio has turned onto a long, straight road, her hand flies to Agatha’s waistband and she shoves it right into her pants, joining Agatha’s own hand.<br/>
<br/>
The moment Agatha feels Rio’s scrutinizing fingers against her wrist, following the path down to her leaking cunt, Agatha groans and closes her eyes. Two pairs of fingers are now gathering wetness near her entrance.<br/>
<br/>
“Feels like you’re going to have a problem,” Rio concludes calmly, while her fingers are fighting Agatha’s for access to her clit.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh yeah?” Agatha laughs. “Feels like I’m having the exact opposite of a problem right now.”<br/>
<br/>
With an audible exhale she gives in, withdrawing her own hand to let Rio pleasure her as she squirms on the seat. She’s not teasing, not drawing anything out; the way she works Agatha up to an orgasm feels deliciously purposeful.<br/>
<br/>
Feeling more and more comfortable the longer it goes on, Agatha moans loudly. Her jaw drops open and her face scrunches in ecstasy— quickly losing all concern about other people on the road who might be able to see the driver’s right hand shoved down her pants.<br/>
<br/>
And <em> oh, </em> it’s been a while, so she lets herself happily get worked up.<br/>
<br/>
“God, your fingers… so good,” she breathes, losing herself to the sensation. And before she knows it—<br/>
<br/>
“Oh fuck, I’m gonna come already, <em> fuck, </em> don’t stop, don’t stop—”<br/>
<br/>
And Rio stops. She withdraws her hand, making Agatha’s eyes fly open, and she just catches the sight of Rio casually sucking her own fingers clean before placing her hand back on the wheel. She almost could’ve looked innocent, if not for the flush on her cheeks.<br/>
<br/>
<em> “Don’t </em> do this to me,” Agatha snarls, not happy about being edged so close to her orgasm. She’s about to demand that Rio puts her hand back where it was a few seconds ago, but realizes that would just turn into an endless discussion. Instead, she snatches Rio’s wrist off the wheel and shoves her back into her underwear.<br/>
<br/>
Rio draws one circle around her clit, chuckling evilly, and Agatha will fight anyone who’ll imply that that’s turning her on even more.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m gonna give you a choice,” Rio says, as soon as Agatha has stopped groaning. “You can have your orgasm now, but you won’t come for a long, <em> long </em> time after that.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha has stopped listening after the first half of that sentence; the rest will be a problem for future Agatha. Present Agatha wants what she <em> wants. </em><br/>
<br/>
“Now,” she manages, bucking her hips up to get more friction from Rio’s fingers.<br/>
<br/>
“You don’t wanna hear the second option?” Rio asks, her tone highly amused.<br/>
<br/>
“I said, <em> now!” </em><br/>
<br/>
Rio looks to the side, grinning at the desperate woman on the passenger’s seat. “Whatever you want, m’lady.”<br/>
<br/>
The second Rio’s fingers resume their ministrations, Agatha lets out a long, relieved sigh.<br/>
<br/>
<em> “Yes!” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Yeah, you like that?”<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Mmh. Fuck. Yes! Oh— oh!”  </em></p><p>“You sound delicious. You’re gonna come for me like this?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, I’m gonna… <em> oh fuck, Rio… </em> Yes, I’m gonna—”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s hips violently buck up as the burning sensation between her legs reaches its peak, and spreads out throughout her entire body. She gasps for air, <em> loudly</em>, only to breathe out on a long, groaning exhale.<br/>
<br/>
As her muscles start to relax and her eyes blink open, she looks at the road ahead and makes a decision.<br/>
<br/>
“Take a right on the next intersection,” she orders, still out of breath.<br/>
<br/>
Rio looks up, confused. “The car dealer is to the left here?”<br/>
<br/>
“I fucking know,” Agatha says, pulling Rio’s wrist from her pants and bringing her fingers up to her own lips this time. She laps herself off of Rio’s fingers as she says: “You’re taking us to mine. This is your car now.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio makes a surprised sound, somewhere between a chuckle and a gasp. “Agatha, we left <em> your </em> car at the dealer.”<br/>
<br/>
“We’ll pick it up later.”<br/>
<br/>
“That guy asked for your ID in exchange for the keys!”<br/>
<br/>
“You didn’t think I gave him a real one, did you? Come on, Rio. How well do you know me?”<br/>
<br/>
“Not well enough, apparently,” Rio murmurs, still half in shock. She turns her head to Agatha again, her face burning hot at the sight of the other woman cleaning her fingers with her tongue.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re about to get to know me a whole lot better,” Agatha says with a wink, and Rio, turned on beyond belief, does take a right on the next intersection. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Parking the new, kind of stolen car in front of Agatha’s house, Rio seems to have dropped into a more distant demeanor. It’s slightly concerning to Agatha, but she doesn’t know how to ask about it, or if she even should.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, Rio relieves her from her thoughts when she kills the engine, turns to Agatha, and says: “If you <em> really </em> want to do this, I want you to go up to your bedroom and wait for me. This is not the time to be a brat— this is a way out.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha can feel the tension behind those words, the sincerity. Rio is basically warning her that lashing out now counts as safewording.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn’t confirm Rio’s demand yet, but instead looks in her eyes to be able to see what she needs to see: conviction. Dominance. Responsibility. And a profound desire to make each other feel good.<br/>
<br/>
Because as much as Agatha has always enjoyed being a Domme, there has always been curiosity. Of course there has, because <em> as </em> a Domme, she knows how much pleasure there can be in subbing.<br/>
Nobody has ever gotten her close to admitting that. But Rio, the way she reads and plays Agatha’s body… Like the last time they had sex (<em>D</em><em>id they have sex? Was it playing? Or both?);</em> she had managed to turn Agatha’s mind off, turn her body into an obeying vessel for Rio’s desires— and ultimately, Agatha’s own.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, they had tried to break things off between them multiple times. If this was really their last attempt at connection, and it wouldn’t work— there’s nothing to lose, right?<br/>
<br/>
Only her ego. Only her confidence. Only the trust in another human being to treat her with respect, to not make fun of her, to be patient… <em> Wait. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Will you make fun of me?” She <em> needs </em> to know, and half-and-half expects Rio to make a joke about that, but she’s met with a genuine smile.<br/>
<br/>
“Not if you don’t want to. You know how it works.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha gives her a short, compliant nod. “And... can I not be a brat… <em> at all?” </em><br/>
<br/>
“We’ll go over this in a minute,” Rio says. “If I find you in your bedroom, I’ll know it’s a go.”<br/>
<br/>
“Okay.” Agatha has the strange urge to kiss her before leaving the car, but she decides against it, and steps out. She helps Psycho down from the trunk, and wordlessly walks inside with him, leaving Rio behind and the front door unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing she does is walk to the kitchen to gulp down a large bottle of water from the fridge. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, and distractedly fills Psycho’s bowls with water and food.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you gonna stay down here, and be a good boy?” Agatha asks him as he dives in.<br/>
<br/>
His ears twitch as he devours his meal, but he doesn’t respond otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
“Me too, buddy,” she murmurs, and turns around after giving him an affirming scratch on his back.<br/>
<br/>
Every step up the stairs makes her body feel heavier and hotter, and when she’s finally reached her bedroom, she realizes she doesn’t know what to do with herself now.<br/>
<br/>
Does she take off her clothes? Does she sit down on the bed? She sure as fuck isn’t gonna <em> kneel.  </em></p><p>Eventually, she decides to keep on her clothes, but to sit down on the soft comforter while waiting for Rio’s arrival.<br/>
<br/>
She looks down at herself; the button of her slacks is still open, which looks weird, so she closes it again. Her shirt is wrinkled in an unflattering way from the way she is sitting, so she takes it out of her slacks and pulls it down to straighten it out.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately she decides she doesn't like it, and tucks the shirt back into her slacks, but she doesn’t like the way it opens at the cleavage; one side falls open and the other one doesn’t. To solve that problem, she buttons up all the way to her neck.<br/>
<br/>
<em> What is she, a nun? </em> Even before her fingers have closed the last button, she’s changed her mind again, and she loosens the top three buttons to make the shirt fall all the way open. But that exposes her bra, and—<br/>
<br/>
“I like it like that. Leave it.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha looks up, and her throat almost closes up at the sight. Rio leans against the doorway, still wearing her jeans, tshirt, and blazer, cane loosely in hand, hair clipped back— but the air around her has changed. Her lazy smirk causes it to buzz— or maybe that’s just Agatha’s skin as it raises up the hairs on her arms and in her neck. </p><p>“I’m relieved to see you here, Agatha. Do you mind if I take what I need from your closet?” Rio raises her eyebrow in question as she points to the walk-in with her cane. Agatha’s eyes follow its movement, and she clears her throat before nodding.<br/>
<br/>
“Mi casa es…” <em> Shit, doesn’t Rio know Spanish? </em> “Well, you know what they say.” She chuckles awkwardly, and feels a strong desire to smack herself in the face with a door.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you gonna be good and stay on the bed for me?” Rio asks, still with that haughty expression on her face. That alone makes Agatha’s instinct to defy kick in.<br/>
<br/>
“Maybe I will.” Agatha shrugs. “Maybe I won’t.” It seems like a good enough answer for Rio, because she nods and walks over to the walk-in, disappearing behind the door.<br/>
<br/>
The sound of Rio rummaging around in there makes Agatha’s brain overload with images of what could be happening, and she shifts around uncomfortably. She kicks her heels off to pull her legs up onto the bed, but her slacks are too tight so she drops them again.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha distracts herself by imagining what <em> she </em>would do in Rio’s case, had Rio given her the green light to dominate her. She’d probably get a flogger; though she prefers spanking by hand, a flogger can come in handy for a variety of things. She’d also wear a nice bodysuit, because she likes it if her subs can’t keep her eyes off of her, even if she’d told them not to. And of course, an array of toys; for herself and to use on Rio… </p><p>Her own imagination drives her crazy, and she jumps off the bed like something has stung her in the ass. She turns around and looks back, knowing she should stay on the bed, but her skin crawls. Her hands fly to her temples and she starts rubbing them nervously, her eyes slowly drifting over to the closet door.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you need help in there?”<br/>
<br/>
Instead of giving her an answer, Rio reappears in the doorway. Agatha’s gaze drops to the items she is carrying; a few ropes draped over her underarm, the flogger Agatha had been picturing, a suction vibrator, and a strap without the harness. On top of all that, Rio had foregone her tshirt, but her blazer is back on, shielding most of her upper body from view, but not enough to not see some skin and her bra peeking out.<br/>
<br/>
Ah. <em> So Rio likes her subs not being able to keep their eyes off of her too. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Isn’t that interesting? You were <em> so good </em> just a minute ago,” Rio says, fake pouting in disappointment. She walks around Agatha, shaking her head, and places the items she’s gathered on the bed.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha follows her by turning her upper body around. “I just— I think—”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, that’s exactly what you’re not gonna do anymore,” Rio says, walking back up to her and tapping her temple with a finger. “Didn’t I ask you to do something?” Rio’s eyes flick to the bed, and her eyebrows raise in condescension. Agatha huffs and rolls her eyes, unsure what to say, walks back to the end of the bed and sits down, her hands fumbling in her lap.<br/>
<br/>
It’s quiet for a few seconds and when Agatha looks up, she’s about to lose her absolute temper over the disrespect with which Rio is tapping away on her phone, <em> right in front of her. </em> That wave of rage immediately disappears when soft music starts playing from the speaker, and Rio throws the phone onto the bed, next to the toys.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha exhales slowly, and feels some tension in her shoulders seep away.<br/>
<br/>
Then, Rio takes a step forward, bends over to meet Agatha at her eye line, and places her hands on either side of Agatha’s thighs, effectively trapping her in her position.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha expects her to call her a slur, or cuss her out, or smack her across the face, but instead Rio says: “Look me in the eyes, Agatha. Are you with me?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha blinks and looks up, meeting Rio’s intense stare right in front of her face. “I’m right here,” Agatha says, but it doesn’t sound half as defiant as she’d meant it to sound.<br/>
<br/>
“We’ve talked about our limits before. Any changes there?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha fights the impulse to bite her lip while she maintains eye contact with the intimidating woman in front of her. They had indeed, during a hazy moment of post-orgasmic bliss, shared their limits with each other. <em> Out of curiosity. </em> Not for practice. At least, not at the time.<br/>
<br/>
“No changes.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio nods. “Good. For me either. Do you have any questions for me?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha thinks back to the conversation they had at the police station, and blurts out what she'd wanted to ask for a week now:<br/>
<br/>
“Do you not want to be touched? As a Domme, or when you’re topping, do you prefer to… just give?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio flashes a wolfish grin. “Fuck yes, I want to be touched. But on my terms. Don’t worry, I’ll tell you exactly when and how.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha feels her clit pulse at that answer.<br/>
<br/>
“More questions?”<br/>
<br/>
And Agatha has another one, but she doesn’t really want to ask it, because asking it would be showing her weakness, and she can’t, she can’t have that, she— <em> fuck it, </em> she’s gonna ask.<br/>
<br/>
“Can you tell me… what you’re gonna do to me?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s unpredictability as a Domme is wildly throwing Agatha off. She knows Rio is supposed to be a softer Domme than she is, but somehow that makes her feel more… dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
“Of course I can,” Rio smiles and leans in to brush Agatha’s cheek with the back of her hand, before placing it down by her thigh again. Agatha closes her eyes when she feels Rio’s sweet breath ghost over her lips.<br/>
<br/>
“But stay with me. Look me in the eyes.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha looks up again, and shivers involuntarily.<br/>
<br/>
“First, I’m going to finally tie one of these pretty ropes around you. Because I’ve wanted to for a long time, but also because you’re <em> already </em> bratting out on me and I’m going to need you to be compliant.”<br/>
<br/>
The prospect of Agatha just giving in like that makes her smirk. “Good luck with that.”<br/>
<br/>
“Then, I’m going to stimulate your senses. And maybe I’ll take a few away, I’m not sure yet. You’re going to tell me exactly what you’re feeling when I do those things to you.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh yeah?” Agatha scoffs. Even if Rio manages to wrangle her body into submission, she can’t force her to <em> talk. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Then, if you’re being good, I’ll use some toys on you. I’ll make you feel <em> so good </em> — but you’re not going to come. No, I’ll bring you right to the edge and then stop, just because I like it. I’m gonna lick up all of your juices, and then we’re doing it all over again. Because you wanted to get off in the car, and I have been more than generous.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha ignores another throb in her pussy, and raises an eyebrow. “<em>Lick up my juices? </em>Rio, I’m not a Capri-Sun.”<br/>
<br/>
“I might suck your clit like one.”<br/>
<br/>
Damn, Rio’s fast. Agatha desperately tries to win their staring contest, but loses as soon as a snort bubbles its way up and she breaks eye contact.<br/>
<br/>
“Two more things. Or three, actually,” Rio says, lifting Agatha’s chin up again with a finger.<br/>
<br/>
“One; if you wanna be a brat— you can be.” Rio’s tongue rolls against the inside of her cheek in contained excitement. “I can handle it. But be sure to expect consequences when you do.”<br/>
<br/>
“Consequences? Like what?”<br/>
<br/>
“If you’re lucky, you won’t have to find out,” Rio says with a wicked smirk. “Two; green means?”<br/>
<br/>
“Continue,” Agatha says dutifully.<br/>
<br/>
“Yellow means?”<br/>
<br/>
“Break and check in.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hmm. Red means?”<br/>
<br/>
“Red means stop.”<br/>
<br/>
“Perfect. And stop means?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s brows knit in confusion. “Stop means…?”<br/>
<br/>
“Stop isn’t going to mean anything. So beg all you want.”<br/>
Rio contrasts her threatening words by dropping a chaste kiss on Agatha’s nose. “Last thing; think you can call me Ms. Rio?”<br/>
<br/>
<em> The audacity. </em> “Yes, I can.”<br/>
<br/>
“Good.” Rio smiles, straightens her back, and turns around to walk back toward the closet.<br/>
<br/>
“But I won’t.”<br/>
<br/>
That makes Rio freeze for a second, and Agatha watches her from the back as she seems to be taking a few breaths. <em> Come on, Rio, did you think it was gonna be this easy? </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Rio shakes it off and takes the last few steps to the walk-in. Agatha assumes it’s to close the door at first, but then she realizes Rio snatches her cane from where it’s been leaning against the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Without a word, she turns and walks back to Agatha, crossing the distance in a couple of strides with the help of her cane. She comes to a halt right in front of her again, looking down on her, and looking severely displeased.<br/>
<br/>
The silence stretches, and Agatha can’t longer ignore the tickle in her stomach.<br/>
<br/>
“Well, you didn’t actually expect me to call you that, I hope?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio still doesn’t say anything, just keeps glaring at her while leaning on her cane with both hands. It’s like she knows <em> that Agatha can’t stand the silence. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Rio, come on. That’d be weird. I know you as just Rio. I’ve fed you for weeks. Helped you in and out of the shower. I know what you sound like when you come, begging me not to stop. I can’t fucking call you <em> Ms. Rio.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> The smallest of encouraging smiles appears around Rio’s lips, and Agatha curses softly.<br/>
<br/>
“There you go. Now say it again.”<br/>
<br/>
“No.”<br/>
<br/>
“Are you gonna keep defying me?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, who?”<br/>
<br/>
“Just, yes.”<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha…?” Rio’s voice has dropped to a dangerous octave, but it only spurs Agatha on to grin up at her.<br/>
<br/>
“Yesss?”<br/>
<br/>
<em> Thud. </em><br/>
<br/>
Before she knows what’s happening, Rio has lifted her cane with one hand and pressed it right up against Agatha’s chest, knocking the wind out of her lungs.<br/>
<br/>
“Wanna try that again?”<br/>
<br/>
The longer she stays silent, mouth opening and closing like a fish, the more pressure Rio puts on the cane. It’s not painful, but it definitely could be.<br/>
<br/>
“Fuck, can you… chill?” Agatha says breathlessly, and it causes the cane to lift from her chest, only to be pressed up against her cheek a moment later.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. So much for soft Domme Rio.<br/>
<br/>
“You gonna hit me with that thing?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio cocks her head. “You wanna find out?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s quick wit makes Agatha scoff. “Only because I don’t want to call you— <em> oof.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> The cane is now pressed against her cunt; not the end of it, but the shaft, as Rio has put it on the floor right between her legs.<br/>
<br/>
“Because you don’t want to call me— <em> what?” </em> Rio leans in, her grin slowly spreading across her face, increasing the pressure of the cane with every second.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha grits her teeth. This is <em> not </em> what she had in mind. “Because… I don’t want to call you… Ms. Rio,” she says reluctantly.<br/>
<br/>
“One more time?” Rio whispers in her ear. The pressure against her clit is <em> almost </em> painful now.<br/>
<br/>
“Ms. Rio,” Agatha growls, and just about manages to suppress an eye roll.<br/>
<br/>
“Good enough for now,” Rio decides, and lifts the cane one more time to bump it against Agatha’s chest in an attempt to make her fall backward on the bed. This, Agatha does with an annoyed huff, and immediately feels the bed dip where the other woman climbs onto it too.<br/>
<br/>
Rio crawls on top of her, using the momentum and the element of surprise to push Agatha’s arms down above her head and keep them there by pressing the cane down horizontally, like a bar.<br/>
<br/>
“What the fuck?” Agatha calls out, working her wrists against the metal, but to no avail. “I didn’t know medical devices were <em>allowed</em> if you can’t make your sub do what you want!”<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s smile doesn’t falter; her eyes start sparkling as she leans forward, brushing her mouth over Agatha’s.<br/>
<br/>
“...make my <em> what </em> do what I want?<em>” </em> she asks, immensely pleased.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh go to hell,” Agatha spits, hoping that will provoke Rio even more.<br/>
<br/>
“Hmm, can I take you with me?” Rio asks, her voice sweet like honey, before connecting their lips in a searing kiss.<br/>
<br/>
And Agatha can’t do anything apart from kissing her back; take in her tongue, her breath, her teeth on her lips, while not being able to move her arms. It’s frustrating, at first, but when she realizes that this is Rio’s doing, she can’t possibly <em> expect </em>her to use her arms and hands for the kiss— it’s easier to relax into it. </p><p>“That’s it,” Rio mumbles against her between kisses, the more Agatha lets herself sink into the mattress. “There you go. That’s what we want, isn’t it?”<br/>
<br/>
The praises are effective for a few seconds and Agatha lets herself get carry away by those words, but then her defense mechanism kicks in, and she starts to buck her hips up.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for her, Rio has somehow already grabbed the ropes from where she’d thrown them onto the bed, and starts tying Agatha’s left wrist to the cane while trying not to get bucked off of her.<br/>
<br/>
When Agatha realizes what is happening, her head whips up to look at her own hand. “What the <em> fuck? </em> You’re using it as a goddamn <em> spreader bar?” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Ideally, you’ll want your Domme to be a little creative with what they have,” Rio husks, expertly tying a knot and checking Agatha’s circulation by hooking two fingers under the rope. “This good?” she asks her, and Agatha really, really wants to say <em> no </em> just to be difficult, but—<br/>
<br/>
“Fine,” she grumbles. </p><p>“Beautiful,” Rio smiles, and seals the word with a kiss to her lips. Agatha isn’t sure whether she’s talking about the knot, or… something else.<br/>
<br/>
Her second hand gets tied just as expertly, but in complete silence. A silence which gives Agatha the opportunity to accept her fate.<br/>
<br/>
“I wasn’t going to tie you up right away,” Rio says, checking the second knot for chafing and tightness. “I was going to be so nice to you, actually. But you had to go and be difficult from the start…”<br/>
<br/>
When Agatha has confirmed the second knot isn’t hurting her, Rio straightens her spine and places her hands on Agatha’s hips, still straddling her. <br/>
<br/>
“And I actually need to go downstairs to fetch something, but you’ve proven you can’t follow orders or stay still yet. So, I had to, you know?” she shrugs, pouts, and looks up in innocence. It makes Agatha want to bare her teeth.<br/>
<br/>
“I can still get up like this,” she taunts her, but immediately regrets her words when Rio rolls off of her.<br/>
<br/>
“I was getting to that, but thanks for the reminder,” Rio says, and pushes herself up from the bed to get more ropes. Agatha glares at her as if she’s trying to scorch her with a laser, even when it makes her head tilt in awkward angles, while Rio ties the rope around the outer ends of the cane, and ties those to the bedposts on either side.<br/>
<br/>
“So, Agatha— that crazy large fridge in the kitchen does dispense ice cubes, doesn’t it?” Rio asks when she’s finished. Agatha’s eyes go wide.<br/>
<br/>
“Why?”<br/>
<br/>
“Just answer the question.”<br/>
<br/>
“You know it does.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, I do,” Rio chuckles. “I won’t be long. Behave while I’m going downstairs, yeah? Stay right where you are.” She leans down to softly press her lips to Agatha’s. <br/>
<br/>
When Agatha refuses to look at her after the kiss, Rio whispers: "Agatha. Look me in the eyes." <br/>
<br/>
Agatha's eyes snap up, and Rio's gaze causes a tug on her stomach that she wants to get rid of as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
“How will you get downstairs without your motherfucking cane?” Agatha questions her in a soft, mean voice, craning her neck to get more of Rio’s mouth. But Rio leans back and proudly shows off her balance.<br/>
<br/>
“I should be fine, even in this mansion of yours. And worst case scenario, I’m sure Psycho is kind enough to help me.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha rolls her eyes, purposely not showing how proud she is of Rio’s progress, and lets herself fall back again.<br/>
<br/>
“I will come back,” Rio reassures her. “Don’t move.” She playfully points at Agatha while she walks to the bedroom door, and after making the <em> I’m watching you- </em> gesture with two fingers, she disappears from Agatha’s sight.<br/>
<br/>
For the first minute, Agatha accepts her fate, and waits until Rio comes back. But then her thoughts start to spiral, and before she knows it, she starts trashing against the restraints again. Futile, she knows, until—<br/>
<br/>
One of the knots loosens itself after a few tugs. Agatha gasps and looks up, not quite believing what she’s seeing, but yes, the rope around her right hand is giving.<br/>
<br/>
Driven by a strong rush of adrenaline, she keeps wriggling her hand, until the knot is wide enough to slide her wrist out. She laughs; a short, proud giggle, and undoes the rope around her left hand with her right. Before she knows it, she’s completely free.<br/>
<br/>
But, <em> shit, </em> what now?<br/>
<br/>
Agatha frantically looks around while she hears the familiar creak of the lower steps of the stairs; Rio is on her way back. She panics and jumps off the bed, but her head is empty. What was her game plan here?<br/>
<br/>
<em> And what would Rio do to her once she found out Agatha had freed herself? </em><br/>
<br/>
Out of sheer desperation, she sinks to her knees, contemplating hiding under the bed. <em> No, </em> that would be stupid, no way Rio would find her in such a compromising position.<br/>
<br/>
The patter of footsteps gets increasingly louder; Rio must be at the top of the stairs now. Fuck.<br/>
<br/>
The walk-in?<br/>
<br/>
Agatha rips the door open, but immediately changes her mind. If Rio would find her here, she had nowhere to go.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m back!” sounds Rio’s sing-songy voice as the bedroom door starts to swing open. Agatha has no choice but to stand against the wall, hiding behind the door, holding her breath in anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
“...Agatha?”<br/>
<br/>
Rio sounds utterly confused as she sees the empty bed, and Agatha, despite everything, wishes she could see her face.<br/>
<br/>
“What the fuck?” Rio mumbles softly, and steps closer to the bed. Her back comes into Agatha’s view, and she sees the small bowl of ice she is carrying in her left hand.<br/>
<br/>
Ice meant for her. Yeah, no way.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Rio is more than one step away from the door, Agatha bolts; she pushes herself off the wall and grabs the door handle to swing herself around and stumble into the hallway. The force with which she held onto the handle causes the door to slam shut with a loud <em> bang. </em><br/>
<br/>
“<em>Agatha!” </em> roars Rio’s voice immediately from behind the closed bedroom door. Agatha starts panting, grinning, buzzing with adrenaline. Why is this so goddamn exhilarating? And… so goddamn scary?<br/>
<br/>
Before the bedroom door swings open again, Agatha has fled toward the guest room out of pure instinct. She needs a plan, she needs a comeback… but for now, she needs an escape. Because the prospect of what Rio might do to her once she catches her, gets more and more agonizing by the second.<br/>
<br/>
The weird thing about adrenaline, is nothing else matters. Nothing makes sense, nothing is important, but the one thing that is giving you that all encompassing rush.<br/>
<br/>
“Running from a cripple? <em> Coward!” </em> <em><br/>
</em><br/>
Rio.<br/>
<br/>
“When I find you, you’re in big fucking trouble, Agatha Harkness!” </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>As the soft <em> thud, thud, thud </em> of Rio’s tentative footsteps approaches, Agatha knows that escaping into the guestroom had been walking into a dead end. It’s not the question if Rio will find her, but when.<br/>
<br/>
And where.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing she can do is find the best hiding place in the guestroom, prolonging the moment until Rio catches her, maybe tiring her out a bit in the process.</p><p>Under the bed is impossible because of the drawers. In the wardrobe isn’t an option either; she has no time, and the sound would make it obvious.<br/>
<br/>
The massive mahogany desk across the room is her only option. She crosses the space in no-time, yanks the rolling chair back and dives down, crawling in the tiny space between the two blocks of drawers.<br/>
<br/>
She’s just pulled the rolling chair back into place when the door opens, and she watches Rio’s silhouette limp in like she’s in one of those slasher movies.<br/>
<br/>
“Bold choice, Agatha,” Rio’s voice rumbles through the room, low and dangerous. “You’re making this <em> so much harder </em> for yourself.”<br/>
<br/>
As Rio checks behind the door, Agatha lets those words settle in—<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s right, isn’t she? Letting her dominate is something Agatha hadn’t ever thought of doing, and now that she, somehow, finally trusts her enough, she pretends she doesn’t want it.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn’t make any sense.<br/>
<br/>
While her Domme takes a few steps to glance inside the wardrobe, she imagines what this must look like from Rio’s perspective— power dynamics require an enormous amount of trust from <em> both </em> sides, which means Rio trusts <em> her </em> enough to be submissive.<br/>
<br/>
And this is how she uses that trust? Taking it with open arms, and then bolting as soon as she has the chance?<br/>
<br/>
Watching Rio walk around the bed, Agatha gets overwhelmed by an almost nauseating amount of guilt. This might be the one time in her life she’ll try out being submissive, and this is how she behaves? Not just a bad sub, but a coward too.<br/>
<br/>
She wants to be good for Rio, she really does. She wants to make it difficult for her, of course, but ultimately— she craves nothing more than being on the receiving end of that proud smile she knows Rio possesses. She wants to see Rio’s eyes flicker with adoration, she wants to bring her to an unexplored high.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, here she is. Agatha Harkness, on her knees, hiding under a desk, from someone she’d voluntarily sub for.<br/>
<br/>
Shit.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s scent is the first thing that reaches her there— a mixture of perfume and something inexplicably Rio. Agatha feels her heart rate pick up and when she reaches up to cover her own mouth, she realizes how badly her hands are shaking.<br/>
<br/>
But it’s not just her hands— her entire body is shaking from a mixture of feelings. Arousal, guilt, shame, disappointment, and the worst one: fear. Fear of what Rio might do to her, or <em> not </em> to do her, based on her actions. Fear of having hurt her feelings.<br/>
<br/>
It’s simply too much. Tears prickle behind her eyes and she tries to breathe through it, breathe, breathe, breathe—</p><p>But her breathing picks up too fast, and before she knows it, she’s hyperventilating.<br/>
<br/>
She needs to get out of here.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m sorry!” she blurts out, kicking the rolling chair out with her foot before crawling out from under the desk. Upon making eye contact with a baffled Rio, her body feels weak, almost too weak to fully get up.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m sorry Rio, I’m so sorry,” is all she can say between ragged breaths, looking up at Rio with pleading eyes, fighting against her own tears. She feels stupid, a stupid idiot, a stupid fucking idiot—<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, hey,” Rio interrupts her thoughts with a soft voice, a total difference from what she’d sounded like earlier. “Come here, Agatha. Get up.” Rio beckons her to stand, only because it’d be hard for her to crouch down.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha meekly rises to her feet, her body wobbly, her gaze down.<br/>
<br/>
“Come here,” Rio says again, taking one more step toward her. She carefully takes Agatha’s underarms and places them around her neck, after which she wraps her own arms around Agatha’s waist, pulling her in for a tight hug.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m sorry,” Agatha says once more, the sound muffled against Rio’s neck. The amount of guilt in her chest is still contracting her lungs, and almost painful at this point.<br/>
<br/>
“Talk to me,” Rio whispers, soothingly scratching her nails up and down Agatha’s spine. “What’s going on, hm?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m… s-sorry,” Agatha sniffles, tightening the hug in full anticipation of this being the last time she might ever be able to touch Rio. “I didn’t— I don’t want to make you angry. I didn’t mean to… Don’t want to disappoint you. Don’t know why I did this. Are you— are you mad at me?”<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, what are you so in your head for?” Rio coos in her ear, her voice immediately having a calming effect on her. She then presses a soft kiss to Agatha’s neck, which finally shakes her up out of her trance.<br/>
<br/>
“W-what the fuck is happening?” Agatha stutters, leaning back out of the hug. Her head is clearer, but the shaking of her body increases. She locks eyes with Rio; the only sense of grounding she can hold on to.<br/>
<br/>
“Adrenaline,” Rio says with a soft smile, bringing her hand up to cup Agatha’s face. “Sub drop, if I may take an educated guess. Come on, sit on the bed for me.”<br/>
<br/>
Though Rio has dropped her full authority, she still sounds confident and responsible. She turns around to guide Agatha to the bed.<br/>
<br/>
“Sub drop?” Agatha huffs as she sits down. “This early in the game? We haven’t done anything yet.”<br/>
<br/>
“I can only imagine how anxious your first time subbing has made you,” Rio empathizes. She brushes a strand of hair out of Agatha’s sweaty face.<br/>
<br/>
“I wasn’t even fully subbing.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yet.”<br/>
<br/>
“I just didn’t want to disappoint you.”<br/>
<br/>
“And why is that?”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha thinks about that while taking a few deep breaths. This extreme reaction can’t have anything to do with Rio being a Domme. The only thing that made her spiral was the idea of being bad for Rio, who had done nothing to deserve her bad behavior.<br/>
<br/>
And the reason she can’t stand being bad for Rio, <em> her Domme</em>—<br/>
<br/>
Fuck.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, wait—<br/>
<br/>
“So being submissive <em> is </em> a different headspace?”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t tell me you don’t know that,” Rio chuckles, lifting Agatha’s face by placing a finger under her chin. </p><p>“Yeah, well, I figured it was an active choice my subs would make.”<br/>
<br/>
“It is,” Rio nods. “But there’s a difference between choosing to obey your Domme, or choosing to give up your autonomy. Your inner brat prevented you from doing the first, so your body chose the second option for you. And if that goes too fast, too intense—”<br/>
<br/>
“Sub drop happens,” Agatha finishes for her, scrunching her nose. “So it’s my own fucking fault. I’m sending myself into a full panic because I can’t stop being difficult.”<br/>
<br/>
“No, sweetheart.” Rio shakes her head. “This one’s on me. I shouldn’t have left you alone this early. Of course you did what you did.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha opens her mouth to protest her words, because <em> no, </em> of course she can be left alone, she isn’t weak enough to need supervision all the time— but can’t find it in her to open that discussion. Maybe because her body is still coming down from the tension. Maybe because she knows Rio is right.<br/>
<br/>
“Here’s what we’re gonna do,” Rio continues, her tone leaving no room for other suggestions. “We’re gonna go downstairs to get water and snacks, because I’m not leaving you alone again. We’re gonna come back up, and we’re gonna cuddle on the bed.”<br/>
<br/>
“We’re <em> not </em> cuddling,” Agatha immediately scoffs.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh yes, we are. There will be cuddling.”<br/>
<br/>
“No cuddling in this house, Vidal.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m gonna cuddle you <em> so hard</em>—”<br/>
<br/>
“What if cuddling is my hard fucking limit?” Agatha snaps, and immediately regrets it when Rio’s expression drops.<br/>
<br/>
“Is it?” she asks, because of course she would.<br/>
<br/>
“No, it isn’t,” Agatha reluctantly admits.<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t you cuddle your subs during aftercare?” Rio asks, her head tilted.<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, I do. If that’s what <em> they </em> want,” Agatha emphasizes. “Who in their right mind looks at me and thinks: ‘I bet she’s a huge fucking teddy bear?’”<br/>
<br/>
“Me,” Rio says, flashing her the biggest smile. “Come on. We’ll try it for five minutes. If you don’t like it, we’ll do something else.” </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After having fetched two bottles of water, crackers with hummus, and half a mango each, Agatha finds herself –despite everything she had ever believed about herself– leaning back against Rio, who sits against the headboard of the bed in the guestroom.<br/>
<br/>
Rio had tried to get them into Agatha’s own bedroom, but had quickly changed course after she’d learned how passionate Agatha gets about crumbs in her bed.<br/>
<br/>
And now, sitting between Rio’s legs, Agatha wants to fight it, wants to hate it, wants to stay grumpy about it.<br/>
<br/>
But the way Rio’s soft body functions as a pillow, the way her fingers stroke lightly through her hair, the way she praises her with a kiss on the cheek every time Agatha takes a sip of her water— well, there is no fighting <em> that. </em><br/>
<br/>
Sue her for liking being coddled for a fucking second.<br/>
<br/>
Her own inner critic pops up to mention how absolutely ridiculous this entire situation is, but when she reasons with herself about the fact that nobody can see her, and Rio doesn’t seem to mind, she wiggles her body and slumps down against Rio just a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
“So… the sex ship has sailed, I assume?” Agatha inquires around a mouthful of mango, trying not to sound disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
“We can have sex…” Rio drawls. “But in order for you to try and sub again, we should build up to that. If you still want it.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha scowls at the accusation of not being capable of doing something, even if that something is submitting to someone else. She’s torn between accepting that she’s hard to break, or proving that she can do whatever she sets her mind to.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that Rio lovingly swipes a droplet of mango juice from her chin seems to make the decision a little easier.<br/>
<br/>
“As long as you know I’m not mad at you,” Rio whispers against her temple, oblivious to the fact that her words are only egging Agatha on. “And I’d lie if I said it didn’t please me a little; you wanting to be good for me.” </p><p>The more Rio’s voice drops, the tighter the coiling in Agatha’s lower belly gets. And not only that; she starts to feel like floating in her own head. She needs this; she’s come so close. She needs to keep going now.<br/>
<br/>
“You sure you’re not mad at me?” Agatha asks, twisting her upper body to look Rio in the eye. Rio hums. Agatha’s gaze drops to her lips.<br/>
<br/>
“Prove it,” Agatha orders, her careful whisper lacking her usual authority. She sees a flicker of concern cast over Rio’s face, before it twists into something playful.<br/>
<br/>
“Already making demands?” she quips. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say there’s no taming that brat in you.”<br/>
<br/>
“Are you giving up?” Agatha challenges her, back to locking eyes with Rio. She doesn’t say anything, but her mind begs Rio to say no.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Don’t give up on me. I can be good. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Hell no,” Rio says with a smile, and Agatha has to bite her bottom lip to hide a relieved squeal.<br/>
<br/>
“Then prove it,” she says again, tracing a line over Rio’s skin from her chin all the way down to her sternum, stopping at the front clasp of her bra.<br/>
<br/>
“Agatha,” Rio warns her in a stern voice, her eyes turning dark and dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
“Hm?” she replies innocently, playfully flicking the piece of metal that connects the cups of the bra. She rolls her tongue in her mouth as she sends a defiant look to the increasingly displeased looking woman.<br/>
<br/>
“Behave,” Rio says in a low growl. It sends a nervous tickle through Agatha’s stomach— a way more enjoyable one than what she’d experienced half an hour ago.<br/>
<br/>
It’s right there and then she decides: <em> this </em>is the kind of brat she wants to be. Challenging and provoking Rio head on, not defying her behind her back. </p><p>“If you so much as <em> think </em> about—”<br/>
<br/>
Rio hasn’t even finished her sentence when Agatha swiftly unclasps the bra with her thumb and pointer finger. She elastic <em> snaps </em> to the sides, and one second later Agatha is on her back with a feral Rio straddling her hips. Rio’s weight pressing down on her while her arms are being pinned to the mattress feels— <em> freeing? </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Hi,” Agatha breathes through a grin, happy to have found Rio’s activation button. Her eyes sparkle in anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
“You…” Rio grumbles, but no words seem important enough to be spoken over what they both desperately want. Rio leans forward and determinedly captures Agatha’s lips with her own, breathing her in as if the contact brings her great relief. Agatha moans into the kiss to let her know how badly she wants this, and goosebumps appear on her skin when Rio’s nails rake slowly down her wrists.<br/>
<br/>
Rio all but loses herself in the kiss, and the floating feeling in Agatha’s head increases until nothing is more important than sucking in Rio’s breath, kissing her mouth from every angle, and licking the taste off her tongue until it stays forever burned in her memory.<br/>
<br/>
“What do you want me to do?” Rio pants against her lips, out of breath from the sheer intensity of it.<br/>
<br/>
“You wanted to put me in my place—” Agatha whispers, chasing Rio’s mouth with her own. “—so do it. Fucking do it.”<br/>
<br/>
<em> Let me be good for you. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Rio’s hooded eyes stay fixated on Agatha’s slow smirk, before her own lip curls up into a lopsided smile.<br/>
<br/>
“Do it, <em> who?” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em>And fuck it, she’s made it all this way. </p><p>Let Rio do it, or be her undoing. <br/>
<br/>
“Please, put me in my place, Miss Rio.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio clearly fights against the dropping of her own jaw, but loses that battle. Not out of bewilderment, but out of sheer arousal<em>. </em> She reaches forward to take Agatha’s chin in her hand, runs her thumb across her bottom lip.<br/>
<br/>
“That’s a good girl, Agatha.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha knows Rio is studying her for a reaction, and though she doesn’t want to give her the satisfaction, Rio’s proud smile can’t stop the whimper from escaping Agatha’s throat.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, you like that? You like being good for me?”<br/>
<br/>
A spark of excitement shoots through her body, hitting Agatha straight between the legs.<br/>
<br/>
Guess she does.<br/>
<br/>
“I knew your bratty side would sit and heel the moment I’d use a few praising words on you,” Rio says so mockingly that Agatha knows she’s actively being taunted. </p><p>She’s not gonna let it be <em> that </em> easy.<br/>
<br/>
“Too bad the ice has probably melted by now,” Agatha says airily, referencing the bowl of ice cubes Rio had gone to fetch earlier. “I bet you could have done crazy things with that.”<br/>
<br/>
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” is Rio’s measured response before she leans in to press her lips to Agatha’s again.<br/>
<br/>
“What would you have done with it?” Agatha wants to know between kisses.<br/>
<br/>
“Want me to tell you?” A kiss on the corner of her mouth. One on her jaw. Her neck. Her earlobe. “Or—”<br/>
<br/>
“Show, don’t tell, Miss Rio,” Agatha says like a student reciting the answer in a lecture hall. The way she pronounces her name makes it clear she still ridicules the use of it.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s expression turns serious for a moment. “I don’t want to leave you alone again,” she says sincerely, but Agatha wants to nip that in the bud.<br/>
<br/>
“Promise I’ll be good,” she hums, surprising mostly herself with the honesty behind that statement.<br/>
<br/>
Rio carefully takes her in, contemplating her options. Her eyes roam over Agatha’s body— stuck between taking responsibility and trusting Agatha to voice her own boundaries. Something in Agatha’s calm demeanor must’ve convinced Rio; she nods. “If you say you’re okay with that, and you can promise me you’ll stay right here for a minute, I trust you.”<br/>
<br/>
Pride blooms in Agatha’s chest. She nods.<br/>
<br/>
“I won’t tie you up this time,” Rio declares.<br/>
<br/>
“Couldn’t do it last time either.”<br/>
<br/>
“Brat.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s lips curl up into a devious smirk. “You <em> liiiiiike </em> it,” she drawls, shimmying her hips.<br/>
Rio leans in to place a deliberate kiss on her lips; one that makes Agatha want more.<br/>
<br/>
But as Rio crawls off the bed, she knows the only way she’ll <em>get</em> more is by doing what Rio wants her to do: absolutely nothing. Which already proves quite difficult two seconds after Rio blows her a kiss, leaves the room, and Agatha’s first instinct is to get up and block the entrance by pushing the wardrobe in front of it.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Just stay still. Just lay back. Just breathe. In and out. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> She squeezes her eyes shut, telling herself over and over again that Rio will be back soon, that Rio will want her to be right where she is, that the <em> real </em> play can begin.<br/>
<br/>
Though as she can hear Rio rummage around downstairs, her skin starts to crawl; a million ants trekking from her neck to her feet in anticipation of being touched later. Her joints start to ache— it can’t be <em> healthy </em> to not move for an extended amount of time, can it?<br/>
<br/>
<em> No. Stay on the bed. She’ll be back any minute now. </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> As the downstairs noise stills, Agatha’s subconscious provides her a birds-eye view of herself, waiting to be dominated by another. Someone calls her <em> pathetic </em> in the back of her brain. <em> How the mighty have fallen, </em> it mocks her. The fact that submitting is a conscious choice right now? <em> Weak. </em><br/>
<br/>
It takes a few more heartbeats for Agatha to realize it’s her own voice. And she <em> knows </em> her inner critic isn’t right, she <em> knows </em> handing over control isn’t weak— it won’t stop calling her that.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Rio, please co— </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> “Look at you.”<br/>
<br/>
A voice, Rio’s voice, sounding genuinely impressed, pulls her out of her inner battle.<br/>
<br/>
“See, Agatha?” she whispers in awe, and when Agatha opens her eyes she watches Rio slowly approach the bed with a soft look in her eyes and a bowl of ice in her hand. “See how good you can be?”<br/>
<br/>
And Agatha knows Rio is laying the praise on thick, maybe thicker than is natural, only to prove a point. But despite that, she can’t stop the butterflies in her stomach from fluttering at Rio’s smile.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha frowns to not let her face show the warm and lazy feeling that bubbles up, twists her mouth and clicks her tongue to not grin.<br/>
<br/>
Rio, sadly, is not an idiot. She tuts, shakes her head, places the bowl on the bed. “Don’t hide,” she says with a knowing smile, reaching out to casually move the hem of Agatha’s shirt up so she can lightly tickle her side with her ice cold fingertips.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s left eye flinches, but stays still otherwise. Rio crawls back onto the bed, graciously straddling her— she’s gotten rid of her bra, but the jacket is still on. Agatha has a full frontal view of the slope of her breasts, the nipples just hidden behind black fabric, and she can suddenly feel her heartbeat in her eyeballs. Rio’s self-satisfied smirk tells her she’s doing a poor job of hiding the hunger it makes her feel.<br/>
<br/>
“Show me what it does to you. What I do to you,” Rio says, moving some stray pieces of hair from Agatha’s face. “I need to know what affects you.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha lets out a nearly aggressive breath she’s been holding, feeling her shoulders slacken.<br/>
<br/>
“That’s it,” Rio praises, leaning forward to press a chaste kiss to her cheek. “Again. Exhale.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio pointedly breathes in through her nose, rounds her lips, and exhales slowly, in controlled fashion. Agatha’s lashes flutter as Rio’s cold breath ghosts over her face, and she follows her lead.<br/>
<br/>
Rio has locked onto her and doesn’t look away for a second. When Agatha exhales for a second time, some of the tension leaves through her fingertips. She feels calmer.<br/>
<br/>
“There you go.”<br/>
<br/>
A line of kisses is traced down along her jaw, from her ear to her chin, then up to her mouth. “I’m gonna kiss you now,” Rio whispers almost inaudibly.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Is that not what you have been doing? </em> Agatha wonders for a second. Then, her entire world gets shaken up when Rio dives in to <em> really </em> kiss her— and there’s nothing chaste, or casual, or lazy, or careless about the way her tongue finds its way between Agatha’s lips.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>
<br/>
It’s not greedy or hungry either, but the way Rio pours so much determination into Agatha’s mouth when it opens on a breathy moan, makes her toes curl. Her fingers dig into the sheets, unsure whether she can touch Rio or not, and the only thing she can do as Rio kisses that voice in the back of her head into shatters, is kiss her back.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh,” she now says out loud into the kiss, finally understanding why Rio thought this heated assault on her mouth and tongue needed a warning. Rio passionately drinks her up and Agatha feels so deeply <em>wanted.<br/>
</em>She can hear more noise leaving her own throat, but she has no control over them. Her clit pulses so violently it makes her pelvis jolt up; she needs to break the kiss to gasp for oxygen.<br/>
<br/>
“Damn, Rio. The hell was <em> that,” </em> she pants, half laughing, half still dousing the fire in her brain. She knows the answer. <em> That </em> was a fucking <em> kiss. </em><br/>
<br/>
“That is what being good will get you,” Rio answers, her tone light, and Agatha starts to understand what the difference between their domination styles really entails. “That is what you can earn if you can hold off being a brat.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha groans in protest. “Can’t I have both?” Because she doesn’t think a kiss has ever made her feel like that before. She knows from experience the kind of kisses Rio is capable of; they have left her melted and pliable before. But still, there is something different about this one. Something even more.<br/>
<br/>
“If you want me to be in control—” Rio says in a casual voice, head tilting as she leans back, “You’ll have to do something for me.”<br/>
<br/>
“What’s that?” Agatha asks breathlessly as a wave of pure desire for the woman on top of her crashes over her. Right at this moment, she can't think of anything she wouldn't do for her. Rio smiles down at her; a lazy, confident tug on her lips, her eyes dark.<br/>
<br/>
“Give it to me.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha tilts her head, grins back, and shakes her head. </p><p>
<em> “Take it from me.”  </em>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicker with something that smashes right through her calm composure as her smirk fades away into a predatory gaze. It strikes Agatha right in her core and she gasps, her hands shooting to Rio’s hips as if she’s some sort of beacon to hold onto. There is one second of tense silence, time stands still, and then—</p><p>Rio snatches Agatha’s wrists away and places them over her head, pressing them into the mattress. Her mouth starts attacking Agatha’s neck, all teeth and tongue, and her vigorous movements cause her hips to slide over Agatha’s. </p><p>Agatha moans, loudly, both at the feeling of being claimed and at the sensation of Rio’s upper body pressing her down. She tries to tug her wrists free, but Rio’s grip on them tightens, finally showing her raw strength. It hurts a little— Agatha feels the muscles in her thighs tense up deliciously. </p><p>The moment Rio takes both of her wrists in one hand so she has the other one free, Agatha thinks she might have an opportunity, and <em> yanks. </em>This time her wrists do slip from Rio’s grasp, but she is quick. </p><p>“Oh absolutely not,” Rio says, her voice low. Agatha flails as she tries to turn around, bucking Rio up in the process, but Rio just snatches her wrists as they pass her face, presses them down in the original position, and holds them with one hand; more weight on them this time. Her other hand moves away, lower, behind herself, and the next thing Agatha feels is a sharp pinch to one of her ass cheeks.</p><p>“Ow!” Agatha stares at Rio in absolute horror. </p><p>“Figured you might like a spanking too much,” Rio shrugs, that devious grin back on her face. She pinches Agatha’s skin again, making her yelp. “You misbehave, you’ll deal with the consequences. Consequences you <em> won’t </em>like.” </p><p>Her Domme’s stern look sets something ablaze inside of her. The combination of wanting to be defiant and wanting to be corrected makes for a confusing, though not unpleasant feeling in her chest. Rio takes the opportunity and uses her free hand to yank Agatha’s shirt up, tugging it left and right until it sits just below her chin. </p><p>“Looks like you gotta unhand me if you wanna undress me,” Agatha says, wiggling her eyebrows. Rio just scoffs; “Oh please.” </p><p>She bunches the fabric up in her fist and pulls it right over Agatha’s head, letting it rest in her neck, effectively tangling her up in her own shirt. Rio wastes no time and tugs one of her bra cups down to continue her assault on Agatha's skin with her teeth and tongue. </p><p>The moment her lips envelop one of Agatha’s nipples, it’s all she can feel. A shiver runs through her body, the sharp pleasurable pain from Rio’s teeth sends a hot flash of lightning to her pussy. She whines and squirms, wanting the feeling to stop and also very much not to stop. </p><p>During the moments Rio gets lost in claiming every part of Agatha’s skin, Agatha still tries to get her hands free, just for the hell of it. Rio’s effortless metal grip is somehow turning her on <em> more.  </em></p><p>“Stop that,” Rio mumbles, emphasizing her words by giving one of Agatha’s breast a slap with the flat of her palm. </p><p>Agatha’s jaw drops; “How dare you?” If anything, Rio’s behavior fuels her instinct to wriggle herself free. To her own surprise, she manages that by twisting one of her wrists and swinging them to the side. </p><p>This time, she quickly moves them out of Rio’s reach and chuckles mockingly— can’t hide the smug look on her face even if she tried. </p><p>“You’re not gonna like what happens next,” Rio says calmly, leaning back with no intention of capturing Agatha’s arms again. “That’s a choice, Agatha. You know what being <em> good </em>can get you. And still you choose… going against me?” </p><p>A brief wave of guilt ripples through Agatha’s body. Is she giving Rio the idea she doesn’t want her reward? That she doesn’t want <em> her? </em>That was never her intention, she just needs Rio to show that she won’t give up— </p><p>Just as she’s about to apologize and backpedal, she catches the quick, subtle wink Rio sends her way. </p><p>
<em> Oh.  </em>
</p><p>She’s still playing. Good. </p><p>“Wanna know how this is gonna go?” Rio challenges her, her voice honey-like as she innocently rakes her nails down Agatha’s bare torso. </p><p>“Sure. Tell me how you <em> think </em>this is gonna go.” </p><p>Rio seems unfazed. “For your behavior in the car, your escape attempt earlier, and your overall brattiness, there are going to be consequences. I’m going to bring you to the edge. You’re going to tell me when you’re close, and then I will stop. And then we will do it all over again.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha feels her nipples tighten, both at Rio’s voice and at the anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
“How many times?” </p><p>“More than three. Less than seven.”<br/>
<br/>
“<em>What?” </em> <em><br/>
</em><br/>
“Where is the fun in knowing? The only thing you have to worry about is telling me when you’re about to come.” Rio lightly brushes Agatha’s cheek with the back of her hand. “And I’ll do the rest.” </p><p>Agatha stares at her for three heartbeats. “Yeah, you’re right,” she nods. “That <em>does</em> sound like it sucks.” </p><p>She starts bucking her hips up to wriggle her body free, only spurred on when Rio starts to cackle. She rides Agatha’s trashing hips like a seasoned cowboy, her expression amused, still no sign of any effort whatsoever. Agatha tries to shove her off by the thighs, but Rio slaps her hands away. She tries to pull her legs from under the other woman, but Rio doubles down and pins Agatha down even harder. When she twists her upper body slither out of Rio’s strong thigh grip, she hears her Domme inhale sharply.</p><p>“Alright, that’s enough,” Rio says serenely, and instead of slamming Agatha onto her back, she grabs Agatha’s waist and moves <em> with </em>her, turning her onto her front. Next thing she knows, her hands are pinned to her back like she’s being arrested, a hand slides past her neck and shoulders to find a gentle grip around her throat, and Rio’s almost full body weight lands on her ass. </p><p>As the grip on her throat slowly tightens, she feels a knee being wedged between her thighs, and Rio’s breath in her ear. </p><p>“I thought you were supposed to be a <em> soft </em>Domme,” Agatha murmurs in a teasing tone, her words muffled by the mattress. </p><p>“I am,” Rio rasps warmly in her ear. Her thumb starts dangerously rubbing along the artery in Agatha’s neck, sending her spiraling. “But that doesn’t mean I don’t know how to handle bratty sluts like you.” </p><p>While she talks, the hand on Agatha’s throat starts choking her for real. Rio’s fingers and thumb squeeze into the side of her neck, partly cutting off the blood flow to her brain. A groan leaves Agatha’s lips, her eyes roll back into her head. </p><p>
<em> Fuck, this isn’t supposed to feel good, is it?  </em>
</p><p>“Oh, you like that too,” Rio points out, grinding the knee between Agatha’s thighs against her pussy. It’s almost like the blood that can’t reach her brain is changing direction and flowing to her cunt instead.<br/>
<br/>
She needs more. </p><p>“You made your point,” Agatha strains to get the words out. And she means it— Rio’s display of strength and her warm body make her feel safe and seen. “Now I need—” She groans again as she grinds her pussy down against Rio’s knee, the rest of the words dissolving before they can reach her mouth. </p><p>“Yeah? Need what? Finish your sentence, Agatha.” </p><p>“Y’know what I need.” </p><p>“If you don’t tell me, I’m not helping you get off.” </p><p>“No?” Well, challenge <em> fucking </em>accepted. </p><p>Agatha spreads her legs a bit more, as well as she’s able to in this position, and starts rubbing her clothed pussy against Rio’s knee in a steady rhythm. And even though it’s not enough, she chases the stimulation like it’s the only thing she needs in life. It may very well be. </p><p>It doesn’t take more than twenty seconds for Agatha to start panting, which is when she realizes what is happening. Her frantic movements, the hand still around her throat, Rio unmoving but humming in appreciation— she must look fucking <em> desperate.  </em></p><p>Her body stills at once. </p><p>“What, tired already?” Rio pouts. “You were doing <em> so well, </em>sweetheart.” </p><p>“Just fucking touch me,” Agatha growls, cunt throbbing with need. </p><p>“Mm, no.”</p><p>“Rio!” </p><p>“Who?” </p><p>When Agatha exhales sharply out of frustration, she doesn’t expect to make a noise that sounds suspiciously like a sob. </p><p>“I’d like you to keep doing what you were doing,” Rio whispers with the conviction of a snake. “If you can be good and bring yourself to the edge, then stop, I’ll do the next one.” </p><p>And Agatha wants to protest, wants to say something smart, wants to ridicule Rio’s approach— but she can only huff. Her upper body relaxes, her lower body starts grinding against Rio’s knee again. It’s not desperation, she tells herself. It’s a cunning way to get Rio to touch her in the end. Yes, that’s what it is. </p><p>“There we go, that’s a good girl, Agatha,” Rio hums, fingers digging into her neck again. </p><p>“Don’t call me that,” Agatha sneers, hips moving in an increasingly heated tempo. </p><p>“Don’t call you a good girl?” Rio asks for clarification, her voice colored by surprise. </p><p>It makes her feel mocked. Makes her feel like the caricature of a sub. Like she needs the validation from her Domme. And that’s not what this is; it’s not like she <em> needs </em> Rio to tell her she’s good. She doesn’t <em> need </em>it. </p><p>But it does help. A little. The fact that a brightening feeling creeps into her chest whenever she pleases Rio— that’s a good motivator. Again, she doesn’t <em> need </em> being called a good girl, but the thing, the problem, the objective problem here, is that it sounds so good coming from Rio’s mouth. Almost like she means it. Almost like she wants to convince Agatha that she <em> is </em>in fact a good girl. Because—</p><p>Because she wants to be. And she can be. She wants to be a good girl. </p><p>“N—no,” Agatha pants. “S-say it. Tell me, oh—” </p><p>The fire between her legs flares up and the movement of her hips gets slower, but more intentional, deeper. She drags her cunt across whatever she can feel, and groans uncontrollably. </p><p>“Fuck,” she hears Rio say, taken by surprise and in awe. “Oh, wow. Fuck. Look at this— <em> good fucking girl.”  </em></p><p>“Ah— oh shit,” Agatha keens, Rio’s words only adding to the sensation between her legs. </p><p>“Careful,” Rio suddenly hisses, another warning squeeze of her throat as a reminder. “Stop before you come.” </p><p>Agatha’s first instinct to say <em> fuck you </em> and enjoy her climax in all its glory takes about a second and a half. Then she realizes Rio’s impressed voice has nestled its way into her brain, the way she looks at her when she’s proud of her, and Agatha knows she must’ve completely lost her mind, maybe because of the lack of blood flow, maybe because of Rio, but she needs, <em> needs </em>to see and hear that again. More than she needs an orgasm. </p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” she pants as her movements come to a halt. The climax she was about to reach ebbs away, and she mourns the loss with a growl that turns into a whine. </p><p>“There you go,” Rio says, releasing the grip around her neck and pressing a soft kiss to Agatha’s cheek. “So obedient— when you want to be.” </p><p>Long fingers work their way into her hair, soothingly scratching her scalp, and it briefly makes her feel like floating again. But more than that, she needs Rio to—</p><p>“Touch me!” she shouts, her voice breaking, and she tells herself she’ll be embarrassed about that at a more convenient time. </p><p>To her surprise, she feels the weight of Rio’s body lift from her back, fingers hooking into each side of the waistband of her underwear, tugging them down. She hadn’t expected Rio to give in, especially because she hadn’t exactly phrased it in a polite way, but she’ll take it, she needs Rio’s fingers— </p><p>“<em>Ow!” </em>Agatha’s breath leaves her lungs when she feels another sharp pinch in the skin of her ass cheek. “You gotta stop that!” </p><p>“You gotta stop forgetting about your manners,” Rio fires back. Her words are followed by a sharp smack to Agatha’s ass, making her hiss in a combination of pain and pleasure. Without warning, her fingers dip between Agatha’s folds and slide along the length of her. </p><p>Agatha shatters.</p><p>“Ye-yes! Oh god oh god oh god— Rio, I need you there, right there, oh fuck!” she keens, any self-consciousness out the window. She can’t help it, when Rio’s finger gets in the vicinity of her clit, it just feels <em> so good.  </em></p><p>Rio keeps teasing her for a moment longer before making deliberate circles around her clit, fast tracking her way to Agatha’s orgasm. </p><p>Agatha can feel it, it’s <em> right there, </em>a race car at full speed about to slam into a solid wall—</p><p>“Don’t forget to tell me when to stop,” Rio reminds her, not sounding entirely unaffected anymore. </p><p>“Oh, fuck!” That’s fucking right. Fuck. She is almost there, almost, and she contemplates just giving in and letting her climax wash over her. </p><p>“Wouldn’t want to disappoint me now, would you?” Rio adds some fuel to Agatha’s inner fire. Agatha punches out a breath of air, conflicted between finding that a ridiculous statement, and finding that ridiculous statement true.<br/>
<br/>
“Stop,” she manages, loudly groaning when Rio’s touch disappears immediately. Her climax ebbs away like Rio has thrown water on a lit fuse.<br/>
<br/>
“I hate you,” Agatha grits her teeth and bristles into the mattress. “If you keep doing this, I will hate you forever.”<br/>
<br/>
She hears Rio mock gasp behind her, and instead of a retort she catches the clinking sound of the metal bowl. Before she can process what that means, there’s an ice cold sensation against the base of her spine, and she hisses.<br/>
<br/>
“I was gonna tell you how proud I am of you, and then you had to go and spoil it by being so mean to me,” Rio says almost as casually as if she’d been talking about the weather. She clicks her tongue in disapproval, and the icy feeling disappears.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha turns her head to scowl at Rio, buries her nose in her own shoulder, and just catches the sight of Rio popping an ice cube in her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
“Wanna take that back?” Rio lisps around the ice, rolling it through her mouth as she makes obnoxious sucking noises.<br/>
<br/>
Ha. Not when Rio gets like this, she won’t.<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t think so,” Agatha offers, basically turning herself into a giant target, and she knows it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, Rio chooses action over words and leans forward, pressing the half-molten ice cube to Agatha’s spine with her mouth and dragging it slowly down until it turns into a trail of water, which she then lavishly licks up. Agatha shivers, her neck hairs on end, her body throbbing.<br/>
<br/>
“You forgot how to be nice? That’s okay, I’ve got time,” Rio declares after which more clinking sounds follow, and suddenly there are two ice cubes pressed to either side of Agatha’s neck.<br/>
<br/>
The screech that leaves her throat has to stay between her, Rio, and the bedroom walls— or someone will simply have to die. </p><p>“Off, <em> off!” </em> she yelps, clawing at her own neck in an attempt to get her hands between the ice and her poor, sensitive skin.<br/>
<br/>
“Still hate me?” Rio asks, offering her an out.<br/>
<br/>
“Obviously!” Agatha spits back, knowingly making it only harder for herself.<br/>
<br/>
“Mm. Can’t have that.” The ice cubes stay firmly pressed to her skin while Rio drags them both down her shoulders, shoulder blades, down her back, eventually bringing them to rest on top of Agatha’s ass cheeks, where they slowly start to melt.<br/>
<br/>
Rio mumbles something that sounds a suspicious amount like “<em>gorgeous”, </em>presumably stares at Agatha’s back for a few seconds, and eventually scoots down so she can envelop one of the cubes with her mouth again. She pushes it around with her tongue on the soft surface of Agatha’s ass, before spreading her cheeks with her hands and letting the ice slip in between. </p><p>Agatha’s body heat makes the ice melt faster. She starts squirming in agony when she feels the ice water starting to dribble down past her pussy. It cools her down just as much as it heats her up, the duality of the sensation driving her insane.<br/>
<br/>
“Just get back to <em> work,” </em> she whimpers, which apparently does not please her Domme as she deduces from context clues that a fresh ice cube might be on its way to a new location on her body.<br/>
<br/>
Yet nothing could’ve prepared for the careful prodding of Rio’s ice cold fingers at her pussy, before indeed another ice cube is pressed right against her cunt.<br/>
<br/>
“Fuck! Ah! No, mother<em>fucker</em>!” Agatha trashes to get it <em> away </em> from her, but of course, Rio easily keeps her in check as the sharp icy pinch starts to affect all nerve endings between her legs.<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t tell me you don’t love it?” Rio asks, almost sounding offended.<br/>
<br/>
“Of course I do-hon’t! <em> Rio!” </em><br/>
<br/>
Agatha lets out a gasp that makes the windows rattle as Rio, with surgical precision and the care of a lover, massages her opening with the ice cube until it’s small enough to slide in. Agatha is more than slick enough, so two of Rio’s fingers follow, making sure to press the ice all the way in.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Sadist!” </em> she accuses the undoubtedly grinning woman behind her, panting against a pillow. “What the hell is <em> wrong </em>with you!” She hates it so much that she loves it. And she knows Rio knows. </p><p>As the ice melts at rapid pace in her most intimate spot, Rio carries the conversation on as if she <em>isn’t </em>actively domming her by fucking her with an ice cube.<br/>
<br/>
“You should be thankful,” she sighs, almost sounding bored. “I’m trying to make you feel so good, and all you do is call me names.”<br/>
<br/>
“Make me feel good?” Agatha cries out. “How about you shove some ice up your own cunt, let’s see how you feel about that!”<br/>
<br/>
And while that’s meant to provoke Rio, Agatha should’ve known by now that her Domme is always two steps ahead of her. So instead of getting angry or giving her a sharp, witty retort, Rio climbs off of Agatha and calmly guides her into rolling onto her back. She makes quick work of her own pants and underwear, leaving her in only her blazer now, and goes back to straddling Agatha, this time facing her.<br/>
<br/>
“As you wish,” she says with a self-satisfied grin, before reaching into the bowl of ice once more. Agatha watches with blown-out pupils as Rio takes an ice cube and brings it to her own pussy, not flinching even once.<br/>
<br/>
It isn’t until Rio starts teasing herself by brushing past her own clit with the ice, that Agatha realizes what she’s gotten herself into.<br/>
<br/>
The weirdo fucking <em>likes </em>it. Gets off on it.<br/>
<br/>
“Watch me,” Rio says, unnecessarily so, in a throaty voice. She drags the ice around her clit a couple more times before it’s small enough to insert inside herself. Rio moans loudly as Agatha watches first the ice, then her own fingers disappear inside herself.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha can’t help but whimper as a few ice cold water drops drip from Rio’s pussy onto her own.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Sit on my face, </em>Agatha helplessly thinks and she almost says it out loud as she watches the scene unfold, but she manages to turn the words into random unintelligible consonants.<br/>
<br/>
She follows Rio’s every movement, mesmerized, as the woman on top of her slowly starts to lose herself to the pleasure. Two fingers of one hand are massaging her from the inside, one finger of her other hand slips down to her clit to draw deliberate circles around it.<br/>
<br/>
“I love this feeling,” Rio breathes, her eyes fluttering shut as if she isn’t aware that she's giving Agatha the show of a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, freak. Crazy hot freak.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha knows better than to ask if she can touch her, but instead switches between glancing between Rio’s legs and keeping an eye on her face, contorting in ecstasy. Watching Rio touch herself without inhibition is addicting; to see her do all her favorite things to herself for maximum pleasure. It’s practically a case study in her body, and Agatha makes sure to save every little detail of information she learns about her.<br/>
<br/>
Every time Rio jolts, their pussies inadvertently touch each other, making Agatha more and more aware of how much she is dripping by now— and not just from melted ice water.<br/>
<br/>
Rio’s moans get pitchier as she approaches her orgasm, and Agatha isn’t sure whether she’s doing it for show or because she’s so lost in the sensation.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, f-fuck,” Rio then groans, and it sounds like something she was trying to hold back. “Gonna come,” she murmurs, her hips chasing the climax her fingers are trying to bring her. Agatha can’t do anything but stare as Rio climbs higher and higher, biting her lip, sweaty strands of hair stuck to her face, until eventually she starts shuddering and her thighs try to slam shut, trapping her own hand between them.<br/>
<br/>
When Rio, after a few deep breaths, frees her hand, it is completely soaked; partly from her own arousal, partly from the melted ice.<br/>
<br/>
“Alright, let’s get to number three, yeah?” she suggests, a little out of breath, but otherwise weirdly casual for someone who has just brought herself to orgasm on top of a very aroused, very on edge Agatha.<br/>
<br/>
Rio scoots down and reaches for the bowl of ice again, which Agatha now almost craves because of the high temperature of her own skin. Rio pops another ice cube in her mouth and without so much as a warning, lowers herself on her stomach to press the ice against Agatha’s clit.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re a <em>psychopath,” </em>Agatha accuses her through gritted teeth, but Rio continues to move the ice up and down her slit with her tongue, unperturbed. The sensation makes Agatha see stars— the combination of the freezing ice and Rio’s warm tongue have her whimpering again in seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Rio continues to tease her like that until the ice is completely gone, her lips and tongue now the only thing left to slide around Agatha’s clit.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha vaguely remembers she should be announcing her orgasm so Rio can stop in time— but if the previous two times have taught her anything, wasting an orgasm is definitely not the best feeling in the world.<br/>
<br/>
She decides to be smart; she’ll win this round by exaggerating her deep breaths and moaning just a bit higher and louder in order to convince Rio her orgasm is approaching.<br/>
<br/>
“Rio, I’m— I’m coming,” she groans, squeezing her eyes shut for show. But instead of stopping, Rio digs her fingers into Agatha’s hips to make them tilt so she can reach her ass, spanks her five times in quick succession, <em>hard, </em>pinches the skin on both sides, and rolls her back. <em><br/>
</em><em><br/>
</em><em>“Don’t lie to me,” </em>Rio growls dangerously, and gets back to sucking Agatha’s clit. </p><p><em> “Fuck,” </em> Agatha keens, the way Rio is handling her right now almost making her lose her grip on reality. How did she—<br/>
<br/>
“I know what you look like when you come.”<br/>
<br/>
“Then why make me say it?” Agatha pants as Rio works her up faster and faster. The answer doesn’t come.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, Rio leans back a little, admiring her slick cunt no doubt, and pries her open with both of her thumbs. She damn near makes heart eyes at what she sees, drops one hand to find Agatha’s opening, and slides two fingers inside while lifting her gaze to look Agatha in the eye.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha doesn’t want to give her the satisfaction of a reaction, but she can’t help but arch her back and drop her jaw— especially when Rio’s mouth lands back on her clit.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn’t take long after that for her <em> real </em> orgasm to come creeping up on her, and she is already dreading the moment she has to tell Rio to stop. She’s starting to understand how and why this is an effective punishment— or <em> consequence, </em> as Rio likes to call it.<br/>
<br/>
Making her go through this again and again is something she <em> actually </em> doesn’t like —though not a hard limit of course— causing this method to make way more sense to keep her in check than a spanking or trying her up, which is something she’d, indeed, like too much.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Rioooo,” </em> she breathes out as that familiar feeling gets stronger and stronger, almost to the point of no return. “C–co–coming!”<br/>
<br/>
She’s <em> almost </em> convinced Rio lets her have it this time, but all movements stop a fraction of a second before her orgasm would’ve taken over her entire system. It almost fucking <em> hurts. </em> Fuck that, fuck Rio.<br/>
<br/>
‘<em>Fuck you,’ </em> she wants to tell her, but Rio hits her with a: “That’s a good girl.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s limbs turn to molten wax.<br/>
<br/>
As she tries to catch her breath, she wonders what Rio is planning on doing between now and number 4, because she has no doubt her Domme will make her suffer through all of the 7 promised edging opportunities. <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> But before she can finish her thought, Rio’s mouth is back on her, swirling her tongue around Agatha’s overly sensitive clit and making her hips buck in the process. It’s not often Agatha wishes Rio was less skilled with her tongue, but today is definitely one of those days. The perfectly placed flicks in combination with the right amount of pressure against her inner wall make her chase her high again in under a minute— or maybe it had never quite calmed down from the last time.<br/>
<br/>
Rio eats her out like she’s the most delicious meal she's had, moaning and breathing into her cunt to leave no room for doubt on whether she is enjoying herself.<br/>
<br/>
Way sooner than any of the other times, Agatha feels that familiar sharp tug in her underbelly, announcing her incoming orgasm.<br/>
<br/>
“Stop,” she breathes reluctantly, now only compliant because she knows it will be over sooner this way. But Rio doesn’t hear her, or maybe she’s spoken too softly, because she isn’t slowing down her pace at all.<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Stop,” </em> Agatha hisses a bit more urgently, knowing she will explode if this goes on for just a few more seconds. “Rio, I’m serious— I’m about to— Rio—”<br/>
<br/>
Instead of stopping, Rio’s grip on her hips becomes even more tight, causing her to press her face into Agatha’s cunt even deeper. Sucking noises fill the room, and Agatha starts to panic for real, squeezing her thighs and trying to push Rio’s head away with her hands. She tenses every muscle in her body to focus on not coming, tries to think about anything but the feeling between her legs—<br/>
<br/>
“Stopstopstop,” she begs. “I’m coming Rio, fuck, you <em> have </em>to stop, I’m about to— oh, god— I’m gonna— I’m gonna—” </p><p>She lets go. There is no stopping the all-consuming wave of pleasure that takes over her mind and her body, shooting up to her brain and down to her toes like a lightning bolt, blurring the edges of her already whitening vision. The scream that tears from her throat still partially contains the effort with which she had been trying not to come, but as soon as the dam has broken, it’s all she can do to redirect the overwhelming sensation.<br/>
<br/>
She roars, now pulling Rio’s face in instead of away, grinding her hips up against Rio’s unrelenting tongue and fingers, feeling her orgasm pulse through every nerve ending in her whole body.<br/>
<br/>
She keeps coming —it must’ve been ten, fifteen seconds by now already— and she vaguely starts to worry about the guilt she should be feeling, about Rio’s wrath she is about to face.<br/>
<br/>
But then Rio starts to murmur against her clit, almost inaudibly so, seemingly completely captivated by what Agatha’s body is capable of. “<em>Such a good girl.</em>” The words are spoken with such fondness, Agatha doubts they’re just for her. <em> “What a good girl for me. Oh— my good girl.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> Agatha doesn’t get the opportunity to process those words as her orgasm finally seems to ebb away, because Rio picks her speed back up.<br/>
<br/>
“Come as many times as you want, my love,” Rio offers before scraping her teeth against Agatha’s clit, sending her straight into her second screaming orgasm. And when that one starts to fade, Rio adds another finger and gets right to pumping a third one out of her.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha’s throat starts to hurt and any control over her own limbs slowly leaves her body, well aware she’s being completely wrecked on purpose after having held off for so long. Rio keeps whispering sweet praises as she tries to prolong Agatha’s climaxes to a point where her body doesn’t even have the energy to spasm anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Her fourth and fifth orgasm kind of blur together, and maybe there’s a sixth, but she can’t be quite sure— after which Rio finally plants a sloppy kiss on her mound before pulling away from Agatha’s buzzing, massively overstimulated pussy.<br/>
<br/>
Rio crawls her way up to level her face with Agatha’s, who finally has the opportunity to check in with her body, which is ostensibly still on the bed but feels like it’s hovering a few inches above the mattress. Her skin tingles, her pulse is everywhere— and when she focuses on her face, she notices a lazy smile that she’s quite sure she hadn’t left there.<br/>
<br/>
Rio doesn’t say anything, just showers her collarbones, her shoulders, and her jaw in chaste kisses.<br/>
<br/>
<em> Point made, </em> Agatha thinks as she wiggles her hips and pulls her knees up in an attempt to feel more comfortable. There’s a light, carefree feeling in her head and a need to pull Rio in, squeeze her until she suffocates— a feeling very comparable to MDMA, <em> if </em>Agatha’s allowed to take an educated guess on what that would hypothetically feel like. </p><p>“What do you need?” Rio eventually asks her, sweetly tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.<br/>
<br/>
And Agatha, too fucked out to be difficult about it, says: “I need you to hold me and I need you to shut the fuck up about it.” She rolls to the side and tucks her head into Rio’s neck as Rio’s arms slowly find their way around her waist.<br/>
<br/>
Agatha feels Rio inhale with intention, but is quick to say: “I mean it, Rio. Not a word.”<br/>
<br/>
That intimidating statement falls dead when Rio lightly tickles the hair on the back of Agatha’s neck and a muffled squeal sounds against Rio’s skin.<br/>
<br/>
“Can you give me your color?” Rio decides to ask.<br/>
<br/>
“Do I look anything but green?” Agatha sighs. “What about you?”<br/>
<br/>
She can feel Rio’s smile against her temple. “Very green. Like, neon.”<br/>
<br/>
And to prevent Rio from taking the opportunity to ask about what her experience was like, because her scrambled brain isn’t going to touch that until at least next week, she quips: “Oh I know. You had the best time ever. You called me <em>my love.” </em> <em><br/>
</em> <em><br/>
</em> She hadn’t wanted to bring that up, but apparently, any connection between her body, brain, and mouth had been fucked out of her.<br/>
<br/>
“I didn’t,” Rio simply says, making Agatha stiffen and blink. She had expected Rio to have another cool and collected answer to that, to at least own it, to maybe even turn it into one of her wildly frustrating teaching moments again, but… not to flat out deny it.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes you did,” Agatha says in surprise, taking her face out of Rio’s neck and looking up at her to see if she’s serious.<br/>
<br/>
Rio is putting a lot of effort into not looking at her. “Did not.”<br/>
<br/>
Well. <em> That’s </em> interesting.<br/>
<br/>
“Did. Are you telling me I’m lying?”<br/>
