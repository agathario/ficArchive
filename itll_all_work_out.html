<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s the first frigid day of the season and the whole world is under a filter of gray. Bare trees, dead lawns, a thick frost over car windows. The kind of cold that leaves you aching for the scent of heat off an old radiator– or to sit in the bath until you’re half drowned.</p><p>It’s a comfort for Rio. She feels the bone deep chill covering her like a blanket. If cold is only an absence of warmth, she believes she may be cold personified.</p><p>She waits by her bedroom window, staring out at the bare trees and blotting out her plum lipstick with her finger. Rio is strangely particular about how things look. Not too opaque, she likes to blur the edges.</p><p>Turning, she studies her reflection for a moment. Her mirror stands in the corner, the frame made of iron branches and leaves. It was a gift. The first of many, as it became, and still her most favorite. She imagines it as a portal she could step through, where she would walk the world infinitely and forever, flowers growing at her feet and all the dead to greet her.</p><p>To be loved is to be seen and all that.</p><p>Rio shrugs on her oversized leather jacket, the stripes on her shirt peeking out from the ends of the sleeves. She has several dainty silver rings she kept from her mother’s jewelry box on her fingers, and her nails are painted a shiny dark purple. Jen will insist they look black, and Rio– as always– will insist they aren’t. It’s a fun little game they play.</p><p>Rio is not awfully concerned with her appearance, but there’s something about the ritual of it all. It’s a soothing activity, becoming the mask she allows the world to see each morning before breakfast.</p><p>She ties up her boots and grabs her bag, the scent of warm cinnamon guiding her down the curved staircase and into the kitchen.</p><p>On the cherry wood table by the window, there’s a porcelain plate with a bowl of hot cereal, a soft boiled egg, and a thick slice of sourdough toast with a layer of raspberry preserves waiting for her.</p><p><em>Oh God</em>, Rio thinks. <em>Lilia is buttering me up.</em></p><p>She knows this move. Whenever Lilia is sitting on treacherous information, normal everyday life becomes closer to living in a fully staffed palace. And then it all takes a sharp turn and Rio is being served up a steaming hot plate of “you’ve got to toughen up”.</p><p>It doesn’t escape her that the first couple of months of the school year had gone by relatively smoothly. There were certainly a few external factors contributing, but Rio really feels like she’s been in a groove. Her grades are good, cross country ended without injury, and she’s only had three detentions so far. All definite wins.</p><p>Whatever this is about, Rio must be terribly, blissfully ignorant of it. She savors the feeling.</p><p>Sighing, Rio decides to eat the meal anyway. She makes it through half an episode of Northern Exposure by the time she’s done and rinses her plate in the sink, turning off the ancient tv box on the shelf.</p><p>Limits are most definitely being pushed with how long she’s taking to get going, but as soon as she steps outside she decides she may as well take her time.</p><p>Her car is covered in frost, and it’s the annoying kind that does better with melting than it does scraping, so she pries the frozen door open and twists the key in the ignition. It turns once, twice, three times before sputtering and dying, a puff of gray smoke escaping the hood and dissipating into the frozen air.</p><p>
<em>No fucking way.</em>
</p><p>Rio suddenly fears her weekly astrological chart report from Jen. Something tells her it’s about to be a doozy.</p><p>She gets out of the car, slamming the door shut as hard as she can to distract the growing anxiety in her chest. She’s had this twenty-year-old Subaru since she got her license just over a year ago, and it’s starting to feel like whatever the poor thing is going through, it’s terminal.</p><p>Rio lifts the hood and notices something must be burning. Is there a leak? The smell is abhorrent. Her eyes are burning and she thinks it’s the smoke, but soon realizes the tears pooling are probably connected to the ache in her chest.</p><p>She does not have the money to deal with this right now. This is her senior year, every cent she’s saved has to go toward whatever comes next after she graduates. Not her burnt out clunker of a car.</p><p>Luckily, the silver lining of the situation is she lives so far out of town that no one will hear when she lets out a guttural scream.</p><p>“Why not just FUCKING KILL ME!”</p><p>A flock of birds flee the trees at her cry, and Rio is feeling irritatingly helpless.</p><p>She knows she has to call someone, but the idea makes her shrink. It’s times like these she’s thankful there’s one person who will gladly help without saying two words about it.</p><p>“Hey, what’s up?”</p><p>Rio sighs in relief when Alice picks up. They’ve been friends since freshman year, and Rio has come to know Alice as possibly the chillest girl on earth. And most reliable.</p><p>“Thank God,” Rio says.</p><p>“Just me, actually.”</p><p>“Ha Ha. Listen, I need a huge favor,” Rio starts, “will you skip first period to come pick me up?”</p><p>She stresses while waiting the two seconds it takes for Alice to answer.</p><p>“Sure. I was praying for an excuse to miss Mr. Litman’s lecture, anyway,” she says. “What happened, is it your car?”</p><p>Rio explains the situation, omitting the dramatics, and thanks Alice profusely for loving Rio more than the industrial revolution. Not that it was much of a competition.</p><p>She sits in the warmth of the house while she waits. She probably could have made it through the rest of the episode of Northern Exposure by the time the familiar black jeep pulls up to the driveway, but Rio chose to sit painfully with her thoughts instead. Typically, she waits until late into the evening for that.</p><p>Rio shakes out her hands, as if her thoughts can travel from her brain to her fingertips and fall right out. It’s a strange little compulsion she can’t help doing. Unfortunately, it works well enough she’s unsure she’ll ever stop.</p><p>Just before jumping into the passenger seat of Alice’s car, her phone vibrates. Rio hesitantly checks the screen.</p><p>
<strong>Lilia</strong>
<br/>
<em>Why are you not at school?</em>
</p><p>Fucking hell.</p><p>
<strong>Rio</strong>
<br/>
<em>omw now. alice had to pick me up, car broke down.</em>
</p><p>She doesn’t get an answer back the whole way there, and it makes her kind of nervous.</p><p>Lilia is many things. She runs the school theatre club, acts as head of the Arts Department, teaches three choir classes, and is also Rio’s legal guardian. All of those things are impressive enough as it is, but on top of it Lilia Calderu is literally a psychic.</p><p>Okay, not literally. But she has an uncanny talent for seeing things others don’t and always being ten steps ahead. She predicts Rio’s moods, the weather, whether or not there’s going to be an outbreak of the flu on school campus by the next week. Maybe those things seem mild, but when it’s happening all of the time, it starts to get weird.</p><p>And now, Rio wonders if she’s picking up some of Lilia’s strange predispositions. After this morning, her misfortunes feel weighted, like they mean something. It’s hard to ignore the obvious shift in the air.</p><p>Rio gazes out the car window at the passing trees. She’s aware of Alice ranting on about her parents, but her voice is only a distant ringing as Rio’s thoughts travel from her kitchen floor and back through her ears. They whisper to her like a prophecy.</p><p>Something is coming. Perhaps it’s already here.</p><hr/><p>The next bell has already rung by the time they get there, but Rio spends her second period grading papers for Lilia on Mondays, so she’s either off the hook or about to get her ass chewed. She’s not sure which possibility will better soothe the whirling in her stomach.</p><p>Bidding Alice goodbye, Rio heads down the deserted left corridor that leads to the theatre. The walls of this hallway are covered in various portraits of students and staff, small plaques of their musical and theatrical accomplishments at the bottoms of the frames.</p><p>This school has something of a reputation. Many years ago, some very rich lady with a taste for art and luxury put her entire fortune into the school’s arts department before she died. She’d lived here all her life and wanted something good to come out of this sad little town.</p><p>It’s thanks to her that masters in their craft like Lilia Calderu were brought in, and many students have gone on to accomplish genuinely impressive things. Only now, Lilia is the last of the teachers initially hired, and the arts department has gotten along as best it can with the little resources it now has.</p><p>So much of the credit for that can be given to Lilia, who’s spent the better part of thirty years shaping teenagers into well-rounded grown people. She’s battled the big guns of athletics to keep her donated money, as many arts classes as they can afford, and put on yearly shows.</p><p>It’s knowing this that calms Rio as she steps into the Choir room near the end of the hall. Rio may not sing, she may not act, but Lilia Calderu has taken it upon herself to be everything for her– from teacher to costume designer. That remarkable woman’s careful fingers have sewn her together, neat stitches remaining where all her stuffing had fallen out.</p><p>Rio holds onto this thought as she faces impending doom.</p><p>“Hey,” she says timidly. Lilia is seated at her desk, her reading glasses perched on the edge of her nose as she concentrates on the screen of her computer.</p><p>“Oh! Wonderful, you made it. Did you thank Alice?” Lilia looks at Rio over golden frames, her lips pursed.</p><p>“Of course I did.”</p><p>Rio is starting to notice the unease creeping back in. It’s making her feel defensive.</p><p>“Good. I called Tony about your car. He should be towing it now.”</p><p>“Oh, my God. I told you not to!”</p><p>Rio is getting sick of this game. She knows the other shoe will drop and these little favors are to cushion the blow. It feels like Rio is sitting in a giant cauldron with celery and carrots, the temperature rising ever so slowly.</p><p>“I heard,” Lilia says, unimpressed, “but you and I both know that if I let you take care of it, that piece of junk will sit useless in the driveway for months. I did you a favor.”</p><p>“Well, don’t.”</p><p>Rio drops her bag next to the corduroy bean bag chair in the corner and lets herself sink, pulling her knees up to her chest. She knows she’s throwing a tantrum and that it isn’t a good look, but she feels like she’s on fire. Sometimes her emotions come to her like that. Loud and bursting and sudden.</p><p>“Rio-”</p><p>“Just spit it out,” Rio says, quieter now. “Whatever it is, I just want you to say it.”</p><p>There’s silence. Rio is staring blankly at the far window where a dead branch is tapping at the glass. She has no interest in trying to figure out what Lilia is thinking. She’d rather melt into this chair and stay there, dormant, until spring. Like the trees.</p><p>“It’s Agatha,” Lilia says.</p><p>“Harkness?”</p><p>“How many seventeen-year-old Agathas do you know?”</p><p>Rio swallows.</p><p>“What, is she dead?” She asks. She runs her fingers over the corduroy.</p><p>“No, Rio. She’s back to finish her senior year. I didn’t know until early this morning.”</p><p>That explains the breakfast. Rio imagines Lilia, half awake and drinking black coffee and opening an email announcing Agatha Harkness’s return after a year long stay at Salem’s School for Troubled Girls.</p><p>No one knows why she had to go, but Agatha was always difficult. A difficult student, a difficult daughter, a difficult friend. It’s also no secret that her mother, Evanora, is an evil woman who would probably send her own daughter away to torture camp for just about any petty reason.</p><p>Rio feels a tug of annoyance at the fact that Lilia has the foresight to believe she would care about this at all. She hasn’t been Agatha’s friend for almost four years. In fact, they have done a very good and honest job at pretending the other does not exist.</p><p>Sure, things got weird when Rio heard she was being sent away. It’s definitely possible that her weirdness did not go unnoticed. She simply blamed that fact on Agatha herself.</p><p>Agatha has always been very popular. She’s intimidating, but also incredibly magnetic. Everyone wants to know her, follow her, become her. Rio had a front row seat for this in middle school, back when they were friends. Agatha would reel people in, only to spit them back out.</p><p>So, naturally, there was always going to be interest in anything anyone does in relation to Agatha Harkness.</p><p>There were rumors about her and Rio from people who attended the same middle school, but nothing ever gained enough traction to garner attention. Rio is a weird, isolated girl with few friends. No one even knows Ms. Calderu is her adoptive fairy godmother, as Rio calls her.</p><p>In other words, Agatha was sent away and Rio went full basket case. The rumors resurfaced, interest sparked, and Rio finally had to tell Lilia the whole story. It’s only her and Jen that know. Alice is aware of her friendship with Agatha, but Rio has yet to tell her the rest.</p><p>After all, it’s not a very nice story.</p><p>Rio loses herself in the soothing texture of the chair, the tips of her fingers starting to go strangely numb. She knows that at some point today she will probably have to face Agatha. Maybe she’ll see her in the halls, or in class. Maybe it will be AP Biology or Creative Writing. Maybe they’ll be in the bathroom at the same time and Rio will come out of her stall to find Agatha retouching her makeup.</p><p>The possibilities make her sweat.</p><p>She’s not afraid of Agatha. Some people most definitely are, but Rio finds her very predictable. Everything Agatha does is to protect herself. It isn’t her fault, not really, but she can’t ever be trusted. She can’t ever be too close. It’s best that way.</p><p>“How are you feeling about this?” Lilia’s voice breaks through the mess of thoughts tangling in Rio’s head.</p><p>“I’m not.” Rio pauses, rephrasing, “I don’t feel anything about it.”</p><p>She knows it’s an obvious lie, but part of her wants to see what Lilia does.</p><p>She gets up and walks over to Rio with a stack of papers, a grading sheet, and a red pen.</p><p>“Here,” she says, handing over the pile. “Grade these. I won’t have the time tonight when we’re busy baking cookies and watching The Craft.”</p><p>Rio smiles, just barely. The Craft is her favorite movie.</p><hr/><p>Jen is a good friend. Rio swears it. Even when she’s making fun or pushing too far, Rio trusts few others with the things she trusts with Jen. It’s like having a little secret, in a way. The Jen everyone knows is cool, vain, detached– but when she’s with Rio she’s drunk and dancing in her room, making up wild theories in the back of the movie theater, and scheming.</p><p>Hell, she wears a badly made friendship bracelet everyday just because Rio gave it to her. Rio does not deserve her, maybe no one does. She’s just happy she has her, especially now.</p><p>“Everyone would fuck Cate Blanchett, that’s an awful answer.”</p><p>“Fine. Natasha Lyonne in Russian Doll.”</p><p>“You don’t get this at all, do you?”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. Jen has been distracting her all morning with little games and unethical gossip about teachers. Rio can only give about fifty percent, but Jen doesn’t care. She talks, Rio gives short answers, and if Jen starts to notice that telltale glaze over Rio’s eyes, she gets her talking about hot older women. Works like a charm.</p><p>There’s only so much she can do, however, because it’s lunch hour and soon Rio will have to face the music. She hasn’t seen Agatha once so far, and unless she’s eating her lunch in the bathroom stalls, now will be the moment.</p><p>Rio takes a second to be eternally grateful for Jennifer Kale for working her magic.</p><p>The whispers go on around them, but in their little world everything remains the same.</p><p>It can’t last forever.</p><p>“C’mon, it’s Pasta Monday,” Jen says, urging her through the doors and toward the line. Rio takes a deep breath and tries to center herself around the Rigatoni she’ll be eating in the next five minutes. If anything can distract her it’s vodka sauce and parmesan.</p><p>They sit at their usual table and Rio is perched on her seat, leather jacket cushioning her. Lunch is the only good thing about Mondays, since it’s always a different kind of pasta. Her and Jen live for it. Rio is mid-bite, wondering when she’ll see Alice, when the yelling begins.</p><p>At first it’s hard to hear, but the offenders get closer and the words clearer.</p><p>“You can tell your mother that if she thinks she has any power over me or my life, she can burn in hell with the rest of you!”</p><p>Everyone pauses their chewing to peer past the cafeteria doors and see who’s putting on a show. Except Rio would know that voice anywhere.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, I am going to-” marching into the large and echoing room is a member of the cheer squad, lovingly nicknamed the Salem Seven by the student body, following Agatha as she stomps away from her.</p><p>Agatha spins to look at the cheerleader.</p><p>“Get the fuck out of my face?” She fires.</p><p>Unlucky for her, Mrs. Davis hears the whole thing from her position by the doors.</p><p>“Miss Harkness, you’ll be seeing me for detention. Miss Anderson, please respect the boundaries of other students, please and thank you!”</p><p>Agatha lets out an angry sound from the depths of her chest and turns to walk away, right in the direction of Rio’s table.</p><p>It’s happening in slow motion. Rio is looking up, catching those striking blue eyes with hers, and Agatha is quickly realizing her mistake. There’s a moment in time, perhaps half a second, where they look at each other. Rio recognizes how different Agatha seems. Her hair is darker, her nails longer, and every little thing about her is positively deadly.</p><p>It’s like she’s been hollowed out, the bright power she usually carries replaced with a thick black smoke.</p><p>Rio’s skin burns.</p><p>Just as quickly as it came, the moment is up.</p><p>Coming to meet Agatha at her side is Natasha Romanov, her one and only close friend. Natasha is a deeply talented and disciplined dancer, and has charisma likened to a venomous spider.</p><p>They make sense together, really. While Agatha is calculated and insane, Natasha is calculated and calm. Agatha can go around raising hell and Natasha will sweet talk the authorities to get her out of trouble. Then you’ll find them both at Scratchy’s Cafe studying for extra credit after two hours of extracurriculars. It’s lethal.</p><p>“Staying very chill and under the radar, I see,” Natasha says, a scolding look on her face. Agatha tears her eyes from Rio’s and laughs bitterly.</p><p>“Whatever,” Agatha mumbles, “come on, I’m starving.”</p><p>With that, they’re walking away and Rio stares after them, those waves of deep brown hair on Agatha’s hot head flowing in her wake.</p><p>She cannot help it, but the squeeze of her heart feels achingly familiar. She knows that once it eases, left behind will be the imprints of Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>Dusty, black. Like the smoke that fills her.</p>

<p>It’s finally snowing. Two weeks have passed, Thanksgiving is over, and it’s snowing.</p><p>Rio looks out the choir room window and watches clumps of sparkling snowflakes fall from the sky, forming a clean white blanket on the ground. It’s somewhat overdue, she thinks. Every year she waits patiently for the first snow, yearning for the nostalgia of running outside in a snowsuit to make angels.</p><p>There was a time, early on, when childhood was gentle like that. All wonder and play. Before she was subject to foster home after foster home, encountering new forms of neglect at every turn. It’s not supposed to be like that when you’re little.</p><p>It’s not supposed to be like that, ever.</p><p>Rio always feels extra exposed during the holidays, like all her deep dark secrets decide to come out and play. It doesn’t help that Agatha is back, taunting Rio just by existing nearby. Rio finally got so sick of thinking about it that she asked for distractions, which is how she ended up here.</p><p>Lilia had the idea, and Rio thinks it may have been in vain. Each year there’s this big Arts Christmas Festival the entire arts department puts on. It’s a very big thing in this town. The students perform a variety show with dancing, music, and a classic Christmas story.</p><p>On top of that, there’s food, games, and usually a showing of a movie. It’s huge and time consuming and the preparation begins months in advance.</p><p>This is the first year Rio will be participating, and also the first year the budget is practically nothing. Lilia has decided to turn the whole thing into a student-led DIY extra credit project.</p><p>Which is the reason for today’s meeting. All the students involved are gathering to discuss responsibilities for the festival. The decorations will have to be handmade along with sets for the show. Food will now be provided by student’s and teacher’s families.</p><p>Rio would typically rather chew her own foot off than do anything like this, but desperate times or whatever.</p><p>Jen comes in, trailed by another small group of theatre kids excitedly chatting. Rio recognizes some of their faces. One is Yelena Romonov, Natasha’s younger sister. With her are two of her friends, Kate Bishop and Billy Kaplan. They’re sophomores and way too enthusiastic about all this. Rio remembers them in October, huddled around the casting list for the variety show, practically buzzing.</p><p>It’s nice to see, she supposes, since things have been so bleak lately. This school has really taken a turn for the worse with its newfound interest in athletics. It’s a tale as old as time.</p><p>“Hey, are you excited?” Jen asks, sitting beside Rio in the adjacent beanbag.</p><p>“Oh, yeah. This is my dream.”</p><p>Jen rolls her eyes. “Please, if you weren’t here you’d be sitting on the floor in the hallway half asleep waiting for it to end.” It’s true. Rio’s car is still out of order, which means she’s at the mercy of Lilia’s schedule.</p><p>“So? Larry stopped letting me nap in the janitor’s closet.”</p><p>More students pile in. Amongst them are Natasha and Wanda Maximoff. Natasha is speaking in a hushed voice while Wanda listens, blushing and giggling. God, they’ve been flirting since last year. Rio wishes they’d just fucking scissor already.</p><p>Lilia comes out of her office and stands at the front of the room. Rio sinks into her beanbag chair and barely suppresses a groan. She can’t believe she’s been dragged into this.</p><p>“Welcome everybody! It’s good to see so many faces here today,” Lilia begins.</p><p>Rio tries her best not to let her thoughts wander as Lilia explains the situation. She’s heard all about this already, anyway. She’s just waiting for groups to be called so she can find whatever poor unfortunate souls will be stuck with her.</p><p>After at least twenty minutes of pain and suffering, eventually, they get there.</p><p>“Cafeteria decorating will be Natasha, Kate, and Yelena.”</p><p>Rio sees Natasha rolling her eyes, no doubt both amused and annoyed at having to team up with her little sister and her friend. Next, Jen gets grouped with three juniors for gymnasium games. Rio winces for her.</p><p>“Movie set up will be Billy and Rio.”</p><p>Great. The chatty, bubbly one. At least his piercings are cool.</p><p>Once every group is called, they’re instructed to get together and make a plan. Setup will begin Wednesday and go through Friday– Lock-In day. Apparently it’s tradition to lock all the students and supervisors in the school overnight before the day of the festival to decorate and “bond”.</p><p>Rio is already imagining all the damage she could do in a whole night.</p><p>“Oh God. Rio–” Jen whispers, eyes wide.</p><p>Did she say that out loud? “What? I didn’t do anything.”</p><p>“Look.”</p><p>Rio does.</p><p>Coming in the door is, of course, Agatha.</p><p>She’s glancing around, barely hiding her judgement.</p><p>“Miss Harkness, can I help you?” Lilia asks.</p><p>“Oh, yes, I’ve come to help.” Agatha has a very wide, very fake smile on her face.</p><p>“Ah, you’ve heard about the extra credit.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, choir is the only class I transferred with a failing grade, so. I need it.”</p><p>Rio takes sudden interest in her nails. They’re starting to chip, she should really repaint them soon. Maybe a green, you know, for Christmas.</p><p>“Right,” Lilia says, returning the fake smile. “I suppose I can fit you in with the movie team.”</p><p>Jen sucks in a breath beside her, and it’s all it takes for Rio to process what her kind and loving guardian has just done. Grouped her up with the one person in this school who hates her guts.</p><p>“Wonderful!” Agatha says. Natasha is smirking in the corner.</p><p>“Talk to Billy, he’ll fill you in.”</p><p>Billy looks up, his expression like a trapped animal. Rio swears his ears curl back.</p><p>“Sure,” he whimpers. Agatha looks far too satisfied with herself.</p><p>Once the meeting is adjourned, everyone gets up to discuss with their groups. Rio grabs Jen’s arm and looks at her, pleading.</p><p>“Please, this is how I die,” she says.</p><p>“This is beyond my control, babe,” Jen says gently.</p><p>Rio gapes at her as she walks off toward her group. In fact, she’s still slack jawed when she sees Billy out of the corner of her eye. He’s speaking with Agatha, whose face is devoid of any kind of emotion. Then, there’s a gesture to Rio, and they turn to approach her.</p><p>Now she’s the one feeling like a trapped animal.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, right?” Billy asks, still bubbling with positivity despite his nervous twitching.</p><p>“Um, yeah.” Her lips are turning raw from excessive biting.</p><p>“Great! We were thinking of going to Scratchy’s to talk about what to do for the movie. You down?”</p><p>Rio glances at Agatha, who is currently inspecting the crown molding above their heads.</p><p>“Sure.” She tries to sound as indifferent as possible, but her voice shakes. Billy, thankfully, is too clueless for it to matter and offers to drive.</p><hr/><p>Agatha insists on driving herself, so it’s just Rio that gets stuck in Billy’s passenger seat listening to him rave about some kid on the football team he’s into the whole way there.</p><p>Downtown on a Monday is pretty quiet in this town, but Scratchy’s is never really empty. The cafe is on a street corner and occupies the two bottom floors of an old brick building with large windows. The bottom floor has the coffee bar and kitchen, a few tables and some booths along the wall. The top is more loungy. There are leather chairs and sofas and large bookshelves.</p><p>The whole place has a sort of 90’s witchy vibe with stained glass lampshades and dark wood furniture. It attracts a lot of tourists who wander outside their visit to Salem to get pictures under the black cat logo.</p><p>Rio and Billy walk in and pick a table near the coffee bar, ordering two cappuccinos in ceramic mugs. They already get them by the time Agatha arrives. She goes to sit on a stool two feet away instead of at the table, and Rio subtly rolls her eyes.</p><p>“You’re not going to sit with us?” Billy asks. Agatha doesn’t respond, busy looking at the comics on the newspaper left on the counter.</p><p>“Okay…” Billy says, opening his notebook and clicking a pen. “Well, what family friendly Christmas movie ideas do you guys have?”</p><p>Rio smirks. “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas?”</p><p>Agatha makes the slightest of faces at that, and Rio feels a wave of satisfaction.</p><p>“Uh, is that even a Christmas movie?” Billy asks.</p><p>“Excuse me? Dolly Parton! Hard Candy Christmas!” Rio exclaims.</p><p>“Okay, moving on,” Billy sighs. He’s getting burnt out already, Rio can feel it.</p><p>They discuss their options, trying to be mindful of rating and runtime, until their mugs are empty. Agatha does absolutely nothing to contribute to the conversation except to occasionally veto Billy’s suggestions.</p><p>God, we’ll be here forever, Rio thinks.</p><p>An hour has passed when they finally decide on an animated double feature: A Charlie Brown Christmas and The Grinch (the original, of course). Predictable, but also a guaranteed success. In this case, it's necessary to appeal to the masses.</p><p>Rio gets another cappuccino and they discuss the setup.</p><p>“We get to use the mini theatre, so we should put up a poster by the ticket booth,” Billy suggests.</p><p>The mini theatre is a second, much smaller theatre they built during an expansion. It was once used for smaller recitals when they offered a larger variety of music classes, but now it sits empty until there’s some kind of event that requires extra space, like hosting drama meets or music festivals.</p><p>It’s perfect for a movie showing, since there’s a small ticket booth at the entrance.</p><p>“It would have to be two posters,” Rio says.</p><p>Billy ponders for a minute. Agatha is resting her chin on her hand, looking half asleep. Her eyelashes are fluttering.</p><p>“It would be cool to do an actual, movie theater sized poster. Can you draw? I won’t have time between this and the variety show.” Billy groans, face in his hands, “Ugh, we only have a week.”</p><p>Then something happens. Rio malfunctions, her software failing her. She doesn’t even know why she says it. The words just fill her mouth, pouring out when she parts her lips.</p><p>“Agatha can do it.”</p><p>Oh, god. Oh god, oh god.</p><p>For a few moments, no one speaks. Everything is quiet, save for the faint melody of Fiona Apple’s Frosty the Snowman over the Cafe speakers. Rio’s palms are wet, her neck straining with the effort it takes to avoid looking at Agatha.</p><p>Billy speaks up first.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha hums, suddenly interested in her newspaper again.</p><p>“Can you make the poster?”</p><p>She finally looks up, giving a sharp laugh. “Oh, no. I don’t draw.”</p><p>Now it’s Rio’s turn to laugh.</p><p>She thinks of the summer days spent in Agatha’s backyard, Rio making potions in the birdbath while Agatha drew the birds. She thinks of Agatha’s sketchbooks and the hundreds of pages filled with original artwork. She thinks of the eighth grade art show, right after The Thing happened, when she stood in front of a dozen of Agatha’s sketches and paintings for hours until the teacher told her she had to go home.</p><p>“Yes, you do,” Rio says, eyes anywhere but on her.</p><p>“What was that?” Agatha asks with feigned confusion. “Huh. Weird.”</p><p>Billy looks at her and then Rio. “Sorry, am I missing something?”</p><p>“I said,” Rio starts, aiming her words directly at Agatha, “you can draw.”</p><p>She turns to Billy. “She’s very good, actually.”</p><p>The silence becomes heavy. There’s a moment where Rio thinks something very, very bad might happen. Luckily, Billy cannot handle any awkward silence whatsoever.</p><p>“Great! Agatha is on poster duty,” he says.</p><p>“Hold on,” Agatha pipes up, finally putting down that goddamn newspaper, “I am most certainly not on poster duty!”</p><p>“Okay, well, someone has to do it and you have done nothing so far.”</p><p>Rio winces, hoping Billy understands the territory he’s just entered.</p><p>“Excuse me? I believe I was the one to suggest we come here,” Agatha argues.</p><p>“Yeah, and then you sat at the bar and pretended to read the newspaper while we made all the decisions. The least you can do is make a fucking poster!”</p><p>Rio whistles, raising her eyebrows in horrified anticipation. Poor, poor billy.</p><p>“Listen, I don’t know what your deal is, but I did not come here to be yelled at by a scrawny sophomore theatre kid who takes fashion inspiration from Rodrick Hefley,” Agatha fires.</p><p>“Okay, ouch,” Billy says, a hand on his chest. “I just think if you have the talent, you may as well use it. After all, you’re kind of losing relevance, Agatha.”</p><p>It happens in an instant. Rio watches in horror and amusement as Agatha walks to the end of the coffee bar, takes a full glass of iced coffee from a guy in a suit, and proceeds to pour the entire thing down Billy’s shirt.</p><p>He gasps, standing up and pulling the shirt away from him, several ice cubes dropping to the floor. Agatha lets go of the glass and it shatters at Billy’s feet. While the cafe is practically desolate, the barista and the man at the bar take notice of the scene.</p><p>The silence is deafening. Rio freezes, unsure what her next move should be, when Agatha has already decided her own.</p><p>Just as the barista comes out with a rag, shocked and flustered, Agatha grabs her bag and walks out, bells ringing as the door swings.</p><hr/><p>The video store is having a remarkably slow Tuesday.</p><p>Rio is behind the counter watching The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas on a TV smaller than the one she has at home in her kitchen. After yesterday it’s been on her mind, amongst other things, but she can’t do anything about those things so she’s doing something about this one.</p><p>She works here three days a week, but this week it’s only one, thanks to the festival. Tuesdays are her short day, only four classes and she’s home free. That’s about three extra hours to earn some money by sitting on her ass and watching movies. Sure, on a normal day she actually rents them out, but today?</p><p>Today she can let her eyes glaze over and get lost in Dolly Parton’s big b- hair. Her hair.</p><p>Rio is awoken from her dissociative state by the door opening and letting in a rush of frozen air.</p><p>“Welcome in, let me know if you need anything,” she says automatically, eyes still on the movie.</p><p>Rio jolts as a hand slams down on the counter, lifting to reveal a sheet of paper with a drawing on it. She hesitantly looks up.</p><p>It’s Agatha.</p><p>“The kid said I needed to run this by you,” she’s saying. Rio feels the stool digging into her thighs. “I couldn’t find you at school so I asked your friend. What’s her name? Jan?”</p><p>Rio stares at her, realizing her fingers are gripping the counter so hard they’re going white.</p><p>“It’s Jen. What?” She asks dumbly.</p><p>“Please, I know you heard me.”</p><p>Rio studies her. Agatha’s hair looks rather nice today, like she did her whole hair routine to get pristine dark waves, shiny and long. Her face is pink from the cold and she has a purple scarf around her neck. Her blue eyes are piercing.</p><p>“Uh, yeah, I mean what’s this for?” Rio asks, her voice hoarse.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes and gestures down at the drawing. It’s a rough sketch of the double feature poster for the festival. It’s excellently crafted, for a sketch. Rio’s mouth opens and closes like a fish.</p><p>“I thought you didn’t want to do this,” she says softly.</p><p>Agatha looks around uncomfortably, pulling at her scarf. “Yeah, well. I felt bad, so.”</p><p>“You did?”</p><p>“Yeah, whatever, God,” Agatha says, exasperated, “just tell me what you think so I can make the damn thing.”</p><p>“Do you even care?” Rio asks. Agatha groans, licking her lips in annoyance. It’s a habit she has.</p><p>“Listen, if you aren’t going to-”</p><p>Rio interrupts her. “It’s fine," she says. "Perfect, actually." The sketch has a scene from each movie diagonal to each other in blurry bubbles like something out of a children’s book. Opposite each picture is the title of the film. The bottom says ‘A Double Feature’ in simple cursive writing.</p><p>Agatha looks at her, huffing a little. Her eyes are stony and her mouth is pressed tight.</p><p>“Great!” She says, giving Rio the fakest of smiles and grabbing the drawing from the counter. “It’ll be done in two days.”</p><p>Rio, once again, watches as she leaves.</p><hr/><p>“That’s so weird,” Jen says, her voice muffled over the phone.</p><p>“I know. I honestly thought she’d give me the silent treatment until it’s over.”</p><p>Jen hums. Rio is laying on the floor, a pillow to cushion her head from the hardwood. The radiator on the far wall bubbles, and Rio shivers with the contrast of the heat and the freezing breeze coming in from her open window. God, she loves winter.</p><p>“So…” she starts, trying to sound casual, “you told Agatha where I work?”</p><p>Jen immediately cracks up with laughter. “Was I not supposed to?” She asks coyly. Rio sighs heavily, hoping Jen picks up on her subtle indignation. It’s common for Jen to be annoying or pushy, but it's less common for her to actually piss Rio the fuck off.</p><p>Ever since yesterday everyone has been acting like Agatha being a new-old side character in Rio’s life is normal. Like it’s amusing, even. Rio feels like she’s going nuts with it. Have they forgotten what happened? No, maybe not. Maybe Rio has been too calm in her retelling. Too detached.</p><p>If Rio has a soul, it’s got a thick scar on it. And it’s giving her phantom pains.</p><p>“She was my very best friend, you know,” Rio says softly.</p><p>At first, Jen is quiet. She’s heard the story, but never about the depth of what led up to it. Rio supposes that’s like skipping to the last chapter and expecting the reader to understand the whole book.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?” Jen asks, gentler now.</p><p>Rio’s fingers are getting slippery where she holds her phone. “Maybe.”</p><p>She takes a moment to remember it all. They were so young when they met, and still so young when it was all over. In some ways, Rio feels like she was Agatha’s imaginary friend, severed from reality and left in a world unseen when it was time to grow up.</p><p>Except that’s not what happened. Rio broke the tether.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she tells Jen, “It’s just weird, that’s all.”</p><hr/><p>Wednesday passes and Agatha is nowhere to be seen. Rio says nothing about it to anyone but Billy, who approaches her first in the hall on Thursday.</p><p>“Hey, have you seen Agatha? I wanted to ask her about the poster,” he asks. Rio just shakes her head, shoving a pile of notebooks in her bag.</p><p>“I don’t know if you figured this out or not, but Agatha hates me.”</p><p>“I thought she just thinks she’s too good for you,” Billy says, somewhat confused. Rio laughs coldly.</p><p>“Well, that’s also true.”</p><p>Rio walks down the hall, Billy shadowing her, looking for Jen and Alice.</p><p>“So, what's the story there?” Billy asks. Rio is about to answer, albeit evasively, when she sees her friends standing by the lockers where the hall veers to the right.</p><p>“Hold on,” Rio says to Billy, moving toward them.</p><p>It’s then that she realizes something is going on just around the corner. Everyone in the hallway is stopped, staring down at a scene happening toward the stairs.</p><p>“I think we found Agatha,” Billy whispers. Rio follows the sea of eyes to that long, dark wavy hair. Agatha is wearing a purple sweater, a black mini skirt, stockings, and mary janes today. She’s especially made up, like she has someone to impress.</p><p>Does she?</p><p>Rio can’t focus. Something else is going on, but it takes her several moments to catch on. Evanora is here, and there’s a tall man standing beside her. The man is looking at Agatha with a dark, stony expression while Evanora talks in a hushed tone.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Billy whispers. Jen shushes him, a hand over his mouth.</p><p>It’s then that Rio notices how intense this conversation seems to be. Everyone watches in horrified anticipation as it escalates, hushed tones getting louder and louder.</p><p>“No. I’ll be eighteen in-”</p><p>“That’s enough!”</p><p>The sound rings through the hallway when Evanora’s palm makes contact with Agatha’s face.</p><p>Rio feels her skin get hot, her pulse racing.</p><p>“You, girl, are sick and perverted. I want you out of my house. If you can’t honor God, if you can’t honor your own mother, you may as well be dead to me.”</p><p>No one moves. Rio is wondering why no one is getting a teacher or something, why she isn’t getting a teacher, when she realizes Alice is no longer standing next to her.</p><p>Agatha is the first to break the stillness, dropping her bag on the ground and turning, rushing down the hall blindly.</p><p>It happens so fast, Rio has no chance to prepare, no chance to move. Agatha slams directly into her, her head knocking into Rio’s chin. She steps back, startled and confused, and locks her eyes into Rio’s.</p><p>Instantly, the tears are flowing. Rio is aware of Jen and Billy crowded near her as Agatha melts into a mess of saltwater. Everyone is watching, their eyes fixed as the bell rings for a second time, finally attracting the attention of teachers wondering where their students are.</p><p>Agatha, however, is completely unaware as she falls forward, her arms around Rio, clutching the back of her shirt with sweaty fists. Rio sucks in a breath, slowly wrapping her arms around Agatha's shoulders while she sobs into Rio’s. The teachers are approaching, but Rio keeps her hold on Agatha, a hand creeping up to the base of her head, feet gently rocking. Agatha sobs louder, a cry erupting from her shaking form, muffled by the thick fabric of Rio’s top.</p><p>Rio’s mind should be racing, but instead it’s blank. There’s nothing in her brain to distract her from what’s happening in real life, right in front of her. Agatha’s mother has disposed of her, in front of dozens of students, and not a single person has punched that woman in the goddamn face.</p><p>Rio tilts her head down, Agatha’s hair brushing across her lips. She sees Alice approaching with Lilia beside her.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here, okay?” Rio whispers. Agatha lifts her head just so, her face puffy and pink.</p><p>Lilia comes over, placing a hand on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“Why don’t you girls go to my classroom while I take care of this,” she says gently. Agatha looks at her, a familiar mask returning to her face. Protection.</p><p>Rio moves her hand to Agatha’s wrist.</p><p>“Come on,” she says, pulling Agatha along with her fingers pressed into her pulse. The rhythm keeps Rio grounded as she moves through the halls, ignoring prying eyes as best she can. She knows that now, post tears, Agatha is going to act with a new clarity, and Rio suspects it won’t be pretty.</p><p>They get to the choir room and Rio ushers her in.</p><p>“You sit, I’ll go get someone,” she tells Agatha, turning to the door.</p><p>“Wait,” Agatha calls after her, standing in the room, a spark of fear behind her eyes. Rio pauses for a moment, but she knows she has to go. There are too many things unsaid between them.</p><p>“I’ll send Natasha,” Rio says softly.</p><p>She doesn’t look Agatha in the eye before she goes.</p>

<em>It’s a cold evening in December, one of the coldest thus far, and Rio is thankful for the warmth of Agatha’s fireplace. They’re sitting together on a cushion they’d taken from the couch and placed on the floor to get closer to the heat, and Rio shivers when it envelopes her skin. Today is a snow day at school, which means they have the house to themselves while Evanora is at work. Not that Evanora knows that.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio hums, her fingers threading through Agatha’s long locks, weaving a braid here and there. The softness of her hair soothes Rio’s nervous system, which is still reeling from the fight she had with her foster mom just yesterday. They can’t seem to get along, the older Rio grows. </em>
</p><p>
<em>She thinks sometimes people don’t know what they’re signing up for, taking in orphaned kids with years of trauma and abandonment trapped under their skin. Rio’s trying to scratch it away and her foster parents just want to tie her hands back instead of stop the itching. She can’t make sense of it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Stop thinking, it’s too loud,” Agatha murmurs, turning her head just slightly. Rio scoffs, tying up the end of another braid. They’re both rather tired from their day of making a huge mess in the kitchen, binge watching Buffy, and catfishing the Salem Seven on Instagram. Rio wonders when it’ll get old. If ever.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“If I stop thinking, you’ll have to start,” Rio teases, laughing as Agatha gasps dramatically.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You wound me,” she cries, falling back into Rio’s lap, her hair spilling over Rio’s legs. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio can’t help herself, she becomes suddenly stoic as she runs her finger over Agatha’s thick, dark eyebrows. She gently relaxes them with her thumb when they furrow. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio,” Agatha whispers. </em>
</p><p>
<em>They’re both fourteen now. Rio remembers when they were little, chasing each other around the playground, getting covered in grass and dirt– much to Evanora’s dismay. That woman tried everything to keep them apart, from bribing other children into play dates with her unruly daughter to getting their teachers to keep them separated at school. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Nothing worked, however, as Rio believes their souls are tied together in such a tangled mess that to try and separate them would kill them both. </em>
</p><p>
<em>It’s not really surprising that their love for each other grew bigger. While all the girls in their class are stumbling and stuttering over sweaty teenage boys, Agatha and Rio have found themselves toeing the line that cuts between best friends and something… else.  </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio strokes Agatha’s cheek, sensing the line snap under her fingers. Her heart is beating out of her chest as Agatha slowly sits up, her cheeks warm and pink as her blue eyes pierce into Rio’s brown ones.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio,” she says again, almost like a question.</em>
</p><p>
<em>There’s something soft and flowery blooming in Rio’s ribs when she leans forward, reaching to grab onto Agatha’s wrist to anchor herself. Agatha breathes deep when their lips touch. It’s a bit strange, Rio thinks, realizing this is the first time she’s ever kissed anyone. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha tastes like hot cocoa lip balm and warm spices from the apple cider they’ve been drinking. </em>
</p><p>
<em>She holds tight to Agatha’s wrist, a few moments passing that disregard the rules of time as Rio feels her kissing back. It's dizzying.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Something deep in her chest, a flicker of intuition, she thinks, causes her to falter. Her eyes flutter open, seeing past Agatha’s head and through the frosted window. She gasps, pulling back suddenly, unceremoniously dropping Agatha’s wrist.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Outside is Evanora, staring through the window, face hard and disbelieving. Rio gets one glance before Agatha’s mother turns around, walking back to her car. Rio feels her blood turn to ice in her veins, a terrible fear taking over. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“I have to go, I’m sorry,” she tells her best friend, who looks stricken and flushed, her lips shiny from Rio’s lip gloss. She looks beautiful as ever, an angel in this Hell they’ve been raised in. Rio must do all she can to prevent Agatha from being swallowed up by the flames.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She gets up, stumbling on her feet. Outside, Evanora is already out of the driveway, speeding away with the urgency of a woman on a mission. Rio can’t breathe, the only thing holding her up being Agatha’s lingering kiss.</em>
</p><p>
<em>When she runs, blind and thoughtless, she says a prayer under her breath. </em>
</p><hr/><p>Agatha is all over her. The lingering scent of vanilla and violets trapped in the fabric of Rio's shirt. She shivers with it, partly wanting to tear it off and partly wanting to breathe it in until her lungs burst. It's makes her so crazy that she settles for pulling her jacket around her to snuff it out.</p><p>She feels depraved— yearning for Agatha while she's just behind the door, tears drying against her cheeks. This was not supposed to happen. If Rio ever believed someone or something is watching over her, she's now firm in her opinion that they must hate her guts.</p><p>This week was bad enough, already. It's starting to feel like this whole festival situation was a very, very bad idea. In fact, Rio is convinced she's on the verge of some sort of nervous breakdown. Before she knows it, her and Agatha both will be rocking back and forth in some facility, popping six different medications and yelling at each other in group therapy.</p><p>Rio tries to collect herself, doing the breathing exercises her therapist is always prescribing. Usually, she just lies and says they don't work because she can't be bothered to try, but right now it seems like the right course of action. Anything to keep her from descending into madness outside of the choir room.</p><p>Her methodical breathing is interrupted by heavy footfall coming nearer. Her eyes open in panic.</p><p>It's just Billy in his stupid combat boots.</p><p>He looks at her, wide eyed and nervous, and frantically reports that the police are here. He tells her Lilia is in the office with some of the other staff, probably talking with police while Evanora is in handcuffs. Rio can picture her there, all calm and unbothered. That evil woman cares about nothing as long as she believes she's in the right.</p><p>While Billy talks, Rio starts to get the feeling that she has something she needs to do. Or, rather, that if she doesn't find something to do, she'll lose her fucking mind. Luckily for her, the thought of Evanora has reminded her of something very, very important.</p><p>"Billy?" She waves a hand in his face, signaling for him to stop talking. He does, looking a little surprised. "I need to borrow your car."</p><p>"What? Don't you need to-"</p><p>"Do you have Natasha's number?" Rio asks, trying not to lose her composure at his comically confused expression. She has to hand it to the kid, he's got a talent for lightening up a situation just by being his awkward, stuttering self. That, and the occasional burst of audacity. She's only known him a week— and it hurts to admit— but she feels almost fond of him.</p><p>"Uh, no. But I have Yelena's," he says, already pulling his phone out.</p><p>"Okay, I need you to text her and tell her Agatha is in the choir room and Natasha needs to be there <em>right now</em>." Billy types, biting his lip in concentration.</p><p>"Done. Now where are we going?" He asks, a glint in his eye. Rio groans, rolling her eyes.</p><p>"You're not coming, I just need your car."</p><p>"Sorry, Rio. Terms and conditions say that in order to borrow Billy's vehicle, one must allow him to tag along per his request." Rio groans again, weighing her options. It would be too difficult to track down Lilia's keys at the moment, and she can't ask Jen or Alice without the risk of getting grilled for all she's worth.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is her best chance.</p><p>"Fine. But no questions," Rio demands, eyes burning into Billy with intention. "And you absolutely cannot tell a soul."</p><p>The kid looks positively giddy. "Deal."</p><hr/><p>Billy's car fucking sucks. It rattles, smells like it's going to explode, and the breaks are so shit that Rio has to put all of her body weight into it to come to a full stop. "It was my dad's in college," Billy says, face red with embarrassment. Rio just looks over at him, white knuckling the wheel as they slide around on the icy street.</p><p>She knows the way there like the back of her hand, but only on foot. Driving requires a completely different map in her brain, and she's worried there isn't a pin in this location. Trying her best to remember, she memorizes the road signs as they go, keeping note of familiar houses and landmarks.</p><p>Once they pass her old school it gets clearer. She didn't realize how long it's been since she's been through this part of town. Everything looks just the same, of course. Even the Walter's house remains unchanged. The same American flag over the window and plastic windmills in the yard.</p><p>The neighborhood begins to morph, the houses growing bigger and lawns more manicured, and Rio knows she's in the right place.</p><p>She pulls over in front of a large white colonial with thorny rose bushes planted in the front. They're dormant, now, but Rio can recall the summers she plucked those giant yellow roses and pressed them in her heaviest textbook. Sometimes they'd come out with sections of print on the petals.</p><p>"Stay in the car and keep watch," she tells Billy.</p><p>She gets out of the car and runs up the front steps, reaching a hand above her head and into the hanging flower pot by the front door. There's a chance it's been moved, but people are weird like that. She fishes around the dirt, rummaging through dead twigs and leaves. Eventually she finds it half buried in soil.</p><p>"Are we breaking into this house?"</p><p>Rio jumps, turning to find Billy hovering behind her. For someone with shoes heavy enough to break a window, she's amazed she didn't notice him coming.</p><p>"Jesus, I told you to stay in the car," she scolds.</p><p>"I know, but you're being really suspicious," Billy says, looking around in paranoia. "Whose house is this, anyway?"</p><p>"Agatha's." Rio turns around to avoid seeing whatever expression is on Billy's face.</p><p>"<em>What</em>?"</p><p>She sticks the key in the lock and turns it, satisfied when the door easily opens. Evanora always hated modern security systems. Thank god for that.</p><p>"What are we doing breaking into Agatha's house?" Billy asks.</p><p>"It's not breaking in if you use a key," Rio replies, rolling her eyes at him like it should be obvious. She turns away, not caring to answer any more questions.</p><p>Reaching back to shove Billy inside, Rio quickly follows, shutting the door behind her. This place still smells the same. A mix of potpourri and clean laundry. The entry way opens right to the stairs, the kitchen and living space on either side. Rio remembers the last time she was here. She looks to her right and sees the couch in front of the fireplace— sees the window that looks out to the driveway.</p><p>It sends a spark of pain through her. She once belonged somewhere. Rio's outer world raged just as violently as Agatha's inner one, and without each other, their delicate balance gave in to chaos. As much as she loves her home now— as much as she loves Lilia and Jen and Alice— the little Rio who lost everything knew no love until Agatha.</p><p>No one will protect that piece of them unless Rio does it herself.</p><p>Running up the stairs, she hears Billy following. It occurs to her that there's a chance she won't find what she's looking for. A lot has happened, after all. She never said anything about it, but Agatha has an eye for anything out of place. Her mother couldn't successfully hide her phone unless she held it in her hand 24/7, and even then, Agatha would have managed.</p><p>Her room is at the end of the hall. It isn't a terribly big room, but it has an en suite and a bay window, which always seemed so luxurious to Rio. She always dreamed of having a big house with a spacious bedroom that reflected who she is on the inside. If only that Rio could see her life, now.</p><p>She twists the door handle, and once it opens, light floods out into the previously dim hallway. The room looks just the same, although it's missing a few particularly racy posters Agatha used to put up to spite her mother. They were ripped off the wall so frequently that Agatha would have to replace them on a monthly basis.</p><p>Rio steps over a pile of clothes and looks around. It's messy in here, like Agatha's closet threw up all over the floor. Her bed is unmade, the curtains are haphazardly draped over the cushion on the window seat, and there's broken glass in the corner.</p><p>The events of earlier are starting to make a lot more sense. They must have fought this morning, probably about Agatha's choice in clothing. She does have a habit of throwing very breakable things when she's angry at her mother.</p><p>"This is worse than Kate's bedroom," Billy says, just as his foot gets stuck in a bra strap. "Oh my god!" He panics, screaming like he's found a spider crawling on him. Rio can hardly contain her laughter as he hops around on one foot, trying to kick the bra off without touching it.</p><p>"You're embarrassing yourself," Rio says. Billy shrieks again, his back hitting the dresser. This causes Rio to absolutely lose it, tears forming in her eyes. Feeling merciful, she goes over to him and pulls the bra off his shoe, dangling it in front of his face tauntingly.</p><p>"You're scared of a bra? Are you serious?" Rio teases, tossing the bra behind her shoulder and back into the clothing pile. Billy scratches the back of his neck, skin going as red as the bra he had stuck on his foot.</p><p>"I like to shield my innocent eyes from the mysteries of women," he says proudly. Rio cackles, throwing her head back.</p><p>"Innocent, my ass. I saw you texting that kid on the football team this morning. That may not have been a full nude, but if your mother were to-"</p><p>"Ohmygod stop!" He begs, covering his face with his hands. Rio walks over and pats his shoulder, smirking when he shoves her hand away.</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll never tell a soul. I owe you for this, anyway," she comforts. Billy's hands slide down his face and drop to his sides.</p><p>"You're lucky I still need you for tomorrow," he says. Rio smiles.</p><p>She tells Billy to pay close attention to any sounds that might suggest someone is coming into the house while she digs. She tries to think about the specifics. Agatha moved her shit around so often that it's hard to remember now, but she recalls the floorboard having a couple splatters of white paint on it. That turns out to be enough.</p><p>Shoving aside the clutter, she searches the floor next to Agatha's bed, certain it's somewhere close by.</p><p>"A loose floorboard?" Billy comments. "That's such a cliche."</p><p>Rio pauses to stick her tongue out at him before continuing her floor examination. She finally finds it, loose at the touch of her foot. There's no telling if anything is still under there. Agatha never told her about the loose floorboard— Rio found it herself— but she also did everything she could to hide things from her mother. It's possible she lifted it and found everything, which could mean it's all gone.</p><p>Rio thinks back. It was a couple months before they kissed in her living room. Evanora had gone on an absolute rampage, ransacking Agatha's bedroom for incriminating material. It was a particularly intense patch in their relationship, and when Evanora found Agatha's sketchbooks, photos, and a few other less than holy things of hers— it was ugly. She took everything, grounding Agatha for three months.</p><p>Rio, obviously, ignored the grounding.</p><p>When Evanora was at work, she'd come into the house and go looking for it all. She searched that place top to bottom, finally finding it shoved far into the vent in the master bedroom. Rio, who had known about the loose floorboard in Agatha's room for a while, thought it would make the perfect hiding place.</p><p>It takes some effort to pull it up, but once she does, she almost cries in relief. Everything is there. A small box filled with photos and notes Agatha collected over the years. A pile of little glass vials filled with dried herbs, written intentions, and (allegedly) strands of hair. Lastly, and most thankfully, three sketchbooks full to the brim with paper sticking out of the edges.</p><p>Rio thanks the universe and every witch that came before her for letting nothing in all these years of pain and suffering affect the contents of this floorboard. There's no way of knowing if and when Agatha will be back in this house, and even when she gets the chance, she wouldn't know to look.</p><p>She's seen kids getting pulled from their homes lose everything dear to them, left with nothing but a trash bag of clothes and a stuffed animal. Rio was too young to remember when her parents died, but she does remember clutching her mother's jewelry box between every foster home she ever had. She remembers how when she left everything behind, she still held that damn box in her arms, cradling it as she ran.</p><p>Agatha deserves to have something of her own wherever she ends up.</p><p>"Billy, come here," she says, gathering everything into her hands. She takes all the vials and shoves them into his coat pockets, ignoring his protests.</p><p>"Do I even want to know?" He asks.</p><p>Piling the sketchbooks on top of the box, she holds it all as tightly as she can, gently placing the board back with her foot.</p><p>"Probably not," she says with a smirk. "Let's go."</p><p>Rio shoves it all into her bag when they get back to the car. Lilia texted that everything is sorted and Agatha went home with the Romanovs. When Rio replied with a thumbs up, she sent a long and detailed list of errands for her to run. She can't help but be thankful for it— if she has to spend the next few hours chewing her nails off in a booth at Scratchy's, she might lose her mind.</p><p>Billy has to be at the rehearsal, so Rio convinces him to let her take his car, promising to pick him up when it's over. She'd take the Cadillac, but Lilia would kill her if she fucked up the leather seats with all the shit she has to haul. Plus, she feels more at home in a car that barely drives with rusted doors and headlights that flicker. She misses her Subaru.</p><p>Once they make it back to school, she pulls up near the side door where students are coming and going. "Where does Yelena live? I want to drop this stuff off," Rio says. Billy raises his eyebrows, trying to read her. Rio looks at him blankly.</p><p>"I'll text you the address," he says.</p><p>"Thanks," Rio leans toward his door as he gets out. "Try not to trip on any more bras!" A group of kids walking out of the school hear it, turning around and looking at Billy, confused. He turns as red as a tomato.</p><p>"Try not to break into any more houses," he says, shutting the door in her face. Rio laughs, making no promises. She hasn't felt so alive in months.</p><hr/><p>She makes the Romanov house her first stop, hoping the rest of the errands keep her properly distracted from her racing mind. Her plan is to put everything in a paper grocery bag Billy has shoved behind the seat and leave it on the doorstep, waiting just a moment to make sure it gets inside.</p><p>It's foolproof, really.</p><p>They live nearer to the high school than she expected, over in a cozy neighborhood where all the houses are old and unique. The Romanovs have a well landscaped front yard and wind chimes hanging by the front door. It looks like something out of a movie. She's met their parents a handful of times, and they always seemed nice, but now she feels almost jealous.</p><p>Imagine having a childhood in a place like this.</p><p>Shaking out her thoughts, Rio attaches a sticky note that says 'For Agatha' on it to the bag and gets out of the car. She knows they're home, so she tries to be as quick as she can about it, setting it down on the steps and ringing the doorbell before running.</p><p>She waits, driving up the street so she can still see without giving herself away. The door opens and a dark-haired woman steps out, looking around to see if anyone is there. It must be Melina.</p><p><em>Okay, hot mom</em>. Rio thinks to herself. <em>Has she always been that hot?</em></p><p>Melina thankfully notices the bag and picks it up, reading the note and looking inside. She checks once more for whoever left it before carrying it inside, shutting the door gently.</p><p>Rio breathes a sigh of relief. She hopes she's done a good thing.</p><hr/><p>The hardware store is quiet as it gets darker out. Rio stands at the counter, listening to the Dan the hardware guy drone on about something she doesn't know or care anything about. She's been here for almost forty minutes trying to get materials for a group making a forest of plywood trees. They were meant to do this themselves but ran out of time, or so they say. Rio honestly can't blame them— they probably know Dan and how passionate he is about nuts and bolts or whatever.</p><p>Rio has heard enough. "Listen, I really need to-" She's cut off as her phone starts to vibrate in her pocket. "Hold on," she says. She looks down and see's Billy's name on her screen.</p><p>"Are you done early?" She asks when she picks up, secretly hoping the answer is yes. There's loud voices in the background, some talking and some singing. She can't tell if it's rehearsing or everyone just fucking around. Rio struggles to hear Billy when he speaks.</p><p>"Not yet, but," he starts. The background noise is replaced with a loud rustling.</p><p>"What?" Rio asks, a hand over her other ear to block out the white noise of the hardware store.</p><p>"Sorry, Jen is just trying to kill me," Billy says, sounding out of breath.</p><p>"Why? What did you do?"</p><p>"<em>Because</em>, I got a text from-" the rustling returns, occasionally interrupted with Billy struggling to talk. "<em>Oh</em> my god, will you-" "I'm not-" "Jennifer!" Rio rolls her eyes, trying to make out Jen's voice in the background, but she doesn't catch a single word. Eventually, it sounds like the phone gets dropped on the floor, a loud tumbling sound attacking Rio's poor eardrum.</p><p>There's a pause before it gets picked up again. "Jesus, just tell me what this is about so I can pay for this paint and get the fuck out of here," Rio says, her voice low so Dan can't hear.</p><p>"Agatha wants to talk to you!" Billy says, as fast as humanly possible. Rio's breath stops. Shit. She should have known she wouldn't get away with it, not with what happened earlier and how Agatha hasn't seen those sketchbooks in over four years. Who else would have done it? Certainly not Evanora who's probably spending her night behind bars.</p><p>Rio drags her hand over her face. <em>Stupid, stupid, stupid</em>.</p><p>She breathes, trying to find a way out. "Well, she's the one who blocked my number so I don't-"</p><p>"<em>No</em>, she wants to talk in person."</p><p>Rio freezes. He <em>cannot</em> be serious. She may as well cut her own head off right now, since she'll be losing it soon, anyway.</p><p>"Are you kidding me?"</p><p>She finally makes out Jen's voice in the background, the room quieting down a little. "I told you this would be bad," she's saying. Rio has to agree. It is bad. She knows so because her heart is beating so fast she thinks she might be actually dying.</p><p>"Don't shoot the messenger, but I really think you should go." Billy says. Rio kind of wants to hate him, he's an agent of chaos, after all. However, she can't. Billy cares about Agatha, too. It's like he imprinted on her or something.</p><p>"Fine. I'm picking you up and you're coming with me."</p><hr/><p>They're in front of the house, the car turned off and the cold seeping in.</p><p>Rio sits back in the drivers seat, looking at herself in the rear view mirror just to check that she's still her. Everything about her looks a mess. Her hair is tangled, her lips chewed up, and her eyes are dark with rubbed mascara because she keeps forgetting she's wearing it.</p><p>She kind of looks like she spent the night out and crashed on the floor without washing her face. Not that it should matter. It doesn't. It doesn't matter at all.</p><p>"Are you going to go in?"</p><p>Rio startles, having honestly forgotten she isn't alone. "Uh, yeah. You're coming, too, right?"</p><p>"Sure, I guess," Billy says. "I can't hold your hand when you talk to her, though." There's a playful smirk on his lips and Rio wants to smack him. She should have brought Jen, instead.</p><p>Actually, no. That would be so much worse.</p><p>"Let's go before I throw up," she says.</p><p>Billy gets out and Rio follows, requiring a few extra pushes up the walkway to get her to the front door. Still, she hides behind Billy just slightly, tensing as she waits for him to knock. She could do it, of course, but she's too busy fidgeting with her hands and counting to ten in as many languages she can remember. Not to mention, Billy actually knows these people.</p><p>He knocks and they wait, Rio's head sinking into her black puffer jacket. The rings on her fingers are probably going to freeze to her skin with the combination of the biting cold and her sweaty palms. She shoves her hands up to the sides of her neck, hoping her skin and curtain of hair will warm them better than her pockets.</p><p>At least she's properly distracted.</p><p>Soon, the door opens to reveal Yelena. Her blonde hair is in two braids and she has a huge t-shirt on with words across the front that have been worn off to the point of being entirely unrecognizable. A giant smile grows on her lips when she sees Billy.</p><p>"What are you doing here?!" Yelena rushes forward, pulling Billy into a crushing hug. He struggles, grabbing onto the door frame to steady himself as she lets him go. Rio laughs at first, until Yelena catches her eye and smacks a hand over her mouth.</p><p>"No way," she says, looking back and forth between Rio and Billy. "Kate is going to be so jealous."</p><p>Billy rolls his eyes while Rio tilts her head in confusion. "You two are the weirdest people on the planet," Billy says. Rio raises an eyebrow at the interaction, still not understanding what's happening.</p><p>"Kate and Yelena are obsessed with you."</p><p>"What?" Rio finally asks, looking back at Yelena whose eyes are still wide in amazement.</p><p>"Oh my god, Billy, we aren't obsessed," she argues, looking a little pink. "We just think your cool."</p><p>Rio raises her eyebrows, her mouth opening with the plan to get words out. Her attempts are futile. "Uh," she laughs, "thank you?"</p><p>"They're totally obsessed," Billy says. "Now will you let us in? It's dark and freezing."</p><p>Yelena sticks her tongue out but steps aside, finally letting them feel the warmth of the house on their numb faces. Rio reaches down to untie her boots and tuck them against the wall beside Billy's, the floor warm through her socked feet. She shrugs off her coat and hangs it up by the door.</p><p>The inside of the house is just as inviting as the outside, Rio realizes. The walls are painted in autumnal colors that complement the warm wood, and all the furniture looks comfortable enough to take a nap on. Rio marvels at the eclectic decor and the sheer number of family photos they have put up. She almost feels jealous.</p><p>"Dad and Nat are at the grocery store," Yelena says, turning down the volume on the nature documentary playing on TV. "Mom's making tacos."</p><p>Billy nods, getting strangely awkward. "Uh, is Agatha around? Rio needs to talk to her," he says. Yelena's expression changes into something almost mournful, a stark contrast to her typically bubbly demeanor. She shifts on her feet.</p><p>"Yeah, she's upstairs." Yelena turns to Rio, "I'll show you."</p><p>Rio nods, giving Billy a small wave of farewell as they walk toward the staircase at the end of the hall. She has a feeling she should be nervous, and she <em>was</em> only moments ago, but now she's just worried. She imagines Agatha's face just before she left. Her eyes puffy and red, complete and utter devastation written all over.</p><p>Rio can only watch Yelena's braids bounce as she follows closely behind her.</p><p>Once upstairs, they reach a room to their right and come to a stop. It's quiet, but Rio sees the faint glow of light emanating from the sliver of space under the door. "She's been kind of snappy, so, uh," Yelena says with a grimace, "good luck." Rio tries to keep her wits about her as she thanks Yelena softly, watching her head back down the stairs without a care in the world.</p><p>Rio tries to remember herself before this week. There was a point in time when she could handle just about anything with humility and poise, when she could take on the world despite it all. That version of her feels so far away, now. Even then, however, Agatha has always been her weak point. Her vulnerability. It's no wonder that in this moment all her insides feel exposed.</p><p>Rio lifts her fist, closes her eyes, and knocks.</p><p>There's a shuffling noise, a sigh, and then— "Come in."</p><p>By sheer force of will, Rio wraps her hand around the brass doorknob, cool and smooth in her palm, and twists it. She pushes just slightly, and is met by the scent of pine needles and the warm glow of at least three candles scattered around the room. It's cozy and clean inside, all light wood and cream colored. Clearly Natasha's.</p><p>Agatha sits on the bed, surrounded by the things Rio dropped off earlier. One of the sketchbooks is lying open in front of Agatha. She looks up.</p><p>"Did Billy have to bribe you with a Monster energy drink or something?" She asks. Rio can't help but roll her eyes, gently shutting the door behind her as she enters the room.</p><p>"It was Liquid Death, actually," she says. Agatha says nothing, looking at Rio with tired eyes. Her hair is tied half up, one of her curls hanging over her forehead and caught in her lashes. She's wearing a black ribbed tank top and lounge pants with the strings hanging loose at her hips.</p><p>She looks like shit. She's the most beautiful thing Rio has ever seen.</p><p>"Did you have this?" Agatha asks, looking down at the open sketchbook in front of her. She's tracing the edge of a flower with the long nail of her pointer finger. Rio chews her lip.</p><p>"Not exactly," she says, crossing her arms over her chest. "It was under a floorboard in your room."</p><p>Agatha looks up then, eyes wide and mouth slightly open. She unfolds her legs and gets up, standing just two feet from Rio. "Excuse me?"</p><p>Rio shifts nervously, digging her heels into the plush rug under her feet. She then explains herself, going back to over four years ago when she found and hid it all. It's awkward, her hands going clammy, but she looks Agatha right in the eye as she explains. The last thing she wants is to come off like she's lying.</p><p>"Why didn't you tell me this before?" Agatha asks, looking genuinely confused. Rio bites her lip and looks to the ceiling. She doesn't have a very good answer. She had wanted to tell her about it, but there was never a good time. Agatha was too busy being at Evanora's throat at every opportunity, and Rio was scared that old crone would discover the stuff was missing.</p><p>Rio was so afraid that something bad was going to happen, then. At least if she was the only one who knew, she could take the fall. She hadn't known that fear would come true, only in an entirely different and far worse kind of way. Her plans always seemed to work, even when she wished they didn't.</p><p>"I don't know, I-"</p><p>Rio digs her nails into her arms and fights the anxiety swirling around in her chest. She wants to explain herself. She wants Agatha to understand her. But there's this thick, heavy curtain between them and, above all, Rio wants nothing more than to force it open. Suddenly, she's blurting it out like water spilling over a bucket.</p><p>"Your mom saw me kiss you."</p><p>Agatha looks dumbfounded. Rio feels a new understanding wash over her. She was never certain Agatha didn't know. There was a chance Evanora came back and told her what she'd seen— maybe even fabricated a story to absolve herself of blame for Rio's disappearance from Agatha's life. Now she knows. Agatha had no idea.</p><p>Rio senses the dam has broken and keeps going, hoping her words aren't doing irreparable damage as she speaks.</p><p>"She was looking through the window and then she got back in her car and drove off," she says. "I was scared out of my fucking mind so I ran home."</p><p>Rio tells her about getting there and finding Evanora at the kitchen table with the Walters. She remembers that awful feeling of being caught— of knowing that no matter what she did, nothing would ever be the same. She remembers the moment of silence she held in her mind for life as she knew it.</p><p>"She told me she was going to send you to Salem's. That she'd been planning for it for a while." Rio keeps her eyes trained on Agatha. "But if I just-" Rio chokes on her words, swallowing hard. "If I promised to stay away, she wouldn't do it."</p><p>She sees Agatha start to lose composure, her hands trembling just slightly.</p><p>"So I promised," Rio whispers. She got the ass-beating of a lifetime that night, and she didn't even care. By that time, she'd already made her decision. She would climb out her window and run as far as she could with whatever money she had, and catch the bus and get out of there. The Walters were abusive motherfuckers who hated her, and she'd been sick of it for a long time.</p><p>She didn't expect it, then, to make it all the way across town and see the backdoor of the high school cracked open. She was tired, and there wouldn't be a bus until morning, anyway. So she snuck through and curled up in the corner of the hall, hoping to get some sleep.</p><p>Lilia had been working late and found her there, curled around her jewelry box.</p><p>She doesn't tell Agatha all of this, not now. It wouldn't be fair of Rio to dump it on her in a time like this— but she can't carry it all by herself anymore. Rio didn't want to leave. She didn't want to say goodbye forever and abandon Agatha to her own inescapable hell. But Rio felt, then, that she had no choice. She wanted to protect her. It was her only option.</p><p>Agatha says nothing for a few moments, the silence heavy. Nothing can be heard but the occasional crackling of a candle wick and the pumping of Rio's heart in her ears. The only thing keeping her upright is the mental picture of Evanora in handcuffs. Maybe the Universe does care, at least for today.</p><p>Agatha's trembling becomes full on shaking, and Rio sees her trying to keep it under control. Her breathing quickens and she sticks her thumbnail into her mouth, biting it as tears well up in her eyes. Rio swallows again, feeling the same panic she felt in the hallway earlier today.</p><p>"I can't-" Agatha chokes, the tears finally falling over her cheeks. "I really thought that maybe-"</p><p>Rio twists at her rings and stays quiet.</p><p>"God!" Agatha yells, "I was going to go to her. I was going to try to talk to her, to make things right again. Thinking maybe she would-" She chokes again. Rio feels her heart cracking right down the middle, branching out like a tree. Agatha pulls on the bottom of her shirt, the fabric wadding up in her fist.</p><p>"She took every good thing from me," Agatha sobs. "Maybe I really am being punished."</p><p>Whatever kept Rio frozen in place shatters at Agatha's words. She goes to her, searching her eyes for any sign of rejection, and wraps her up in her arms. She's warm and damp with sweat, but Rio doesn't care. She only rocks her, gently carding her fingers through Agatha's long hair as she gasps and hiccups, finally surrendering and sinking into her. Agatha's head feels heavy on her shoulder.</p><p>"You're not," Rio says softly. "There's nothing to punish you for, do you understand?"</p><p>She pulls back just so, Agatha stepping away a bit awkwardly. Nonetheless, she nods, eyes uncertain. Rio knows she can't convince her with a hug and a few words, but it's a start. Hopefully after today she'll get the help she'll need to heal from this. To heal from years of Evanora's abuse.</p><p>Suddenly, Rio is moving toward the bed and picking up the sketchbooks to move them onto the desk. Agatha's crying starts to settle as Rio moves around the room, finding a basket full of blankets in the far corner. She picks the heaviest one and crosses back over to Agatha.</p><p>Rio reaches out a hand, silently asking for permission. Agatha hesitates, but takes it, her skin hot against Rio's. She hiccups, sniffling, and stays quiet as Rio pulls her onto the bed, signaling for her to lay down. Once she's done so, her arms folded into her chest, Rio spreads the blanket over Agatha and lays beside her.</p><p>A few moments pass as Agatha's breathing evens out.</p><p>Rio reaches over and wipes the tears from her cheek. "You're very easy to love, Agatha. Don't let her make you think otherwise," she whispers.</p><p>Agatha glances at her, like she can't quite look her in the eye. "Do you still love me?" she asks. Rio's chest clenches at the question.</p><p>"Agatha," she says softly. "I have loved you for longer than I've loved anyone else. I couldn't stop it if I wanted to." She isn't sure if that's the right thing to say, but it's the truth. Even so long ago, when Rio had first tried to tell Agatha why she ran, she loved her. She loved her as Agatha spit cruel words in her face, vowing to pretend as though they'd never known each other.</p><p>"Good," Agatha whispers, a teasing smile creeping onto her face, "because I tried hating you, but it was a lot of work so I gave up."</p><p>Rio laughs. "Wow, world-renowned hater Agatha Harkness is really losing her edge," she says. Agatha rolls her eyes, still smiling. Rio, feeling bold, reaches over and gently runs her nails up and down Agatha's exposed arm, watching her as her eyes fall shut.</p><p>"I'm so fucking tired, Rio," she murmurs. Rio sighs softly, missing the sound of her own name in Agatha's mouth. Missing her best friend.</p><p>"You should rest," she says. "I'll just be right here."</p><p>Agatha fidgets, her eyes still closed. "Can you be closer?" She asks. Rio's hand pauses it's movements.</p><p>"Yeah," she answers. "Whatever you want."</p><p>Agatha moves over, then, lifting the blanket for Rio to come in. Rio does, adjusting her position so she's sitting up a bit more, her back leaning on a stacked pillow and her head against the headboard. Agatha crawls into her arms and rests her cheek against Rio's chest. She hopes Agatha can't hear her rapidly beating heart as she pulls her in, running her fingers over her back.</p><p>"I'm glad you're here," Agatha murmurs. Rio hums, not trusting herself to speak while Agatha has her hand pressed to her side, fingers twitching as she begins to relax. Rio aligns her breathing with Agatha's and tightens her hold. This time, she has no plans to let her go.</p><p> </p>

<p>Somewhere between deep sleep and a dream, Rio jolts awake, instantly aware of the sweat causing her shirt to cling to her back. She takes a deep breath and attempts to move her arm, which is crushed under Agatha and completely asleep. She pulls, her fingers tingling and her muscles waking.</p><p>
<em>She hadn't meant to fall asleep.</em>
</p><p>The room is lit by nothing but moonlight through the curtains, now. Someone must have come in and extinguished all the candles. Which means they probably saw her all cuddled up to her childhood best friend like an emotional support animal— she just hopes it wasn't Billy.</p><p>Gently scooting to the end of the bed, Rio peels off her jeans and tries to ignore how damp her skin is underneath. <em>Who the hell sets the thermostat in this place? </em>She goes to the desk and reaches over it to crack open a window, wondering what time it is. The house seems quiet, so everyone must already be in bed.</p><p>A wave of panic flows over her when she remembers her phone is in her coat pocket. She has no idea if Lilia has tried to call her in the last few hours, and lack of communication is a very punishable offense in her household. Rio frantically searches for the time.</p><p>The glow of the alarm clock on the bedside table tells her it's 10:26. She's been sleeping for almost three hours. Honestly, the ache in her neck could have told her that much— she'd at some point forgone her pillow and slept with her head trapped between it and the wall.</p><p>Rio thanks herself for choosing boy shorts to wear this morning and softly pads toward the door. It only creaks a little as it opens, and she's careful to turn the knob as she shuts it so it doesn't click. She wouldn't want to wake Agatha now that she's finally getting rest.</p><p>The hallway is dim with light coming from the bottom of the steps. <em>Shit.</em></p><p>Rio holds her breath and tiptoes. So far, there isn't a soul in sight. She's beginning to think someone just left a light on, until she gets to the coat rack and turns to her left, seeing into the living room.</p><p>There, on the couch, is Natasha. She's reading a book under the light of a small lamp, a cup of tea on the coffee table in front of her.</p><p>Rio freezes.</p><p>"It's pretty nasty out. Would you at least like some pants before you go?" Natasha is looking at her, just a pair of green eyes over the top of her book. Rio squints at it, trying to read the title. <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>. That one is still on her TBR.</p><p>"I was actually just getting my phone. I forgot to text my-" Rio stops herself. "I wasn't supposed to be out this late."</p><p>Natasha finally puts the book down and crosses her legs, patting the spot across from her. Rio hesitates.</p><p>"Billy talked to Ms. Calderu. You're off the hook."</p><p>Of course he did. No doubt she'll still be in hot water, even if it's just an interrogation about what the hell is going on with her. She isn't sure she'd have a very good answer. Rio walks over, carefully sitting down and covering her lap with the throw blanket hanging over the arm of the couch.</p><p>Natasha pulls her legs up to her chest and takes a sip of her tea, looking at Rio with a studying gaze. The sight puts Rio at ill-ease, her body still heavy from sleep and her head full of rattling thoughts. She hasn't fully recovered from all the chaos, even after three hours of sleep in what may be the most spa-like bedroom she's ever stepped foot in.</p><p>"Sorry for falling asleep in your bed," Rio ends up blurting. Natasha laughs, surprise written all over her face. In the low light and without any makeup, she looks less intimidating than usual. Rio even spots a few pimple patches on her forehead.</p><p>"It's fine," she says, shaking her head. "You two looked real cozy."</p><p>Rio instantly blushes, turning to hide her face from view. There was a time when Rio was the clingy one— always grabbing at whatever she could reach, whether that was Agatha's hands or her hair or whatever else— and she could only imagine how annoying it was. Now, she knows it isn't annoying at all. She'd be happy if Agatha wanted to use all her body weight to pin Rio between her and whatever surface-</p><p>Her thoughts are graciously interrupted by Natasha's attempt to reassure her. "Seriously, it isn't a big deal. It seemed like Agatha needed it."</p><p>That last part causes Rio's muscles to tense. She doesn't want to overthink this. It was a long, difficult day for a lot of people, Agatha especially. Of course she would want comfort and familiarity. Not to mention— if Rio hadn't spilled her guts, she may have left with Billy and everything would be just like it's been the last four years.</p><p>So she shrugs it off. "If anything, I made everything worse," she mumbles.</p><p>She didn't allow herself to think it before, but now she's wondering if it's true. She added to Agatha's pain to alleviate her own. The feeling makes Rio want to crawl into a hole forever.</p><p>Natasha looks at her strangely, like she's trying to solve a puzzle. "I'm sorry," she says, shaking her head like Rio had been reading her thoughts or something. "Agatha doesn't like to talk about you much."</p><p>Of course Agatha wouldn't talk about her. That would be revealing her true character— AKA someone who isn't heartless and conniving. Their friendship, outside of the trouble they got into, was pure at heart. Agatha would be unable to hide herself.</p><p>"We used to be best friends. Blood sisters type shit," Rio says, cracking the smallest of smiles. <em>Sisters may not be the right word, but who's checking?</em></p><p>Natasha makes a face that suggests Rio has confirmed what she knew all along. "She's strange about you, you know. Yelena asks her a million questions and she refuses to answer even one. Won't even tell her if you dye your hair or not."</p><p>Rio laughs, startled. "Does it look like I do?"</p><p>"Hm," Natasha ponders. "Yelena says it's a nearly unnatural shade of almost black. Kate disagrees."</p><p>Rio cracks up again, unable to imagine anyone thinking this much about her. In her mind, people think she's just an anti-social loser who's lucky to have friends at all.</p><p>"I don't dye my hair," she confesses.</p><p>"I'll have to let them know."</p><p>For a few moments after, they sit quietly, tiredness fighting to take over. It's Natasha who breaks the silence, eventually.</p><p>"You know, I was about three when Yelena showed up at the orphanage in Russia," she says. Her tone is casual and unbothered. Like she's talking about something as mundane as the weather. "She was almost a year old and cried like crazy. All day long, no one knew what to do with her." Rio swallows. She used to share a bedroom with a baby like that. To this day she dreams that she's the baby— trapped behind wooden bars, no one coming to get her.</p><p>"She imprinted on me like a duckling, I swear. She wouldn't sleep unless they pushed our cribs together." Natasha's expression is just as serene and knowing as ever, but the slightest fond smile curls the corners of her lips. "Yelena had no record of a family, so eventually they just gave her my last name and called us sisters."</p><p>Rio didn't know that. Everyone was aware the Romanovs were adopted, considering they had a different name from their parents and looked hardly alike. Rio had simply never considered their previous situation. It was too weird and painful for her to think too much about the kids who got picked early. It isn't fair— she knows that— but inside her there's a little girl who's still so angry.</p><p>"She still sleeps in my room most nights," Natasha says. "There's something unbreakable about that kind of bond, you know?"</p><p>Oh. Rio does. She may not have been chosen to be someone's child, but she was chosen by Agatha. They chose each other to be there when it became unbearable to push through alone. Sure, maybe she's made herself crazy over her in the past few years, but one thing will always remain true. She'll never not be right there when Agatha reaches for her.</p><p>"I'm glad you had each other," Rio whispers. Natasha gives her a different kind of smile, this time. It's soft and sweet. It reaches her eyes.</p><p>"Me too," she says. Then, picking up her mug, she moves from the couch and walks toward the kitchen. Rio hears the clinking of dishes as she stares out at the snow falling beyond the window. Natasha doesn't make a sound as she shows up beside the couch, making Rio jump.</p><p>"Sorry," Natasha says, not looking entirely sorry. "I was going to say, we should get to bed, we have a very long day ahead of us. I'll bunk with Yelena."</p><p>Rio nods. Right. The lock-in is tomorrow. A whole night stuck in school with a bunch of theatre kids and nowhere to sleep but the floor. This week can't be over soon enough.</p><p>Following her back up the stairs and bidding her goodnight, Natasha's words weigh heavy on Rio as she reenters the bedroom. She's welcomed with the sight of Agatha sprawled all over the bed, her wild hair covering her face, gently snoring. Rio sighs, climbing over Agatha's splayed out form and crawling under the covers.</p><p>With the window cracked, the room is much chillier. Rio shivers, covering her exposed ear with the blankets. A part of her wants to curl up to Agatha, but she doesn't. Instead, she only inches closer, creeping her way onto the side Agatha has kept warm and lets the residual body heat stop her teeth from chattering.</p><p>Soon, Agatha closes the gap by rolling over into Rio's side, sighing. It only takes a few minutes for the sound of steady breathing to lull Rio to sleep.</p><hr/><p>She dreams she's trying to run, but something is stopping her. The ground beneath her is rocky and painful on her feet and the landscape is bleak, but she keeps at her attempt to flee, despite the- tugging of her hair?</p><p>Slowly, the world emerges, and Rio is aware of careful fingers pulling at her scalp.</p><p>"Wha-" She starts, trying to turn her head into her pillow.</p><p>"Stay still! I literally <em>just</em> fixed your eyeliner." It's Agatha, of course. Once Rio finds it in her to open her eyes, she's met with a curtain of dark curls falling over her, Agatha's long fingers weaving Rio's hair into braids. Her shiny purple nails tap against each other as she reaches the end pieces, tying it up with an elastic band.</p><p>"Okay, you're good," she says, leaning back onto her knees and double checking her work. Rio slowly sits up, catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror on the opposite wall. Agatha has successfully braided two braids into Rio's hair and made her washed up look from the night before into something presentable.</p><p>Rio is annoyingly reminded of the mornings she used to wake up to an english muffin being shoved in her mouth at ten minutes to eight. Some things never change.</p><p>She takes a look at Agatha. She's fully dressed in the tights she had on the day before and a dress with sleeves that flare out at the wrists. It's black, and the fabric looks expensive. Rio tilts her head.</p><p>"You're going to school?" She asks.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, picking up a lipstick from the pile of makeup beside her and blotting it on. "Obviously," she says. "You think I would skip school after my mother's ridiculous little display? I'm not letting anyone think she can get to me." She says, pursing her lips a little as she examines herself with a compact mirror.</p><p>Rio groans, throwing off the covers and forcing herself up. "You're insane," she says fondly, walking around to the end of the bed. There's a neatly folded set of clothes waiting. "Are these for me?" She asks.</p><p>Agatha nods, reaching over and picking up a long white shoelace. "You're borrowing from Yelena. I asked her if she had a belt and she gave me this." The shoelace lands in Rio's hand, and she stretches it to it's full length.</p><p>"Okay… cool," she says. Silence follows— the awkward kind— as Rio contemplates whether or not she's supposed to excuse herself to the bathroom or something to change. It seems ridiculous, considering she's standing in the middle of the room in just her underwear.</p><p>"I'll be downstairs," Agatha eventually says, slipping out of the room. Rio is left with a vague, barely there sense of foreboding as she dresses.</p><hr/><p>Rio— in a pair of ripped jeans, shoelace tied at her hips, and an t-shirt with the neckline cut off so it hangs off one shoulder— shovels orange slices in her mouth. She tunes out the quiet chatter behind her as she pulls her arms through her coat, holding what remains of her orange between her teeth as she zips it up.</p><p>As soon as she pulls her phone out of her pocket, she's met with an endless feed of new messages. Most of them are Jen, some Billy, and even a couple from Alice. It isn't until she reaches the bottom that she sees a single phone call from Lilia. At least <em>someone</em> knows how to mind their fucking business.</p><p>"I'm driving," Natasha announces, Yelena groaning in response.</p><p>Rio follows behind them, ignoring the fact that Agatha is right behind her and close enough for their shoulders to brush as they walk to the car.</p><p>The drive to the school is enough for Rio to start nodding off, the dark sky only just tinting back to blue in the early morning. She had about a hundred different dreams as she slept, and it's starting to feel like she was actually awake and hallucinating all night long. She remembers waking up in between, each time with her face in a soft bed of Agatha's hair.</p><p>
<em>Her fucking hair.</em>
</p><p>Rio's senses awaken as the anxiety sets in, her eyes flicking toward where Agatha is seated to her left. No part of her could imagine what this would really be like. Sure, she'd dreamed a thousand times of how it would feel to have Agatha back in her life, but nothing could prepare her for the reality.</p><p>She's so <em>nervous</em>. No, worse. She's <em>Shy</em>. It feels sort of like she's playing tug-of-war with her younger self, winner gets control over her reality. She hadn't realized just how much had changed.</p><p>When they get to the school, Agatha grabs Rio by the wrist just as she's shutting her door.</p><p>"I'll see you later?" She says, like it's a question. Rio nods, hoping Agatha doesn't notice how sweaty her palm is when her hand slides down to squeeze Rio's. They'll see each other, at the very latest, at the lock-in tonight. Rio smiles just barely as she walks away, trying not to make herself sick just thinking about it.</p><hr/><p>Jen finds her by her locker, a deep crease between her brows and her arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>"Rio," Jen says slowly, "please, for the love of God, tell me you did <em>not</em> have a <em>sleepover</em> with Agatha last night."</p><p>Rio tucks a loose hair behind her ear, her fingers sliding down the braid Agatha crafted a mere hour ago, and looks to the ceiling.</p><p>"Me and God don't really talk, so," she mumbles, shifting on her feet. Jen says nothing, only stares with a terrible intensity. Rio sinks into her coat like she's making an attempt to protect her vital organs. <em>Wait, no</em>, she thinks. <em>This is </em>Jen.</p><p>"You were laughing about this, what," she says, "two days ago?"</p><p>"That was before."</p><p>"Before what?"</p><p>"Before you very clearly became emotionally involved," Jen says softly, like she's delivering bad news. "I'm worried she's manipulating you."</p><p>Rio sucks in a breath, absorbing Jen's words. She can't actually mean that, can she? Rio knows it's been a long time, sure, but Agatha is still Agatha. She may be hot-headed and difficult, but she isn't <em>cruel</em>. Well, not with Rio. Never with Rio.</p><p>"Don't take it the wrong way," Jen says, her expression softening. "It's just… knowing Agatha-"</p><p>"But you <em>don't</em> know Agatha."</p><p>Jen sighs again. "And you're sure <em>you</em> do?"</p><p>Rio lets her arms drop from her chest and moves toward her locker to grab her things. Shoving her papers and stray pencils in her bag, she turns back to Jen.</p><p>"I have gym," she says, rushing away as quickly as she can before she does something stupid like start to cry.</p><hr/><p>The locker room is empty, of course. It's ten minutes until the bell, and even so, it's a health class day. Odds are she has the whole place to herself to sulk and wallow.</p><p>Rio sits on the bench in a criss-cross, just trying to breathe. She's always relied on her friends to keep her feet on the ground, to guide her back to the light when things got dark. The thing is, Jen and Alice met post-Lilia Rio— a version of her that understood what it meant to have a parent for the first time in her life. She was shyer, then. Changed by what had happened.</p><p>It occurs to her that she hasn't relearned how to trust herself. How can she know what's real? For all she knows, her experience with Agatha is appearing to her through a shimmering veil of nostalgia. There isn't anyone who can clear that up for her. Rio will have to figure it out on her own.</p><p>She's swimming in the endless pool of her thoughts when she hears the metal door opening.</p><p>The first thing she registers is the perfectly slicked back blonde ponytail. It swings in the kind of way that can only be done deliberately, and Rio senses it in the way she walks. Ava Anderson. Cheer captain, total bitch, and Rio's former nemesis— no exaggeration required.</p><p>"Rio!" She exclaims, her tote back slung over her shoulder just to be annoying. "Long time, no see. How are you?"</p><p>Rio straightens up, not interested in looking vulnerable. "The last time we were this close, a tarantula found its way down your shirt," she says sweetly. A flicker of anger moves across Ava's soulless eyes.</p><p>"I remember," she says, smiling tightly, "but that was so long ago. I like to focus on the present."</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, pretending to be interested in her fingernails. "What do you want?" She asks, sounding as bored as possible.</p><p>"I just wanted to ask how Agatha is doing, is all. It seems you two have gotten close again," Ava says. "You know, now that everyone else has rejected her."</p><p>Rio shrugs, doing her best not to react to Ava's insinuation. "She's fine, thank you."</p><p>"It's so sad that her mother couldn't get through to her. I'm sure if they'd talked they could have found common ground with the whole gay thing," Ava says, sighing like the fake bitch she is.</p><p><em>Wait</em>, Rio thinks, frozen in place. <em>Gay thing?</em></p><p>"I'm not sure what you mean," she says.</p><p>Ava furrows her brows and puts on a concerned pout. "You don't know?" She asks. "Agatha was found with Wanda Maximoff right here in the locker room last year. Sophie caught them after dance class. It's why she got sent away."</p><p>Rio does her absolute best to hide any reaction. <em>Wanda</em>? <em>That doesn't make any sense.</em></p><p>"Right," she says, "I meant about her mother. I don't think someone that small-minded is capable of acceptance. The only ground she'll stand on is her own, and Agatha deserves better than that."</p><p>Rio stands, knowing that if she doesn't get out of here now she not only will miss class, but she'll also probably lose it. Ava opens her mouth to retort, surely, but Rio doesn't give her the chance as she walks out, counting tiles to measure her breathing.</p><p>
<em>Fuck Ava. Fuck Wanda. Fuck everything.</em>
</p><p>Rio lets herself stew in her anger on her way to the classroom. Deep down, she knows the truth of it— that whatever she's feeling now is only a poorly manufactured mask for her jealousy.</p><p>Maybe she doesn't know Agatha, anymore. Maybe these last four years really are a testament to just how much has changed. However, she knows something else for certain, something everyone around her won't admit they saw first. It eats at her as the day goes by, from first bell to the last.</p><p>She still, just as desperately as her fourteen year old self, <em>wants</em> Agatha Harkness.</p>

</p><p>Rio's bag is checked by Mrs. Davis, who has to ask her name like she hasn't attended this school for nearly four years. </p><p>"It's Rio," she says. "Vidal."</p><p>"Oh! My goodness, I'm sorry, dear," Mrs. Davis sputters, her neck going pink. "You're always so quiet during class, you never give me a thing to worry about!"</p><p>Rio smiles tensely, wishing desperately to be released. "That's alright, Mrs. Davis." There's a long pause, Mrs. Davis smiling with her teeth. Rio laughs awkwardly, "Can I go now?"</p><p>Mrs. Davis perks up, as if she's exiting a trance. "Oh! Certainly, certainly."</p><p>Rio swings her bag over her shoulder and makes her escape. She's here early, hoping to find Lilia before the craziness begins. So far, things are quiet, with few students milling the halls at only seven-thirty. Rio is hoping to avoid as many of those students as she possibly can. </p><p>Rio finds her way to the mini theater where she has so many supplies piled up that she isn't sure where to begin. Earlier in the week she's pretty sure she had big plans and ideas, but after yesterday she's forgotten most of it. She really needs to keep lists or something.</p><p>"Hey!" </p><p>Rio practically jumps out of her skin, spinning around to see Billy poking his head out of the sound and projection booth. "Jesus, Billy," she gasps out, chucking a tied up bag of plastic hooks at his head.</p><p>"Ow! There's poky things in here," he complains, holding the bag out to examine what hit him.</p><p>"What are you doing? Isn't there a meeting in fifteen minutes?" Rio asks, rummaging through the boxes.</p><p>"Yeah, but I saw you come in. Ms. Calderu told me to let her know when you got here."</p><p>"Tell her I'm here and I'm not going to the stupid meeting," Rio says with a smile. Billy sighs, walking over. </p><p>"Are you okay?" He asks, looking at Rio with a suspicion that she doesn't particularly like. Rio pauses her rummaging and sits on the floor, knees up to rest her arms. </p><p>"Fine, why?"</p><p>"Well, you seem weird. What happened last night? We could hear the yelling from downstairs."</p><p>"Oh, my god," Rio says, exasperated. "Nothing! Agatha was yelling about her mom, obviously."</p><p>"And then you just, what? Kissed and made up? And now it's weird? Nat said you guys seemed-"</p><p>"Billy?" Rio says, finally interrupting. </p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Leave it alone." Rio forces herself back to her feet and gets back to the boxes, creating piles to make the decorating process a little less chaotic. That, and it's keeping her from losing her mind. </p><p>Billy leaves her, and Rio has to reckon with the fact that all her brain is capable of doing right now is imagine Agatha and Wanda furiously making out in gym towels. Jesus fucking Christ. Rio didn't realize she's so quick to jealousy. That, coupled with the anxiety she's feeling, is making her wonder if she needs to get back on her meds. </p><p>Lilia comes in much later when Rio is too engrossed in sorting her pile to notice. She's gently organizing a stack of yellow origami paper when her shoulder is tapped. This time, she doesn't jump. </p><p>After school today, Rio went to Lilia's classroom to collect the car keys. She wasn't keen on talking, so she gave the shortest version of what happened the night before and left no space for Lilia to ask questions or make comments. </p><p>Ever since that morning, she'd been reeling about Wanda, making up stories in her head and letting herself be consumed. When she inevitably ran out of the classroom, Lilia had looked at her knowingly, but allowed it. </p><p>Lilia always waits for Rio to come to her. It's just one other thing that makes Rio uneasy, given her history. It's hard to let people treat her with dignity and respect, sometimes. </p><p>Now, though, she wants nothing but comfort. Rio turns from where she's squatted on the floor and stands up into Lilia's waiting arms. They squeeze tightly around her, and Rio feels a hand gently patting her back as they sway. </p><p>"I'm not asking that you talk, I just-" </p><p>Rio interrupts her. "I'm so confused, and Jen thinks it's all a bad idea, and then there's <em>Wanda</em>, and Jesus FUCK," Rio rambles, her tears sliding over her lips and dripping to the floor, "I hate being in love, I feel like such a freak."</p><p>Lilia sighs. "If someone were to tell me this is what it's like to raise a teenager, I'd have been far kinder to the parents of my students over the years."</p><p>Rio sniffles, pulling away and wiping her cheeks. It's useless really— they're dampened again in seconds. </p><p>"What do I do?" She mutters, glassy eyed and pleading. Everything is always so fucking complicated, her brain feels like it's been through a blender.</p><p>"I can't tell you what to do," Lilia says, gently brushing away the strand of hair that's stuck to Rio's mouth. She sniffles, wishing to crawl into her sweatshirt and stay there the whole night. "I can only advise you to trust your instincts. You have very good ones, I can attest to that."</p><p>Rio resists the urge to roll her eyes. If she had good instincts, she'd be faring much better at the moment. Just when she needs her gut to speak, it's drowned out by buckets of worry. </p><p>She goes to respond, but the door opens before she gets a chance.</p><p>"I'm not sure if this is any good, honestly. I spent like three hours on it today, and I almost scrapped it twice," Agatha is saying. She has what Rio assumes to be her poster rolled up in her hands and a tote bag over her shoulder. She's in sweats and a tank top, of course. A white pointelle tank top. With no bra on. </p><p>Rio struggles not to gape, thanking God it isn't at all see-through. She'd probably pass away instantly.</p><p>Billy, who's walking with his neck twisted so hard toward Agatha that he bumps into a chair, notices the company first.</p><p>"Oh! Hey Ms. Calderu," he greets, pretending as though he didn't just slam his knee into the back of a wooden seat. "Are you hanging out with us?"</p><p>Lilia glances toward him before turning her gaze back to Rio as she answers. "I was actually just about to head back down the hall," she says, eyes asking Rio if it's alright. Rio gives her an assuring smile, though it's a small one. "That forest display is going to require as much of my attention as I can spare."</p><p>Billy frowns. "Good luck," he says. "I saw them testing out spray paint when I walked by."</p><p>Lilia curses under her breath. Rio wouldn't want to be her tonight, despite everything.</p><p>"You should probably take care of that," Rio offers. Lilia sighs again.</p><p>"Wait," Agatha says, walking over with her poster held out. "You should look at this before we put it up. Tell me if it's okay?" She sounds genuinely uncertain, which throws Rio. Just a few days ago she was walking in the choir room all devil-may-care, and now she's shy? </p><p>Lilia just smiles and carefully unrolls the poster. It's perfect, of course. A nice balance of cartoon and classy. Agatha's eye is unmatched. </p><p>Which is why Rio can't be surprised when Agatha notices her red face and puffy eyes.</p><p>"Hey, what's wrong?" Agatha asks, so soft and concerned. Rio is scared to move.</p><p>"Oh, nothing," she says, pushing back one of the braids Agatha so carefully wove into Rio's hair this morning. "It's been a long day."</p><p>She hates to be cryptic, but she doesn't care to lie. It <em>has</em> been a long day. She just can't tell Agatha the reason. Who knows if any of it was even true?</p><p>Agatha looks at her funny, but leaves it. Instead, she steps an inch closer and swipes her thumb over Rio's cheek. "Okay," she says, "I'm right here, though. If you need me."</p><p>The way she says it makes Rio want to crawl into Agatha's arms and bury her face in her skin. It sends a pang through her chest. </p><p>"I know," Rio says. She does know. Which is why this is all so awful. Nothing Jen or Ava or even Natasha can say will overpower Rio's own heart. Everything she is has been built on a foundation of loving Agatha. </p><p>"This is wonderful, Agatha," Lilia says, handing the poster back. "After tomorrow, I expect your grade will improve." Rio tries to ignore the way Agatha's face lights up. She tries to ignore Lilia's fond smile. If she begins to connect the two in any meaningful way in her mind, something terrible will happen. Like a burst of hope. </p><p>After some pestering from Billy and a general rundown of their plans, Lilia gives them a little pep talk and leaves them to it. </p><p>Rio looks down at her pile, then, feeling awfully unprepared. She gathered all these supplies and didn't think to come up with some sort of plan.Typically, Rio prefers her chaos to be the controlled kind. </p><p>Billy and Agatha, on the other hand, jump right in like it's nothing. </p><p>They dig into the boxes, pulling out sheets for the backdrop, strings of lights, and a bucketful of craft supplies.</p><p>Billy holds up a thick stack of yellow paper. "What's this for?" </p><p>Rio shrugs, her arms crossing over her chest. "I was thinking of making a bunch of origami stars to hang from the ceiling?"</p><p>Agatha, who is elbow deep in a box of ornaments, lets out a sharp laugh. "Of course you would," she mutters. </p><p>Rio  raises an eyebrow. "Sorry, what's that supposed to mean?" She looks toward Agatha, who's kneeling with her arms resting on one of the bigger boxes. It's hard to look at her without noticing the wispy curls over her eyes and the exposed skin on her back between her tank top and sweats. </p><p>"I <em>mean</em>, you had me sitting on your bed with you making these for four hours straight one day because your favorite nun gave you a detention," Agatha says, sitting back on her heels to look at Rio. "And right <em>now</em>, you're obviously upset about something."</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, moving to busy herself by starting on the stars. "I'm not. I told you, it was a long a day." She knows it's a shit excuse, but she can't be bothered to come up with anything better. She's too busy trying not to bring up Wanda fucking Maximoff. </p><p>"Right…" Agatha says, glancing down at Rio's hands, which are furiously folding yellow paper. She finishes the first one and hands it to Agatha. "Would you just attach the strings for me?" She asks, as innocently as she can muster. </p><p>Agatha sighs, accepting the star and string Rio holds out to her. "I'd attach strings for you anytime, darling," she says. Rio tenses, nearly cutting her finger with the paper, but quickly recovers. Agatha is messing with her. Of course she's messing with her. </p><p>"You guys are being weird," Billy says, stretched on his tiptoes trying to hang up the sheet. "What happened last night?"</p><p>Rio ignores him, not up for dealing with Billy's never-ending thirst for gossip. Agatha, however, can't help herself. </p><p>"Well, you see, when two hot girls love each other very much…" she says, smiling sweetly and picking up another star. Rio feels her cheeks grow warm and her mind attempting to spiral at the use of 'love'. Thankfully, Billy isn't fooled, which is slightly surprising. </p><p>"Please," he says, "I heard you yelling. Did you guys have a fight? Rio looks like a kicked puppy."</p><p>Rio, feeling defensive suddenly, finally speaks up. "Why don't you try minding your business, for once, Billy?!"</p><p>Both Billy and Agatha look taken aback. Rio, ever the diplomat, does not raise her voice at really anyone. Well, most people. She's better at keeping to herself, so that's what she does. She doesn't lose her temper, especially not over a harmless joke.</p><p>"Rio, really it's-" Agatha starts.</p><p>"Let's just make the fucking stars so we can move on to the next thing, okay?"</p><p>The next couple of hours go by with little noise from Rio. She makes her stars, passes them to be strung, and then hangs them from the ceiling without uttering another word. Agatha and Billy, however, chatter like squirrels. </p><p>Rio listens to them gossip and comment on pop culture news that she knows nothing about, while she drowns in her own head. Maybe she should go find Lilia. Or Jen. Or run off and call Alice. Anything other than this. </p><p>She clenches her jaw and pushes through, telling herself that once she gets through this she can grant herself permission to fake sick to get out of the festival tomorrow.</p><p>It's nearing eleven when Mrs. Davis finally pops her head in. </p><p>"Wow! I'm really feeling the magic in here," she says, taking in the hundreds of yellow stars and the soft glow of the Christmas lights that have been strung up around the room. "There's snacks in the lobby, if anyone's hungry," she reports, "even Santa's elves have to eat." </p><p>There's an awkward silence as she smiles at them, basking in her cleverness in comparing them to elves. </p><p>Billy smiles politely. "Thanks Mrs. Davis."</p><p>She gives them a thumbs up and shuffles away. Rio doesn't know what it is about that woman, but it's almost as if she's never left the simplicity of the 1950's. She probably watches infomercials on a TV with an antenna. </p><p>Rio can't help it when she laughs. It comes out in a sudden burst, and both Agatha and Billy turn to her in surprise. She doesn't even care, just laughs somewhat hysterically as the late night delirium takes over. Not long after that, they're all laughing.  </p><p>The tension breaks with this, freeing up the haze between Rio and her… well, she supposes she can call them friends, now. They get to talking about pointless nonsense and Rio almost forgets about Wanda entirely.</p><p>The heaviness Rio has felt since this morning begins to lift, and when the clock strikes midnight she's feeling eager to test out the projector. Rio took the nicest one she could find from the video store, knowing Ralph won't have a clue it's missing.</p><p>Billy decides to stay below and report back on the sound and quality while Rio and Agatha do all the tech work. </p><p>The sound booth is small and cramped, and the steps leading up are just the same. This means Rio gets an eyeful of Agatha's ass as she climbs up behind her, of course. The sight brings back her weariness. What she would give to have all <em>that</em>. </p><p>"How do you work this thing?" Agatha asks. Rio is currently balancing the projector on a precarious stack of boxes, trying to get the angle right. </p><p>"I'll show you in a second," Rio says, "can you pass me Charlie Brown?" </p><p>It's a digital projector, so they're using dvd's Billy brought from his family's movie collection in his basement. Rio is just hoping they aren't covered in scratches. </p><p>Rio shows Agatha the process and they get the movie going, adjusting it to the size of the sheet Billy hung up. Rio reaches back to turn the light off.</p><p>"Is the sound okay?" Rio calls down. Billy turns and gives a thumbs up from below. </p><p>Rio sits back, pulling her knees up and looking over at Agatha, whose face is lit by the glow of the projector. Her brain does a bad, terrible thing and reminds her of Wanda. She doesn't know why, but it comes to her like an itch, and Rio isn't sure she can help herself. </p><p>She blurts it out. "Ava told me what happened with you and Wanda."</p><p>Rio isn't sure why she doesn't just ask outright, but it feels safer to test the waters— let Agatha take the lead and bring Rio to the truth by her own volition.  </p><p>"Oh," Agatha says softly. She doesn't say it like a person who's been caught. She says it like a <em>realization</em>. "That evil bitch," she says, shaking her head in disbelief. </p><p>"Sorry, what?" Rio questions, officially lost. </p><p>"Hold on," Agatha says, pulling out her phone. Rio waits, not sure if she should intervene with more questions or not. Agatha doesn't give her the time, she simply pulls up a photo and holds her phone to her chest to conceal it from Rio's eyes. </p><p>"I know what she made you think," Agatha says slowly. "I promise, this is <em>not</em> what it looks like. Well, it is. I'll explain, I swear."</p><p>"I don't-"</p><p>Agatha turns the phone around to reveal a grainy photo. It's her and Wanda, wrapped in gym towels in the locker room. Their mouths are <em>definitely</em> touching. Rio sucks in a breath.</p><p>"There was nothing between us, I swear."</p><p>Rio feels a little sick. If she felt disturbed before, she feels completely horrified now. Wanda is everyone's dream girl. She's sweet, loving, and always there for anyone who asks. Everything about her is graceful and gentle. Rio is absolutely none of those things. </p><p>"Okay… I mean," Rio starts, careful in her wording, "you have every right to-" She can't continue. She actually kind of wants to start crying, which is mortifying on its own. Coupled with the fact that she also wants to grab Agatha's face and shove her tongue in her mouth in a possessive frenzy, Rio feels frozen in place.</p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, looks positively rejected. Her expression drops and her phone returns to her side.</p><p>"No, sorry," Agatha says. "I don't know why I made such a big deal. We were like fourteen when you kissed me, I guess it wouldn't have been that serious."</p><p>Rio is speechless, her mouth dropping open. "What? No! I don't mean that I don't-" She pauses, unsure of what to do. "It <em>was</em> serious. To me? It was <em>very, very serious</em>."</p><p>Rio holds her breath as she waits for her confession to take hold.</p><p>Agatha looks like she's bracing herself before she speaks. "I kissed Wanda because I kept dreaming about you," she whispers. "I thought I was just horny or something and needed to get it out of my system." </p><p>Rio doesn't know what to say to that, so she says nothing, her heart rate skyrocketing. </p><p>"Wanda was cool with it, and I trusted her. I also wanted to rub it in Nat's face, but that's another story," Agatha continues, waving her hand in dismissal. "It didn't work, obviously. I got caught for nothing. And then in that godforsaken girl's school, literally all I did was dream about you. I was waking up to the den mother hovering over me telling me I'd been disturbing the other girls by moaning in my sleep."</p><p>Rio swallows, feeling her skin get warm. Agatha just laughs, like it's funny. </p><p>"You kept me alive in there," she whispers seriously. Then, she smiles, "you know, the naked dreamland version of you."</p><p>Rio used to spend full nights staring at the ceiling, imagining what it must be like for Agatha in that place. She'd never heard of it before then, and anything she researched online seemed either dripping in propaganda or it was some horror story written by an anonymous redditer. </p><p>All that time thinking she was the only one stuck in time in Agatha's living room— lips forever pressed to hers, only moments away from their gruesome end. To know now that Agatha had held onto her in her own, less angsty and more vulgar kind of way, makes Rio want to bare her soul right here and now. </p><p>However, she feels as though her words will fail her, so she goes with her instincts instead. Agatha doesn't see it coming— much like Rio didn't the day before— except this time, pain is not the source of their desperation. </p><p>Rio launches forward and pulls Agatha into her, practically toppling over onto the floor. Agatha, in the midst of her surprise, just holds her up to keep her from falling. It isn't long before she sinks into Rio, burying her face in the crook of Rio's neck.</p><p>"Tell me you love me," Rio whispers. In any other scenario she would be insane, but not here. Not for them. "Please."</p><p>Agatha pulls back a little, which causes Rio's heart to momentarily drop, but it's back in place when Agatha takes Rio's face into her hands. Her thumb is softly caressing Rio's cheekbone and her eyes are wide and focused.</p><p>"Obviously, I love you," she whispers. Her head is tilted, taking in Rio's face like she's looking at it for the first time. "I always have, even when I didn't want to."</p><p>Rio's eyes drop and come back up to look at Agatha in all their intensity. "Good, because if I don't kiss you right now I think I might die," she gasps out. She gives Agatha no time to process before she's on her like a woman starved. </p><p>Agatha whimpers, her hand sliding down Rio's neck and landing at her side, fingers pushing under the fabric of her sweatshirt. Rio slides her tongue into Agatha's mouth and feels the warmth in her abdomen growing as sharp nails dig into the skin of her side. </p><p>This is what heaven is, she thinks. All that time studying god or whatever and hearing all that shit about gold and thrones when no one ever said anything about <em>this</em>. </p><p>Agatha here in her arms, moaning and shuddering and making Rio wish she could get her naked and bury her face between her legs. It's torture. It's everything she's ever wanted. </p><p>After what's probably a few minutes, their kissing slows and Rio feels pulled back to reality when the Charlie Brown Christmas music begins in the background. She reluctantly pulls away, shivering when she notices her sweatshirt and Agatha's tank top have ridden up and caused their bare stomachs to touch. </p><p>Agatha whines. "Can we just ditch? I'd literally fuck you in a car right now."</p><p>"Neither of us <em>have</em> a car right now."</p><p>"I didn't say whose car," Agatha smirks. Rio smiles lazily, feeling almost giddy with happiness. She has her hand in Agatha's hair, gently petting and playing with the long, soft waves just like she always had before. </p><p>"Unfortunately, Lilia would murder me," Rio says. </p><p>Lilia wouldn't be the only one, as they're so rudely reminded when Billy's voice is heard from below. Rio had forgotten he was even here until now.</p><p>"Uh, guys?" He calls, turning around to face them through the sound booth glass. Agatha and Rio jump away from each other. "Do you want to start the next one or…?"</p><p>Rio gives an awkward thumbs up and heads for the projector.</p><p>This lock-in thing is kind of growing on her. </p><p>

<p>Blanketed by dim twinkle lights and a massive quilt Billy's mom made, Rio wakes in a pile of pillows. </p><p>She remembers losing several card games and filming at least ten TikToks on Billy's phone after midnight. They were borderline delirious, and it was the most Rio has seen Agatha smile and laugh since they were kids. </p><p>Rio smiles at the thought, now, wincing as she lifts her head. It was cranked at an odd angle, but her neck was spared by the giant squishmallow shoved under her upper back. She groans, attempting to pull it out from under her to get to her phone. </p><p>A text from Agatha is on her screen. <em>A text from Agatha</em>. </p><p>
<strong>M'Lady&lt;3</strong>
</p><p>
<em>We're in the caf. Saving you a danish xx -Agatha</em>
</p><p>Rio's breath hitches a little when she sees it. Agatha has had her blocked for years now, her texts left behind like a ghost at the very bottom of Rio's messages. It didn't really occur to Rio that now, two broken phones later, Agatha would still be saved as 'M'Lady&lt;3' in her contacts. </p><p>Rio giggles to herself, rolling over with her phone pressed to her body. </p><p><em>They kissed</em>. They kissed! Hardly containing herself, the memory replays in Rio's head over and over again. How on Earth is she supposed to enter the same room as Agatha without blushing and stuttering like an idiot? </p><p>Rio adjusts her wrinkled clothes and stretches, padding out of the theater bare-footed. She wishes she had something better than her phone camera to check her state of disarray. </p><p>The cafeteria is loud when she approaches, but two voices rise above the rest. She should have known the camaraderie between those two would only last so long. Rio winces, afraid to walk into whatever mess awaits her. </p><p>"You are so <em>unbelievably </em>dense! One day you're going to have to learn how to control your comically large mouth before it bites you in the ass!"</p><p>"Agatha, I'm sorry, it just came ou-"</p><p>"I don't give a fuck, Billy! You couldn't bother confessing to <em>us</em> you saw us but you can tell literally everyone else the first chance you get?"</p><p>Rio winces even harder. Billy saw them. <em>Of course he did</em>, she thinks. They were directly behind a glass window. Glass windows are commonly transparent, in case you didn't know.</p><p>Deciding it may be a good time to intervene, Rio carefully masks her expression into something a little more neutral. If she plays careless, it'll be far easier to keep her cool in a crowded room. </p><p>Pushing open the cafeteria door, Rio spots them at a table to her right. Pretty much everyone they know is sitting nearby, awkwardly watching the exchange as they pretend to eat their pastries. Natasha, however, is hiding her laughter behind her coffee mug.</p><p>Bracing herself, Rio walks over.</p><p>"Hey… What's going on guys?" She asks hesitantly, coming to Agatha's side and giving Billy a look of warning. 'Back down now or you're losing a finger', it says. Billy smiles awkwardly. Agatha, however, has turned a fun shade of red.</p><p>"Nothing. I would just prefer if this evil twink would keep my personal information to himself, considering <em>no one else</em> cares to do that these days!" She yells, but she doesn't shy away as Rio slides her hand around her arm, giving it a comforting squeeze. </p><p>"Okay, when you say that word like that, it may as well be a slur," Billy mutters. Agatha practically lunges forward at this and Rio has to grab her by the shoulders and hold her back.</p><p>"Agatha," she says, stern and a little worried as she remembers the teachers in the room. It doesn't help that all their friends are watching either. Or that in this moment Lilia has decided to walk in the door. </p><p>Agatha sees this and takes a breath, cooling herself down. </p><p>"No, no," Billy says, looking thoroughly scolded, "she's right. I should be more careful. You've been through a lot, and I'm sure you're sick of having an audience every time something happens. I'm really sorry, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha swallows, leaning back into Rio a bit, giving into her typical instinct to curl away at any sign of vulnerability. </p><p>"It's okay. I'm sorry for calling you a twink," she murmurs, just loud enough to reach Billy's ears less than a foot away. </p><p>"You're forgiven," Billy says. Then he opens his arms, smiling big. </p><p>Agatha groans, rolling her eyes as she lets him hug her, her arms loosely wrapped around him.</p><p>"Never do that again," she says, pulling away.</p><p>Rio finds it almost sweet, until her eyes find Jen's and all the others staring back at her. She looks away, aimlessly searching the room until she sees Lilia approaching. </p><p>"Is everything alright, children?" She asks. There's a collective sound of awkward affirmation from everyone at the table, nodding and smiling. Rio joins them, albeit unconvincingly. </p><p>Lilia raises an eyebrow but lets it go, turning to Rio, who is currently pressed to Agatha's side. Everyone else has gone back to talking among themselves now that Lilia is here, and Rio feels her shoulders relax. This much she can handle.</p><p>"Awake before nine?" She asks, adjusting Rio's t-shirt that's fallen off her shoulder, "unheard of." </p><p>Rio knows Lilia is currently sizing up the situation. Rio, however, is currently wishing she'd put her sweatshirt back on so she could slink into it like a turtle in it's shell. </p><p>"I was hungry," she says. Looking at Agatha, she gestures to the danish sitting on a green paper plate. "Is that for me?" She asks. </p><p>Agatha nods, nudging Rio's back for her to sit down. "It's strawberry cream cheese," she says. Rio hesitates for a second before awkwardly leaning forward and kissing her on the cheek. Her face is hot as she hides behind her danish.</p><p>"So, what do you think about Agatha coming home with us for the day?" Lilia asks, causing Rio to nearly choke on her food. </p><p>"Uh, what?" She asks, her mouth full. Agatha, who's sat down between her and Billy, turns her head up in alarm.</p><p>"I was just thinking, it's quite full at the Romanov's. Awfully rambunctious, especially with those two," Lilia says, looking over at Kate and Yelena who are covered in glitter and tinsel. "Agatha might like a quiet house to get some extra rest before tonight. What do you think, girls?"</p><p>Rio looks at Agatha, who's mouth is hanging open just slightly, her hand white knuckling her bottle of orange juice. </p><p>"Agatha?" Rio asks. </p><p>"Oh! Um, sure," she says, releasing the orange juice and wiping her palms on her pants. "I'd love to."</p><p>"Excellent! See you girls in a bit," Lilia says, squeezing Rio's shoulder before wandering away. </p><p>Across the table, Jen is looking at Rio with a face that very much says 'what the hell is going on?'. Rio tilts her head toward the door, taking one last bite of her danish and telling Agatha she'll be right back. </p><p>They find a safe spot by the lockers, far enough away for some privacy. Rio is nervous. She hates to admit it, but she feels as though there's a very real chance that Jen is going to be mad at her. </p><p>"Spill," she says, crossing her arms and raising her eyebrows. </p><p>"I'm sure you heard already, but we made out," Rio says casually, checking her nails to avoid looking Jen in the eye. She starts to ramble. "Obviously it wasn't the first time, and I know it seems really toxic and everything to everyone else, but I swear it's <em>real</em> and not just some random, out of the blue thing."</p><p>Jen's eyebrows raise, a small smirk forming. </p><p>Rio rambles on. "And she told me she loved me. I knew that already, to be honest, and I mean I asked her to, but-" </p><p>"Good," Jen says. </p><p>"Sorry?"</p><p>Jen gives a slow smile, pulling Rio into an awkward hug. "I missed the light in your eyes," she says. "I think this is good. I don't like her, but. You do. That's more important."</p><p>Rio pulls back and tries not to be shy about it. In reality, she'd like to start jumping around and squealing, but it isn't really her style. So she beams, instead, feeling her face grow warm. <em>Again</em>.</p><p>"Thanks," she whispers.</p><p>"Just don't forget about me, please," Jen whines, gripping Rio's elbow for assurance.</p><p>"I wouldn't in a million years," Rio promises. </p><hr/><p>Rio feels self conscious. Her huge Sicilian mansion with perfectly manicured landscaping is a stark contrast to the small, single story ranch style she used to live in. That house was hell. But sometimes she thinks she fit in better there. </p><p>Here, she feels like an ink stain on a white shirt. She should be used to that, by now. </p><p>"This is <em>gorgeous</em>. I can't believe you live here!" Agatha exclaims as Rio and Lilia walk her through the tour. Rio's palms are sweaty. There are so many bedrooms. Sunrooms. Bathrooms. This place is like a museum. They have a housekeeper for fucks' sake!</p><p>She tries not to let it show that deep down she's panicking. Sure, Agatha always had more than enough growing up. She lived in the nice house on the nice street, got the best of the best wherever her mother could offer it. Now she has nothing of the sort, and Rio has everything. </p><p>"It's been nice," Rio replies meekly. Lilia walks them up the stairs, and Agatha turns around, reaching her hand out. </p><p>"You deserve nice," she says softly. Rio swallows, managing a small smile. </p><p>Lilia leaves them to it when they reach Rio's bedroom, telling them she's going to go get some rest and advising that they do the same. The tiredness is definitely returning. She barely slept three hours, after all. </p><p>Left by her door— heavy and intricately carved with a poster of PJ Harvey taped to it— Rio and Agatha pause to look each other in the face. Agatha looks like she hasn't slept in years, and maybe she hasn't. Rio wouldn't have a clue.</p><p>"Are you tired?" She asks. The shyness is coming back to her. She feels like she's in middle school again, her crush running rampant. Memories of holding hands in Agatha's floral bed sheets while the sun went down and feeling butterflies so strong she was afraid they'd burst out of her stomach.</p><p>"Sooo tired," Agatha says, her sunken eyes really driving it home. She leans against the door frame, shutting her eyes.</p><p>"C'mon sleepy, there are more comfortable places to sleep than a haunted hallway," Rio says.</p><p>Agatha's head perks up. "Haunted?"</p><p>Rio shrugs, grabbing her hand and leading her inside.</p><p>Her room is huge. Embarrassingly so. Not to mention, clothes are everywhere, her bed is unmade, and she left a window cracked open for twenty-four hours. It's freezing. </p><p>Rio rushes to toss the clothes into a pile and shuts the window. She mutters apologies as she does so, finally understanding that weird thing adults do when they have company and they're apologizing for every individual speck of dust. She can't possibly let Agatha believe she lives like this <em>all of the</em>-</p><p>"This is worse than my room," Agatha says. Rio pauses, her hands clutching the blankets tossed to the end of her bed. She looks up to see Agatha smirking at her in amusement. </p><p>Rio, glaring, reaches for a pillow and sends it flying toward her. </p><p>"Um, hey!" Agatha cries as it hits her square in the chest. She picks it up and hurls it back, just grazing Rio's shoulder. Rio stares like a deer in the headlights, but Agatha is already moving toward her, climbing on the bed, and grabbing a fresh pillow to hit her with.</p><p>Rio gasps, reaching for the pillow by her feet and sending it swinging. </p><p>It becomes a full blown pillow fight. They're practically wrestling, the blankets getting kicked to the floor. If this were a movie, feathers would be flying, they'd be wearing silk pajamas, and-</p><p>Rio is trapped under Agatha, breathing hard, when she puts both hands up in surrender. </p><p>"Stop! Stop, stop," she begs, completely out of breath. "This is starting to feel like the start of a really bad lesbian porno." </p><p>Agatha chokes out a laugh, falling forward into Rio, who can't help herself from giggling. They have tears in their eyes. Agatha has her head on Rio's shoulder as she stares up at the ceiling, catching a strand of Agatha's hair between her fingers and twirling it. </p><p>"That would be hot," Agatha says.</p><p>"Oh my god."</p><p>"What? I'm poor, now. Gotta pay for college somehow."</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, dropping her head onto Agatha's. She so, so tired. Pretty soon they'll have to get up, get ready, and spend their night at a school event with a Santa and a cookie decorating competition. She can't wait for it to be over. </p><p>"We should sleep," she whispers. </p><p>Agatha hums, her eyes already shut. Rio carefully gets up to grab her blanket from the floor, pulling it over them and tucking it around Agatha's other side. Agatha's blinking slowly when Rio rolls into her and presses a kiss to the bridge of her beautiful nose. </p><p>Agatha puffs out a breath, tilting her head to catch Rio's mouth in a soft kiss. </p><p>"Missed you bad," she says. Rio swallows, tongue darting out to taste where Agatha's lips just were. </p><p>"Me too," she murmurs. She shuts her eyes, pulled into arms that smell like home.  </p><hr/><p>Rio is woken by a gentle nudge of her shoulder. She grumbles awake, lifting her head from a pile of wild brown hair. She turns to find Lilia sitting at the edge of the bed. She looks refreshed. Rio probably looks like a bear coming out of hibernation.</p><p>"Rise and shine, missy," Lilia whispers. "I have coffee downstairs."</p><p>Rio perks up at that, nearly waking Agatha. Right. Agatha. Who is very much in Rio's arms right now. Sleeping. Like something deeply precious to her. Because she is. And now everybody knows. Including <em>Lilia</em>.</p><p>"Um…" Rio says, blushing once again. </p><p>"Don't bother, I'm not an idiot," Lilia replies with a knowing smile. "I have no plans to get in the way. But we have a busy night ahead and I expect you both downstairs in five."</p><p>Rio groans, covering her face with her hands. "This has been the most embarrassing week of my life," she whines. </p><p>"Love is embarrassing, dear. See you in five minutes!"</p><p>The process of getting out of bed includes untangling limbs and flopping Agatha around like a rag doll in attempts to wake her. Never in Rio's life has she been the first to wake up at a sleepover with Agatha. It's always this exact scene in reverse. </p><p>"Oh my Goddd," Rio complains, out of breath after manhandling her girlfriend. Wait. Her <em>girlfriend</em>. </p><p>Rio laughs to herself and leans down to plant a kiss right to Agatha's lips. It takes all of two seconds for her mouth to fall open, a soft sound rising from her throat. Rio pulls away, satisfied.</p><p>"You fucking bitch, get up," she says through her smile. </p><p>"You're mean when you wake up first," Agatha mumbles. Rio hoists her up by the arm, moving her hair out of her face. </p><p>"Be awake, you need to get ready," she says. </p><p>"I like it better when you're kissing me," Agatha complains, swaying where she sits hunched over. </p><p>Rio kisses her of course.</p><hr/><p>"This had to be like… a thousand dollars," Agatha says, eyes wide in awe. </p><p>Lilia put her in one of her dresses from back in the day. A gorgeous deep purple evening gown with a sheer bejeweled shawl. It fits her perfectly. Rio can't believe her eyes. </p><p>"Like seriously, it <em>feels</em> expensive."</p><p>Lilia smiles, clearly very happy with herself. This room is full of her most luxurious dresses and costumes. Years ago, she did all kinds of performances in Boston. She was a vocalist, a model, and actress. One of those women who blew away the stage and escaped fame like it was nothing. </p><p>Rio sometimes forgets just how remarkable she is.</p><p>"You must be happy to have someone who appreciates all of this," she says. Lilia hums, reaching for a pair of matching heels.</p><p>"It's lucky she's the same shoe size."</p><p>Agatha slips the heels on and turns to the side, admiring the height. "This is insane," she breathes.</p><p>Rio looks down at herself. She's wearing a wool sweater and beige slacks rolled up at the ankles. Hardly anything to write home about. </p><p>A momentary insanity takes over. "You have anything for me?" She asks. </p><p>Lilia looks at her like she's grown two heads, but she saunters off anyway, right toward the costume rack. Oh, God. </p><p>The two girls watch in anticipation as Lilia sorts through bedazzled body suits, feather boas, and ruffled tutus. A shiver runs through Rio. </p><p>"This should be just perfect," Lilia announces. She turns around to reveal a fitted velvet suit. Dark green and covered in intricate, shiny vines, it looks otherworldly. Rio gasps, slapping her hand over her mouth.</p><p>"You've had that this <em>whole time</em>?" </p><p>Lilia looks near tears when Rio tries it on. She fusses over the thing, adjusting the cuffs and the collar, sorting through undershirt options. They settle on a similar colored silk top with lace adorning the neckline. </p><p>Rio can't tear her eyes from the mirror. She drags Agatha next to her, forcing her to look. "We look so good, dude."</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, cleaning up the edge of her lipstick with her pinky. </p><p>"We always look good, darling."</p><p>Before they know it, Lilia has them posing all over the property. From the spiral staircase to the crypt out back, there's probably hundreds of photos of Agatha and Rio looking like they're headed to the MET. </p><p>Rio is thankful Lilia didn't have her early enough to become the most dedicated theater mom the world's ever seen. Rio isn't cut out for stardom. </p><p>She sneaks her hand into Agatha's as soon as they're in the car, smiling when long, sharp nails scratch the back of her knuckles.</p><p>Maybe everything worked out just as it was meant to. </p><hr/><p>Rio finds Jen and Alice as soon as they arrive. All the other students are scrambling to get final touches on things before the doors open— actors are reciting lines, the musicians warming up their instruments, dancers stretching their feet. </p><p>Rio is reminded of why she prefers to be behind the scenes. </p><p>"Alice almost made me late," Jen complains, shrugging her coat off and hanging it on one of the choir room chairs. This is the convening room where everyone is waiting for Lilia to address them before they scatter. Rio cannot wait to scatter.</p><p>"I did not. You said you'd pick me up and then <em>you</em> forgot," Alice defends. "Holy shit, Rio, you look hot."</p><p>Rio smirks, turning to show off how good her ass looks in these pants.</p><p>"Trying to show off for a certain someone?" Jen teases. There's barely a moment for Rio to roll her eyes before Alice is gasping, putting two and two together. </p><p>"<em>No</em>. You did it with her, didn't you?" She accuses. </p><p>Rio's palm goes to her heart, her expression truly scandalized. "I did <em>not</em>," she insists, before adding with a mumble, "I might later, though."</p><p>Alice smiles approvingly, waving Rio forward into a congratulatory embrace. "That's my girl. Get 'em, tiger."</p><p>"Okay, ew," Rio says, her nose scrunching. "When we do fuck, I'm not telling either of you <em>shit</em>."</p><p>"When you fuck who?" Says a very familiar voice from behind her. </p><p>
<em>Jesus, how many times can a girl blush in a day?</em>
</p><p>"You, Harkness," Jen pipes up. She looks Agatha up and down where she stands beside Rio, smug and so unbelievably gorgeous. </p><p>"Damn, you look hot, too. Don't tell me Calderu let you in her super secret and mysterious walk-in closet," Jen says. Rio tries not to look guilty. </p><p>"No <em>way</em>, I hate you both!"</p><p>Agatha looks completely pleased with herself, tossing her shawl over her shoulder. </p><p>"Be nice and maybe I'll sneak you in, Kale," she promises.</p><p>It's not long before Lilia steps in front of the room and gets the show on the road. Afterwards, the excitement in the room migrates all the way to the auditorium, where Rio stays tucked in the sidelines, watching her friends prep for the stage. </p><p>Just before showtime, Billy find her. He's dressed up as a Christmas tree. Lights twinkling and everything. Rio tries not to laugh.</p><p>"Hey, are you ready for Agatha's solo?" He asks. </p><p>Rio looks at him blankly. "What? What solo?" She asks. </p><p>Billy's eyes widen, but he's saved by the stage manager who's ushering him to his place by the curtain. Rio is left to wonder, looking around frantically for Agatha. She's nowhere to be seen, of course.</p><p>When the lights come on and the show begins, Kate Bishop stands in the center of the stage, ten human trees for a backdrop. The forest hums a solemn song, and she recites a compelling monologue about the tragic undertones of the holiday season.</p><p>Rio is honestly impressed. Kate probably had to write that herself, and she's selling it like a seasoned actress. </p><p>"This Christmas, I ask that you remember the plight of the heartbroken when you cut down the trees. When you sing songs of joy and peace…"</p><p>The curtain closes. The lights go down. </p><p>Rio can't see a thing as the stage is transformed— people running on and off, objects taken and replaced. Until the lights come on again.</p><p>There, on the stage, is a grand piano. Sitting elegantly, wrapped in her shawl, is Agatha. Pretty in Purple. She looks up briefly and catches Rio's eye, lips curling into a soft smile. </p><p>The curtain opens, and Agatha's fingers dance across the keys.</p><p>Rio knows that intro anywhere. It sounds beautiful, of course. But not more beautiful than Agatha's voice. </p><p>"<em>It's coming on Christmas<br/>
They're cutting down trees<br/>
They're putting up reindeer<br/>
And singing songs of joy and peace<br/>
Oh, I wish I had a river<br/>
I could skate away on"</em></p><p>Rio sucks in a breath, feeling the overwhelming urge to cry.</p><p>"<em>I wish I had a river so long<br/>
I would teach my feet to fly<br/>
Oh, I wish I had a river<br/>
I could skate away on<br/>
I made my baby cry</em>"</p><p>Oh, she's crying alright. Crying hard enough to blur her vision. Rio frantically wipes her cheeks, mascara cascading down her face.</p><p>"<em>I made my baby say goodbye</em>"</p><p>Rio is utterly sobbing as she finishes out the song, hardly noticing when the lights dim again and Agatha is walking off stage, straight toward her. </p><p>"Oh, God, are we breaking up?" Agatha asks. She looks pale, clearly so nervous from her performance that her hands are shaking. Rio immediately takes them in her own. </p><p>"Maybe warn a girl before you sing the most emotionally damaging Christmas song ever written," she says, falling into Agatha's embrace, careful not to get mascara on her dress. "That was the most beautiful it's ever sounded."</p><p>Agatha sighs, sounding relieved. "It was an even crazier move when I first learned it. I had no idea I'd be calling you my girlfriend by now," she confesses. </p><p>Rio feels struck by this for a few reasons. For one, the thought that Agatha was thinking of her with any level of fondness before this week makes her heart swell. Secondly, Agatha used to lay beside Rio on her bedroom floor, 'River' playing on full blast as the snow fell outside the window. </p><p>Just like the day Rio kissed her for the first time. It was before, and Agatha had been humming along to the song when she asked, "can I say something really dumb?" </p><p>"Sure," Rio answered. </p><p>Agatha looked up at her from the floor, cheeks turning rosy. "Every time I hear this song, I just think of me and you. Like you're the river, I'm skating away… I don't know."</p><p>Rio was quiet, Agatha going shy. "Sorry, that's weird. Just cause 'River', 'Rio'…Whatever, forget I said that," she rushed out. Rio assured her it wasn't weird, trying to sound as casual as she was able. </p><p>Obviously nothing would ever be casual again, after that day. </p><p>The chaos of backstage resumes around them, but Rio tunes it out. If only the whole world could know the Agatha she does. The thoughtful, playful, loving Agatha, who cries hard and cares deeply. Who was willing to sing a song for a girl in front of an entire auditorium before she had any clue if she loved her back. </p><p>Rio looks into those blue eyes, cupping her cheeks and pulling her into a deep kiss. </p><p>"That song is <em>so</em> us," she says when they part.</p><p>"Oh my God, I can't believe I even said that," Agatha groans, cheeks as rosy as they were that day.</p><p>Rio just laughs, delighted to see someone else blush for a change.</p><hr/><p>They're crouched behind the projector, finally out of their formal attire and back in sweatpants after what's already been the longest night ever. A giant bucket of popcorn sits between them. Rio can't imagine anything better than this.</p><p>With no time to spare, a clanking sound interrupts her bliss as seemingly everyone they know is climbing up the narrow stairs and into the booth, crowding around them.</p><p>"Hey, lovebirds," Natasha announces in a hushed tone. "We came to say congratulations. You're the stars of the evening."</p><p>Agatha winces at the bright screen of Natasha's phone as it's shoved in front of their faces. She bats at it, spilling popcorn out of her hand. </p><p>"Fucking hell, Nat, we're working, here."</p><p>"Oh? Were you working here, too?" She counters. </p><p>Rio's eyes adjust to the light, taking in a photo of her own face attached to Agatha's on the student body's secret Instagram page. The caption says, "Coming on Christmas", followed by a smirk emoji. </p><p>Jen, Alice, Billy, and even Wanda are all hiding behind Natasha, barely containing their laughter. In a way, it's precious that they've joined forces to break the news. Love brings all kinds of people together, Rio thinks.</p><p>"I'm going to murder you all," Agatha says coldly. </p><p>Rio could kiss her again.</p><p><br/>
