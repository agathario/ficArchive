<p>
<span>Rio has never been jealous of a man before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She has no reason to be jealous. She’s smarter than most, successful at her job, and if any man wants to have some sort of caveman-esque dick measuring contest, well, she may keep her dick in the nightstand but she never goes soft before getting her lover off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio is confident, self-assured, some might even say cocky. She’s thirty years old and the top sales representative at the most successful car dealership in Westview— most successful because of </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> numbers for the last five years. She has every intention of becoming head of sales and eventually GM once old Mr. Davis finally retires. It may not be everyone’s career goal, but for the child of a single teenage mother who struggled in every class in school besides theater arts, Rio’s proud of her success. It’s a male-dominated industry, so Rio is used to dealing with men who are jealous of her success, who think that the only reason she’s in her position is because she’s a DEI hire, and men who are jealous of the women she dates because they could never land a woman that hot. She has no reason to be jealous of a man, none whatsoever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, she is. And of all the men to be jealous of, Rio is jealous of Ralph fucking Bohner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She and Ralph started working at the dealership around the same time. He was a decade older than her, having left another dealership after being passed over for a promotion. His first day in the office, he had assumed Rio was an assistant and ordered her to make him a coffee. Rio had been quick to correct his mistake: she was nobody’s coffee bitch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ralph isn’t a bad guy, just slimy in that way that most car salesmen are. Always looking to make the sale, always willing to throw a coworker under the bus to make just a little more money. And he’s actually a damn good salesman, quickly becoming the dealership’s top earner for a year straight after he got hired.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t actually care that much about selling cars at first. She had bills to pay, needed a paycheck, and commissions were good. But something about Ralph’s gloating face every month when it was announced that he was the top earner </span>
<em>
<span>yet again</span>
</em>
<span> really got under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The look on Ralph’s face when Rio’s photo replaced his on the dealership’s Wall of Fame? </span>
<em>
<span>Priceless.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>So why is Rio jealous of Ralph fucking Bohner?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Ralph has a wife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Ralph’s wife might be the most beautiful thing Rio has ever seen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They met at the dealership’s Christmas party the first year after Rio and Ralph began working there, back when Ralph was top earner and Rio didn’t give a shit. The moment Rio saw the older woman she was enthralled: pale skin, long brown hair, sharp features, and bright blue eyes that Rio wanted to get lost in. She was at the bar, ordering a drink, and Rio made her way over and introduced herself. She had never seen the woman before, had no idea who she was married to, or even if she was married, but Rio was ready to put everything on the line for a chance with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Ralph walked over, put his arm around the woman’s waist, and planted a loud smacking kiss on her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And something inside Rio snapped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few months later, Rio became top earner and that was history.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Summer came, and suddenly Rio was seeing a lot more of Ralph’s wife. Agatha— Rio had learned her name through the workplace grapevine— was a history teacher at Westview High, and when the school was on holiday, she had more free time. So at least three times a week, she stopped by the dealership to bring Ralph something for lunch. Sometimes she would bring treats for the entire staff: Her lemon tarts? Delightful. Her chocolate cake? Sinful. Whenever Agatha sashayed into the office, Ralph barely looked up from whatever he was doing, too engrossed in his sales data to even pay attention to his wife as she placed his lunch on his desk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio noticed. Rio notices every single time. She notices the way Agatha’s eyes glitter in the fluorescent lights of the dealership. She notices how Agatha smiles whenever Herb compliments her cooking. She notices how Agatha’s skin turns pink when she’s gotten just a little bit too much sun, and how freckles always begin to appear just a week later. She notices how full her breasts and hips look in her sundresses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah, Rio notices.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What she doesn’t realize is that Agatha notices her, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first time Agatha walks into her office, three years into this whole situation, Rio is eyeball-deep in a finance contract that looks like it was drawn up by a kindergartener. Her head is pounding and she’s ready to put her fist through the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you not like strawberries?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost jumps out of her skin. Agatha is standing in the doorway of her office, a pie container in her hands, giving Rio a look of consternation that Rio doesn’t know how she’s earned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio asks, pulling her earbuds from her ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Every time I bring something with strawberries you ignore it,” Agatha says. “Do you not like strawberries?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s cheeks flush for some reason. “I’m allergic, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha says, then nods. “Well, I brought the rest of the sales team strawberry pie, but I made you lemon meringue. You like lemon, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, yeah,” Rio supplies, still confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha places the pie on the corner of Rio’s desk and doesn’t say another word before disappearing out the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It goes on like that for the rest of that summer. Whenever Agatha brings something Rio doesn’t particularly like for the rest of the office, she brings something else for Rio. Rio isn’t sure what to make of this. It’s very sweet, but also confusing. It means that Agatha has been watching her whenever she brings dessert, watching to know her preferences. Also, no one has ever gone out of their way to make Rio something special before, and Agatha has no real reason to do so. And then, Rio notices that Phil doesn’t like cherries and never eats any of the cherry-flavored desserts, but Agatha never brings Phil anything special.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the next summer rolls around, things change. Agatha still drops by, brings Ralph lunch, brings desserts for the office, brings Rio her own special dessert every once in a while. But Agatha starts dropping by Rio’s office for other things, too. The first time it’s to ask where the ladies’ room is, a simple enough request. And then she just starts showing up in Rio’s office, sitting down in the chair across her desk, and striking up a conversation. It’s smalltalk at first: the weather, the new cars on the showroom floor, the latest office gossip. Rio finds that Agatha knows more about what’s going on in her coworkers’ lives than she does, and the woman doesn’t even work there. Agatha is clever, funny, and bold as brass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How on earth did a woman like her end up with a limp noodle like Ralph fucking Bohner?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next summer, Agatha doesn’t just bring lunch for Ralph, she packs something for Rio as well. They spend nearly an hour each day talking and laughing, getting to know one another. Rio learns that Agatha grew up in an extremely conservative home, that Agatha can’t keep a plant alive to save her life but that her favorite flowers are azaleas, that Agatha has anxiety but cooking helps, that Agatha studied history because she was obsessed with the Salem Witch Trials. She learns that Agatha is forty-two, that she married Ralph when she was nineteen, and that she was six months pregnant at the time. She learns that their son Nicholas just graduated from college with a degree in music, and that he’s currently doing an internship at Disney World. She learns that Agatha listens to a lot of old rock and roll, and Rio introduces her to Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She learns that Agatha got kicked out of an all-girls’ Catholic school when she was sixteen because she got caught kissing a girl named Helen in the library.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nearly has an aneurysm after this revelation. Agatha grins like the Cheshire Cat, sitting back in Rio’s office chair, legs crossed primly, a plate of brownies between them. Like she hadn’t just flipped Rio’s world upside down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha isn’t straight. She’s at least bi-curious, or had been as a teenager.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet Agatha shares a house with Ralph Bohner. Shares a </span>
<em>
<span>life</span>
</em>
<span> with Ralph Bohner. Shares a fucking bed with Ralph fucking Bohner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thinks her head might implode.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then it happens: Rio’s photo on the wall is replaced by Ralph’s. He’s the dealership’s top earner for the month of June by a measly two dollars and thirty-six cents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ralph is gloating. Rio is furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She works her ass off every day, barely takes any breaks, and is always pursuing new sales. The only thing that has changed about her work is the time she spends talking to</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha. Ralph’s wife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next time Agatha stops by Rio’s office, Rio throws the chicken salad croissant and pineapple upside down cake square she brought and dumps it in her wastebasket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck?” Agatha exclaims.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your plan worked,” Rio tells her, voice low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What plan?” Agatha asks, her expression so confused that for a moment Rio genuinely believes she’s innocent. But she quickly pushes that thought aside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your plan to distract me from my work so that your husband could be top earner,” Rio replies. “It’s not going to work anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the actual fuck are you talking about?” Agatha demands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ralph had more sales than me last month,” Rio explains further. “He beat me by two dollars and thirty-six scents, ended my forty-six month streak. Now every time I go to the breakroom, I have to see his stupid face looking at me from the Wall of Fame.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Wall of… </span>
</em>
<span>Well, that explains why he…” Agatha’s cheeks flush bright red for a moment, but then her confusion is replaced with anger. “I don’t give a fuck about him getting top earner. I certainly don’t care enough to come here every day and distract another salesperson.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, sure, you’ve just talked to me because you like me,” Rio huffs, leaning back in her chair and crossing her arms sullenly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do like you!” Agatha exclaims, then her eyes grow round. “Not like that, not like… </span>
<em>
<span>like…</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get it,” Rio scowls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like talking to you,” Agatha tells her. “The only other women I have to talk to are mothers and housewives and they’re so… </span>
<em>
<span>ugh. </span>
</em>
<span>You’re real, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” Rio mutters, picking at her blouse. “You can go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Believe me, I don’t care about Ralph winning some stupid work competition,” Agatha continues. “Honestly, I’d rather he lose. Whenever he wins something or gets some kind of recognition he always expects—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cuts off, her face turning red again, but Rio has heard enough to put the pieces together, and the implication makes something inside her snap. She rises from her chair slowly, like a predator trying not to spook their prey.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me guess, he expects some sexual favors?” Rio asks, her voice low. “And do you give them to him, Agatha? What does he ask for? Some sexy lingerie? A position other than missionary? A little head?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face twists in disgust. “It’s none of your fucking business.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio steps closer. “You know, I was top earner for forty-six months, and I never got a reward.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio can really think about what she’s doing, her lips are on Agatha’s, and Agatha’s back is against the now-closed door of her office. Her mouth tastes like lemon tarts and a richness that is all Agatha. She’s warm and pliant against Rio, her hips soft and full beneath one hand, her hair thick and plush in the other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulls back a moment later, and Agatha gasps for air. Her chest is heaving, the motion making her breasts look delicious in the navy and gold sundress she’s wearing, and it takes every bit of Rio’s self-control not to just bury her face in the pale cleavage on display.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me to stop,” Rio says, her own voice breathless. “If you tell me to stop, I will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks at her with those blazing blue eyes and cocks her head to the side, reaching up to wrap her arms around Rio’s shoulders and bury her fingers in her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you wanted your reward?” Agatha says, voice low and raspy.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kisses her again, open mouthed and filthy, and Agatha responds in kind. Rio licks into her mouth, tasting her, taking everything she has to give. She wants to touch and kiss and bite every inch of this woman, to mark her, if not visually then viscerally, so that even if the world doesn’t know she’s Rio’s, Agatha won’t be able to forget.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands go from Rio’s hair to the collar of her shirt, gripping tightly, holding on and pulling her impossibly closer. Rio’s hands aren’t idle; one tugs at Agatha’s hair, pulling her hair back and opening her mouth even more for Rio’s possession, the other skims up her side, over the floral fabric of her dress, to cup her breast. She can feel Agatha’s nipple hard beneath the fabric, and her thumb traces over the nub once, twice, three times before she squeezes the soft flesh and Agatha moans into her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulls back, breaking their kiss, and looks down as her fingers tug at the neckline of the dress. Agatha nods frantically, and she breathes out a barely audible </span>
<em>
<span>yes. </span>
</em>
<span>Rio tugs at the fabric, until Agatha’s breasts are both loose, trussed up on top of the cups of her sundress. They’re perfect, round and pale and topped with dusky pink nipples that pebble and strain in the cold air of the car dealership.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally gives into her earlier urge and ducks her head, burying her face in Agatha’s cleavage, and she’s pleased to find that her breasts are just as soft as she imagined, perhaps even moreso. She presses hot, open-mouthed kisses to the sides of Agatha’s breasts, sucking and licking at the velvety skin before she draws a nipple between her lips and sucks gently before nibbling every so slightly with her teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Fuck, Rio,” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha hisses, hips bucking off the wall as Rio soothes the nipple with her tongue. “Fuck, fuck, </span>
<em>
<span>fuuuuck.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh, easy sweetheart,” Rio murmurs, switching sides to kiss the other breast. “Wouldn’t want anyone to hear. Wouldn’t want anyone to know I’m finally getting my reward.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets out a sharp but quiet hum. “Feels like I’m the one getting rewarded— </span>
<em>
<span>ah, fuck!”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Does he do this?” Rio asks, looking up at her before kissing the inside skin of her breast. “Does he play with these gorgeous tits? Does he worship them like they deserve to be worshipped?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha gasps as Rio sucks at her nipple. “He— He likes them, but— he just grabs and squeezes— </span>
<em>
<span>oh, god, Rio.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” Rio grunts. She doesn’t want that mental image in her head. “If you were mine, I’d take my time. I’d kiss every inch of your skin, worship you like the goddess you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, oh yes,” Agatha huffs, reaching for Rio’s face. She draws her up and Rio kisses her again, all teeth and tongue and breath. Rio reaches down and tugs at Agatha’s skirt, pulling it up to her waist, until finally she can reach underneath and feel the smooth skin of her thighs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d mark you,” Rio says, moving to kiss across Agatha’s cheek, down her jaw, to the line of her neck. “I’d make sure everyone knew who you belonged to.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Yes,” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha whimpers as Rio’s fingers find the apex of her thighs. To Rio’s surprise, she doesn’t find cotton, or silk, or even lace. Instead, her fingers immediately meet coarse curls and molten heat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulls back, meeting Agatha’s wide-eyed gaze, and grins fiercely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, sweetheart, is this for me?” Rio asks, sliding her fingers through wet folds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opens her mouth to answer, but Rio finds the hard nub of her clit at that exact moment, and instead of words she gasps and her eyes flutter shut.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look at me,” Rio orders, and Agatha’s eyes open again, the pale blue almost completely overtaken by blown pupils. “You came in here, in this dress, with no panties. I can only think of one reason for that, and that reason is because you want to be fucked. Is that right?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Y— Yes,” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha stutters as Rio spreads her fingers in a V-shape around her clit, stimulating but not quite touching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I know you didn’t do it for him,” Rio murmurs. “Did you do it for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha admits, but there’s no shame in her voice, only desperation. Her hips buck against Rio’s hand, but she holds her steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This isn’t the first time,” Rio says, mind putting the pieces together in spite of her arousal being a prominent distraction. “How long?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leans down and sucks a kiss into the side of Agatha’s neck, hard enough to bruise, consequences be damned, and she begins rubbing circles around Agatha’s clit in earnest. Agatha whimpers and bites her lip, hips bucking as Rio touches her. When Rio is satisfied the pale skin is marked, she pulls back and slows her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I asked you a question, Agatha. How long?” she repeats.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moves her fingers from Agatha’s clit, down, through the wet heat of her. She circles Agatha’s entrance with her two middle fingers, and Agatha’s hips buck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio growls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since the day I asked you where the ladies’ room was,” Agatha replies, her words barely more than a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, Rio is frozen. She isn’t sure what she expected, but to hear that Agatha had been coming to this office with no panties for literally years now, in anticipation of possibly fucking her, that Agatha had wanted her for that long…</span>
</p><p>
<span>She enters Agatha to the knuckle in one swoop, and Agatha bites down on her fully-clothed shoulder to muffle the scream that threatens to escape her throat. Rio wastes no time, moving her hand, thrusting in and out of Agatha with as much force as she dares against the door.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Fuck yes,” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha hisses, once she removes her teeth from Rio’s blazer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve been mine this whole time,” Rio grunts. “Say it, say you’re mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I’m yours, all yours, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck!” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha shouts, before Rio silences her with another kiss. When Rio pulls away, too breathless to continue, Agatha continues a soft mantra in her ear, </span>
<em>
<span>Yours, yours, yours…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t care about sales, she doesn’t care about her photo on the wall, she doesn’t care about any of that. All she cares about is the feel of Agatha around her fingers, how tight and wet she is, how her hips buck to meet Rio’s every thrust, how sweet her breath feels against Rio’s cheek as Rio fucks her against the door of her office.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More,” Agatha whimpers, and Rio complies. With her free hand she reaches down and grabs one of Agatha’s thighs, raising it up over her hip, opening her up more. Then she slides out with two fingers and thrusts back in with three, curling them so that she hits that spongy spot just inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, yes, Rio, like that, </span>
<em>
<span>just like that. </span>
</em>
<span>Fuck me, fuck me, please baby, </span>
<em>
<span>yes, Rioooooo—”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio can feel Agatha getting tighter around her fingers, her body going taut, nails digging into Rio’s back so hard that she can feel it even through her blazer. Rio keeps her pace, grinds her palm even harder into Agatha’s clit, until—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha comes sobbing Rio’s name, her voice strained in Rio’s ear. Her body tightens around Rio’s fingers like a vice, until she can barely move, but still she keeps up minute movements, prolonging Agatha’s pleasure, then easing her through the aftershocks. Her entire body quivers in Rio’s arms, as her breath slowly returns to normal. As Rio pulls her fingers free, Agatha’s arms tighten on her shoulders, and the leg still wrapped around her hips flexes as well, keeping Rio close. Agatha buries her face in Rio’s neck, breathing her in, and Rio lets her, holding her there, just as unwilling to let the moment go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” she says, finally, her voice soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, this is—” Agatha begins, her voice weak, but she cuts herself off and clears her throat. Finally she moves her leg from around Rio, and Rio lets go of her thigh so it can drop back to the floor. Agatha looks at her with keen blue eyes, but deep down Rio can still see hunger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabs her lapels and shoves her away, backing Rio up until her hips hit the edge of her desk. She pushes Rio’s blazer off her shoulders, then her deft fingers unbutton Rio’s blouse before Rio fully realizes what’s happening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio repeats as Agatha drops to her knees and unfastens her slacks. “What are you—?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You wanted your reward,” Agatha says, batting her eyelashes. She’s an absolute vision: hair a mess, dress wrinkled, breasts still spilling out over the neckline, a dark purple bruise blooming at the base of her throat. “And you were top earner how many months in a row? Forty…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Forty-six,” Rio replies as Agatha’s hands tug at her hips, easing her pants and underwear down in one move. Rio hisses as the bare skin of her ass hits the cold wood of her desk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grins and licks her lips as she pushes Rio’s thighs apart. “I have some catching up to do.”</span>
