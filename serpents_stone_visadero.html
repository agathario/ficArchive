<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha was thrice blessed: by Demeter, by prophecy, by birth into power.</p>
<p>Thrice cursed: caged, controlled, claimed by a mother who saw only her value.</p>
<p>Then Rio came: an alpha who should have been beneath her notice, who smelled like earth and honey.</p>
<p>When their hands first touched, the vision tore through her. Sunlight through olive leaves. Bodies tangled in sheets. A tongue that split and tasted acrid. Dark eyes hollowed out into nothingness.</p>
<p>She saw what loving Rio would cost.</p>
<p>For one night, Agatha chose freedom.</p>
<p>The gods made her pay for it.</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>Before her world narrowed to the dark and cold echoes against blood-dampened stone, there was the seaside. </span></p><p><span>She remembered that.</span></p><p><span>The sky bright and beautiful. The tides tickling her feet before pulling back in search of more trinkets to deliver to her. </span></p><p><span>When she shook out her hair, salt would fall from it, showering down around her.</span></p><p><span>It was like being surrounded by a field of falling stars (she remembered those, too).</span></p><p><span>Only after she spent hours baking under the sun would she return home, running barefoot across tile that had grown hot during the day.</span></p><p><span>And always she would end up wishing she had stayed with her feet in the water a little longer.</span></p><p><span>At the water’s edge, she wasn’t alone. The gulls were always there with her, screaming as they fought over scraps the fishermen left behind.</span></p><p><span>In those days, omens were still just stories. The birds and winds spoke of other people's tragedies. </span></p><p><span>She could still run home afterward, salt-crowned and sun-drunk, believing she would always be separate from the sorrows she witnessed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was twelve the first time she understood that they were trying to tell her something.</span></p><p><span>That morning, she'd been searching for sea glass when three dark masked gulls flew inland, their wings beating against the wind's direction. </span></p><p><span>Something felt different as she watched the trio disappear toward the city, a cool finger of dread trailing down her spine despite the sun wrapped around her shoulders.</span></p><p><span>By evening, the harbormaster's son had drowned.</span></p><p><span>But the uneasy feeling didn’t abate, even when they pulled his body from the nets and placed to lay in state, back in bed in his mother’s home where he belonged.</span></p><p><span>Misfortune always came in threes. The next death came two days later. </span></p><p><span>A fisherman's wife, collapsed in the agora, lemons tumbling out of her carefully woven basket.</span></p><p><span>Then a child, taken by the fever in the night. Just the day before, Agatha had watched her dance with a ribbon on the theatre steps.</span></p><p><span>Agatha said nothing. What was there to say? That she'd seen birds flying the wrong way? That her skin had prickled with knowing? </span></p><p><span>She was already barely tolerated, if not actively disliked. Would they call her mad? Worse would be if they called her cursed, a bearer of misfortune rather than its witness.</span></p><p><span>So she kept the knowledge tightly folded inside herself.</span></p><p><span>She returned to the shore each morning, but now she watched the gulls with a different hunger. </span></p><p><span>No longer looking for shells or smooth stones, but for patterns.</span></p><p><span>Next time…. Next time, she would know better what to do. Perhaps in this way, if mortals could never be pleased, she would at least find the favor of a sympathetic god.</span></p><p><span>Her mother found her one afternoon, crouched in the sand, sketching the flight paths of cormorants with a stick. Circles within circles, arcs that cut across each other at a sharp angle. She stared so intensely at the sand reflecting the blinding sun that it made her eyes hurt.</span></p><p><span>"Come home, Agatha," her mother said, voice tired in a way that was far more common among laborers than council speakers. "It's not healthy, spending so much time alone. Unnatural. What calls you away so?"</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn't look up. The pattern wasn't finished yet. Three more lines and she would see…</span></p><p><span>Her mother's hand closed around her wrist, and though her touch could never be called gentle, this one hurt.</span></p><p><span>"I asked you a question."</span></p><p><span>The stick fell from Agatha's fingers, and words came tumbling out before she could stop them, childish and desperate in their honesty. </span></p><p><span>"The birds, Mother. They're trying to tell me something. Something's going to happen. Something bad. They’ve been circling the temple for three days now, always at dawn, always seven of them. Seven is the number of—"</span></p><p><span>She stopped. </span></p><p><span>The weariness was gone from her mother’s face. In its place was something bright and sharp, attention so focused it made Agatha's stomach clench. </span></p><p><span>Her mother was looking at her the way she looked at the other council members during debates. The way she’d seen cats approach mice who were preoccupied with nibbling at grain.</span></p><p><span>"Tell me, darling," her mother said, her voice no longer tired at all. "Go on and tell me what the birds are saying."</span></p><p><span>Agatha's mouth went dry. "I... I don't know exactly. Just that something's coming. Something to do with the temple, or the priests, or…"</span></p><p><span>"When?"</span></p><p><span>"Before the new moon, I think."</span></p><p><span>Her mother's grip on her wrist tightened, then released. Agatha rubbed at the indent left behind. Her mother crouched down, bringing her face level with Agatha's, and smiled. </span></p><p><span>Agatha couldn't remember the last time she'd seen her mother smile. It looked unnatural on her face, the way it stretched her thin lips and crinkled her eyes. She was almost certain she’d never seen such an expression directed at her.</span></p><p><span>"My clever girl," her mother said softly. "My blessed, clever girl. The gods have given you a gift."</span></p><p><span>Something in Agatha's chest constricted. This was wrong. She had expected dismissal, perhaps punishment for foolishness. Not this.</span></p><p><span>"We'll need to be careful," her mother continued, speaking more to herself now than to Agatha.</span></p><p><span>"Test it first, quietly. If you're right about the temple..." She stood abruptly, brushing sand from her chiton. "Come. We're going home. You'll wash and dress properly. And Agatha—"</span></p><p><span>She looked down at her daughter with that same bright, calculating expression.</span></p><p><span>"You will tell no one else about this. No one. Do you understand? This is ours."</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, though she didn't understand at all. She only knew that her mother's hand stayed on her shoulder as they walked back, but it didn’t hurt this time.</span></p><p><span>Yet, that sick feeling in her stomach (the one she'd learned to recognize as a warning) hadn't gone away.</span></p><p><span>If anything, it had gotten worse.</span></p><p><span>She should have listened to that feeling. She should have run back to the water’s edge and never left, just kept running until she finally touched the line that broke between the sky and sea.</span></p><p><span>But the gods rarely grant mercies to those who reach for too much and dare to see too clearly.</span></p><p><span>Closing her eyes, she tried to remember if the feet of the gulls had been yellow-orange or more orange-yellow. It seemed important, now, to get the details right. She had been careless with her memories before and it had cost her.</span></p><p><span>She heard not a squawk but a whimper, and sighed before turning toward the sound.</span></p><p><span>"Quiet now. You've already made yourself known. I have not forgotten you so soon."</span></p><p><span>Another whimper, wet and desperate.</span></p><p><span>"Shh. This is what you wanted, was it not?" She moved toward the man slowly, her bare feet whispering against stone. "You came to lay with me. So rest your head now."</span></p><p><span>There was a rustle as a head shook, or tried to. The paralysis made even small movements agony, she knew. It was a terrible fate being trapped inside one's own drowning body.</span></p><p><span>She wasn’t completely without sympathy.</span></p><p><span>"No?" She tilted her head, considering him in the darkness. Though eyes had long ago adjusted to the absence of light, his had not. </span></p><p><span>He couldn't see her yet, could only hear her voice circling closer. </span></p><p><span>"Then why did you come? To look upon me? To call me monster?"</span></p><p><span>She paused, letting the silence stretch out until she was certain it would not echo further.</span></p><p><span>"To slay me?"</span></p><p><span>The quality of his breathing changed and she could taste his sweat on the air.</span></p><p><span>"Ah." She lowered herself to the ground, folding one leg beneath her as she stretched out beside him, close enough that he would feel the warmth of her body in the cave's chill. </span></p><p><span>Here she was close enough to smell the salt still clinging to his clothes, confirming he’d arrived by boat. They usually did. </span></p><p><span>"How disappointing. The ones who come for violence are always so much less interesting than the ones who come for pleasure. At least those ones are honest about their appetites."</span></p><p><span>She propped herself up on one elbow, studying his paralyzed form. </span></p><p><span>He was young. They always were, these would-be heroes.</span></p><p><span>Sent by mothers who wanted to elevate their sons' stations, most likely. An omega son who slayed a monster might be permitted to choose his own alpha, rather than be chosen. An alpha son might earn a council seat, a name that meant something beyond his father's shadow.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps he'd volunteered, eager to make a name for himself.</span></p><p><span>To become the man who killed the monster.</span></p><p><span>She breathed in slowly, tasting the air.</span></p><p><span>"Did they tell you I was beautiful once?" she asked softly, tracing a finger along the stone floor beside his rigid shoulder, not touching him directly. She had no need for that.</span></p><p><span>"They always mention that part. The tragedy is so much more appealing when the monster used to be lovely. As if my pretty face was the only thing lost. The only thing worth mourning by the world."</span></p><p><span>She leaned closer, her breath warm against his ear. This close, she could smell the scent-dampening herbs they'd made him rub into his skin. Wormwood and ash. As if hiding what he was would protect him.</span></p><p><span>"Would you like to know what you lost? Coming here?"</span></p><p><span>A strangled sound escaped his frozen throat.</span></p><p><span>"Your mother's hope, certainly. Your father's name and pride. Any children you might have sired." Her voice was almost tender now.</span></p><p><span>"The chance to proudly bear the mark of a mate against your neck. To know the weight of someone's teeth in that soft place, claiming you. Cherishing you."</span></p><p><span>Her fingers drifted closer to his throat, hovering over the unmarked skin there.</span></p><p><span>"But those are far away now, aren't they? It’s hard to think about in the abstract. Let me tell you what you've lost in terms you can understand."</span></p><p><span>She shifted, draping herself more fully alongside him, her body a line of heat against his paralyzed side. Her scent would be flooding his senses now. </span></p><p><span>Idly, Agatha wondered what she smelled like these days. She couldn’t fathom it registering as human anymore.</span></p><p><span>"You’ve lost the ability to scream. To run. To close your eyes when you finally see what has become of me."</span></p><p><span>A soft hissing began above them, like wind through grass, like the whisper of scales on scales echoing off the chamber walls.</span></p><p><span>"To look away," she murmured, her lips nearly brushing the unmarked column of his throat, "when my darlings get hungry."</span></p><p><span>She could feel his pulse hammering beneath skin that would never bear a mate's claim.</span></p><p><span>She couldn’t allow such a waste.</span></p><p><span>The hissing grew louder, more insistent. Eager, writhing with appetites she no longer fully controlled. </span></p><p><span>Sometimes she thought they were separate creatures entirely. Other times she knew they were simply the hungriest parts of herself, given form and fang.</span></p><p><span>She pushed herself up slowly, deliberately, letting him feel her weight shift away. The loss of her warmth would cause its own kind of terror in the cave's chill.</span></p><p><span>"I'm going to do you a kindness," she said, settling back on her heels beside him. Above her, the serpents swayed and dipped, their scales catching what little light filtered into the cave's depths. </span></p><p><span>Their tongues flickered out, tasting his fear on the air.</span></p><p><span>"You see, most men who come here die seeing. And what they see in those final moments..." She shook her head slowly. "It breaks something. Some die of the horror before my girls even reach them. Their hearts simply... stop. Fear can be as fatal as venom, I've learned."</span></p><p><span>One of the serpents, the largest of them, lowered its head toward his face. Its black eyes gleamed.</span></p><p><span>"So I'll spare you that, at least." Her voice was soft now, almost gentle. "You won't have to see what I've become. What you tried to destroy."</span></p><p><span>She leaned forward, her hand hovering over his forehead.</span></p><p><span>"We will take your eyes first. Quickly. I promise you that much."</span></p><p><span>A tear rolled from the corner of his paralyzed eye, cutting a track down his temple.</span></p><p><span>"Hush now," she whispered. "This is the mercy. Trust me. You don't want to watch what comes after."</span></p><p><span>She sat back, her hand falling away.</span></p><p><span>"Darlings," she said simply. "His eyes. Be quick about it."</span></p><p><span>The hissing rose to a fever pitch. And then an unnatural silence followed by a wet popping sound.</span></p><p><span>She turned her face away, toward the cave mouth, while her darlings fed. </span></p><p><span>Shame had never stopped hunger.</span></p><p><span>And she had been hungry for so very long.</span></p>

<p><span>Agatha’s chambers were comfortable. Silk curtains, plush cushions, a bed large enough for three. Her mother had spared no expense in making her cage beautiful, and after her presentation, it was ensured that it was comfortable as well.</span></p><p><span>There was a lovely window looking out, from which she could see the winding steps down to the lower districts. </span></p><p><span>On days when the wind was right, she could smell honeyed pastries wafting right up to her sill, or catch the plucking of a lyre as a musician wandered the lower alleys.</span></p><p><span>Not long after her eighteenth year began, it had been deemed too dangerous for her to walk the streets unattended, though by whom her mother refused to say, instead obliquely waving the threat of unregistered alphas who may have passed the border or slipped their work sites.</span></p><p><span>Agatha doubted that, though. Her designation—that of a daughter of Demeter, a life-bringer, blessed by the goddess of harvest and fertility—was a gift the gods themselves had chosen for her. </span></p><p><span>No froth-mouthed child of Ares would be fool enough to try to cross her, alpha or not. </span></p><p><span>Alphas were made for war and labor, their bloodlust a curse as much as a gift. Ares' children through and through, born with violence and lust in their veins and little else. Useful for defending the city walls or breaking earth for planting, but hardly sophisticated enough for real ambitions. They just didn’t have the foresight.</span></p><p><span>The betas, touched by neither war nor fertility, were said to be Athena’s chosen: balanced, practical, the sensible backbone of society.</span></p><p><span>They ran the trades, managed the merchants’ guilds, kept the city functioning while others made history. Respectable, if unremarkable.</span></p><p><span>Privately, Agatha suspected Athena had simply been assigned the task of minding the middling. Someone had to give the unexceptional a patron, after all.</span></p><p><span>There was no harm in letting them mistake usefulness for importance.</span></p><p><span>Omegas were not only blessed once by the divine, but twice. Favored by Demeter, and marked by Hera for their role in carrying bloodlines forward, they were living vessels of continuity and inheritance.</span></p><p><span>To harm an omega—particularly one marked by prophecy, as Agatha was—was to invite divine retribution and public outrage in equal measure.</span></p><p><span>In theory, it made her untouchable.</span></p><p><span>In practice, it made her property.</span></p><p><span>Her mother’s warnings were just another kind of chain, prettier than most, but a binding nonetheless.</span></p><p><span>Misfortune came in threes, but so did fortune, apparently. Agatha had learned that sometimes, many times, more often than not, perhaps, the two were impossible to tell apart.</span></p><p><span>There was first her gift. The ability to read omens in flight and entrails, to hear what the gods whispered on the wind. If she'd been born without it, she might have lived an ordinary life. She thought that she would never have married and perhaps grown old watching the sea.</span></p><p><span>If she'd presented as beta instead, she could have set up a modest shrine on some hillside. She could have gathered the gossip of farmers and fishwives, weighed in on petty disputes over boundary stones, and borrowed tools. She would read fortunes for a few shining coins and a hot meal. A simple life, but one entirely her own.</span></p><p><span>Agatha had fantasized about it, late at night when sleep wouldn't come. The beta seer with her humble duties, her garden of herbs, her freedom to walk where she pleased. No silk cushions but no locked doors either.</span></p><p><span>Another fantasy came less often, usually tinged with a rippling feeling at the back of her neck she did not wish to examine. </span></p><p><span>If she'd been omega without the prophecy, she might have been married off young to some appropriately matched alpha. </span></p><p><span>She'd seen such arrangements. They didn’t seem that terrible. Omegas draped in fine silk and woven things, their alpha devoted and useful, kept properly under thumb. </span></p><p><span>The alpha would work themselves ragged to keep their omega satiated: bringing gifts, providing comfort, offering their body and strength and devotion like sacrifices at an altar. Every instinct redirected toward pleasing one person.</span></p><p><span>It was what alphas were for, after all. To have their violence softened and repurposed into loyalty.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes, she allowed herself to imagine it.</span></p><p><span>Some nameless alpha kneeling at her feet, eyes dark with want, rough hands careful only with her. Watching her like she was the axis of their world.</span></p><p><span>Wanting nothing except her comfort. Her approval. Her touch.</span></p><p><span>Someone strong choosing softness for her. Someone fierce being gentle only with her.</span></p><p><span>It was a dangerous thought.</span></p><p><span>If she'd been only omega, only seer, she might have had choices. But she was both—twice gifted, the priests had proclaimed at her presentation ceremony. Blessed by Demeter, marked by prophecy, and daughter of a rising senator, born into a family that understood exactly how to leverage divine favor for earthly power.</span></p><p><span>The mathematics of her life were simple: one gift might have been manageable. Two would have been valuable. But three? </span></p><p><span>Blessed by Demeter. Marked by Hera. Claimed by prophecy.</span></p><p><span>Three seals on a life that was never meant to be her own.</span></p><p><span>Too precious to waste on simple happiness. Too rare to risk on anything as frivolous as freedom.</span></p><p><span>Three, as she'd learned young, was the number of things coming that couldn't be stopped.</span></p><p><span>"You're brooding again."</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn't turn at the sound of her mother's voice. "I'm taking the auspices."</span></p><p><span>"You're staring at birds like a child. I've brought the Councillor's wife to see you. She wants to know if her husband's latest trade venture will succeed." </span></p><p><span>Her mother's hand settled on Agatha's shoulder. "Do try to look mystical. She's paying triple for a private audience."</span></p><p><span>"The birds say—"</span></p><p><span>"The birds say what we tell them to. Now come."</span></p><p align="center"><span><strong>---</strong></span></p><p><span>A half hour later, the Councillor's wife left with her fortune clutched close to her chest: modest success, no dramatic losses, exactly what she'd paid for. </span></p><p><span>Her mother had gone to see the woman out, and would return shortly to parade in the next supplicant. Another merchant wanting to know about harvest yields. Another politician seeking advantage over a rival. Another and another and another until she’d wrung every coin from each greased hand.</span></p><p><span>She was interrupted by a knock at the door. Her mother never knocked, and if she did it wouldn’t be so tentative and uncertain.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned, irritation flaring. “Appointment only,” she called. “My mother handles the schedule—”</span></p><p><span>And then she smelled it.</span></p><p><span>Olive brine and heavy soil and something wild beneath it, like wind carrying the fruit of a far-off land over open water. Not the perfumed oils of wealthy omegas, or the careful florals of betas.</span></p><p><span>Something untamed.</span></p><p><span>Something that did not belong in silk-draped rooms and scheduled destinies.</span></p><p><span>Her breath caught before she knew why.</span></p><p><span>“I—” A voice came from the other side. Female. Low. Slightly rough, like someone unused to speaking through closed doors. “I was told you might see me. I can pay.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shouldn’t. Her mother would be back any moment. Would be furious at the breach of protocol.</span></p><p><span>But that scent answered for her.</span></p><p><span>“Come in,” she heard herself say.</span></p><p><span>The door opened slowly, and her breath escaped in one quick burst of an exhale.</span></p><p><span>The woman in the doorway was slightly taller than her with dark hair pulled back in a simple braid that fell over one shoulder. From her clothes, it was clear this wasn’t her usual client. Not a merchant’s daughter. Not a politician’s niece.</span></p><p><span>Her boots still carried the dust of her walk here. She must have come from some distance.</span></p><p><span>Then she noticed her face.</span></p><p><span>It was the kind poets gave to heroes at the start of their epic.</span></p><p><span>Sun-warmed skin. Sharp cheekbones. A mouth tightened by nerves but clearly more inclined to smile than frown.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes were dark as wet earth, steady and deep and unsettlingly familiar.</span></p><p><span>The woman stepped inside, then stopped. Her nostrils flared slightly, and something shifted in her expression. Agatha would have called it recognition if that were possible.</span></p><p><span>"You're the seer," the woman said.</span></p><p><span>"I am." Agatha's voice came out steadier than she felt. "And you?"</span></p><p><span>"I have questions. I was told you read fortunes. That you can see... paths. Futures."</span></p><p><span>"That's one way to describe it." Agatha moved back toward her reading table, needing the familiar territory. “May we trade a question for a name?”</span></p><p><span>The woman paused, then lifted her chin slightly.</span></p><p><span>“Rio,” she said.</span></p><p><span>The name was short, not one she had heard spoken before. It felt strangely important.</span></p><p><span>Agatha found herself repeating it without meaning to.</span></p><p><span>“Rio.”</span></p><p><span>She thought she imagined another echo, a stone dropped in water rippling out.</span></p><p><span>Clearing her throat, she shook out her hair. "What future do you seek, Rio?"</span></p><p><span>"I want to know if there's another path for me," Rio said quietly. "Something other than what I'm—what's expected."</span></p><p><span>Agatha's fingers stilled on the arrangement of bones and stones. "What is expected of you?"</span></p><p><span>Rio's hand drifted to the blade hung low at her hip. "I'm alpha."</span></p><p><span>The word hung in the air between them.</span></p><p><span>Agatha should have known. Should have recognized it in the scent, the build, the way Rio held herself like she was trying to take up less space than her body demanded. But there was something about her that didn't fit the mold of Ares' children. There was no aggressive posturing or crude swagger here.</span></p><p><span>"I see." Agatha kept her voice neutral. "And alphas are expected to be soldiers. Warriors."</span></p><p><span>"Or laborers. Guards. Mercenaries." Rio's voice was flat. "Anything that involves breaking things or bleeding." She stopped, and a flash of vulnerability crossed her before she flinched as if she’d been struck. "I want to tend earth, not water it with blood. They tell me that's not what I'm made for."</span></p><p><span>There was such longing in her voice that Agatha felt something twist in her chest in recognition.</span></p><p><span>"Sit," she said, gesturing to the cushions across from her table. "Let me see what the gods will show."</span></p><p><span>Rio sat, moving with a grace that seemed at odds with her designation. Up close, her scent was stronger—that olive and salt, but underneath it something sweeter. Not quite sweet as honey, not as sharp as lemon. Something Agatha couldn’t put a name to no matter how much she wished to.</span></p><p><span>She forced herself to focus instead on the bones, the stones, the tools of her craft.</span></p><p><span>"Give me your hand," she said.</span></p><p><span>Rio extended her right hand, palm up. Agatha reached for it, meaning to trace the lines there, to read what the gods had written in flesh.</span></p><p><span>Instead, something tore open.</span></p><p><span>Light and heat and memory crashed through her all at once.</span></p><p><em><span>Sunlight through olive leaves.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rough hands gentle in dark hair</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><em><span>Salt air and laughter</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><em><span>A small house with a garden</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><em><span>Two bodies tangled in sheets</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><em><span>Mouths meeting, desperate and tender</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><em><span>A tongue that grew long then split and tasted acrid.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Bloodied walls. The taste of copper</span></em><span>. </span><em><span>Something, writhing and roiling. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Dark eyes full of grief. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Too full. Then hollowed out into nothingness. </span></em></p><p><span>Agatha gasped and jerked her hand back. The bowl of bird bones clattered to the floor, scattering across stone and rolling under the furniture.</span></p><p><span>"Seer!" Rio started to rise, concern creasing her brow. "Are you alright?"</span></p><p><span>"I'm fine." Agatha's voice was strangled. Her heart hammered against her ribs. "Just—the vision was strong. Unexpected."</span></p><p><span>"What did you see?" Rio's hand hovered between them, uncertain whether to reach out again.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at that hand. Those calloused fingers that in her vision had traced patterns on her skin, had made her—</span></p><p><span>"You saw something bad," Rio said quietly. "About my future."</span></p><p><span>"No." The word came out too quickly. "Not bad. Just... complicated."</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned forward slightly, and gods, Agatha could smell her even stronger now. It made her thoughts scatter like birds spooked and startled. "Tell me. Please. I can handle it. Whatever it is. Not knowing is worse."</span></p><p><span>"The path you seek," Agatha said carefully, "The gods show it's possible. You could have your farm, your peaceful life. But..."</span></p><p><span>"But?"</span></p><p><span>"But there's a choice coming. A fork in the road. And the path to what you want..." She met Rio's eyes, and felt that pull again, that recognition. "It goes through something you don't expect."</span></p><p><span>"Through what?"</span></p><p><em><span>Through me</span></em><span>, Agatha thought.</span></p><p><span>“I can’t see clearly,” she lied. “The vision was fragmented. But Rio—” She leaned forward. “Are you certain you’re alpha?”</span></p><p><span>Rio went very still.</span></p><p><span>For a moment, Agatha thought she’d gone too far.</span></p><p><span>Then Rio’s gaze sharpened. Her jaw set. Her lips parted, revealing sharp, unmistakable canines.</span></p><p><span>Something fierce and frightened and proud crossed her face all at once.</span></p><p><span>“I’m certain,” she said quietly, voice dropping.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard. "I had to ask. You're not like—you don't seem like—"</span></p><p><span>"Like other alphas?" Rio's expression softened, but those sharp teeth were still visible when she spoke. "I know. Trust me, I've been told of my defects."</span></p><p><span>"That's not what I meant."</span></p><p><span>"Isn't it?"</span></p><p><span>"No," Agatha said softly. "I meant you seem... more."</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked. "More?"</span></p><p><span>"More than just Ares' child." Agatha's fingers moved of their own accord, resting on top of Rio’s hand. Her knuckles were scarred but her hand was warm. "The gods showed me strength in you, yes. But also patience. Care. The kind of devotion it takes to tend growing things, to wait for harvest, to—"</span></p><p><span>She stopped, realizing she was saying too much, revealing too much at once. Projecting her own voice instead of the gods. A mistake for any seer.</span></p><p><span>Rio had gone very still.</span></p><p><span>Then, slowly, she turned her hand beneath Agatha’s, their palms fitting together without either of them quite meaning to.</span></p><p><span>A quiet sound left her—half breath, half laugh, disbelieving.</span></p><p><span>“You must be a seer, no other would believe such things,” Rio murmured.</span></p><p><span>Her thumb brushed, almost accidentally, against Agatha’s wrist.</span></p><p><span>It sent a small, dangerous shiver up her arm.</span></p><p><span>Outside, Agatha heard her mother’s voice in the hallway, sharp with instruction as she spoke to a servant. She would be here in moments.</span></p><p><span>The reading was over.</span></p><p><span>Rio would leave. Walk back out into the world. Take this moment with her like something half-remembered from a dream.</span></p><p><span>Unless.</span></p><p><span>“Come back,” Agatha heard herself say. “Tonight. After dark.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes widened. “What?”</span></p><p><span>"The vision. I need to understand it better. And I think..." Agatha's heart was racing now, her pulse loud in her ears as she scrambled. "I think you need to be here for me to see it clearly."</span></p><p><span>It was the flimsiest excuse she'd ever given. But Rio didn't call her on it.</span></p><p><span>"Where?" Rio asked quietly.</span></p><p><span>"There's a garden behind the house with purple flowers on the terrace. The one with the fig tree. There's a loose section of wall, you’re thin enough to slip through. Come after moonrise. When the house is quiet."</span></p><p><span>"Your keeper—"</span></p><p><span>"Will be asleep. Or occupied with her own schemes." Agatha forced herself to meet Rio's eyes. "Will you come?"</span></p><p><span>She watched the bob as Rio's throat worked. When she spoke, her voice was rough. "Why are you doing this?"</span></p><p><span>"Because," Agatha said instead, "the gods showed me something impossible."</span></p><p><span>Her mother's footsteps were closer now.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood, moving toward the door. But she paused at the threshold, looking back. Her dark eyes held something that nearly made Agatha race to grab her hand and follow after her.</span></p><p><span>"I'll come," Rio said.</span></p><p><span>Then she was gone, and Agatha was left alone with the scattered bones on the floor.</span></p><p><span>Her mother entered a moment later, nose wrinkling. "Was someone just here? It smells foul." She stopped, eyes narrowing. "Agatha. Who was in this room?"</span></p><p><span>"A petitioner," Agatha said calmly, though her hands trembled as she gathered the fallen bones. "Looking for guidance about her future."</span></p><p><span>"Without an appointment? Without payment?" Her mother's voice sharpened. "What did she want?"</span></p><p><span>"To know if there was another path for her. If she could choose something different than what was expected."</span></p><p><span>Her mother made a disgusted sound. "I hope you told her the gods don't rewrite destinies for convenience."</span></p><p><span>Agatha carefully placed the last bone back in its bowl. "Actually," she said quietly, "I told her that sometimes the path to what we want goes through the impossible."</span></p><p><span>Her mother stared at her for a long moment. "You're being cryptic. I don't like it when you're cryptic."</span></p><p><span>"I'm being a seer, Mother. It's what you made me."</span></p><p><span>There was a shadow of suspicion, perhaps, or the beginning of concern. But then she waved a dismissive hand. "Well, whatever you told her, I hope she paid. No charity readings, Agatha. We have a reputation to maintain."</span></p><p><span>"Of course, Mother."</span></p><p><span>When her mother finally left, Agatha returned to the window. The seven crows she’d been watching before had taken flight, circling once before heading west toward the setting sun.</span></p><p><span>Seven meant change. Seven meant something coming that couldn't be stopped.</span></p><p align="center">---</p><p><span>The moon was a silver coin cast high up in the sky by the time Agatha slipped from her chambers.</span></p><p><span>Patience did not come easily to her. But she'd waited through dinner, through her mother's interminable discussion of next week's appointments, through the household settling into sleep.</span></p><p><span>Now the halls were quiet save for the occasional creak of old wood and the distant sound of the night watch changing positions in the street.</span></p><p><span>Her heart hammered as she made her way through the darkened corridors toward the east wing. She was being foolish. Reckless. Everything her mother had taught her not to be. Everything she would not allow herself to be.</span></p><p><span>But the vision had burned itself into her mind and propelled her forward now. Rio's hands in her hair. The taste of salt and honey. The possibility of being </span><em><span>chosen</span></em><span> rather than used.</span></p><p><span>The garden door gave way with barely a whisper. Cool night air kissed her heated skin as she stepped outside, and for a moment, she wondered if Rio would even come. </span></p><p><span>If perhaps the alpha had thought better of this mad idea, had decided that sneaking into a senator's daughter's home to meet with an omega above her station was a risk not worth taking.</span></p><p><span>Then she saw her.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood beneath the fig tree, a dark shape among shadows, but Agatha would have known her anywhere. That scent, salt and earth and danger carried on the night breeze.</span></p><p><span>"You came," Agatha breathed.</span></p><p><span>Even in the moonlight, Agatha could see the nervousness in the set of her shoulders as Rio turned towards her. </span></p><p><span>"I wasn't sure you'd meant it. Thought maybe once I left, you'd realize…" She stopped, then tried again. "I'm not supposed to be here."</span></p><p><span>"I know."</span></p><p><span>"Agatha Harkness. Daughter of Evanora. Your mother would have me thrown in chains. Or worse."</span></p><p><span>"I know that too."</span></p><p><span>Rio took a step closer, and Agatha could see she was carrying a small bundle wrapped in cloth. </span></p><p><span>"I brought you something. It's not much, I just… when you said to come, I couldn't arrive empty-handed. That felt wrong."</span></p><p><span>She held it out, and Agatha took it with trembling fingers. The cloth fell away to reveal three objects that sparkled brilliantly even in the pale light.</span></p><p><span>"Sea glass," Agatha whispered.</span></p><p><span>Three pieces, each no larger than her thumbnail. One blue, one green, one the color of amber. They'd been polished smooth by waves, their edges soft, their surfaces catching moonlight like small stars.</span></p><p><span>"I found them this morning," Rio said quietly. She seemed hesitant and almost shy. "Down at the docks. I wasn't looking for them, but then I saw this blue one, and when I saw your eyes this afternoon…" She stopped, ducking her head. "I thought you might like it. But I’m realizing now I’ve brought what is practically trash to the home of—"</span></p><p><span>"It's perfect," Agatha interrupted, closing her fingers around the smooth pieces. "No one's given me anything in years. But this is mine. Just mine. Thank you"</span></p><p><span>Rio's gentle eyes softened further, and it made Agatha's chest ache. "Just yours," she agreed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha knew she should send Rio away now, should tell her this was a mistake, should return to her chambers alone and forget this impossible pull between them.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she said, "Come with me."</span></p><p><span>"Where?"</span></p><p><span>"Somewhere we can talk without the whole garden hearing." Agatha tucked the sea glass carefully into her pocket, then reached for Rio's hand. "Somewhere private."</span></p><p><span>Rio's fingers closed around hers and Agatha felt that same jolt of recognition that had struck during the reading. Like their hands had been made to fit together.</span></p><p><span>"Your chambers?" Rio's voice was barely above a whisper but was pitched higher than Agatha had heard it before.</span></p><p><span>"Unless you'd prefer to stand here discussing prophecy where the guards might stumble upon us."</span></p><p><span>"Agatha—" Rio's grip tightened slightly. "If I come to your chambers, I need you to understand what you're implying."</span></p><p><span>"I know what I'm </span><em><span>asking</span></em><span>."</span></p><p><span>"Do you?" Rio stepped closer, and her scent wrapped around Agatha like a caress. "Because I'm trying very hard to be…" She stopped, jaw clenching. "I don't want you to think I came here expecting anything."</span></p><p><span>Agatha's pulse raced. "What if I'm expecting something?"</span></p><p><span>"What exactly did you see? In the vision?"</span></p><p><span>"Come inside with me. Let me show you."</span></p><p align="center"><strong>---</strong></p><p><span>Either luck or the gods chose that night to favor the pair of them as they passed through the house, Agatha leading, Rio following close enough that her warmth ghosted along Agatha's back. They reached Agatha's chambers without encountering another soul.</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed the door behind them and turned the lock with shaking hands.</span></p><p><span>When she turned back, Rio was standing in the center of the room, looking around with wide eyes. Taking in the silk curtains, the plush bed, the evidence of wealth and status that separated their worlds.</span></p><p><span>"This is where they keep you?"</span></p><p><span>"This is my cage, yes."</span></p><p><span>Rio's gaze snapped to hers. "You shouldn't have to live in a cage."</span></p><p><span>"No," Agatha agreed. "But when do mortals get what they should?"</span></p><p><span>She moved toward the low table where a bottle of wine was kept. An expensive vintage, kept for important guests her mother sometimes brought. She'd never opened it herself. Never had reason to.</span></p><p><span>Until now.</span></p><p><span>"Sit," she said, gesturing to the cushions. "Please."</span></p><p><span>Rio sat, but she perched on the edge like she might need to flee at any moment. Agatha poured two cups of wine with hands that trembled only slightly, then settled across from Rio.</span></p><p><span>"Tell me about your farm," Agatha said. "The one you want."</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked at the question. "What?"</span></p><p><span>"You said you want to grow things. Tell me what that looks like. In your mind."</span></p><p><span>For a moment, Rio just stared at her. Then, slowly, her posture loosened as she leaned forward and took the cup. </span></p><p><span>"Olive trees," she said. "A whole grove of them. They take years to mature, but once they do, they bear fruit for generations. I like the idea of that. Tending to something that will outlive you."</span></p><p><span>"What else?"</span></p><p><span>"A garden. Vegetables, herbs. Things that can be dried or preserved for winter." Rio's hands moved as she spoke, sketching shapes in the air. </span></p><p><span>"A small house. One room would be enough. Somewhere I could hear the wind through the leaves at night and the sea in the distance."</span></p><p><span>"It sounds beautiful."</span></p><p><span>"It sounds impossible." Rio's smile was sad. "The only way I could have something like that would be to leave the city entirely. Find some place far enough away that no one cares what I am."</span></p><p><span>"Would you? Leave?"</span></p><p><span>Rio's dark eyes held hers as she took another sip. "I would if I had a reason to."</span></p><p><span>The air between them felt heavy, charged like the air just before a storm broke in off the ocean. Agatha took a sip from her own cup to steady herself, but it only made her more aware of Rio's scent, stronger now in the enclosed space.</span></p><p><span>"The vision I had," Agatha said carefully. "During the reading."</span></p><p><span>"Yes?"</span></p><p><span>"I saw futures that shouldn't be possible. You and I, together. Happy. And then—" She stopped, the darker images flashing through her mind. "Then something else. Something I don't understand yet."</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned forward. "Together how?"</span></p><p><span>"I don't know if I should—"</span></p><p><span>"Please." Rio's voice dropped, almost to a whine.</span></p><p><span>They stared at each other across the small table. Agatha could see Rio's pulse beating in her throat, could smell the way her scent was changing. It was deeper, richer, tinged with something that made heat pool low in Agatha's belly.</span></p><p><span>"I've never done this before," Agatha heard herself say, her voice sounding distant and strange.</span></p><p><span>Rio went very still. "Done what?"</span></p><p><span>"Any of this. Invited someone to my chambers. Been alone with an alpha. Wanted—" She stopped, swallowed. "I've not wanted before. Not like this."</span></p><p><span>"Agatha." Rio's voice was strained. "If you keep talking like that, I'm going to—"</span></p><p><span>"What?" Agatha set down her wine cup with deliberate care. "What will you do, Rio? If you cannot speak it, how will you do anything?"</span></p><p><span>Rio's hands clenched on her thighs. "I'm trying to be respectful."</span></p><p><span>"I don't need your respect." The words came out bold, reckless. "I want—"</span></p><p><span>She stood, moving around the table before she could lose her nerve. Rio's eyes tracked her movement, dark and hungry and trying so hard to be controlled.</span></p><p><span>"I saw us," Agatha said, standing above where Rio sat. "In the vision. I saw your hands in my hair. Your mouth on mine. I saw—" Heat flooded her cheeks but she pushed on, leaning in as her words tumbled out in a torrent. "I saw us together. Tangled up. And it felt true. More true than any prophecy I've ever given."</span></p><p><span>Rio's breathing had gone ragged. "You can't just say things like that."</span></p><p><span>"Why not?"</span></p><p><span>"Because I'm barely holding on as it is." Rio looked up at her, and there was something wild in her expression now. "You don't know what you do to me. Your scent, your voice, the way you looked at me earlier like I was—" She stood abruptly, and suddenly they were chest to chest, Rio's height making Agatha tilt her head back to meet her eyes. </span></p><p><span>"If I touch you, I’m afraid I won't be able to stop."</span></p><p><span>"You would stop," Agatha whispered. "For me, you would. It's your nature to serve. Isn't it, dear alpha?"</span></p><p><span> Rio's jaw clenched. Her hands trembled at her sides, and Agatha could see her fighting every instinct. </span></p><p><span>"Say it," Agatha breathed, emboldened by wine and want and the way Rio looked at her. "Say you'll stop if I ask." </span></p><p><span>"I would." Rio's voice was barely above a whisper. "I'd do anything you asked." </span></p><p><span>"Anything?" </span></p><p><span>"Anything." </span></p><p><span>Agatha reached up slowly, giving Rio every chance to pull away, and traced one finger along her jaw. </span></p><p><span>Rio's eyes fell closed, and a shudder ran through her entire body. </span></p><p><span>"Even this?" Agatha asked, letting her finger trail down Rio's throat, feeling the rapid pulse there. "Even letting me touch you first?" </span></p><p><span>Rio's eyes opened, dark and desperate. "Especially that." </span></p><p><span>For one endless moment, they stood frozen with Agatha's finger pressed to Rio's racing pulse, Rio's hands still clenched at her sides, neither breathing. </span></p><p><span>Then, with a sound that was half groan, half whine, Rio cupped Agatha's face in both hands and kissed her.</span></p><p><span>The gods themselves could not match such a fire.</span></p><p><span>Rio's mouth was soft and demanding all at once, and Agatha gasped against it, her hands flying up to grip Rio's shirt. She'd never been kissed before, had nothing to compare this to, but surely it wasn't supposed to feel like this. Nothing this good could be allowed to her.</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled back just far enough to breathe, her forehead pressed to Agatha's. "Your mother—"</span></p><p><span>"Isn't here." Agatha tilted her face up, chasing Rio's mouth. "It's just us. Just tonight. Please, Rio. I want—I need—"</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her again, deeper this time, and Agatha made a sound she'd never heard herself make before. It was desperate and wanting and utterly shameless. Rio's hands slid from her face to her shoulders then down to the soft dimples of her back, pulling her closer until there was no space between them.</span></p><p><span>"Bed," Agatha managed between kisses. "We should—the bed—"</span></p><p><span>Rio walked her backward toward the bed, never breaking contact, until Agatha's legs hit the edge. She sat, pulling Rio down with her, and Rio came willingly, covering Agatha's body with her own.</span></p><p><span>"Gods," Rio breathed against her throat. "You're so—I can smell you. You smell like—"</span></p><p><span>"Like what?"</span></p><p><span>"Like poppy and rose. Honey and salt and every small pleasant thing I’ve come across." Rio's lips traced the line of Agatha's jaw, making her shiver. "Tell me what you want. I'll give you anything."</span></p><p><span>"You," Agatha said simply. "I want you."</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled back enough to look at her, and something in her expression made Agatha's heart stutter. It wasn’t supposed to be easy to earn devotion, but it was plain to see already on Rio’s face.</span></p><p><span>"Then you have me," Rio said firmly. "For tonight. For however long you'll let me stay."</span></p><p><span>She leaned down and kissed her again, and this time Agatha let herself fall into it completely. Let herself forget about prophecies and status and all the reasons this was impossible.</span></p><p><span>For tonight, she would be just Agatha.</span></p><p><span>And Rio would be just hers.</span></p><p><span>She ran her hands up Rio's arms, marveling at the lean muscle there, the strength barely leashed.</span></p><p><span>"I should—" Rio's voice was rough as she ran her tongue over swollen lips. "I should tell you. I've never done this either."</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked up at her. "Never?"</span></p><p><span>"Never." Rio's cheeks flushed, visible even in the low lamplight. "Alphas are not supposed to take lovers unless we're claimed. It's considered..." She struggled for the word. "Disrespectful. Taking pleasure we haven't earned."</span></p><p><span>"That's absurd."</span></p><p><span>"Maybe. But it's what we're taught." Rio ducked her head, pressing her forehead to Agatha's collarbone. "So if I'm terrible at this, if I don't know what I'm doing..."</span></p><p><span>"Then we'll learn together." Agatha threaded her fingers through Rio's hair, loosening the braid until dark waves spilled free.</span></p><p><span>She fisted her hand in it, tugging just enough to make Rio's breath hitch. </span></p><p><span>"I like that idea. Learning you. You being mine." </span></p><p><span>Rio lifted her head, eyes glazed and dark. "Just yours?" </span></p><p><span>"Just mine," Agatha confirmed, and she watched as something fierce and tender cross Rio's face all at once. </span></p><p><span>Rio pressed her face back into Agatha's neck, breathing deep. </span></p><p><span>"You smell so good," she murmured against Agatha's pulse point. "Like honey warming in the sun. Like—" Her tongue darted out, tasting salt and skin. "I want to drown in you." </span></p><p><span>Agatha's head fell back with a gasp, exposing more of her throat. "Then drown." </span></p><p><span>Rio made a sound that was half whimper, half growl. Her mouth opened wider against Agatha's neck, and for a heartbeat Agatha felt the sharp press of teeth, not breaking skin, just </span><em><span>there</span></em><span>, a promise and a threat and a plea all at once.</span></p><p><span>"You're going to ruin me," Rio said between kisses her hands now bold on Agatha's waist. "Completely ruin me for anyone else."</span></p><p><span> "Good," Agatha managed, pulling Rio up to face her again. Rio's lips were wine-dark and swollen, her pupils blown so wide her eyes looked black. "I don't want you to want anyone else." </span></p><p><span>"I won't." Rio's thumb traced Agatha's bottom lip, and Agatha caught it between her teeth, biting gently.  "I couldn't. Not after this. Not after you." </span></p><p><span>Agatha released her thumb and pulled her down into another kiss. </span></p><p><span>This one was slower, deeper, an exploration rather than a claiming. Rio's lips moved against hers with careful attention, learning what made Agatha gasp, what made her arch up, what made her whimper into Rio's mouth. </span></p><p><span>When Rio's tongue traced the seam of her lips, Agatha opened for her without hesitation. The taste of her, wine and want and Rio, made Agatha's head spin. </span></p><p><span>Rio made a low sound in her chest, something between a growl and a purr that Agatha felt as much as heard. Her hands began to move, cautious at first, mapping the curve of Agatha's waist through layers of fine linen. </span></p><p><span>"Touch me," Agatha urged against her mouth. "Properly. I want to feel your hands." </span></p><p><span>Rio pulled back just enough to look at her, seeking permission one more time. Agatha answered by taking Rio's hand and placing it firmly on her breast, still clothed but the intention clear. </span></p><p><span>Rio's breathing went ragged. Her hand flexed, cupping the soft weight, and even through fabric Agatha felt the heat of her palm, the slight tremor of restraint barely held.</span></p><p><span> "Like this?" Rio asked, voice dropping. </span></p><p><span>"Yes. More. Please, Rio—" </span></p><p><span>Rio's other hand joined the first, both now exploring with growing confidence as Agatha arched into the touch, shameless in her wanting.</span></p><p><span>"Can I—" Rio's fingers found the clasp of Agatha's chiton. "Can I see you?"</span></p><p><span>"Yes. Please, yes."</span></p><p><span>Rio's hands trembled as she undid the fastenings. The fabric fell away piece by piece, and Agatha fought the urge to cover herself. She'd been naked before servants during baths, during dressing, but this was different.</span></p><p><span>Rio sat back on her heels, and her expression made every moment of vulnerability worth it.</span></p><p><span>"Beautiful," she breathed. "You're so…" Her hands hovered over Agatha's skin, not quite touching. "Can I touch you again?"</span></p><p><span>"Rio, if you don't touch me right now, I think I'll lose my mind."</span></p><p><span>"I just—I want to do this right. I want—"</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached up and took one of Rio's hands, pressing it flat against her sternum where her heart hammered. "See? You're already doing it right. Now do as I say."</span></p><p><span>Rio's palm was warm against her skin. She spread her fingers slowly, as if testing the reality of her, then drew her hand down with reverent care. Over the swell of Agatha's breast, making her shiver. Down her ribs. Across the soft plane of her belly.</span></p><p><span>Rio's thumb brushed across her nipple—tentative, testing—and Agatha arched with a gasp. The sensation shot straight through her, lighting up nerves she hadn't known existed.</span></p><p><span>"Like that?" Rio asked, doing it again.</span></p><p><span>"Yes—gods, yes—"</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned down and replaced her thumb with her mouth.</span></p><p><span>Agatha cried out, fingers tangling in Rio's hair. The wet heat of her tongue, the gentle suction, the hint of teeth that made pleasure spark into something sharper. Overwhelmed and not enough, she cried out again.</span></p><p><span>"Rio," she gasped. "I need—I don't know what I need—"</span></p><p><span>"It's alright." Rio kissed her way across to the other breast, lavishing the same attention there. "Just tell me. If something feels good, tell me. If it doesn't, tell me that too."</span></p><p><span>"Everything feels good. Too good. I'm—" Agatha felt heat flooding through her, pooling low in her belly and lower still. Between her thighs she was growing wet, slick in a way that would have embarrassed her if she had any room left for embarrassment. "I'm aching."</span></p><p><span>Rio lifted her head, eyes blown dark. "Where?"</span></p><p><span>Agatha took Rio's hand and guided it down her body. Rio's breath caught in understanding.</span></p><p><span>"Here?" Rio's fingers brushed through the curls there, not quite touching where Agatha needed. "You're aching here?"</span></p><p><span>"Yes. Please."</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her softly even as her hand moved lower. "Shh. It’s okay. Just let me."</span></p><p><span>Her fingers slid through slickness, and they both gasped.</span></p><p><span>"Gods," Rio breathed. "You're so—is this?"</span></p><p><span>"It's for you," Agatha managed, even though the words made her face burn. "My body is…it wants…"</span></p><p><span>"Me." Rio's voice had dropped an octave. "It wants me."</span></p><p><span>"Yes."</span></p><p><span>Rio's fingers explored with careful curiosity, mapping the folds and valleys of her. When she brushed over the small bundle of nerves at the apex, Agatha bucked and cried out.</span></p><p><span>"There," she gasped. "Right there, please—"</span></p><p><span>Rio circled that spot with careful attention, watching Agatha's face as she did. Learning. Adjusting her pressure, her rhythm, based on every gasp and moan. And Agatha came undone beneath those patient hands, her body teaching Rio exactly what she needed.</span></p><p><span>"You're so responsive," Rio murmured, pressing kisses to Agatha's throat. "Every touch, you just—" She stroked a little firmer, and Agatha whimpered. "I could do this for hours. Watch you like this."</span></p><p><span>"I won't—I can't last hours—" She whined. Agatha's hips were moving now, chasing Rio's touch. "Something's building. Inside me. It feels like—"</span></p><p><span>"Like you're going to break apart?"</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded, chewing at her lip until she felt it bleed.</span></p><p><span>"Good." Rio kissed her deeply. "Let go. I've got you."</span></p><p><span>Her fingers found a rhythm, steady and sure, and Agatha felt herself climbing toward something she'd never experienced before. Her body drew tight, muscles tensing, breath coming in short gasps—</span></p><p><span>"Rio—I think—I'm going to—"</span></p><p><span>"Yes, just like that," Rio encouraged, her free hand cupping Agatha's face. "Let me see you. Let me—"</span></p><p><span>Agatha shattered, the pleasure hit her in waves, rolling through her entire body until she didn't know where she ended and the cosmos began. She cried out Rio's name, clutching at her shoulders, riding the sensation as Rio's fingers kept moving, drawing it out until Agatha thought she might die from it.</span></p><p><span>Finally, she collapsed back against the cushions, trembling and gasping. Rio withdrew her hand carefully, and Agatha immediately missed the contact.</span></p><p><span>"That was—" Rio's voice was awed. "Did I? was that good?"</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, breathless and giddy. "Good? Rio, that was—I didn't know. I had no idea." She reached up to cup Rio's face. "Come here."</span></p><p><span>She kissed her deeply, tasting her own pleasure on Rio's lips, and felt Rio shudder against her.</span></p><p><span>"Your turn," Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>Rio's eyes widened. "You don't have to. You can rest if that’s what you need. This is already more than I—"</span></p><p><span>"I want to." Agatha forced herself to sit up, even though her limbs felt liquid. "I want to touch you. I want to make you feel what you just made me feel." She tugged at Rio's tunic. "Anyway, you're still dressed, and that seems terribly unfair."</span></p><p><span>Rio let Agatha undress her, though her hands shook as she helped with the fastenings more quickly than she expected Rio's torso was bare in the lamplight.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared.</span></p><p><span>She'd seen alphas before, working in the fields, standing guard, stripped to the waist in the summer heat. But she'd never </span><em><span>looked</span></em><span>. Never let herself notice the lean lines of muscle, the shadows that formed in the hollows of throat and collarbone.</span></p><p><span>Rio was beautiful in a way that made Agatha's chest ache.</span></p><p><span>"You're staring," Rio said, and there was nervousness in her voice now.</span></p><p><span>"You're stunning." Agatha reached out to trace one finger down the center of Rio's chest, between her small breasts. "Look at you."</span></p><p><span>Rio caught her hand. "Compared to you I’m—"</span></p><p><span>"Perfect," Agatha interrupted. "You're perfect."</span></p><p><span>She leaned forward and kissed the hollow of Rio's throat, feeling the pulse jump beneath her lips. Rio made a choked sound, her hands coming up to tangle in Agatha's hair.</span></p><p><span>"The rest," Agatha murmured against her skin. "Take off the rest."</span></p><p><span>Rio stood on shaking legs and removed her boots, her trousers, until she stood naked before Agatha.</span></p><p><span>Agatha's eyes went very wide.</span></p><p><span>"Oh," she breathed.</span></p><p><span>Rio flushed dark, moving to cover herself. "I’m sorry, I know it's—"</span></p><p><span>"Rio." Agatha stood and caught her hands. "What are you apologizing for?"</span></p><p><span>"I… I don’t know. It's just different than you. Than omegas."</span></p><p><span>"I already knew that. I was kept sheltered, not stupid." Agatha looked down at Rio's body with open curiosity. The length of firm flesh that hung between Rio's thighs was already swollen, flushed dark with arousal. "You're very... large."</span></p><p><span>Rio made a strangled sound as her chest flushed. "Am I?"</span></p><p><span>"I don't know," Agatha admitted, unable to stop the nervous laugh that bubbled up. "I just—it seemed like something you'd like to hear?"</span></p><p><span>The absurdity of it broke the tension. Rio's laugh was shocked and delighted. She pulled her close, and Agatha felt that heated length press against her belly. The sensation made her stomach flip with want. "Agatha, we don't have to—if you're not ready—"</span></p><p><span>"I want to." Agatha reached down between them, wrapping curious fingers around Rio's length.</span></p><p><span>Rio jerked and gasped, her hips bucking forward involuntarily. "Wait—"</span></p><p><span>"Did I hurt you?"</span></p><p><span>"No, just sensitive. Very—gods—" Rio's eyes had fallen closed, her jaw clenched. "If you keep touching me like that, this is going to be over embarrassingly fast."</span></p><p><span>Agatha ignored her, stroking experimentally, learning the shape of her. The velvet-soft skin, the hardness beneath, the way Rio's whole body trembled. "I like that I can make you feel like this. That your body wants mine the way mine wants yours. And it’s kind enough to show me."</span></p><p><span>"It does." Rio's voice was strangled. "Want yours. So much it's—I'm trying to—"</span></p><p><span>"To what?"</span></p><p><span>"To last. To make this good for you. But you're touching me and you smell so good and—" Rio's hips jerked again. "Agatha, I'm going to—I can't—"</span></p><p><span>She came with a broken cry, spilling over Agatha's fingers in hot pulses. Agatha watched her face, fascinated by the way pleasure transformed her—the slack jaw, the blown pupils, the complete surrender.</span></p><p><span>When it was over, Rio slumped forward, burying her face in Agatha's neck.</span></p><p><span>"I'm sorry," she mumbled. "That was gods, that was so fast. I wanted to—"</span></p><p><span>"Don't apologize." Agatha held her close, stroking her hair. "We have all night, remember? Show me again."</span></p><p><span>Rio lifted her head. "Again?"</span></p><p><span>"You said if I kept touching you, it would be over fast. So let's see what happens if we take our time."</span></p><p><span>Rio's expression shifted, surprise giving way to wonder, giving way to heat. </span></p><p><span>She kissed Agatha slowly, thoroughly, taking her time now that the desperate edge had been satisfied. </span></p><p><span>"I want to try something," Rio murmured against her lips. </span></p><p><span>"What?" </span></p><p><span>"I want to be inside you. If—if you want that."</span></p><p><span>The words sent a pulse of heat through Agatha's core and she nodded quickly.</span></p><p><span>"Only if you want it too." Rio lowered her to the bed, covering her body again. "If you're ready."</span></p><p><span>"I want it." Agatha spread her thighs, making room for Rio between them. "I want all of you."</span></p><p><span>Rio settled between her legs, and they both gasped. Rio rocked gently, sliding through wetness without entering, and the friction made Agatha moan.</span></p><p><span>"Like that?" Rio asked, doing it again.</span></p><p><span>"More. I need—Rio, please—"</span></p><p><span>"I don't want to hurt you."</span></p><p><span>"You won't." Agatha reached down between them, guiding Rio to where she needed her. "Please. I need to feel you."</span></p><p><span>Rio pushed forward slowly, carefully, and Agatha felt herself stretch to accommodate her. There was pressure, a fullness that bordered on too much, a burning sensation that walked the line between pleasure and pain. </span></p><p><span>Her body resisted for a heartbeat, then yielded, and Rio slid deeper. </span></p><p><span>"Oh," Agatha breathed, her fingers digging into Rio's shoulders. "Oh."</span></p><p><span>Rio stilled. "Okay? Is this okay?"</span></p><p><span>"Don't stop." Agatha wrapped her legs around Rio's hips, urging her deeper. "Don't you dare stop."</span></p><p><span>Rio pushed forward until she was fully seated, and they both made broken sounds at the sensation. Agatha felt impossibly full, stretched and claimed in a way that made something primal sing in her blood.</span></p><p><span>"Gods," Rio gasped. "You feel—I've never—" She tried to pull back and Agatha's body clenched around her. "Oh gods."</span></p><p><span>"Move," Agatha urged. "Please, Rio, I need—"</span></p><p><span>Rio began to move. Slow at first, testing, learning the rhythm. Each thrust sent sparks of pleasure through Agatha's body, and she found herself moving with Rio, meeting her stroke for stroke.</span></p><p><span>"Harder," she heard herself say. "You won't break me."</span></p><p><span>Rio's control cracked. She drove into Agatha with more force, more purpose, and Agatha cried out at the intensity of it.</span></p><p><span>"Touch yourself," Rio panted. "I want—I need you to—"</span></p><p><span>Agatha slid her hand between their bodies, finding that bundle of nerves again. With Rio moving inside her and her own fingers on her clit, the pleasure built impossibly fast.</span></p><p><span>"I'm close," she gasped. "Rio, I'm—"</span></p><p><span>"Me too. I can't—can't hold back—"</span></p><p><span>"Then don't." Agatha clenched around her deliberately. "Come inside me. I want to feel it."</span></p><p><span>Rio made a sound that was almost pained, her rhythm faltering. "Agatha—"</span></p><p><span>"Please."</span></p><p><span>Rio drove into her one last time and shattered, crying out as she spilled deep inside Agatha's body. The sensation of it sent Agatha over the edge with her. She came around Rio's cock, her body milking every last pulse as waves of pleasure rolled through her.</span></p><p><span>When it was over, they collapsed together in a tangle of limbs and sweat-slicked skin. Rio's weight was heavy on her, but Agatha had never felt safer. She would happily bear it.</span></p><p><span>"I can’t—" Rio's voice was muffled against her neck. "I don't have the words."</span></p><p><span>"Good," Agatha said, running her hands down Rio's muscled back. "I don't either."</span></p><p><span>They lay there for long moments, breathing together, hearts slowly returning to normal. Eventually, Rio stirred, starting to pull away.</span></p><p><span>"Don't," Agatha said quickly. "Not yet. Stay inside me just a little longer."</span></p><p><span>Rio settled back down with a contented rumble that Agatha could feel against her chest. "I could stay here forever."</span></p><p><span>"I wish you could.”</span></p><p><span>They left it at that for a while.</span></p><p><span>Finally, reluctantly, Rio withdrew.</span></p><p><span>Agatha made a soft sound of loss, and Rio kissed her gently in apology before reaching for the washbasin. The water was cool against heated skin as Rio cleaned them both. First Agatha, with infinite care, dampening the cloth and wiping gently between her thighs, then herself with less attention.</span></p><p><span>"You don't have to do that," Agatha murmured, watching Rio tend to her.</span></p><p><span>"I want to." Rio's touch was reverent. "I want to take care of you. It makes me happy to."</span></p><p><span>When she finished, she set the cloth aside and stretched out on the bed. Agatha immediately curled into her side, throwing one leg over Rio's hips possessively. Rio's arm came around her automatically, holding her close.</span></p><p><span>"I can still feel you," Agatha murmured against Rio's shoulder. "Still inside me. Warm."</span></p><p><span>Rio's breath caught. "Is that—does it hurt?"</span></p><p><span>"No." Agatha laughed and pressed closer, her hand splaying across Rio's chest. "It feels like you're still here. Like you haven't left yet."</span></p><p><span>Rio's hand tightened on her hip. "I don't want to leave. Ever."</span></p><p><span>"Then don't think about it." Agatha tilted her face up to kiss the underside of Rio's jaw. "Just be here. With me. For as long as we have. Maybe this night will last as long as we need it to."</span></p><p><span>They lay tangled together, mapping each other's bodies with gentle touches now. There was no urgency, just wonder. Rio's fingers traced idle patterns on Agatha's shoulder, down her arm, across her hip as she learned the landscape of her.</span></p><p><span>"I keep thinking I'm going to wake up," Rio said quietly. "That this is a dream or some vision. A trick of my mind.”</span></p><p><span>"I know the difference, I assure you I'm real." Agatha took Rio's hand and pressed it to her chest, over her heart.</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled her up for a proper kiss, slow and deep and achingly tender. When they broke apart, she tucked Agatha's head beneath her chin, one hand stroking through her hair in a rhythm that made Agatha's eyes grow heavy.</span></p><p><span>"Sleep," Rio murmured. "I'll watch over you."</span></p><p><span>"You should sleep too," Agatha protested, but her words were already slurring.</span></p><p><span>"I will. But first I want to memorize this. You in my arms. Safe. Mine."</span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled against Rio's skin. "Yours," she agreed.</span></p><p><span>Rio continued her gentle stroking, and Agatha's breathing gradually evened out. She fought against sleep, wanting to stay in this moment forever, but Rio's heartbeat was steady beneath her ear, and her body was sated and warm.</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes and memorized the feeling: Rio's warmth surrounding her, her steady breathing, the way her hand splayed possessive and protective across Agatha's belly.</span></p><p><span>This, she thought. This was what freedom felt like.</span></p><p><span>Even if she could only keep it until sunrise.</span></p><p><span>Neither saw the way the lamplight flickered.</span></p><p><span>Neither noticed how the shadows in the corners seemed to deepen and writhe.</span></p><p><span>And when the dream came—when the vision seized Agatha in its grip—Rio slept on, unaware of the prophecy unfolding behind Agatha's closed eyes.</span></p>

<p><span>For a moment between sleep and waking, Agatha thought she might not pull air into her lungs again. She could feel Rio’s arms still tight around her waist, but that was the only warmth she noticed; her own body was rigid and cold.</span></p><p><span>She woke with a gasp, immediately pressing her palm hard against her chest. Her heart hammered against her ribs, proving she was alive. She was real.</span></p><p><span>The dream was not. </span><em><span>Just a dream,</span></em><span> she told herself.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha knew better than that. Dreams were ephemeral and quickly forgotten, no matter how deftly one tried to hold on to the details. To hold a dream in place was like trying to hold oil between two cupped palms. What didn’t spill would soon be absorbed.</span></p><p><span>Visions, however, were not so quickly lost.</span></p><p><span>"Shh," Rio murmured, still half asleep. Her hand splayed wider across Agatha's belly, pulling her back against the warm length of her body. "Just a dream. You're safe here."</span></p><p><span>If the whisper had come from any other, Agatha would have laughed. Instead, she felt a welling behind her eyes. But she could not afford to cry. </span></p><p><span>Not after last night, not after choosing this and seeing what the gods had shown her—</span></p><p><span>Rio's lips brushed the nape of her neck, where her hair curled the tightest, and the vision fragments scattered like startled birds.</span></p><p><span>"I’m sorry. Did I wake you?" Agatha whispered.</span></p><p><span>"Mhm. It is alright." Rio nuzzled her face deeper into Agatha’s hair, breathing deep. "You smell good. Different than last night."</span></p><p><span>"Different how?"</span></p><p><span>"Sweeter. Richer." Rio's voice was rough with sleep, low and almost rumbling. "Like honey over sliced fruit that's been sitting in the sun. Makes my mouth water."</span></p><p><span>Warmth flooded through Agatha's body, she was not embarrassed but felt her face get hot anyway and could feel the goosebumps spreading down her neck where Rio’s nose still pressed. </span></p><p><span>Her skin felt too sensitive, hyperaware of every place Rio's body pressed against hers. The arm around her waist. The chest against her back. The press and little jump of—</span></p><p><span>"Rio," Agatha said carefully.</span></p><p><span>"Mmm?"</span></p><p><span>"Are you..." Agatha didn't quite know how to phrase it delicately. Her hand rested on Rio's hip, feeling the heat of her skin. "Are you aware of what's happening? With your body right now?"</span></p><p><span>There was a moment of sleepy confusion. Then Rio went very still, her breath catching.</span></p><p><span>"Oh." The word came out small. "I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to… it just happens, I can't—"</span></p><p><span>She started to pull away, but Agatha tightened her hold on her hip.</span></p><p><span>"Don't," Agatha said softly. "I'm not upset."</span></p><p><span>"You're not?"</span></p><p><span>"No."</span></p><p><span>Agatha shifted back slightly, creating just enough space between them to see. The early morning light was beginning to filter through the curtains, pale and golden. It painted Rio in warm tones, gilded the edges of her.</span></p><p><span>Rio, who was tangled in the silk sheets like something carved from marble, the kind of form that made Agatha's fingers itch to trace every contour. The sheet had fallen to her waist, leaving her torso bare, and Agatha allowed herself to take the time to look.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes traveled a path, her index finger tracing half a step behind over the gentle slope of her shoulders, then the delicate hollow of her collarbones.</span></p><p><span>"I want to see you," Agatha murmured. "In the daylight. Is that alright?"</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded, even as her cheeks flushed deeper.</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached out slowly, giving Rio every chance to refuse. Her fingers met the warm skin of Rio's sternum, and she felt the rapid heartbeat there. It was sweet, she thought, proof that Rio was just as affected, just as uncertain, just as overwhelmed by this.</span></p><p><span>Lower, she let her hand drift.</span></p><p><span>Down the center line of Rio's chest, between her breasts. Down to where the planes of muscle began to define themselves more clearly. Her thumb found the subtle indentation between the bands of muscle, tracing each linewith reverent attention.</span></p><p><span>Rio's breathing went shallow, and Agatha heard the rustle of sheets being pulled into her first as she clenched it.</span></p><p><span>"I couldn’t see properly last night," Agatha whispered. "But now—"</span></p><p><span>Her fingers continued their exploration, following the path downward to where the muscle softened slightly at the dip of Rio's belly. If she were bolder, she’d press her lips there and find out if the curve felt as nice under her tongue as under her thumb.</span></p><p><span>If she had known how little time she had, she would have made certain of it.</span></p><p><span>But for now, she was content to let her fingers trace. They traveled lower still, to where a trail of dark hair began, leading down beneath the sheet that still preserved Rio's modesty.</span></p><p><span>"Can I?" Agatha asked softly.</span></p><p><span>She noticed, when Rio nodded, that the flush had spread from her cheeks and neck down across her entire chest.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tugged the sheet away, and Rio whimpered but remained very still.</span></p><p><span>In the gentle morning light, Agatha could see all of her. The dark curls between her thighs. The flushed length of her cock, already hardening further under Agatha's gaze.</span></p><p><span>"I'm curious," Agatha said, her voice barely above a whisper. She let her fingers drift down to the soft hair, tugging it gently between her fingers, watching the way it made Rio's hips twitch. "About how this works. About what you feel."</span></p><p><span>"Agatha…" Rio's voice was strained.</span></p><p><span>"Tell me." Agatha's knuckles brushed lower, grazing the base of Rio's cock, and Rio let out a strangled whine before pressing her lips together tightly.</span></p><p><span>"I'm sorry," Rio said immediately, mortified. "I didn't mean to—I'm trying to—"</span></p><p><span>"Don't apologize." Agatha's touch gentled, her hand coming up to cup Rio's face instead. "I want to hear you. I want to know what feels good. I want—" She paused, searching for the words. "Last night was beautiful. But it was desperate. This is different."</span></p><p><span>"How?"</span></p><p><span>"Night is over," Agatha said simply. "We are in the light. Taking our time. Learning."</span></p><p><span>Rio's eyes were blown dark, pupils wide. "We don't have much time. Your household will wake soon. Your mother—"</span></p><p><span>"We’ll have more time if you stop counting what we don’t have."</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned forward and kissed her deeply, shaking the last of sleepfrom her. When she pulled back, she let her hand return to Rio's body with careful attention.</span></p><p><span>"Teach me," she murmured against Rio's jaw. "Show me what you like."</span></p><p><span>Rio's hand came up to cover Agatha's, guiding it lower, showing her the right pressure and rhythm. And Agatha learned as much as she could. She learned the sounds she made, the way her body responded, the places that made her gasp and arch and forget to be careful.</span></p><p><span>The places that drew Rio’s hand to tangle in her hair and beckoned soft cries from her lips.</span></p><p><span>(Later, when bards sang of this, they would make it beautiful. They would speak of star-crossed lovers and cruel fate and the gods' capricious hearts. They would make an audience weep at the poetry of it: the seer who saw her own doom, the alpha who loved her anyway, the gasps of freedom before the tears of fall.</span></p><p><span>They would call it a tragedy. Make it into art. Turn suffering into something worth witnessing.</span></p><p><span>But on that morning shared, there was nothing beautiful about knowing it would end. Nothing poetic about Agatha memorizing the feel of Rio's skin, knowing soon it would only exist in memory.</span></p><p><span>The tragedy was not just that they would be separated.</span></p><p><span>If Agatha could see the full scope of what was coming—all the blood and stone and horror—she'd still choose this moment. Would still pull Rio close. Would still memorize the shape of her in morning light.</span></p><p><span>And Rio, though Agatha barely knew her, was watching with eyes that saw too much. That understood, on some instinctive level, this was already goodbye.</span></p><p><span>That's what made it a tragedy. Either would doom them both again. Both of them would.)</span></p><p><span>"I wish we had more time," Agatha whispered for perhaps the hundredth time.</span></p><p><span>"We will." Rio's hand cupped her face. "When I come back for you. We'll have all the time in the world."</span></p><p><span>Agatha wanted to believe it.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she kissed Rio again and tried not to think about the vision. About stone and serpents and the grief in Rio's eyes when she finally understood.</span></p><p><span>Rio shifted beneath her touch, and Agatha felt her breathing steady and settle. It almost sounded like a low purr. The desperate edge from moments ago had softened into something warmer, more present.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha's own body was doing the opposite.</span></p><p><span>The warmth she'd felt earlier, the hypersensitivity, the ache, it wasn't fading. If anything, it was building. Spreading through her limbs like she was lying out to bake in the warming sun.</span></p><p><span>"Your turn," Rio murmured, her hands sliding to Agatha's waist, and Agatha nearly whimpered at the contact.</span></p><p><span>Rio paused, tilting her head. "Are you alright?"</span></p><p><span>"I don't know," Agatha admitted. "I feel... strange."</span></p><p><span>"Strange how?"</span></p><p><span>Agatha considered how to explain the heat building low in her belly, the way her skin felt flushed and oversensitive, the ache between her thighs that had nothing to do with soreness from the night before.</span></p><p><span>"I feel like I could burn up from the inside," she said quietly. "Like my body wants something but I don't know what." She pressed Rio's hand to her chest, where her heart raced. "Like this. Constantly."</span></p><p><span>Rio's brow furrowed with concern, and she pressed her lips to Agatha’s jaw. “Maybe I can help?” </span></p><p><span>"I don’t know. What are you feeling?" Agatha asked, suddenly shy.</span></p><p><span>"Like I want to keep you here. I want to make sure you have everything you need. Food, water, safety." Her voice dropped lower as her hands wandered to palm over Agatha’s hip. "Like I want to make you come again and again until you can't remember anything else but adoration. Like I want to mark you. Properly. Where everyone can see."</span></p><p><span>The words sent heat flooding through Agatha's core. "Where?"</span></p><p><span>"Here." Rio's free hand brushed the junction of Agatha's neck and shoulder. "Right here. So anyone who looked at you would know you were claimed."</span></p><p><span>"I can't," Agatha breathed, even as her body arched into the touch. "My mother would see. She'd—"</span></p><p><span>"I know." Rio's expression was pained. "I know. That's why I won't. But gods, Agatha, I want to."</span></p><p><span>They stared at each other, the air between them crackling with want and biology and something deeper than either understood.</span></p><p><span>"When is your next heat due?"</span></p><p><span>"Weeks from now. It can't be—"</span></p><p><span>But even as she said it, Agatha knew. The signs were there. The hypersensitivity. The ache. The way her body was already responding to Rio's proximity with a need that felt almost desperate.</span></p><p><span>"Sometimes it happens early," Rio said softly, her hand flexing against Agatha's chest. "When there's... compatibility. When the body recognizes…"</span></p><p><span>She stopped, but Agatha heard the unspoken word anyway.</span></p><p><em><span>Mate.</span></em></p><p><span>"We're too young for this," Agatha breathed. "For true mates. It doesn't happen like this."</span></p><p><span>"No," Rio agreed, but her voice was uncertain. "Not usually."</span></p><p><span>"But you feel it anyway."</span></p><p><span>"Yes."</span></p><p><span>The admission hung between them like a confession. Like a curse.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned forward and kissed her—slow and deep and achingly tender. When they broke apart, she rested her forehead against Agatha's.</span></p><p><span>"I meant what I said last night," Rio murmured. "I'll break my back to give you the world. A house with olive trees. A garden. Freedom. Whatever you want, I'll find a way."</span></p><p><span>"Rio—"</span></p><p><span>"I know you think it's impossible. I know your mother will never allow it. But I don't care." Rio's hand cupped her face. "I'll wait. However long it takes. I'll work, I'll save every coin, I'll find us somewhere far enough away that no one cares about us. And when I come back for you—"</span></p><p><span>"When?" Agatha's heart clenched.</span></p><p><span>"When," Rio said firmly. "Not if. When. I promise you, Agatha. I will come back for you."</span></p><p><span>Agatha wanted to believe it. She wanted to believe in olive groves and freedom and a future where the gods allowed them this impossible thing. But even more so, she needed Rio to carry that hope.</span></p><p><span>"Promise me something else," Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>"Anything."</span></p><p><span>"Promise me that if I tell you to go, if I tell you to leave and never come back, you'll do it."</span></p><p><span>Rio pulled back, confusion and hurt crossing her face. "What? Why would you even—"</span></p><p><span>"Just promise me." Agatha's fingers dug into Rio's shoulders. "Please. If I ever tell you that, if I ever push you away, promise me you'll go."</span></p><p><span>"Agatha, I don't understand—"</span></p><p><span>"Promise me."</span></p><p><span>Rio searched her face for a long moment. She lifted her hand to tuck a curl of Agatha’s hair behind her ear. "If that's what you truly want. If you tell me to go... I'll go."</span></p><p><span>It was a half-truth. Agatha could hear it in her voice. Rio would go. But just like the tide she would come back. Would keep coming back. Would search for her until…</span></p><p><span>Until what the vision showed came to pass.</span></p><p><span>"Thank you," Agatha whispered, even though the promise was worthless. Even though she knew Rio's devotion would be exactly what destroyed them both.</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her again, and Agatha let herself fall into it. Let herself pretend, for just a few more moments, that love could be enough. That choosing each other could somehow protect them from prophecy.</span></p><p><span>Rio's hand slid down her side, over her hip, and Agatha gasped into her mouth. The touch sent fresh sparks of need through her oversensitive body.</span></p><p><span>"Once more?" Rio asked against her lips. "Before I have to leave?"</span></p><p><span>Agatha knew she should say no. Should push Rio toward the door before the household woke. Should start building the walls that would protect them both from what was coming.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she pulled Rio closer.</span></p><p><span>"Yes," she breathed. "Once more."</span></p><p><span>Rio took her time this round. Learning Agatha's body in the growing light, discovering what made her gasp and arch and beg. Her mouth traced paths across Agatha's skin while her fingers worked between Agatha's thighs with increasing confidence.</span></p><p><span>The pleasure built differently than it had the night before. Slower but deeper, like something fundamental shifting inside her. When Agatha came, she cried out Rio's name without shame.</span></p><p><span>But the ache didn't fade.</span></p><p><span>"Again," she heard herself whimper as Rio tried to pull away. "Please, I still need you. Once more is not enough."</span></p><p><span>"Anything you ask, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>By the time the desperate edge finally began to dull, Agatha was shaking, oversensitive, sated, and somehow still wanting.</span></p><p><span>They lay tangled together, breathing hard, Rio's hand stroking soothing patterns on Agatha's hip.</span></p><p><span>"What happens now?" Agatha asked quietly. "If this is... if my heat is really starting?"</span></p><p><span>"It'll build over the next day or so," Rio said. "Peak for maybe three days. Then fade." Her jaw tightened. "You'll need... assistance. To help you through it."</span></p><p><span>"You," Agatha said immediately, even though she knew it was impossible.</span></p><p><span>"I can't." Rio's voice was pained. "If we are discovered…" She shook her head. "They'd lock me up. Or worse. And you... They'd say you were compromised. Use it against you."</span></p><p><span>"I don't care."</span></p><p><span>"You should. I'm not going to let you throw everything away for me."</span></p><p><span>"But you said you’d come back for me,” Agatha pouted, too clouded to be self-conscious.</span></p><p><span>"And I meant it." Rio's thumb brushed across Agatha's cheekbone. "But that's different. That's planned. That's choosing to leave on our own terms. This would be getting caught. Getting trapped. Maybe never getting the chance to choose at all."</span></p><p><span>Agatha's chest tightened because she knew Rio was right. If her mother discovered them, there would be no olive groves. No freedom. Just scandal and confinement and whatever punishment her mother could devise that would preserve Agatha's value while destroying any possibility of happiness.</span></p><p><span>"Then what do I do?" Agatha whispered. "When the heat comes fully?"</span></p><p><span>Rio was quiet for a long moment. "Your mother will know. She'll smell it. She'll... she'll find a way to manage it. Some poultice, probably. Or—" Her voice went tight. "Or she'll find you someone appropriate. Someone who can—"</span></p><p><span>"No." The word came out fierce. "I won't. I can't let someone else. No one but you will touch me again."</span></p><p><span>"Shh." Rio kissed her forehead. "We'll figure it out. But for now, you need to rest. And I need to go before the household wakes fully."</span></p><p><span>"I don't want you to."</span></p><p><span>"I know. I don't want to go either." Rio's arms tightened around her. "But if I stay, we lose everything. If I leave now... there's still a chance."</span></p><p><span>Outside, the sounds of the household stirring were growing louder. Footsteps in distant corridors. The murmur of servants beginning their morning routines.</span></p><p><span>Rio extracted herself from the bed with visible reluctance, gathering her clothes. Agatha watched her dress, committing every moment to memory. Rio's hands shook slightly as she laced her boots, and she kept glancing back over her shoulder at the bed like she couldn't quite believe she had to leave it.</span></p><p><span>When she was fully dressed, Rio came back to the bedside and knelt there, taking Agatha's hand in both of hers.</span></p><p><span>"I need you to know something," Rio murmured, her lips pressing against Agatha’s knuckles.</span></p><p><span>"What?"</span></p><p><span>"If you need me, if something happens before I can come back for you, send word to the docks. Someone will know where to find me." Her grip tightened. "Promise me you'll do that. If you need me, you'll send word."</span></p><p><span>"I promise," Agatha whispered.</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded, satisfied. She leaned up and pressed one last kiss to Agatha's forehead before standing.</span></p><p><span>"As soon as I can," she said. "I'll work every day. Save every coin. And then I'm coming back for you."</span></p><p><span>"You’re coming back," Agatha echoed, the lie bitter on her tongue.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood and moved toward the window, pressing her hand to the ledge. She paused at the sill, looking back.</span></p><p><span>"I love you," Rio said simply. "I know it's too soon. I know we barely know each other. But I do. I love you."</span></p><p><span>Agatha's vision blurred. "Rio—"</span></p><p><span>"You don't have to say it back. I just... I needed you to know. The gods have struck me but even they in their might could not keep me from you."</span></p><p><span>And then she was gone, climbing out into the grey pre-dawn, disappearing into the garden below.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sat in the bed they'd shared, surrounded by sheets that smelled of cedar and salt and sex, and let herself cry.</span></p><p><span>Not because Rio had left.</span></p><p><span>Because she promised to come back.</span></p><p><span>And Agatha had already seen what would come after.</span></p><p><span>The warmth in her body was already building again. Her heat was coming, triggered by one impossible night with an alpha her body recognized as mate.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sat in the tangled sheets, still feeling the ghost of Rio's warmth beside her, and tried to make her body obey her mind. She needed to move. Needed to clean. Needed to erase any evidence of what had happened before…</span></p><p><span>Her body chose that moment to remind her exactly why that would be difficult.</span></p><p><span>Heat rolled through her in waves, starting low in her belly and spreading outward until her skin felt feverish. She pressed her palm to her sternum, feeling her heart race. This was different from earlier. Stronger. More insistent.</span></p><p><span>Rio's absence made it worse. Of course.</span></p><p><span>Agatha forced herself to stand and immediately regretted it. Her legs trembled, weak from exertion. She steadied herself against the bedpost and looked around her chambers with new eyes.</span></p><p><span>There was evidence everywhere</span></p><p><span>The sheets were rumpled and stained, smelling so strongly of alpha that anyone would be able to detect it, and she wrinkled her nose at the thought of someone recognizing the scent of what was hers. Her clothes from yesterday lay scattered across the floor where Rio had removed them. The wine cups sat on the low table, both used. The washbasin's water was cloudy from their earlier cleaning.</span></p><p><span>And she herself was worse than all of it.</span></p><p><span>Agatha caught sight of herself in the polished bronze mirror and barely recognized what she saw. Her hair was wild, curls escaping in every direction. Her lips were swollen and dark. Her skin was flushed, a sheen of sweat across her collarbone. And her scent, even she could smell the change in it. The honey-sweetness that Rio had mentioned, but underneath it now, something earthen and sharp blended in. As Rio's scent had seeped into her skin, it claimed her from the inside out.</span></p><p><span>She knew she had perhaps an hour. Maybe less before the servants came to wake her, to help her dress, to prepare her for the day's appointments.</span></p><p><span>The sheets. She had to deal with the sheets first.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stripped the bed with shaking hands, bundling the silk into a ball. She'd have to hide them. She couldn't let the servants take them to be washed, couldn't let anyone smell what was on them. But where? </span></p><p><span>Her chambers were searched regularly by her mother's people; nothing stayed hidden for long.</span></p><p><span>The window. She could throw them out into the garden, retrieve them later when…</span></p><p><span>No, someone might see. Worse, they might find them. They might hold what was left of Rio between their hands.</span></p><p><span>She commanded herself to think like her mother would, methodically and logically.</span></p><p><span>But her thoughts kept scattering like birds startled from their roost. The heat was building, making it hard to focus on anything except the ache between her thighs, the overwhelming need for Rio's scent, Rio's hands, and everything became a desperate refrain.</span></p><p><em><span>Rio. Rio. Rio.</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha pressed her palms to her eyes and took a shuddering breath. The vision flashed behind her closed lids—</span><em><span>why was there so much blood?</span></em><span>—and she used the horror of it to sharpen her focus.</span></p><p><span>For now, she shoved the sheets under her bed. It was not a permanent solution, but it would have to do until she could think more clearly. Then she moved to the washbasin, scrubbing at her skin with the cooling water. Trying to remove Rio's scent, trying to wash away the evidence of their night.</span></p><p><span>It didn't work.</span></p><p><span>The more she scrubbed, the more her own scent bloomed ripe. And beneath that, Rio's scent clung to her like a second skin. In her hair. On her breath. Between her thighs.</span></p><p><span>Agatha wanted to scream.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she pulled on a fresh chiton with trembling fingers, choosing one with long sleeves and a high neck. As if fabric could hide what her body was broadcasting. She tried to tame her hair, pinning it back with shaking hands, but it was hopeless.</span></p><p><span>Anyone with eyes would know something had happened.</span></p><p><span>Quickly, she dealt with the wine cups. She dumped the dregs out the window and rinsed them hastily, setting them back on the shelf. She kicked yesterday's clothes under the bed with the sheets. It was another problem for later.</span></p><p><span>A fresh wave of need rolled through her, and Agatha had to grip the edge of the table to stay upright. Her body was screaming for Rio. For an alpha. For relief from this building need that felt like it might consume her entirely.</span></p><p><span>How long did she have? Hours? Days?</span></p><p><span>Rio had said the heat would build over a day or so. Peak for three days. But Agatha could already feel it accelerating, her body responding to the absence of the alpha it had partially claimed as mate.</span></p><p><span>Agatha saw the sea glass on the table, the three pieces Rio had given her. Blue, green, amber. She picked them up and closed her fist around them, feeling their smooth edges press into her palm, and the grief hit her so suddenly she couldn't breathe.</span></p><p><span>Rio was gone.</span></p><p><span>Rio had promised to come back, but that was perhaps months away. And by then—</span></p><p><span>By then, Agatha would be whatever the vision had shown her.</span></p><p><span>She pressed the sea glass to her chest and let herself pour out desperate tears that she couldn't afford but couldn't stop. Her body shook with sobs and heat and fear all tangled together.</span></p><p><span>Footsteps in the corridor outside made her freeze.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shoved the sea glass under her pillow and wiped frantically at her face. She moved to the window, trying to look casual, trying to look like she'd just woken and was watching the dawn.</span></p><p><span>The footsteps passed. A servant heading elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha's heart was hammering. She couldn't stay in these chambers. Couldn't risk her mother coming to check on her, couldn't risk anyone noticing the sheets were missing from the bed, couldn't risk…</span></p><p><span>Another wave of heat. Stronger this time. She bit down on her lip to keep from whimpering.</span></p><p><span>Her mother would know. The moment she saw Agatha, smelled her, she would know.</span></p><p><span>And then she—</span></p><p><span>The door opened without warning.</span></p><p><span>Agatha spun, her carefully constructed composure shattering. She'd been so focused on the servants, on hiding evidence, that she hadn't heard her mother's distinctive footsteps. Hadn't rehearsed for this.</span></p><p><span>Her mother stood in the doorway, already dressed for the day, her expression neutral. She stepped inside and closed the door behind her with deliberate care.</span></p><p><span>Then her nose wrinkled. She lifted a hand as if she could fan the stench away.</span></p><p><span>"Agatha," her mother said, voice terrifyingly calm. "We need to talk."</span></p><p><span>"Mother, I…"</span></p><p><span>"Shh." Her mother cooed, stepping towards her. "I am not angry with you, sweet girl."</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt tears spill down her cheeks before she could stop them. Relief and fear tangled together until she couldn't tell which was which. Some distant part of her recognized this manipulation for what it was, but her body was too hot, too desperate, too exhausted to resist.</span></p><p><span>Her mother pulled her into an embrace. It was the first one Agatha could remember in years. It felt like being held by something that wore her mother's shape but had long forgotten how to be human. </span></p><p><span>She didn’t care.</span></p><p><span>"My poor girl," her mother murmured against her hair. "Look at the state of you."</span></p><p><span>"I'm sorry," Agatha sobbed, even though she wasn't. Even though she'd choose Rio again and again and again. "I didn't mean to."</span></p><p><span>"Of course you didn't." Her mother stroked her hair. An act that was tender on the surface, but her rings kept catching and pulling at the curls, sharp little tugs that made Agatha wince. </span></p><p><span>"You're sick, darling. Your heat is coming, and it's making you confused. Making you do things you'd never normally consider. Making you think you wanted…" She pulled back, cupping Agatha's face with both hands. "But don't worry. Mother knows how to help."</span></p><p><span>She pressed a kiss to Agatha's forehead, and it burned.</span></p><p><span>Her mother's nose wrinkled slightly, and her expression shifted. </span></p><p><span>"Though I must say, I'm more disturbed by this than I would have been finding you with an alpha between your thighs mid-knot."</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked, tears still falling. "What?"</span></p><p><span>"At least that would have shown some sense of duty. Some understanding of biology." Her mother's grip on her face tightened. "But this? Leaving you alone, reeking of their scent, shaking and feverish and desperate? What kind of alpha abandons an omega on the edge of heat?"</span></p><p><span>A physical slap would have stung less, but Agatha didn’t dare pull away. </span></p><p><span>"A true alpha would have stayed," her mother continued, her voice dripping with disdain. "Would have seen you through it properly. Would have taken responsibility for what they started. But instead, they used you and left you like this. Suffering. Empty. That tells me everything I need to know about whoever did this to you."</span></p><p><span>Agatha's chest constricted. She wanted to defend Rio. Wanted to scream that Rio had wanted to stay, that Agatha had sent her away.</span></p><p><span>But the words wouldn't come. Her body was too hot. Her mind too sluggish.</span></p><p><span>"You can tell me anything," her mother said, her voice softening again into something that almost sounded like concern. "I'm your mother. I only want what's best for you. So tell me true—this alpha who sullied you, do you care for them?"</span></p><p><span>The question was delivered so gently, so reasonably, that Agatha nearly answered honestly.</span></p><p><span>"No," she whispered through numb lips. "It was a mistake. It doesn't matter."</span></p><p><span>"Good." Her mother's thumb brushed away one of Agatha's tears. "Then you won't mind if I make sure it never happens again."</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded. It was easier than fighting. Easier than trying to explain that the person who'd left her like this had done so out of love, not cruelty. That Rio had begged to stay. That Agatha had been the one to push her away.</span></p><p><span>But her mother wouldn't understand that. Wouldn't believe it.</span></p><p><span>Or worse, would understand perfectly, and use it against her.</span></p><p><span>"Good girl," her mother murmured, releasing her face and smoothing down Agatha's sleep-mussed hair. "I'll make everything better. You won't have to suffer through this. You won't have to feel any of it."</span></p><p><span>The way she said it made Agatha's blood run cold, even through the rising heat.</span></p><p><span>"What are you going to do?"</span></p><p><span>Her mother's smile was terrible.</span></p><p><span>"What I should have done the moment you presented, darling." She tucked a stray curl behind Agatha's ear with deliberate tenderness. "I'm going to protect you from yourself."</span></p>
