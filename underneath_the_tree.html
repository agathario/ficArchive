     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Rio is back in her hometown after years of disappearance. Having always been seen as the black sheep for going three decades without meeting her soulmate, she finds herself awkwardly going through the motions of a rather disastrous family Christmas. But when a rather hasty brunette runs into her in town, Rio finds herself happy to spend as much time getting to know her before returning to the cruel reality of the holiday season.

     Chapter 1
    </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     A world where soulmates exist seems ideal. It removes the need to seek another out, to put oneself in the midst of a heartbreak for someone who may not be ‘the one’. Oftentimes those whose souls are bound meet within the first decade or two of their lives. There are rules the world follows where one solely communicates with a soulmate through the usage of a journal prior to meeting. No names or locations are able to be written.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Fate is what drives two souls together, not free will.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In rare cases, soulmates never have the pleasure of meeting. And when they do, often living in close proximity with one another, it is only the matching journals, filled with countless pages of conversations, that show one another they belong together. A difficult task it is to successfully find another’s half, yet truly fulfilling.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Sitting at the desk in her dimly-lit room, Rio sighs. It is often that she finds herself in said predicament, coffee near her dominant hand, a journal spread open before her with endless pages dating back decades, and glasses perched at the tip of her nose. She sighs, an almost trademark part of her nights, upon staring down at the blank page before her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Already in the depths of adulthood, she was unsure about her chances of meeting her soulmate anytime soon. For years she has fought hard in a frail attempt to solve the riddle of who her soul was bound to, but as always, it ended in deep disappointment. Currently she finds it easier to humor the notion of spending the rest of her days alone. But each time another word appears in her notebook, she falls for the phantom person once more.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Good evening, sweets. How are you?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
       Tired. I’m glad to be on break until the upcoming semester. I almost popped a vein grading all those shitty papers and exams last week.
      </strong>
</em>
     Rio writes back in green pen, a color which deliciously clashes against the purple that materializes on the page. During the Spring and Fall, she finds herself drowning in lecturing classes as a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon. Although the coziness of the Summer and Winter leaves her without many students to interact with, they are filled with continuing her research while jumping from conference to conference. At least for the blissful period that was Christmas and New Year’s, she basks in the peace she rarely achieves.
     <em>
<strong>
       How was the hospital today?
      </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I had a rough time with a patient, it’s a long story. I’d rather not talk about it for now. It was…heavy to say the least.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They are not able to tell each other much when it comes to identifying one another – the ink dries and turns transparent if they do. Yet as years go by, little fun facts are dropped here and there. That is enough to keep Rio excited for when they inevitably meet…at least she hopes enough.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
       I want us to meet. Not a week goes by where the same words are not written on the page. It hurts.
      </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Someday, sweetheart.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Even if she did not know the woman’s identity, Rio’s heart swelled for her. She shakes her head and looks away momentarily. Sometimes she entices the idea of never writing back, to instead disappear and take fate into her own hands. There is difficulty in communicating with someone whose status is nearly unknown. Most peers and family members of hers have met their other-halves within years of writing back and forth on the journals, but not Rio.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Of course, out of all people, she is the one to suffer through the brunt of never meeting her soulmate.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
       I hate Christmas.
      </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She doesn’t, not really anyway. After years of intricately avoiding her family during such a busy time, it is the one year where she is drafted to return home. Rio is unsure why she accepted the invitation in the first place. Perhaps she is getting quite tired of being constantly alone with nothing but the neighbor’s dog to interact with her on a daily basis, or maybe she misses her family but- no, that simply cannot be true. They never miss her in the same manner; she refuses to give them the benefit back.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     To soothe her isolation, she spends her time hopping from bed to bed with women who she meets in bars. She doesn’t know whether they have found their soulmates or even care to do so in the first place, but for one night, she can pretend her life is headed in a different direction. That she has finally found someone who gives her the affections her family often lacked growing up.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Great, my soulmate is the Grinch. Are you going to tell me you also hate Halloween?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
       You know my family doesn’t celebrate.
      </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I hoped they had a change of heart.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
       My mom’s side is full of catholic Puerto Ricans, do you really think they want to dress up for one night and go around random people’s houses asking for candy? Not even my dad cares that much about it.
      </strong>
</em>
     Rio shakes her head as she writes, her hand nearly cramping in the process.
     <em>
<strong>
       Although, honestly? Sometimes I think I might be a witch. Maybe my mom wants to keep me away from Halloween because she knows something I don’t.
      </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Ah! You’ve found your calling. I always knew there was something witchy about you, mor.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It had been years since she began calling her soulmate such a fond name, and in recent times, Rio received it back. She was almost sure whoever the other woman was, she had already spent quite some time learning her language. But felt the need to wait until their meeting to reveal such a curious fact. Regardless, Rio would greet her with open arms and a proud smile.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
       Maybe I can cast a spell to get us to finally meet.
      </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio hates it, oh by the gods she hates it. Each passing day she scribbles her name over and over on the yellow-ish page of her journal, but it magically disappears with passing time. She wishes to get around it, to be able to tell her soulmate about the absolute dumpster-fire that Sewickley, in the outskirts of Pittsburgh, will be with her family running amok and her being witness to it. But fate — with idiosyncratic humor and a reasoning seeping with idiocy — refused to let it be so simple.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      That would be nice, but you know the rules. We’ll meet one day, I promise. Hope is getting lost in translation, they both know it yet neither will admit it. Don’t give up on me just yet.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
       I know.
      </strong>
</em>
     Rio sighs as the ink from her pen begins fading away, but she refuses to let her go. She grabs another one and quickly scribbles down more words. Even if she went on another second without meeting her soulmate, the comfort she received via written words was enough for now. Sometimes, though, she wonders how long that will last for.
     <em>
<strong>
       I don’t want to see them. They will make fun of me again. I can already hear my cousin comparing me to one of those lonely cat ladies.
      </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In their late teens, her cousin had met his soulmate. Rio found it difficult to believe there was not an official rule which led each of her family members to berate her for being in her late thirties, single, and living alone – the universe truly was cruel to her. At times she muses the thought of hiring an actress to play the part of her soulmate just to get them off her back, but of all people, her mother would know the dishonesty lying behind.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I’ll be here for you, baby. Every. Single. Day. All you have to do is write, okay? I know we can’t see each other just yet, but you’re not alone.
     </em>
     The words make Rio smile, even if slightly. But part of her does not believe them.
     <em>
      Hell, I know a thing or two about shitty families. You know how my mom reacted when I told her my soulmate isn’t a man.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Ah, how badly Rio remembers such a horrid day. It had been long hours since she last heard of her soulmate, and when she eventually did, it was to say how she had been kicked out of her own home in the midst of a snowy winter during their teen years. There was no true appreciation for the season in part of the other woman, something which comforts Rio knowing they could share such disappointment. Yet she often finds herself wishing to reach out across the page, to hold her future — hopefully — partner’s hand and be the family she lacked.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Someday, she repeats to herself, maybe someday.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
       Are you celebrating with Wanda again?
      </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Of all the names she knew, so far Wanda was her favorite before she inevitably found out her soulmate’s name. The woman had begged her mother to let her friend stay with them upon being kicked out of the house. For years Wanda had been Rio’s soulmate’s rock. For that, she would forever be grateful. Although, at times, there came jealousy in knowing the other person had met such a wonderful woman as her soulmate, even in a platonic manner.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio would give up everything for that opportunity.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Maybe, we’ll see. Her and Nat are having issues with the boys. Apparently Billy keeps sneaking out to meet his boyfriend. And someone keeps sending him gas money to make that possible…
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
       Oh, honey.
      </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      It’s not my fault he trusts me so much! The kid needs this. Hell, I remember sneaking out at that age to make out with some girl in a dark Burger King parking lot.
     </em>
     They were crass about the relationships they had with others. If anything, it is refreshing for Rio to know her soulmate is in good hands, that her heart is protected without the presence of her other half.
     <em>
      It’s a normal teen experience. Besides, he’s just happy to have found his soulmate. They need to let that kid be an ordinary 16-year-old.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
       At 16, I wasn’t even allowed to leave the house without asking for permission and having a chaperone with me.
      </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      That really was a rough time for you, huh?
     </em>
     Embarrassing is more like it. To this day, Rio has difficulty reminiscing in such moments without physically cringing.
     <em>
      I still remember when you told me you tried sneaking out the window and broke your leg on the way down.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
       My mom never lets me forget it. She’s always like ‘bueno que te haya pasado, por pendeja.’
      </strong>
</em>
     Rio giggles when recalling her mother’s reaction. Although she had dealt with the burden of exasperated yells, she knew it all came from love. Sometimes it was shown differently, sometimes she did not believe in it.
     <em>
<strong>
       Hey, I miss you.
      </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They had yet to meet, but each of them already deeply longed for the other. Perhaps it would forever remain that way.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I miss you too, honey. We’ll meet soon.
     </em>
     The words are blurry in Rio’s eyes; it’s not the first time she sees them, and won’t be the last.
     <em>
      I can’t wait to see how beautiful my girl is. Now, get some rest. It’s late there. After years, they found out they are in the same time zone. You have a very long day tomorrow. You need all the rest you can get before having an aneurysm at your mother’s house.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
       I wish you were here to take care of me then, doctor.
      </strong>
</em>
     That was one of her favorite facts when it came to her soulmate. Regardless of how much difficult experienced in her formative years, the woman had apparently made a name for herself in the medical world. She had swiftly breezed through medical school and a tough residency before becoming the chief of obstetrics and gynecology at…Rio wishes to know.
     <em>
<strong>
       The day we meet, I’ll make you give me a full physical-examination for free. I think you owe me.
      </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      You know I’m not that kind of doctor, sweets.
     </em>
     The honorific brings a pang of joy to Rio’s chest.
     <em>
      But for you, maybe I’ll do it. I suppose it can’t be that difficult. Whenever the twins so much as start coughing, Natasha frantically texts me to check them out. I live six hours away from them and they still want me to do full check-ups over the phone.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
       Well, you are an amazing doctor so-
      </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     But before Rio could finish writing, another set of words appeared on the page.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Stop stalling and go to sleep!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Her heart aches when they say their goodnights. Over and over, Rio’s full name is written on the page, but nothing comes from it. She is desperate, growing madder as time passes. Her thoughts are consumed by a phantom woman whose face she will always try to draw in her mind.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     By the time she finds soothing sleep, the room’s darkness mirrors that of her internal turmoil. The torturous days she would spend with her family brought nightmares to Rio. She mused the thought of leaving prior to New Year’s and having some days to herself, but knowing her family, they would hold her hostage with venomous verbiage and harrowing looks.
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     At the very least, she has her soulmate to keep her company, even if only through faceless words.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Snow had begun trickling down the murky sky upon the arrival at the destination. The drive was no more than 25 minutes, yet took almost an hour through backroads Rio swore were necessary. Realistically, she would put as much time necessary between her and her family. And if it meant being stuck in a light snowfall behind a truck going at 30 miles-per-hour through rural Pennsylvania, so be it.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     By the time she arrived, the urge to leave nearly brought her back home.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Sitting outside the cobblestone house, Rio sighs. She lets her forehead fall against the steering wheel of her car with a rather painful thud. It does not hurt her as much as she is sure her family will. They truly have a colorful manner with the verbiage spit towards her. Within the first handful of minutes, she bets to herself, a crude comment would be thrown her way. It is only a matter of who drops the ball first.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She grabs a present from the passenger seat – a simple piece of hand-crafted china she knew her mother would become crazed over. An preemptive olive-branch of sorts.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There is no knock or ringing of a doorbell. The family dog, a senior mutt her mother rescued from her hometown of Moca, sniffed the stress through the front entrance. In the span of a second, the matriarch of the family swung it open to lay her judging eyes upon a chilly Rio who hugged herself through the long, slim coat.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Ay, mija,” Beatriz begins, and Rio already knows to ground herself. “Pero tu estas muy pálida. Ya te pareces a la misma nieve.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Conserving her peace, Rio decides to ignore the jab against her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Bendición, mami.” Rio plants a quick kiss on her mother’s cheek, but her hug lingers. Otherwise, she was sure an argument would stew. “How are you?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “¿Cómo que ‘how are you’, ni que ‘how are you’? Aquí tú me hablas español.” Her mother instantly huffs — it makes Rio rethink all the choices she made which led her to that moment. “No estoy de buen humor, nena. Que tu pai’ ya me encabronó y-”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “That’s nice, ma. I’m just gonna say hi to everyone,” Rio stops the woman before she goes into a long tangent. She hands her the present in her hands before making a speedy motion to shift away. “Te amo.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In the house she once referred to as a home, she is an alien. She promptly greets her family members, some family friends, and even the pets everyone was too anxious to leave back in their homes. But even as hard as she fakes her grins, Rio is pushed to the corner of the living room, hands gripping her second cup of red wine, with the family dog pushing a toy to her hands.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “So, where’s your soulmate?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The voice makes her squeeze the wine glass even more, and for a moment she humors the thought of ‘accidentally’ spilling it on the man who shifts to her side.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Where’s your license?” She shoots back, her eyes sharp. “Oh, I’m sorry, I forgot you had it suspended with your last DUI. It’s been…three now in the span of two years? Must be hard to get around with your wife driving you all over the place.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The words were loud enough that a few members within the house turned to them. Elias always had a knack of humiliating others, but two could play at that game. Knowing all her family’s secrets and sticking to the walls upon listening in had its perks.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “It was a mistake,” he huffs, but Rio rolls her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “The only mistake here was your kids,” Rio mumbles as she takes another sip of alcohol. The warmth it elicits in her brings a comfort she lacks. “Wear protection much?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re a bitch,” Elias says, but in truth it is not the first time he lashes out. “Maybe that’s why you’re all alone.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Wow, good one. I hadn’t heard that one before.” It is only a few days until Christmas Eve, yet Rio’s patience has already been thinned. “You really like showing off that room-temperature IQ, huh? It’s astonishing how the universe gave someone like you a soulmate. Just imagine what torture it is to be stuck next to you for an eternity…”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She doesn’t hear his reply, because by the time she finishes, Elias is rushing off in search of someone to reprimand her. The same excuse gets thrown her way – ‘you take it too far’, they always say. If she was being honest, she never went far enough.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The lights brought her to a dizzy spell, and soon enough Rio found herself back outside. She doesn’t smoke, not officially anyway, but a cigarette she dug from her father’s desk makes its way into her mouth ready to be lit. At the first taste of the scorched, dry fume, she shudders warmly.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Snow melts as it lands on the top of her head. The more it comes, the wetter the strands of brown get. Her skin grows colder, and as seconds pass, she loses feeling across her body. The numbness is fitting. Rio basks in it without fighting back. In the background she can hear the hushed whispers of her family spilling her name through poisonous conversations. That was truly the cherry on top of visiting her family.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She didn’t realize when she began walking, but by the time Rio regained her consciousness, lights surrounded her. Making her way into the heart of town, she ushers herself through busy roads by foot. The cigarette butt lands on the floor before being stepped over by a chunky boot.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Through the town she gets waves and beams. Her responses are forced yet quiet. The world beyond that of the sharp claws of her family is peaceful. Each time Rio returns to them, an aspect of her soul decays, one her fate-bound mate is unable to mend.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     One day they would be together, she hopes, and then she would experience what a true family is.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     While stuck in her mind, Rio fails to notice a rather hasty brunette rushing towards her, nose stuck on her phone typing furiously. They walk towards the other, each lost in their own world. And upon crashing with the other, all that is heard are frustrated yelps.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “What the fuck,” Rio growls. “Watch where you’re-”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “-fucking Christ,” came the wail from the other woman. “Shit, my coffee. Oh gosh, I’m sorry. It’s spilled all over you.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     At first Rio failed to notice, but as the searing liquid seeped into her clothes, a grimace came to her features. She starts fighting off the woman who tries to pull her up, but upon catching a glance of her, the motions stop.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “It’s fine.” There was something about the woman she was unable to put her finger on, but by the gods did Rio’s heart soar. “It’s an old shirt, don’t worry about it. Somehow this is not the worst thing I’ve been through all day.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Touché,” the brunette giggles. “My soulmate has had quite the day today. Seems like the Christmas bug is going around.” She pulls Rio upwards, cleaning off the dirt from her coat. “I’m having quite the day myself.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Did you also get coffee spilled on you by a stranger?” The comment was not meant to elicit laughter, but as the noise came from the mysterious person, the ends of Rio’s mouth rose. “I’m Rio, by the way.” She reaches out for a proper greeting. “And you are?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” the other brunette says, grabbing the hand to shake it gently. “Pleased to meet you. I feel like I owe you a visit to the laundromat.” She eyes the growing brown stain on Rio’s previously white shirt, lingering there unbeknownst to her counterpart. “Maybe a new shirt.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “A little bit forward there, huh?” The newfound attention makes her forget about the horrors she endured with her family. “I like it.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The two of them stand close to each other. For a moment the nearly negative-degree weather is forgotten. All of Rio’s focus lands over the pair of light eyes who begin haunting her living dreams. She would not easily forget them.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “Listen, I’m running late to meet my friend, but at least let me make it up to you. I’ll buy you a cup of coffee tomorrow. I need an excuse to drink some of the espresso I swore off,” Agatha laughs. For a moment, Rio’s eyes furrow regardless of the lighthearted tone — her soulmate did the same when it came to coffee. What a hilarious coincidence. “Tomorrow, right here at twelve. My treat.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She leaves as soon as she comes, throwing a quick glance at Rio before disappearing into the winter wonderland. In her wake, a rather staggered professor stands still. The stench of coffee on her shirt is forgotten, instead replaced by the mental image of the woman she would see on the following day.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The week would be difficult to endure. Between her helicopter mother and uncaring rest of the family, Rio would require a handful of wine cups a day to keep herself sane. Her car keys would be left on the bedside table if need-be. She could not explain it, but part of her believed in the need for an exit strategy.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     But as she remembers Agatha, a sweet brush of color in the monochrome taint her world had become, Rio finds herself realizing that maybe there is something, someone, worth staying for.

<p>
     A curtain of white sprinkles down the town, slow and steady as it goes. The snow barely sticks to the ground, instead turning only messy puddles which inevitably freeze over with the cold. It becomes easy to slip and fall, but that is not enough to stop a rather stubborn Agatha from carefully making her way to the front door of a cobblestone house.
    </p>
<p>
     Her breath is visible as she steps up to the door, hastily knocking on it as her skin grows blue. Even with a multitude of layers covering her body, the poor woman shakes in a frail manner. She hugs herself, cursing at the people within the confines of the house who refuse to let her inside.
    </p>
<p>
     And when the door finally opens, she gasps.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was about fucking time,” are the first words to spill from a rather exasperated Agatha. She rumbles through the door, her cheeks bright red mirroring that of her friend’s hair.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well excuse me. I didn’t know I was bringing the Grinch into my home.”
    </p>
<p>
     The comment and its annunciation represent that of a clearly distressed soccer mom living in suburbia; Agatha knows.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ho-ho-ho,” Agatha huffs, each syllable slurred slower than the last.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you cold?’ Wanda wonders out loud. “I can light up the fireplace after I finish making breakfast.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I’m just peachy. My nose just about fell off from the mini-blizzard that’s going on outside, but don’t worry, all is well,” Agatha’s voice reeks of annoyance. “The black ice almost killed me, no biggie though.”
    </p>
<p>
     All Wanda can muster is an eye roll. “You’re so dramatic.”
    </p>
<p>
     The house is a familiar, safe place, regardless of her months-long absence. Such a quiet life her friend lives clashes with that of Agatha, whose New York apartment constantly brought in noises from the chaotic outside world. As a doctor she found it difficult to adjust to such normalcy, one she often avoided – the reminders of her past life, one she once shared with her mother, were far too painful.
    </p>
<p>
     In disarray, Agatha thrives. It disallows her from spending more than five seconds focusing on her unfulfilling life. Instead, she chooses to support others, to be an advocate for her patients while remaining quiet and lonesome herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Sometimes, it is not enough to wipe the sorrow stricken in her features upon returning to an empty home.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s Nat?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She had to go to the city to help fix her sister’s sink. Apparently Kate accidentally dropped a plastic fork into the garbage disposal and it won’t turn on anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them make their way to the living room, but Wanda stands slightly back soon enough to return to the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds boring.” Agatha slumps on the familiar couch. She gives a gentle smile to the adolescent twins lounging around on their phones. “Hey, kids.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re 16,” Tommy scoffs, turning away from her mother and the brunette. “Not kids.”
    </p>
<p>
     In contrast, his brother beams upon the sight of Agatha. “Hey!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your voice is squeaky,” is all Agatha can say. “Are you sure you’re not 12?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You came to our 16th birthday party,” Billy frowns, but swiftly shakes his head. And when his mother leaves them, rolling her eyes playfully in her wake, he leans in. “Hey, I found some old pictures in the attic of you and my mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You have two moms, kid. That doesn’t really narrow it down much.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not a kid,” Billy says, yet does not find any offense to the comment – if anything, he adores the moments Agatha, someone he considers an unofficial aunt, visits them. From his sweatshirt that reads off the shared alma mater of Agatha and Wanda, he produces a rather faint polaroid. “Look. You guys seem really close. Close like mom and ma do now.”
    </p>
<p>
     That part of her past is not one Agatha often bothers herself remembering. In their youth, prior to forming a much deeper connection with their respective soulmates, the two women found solace in one another. Back then, there was not much she had to live for. Her mother had kicked her from the house at a young age, and Wanda, oh sweet Wanda, took her in like the lost puppy she once mirrored.
    </p>
<p>
     “She didn’t tell you two about that? Hell, even your ma knows.” Agatha relaxes, taking the picture between her fingers; it was one she had taken eons before. She held up the camera in it with Wanda cuddled closely to her side. Although it was a rather awkward occurrence for her then-lover’s son to have found such an intimate token of a life she once lived, it made her smirk slightly to reminisce over it. “We were just kids then, teen.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Were you guys ever…” His voice was a hushed whisper. “...more than just friends?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, once upon a time we were.” Uncomfortable conversations be damned, Agatha admits it. “Long, long ago, Wanda and I used to be this thing called friends with-”
    </p>
<p>
     Stemming from the kitchen, she could sense a redness corroding her friend’s features before she exploded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!”
    </p>
<p>
     The yelp made her stop, and instead Agatha broke into a fit of laughter. Teasing the redhead never got old, regardless of how many decades they spent annoying the other relentlessly. And with such an exasperating holiday coming soon, the entertainment was much-needed.
    </p>
<p>
     “-and the rest is history! The end.”
    </p>
<p>
     But Billy, whose eyes are wide as saucers, refuses to let go. Even after Agatha leaves, she knows full well the boy was stubborn enough to pester her phone day and night for a proper answer. And unless Wanda greenlit such a confidential topic, the brunette’s mouth would remain shut.
    </p>
<p>
     “You were friends with benefits?” He asks, mouth left agape as such information.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you know what that is?” Wanda questions from the kitchen, her horror evident in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “To be fair, not everyone lives under a rock like you do, Wands.” Agatha pipes up, but the glare she feels even from far away is enough to make her physically back off. “Never mind.” Turning to the boy once more, she devilishly beams. “Hey, kid. Has your mom ever told you how she actually met your ma? Because that is one hell of a sto-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!”
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The creaks across the decades-old home are what force Rio out of her slumber. And as her eyes involuntarily come to open, the frown upon her face is instantaneous. Oh, she did not miss the annoyance a singular place could elicit on her being.
    </p>
<p>
     Normally she makes it a clear pattern to wake up early, around six o’clock, to run across her neighborhood even underneath the skin-crawling cold before making herself breakfast. But in her menacing childhood home, she waits until nine to roll out of bed, refusing to face even one of her family members in the process. Growing up she detested the manner in which her room had to be chucked into the basement of the house, but now it felt like a blessing.
    </p>
<p>
     No one could stumble upon her by accident.
    </p>
<p>
     How peaceful.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time Rio finds the courage to go upstairs, the house is empty. All members of the family have either gone off to explore whatever entertainment they can surmise in a town stopped in time, while the others are simply joyous to crawl away from the grasp of her controlling mother. If it were up to her, they would all be put to work on the upcoming Christmas Eve party she hosts at her home each year; Rio cannot think of a worse recipe for disaster.
    </p>
<p>
     “¿Y como te va con tu alma gemela?”
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as she waltzes into the kitchen, she is pounced on by her mother’s secretly judgmental question. It makes Rio shrug, and rather than reply, she opts to grab a searing cup of coffee by the kitchen island. Albeit hot, she takes a decent mouthful. The pain is enough to numb her through the conversation she was pushed into. If only there was some alcohol in the vicinity she could use to shut her brain off…
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s going well,” she lies. There is a seat across from her mother open, and she takes it rather than sit beside the woman. “We’re, uh, getting there. Some day, maybe.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sit up straight,” Beatriz orders, her voice gaining strength as she switches languages. “You’re not getting any younger. I want grandkids. A lot of them.” The statement is not lost in Rio, who has heard it every few weeks since she turned 18. “Just look at your cousins. You see how happy they are? You could have that too if you weren’t such a…
     <em>
      pendeja
     </em>
     , and put your big girl pants on to find your soulmate.” Her mother doesn’t turn, but Rio can sense the manner in which her facial features scrunch up with disapproval – the face she knows oh-so well. “No seas tan sanana. Yo te crié mejor que eso.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re very happy. Thrilled, even. Those DUIs are definitely the talk of the party,” Rio mutters into the coffee cup, rolling her eyes at the thought of her cousins. Not a day went by growing up where she was not compared to them. At times she wonders if her mother would have rather have them as children instead of her. But then again, maybe she would prefer that as well. “I’m leaving in a few hours. Do you need me to grab you anything while I’m out?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re supposed to come with me to the grocery store. Am I supposed to grab the pernil by myself?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Get Elias to do it. I hear he loves driving around.” The sharp stare she receives makes Rio giggle as she makes a beeline towards the sink. “I’m meeting someone, ma. Give me a list and I’ll get everything, you can stay here. God knows I need a break from this place already.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do not use the Lord’s name in vain. I’ve told you that before!” But all Rio does is make a mocking face. “I’m serious.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, fine.” She moves to wash the cup of coffee, only half way empty, with her mother hovering over her shoulder. “Can I help you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who are you meeting?” Beatriz asks. “You don’t have any friends.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ma, I have friends! Ya deja de meterte en lo que no te incumbe,” Close ones, maybe not, but on Fridays her and a handful of professors from the department get together for drinks. The alcohol made it bearable to Rio to be around them. But her mother did not have to know they were solely coworkers. “Do you want me to get you the stuff or not? I’m not going to sit around waiting for you to write me a list.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh-huh,” her mother responds, and Rio just about prays for the garbage disposal to swallow her whole. The experience, she muses, would be less painful than what she currently endures. “Is it a girl?” Silence befalls upon them. “Is it your soulmate?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I hope not.” Soulmates are paired based on the proximity to one another once they are born or continue growing up. Before the age of five, each person has someone who they are bound to. Rio remained local even after attaining her graduate degrees with the high hope of finding her soulmate – and yet, she never came. Her wish is that her soulmate is from a neighboring town, and that she hopefully never has to meet her mother. “It’s none of your business.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pero no me jodas, si eres mi hija. Of course it’s my business,” Beatriz says as though it is the most obvious thing in the universe. “Put some make-up on before you go. You’re not attracting your soulmate if you look like a zombie.”
    </p>
<p>
     The comment is not rare. At this point in her life, it is immortalized in her brain. A cruel reminder of each judgmental and snide remark made her way.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks, ma.” Rio rolls her eyes. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     By the time noon rolls around, all that comes is a wave of uncertain realization crashing down. One with immense power, and a mighty will which would push down anyway in its way. The anxiety is far too strong to combat it.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio sits in her car, fingers squeezing the daylights out of her steering wheel, she finds it impossible to resort to calmness.
    </p>
<p>
     Her nostrils flare as she finds some serene words to ground herself. It is an uncharacteristic way for her to react to a simple lunch with someone else – not even an official date. Normally, a cool and calm demeanor is what presents on her during dates. But not even Rio could muster out a single thought as to why her stress grew at the thought of Agatha. Although, if she was being fair, it is the first time she ever dares to go out with someone from her town. The close proximity to what she once knew as her home makes her tense.
    </p>
<p>
     At least that is what she ingrains in her mind so as to not drive herself madder.
    </p>
<p>
     The wintry atmosphere does not phase her as she exits the car. Her hands are clammy within the confines of her coat, and Rio only hopes Agatha does not want to shake them. Pushing part of the front door of the coffee shop, the welcoming bell mocking her, she looks around and is relieved to find a messy head of brown hair at the corner of the locale.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.” At the squeaky sound of her voice dripping with atypical joy, Rio nearly barfs. If it weren’t for the coffee shop being packed, she would have bolted and never returned to the town. Not even if her mother pried her out of the Pittsburgh apartment with her bare hands. “Long time no see.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips are tainted with black, a shade her mother detest, but she cannot help but rebel. Rio finds pride in having a pair of blue eyes stare at them, pupils dilating as a tongue sticks out to lick chapped lips. Her ego only grows, as does her seemingly non-existent confidence.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, you look like shit.” The comment elicits laughter from both women simultaneously. “Sorry, but you look exhausted. Beautiful, but tired. Rough night?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sits across from Agatha. She takes her time in pushing off the stuffy coat, leaving her body solely covered by a black high-neck sweater. It’s a hue which matches her fingernails, and she notices, also bodes well with the dark green cardigan Agatha dons – her favorite color.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m staying with my parents for the holiday and after all these years, they still refuse to fix their creaky floorboards.” Rio shakes her head. “I couldn’t sleep well.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that’s why I chose a hotel. I love my friend and her kids, but I refuse to share a living space with that many people. It’s…fuck me, it sounds claustrophobic.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Welcome to my world.” Rio allows herself time to take in the situation. Albeit slightly nervous still, she cannot help but relax at the nicety she found herself experiencing. “Do you want to eat anything?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I ordered some chicken paninis and warm soup. I hope that’s alright.” Agatha throws a soft beam her way, and Rio shudders with happiness. “I just assumed you would be cold and hungry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I do love me a woman who takes charge easily,” Rio teases.
    </p>
<p>
     But to finally meet her match is something that leaves her flabbergasted.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re in luck, that’s my expertise.”
    </p>
<p>
     The retort leaves Rio without words, who rather opts to look down with a mixture of excitement and defeat.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, uh, what do you do for work? I assume you’re not from around here,” Rio breaks the ice.
    </p>
<p>
     “I'm a doctor at New York Presbyterian.” It is not the entirety of the truth, but on first dates, Agatha typically refuses to dive deep into what her specialty is. Otherwise, she fears going on a long tangent explaining her passion in totality. “I cannot tell you how many times I’ve had to lie about that so people don’t come up to me asking to have their weird moles checked out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Trust me, I know the feeling. I have a PhD in health psychology. Everyone and their mother wants to pour their hearts out to me. It makes me want to pull my hair. Even my family thinks I’m their own personal therapist.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sometimes I tell people I work in finance and they’re usually too bored by it to ask more questions,” Agatha shrugs. “I really should have had the decency to check you out yesterday. I hope I didn’t cause you first degree burns.”
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, she definitely checked her out – Rio was sure of it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t worry about it. If anything, you did me a favor by staining that hideous shirt. It was a birthday present from my mother ages ago,” Rio pauses, glad to have been given the green light to throw it out after unsuccessful attempts to salvage it from the huge coffee stain. “It has frilly sleeves so, uh, I appreciate you spilling coffee on me.”
    </p>
<p>
     It is Agatha who, after light conversation, rises at the sound of her name. She brings to the table two plates of food, and although Rio detests spinach on her sandwiches, she does not have the heart to tell the woman so. Instead, she swallows every leaf as though it is a delicacy. The last thing she wants is to scare off the woman who bodes so well with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, are you one of those rare people without a soulmate?” Rio eventually blurts out.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I have one. We just…God, this is going to sound insane, but we haven’t met yet,” the last part was muttered out, a sound which Rio barely registers. “We, uh, have an understanding. I don’t mind getting to know someone else in the meantime.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m on the same boat, actually. But I try to keep my head held high.” Until eventually, she doesn’t. It has been two days since she last heard of her soulmate, and although hurt, Rio finds herself not minding while in the presence of another. “I’ve met others who haven’t met their soulmates yet. Eventually we’ll meet someday, I’m in no rush.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s funny, actually.” Rio raises her head to meet Agatha’s eye as she speaks. “A pretty girl like you without a soulmate. It’s my lucky day.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve been told I’m a Christmas miracle here and here,” Rio jokes. “Maybe you are too.”
    </p>
<p>
     For what feels like eons, realistically only two hours, the two of them share animated conversations. As the clientele goes in and out, they remain in their seats, giggling with one another through each word. Neither wishes to leave, not as they tear through uncharted waters within the other, prying information after information to grow closer.
    </p>
<p>
     By their second cup of chai, it is a ding from Rio’s phone that breaks the talkative women apart.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit, sorry.” Rio ruffles through her phone, frowning as she frustratingly types back a reply to the message she received. “I forgot my mother asked me to pick up some things for her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s got you running errands for her?” Agatha questions, her eyebrows raised as she sips her drink.
    </p>
<p>
     “When doesn’t she?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds like someone I know,” Agatha chuckles through her chai, unaware of the familiarity of the situation. “My friend wants me to shop around a bit for her, but I’ll just leave it off until tomorrow. I really cannot be bothered, not after having such a nice time here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hm?” Agatha’s eyes glint as she stares deeply into Rio’s. The dark and light of their orbs meshes well together. “What’s going on in that big brain of yours, sweets?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You could come with me.” The confidence within Rio arose, standing off against Agatha’s pride. “It would be a pretty interesting first date.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, so now we’re going on a date?”
    </p>
<p>
     But Rio only raises her eyebrows in a challenge. “Is there a problem with that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bites her bottom lip to suppress a smirk that forms on her face. A rather long time had passed since she last experienced such a thrill, leaving her heart palpitating for more. Oh how badly she craved such a high.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no problem at all.”
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The ride to the grocery store is quiet as each woman takes their separate cars. The sudden silence throws Agatha out of whack. Her mind is solely set on the fellow brunette who she spent all noon chatting with, and even as she arrives at the locale, the urge to speak to Rio once more is imminent.
    </p>
<p>
     But the world stands still, her chest ceasing its heaving, by the time she sets her sights on the brown-eyed woman at the front of the store.
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them stroll from isle to isle together at a slow space, at times each of them placing items on the cart Agatha carefully pushes. Their conversation from the coffee shop is casually continued. Almost as though time refused to pass until they were together again.
    </p>
<p>
     And when it comes time to grab coffee for her mother, it is up to Rio to fight tooth-and-nail for the last bag available. All over the top shelf. One which, even with Agatha’s protests, she stubbornly tries to climb atop.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t reach it,” Rio groans, reaching out with her arm as far as she is physically able to, but coming up just a few centimeters empty of touching the last coffee bag. Turning to Agatha, she only hopes the woman either brings support or is still fond of her after such an embarrassing excuse of an attempt. “Fuck me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s our first date, hon. That’s a bit premature,” Agatha jokes, and the laughter nearly makes Rio fall off the shelf. “Well, don’t look at me. I’m too proud to even try. I know better than to make a fool out of myself.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you calling me a fool?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe.” Her smile is intoxicating, Rio wishes to bathe in it. Forever keep it by her side. “You’re a very good-looking fool though.” Light blue eyes shift downwards to the other woman’s backside. “
     <em>
      Incredibly
     </em>
     good-looking.”
    </p>
<p>
     The blunt display of being checked out made Rio feel inferior, even if momentarily. And as hard as she fought, she could not contain the manner in which her cheeks turned slightly rosy. “You don’t even try to hide it, huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want me to?” Agatha challenges, her eyebrows raised. When no response came, she got an answer. “That’s what I thought.”
    </p>
<p>
     After a tedious amount of time and the help of an employee, Rio chucks the pack of ground coffee into the cart – dusting herself off in the process as though it was nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them travel towards the meat section where Rio kindly asks for enough pork meat to feed a small army. She stands on her tip-toes, feigning a smile to the employee as Agatha unashamedly watches her; all of her. Their heights are not too different, but even then there is a slight tallness to her that the brown-eyed woman will never attain.
    </p>
<p>
     That is far too adorable to not entertain.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pork?” Agatha wonders as she helps the struggling woman toss it into the cart. “This is…a lot.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pernil is a delicacy where my mom’s from,” Rio explains. “I usually stick to the turkey. In my mind, it’s less greasy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Where is she from?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Puerto Rico.” Rio guides them across the store. “But she moved here in her twenties. That’s when she met my dad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh, that’s beautiful.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Just like you
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     A phantom urge to sputter out the words was immense, but Agatha held herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, where are your parents?” But as silence came, Rio frowned. “Or is that more of a ‘fifth date with three wine glasses’ type of information?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I prefer saying I don’t have parents. It makes it a bit easier.” Agatha shrugs off the discomfort at the sudden thought of her blood family. “They don’t matter, not really. I have my chosen family here and back where I live. It’s enough for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have brought it up.” Her hand barely grazes Agatha’s body as she sympathetically touches her arm, but it is enough to shoot an electrifying jolt down her body. “I’m glad you have someone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.” Agatha loses herself in Rio’s presence. “Me too.”
    </p>
<p>
     As the two of them finish off their respective shopping, they stand in a rather kilometric line which leads them to the midst of a busy aisle. The last-minute shoppers, then included, all barrel across the store in search of food to prepare. Such loud noises and multitudes of people are enough to drive a headache through Rio’s skull.
    </p>
<p>
     It only gets worse as a man, seemingly a few years older than her, stalks close.
    </p>
<p>
     “Long line, huh?” He awkwardly states, leaving Rio and Agatha to look at one another incredulously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Very long,” Agatha replies.
    </p>
<p>
     “Insane,” Rio adds.
    </p>
<p>
     “At least we can keep each other company. I’m Brad, by the way.”
    </p>
<p>
     He reaches out a hand, but Rio refuses to shake it, let alone touch it.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a fitting name.” She leans against the cart, already feeling the laughing jitters arising in the other woman when Brad remains close to them. “Can I help you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jeez, can’t a guy say hi to a girl he finds cute?” He makes a poor-excuse of an attempt to check her out, but the daggers he receives from Agatha are enough to force his actions to a halt. “Listen, I know this really cool bar in Pittsburgh you might like. I know we just met, but they give chicks free drinks after a certain time. And hey, maybe if he hit it off, you can come back to my place and-”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m pregnant, actually,” Rio interrupts the ramble, then points to a seething Agatha whose knuckles turn white as she grips the shopping cart’s handle. It is the first time they spend more than a handful of seconds together, but are already overcome with grandiose emotions for the other. “She’s the dad. We’re having twins.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh,” is all he says.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, yeah,” Rio elongates the ‘oh’ with a proud smile. “But if we get a divorce, I’ll make sure you are the very first person to call.” But by then, the man is already making an awkward escape, leaving his items to perish on a nearby shelf. “No, I’ll be so sad if you leave,” her monotone voice adds salt to his injury. “Well, there goes the love of my life.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You seemed very happy together. When’s the wedding?”
    </p>
<p>
     “March 32nd. It’s the day we first met fifty years ago,” Rio jokes, but the flatness of her face is enough to turn her into an Academy Award-winning actress. “We were so young and full of life then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha breaks first, but is quickly followed by Rio who roars with laughter at the scene. Their bellies hurt as they grab onto the cart for support, sputtering out mocking words about the man who was brave enough to hit on a woman who might as well be the death of him. No one could keep up with her. Well, no one but Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them make their way to the parking lot after having paid. They keep each other company while loading the groceries into their respective cars, refusing to leave one another until the universe forces it upon them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I had a lot of fun,” Agatha is the first to speak. “My job makes things pretty hectic and far from normal, but today was…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio catches the words as they trail off into the distance. “Fun. It was really fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s been awhile since I enjoyed myself this much.” The freezing gust of air that comes does not faze her; Agatha remains zeroed on the woman before her. “You know, it’s the darndest thing. Talking to you feels so familiar. I could’ve sworn we’ve met before.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who knows? Maybe we have,” Rio jokes. “Anything is possible”
    </p>
<p>
     With the way such deep, dark brown eyes stare her way, Agatha falls, but she is promptly caught by a rather intimate embrace. Nothing stands between each other’s hearts. Well, perhaps one another.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tries, really, but the sight hypnotizes her, and soon enough she becomes Rio’s willing victim. Entrapped in an unknowing web of adoration ready to be served her way. No protests arrive. They never will.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     When night time comes, so do words strewn in purple across the journal. At first Rio refuses to look, even if she purposely left it open on her desk upon her arrival at the house. She was unable to face her soulmate while having her sights set on another.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      How is it going with your family?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<em>
       Nice to see you too.
      </em>
</b>
     There is a pause as Rio contemplates what to write next. But the more her mind wanders, the further she strays to another who is not her soulmate – a woman who she hopes to meet another day before returning to her reality in Pittsburgh.
     <b>
<em>
       It’s going fine. My mom won’t stop giving me shit about not having met you yet. She thinks I have some type of dowsing rod that’ll lead me to you but refuses to use it for the hell of it.
      </em>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Patience. We’ll see each other soon enough.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     But part of Rio hopes they don’t.
    </p>
<p>
<b>
<em>
       Maybe someday, huh? Isn’t that what you always say?
      </em>
</b>
</p>
<p>
     Across town, Agatha sighs as she stares down at her journal. She is unsure of what to reply, not wishing to elicit any pain over her soulmate at the mention of another woman in her life. They have an understanding, sure, but it has never been easy to think of her bound mate being with another.
    </p>
<p>
     Even she feels guilty for thinking of Rio, but by the gods does it feel freeing to have someone understand her in such a deep manner.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Yes. Someday.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Unknown to them, their dreams have already become a reality.

<div>
<p>
     On the morning of Christmas Eve, Agatha finds herself sitting on the floor, lights blinding her as they adorned her surroundings, with her hands wrapping boxes upon boxes. Oftentimes Wanda drafted her to support her in wrapping presents for the boys, given she and Natasha could barely decorate their homes without nearly electrocuting themselves. The thought of giving support to a long-time friend who she adored always made her heart swell, but with her mind elsewhere, Agatha found it difficult to focus on the task at hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “How are you doing?” Wanda asks, pulling her friend away from the manner another woman absorbed her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     “Peachy.” The lie is something Wanda quickly sees through. And in comes the sigh. “I don’t know. I met someone yesterday and honestly? I might as well go for it if she’s available.”
    </p>
<p>
     Since they had said their goodbyes on the previous days, an obsession began. Agatha could not quite put her finger on it. There was a closeness she felt to the woman unlike anyone she had ever met – one only her and her soulmate share. And yet from the little amount of information she garnered from Rio, someone who seemingly was not from the same proximity as her soulmate should be, it was next to impossible she would be the answer to the lifelong mystery.
    </p>
<p>
     “You shouldn’t settle for the first person you meet.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who am I supposed to settle for then? Not my soulmate,” Agatha scoffs angrily, but the pain in her voice is evident. “I just…fuck, I just want to be happy for once. I’m tired. I’ll be turning 40 in two years and have yet to meet my soulmate. I think it’s best to give it up for now. I like her, I like her a lot actually. But it’s too much. I can’t keep waiting for someone who may never show up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, honey.” Wanda tries to feel for her, Agatha realizes, but it is difficult to do so when not in the same predicament. “I guess what matters is that you’re happy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Honestly? For the first time in forever, I think I am.” Engrossing herself in the box she wraps, her mind wanders to the adversity life has forced her to endure. Her own mother thought of her as a monster for straying from the path of ‘goodness’ her mind had been wrapped around. There has never been anyone, let alone for the Maximoffs, who has taken the time to mend Agatha’s heart in a gentle manner. With Rio, she sees the possibility of that. Even if she is maimed in the process, she can’t help but take the chance so far into her life. “Do you ever think that the universe could be wrong? That maybe my soulmate isn’t some random lady I’ve been talking to for decades, but instead someone you just…meet in the right place, at the right time?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well I hope not. Natasha and I are stuck together otherwise,” Wanda jokes, but at the sight of her friend’s fallen face, her chest heaves. “But maybe. Who knows? The universe works in weird and mysterious ways. There was once a time we thought we were each other’s soulmates.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am so glad I didn’t get stuck with you. Now that would’ve been cruel for you.” The two of them break into a fit of laughter. They worked well as friends, but keeping up with Agatha, who held such fire in her personality and might through her every-day life, would have been impossible for someone as naturally tame as Wanda, who prefers the joys of suburbia compared to the chaos cities carry. “I don’t want to be too forward with her.”
    </p>
<p>
     The comment makes Wanda gasp. “Who are you and what have you done with my Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, shut it. Need I remind you that I am here voluntarily helping you?” Agatha feigns frustration as she throws a small roll of tape towards her friend. “I was thinking of asking her out after the holidays. A proper date this time. She’s a woman deserving of that. But then again, so am I.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Best of luck to anyone who ends up courting the mighty Agatha Harkness,” Wanda sings-songs, promptly dodging another roll of tape aimed at her head. “Listen, I of all people know that you can be a bit too much. So tone it down with this one, ‘kay? Don’t start going head-over-heels just because you’re desperate to find someone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t believe you called me desperate,” Agatha grumbles. “But fine, I’ll wait an appropriate amount of time and behave like a good little girl-scout. Does that make you feel better,
     <em>
      mom
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
<p>
     But the sole retort she received was of a previously-thrown roll of tape landing on her head.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “You know you don’t always have to look like you hate everyone, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     At the words, Rio digs deep within herself to find the strength to not roll her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “What if I’m not pretending?” She doesn’t even turn, partly due to not wishing to face the man, but additionally she found herself tasked with decorating the living room…once she did the same with the rest of the house, of course. “Maybe I do really hate everyone.”
    </p>
<p>
     His voice didn’t dissipate. “Even me?”
    </p>
<p>
     As she stands atop a ladder, placing decorations across the walls of the room, she glances down at her father. George offers a few thumb-tacks which she hesitantly takes – the cherry-on-top of her week would be to be hurt by one of them. The two of them stand in a blanket of silence, tunes in the background, which Rio finds comfort in; the typical mayhem is not occurring at the house, and she finds it odd yet relieving.
    </p>
<p>
     Albeit in his mid-60’s, her father stands tall with his youth still instilled in his being. His hair is gray and scruffy across his head and face, with a beard he proudly wears. He dons a red and green ugly sweater Beatriz once knit for him with sweatpants and a signature mug on his hand that eventually is placed on the nearby coffee table. With the rectangular glasses perched on his nose, Rio sees her own disheveled reflection, once which brings out a newfound frustration within herself – her mother had drilled the importance of appearances in her mind since she was a young girl, it was difficult not to follow suit.
    </p>
<p>
     “Guess not,” Rio whispers, her words swallowed by the Christmas music growing louder – at times in Spanish, at times in English – sitting in the background. “Did ma send you to talk to me? I know she’s been trying to get me alone since yesterday to ask why I came back so late.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You came back at 6 o’clock, that’s hardly late.” He holds the ladder in place, preventing his daughter from falling. “I guess in your mom’s world that’s different, but it’s none of my business. Although, she did tell me you met a girl…”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Woman
     </em>
     , dad. I’m in my thirties,” Rio corrects. “It was just lunch. She hasn’t met her soulmate and neither have I. So why not have some fun while I suffer in this godforsaken shitty town?” She knows how peaceful Sewickley is for the man, for the whole family really, so she sends down a sympathetic smile. “Sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them study the manner in which Rio intricately places a garland at the line where the ceiling and wall meet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, have you thought about the idea that she might be your soulmate?” Her father offers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Unless the universe was having an off-day when it paired us together, that’s not possible.” There had been thoughts which kept her up on the previous night. The only reason she received a semblance of rest was due to the place Agatha swore she was from. At least, in her mind, that is how she took it. Yet it was enough to grant her enough peace to succumb to her rest. “She said she lives in the big city. And not Philly, which weirdly enough is a blessing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just because she lives there doesn’t mean she is from there,” George brings up the doubt.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a small town, dad. I feel like I would know if she lived here while I was growing up.” She finishes the first side of the room, and steadily walks down the ladder to move it alongside the burning fireplace. Rio muses being burnt by it would make for a better experience than continuing the conversation with her dad. “I would’ve seen her in high school or something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You never know.” George hands his daughter another garland, this time grounding the ladder better given the awkward angle the woman has to follow; if she were to knock down the collectible-snow globes or stockings, Beotriz would annihilate them both. “Stranger things have happened.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You mean like you and mom?” Rio raises her eyebrows teasingly. Her father had been taken to the Caribbean island in his infancy, and she muses that is how he was bound to her mother upon her being born in the same town his parents took him to. Even then, at times she wonders what difficulties they experienced with being fluent in their own native languages, but not one another’s. “She seems familiar.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Isn’t that a good sign?”
    </p>
<p>
     All he longs for is her happiness, Rio knows, but his worries come as a cruel reminder of how lonely she is on Earth.
    </p>
<p>
     “I go to a lot of conferences in New York, dad,” she tells herself mostly. “That’s not really narrowing it down.”
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them are quiet for a handful of minutes. Although the action of coming back to her childhood home caused incredible discomfort to Rio, always preferring to keep a decent distance from the family which always made her business their own, there was a smidge of tranquility she suddenly felt. Regardless of what she had told her soulmate, the holiday season brought out a hidden longing within her. It was a craving for her to be happy, to carry on dumb traditions with her beloved such as matching pajamas for Christmas and snowball fights on the outside. Her favorite being the thought of building a white snowman with a carrot nose and charcoal eyes, and perhaps a soulmate for the snowman as well; they do not deserve the same fate she has.
    </p>
<p>
     But given her continuous loneliness, Rio opts to build walls, to make herself into a crude, sarcastic savage while coping with the fact she may never truly find her other half.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure about this gi-
     <em>
      woman
     </em>
     ?” George spurts out. As Rio installs the final garland, he takes it upon himself to finish the coffee, already room-temperature, he previously set to the side. “She’s just some stranger who ran into you. Could be a serial killer.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s nothing serious, dad. Don’t worry. Keep it up, and you’ll start turning into ma,” Rio replies. “I’ll wear protection if that’s what you're worried about.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe not considering how badly your mother wants grandkids…” The joke earned him a playful slap on the arm as Rio descended from the ladder. “I had to spike my coffee a bit. I don’t think I can get through the day fully sober. You know I love your mom’s family-”
    </p>
<p>
     “That makes one of us,” Rio interjects with a shit-eating grin stemming from her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “-but they can be a little too much at times. Especially those cousins of yours,” George shakes his head. “I am so thankful we only had you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Was it gin that you used? For the drink, I mean,” Rio questioned as she motioned her face towards the now-empty coffee mug. When her father nodded, her eyes lit up. “Do you have more? I’d take a sip of the bottles I got for ma yesterday, but…”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’d kill you,” George finishes the sentence. “She’s not messing around today.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll kill myself if I don’t get some alcohol in my system. What has she got you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     For now, he is in the safe-zone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want to go grab a drink before you get drafted?” Rio nudges at his shoulder with pleading eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “If I drink a drop more, I’m the one that’s dying. I went a bit overboard with it.” As an idea pops into his head, George faces his daughter. “Hey, this is a great opportunity for you to invite that lady-friend of yours out. Who knows, maybe she’s lonely on Christmas Eve as well.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not lonely.” Oh, but she truly is. The dictionary definition of it, even. “I doubt she'll be free.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You never know…” is what the man leaves her with, repeating his previous words as he exits the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     Taking over the room by her sole presence makes Rio sag her head. She eyes her phone by the coffee table, practically urging her to pick it up. Her fingers are jittery as she follows suit, pressing the screen until a rather curious name pops up. There is hesitation, but at the thought of what could be, Rio presses the call button.
    </p>
<p>
     Torturous seconds pass before she receives the answer to her prayers; a smile embellishes her shining features before she speaks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, I know it’s early, but do you want to go get a drink?”
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     A gust of excitement swept Rio off her feet. Her body was light enough to float by the time she picked up Agatha at the hotel on the other side of town, promptly driving them into a bar she knew full-well in the heart of Pittsburgh. The drive was half-an-hour, and her mother would be howling through the phone for her to return home promptly, and yet Rio, who had never felt more alive, would ignore it without fear.
    </p>
<p>
     The two women sat at the corner of the bar, the neon lights lighting up their beaming features as they stared into one another, sitting side-by-side. Although it was the early hours of the afternoon, the place was quite packed. Numerous lonely hearts found solace in such a crude place. Albeit loud, Rio’s cold heart swelled at the sight of numerous people finding a place with one another.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you frequent this place?” Agatha asks, her hands holding a glass of whiskey on the rocks she hasn’t quite the eye for – not when another beauty is before her. “The bartender seems to know you. Actually, I’m pretty sure she hasn’t stopped staring at you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She knows I haven’t met my soulmate, so she keeps trying,” Rio shrugs. “And failing.”
    </p>
<p>
     She doesn’t notice, but the previously lit flame on Agatha’s eyes dissipates – the words soothing it away.
    </p>
<p>
     “How come you needed a drink this early? You don’t care much for Christmas?” The head shaking makes Agatha curious, but she holds back. “Heh, I know someone like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not that I don’t like it, you know?” Rio begins. Her body is fully turned towards the other woman, and there she catches a quick glance, which feels longing, on the entirety of her frame. The black pants covering Agatha’s legs are tight enough around the waist to leave nothing much for one’s imagination. But Rios’s focus moves to the velvet shirt, with buttons undone allowing quick sight of part of her creamy chest. She coughs, gin burning down her throat, to disallow herself from moaning. “I just wish I had someone to spend it with. I see these cute couples celebrating all the time. Decorating their homes together, playing in the snow outside. I know I’m a grown-up, and my mother would say it’s childish, but I’ve never had that.” A dry chuckle escapes her tightened throat. “I don’t mean to ruin the mood.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not.” A sympathetic hand lands on Rio’s thigh, drawing imaginary circles over it. The touch is enough to send the both of them over the moon. And if their cheeks were already tinted red due to the alcohol flowing through their veins, they glowed mightier now. “I know how you feel. I’ve always been alone, even during my adolescence, so I don’t much expect that to change. But maybe,” Agatha’s words trail off as she stares into wide brown eyes. “Maybe someday. Who knows? The world is full of mysteries and surprises.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Just like you.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     As jazz music plays in the background, Rio finds herself living that of the shitty Lifetime and Hallmark movies her mother obsesses over. Her lips are left agape, but her eyes are on Agatha’s, who opens them oh-so slightly to take a peek at her shining canines. A smile takes over the woman. How beautiful, how addictive. There is not much Rio can do to set herself free from the web her heart is around. And frankly, she doesn’t want that.
    </p>
<p>
     All she wants is to bask in Agatha’s presence, to be the sole focus of the woman. Never had such a cruel spell been cast over her. Soulmates be damned, she would pursue the stranger until the end of time. Maybe then could her heart, as battered and lonesome as it were, could rest.
    </p>
<p>
     “Has anyone ever told you how beautiful you are?” Confidence soars through her mixed with the gin which grants her newfound powers. The sweet laugh that befalls her ears only entices her further. “I’m serious. You’re just…fuck. Look at you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh stop it,” Agatha says. Her touch suddenly becomes a grip, with Rio’s thigh being the victim. “I could say the same about you. I’m not surprised you have people wanting to jump your bones left and right. Sheesh, both men and women. You’re quite the catch, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s only the women I’m interested in,” Rio playfully replies. “Actually, one woman in particular.”
    </p>
<p>
     The comment leaves Agatha breathless.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t say.”
    </p>
<p>
     The soothing voice of Tony Bennett drowns out their thoughts as they finish their designated drinks. Although Agatha stops at one, her counterpart, with a much higher tolerance, waves the bartender for another. The warmth of the bar – a dissimilar nature to the outside world strung out by snowfall – washes flames across both women. They feel an almost animalistic pull towards one another, yet wait for the other to make the first move.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know, if you ever come by the city I’d be happy to show you around.” Her voice is low and husky; the gin does not compare to the manner such a blissful sound burns through Rio’s chest. “It could serve as our second date.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is this not our second date?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I suppose,” Agatha shrugs, her eyes softening as she takes in Rio’s partially inebriated persona. “I know we only just met, but we can do this more often. It doesn’t seem like we’ll find our soulmates anytime soon, so why not have some fun?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d love to visit you over there,” Rio mumbles before licking her lips. “Do you have any plans tonight?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not really. My best friend invited me over to have dinner with her family, but I wouldn’t want to intrude. I’ll probably lay around in my hotel and-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come with me,” Rio cuts her off, her joy getting the best of her. “My family always has these huge celebrations for Christmas Eve. I’m sure they would love to have you. Especially if you’re with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     The thought of a family, a mother at that, still loving a child regardless of her bringing a woman home with her tore at Agatha’s heartstrings. Oh how deeply she wished to someday attain it with her own mother. Being welcomed into another family, beyond that of the Maximoffs, sprinkles fondness in her heart.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure about it?” Agatha worries.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll just tell them you’re an orphan or something. My mom is going to eat that crap up.” A hand lands atop Agatha’s with might. “It’ll be fun. Isn’t that what we both want?” In reply, there came a nod. “Good. I’ll pick you up around 7:30, and wear something nice. My mom is a sucker for that too.”
    </p>
<p>
     A silent Agatha could only stare, her bottom lip taken hostage by her shining teeth. She holds Rio’s hand, truly this time, with a fondness neither has felt yet. Their fingers interlace together. Suddenly, they are transported beyond that of the bar. All the eyes on them dissipate, as do the hushed whispers. All that is left is an inhumane craving they have for one another. The flame is lit up and neither can put it out.
    </p>
<p>
     “When do you leave town?” Agatha breathlessly wonders, her throat becoming dry.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hopefully before New Year’s, but we celebrate Three Kings so I might be forced to stay for a bit longer.” Rio pauses, returning the squeeze to Agatha’s hand. “How come? Are you trying to steal me away?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe.” She leans in dangerously close, Wanda's advice be damned. All that is left is the sound of their heaving breaths, hot and bothered. Neither cares much. If anything, they love it. “Would that be so bad?”
    </p>
<p>
     The embrace is one Rio reciprocates without hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it wouldn’t.”

<p>
<span>
      In keeping her promise, right at 8 o’clock, Rio finds herself parked outside the hotel in the outskirts of town. Even within the confines of her car, her breath is visible. She hugs herself, and although the weather is nearing negative numbers outside, a warmth befalls her. Eyes turn to the front doors of the building, and she cannot keep the beam from forming on her face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Without a coat to shield her from the cold, she braves it by stepping out of the vehicle. Her cheeks turn red, a color hidden in the darkness the afternoon already brings during wintertime. The tint matches that of Agatha’s attire, who dons a navy blue coat covering a black, slightly buttoned shirt, and gray slacks. Stilettos adorn her feet, and for a moment all Rio can focus on is whether the other woman feels the same chilly semblance as she does – it is better than to stare up into her eyes and be lost in them, but Rio falls for that anyway.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It is then that Rio feels underdressed in her dark red formal belted jumpsuit. The sleeves and trousers are wide, allowing her to easily hide her arms beneath to cover herself from the freezing night. Even then, the deep v-neck, showing off her cleavage, only made matters worse.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You clean up nicely,” is the first thing Rio comments. “Not that I’m surprised. You could wear a trash bag and you’d look gorgeous.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Careful, Vidal.” Her voice is sultry, the first sound to ever make Rio’s knees buck. “Otherwise I might start thinking you want to get me in bed.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You and I both know what my intentions are,” Rio calmly states. She reaches out a hand that is instantly grabbed, and guides Agatha to her chariot. “It’s impossible not to want to get in bed with you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Touché.” As the passenger door of the black Challenger is opened, Agatha dives in. “My, what a gentlewoman. Keep acting like this and I might take you back to New York with me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio raises her eyebrows. “I hope that’s a promise.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The drive back to the house is filled with conversations primarily stemming from Agatha’s side. She goes into more depth about her best friend and how difficult it had been to decline the invitation to her little get-together. A ramble goes on about the woman’s teenaged twin children, and although Rio finds herself lost in the words through the monologue, the name ‘Wanda’ is what stands up to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What did you say?” Her voice finds an uncharacteristic fearful tone to pose the question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was just talking about my friend,” Agatha frowns. “Wanda, my childhood friend.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wanda.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Oh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Oh fuck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Wanda?
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The grip on the steering wheel grows. Without noticing, her foot hits the gas pedal further, almost to its end. Thankfully in the dark, empty road, there is no one to suffer from her state of frenzy but the two women.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, are you okay?” Agatha reaches out, her hand landing atop a shivering thigh – even with the heat blasting in the car, Rio is buffeted by chilly winds. “You look a little pale and…I don’t think we need to be driving so fast. I’m sure your mom will understand if we’re a few minutes late without ending up in the hospital.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah,” Rio mumbles. The touch and soothing voice are enough to calm her down. She refuses to take into consideration the name, instead idiotically brushing it off as a coincidence. After such a long time of being constantly alone, she cannot muster an ounce of bravery to face what this means. “I’m just thinking.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Penny for your thoughts, honey?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The hand never leaves.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m worried about what my family will do,” Rio lies with a feigned smile. “They’re nice people, I swear, but a bit too involved in each other’s lives. Just, uh, be careful with what you say to my grandmother. She’ll end up playing a game of telephone with everyone at the party.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love a hot gossip session.” Agatha gives her tight a small pinch. “I’m sure it’ll be fine. Don’t worry about me, sweets. I’m a big girl, I can handle myself.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The pet name doesn’t go lost within Rio, but she opts to pretend it was never said. Somehow, it is much easier to deal with it that way. To pretend the woman sitting beside her is just a random stranger fate allowed her to encounter, not the one bound to her soul.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And yet, she doesn’t stop obsessing over the idea all night long.
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      By the time they arrive at the house, shivers run down Rio’s spine. She is courteous enough to open the door for her companion, but apart from that, her lips are sealed shut. She barely reacts when a hand takes her own, and at the lack of response on her part, Agatha ends up pulling away in shame. Even that flies past Rio’s head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, ma,” is the first thing Rio can muster out as she swings open the door to face her mother, already an overwhelmed mess with so many people around. The two of them had a conversation previously where, after rather colorful words were spewed at the last-minute warning of another guest being invited, which Beatriz swore would throw her off, an agreement had been made about Agatha’s presence. “This is my s-…Agatha. This is Agatha,” she corrects, ignoring her slip-up. “The woman I told you I met a few days ago.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh,” Beatriz looks the brunette woman up and down, then nods at her daughter. “Is this your girlfriend now? Am I finally getting grandkids?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Pero mami si la acabo de conocer. Porque carajo-” but her mother’s pursed lips stop her from swearing, and instead retorting in a calmer manner. “We’re getting to know each other for now. She’s, uh, a doctor.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ooh, a learned woman.” Beatriz shakes Agatha’s hand. “You might be what my Rio needs to get her head out of her ass. Welcome.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I have to say, you have a lovely home. Mrs. Vidal,” Agatha says. She feels more than belonging of her place here, a sense she never had in the midst of her own family. “Thank you for having me. Rio speaks so highly of you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No she doesn’t,” Beatriz chuckles, waving off the comment with her hand. “But I appreciate it. Please, make yourself at home. And if you need absolutely anything, let me know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As she leaves, the two women are left alone once again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You know, I think the curtains in the living room might make a good noose if you want to check out of here early,” Rio jokes dryly, her face red with embarrassment at her mother’s antics. “If not, I’ll jump on that action.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh stop it. She is a very lovely woman who kindly welcomed me into her home for Christmas Eve.” Once she takes off her coat, promptly helping Rio’s with her own, she hangs them up by the rack. Soon enough, an arm is hesitantly wrapped around the other brunette’s. “Is this okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” Rio swallows the cumbersome knot in her throat. “It’s more than okay.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The two of them walk across the foyer as one. While Agatha busies herself with greeting just about every passerby who she swoons over, her companion holds a tight grip on her jaw. But by the gods, she simply cannot remain in her head when such beauty is bestowed upon her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio may be an idiot, but not when it comes to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       her
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha is introduced to just about everyone gracing the home. The older women in particular cannot stop fawning at her smoky makeup and pulled back hair, even requesting tips on how to attain such a youthful look as hers. The endeavors force a crackle from Rio, who hides the smile between a sip of her spiked coquito. The hint of alcohol brings bravery to the previous cowardice peeking through.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “¿Y esta es tu novia?” Dolores wonders, but Rio does not have the heart to tell her grandmother the truth.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We’re just getting to know each other,” Agatha interjects with a wide grin before pulling a rather frozen Rio close to her body, warming her up in the process. “But maybe someday…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The comment materializes goosebumps on her skin even if she tries not to pay them any mind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Pero si entiende español y todo.” Dolores finds herself impressed by Agatha’s understanding of her language – Rio is as well, but soon becomes well-aware of its reasoning. “Nena, ya cásate con ella.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Solo nos estamos conociendo, abu. No nos vamos a casar,” Rio chortles before turning to Agatha, a feigned confidence shooting through her. “Unless…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You haven’t even gotten me in bed and now you want to get married?” Agatha slurs, her lips grazing her counterpart’s ear. Her hand moves to the woman’s lower back, carefully fiddling with the fabric between her fingers. “My, you’re full of surprises, sweets.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the women all chat amongst themselves, Rio is left breathless. In her mind there is turmoil, but one look at Agatha makes it all subside. She feels out of place. Her walls are torn down by a complete stranger she has invited into her home only days after meeting. And yet it feels right.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       It is
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      right.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      For the first time in her life, blood flows through her veins. She has never been as alive as in that moment. Standing there, half-full glass of coquito, surrounded by family members which no longer drive her up the wall. Not with the one who makes all those frustrations subside. The one which coincidentally pulls Rio closer by the waist, with dark purple fingernails trickling about in their teasing nature.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I want another drink,” Rio tells her. She licks her bloodthirsty lips, her eyes deeply zeroing in on blue puddles which she reels inwards. “I want you to get me one.“
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The two of them walk across the first floor of the house glued together. Even as one of her cousins passes, Rio refrains from bickering. Not when she is so visibly enchanted by the witch who cast a spell on her, her head floating in the clouds due to her mere presence.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Fingers find each other interlaced and neither woman is sure of who began the embrace. They don’t care, nor do they speak one word as Agatha fetches a drink for the lioness she holds. They don’t need to. The unspoken lustful air between them is loud enough to hear. Their heartbeats are synchronized as they loudly call out for one another.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      In that moment, Rio is glad for once her family is around – she is unsure of how she could control herself otherwise.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Your family is lovely,” Agatha is able to say once they find themselves huddled in a corner by the Christmas tree. Her hand never stops holding Rio’s, who albeit finds the world to be turning around her, quizzes back with adoration. “Thank you for inviting me, really. I’ve only ever been to these things with my friend and her family. I just…I missed out on a lot growing up.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       I know
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , is what Rio wants to reply with.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m sorry,” it came out of her shaky lips. “I’m glad you came. I know it was a premature invite, but thank you for agreeing to it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      In a room full of warm lights and holiday decorations, the only beauty she sees sits beside her. She breathes in the dozy scent of lavender as the woman rests her head on Rio’s shoulder. Not even the strongest liquor could get her so drunk. If she could, Rio swears she’d bathe in the smell for the rest of time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re gorgeous,” Rio feels herself repeating for the millionth time since they met. “I don't…I’ve never seen anything,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       anyone
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , like you. It’s like you’re a different specimen or something.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Maybe I’m a witch,” Agatha jokes. “You give me too much credit, honey. Especially when you look like you just came out of a Victoria’s Secret catalog.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Really? Victoria's Secret?” Rio cannot help her amusement. “Wow, I must be stunning.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You are, but you don’t give yourself nearly enough credit.” Agatha’s eyes purposely, and shamelessly at that, shift down to the other brunette’s cleavage. “There has never been anyone I’ve seen that is more attractive than you. It’s not even a close race.” Teasing lips move towards an exposed bit of skin, and when no one looks, a kiss is planted. “But your heart is what really gets to me. It’s beautiful. A bit broken, I know, but nothing that can’t be undone. Your soulmate is one lucky gal. I suppose I can be greedy until you two meet.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The serene sound of Denzel Sachs’ tunes flows through the air. Each note encapsulates the peace Rio feels by the other woman’s side. She nudges at her, eyebrows raised as a hand reaches out waiting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “May I have this dance, m’lady?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha eyes her incredulously, but nods. “Of course. Look at you being such a dashing sweetheart.” They rise together; it is Rio who takes the lead for once. “What am I going to do with you, Vidal?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With both arms wrapped around the woman’s waist, Rio shrugs. From the corner of her eye, she spots a small bit of mistletoe floating in the ceiling – surely a product of her father. Shaking her head, she cannot help but scoff at the idea that pops into her mind. Albeit cheesy, it is difficult to help herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You could kiss me.” Rio moves her head to point at the mistletoe. She cannot help the smirk that slews over her features as Agatha’s mouth is left agape, yet full of joy. “If you’d like. I mean,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       it is
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      tradition. Otherwise you get, like, 100 years of bad luck or something.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, I wouldn’t want that.” Agatha nervously glances around. “Are you sure it’s okay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Knowing fully-well where the apprehension stems from, Rio turns sympathetic. She softly nods, pulling Agatha close enough that their bodies stand as one. Having such beauty in the palm of her hands elicits fear in her; the last thing she wants is to let go of the porcelain doll she entrusts herself in protecting.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Look who’s worrying now,” Rio pokes fun at her. “Just focus on me, Aggie.” The sudden nickname brings a wave of relief over the brunette. “It’s just you and me now. Don’t worry about anything or anyone else.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When their lips meet, the whole world stops. In the depths of her stomach, the previous tight knot Rio felt is loosened by the other woman. Skins melt together as they oh-so slowly sway to the cascading notes stemming from the record player near the fireplace.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Although short-lived, the kiss would forever remain ingrained in their minds. When the world resumes, no one finds themselves interested in the two women. If anything, they are all alone standing in the middle of the living room, dancing as a singular specimen, with drunken gazes which shoot through the other.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That was…wow,” Agatha cannot find the proper verbiage as her eyelids turn heavy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The great Dr. Harkness is left breathless, huh? I must be pretty good.” Her canines are flashed before receiving an incredulous look. “Careful you don’t rub my ego too much, sweetheart.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “As if.” Arms enclosed around Rio’s neck move down to her lower back. “The things I’d do to you if you were mine.” Agatha rests her head on the woman’s shoulder, her lips inching close to her ear. “I would devour you whole, Vidal. Wouldn’t that be nice?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Who says you can’t?” Rio challenges.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Rio…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m serious,” her tone grows sultry. “I know what I signed up for, and I choose you. I don’t give a shit if the universe says otherwise.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good. I don’t care either.” Agatha places a tender lip on her flushed cheek. “Can you make up an excuse to leave without being bombarded with questions by your mom? We can go back to my hotel.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll do you one better.” This time, it is Rio who peppers kisses across the doctor’s neck. “My room is in the basement. No one can bother us there. So if you’re willing…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Blue orbs widen at the implication. There is an ounce of silence between them, but excitement is what prevails soon enough. The jitters they experience are shared. Since the day they first met, it had been a prominent thought in their minds. Now, tonight, it will turn into reality.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No one will look for us?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I promise,” Rio reassures her. “If they do, I’ll use the knife under my pillow to scare them away.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The dry jests are ones Agatha finds herself enjoying the further they are told.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A hand holds Agatha’s strongly, and pulls her out of the living room in the blink of an eye. She is dragged across the house, the two of them opting to ignore the loud family members who call out for them. Descending the stairs, they remain quiet. But as soon as they are safely away from every living creature, it is Agatha who takes charge – she loves it dearly, especially when her victim ends up being Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fuck,” Rio grumbles as she is shoved against a nearby wall with a loud thud. She doesn’t even try to push the huntress away nor does she want to. Instead, she basks in the manner Agatha’s hands explore her body, pulling one of the legs up to her waist as lips explore the expanse of Rio’s throat. “My room is just there- shit!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I can’t help myself,” Agatha admits. It is then that Rio really takes in her appearance. Ocean eyes turn black with hunger, accentuated by bruised lips and messy hair. The sight is one she drills into her mind, never letting go. “You’re just…fuck, Rio. What are you doing to me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’m taking what I want,” Rio bites her bottom lip as teeth ghost her neck threatening to sink in. “Is that a crime?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha doesn’t respond. Not verbally anyway. She chooses to solely kiss Rio, to shut her up to finally focus on the way her stomach churns out of hunger. The desire to make the other woman hers burnt brightly in her chest. Oh, she cannot let it go.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They stumble into the room together, hands clawing at one another’s clothes. A momentary lapse of judgment had them falling over the bed, but it is Agatha who gains enough consciousness to shut and lock the door behind them. The floorboards creak as Rio’s lap is straddled– it takes the utmost mental strength to suppress a moan which inevitably comes out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I want to take it slow,” Agatha groans. Although she finds it torturous to take her time digesting the woman before her, she knows it is only right to show her the stars – to enjoy the one and only night they have together before remembering they belong to others. “You deserve that, hon.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You have a funny way of showing it.” Rio brushes back a wild strand of hair that covers her counterpart’s face – she wants nothing standing in the way of such a glorious view. “Can’t we just-”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No.” She is serious, hands enclosing themselves around wrists to have Rio on her lustful tracks. “It’s not how I planned on doing it, but we don’t have much time with each other, huh? Give me this present, Vidal.” She takes one of Rio’s hands and allows her lips to fall on its palm, leaving a hint of lipstick in their wake. “Stop being stubborn. Don’t you want to be good for me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Something breaks in her. She is unsure what, or even where it came from, yet her demeanor changes as soon as the words leave Agatha’s mouth. Rio cannot nod. She solely stares up blankly, her pupils dilating in microseconds, as she takes in the nature of her predicament.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And if her suspicions are right, she prays to whatever gods exist to let her live the rest of time with The Eighth Wonder of the World by her side.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio’s throat is dry when she finds the right moment to speak. “Yes.” She pauses, it is Agatha’s raised eyebrows which make her freeze. All she wants is to present perfection to
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       her
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . “Do it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They take long seconds in disrobing one another. Between them, there are awkward tugs which are squandered by fits of giggles they are enticed by. Never had either felt so free during a moment like that. It was not about seeking pleasure, but instead about enjoying their respective presences in the most natural of ways. Naked. Laughing. Smiling.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They struggle to breathe anything but the other’s scent. While Rio basks in lavender, Agatha bathes in the warm vanilla smell her nostrils will always remember. She takes mental images in the hope to reminisce over such serenity for the rest of time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       Rio is not mine
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      , she reminds herself, but for that night, the universe has no say in who she becomes one with.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The sight of a nude Rio before her drives a pang of need through the other woman. She swallows the knot in her throat, mesmerized by an alluring wonder she had the honor to have. Regardless of how rapidly her chest heaved, Agatha, who sported a similarly naked fashion, leaned down to plant a gentle embrace on Rio’s chest at the valley between her breasts.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Cógelo suave,” Rio mustered out with a mouth leaving small bruises across her throat and chest. “It’s been awhile since…you know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Shh, I know. I’ll take it easy.” Agatha leaves little pecks on the expanse of the undiscovered skin while her curious hands move up to cup a hefty pair of breasts. At the tenderness, she cannot help but moan. “Let’s enjoy this together, ‘kay?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Neither knew where one’s body begins and the other’s ends. With a free hand, Agatha interlaces their fingers as her dominant ones move between the other’s legs. Fingertips tease at the gushing entrance. They rub up and down the slit, eliciting heavy breaths from the brunette who throws her head back. Her bulbous bundle of nerves is stimulated, and for a moment they wonder how the loud yelp is not enough to alert the rest of the individuals within the home.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The positioning starts off fiddly, but they grow used to it upon Agatha slipping inside. It is a sole finger that dive deep between velvety walls, but that is more than enough. There is a tightness she doesn’t fight, but instead opts to relieve oh-so carefully. There is no pain stricken over Rio’s features, only lust that she holds with each grimace.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I got you, baby.” Agatha kisses her. Hard. She swallows every upcoming groan and disallows her companion from enduring it in her lonesome. “Focus on me, buttercup. And if you need me to stop or go slower, just say the word. Can you do that for me?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Never having taken it upon herself to be at the receiving end of such adoration, Rio is at a loss of words, but nods regardless.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Use your words,” she is instructed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I can do that,” Rio replies.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha holds her close. She is afraid that if she were to let go, their night would come to an end. That she would be hit with the realization it was all a mirage. She is selfish, she knows, but the craving she has for Rio is one she was not sated for all her life. Whoever her soulmate is holds nothing compared to the professor.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They are flipped over to the side, courtesy of Rio who just has to hold Agatha’s face in her hands. It grounds her, and the hot breaths buffeting her blushing cheeks bring her confidence. A hand moves to pull back at her hair, and rather than protesting as she normally would in her unabashed stubbornness, the brown-eyed woman lets it happen. Teeth sink into her shoulder, and mixed with the pleasure she receives simultaneously between her legs, Rio is unsure she can last any longer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It is premature, she realizes, but has difficulty in holding it back. Upon reaching her climax, Rio bites down on the crook of Agatha’s shoulder enough to suppress her wails. The digit in her curls upwards, and although her legs kick out in defiance, Agatha remains still, holding her close to her heart.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You did so well.” The praise makes Rio’s head swoon further; she requires more of it to exist. “You’re amazing. Such a beautiful thing.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Stop,” Rio chortles hazily. There is no thought, no ideas, in her mind but the radiant image of Agatha. “Or else I’ll end up taking you home with me. Make you all mine and never let you leave my side.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “My, my. That sounds like a dream come true.” Agatha teases her free hand over her lover’s back, who, even if tired, attempts to push her back onto the messy bed. “You don’t have to return the favor, honey. I’m perfectly fine as is.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But can I?” Her eyes are wide and pleading, and there is not a lot Agatha can do to deny the titillating request. Her orbs are as dark as the black bedsheets she kneels over, turning the other woman on her back before moving between her legs. “Pretty please with a cherry on top?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That almost turned me off,” Agatha laughs, covering her face as she is playfully slapped. “You’re going to be the death of me, Vidal.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good.” As she gains further clarity, the brunette pulls apart Agatha’s legs. “May I?’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Of course.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As Rio descends, a hand lays flat on the top of her head. It guides her, moving her further south to land over the dripping destination. And as she takes one good, long lick, the other woman sees the stars. Just how she hoped.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They explore one another for what feels like hours dead into the night. Christmas Eve passes with her family celebrating amongst themselves while Agatha celebrates with her own. Unknowingly, their souls are bound past that point. With each kiss, each nibble on the other’s body, and the laughs they share, their lives become fully intertwined. The addiction that forms for the other is impossible to fight against. The sole sure is sticking together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      By the time they laid back with interlaced limbs, the day had passed. The darkness of Christmas was joined by white falling from the sky. And with each breath they take, snow further piles up outside the house.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha ends with her head laying over Rio’s chest who, albeit apprehensive at first, naturally plays with her hair.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you for inviting me.” Agatha’s voice is barely hearable with her tiresome appearance she sports. Her body is covered by the blanket, the night, and Rio. “This was fun.” She looks up at the woman. “A lot of fun. Merry Christmas, Rio.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A chaste kiss lands on the back of her hand as Rio brings it up to her lips.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The pleasure is all mine, sweetheart. Merry Christmas.”
     </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<span>
      As dawn sets in, a pair of blue eyes fluttered open. They are sluggish at first, growing used to the smidgen of light, if one could even call it that, dropping through the small windows overlooking the backyard of the house. There is a deep temptation to remain asleep, but something pulls her into a waking state begrudgingly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The makeshift room is dark as Agatha lays to rest against the headboard. Upon sitting up straight, her orbs adapt to the lack of light let alone for a small night-light on by the desk in the shape of a destinations. She takes in the room. It is juvenile for the most part, but she muses Rio has not made changes to it since her youth. Even then, there are small parts which scream overt maturity. It doesn’t take a genius to tell how quickly Rio was forced to grow up — to hold maturity close and appease her family.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      That is something Agatha, who still isn’t sure she has a home with a roof over her head, understands very well.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sweet girl.” Agatha lets a hand fall atop Rio’s nude shoulder as she comes to stare at the multitude of drawings pasted over her walls. She is an artist, a fact seemingly no one commented on, not even herself. Yet the brunette admires every visible masterpiece. “You’re just full of surprises, huh?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      A half-open sketchpad on the desk captures her attention. She shouldn’t, of course she knows, yet curiosity gets the best of her. In a matter of seconds, Agatha finds herself admiring a sketch, and the more she stares, the further familiarity sets up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It is her. More specifically, a sketch of her wearing the attire she had on upon first meeting Rio. Each detail, even if rushed, was visible on the drawing. Fingertips admired each intricately messy line which formed her features.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Albeit focused on the drawing, there is an object out of the corner of her eye that draws Agatha away. She frowns, shaking her head in the beginning, but upon further look, the realization dawns upon her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Hands reach out to grab a journal hidden atop piles of papers. It strikes her as odd how similar it is to her own, which she shamelessly shoved into her suitcase with her affection being put forth to Rio rather than her mysterious soulmate. But as she examines the book, it is clear she does not have much to worry about.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her suspicions are further enticed as she flips open a page. There she sees the unmistakable ink of her purple pen which was used to write a slew of words she recognizes. And there, right underneath, she finds what she can only deduce as her soulmate’s words.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh Rio.” Agatha cannot help the manner in which her heart swells. The happiness that comes to her is monumental. All she can do with it, while remaining quiet, is turn to a sleeping Rio and beam at her. “Oh my sweet one.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Perhaps, Agatha muses, Christmas wishes do come true.

<p>
     Sunlight beams from the small cracked windows of the basement room when the morning comes. It dances over uncovered areas of skin not well-guarded by the black sheets which bring great warmth to combat against the chilliness stemming from the outside. A pair of bodies lay asleep in the bed, one holding the other from behind with a loving grip.
    </p>
<p>
     As the minutes pass, it is a pair of brown eyes which flutters open first. They take long seconds to grow used to the sudden intrusion of light, but as they pass, they focus on the wall covered in sketches from her youth. At the feeling of arms wrapped over her waist, the ends of her mouth rise oh-so slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio finds enough strength to turn on her side. The sight is titillating, far too beautiful for her to even touch. Regardless, she reaches out, gently caressing the face of the masterpiece she finds lightly snoring beside her. The sole act of grazing her wild strands of hair electrifies her fingertips. Aphrodite herself is no match for the beauty Agatha holds.
    </p>
<p>
     Her features are calm as Rio explores them with a single digit. It runs down her nose, the woman smiling as it scrunches in Agatha’s sleep. It draws the thin line that is her lips, memorizing the manner in which they react by simple contact. It traces her jawline, and even in her sleep, Rio knows she could visualize such perfection with little to no mistakes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it morning yet?” Agatha groans, but her voice is adorably small as she wakes up. Yet, her eyes remain unopened for the time being. The serene sight drives a pang of adoration through Rio’s chest – she needs more of it.
    </p>
<p>
     “It is,” Rio mumbles back, running her fingers through mounds of dark hair. “Good morning,
     <em>
      bella
     </em>
     . Merry Christmas.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Merry Christmas,” the woman slurs back. She cracks open her orbs, instantly zeroing them on Rio. “How’d you sleep?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Better than ever.” Their breaths turn hot as does their need for the other. “You?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Amazing,” Agatha says. She believes that the journal she found during the earlier hours of the day was a figment of her imagination, but as she stares deeply into her counterpart’s soul, she senses the familiarity she hadn’t been able to put a finger on for days. “You are a fantastic cuddler.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wasn’t doing much cuddling compared to you. I’ve actually never been the little spoon.” Rio shrugs. “It was nice. Different, but nice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulls her close, so far that their bodies nearly melt against the other’s. “I
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     want to kiss you right now. May I?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Honey, I don’t think you want to kiss me with morning breath-”
    </p>
<p>
     But she is stopped right in the midst of her words as Agatha plants a pair of lips atop her own.
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them hold their position, solely focusing on the slow, languid kiss they share. There is passion within it, but the ardor of their sudden devotion to one another is what carries it. Even when they inevitably pull back for a breath of fresh air, they remain close enough that the tips of their noses brush with the other’s.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I tell you something?” Agatha wonders out loud, and the other woman is quick to nod. “I found something that caught my eye while you were asleep. It was on your desk and I know I shouldn’t have, but I found your…you know, your journal. Rio, I think you might be my-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mira, Rio. Ya mismo vamos a abrir los- oh hi!” The unmistakable sound of Beatriz’s voice fills the room as she cracks the door open. Her head peers through it with a wide grin which fails to falter at the sight of two mortified faces. “Is this your friend from last night? Agatha was it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ma, what the fuck!” Rio yelps. She bunches up the blankets in her hands, but in her state of frenzy, cannot settle between covering her nudity or Agatha’s. In the time it takes for her to push the other woman back and lay atop her, both underneath the sheets, her mother captures a rather embarrassing full glance at them. “Can you learn how to knock? I’m in my thirties and I
     <em>
      still
     </em>
     have to worry about you barging in on me naked?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ay nena, you’re so dramatic. Don’t forget I gave birth to you. I’ve seen it
     <em>
      all
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     But Rio doesn’t care about that, all she wants is to dig a hole right on the ground past the snow and remain there for the rest of time; perhaps until she dies of frostbite, whichever opportunity presents itself first.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh shut up please,” Rio cannot help but cry.
    </p>
<p>
     “¿A quién le estás diciendo ‘shut up’?” Beatriz frowns. “¿A mi me estás diciendo ‘shut up’?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Por favor, vete de aqui,” Rio pleads, her tone small and vulnerable. If she had one Christmas wish, it was for her mother to understand boundaries for once in her life. She flashes an apologetic look at Agatha who can only sympathetically return it. “Sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s alright,” Agatha whispers back. Pulling the blanket from the face, still hiding Rio underneath it, she glances at Beatriz. “Could you give us a moment, Mrs. Vidal. Rio and I have to get dressed.”
    </p>
<p>
     And by then, Rio just about died of shame.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure thing, honey. I hope you’re being safe,” Beatriz sing-songs. “See you girls upstairs.”
    </p>
<p>
     As the older woman makes her exit, Agatha runs a soothing hand over her lover. She shakes her, but no response comes. Not until she rises from the bed and quietly makes her way across the room to the closet without looking back.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hate to see you go, but I love to watch you leave,” Agatha purrs as she intently pays attention to Rio. “Where are you going, sweets?”
    </p>
<p>
     “To make a noose out of my clothes,” the response comes in a deadpan tone, but Agatha knows the poor woman is basking in her humiliation. “I’m going to kill myself. Are you coming or are you too busy being my mom’s new friend?” As she digs out an outfit to wear for the day, ready to shower in a moment, Rio turns suddenly. “What was it that you wanted to tell me?”
    </p>
<p>
     But knowing she was far too worried about their mirage ending and having to return upstairs to her family, Agatha shakes her head. “Nothing, sweetheart. Now, how about we save time and take a quick shower together?”
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     By the time the two of them waltz up the stairs, Rio is quickly pulled into opening presents with her cousin’s children, all while Agatha stands back and watches. She cannot help the longing in the depths of her chest as she studies the image. There is a certain domesticity she has always craved yet never attained. There, in the living room of the Vidal family, she basks in awe at the sight. There is Rio, beaming in a manner she often withholds, as she tears through holiday-themed gift wrap with giggling children around her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not stupid, you know.” Beatriz shuffles beside her. “She might be oblivious to it, but I can tell. Call it a gift, whatever you want. But I see what you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I just found out about it today,” Agatha tells her. “I had a feeling but…”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you need to learn to trust your gut. Otherwise you’ll never get anything done in life. She can be a bit much, but she has a beautiful heart. It’s why she went into teaching psychology. She wants to understand others, but also help others understand them too.”
    </p>
<p>
     The reasoning feels similar to the one Agatha had when deciding upon studying medicine. It is alien to
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     want to spend the rest of her life helping others. To see that her soulmate shares her values only makes her fall further. It’s only been a few days since they met one another, but it has been lifetimes since they poured out their hearts on the rigid pages that were solely theirs to share.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to tell her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You should. I know my daughter well,” Beatriz plants a hand over Agatha’s shoulder. “She will never figure it out on her own. She gets it from her father.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Could I steal her away for a bit? I know how important the holidays are, but-”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t even have to ask,” Beatriz says. “You take her away and show her what she’s been missing all these years – love. Nothing makes a parent happier than seeing their child find love.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words hit Agatha hard. She wishes they were true, that her own mother could have shared a similar mindset before having her thrown out of the house at such a young age. But they’re not, and it hurts to know that. She is well-aware of where the woman is, a sentiment that is shared, yet in decades there has been no attempt to reach out, no apology in the horizon. Agatha tells others she doesn’t have parents, it makes it easier to fend off any curiosity from strangers. But deep down, she has always wanted to feel the warm love of a parent who did as they were supposed to – love their child unconditionally.
    </p>
<p>
     To see that her soulmate can at least attain something she cannot makes Agatha breathe easy.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re welcome into my home anytime.” That is the reassurance Agatha needs, Beatriz knows. “You are part of our family now, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Although she has previously been welcomed by the Maximoffs, there is a sentimentality she gains from her soulmate’s family accepting her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you, Mrs. Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     But the older woman only scoffs. “Please, just call me Bea.”
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     “So, what is the surprise that you wanted to show me? Are you taking me out into the woods to murder me?” Rio flatly asks. “Are you gonna burn me at the stake?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Now that would be a hot date, huh?,” Agatha shoots back. “ I bet you’d look hot all tied up on a stake for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ooh, kinky.”
    </p>
<p>
     Once the family had finished opening the presents, Agatha pulled her soulmate away, throwing her into her own Challenger while stealing the keys. Throughout the drive Rio complained – at times about the snow falling from the sky, while simultaneously being glad to have a white Christmas, then begging Agatha to take it easy with her ‘baby’. There is a lightheartedness to their interactions and they each fear to let go once the holidays subside.
    </p>
<p>
     The path they take is one familiar to each of them. Going through it brings back numerous memories to Rio, who scowls as she sits back, her arms crossed over her chest. Curiosity gets the better of her as she wonders why, out of all places, Agatha would take her there.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon reaching the destination, the car goes quiet.
    </p>
<p>
     “You brought me back to middle school. Fun.” Rio is the first to speak as her eyes dart to the lonely building standing before a wave of white that buffets it – as it should, she muses. “What is this? Why are we here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know, you have looked awfully familiar since I first ran into you. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, and honestly I didn’t figure it out until this morning. But we’ve met.” Agatha turns to the woman. “And not just through our journals.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you smoke something?” Rio is perplexed. “Because if so, I’ll take some of it too before we go back to my parent’s house.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The first time I ever saw you was right here. I didn’t recognize you at first. You used to go by your middle name, right?” Agatha thinks for a second, but the lightbulb pops in her mind immediately. “Roberta was it?”
    </p>
<p>
     The name being spoken into existence brings a pang of embarrassment to Rio’s chest. It has been long since she last referred to herself as such. Ever since early middle school, when her peers had found out her rather humiliating middle name, she had been tormented by it. The teasing only stopped once she graduated. Regardless of how hard she tried to blend in, to become a wallflower, it continued for years.
    </p>
<p>
     “You used to sit in the corner of every classroom sketching away. I remember Mrs. Hart once threatened you with detention for doodling on the desk. She made you clean it up after class.” The memories shot back to them both. “That was you, wasn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I barely spoke back then even when spoken to. I was…so afraid of everyone and everything,” Rio explains, her voice small. “How do you know?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Does the name Agnes O’Connor ring a bell?” Rio’s eyes widened, she has not heard that name in ages. Never had she met the girl, but back in middle school, there were hushed whispers about how much of a troublemaker she was. Beatriz warned Rio about the rowdy student long before. And now, sitting across from Agatha, all became clear. “I changed it to Agatha Harkness as soon as I had enough money. Being associated with that woman was –
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     – difficult for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Silence befalls over the car. While Rio tries her best to find the proper verbiage to reply, her suspicions finally being supported, Agatha awaits rejection at any given time. Fate has bound their souls, but free will may break their unspoken vow at any given time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, I found the journal-”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re my soulmate.” It is more of a statement for Rio to wrap her mind around. Speaking it aloud solidified it in her mind. And out of all the things she could have asked for on Christmas day, this is the one she is the happiest to receive. “Right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right.” Agatha reaches out and is pleasantly surprised to not be rejected on the spot. Instead, she is allowed to plant a hand atop Rio’s gently caressing hers as she takes in the newfound information. “Is that okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     The question makes Rio chortle. “Seriously? That’s more than okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     Neither is sure who makes the first move, but soon enough they are awkwardly embracing one another, their lips joined for a slow, languid dance. For the first time since they met, they truly see one another. The remembrance of all the moments they spent together, all the nights they wrote to the other back and forth in need of reassurance, all came crashing down at that time.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio holds Agatha’s hand, the hand which wrote to her time and time again, which gave her sweet words from a phantom person she never thought she would meet. Their fingers are interlaced, as though they belong there, wrapped in the other for the rest of eternity. Neither can move, nor do they want to. There is discomfort in being within such close proximity to one another in a constrained space, but they ignore it. All for the sake of being with the other at peace.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your mom knew even before I did,” Agatha laughs. Her forehead rests against her soulmate’s and it is just right – perfect, even. “She was surprisingly welcoming. I’ve never had that. Well, I haven’t had that with anyone but Wanda’s family.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure she loves you. All my family seems to be enchanted by you, but who can blame them? You’re perfect.” Rio kisses the back of her hand, allowing her fingers to linger for a smidge of a second. “I had my suspicions when you mentioned Wanda. You kind of gave yourself away then.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you still didn’t know?” Agatha smiles. “Your mom was right. You really are an oblivious little minx, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Never say that to her face. She will never shut up about being right.”
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them sit back and chat, somehow feeling lighter than any previous time. Their cheeks turn red as they face off chills that make themselves into the vehicle, but in each other’s vicinity, they do not feel the cold. There is a weight lifted off their shoulders. A heavy, tumultuous weight no one knew of its existence. Yet as soon as they were liberated from it, only serenity came.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have to go back to New York,” she doesn’t want to, but always the realist, Agatha throws the comment first. “I already told Wanda I couldn’t stay past Christmas. You know my friends and I usually get together for New Year’s, but maybe you could join us. Jen always throws a mean party. I think you’d-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stay.” Rio is not one for begging, but she breaks her own rules for the sake of her sanity. The grip grows stronger. She refuses to, even for a second, let go of her soulmate. Not when their connection to the other was just revealed. After decades of being apart, they have quite a lot of catching up to do. “For me, please. Just for this week. We’ve been searching for one another all our lives. I’m not ready to let you go just yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     So many years have passed since Agatha has felt her presence is needed. Her presence as Agatha Harkness is what someone wanted – not the experienced OBGYN, nor the daughter who always begged her mother for a semblance of love. Just…her. With all her vulnerabilities, all the baggage, and all the dry, at times inappropriate, humor. Rio wants every bit of Agatha to herself. That is enough to make any woman fall head-over-heels for her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not ready to go back either if I’m being honest. I hate this godforsaken town as much as you do, but it’s what brought us together. I wish I could spend all of eternity with you here.” The snow begins to pile atop the car, blinding the windshield as they simply watch in awe. Both fear the reality they may face if they return – they hope it was not all a lie. “I’ll stay. Just for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Since she was kicked out of her home, Agatha has had something of a nomadic perception. She has never gone more than a few months before breaking off a relationship. And as kind as the Maximoffs had been, the poor woman never had a true, humble home. But as she is captured in the trap Rio leaves out for her, her attention unable to go elsewhere, Agatha falls like never before. And by the gods does she fall hard.
    </p>
<p>
     “My, I’m a lucky girl,” Rio bites her bottom lip. “And forget about the hotel. My mom will go crazy if she finds out I let you stay there one more night instead of bringing you back home.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We wouldn’t want that. I only just met her, but I know we’ll get along amazingly,” Agatha shoots back. “I was planning on going to Wanda’s place tonight for dinner. Would you like to come? I’m sure she’d be thrilled to meet my soulmate.”
    </p>
<p>
     The manner in which they nonchalantly speak to one another is one that has been building up for years.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course. I’d love to meet the woman who has taken such good care of you all these years. I owe her a lot.” Rio rests her head atop the other brunette’s shoulder – it feels like home. “So, we’re really doing this?”
    </p>
<p>
     A kiss is planted on top of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, mor. We really are doing this.”
    </p>
<p>
     And if Agatha has to fall, she is more than happy to fall for Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Every.
    </p>
<p>
     Single.
    </p>
<p>
     Day.
    </p>
<p>
     For the rest of time.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     They spend the day basking in one another, growing much closer than they possibly could imagine. After having gone through years of pure loneliness, having finally found one another means the world. Not even seconds pass before they need to be next to the other, giving off toothy grins as they giggle over finally having found their soulmate.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha settles herself into the basement room later in the afternoon per Beatriz’s orders. She cannot help but feel right at home. The constant bickering between Rio and her mother brings her joy. It is a hilarious sight as her soulmate grows frustrated with everything the older woman does, while Beatriz’s nonchalant nature fuels Rio’s annoyance further. And yet it is just right. Perfect, even. Nothing can compare.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to be nervous. They’ll all love you,” Agatha promises. They are sitting outside Wanda’s cozy home, but regardless of how badly she tries, she simply cannot get Rio to budge out of her seat. “Well, the twins might look annoyed when they first see you, but I think that’s just a teenager thing. Since he turned 14, I don’t think Tommy has spoken more than four words to me at a time without needing to look at this phone in-between sentences. Don’t talk to them and they’ll love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Teenagers are horrible,” Rio huffs. “That’s why I became a professor and not a teacher. Even then, a lot of undergraduate students feel like they’re in their early teens.” She shudders as the thought of having to return to teaching once the winter term ends. “And your friends? Won’t it be a bit awkward since you and Wanda have fucked?”
    </p>
<p>
     The bluntness takes Agatha aback. “You should probably lead with something else, hon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess fucking her wife is fair game for me,” Rio jokes, but as she turns, she catches sight of an incredulous Agatha raising her eyebrows. “I’m kidding, Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I do love your sense of humor.” Her flicker over Rio’s body, and even through the layers of clothes, she admires it. “Among other things.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not having sex with you in a car in the middle of winter. Spring, maybe, but never when the weather makes me want to light myself on fire to keep warm,” Rio shoots back, although she fails to admit the thought often crosses her mind. “Keep it in your pants, mi vida. We have more than enough time for ourselves. We just have to get through dinner then we can, uh,
     <em>
      catch up
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     The comment entices Agatha, who licks her lips. “Sounds delicious.”
    </p>
<p>
     As they exit the car, it is Rio who runs around to open the door for her soulmate, even helping her escape with an offered hand. While breathless, and with puffy gloves on, she grabs hold of Agatha’s hand – never willing to let go at that. As one and the same, they take lengthy seconds reaching the doorstep, and the smirks which reach their ears never falter.
    </p>
<p>
     Knocking on the door, it is only a matter of time before Wanda swings it open with a joyous nature to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Merry Christmas, Wands.” And as Agatha speaks, Rio knows the following words have a beauty to them nothing, apart from her soulmate, will ever achieve. “This is Rio, my soulmate.”

<p>
      I am definitely planning on writing another fluffy soulmates fic, although I am unsure about whether I should do single mom Agatha/elementary school teacher Rio or single mom Agatha/vampire neighbor Rio . They are very specific ideas, but very fun to write so far in my drafts. Aaaaand I may write an epilogue to this if I find the inspiration. Thank you all for reading and supporting this fic.
