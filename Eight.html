<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Now, as a bona fide member of an eclectic coven, Agatha could admit that she hadn’t always been the most reasonable witch. Having actual friends has made her more inclined to reflect and grow. And as a result of this newfound propensity toward introspection, she could recognise that there was something gravely wrong with her. Because even when her life finally felt liveable again, a pervasive want continued to eat away at her soul and sanity.<br/>Naturally, it was then, whilst drowning in uncertainty and poorly dealing with a best friend hinting at wanting to be more, that Agatha’s volatile past quite literally comes crashing into her carefully reconstructed life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The "minor Wagatha FWB" tag is reflective of what's planned for this fic. I won't be adding them as a pairing tag as that would create an expectation that won't be met. This is an Agathario fic that also focuses on Agatha and her relationship with her coven.</p></blockquote>

      Chapter 1: The Blood Moon
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The Blood Moon was considered a potent time for transformation and banishing negativity. As a default, Agatha Harkness was a transformation hobbyist and a connoisseur of negativity. Embodying it, verbalising it, basking in it. So it remained a constant surprise, how after four years of lunar cycles spent in the woods around a campfire with her coven, she couldn’t muster an ounce of that cynicism she’d relished in for over three hundred years. Especially not when they’d just completed a Hexenbesen flight over Westview, circling all the way out to Eastview and back. And not when Alice had finally mastered her shielding spells, which allowed them to remain undetected in the clear night sky.</p><p>Agatha practically glowed with pride, the banishment of negativity a resounding success. The early summer evening was pleasantly warm, the sound of Alice lightly picking at her guitar strings while Jen, Lilia, and Billy softly spoke amongst themselves, brought Agatha nothing but peace and contentment.</p><p>Or maybe it was the lovingly cultivated indica strain she’d smoked earlier that made her feel weightless in her comfy camping chair cloud.</p><p>Maybe it was Wanda seated beside her, bloodshot eyes droopily staring into the fire, her gorgeous red hair illuminated by the flames. Or, more likely, it was Wanda’s intoxicating magic that buzzed hypnotically beneath her skin, making all the hair on Agatha’s body stand on end.</p><p>Drawing in a sharp breath through her nose, she shot up from her seat, needing to move. The guitar and conversation halted and her coven looked to her, amused and unsurprised.</p><p>“I’m going home,” Agatha announced, unnecessarily imperious, ignoring their fond smiles that turned to smirks when Wanda stood as well.</p><p>“Come see me tomorrow,” Lilia said, causing everyone to briefly tense up.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes but didn’t want to deal with whatever that was about right then. So she nodded and waved a dismissive hand in their general direction. “Don’t get too drunk, I’m not bailing anyone out of jail tonight.”</p><p>They were already illegally building fires in the woods. Nothing a little spell or two couldn’t get them out of. But they would need either Wanda or Agatha to smoothly get that done.</p><p>“Good night you two,” Jen’s teasing voice called after them.</p><p>“’Night, coven,” Wanda called over her shoulder and fell into step beside Agatha, like a magnet.</p><p>A few minutes into their silent and leisurely stroll through the woods, and Agatha’s high had settled into a pleasing hum.</p><p>Wanda linked their arms. “Jen and Alice are still having sex,” she said, accent thick and pleasantly curling around her tongue. Pretty green eyes now clear and glittering in the moonlight.</p><p>“I’m not sure why they’re trying to hide it,” Agatha mumbled, feeling heat rise at the back of her neck.</p><p>“It’s difficult transitioning a friendship into a relationship when your worried that you might lose your best friend if things go wrong...”</p><p>Agatha hummed, ignoring Wanda’s knowing gaze on her face, and the soothing squeeze on her bicep.</p><p>“I'm thinking of quitting the library job.” Wanda thankfully changed course away from that hazardous discussion.</p><p>“Yeah? Wanna bum it at home with me?”</p><p>“Maybe, for a little while. I need to try something new again.”</p><p>Agatha frowned when she sounded ashamed at the admittance. “Nothing wrong with trying out different things until you find what you like.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Are you feeling antsy?”</p><p>“A little.”</p><p>“Maybe our vacation will help with that.”</p><p>“Possibly.”</p><p>Agatha stopped and looked at her, lifting a brow.</p><p>Wanda shrugged. “I’m feeling stuck. Indecisive.” She got them walking again, pulling Agatha along.</p><p>“Don't force it, hotstuff. There's no rush.”</p><p>“I feel like I’m wasting my life. Letting people down. Like I should be doing something more with all this power.”</p><p>Wanda had once cast a hex on the entire town. A hex so complex and effortlessly masterful, it had Agatha salivating to meet her. Their fight had been spectacular. A fight Wanda had won because Agatha still hadn’t learned when to keep her mouth shut. Rather, she hadn’t quite learned when to not show off when in the presence of a beautiful and powerful woman.</p><p>They’d known each other five years. The first three had predominantly consisted of them dealing with their grief and anger. Their regrets and mistakes. The plan had been to make Wanda believe that Agatha was a friend, make her feel indebted, and then try to take her power again when she least expected it. Instead, Agatha had gone and forged a friendship she was actually invested in sustaining.</p><p>How humiliating.</p><p>“You don’t owe anyone anything, hon,” she said. “You've had people telling you what they want you to do for them for most of your life. Fuck’em, I say.” Agatha smirked and took Wanda’s hand, leading her out of the woods and onto the sidewalk down their street.</p><p>Westview at night was quiet, even on a Friday. They were the only two people walking through the suburban neighbourhood with its neatly trimmed lawns and far too many white picket fences. In town centre, the bell tower heralded in twelve o’clock. Agatha was irrationally irritated that it was electronic. That the tolls indicating noon and midnight came from a speaker, despite the giant brass bell that hung there, aesthetically pleasing yet functionally redundant.</p><p>“Maybe it’s this place,” Agatha murmured, despite knowing that it was just Wanda.</p><p>Wanda was far too kind. Too forgiving, and had offered Agatha a chance at making amends through teaching her about magic and how to control her chaos. Agatha had to convince her to let the people of Westview forget that they’d been held captive and mentally tortured for the duration of Wanda’s grandiose breakdown.</p><p>They knew each other inside and out. All the bad parts and insecurities. Which was why Agatha suspected that hand-waving away what the hex had done, still had Wanda simmering in guilt and feeling like she hadn’t really taken accountability. Personally, Agatha thought the people of Westview were better off not remembering at all.</p><p>The combination of Wanda’s hex and Agatha’s mind control had fried the brain of the guy whose house she’d appropriated. When Wanda’s spell lifted and Agatha was defeated, he’d taken off like a lunatic before Agatha could fix him up like she usually did all her marks. Too preoccupied dealing with a volatile Scarlet Witch who’d just lost her Vision for a second—third?—time, so she really had more pressing matters to attend to than chasing him down.</p><p>Regardless, mind control didn’t need to lead to brain damage and PTSD was what Agatha struggled to convince Wanda of. It was still grossly invasive and Agatha would kill anyone who tried it on her, so she could understand Wanda’s guilt, but it was really for the best to not leave behind any loose ends.</p><p>“We could move,” Agatha offered. An antsy Scarlet Witch was not something anyone wanted to deal with.</p><p>“You love it here.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “Love is a strong word. It’s convenient here.”</p><p>Westview was small and remote. Agatha could control perceptions without interfering too much in town life. It was a safe and secure place for the coven to thrive in.</p><p>“Well, <em>I</em> love it here,” Wanda said with a put on pout she knew would have Agatha rolling her eyes, then broke into a grin when she did. “Maybe I could become a shady criminal like you.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “You're too nice to be the type of criminal I am.”</p><p>“I'm not that nice.”</p><p>“That was more a testament to my level of criminality rather than your capability. You can be my arch nemesis. I'll start robbing banks again and we can have tension filled encounters after each heist.”</p><p>“What does it pay?” Wanda asked, a dangerous smile curling around her lips as they strolled up the pathway to the large three bedroom house they shared.</p><p>“Depends,” Agatha said, opening the front door and holding it for her.</p><p>Wanda brushed up against her like a cat, stopping close and stared into Agatha’s eyes. “Depends on what?” she whispered.</p><p>“On what you’re wearing when you come to foil my plans.” Agatha smirked and followed Wanda’s husky laughter into the house.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They retreated to their respective rooms, Agatha showering away the remainder of her high. She pulled on a pair of light cotton pyjama shorts and a tank top, the evening too warm for anything else. Exiting the house again into the backyard, she entered her massive greenhouse.</p><p>Pruning always cleared her head. There was something therapeutic about cutting away the deadness, blight, and imperfections. It was always in-season in her garden. Various spells controlled the temperature and light, but Agatha irrigated by hand, preferring to judge for herself how much water each plant required. She also worked the soil and made her own mulch, compost, and bone meal.</p><p>Cliche as it might be, she enjoyed tending roses the most. The largest section of the greenhouse was covered in them, with a few herbs and cannabis plants partitioned at the back, not allowed to share the same air as her precious babies.</p><p>Agatha’s roses were the envy in town. Everyone kept asking her for arrangements as though she was a fucking florist. Bluntly telling them no and watching the surprise on their faces was deliciously entertaining. She didn’t let anyone in her greenhouse anymore. Wanda was banned permanently after she invited Mrs. Hart over, who then decided to not shut up about what she had seen. She’d taken pictures and told the town paper and Agatha had been harassed for two years to please exhibit her roses at the bi-annual town fair, until she was forced to magic that nuisance away.</p><p>Craving something sweet after she finished checking on things—stood there for a few minutes basking in the scent that always soothed her—she headed to the kitchen and got out a container of seedless red grapes. Sitting at the kitchen island, she popped them into her mouth one by one and thought over her and Wanda’s earlier conversation.</p><p>She’d been a nomad before Westview, before Wanda and the coven. They could probably travel more, but Wanda was still very recognisable even after years off the grid. When she’d reset the citizens of Westview’s minds, Agatha had slightly changed their recollection of Wanda the Avenger’s physical appearance. Granted, Wanda wasn’t as prominent and ostentatious as Iron Man or Captain America had been at the time, but still pretty unforgettable.</p><p>Maybe she could work on a shapeshifting spell. Those could really mess with a person mentally when they were used for too long, so she hadn’t suggested it yet.</p><p>Making little notes on her phone, she continued to muse over the pros and cons of glamour versus shapeshifting spells, until Wanda entered the kitchen in a sinful scarlet teddy and Agatha nearly choked on a grape. She watched Wanda’s long legs when she lifted onto her toes, the silky material shifting high on her thighs, to remove a glass from the cupboard, before making her way to the sink and filling it with water.</p><p>Wanda then casually turned around to face her, leaning back against the sink, showing off a set of hard nipples as she slowly drank from her glass and stared at Agatha with hooded eyes.</p><p>They were friends. They’d also been having sex for the duration of that friendship. In the beginning, it had been filled with reckless rage, rough and raw. A hungry, angry exchange of magic and bodily fluids. That was back before they’d destroyed the copy of the Darkhold Agatha had been in possession of. Back when the only way Agatha could think of Wanda was as a source of mouth-watering magic she wanted to consume. Back before the destruction of the Darkhold had left an emptiness inside of her as though she’d had her heart ripped out once again.</p><p>She imagined that was how alcoholics felt. Constantly craving and jittery with need. Agatha missed siphoning. Something she could only do when attuned to the Darkhold. Two years since and Agatha wasn’t sure how to be a witch any longer, putting on an air of confidence for her coven to not have them worry.</p><p>How could she tell them that the Darkhold still had a hold on her? That she mourned it like a dead lover. Her thoughts, her dreams, often reminisced on the way Wanda’s magic had pulsed through her veins and rumbled in her chest, had shot right between her legs…</p><p>Sex and magic. Agatha wasn’t sure how to separate them anymore. She’d wielded both as weapons for centuries. Had to rewire her brain entirely and still she struggled. Every day was a constant struggle.</p><p>Wanda turned around to place her empty glass in the sink and Agatha appeared behind her without conscious thought, taking hold of the thin satin covering her hips, smirking in satisfaction at the little gasp and full body tremble that greeted her touch.</p><p>She dipped her fingers below the hem of the teddy, letting them graze across Wanda’s smooth thighs, slowly bunching up the material, drawing it higher, and her stomach clenched when she felt the lack of panties she discovered beneath.</p><p>Agatha groaned and ground her crotch into Wanda’s naked ass, pressing her nose to her neck. “You’re evil,” she murmured and brushed her lips against the shell of Wanda’s ear, tugging the lobe with her teeth.</p><p>Wanda whimpered, and leaned back against her. “Normal people call it horny.”</p><p>Chaos magic buzzed wildly beneath Wanda’s skin. Teasing Agatha. Always most inviting during the full moon. Begging Agatha to take it all. To make it her own.</p><p>She screwed her eyes shut.</p><p>It made her sick to reduce her attraction to simply that. Wanda was attractive, funny, and caring. Agatha would openly admit that she loved her friend. Breathing in the sweet scent of Wanda’s freshly showered skin, Agatha placed a kiss to her shoulder, dragging her focus from the tempting magic to Wanda’s gorgeous body.</p><p>She lifted the teddy higher, gripping the material in one hand beneath Wanda’s breasts and possessively splayed the fingers of her other hand across Wanda’s warm stomach. Mindlessly stroking her abdomen and nibbling at her neck as Wanda softly mewled and rolled her hips into Agatha’s crotch.</p><p>Dazedly Agatha dragged her fingertips lower, slipping between slick folds, and when Wanda let out a delicious moan when she entered her, Agatha teleported them both to Wanda’s bed.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>After, once they’d caught their breath, Agatha kissed Wanda on the cheek and turned to get up and go to her room. Wanda though, reached out and took her hand, halting her in place. Agatha glanced at her over her shoulder.</p><p>“Stay,” Wanda said, gaze earnest and brow furrowed.</p><p>Agatha needed to leave. She was struggling to navigate having both friends and a coven. It had been literal centuries since she’d been in a relationship. Well, she’d been in one committed relationship her entire life and she wasn’t quite sure how to be in another.</p><p>The vulnerability on Wanda’s face though, had her laying back down and wrapping her arms around Wanda when she shifted to lay with her head on Agatha’s shoulder. Wanda knew her apprehension, her worries and fears. It wasn’t as though Wanda herself knew much about romantic relationships either, only having had one significant clusterfuck under her belt as well.</p><p>They understood each other like no one else could. Problem was, Agatha didn’t trust herself to have good things. She only knew how to destroy them. Wanda as a friend was something she was determined to cling to no matter what she had to give up in the process.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>She barely slept. Drifting in and out of consciousness, her arms remained firmly around a softly snoring Wanda. Her mind wouldn’t stop. Stray thoughts, insecurities, plans to keep the coven safe and prospering. The cuttings she was cultivating in the greenhouse and the own roots she had to coax from the soil. Spells she needed to teach Alice, and the latest season of Love Island she couldn’t stop hate-watching because heterosexuals were absolutely ridiculous.</p><p>She’d been more focused when she’d held the Darkhold. Always a scheme, a plan to gain more power. A direction and a goal she was working toward. Clear and confident in her actions and decisions. Now she was broken. Irreparably, it would appear. Agatha Harkness had been destroyed along with the Book of Sins.</p><p>Her eye caught the green ouroboros tattoos around her wrists, a dragon chasing its own tail. It looked similar to the great wyrms of Chinese mythology, long and sleek with thin black climbing rose vines creeping across their bodies. As always, her stomach knotted when she let her thoughts wander too long when looking at them. Under her gaze, they became gorgeously animated, ominously circling her wrists.</p><p> Every magic user she has met could see the dragons, see their circling and the way the roses would bud and bloom. These days, very few seemed to know that they weren’t simply a set of pretty magical tattoos.</p><p>Sun rays glinted against the emerald scales and Agatha decided it was an appropriate time to leave. She magically swapped her body with a pillow, but a sleeping Wanda wasn’t fooled,  unhappily grumbling before scrunching the pillow to her chest and sinking back into a deeper sleep.</p><p>Smiling fondly, Agatha quietly left the room and got ready to go out. She washed the sex from her body, braided her hair into two pigtails, and put on the cleanest comfiest outfit she could find. Downstairs she switched on the coffee machine and stuck a post-it note onto it, stating she was going to collect brunch from Alice’s.</p><p>Donning a hat and her sunglasses she left the house, cringing when she stepped onto the sidewalk and spotted her arch-nemesis fiddling with her mediocre rose bushes. Agatha crossed the street to not have to pass her by.</p><p>“Oh! Good morning, Agatha!” Mrs. Hart waved excitedly, rising from her bushes like a demonic entity. Agatha could not stand her. She was too loud, too happy. She gave her a headache during ninety eight per cent of their interactions. Worst of all, every fortnight, Wanda dragged Agatha over to have dinner at the recently widowed woman’s house and now Agatha had been designated a friend by association.</p><p>Wanda loved Mrs. Hart. It had started out as a guilty conscience, but the two of them seemed to have genuinely bonded. They were growing subpar weed in Mrs. Hart’s backyard for ‘medicinal’ use and always found a way to involve Agatha in it to probe her for advice and tips. Getting high was the only way she made it through those dinners. Wanda also got very horny after they socialised, so at least there was a bright side.</p><p>Mrs. Hart didn’t stop Agatha with any questions. Maybe she tried, but Agatha had gotten lost in thought again. Maybe she should go on a few more trips with the coven. Maybe that was why she couldn’t settle properly, possibly some inherent fear of losing the person she was entirely were she to just enjoy the good things in her life. But that was what everyone expected of her, wasn’t it? For Agatha Harkness, renowned witch-killer, to be wiped away for good.</p><p>She stepped into Alice’s deli on Main Street. A rusty-red brick building, cosy and smelling of freshly baked bread. A couple of tables had been set up, but mostly people came to get their orders to go, or had them delivered, so it wasn’t a surprise to find it empty save for William Kaplan behind the counter.</p><p>“Agatha!” Billy said excitedly, as though he hadn’t seen her the previous evening.</p><p>It had to be something in the water in Westview that made people far too friendly. At times she wondered if they’d been that way before Wanda had hexed them. Well, Billy was from Eastview so he had no excuse, seemingly suffering the unholy curse of being raised by a loving family.</p><p>Agatha grunted in greeting and Billy placed an extra large to-go cup of black coffee on the counter. He’d timed her arrival perfectly as she’d texted him her order when she’d still been at the house. She loved Billy. He didn’t have a lick of innate magic but was getting good at layman analogue spells. He also came in handy since they needed even numbers for the Hexenbesen. Six was also a good number for spiritual balance.</p><p>“Where’s your boss?” Agatha muttered, removing the lid from her coffee cup to inhale the bitter nutty scent like cocaine.</p><p>A pained groan sounded from a shadowy corner and Agatha smirked around the lip of her cup. She winked at Billy from behind her steamed up sunglasses and went over to Alice who lay stretched out across three chairs, her own pair of aviators on her face and the orange-red highlights in her hair pointing in different directions.</p><p>“Beer and grass, you’re on your ass, grass and beer, you’re in the clear.”</p><p>Alice groaned again. “Shut up.”</p><p>“You look like you got ridden hard and put away wet.”</p><p>“God, Agatha, why would you say that in broad daylight.”</p><p>“The kids of today are so ashamed of their sexuality.”</p><p>“I highly doubt that’s true.”</p><p>“Tell me again when you’ve lived through three centuries of LGBTQIA history plus.”</p><p>“Why aren’t you at home and not here?”</p><p>“I came to get food, am I not allowed to patronise your establishment?</p><p>“You’re patronising, all right.”</p><p>“Our good friend Jen was too busy this morning to give you an elixir?”</p><p>“I left before our good friend Jen woke up,” Alice mumbled awkwardly.</p><p>Agatha hummed. “I’ll send some over.”</p><p>“Thanks, Agatha.” Alice lifted her aviators onto her forehead. “You okay?” She squinted, looking Agatha over, and Agatha was relieved at the sunglasses to hide behind.</p><p>“Just peachy, pumpkin,” she said, spun around and went to snatch her and Wanda’s usual orders from Billy, neatly packed into a brown paper bag.</p><p>She then placed a hundred dollar bill on the counter. “Thank you, Billy. If it wasn’t for you I wouldn’t set foot in this shit-hole. Maybe I’ll even call off the health inspector I tipped off last week.”</p><p>Alice snorted and drew her sunglasses back down. “Love you too, Agatha,” she said, lazily waving as Agatha swooped out the door again, feeling a little lighter as she walked further up the street.</p><p>Away from home.</p><p align="center"> </p><p><em>Kale Kare</em> was closed. On a Saturday. Jen couldn’t even pretend that she was running a legitimate business. Finally having a one hundred per cent pure organic product range had really taken its toll on her. She had a small international customer base she catered to with a special range of magic potions, only using the organic beauty line as a front.</p><p>One would think that Agatha and Wanda had the most to overcome on their road to friendship, but where Agatha had failed in taking Wanda’s magic, she’d inadvertently caused Jen to be bound for over a century. Breaking the binding spell had been only the first step to making amends, forming the coven and offering some power in the world they lived in, had been step two. It took time and exposure therapy, but eventually Jen had thawed enough to where she’d become the person Agatha preferred to spend the most time with when Wanda wasn’t around.</p><p>She let herself into the shop and spotted Jen reclining on one of the two facial beds, full face mask on and soft instrumental music playing in the background. Placing her takeout bag, hat, and sunglasses down, Agatha walked to the storage space in the back, through the warded door and into Jen’s alchemy lab, and pulled the hangover elixir from a shelf. The coven was linked from years of ritually channelling magic. Able to reach out and feel each other’s presence and teleport to one another in a pinch over short distances.</p><p>Tuning into Alice, Agatha performed an incantation that sent the elixir to the deli, then walked back out to the shop floor. She scanned through Jen’s selection of face masks and grabbed a cucumber, green and oolong tea mask for herself, grateful Jen hadn’t jumped on that gross tallow trend Sarah Proctor wouldn’t shut up about, and took the seat beside her, placing the mask on her face.</p><p> They laid in blissful silence for a long while, and Agatha may have dozed off at one point.</p><p>“You want to talk about whatever’s going on between you and Wanda?” Jen eventually murmured.</p><p>“After we talk about whatever’s happening between you and Alice.”</p><p>“Guess we’ll spend the next few minutes of your spiral in continued silence then.”</p><p>“Thanks. Though, do you know why Lilia wants to see me?”</p><p>“Probably about our vacation. If she tells you a hurricane’s hitting the Bahamas just pick any location where we can have some sun and beach and book it.”</p><p>“Anything to see Alice’s abs in a bikini.”</p><p>Jen hummed and Agatha smiled, more of the tension seeping from her body. She refused to go home and make Wanda feel bad because she was unable to act like a normal person.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Lilia, at least, had loudly asked her to stop by, so it was a valid excuse as to why Agatha’s brunch run had turned into a late lunch run. She entered the fortune teller’s shop where Lilia continued her Taro card readings as a front. Though, Jen and Alice shared a house in Eastview, Lilia had moved to Westview and chose the same set up she had before, a small shop in the front and living area in the back.</p><p>Agatha walked through into a nice two-bedroom apartment with a study. Predictably, the latter was where she found Lilia staring at her wall of screens reflecting the U.S. and World stock markets.</p><p>The coven all used her as a broker and they owned a substantial portion of commercial property in Westview and Eastview as well as a few residential blocks in Brooklyn and Manhattan thanks to Lilia’s efforts. The properties were all registered in Agatha’s name and she distributed the profits by pushing them back into the coven’s various businesses, investment portfolios and off-shore accounts.</p><p>They had a small fortune saved up, in case they needed to go on the run and start over. Agatha still couldn’t believe they entrusted her with their savings knowing exactly who she was. Who she had been? She couldn’t figure it out and they really were a bunch of idiots for having such unequivocal faith in her.</p><p>“You wanted to see me?”</p><p>“Good afternoon to you too, Agatha.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “I’ve got stuff to do, Lilia. Just lay it on me. Am I dying?”</p><p>Lilia sighed and led her to the kitchen where she put the kettle on. Agatha obediently went to sit at the table. Not saying anything while Lilia made tea. She’d already had a gallon of coffee that day, but accepted the cup anyway.</p><p>“I saw darkness.”</p><p>“In my future?”</p><p>“All of ours. The entire coven. Not Billy, though. It felt like we were together, but everything was black.”</p><p>“Like lights out black, or eyes closed back?”</p><p>“Like endless void of nothingness black.”</p><p>“Huh. Helpful as always.”</p><p>“We were scared.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“I have no idea what to make of it.”</p><p>“Thank you for sharing this burden with me,” Agatha mumbled. “Could you hear anything?”</p><p>“Our screams. I think we were falling.”</p><p>“Plane crash?”</p><p>“Can’t say.”</p><p>“So you want to change our booking?”</p><p>“I don’t know if it’s connected at all.”</p><p>“So no date?”</p><p>Lilia shook her head and sipped her tea. “I don’t want to worry the others.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “We’re not going anywhere together for a couple of weeks so we have some time to figure it out. Could be anything. Maybe a bad shroom trip. I’ll find a way to get everyone to do the ritual with you without telling them why. We can try to see more, okay?”</p><p>They both knew Lilia’s visions didn’t work that way. Not like she could tweak them like the sights of a scope to see the picture more clearly. If they were lucky, she might see something vision adjacent, but whether anything would pop up again regarding that particular vision was a gamble. Weather forecasts were easier, dates and numbers too, but even those were only reliable about eighty per cent of the time. Circumstances involving people were always vague, until they happened, and only then did they make sense.</p><p>Lilia nodded though, still looking extremely perturbed, so Agatha opened the takeout bag and took out her soggy sandwiches. She shared a meal with Lilia and they discussed whether it would be worth it to use the counterfeit money spell Agatha had finally perfected.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>She set off for home with a takeout bag of garlic naan and lamb curry, her brunch run having turned to an early dinner run, feeling worse than she did before leaving the house that morning no thanks to Lilia and her vague vision of probable doom.</p><p>Caught up in her head once again, Agatha wished she could’ve said that she had a feeling something bad was about to happen. But it was a pretty normal Saturday in Westview, save for the shadow that fell across the town. The sun appeared to be mid an unscheduled eclipse.</p><p>Agatha stood staring up at the sky, impulsively reaching out her magic to check in with the coven. Sensing her distress, she felt them all respond, hurrying out onto the street Agatha had been dragging her feet on all day. Wanda appeared beside her in a pretty swirl of red that wafted over Agatha, sending a pleasant shiver up her spine.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t look at her, and Wanda’s gaze went up in the direction of Agatha’s stare.</p><p>Something was falling from the sky and had blotted out part of the sun. Was flaming like a ball of fire as it grew smaller and smaller on its approach like it was burning itself up on the descent.</p><p>Agatha readied her magic, gaping at it heading straight for Westview, not moving like an aircraft, just falling at a gradual pace. It took over three minutes, more than enough time for them to have run, cast a teleportation spell to far away from there. But they stood frozen in place, watching the ball of fire about the size of a small car now, shooting over Westview, clearing town centre, clearing the residential area, and crashing into the field outside of town with a massive <em>boom</em> that had the earth trembling beneath their feet.</p><p>Agatha looked to the coven staring at her with wide eyes, but before she could say anything, the sound of a fighter jet following the trajectory of the supposed meteorite, drew her attention. Helicopter blades could be heard approaching in the distance. They would’ve probably been tracking whatever it was for a while, especially if it had come from space.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said. “The town’s fine. They’ll be focused on whatever that was. Let’s just keep everything clean on our side, yeah?”</p><p>They all nodded distractedly, watching the increasing number of military aircraft heading for Westview.</p><p align="center"> </p>

      Chapter 2: The Meteorite
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The coven gathered up in the bell tower, which used to be a watch tower, back in the day when the citizens of Westview had to defend the land they’d stolen from others trying to steal it from them. They were magically shielded from prying eyes, staring out across the tent village that had popped up seemingly within minutes of the meteorite crashing into Westview. The crater had been covered with a massive green canopy and it looked as though the entire military industrial complex had assembled to investigate.</p><p>Which could only mean that it might not be a meteorite at all.</p><p>Wanda stood rigidly beside her, red irises skidding over the activity in the distance. S.W.O.R.D. was down there too but Wanda’s acquaintance, Captain Monica Rambeau, was somewhere up in space last she'd heard.</p><p>Because the government enjoyed a good cover-up, they’d worked with Captain Rambeau to ensure the hex came down in a manner that wouldn’t spook anyone watching from the outside. She could only imagine the number of road vehicle accidents they’d prevented by not letting the air be torn apart out of nowhere.</p><p>A crunching sound drew Agatha’s attention to the other three squished together, catching Lilia’s hand withdrawing from the bag of caramel popcorn held to Jen’s chest.</p><p>“You guys brought snacks?”</p><p>Alice offered her some roasted cashew nuts. Agatha shook a few into her palm and looked back at the spectacle, chewing contemplatively.</p><p>“I can get us in there,” Wanda said. “With my magic.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a long look. They’d been practising. Messed around with a few people. Nothing intense, just quickly slipping in and out of minds in the most unobtrusive way. Nothing matching the extreme control an infiltration into a remote military base would require, though. Nothing where they were at risk of being classified a national security threat, if caught.</p><p>Besides, Agatha’s main concern at present was those agencies stumbling upon Wanda. There would probably be more than a few people who remembered the last time they’d been in Westview. Two anomalous events within five years was highly suspicious. Whatever tale Captain Rambeau had spun to get them to leave them alone would not hold up after something strange happened again in a town that most people didn’t know existed.</p><p>Agatha had to get in there and do damage control. To make them forget and ignore the town and the coven while they investigated whatever that thing was.</p><p>“We can’t risk them recognising you,” she said.</p><p>Wanda’s big doe eyes shifted to her. “I can do it, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha brushed her hair out of her face and breathed out through her nose. “If you’re sure.”</p><p>“I’m sure.”</p><p>Wanda’s power was linked to her emotions and always would be. Under controlled conditions she did great. Under pressure, well, they haven’t had many opportunities to effectively practise that. If anything went wrong though, Agatha would be there to get them through it. She’d magicked herself out of worse situations before. Back when she had the Darkhold. She was still more powerful than the average witch, just minus a few favoured spells she’d unfortunately made her entire personality.</p><p>“I’ll teleport us out at the first sign of trouble,” she reluctantly agreed.</p><p>She <em>was</em> curious, though. A little excited. Something was pulling her toward the crater. Like it was calling to her. A strong inviting pulse thrummed in her chest each time she focused her magic toward it.</p><p>Wanda grinned, bright and enthusiastic. And maybe they did need to get a bit more adventure in their lives. Wanda seemed to crave the peace and quiet after the life she’d led. But maybe a little chaos on occasion would do them good. Agatha certainly wasn’t built to simply exist in the suburbs.</p><p>“All right, ladies,” she said. “Wanda and I will go in tonight when half of them are hopefully sleeping. Try to steer their attention away from town and the coven and hopefully find out what that thing was that fell from the sky.”</p><p>“I’m going with you—</p><p>“Thank god I don’t need to go in there—</p><p>Jen glared at Alice. “You’re not going with them.”</p><p>“I can shield us while Wanda does her mindfuckery. It’s less pressure on her and Agatha.”</p><p>Alice there would make it a walk in the park, but Agatha was wise enough not to say anything, already confident in what Alice would decide.</p><p>Jen and Alice intently stared at each other until Jen sighed. “Fine, Lilia and I will wait nearby in case you three get caught.”</p><p>Lilia only raised her eyebrows at being volunteered and continued eating her popcorn, staring thoughtfully toward the response base. Agatha suspected that Lilia didn’t share the majority of her visions with them. Mostly because they were irrelevant, but sometimes it was because Lilia was still trying to parse the information together before dropping a bomb on them.</p><p>Regardless, that look in Lilia’s eye told Agatha that whatever went down later that night, it was going to be interesting.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Alice and Jen went to fetch Billy who had been left to man the deli and took him home. Wanda decided to go meditate in preparation of their infiltration, and Agatha left with Lilia to help clear away her wall of monitors. None of it was technically illegal, just highly suspicious. Like their bank accounts should anyone care to look at why the coven’s businesses were fairing so well in a town with so few people and a non-existent tourist draw. Kale Kare could explain away a lot with doctored online sales and an excellent investment portfolio, but Lilia and Alice would suffer the most scrutiny under a magnifying glass.</p><p>Agatha cast an extra-dimensional space behind Lilia’s study and moved the equipment inside, eyeing the various trunks Lilia rolled toward her to stow away as well.</p><p>“Are these dead bodies?”</p><p>“Do you not want plausible deniability?”</p><p>“Just asking if I need to change the temperature in here or not.”</p><p>“Sixty-eight to seventy-seven degrees should be ideal for everything.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Agatha muttered and did as she was told.</p><p>When she was finally done hiding away Lilia’s secrets, she flicked her hair away from her face and looked around the apartment. “You’re going to need to use your laptop. I know it’s difficult to see the tiny numbers in your old age, but we’ll be fine if you miss a selling or buying opportunity or two, or whatever it is you do to make us rich.”</p><p>“Hm. We’ll be getting even richer next week. Don’t you worry your pretty little head about that.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Aw, you think I’m pretty, Lilia?”</p><p>“Only when you don’t speak,” she drawled.</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Why don’t you come and stay with Wanda and I for a while, until this mess blows over?”</p><p>“I’d rather not be around all that tension.”</p><p>“What tension?” Agatha asked, affronted that Lilia would dare mention her business when Agatha had just spent half an hour not questioning a single one of her mysterious trunks and chests.</p><p>Lilia raised a brow. “Are we talking about this?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>She took hold of Agatha’s wrist staring pointedly at the green ouroboros tattoo. “How about we talk about this and how it’s possibly related to that which we aren’t talking about?”</p><p>“But I don’t want to.”</p><p>“Wanda’s a good girl,” Lilia softly said.</p><p>Agatha stiffened, resisting the urge to rip her hand from Lilia’s grasp.</p><p>“Have you told her the truth about these?”</p><p>“She knows I was married. That we’re estranged. That’s what these mean and it doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“Agatha—</p><p>“It <em>doesn</em><em>’t</em> matter.”</p><p>“Hand-fasting tattoos of estranged spouses fade. They fade the second one of them wants out. These are as bright as ever. They seem brighter than the day I met you. She’s going to find out.”</p><p>Agatha finally wrenched her wrist free and placed both hands under her armpits, hiding the tattoos away and hugging herself in the process. “I don’t know why they haven’t faded.”</p><p>“There’s only one reason why.”</p><p>“Well that’s a bullshit reason and clearly untrue.”</p><p>“Agatha—</p><p>“I have to go pick out my spy outfit! Come stay with us later in our tension-free house!” she yelled and practically ran out of Lilia’s place.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Once at home, she summoned her rabbit, Señor Scratchy, into her arms and splayed out on the couch, putting on Love Island to switch off her brain. She’d had Scratchy since she was five years old. Successfully casting the familiar spell at that age had been unheard of. Agatha still remembered the pure pride that shone in her mother—Evanora’s—eyes. She’d been paraded in front of every old crone that visited Salem for three years straight just for that one spell alone.</p><p>Maybe that had triggered her thirst for magic. Her need to learn more and be able to cast impossible spells. Maybe it was the reason Agatha had sneaked into Evanora’s vault just shy of sixteen to steal the Darkhold, studying it in secret for almost two years before she was caught. To impress her mother. To show off her skill and knowledge in exchange for love and affection. That was probably what Wanda’s therapist would say. Agatha wasn’t sure as she refused to go see one herself.</p><p>She pulled Scratch to her chin like a security blanket, breathing him in. He always smelled like shortbread and custard. The comforting scent of a bakery first thing in the morning.</p><p>Wanda entered a few minutes later and quietly sat on the armchair scrolling on her phone. Usually she would’ve sat beside Agatha for a better view of the TV, but everyone kept a wide berth around Scratch. He didn’t like anyone near her, or near him, especially when Agatha needed space to breathe.</p><p>“Did you feel it?” she asked after a while. “The pulsing?”</p><p>Wanda hummed, focused on her phone. “It felt similar to my magic.”</p><p>“Similar to dark magic, too, so definitely eldritch in nature but not like a witch or a person. Maybe an artefact. At times it almost felt like a spell, though…”</p><p>“There’s nothing about it on the news.”</p><p>“Cover up to avoid a panic.”</p><p>“Which means they’ll be crawling all over Westview tomorrow.”</p><p>“Probably already are.”</p><p>Wanda worried her lip before she looked at Agatha. “You ran away again.”</p><p>Agatha pulled Scratchy closer, so tightly he kicked at her until she eased up. “We’re talking about this now? With the U.S. Army on our doorstep? They’re terrorists, Wanda. We should be hiding in our bunker.” Agatha scoffed. “And you said we wouldn’t ever have use for it.”</p><p>“I feel you might prefer detainment over talking about this.” She smiled teasingly, but couldn’t quite hide the hurt in her eyes. “I’ve been locked up in the Raft, Agatha. They know how to deal with witches there. It wasn’t fun.”</p><p>“I wasn’t running away,” Agatha mumbled. Wanda reminding her she’d been detained before only fuelled her need to go to that base later and prevent the same from happening to the coven.</p><p>“You left in the morning and was still in town late afternoon…For all I know, you weren’t coming back at all.”</p><p>“I was on my way back,” Agatha softly said.</p><p>Wanda nodded in acceptance, not arguing the semantics. How long she’d been gone wasn’t what they were talking about, but rather that she’d left at all. They were good at giving each other space. All they needed to do was ask for it. Wanda requesting Agatha stay in her bed the previous night, had instantly triggered her flight response.</p><p>“I’ve told you that I don’t care that my magic makes you horny,” Wanda said.</p><p>“I’ve told you it isn’t as simple as that.”</p><p>“Then maybe I don’t understand. You said you’re drawn to it?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And it’s a part of me.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“So? Some people are into butts, others like breasts, maybe you’re just into magic.”</p><p>“Wanda, honey, I love that you’re trying to make this sound good and sexy, but it really isn’t.”</p><p>“I find it really hot too, you know? God, Agatha, my magic goes crazy whenever you touch me…” </p><p>Feeling a pleasant jolt at the reminder, Agatha glanced at the time on her phone to see how long they had until they needed to go meet the coven and then caught herself, scowling at Wanda who was staring at her with twinkling eyes.</p><p>“Don’t start with me, demon.”</p><p>Wanda grinned. “I know you won’t hurt me.”</p><p>“It’s not about hurting you.”</p><p>“Then what is it?”     </p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure how to explain it. “Ever since we destroyed the Darkhold, I don’t feel like I’m me anymore.”</p><p>“We’re still healing. Still growing and settling. You constantly remind me that there’s no rush, so why aren’t you following your own advice?”</p><p>“I know that I did some pretty terrible things for a very long time…I know we made these promises to each other to be better.”</p><p>“And we are doing better.”</p><p>Agatha nodded absently. “I feel as though losing the Darkhold, I lost myself, and I haven’t really figured out how to be the person I am now. Which makes me think that it’s a bad time to be with anyone. I feel like you’re waiting for me to catch up, be at the same place you’re at, and I’m just not getting there.”</p><p>Wanda swallowed thickly. “I’m sorry for pressuring you.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “The pressure isn’t coming from you, Red. It’s me. I don’t know what I want. You’re still trying out new things, seeing what fits, and me? All I constantly want is the Darkhold back.”</p><p>“Oh,” Wanda breathed softly. “I didn’t realise it dominated your thoughts to that extent.”</p><p>“I didn’t say.”</p><p>“Is there anything we could do?”</p><p>“Do? Like what? Therapy? Talk about how I miss siphoning the magic from multiple witches at once? How I rapidly switch between feeling aimless and unfocused or dead inside for too many hours of the day when I’m not in my greenhouse, or with you and the coven there to distract me? Sometimes not even that helps.”</p><p>“Do you think it was a mistake to destroy it?”</p><p>“I don’t know. The book warned that any caster would eventually lose their minds to the eldritch magic. For a while I thought it was that making me feel this way. But every source I found stated that the deterioration would happen while in possession of the Darkhold, not after ridding oneself of it. And yet all I got were black fingers, since the insatiable thirst for magic and homicidal tendencies has been there since I was a teenager.”</p><p>“I think that might’ve been hormones.”</p><p>Agatha snorted in amusement but sobered soon after. “I had the Darkhold for over three centuries. Very nearly my whole life. Maybe it was the reason I was almost executed, but it was also the reason I could save myself.”</p><p>“They shouldn’t have tried to execute you at all. They could’ve taught you to control it, the way you’ve taught me.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, not having thought of that parallel. That she had offered Wanda the one thing she had begged her mother for whilst tied to that stake, right before Evanora had blasted her magic right into her heart.</p><p>“Do you want us to go murder a few people?” Wanda asked. “I could be into it if you need me to be.”</p><p>“You’re too good to me.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I wish it was about the murder.”</p><p>“You miss the magic of it all.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What was it you said? You took magic from the unworthy? At the time it felt like a threat, but I think those who can't use their magic, can’t control it, <em>are</em> unworthy.”</p><p>“Don’t try to sugarcoat it, sugarplum. It was just something I said to make you feel insecure. My judgement on worth was severely impaired and subjective.”</p><p>“You still served a purpose.”</p><p>“Yes. My own.”</p><p>“Fair enough. Now you serve our coven and by extension this town. Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you mean to us.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed the abrupt lump in her throat and looked to the television screen where the straights were making out in a hot tub.</p><p>“Agatha, we destroyed the Darkhold because we thought it would eventually consume you… If we can be sure it won’t hurt you, maybe we should try to get another copy?” </p><p>Agatha must’ve squeezed Scratch again at hearing that, because he wildly wiggled in her arms and pressed his head against her throat, nearly choking her.</p><p>“I…Let me think about it,” she rasped, heart pounding in her chest. She wouldn’t even know where to begin her search. A copy of the Darkhold was hardly something you could buy online. Chances were she might never lay her eyes on even a page ever again.</p><p>Wanda turned up the volume on the television, sensing that Agatha couldn’t continue the conversation right then. The hot tub heteros had carelessly discarded a lovely bouquet of roses to the side, petals strewn everywhere.</p><p>Evanora had loved roses. The garden back in Salem had been solely maintained by her and later a little Agatha who had hung on her every word, wanting to be just like her mother when she grew up. Patience, Evanora had lectured, we need to cultivate our rose to ensure the perfect bloom. Patience, she'd said, when Agatha had wanted to learn more advanced magic too soon.</p><p>With Scratch had come the whispers and the dreams, a copy of the Darkhold locked away deep in her mother's vault desperately calling to her. When she’d been younger, she'd thought it her imagination, as it only happened every few months. But as her magic ability grew, the whispers became more frequent, more insistent. More tempting.</p><p>Patience, Agatha knew, wouldn’t make the urges go away.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Agatha had always been an excellent mentor. She had taught and guided hundreds of witches for over two centuries, nurturing their skills and talents like a farmer tended their sheep. Fattening them up for the slaughter.</p><p>When she’d decided to establish the Westview Coven, it was to assist Wanda in controlling the Scarlet Witch. Covens shared bonds that made it easier to tap into their magic, stabilise and increase it. Yet, as unexpected as most things in her life since she’d set foot in Westview, Agatha had unfortunately come to care for them all. Most likely another symptom of being a coven witch.</p><p>She thought of the coven like she did her roses, meant to be cultivated and grown. And like her roses, she required them to be exceptional. In a narcissistic way, Agatha relished in their successes as they were a reflection on her own skill and ability.</p><p> Lilia’s visions had become less sporadic, her bouts of verbal outbursts she couldn’t remember the context of, less frequent. Magic users around the world were foaming at the mouth to get their hands on Jen’s potions. They were older though, and didn’t need much guidance especially based on the types of magic they wielded.</p><p>So Agatha spent most of her time focused on increasing Wanda’s control and growing Alice’s power, the coven acting as anchor and amplifier. When they’d first met, Alice had turned her back on her witch heritage and Wanda had been on the brink of destroying everything. And still, for some reason, they'd turned to Agatha for help.</p><p>Idiots.</p><p>They stood huddled in the woods on the outskirts of the response base, completing the ritual spell that would allow them to speak telepathically, Jen almost crushing Alice’s hand in worry.</p><p><em>‘I’ll keep her safe,’</em> she said to only Jen who relaxed slightly, sending Agatha a grateful look.</p><p>For decades she’d trained herself to have a mental block against mind magic. It had saved her from getting killed a few times. Which meant that now, despite being a master at channelling with a coven, she struggled with forming mental links. She had to actively keep her mind open and receptive, and often couldn’t hear the others unless she reached out to them first.</p><p> Alice’s shroud fell over them and they walked up to the boom gate, passing through the checkpoint undetected. The place had less activity than earlier, but there was still a substantial number of armed soldiers about, guarding various tent flaps and container doors.</p><p>The three of them were dressed in jeans and leather jackets as though they rode bitch in a motorcycle gang. Still hot, but Agatha missed changing into her witch's garb. Feeling the dark purple fabric with its shadowy accents flow across her body as an extension of her power. The outfit that used to strike terror in the hearts of her enemies and victims was now a lighter shade of violet and looked and felt so wrong it made her itch being covered in it.</p><p>Worse was Wanda. Who refused to pull on that Scarlet Witch outfit, for obvious reasons Agatha fully supported her in. But what a fucking shame. Alice hadn't even bothered to try. Had said she wasn't into costumes, and fair enough. Agatha had been forced to accept that modern witches really lacked that dramatic flair. Probably due to feminism or whatever.</p><p>Now they were just a bunch of women with magic glowing in their palms and there was something very sad about it that Agatha tried not to linger on.</p><p>Wanda paused, so Agatha and Alice did too. Tilting her head, her delicious magic rose to the surface, covering her in a crimson glow. She appeared to listen for a moment and then a scene was broadcast to the coven’s mental link. Two scientists talking to a uniformed officer.</p><p>“It didn’t come from space,” one of the lab-coats said. “Footage from S.A.B.E.R. shows it appearing in Earth’s thermosphere.”</p><p>The other bespectacled scientist motioned the officer to said footage on a screen, slowed down, where a dark tear formed and a flaming object came hurtling out of it.</p><p>Wanda gently pulled out of their minds without leaving them hazy or disorientated. Perfectly in control of her magic.</p><p>Agatha’s body tingled all over. <em>‘That was very hot, Red.’</em></p><p>Wanda flushed with pride.</p><p><em>‘Please remember I’m in here with you,’</em> Alice mumbled.</p><p><em>‘We are too,’</em> came the response from Jen.</p><p><em>‘Your shielding is also very hot, Alice,’</em> Agatha said. <em>‘Don’t be jealous. Daddy loves you both.’</em></p><p>Alice rolled her eyes, grinning widely, but they all tensed when the large tent that centred the base came into view. Two guards stood in front of the entrance, though it was a tent, so everywhere was a point of entry if you had a sharp pair of scissors.  The military was run by idiots.</p><p><em>‘I’ve been suggesting to them that there’s nothing of interest in Westview,’ </em>Wanda said. ‘<em>We can do a lap around the base to get everyone, but if you want to go in now. We can.</em><em>’</em></p><p><em>‘Let’s be thorough,’</em> Agatha said. <em>‘You still holding good, Alice?’</em></p><p>
<em>‘All good.’</em>
</p><p>They did another lap of the base, trying to find out more information while Wanda worked her suggestion spell, but everyone seemed stumped regarding the meteorite. It appeared to consist of a strange amalgamation of sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic minerals. No organic materials, and ground-penetrating radar scans showed that it might be hollow, yet it was resistant to all ultrasonic and sonic drillers and corers they’d tried using to get a sample.</p><p>The trio circled back to the ‘entrance’ of the large tent and walked in single file between the two guards on either side of the flap. Agatha reached out her magic and suggested there was no need for them to do a check for at least an hour.</p><p>Inside, the tent covered a massive crater. Various sets of steel steps had been constructed that led down to the meteorite and spotlight posts with cameras were set up around it, sending video feed to a room on the other side of where they’d entered.</p><p>Six figures were visible through the observation window of the control room as they made their way toward them, Agatha’s attention though, was entirely on the dark spherical rock down below.</p><p>She hesitated outside when Wanda entered to put everyone to sleep and Alice went to switch off the cameras. Agatha was about to follow them inside, dragging her eyes from the sphere, when she felt an painfully familiar tug on her heart.</p><p>Her feet carried her to the nearest set of stairs, descending them in a trance, eyes fixed on the pulsing meteorite, vaguely aware of Alice and Wanda following.</p><p>She stepped up to the meteorite, her ouroboros glowing green. It <em>was</em> a spell. A shield barrier made of a combination of dark and chaos magic. An eldritch spell likely to be found in the Darkhold, but had never been revealed to her.</p><p>She shouldn’t touch it, and yet she placed her palm against the cool rock.</p><p>A crack formed, splintering across the sphere like branching bolts of lightning. A green glow emanated from inside. Heart furiously pounding, Agatha inhaled a shuddering breath when the feint scent of roses filled the air and the rock shell fell apart to reveal a hollow space and a woman crouched down inside of it. She wore a tight black outfit with fine green detailing. Her dark hair was gorgeously messy and hung loose around her shoulders. Barefoot, she busied herself placing two black oval shaped items—reminiscent of ostrich eggs—into a satchel bag, before she rose to her full height and shouldered the strap, turning to face her.</p><p>Rich brown eyes locked onto Agatha who stood frozen, a knot firmly lodged in her throat and tears brimming in her eyes.</p><p>“Rio?” she croaked.</p><p>Rio smiled tremulously, bowed at the waist whilst extending a hand as though she was offering something in her palm, before her luscious lips rounded and she gently blew across the glowing purple ouroboros tattoos circling her wrist. Luminous violet rose petals sprung forth, prettily showering a stunned Agatha like confetti, before Rio, her satchel of eggs, and the remnants of the shield barrier, all disappeared as though they’d never been there.</p><p>Agatha stood motionless, ears ringing in the sudden silence, warm tears leaking down her cheeks. She hadn’t thought she would ever see Rio again. And in those weak moments when she dared to consider it—needed it, craved it—Agatha had been certain that they would reunite in a clash of anger. That the familiar hatred which had come far too easily and had torn them apart, would resurface.</p><p>Instead, all Agatha felt was the two-century old ache of longing she’d fought down at every glimpse of her tattoos. Her stomach knotted, doubt creeping in as she wondered whether she had hallucinated Rio Vidal right there within touching distance.</p><p>“Agatha?” Alice asked.<br/>

Agatha’s gaze snapped toward them, twin expressions of empathy and concern confirmed that it had been real. That Rio had really been there.</p><p>“I have to go.” Her voice cracked and she teleported home.</p><p> </p>

      Chapter 3: The Alien Invasion

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Her mind had locked up on instinct, severing the mental link. The coven didn’t try to contact her, instead giving her time and space to spiral in her bed in peace. Agatha heard them coming home with Wanda, loudly whispering in the living room downstairs before retiring to their usual spots. Jen and Alice to the guest room and Lilia to Wanda’s room. The sounds of them settling-in faded and Agatha’s mind re-centred back to earlier.</p><p>Back to Rio.</p><p>Two hundred years and Rio crashes into her town, appearing inside of a magical barrier that was drenched in eldritch magic. And she hadn’t been in the meteorite the whole time. Agatha had felt the exact moment she’d arrived, which meant that Rio had been there to collect those black egg-shaped things. That she might have left after retrieving them and those few seconds of seeing her were all Agatha would get.</p><p>The urge to use her ouroboros to feel for Rio was overwhelming, but Agatha resisted, centuries of denial and stubbornness aiding her in not giving in.</p><p>More unsettling than seeing her again, than not being able to muster even an ounce of the anger she’d felt when they’d parted, was the knowledge that Rio wasn’t one to cause a scene. Well, Rio loved to cause a scene, but not on such a grand scale. Certainly not to draw that type of attention.</p><p>And then to smile at Agatha the way she had…after everything.</p><p>Agatha groaned into her pillow but stiffened when her bedroom door cracked open. She had her back to it and light from the hallway filtered in, shining a spotlight on her. Usually when everyone was over, Wanda shared with Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha?” she whispered and Agatha’s chest clenched painfully.</p><p>The door closed and she could feel Wanda in the room with her. Felt her getting into bed. Felt the arms that wrapped around her and the fingers soothingly stroking her hair. Agatha sighed wetly and lost herself in the gentle buzz of Wanda’s magic, having mentally and emotionally exhausted herself enough to fall asleep.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>She woke up just shy of noon, alone, and loved Wanda more for it.</p><p>After dressing in workout clothes—leggings, a sport bra and a long loose purple tank—and pulling her hair into a messy ponytail, she made her way downstairs, intent on going for a run.</p><p>She found the entire coven in the living room, Billy included, all dumbly staring at the news. <em>Alien Invasion?</em> It read on the headline strip below the news anchor before the feed switched to a giant obsidian fortress, various species of Undead creatures flying between tall towers and over high walls. An army of a thousand black armoured Undead stood in a vast courtyard.</p><p>The fortress was encircled by a two-hundred-foot-wide ravine, so deep, the drone footage couldn’t capture the bottom of it from the sky.</p><p>“What the…” Agatha whispered. What was Rio doing? It had to be her. But why? “Where is that?”</p><p>“Smack in the centre of West and Eastview,” Billy said. “It has a shield around it. A news chopper exploded flying into it. A few drones too. There were another few random explosions. Reddit thinks they were missiles but no one has admitted anything.”</p><p>Agatha rubbed her brow and thanked Alice when a steamy mug of coffee was pressed into her hand.</p><p>“Agatha.” She looked up at Lilia awkwardly fiddling with her fingers. “We know you had a shock last night, but…” She trailed off and seemed to give up.</p><p>Jen stared at Lilia as though there had been a discussion that Lilia would ask and then bailed at the last second. Jen being Jen, stepped up instead. “Is your ex-wife trying to kill us?”</p><p>Agatha gulped down her too hot coffee. She’d thought many things after seeing that fortress. Rio wanting to kill them hadn’t made the list.</p><p>“No,” she said. “Rio wouldn’t.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Alice hesitantly asked. “Because…” She motioned to the fortress, straight out of an evil villain handbook.</p><p>“She’s just into that whole aesthetic.”</p><p>Jen scoffed. “Oh, so it’s a cosmetic choice that she displaced half of the woods to put down a castle fortress and summoned her demon army in through portals.”</p><p>“How do you know they were summoned through portals?”</p><p>“They have footage of it happening earlier.”</p><p>“Is it only happening here?”</p><p>“As far as we know,” said Billy.</p><p>Agatha finished her coffee, rolling her burnt tongue around in her mouth for a moment.</p><p>“We should just leave her be,” she mumbled and went to place her mug in the kitchen. There was silence behind her as she grabbed a blueberry muffin, unsurprised to find everyone gaping in disbelief when she returned to the living room.</p><p>“Lilia, lets supercharge you,” she said and bit into her muffin. “Find out if we have anything to worry about.”</p><p>Lilia, thankfully, did not mention the falling into an endless void vision, which fair enough might be unrelated, but probably not. They pushed the furniture aside, the coven seemingly grateful to be doing something. Wanda had been quiet throughout the conversation and Agatha had avoided eye contact.</p><p>Still, they pressed their shoulders together once seated on the floor in the circle the coven formed. Billy handed Lilia a pen and notepad and sat down next to her.</p><p>Agatha extended her hands, taking Wanda and Jen’s on either side. They were all still linked from the evening before, so it was easy to connect, their magic flowing through them like rolling currents. Closing her eyes, Agatha opened her mind and her magic, and led them through the incantation.</p><p>
<em>Sentire nos sororem sicut te sentimus.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Estote fortior nobis, sicut et nos fortes sumus vobis.</em>
</p><p> The spell weaved through them, and Agatha gathered the coven’s magic, gently channelling it toward Lilia. Their voices blended into a pleasant hum, aiding her focus. It was the closest Agatha got to siphoning these days. Strangely enough, she’d never had the urge to consume the coven’s magic like she did Wanda’s, easily guiding multiple streams to encourage and empower Lilia’s visions. Trying to ignore the way the chaos magic warmed her belly as it passed through her.</p><p>An indiscernible time later, though Billy most likely had a timer running since he took notes of everything, they felt Lilia break the chain. Agatha’s eyes fluttered open, all of them pleasantly dazed as they watched Lilia scribbling on the notepad. No one said a word, leaning against each other like drugged up hippies at Woodstock. Agatha had so much sex and drugs in August of ‘69 she was surprised she remembered any of it.</p><p>While she contemplated sending Billy home and suggesting an orgy, Lilia finished writing and then placed the pad in the centre of their little circle. Well, at least that stopped the magic-high induced thought short. They were more of a lets-go-karaoke than a lets-go-have-group-sex type of coven anyway.</p><p>Predictably, Lilia had scribbled down a load of nonsense. A simple list with three columns containing dates, objects, and places. <em>Painting, Ladle, Disc, Carpet, Vase, Tablet, Head</em>. All seven items had the present day’s date beside them citing various cities around the world. The last three all said <em>London</em>. The eighth entry on Lilia’s list was for the next day, followed by <em>House, Hewlett Harbour - Mystery</em>.</p><p>“Yes, Lilia,” Agatha drawled. “This certainly is a mystery.”</p><p>Wanda playfully hit her arm, everyone still staring at all the random words and places until Alice drew the notepad toward her and snapped a picture with her phone. “I’ll start Googling.”</p><p>Everyone nodded and got up off the floor.</p><p>“Or…” Jen said, looking at Agatha. “You can go ask her what she wants?”</p><p>Wanda frowned. “Is that safe?”</p><p>“She won’t hurt me,” Agatha said.</p><p>“So?” Jen asked expectantly, ignoring Wanda’s glare and Billy and Alice’s looks of trepidation.</p><p>Lilia stared at her ouroboros, making Agatha squirm. “Fine. I’ll go.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth opened and closed and then stayed shut when Alice placed a hand on her arm. Agatha didn’t look back as she marched out the door to go speak to Rio.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>The fortress shield covered a half-mile radius, and Agatha approached it from the Eastview side, through the forest, to avoid being anywhere near the response base that had grown disturbingly in size since the previous evening. There were tanks, armoured vehicles with heavy artillery, squadrons of soldiers and a few sleek black SUVs that unsettled her the most.</p><p>Only when she got to the edge of the woods did Agatha realise she was still wearing her workout clothes. She placed a loose strand of hair behind her ear and considered changing, but that would just mean too much, wouldn’t it? No, she wouldn’t give Rio—who decided that it was just fine to flip her world upside down and then vanish without a word—the satisfaction.</p><p>Lifting a hand, she felt around in front of her until she met resistance. Her tattoos glowed green and an opening formed in the shield, distorting the air at its edges, growing large enough for her to comfortably step through. She stopped at the edge of the giant ravine and contemplated whether she should fly over in full view of the multitude of cameras likely live-streaming it to the world.</p><p>After a moment, she began casting an invisibility spell, but stopped when a narrow stone path formed, running across the trench to the other side. It was a precarious foot in width and Agatha eyed it sceptically.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m not setting foot on that,” Jen said from right behind her and Agatha jumped in her skin.</p><p>She spun around and found the entire coven standing there. Alice had gotten far too good at her shields. Agatha was as proud as she was annoyed.</p><p>“All of you being here is a bad idea.”</p><p>Alice’s chin jutted out. “We’re not letting you go in there alone.”</p><p>And so Agatha discovered one of the major drawbacks of having a coven. Of having people who cared about her for some reason. Apparently, they tended to do very dumb things thinking they were protecting her.</p><p>“Rio is…” Agatha tilted her head to the side. “A very complex woman. She’s not going to like that you’re here. It’s going to make talking to her a lot more difficult.”</p><p>“More reason for us to be here with you,” Jen said.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Ladies and gay, I’m begging you, for once, please listen to me. You wanted me to find out what she’s doing here, I agreed. So I need to do this my way or we won’t get anything out of her.”</p><p>“You said she wasn’t dangerous.” Wanda frowned. “Why are you so worried?”</p><p>“Depends on your definition of dangerous, I suppose.”</p><p>A thundering roar sounded from the fortress and their gazes snapped across the narrow bridge to where a massive black dragon stood staring directly at them. Unlike her ouroboros, it was more Game of Thrones in style, at least five storeys tall, absolutely breathtaking, and heart-wrenchingly familiar.</p><p>“She’s just trying to scare you,” Agatha distractedly mumbled, eyes trained on the magnificent dragon as it took flight, enormous wings powerfully flapping as it flew towards them. “Don’t panic. Don’t run.”</p><p>Someone screamed. Agatha wasn’t sure who. Possibly both Jen and Billy matching pitch.</p><p>“No magic!” she shouted when Alice and Wanda’s magic gathered in their palms. Of course they didn’t listen, Agatha doubted she would’ve either in their position, and blasted the dragon menacingly closing in on their location. The red and orange streams glanced off sleek inky scales and emerald eyes glittered mischievously at Agatha.</p><p>Her shoulders loosened. “Rio!” she yelled up at the dragon. “Either kick us out, or let us in!”</p><p>The dragon reared back, somehow still elegant in its movements, the wind caused by its muscular wings had Agatha’s hair whipping around her face and falling loose from her ponytail. Through teary eyes she watched the gigantic maw unhinged, showing off a set of razor-sharp teeth and a swirl of bright green flames gathering in the dragon’s throat.</p><p>“Agathaaaaa!” she heard Billy shouting and really, she stood taller at the realisation that none of them had run yet, standing behind her and clinging to each other, sure, but holding ground nonetheless.</p><p>Agatha smirked up at the exquisite sight and her eyes fell shut when green flames were breathed out all around them.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, they stood in a large hall, all black marble and colourful stained-glass windows casting beautiful patterns across the polished interior. The room was vacant of furtniture save for an elaborate dais floating above an endless pit of nothingness. Rio was seated on an obsidian throne, a sharp angular design making up the tall backrest. She wore a black dress with the sides of her waist bare, integrate patterns sliced across her chest. Her dark hair hung loose, falling over toned shoulders and her crown perched neatly on her head. With her shadowy make-up and full lips painted black, she looked gorgeous and ominous whilst playing with her knife in one hand, legs crossed at the knee, and feet bare.</p><p>Dark eyes bored into Agatha who stared back enraptured. It took Wanda’s magic flaring to shake her from her stupor and finally notice Billy seated like Princess Leia on a pink cushion beside Rio’s feet. A leash curled around the long fingers of Rio’s other hand, attached to a spiked collar around Billy’s neck.</p><p><em>‘Calm down,</em>’ Agatha said through their mind link. ‘<em>It</em><em>’s not a sexual thing</em>.’</p><p><em>‘It’s something not right</em>, <em>is what it is</em>,’ Alice said.</p><p>‘<em>It</em><em>’s her provoking you.</em>’</p><p>‘<em>It</em><em>’s working</em>,’ Wanda said. And when a green ball gag popped into Billy’s mouth when he tried to speak, a translucent red crown formed around Wanda’s face.</p><p>‘<em>She won</em><em>’t hurt you, Billy,</em>’ Agatha reassured and looked to Rio, whose gaze had shifted to Wanda. A slow smirk spreading.</p><p>“So testy, Scarlet Witch,” Rio drawled.</p><p>The abrupt surge of Wanda’s magic had Agatha feeling dizzy. Impulsively, she reached out and took her hand. They were both tactile creatures. So it calmed Wanda but Agatha realised her mistake too late when the temperature throughout the room dropped, drastically and rapidly. Agatha shivered, breathing out a white cloud of vapour. Rio’s gaze was fixed on their hands, the purple ouroboros around her wrists glowing brightly against the dark backdrop of her visage.</p><p>Blinking slowly, Rio looked to Agatha, easing back her shoulders and relaxing her jaw. “You look good, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha awkwardly pulled at her clothing, letting go of Wanda’s hand to do so. The sincerity in Rio’s tone made heat rise up her neck, fighting off the goosebumps that spread up her arms. She tried to tame her windswept hair and wished she would’ve dressed for the occasion, maybe then she wouldn’t have felt as unmoored being in Rio’s presence again.</p><p>Beside her, Jen and Alice were trying and failing to cast a heating spell while shivering their assess off.</p><p>“What are you doing here, Rio?” Agatha said through a clenched jaw, trying to keep her teeth from chattering.</p><p>“Minding my business. Unlike you.”</p><p>“This is how we’re playing it?”</p><p>“I remember very clearly your expressed desire to never see my face again, and yet...” Her knife twirled between her long beautiful fingers and the sharp tip was waved in a casual arch to encapsulate the coven.</p><p>“You’re making it very hard not to see your face.”</p><p>“Am I? I was just chilling with my eggs and there you were…Then I was pondering on my throne, and here you are.”</p><p>“No one says chilling anymore.”</p><p>“I just did.”</p><p>Agatha scowled. This was a part of Rio she hated. Once, Rio purposely annoyed her so much that Agatha blew a hole through a castle wall and destroyed an entire army and then they’d fucked for days in the dead count’s bed.</p><p>Okay, maybe she didn’t hate it all the time.</p><p>“Rio, I don’t have the energy to deal with this.”</p><p>“So don’t.”</p><p>And Agatha really didn’t want to, but if she didn’t deal with it, the others would try to figure it out on their own and look where they were with mediation, freezing to death in a fortress while trying to reason with a brick wall.</p><p>“You brought the military to our home,” Wanda said and Agatha drew taught, her back hurting from shivering, on the verge of snapping. “You could at least have the decency to explain why you’re here and what you want.”</p><p>Rio abruptly appeared in front of Wanda. The others jumped back in surprise, but Wanda stood in place as her magic surged protectively. Combined with the sudden rush of Rio’s scent wafting up her nostrils, Agatha’s knees grew weak and her brain turned to mush.</p><p>“Well, <em>Wanda</em>,” Rio said, their faces so close their lips nearly touched. “I think you could at least have the <em>decency</em> to not demand geniality from me, when you’re fucking my <em>wife</em>.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, her eyes fell shut and her frozen numb hand covered her face. She wanted to teleport far away from there. Away from civilisation. Some quiet time spent in the mountains with Scratchy and her weed stash would be ideal.</p><p>Wanda, thankfully, did not take the bait, too focused on keeping her roiling magic under control.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha murmured, and Rio took a step back, dragged her taunting gaze from Wanda, to settle a cold hard glare on Agatha. “We’ll just leave, okay? It was a mistake coming here.”</p><p>Rio cocked her head. “You think?”</p><p>“Don’t be an ass. Your presence has dangerous people snooping around my coven. We’d rather not be on their radar. That’s all this is about.”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio said, hands going behind her back, her posture loosening and the air warming as a charming smile spread across her lips. At once disarming instead of threatening if you didn’t know her as well as Agatha did.</p><p>Rio shifted her attention to the rest of the coven, who watched her warily while rubbing the warmth back into their skin.</p><p>“I’m so very sorry, Agatha’s Coven. Please forgive the unfortunate circumstances caused by my visit. I’m Rio by the way.”</p><p>“Hey,” they chorused, equal parts intrigued and unsettled.</p><p>“Regrettably, I have some business in the vicinity so I’ll be here for the next few weeks at least. I hope you understand.”</p><p>Jen cleared her throat. “No, of course, we get it. Shit happens.”</p><p>Alice nodded enthusiastically as Lilia lifted a brow looking Rio over with interest.</p><p>Rio clapped her hands and everyone startled. “Well!” she said, at once seated on her throne. Billy stood beside Lilia, clearly disorientated, the leash still dangling from his spiked collar and the gag still in his mouth. Lilia placed a steadying hand on his shoulder, eyes on Rio. “Look at that, Agatha. Your coven’s been placated and they forgive me.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to ask that they be teleported outside the shield again when she felt Wanda’s magic rise.</p><p>
<em>‘Calm down, Red.’</em>
</p><p>
<em>‘I’m sorry. I can’t.’</em>
</p><p>Even through the mental link, Agatha could hear Wanda’s struggle for control.</p><p>Rio stared at Wanda curiously, and Agatha took her hand again, threading their fingers together, brushing her thumb across Wanda’s until she could feel her magic calm. Wanda could not lose control given where they were.</p><p>Once she could see Wanda’s shoulders loosen and feel her magic draw back, she hesitantly looked up to the throne where Rio’s gaze had gone glacial.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>“Agatha, sweetheart,” Rio said, deadly calm, face void of expression, and jaw stiff. “I'm going to need you and your coven to leave. Right now.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and dragged Wanda away, grateful when the others followed without prompting.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>She had no desire to use that shaky looking bridge over a pit of darkness, especially not with Lilia’s void vision playing in the back of her mind, so they cast a group teleportation in full view of a platoon of giant armoured Undead carrying spears and swords with glowing green blades.</p><p>Agatha was only grateful that Rio had lifted the teleportation block on the shield and allowed them to leave, most likely in a bid to get them out of her hair faster.</p><p>No one spoke until they were back inside the house, spread out across the living room.</p><p>“So…” Jen said, lips pursed as she tapped her nails against the armrest. “Rio’s interesting.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “Not as bad as I thought that would go.”</p><p>“What a scary bitch…” Lilia muttered to herself.</p><p>“We still know nothing,” Wanda said, eyes on Agatha who stood on the other side of the room, unable to look at her. Angry that she’d asked them to let her do the talking and then Wanda of all people decided to engage.</p><p>“What do we do now?” Billy asked, the ball gag hanging around his neck as he absently played with the leash. Agatha feared Rio might have inadvertently awakened something in him.</p><p>“If she won’t tell us what her intentions are, we’re going to have to figure it out for ourselves,” Wanda said. “Come on, Alice.” She got up and led a wary Alice to Agatha’s study and when the others turned to her, Agatha felt the room growing smaller.</p><p>“I need to water my roses,” she mumbled and fled to the kitchen and out the back door. Then teleported to her bedroom.</p><p>She changed into a dark maroon shirt, black dress pants, and a pair of heeled boots. While rolling the sleeves up to her elbows she moved to her vanity to collect her locket. She had left it there that morning, unwilling to risk losing it during her run, especially not when her mind was a mess. A locator spell would help, but who knew what could happen to it while she searched.</p><p>Fastening it beneath the collar of her shirt and nestling it at her throat, she tenderly brushed her fingers across the Triple Goddess, thinking about the baby hair the locket had kept safe for centuries. Thinking about Rio…</p><p> Shaking out of her memories, Agatha fluffed out her hair, magically adding some length and volume, and teleported to the backyard. She paced there for a while, the sun setting, and rubbed at her wrists. Inhaling a fortifying breath that only seemed to quicken the thrumming of her heart, she called to Rio, watching the pretty green glow of her tattoos at the request.</p><p>She waited with bated breath and sinking disappointment when Rio didn’t appear. About to give up and head inside, she finally felt that familiar tug at her heart, her gaze snapping to movement from inside her greenhouse. Exhaling a long breath, Agatha made her way over, smiling softly when she entered and walked through the trellis arch of pink climbing roses that saturated her in their scent.</p><p>She stood watching Rio enraptured by her babies. Rio who had opted to wear black jeans, a skull branded T-Shirt, and a pair of sneakers. Her hair was loose and her ouroboros bared as she gently touched a yellow bud on one of Agatha’s container miniatures.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes tracked her hungrily, remaining very still to avoid scaring her off, as Rio flitted from rose to rose like a butterfly. She mentally took note of how long Rio spent studying each of them to gauge which ones she liked best.</p><p>Rio left the centrepiece of the greenhouse for last, and made her way toward the large black blooms with their green tipped edges and Agatha’s stomach fluttered in anticipation. Rio reverently ran a finger down a tall stem, heedless of the sharp thorns. It had taken Agatha decades to get the perfect proportions. To get a specimen with the looks of a hybrid tea rose and the fragrant potency of the old garden roses she’d grown up with. The colour though, green roses were rare and often a pale olive rather than the vibrant harlequin green Rio loved. Agatha had painstakingly bred with the greenest mutations she could get her hands on and finally nailed it. After centuries of compulsive propagation.</p><p>Rio pressed her nose to the large bud, inhaling, her long lashes fluttering and Agatha's smile spread along with hers.</p><p>“Oh, Agatha…you did it,” she whispered, carefully touching a petal and the rosebud opened and bloomed for her, like Rio was the sun. “They’re perfect...”</p><p>Agatha preened, her heart growing full. Last Rio had seen them, they were a different variant, the stems too thin to carry the heads and they kept drooping and dying prematurely, growing in too large bushes instead of the elegant single stem she’d been striving for.</p><p>“Have you named them?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “<em>Nuestra Se</em><em>ñora de la Santa Muerte,</em>” she said. Rio grinned, amused and utterly delighted. Agatha shrugged sheepishly. “Holy Deaths for short. I’m not known for my imagination.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly, reluctantly stepped away from the Holy Deaths, and bit her lip, hands slipping into the back pockets of her jeans.</p><p>Seeing her like this, in this time period, was so surreal and yet somehow Rio blended perfectly whilst still being so completely and implicitly herself.</p><p>“You called for me?” Rio softly said.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, halting a foot away when Rio stiffened at her careful approach.</p><p>“You forgot to fill your moat,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>“I didn’t want to displace that much water.”</p><p>Agatha hummed.</p><p>“What do you want, Agatha?”</p><p>“Is it bad? Whatever's happening?”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders curled. “Yes. But I'm handling it.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Do I need to take the coven away?”</p><p>Rio swallowed and shook her head. “The fortress will be the safest place should it come to that.”</p><p>“Thank you,” she rasped, taking a careful step closer, because she couldn't stop herself. “Can I help in any way?”</p><p>“I've got it handled,” Rio told the ground, her hands leaving her pockets.</p><p>She looked exhausted, worried, and Agatha slowly reached out to cup her cheek. Aching when Rio gently grasped her wrist, and turned her face to press a lingering kiss to Agatha’s palm, and another to the green dragon covering her wrist, causing a shiver up Agatha’s spine. Rio’s eyes briefly fell shut at Agatha’s physical response to her. A single tear escaped her lashes and rolled down her cheek, onto Agatha’s tattoo.</p><p>Agatha wrapped her in a hug before she knew she was going to.</p><p>Rio melted into her, and Agatha cupped the back of her head, cradled her into her neck. Smelled her hair, and remembered how no rose had ever been able to come close to Rio’s scent. Agatha had tried. Had been trying for centuries to replicate her smell. But Rio’s rosy scent contained hints of amber and papyrus that added a woodsy warmth Agatha doubted she’d ever be able to organically reproduce.</p><p>So she breathed her in and held her close. Focused on Rio’s hands tightly gripping her back, desperately clinging to her. And tried to remember why she had ever allowed things to spiral so tragically between them. How she’d ever thought she hated Rio. How she could ever say those horrible things she’d said and still have Rio there holding her back like a lifeline.</p><p>“Agatha?” Wanda's voice sounded from outside and Rio stiffened in her arms then jerked out of the embrace, causing a wave of cold to wash over Agatha. Deep brown eyes shimmered with hurt and betrayal, Rio’s fists clenched and expression wounded.</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha rasped through a thick throat and painfully clenching chest.</p><p>Rio tried and failed to smile, her lips wobbling.</p><p>Tears fell across Agatha’s cheeks at the melancholy sight.</p><p>“Please don’t go,” Agatha whispered, her voice cracking. Needing to explain. What, she wasn’t sure, but she couldn’t let Rio leave again. Not after hurting her, <em>again</em>.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes as though in agony, blindly pulled her knife, and disappeared even as Agatha reached out to try and stop her.</p><p>“Alice found something,” Wanda said, sounding hesitant, not making any attempt to enter.</p><p><em>‘I'll be there in a minute,’</em> Agatha replied telepathically so she could regulate her voice. Her chest and throat too tight to form a verbal response.</p><p>And at Wanda's retreating footsteps, Agatha pressed a hand to her mouth, lowered to the floor, and silently shook with sobs amongst her roses.</p>

<p>“Did you change your clothes?” Jen asked, brows knitted when Agatha entered the living room twenty minutes later, having used magic to clean her face and remove the puffiness from her eyes.</p><p>“Is it a crime now for a woman to get dressed for the day?” Agatha muttered, lowering into an armchair and summoned Scratchy into her lap. He promptly hissed at Billy seated beside her on the floor who quickly scrambled away.</p><p>Jen looked as though she wanted to say more, searching Agatha’s face, but thankfully decided against it, turning to Alice instead.</p><p>“The news of the demon fortress is obviously dominating headlines worldwide,” Alice said, looking Agatha over with concern. “Totally overshadowing three prominent items that were stolen today at the British Museum in London. The Rosetta Stone being the one to draw the most attention, along with a Sophilos Vase and one Ife Head.”</p><p>Agatha could barely focus on what Alice was saying, absently nodding, her mind stuck on the day she’d buried their son and screamed at Rio to never come near her again.</p><p>“Tablet, Vase, Head!” Billy excitedly said, ticking the items off on Lilia’s list. He was still in his leash and collar. Agatha was going to need to have a conversation with him about that. They’d made it through the safe gay sex talk just fine, so would likely power through BDSM and leather subculture.</p><p>“Exactly.” Alice grinned. “So I started adding ‘stolen’ to the search along with the item descriptions and places Lilia mentioned, narrowing it to today’s date and found a couple more hits since these are actually some pretty famous pieces. Like Van Gogh’s Starry Night that was stolen from the Museum of Modern Art in New York.”</p><p>“Painting!” Billy grinned like he was on a game show.</p><p>“An ancient <em>hishaku</em> was stolen from a tea museum in Shizuoka, Japan.”</p><p>“Ladle!”</p><p>“The Nebra Sky Disc was stolen from the State Museum of Prehistory in Halle, Germany.”</p><p>“Disc!”</p><p>“And a Pazyryk rug was stolen from the St Petersburg Hermitage Museum.”</p><p>“Carpet!”</p><p>“Yes, thank you, Billy,” Lilia mumbled, rubbing her temple like she had a headache. Even distracted as she was, Agatha could feel the magic pouring off of Lilia.</p><p>“So, this is about a bunch of thefts?” Jen said. “Doesn’t seem like it has anything to do with sexy Rio and her demon army.”</p><p>They all looked to Lilia who got up with a sigh, walked over to Alice, and covered Alice’s eyes and mouth with her palms, her own eyes falling shut. The house lights flickered on and off and the fireplace burst into golden flames, and then Lilia gasped, eyes flying open.</p><p>“Victorian house, number 169, Hempstead, Long Island.”</p><p>“Hewlett Harbour Mystery!” Billy shouted and with an elated flourish ticked off the last entry dated for the next day.</p><p>“Great…” Jen said, looking around the room. “Still don’t see what any of this means.”</p><p>Lilia shrugged and went back to her seat, picking up her cup of tea, her magic settling with a sigh.</p><p>“We should obviously go to Long Island,” Alice said. “Catch the thief red-handed.”</p><p>“We’re not vigilantes.” Wanda frowned. “But these visions must be important.”</p><p>“So we go have a look, see what we find?” Alice offered. Her stint in the police force had a really unfortunate impact on her.</p><p>“I’m in,” Jen said. “If only to get out of Westview’s current crazy for a day.”</p><p>“Okay,” Alice nodded. “Road trip tomorrow morning?” They all looked to Agatha, who stood from her chair, Scratchy clutched against her chest.</p><p>Getting out of town sounded good.</p><p>“You’re all welcome to stay over again. We’ll set out early,” she said, avoided eye contact, and fled upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>Walking into her room, she quickly locked the door behind her, then froze at the sight of Wanda perched on the stool in front of the vanity.</p><p>“Fancy meeting you here,” Wanda said, a teasing smile not quite reaching her eyes.</p><p>Agatha sighed and sunk onto her bed, compulsively stroking Scratchy, while she longed for the mountains.</p><p>“Agatha, your greenhouse isn’t made of glass, but it isn’t made of bricks either,” Wanda spoke evenly, carefully. Like Agatha was some skittish shelter pup at risk of being further traumatised by loud noises. “I know you saw her and that’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “It is?”</p><p>“I don’t want you to feel like you need to hide this from me. We’re not in a relationship. I don’t want you to think that I suddenly expect you to act that way. ”</p><p>Agatha was very certain it wasn’t as simple as that.</p><p>“You told us she was a green witch…”</p><p>“She sort of is.”</p><p>“Sort of?”</p><p>“I can’t tell you more.”</p><p>“Is it a warding spell, or a sigil?”</p><p>“No, it’s just an understanding between us.”</p><p>“Okay. Do you still love her?”</p><p>The ouroboros glowed as a sharp ache stabbed at her heart. Agatha would always love Rio. Hadn’t stopped for a second even when she thought she’d hated her. Even when she thought she would never see her again.</p><p>“Because she clearly still loves you.”</p><p>“That was just Rio wanting us gone and being an ass so we would leave.”</p><p>“You still haven’t answered.”</p><p>“I haven’t seen her in two centuries, Red. This fortress, her Legion of the Doomed, she would never have done this before. She has rules that she follows no matter what. No matter <em>who</em> it may hurt.” Another pain shot through her chest and how humiliating for a witch of her calibre to die of a heart attack. “What she’s doing right now goes against all of them. I don’t know if she’s even the same person anymore. Whatever’s happened between you and me and what I had with her, are two entirely separate things.”</p><p>“So the reason you run from any form of commitment is not because you’re still in love with your very hot and intense ex wife?”</p><p>“I can’t commit to you, because like I told you the other night, there’s something wrong with me.”</p><p>“I don’t know how to handle this if you won’t talk to me, Agatha. I don’t know if I should stay away and give you space, or offer support as a friend.”</p><p>“You need to do what’s best for you, not what I need.”</p><p>“The connection you two have doesn’t exactly feel like magic, but its definitely something near tangible.”</p><p>“Rio and I are over. I told her two hundred years ago that I never wanted to see her again and she was <em>fine</em> granting that request.”</p><p>“You sound angry at her for doing what you told her to.”</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“I told her to leave plenty of times. She <em>always</em> came back when I needed her. But then Nicky died and he was gone and then she was gone. And I lost both of them at the same time along with my fucking mind.”</p><p>“So you didn’t want her to leave.”</p><p>“It’s been two centuries, Wanda. She could've found me at any time. These tattoos make it as simple as wanting to and thinking it.”</p><p>“Did <em>you</em> try and use them to find her?”</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek. “No.”</p><p>“So how would she have known that you needed her back?”</p><p>“She should've known. She always knows. She's not even here for me right now.”</p><p>“Your matching tattoos glow sometimes when you’re together.”</p><p>“They’re magic, they do what magic does.”</p><p>Wanda scoffed lightly. “I’m going to tell you a few things you might not want to hear right now.”</p><p>Agatha warily met her gaze.</p><p>“You're good with people when you want to be, and they’re easily drawn to you. You’re someone to look up to, someone dependable and that’s clear in the way this coven trusts you with our lives and our hearts.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, biting her tongue to stop herself from denying it. From calling them idiots out loud.</p><p>“You’ve gotten into your head this concept of being “good” when all any of us have been focused on is trying to be better. I want to be better. And I think you want that too.”</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through her hair. “Wanda, you were the first person in centuries to actually try to understand why I am the way I am. The first one in ages I connected with. I love that you aren’t scared of me and challenge me. But, I also love how volatile you can be. Love that there’s always a chance you could snap and utterly destroy everything around you. I love that you can kill without a thought. I love that you can be selfish regarding the people you see as yours. I love all those things about you. I’m attracted to all those things that you hate about yourself. I don’t know how to turn that off and be the person you need me to be. I’m constantly worried that if our friendship continues, I’m going to pull you into the darkness I constantly crave.”</p><p>Wanda gave a shaky nod. “I knew that. I’ve told you before, I’m not as nice and good as people keep saying.  I love that I don’t scare you either. Your…urges don’t scare me. I still feel you would make a great partner to someone based on how we’ve built our friendship on very blurry lines. On how you’ve treated me and made me feel good about myself after everything I’ve done. Made me feel strong enough to stay in control when I’ve felt anything but. And I know you are a great mother…”</p><p>God, she needed Wanda stop.</p><p>“I want to have a family again, Agatha. I want to raise my children within the support of our coven and in the stability that Westview provides.” She inhaled shakily. “Up until a couple of days ago, I was picturing that family with you. Entirely my own doing because you honestly haven’t given any indication that you might want that too. But I know you are all these wonderful things that I want, and these dark and dangerous things that are kind of hot, and you make me feel safe and understood. And I thought, lets see if we can have that together. Just see how it goes because I was confident that even if it didn’t work out, we’d remain friends like always and I would stop wondering about it constantly.” Wanda gave a little one-armed shrug. “And every time I tried to pitch that idea to you, of just seeing if something more would work between us, you would run. Avoid. Deflect. And I didn't understand what was stopping you, until I met Rio.”</p><p>“Rio's not stopping me,” Agatha rasped.</p><p>Wanda nodded. “You don’t feel yourself anymore. You feel you want things you shouldn’t want. I heard you.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, unsure what was meant by that. Unsure how Wanda could still smile at her so tenderly even when her eyes were shimmering with unshed tears.</p><p>“I'm going to ask you a really big favour now,” Wanda said, “and I think you'll do it because you care about our friendship as much as I do.”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“I want you to please resolve whatever has you stuck on your wife.”</p><p>“Ex-wife.”</p><p>“Tell that to the hand-fasting tattoos that glow a blinding light whenever you two stare at each other.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart jolted and she averted her gaze, but didn't deny it. Couldn’t deny it when the evidence was there for every witch to see.</p><p>“I'm not asking you to do this with the expectation that you'll choose me in the end. I'm not saying I'm gonna be all happy about it or that I’ll wait around until a resolution is reached. I might possibly attack Rio at some point and we’ll end up killing each other.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Trust me, hon. The only one in danger here of getting killed by either of you, is me.”</p><p>Wanda smiled softly. “I talked your ear off about Vis for years and you listened and supported me through it. That helped me to keep a place for him in my heart and still be strong enough to move on. I mourned Billy and Tommy, and you confided in me about Nicky. I know his favourite colour was purple like your magic, and that he was the one who wrote the original Ballad. I know of the time he accidentally rolled off the bed and you cried louder than he did.” She chuckled when Agatha cringed at the memory. “But I didn't even know Rio’s name, Agatha. And I remember asking you about her and you would just clamp up as though in pain and for a while I thought maybe she’d been abusive—</p><p>“No. Never.”</p><p>Wanda sighed. “You need to go deal with whatever you two didn’t deal with back then. I’ll be right here and support you while you do. Not for us to be together. Not to be good. But because you are my best friend and I need you to be happy, like you have helped me become a happier person these last few years. Maybe you’ll discover what it is that’s feeling off for you at the moment.”</p><p>Agatha doubted Rio would listen to a word she had to say. Not that she could say anything that would change the way they’d left things.</p><p>“I love you,” she whispered. It sounded like manipulation, but it was the only truth she felt confident in telling Wanda in that moment. “And I’ll try.”</p><p>Wanda smiled sadly. “I love you, too.”</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Squished into the minivan they’d bought for road trips—heading to New York to get drunk and dance—the coven had to magic their way past multiple roadblocks monitoring traffic in and out of Westview. When Alice pulled up to the suburban home in Eastview, Agatha turned in the front seat to look at a pouting Billy behind her.</p><p>“Here’s your stop, kid.”</p><p>He looked hurt more than disappointed. Agatha knew he had some insecurities over his lack of magic, but they were heading to an unknown house for an unknown reason and Rio had assembled her Legion which meant the threat was real and dangerous, so Agatha needed him to stay safe.</p><p>“I could wait in the car and be the getaway driver,” Billy suggested.</p><p>“You could, or you could stay here and spend time with your parents who you barely see anymore, before you go off to college.”</p><p>“They told me to go and enjoy my summer.”</p><p>Everyone was quiet, not offering any input, despite agreeing with her.</p><p>“Do you know what I was doing at your age?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Walking barefoot in the snow for five miles to get to school?”</p><p>Agatha smiled sharply. “Killing my entire coven. Including my mother, who tried to kill me when I didn’t turn out to be who she wanted me to be.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>The tension in the van grew thick. Only Wanda’s soft gaze was still on Agatha after that statement. It wasn’t new information to anyone, but Agatha liked to mention it on occasion and bask in the awkwardness that followed.</p><p>There had been a time where Agatha’s relationship with her mother had been good. Back when Agatha had been perceived as good. Back when she'd bent herself over backwards to be someone her mother could show off like one of her prised roses. Perfectly cultivated. William Kaplan had only ever experienced unconditional love. Hadn’t ever needed to try and be someone he wasn’t. And Agatha hoped with all of her heart that he would never need to.</p><p>“We want you around, Billy.” She softened her tone. “You’re a member of this coven, but for the love of god, go be with your family while they no doubt stare at the news and wonder where you are and if you’re safe. We’ll come pick you up when we’re back. All right?”</p><p>Billy sighed and shifted forward, placing a kiss on her cheek. “Love you.”</p><p>“Love you too, handsome,” Agatha murmured. “Tell your hot mom I said hi.”</p><p>He snorted a chuckle even as he tried to glare at her and Agatha settled back in her seat and watched him until he was inside.</p><p>When the front door shut, they all raised their hands, palms up, and Alice softly chanted a protection spell around the Kaplan home.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>They made it to Long Island before noon taking the I-95. Jen and Lilia napped for most of the journey, but woke when they reached Hempstead. Billy, bless him, had used Google Maps’ street viewer to find their destination. The village was small, and not many streets went up to 169, so it hadn’t taken long for Lilia to identify the house she’d seen in her vision.</p><p>“What now?” Jen asked when they were very conspicuously parked across the street.</p><p>Agatha shrugged, eyes darting across the Victorian home painted a charcoal grey with ivory highlights, standing out amongst a row of identical brownstones, like it didn’t quite belong. She tapped in the address and it didn’t seem to be a heritage site, so remarkable really to not have been turned into a bland piece of real estate by an HOA in the name of modern conformity.</p><p>“We should go in,” Lilia said.</p><p>“I’ll go in,” Agatha countered. “You guys wait here.”</p><p>They all huffed and rolled their eyes and exited the van with her.</p><p><em>‘What was that you said about them trusting me?</em>’ Agatha asked Wanda.</p><p>
<em>‘They trust you to not ask for help when you need it.’</em>
</p><p>Agatha sighed, smoothed down the marvellous dusty-blue coat she’d dressed in that morning. Her hair pinned up, and her locket resting against the crisp white shirt that covered her chest. Her coven had all verbalised their appreciation of the outfit. Jen had tried to upstage her dressed in pink from head to toe like cotton candy, and fine, she looked good, but Agatha was convinced she’d won that round. It helped to get her out of her emotional funk and feel confident enough to go find out whatever Lilia’s visions wanted them to know.</p><p>A few feet up the pathway she paused at the gentle tug at her heart, and groaned.</p><p>“What?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Rio just got here.”</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda said. “Guess we’re at the right place, then.” She lifted a brow at Agatha and motioned for her to lead the way.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Agatha entered the house through the unlocked front door and came to a grinding halt. Vaguely aware of the door being closed, and the others swearing at her for blocking the way, shuffling passed to flank her.</p><p>They stood in a large foyer with a high ceiling, the most notable feature a grandiose crystal chandelier. Previously the most notable feature actually as Rio currently levitated beside it seemingly affixing a light bulb. Seemingly affixing a light bulb in a black strapless sheath dress. A formal strapless sheath dress with a long slit where a black lace garter belt held up by dainty suspenders was peeking out.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, taking in the dark red lipstick, Rio’s hair elegantly pinned at her nape, glittering diamonds in her ears and around her elegant neck, and long silky gloves coming up over her elbows. She looked gorgeous and Agatha absently unbuttoned her coat with one hand.</p><p>She missed playing dress-up with Rio. They always had a grand time. She had to actively suppress the urge to change into a 1950’s style tuxedo.</p><p>Rio’s stilettos hit the hardwood floor, probably damaging it, but she didn’t seem to care as she drew an ugly rug from thin air and laid it below the chandelier.</p><p>“Pazyryk rug. St. Petersburg,” Alice whispered, eyes trained on Rio’s ass when she bent over and straightened out the tattered rug.</p><p>Rio heard her, because of course she did, smirking to herself and straightened, an opera-length, ivory cigarette holder appeared in her gloved hand, the mouthpiece pressed between her teeth. Rio slyly grinned around it as her dark gaze drank Agatha in.</p><p>Agatha stood taller at the appreciative look her outfit garnered, pleased at the wardrobe choices she’d made at three in the morning, unable to sleep.</p><p>Rio sauntered closer, straight toward her. “Hello, Agatha’s Coven,” she said, not looking at anyone other than Agatha. Heedless of the awkwardly mumbled greetings that were returned.</p><p>“Darling,” Rio purred in a deep southern accent, wrist going to her forehead, and it was pure muscle memory that drove Agatha to catch Rio as she feigned delicately fainting in her arms. Rich brown eyes darkened when Agatha kept her bent in a low dip, a hand lightly gripped the back of Rio’s stocking covered knee and slid upward to brush across the lace before lightly tugging a thumb beneath a thin suspender, palm curling around a warm thigh.</p><p>Rio ran her tongue across her teeth. “Did I trip? Did I stumble—lose my balance, graze my knee, graze my heart?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, staring at the chords straining in Rio’s exquisite neck, before she lifted her upright, Rio’s arms falling around her shoulders with practised ease. Gazing at Agatha as though she would devour her on the spot. Agatha had been gone the second she’d seen Rio in that dress. She had no defences in place against a silly-sexy Rio combo.</p><p>Thankfully, someone cleared their throat. Possibly Lilia. Agatha woke from her stupor, face on fire, her stomach and chest too. Rio poked her tongue to the inside of her cheek, staring at Agatha’s mouth, then mercifully stepped back and out of Agatha’s hands possessively gripping her hips.</p><p><em>‘Sorry about that,’ </em>Agatha said to Wanda, unable to look at her.</p><p>Wanda didn’t reply.</p><p> “So wonderful to see you all again. And so soon!” Rio smiled warmly at them. “Now, please leave.” She motioned grandly to the front door, then lithely twirled on her heels. The Ife Head stolen from the British Museum appeared in her hands that she placed on a Burmese carved elephant side table, dead centre and facing an identical head and table on the opposite side. She then headed out of the entrance hall and further into the house.</p><p>Agatha pushed a hand into her pocket while her gaze followed Rio all the way out. She then rocked on her heels and lifted her brows when she felt the heavy stares on her.</p><p>“Well,” she said, when no one else said anything. “Time to leave. <em>Vamanos</em>!”</p><p>She spun around to the front door.</p><p>Nobody moved.</p><p>Agatha shut her eyes, fingers curled on the ornate brass handle. She sighed, turned, and walked in the direction Rio had gone, finding her in the kitchen where she placed the stolen <em>hishaku</em> beside a Sen no Rikyū tea set, carefully lining it up beside the tray.</p><p>“So…” Agatha said. “Are you moving in?”</p><p>“No.” Rio deadpanned and stalked out of the room.</p><p>Agatha trailed after her, deciding to enjoy the view while she allowed enough time to pass for the coven to think she tried and then be more willing to leave.</p><p>“Still a pervert I see,” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha smirked and followed her to a baroque style bedroom, all dark burgundy and rosewood. Rio gracefully stepped onto the mattress and mounted Van Gogh’s Starry Night above the bed. Spending a long moment straightening it to perfectly align with the headboard. She then walked back to where Agatha leaned against the door frame.</p><p>“Agatha, if you continue to stalk me, I will call the police,” Rio drawled and brushed passed her. Agatha impulsively inhaled, all but floating after her where the pilfered Sophilos Vase was placed on a mahogany Edwardian side table. Rio turned it carefully until the Fates, Graces and Muses were facing to the front.</p><p>“You're currently on every Most Wanted list in the world,” Agatha said, consumed by curiosity as to what Rio was up to. “So I’m certain they'll be happy to hear from you.”</p><p>“What do you want, Agatha?”</p><p>“Just supervising the coven while they’re investigating you.”</p><p>“I would prefer they stop.”</p><p>“I have requested multiple times that they do.”</p><p>“They think I'm the threat.” A statement, but Agatha still nodded. “Seriously, you can’t be here.”</p><p>“Okay, just let them feel like they did something today. Then we'll go.”</p><p>Rio placed the Rosetta Stone at the top of the staircase, adjusting it so the <em>stele</em> stood perfectly centre of the landing.</p><p>“Wanda and I aren’t together.”</p><p>“So just fucking her then,” Rio blandly said. “She’s pretty. Could destroy the entire universe if you break her heart, so making sound choices as always, Agatha. We both know what you do to the people who love you when things don’t go your way.”</p><p>“Spare me the lecture. I know who I was—who I am. I guess…”</p><p>“A dirty cheater is what you are,” Rio said. “Since my creator married us, we’ll need to go see them if you want a divorce. You’ve already rendered our vows meaningless.”</p><p>“I didn’t ask for a divorce,” Agatha said, heart in her throat. “Do you want one? And I’ve never met your creator. Your brother married us. ”</p><p>Rio stiffened. “Yes he did. I misspoke.”</p><p>It was an odd mistake for Rio to make, but the divorce talk was making her queasy so Agatha decided not to focus on that. “How is your brother anyway?”</p><p>“Dead.”</p><p>“Your sister?”</p><p>“Dead.”</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>“Yes. I'm the only member left of the Living Tribunal.”</p><p>“So that’s what all of this is about.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I'm sorry, Rio. I know you were close with them.”</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>“You still can’t die, right? That hasn’t changed?”</p><p>“No, I get to live forever and watch everyone I love die over and over again.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly, clutching her locket. “Rio—</p><p>Rio was suddenly too close to her, up in her space. “I want you to stop talking and <em>leave</em>, Agatha. I don’t want anything from you. I don’t want you near me. I don’t want you to halfheartedly tell me how you’re not in a relationship with the woman you’re fucking. I don’t care.”</p><p>“You don’t care?”</p><p>“I don’t care if you go on another two hundred year fuckfest around the world. You won’t ever get me out of your system. You will <em>never</em> be able to erase what we are to each other. But if you continue to flaunt it in my face, I <em>will</em> fucking kill you.”</p><p>Agatha slowly smirked, closed the inch left between them to press her body against Rio’s. Eyes hooded as she stared at Rio’s blood red lips. “God, I missed you...”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, trying to hide a smile as she placed her fingers against Agatha’s sternum and pushed her away.</p><p>Agatha licked her lips, but stepped back, trying to ignore the warmth that spread where Rio had touched her. “I’m not flaunting anything.”</p><p>“You’re literally stalking me with your fuckbuddy.”</p><p>“Rio, come on—</p><p>The lights around the house flickered and for a moment Agatha thought it was Lilia’s magic, but she didn’t feel Lilia casting and then Rio swore under her breath and disappeared.</p><p>“What did you do!” Rio’s angry voice sounded from somewhere below.</p><p>Agatha teleported to the foyer then ran toward the opulent living area where the coven defensively grouped together, staring down a furious looking Rio.</p><p>“Who lights a fucking fireplace during summer!” Rio shouted.</p><p>Baffled, Agatha walked forward, standing in between Rio and her coven, tilting her head at her friends.</p><p>“What did you do?” she directed at them, gaze trained on the fear in Rio’s eyes, the tension in her shoulders.</p><p>As though feeling exposed, a dark cloak formed across Rio’s body, a hood settling over her head. A familiar satchel was placed over her shoulder and protectively hugged to her body. It looked empty. Flat. But had done so even after Rio had placed those weird eggs inside of it.</p><p>“Hey, we’ll put out the fire,” Jen said, frowning whilst glaring. “Ali’s a bit of a pyromaniac when she gets bored.” She looked to Agatha. “We were just waiting around for you two to be done with whatever it was you were doing.”</p><p>“It’s already started,” Rio said, her knife appearing in her hand, clenched in a white knuckled grip. “I can’t stop it or move you now.”</p><p>Everything around them disappeared. The entire house gone. Vanishing so abruptly that it took everyone a moment to register that they now stood on a smooth flat platform surrounded by glittering stars and brilliant galaxies, as though they were in space.</p><p>Behind Rio, casting her in a silhouette, a large blue moon illuminated them. Unnervingly close.</p><p>“This is all your fault,” Rio told Agatha and then the platform vanished too.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach bottomed out and then she was falling, the coven’s screams filling her head, everything around her a void of endless nothingness, even though her eyes were opened wide and terrified.</p>

<p>They fell for minutes that felt like hours, screaming until their voices grew hoarse. A million thoughts rushed through Agatha’s mind, and yet all she could focus on was the worry of what it would mean should they finally hit the ground after such a long fall. Would this be how she lost them? Because she wasn’t more insistent that they heed Rio’s warnings?</p><p>Rio was right. This was all her fault. Somehow the witch-killer had managed to wipe-out yet another coven.</p><p><em>‘When you’re all quite done,’</em> Rio’s voice rumbled in their heads cutting off the screams. <em>‘Kindly remember that you’re witches and stop falling.’</em></p><p>Delirious with relief, Agatha laughed, purple lighting up below green glowing wrists as she cast the flying spell. The others followed as twin balls of yellow, red, orange, and pink joined her. They grouped together using the colourful light of their magic as their bodies remained eerily swallowed by the void.</p><p>“Good,” Rio said out loud.</p><p>A lantern appeared in her hand, illuminating them in a green glow, and they all became visible. Agatha’s hair had somehow sprung loose from confinement and she ran a hand through it trying to calm her rapid breaths. Everyone looked a little haggard. Jen and Alice were mid embrace, pressing soft kisses to each other’s faces and everyone discreetly looked away. Agatha leaned into the hug when Lilia wrapped an arm around her waist and gave it a little squeeze. </p><p>After allowing them a moment to settle their heart rates, Rio spoke again. “Stay in my light.”</p><p>Everyone turned their attention to her, intently listening, noticing her seemingly standing on some invisible path. Wanda was the first to land on it.</p><p>“It’s best you conserve your magic,” Rio said, nodding at Wanda in approval and everyone else followed, shakily landing on nothing but air. It felt solid, like a linoleum surface, and because they couldn’t see anything, was extremely disorientating.</p><p>“I’ll keep the road up until we reach our destination.” Rio then turned and headed into the dark void.</p><p>Alice and Jen behind her, Lilia behind them, and Wanda fell into step beside Agatha who brushed the back of their hands together. Relieved that everyone was alive and unharmed.</p><p>“Where, exactly, is our destination?” Agatha hoarsely asked.</p><p>“The Far Shore,” Rio said in a tone that told Agatha she was still angry they were there at all and she decided to hold her questions until they were in a safer place.</p><p>Thankfully, everyone else seemed to agree.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>They walked for hours. Nothing but void around them. And then Alice started humming an all too familiar tune. Jen and Lilia joined in on the opening verse of the Ballad of the Witches’ Road and Wanda reached out to take Agatha’s hand.</p><p>The coven had their first bonding experience breaking a generational curse on Alice. Her mother’s version had acted as a spell to prevent the curse from taking complete hold of her daughter.</p><p> They knew that Agatha had made up the Road. Knew the Ballad was how she’d tricked hundreds of witches out of their magic and their lives. It had become somewhat of an inside joke. But none save Wanda was aware of the shame that plagued Agatha. Not because of the witches she’d killed, but because she’d used her son’s song to aid her in doing so. And because it held such emotional significance to Alice too, Agatha never said anything.</p><p>“Stop,” Rio's gruff whisper reverberated around them and they instantly fell silent and stilled when Rio stopped walking.</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio’s rigid back. Could feel the others looking to her for guidance, probably afraid they were going to be left behind in the void.</p><p>Rio started walking again and the coven released a breath, moving in tandem to keep pace with her.</p><p>“Sorry, Rio,” Alice said.</p><p>“You may talk, you may hum, you may sing. Just not that song,” Rio softly said. “Sorry for overreacting.”</p><p>“No, it’s cool,” Alice mumbled. “You’re cool…”</p><p>No one talked or hummed or sang though, only kept their eyes on Rio, following her for hours on end until their bodies ached and their throats were parched. Not a complaint was voiced and a collective sigh of relief was released when they stepped onto a solid rocky surface.</p><p>The area they entered looked like a massive cave. Agatha nearly moaned when her straining muscles finally relaxed, releasing the tension held in fear of being swallowed by the void. Green light filled the cavern that was about fifty feet high and seventy across, revealing jagged edges on the sides. Ahead, a solid arch was carved into stone, shaped like a doorway with various runes chiselled across its smooth surface, though without a handle or any slits to show it could be entered through.</p><p>Perhaps because of the sudden uneven ground, Jen took a step and tripped, crying out in pain, and Alice caught her before she could face plant.</p><p>“Shit.” Jen sucked in a sharp breath through her teeth, limping in Alice’s arms, who carefully assisted her to the side of the cave to sit on a small boulder.</p><p>The coven gathered around her in concern, but it was Rio who moved forward her lantern left to hang from a metal hook—that hadn’t been there before—beside the arch, still illuminating the entire cavern.</p><p>Rio knelt down in front of Jen and everyone tensed.</p><p>“May I?” she asked, staring up at Jen through her long dark lashes and Agatha’s jaw clenched when Jen all but swooned and mutely nodded.</p><p>Rio carefully removed one of Jen’s ridiculous heels and someone gasped at the blisters littering her feet.</p><p>“You’re bleeding,” Alice croaked, kneeling beside Jen who continued to stare at Rio gently holding her ankle.</p><p>Jen hadn’t complained once during their hours long walk.</p><p>“You should’ve said,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Jen scoffed. “And what? Take a break over absolute nothingness? No thanks.”</p><p>“May I use my magic on you?” Rio asked, examining the damage.</p><p>Jen looked to Agatha, who stiffly nodded, then softly gave her permission.</p><p>The second Rio’s fingers touched her skin, Jen let out a long languid moan, head lolling back, and Agatha’s stomach clenched in memory of how good Rio could make her healing feel. Now Jen was feeling all the good stuff, while Agatha wanted to murder someone. Mostly Rio, because there was really no need for all of that.</p><p>“All good?” Rio husked.</p><p>Jen’s chest heaved as she sheepishly smiled down at her. “Uh, yeah. Thanks.”</p><p>Rio nodded and got to her feet. <em>‘I’m going to revenge fuck your entire coven,’ </em>she snarled into Agatha’s head, then said out loud, “I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere.” And vanished before a glowering Agatha could strangle her.</p><p>“Where does she think we would possibly go?” Lilia wondered, staring out into the abyss beyond the green light.</p><p>“If looks could kill,” Wanda muttered and Agatha realised she was glaring daggers at Jen still blissed out on the boulder, Alice beside her looking grumpy and confused.</p><p>“Uhm,” Jen said, finally noting Alice’s demeanour. “I could make some water?”</p><p>Everyone perked up at that.</p><p>“But…” She cast her spell, water gathering into a small sphere above her palm. “We don’t have anything to pour it into.”</p><p>“I’m not drinking from your hands,” Lilia said.</p><p>“The water doesn’t actually sprout from my body, you witch. Alchemy involves the transmutation of matter and laid the foundation for modern chemistry—</p><p>“I’ll make glasses,” Wanda said.</p><p>“And chairs,” Lilia said. “Add a table too.”</p><p>“Why do we need a table?”</p><p>“So I can rest my elbows on it.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes and a dining table, chairs, and glasses floated into existence.</p><p>“Even out the ground first, dear,” Lilia said. “I'm not tipping off a chair and breaking a limb, however orgasmic Rio’s healing magic appears to be.”</p><p>Wanda snorted, Jen’s eyes glazed over, and Alice and Agatha scowled.</p><p>Done with all of them, Agatha walked to a boulder on the other side of the cavern and sat down, summoned Scratchy into her lap, and longed for the mountains.</p><p>She hadn’t allowed herself to focus on the danger they were in. Rio had been insistent that they leave, and now they were there. They had a rule that Agatha wouldn’t ask about matters of the universe. Not because Rio didn’t want to tell her, but there were things that humans on her particular Earth weren’t meant to know about. That no mortal should know about. There were <em>rules </em>to follow.</p><p>Rio wouldn’t leave them there, would she? She’d left Agatha for two centuries, though. But why bother guiding them to solid ground only to abandon them thereafter?</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she spotted Alice reaching out to Rio’s green lantern.</p><p>“I wouldn’t touch that if I were you,” Agatha said, and Alice jumped back, raised her hands and eyebrows, and promptly made her way back to the others.</p><p>“Can you make food?” Jen asked Wanda who still had the furniture hovering in the air surrounded in a red glow. “I’m starving.”</p><p>“Yep. What would you like?”</p><p>“That doesn't seem quite right to consume,” Alice said.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Wanda frowned. “We're about to drink Jen's hand water.”</p><p>The other three remained dubious.</p><p>Wanda looked to her. “Agatha, where does my food magic come from?”</p><p>“Since there aren’t any ingredients laying about, it would come from the power of an evil eldritch god obsessed with black magic and world domination.”</p><p>Lilia hummed. “Definitely not kosher.”</p><p>“It's not hand water,” Jen muttered under her breath.</p><p>“I’m sorry I lit that fire guys,” Alice blurted.</p><p>Jen shook her head. “Yes, like you knew lighting a fireplace would lead to all of <em>this</em>.”</p><p>“I’m not going to apologise for having visions,” Lilia said. “Make a toilet too, Wanda dear.”</p><p>Alice shoulders relaxed. “Can’t believe I’m this thirsty while my bladder’s so full.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes and a red portable toilet appeared off to the side on the flattest surface around.</p><p>“Wow, like we’re at a concert,” Jen drawled, eyeing it with distaste.</p><p>“It’s perfect, Wanda,” Alice said, moving toward it but Lilia quickly bypassed her and entered.</p><p>Dragging her gaze from the now occupied port-a-potty, Alice sheepishly turned to Jen. “I wouldn’t mind drinking like that. Wanda might be a while.”</p><p>Wanda was studying the ground intently, appearing not to have heard her.</p><p>Jen’s lips parted when Alice took her wrist, mechanically casting the spell. Alice then bent at the waist and lapped at the water running across her fingers while Jen looked seconds away from spontaneously combusting.</p><p>Lilia exited with a relieved sigh, drying her hands on a sheet of paper towel, brow lifted in Alice and Jen’s direction.</p><p>“I don’t want to mess with the ground in case we start falling again!” Wanda groaned and covered her eyes with her hands the table and chairs wildly circling in the air above her.</p><p>“Good thinking,” Rio said, having appeared out of nowhere carrying multiple bags of takeout.</p><p>Everyone stilled and stared at her. Lilia with her hand on the port-a-potty door midway to closing it, Jen where she was stiffly holding her fingers out to Alice who remained bent, facing Rio as water splashed against her cheek, and Wanda who had subconsciously frozen all of her furniture in the air.</p><p>Only Scratchy moved. Leaping off Agatha’s lap, his body enveloped in shadowy purple as he flew thirty feet through the air. Rio carelessly dropped the food and caught him in her arms, grinning madly as she twirled him around.</p><p>“<em>Hola se</em><em>ñor</em>,” she murmured into his fur, everyone so still and quiet that it was easy to hear her. Scratch released a string of chittering noises, body wriggling in excitement.</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly.</p><p>At age five, Scratchy had been an excellent name to choose for a rabbit familiar. He’d only become <em>Se</em><em>ñor</em> Scratchy after they’d met Rio.</p><p>“<em>Yo tambi</em><em>én te extrañé, muchacho.</em>” Rio’s fond tone echoed through the silence. “<em>Lo s</em><em>é, lo sé, lo siento.</em>” She tenderly nuzzled his head, rubbed her cheek against his fur with her eyes closed.</p><p>She then paused, her eyes flashed open, blankly taking in everyone staring at her. “Let’s talk privately, <em>mijo</em>,” she said, turned her back to them, sat criss-cross on the ground, where a dome of rock covered them instantly.</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio's rocky dome, aching all over. Feeling the burn of eyes on her, she looked up into Wanda's soft gaze.</p><p>“Uhm,” Alice said. “Do you think the food’s for us?” she asked Agatha who shrugged and motioned for her to grab it. Not like Rio needed to eat, so she’d most likely gotten it for them.</p><p>The table and chairs were placed onto the wobbly ground and Wanda added plates and cutlery.</p><p>“Sit down and enjoy your last supper, children,” Lilia drawled. “Good thing we have a table.” She pointedly stared at Wanda who chuckled while she opened a can of soda and had to cover it with her palm to stop the fizz spraying out.</p><p>The coven settled around the table, packing out food, quiet in their ravenous hunger, until Jen gasped, lifting a shoebox containing a pair of pink Balenciaga sneakers that perfectly matched the colour of her outfit.</p><p>“I’m going to marry that witch,” Jen said, sounding close to tears as she magically cleaned her feet, slid on the socks, and then slipped her feet into the ridiculous shoes with a contented groan.</p><p> Agatha remained on her boulder and stared at the rock Scratch and Rio were entombed in. Rio had always been generous and attentive. She was good at picking up on Agatha’s moods and guessing what she might need when Agatha hadn’t even known herself. Rio’s ability to be an absolute menace with sociopathic tendencies only added to the fact that she’d been the perfect wife.</p><p>“Come eat, Agatha,” Lilia said.</p><p>Agatha wasn't hungry, but everyone was staring at her with concern, so she got up and joined them at the table.</p><p>Rio had gotten a lot of different options. Chinese, Mexican, fried chicken with salads, burgers, and fries. There was even a container of what used to be sushi yet had been jostled apart when Rio had dropped the bags. It didn’t stop Jen from unwrapping a set of chopsticks and digging in.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted, but she placed a fry into her mouth after Wanda pushed a plate of food in front of her. They were probably going to need their energy for whatever was coming next.</p><p>“I don't think I've ever heard Señor Scratchy make those noises before,” Alice carefully said.</p><p>“They’ve always been close,” Agatha murmured, staring unseeing at her plate. Then smiled to herself. “They both like hissing at people.”</p><p>Everyone chuckled, focused on shovelling food into their mouths and drifted off into their own thoughts.</p><p>“Does he talk to you too, or was she just messing around?” Alice asked, apparently unwilling to be left to her thoughts.</p><p>“They have conversations. I talk to him, and he communicates telepathically by showing me images if needs be.”</p><p>“And we’re not going to talk about where she went and why she couldn’t take us with her? Or why she can teleport and we can’t?” Jen asked.</p><p>Everyone held their breaths, staring expectantly.</p><p>“No,” Agatha absently said and pressed a fry against the cheeseburger on her plate, swirling ketchup over the bun. Rio and Scratch liked to hiss at people who got too close to Agatha in particular. Possessive of her time and attention. And now they were off in their rock, probably talking about how awful Agatha was for keeping them apart.</p><p>“Why don't any of you have familiars?” Wanda thankfully drew the attention away from Agatha, who had shifted her gaze back to the rock dome.</p><p>“When I was a novice,” Lilia said, “It was believed that only the strongest witches had a familiar. A little sentient being that doesn't protect you or make you stronger. Just something exclusive, like a designer purse.”</p><p>“Or like a pet?” Alice offered.</p><p>“That you don't technically need to feed or clean up after,” Lilia said. “But yes, similar. More like a companion. But they’ve become less popular because of their lack of functionality. They were always only a status symbol.”</p><p>“I'd still like to see if I can get one,” Alice murmured.</p><p>“Sure. It’s a rather difficult spell to cast. You’re essentially pulling a being from a different dimension.  But we can see if we can get you a familiar once we’re home.”</p><p>Everyone grew quiet again after the mention of home. Quietly eating.</p><p>“I always thought we didn't cover it because Agatha was worried I’d summon a demon or something,” Wanda piped up, lightening the heavy mood.</p><p>“You'd definitely have like a Cocker Spaniel,” Jen told her.</p><p>Alice chuckled. “Lilia would have a canary.”</p><p>“Jen would have a pure white ferret,” Wanda said thoughtfully.</p><p>“Agatha never struck me as the bunny type,” Lilia said.</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha snapped from her thoughts long enough to be affronted. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>They all burst out laughing but stopped when the rocky dome crumbled apart.</p><p>Rio emerged without Scratch, but Agatha could feel he was back in his pocket dimension where he remained until she summoned him.</p><p>“Ready to continue?” Rio asked.</p><p>A round of cleared throats and the rustling of empty containers being packed into bags followed and Rio interpreted that as a yes. There were a few visits to the portable toilet while Rio went to the arch and pulled her dagger, drawing patterns into the air until the arch glowed, shimmering white like the moon shining on the rippling surface of a lake.</p><p>They tentatively walked up to Rio, glancing at her warily.</p><p>“On the other side there will be a room. Wait there. Don’t touch anything.” She looked at Alice who hung her head in shame. Jen placed an arm around Alice’s shoulders and they followed Lilia through the portal muttering soft thank you’s for the food and shoes as they passed.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop staring at Rio.</p><p>Wanda awkwardly glanced between them and took a step toward the Gate.</p><p>“This is how you destroy the universe, Scarlet Witch,” Rio said and Wanda froze, turning to face her.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Rio nodded in the direction of the table and chairs.</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Seriously, Rio?”</p><p>“Witches draw and convert energy from their environments. They summon objects from other locations or take what already exists and mould it into what they want to conjure.” Rio’s expression was earnest rather than scolding so Agatha didn’t interrupt again. “You <em>think</em> matter into existence. Manifest it from nothing. Additional matter that shouldn’t exist. And when it accumulates, it threatens to displace and disrupt. It forces an imbalance.”</p><p>“Oh,” Wanda breathed. “I understand.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>“So what do I do? Just not ever conjure anything again? Would that help?”</p><p>“You start by cleaning up after yourself.”</p><p>Wanda flushed darkly, sheepishly waved her hand, and the table, chairs and toilet dissolved as though they were never there.</p><p>“Like that?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What other parts of my magic aren’t safe?”</p><p>“Your entire existence is unsafe. This magic wasn’t meant for you.”</p><p>“Not like she stole it, Rio,” Agatha carefully said, not wanting to escalate the situation.</p><p>“She wasn't meant to wield it, which makes it difficult for her to control it.”</p><p>“She’s gotten good at her control.”</p><p>“Your magic is linked to your emotions. There's always a chance that it would feed on that, which in turn intensifies those emotions trapping you in a spiralling cycle you can’t escape. A heightened state that would make you less careful and more likely to destroy yourself and everything around you. But yes, in terms of lessening the chance of you collapsing the universe in on itself, continue to practice your control with Agatha. Be especially careful with your reality-altering magic. And if circumstances force you to use it, be sure to correct whatever you changed when your done.”</p><p>Wanda smiled softly. “That sort of makes me feel better. Thanks, Rio,” she sincerely said, and hurriedly stepped through the Gate.</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio, whose gaze grew hard when their eyes met and a wicked smile spread across her face. “I’m going to revenge fuck <em>her</em> twice,” Rio said and stalked through the Gate.</p><p>Agatha huffed and marched after her through the Gate and stepped into a dusty room. It had crumbling clay walls and large holes in the ceiling that showed a pitch-black sky. Agatha’s magic crackled in her veins, buzzing like it hadn’t in a long time, readying for a fight.</p><p>There was no way Rio would fuck her coven… But Rio could be extremely charming when she wanted to be. Even when she didn’t mean it, there was still the matter of her face that gave her a clear advantage. She might just be angry enough to make an actual attempt.</p><p>There was a time where Agatha couldn’t imagine Rio wanting anyone other than her. When Rio had made her feel secure enough to not even consider that she would touch another woman, despite the games they’d play to make each other jealous. Even then Agatha’s rage had mostly been directed to the other parties showing interest, not Rio. The intensely possessive sex that often followed, had been about reaffirming a claim and revelling in belonging to one another.</p><p>“It wasn’t <em>cheating</em>,” Agatha said through clenched teeth, and everyone turned to look at her while she glared at Rio.</p><p>“Time and Space work differently in the Outside,” Rio addressed the coven, dismissing Agatha entirely. “There are things I can and can't do depending on where I am and where I want to go. The path to our destination isn't linear. Time isn't linear. For most, the vast extent of the cosmos is unfathomable. Understanding the remnants of all cosmos past is near impossible to master.”</p><p>“Do you study the cosmos?” Alice asked, eyes awkwardly darting between Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“I know a little,” Rio said and motioned to a set of sandstone doors. “Through there, waits the Chaos King who guards a Gate to the Beyond. Once through, I’ll be able to summon Gates at will and speed up our journey.”</p><p>“And you can’t summon a Gate now because Time and Space work differently here?” Jen said.</p><p>“Yes. The rules are different. Sometimes there aren’t any rules, sometimes there are very specific ones. I could leave earlier, because I used my lantern as a tether for my return to that exact spot. Had I taken you with me, you would have been pulled back instantly. There are very specific ways one must enter and exit the Outside.”</p><p>“And you know of an exit that we can safely use?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Many Travellers have entered the Outside and have been dead and lost here for aeons. I promise to guide you on the shortest path to a known exit. I only ask that you don’t annoy me on that journey, or I won’t hesitate to leave you behind. As you’ve seen, <em>I</em><em>’m</em> not stuck here.”</p><p>Everyone tensed.</p><p><em>‘She won’t leave us,</em>’ Agatha assured them through the link, still angrily glaring at the side of Rio’s gorgeous face.</p><p>Wanda smirked. <em>‘She won’t leave </em>you<em>.</em><em>’</em></p><p><em>‘Still good for us, I suppose,’</em> Lilia said.</p><p>“I’ll try to convince him to let you pass too,” Rio continued. “But he’s a bored asshole, and is probably itching for a fight.”</p><p>She walked toward the stone double doors that swung open on their own accord revealing a Colosseum style arena. Above it, the sky was pitch black and held no stars. Pieces of rock debris floated in the air, but not much else. No light source was noticeable, yet the clay arena seemed to be lit up as though it was day time.</p><p>“The entity that used to lend power to this void has absconded,” Rio said. “Taking a substantial amount of Amatsu-Mikabosh’s power with it. Leaving him less invincible than he once was.”</p><p>The coven instinctively moved closer to Rio, startling when the doors shut behind them. About four hundred feet away, at the other end of the circular arena, the Chaos King stood. Eighty feet tall, thin and long-limbed, body like liquid ink. Disproportionately large and sharp claws curled at his sides and two white swirling spots on his face mimicked eyes. His mouth spread wide to reveal multiple rows of shark-like teeth.</p><p>“Fall like cosmic leaves here at reality's end,” his deep baritone droned around the space, reverberating in their chests and heads. “Others have fought me. Countless gods from other worlds. Now they fight for me. All good things must end...So the greater thing can start: The Oblivion.”</p><p>“Charming,” Lilia muttered.</p><p>“I’ll go request safe passage,” Rio said and walked forward, barefoot, her hooded cloak covering that tight black outfit she’d worn on that first night with the meteorite.</p><p>“What the fuck, Agatha?” Jen whispered.</p><p>“Do I look like I know what’s going on?” she snapped, still brimming with silent rage at the idea of Rio having sex with anyone, let alone <em>Wanda</em>.</p><p>Jen clenched her jaw shut and they watched as Rio reached the Chaos King. She levitated off the ground and hovered near his inky black thighs, waiting. Grumbling, he lowered his slender, inky form onto one knee, his face more than double the length of Rio’s body, and appeared to bow to her.</p><p>“What the<em> fuck</em>,” Alice muttered, looking to Agatha then quickly away again.</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through her hair, pissed off that she was apparently the only source to explain everything Rio related. She could understand, but it didn’t stop it from being exceptionally frustrating when she was doubting whether she still knew Rio at all.</p><p>Rio abruptly appeared in front of them and hissed, causing everyone to startle in surprise.</p><p>“<em>Shit</em>,” Alice said, but Agatha’s angry glare had locked onto a chuckling Rio, and her fists clenched at her sides, magic gathering like a storm.</p><p>“He wants to fight.” Rio shrugged. “Just put on a good show and he’ll let you through after.”</p><p>“You don’t need to fight?” Alice asked.</p><p>“No,” Rio said, her gaze falling to Agatha’s fists, then her lips curled into a light grimace.</p><p>Agatha bristled, her magic swelling.</p><p>“Wanda,” Rio said, dragging her gaze from Agatha’s fingers to a surprised Wanda. “A word, please?”</p><p>“Uhm,” Wanda looked to Agatha. But when Rio’s hand hovered at her lower back, not touching, Wanda moved as though it was, allowing Rio to guide her away.</p><p>“Agatha,” Alice carefully said. “Buddy, I know it’s been rough, but you need to calm down.”</p><p>“Your eyes are glowing,” Jen said, taking a tentative step back.</p><p>Rio and Wanda softly spoke and then Wanda smiled sweetly at Rio, her eyes twinkling with warmth and the edges of Agatha’s vision grew darker, hazier, her entire body trembled with wavering restraint. Her ouroboros gleaming to match Rio’s who ignored their existence entirely to focus on Wanda.</p><p>The two of them returned to the group, looking comfortable side by side. Both attractive in a complimentary way. Rio lazily turned to Agatha, gaze lowering to her hands again, expression going blank.</p><p>“Maybe you should sit this one out,” Rio said. “Wanda will handle the Chaos King.”</p><p>Agatha’s magic surged, and she finally allowed it to break free. Her teeth bared in a snarl and she shot into the air, torpedoing toward the Chaos King who barked a laugh at her rapid approach, inky tendrils shooting out toward her.</p><p>Agatha dodged a few, others glanced off the shields she cast to meet them. Gathering her magic in her palms she blasted him back. Her purple ricocheted off his body, not making a scratch and Agatha screamed her frustration, continuing to blast and dodge, trying to release the heavy ache in her chest. The frustration at Rio just refusing to talk to her like they used to. Rio didn’t seem to care at all anymore and it had her heart feeling like a heavy jagged rock.</p><p>Chaos magic filled the air, fuelling Agatha’s rage, because Wanda was supposed to be her <em>friend. </em>Red edges formed around the Chaos King, like paper burning up. Agatha grinned maniacally and shot forward to where Wanda was opening the anti-magic barrier around him. When the opening was large enough, Agatha teleported into his body and submerged herself in a slimy void.</p><p>The world stilled, deadly silent, almost calming as warmth settled around her. Agatha gathered all of her magic, all of her rage and regret, and let it grow, feeding an ever-expanding purple sphere with everything she had to give, then blasted it outward. Exploding the Chaos King into a million pieces. Chunky black globs rained down across the arena floor.</p><p>Drenched in an oily gooey substance, hair wet and stuck to her face, Agatha hovered in the air above it, watching the puddles and chunks, and chuckled in delight. Her shoulders shook and she threw her head back, her laughter turning into a full blown cackle, arms raised as a wave of manic ecstasy washed over her. She hadn’t cackled in the longest time and it was cathartic to hear the sound bouncing off the stone walls, making her feel lighter.</p><p>The coven approached, Agatha could feel their magic, but her vision was still tunnelled and blurry as she stared at Rio, levitating a few yards away, watching her with a tender smile and soft awestruck eyes. The way she used to when Agatha had decimated covens and laid waste to entire armies just to impress her.</p><p>Agatha rapidly blinked at the fond expression. Tears stinging her eyes. The adrenaline faded and a wave of dizziness washed over her. The last dredges of her magic was consumed and Agatha dropped from the sky and into waiting arms.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” Wanda murmured, before Agatha lost consciousness.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke to the feeling of fingers carting through her hair and gently scratching her scalp. The chaos magic drowning her meant that it was Wanda’s lap her head was resting in as she laid on what felt like a bed of leaves on the ground.</p><p>Keeping her eyes closed, she checked in with her body and her magic, finding that she appeared fully recovered from draining herself in an idiotic jealous rage.</p><p>“The Beyond is the Second Cosmos?” She heard Alice’s voice, clear, but much further away from where she lay.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said, also further away. “There have been multiple cataclysms leading to the destruction of everything. We’re currently in the eighth iteration of the cosmos.”</p><p>“What kind of witch are you?” Alice asked.</p><p>Agatha smiled even before she heard Rio’s predictable answer. “I’m a Green Witch.”</p><p>“Do you have a coven?”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“That must be hard,” Alice said. “I was struggling a lot before Agatha found me.”</p><p>“It’s okay. My job keeps me pretty busy.”</p><p>“What do you do?”</p><p>“I usher the dead into the afterlife.”</p><p>“Oh, like a funeral director?”</p><p>“Similar field, I guess.”</p><p>“Do you like it?”</p><p>“Nope. I would rather be doing mukbangs on Twitch.”</p><p>Alice chuckled. “So do that.”</p><p>“I’m pretty specialised and hard to replace. So I can’t just resign.”</p><p>“At least try to do it as like a hobby or something to see if you like it.”</p><p>“Yeah, I think I will.” Rio’s voice was filled with genuine warmth at Alice’s suggestion and Agatha sighed. Her entire coven was going to let themselves get revenge-fucked without Rio even trying.</p><p><em>‘You’re awake,</em>’ Wanda said in her head.</p><p>Agatha softly hummed not opening her eyes as Wanda’s fingers kept threading her hair.</p><p>
<em>‘I get it now.’</em>
</p><p><em>‘Get what?’</em> Agatha asked.</p><p>
<em>‘Why you’re stuck on her. She has a quiet intensity. It’s extremely attractive.’</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flashed open. “Wanda, I swear to god, if you fuck my wi—</p><p>Wanda burst out laughing.</p><p><em>“She was worried you were feeling a little insecure without the Darkhold.”</em> She gave a pointed look and Agatha rolled her eyes because yes they both knew that was true. <em>“Said she was going to get you combat ready and that I should play along. And once you’re in the zone I should focus on getting the Chaos King’s barrier down. Pretty solid plan, though I don’t think she planned for you to literally give it everything you had.”</em></p><p>“Rio’s always been great at driving me completely insane.”</p><p>Wanda snorted and helped Agatha get up off the ground.</p><p>She stretched her stiff muscles and took in their surroundings.</p><p>They were in a glowing forest. The leaves on the thin trees a pretty light blue, softly luminescent. The trunks and stems of the plants were dark and shadowy. Looking up, the sky was that same pitch-black darkness, no stars in sight and through the branches, it appeared as though they were at the foot of a tall dark mountain that radiated that same baby blue at its peak as though something up there was glowing. Something large enough to cast the same ambient light of a full moon in a cloudy sky.</p><p>“We’re on a floating rock in endless dead space,” Wanda said, after watching Agatha get her bearings. “Rio cast a shield around us. Said we’d be safe inside it.”</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through her clean hair and across her pristine clothes, remembering she’d been covered in inky goo. “Thanks for cleaning me up.”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em> felt it very important that we do.”</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheeks and glared at the smug look on Wanda’s face, grateful when Jen came stomping toward them, overpriced sneakers crunching on the dead leaves that were a charcoal grey and surprisingly comfortable to lay on.</p><p>“Good, you’re finally awake,” Jen said. “Listen, I know you don’t want us asking any questions, but,” she pointed at the eerie mountain and lowered her voice, “what is she doing here? Why does she need to be here? Are we just caught up in whatever it is she’s doing? Are we <em>accomplices</em>?”</p><p>“She’ll get us home in the safest way she can,” Agatha said. “Like she said she would.”</p><p>Jen’s eyes narrowed. “Why did you two break up?”</p><p>“I asked her too many questions and she left me in a never-ending void of darkness.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “Fine. I get it.” She looked over her shoulder, at Rio and Alice still talking animatedly, having moved further away from the group. “I’ll go tell Alice to stop interrogating her.”</p><p>Agatha nodded firmly, happy that Jen was going to go break up whatever was happening over there. No doubt they were already planning on co-hosting a podcast after Rio revenge fucked Alice and they became best friends.</p><p>“I’ve been meaning to speak to you both privately,” Lilia said.</p><p>Agatha startled, having been so focused on Alice and Rio she hadn’t noticed Lilia walking up. “I have enough on my plate right now, Lilia.”</p><p>Lilia placed a hand on both her and Wanda’s backs, huddling them in, and lowered her voice. “I saw you,” she looked to Agatha, “fighting the Scarlet Witch.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze shifted to Wanda who looked about as nauseous as Agatha felt.</p><p>She chuckled weakly. “Didn’t know you saw the past too, Calderu.”</p><p>Lilia was worried enough to ignore her. “I’ll leave you two to talk about that. No, I didn’t see anything other than the two of you flying around and blasting magic at each other. Yes, she was in full costume with a solid crown.” She moved the hand on Wanda’s back to Wanda’s arm and lightly squeezed. “She didn’t seem like our Wanda at all. No, I don’t have any more information. No date or location. Do with that what you will.”</p><p>Lilia then walked away and left the two of them to process all of <em>that</em>.</p><p>Wanda stared at the forest bed, and Agatha shifted uncomfortably. “I don’t believe it.”</p><p>“What else could it be?”</p><p>“Maybe we’re practising.”</p><p>Wanda hummed, unconvinced.</p><p>“Red, you have her under control,” Agatha said and cupped her cheek. “There’s no doubt in my mind that whatever Lilia saw, it isn’t what it looked like.”</p><p>Still tense and uncertain, Wanda searched her eyes, seeming to find comfort in Agatha’s faith in her. And she <em>was</em> confident in the progress Wanda had made with her magic and that their friendship was strong enough that if they were fighting, it wasn’t with the intent to hurt each other.</p><p>Wanda drew her into a hug, lightly squeezed, then stepped away with a sigh. “Maybe it’s because I seduced your wi—</p><p>Agatha placed a hand over Wanda’s mouth, unable to stop the smile that spread at the sight of Wanda’s twinkling eyes. She could feel the teasing smirk against her palm and placed a quick kiss to the back of her own hand that made Wanda’s gaze soften. Eyes wrinkling at the corners.</p><p>“Watch it, hotstuff,” Agatha warned, winked, and then almost swallowed her tongue when a deafening screech sounded from the mountain top.</p><p>She dropped her hand from Wanda’s mouth and looked up to the zenith, seeing something gigantic and glowing baby blue like the leaves, moving up top.</p><p>“What in the hell is <em>that</em>?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Rio didn’t say what it was, only that it wouldn’t come down. It has ways to reach us from that range, but the shield will protect us. Apparently.”</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through her hair.</p><p>“What is she doing, Agatha? This place is dead. That thing freaks her out. Why would she come here when there isn’t anything else around for as far as the eye can see? Are we going to need to fight it as well?”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “I don’t know what Rio’s doing, but I trust that she’s doing it because she has to. I trust that she’ll get us out of here. That’s all I can say.”</p><p>“Are you worried? I know you know more than you let on.”</p><p>“Rio’s a pacifist. Well, she enjoys violence and chaos as much as the next girl, but doesn't really engage violently. Well, she and I do enjoy a scuffle now and then. And she does partake in a little torture when someone’s really pissed her off, but that's neither here nor—you know what, forget I said anything. Rio doing this means we need to take it seriously. And do what she says. And that will get us out of here. Simple as that, okay?”</p><p>“You haven’t seen her in two centuries and your trust in her hasn’t wavered at all. It’s sweet.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, searching Wanda’s face.</p><p>“Do you know what I've noticed?” Wanda continued thoughtfully. “Our friendship and our sex felt different. Separate.”</p><p>“And that's what’s going to make you turn into the Scarlet Witch?” Agatha grinned when Wanda chuckled and playfully smacked her arm. “Isn't it supposed to feel different, Red?”</p><p>“It feels like you’ve always kept them separate. A very distinct line you’ve never allowed yourself to cross. We have more intimacy during platonic moments than we did when we had sex.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“The sex was great. The best. Not even exaggerating. But it felt like sex. Like you were scratching an itch.”</p><p>Agatha flinched.</p><p>“I thought it was you setting boundaries for our friendship and I was having all of these non-platonic thoughts so I didn't say anything because we weren’t in a relationship and everything was great.”</p><p>“What are you getting at?”</p><p>“I think that you’re able to separate love and sex. Whereas I can’t. I know you love me as a friend and I’m realising that I projected a lot of my own feelings into something that was painfully one-sided from the start.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. She’d been so busy running from Wanda’s attempts at talking about the possibility of having a relationship that she hadn’t considered it as something that could actually happen. “I didn’t mean to make you feel used. I didn’t realise that’s how it was coming across.”</p><p>Wanda's lips parted and she lightly grasped Agatha's arm. “I don’t feel used, Agatha.”</p><p>“Then what are we talking about?”</p><p>“For my own sanity, I’m processing our relationship so I'm not left feeling hurt or angry at the end of this, and then unfairly lash out. Especially after hearing what Lilia just said. I have a responsibility to reflect on my emotions for the sake of everyone’s safety, so I’m sorry if this feels like I’m blindsiding you.”</p><p>“I’m listening.”</p><p>“I need to be careful with my heart. And I knew there was no romantic hope for us when I saw you looking at her when that meteorite fell away. I’ve never seen you look at anyone like that before…That doesn’t mean I’m belittling what we had. Just reassessing it. I still think we would have been very happy together if you ever opened yourself to the possibility. The problem is that it never felt like you were interested in having a relationship with anyone. You and Rio also appear obsessed with each other. A level of insanity I don’t think I would ever be able to match even if it wasn’t catastrophically dangerous for me to indulge in it.”</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>“I want you to be happy. Even if you decide it isn’t with her. You’re the best friend I’ve ever had and I  want to keep that. I’m pretty sure I need it more than I do a relationship. I don’t know where I would’ve ended up if I didn’t have you these past few years…Though I am open to one of those pacts where we vow to marry each other when we’re forty if we haven’t settled down by then.”</p><p>“I’m over three centuries old.”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “And also already married.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and locked their arms together, walking toward the little camp where a light blue fire was crackling and the coven had gathered around it.</p><p>“Thank you for talking to me about this,” she murmured. “I need you in my life too.”</p><p>Wanda smiled softly and moved away from Agatha’s light grasp when they reached the others.</p><p>Rio sat with her back against a log, listening to Lilia showing off her vampire bite she never shut up about, brown eyes warm and curious. Wanda went to sit beside Lilia and Rio looked toward Agatha as though everyone else had ceased to exist.</p><p>Agatha blocked out the conversation and awkwardly sat on the log beside Rio, whose gaze drifted across her as though to check that she was all right. They stared at each other for a long time, Agatha’s breath caught in her chest. Wanting to touch Rio. Cup her cheek. Wanting to ask her if she would like to take a walk. That was how Rio had started courting her once upon a time. Showing up at random and inviting Agatha on long walks, listening to everything she had to say as though Agatha wasn’t a young boring witch who’d barely begun to live her life and Rio wasn’t as old as time, and had already seen everything there was to see.</p><p>“Agatha.” She vaguely heard her name being called.</p><p>“What?” she said, only able to look to the others when Rio broke eye contact to look at Lilia.</p><p>Everyone was staring fondly at her and Agatha scowled at them.</p><p>Lilia smiled, amused. “Why don't you show us your battle scars?”</p><p>Agatha snorted and begun rolling up her shirt sleeve. She had plenty, but this was by far her most ridiculous one. “Well...” she said, smirking at Rio’s knowing chuckle. “Knitting needle to the elbow.” Everyone groaned in sympathy. “You ever hear of the Daughters of Liberty?”</p><p>A round of negative murmurs followed.</p><p>“<em>Exactly</em>.”</p><p>Everyone laughed and Agatha rolled her sleeve back down, but froze when Rio spoke up. “I've got a scar.”</p><p>“No, you don't,” she said, certain of that after having had her mouth and hands all over Rio’s flawless body. After having left countless marks and bruises that had been gone instantly or within hours depending on whether Rio wanted them there or not.</p><p>“Yes, I do,” Rio insisted, expression heavy and Agatha searched her face. Worried something awful had happened to Rio since she’d last seen her naked.</p><p>“A long time ago, I loved someone,” Rio said and Agatha’s heart stopped then gave a painful thud. “And I had to do something that I didn’t wanna do, even though it was my job. And it hurt them…She is my scar.”</p><p>Agatha could barely breathe at the reminder. Of waking up to Nicky’s still body in her arms. She’d resented that Rio had taken him during the night. Refused to understand that Rio didn’t determine when people died. Had expected Rio to somehow change more of the rules to allow her to have a proper goodbye. Had expected it even when she’d pushed Rio away and out of their home.</p><p>Centuries later and thinking of the night Nicky had died, still hurt so much.</p><p>“I'm gonna stretch my legs,” she hoarsely said, got up, and stalked away.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Agatha walked until she hit the familiar vibration of Rio’s shield and sat down on a fallen tree stump. She summoned Scratchy, holding him to her chest, and longed for the mountains.</p><p>How could Rio casually talk about divorce and still look at her like that? How could she say the things she said, as though she was filled with regret too, and yet seem to not want to speak to Agatha at all?</p><p>She glanced up at the crunching of leaves and then Jen was standing in front of her.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>“Obviously. Not sure why you’re here.”</p><p>“Well, you rushed off rather dramatically and then both Rio and Wanda got up to follow you and then comically froze in place when they noticed the other and just stood their staring at each other for an excruciatingly long time before both sat down again. I didn’t so much follow you as I escaped the awkwardness you left in your wake.”</p><p>Agatha rubbed her face and sighed. “I feel like I’m doing everything wrong regarding them.”</p><p>“Aw, poor baby. Two hot women want you. Might I suggest a throuple?”</p><p>Agatha laughed drily. “Rio and I have enjoyed simulacra of ourselves in our bed much like you’d add toys, or knives, ramps and ropes, depending on the mood, you know?” Jen’s eyebrows rose. “The thought of anyone touching her makes me physically ill. Wanda’s already bowed out of whatever was happening between us and I can’t say that I blame her. Because when it comes to committed relationships, all three of us are far too possessive to share.”</p><p>“Why did you and Rio break up, Agatha?”</p><p>“I hurt her. Blamed her for something that wasn’t her fault. I went on this forgiveness and acceptance journey with Wanda and realised I never had any reason to hate Rio to begin with. That I made the most awful thing to have ever happened to me far worse for no reason.”</p><p>“Have you told her you forgave her? That you don’t blame her anymore?”</p><p>“It’s been two hundred years, Jen. I told her to leave, she complied immediately, and never looked back. I don't think my forgiveness means anything to her anymore. And now it’s no longer us hating each other, just her, very fairly, hating me. You heard her. I’m her scar. Did my damage and she’s all healed up.”</p><p>“Do you want her back?”</p><p>“It feels like Wanda liked the me I am without the Darkhold, and Rio liked the me I was when I had the Darkhold. Even if Rio wanted me back, I don’t feel like I fit either of them at the moment.”</p><p>“Well, you don’t need to be with anyone, you do know that, right? Sometimes people are just friends and sometimes relationships end. They shouldn’t put that on you.”</p><p>“I don’t think either have it in them to force me into anything.”</p><p>“Well, despite all your <em>many</em> faults, you at least appear to have good taste in women,” Jen said and sat down on the log beside her, leaning their shoulders together. Agatha moved to wrap an arm around her but a hiss from Scratchy had Jen jumping out of reach.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They returned to everyone spread out on bedrolls, Rio having magnanimously decided that the coven needed to sleep. But, as Jen decided to snidely point out, Agatha had already taken a very long nap, so she was simply laying on her bedroll with her eyes closed, hyper-fixated on the knowledge that Rio didn’t need to sleep, and was therefore immediately aware when Rio got up from where she lay a bit further away, mercifully not revenge fucking anyone just yet.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Agatha asked, sitting up with a frown. Suspicious not that Rio was leaving, but that she didn't simply vanish like she usually would, seemingly attempting to poorly sneak away. In all fairness, she could’ve led a marching band through there as the coven were out like lights, all that walking through the void and fighting a god, having taken its toll.</p><p>“I’m gonna go get something. You stay here.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Agatha, you have to stay and protect your coven in case something goes wrong.”</p><p>“Why would anything go wrong? Can that thing up there hurt you?”</p><p>“No. It can banish me though, which would be really annoying.”</p><p>“Do your powers not work here?”</p><p>“Agatha, you need to stay here under the shield. If I’m banished, I’ll come get everyone. If we're both banished, I have no idea where you'll end up and if you’ll be able to survive there until I find you.”</p><p>“You said these things were weaker now.”</p><p>“The ones in the Far Shore are. Because the First Firmament took their power and left. This mountain is all that’s left of the Second Cosmos. <em>That</em> things’ domain.”</p><p>“After saying all of that you expect me to let you go alone? After catching you sneaking around like a novice witch not even able to teleport a few yards?”</p><p>“<em>Let </em>me? Since when do you have a problem letting me go?”</p><p>Agatha flinched. “This isn’t about us,” she hoarsely said. “It’s about helping you do what you need to do faster so you can get us home.”</p><p>“I’m only going to sneak in and out. Stay here and take your coven through the Gate if anything goes wrong.” She pointed to the shimmering Gate a few yards from their camp Rio must’ve summoned at some point as it hadn’t been there before. “I’ll meet you on the other side. Don’t go unless you need to. I created another safe room, but it’s for the best that I’m with you while you’re in it.”</p><p>“And if your banished while we wait here? How would we know?”</p><p>Rio groaned. “Why are we having an argument about this? I’m going, you’re staying. This was never a negotiation.”</p><p>“<em>We</em><em>’re</em> going. Wanda’s staying to protect everyone.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped to where Wanda had woken and sat up to watch them argue. She waved at Rio with a dull expression. “The sooner you two stop arguing and go get what you need, the sooner we can get out of here. I trust Agatha can handle herself.”</p><p>Rio straightened and blankly stared at Wanda for so long that Agatha stepped forward and placed a hand on Rio’s lower back and gently guided her away, through the shield, and they set off up the creepy shadowy path.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They walked in silence. Rio deep in thought. Agatha hyper-vigilant, her magic at the ready. That place was definitely affecting Rio’s power. If it wasn’t, she would’ve sent a simulacrum up the mountain while they all slept on unaware. That she hadn’t, meant that she couldn’t, and that had Agatha worried more than anything.</p><p>“Is that the appeal?” Rio softly asked. “She gives you your way without argument?”</p><p>“We argue plenty. Because she's my best friend. She was there when I needed her to be. I'm not saying this to hurt you. I just wasn't used to being able to count on people until her and the coven. I never needed people when I was with you. I don't think I need them now, but I have them. And I want them. They're like family and it feels nice.”</p><p>Rio hummed. “I’m happy you found them.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes, Agatha.”</p><p>“So you don’t hate me?”</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about us.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, unwilling to push Rio any further than she already had by inviting herself on this walk up a creepy mountain. “I can’t believe I’m going to die here and no one will know to water my roses.”</p><p>“I’m taking care of them,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha stared at her, her heart going soft. “Thank you, darling,” she breathed and smiled at Rio’s carefully impassive face and red tipped ears. “Why is your power messed up here?”</p><p>“Look around you,” Rio said, visibly relieved that Agatha didn’t comment further on her thoughtful gesture. “There’s no life and no death, the essence of my existence. The Outside is tricky to navigate, no matter how powerful one might be.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. Rio was connected to the natural order of all things, the reason it existed, so it made sense that where there was no life cycle, it would affect her. She technically was a Green Witch in that sense. The very first Green Witch.</p><p>They fell into companionable silence, Agatha simply enjoying being around Rio again.</p><p>When they neared the summit, Rio took the lead and slipped into a narrow crevasse instead of heading all the way to the peak. After about a hundred yards of crab walking, her back, hands, and ass chafing against the light blue rock, they finally entered a larger crevice, shining like the walls of a glacier, though warm to the touch.</p><p>They fell into step, shoulder-to-shoulder, and continued their walk. The black void sky loomed above and the crystalline walls reached up a quarter mile, brightly illuminating their path. Up ahead, perched over the crevice, was a cluster of light blue, glowing, oval-shaped objects. All stuck together, looking like a massive raspberry the size of a small cabin, perched on thick black webbing.</p><p>“Are those eggs?” Agatha softly asked when Rio came to a halt below the cluster and frowned up at it.</p><p>“Yes. It lays eggs and then eats them. It doesn’t need sustenance, only longs to consume. Such is its nature.”</p><p>Agatha shuddered, felt herself empathising with it, and shuddered again.</p><p>A deafening screech sounded and a gigantic spider leg stepped over the crevice, the same cool blue as everything else in that godforsaken place.</p><p>Never once in her life had Rio needed to physically protect Agatha against anything, and yet when Rio’s body covered her own, shielding her against the rocky wall, Agatha instinctively made herself smaller, tucking her face into Rio's neck, feeling instantly safe in the cocoon of roses.</p><p>She slipped her hands inside Rio's cloak. The fabric was magical, brushing against her skin like silky air, and she curled her fingers against the warm flesh in between the slits left bare by Rio's outfit.</p><p>Mechanically, desperately, Agatha placed her lips against Rio's neck and her stomach fluttered at the soft gasp against her ear.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Rio husked.</p><p>Agatha had no idea what she was doing. Her fingers mindlessly brushed across Rio's skin. She’d missed her so much that her body trembled with the weight of her longing. Overwhelmed at the prolonged proximity. At being able to physically feel Rio there as though reaffirming that she was real and back…</p><p>Rio's arms that bracketed her body, lowered, the muscles beneath Agatha’s fingers twitching deliciously. When Rio covered Agatha's fingers with her own they instinctively tightened their grip, but Agatha let go at the gentle tug, Rio moving her hands to pin them above Agatha’s head, her body following to press Agatha flush against the wall.</p><p>Agatha moaned, breathless and wanton. Heart slamming against her ribs. Entirely confused, yet tilted her head to the side when Rio’s teeth scraped her neck. She bit back another moan, vaguely aware that they were sneaking around a cosmic entity’s nest, and softly whined when a possessive bruise was sucked into her skin. Then another and another… The familiar firm grip around her wrists the only thing keeping her from sliding to her knees and pushing her face between Rio’s legs.</p><p>“Rio,” she mewled, rocking her hips against Rio’s sturdy frame. Dipping her chin to press her cheek to Rio’s head, desperately trying to reach her mouth so she could kiss her.</p><p>But Rio stayed focused on her neck. Slow, hot kisses were pressed against her jaw and Agatha trembled at the warm breath that blew across her ear.</p><p>“You taste like another woman’s pussy,” Rio lowly growled and stepped away, leaving Agatha feeling cold, her chest aching.</p><p>She helplessly lowered her arms, ducking her head so Rio wouldn’t see the burning tears that gathered in her eyes. An easy deception, since Rio’s focus remained on the eggs, like she didn’t want to see Agatha right then. Her pretty brown eyes skimmed the wall, calculating, and then Rio leapt upward, her nails digging into solid crystalline rock. She paused briefly, glancing up, and then began her vertical ascent, lithely climbing the wall like a cat going up a tree stump.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, fixated on Rio’s form. At the back of her mind she filed away that it appeared Rio couldn’t teleport in that realm, and possibly couldn’t fly or levitate either. But god was her alternative a feast for the eyes. The constant whiplash of emotions since seeing Rio again was a test to her sanity. Still, Agatha was grateful—hopeful—and continued to watch Rio as she gracefully vaulted onto the black webbing, lithely balancing on it as she made her way to the cluster to grab an egg.</p><p>It was the size of her torso, but she managed to fit it into the small flat leather satchel presumably containing the other eggs too. Then she just jumped down from the web, cloak fluttering and stunningly haloing her body as she dropped down, and silently landed in an elegant crouch in front of Agatha.</p><p>Something achy stirred in Agatha's belly. She had no defences in place against an agile-athletic Rio combo.</p><p> She was still pressed against the wall, longingly watching her when Rio looked up, her cheeks flushed as she poked her tongue into her cheek, heated gaze dragging across Agatha’s body. Remaining very still, Agatha contemplated positioning herself in a more alluring way. Rio’s hungry stare causing a throbbing ache between her thighs and she was certain she would die if Rio didn’t touch her.</p><p>She licked her lips, Rio’s eyes zeroing in on her tongue. Agatha’s hand stroked across her abdomen, her fingers trembling as Rio followed her every movement before taking a step toward her. Agatha’s stomach bottomed out and she leaned back against the wall, waiting, watching Rio’s approach through her lashes, the anticipation deliciously knotting in her lower belly.</p><p>A piercing screech sounded, and Rio halted, blinking rapidly. Agatha bit back a growl, magic sparking in her palms, ready to go kill that giant fucking spider thing for having the worst timing ever.</p><p>“We need to leave,” Rio gruffly said and turned back to the way they came.</p><p>Agatha sighed, pushed off the wall, and followed her on shaky legs. Sad, confused, and aroused into silence.</p><p>They were about half a mile from camp when another roaring screech filled the air. Looking back and up, Agatha saw the gigantic arachnid-like creature as part of its torso emerged over the mountain’s edge. Its legs disturbingly ended in clawed hands, but was nowhere near as horrendous as its humanoid skull and hollowed eyes, drawn and emaciated, two sets of sharp mandibles protruding like beetle horns from its cheeks, the wings on its back thin and translucent like a dragonfly’s.</p><p>It was the stuff of nightmares. And when it looked right at them and screamed again, Agatha scooped Rio into a bridal carry and flew them down as fast as she could. Rio’s arms wrapped around her neck and the lack of any objection told her she had made the right decision.</p><p>Back behind the shield, Wanda stood waiting, presumably having kept watch for them. Her brows lifted at the hickeys no doubt littering Agatha’s neck, then at the woman she still held securely in her arms.</p><p>God, it felt like those first days when they’d started courting. When Agatha was so wrapped up in everything Rio she couldn’t think clearly. Despite her muddled mind, she was relieved to have remembered that Rio’s power was wonky and that her own magic appeared to be fine.</p><p>“You can put me down now,” Rio murmured, cheeks prettily pinked even as her hand was possessively threaded into Agatha's hair, scratching her scalp in a way that made Agatha go hazy.</p><p>“Uhm, okay,” Agatha dumbly mumbled and awkwardly placed her on her feet.</p><p>“Wake everyone up, please,” Rio softly said and walked toward the Gate.</p><p>Agatha avoided Wanda’s gaze, ashamed that she’d finally gotten time alone with Rio and had wasted it being silently horny.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They entered an empty cave as large as the surface area of their house. Everyone sleepily looked around and waited to hear if they were supposed to settle in or if they were continuing on their journey. Too tired to do anything other than lift a brow or two at the state of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Rio ignored them, emanating a nervous energy that the whole coven picked up on and had them on edge. So they quietly watched her walk to the other end of the room where she removed her satchel, gently placed it on the ground, and lifted her knife.</p><p>From the ground, a stone pedestal rose, four feet high and six feet wide, three circular shapes were cut into the platform. Rio placed her knife on it and summoned the giant cosmic egg she’d pilfered and placed it in the centre. The pedestal seemed to only be a receptacle to hold it rather than a mechanism that would interact with it.</p><p>Rio then bent down and carefully retrieved first one black egg from her satchel, then the other, gently placing them on either side of the cosmic egg. She visibly and shakily inhaled, causing Agatha to smile at the human mannerisms that clung to her.</p><p>Cracking her neck, Rio’s eyes fell shut, her robes floating up and shadowy magic wafted around her like smoke. At her feet, emerald vines sprung forth and spread out, creeping up the cave wall. The earth shook, gently vibrating, and Alice cast a shield around them.</p><p>“Agatha?” Jen whispered.</p><p>“Shh,” Agatha said, but placed a comforting hand on Jen’s elbow. Not sure what was happening, but unwilling to interrupt it. The coven huddled together, keeping each other steady as the ground continued to tremble and plants and trees of various colours burst through from the walls and floor. Blades of grass covered the ground, lush beneath their feet.</p><p>The cosmic egg began to glow so brightly, Agatha had to cover her eyes with a hand. The light formed the shape of a dome around the pedestal and Rio, dimming somewhat as Rio seemed to contain whatever was happening.</p><p>Agatha occasionally peaked through her fingers to try and see if anything else changed. The plants around them grew larger and stronger until they were standing in a kaleidoscopic jungle. When the light faded, she dropped her hand along with it.</p><p> On the pedestal, the cosmic egg had disappeared, and in the receptacles where the two eggs had been placed, two creatures were perched. They resembled sugar-gliders, but the size of capuchin monkeys, their tails long and ringed like lemurs, ears big and fluffy like koalas, and eyes as large in proportion as a bushbaby’s. They could still have been classified as some undiscovered species from Earth, was it not for the colour of their eyes. One pair glowing an ethereal red and the other a matching blue.</p><p>Rio grinned, eyes glistening, and held out her hands and the two jumped toward her, skittering up her arms and curled into her neck. Hugging them, Rio’s joyous laughter echoed beautifully around the alien forest she’d created.</p><p>“Huh,” Lilia said. “I guess she really is a Green Witch.”</p>

      Chapter 7: The City of Judgement

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio stepped through the abundant foliage, toward where the coven still stood gawking at her and came to a halt. She lifted her knife and another portal Gate appeared within the greenery.</p><p>“Okay,” she said, turning to face them, her little monkey creature egg children skittering into her robes and out of sight. “This Gate will be a little different.”</p><p>Tensing up, the coven gathered around her, keeping a good distance after what they’d just witnessed, apparently too stunned to ask questions, and listened intently instead.</p><p>“In order to access the House of Ideas and exit the Outside, the requirement is that you must first enter the City of Judgement to be purified.”</p><p>“I plead not guilty to all charges,” Agatha drawled. “And though I am impure, its hardly a crime.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “You won’t be entering an actual city. I haven’t been there, but I’ve heard that the realm will trap you in either a nightmare or a fantasy until you overcome what’s holding you back. You’ll also be split up so don’t waste time looking for each other.”</p><p>“Awesome,” Jen deadpanned.</p><p>“What if nothing’s holding us back?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Then you’ll step right through into another room where I’ll summon another Gate to continue on our path.”</p><p>Jen shifted uncomfortably. “What if we don’t know what’s holding us back?”</p><p>“Then you’ll be stuck there until you figure it out. Or die trying. Or submit to the fantasy and choose to stay. I heard some people have killed themselves to end their nightmares, so keep in mind that you can be physically harmed, even by things you feel shouldn’t exist.”</p><p>Wanda bit her lip. “Is there a time limit to getting out?”</p><p>“No. But I won’t be able to wait for you for more than a day. There are…important matters I need to attend to.”</p><p>“Harsh,” Jen mumbled.</p><p>“Right, ladies,” Agatha said. “Let’s go get purified. I will meet you as a born-again virgin on the other side.”</p><p>Lilia snorted and then stepped through the Gate.</p><p>“Oh, so we’re just doing it?” Alice said alarmed. “No more discussion or alternatives? Just heading right on in there…” She rocked in place but didn’t take a step, until Jen took her hand and walked in with her.</p><p>Agatha turned to a worried Wanda. “You’ll do great,” she softly said, smiling when Wanda did. “You’ve already lived through your nightmares, so worst case scenario, you get stuck in a fantasy you don’t want to get out of.”</p><p>“I’ve created a fantasy I was very much stuck in.”</p><p>“Exactly, so you’ll be able to recognise the signs and get out easily.”</p><p>Wanda’s brows furrowed. “Do you think maybe the City of Judgement is where one of us is stuck fighting the other?”</p><p>Agatha stilled, having purposely forgotten about that. “Just remember it’s all fake, okay? I’ll be into it if you kick my ass in your fantasies.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled and hugged her. “You’re gonna do great, too. I know it.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer, only held her tighter. Until the scent of roses wafted over them and Agatha went rigid.</p><p>“What—<em>shit</em>,” Wanda said when she pulled away and saw Rio standing right beside them.</p><p>Rio grinned sharply. “Oh, I'm sorry, did you two need more time for a farewell fuck?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, pinched the bridge of her nose, eyes squeezing shut, and longed for the mountains.</p><p>Wanda chuckled and gave Agatha a quick peck on the cheek. “Love you,” she said, and entered through the Gate. Abandoning Agatha to a silently fuming Rio.</p><p>“Wanda’s my friend. I’m going to worry about her.”</p><p>“I don't care.”</p><p>“Clearly.” Rio’s obvious jealousy at least helped Agatha finally recover from the bitter sting of rejection. “Do you want a hug too?”</p><p>“Go through the Gate, Agatha. We’re on a timer.”</p><p>Smirking salaciously, Agatha winked at her, twirled around, and entered the City of Judgement.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>She woke in an achingly familiar bedroom, laying on embroidered cotton and silk linens, in a familiar bed with an elaborate wrought iron headboard. Matted blue walls made the room feel cool in summer, and a large fireplace kept it cosy and warm in winter. She’d spent many a summer evening with the balcony doors open, lounging on the chaise whilst studying her tomes.</p><p>She could feel Rio’s presence in the house too, and lay in her long white vintage chemise for a while longer, contemplating whether she was trapped in a fantasy or a nightmare in the Spanish villa she’d spent half a century of her life in.</p><p>Needing to see whether she was trapped in the room, the house, or a facsimile of Spain in general, she got up, drawn to the vast selection of rose oils and rose water on the dark wood vanity. Picking up one that contained already diluted oil, she removed the glass dropper and lightly dabbed it on her chest, neck, and wrists, then inhaled deeply, her shoulders loosening.</p><p>She’d been wanting to make rose oil as gifts for the coven, but it felt too intimate and far too thoughtful a gift to spring on them out of nowhere. Birthdays were an option but then she’d have to choose who to start with. The thought of handing something so personal over to someone made her physically cringe.</p><p>Shaking her head at her absurdity, Agatha walked to the door, relieved when she was able to move freely throughout the home.</p><p>The villa was shaped around a large courtyard. A rustic wraparound porch with various lounging chairs and tables lined the house and kept it cool throughout summer. The porch was covered by a wood iron awning to accentuate the rugged stone walls. A lush lawn framed by rosebushes, centred a massive ever-blooming jacaranda tree, purple petals prettily blanketing the grass beneath it.</p><p>The sun hung low over the rolling hilltops of a gorgeous verdant valley, and Agatha took a moment to breathe it all in.</p><p>No other home had ever made her feel as happy as she’d been when living at the villa. And even knowing it was all fake, her chest felt light and a smile pulled at the corners of her mouth at all the fond memories that washed over her at the familiar sights and scents.</p><p>Hearing movement from the kitchen, Agatha headed that way, unsurprised to find Rio finishing up enough food to feed a party.</p><p>“Are you real?”</p><p>“Afraid so,” Rio murmured. She was dressed in a T-Shirt and jeans again and Agatha frowned down at her own frilly 1700’s style nightdress.</p><p>“I thought this was a personal journey type of thing.”</p><p>“I thought I wouldn’t be subjected to it at all.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and stole a stuffed olive off one of the plates, popping it into her mouth. Rio gathered a few tapas containing neatly cut strips of roast lechazo, iberian ham, marinated mussels and ramekins of infused aioli. Grabbing the remaining plates and a basket of freshly baked bread, Agatha followed Rio outside to the rusty-red wicker lounge set in the centre of the porch.</p><p>After spreading the plates across the table with its patterned cast iron frame, she sat down and reclined in the comfy seat. Rio had gone back inside, and Agatha accepted the glass of white wine handed to her when Rio returned with a bottle and a glass of her own.</p><p>“We can move to the edges of the property,” Rio said, sitting down opposite her. “No further than that.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. At least they weren’t confined to only one room.</p><p>“Your horses are here, too.”</p><p>No one else knew that Agatha was a horse girl. She secretly owned a ranch out west for injured and retired racehorses, as well as a dressage school in Vienna. Unsure why she kept it hidden, other than it was nice to have things that were only for herself.</p><p>“They aren’t real,” she said to stop herself from getting distracted. “They’ve been gone for a long time.”</p><p>Rio hummed and Agatha remained seated despite every fibre of her being wanting to run to the stables and see her Andalusians again. The villa was saturated in things they loved. Rio’s breathtaking landscape paintings on the walls, the gardens they’d tended together. The furniture Rio had crafted by hand. The instruments they enjoyed playing. They had built a beautiful life there. Which meant it was a fantasy she was trapped in. An excerpt from when her life had been perfect.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “Where are your egg children?”</p><p>“They were spared whatever this is. Only a small part of me is trapped here, so I’m able to be with them on the other side of the Gate.”</p><p>“Have you had a chance to check on my roses?”</p><p>“Your roses are fine.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>Agatha nibbled on a block of cheese. “So what was the original plan we interrupted?”</p><p>“Get the cosmic egg, then collect something else from the Land of Couldn't-Be-Shouldn't-Be—</p><p>Agatha grinned widely, a piece of spicy sausage paused on its way to her mouth. “That can’t be what it’s called.”</p><p>Rio smiled back. “I assure you it is.”</p><p>“Hm. So you couldn’t just go there without doing all the museum burglary, decorating, and vanishing house stuff?”</p><p>“The quickest path to The Beyond is through the Mystery House and the Chaos King. You saw the absolute nothingness there was. Any other entry points would’ve made the journey much longer.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “So two places and you would’ve been done?”</p><p>“I need to go to the House of Ideas anyway, but could’ve accessed it without all of this.” She irritably motioned around her.</p><p>Agatha tried not to be hurt that Rio wasn’t as lost in nostalgia as she was. And had to swallow thickly before she gruffly asked, “What else is on the itinerary?”</p><p>“I’ll take whomever makes it out of this to the Marketplace next.”</p><p>“Very touristy.”</p><p>“It’s apparently a great place to get witchy things. I’m sure a distraction from whatever the City of Judgement reveals to them will be appreciated.”</p><p>Rio might’ve told the coven she would leave them, but Agatha highly doubted that. The threat had most likely been in encouragement to not dawdle on their issues whilst in there. Whatever business she had to attend to, Agatha was certain Rio had been attending to it throughout their journey.</p><p>“That’s very nice of you.”</p><p>“They’re handling all of this far better than I expected. Didn’t even ask about the eggs, so they might be growing on me.”</p><p>“They do that to a person. Kind of insidious if you ask me. So after the Land of Couldn't-Be-Shouldn't-Be, we go to the House of Ideas and then home?”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“Not too much of a detour then?”</p><p>Rio hummed and took a sip of her wine.</p><p>Pretending for a moment that they were truly in the past, Agatha continued to nibble on the delicious food, slowly sipped her wine, and stared at Rio while Rio stared out at the courtyard, until her heart felt raw. Remembering the beautiful golden glow of Rio’s skin during Spanish summers. How she had glistened when exiting the river after a cool swim… How they’d made love for hours and hours on end without care for time or anyone but each other.</p><p>The sun disappeared and Rio flicked a finger to light the oil lamps around the house. Rio in the glimmer of the lamplight was something ethereal, and Agatha felt about as ready as she’ll ever be to deal with why she might be there.</p><p>“Where did you appear when you entered?” she asked.</p><p>Rio hesitated, staring toward the Jacaranda tree with shimmering eyes.</p><p>“We’re clearly each other’s unfinished business to handle, Rio. Or at the very least, you’re mine. So, unless you want me to be trapped in here forever, I’m going to need information to figure out what to do next.”</p><p>“I was seated on the chaise in our—in the main bedroom. You were asleep.”</p><p>“Okay, we should probably start there then.”</p><p>Sighing, Rio placed her glass down and Agatha followed her upstairs to their bedroom, stomach knotting anxiously.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Rio went to sit on the chaise. Agatha didn’t lay down, but sat opposite her at the foot of the bed.</p><p>“Does this place still hold meaning for you?” Rio asked, leaning against the backrest, arm casually slung across it and man-spreading like a professional douchebag, yet making it look absurdly attractive.</p><p>Agatha’s brows knitted at the question. “Of course it does. You gave it to me as a gift.”</p><p>She still owned the property. Had a trusted company handling the upkeep. Preserving it like a museum. Agatha just hadn’t ever allowed herself to go back. Avoided the entire country of Spain like the plague.</p><p>“I’ve given you many gifts.”</p><p>“We got married beneath the Jacaranda in the courtyard.”</p><p>“You’ve made it clear that our vows mean nothing to you.”</p><p>“We made Nicky here.” He hadn’t been planned. But he had been wanted.</p><p>Rio swallowed and averted her gaze.</p><p>Licking her lips, Agatha got up and climbed into Rio’s lap, straddling a thigh, but kept her arms and hands to herself. Rio continued to recline as she had been, dark eyes unabashedly drinking Agatha in, like she was wearing something sexier than a bland nightgown.</p><p>“I hadn’t seen you in months because of cosmic time fuckery,” Agatha said. “You had to go deal with Tribunal business that required all of your presence so couldn’t even visit me partially. I’d missed you so much and remember thinking that once you got back I was going to ask you about starting a family. But then you returned and all I could do was kiss you and touch you.”</p><p>“I spent days inside of you,” Rio husked.</p><p>Agatha hummed and rocked her hips, bare against the deliciously rough denim.</p><p>Swept up in her memories, drowning in nostalgia, still worked up from getting her neck sucked while pressed up against a wall, she leaned down and tried to kiss Rio, but was met with a smooth cheek that she gently grazed with her lips, even as she ached at yet another rejection.</p><p>“I’m not kissing your cheating mouth,” Rio lowly said, though didn’t stop Agatha’s languid grinding against her thigh, instead locking a steely gaze on her.</p><p>Agatha had no defences in place against a stern-angry Rio combo. It always got her too hot too fast, and she pulled the chemise over her head and tossed it across the room.</p><p>A look of pure anguish crossed Rio’s face when her eyes dropped to Agatha’s breasts and Agatha halted. “Do you need me to stop?”</p><p>“I wish you would remember.”</p><p>“I remember everything, darling,” Agatha assured her, breath catching at Rio’s sad brown eyes. “I remember you making me wait a very long time to be with you.”</p><p>Rio’s lips tilted up at one corner. “I couldn’t afford to have a controversially young girlfriend. My stellar reputation wouldn’t have recovered from the scandal.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Everyone had controversially young girlfriends in the 1700s. Child brides were all the rage.” She pulled a face. Disgusted. “Still grossly are in some parts.” She shook her head. “Ten years, Rio. You made me wait four of them before even kissing me. I had to perfect the art of magical masturbation because of your torture.”</p><p>“Hardly my fault you're a nymphomaniac.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “You were edging me for a decade. Visited me constantly in your pretty green dress and delicious mouth. Held me when I mourned the coven I murdered. Supported me through my studies, guided me to experience life with the freedom my power gave me. Encouraged me to meet new people when the only person I ever wanted was you. Ten years of not fucking me and making me fall in love with you more and more.”</p><p>“All part of my evil plan.”</p><p>“And now,” Agatha said, her hips bucked, dampening Rio’s jeans. “Now I’m conditioned to wait for the pay-off. To push until I get my prize.”</p><p>“I’m not touching you, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha smirked lazily. “I can manage like this,” she rasped and palmed her own breasts, stomach clenching when Rio’s hips jolted beneath her, brown eyes intently watching her pinch her nipples.</p><p>“If you’re going to masturbate, I’ll leave and give you the privacy to do so.”</p><p>Agatha whined as she dragged her hands from her breasts, up her neck and into her hair, wanting to pull out a few strands, before lowering them in defeat.</p><p>“If I don’t touch myself, may I stay here?” She ground down a little harder, face and chest flushed.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Are you no longer attracted to me?” She pouted.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at the blatant attempt at manipulation, then unbuttoned her jeans. The zipper was slowly dragged down under Agatha’s intent gaze. Rio slipped her ring and middle fingers between her own legs, dragging them through her folds and Agatha tried to use her magic to see, but found she couldn’t connect to her power at all. Not surprised and too distracted to care. Too focused on Rio’s fingers being pulled out, glistening with slick.</p><p>“Open for me.”</p><p>Agatha mewled and her hips stuttered, her mouth falling open. She offered her tongue and moaned when Rio placed those two fingers onto it. She greedily sucked them into her mouth, her tongue curling around the digits. Dazed by the familiar taste, by the way Rio slowly fucked her fingers into Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>She nearly grabbed Rio’s wrist, to keep her inside, remembering at the last second not to.</p><p>Rio groaned in appreciation of her restraint, letting her suck a little longer, before she gently slid out, reverently running her wet fingers across Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“I will always want you, my love,” Rio earnestly said.</p><p>Agatha sighed in satisfaction. Rio’s jeans were warm and wet between her thighs. It had been too long since they’d been together. Agatha had missed her touch, her voice, her mouth. She felt on fire at the way Rio watched her fruitless struggle to find release. Stomach coiling hotly at the knowledge that Rio still found her attractive at least.</p><p>“You use sex to deflect when you’re stressed or scared or uncertain,” Rio murmured. “I don’t think continuing to enable you right now would be for the best.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, not stopping her mindless rutting. She was horny, yes, but also needed to be close to Rio. Wanted Rio’s arms around her and if she stopped, she might need to get off Rio’s lap and confront whatever it was that brought them there without the comfort of Rio’s proximity to soothe her.</p><p>“If closure is what this place wants us to achieve,” Rio continued, “then I fear we might be stuck here for a very long time.”</p><p>“You don’t want closure?”</p><p>“It appears I’m unable to forgive you.”</p><p>Agatha stilled. “Rio, I hadn’t seen you in decades the first time I had sex with someone else. I don’t even remember who she was. For all I knew, you had moved on already. It certainly didn’t seem as though you were ever coming back.”</p><p>“What are these then,” Rio lifted her purple ouroboros, “other than a testament of my continued commitment and loyalty to you?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. At the hurt and betrayal marring her beautiful face. Then slowly lifted her own green tattooed wrist.</p><p>“These work both ways, darling. What are they if not a testament to my continued devotion to you? They’re as detailed as ever. They bloom and move every day. I fucked my way through my grief, yes, you <em>just</em> said that it’s a poor coping mechanism I’m guilty of. I know I told you to leave, but guess what, you didn't have to stay away. You could’ve fought a little harder to see me, to talk to me, but chose your pride instead.”</p><p>Rio’s chuckled drily. “That’s not what I can’t forgive you for. I was talking about Nicky.”</p><p>Every ounce of arousal left Agatha at once.</p><p>“I’ve dealt with my grief,” she thickly said. “Meeting Wanda helped me understand that there are healthy ways to mourn and move on. And because I kept living in denial, I never did that. I’ve recently come to realise that sometimes,” her voice cracked, “little boys die.”</p><p>Agatha was flung off Rio’s lap and onto the bed, harmlessly cushioned by the pillows, shocked by the abrupt displacement.</p><p>Rio stood from the chaise as furious as Agatha had ever seen her.</p><p>“<em>Wanda</em> helped you mourn <em>our </em>son?”</p><p>Agatha frowned, not sure how to respond, uncertain because of the severity of Rio’s reaction. They were both possessive and open about their jealousy. But there were lines they never crossed. Lines they had agreed to never cross. When things went from sexy to a little scary.</p><p>“Do you know why I struggle to forgive you, Agatha? Why I couldn’t come back? You blamed me. Fine. Not the first mortal to do so. But you acted as though I didn’t lose him, too. Like I wasn’t his mother, too. That I wasn’t grieving, too. Like I didn’t love him—</p><p>Rio’s breath caught, chest heaving, and tears pooling in her eyes.</p><p>—you threw me away. Instead of having my wife there to mourn our son, I had to do it alone. And now you tell me you chose to open up to <em>Wanda</em>? When you couldn’t even look at me? When you couldn’t stand having me near you?”</p><p>Agatha got up, vision blurring with tears, rounding the bed but stopped at the foot when Rio backed away. As though she was afraid of her.</p><p>“The second I told you we would lose him, you shut me out,” Rio gruffly said. “You locked up and nothing I did could get through to you. I had to take my son to the Spirit Realm and leave him there. I had to smile and be strong so he wouldn’t be scared. I had to make a fucking <em>game </em>out of losing him! And I needed you after. But you’d become so hurtful with your words that I was scared to be around you. I was struggling with who I was and what I had to do to my own child, and terrified that if I turned to you and sought comfort, you would destroy me entirely.”</p><p>Agatha abruptly remembered the things she’d suppressed up until that moment. The things she had wilfully ignored to instead cling to her anger. Rio standing stoic and neglected on the periphery as Agatha shaped their lives around her own fear and grief and wants. Constantly picking fights, yet Rio never calling her out on her unfair behaviour. Memories of her desperately clinging to Nicky, monopolising his attention, selfish and greedy. Unwilling to talk to Rio about losing him, only demanding more time. Raging when Rio denied her. Ignoring the clear pain and sorrow in Rio’s eyes whenever she had looked at Agatha…</p><p>Something cracked in Agatha’s chest, like an elephant had stomped on it. “Oh, god…” she sobbed, her shoulders shaking. “I’m sorry. I wasn’t—I didn’t mean to.” Horrified at just how hollow the words were now after everything was said and done.</p><p>“Then what did you mean when you told me to leave you alone? When you said you never wanted to see my face again? You expected me to come find you so you could tear me apart? Was I supposed to know that a woman you just met magically made you understand something you weren’t willing to even consider for me? For us?”</p><p>Agatha inhaled a shuddering breath, swallowing the salty knot in her throat. Clutching her swirling stomach. Sickened as she remembered how ruthless she’d been. Using Rio as a verbal punching bag because she couldn’t find a way to keep Nicky alive. Entitled and blaming Rio, as though countless mothers hadn’t lost their children without having been granted the time Rio had given her. She’d blocked out so much of that time just to cope over the years and now everything hit her all at once. The full extent of her cruelty.</p><p>“I’m not sure I could’ve been good to you back then,” Agatha shakily admitted. “I wasn’t very good to myself either. Anger was the only thing holding me together. That kept me going each day.”</p><p>She took a tentative step closer, grateful when Rio didn’t move, staring at her with tears freely flowing down her cheeks.</p><p>“I felt him struggling while I was pregnant. I knew we would lose him, and still I made you tell me so I could beg you to not take him. I knew how guilty you felt that we hadn’t planned to have him. As though you alone were responsible for that. And I used that against you.”</p><p>Rio wiped her cheeks and sniffed. “I know.”</p><p>“You gave me time, Rio. Back then it felt like too little. Like if you could give me six years, why not sixteen, why not sixty? I was consumed with the existence of an invisible clock ticking away instead of living in the moment and appreciating the time we did have. Instead of focusing on giving him a good life with us as a family, I spent it in denial, refusing to prepare that we were going to lose him.”</p><p>“I don’t think any preparation would’ve made it hurt less.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I was a mess and felt helpless. Useless. I wasn’t able to be what you needed then, even if I had been aware of the extent of how I was affecting you. Of how I was selfishly hurting you. I’m not saying I told you to leave for your benefit, that came from a place of anguish and unjustified rage, but you were at least spared having to continue dealing with me in that manic state of grief.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “I had to deal with the fact that I couldn’t protect him. That I didn’t save him. That I made a choice to uphold the Sacred Balance. We were supposed to be there for each other. You were supposed to be there for me. You didn’t spare me from anything, because I lost both my son and my wife, and I’ve been broken ever since.”</p><p>Agatha trembled uncontrollably, and crossed her arms over her chest to try and stop. She couldn’t believe that she had ever treated Rio like that. Not when all she remembered now was how much she’d loved her. And still, flashes of blind rage took shape. Heated accusations. Ruthless words. Cutting demands. Rio’s sad eyes longing and hurt, still trying to be there for her. Trying to put Agatha’s feelings first at the expense of her own.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat raw and voice hoarse. “I know it’s my own fault, but I lost you both too, Rio, and it made my subsequent spiral even worse not having you there. It took two hundred years for me to find closure on Nicky’s death. To understand that what you did for me wasn’t the weak consolation I’d convinced myself it was, but a precious gift to cherish. You gave me the chance to know him and hold him. To hear his voice and his laughter. To create memories I can pull on when I miss him too much. And I wish I could’ve known it then and appreciate it more. That I could’ve kept you close and held you after—</p><p>She tried to wipe her tears, hating herself for being more emotional when she’d been the one to ruin everything. “But I wouldn’t have been able to, Rio. I didn’t call to you after because I thought I had no right to. That I’d driven you away permanently and lost you forever. And it was easy to believe that because I couldn’t blame you for being done with me. I may not have understood the extent of how I hurt you but I knew that I had.”</p><p>The ouroboros on both their wrists glowed and swirled and Agatha stared at her own. “When you didn’t come back, I thought these were a fluke. My magic being weird because I’d had the Darkhold for so long and because I was still holding on to—I’m so sorry. Please, even if you don’t ever forgive me, just know that my biggest regret was pushing you away and treating you the way that I did. I hate that I hurt you. I hate that I was so stuck in my own grief that I completely dismissed your own. I wish I’d been able to be what you needed then. But I lost him, Rio. Nicky <em>died</em> and I couldn’t—</p><p>Her voice cracked and Rio’s arms wrapped around her.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry,” she mumbled over and over, crying into Rio’s neck, desperately clinging to her.</p><p>“I should've come back,” Rio rasped. “I’m sorry I was a coward.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, trying to let her know that she shouldn’t blame herself, but any words were painfully stuck inside of her and all she could do was tightly hold onto Rio while they wept as though it was that awful day in 1756 all over again.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Agatha didn't think she had enough time left in her life to make it up to Rio.</p><p>She had hoped to hold her for longer, but Rio shifted away, her arms dropped, and Agatha cupped her face, brushed away Rio’s tears with her thumbs, tenderly placing her hair behind her ears… Rio smiled softly and then took another step away and Agatha finally noticed that they weren’t in the villa any longer, but standing in a large cave again, Alice and Jen awkwardly looking away from the scene.</p><p>Wanda though, was staring directly at them with a soft empathetic smile.</p><p>“Oh…” Agatha breathed and ran a hand over her blue coat, grateful that she wasn’t still naked. Not that she cared about nudity, but what had just happened between her and Rio… It felt wrong to allot it a different connotation.</p><p>Rio sighed, didn’t look at anyone, and shifted into a large black wolf with bright emerald eyes. She trotted over to her egg children who had decided to turn into black wolf pups, recognisable only by their respective sets of gleaming blue and red irises.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Wanda softly asked.</p><p>Agatha nodded, dragging her gaze from Rio. “We finally spoke about Nicky.”</p><p>Wanda squeezed her shoulder. She knew more than anyone and still didn’t know anything. Couldn’t possibly know when Agatha had only just realised the extent of her transgressions.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “How did yours go?”</p><p>“I spent what felt like days trying to save that building of people I killed. I didn’t realise it still weighed on me. I thought that if I had more control back then, like I do now, it wouldn’t have happened.”</p><p>“Did you manage to save them?”</p><p>“I did. A few times. Then other people died instead. Some people I knew. It was awful, like it was forcing me to choose whose lives mattered more.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her into a hug and kissed her hair. “How did it end?”</p><p>“I gave up trying to change the past. Really should’ve known that was what I was supposed to do.”</p><p>“In the moment, it’s difficult to know what’s needed from us.”</p><p>“I was worried it would be Vis.”</p><p>“How do you feel about it not being him?”</p><p>“At first I felt guilty. Ashamed that I’ve moved on from what happened. But now I’m relieved at how far I’ve come from hexing entire towns to be with him again.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Proud of you, Red.”</p><p>Wanda blushed and let Agatha lead them over to Alice and Jen.</p><p>“Lilia still inside?” Agatha asked after a round of tight hugs.</p><p>They nodded worriedly.</p><p>The massive cave they were in only held a single white door that looked as though it belonged in a modern home. No sign of a Gate they might’ve exited. No windows, but a glowing yellow sphere hovered against the ceiling warmly illuminating the whole area. There was no way of telling what time of day it was, but aside from the City of Judgement, it had always been night time or an endless void of nothingness.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said and conjured up a few bedrolls. They should probably try to sleep whenever they had the chance.</p><p>“Rio created a place to wash up,” Alice said. Motioning to the door. “A shower, bath, toiletries everything.”</p><p>Now that they mentioned it, they did look cleaner. Agatha glanced over to where wolf Rio was playing with the pups and softly smiled. Something achy tugging at her heart.</p><p>“She was here the whole time…” Jen said. “How was she with you, too? She vanished when you two appeared…”</p><p>“Magic.” Agatha shrugged and ran away under the guise of washing up.</p><p>Lilia still wasn’t there by the time she returned after a very long bath. Having spent the entire time thinking about Rio’s teary face in the City of Judgement. Drowning in guilt and regret until her skin grew wrinkly.</p><p>They anxiously sat around on the bedrolls. Talking about Jen’s nightmare of having to deal with the man who’d bound her and Alice’s fantasy encounter of spending more time with her mother. Agatha realised then, had she never met these women who annoyingly chose to process things and openly showed care and concern, she might still be stuck in the City of Judgement, unaware of just how much she’d wronged Rio and in which ways she’d done so. The Agatha of five years ago wouldn’t have had the capacity to apologise. Would have doubled-down that the worst thing to have ever happened to her, had been Rio’s fault.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze wandered to Rio again, only to find her gone, the pups waking from a nap. She watched them sniffing the air, occasionally biting and pawing at each other, before they looked in her direction and bounded over, jumping right into her lap. They wiggled around, and when Agatha gently petted them, settled down and fell asleep again.</p><p>“What are they?” Alice whispered.</p><p>“I have my suspicions, but it’s best to wait for Rio to tell us.”</p><p>They nodded, staring at the pups with longing as though they wanted to play with them.</p><p>“We should sleep while we can,” Agatha said and laid down with the puppies curled up against her stomach, not really thinking she could fall asleep...</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Her eyes fluttered open some time later to the sound of Jen and Wanda’s snores and the sight of emerald green wolf eyes staring at her. Rio laid on her stomach beside Agatha’s bedroll, ears perking up when she was caught staring.</p><p>Rio needed time to deal with new information and realities. Shifting was her way of asking for time to process and still remain close while she did. Agatha suspected it was because so little was ever new to Rio or surprising. There were plenty of times of course, where Rio had shifted for fun. Where Agatha had sat riding on a dragon’s back and they’d traumatised entire villages. But on the day she’d found out she was pregnant, for instance, Agatha had spent hours with a gorgeous black cat curled up on her lap.</p><p> She reached out and lightly scratched behind Rio’s ear, the puppies nestled between them.</p><p>After leaning into it for a while, Rio laid her large head down on her paws. Agatha’s fingers curled into the fur at the scruff of Rio’s neck and fell asleep again a moment later.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>She woke to Wanda lightly shaking her shoulder. Rio and the pups were gone, and Agatha sat up to see Alice and Jen hugging Lilia. She scrambled to her feet and hurried over, sweeping Lilia up in an embrace. Lilia patted her with a soft laugh, but soon stepped back, staring at her with a look of concern.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked, flicking her hair back over her shoulder. “Did you miss my pretty face so much you can’t stop staring?” She chuckled awkwardly.</p><p>“Rio is Death…” Lilia carefully said. Not quite an accusation, more to gauge whether Agatha had known, careful to keep a measured tone in case she didn’t.</p><p>Uncertain whether she should confirm, deny, or deflect, Agatha cleared her throat and looked around for Rio who decided it was a good time to appear in a swirl of shadowy magic, dressed in her black cloak, the lower half of her face skeletal. Her knife was raised in one hand and the shiny blue and red eyes of her egg children ominously glittered from the void in her hood.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip to stop from grinning at the theatrics.</p><p>“Hello, Agatha’s Coven,” Rio said in that deep distorted voice that always pleasantly tugged at Agatha’s navel.</p><p>The coven screamed, Lilia only winced at the volume, and Agatha cackled in delight.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Okay, okay, it’s really not that scream-worthy,” Agatha said after a while of them going at it, and they calmed to stare at her in disbelief.</p><p>Jen’s eyes were the widest. “You <em>knew</em>?”</p><p>“Of course I knew.”</p><p>“I guess it would be weird if she didn't tell her wife,” Wanda mumbled.</p><p>“Is she here because we’re dying?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha are we <em>dead</em>?” Alice asked. “Did we die? Is this<em> hell</em>?”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, tapping a finger against them thoughtfully. “Okay, now that I think about it a little more, I can see why you might think that, but we aren’t dead, yet.”</p><p>Lilia snorted and Agatha sighed stepping in front of Rio to face the coven and stop them from gawking and working themselves up again. She flicked her hair and coat and held her hands up in supplication.</p><p> “I know this is a shock.”</p><p>“Understatement of the century,” Wanda muttered.</p><p>“And I need everyone to know that we really aren’t dead. Right, Rio?”</p><p>“Right,” Rio’s voice rumbled behind her with an amused lilt that had Agatha fighting a smile and everyone else’s eyes widening.</p><p>“But, mostly I think this is a great time for everyone to reflect on my extreme maturity in not saying I told you so even once since we’ve been here. Even though I told you so many many times to leave well enough alone. And even though I did tell you so, I never said out loud that I did. And now here we are, in a mess of our own making. Despite me having told you so.”</p><p>Jen snorted. “You just said it like four times.”</p><p>“And you should applaud my restraint for not having said it sooner.”</p><p>“Great show of restraint, Agatha,” Lilia deadpanned.</p><p>“Thank you, Lilia. Now, I want you to listen carefully this time round so that I won't need to not tell you I told you so in future.”</p><p>The statement at least had them relaxing a little, rolling their eyes and smothering smiles.</p><p>“I want to remind you that we’re off in a different world, universe, cosmos, whatever. And though I grew up in a time where girls were gatekept from the sciences, I’m pretty sure we shouldn’t be able to just breathe whatever air of whatever world we enter like we have been.”</p><p>Jen’s hand rubbed at her throat and she swallowed visibly.</p><p>“Which means that Rio has been actively keeping us alive, which should tell you that she probably doesn’t want us to die, right?”</p><p>Their eyes shifted to where Rio was still behind her and then back to Agatha.</p><p>“So lets not judge based on preconceived notions regarding matters we know nothing about. Rio's been kind enough to not abandon us after we crashed her party.”</p><p>A round of agreeing mutters followed the statement.</p><p>“Good. Now, darling,” she turned to Rio, momentarily stunned at the soft brown eyes staring at her and tilted her head confusedly. “Why don’t you share what you’re comfortable with so we can move on faster from this revelation. I <em>really</em> want to get home.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, her face changing back to mortal. “Uhm, these are the Twins,” she said, scooping up the two tiger-like cubs that had been playing beneath her robes. They were the size of house cats, their fur a shade of green instead of orange with no stripes, and their tails ended in scorpion stingers the colour of their respective eyes. “Eternity and Infinity.” She held them up like a schoolchild doing a show and tell, just as endearing too, and it had Agatha’s heart melting.</p><p>“A short while ago, they were murdered, along with the rest of the Living Tribunal…The way of the cosmos is that should the Twins die, Eternity in particular, everything dies. You’ve seen the void that remains in their absence from when we traversed the Far Shore and The Beyond.”</p><p>Everyone shifted uncomfortably, worry practically wafting off them.</p><p>“I was quick enough to recreate them to prevent that from happening. And because I had to act fast, I only had time to create their essence. It was enough to stop the collapse of the cosmos, but it means they’re currently vulnerable and still being hunted. So I came to the Outside to make them stronger. As their guardian, I can’t expend too much of my own energy growing them and risk leaving them less protected in a weakened state, so that’s what I’m doing here. And I won’t be taking any questions on the matter.”</p><p>She gave a decisive nod, placed the cubs on the ground where they scurried beneath her robes again and cast another Gate with her knife. “Now if you’d be so kind.”</p><p>Everyone remained stunned and in place. Agatha could understand, given they’d just learned who Rio was and then got slapped in the face with the knowledge that the cosmos was on the brink of destruction.</p><p>“Did you hear that, coven?” she said as though she was an elementary school teacher. “Rio has taken time out of her very busy schedule of saving the cosmos to guide us through the Outside. So what do we say?”</p><p>“Thank you, Rio,” they all mumbled.</p><p>“Great! Now, <em>andale</em>!” she shooed everyone toward the Gate.</p><p>Alice, Jen and Wanda filed through, still obviously reeling. Agatha too was flailing, though very much internally. It helped that she had at least expected something catastrophic given Rio’s unusual behaviour and having known that the Living Tribunal who usually dealt with these matters together, had all been wiped out.</p><p>When Agatha had first learned who Rio was, she hadn’t believed her for the longest time and by the time it registered, Agatha had been so deeply in love already it evoked nothing but curiosity and a want to know more about her.</p><p>Instead of following the others through the Gate, Lilia lingered, and stopped in front of Rio who awkwardly met her gaze, eyes widening when Lilia affectionately patted her cheek. “Thank you for coming to get me out of that nightmare...<em>Rio.</em>” She smiled and went through the Gate, leaving Agatha and Rio alone.</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to hug her, still recovering from their time in the City of Judgement. And well sue her for not being able to focus on the larger threat when she was trying to process her own personal cataclysm.</p><p>“I’m sorry you have to deal with all this,” she decided to say. “That you had to lose and recreate your siblings.”</p><p>Rio shrugged awkwardly. “Believe it or not, stranger things have happened in the history of time.”</p><p>“On the bright side,” Agatha added. “You’re that much closer to revenge fucking my entire coven. Lilia would’ve been the hardest to convince, but going to do whatever you did for her while she was stuck, really seemed to have done the trick.”</p><p>Rio huffed a little chuckle, tilting her head, pretty brown eyes searching Agatha’s face. “You don't need to be nice to me because I cried in front of you.”</p><p>And yes, Agatha had seen Rio teary before. Had seen one or two drops silently fall across her cheeks. Had seen them on their wedding day, and when Nicky was born. More recently in her greenhouse. But Agatha had never seen Rio weep. Or mourn. Which meant that Rio had never felt she could be that vulnerable with her.</p><p>Her chest clenched in shame, and Agatha carefully reached up and cupped the same cheek Lilia had, grateful when Rio let her. “I need to do a lot more than be nice, because I made you cry,” she murmured, running a thumb across Rio’s smooth skin, and leaned forward to gently kiss her other cheek. “I’ll do better,” she promised and stepped through the Gate.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>They stepped into daylight and Agatha hummed, lifting her face toward a pale pink sky, no sun to be seen, but it was pleasantly warm in the little hamlet that sat nestled in a small valley surrounded by mossy blue mountains.</p><p>She bit her lip. The tiny village couldn’t be larger than six blocks. They were less than half a mile outside of it and a claustrophobic feeling settled in her gut when the Gate disappeared after Rio and her tiger cubs stepped out.</p><p>Since Rio appeared to be avoiding eye contact, Agatha decided to scan her surroundings more shrewdly, finding no exits or paths leading through the thick mountains. Any physical escape would require them to fly over the peaks and given their previous destinations, she had a sinking feeling that they were on yet another rock floating in endless space, and what was in front of them, was all there was to see for light-years.</p><p>She tested out her magic while the others excitedly took in the cobblestone paths lined with multicoloured flat-roofed oblong-shaped buildings of varying heights, looking like a Crayola town. The rowdy chatter of a crowded marketplace saturated the air, making it the liveliest area they’d been to by far.</p><p>A bad feeling crept into the pit of her stomach, or maybe it was the fact that Rio and Wanda had wandered off again, earnestly talking with their heads bent close. Granted, no one was smiling and smirking this time around. They didn’t seem aware of anyone else as the Twin cubs alternated pulling at the fabric of Rio’s magical robes and pouncing on each other as they played around her feet.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze stuck on Rio. Despite her avoidance, she seemed lighter after their conversation. Though Agatha still felt like vomiting whenever she thought about how badly she’d fucked up. She was determined to try and make up for it. Without expectation of more. There was a difference between being a bitch and being cruel. Rio had always preferred her a little mean, a little grumpy. But that was before Nicky, when things had been different. When Agatha had been different and Rio had been happy.</p><p>She’d grown entirely unsettled by the time Wanda and Rio made their way back to the group. So much so she hadn’t noticed that Alice and Jen had scouted ahead until they came back, smiling excitedly. The only person who had remained with her was Lilia, who stared at her with a soft and empathetic gaze that brought a knot to Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Lilia opened her mouth, but Rio and Wanda, and Jen and Alice all converged on them and Agatha released a breath, because who knew what the old crone was going to say.</p><p>“This is neutral ground,” Rio said without preamble. “Travellers come to this part of the Well Beyond Worlds to trade artefacts they’ve collected throughout the Outside. Many of the traders have translators equipped, so you’ll be able to communicate with them and may choose a magic item that calls to you, after which we can be on our way.” She pressed her tongue into her cheek, awkwardly not looking at any of them, and Agatha forgot the feeling of discomfort in favour of suppressing the intense urge to smother Rio to her chest.</p><p>Alice cleared her throat. “Uh, Rio, I mean, Dea—</p><p>“Rio’s fine.”</p><p>She exhaled and smiled. “Rio…don’t we need some form of currency to get magic stuff?”</p><p>“I’ll take care of it.”</p><p>“Really? Okay, because I’m a bit of a one-trick pony. Just shields and fire, and I’m getting good with the shields, right, Agatha?”</p><p>“You’re great at your shields.”</p><p>“So, I’m thinking a bit more blasting power? Maybe you could show me something that would help? I’m not really an expert on magical items.”</p><p>She was already walking down the path nudging Rio along, whose eyebrows were raised but she was walking with her, an amused smile pulling at her lips.</p><p>“Just think of me and I’ll come find you,” Rio called over her shoulder then focused back on Alice’s excited rambling. It was always great seeing Alice so animated. She’d been withdrawn since the previous evening after effectively losing her mother for a second time. Gloomy and depressed, much like she had been when Agatha had gone to recruit her at the mall four years ago. Relieved that they weren’t going to need to break Alice out of her shell again, Agatha hated her less for kidnapping Rio right in front of her face.</p><p>Instead, she rounded on Wanda and glared.</p><p>Wanda tilted her head. “I was asking her about Vis and the kids. Whether they’re in a better place.”</p><p>Agatha instantly felt like shit.</p><p>“Rio said she wasn’t allowed to tell me.”</p><p>“Yeah. You get used to it after a while. She takes her job seriously.”</p><p>“It’s a very serious job,” Lilia said.</p><p>“She was nice about it.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “That was a long talk for asking only that.”</p><p>“It was, wasn't it?”</p><p>Agatha scowled. Rio wouldn't really fuck Wanda, would she?</p><p>“Lilia, let’s go look around,” Wanda said, with a mischievous smirk and dragged Lilia off leaving a disgruntled Agatha and a highly amused Jen behind.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>It was probably a politically incorrect thing to think, but there were hundreds of alien <em>creatures</em> everywhere. Humanoid. Mostly bipedal. Some covered in fur. Some with multiple limbs and heads. Clothing optional. Genitals unknown as Agatha was many things, but understood it was rude to look. They ignored her and Jen stalking past them, instead standing around chatting in diverse groups, mulling in front of food and trinket stalls, and moving in and out of buildings that seemed to be shops with apartments up top.</p><p>They even passed a tavern and inn, the script on the tallish lime green building was in a language unknown to her, but the drunk and merry patrons with drinks in their hands transcended the language barrier. Usually, Agatha and Jen would’ve had a blast providing running commentary on the new sights and oddities, but Agatha was feeling some type of way and she wasn’t sure what would spill out if she opened her mouth.</p><p>“So…” Jen said.</p><p>Something familiar and inviting curled in Agatha’s stomach causing her to freeze in place. A raw and instinctive urge that had her nerve-endings firing hot. Her mouth watered and the hairs on her arms raised when the sweet yet sinister whispers tickled her brain. Her feet moved on autopilot, taking a sharp turn down one of the four streets and her magic greedily reached back to keep the connection.</p><p>“Okay…guess we’re not talking about the massive revelation of who your ex is,” Jen mumbled, but kept up pace, following her into a quaint little magic shop in a two-story, baby-blue building, where a bell rang as they entered. Enchantingly antiquated.</p><p>A well-dressed man stood behind an ornate cluttered counter, dressed in a tailored mauve suit with an emerald handkerchief in his jacket pocket, folded into a neat triangle.</p><p>“Greetings, Travellers!” he said with an enigmatic grin. A handsome tanned face with black salt and pepper hair was all Agatha took in as she stalked right passed him toward a display case in the back where a page of the Darkhold lay beneath the glass.</p><p>Jen came to a halt beside her. “Is that?”</p><p>“Yes…” Agatha breathed, trembling fingers pressed against the glass.</p><p>The page held the siphoning spell.</p><p>She tried to remember the promise she had made to herself. She was better now without the Darkhold in her life, no matter the hollowness in her chest. She had a coven, finally, because she wasn’t draining every witch she met of their magic. But she wanted it. Oh, Agatha craved that page more than anything. Needed it more than oxygen.</p><p>“You know, it's not everyone who can cast this particular spell,” The Proprietor said, appearing beside the case, flashing Agatha a stupidly charming smile. “Chthon was very specific about that.”</p><p>Agatha quivered, her magic flowing to the surface, settling glowing purple eyes on him to prevent herself from smashing the case and taking the page.</p><p>“Is that so?” she lowly said, looking him over, attempting to gauge whether he had enough magic to stop her. She sensed nothing and he held her gaze intently, kind brown eyes making Agatha falter slightly.</p><p>“Did you know the tale of the Darkhold is a Love Story?”</p><p>Agatha snorted. The absurd claim at least took away some of the intensity. She needed to relax. Maybe it was up for sale, though only an idiot would sell something that valuable.</p><p>“Not a believer in love?”</p><p> “She’s a lesbian,” Jen said. “She makes everything more complicated than it needs to be.”</p><p>Agatha turned to her with a raised brow. “She says as though she herself isn’t a lesbian currently in a complicated situationship.”</p><p>“Love is often complicated,” The Proprietor offered.</p><p>“Exactly,” Jen said.</p><p>“Shall I continue then?”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha shrugged, folded her arms, and rested on her heels, focused on the display case. On the page. She needed to touch it to use it. Attune to it. Meld it with her very essence.</p><p>“During the First Cosmos, there lived a mortal witch named Chthon.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze snapped to him. “Really? The Darkhold clearly states that Chthon was an evil male eldritch god.”</p><p>“Shh, Agatha. Let the man tell his story,” Jen piped up. “I haven’t had my daily dose of mindless entertainment to remind me that I’m not a freak and that everyone else is.”</p><p>“It’s been two days, Jen,” Agatha mumbled, despite both of them knowing that had they been home, she and Jen would’ve probably been smoking and snacking on the couch while they watched people pretending to fall in love for shit-money and two seconds of fame.</p><p>“Feels like forever,” Jen said. “Forgive my friend. Please continue.”</p><p>The Proprietor’s rich brown eyes sparkled gleefully. “Chthon lived a humble life, with dreams of protecting her family against the king’s soldiers ravaging their land. So she practised her magic every free moment she had. Which weren’t very many moments since she had a family of nine to help take care of after the kidnapping and murder of her mother.”</p><p>Jen—an only child—nodded sagely.</p><p>Agatha yawned without covering her mouth. Not because she needed to, but hoping to not be stuck there for much longer. She didn’t need a poorly made-up story to sell her on the Darkhold page, she already wanted it desperately. Maybe Rio would buy it for her. They’d been tasked to pick out something they wanted after all.</p><p>“One by one Chthon watched her family members be killed or succumb to illness because of the famine and violent oppression under the greedy king’s rule. And after she buried her six-year-old brother, and was all alone in the world, Chthon screamed to the heavens, drawing on her immense grief, and cursed the Mistress of Death for taking everything from her.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze narrowed on him and she ignored Jen’s eyes on her.</p><p>“Lady Death, who had heard many such curses and threats, decided to show herself to Chthon, angry to be blamed when she was simply a guide to the afterlife and had nothing to do with the illnesses caused or murders perpetrated on the king’s command. Chthon refused to listen and vowed to grow stronger and one day have her vengeance on Death, for if she did not exist, her family would not have perished.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. A likely story. Rio had often mentioned how many people blamed her for their loss.  For an extremely regretful period, Agatha had been one of them.</p><p>“Death went from annoyed to amused, and spent years taunting Chthon, only fuelling her arcane studies. And as Chthon grew stronger, as Death watched her take vengeance on the king and lay waste to his armies, that amusement turned to intrigue. They went from arguing during each meeting to playfully bantering and learning each other. Missing each other in between visits. And eventually, the affection they’d cultivated into a close friendship, turned into love.”</p><p>“Aw.” Jen clasped her hands to her chest while Agatha glowered. Rio hadn’t ever mentioned Chthon, despite Agatha having the Darkhold throughout their relationship, so the story was obviously a bald-faced lie. “Did she try to kill Death at any point?” Jen asked.</p><p>The Proprietor chuckled. “Chthon had known from the start that Death is infinite and cannot be undone. They had both used her quest for vengeance as an excuse to spend time together. Both so very lonely and in need of companionship.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Where does the Darkhold come in?” That was the only reason she was still listening. She couldn’t care less about Lady Death/Chthon fanfiction.</p><p>The Proprietor gave her a knowing look Agatha couldn’t decipher the meaning of so she scowled at him until he continued with a smug little smile.</p><p>“Because Death is everlasting, and Chthon loved her so very much, her energies went from pretending to want to kill Death, to attempting to live forever so she may walk beside her until the end of time. Thus, ensuring that Death would never be alone again. She created a spell that could siphon magic to grow her power. It stopped her ageing. And once she had time on her side, she began crafting her dark grimoire. A tether for her soul and the magic she accumulated over millennia. To ensure it would be indestructible, and to weave a very niche selection of spells, she created her own school of magic based on the dark eldritch principles she’d mastered.”</p><p>“Chaos magic,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>“Correct. Chthon then spread copies of her grimoire across the cosmos and while she held the original in her possession, she could feed on the poor souls who neglected to heed her warnings and tried to use the borrowed power of the Darkhold for their own gain. Because you see, only Chthon can wield the eldritch magic of her grimoire without being corrupted by it. Countless tried, but their magic and sanity were siphoned into the original Darkhold and toward Chthon. In so doing, she was able to elevate herself to divinity. And thus, the God of Chaos was born.”</p><p>“So Chthon was an evil bitch,” Agatha said.</p><p>“What was evil about her?” The Proprietor tilted his head. “The Darkhold clearly states what it is and what it seeks to do. Perhaps it’s those who seek that power despite the consequences who are the “evil” ones. Many a tyrannical magic user thinking themselves above the laws of the universe has succumbed to the Book of the Damned.” He held Agatha’s stare in challenge, then added as an aside, “the terms ‘good’ and ‘evil’ are so very reductive, though. And Chthon made evil look very endearing.”</p><p>Great. The Proprietor was a fangirl.</p><p>“Where is Chthon now?” Jen asked, while Agatha questioned everything about her and Rio’s relationship. Whether she was just some watered down reminder of the woman Rio had loved billions of years ago. It couldn’t be true. Rio was many things, but she wasn’t deceptive like that. She wouldn’t pretend to love someone she didn’t.</p><p>“And herein lies their love story,” the Proprietor said through a soft smile, eyes twinkling with clear fondness. Agatha went from scowling at the floor to scowling at his disgustingly handsome face. “Only a handful of entities may survive the destruction of the cosmos. Chthon could not reach Death’s immortality, but had grown powerful enough to imbue such indestructibility on her dark grimoire. And when the First Cosmos was shattered by the Celestials, splitting it into the Multiverse and all life was destroyed along with Death’s only love—</p><p>Agatha flinched at <em>only love</em>.</p><p>—and the aspect Eternity was reborn and life restarted once more, Chthon’s Darkhold manifested with it. And as it was read and its pages copied and distributed, the Darkhold fed on the magic of multiple users, giving form to Chthon’s eternal soul. And eventually that soul was reborn as a baby witch.”</p><p>Jen was eating it up and Agatha felt like throwing up.</p><p>“Death, of course, could only wait patiently for this process to complete, such was demanded of the Sacred Balance. But wait she did for her Chthon to grow, to find her Darkhold, and become the woman she loved once again. The real challenge, they discovered, was Death needing to make Chthon fall in love with her all over again while she waited for Chthon’s memories to return. So you see, the Darkhold is what binds Chthon and Death together for all eternity. They have found each other in each iteration of the cosmos, and some wonder if they’re together now in the eighth.”</p><p>“You’re lying,” Agatha hoarsely said.</p><p>“What purpose do I have to lie?”</p><p>If he wasn’t a liar, it meant that Rio was. And why would Rio withhold something like that from her? Was Agatha having a copy of the Darkhold what had drawn Rio to her? Was that the basis of their entire relationship? Was it so easy for Rio to leave after Agatha asked her to because Rio knew that they’d been doomed from the start? That Chthon would eventually come to break them up?</p><p>Was <em>Wanda</em> Chthon reincarnated? Was that why she and Rio hit it off so quickly? They’d so easily let go of whatever feelings they had for Agatha when they were made aware of each other. The Scarlet Witch had her own bloody chapter in the Darkhold. Wanda was the most likely candidate. The only being able to wield Chthon’s chaos magic in the known universe…</p><p>Agatha grew nauseous.</p><p>“If that were true, more people would know about it,” she rasped.</p><p>“Ask her yourself then,” The Proprietor said and fucking <em>winked</em>.</p><p>Agatha was about to strangle him because clearly, he was pretending to know Death personally and was most likely messing with her, but she felt Wanda’s magic surge from somewhere outside. Followed by booming explosions and bloodcurdling screams.</p><p>“Shit,” she said, purple gathered around her fist and slammed it against the glass of the display case, shattering it easily. She grabbed the page and the surge of eldritch magic nearly made her knees buckle. “Sorry, I’ll come square with you if we don’t all die.”</p><p>The page was enveloped in a purple glow, orbiting Agatha as she donned her shadowy purple witch’s garb, the rush of dark magic filling her like a tease. Delicious and still not nearly enough when compared to a copy of the Darkhold.</p><p>“Agatha?” Jen said uncertainly.</p><p>“Find the others. Stay together. I’ll go find Wanda,” she said, rushing toward the screams and chaos outside.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Attuned to the siphoning spell, Agatha was bombarded by the magical signatures of hundreds of spellcasters throughout the village. Yet she didn’t need to search for Wanda amongst them. Even blind and miles away she would have been able to sense Wanda’s chaos magic thrumming and pulsing. Throbbing throughout the tiny hamlet as the Scarlet Witch floated up in the air above the buildings.</p><p>Agatha frowned as a few yards from the Scarlet Witch, Wanda hovered, red chaos magic nestled in the arcs of her palms.</p><p>Locking eyes with her, Agatha rose into the sky, her fingers tragically pale and her magic nowhere near Wanda’s or that of the black magic emanating from the Scarlet Witch impostor.</p><p>“Agatha!” Wanda’s voice was pure relief as she shielded against a streak of red.</p><p>The Scarlet Witch didn’t even acknowledge Agatha’s arrival.</p><p>How humiliating.</p><p>“Told you we weren’t fighting each other!” Agatha shouted back.</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes, smothering a smile, and blasted the Scarlet Witch who waved the magic away like it was nothing.</p><p><em>‘You’re more powerful than her,’</em> Agatha telepathically said. ‘<em>She doesn</em><em>’t have chaos magic. She’s just a poor imitation.’ </em></p><p>All technically true, but Wanda was operating at about ten per cent of her power. Unwilling to use more in fear of losing herself.</p><p>Her words did the trick though, and Wanda’s confidence grew and her attacks picked up, making the impostor actually work to defend. And with it occupied, Agatha took in the village below, swirling portals of black had sprung up. Shadow creatures flying and crawling out of them and she watched as one enveloped an unsuspecting cyborg person, its entire body turning black and wraith-like, before it immediately pounced on a cowering Traveller to do the same to them.</p><p>“Shit,” she whispered. Looking up in time to see Wanda with a translucent crown around her face.</p><p>“Are you in the mood for some double penetration, Red?”</p><p>Wanda snorted, shaking her head with a grin, but synchronised her magic with Agatha’s, blasting the fake Scarlet Witch. Agatha had hoped to gain her attention, but she waved off her magic and focused on Wanda, as though she knew what retaliation against Agatha would mean.</p><p>She couldn’t even be relieved that this was most likely what Lilia had seen in her vision. Not when the screams were still echoing from below. Agatha was only keeping it together because she could feel the coven’s vibrant magic amongst the hoard of Travellers.</p><p><em>‘Let me know how we're doing, ladies,’</em> Agatha said through their link.</p><p>
<em>‘On the roof with Lilia. Yellow building. Jen shielding. I'm blasting.’</em>
</p><p>Agatha spotted them on a flat rooftop a hundred yards away, Rio standing with them, brows knitted as her eyes flickered over the portals. Having her with the coven made Agatha feel more at ease and she gathered her magic to focus back on the impostor. But then darkness fell, as though night had sneaked up on them.</p><p>Staring into the sky, Agatha’s stomach dropped and she froze at the gigantic person-shaped silhouette that loomed in the sky, body littered with burning stars, shadowed horns protruding from a featureless face. The air crackled with its raw power.</p><p>“Nothing can help you now,” the shadow’s smooth voice rolled over them, clear and crisp despite the screams sounding from below. “Your own systems have been corrupted. Turned against you. They will devour you from the inside out.” At the mountain peaks, a shield rose as though trying to form a dome around the entire valley. “And I will absorb what scraps are left of you, <em>Eternity</em>.” Agatha’s head snapped toward the rooftop where the tiger cubs had scampered beneath Rio’s robes, little scorpion tales sticking out. “And all will be as it was, long ago. Before your foul kind. Before the Multiverses. Eighth and Seventh...and Sixth...and Fifth...and back and back...dying and being born, over and over. Like filthy little organisms.”</p><p>Rio lifted her hands, long fingers curled and Agatha realised she was the one casting the shield, which had risen about halfway to closing over the village. She’d seen Rio put up shields instantaneously, the effort going into this one meant that the entity in the sky required that much to be deterred.</p><p>“We will return to a saner time,” it continued, drawing Agatha’s attention again, while Wanda continued to fight her evil twin. “When there was but one cosmos. One universe. One reality. One totality. When there was only I. The First Firmament. And soon...I will be the last.”</p><p>It lifted one of its gigantic arms, a shadowy spear appearing in its grip, and tossed it downward. The spear travelled like a bullet, fast on the release and growing smaller on its trajectory. Its other arm raised instantly, six times in rapid succession, six shadow spears leaving its grip before Rio’s shield closed and the First Firmament chuckled deeply, and dissipated, leaving behind a pale pink sky.</p><p>Agatha looked back to the rooftop and the world stopped.</p><p>Rio stood, blood seeping from her mouth and nose, four of the spears impaled in her chest, piercing out of her back. Jen and Alice held her upright while Lilia sheltered the Twins in her arms.</p><p>“<em>No</em>…” Agatha whispered, heart thundering in her ears, hand going to clutch at the locket around her neck.</p><p>Rio eyes fluttered closed, her body falling limp, Jen and Alice gently lowered with her. The spears faded and the cubs scrambled out of Lilia’s arms and ran to Rio, nudging at her lifeless body.</p><p>All Agatha could think was how much Nicky had looked like Rio and how Rio now looked like he had that morning.</p><p>Her magic crackled, a searing heat spread up her chest and neck. She was vaguely aware of the First Firmament’s shadows wreaking havoc across the hamlet, closing in on the building and the Twins, as though that had been their destination all along. They crawled up the walls and Alice rose from Rio’s side to continue blasting the wraiths that came flying toward them, closing in on the coven in a dark skittering wave.</p><p>Agatha called on the magic around her. Her hands elegantly shaped an almost familiar pattern, her lips moved in a whispered incantation. Purple strands of magic pulled taut between her fingers as she connected to all the magic users in the village. Her magic hooked onto their essences like fish at the end of a line. Eyes falling shut, overwhelmed at the multitude of sensations, she raised her arms in the air and reeled the magic toward her body.</p><p>The weaker Travellers fell instantly, Agatha trembling at the familiar and welcome rush of being filled. The black magic of the wraiths and crawlers followed, and she opened her eyes to watch as the wave of shadows ascending on the coven turned to ash that drifted away on the breeze. She moaned lewdly when the magic of the more powerful casters filled her, breathed in deeply when the coven’s magic joined theirs, and shuddered when Wanda’s chaos magic poured into her veins.</p><p>Her head lolled back and she cackled madly, tingling with a arousal, a rainbow of hundreds of magic streams entering her from across the hamlet, filling her to the brim and making her feel invincible. Her eyes flashed, glowing with power, and when Rio’s still body came into focus, Agatha screamed, spun around, and blasted purple lightning into the Scarlet Witch’s chest. A constant stream of pure concentrated magic entered the impostor and Agatha used its body as a conduit to chain the lighting toward the portals, destroying them and whatever had still been trying to crawl out.</p><p>It was exhilarating, devastating, as the magic nearly exploded out of her, her body unused to holding so much. The impostor was evaporated, along with every magical being in the hamlet…</p><p>Agatha hovered in the sky, chest heaving, and ears buzzing at the sudden deafening quiet.</p><p>A a jolt of panic, regret, and grief shocked her into action as she wildly turned to the rooftop and nearly fell from the sky in relief when she spotted the coven, weakened but alive. Wanda had joined them at some point. All of them looked as though they’d spent days crawling the desert without food and water. Pale and worried, but standing and not desiccated corpses.</p><p>Shaking with adrenaline, Agatha flew down to where Rio lay. Lilia and Alice held a whimpering tiger cub each and Jen was trying in vain to heal Rio’s chest where the spears had faded, and left behind black scorching burn marks.</p><p>And Rio…</p><p>Agatha fell to her knees and gently lifted Rio’s limp body into her arms, brushing her lips against a cool pale forehead.</p><p>“Darling?” Agatha croaked, brushing the hair from Rio’s face, unable to think clearly enough to know what to do. Her ouroboros were glowing brightly and she looked toward Rio’s disturbingly bare wrists.</p><p>An ache punctured her heart, so painful, she whimpered in agony.</p><p>“Apologies, Agatha's Coven,” Rio’s disembodied voice sounded from all around them and Agatha’s body unspooled with a relieved sob, shoulders shaking as tears ran down her cheeks. “It appears that birthing the Twins has drawn the attention of the First Firmament. I’ve opened a portal, if you could please enter and make your way to safety.”</p><p>No one moved, and Agatha was unable to, furiously trembling in relief.</p><p>“Agatha? Sweetheart?” Rio’s omnipresent voice gently caressed over her. “I’ll fix my body once I’ve taken care of a few things.”</p><p>Agatha sniffed and rose to her feet, lifting Rio’s body with her, unable to let go.</p><p>She scanned the hamlet, avoided looking at the coven, and instantly spotted the portal. It wasn’t a Gate, wobbling in a more circular shape, a black abyss centred instead of the glittering white they’d gotten used to. Agatha held Rio close, the adrenaline wearing off, the guilt that she’d taken the coven’s magic slowly rising. She hadn’t known she could siphon magic that way and had nearly killed them all in the process. That replayed in her mind and she didn’t have enough left in her to think about the appearance of the First Firmament and how powerful it was. How quickly its army had multiplied, and what it aimed to do to the cosmos. Didn’t want to think about how Wanda was Rio’s long-lost love reincarnate, and what to do with <em>that</em> information.</p><p>The Darkhold had never showed her the chaos magic spells. Only the dark magic that made her broody and intense. Like it was reserving those spells for someone else. For Wanda. And what would she do when Rio realised? She had to know who Wanda was already. What would Wanda do? What would Rio do? Would she lose them both? Would she fight for another chance with Rio? Should she? Was it fair? Had it been anyone other than Wanda... Wanda who stood back and didn’t complicate an already complicated situation to give Agatha a chance at happiness…</p><p>She shut the chaotic string of thought down and quietly followed the coven, only looking away once from Rio’s face and marred chest, to make sure that the cubs were with Lilia and Alice.</p><p>“I didn't even get to buy anything,” Jen grumpily mumbled as Agatha carefully carried Rio's body through the portal.</p><p align="center"> </p>

<p>They stepped into the entry hall of a mansion. Gothic chic, with elaborate candelabras of varying sizes hanging from a high ceiling and abstract greyscale paintings decorating dark stone walls.</p><p>On hearing Jen’s shriek, Agatha looked up from Rio's face and saw a skeleton standing in front of them wearing a red bow tie. Her lips twitched. Rio was hilarious. And then she looked back down—instinctively wanting to share in the joke—and all amusement left her.</p><p>“I am Bartol Utler,” the skeleton said in a ridiculously posh English accent. “Mistress has instructed me to escort you to the guest wing where you may rest. She will join you later.”</p><p>“It <em>speaks</em>,” Alice excitedly whispered. Surprised as though they hadn’t walked through a squadron of Rio’s Legion of the Doomed. Granted, none of those Undead had spoken to them and the coven had mistaken them for demons.</p><p>Bartol held out his bony arms as though waiting to receive Rio, and Agatha instinctively pulled her tighter against her chest, cradling her in a protective layer of magic. He simply lowered his arms and inclined his head, motioning with scraggy fingers toward a set of stained-glass doors—the only doors in the entry hall after the portal disappeared—before turning in that direction.</p><p>They followed him into the aforementioned guest wing, entering a lavish hallway that looked like a five-star hotel. Bartol walked into the first bedroom on the left, which was neat and decorated in a minimalist fashion, and that was all Agatha registered before she gently lay Rio on the queen-sized bed, sat down beside her and took hold of her too cold hand.</p><p>The First Firmament had the power to effortlessly pierce Rio’s mortal vessel. Agatha hadn’t ever seen Rio injured that way before, or so still and empty. She touched her fingers to Rio’s cool cheek, the way she’d touched Nicky. Even at six years old he’d been the spitting image of Rio.</p><p>Her breath caught, her chest tightened, and she pulled trembling fingers back to her lap continuing to clutch Rio’s hand, needing Rio to get back into her body before she lost her mind entirely.</p><p>The tiger cubs were placed on the bed, but as if they knew Rio wasn’t there, they darted to Agatha instead.</p><p>Rio was fine. She was certain of it, and still Agatha couldn’t leave her side.</p><p>“Bart, why don’t you show your mistress’s guests to where they’ll be staying,” she murmured. “I’ll remain with her vessel.”</p><p>“Of course, my lady,” he said and walked off.</p><p>Agatha felt Wanda’s hand on her shoulder and stiffened. Chaos magic trickled down her spine at the gentle squeeze that followed. She shuddered at the touch, relieved at how brief it was. Fighting down the surge of her own magic readying to attack.</p><p>She hadn’t been able to look at any of their gaunt features. Sick at the thought of what she’d done, nauseous at the idea of Chthon’s connection to Rio.</p><p>When the room was quiet, she settled beside Rio, curled up against her side, arm slung across her stomach, absently letting the cubs play with her hand. Exhausted from all that power entering and leaving her body, Agatha soon drifted off to sleep.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>She woke to an empty bed and an empty room. No Twins and no one else.</p><p>Laying on her back, she contemplated which emotional crisis to go deal with first. And unwilling to face Rio just yet, she got up with a sigh, walked into the hallway, and instantly heard the rowdy coven from somewhere down the corridor.</p><p>They were laughing and talking as though they hadn’t been attacked by a cosmic entity out to destroy literally everything, just a few hours ago. Like they didn’t have their magic stolen by someone they had trusted. There were only four of them, yet they always made every room feel full and alive.</p><p>She neared the area they were in, slowing her gait and walked through the doorway, wringing her hands and dragging her feet across the tiles. Stopping when a large Turkish style bath house came into view. Bright yellow walls and opulent gold furbishing greeted her. A domed ceiling was painted like a blue sky, brightening the multitudes of greenery spread across the space to create a lush oasis surrounding an Olympic sized pool.</p><p>Rio loved water. Loved swimming. She would go diving in the ocean and spend hours down there exploring. Agatha wasn’t a fan, and had usually waited for her reading on the shore or floating on a boat. Bath houses and bathtubs though, she’d always joined Rio in those.</p><p>Before she could get lost in the pleasant memories, Agatha’s gaze landed on the coven who thankfully appeared physically recovered. They hadn’t noticed her hovering as they lounged on comfy chairs instead of being in the water. Bartol Utler was there too, serving wine and snacks and Agatha wanted to smile at their smiles, but her stomach twisted and she took a few steps into view, standing at the pool’s edge opposite to where they were seated across the expanse of crystal-clear water.</p><p>“Agatha!” Jen grinned. “How’s Rio’s body doing?”</p><p>Her heart clenched at the genuine query. Rio had made such a big impression on all of them in such a short time.</p><p>“Uh, fine. She’ll be fine.”</p><p>“We can ask for literally anything and Bartol brings it!” Alice said, holding up a garish diamond encrusted Patek Phillipe watch on her wrist.</p><p>Agatha licked her lips and ran a shaky hand through her hair. “Uhm…”</p><p>They frowned, smiles falling from their faces, worriedly looking at her.</p><p>“Agatha?” Wanda asked.</p><p>From the plants on either side of Agatha, two red imps came flying toward her body. Agatha remarkably recognised them and caught the Twins in her arms. They nuzzled into her neck and she held them to her chest, careful of their bat-like wings, her shoulders loosening as she inhaled the subtle scent of woodfire and petrichor.</p><p>The coven looked on in a mixture of awe and amusement.</p><p>“I wanted to apologise,” Agatha mumbled, rubbing her chin against Infinity’s smooth bald head. “For siphoning your magic.”</p><p>“Oh,” Alice said. “That’s okay.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Jen shrugged.</p><p>Lilia and Wanda nodded.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What?”</p><p>“No need to apologise,” Jen said. “Desperate times and all that.”</p><p>“Desperate times…” Agatha said, dumbfounded. “I killed a few hundred people…and other things.”</p><p>“Unfortunate for them,” Lilia said. “But you didn’t kill us.”</p><p>Everyone nodded and Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Seriously?”</p><p>“Yes,” Jen said. “Next time, definitely ask, but we understand that those were extenuating circumstances. With monsters everywhere, Rio getting speared with shadowy magic, Wanda fighting her evil doppelganger, the cosmic entity who wants to destroy everything appearing in the sky, and all that.”</p><p>“I nearly passed out,” Alice mumbled. Lilia nodded along, nibbling a piece of mango, looking disturbed.</p><p>“You saved us,” Wanda said, smiling broadly, eyes crinkling with affection.</p><p>“Could you always do that?” Lilia asked. “I thought you were only able to take magic when attacked.”</p><p>Agatha was great at adjusting spells, but to do so required research and time. Siphoning in that manner, the instinctive way she’d known the incantation and hand gestures to pull the magic toward her…It had to have been the page that was different. She would need to study it more closely later.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “No. That was new. I didn’t know I could do it either.”</p><p>“It certainly did the trick,” Wanda said. “Those shadows were closing in on the coven.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the water, unable to comprehend why they didn’t hate her. She’d done far less and had been met with scorn and judgement.</p><p>“Agatha.” Lilia stared at her with that unsettling matriarchal look she got from time to time. “Do you know why we didn’t lose our minds when we arrived in the Outside?”</p><p>“Because you didn’t understand enough to lose your minds?”</p><p>“Because you assured us that we would be safe with Rio. And do you know why we accepted that Rio would lead us out?”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>“Because you were the one telling us to accept it.”</p><p>“You don’t ever listen to me. You argue with me all the time. You questioned me about Rio repeatedly.”</p><p>“We listen when it matters,” Lilia said. “Though we also enjoy riling you up.” All of them cackled merrily and Agatha rolled her eyes. Lilia continued. “We aren’t lonely or scared and struggling anymore, because <em>you</em> brought us together. We finally feel powerful because <em>you </em>are in this coven with us. You make us feel safe to be who we are, and that, my dear friend, is something none of us had experienced in a very long time.”</p><p>Agatha’s neck and cheeks burned and she awkwardly shifted in place. “Shut up,” she said, swallowing down the knot in her throat, glancing away from Wanda softly staring at her. “Don’t be disgusting,” she muttered. But walked closer to them, gently holding the imps who were dozing on her shoulders, warmth filling her for everyone in that room.</p><p>How humiliating.</p><p>She went to sit in the chair diagonally from Jen and Wanda on a two-seater. Wanda stared at the imp Twins like Agatha had seen her staring at babies. Like she wanted to abduct them from their mothers and raise them as her own.</p><p>A twinge of empathy caused by the knowledge of Wanda’s loss had Agatha offering Eternity to her, his blue eyes drowsy with sleepiness, a tiny red thumb in his mouth. Wanda took him so very carefully and sat back, revealing Jen with outstretched arms. Agatha sighed and handed Infinity to her.</p><p>Feeling empty and exposed, she summoned Scratchy onto her lap causing Jen and Wanda to slowly shift further away.</p><p>Lilia snorted. “Bunch of brooding hens.”</p><p>Alice stared at Jen, lips parted and eyes rounded in wonderment, before she shook her head and cleared her throat. “So, what was your judgement about, Lilia? We never got a chance to ask.”</p><p>“I was wrong about my biggest fear,” Lilia said, eyes growing distant. “I thought it was death. Everyone I cared about died. The people I tried to warn with my visions all died. It felt like a curse, as though Death was chasing me...Rio helped me understand that Death doesn't come for people, she simply waits for them to come to her.”</p><p>Agatha hummed softly, petting Scratchy, whilst staring at the Twins.</p><p>“It was enough for the city that I finally accepted that it wasn't my responsibility to save those who died not heeding my warnings. That sometimes, people died simply because it was their time.”</p><p>Everyone fell silent, having all suffered loss. Having had blamed Death themselves, and fought to change the outcome. Agatha hadn’t realised that Lilia carried that fear with her. Though understood now why she’d been such a recluse when Agatha had found her and had to harass her into joining the coven.</p><p>“Okay…” Jen said when the melancholy silence stretched for far too long. “Speaking of Rio…”</p><p>Agatha stiffened.</p><p>“Yeah,” Alice agreed. “Glad she’s safe and all but are we going to need to go beat her up for the Chthon thing?”</p><p>“Of course Jen told you.”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I? Personally, I think it’s just a made-up story. But there was something weird about that guy at the shop.”</p><p>Agatha certainly agreed with the part about The Proprietor.</p><p>“Having a whole secret soulmate and not telling you doesn’t seem like something she would do given how she is about you,” Wanda said.</p><p>Heat burned in Agatha’s belly, her hackles rising. “You’ve known her for all of five seconds.”</p><p>“Fair enough. Do <em>you</em> think it’s something she would do?”</p><p>Agatha fought down the irrational part of her that wanted to lash out, jaw tight with the effort. “The only truth we know is that Chthon created chaos magic and there’s only one being in the known universe who has it.”</p><p>She glared at Wanda who at first looked confused and then it dawned on her and her lips parted. “You can’t seriously think I’m Chthon, Agatha,” she harshly whispered.</p><p>Jen gasped at the revelation.</p><p>“You wouldn’t know it if you were.”</p><p>“It’s a stupid story. Rio’s clearly crazy about you.”</p><p>“Because <em>Chthon</em>,” she pointed accusingly at Wanda, purple sparking in her hand, “hasn’t remembered yet.”</p><p>“No,” Wanda said, looking perturbed as she cradled Eternity to her and got up as though she wanted to get away from Agatha. “Get that out of your head right now before you self-sabotage all of the progress you’ve made.”</p><p>Agatha averted her gaze, shoulders stiff, and petted Scratch, who for once didn’t fight her smothering him with desperate affection.</p><p>“Wanda’s right,” Lilia carefully said. “Go ask Rio instead of us sitting here speculating over gossip. We’ll look after the kids.”</p><p>“It could just be the First Firmament messing with you to try and fuck with Rio,” Jen said.</p><p>“The First Firmament also created a copy of the <em>Scarlet Witch</em> and not me,” Agatha muttered, but rose from her seat and placed Scratch down onto it to keep an eye on the Twins. She then walked out of the bath house not because she wanted to go clarify anything, but needing to go give Rio a piece of her mind.</p><p>“Agatha don’t leave us alone with your demon rabbit!” Jen loudly hissed after her.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Agatha had always wondered why Rio had chosen her. They’d met when she was a young adult who’d just killed her mother and coven and was slowly falling off the deep-end. Why else would someone like Rio have taken an interest in her? It certainly wasn’t because of her sparkling personality. She’d been remarkable only because of the copy of the Darkhold she’d held.</p><p> Grateful for the siphoning page, she donned her witch’s garb like armour, draping herself in the shadowy shades of purple that made her feel powerful. Puffing up and growing her hair in a way she knew would leave Rio weak.</p><p>The elegant foyer of Death’s Dark Palace contained only the glass door to the guest wing. And the guest wing only held their rooms, the bath house, a dining room, and a lounge and bar leading out onto a gorgeous terrace overlooking a pitch-black lake.</p><p>Scowling, Agatha used her ouroboros to sense Rio, contemplating teleporting to her, but wanted Rio to feel her coming.</p><p>A grey door appeared in front of her.</p><p>Agatha clenched a fist and opened the door with her other hand. It led into a wine-red hallway lined with framed photographs of landscapes from alien planets. Some bright and colourful, others monochromatic, depicting various biomes beneath large moons and suns, burning stars and bright constellations.</p><p>Refusing to get distracted by the stunning pictures, she marched down the corridor to the green door that appeared at the end, entering a massive hall that looked like a cathedral. Or rather, a museum as there were various displays containing large statues featuring different species of alien races dressed in foreign regalia. Below each statue were smaller displays of bladed weapons and instruments. Some held futuristic gadgets and trinkets, others were more primitive containing stone tablets and carved ornaments.</p><p>It was mesmerising. The room appeared to stretch endlessly, and Agatha was enraptured as she walked toward a harp-like string instrument, three times her size at the foot of a statue of an amphibian-like being.</p><p>She ran a finger across the strings, closing her eyes at the soothing acoustics that filtered around the room while she experimentally plucked in search of familiar keys… Then she froze. Her eyes flashed open and she growled under her breath because Rio had led her there to calm her down. To distract her from her anger.</p><p>She pushed her annoyance through her ouroboros and went in search of a door that appeared a moment later right in front of her. Her anger reignited at the audacity, that Rio’s plan had nearly worked, and flipped her hair, clenched her jaw, and reached for the handle.</p><p>The second she touched it, Agatha felt a tug in her stomach then found herself standing in a beautiful greenhouse, outside a set of charcoal double doors made of embossed and hammered iron, decorated with Neo-Renaissance motifs, Rio’s presence calling to her from the other side.</p><p>Growing angrier that she’d been summoned, Agatha magically flung the doors open and marched into a sleek modern bedroom. One wall was made entirely of glass and a large full moon shone above a dark forest and rolling grey hilltops, bathing the interior in a silvery glow.</p><p>Across the entryway, a king-sized bed was decorated with dark sheets and covers and above the black slat headboard, against a blue-grey wall, another landscape photograph spread the width of it. A burning red sunset over a shadowy world, brilliant purple lava flowing through cracks in a black mountainous region.</p><p>In one corner a dark side-table held a pale clay pot filled with soil containing silver-white roses that bloomed and sparkled beneath the moonlight.</p><p> Rio stood at a wet bar near the window pouring amber liquid from a decanter into a crystal tumbler. Barefoot and dressed in green plaid pyjama pants and a black tank top. She turned, took a sip of her drink, and leaned her hip against the backrest of a white recliner, no doubt placed there to stare out at the beauty of the endless night in the Realm of Death.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze fell to the smooth unmarred skin on Rio’s chest where the spears had pierced and burned her, then travelled down to make sure that the ouroboros tattoos were indeed back where they belonged. They glowed a pretty purple and moved under Agatha’s attention.</p><p>“I don’t remember signing a prenup,” Agatha lowly said, still frozen a foot inside the doorway. “Does it mean half of this labyrinthine house is mine?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>She remembered asking Rio about past lovers. Rio had said that Agatha was the first mortal she’d been with.</p><p>
<em>Liar.</em>
</p><p>Or was she simply playing with the truth since Chthon  was technically a god and not a mortal…</p><p>Agatha’s eyes watered with hurt she struggled to push down, and she tried to keep hold of her anger instead. “Why do you need a bed when you don’t sleep?”</p><p>“Sometimes I enjoy laying down when I masturbate thinking of you.”</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek—forcing away the image of Rio on that bed with her legs spread apart and her hand working between her thighs—simply refusing to be horny. Not when Rio’s betrayal was still lodged in her chest, making it painful to breathe.</p><p>She averted her gaze from Rio’s curious and twinkling eyes and stepped further into the room,  magically slamming the doors shut behind her, and walked toward the foot of the bed to stare at the familiar looking photograph.</p><p>“You’re into photography, now?” she asked, finally recognising how similar in style the photographs were to the beautiful paintings in the villa.</p><p>“Always have been.”</p><p>“And just decided not to tell me? What else have you been hiding?”</p><p>“I could hardly show you my camera from another world and another time in the 1700s, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha breathed through her nose, needing to be angry and not sad. Rio was a liar. Rio had made her feel like shit for supposedly cheating whilst hiding an entire soulmate from her.</p><p>“Who the fuck is Chthon?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed, guilt washed across her features. Quickly, yet Agatha knew the meaning of every minute expression on Rio’s gorgeous face. Had learned them and studied them for decades because Rio had been her world. Her everything. And she didn’t need to confirm it, Chthon meant something to Rio. Agatha’s heart dropped like a rock to the pit of her stomach.</p><p>“Author of the Darkhold,” Rio said.</p><p>“Who is Chthon to you?”</p><p>Rio placed her glass down on the wet bar and straightened her spine. “Why are you asking me this?”</p><p>“Why aren’t you answering a simple question?”</p><p>“What do you think you know, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted painfully. “When were you going to tell me that you had this big love of your eternal life that you find in each of her reincarnations to make her fall in love with you over and over again?”</p><p>Rio’s tongue poked into her cheek and she shoved her hands into her pants pockets looking angry. “Oh. So now I’m going to need to know who told you that.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because there are only a handful of people in the entire cosmos who would tell that story.”</p><p>“So it’s true.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed. “Who told you, Agatha?”</p><p>“Some guy at a magic shop.”</p><p>“Some guy?”</p><p>“Yes, <em>some guy</em>, which doesn’t matter. Is it true?”</p><p>Rio locked their eyes defiantly. “Yes.”</p><p>“So what was I?” Agatha’s voice cracked and she swallowed thickly. “A place holder until you found her again?”</p><p>Rio shook her head and walked closer, pretty, brown eyes glimmering. “Agatha…” she murmured, and took hold of Agatha’s waist, making her squirm.</p><p>Agatha placed her hands on Rio’s shoulders, trying to push her away but couldn’t quite manage to put much strength behind it.</p><p>“Don’t look at me like that,” Agatha croaked, feeling weak and needing Rio close. Wanting to tell her to fuck off. Needing it to be a lie. She blinked rapidly, trying to stop the sting of tears in her eyes.</p><p>“How haven’t you figured it out, yet?”</p><p>“I figured it out. Wanda’s Chthon.”</p><p>Rio barked out a laugh. “What? <em>No</em>.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>“You are Chthon.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. Chuckled. Stared at Rio’s tender and earnest expression. Then scowled and roughly pushed out of those lovely toned arms.</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>, don’t fuck with me right now.”</p><p>“What reason do I have to lie to you about this?”</p><p>“I dunno, payback for the emotional torture I put you through?”</p><p>Rio flinched and Agatha cringed. “Sorry,” she mumbled. “I know you wouldn’t. I meant it more that I would deserve it.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t deserve it.”</p><p>Knees growing weak, Agatha went to sit on the edge of the bed and ran a hand through her hair. “It’s Wanda.”</p><p>Rio pulled a face. “I guess she would make sense given how little you know.”</p><p>“She’s linked to the Darkhold. I don’t have any chaos magic at all.”</p><p>“You have plenty of chaos magic. You probably have ninety per cent of all chaos magic in existence. Ever.”</p><p>Agatha could only stare at her, unable to fathom why Rio would make up something so preposterous. So hurtful. She’d suspected Wanda yes, but mostly she’d gone there for Rio to tell her that it was fiction. A lie. That Chthon was what the Darkhold said and the Death fandom was just pairing Rio up with random powerful beings.</p><p>“Agatha, we’ve established that it’s not a good thing to have chaos magic without knowing how to wield it, which is why you currently don’t have access to yours.” Rio’s mouth twisted angrily. “<em>Wanda</em> appears to be a failsafe.”</p><p>“For?”</p><p>She scowled. “I can only assume since you and your book like to hide things you know I won’t approve of, that she’s meant to receive your soul should something go wrong with your current body. I can’t believe you would do this when you know it goes against—</p><p>“Hey! <em>I </em>didn’t do anything.”</p><p>Rio deflated, still frowning. “We’ll revisit this later. I’ll also be having a word with the Darkhold.”</p><p>“It’s sentient?”</p><p>“Oh, yes.” Rio’s expression grew fond, as though she actually liked the Darkhold. Before, she’d expressed no interest in the copy Agatha had. Agatha couldn’t recall whether Rio had ever even touched it or held it or read it. She’d never asked about it…</p><p>“Why aren't you mad at Chthon for reincarnating but you’re mad about the Wanda back-up body thing?”</p><p>“You die and are reborn as part of the Natural Order, which is why we have to wait billions of years to be reunited in each iteration of the cosmos. Your soul doesn’t wander about upsetting the Sacred Balance. The Wanda thing would be you hijacking bodies. Cheating death. Cheating me. Always a cheater.”</p><p>“Rio, come on.”</p><p>Rio pouted. “Sorry.”</p><p>“So do I have her body? And when you get her back, I disappear?”</p><p>“You are her. You are you.”</p><p>“I’m struggling to understand why you’d lie about something that makes so little sense.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t lie to you, especially not about something like this. But I understand that it’s a lot to take in, so there might be something that can help,” she said and pulled her knife. The thin jade patterns across the black blade seemed to gleam brighter in the Realm of Death. “Come on.”</p><p>Agatha hesitantly rose from the bed when a white door with a purple, black and white star tetrahedron symbol on it, appeared in the bedroom. She tried to identify what she was feeling. Attempted to process the absurd things coming out of Rio’s mouth. Rio had never treated her like she was naive or dumb, so to expect her to just believe something so unbelievable…There had to be a catch. Something she was missing.</p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>“You asked me to bring you here after I told you who you are.”</p><p>What an absolutely insane sentence to hear.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, and stalked through the door and into a blinding white room. Large tiled floors and walls, even the ceiling was sectioned into blocks. A perfect empty cube that looked about thirty by thirty feet with a red tiled square in the centre providing the only alternate colour.</p><p>“You’ll need this,” Rio said, twirling her fingers like she was doing a coin trick and a small flat metallic disc the size of an M&amp;M appeared between her fingertips.</p><p>Rio lifted her hand, stepping in close, and Agatha inhaled sharply, tasting the scent of apple from Rio’s lips. She suppressed a smile that Rio had been sipping apple juice from her wetbar like it was a fine cognac—unsurprising, yet still so endearing—and tried not to stare at the way her long dark lashes lay atop her cheeks.</p><p>She was supposed to be angry.</p><p>The disc was placed behind Agatha’s ear, cool beneath Rio’s warm fingertip and then a slight sting followed, before she felt nothing at all.</p><p>“It’s a translator,” Rio said, taking a step back, allowing Agatha to breathe and think clearly again. “You weren’t sure what language you’d be speaking so this will help you understand.”</p><p>“Understand what?”</p><p>“Not sure.”</p><p>“You don’t know?”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“She didn’t tell you?”</p><p>“No, you didn’t tell me.”</p><p>“And you’re just bringing me in here? What if it’s a trap?”</p><p>“Are you asking me whether I think you set a trap for yourself?”</p><p>“What if she forces herself into my mind and possesses me?”</p><p>“You’re talking about yourself. And that’s not how it works. There’s only one way to regain your memories and you won’t lose any of who you are now when you do. You’ll simply remember your past.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms and squeezed her biceps. “What if I don’t want to know?”</p><p>Rio visibly flinched before quickly regaining her composure. “That will be your choice,” she thickly said.</p><p>“You want me to be her instead, don’t you?”</p><p>“I want you to understand that nothing will happen to you unexpectedly. That you may do this at your own pace. We can leave if you’re uncomfortable.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Why wouldn’t you just tell me, Rio? That’s why I can’t believe any of this. It makes no sense for you to not tell me this extremely big thing. Nothing I know about you has led me to believe that you would purposefully keep this from me.”</p><p>“What did you expect me to do? Come find you as a baby, abduct you, and raise you to be my wife?” She grimaced. “Tell you who you are from my point of view instead of letting you discover that for yourself?”</p><p>“So what, you wait around every time until I’m ripe and ready?”</p><p>“Don’t turn this into something vile.”</p><p>“It’s strange that you’re going with this absurd story. There must be something worse you can’t tell me.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “This is the seventh time we’re having this conversation. No matter how powerful you are, during each destruction you are a casualty to the void that follows. As you may have noticed, too many cosmic entities are either nihilistic or power hungry. Or a deadly combination of both. Constantly fighting over control like toddlers with a toy they eventually break with their greed and entitlement.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her fingers into her hair, wanting to pull it out by the roots. “This is <em>insane</em>, Rio.”</p><p>“Which is why I never tell you and wait for you to start poking around for answers. It’s always easier to let you figure it out yourself. You created the Darkhold to guide you through that process.”</p><p>“And these?” She held up her wrists. “They’re obviously different to the usual hand-fasting tattoos. Do they have something to do with Chthon?”</p><p>“My creator married us during the First Cosmos, so they’re pretty permanent. Eternity just allowed you to see them when we got married this time round. They <em>are</em> hand-fasting tattoos. A symbol of our love and commitment.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure what she felt other than disbelief and suspicion. And ridiculous because she knew Rio wouldn’t lie about something like this. She wouldn’t be so cruel…</p><p>“Do I look the same?”</p><p>“Yes. Which is why I’ve come to favour this form.” Rio motioned to her own face and then softly smiled. “You have this way of looking at me I can’t wait to see again in each iteration.”</p><p>“I do? How?”</p><p>“Do you remember when we visited <em>Hierve el Agua</em>? You'd just turned five and twenty.”</p><p>“Still a virgin nerd by the way, no thanks to you.”</p><p>Rio grinned, her eyes crinkling and Agatha's heart soared at the look and the memory.</p><p>“You’ve always loved the mountains.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, having longed for them throughout the day.</p><p>“That was the first time you looked at me like that again. Your eyes were the colour of the sky and it felt like I finally got you back...” Rio’s smile fell away, and she grew taut, then cleared her throat. “Anyway,” she said motioning to the red square, but Agatha remained rooted in place. Watching her.</p><p>She remembered that day clearly. Remembered feeling so confident that she would love Rio forever. Come what may. She'd most likely stopped looking at Rio ‘that way’ after Nicky died. When she’d buried her heart with him and the world had faded to nothing. When she’d felt only pain and rage, unable to recognise anything good that still existed around her.</p><p>“Do we…do you have children with her?”</p><p>Rio smiled sadly. “Nicky was…a miracle, our only one. We’ve spoken about it. We revisit it often. We conclude each time that no parent should outlive their child. We worry of the enemies that might use them against us. Might hurt them because of us… It’s always been a tough conversation to have.”</p><p>
<em>I wish you would remember.</em>
</p><p>The words Rio had spoken in the City of Judgement hit Agatha like a freight train. Whispered with such anguish that Agatha had no choice but to believe. Her heart skipped and thudded against her chest and in her brain.</p><p>“If this is true, Rio, why couldn’t Nicky also—</p><p>Agatha paused when Rio’s shook her head. “There’s a lot of magic involved. A lot of preparation. Of your body. Your mind. The binding of your soul. The sacrifices you made…The things you did…The pain you endured…You shouldn’t have been able to survive half the things—we argued often. Separated a few times because of it. You of course were too stubborn to fail. What you accomplished, I doubt it can ever be replicated. But even so, my love…Even if it was an easy thing…Nicky would have been stillborn…I used my power to give you as much time as I could without compromising his soul.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart cracked but she nodded, she’d known that.</p><p>“When I said there was nothing more we could do, there was nothing more we could do. I swear that, Agatha. Please believe me.”</p><p>“I know, I know,” Agatha wetly sniffed. “I’m sorry, I know.”</p><p>Rio softly looked at her and Agatha inhaled shakily. “Okay,” she murmured and went to stand on the red square, knees trembling, chest aching and shoulders so tense it hurt.</p><p>“I’ll leave you to it, then,” Rio rasped and turned toward the door.</p><p>“<em>What</em>? You’re not staying?”</p><p>“You asked me not to.”</p><p>“And you just do whatever she says, even if I might be in danger?”</p><p>The room was creepy, far too white and bright. The red square felt sinister. Like a bullseye target.</p><p>“When it comes to this, <em>you</em> decide what’s best for you. I don’t interfere.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Tell the coven not to cremate my body. I want to be embalmed and immortalised in a pyramid.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Noted. The door will appear again when you step off the red square. Have fun.”</p><p>And then she just left. Abandoned Agatha in an asylum cell. How apt.</p><p>But, the moment the door vanished, the room began to change. A plush carpet shimmered into existence around the infernal red square. Floor to ceiling bookshelves appeared along the walls to her sides packed with tomes. A fireplace with roaring purple flames was ahead, nestled between two large windows revealing the familiar moonlit backdrop of the Realm of Death.</p><p>Fiddleleaf fig plants, ferns, monstera and evergreens hung in pots from the windows and ceiling, some familiar, some alien. Succulents were potted and spaced in designer compartments between the bookshelves, and planted in tall ceramic urns tastefully scattered around the room. In one corner, the Darkhold lay on an obsidian pedestal. Shadowy purple flames licked across the cover, violet embers glowed along the page edges. Agatha could tell it was the original simply from the sheer size of the tome. Despite it not being centred, it still called attention to itself. She could practically hear the whispers in her head…</p><p>A black winged back chair materialised directly in front of her, and Agatha’s lips parted at the woman seated on it. Legs crossed at the knee, wearing a pair of tall heeled boots with a black tailored suit, violet material peaking from crisp cuffs and below a sharp mandarin collar. Her hair was long, dark and wavy, a thick white streak framing one side of her face. Pitch black fingers elegantly propped beneath a familiar chin, emerald ouroboros swirling around a delicate wrist. A smug smirk spread on the woman’s features when glittering purple irises settled directly on Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Hello me,” Chthon said, her voice an octave lower and Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>The likeness was uncanny and had her heart pounding in panic.</p><p>Chthon flipped her hair. “Have you finished taking in how absolutely stunning you are?”</p><p>Agatha needed to leave.</p><p>“Please resist the urge to move from the red square. Having to replay my theatrical reveal will ruin the entire effect.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, but remained in place. She has always appreciated a good theatrical reveal.</p><p>“Since I do not know what they have chosen to call you, I will refer to you as Eight… I am certain that even seeing yourself right now, you are tempted to not believe. To run from the truth staring you right in the eyes.”</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through her hair, then brushed her fingertips down her face. Chthon looked a few years younger than her, though she carried herself like she was much older.</p><p>“I will give you no answers, Eight. I cannot know what time period you are in or which planet you are on. Most of the multiverse Earths have always been slow to evolve and quick to destroy. For all I know you have been running around a cave dressed in a loincloth with your tits wobbling about.”</p><p>Agatha snorted an identical chuckle to Chthon, whose eyes grew softer, fonder. “My beloved would certainly have a grand time with that. I trust you have been good to her,” she said, a sharp glint of warning flashing in her eyes and Agatha’s chest constricted painfully. “This is harder on her than it is on me…”</p><p>Her shoulders drooped, and her lips turned down. “At times I wonder if what I am doing is even more selfish than I realise. That perhaps I should die permanently and allow her the chance to move on. To be free of this cycle. Of needing to wait for me for so very long each time…”</p><p>A triangular glass filled with red liquid appeared in Chthon’s hand and she took a slow sip. Agatha wished she could have a drink too.</p><p>“When you are you,” Chthon said, staring at the ice cubes bobbing in her drink. “When you have what you have, even forever will never feel like enough. You are greedy. You want. You take. It is in your nature. In your magic. In the way you love… People dislike you. They hate you. They fear you… <em>Never</em> bend to those who do not matter, Eight.”</p><p>Chthon balanced the drink on the arm of her chair, long obsidian fingers playing around the rim.</p><p>“When I am reborn, there are two things I intrinsically crave: The Darkhold and Death. I have vowed to remain worthy of the power and love they give me. A simple concept to remember. A simplified way to live an extraordinary life. It won’t surprise you that I have no regrets. I am who I want to be. I am who my beloved wants. You have worked hard to become who you are. You deserve to remember. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled…But we are not always kind to ourselves, are we, Eight?”</p><p>She smiled self-deprecatingly, and took another slow sip of her drink, the room quiet save for the crackling of the fire and the ice cubes clinking against her glass.</p><p>“I have left you no more messages. My purpose here is not to sway you any particular way, but to assist you in believing that you have heard the truth. That you have spent lifetimes achieving grandeur and immortality because you lost your heart to a perfect being you cannot bear to be parted from. Going forward, you will learn a great many things about yourself. Not all your memories will be pleasant, but oh, what a journey it has been…” She trailed off and then smirked devilishly. “I will leave you with this, a delicious treat to look forward to. When you have the opportunity to regain access to your power, our beloved will offer to assist you in that process. Accept her aid with fervour, Eight. Allow her to guide you in whichever way she pleases.”</p><p>“Chthon?”</p><p>Agatha spun around as Rio walked into the recording. Rio of the past, dressed in a long flowing black evening gown. Strapless and fitted around the chest and bodice but tapering around the hips, flowing like water into an elegant train that disintegrated into tiny fluttering leaves with each step she took.</p><p>Her hair was longer than Agatha had ever seen it, her skin that lovely gold that Agatha loved. Her purple ouroboros stood stark against her wrists and her bare feet padded lightly across the carpet.</p><p>Agatha looked back at Chthon who was taking Rio in like she was everything good and precious in the world.</p><p>“We are going to be late, my love,” Rio said, easily letting herself be pulled side-saddle onto Chthon’s lap.</p><p>Brown eyes shifted in Agatha’s direction, brows furrowed, and Agatha’s breath caught, forgetting for a moment that it was only a simulation, that Rio was most likely looking at the recording device and not her.</p><p>She was softer in the past. Happier. Like those days when they had travelled the world together, but more so. Agatha could see now that Rio had remained somewhat guarded even when things had been great between them.</p><p>This Rio though…</p><p>“Have I interrupted one of your schemes?” Rio asked, wrapping her beautiful arms around Chthon’s neck, and black fingers possessively settled on Rio’s waist.</p><p>A jarring jolt of jealousy hit Agatha out of nowhere, making her feel both enraged and absurd.</p><p>And why was it Rio’s presence that made it feel all too real?</p><p>“I thought you did not wish to know of my schemes, darling?”</p><p>“True. Carry on then. I will leave without you.”</p><p>Rio made no move to leave, though, instead her fingers threaded into Chthon’s hair and Agatha shivered at the phantom fingers her mind conjured against her own needy skull.</p><p>Chthon grinned at Rio’s mischievous smirk and pressed their mouths together. Agatha’s fists clenched, but she couldn’t glance away from how good they looked together. How Rio melted into Chthon and smiled into the kiss. It wasn’t even lewd, just breathtakingly—achingly—intimate.</p><p>Purple eyes flashed open, meeting her gaze, and Agatha was certain Chthon had forgotten what she’d been doing before Rio’s arrival, because, with her lips still pressed to Rio’s, she winked at Agatha, and the room turned that unsettling white again.</p>

<p>Agatha stood slowly breathing for a long moment and then shakily stepped from the red square. The white door appeared to the back of the room. She walked toward it, rubbing her pale, naked fingers together. She’d been more like Chthon when she’d had the copy of the Darkhold. More unapologetically herself. It wasn’t Chthon that haunted her though, but the image of Rio languidly perched on Chthon’s lap, simply smiling at her. Unguarded. Trusting. Infatuated.</p><p>Agatha touched her stomach and stepped back into the bedroom. Rio sat in the recliner by the window and turned to look at her. Wary with a hint of devastating hopefulness.</p><p>“How do I remember?” Agatha rasped, an overwhelming urgency knotting her stomach. She still wasn’t sure what to believe, but was very certain she needed Rio to be that happy again.</p><p>“That depends on you and the Darkhold.”</p><p>“The Darkhold? Why?”</p><p>“It will decide when you’re ready.”</p><p>“When I’m ready? Why would it get to decide that and not me?”</p><p>“You designed it to serve as a memory bank you can consult as needed. It will reveal your memories as you are ready to learn them. These are magical clauses you put in place to protect your mind from being overloaded with aeons of knowledge. Just trust that you knew what you were doing when you decided that this would be the best way.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I’ve long since learned not to question your relationship with your book.”</p><p>“Am I different without my memories?” She couldn’t shake the way Rio had let herself be held by Chthon. The way she’d looked at her. “We're shaped by our experiences. How can you say you loved me when I don't remember anything?”</p><p>“You're a lot like when I first met you. There are minor differences, nothing though that makes it feel like you aren't you. It’s remarkable really.” Rio smirked. “How absolutely stubborn you are.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to smile, but her mind wouldn’t stop. “Minor differences?”</p><p>“You're more patient once you remember, but that comes with time.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“You're not as easily angered, a lot calmer when faced with things that annoy you. Also something that comes with time.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And nothing. You’re still mean and brilliant in an infuriatingly attractive way.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly. “Rio, just tell me, please.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to her hands in her lap. “You’re more careful with me. You wouldn't—you don't— Rio shut her eyes, then blinked them open looking out the window. “You’re more careful with me,” she softly murmured.</p><p>“Rio—</p><p>“I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I'm answering your questions as best I can. If you remembered me, remembered us, back then when Nicky…things would've been different. We would’ve worked through it together.”</p><p>Rio stood from the chair, meeting her gaze. “We've spoken about how there's a disconnect you feel until you're attuned to the Darkhold again. And though you’ve always been a charmingly volatile woman, that disconnect does make it difficult for you to regulate emotional responses.”</p><p>“That’s no excuse.”</p><p>“Yes, you’ve said as much before.” She tentatively walked closer until she stood in front of Agatha. “It’s a strange thing, Agatha. To be reborn so many times. To feel incomplete and not know why. I shouldn’t have waited so long of your life to come back. I should’ve been there and then maybe the Darkhold would’ve already revealed itself to you… Two hundred years feels differently to me than it does to you, but I’m not blameless. I should’ve stayed even if we weren’t together anymore. Even though you hated me. I should’ve—</p><p>“No. You had no obligation to stay. Stop feeling guilty and just tell me how to remember. Where do I find the original Darkhold?”</p><p>“I can't tell you that.”</p><p>“Can’t?”</p><p>“I won’t. You made me promise.”</p><p>“Now I'm making you not promise.”</p><p>Rio smiled, and some of the tension dissipated. “Not happening.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “How long does it usually take?”</p><p>“It varies. The Darkhold guides you to a page or a copy to get you ready. I reveal myself to you and try to get you to fall in love with me because I missed you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and ached and reached out to take Rio’s hand, feeling grounded when Rio threaded their fingers together.</p><p>“Eighty to a hundred Earth years when we’re lucky. Sometimes longer depending on the family you’re born into and the state of the world you live in. Your quickest time was at age 51 during the Sixth Cosmos. You were born into a warzone and was tracking copies to grow your power and protect yourself.”</p><p>“It’s been over 300 years.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Is this the longest it’s taken?”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand. “Yes.”</p><p>“I think it's time to make an executive decision.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“What if the Darkhold chooses Wanda because I’m taking too long?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “A moment?”</p><p>Agatha frowned but nodded, watching as Rio closed her eyes and tilted her head for a few long seconds that Agatha spent staring at her face and the delectable chords straining in her neck.</p><p>Rio then chuckled under her breath and shook her head with an indulgent smile before looking at her. “The Darkhold confirmed that Wanda was created because it became desperate when you were in mourning for such a long time and in no frame of mind to receive its power without it mentally breaking you.”</p><p>“Oh. Do you speak to it often?”</p><p>“I’ve made sure to check-in remotely. As I did just now. It’s complicated.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and placed her hands into her pockets, leaving Agatha’s palm cold and empty. “I’ll release Wanda from the curse your Darkhold placed on her and me. She’s stuck with the chaos magic though. Removing it will be too dangerous for her since she’s had it all her life and has unlocked her powers as the Scarlet Witch.”</p><p>“It placed a curse on you too?”</p><p>“I refuse to be married to a redhead, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, but felt relieved that the things she had learned sounded like things she would want to do. Imbuing a book with her magic and making it siphon power for her? Brilliant. Finding a way to live with Rio forever? Genius. It explained the urges she’d felt all her life. The need to learn and grow more powerful. Apparently it was always in her nature, no matter how hard Evanora had tried to nurture it out of her. Or how much she’d tried to pretend for the coven’s sake that she was fine after destroying the copy of the Darkhold.</p><p>Still.</p><p>“Rio, what if the Darkhold decides I’m never ready? What if I never remember?”</p><p>Rio grimaced. “You want to keep Wanda as a failsafe?”</p><p>“No! God, I don’t even know how I’m going to tell her what I apparently did to her.”</p><p>“She’ll forgive you. Technically, it was the Darkhold that did it. Though I trust you to ensure that it won’t do so again in future.”</p><p>Rio gave her a pointed look, and Agatha wasn’t sure what she was supposed to say. She didn’t know the Darkhold, didn’t know how to stop it from doing weird things that upset the Sacred Balance.</p><p>“Sure…” she said uncertainly.</p><p>“Good. And you will remember. The Darkhold might be even more desperate for you to re-attune to it than you are.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. “When I die…Do I go somewhere and wait to be reborn? Like hang out in limbo for a few billion years?”</p><p>“Your soul is locked away with the Darkhold in its dimension, keeping it from causing trouble. You don’t feel the time apart. The moment you shut your eyes it feels as though you’re instantly reborn. And I will find you like I always have and make you fall in love with me, like I always will.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t need to do all that if you just told me from the start.”</p><p>Rio shifted on her feet, gripping her own bicep in a one-armed hug as she hung her head. “It’s important to me that you choose me like this, Agatha,” she mumbled. “Without knowing our history. It’s terrifying each time, but I need you to make that choice to reaffirm that you want me not out of obligation to an ancient past we share, but because of a present desire. After Nicky,” her breath hitched. “I thought that maybe this time round you wouldn’t want—</p><p>Agatha reached for her. “Rio…”</p><p>Rio smiled tremulously, moving away before Agatha could touch her. “You should get some sleep. You have a lot to process.”</p><p>“I—</p><p>Saying that she still loved Rio felt empty. Like they were only words. Was it even the right time for confessions after everything she’d just learned?</p><p>Rio smoothly closed the distance and pressed a lingering kiss to the corner of her mouth. Agatha gasped, drawing in Rio’s breath. Her heart and stomach flipped, and then Rio stepped back before Agatha could press their lips together.</p><p>“Sleep well, my love.”</p><p>Agatha shakily nodded. “Goodnight,” she whispered, and left the room in a daze.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>They had breakfast in an aristocratic banquet hall that looked like a stage set from Dracula. Bartol the Butler serving them, only added to the eerie ambience. Agatha had barely slept, nearly cuddling Scratch to death, and woke with a headache, still attempting to process everything she’d learned. Feeling like it had all been some convoluted dream meant to torture her. To tease her with something as beautiful as Rio’s eternal love and yet place her in the present where everything between them was still broken and uncertain.</p><p>The coven softly spoke amongst themselves, though Agatha often felt an inquisitive gaze on her. Jen, naturally, broke the embargo first.</p><p>“Agatha,” she softly said. “The offer still stands to go beat her up.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “I just need some time to deal with what she told me.”</p><p>“Okay,” Jen uncertainly said and started speaking about the outfits she’d found in her room. Only then did Agatha notice they were all dressed in different sets of clothes. She’d been using magic to freshen her own outfit.</p><p>Lost in thought, she inadvertently met Wanda’s shrewd gaze and froze, embarrassed at her behaviour the previous day. Knowing she should apologise for how close she’d come to lashing out with her magic. But then Wanda smirked smugly, eyes twinkling knowingly, and Agatha scowled at her before looking down at her breakfast.</p><p>Sighing, she forced a forkful of scrambled egg into her mouth. Focused on chewing and swallowing, methodically clearing her plate and drinking her coffee and not looking at Wanda who was going to be insufferable when she heard the truth. And then their friendship might come to an abrupt end when Agatha told her that Chthon was the reason Wanda had to carry the burden of her chaos magic.</p><p>Rio arrived the second the final fork was placed down and Bartol started clearing the table. The Twins came dashing from Rio’s robes, all white and furry, looking like baby yetis. They ran past everyone and climbed into Agatha’s lap.</p><p>She grinned and held them close, her heart tugging at the near human murmurs they released while she hugged them. They felt like plush teddy bears and smelled like vanilla and lavender. Agatha hummed contently as the too short arms wrapped around her shoulders. Then her gaze went up and found Rio, who was staring at her with a soft expression, openly yearning and tender.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat and she swallowed thickly, smiling tentatively.</p><p>Rio returned it, just as carefully. “Are you ready to go?” she seemed to only ask Agatha.</p><p>Agatha nodded and tried to stand, but the Twins were heavy in their latest forms. As though sensing her predicament, they grew smaller and Agatha laughed, lifting them, and rested each on a hip.</p><p>Rio walked up to her, knife in hand, and cast a swirling black portal.</p><p>She stood close and Agatha leaned their shoulders together, unabashedly staring at the side of Rio’s face.</p><p>“Guess we’ll just go then,” Jen said, fighting a smirk as she and a snickering Alice walked through.</p><p>“Off to get lost in the Outside all by ourselves,” Lilia said, following them.</p><p>“If only our protector wasn’t so distracted by her wife,” Wanda dramatically said, grinning widely as she disappeared through the portal.</p><p>“Is there a room on the other side?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“Is it safe to let them sweat it out for a while?”</p><p>Rio smiled, amused. “Yes. I’m keeping an eye on them. Did you sleep well?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio raised her hand, fingers gently touching Agatha’s temple.</p><p>Agatha softly exhaled as her headache faded. “Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>They remained standing there, the Twins’ little furry fists holding her necklace while they intently examined it.</p><p>“Do we have different names each time?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“You met me as The River of Life. It's what my creator named me. I try to choose something derivative in a known language when you’re reborn.”</p><p>“And my name is different each time because I'm born into random families and can't choose?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Does it put you off that I'm an Agatha?”</p><p>“Why would it? You're still you.”</p><p>“Am I though?”</p><p>Rio laughed. “You are. Each time. You, my love, have always refused to bend, no matter what world you’re born into.”</p><p>Agatha smiled at the sincerity, wondering whether she had become ‘my love’ because Rio worried she’d say the wrong name accidentally.</p><p>“Your coven is starting to panic,” Rio said, gaze searching.</p><p>Agatha wanted to kiss her, but doubted it could be as simple as that. “We should probably go before they get themselves into trouble.”</p><p>Rio nodded and motioned to the portal with a cute little bow. “My lady.”</p><p>“Dork,” Agatha fondly said and stepped through the portal feeling remarkably lighter.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They entered the Marketplace again, a veritable ghost town, or rather a mass grave, and most likely the reason for the coven’s rising panic. The Twins had scurried beneath Rio’s robes as though they too were affected by the memories of what had happened there.</p><p>Rio cast a silvery gleaming Gate and everyone quickly marched through, finding themselves on yet another floating rock, this one the prettiest by far, with spiralling white marble artistically sculpted into arches and winding staircases that led up to a pure white palace. Far below on the ground, a massive city loomed only slightly visible through the clouds like some kind of fairy-tale land.</p><p>The second Rio joined the coven and the Gate vanished, a ten-foot-tall woman appeared. Her skin was like the surface of a silver-grey moon, the faded silhouettes of planets and stars scattered across her body. Her eyes were entirely white and her red lips tilted into a secretive smirk. She wore a green face crown, similar to the Scarlet Witch, that tapered into long green pieces of fabric, fluttering ethereally around her entirely naked body.</p><p>“I am the Queen of Nevers,” she said in a smooth melodic lilt. “I am what might be, forever outside what is. From here, I see all.”</p><p>As far as cosmic entity speeches went, it was short and sweet and Agatha would’ve appreciated the non-threatening nature of it a lot more if the Never Queen wasn’t so focused on Rio.</p><p>The Queen bent at the waist to meet Rio’s eyes, her breasts jutting forward. “Hello, Little Death. Why must we only see each other under such dire circumstances?”</p><p>Rio smiled. “You only want to see me when my siblings aren’t available.”</p><p>“Oh? I have always wanted to see you, my dear lady. It is you who have only had eyes for another.” Somehow, Agatha could see the Never Queen’s gaze shift to her, even when she had no irises. “Look at your little tyrant now, I could crush her between my thighs.”</p><p>Normally, Agatha would’ve had a snarky comeback to a statement like that, instead, her magic flared, only adding to the Never Queen’s amusement.</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair. “I need the Edge of Reality, Never.”</p><p>“Oh? <em>You</em> are taking up arms?”</p><p>“It’s not for me.”</p><p>“I suppose that is all you will say on the matter.”</p><p>“Correct.”</p><p>“And what do I get?”</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>“The Nexus being.”</p><p>“She’s not anyone’s to give.”</p><p>“Oh, boo. You are no fun. When last have you been pleasured?”</p><p>“Never, stop antagonising my wife.”</p><p>The Never Queen grinned. “Come, then. Let us negotiate terms.” She placed a hand on Rio’s shoulder, guiding her away, sending a look over her shoulder directed at Agatha. “Only you may enter my sacred sanctum as often as it pleases you.”</p><p>Agatha’s magic crackled, her witch’s garb settling over her body, and the entire coven moved to keep her in place, stopping her from flying at the Never Queen.</p><p>“Agatha, calm down,” Wanda said, arms around her waist, the chaos magic only feeding into her anger. Making it difficult to think. Like it had five years ago when she’d siphoned it from Wanda, and got so drunk on power she failed to notice the giant trap being set for her. Like when it had poured into her at the Marketplace, making her feel so invincible she’d briefly forgotten the danger everyone she cared about was in.</p><p>Held in place, Agatha quietly vibrated in rage despite Rio and the Never Queen having disappeared. Perhaps because of that.</p><p>“At least we don’t have to fight her to get through,” Jen said. “However much that might disappoint Agatha.”</p><p>“So, you didn’t come back last night…” Alice said.</p><p>Agatha barely heard her, feeling her hands move to start the siphoning spell to draw Wanda’s magic, and abruptly stilled. Blinking rapidly, she deflated, remembering what her life was now. That she was somehow Rio’s wife without any of the benefits. That she was in the body of a god without any access to that power.</p><p>And was that why learning new spells had always come so easily to her? Was it like muscle memory? An innate sense left over from a past life? It would explain why she’d been able to cast the familiar spell at age five after simply reading through it once. Why she could siphon magic in a way she hadn’t known was possible…</p><p>Sensing the fight leaving her, the coven let go.</p><p>Agatha <em>had</em> gone back to the guest wing the previous evening. A door taking her to the foyer and she’d gone into the first room and failed to get any sleep in the bed Rio’s mortal vessel had been in.</p><p>Jen cleared her throat. “Did you two finally reconcile?”</p><p>“Finally?”</p><p>“Come on, Agatha, we all have eyes. You killed hundreds of people thinking she was hurt.”</p><p>“What did she say about Chthon?” Wanda asked, eyes sparkling.</p><p>Agatha’s face fell.</p><p>“What?” Alice scowled. “She <em>confirmed</em> it? I’ll kill her.”</p><p>“She said—she said that I’m Chthon…”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>And then Wanda grinned widely. “Told you guys.”</p><p>They started arguing amongst each other, about bets lost and Wanda apparently won.</p><p>“How did <em>you</em> not see this?” Jen accused Lilia who pulled a face and shrugged.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Wanda began listing off on her fingers. “Your attachment to the Darkhold, your response to my magic, your reaction after we destroyed the Darkhold, Rio’s obsession with you, your obsession with her. It was kinda obvious.”</p><p>“That’s not fair,” Alice said. “We didn’t have all the information you did about the Darkhold.”</p><p>“I can tell a good hustle when I see one,” Wanda said, trying and failing to look smug through her elated smile. “I’m training to be a shady criminal, to pick up Agatha’s inevitable slack when she abandons us.”</p><p>Jen hummed. “Now that she’s remarried, we probably won’t see her much at all.”</p><p>“You wont be one of<em> those</em> married people will you?” Alice asked. “The ones who ignore their friends to spend all their time at home with their wife.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure how to respond to any of the teasing remarks. She and Rio used to be all about each other, but that was mostly because Agatha didn’t have any friends, and Rio’s friends seemed to be hot naked cosmic ladies that she couldn’t introduce Agatha to.</p><p>She scowled and stared toward the palace in the sky, her ouroboros shining brightly. Fighting the temptation to teleport herself to Rio.</p><p>Unsure how long she’d been glaring, because the coven had let her be, it felt like an eternity later when Rio and the Never Queen appeared a few feet away.</p><p>Two little dragons sat on each of the Never Queen’s shoulders, one blue and one red, familiar glowing eyes shining as the Never Queen gently extended a large hand for them to jump on and placed a tender kiss to each of their heads.</p><p>She looked to Rio with a pained expression before extending her hand for the Twins to fly toward Rio and disappear into her robes.</p><p>“May your path lead you to a favourable future, Lady Death,” the Never Queen softly said, brushing the back of a finger across Rio’s cheek.</p><p>Rio sighed. “Thank you, Never.”</p><p>The Never Queen turned and looked directly at Wanda who grew taut under the attention.</p><p>“There is infinite power in choice. Do you not agree, Scarlet Witch?”</p><p>“Please don't call me that.”</p><p>The Queen fell silent and stared at an uncomfortable Wanda. The coven tensing at the focused intensity.</p><p>Wanda cleared her throat. “Earlier, when you said you wanted the Nexus being, did you mean me?”</p><p>“You have the potential to become a Nexus being. The Ultimate Nexus being. In the palm of my hand, at my side, at the head of my Defenders. I see countless futures where you are mine.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened, turning bright red, and the Never Queen smirked.</p><p>“Come to me when you are open to explore all possibility. I will share with you our futures.”</p><p>Wanda gaped and the Never Queen vanished into thin air. The coven stared at Wanda with raised eyebrows watching her flushed face in amusement.</p><p>Rio was the only one not staring at Wanda, instead casting another Gate. Wanda instantly rushed through it and the others cackled, following after her.</p><p>Agatha lingered, looking to Rio. “Do I need to be worried about her interest in Wanda?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Did you get what you needed?”</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, ugly jealousy still making her feel tense and out of sorts. She moved toward the Gate before she said or did something stupid.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio softly called, and Agatha halted, turning to look at her. “The One Above All is…a lot. Don’t let them get to you, okay?”</p><p>Agatha frowned, unsure what to make of the request. Not sure who The One Above All was and they couldn’t be worse than The First Firmament. </p><p>“Just let them do their sappy nonsense and you can all get out of here.”</p><p>Agatha nodded confusedly and curiously, then stepped through the Gate and into the House of Ideas.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They entered an exquisite garden, a bright red sun warmly shone midway across an orange sky. Panoramic views stretched all around them of floating islands in the sky for as far as the eye could see. They appeared populated with buildings, others covered in forests and mountains. Different foliage and architecture for each, but the nearest one was still too far to make out any more detail than that.</p><p>Beside her, Rio’s clothes changed to the exquisitely embroidered green dress she’d favoured in the late 1600s and the nostalgia hit Agatha like a sledgehammer to the gut.</p><p>Rio scowled, and changed them back to her black outfit. Then gritted her teeth when they changed to green again. After a couple of changes—Rio’s agitation growing—they finally settled to black, Agatha grinning throughout the adorable struggle.</p><p>“I figured that with the power the Darkhold held, you’d want it destroyed?” she said, trying to distract Rio as she appeared more anxious than grumpy, and Agatha gathered it had little to do with the wardrobe switching.</p><p>“The Darkhold helps to maintain a cosmic balance.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Well, it warns of dire consequences when used. Of Darkness that would be unleashed. You reasoned that any caster who still wilfully chose to use it to gain power and subsequently was consumed by it, deserved to suffer the consequences of their own actions. You’ve destroyed a substantial number of threats that way.”</p><p>“So I’m not a threat?”</p><p>“To magic users? Yes. To cosmic entities? Yes. You have never been a saint, Agatha. There are those who have had valid reasons to call you evil. You’ve had several rivals in each iteration of the cosmos. Some wanting to steal your powers, others wanting to strip you of them. You enjoy the attention, the fear, the reverence, very much.”</p><p> Of course she did. Agatha snorted. “You sound proud.”</p><p>“I’ve always been proud to be your wife.”</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha stepped closer, staring at her mouth. Wondering if the Never Queen had touched her while they were up in her palace. Wanting to demand an answer and knowing she had no right to even feel as insane as she was at the thought of it.</p><p>“What’s that place called?” Alice asked. “It’s kind of pretty.”</p><p>Rio dragged her gaze from Agatha’s face to see Alice pointing at the floating islands.</p><p>“It’s the Spirit Realm,” Rio said and Agatha froze, her heart rupturing. “Only The One Above All can access the Spirit Realm,” Rio sadly added and Agatha felt so foolish. To still have such a reaction. To still have such a want.</p><p>She was saved from the remnants of her ridiculous reaction by the sound of at least two voices in harmony echoing all around them. Inside of their heads, and drizzling from the sky like gentle summer rain.</p><p> “I am The One Above All. I see through many eyes. I build with many hands. My creations are themselves, but they are also me. I am the source of all there is, was, and ever will be.”</p><p>A white misty cloud appeared in front of them that was lightly blown away by a breeze, revealing a gorgeous woman, tall and statuesque, in a tasteful navy blue sheath dress and black heels. She had straight black hair that fell over one shoulder, down to her waist, attractively streaked with silver. And appeared around Agatha’s age if she weren’t a witch, with full red lips and rich brown eyes that complemented her olive tanned skin.</p><p><em>‘She kind of looks like you,’</em> Agatha said to Rio, tilting her head as her gaze languidly dragged over the woman’s stunning body.</p><p>Agatha could practically hear the groan in Rio’s reply. <em>‘She looks like that because I’ve chosen to look like this.’</em></p><p>Wait.</p><p>And it was Rio’s fault really, for having conditioned Agatha to not ask too many questions about the larger cosmos, that it took her <em>that</em> long to figure out. Because how does one put it together when each cosmic entity had a name more self-aggrandising than the next. Kings and queens and gods the lot of them. She’d figured The One Above All was just the most pompous out of everyone.</p><p>“Oh, my darling girls!” The woman exclaimed and made a beeline for them, halting in front of Agatha, tears pooling in vaguely familiar brown eyes.</p><p>“Mother, you said you wouldn't do this,” Rio warned.</p><p>“That was before you told her the truth.”</p><p>“She knows the truth but doesn't remember. <em>This</em> isn't helping.”</p><p>“I was so sad when you both lost Nicky.” Agatha’s breath caught. “I would have come, but was advised not to.”</p><p>“Mother, stop,” Rio said in a pained breath.</p><p>“I need her to know that I would have come.”</p><p>“And she will know. She didn’t have her memory. It would’ve been confusing. And—and—</p><p>“Things were difficult for us,” Agatha said when Rio couldn’t seem to find the words. “I wasn’t in a very good place.”</p><p>The One Above All nodded with far too much empathy. She then kissed Agatha on her forehead in such a maternal way, it made Agatha cringe that she’d checked her out only a moment before.</p><p>“Mother, please,” Rio said. “Just give her some space. She only found out recently about...everything.”</p><p>Even whilst flustered by the care freely offered, Agatha could tell that Rio was the one reeling. So she placed a hand on Rio’s back.</p><p>“All right, sweetie pie,” The One Above All said, pouting ridiculously and then turned her attention to the rest of the coven, settling on Alice. Her demeanour smoothly switched from caring motherly warmth, to sexy predatory MILF.</p><p>“And who is this delectable little thing?” she placed her fingers beneath Alice’s chin who blushed a pretty crimson as she leaned into the touch.</p><p>“You know who she is.” Rio sighed. “You know who all of them are. You know why we’re here. Please, just—I—</p><p>“I might stop once you’ve given the mother you haven’t seen in far too long, the hug she surely deserves.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, ears bright red, and moved forward to hug her. Not quickly either. Rio clung to her as though she desperately needed to be hugged and The One Above All held her back so tenderly it made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>“There, there, dumpling. Mommy’s going to prepare a delicious dinner for you and your friends and then we’ll talk, all right?”</p><p>Rio nodded against her chest and reluctantly let go.</p><p>“I hope you will remember soon…<em>Agatha</em>,” she said with a wink and a twirl that turned her into a familiar looking man wearing a harlequin green suit with a violet pocket handkerchief.</p><p>“All right, ladies! Any food restrictions and or meal preferences?”</p><p>“It’s the guy,” Jen loudly whispered, pointing as though Agatha wasn’t already staring at him. “From the magic shop.” Okay so maybe she wanted to let everyone else know who hadn’t been there. “The one who told me and Agatha about Chthon.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to roll her eyes at the needless overshare, but it benefited the one person who seemed to only figure it out then.</p><p>Rio bristled. “<em>You</em> told her? I should’ve known when I couldn’t sense this mysterious ‘guy in a magic shop’ that never existed!”</p><p>The One Above All didn’t look the least bit affected by Rio’s anger. “I only told a beautiful story.”</p><p>“You had no right to tell her, Father! She wasn't ready.”</p><p>“She seems to be processing the information rather well. As I knew she would.”</p><p>“You shouldn't have interfered. You should trust the protocols she put in place for herself.”</p><p>His expression softened. “You need her now, apple-cheeks. At your side where she belongs.”</p><p>Rio seemed stuck between anger and heartbreak. Furiously trembling in place.</p><p>“She has me,” Agatha softly said, brushing her fingers along Rio’s back, who stilled and stiffened at the touch, but her fists unclenched.</p><p>The One Above All grinned, brown eyes lighting up in delight. “And you will support her through this difficult time, yes?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I haven’t been very good to her this time around, but I'll be better from here on out.”</p><p>“Excellent!” His smile was enigmatic. “Now let us go have a family dinner. This way.”</p><p>The coven followed the boisterous man, seemingly in shock, yet kind enough to serve as buffer as they walked through the beautiful garden, allowing Agatha and Rio to fall behind.</p><p>“So they married us,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Yes. My creator can clearly not be trusted to keep their mouth shut and we decided they would only be allowed to see you after your re-attunement to the Darkhold.”</p><p>Agatha nodded to herself and ran a hand through her hair, then slipped her other into Rio’s hand, who clung back tightly.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Agatha was pretty sure that The One Above All was the reason Rio had been trapped with her in the City of Judgement. It was the one requirement to gain entry into the House of Ideas. The only being she supposed who could trap Death so easily. She couldn’t be upset at the interference, though, as right then all she felt was grateful they’d been forced to have that much needed conversation.</p><p>They arrived in a back garden, stepping into a green meadow where a large gazebo and a long dining table stood surrounded by colourful plants and trees. The coven was already seated and the table laid out with all their favourite foods. The One Above All was serving them, charmingly smiling as he spoke, making Lilia blush, and Agatha hadn’t thought she’d ever see that miracle happen.</p><p>“Father, may we speak privately?” Rio asked, when they were still a few yards away.</p><p>“If you ladies will excuse me, I’ve been summoned.” He grinned brightly and made his way over.</p><p>Agatha looked to Rio who was still holding her hand. “Do you need me to go?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, lips parting as though she wanted to say something. Her shoulders grew tighter and she looked away, still trying to form words that didn’t seem able to escape her.</p><p>“I would like to stay,” Agatha softly said.</p><p>Rio exhaled, her shoulders loosening. “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, gave Rio’s hand a reassuring squeeze, and watched Rio’s father as he walked up.</p><p>“Since this affects your friends too, they should be aware, no?” The One Above All said, glancing back to the coven pretending to eat and not stare in their direction. Like they didn’t have breakfast only an hour or two ago, and weren’t at a dinner party in the middle of the afternoon.</p><p>“The First Firmament affects everyone, yes, but it’s against the rules of the Living Tribunal to discuss—</p><p>“Aren't you currently the Living Tribunal? Do a motion, pass a resolution. Or can the Tribunal only function after millennia of war and politicking before a decision is made?”</p><p>“If you disapproved of the manner in which the Tribunal functioned, you should’ve raised your concerns sooner, Father.”</p><p>“I don't care how the Tribunal functions.”</p><p>“Then what—</p><p>He switched to Rio’s mother. “I care about you, lamb chop.”</p><p>“Don’t you care about your other children?”</p><p>“My children perished during the destruction of the First Cosmos. Only you remain.”</p><p>“Mother…”</p><p>“What came after, these versions brought to life by a cosmos in need of balance, were simply aspects. I know you loved them. Each and every iteration you’ve allowed into your heart. But they weren’t my children. They weren’t the same as us. You know this.”</p><p>“I didn’t think that would matter to you.”</p><p>“It mattered to them, too.”</p><p>“None of you ever said anything.”</p><p>“Because it didn’t matter to you.”</p><p>The tiny twin dragons crept out of Rio’s robes, onto her arms and The One Above All reached out to allow them to crawl into her hands.</p><p>“You have a responsibility,” Rio whispered, watching her mother caringly handle the Twins.</p><p>“Do I? Perhaps I failed in making you understand, my child, but I created life to be self-sustaining. Created sentience with the ability to do good and to do harm. Everyone has choices to make. You more than anyone know that it is the very nature of things to end. And yet you fight it now, for your Chthon, because you refuse to restart the cycle.” Agatha’s chest constricted at that revelation, still holding onto Rio’s hand. “That is the choice you have made. You are changing your fate. And I have never been prouder.”</p><p>Rio lowered her gaze. “I won’t lose her again so soon.”</p><p>“Good. I agree, but I will not escalate the growth of these babies.” The One Above All turned back into Rio’s father, cooing at the little dragons wrestling with his hands. “You have come to ask that of me, yes?”</p><p>“I need Eternity to use the Edge of Reality to defeat The First Firmament.”</p><p>“Oh, the Never Queen gave you her precious sword? What did you need to give her in return?”</p><p>“Father, please stop pretending you don’t already know the answers to your questions.”</p><p>“That would be an awful way to hold a conversation, honeydew.”</p><p>“I promised her a seat on the Living Tribunal. I have spent the past few weeks selecting candidates that will lend us power.”</p><p>“You have chosen well.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “You really won’t help?”</p><p>“You don’t need my help, lovebug.”</p><p>“I am literally here because I do.”</p><p>The Twins flew around The One Above All who gently caught them with a delighted noise.</p><p>“What prevents you from wielding the Edge of Reality yourself?” he asked as the Twins crawled across his arms, stalking each other toward his shoulders.</p><p>Rio looked at him askance. “I am Death. My permanence prevents my interference in the Natural Order of All Things. I should not kill.”</p><p>“According to whom?”</p><p>“The oath I swore to <em>you</em>.”</p><p>“I have only ever asked you to uphold the Sacred Balance.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You needed structure when you were created, given your power and purpose. Restrictions meant to prevent you from following a path of destruction like so many other powerful entities. You have learned and you have grown and I trust the decisions you make. I trust that you will maintain the Sacred Balance because you choose to, not because you must. You haven’t strayed from your path yet and I trust that you never shall as your power and how you wield it remains the biggest threat to the cosmos.”</p><p>“How so?” Agatha asked, brows furrowed. Rio was many threatening things, but a threat to the cosmos?</p><p>“Souls belong in the Spirit Realm. Wayward souls are dangerous. Have you experienced a haunting before? You start interfering in the Natural Order Of All Things it stands to reason that chaos would reign and destruction would ensue.”</p><p>Agatha nodded thoughtfully. The Sacred Balance had always seemed like this abstract thing. Its importance only apparent in Rio’s earnestness in upholding it. But she’d encountered a ghost before. A singular one. And it hadn’t been pretty. So could imagine the upheaval a few more would cause.</p><p>“But I like this new child of mine,” Rio’s father continued, “who fights for what she wants, who changes the cosmos for the better within the rules she’d sworn to uphold.” He smiled and gathered the Twins in his arms. “Because look at what you've gone and done, River.” Rio's eye grew wide staring at the little dragons. “You created Life.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught as the Twins turned into human looking babies with olive skin and chubby Rio-cheeks. They wore light green onesies with daisies embroidered on their chests. Eternity’s eyes were still that luminescent blue, the same colour as his thick crop of hair that licked like flames across his head. Infinity matched him in red. Both appearing about six months old.</p><p>“Don't do that,” Rio hoarsely said. “They’re not...”</p><p>“I didn't do anything.”</p><p>Rio’s chest heaved. “Change them back! They’re not—</p><p>“They became what they were meant to be, because you have finally realised what you have created.”</p><p>“I didn’t—</p><p>“My grandchildren!” he elatedly said.</p><p>Rio looked anguished. “No…”</p><p>“You created Life, daughter. They are not aspects born of a new cosmos in need of balance. They were born of your power, your essence. Your love and intent. They are yours as you are mine.” He smiled broadly and lovingly held them close, kissing their heads causing gummy smiles and happy gurgles.</p><p>“Not for the first time I might add.” He looked to Agatha. “Nicky will be so happy to hear he has a brother and sister.”</p><p>Rio’s trembling hand tightened in hers and Agatha grabbed hold of her locket, pressing it down against her aching chest until her fingers hurt. “You’ve spoken to him?”</p><p>“I visit… Is that all right?”</p><p>“Is he doing well?”</p><p>“He's very happy. We speak about you both often. I hope you don't mind that I’ve shared stories with him?”</p><p>“No, please,” Agatha rasped, tears pooling in her eyes. “Please tell him. Tell him we love him and we miss him.”</p><p>“Of course. Always.”</p><p>“Thank you, Father,” Rio breathed.</p><p>“Thank you for what? Nicky is the light of my life. I mourn that you lost him, but it’s been wonderful having family nearby.” The One Above All looked between them knowingly. “Let me go see to my guests,” he said and walked off with the Twins.</p><p>Agatha pulled Rio into a hug, keeping her to her chest with a hand cupping her head and the other stroking her back, heart clenching at Rio’s trembling body.</p><p>“Well, at least we know you make excellent children,” Agatha murmured into her hair, releasing a shaky breath when Rio nuzzled closer into her neck. “Though, considering your proven virility, we may need to consider getting you some condoms.”</p><p>Rio wetly sobbed a laugh and held her tighter.</p><p>Chest aching, Agatha pressed her cheek to Rio’s head.</p><p>“It’s going to be okay, darling,” she said as a surge of protectiveness rocked through her body. Knowing that Rio was trembling in her arms out of a valid fear of experiencing the same loss they did with Nicky.</p><p>And as absurd as it would be, Agatha was fairly certain that she would throw herself at The First Firmament before letting it get anywhere near Rio or the Twins.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>After an awkward meal where Agatha and Rio had sat silent and pressed against each other while The One Above All entertained the coven, they walked to an area cordoned by a neatly trimmed boxed hedge that held a fountain set in beautifully chiselled, light-grey masonry. A stone arch whirled to life, the surface shimmering blue like the ocean. Wanda and Jen held a twin each and Rio seemed almost afraid of them now whilst being unable to take her shimmering eyes off her children.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio’s mother said. “May I have word?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, ignoring the way Rio’s gaze snapped toward them, and followed after the woman, until they stopped in front of a spectacular fern with long lush lilac leaves. Agatha resisted the urge to touch it, feeling fidgety beneath the brown eyes earnestly studying her.</p><p>“You may have noticed that my child tends to act as though she does not require care. As though she needs to solve everything on her own. You and I have struggled so long to get her to ask for help. For comfort...”</p><p>A pang shot through Agatha’s chest. “Yes. I’ve noticed.”</p><p>“She is better when you are with her. You are good at getting her to open up. But when you are not with us, she regresses to the way she was before. To being only Death and isolating herself. Shutting me out. It feels as though I lose you both each time.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched and she pressed a hand to her stomach, feeling as though she should apologise.</p><p>“It cannot be helped, dear. And it’s not your fault. The way our River loves is a beautiful thing.”</p><p>“It is,” Agatha hoarsely agreed, staring at the ground, feeling unsteady.</p><p>“Give her time, all right?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot up, not having expected the conversation to go in that direction. Having been waiting on a reprimand. A shovel talk. But she supposed they were way beyond that.</p><p>“She’s making sure that you both have time to reconcile, so keep an open heart and trust in the love you share. Everything will work out. I have a good feeling about this.” She smiled and Agatha smiled back, and fell into the arms that wrapped around her. It felt good. Safe. Motherly.</p><p>Utterly ridiculous.</p><p>She tried to push away thoughts of Evanora while they walked back and rejoined the group at the Gate.</p><p>“Aw, let me say goodbye to my babies!” Rio’s father said, alternating taking first one at a time to smother them with affection before eventually ending up with both in his arms and turned to where Agatha had gravitated to Rio’s side, smiling reassuringly at her questioning look.</p><p>“You will come visit now, won't you?” he hopefully asked.</p><p>Rio hesitated.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, watching Rio try to smother a smile.</p><p>The One Above All looked between them. “It's a difficult thing, losing a child. It leaves an emptiness behind that will never be filled.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly.</p><p>“But you have each other, and you have me. Yes?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and took Eternity when he was handed to her, and then Infinity was handed to Rio. “Off you go then, daughters. Have fun saving the cosmos.”</p><p>“Keep well, Father,” Rio murmured, pressed a quick kiss to his cheek and then stepped through the Gate as though she was running away.</p><p>Agatha sent one last look to the Spirit Realm, Eternity playing with her locket.</p><p>“I will tell him,” The One Above All said.</p><p>Agatha smiled, comforted that Nicky was the ultimate nepo baby, and stepped through the Gate and into the throne room of Rio’s fortress in Westview.</p><p>It felt like a lifetime had passed since they’d last been there. She watched the coven as first Lilia stepped up and hugged Rio, murmuring a soft thank you. Then Alice and Jen. Wanda and Rio were both awkward about it, but Rio accepted the brief hug and Agatha was grateful when the coven walked off and huddled together with their backs purposely turned to them.</p><p>Subtlety was not a trait any of them possessed.</p><p>She walked over to Rio, pressed her nose to Eternity’s hair for a long moment, inhaling the scent of sage and sandalwood, her eyes fluttering closed before she reluctantly handed him over to Rio. Then she hesitated, unsure how to end this journey they’d just been on. Truth was, she didn’t want to leave at all.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>She startled. “Yes?”</p><p>“I’ll see you soon?”</p><p>Agatha released a breath. “Of course.”</p><p>She kissed all three of them on their cheeks, breathing in the citrus and honey from Infinity’s flaming red hair. Lingering close to Rio’s face when her eyes locked with warm, pretty brown.</p><p>Then would definitely be the worst time to attempt to kiss Rio, Agatha glumly decided and took a step back.</p><p>“<em>Te veo</em>,” Rio murmured, and with a heart full to bursting, Agatha smiled at her and dragged herself away to join the coven so they could all teleport home.</p>

<p>The second they arrived home, Agatha escaped to her greenhouse. The coven was nice enough to leave her be. Though it had been four days for them, almost four weeks had passed since their departure. Regardless, her roses remained in pristine condition. Once Rio had said she would tend them, Agatha wasn’t worried. She was there only to attempt and gather her thoughts. So many things had happened in such a short period of time. What was she supposed to do with the knowledge that Rio had chosen to save the cosmos—inadvertently creating her children as aspects in the process—all so Agatha wouldn't die without realising she was Chthon and have to wait another few billion years to be reborn again…</p><p>She still struggled to believe it and remained unsure as to what she was feeling. But an anxious knot had lodged itself in her stomach the second she’d left the fortress. Had left Rio standing there alone with the Twins in her arms…</p><p>She picked up her favourite hand trowel and got to work, losing herself in the blissfully mundane task, only pausing hours later when she felt the chaos magic hovering outside.</p><p>“Come in, Wanda,” she called.</p><p>“You sure?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “I’m sure.”</p><p>Wanda entered tentatively, though looked pleased with herself at being allowed back in. Agatha left her to wander around and scent the roses while she washed up at the sink. Then she went to meet Wanda at the trellis arch of climbing roses and pulled her into a tight hug.</p><p>Wanda groaned and gave her a comforting squeeze before letting go and meeting Agatha’s gaze. “That was a trip.”</p><p>“Mhm. You okay?”</p><p>“Just happy everyone made it back in one piece.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“How are you holding up?”</p><p>Now that they were home, Agatha didn’t have much of an excuse any longer to postpone the conversation they needed to have.</p><p>“There’s something I need to tell you,” she said, twisting her fingers together, and motioned her head outside in hopes of sparing her roses should her confession be received badly.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They sat on the porch-swing overlooking the backyard, sharing a joint after Agatha told Wanda that the Darkhold had chosen her as a baby and imbued her with chaos magic for the purposes of preparing her body to become a vessel for Chthon.</p><p>Wanda had been quiet for a few minutes since. Her magic buzzing invitingly only adding to Agatha’s high. Smoking was maybe not the best idea, but Agatha was so tightly strung with Rio off in her fortress and needing to tell Wanda this major thing that might ruin their friendship, she wasn’t sure she would have been able to sit there and wait for Wanda’s reaction otherwise.</p><p>Despite her chaotic magic, Wanda remained very still, gently rocking back and forth on the swing, staring out at the garden. Then her frown grew deeper and deeper, and Agatha’s shoulders grew tenser and tenser in response. She couldn’t lose Wanda…</p><p>“Did you—</p><p>Wanda cut herself off, breath hitching.</p><p>“—did my magic—did you have control? Could you help it? Was it forcing you to have sex—</p><p>“<em>No,</em>” Agatha pulled her into a side-hug in an attempt to smother Wanda’s guilty spiral. “God, no,” she said less frantically. “<em>Stop that.</em> I always had a choice. I promise. The magic only made you even harder to resist.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back slightly and cupped Wanda’s cheek searching her face, heart clenching at the sad, glistening green eyes staring back at her.</p><p>“Red, I swear to you, you’re hot without the magic. Okay? It was the allure at first. And I was always aware of it. But for myself, I always made sure that when we were together, it was because I wanted it. Because I wanted to be with you.”</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda said, still sounding unconvinced as she pulled away.</p><p>Agatha reluctantly released her, shifting away to give her some space.</p><p>“I don’t know what to do to convince you, Wands. I wasn’t sure if I should tell you because it wouldn’t change that you have this magic now, but I couldn’t not tell you either.”</p><p>“It’s good that you told me. It’s good to know what made me the way I am.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Wanda nodded. Falling silent again.</p><p>Agatha lit another joint, because she needed to do something with her hands, and passed it to Wanda who absently accepted it.</p><p>After a contemplative drag, Wanda’s eyes narrowed on an exhale of smoke. “I suppose the fact that you instantly stopped showing any sexual interest in me after Rio showed up, sort of proves that it wasn’t my magic coercing you. Doesn’t it?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, recalling the past week. She and Wanda had acted like they usually did…</p><p>She frowned when Wanda turned to her with a smug grin and a devilish twinkle in her bloodshot eyes. “I was forged by your magic, Agatha…In a sense, it’s like you’re my mother.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “I hate you.”</p><p>“And I’m also Rio’s back-up wife.”</p><p>“I will literally kill you with my bare hands if you don’t stop.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled, eyes crinkling at the corners. “I don’t know who I would’ve been without this magic. Certainly not alive…But I’m finally in a place where I’m happy with myself, so I’m good. I’m not mad at your Darkhold. Stop beating yourself up over something you weren’t even aware of.”</p><p>“You’re one strange woman, Red.”</p><p>“You told me that’s what makes me special.”</p><p>“I wasn’t lying.”</p><p>“Did Rio say anything about Chthon’s Darkhold?”</p><p>“Apparently, it will find me when I’m ready.”</p><p>“Hm. Knowing how you get about <em>the craft</em>, I suppose that gives you time to sort things out with Rio without the distraction of an ancient grimoire you’d no doubt hide away with for months on end to unlock all its magical knowledge. Less overwhelming too than dealing with these life-changing revelations all at once.”</p><p>“You are desturbingly invested in my and Rio's relationship.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head and studied Agatha. “She smells like roses,” she murmured. “Is that the cause of your obsession with them?”</p><p>“I used to think that I loved roses before I loved her, but after this Chthon business…”</p><p>“Agatha, you may not have noticed, but I’m a bit of a romantic.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips trembled trying to suppress a laugh, because everyone knew that Wanda was much more than just ‘a bit’ of a romantic.</p><p>“I know it’s all the TV I watched when I was younger, but, what you and Rio have—</p><p>“Uh, guys,” Alice’s voice sounded as she opened the back door. “Sorry to interrupt, but the government’s at the door asking for Wanda.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The coven gathered at the windows, opening the curtains to watch Wanda on the sidewalk speaking to Captain Monica Rambeau, Captain Marvel, and a bald guy wearing an eye patch. Agatha stood on the threshold of their open front door, blatantly staring at them with her arms crossed because Wanda had made her promise to stay in the house.</p><p>The conversation lasted nearly ten long minutes and once Wanda was back inside, Agatha cast a silencing spell around the house.</p><p>“Who’s the pirate?” she asked when the coven was settled in the living room.</p><p>“Nick Fury,” Wanda said, looking thoughtful. “He runs an organisation called S.A.B.E.R. They operate out of a space station serving as a defence system focused on extraterrestrial threats…They were asking about the meteorite. They were the ones that captured the footage of it entering Earth’s atmosphere. They wanted to know if I had any thoughts on the correlation between the meteor and the appearance of Rio’s fortress…”</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>“That I had nothing to tell them.”</p><p>“What did they say?”</p><p>“Asked me to come by the response base if I did want to tell them something... I think I'm going to help them.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flashed purple.</p><p>“Not against Rio. Just, help to keep things calm around here. Keep the town safe when whatever’s gonna happen, happens. I don’t think the army has anything that can defend against The First Firmament’s shadow creatures.”</p><p>“Do you trust them?” Jen asked. “To not turn on you? To not decide you’re a threat too?”</p><p>“No. But I trust that the three of them want to protect the world. And I think we owe it to Rio to not just sit around and let her do everything on her own.”</p><p>“It kinda feels strange not having Rio around,” Alice said.</p><p>Agatha hummed, her chest tight, then looked over each of them. “Do all of you want to join this fight?”</p><p>They nodded. Albeit Jen and Lilia a lot more reluctantly than Alice.</p><p>“It’s more about protecting our home than helping the government,” Jen muttered.</p><p>“I don’t think they’re with the government,” Alice said.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Fine. We’ll help out, but in exchange for pardons on what we’ve done and what we’re probably going to need to do, and them leaving us alone forever thereafter.”</p><p>Jen and Lilia seemed a lot more onboard after hearing that.</p><p>Agatha turned to Wanda. “Tell your buddy Captain Rambeau that we have important information to trade. We’ll say that Rio’s a powerful Green Witch helping us protect Earth against an impending threat. Maybe we can get them off her back in the process too.”</p><p>Wanda smiled and nodded.</p><p>“Do you guys think we’re actually going to survive The First Firmament?” Jen asked.</p><p>Lilia smirked. “I've grown a lot more confident in our survival since discovering that Agatha is quite literally God’s favourite idiot.”</p><p>“Fuck you, Lilia.”</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Agatha sat brooding in a conference room in a large prefab building on the response base. The coven stood scattered to one side of the room, a shiny oval table separating them from Nick Fury, who had Captain Marvel and Captain Rambeau flanking him. Agatha was the only one seated in a chair at the end of the table.</p><p>“We can’t help you if your not honest with us,” Fury said, arms crossed, openly suspicious of the Green Witch story.</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>He looked to her. “Something to add, Ms. Harkness?</p><p>“Oh, gross, don't ever call me that again.”</p><p>“It's your name?”</p><p>“My name’s Agatha.”</p><p>“Okay, Agatha—</p><p>“You know what, I don’t like you being so familiar with me.”</p><p>Fury sighed. “Are we keeping you from something?”</p><p>“Yes. May I leave? I’m not saying anything until you put an offer on the table in writing.”</p><p>They were told that contracts would be drawn up for each of them and Agatha saw no point in further discussion until she’d had a chance to see how they would try and screw them over.</p><p>“You need her here,” Wanda murmured guiltily.</p><p>“<em>Et tu</em>, Red?”</p><p>“Agatha, we need Rio to tell us what to do. How to help so we don’t mess with her plans.”</p><p>“So I'm only here because you need Rio here.”</p><p>“<em>Yes,</em>” multiple people around the room said.</p><p>Agatha flipped her hair. “Rude.”</p><p>“I'm sure you have an important role to play too, Ms. Agatha.”</p><p>“Oh god, you made it worse.”</p><p>Fury ignored her and addressed the coven. “From what I understand, this Green Witch knows what we're up against. And all my intel is saying we're up against her. So unless she comes to tell me I have nothing to worry about, things are going to get real messy very soon.”</p><p>Agatha was grateful that no one had outed Rio despite Fury’s insistent questions and subtle threats. So feeling a bout of affection for her coven, she decided to call Rio so she could decide for herself how much she wanted S.A.B.E.R. to know.</p><p>Rio appeared instantly, cloaked in black, hood down, and took everyone in, before settling a blank expression on Fury. Agatha smothered down the disappointment that the Twins weren’t with her. Running a hand through her hair and sighed at herself for thinking anyone would bring their children to a military base. For missing children that weren’t hers to miss…</p><p>“So it <em>was</em> you,” Fury said.</p><p>Rio cocked her head. “Was it?”</p><p>“You stole all those art pieces.”</p><p>“Did I?”</p><p>“We have you on tape Ms…?”</p><p>“Do you?”</p><p>He picked up a tablet from the table, tapping away, and an image was projected against the wall.</p><p>Everyone stood in silence and then amusement as they watched Rio in her tight little leaf outfit, skipping around museum after museum, looking as though she was whistling while she pilfered art pieces in broad daylight and the people around her remained unaware, only reacting after she’d disappeared with her prize.</p><p>Alice giggled and Agatha smirked.</p><p>“I don’t think it was me you saw, Nick Fury.”</p><p>“You know who I am?” he asked, but frowned when in front of their eyes the thief turned into his likeness. Rio’s playful frolicking and picking up random art pieces to curiously examine, looked absolutely ridiculous on him and even the captains joined in on the smothered snickering that filled the room.</p><p>Fury remained unimpressed and tilted his head, studying Rio with interest. “Did you change all the evidence, or only this copy?”</p><p>“I’m not sure I know what you mean, Nick Fury.”</p><p>He scowled and grabbed his phone, stepping out of the room.</p><p>“Hello, Agatha’s Coven,” Rio said into the silence that followed his departure.</p><p>“Hey, Rio,” they said through smiles.</p><p>Rio’s gaze settled on her. “Hello, Agatha.”</p><p>“Hello, darling.”</p><p>“Why am I here?”</p><p>“They said they wanted to work together.”</p><p>“Do you believe them?”</p><p>“You know me, never trust a monarchy or the government.”</p><p>“This project is being run separately from the government, ma’am,” Captain Marvel said.</p><p>“Ugh, don’t call me ma’am either. And if you’re not with the government, how do you intend on granting us pardons and immunity against any alleged crimes committed in the past and in defence of the planet?”</p><p>Captain Rambeau cleared her throat. “We work in partnership with the Department of—</p><p>“Partnership? Pfft. You get authorisation from them, ergo you work for them, ergo you are them.”</p><p>Fury stepped back inside. Still scowling. “It appears all the evidence has been altered to now implicate me.”</p><p>“Such a shame,” Rio drawled. “Maybe you should sell all those art pieces you stole and retire before you’re forced to resign in disgrace.”</p><p>“How did you do that?” Captain Rambeau asked, looking intrigued rather than accusatory.</p><p>Rio grinned. “I'm not sure what you're talking about.”</p><p>“We know that fortress is yours,” Fury said. “As well as the creatures inside of it. Are you a threat, or an ally?”</p><p>“I like to think of myself as both.”</p><p>“Your...” He seemed to searched for his next words as he looked over the coven. “Your friends—</p><p>“My wife and her coven.”</p><p>“Your wife and her coven appear to think that you will save us from some unnamed threat. That that’s the reason you’re illegally occupying land, stealing valuable art pieces, and have gathered an army of extraterrestrials in the middle of New Jersey.”</p><p>“They would be correct.”</p><p>“And we’re to take you at your word? That we’re supposed to be focused on this alleged threat and not on you?”</p><p>“When they come, they will portal in. An hour, and your world will be invaded. Another, and your armies will be overwhelmed. Another, and every living organism will cease to exist, engulfed by the void and absorbed into Oblivion.”</p><p>“Who will come?”</p><p>“The First Firmament.”</p><p>Captain Marvel softly gasped and Fury looked at her. “I take it you’re familiar?”</p><p>“I’ve heard stories,” she said, gaze shifting to Rio. “I heard it was confined to the Far Shore, though. Why is it a threat now? Why isn’t it in the Outside?”</p><p>“It has always been a threat. Now it has finally accumulated enough power to make its move.”</p><p>“And what does it want?” Captain Rambeau asked.</p><p>“The collapse of the multiverse and the destruction of everything.”</p><p>“Everything is a lot.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Fury straightened. “How do we kill it?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Oh, you can’t kill it.”</p><p>“So we do nothing? We surrender?”</p><p>“Why did you ask me here, Nick Fury?”</p><p>“To tell us what to expect. How to prepare. What exactly this alleged threat is, if it isn't you? Because right now, you're all we see.”</p><p>Agatha scowled. “I didn’t call her so you could interrogate her.”</p><p>“You’re asking us to believe a whole lot of nothing and ignore a probable threat right in front of our eyes.”</p><p>“I'm sure if she was a threat she wouldn't have come?” Captain Rambeau said.</p><p>“I assure you, I'm very much a threat.”</p><p>Wanda groaned.</p><p>Fury glared at Rio. “If Ms—</p><p>“Missus.”</p><p>“If Mrs…”</p><p>“Death.”</p><p>A couple of snickers broke some of the tension that had rapidly been building.</p><p>“If Mrs...Death would just answer our questions—</p><p>“You're asking the wrong questions.”</p><p>“What should we be asking?”</p><p>“The fortress, my Legion, they're here to protect your world. Whether you assist or not will change nothing. You calling me here to interrogate me has no purpose other than providing you the illusion of control. So ask me a question that isn't a waste of my time and I’ll consider answering you.”</p><p>“Why would whatever this alleged threat that isn't you, attack <em>here</em>?”</p><p>“It aims to swallow everything, eventually. But I’m <em>here</em> because given the opportunity, it will come for my wife and my children.”</p><p>“So Earth is under threat because of <em>her</em>.” He pointed an accusing finger at Agatha.</p><p>“Moi?” Agatha said, dramatically touching her chest. Enjoying the attention and being repeatedly called Rio's wife. Ignoring the warmth that spread at the thought of Rio's children.</p><p>Her smug grin dropped though, when instead of playing along, Rio bristled.</p><p>An unnatural silence fell, like time had stilled and the air had been sucked from the room. Rio glared at Nick Fury, her face contorting to become fully skeletal. Her cloak came alive, swathes of fabric levitating like floating shadows, and her hood settled across her head. Her crown grew across the hood and a long scythe with a familiar jade encrusted blade flickered into existence in her clenched fist.</p><p>The sharp glinting scythe had the other three tense and Agatha wanted to giggle at the Grim Reaper joke, until Rio spoke, her voice deep and droning, echoing off the walls to their ears. Resonating in their minds like Rio was all around them, and inside of them, filling every ounce of space in the room with her presence, reverberating most intensely in Agatha's chest.</p><p>“Your world is nothing but a pustule on a cyst, buried deep within the rectum of this universe,” Death’s deep baritone ominously rumbled. “It holds relevance only because my heart resides here. My Legion protects it, because this is the home she knows. Were it not for her, you would have been swept up in the annihilation The First Firmament has wrought across multiple galaxies in the last week alone. You continue to exist, because <em>she</em> exists.”</p><p>Rio glared at them with hollowed eye sockets, dark black magic swirling around her. The table and chairs seemed to dissolve into a black mist, expanding outward like thick smoke that crept up the walls. The room darkened, the only light coming from right above Rio, haloing her in an ominous glow. She rose into the air facing where Agatha still sat, heaving in the heavenly scent of roses that filled her lungs and drenched her panties.</p><p>Rio’s crown elongated into magnificent black antlers and she lifted a bony chin, head slowly turning to the captains glowing with power and Nick Fury with his gun drawn and aimed at the floor. “Reassess your understanding of the cosmos, mortal. Embrace your insignificance under the gaze of the Mistress of Death.” Rio turned to face Agatha, floating in the air like a gorgeous spectre. The three S.A.B.E.R. agents appeared standing in line in front of her chair, where they were forced onto their knees, and instantly forgotten by Agatha when Rio spoke again. “Prostrate yourself in exaltation to the great God of Chaos whose mere presence on this nascent planet has saved you from extinction.”</p><p>The air crackled with electricity, sparks bursting from the lights before they went out and the room fell to darkness. Agatha squeezed her thighs together, licked her lips, and then the previously shattered lights flickered on to brighten a normal looking room. Rio and her shadows gone. Fury and the captains still on their knees in front of her, the lingering scent of roses permeating the air.</p><p>The coven remained standing unharmed, gaping, and Agatha brushed a trembling hand across her hot coiling stomach.</p><p>“Well,” she roughly said, shakily rising from her seat. “If you would all excuse me, I'm going home to masturbate.”</p><p>The coven hummed in understanding.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>
<em>My wife and my children.</em>
</p><p>The words replayed in Agatha's brain. The possessiveness, the confidence, and certainty in which Rio had proclaimed them. Agatha had loved hearing it, loved Rio’s righteous anger at Fury daring to blame her for the end of the cosmos. Hated that despite all that, Rio felt as far away from her as she'd been since they were reunited. Continuing to claim her out loud without making any moves to actually do so.</p><p>It was frustrating. Almost as frustrating as the black immaculately tailored suit Rio had chosen to wear to the coven's end-of-the-cosmos-slash-welcome-home-to-us party they'd decided to throw the following evening.</p><p>Rio wore no shirt beneath her fitted jacket held together by a singular brave button. Flashing her lovely collarbones, sternum, and the light swell of the inner part of her breasts at Captains Marvel and Rambeau, who got to enjoy the whole front view of it while Agatha sat stewing in an armchair in her living room with a glass of white wine, staring at Rio’s back.</p><p>They had a full house, Billy and his parents were there. As was Mrs. Hart who after five years still patiently told Agatha her name was Sharon Davis, which meant Agatha had decided to never call her that. Nick Fury and the captains were invited, too. Thankfully, Captain Marvel had some knowledge on Lady Death and had convinced Fury that fighting against Rio wouldn’t get them anywhere. She’d also reached out to some contacts who corroborated that The First Firmament was indeed making moves in other galaxies.</p><p>Maybe S.A.B.E.R. wasn’t as incompetent and useless as the rest of the government after all. But she’d also learned that Blondie wasn’t actually part of their organisation.</p><p>Lilia was up on the makeshift karaoke stage singing a hauntingly depressing rendition of <em>Que sera, sera.</em>  Nick Fury was standing front and centre, eye closed, gently swaying to the slowed down melody. Everyone tended to fall silent whenever Lilia decided to sing, which meant that Agatha was left alone to her thoughts, focused on Rio. Rio who wasn’t focused on Lilia’s performance but rather on Captain Marvel, who was all over her. Even though Captain Rambeau was standing right there next to them.</p><p>Agatha’s ouroboros hadn’t stopped glowing since Rio’s arrival. She’d shaved her legs in preparation, making them silky smooth with magic. Pulled on a slutty, thin-strapped, skin-tight purple dress that complimented her locket around her neck. Had fluffed, curled, and lengthened her hair, applied her make up all dark and smoky the exact way Rio liked it. She’d also handwritten an invitation on three-hundred-year-old parchment and sent it via raven to add that extra bit of charm. Then Rio arrived, gave her a painfully polite nod, and hadn't looked at her since.</p><p>In the past, that would've been the start of a delicious game of seduction to set the tone of their evening. A scintillating contest to see who would break first. Now though, Agatha had no idea what was going on in Rio's head and how she herself was supposed to proceed. Rio looking that delectable wasn’t helping her think clearly at all.</p><p>“Why would she be dressed like that?” Agatha whined when the last notes of Lilia’s song faded away.</p><p>“Why are <em>you</em> dressed like that?” Jen asked from the couch. “This is a house party, not a nightclub for twenty-somethings.”</p><p>“They like to dress up for each other,” Wanda said from beside Jen.</p><p>A lingering guilt had Agatha patiently answering Wanda’s abundance of questions about her and Rio for the last twenty-four hours.</p><p>Alice was seated on the floor next to Jen’s knees, legs stretched out. “Aren't you going to sing, Agatha?”</p><p>“Don't feel like it.”</p><p>“You should consider serenading her,” Lilia said, joining them.</p><p>“I’m going to need to do a lot more than serenading.”</p><p> “I gotta say,” Jen said. “You've been surprisingly not annoying about the fact that you're a god.”</p><p>“Can a god still be a witch?” Billy asked, crossed-legged on the floor on the other side of the coffee table. He’d been hovering around the coven ever since they went to fetch him. The month they were missing had been really bad for him. Agatha felt guilty about making him worry, but also very relieved that he hadn’t been sucked into the Outside too.</p><p>“Rio's always been very good at affirmations,” she said. “I'm sure she's just exaggerating whatever it is I was. She’s entirely to blame for my ego.”</p><p>Jen chuckled. “Whatever helps you deal with all of this, I guess.”</p><p>Across the room, Captain Carol Danvers laughed obnoxiously and placed a hand on Rio’s shoulder who had the utter audacity to chuckle along with her.</p><p>Somewhere in the background, something shattered. Only when Wanda's magic filled the air did Agatha realise it had been the glass in her hand. She watched Wanda deftly clean the shards with her magic, felt the splinters move from her skin into a neat little pile.</p><p>Usually such fine magic skill would illicit praise, but Agatha was abruptly drowned in a cloud of roses when Rio appeared knelt in front of her, a hand resting on Agatha’s smoothly shaved knee.</p><p>Her wrist was gently grasped and Agatha stared at the worried frown on Rio’s face as she examined her hand. And then Rio bent down and licked across her palm, and not even the Kaplans’ off-key duet of <em>Islands in the Stream</em> could drown out the obscene whimper that tore from Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Rio looked up at her, eyes sparkling, and Agatha wanted to be angry at her, but her breath was caught in her chest and her gaze hungrily followed Rio when she let go of her wrist and straightened to stand centre of the coven gathering, not caring about everyone staring at her.</p><p>She placed her hands into her pockets, looking so fucking hot that Agatha muttered a disbelieving <em>Jesus</em> under her breath.</p><p>“You and Agatha have a nice home, Wanda,” Rio said and Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, pinching the bridge of her nose and swallowed down a groan, because of course Rio was still stuck on that. Was she going to need to move out in order to be taken seriously?</p><p>“I'm kicking her out,” Wanda said. “I really need my space.”</p><p>“I own this house,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“We need our space too,” Alice said. “So she'll be entirely unhoused.”</p><p>“If only someone with a magical mansion and a bony butler could find it in their heart to take her in.” Jen gleefully jumped on the bandwagon.</p><p>Such awful wingwomen. Just the most ridiculous friends she had, really.</p><p>Billy confusedly frowned at them. “If Lilia also can’t take you in—</p><p>“I can’t.”</p><p>“You can stay with us, Agatha.”</p><p>“Thank you, Billy,” Agatha said, smiling fondly at him. They hadn’t had time to tell him everything, focusing only on the near-death situations so he wouldn’t feel bad about missing out. How would she even begin to tell him about her and Rio when she wasn’t even sure what was going on.</p><p>Rio smirked, looking between them and then wandered off back to Captain Rambeau. Captain Blondie was standing beside Mrs. Hart picking out a song from the karaoke list so Agatha could relax a little.</p><p>“Thank you, ladies, for making me look even more pathetic.”</p><p>Jen scoffed. “Not our fault you’re lame when it comes to your wife.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda said. “I’ve seen you stare across a crowded straight bar at a random woman for five minutes and leave with her, without a word exchanged between you two. Why are you making this so difficult on yourself?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged with one shoulder. “Rio’s different.”</p><p>“Aw,” Jen said. “We know, that’s why we’re trying to help.”</p><p>“And you couldn’t, I dunno, go sing a sexy and or romantic song so I could go grind up against her? You had to threaten homelessness?”</p><p>“We hadn’t realised you two were back to square one of awkwardly trying to date each other,” Lilia said.</p><p>Agatha frowned. Was that where they were? Did they need to start over? Could they? Should they? Would Rio want to?</p><p>“How long have you two been married anyway?” Jen asked.</p><p>“In this life? Or like all of them?”</p><p>Everyone stared at her.</p><p>“A long time...” she softly said and drowned them out when she noticed the rigid lines on Rio’s back and Captain Rambeau’s earnest intensity.</p><p>“Red, what are they saying?”</p><p>Wanda was staring at Captain Marvel who had a surprisingly sweet singing voice for someone with so much muscle.</p><p>“I'm not spying on them, Agatha.”</p><p>“Despite this being all your fault?”</p><p>“What is ‘this’ and how is it all my fault?”</p><p>“You didn't even fight for me, Wands. Shoved me right out of denial and into whatever it is that’s happening right now. Left me alone and adrift on a never-ending ocean of uncertainty and despair. Rejected by not one, but two women. The most heartless thing you've ever done and you’re already on the prowl for your next victim.” She motioned dismissively toward Captain Marvel sweetly swaying on the stage. “Is no woman safe from you? Have you no shame?”</p><p>Wanda snorted. “A lot more than you.” She smiled, amused and Agatha could feel her magic flowing, readying herself to broadcast the conversation to Agatha’s mind, but then Rio creepily turned her head, almost all the way around on her neck, and glared directly at Wanda.</p><p>“Okay, I'm done,” Wanda said, got up, and left in the direction of Captain Marvel.</p><p>Rio smirked and focused back on Captain Rambeau, who was gaping at her, before awkwardly continuing with whatever she had been saying, beads of sweat glistening on her forehead.</p><p>“Ali and I are up next,” Jen said, grabbing Alice’s hand, pulling her up from the floor and lead her over to Lilia’s laptop.</p><p>“Go talk to her,” Billy said. “She’s really cool and I can’t get to know her while you’re being weird.”</p><p>“Only because you asked so nicely.” Agatha sighed and rose from her seat adjusting her dress with a little shimmy as it had risen high up her thighs. “How do I look?”</p><p>Billy grinned. “Fabulous.”</p><p>“Slutty,” Lilia said.</p><p>“Perfect,” Agatha said, fluffed her hair, and sauntered off in her high heels.</p><p>“Can your fortress take in civilians?” She heard Captain Rambeau ask as she neared them.</p><p>“Sure, but that’s where the First Firmament would attack. They would be safer away from it, bunkered down somewhere else.”</p><p>“We’ll set up evacuation protocols for when the time comes. Do you have any idea when that might be? Just an estimate will do.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “I have scouts everywhere. We’ve been fighting smaller battles. The First Firmament has been targeting loyalists to the Living Tribunal, candidates I’ve identified to take up seats are currently under attack all over the cosmos preventing the assembly of any sort of defence force.”</p><p>Rio frowned, the tension in her shoulders building.</p><p>“Not tonight,” Agatha said, turning to Captain Rambeau. “Go drink like its the last night of the universe existing.”</p><p>Captain Rambeau seemed as though she was going to object, but at Agatha’s icy glare, she gave Rio an apologetic smile and walked over to where Nick Fury was stiffly sipping on a scotch while Mrs. Hart excitedly yapped his ear off.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio said.</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>“I think I’m going to go,” she said and Agatha’s stomach dropped. “I need to go check on my—on the Twins.”</p><p>“Give them a kiss from me.”</p><p>“I will,” Rio said, and bit her lip.</p><p>Agatha leaned in very slowly and pulled her into a hug, smelling her hair when Rio fell into the embrace. All of Rio’s clothes were conjured and had that same silky air feel about them. She rubbed across the soft material across Rio’s back, stroked her hair, and wanted to die when she needed to let go.</p><p>“Thanks for having me,” Rio said, ears bright red as her hooded gaze dragged across Agatha’s body.</p><p>“Anytime,” Agatha husked.</p><p>“Bye, Agatha.”</p><p>“Bye…” she murmured and stared at the front door that shut behind Rio, considering that maybe it was finally a good time to take Scratch and her weed stash, activate the magical irrigation system for her roses, and go on that trip to the mountains. She was out of her depth. Had no game plan. Could think of plenty that she knew would make Rio crumble, but Rio was in such a vulnerable place right now with the Twins, and under so much pressure with The First Firmament, she didn’t want to add to her load by inserting her own needs on top of that.</p><p>Inhaling a deep breath, she turned around and found literally everyone in the suddenly silent room staring at her in disbelief.</p><p>She scowled at them. “What?”</p><p>“Girl, if you don’t go after her right now…” Jen said over the mic.</p><p>Agatha chuckled in delirious relief that she could now blame Jen when it blew up in her face, and teleported to the Dark Fortress.</p><p align="center"> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After appearing in the empty throne room of the Dark Fortress, Agatha pondered her next step. She’d left on a whim, acting on impulse, and was now back to doubting her choice as she considered that Rio might have left the party to get some time away from her.</p><p>“Fancy meeting you here,” Rio said from beside her and Agatha released a breath through a relieved smile.</p><p>“Oh, I was just in the neighbourhood.” She took in Rio still in that suit and any regret at her rash decision immediately faded. “Where are the Twins?”</p><p>Rio studied her curiously, hands behind her back, gaze flickering across Agatha’s face. “In the kitchen.”</p><p> “This place has a kitchen?” she asked, placing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Does your Legion even need to eat?”</p><p>“None of us need to eat, but it’ll be good for the Twins to experience the worlds they’ll live in.”</p><p>“You’re such a great mother,” Agatha involuntarily rasped, swept up in memories of Nicky’s joyous laughter whenever Rio was around.</p><p>At hearing that though, Rio’s face twisted in a mixture of sorrow, relief and insecurity, and Agatha wanted to eat her own tongue.</p><p>Shoving her hands deep into her pockets, Rio—ever reliable—decided to save her from becoming permanently mute. “Would you like something to eat, Agatha?”</p><p>“That would be nice. They neglected to feed me at home.”</p><p>Rio smiled and didn’t mention that there had been food laid out everywhere at the house. Only summoned her knife and opened a swirling black portal leading into a familiar debonair Gothic-style entry hall.</p><p>“You could’ve made a portal to get us home from your house?” Agatha paused, her mind shifting through her memories of their journey. “Oh,” she said. “This is what you meant when you said how you enter is how you must exit the Outside? That’s why we had to go back to the Marketplace before going to the Land of Couldn't-Be-Shouldn't-Be.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Rio said, pretty brown eyes twinkling at her. “My realm is in the Overspace, a junction of sorts, allowing easier movement for me, but not so much for mortals.”</p><p>“I hate cosmology,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>“You actually know a lot about it. Portals and inter-dimensional spaces are your speciality. You also designed the shields on our—on the Dark Palace. The same type of spell I used to hide the eggs in.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“You wanted to protect the things that mattered to you most. So you crafted a spell and gave me an artefact to cast it if needed. To prevent any further damage to the cosmic balance, I needed to recreate the Twins while The First Firmament was still in the area and placed them in that shield while I was held up fighting off its shadow army. It found them, couldn’t break through the shield, so sent them to your Earth as a threat.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha flipped her hair. “I’ve always been rather exceptional.”</p><p>“Yes, you have,” Rio murmured and nodded her head toward the yellow door that appeared in front of them.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Agatha walked into a spacious marbled kitchen, watching as various appliances disappeared to be replaced by more familiar ones—</p><p>“Oof,” she grunted, abruptly met with an armful of baby Infinity, letting out a squeal of delight as she grabbed two fistfuls of Agatha’s hair and tugged excitedly.</p><p>Agatha laughed when a wet mouth was pressed to her jaw, followed by incoherent babbling. She readjusted Infinity onto her hip and looked down into a set of bright red irises no longer glowing, far more human-seeming.</p><p>A miserable cry drew her gaze to Eternity still in his high chair beside the kitchen island, the ethereal glow having left him too. Displeasure was written clear across his face as he stared at Infinity in Agatha’s arms. Both Twins were dressed as panda bear cubs. The hoods on their onesies complete with fuzzy ears on top. Agatha’s heart melted on the spot.</p><p>She loved Nicky with her entire soul, but honestly couldn’t stand other people’s children. She even bit one once, who—in all fairness—had bitten her first. A valuable life lesson taught that day, in how one’s actions had consequences. She truly was an excellent teacher.</p><p>The Twins though, had crawled into her heart when they were still weird little monkey creatures. Unsurprisingly, Agatha had no defences in place against any of Rio’s children.</p><p>She went to Eternity, glancing at Bartol standing beside the high chairs, wearing an apron with the cartoon figure of a voluptuous bikini-clad woman printed on the front. He was holding a spoon of mashed vegetables, in the process of feeding the Twins, judging by their dirty mouths and bibs.</p><p>Agatha deposited Infinity back in her seat and cooed at Eternity until he settled, brushing her fingers through his thick blue hair, before wiping his wet cheeks with her thumbs.</p><p>“My lady,” Bartol said, and Agatha looked to him instinctively. Strange that she’d responded when no one had ever called her that. Well, Rio liked to call her that when she was trying to make her smile.</p><p>Bartol pushed the bowls and spoons toward her.</p><p>“Oh, okay. Thank you, Bartol.”</p><p>“Will you call me Bart again?”</p><p>Agatha nodded confusedly. “Sure…Thanks, Bart.”</p><p>He made a pleased sound. “It’s good to have you back, my lady,” he said and then disappeared from the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha’s brows rose, but she mechanically took over feeding the Twins, softening at having their undivided attention.</p><p>It was only on her second broom flight to Eternity’s mouth that Agatha paused, eyes widening, and looked to where Rio still stood where they’d exited the now missing door, watching Agatha with and unreadable expression.</p><p>When their eyes met, Rio smiled easily and walked further into the kitchen.</p><p>“So what are you in the mood for?” Rio asked, coming to stand a few feet away, watching Agatha still frozen like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>She cleared her throat, placed the spoon in the bowl and straightened in her seat. “Anything’s fine.”</p><p>Rio lifted a brow. “Anything?”</p><p>“Yes?” Agatha said uncertainly.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Really.”</p><p>“No, <em>darling, I need that baby lamb from an underground oven in my belly,</em><em>” </em>Rio said, remarkably mimicking Agatha’s voice.</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>“No, <em>darling, I crave that fish we had on that boat during springtime</em>.”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“Darling, make me that leaf food with the spicy meat and that bread from the place where we saw that weird man with the moustache.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled when Rio sucked in her cheeks and smouldered at her. “Darling, my mouth wants those sweet little round things with the nuts.”</p><p>“I do <em>not</em> look or sound like that,” Agatha lied, fully aware of the elaborate performance she tended to put on to get Rio to do what she wanted.</p><p>“Darling, take me back to Anfa 1745, not 1724,” Rio said with a perfect flip of her hair as she twirled, curling her fingers like Agatha did when casting a spell, and struck a pose that had Agatha laughing out loud.</p><p>There had always been a lightness to loving Rio. To just being near her. Even when they argued and fought, there was an ease that came with Rio's presence in her life. Something that felt decidedly irrevocable.</p><p>“You always make exactly what I want, though,” Agatha said with an exaggerated pout.</p><p>“Because you give me such excellent clues.” Rio smirked, her hands going back to her pockets as her dark eyes settled on Agatha, making heat rise up her chest and neck. “So tell me, Agatha, what are you craving right now?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth went dry, staring at Rio’s lips. At the pink tongue poking into her cheek. Oh, Agatha knew exactly what she was craving. She needed Rio to come and get it though. After everything, Rio still hadn’t said that she forgave her, or that she wanted them to be together again. Neither of them have ever been shy about saying what they wanted. Now though, their was a tentative tension that heatedly simmered whenever their eyes met. It was as titillating as it was frustrating.</p><p>A sippy cup hit Rio against the head, the Twins clearly using their magic to get her attention. Rio didn’t even flinch, nor appear to notice. Still, Agatha moved from her chair, softly smiling and went to touch the spot, stroking her fingers through Rio’s hair, staring into dark hooded eyes that were hungry and wanton as they traversed Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha knew that look, craved it constantly like a drug. It was a look that rapidly unravelled the little bit of restraint she had left. Taking a deep breath, she reminded herself that she needed Rio to indicate that she was ready. Rio who remained unmoving beneath her touch. Like she too was holding back. Whatever Rio’s reasoning, Agatha wouldn’t question it, and swallowed down her own needs, instead going in for a hug.</p><p>A hug that just made everything so much worse as their breasts pressed together. Rio’s hands glided over Agatha’s waist and across the planes of her back, one folding into her mass of hair as the other pulled her closer. Agatha drew in a shuddering breath, her own fingers digging into Rio’s back, pressing more firmly against her.</p><p>Rio whimpered into her neck and Agatha’s breath hitched, aching and needy as she nuzzled a warm cheek. Her hands moved between them, up Rio’s chest, fingers splayed across Rio’s neck, feeling the quick throb of Rio’s pulse. She shifted to brush their noses together, Rio’s rapid breaths drawing the air from her lungs. Or maybe Agatha had stopped breathing entirely at the obvious need Rio had to kiss her too.</p><p>“Rio...” she husked on an exhale.</p><p>Agatha didn't want to take this, too. And then made the mistake of looking up into dark shimmering eyes filled with equal parts want and terror.</p><p>Agatha’s heart jumped into her throat, horrified at the evidence of what she had broken. And released a breath when one of the twins squealed into the charged silence. She let her hands brush down Rio’s shoulders, squeezed her biceps, and turned to focus on the babies.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “I'll make Patagonian toothfish,” she rasped and turned toward her kitchen cupboards. “Pan-seared.”</p><p>Agatha licked her lips and nodded, mindlessly going back to feeding the Twins.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Have you gotten used to who they are to you, yet?”</p><p>Rio sighed, back still turned to Agatha as she prepped ingredients at the kitchen counter. “I think a part of me had always known.”</p><p>Yes, she’d thought they were her siblings, but Rio had treated those eggs with a painfully familiar tenderness and protectiveness.</p><p>“Are they less powerful now? Or are their eyes less glowy because they're mirroring you?”</p><p>Rio’s jacket appeared hung over a kitchen chair and Agatha’s head whipped toward her, finding a beautiful toned back with the thin straps of an apron tied around it. Rio turned with her knife in the shape of a giant black cleaver in one hand, the apron she wore was lime green with wildflowers scattered across it. Garish and ridiculous. Utterly charming.</p><p>Since all Rio’s clothes were made of her magic, there really was no need to have her jacket appear separate from her body in Agatha’s line of sight. Bloody tease.</p><p>Agatha smiled, no less aroused by the sight, but amused enough to somewhat mitigate it.</p><p>“Most of their power has been locked away, given the bodies they’ve chosen. Or rather, the infant minds they have now. My creator said that it will return as they grow and learn. As you may have noticed, they still have plenty of magic left.”</p><p>For protection. Agatha didn’t even need to ask and agreed wholeheartedly with the decision.</p><p>“Are they like Chthon when she’s reborn? Will they eventually remember their past lives?”</p><p>“Your soul is tied to the Darkhold. The same one you’ve always had. The Twins are new beings each time.”</p><p>“They’re not in the Spirit Realm?”</p><p>“The Spirit Realm is for mortal souls. Cosmic entities, blessed with immortality, simply cease. Though those who function as aspects are recreated to bring balance.”</p><p>“Were the Twins very different in each iteration?”</p><p>“They were.” Rio bit her lip, brows knitting. “I just refused to see it because it was nice to have family.”</p><p>Agatha had to stay very still to stop from going to her again. “You still have family.”</p><p>Rio smiled sadly and Agatha decided to swiftly moved on, letting all the questions she had saved up come tumbling out.</p><p>“Do they look like they did before? Eternity didn’t have blue hair when I met him.” He’d looked like a Spanish nobleman, dressed typical for the early 1700’s.</p><p>“They're cosmic entities. They looked like cosmic entities…”</p><p>“They lived like cosmic entities?”</p><p>“Yes, some of their iterations only took form to visit us. In the beginning, I met them when they were fully realised. Since I was created last.”</p><p>“Were you a baby?” Agatha grinned.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “This place, this realm, could be seen as the heart of me. The wellspring of my being. But when I was created and given sentience, it felt like I was everywhere and nowhere all at once. I could feel every living thing in existence. Feel the life leaving them. Their fears, their anger. The panic and regret of a dying soul. It was overwhelming and painful. And then I felt my creator and they stayed with me and taught me control. They gave me presence and purpose.”</p><p>“I don't think you were only created for purpose, Rio. It's clear your creator loves you like a parent does their child.”</p><p>“We weren’t always the way we are now.”</p><p>“You weren't?”</p><p>“No. A cataclysmic event forced us to adjust.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Was it the creation of the multiverse?”</p><p>“No, it happened long before that.”</p><p>“What did?”</p><p>“One day, I was minding my business, chilling in my part of the cosmos, when this hot witch kept incessantly trying to hex me. Or summon me so she could hex me in person.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Really? That's not how I heard the story. The annoyance was definitely mutual.”</p><p>“You were at it for a while. Hex after hex. Getting stronger and stronger. Nothing that could actually affect me, or summon me, but your commitment was impressive.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha flipped hair, “got your attention, didn't it?”</p><p>Rio grinned openly. Happily. Fondly. “Sure did…We only started feeling like family and not aspects after I met you. When we took physical form and partook in the customs of the worlds we watched over. We started doing family dinners and celebrations of anniversaries and birthdays.” She looked at the Twins. “I want them to have that, too. To not feel as separated and apathetic as I once was.”</p><p>Not for the first time, yet for the same reason, Agatha wished she could remember. Her current memories of family was of Evanora and a coven destroyed. Of Rio and Nicky and a Spanish Villa surrounded by forest and vinyards. Of Westview and a bunch of witches who had clawed their way into her heart…She wanted to know what it had been like with Rio’s siblings and creator, too. If only to reassure Rio that her family bonds had always been real and eternal.</p><p>After meeting The One Above All, Agatha couldn’t imagine a time when they weren’t a loving, doting parent. To even imagine Rio as she described herself then, was hard to believe.</p><p>“Why did your creator say that you haven’t been to see them, Rio?”</p><p>Had Rio locked herself away all this time? While Agatha was off spiralling in her grief. Well, she had been alone as well, even surrounded by people. By choice. A self-imposed punishment. But didn’t want to think of that for Rio too.</p><p>Rio turned away, twirled her knife, and began finely dicing shallots on a cutting board.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“The way I felt everything when I was created? I can control it, they can too, but not for very long. They feel everyone all the time. It’s easier for them to remain in the House of Ideas.”</p><p>“And you didn’t go to them because…”</p><p>“It's difficult to be there…” Rio said, turning to face her. “With the Spirit Realm that close.” Agatha chest constricted. “Each time I’m there I have to fight the urge to rip apart reality and bring him back.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly and gave her a tremulous smile. “Perfectly understandable.’</p><p>Rio hummed, fidgeting with the cleaver. “There's something I've been wanting to share with you for a while...After dinner, will you stay a little longer?”</p><p>Agatha had no intention of ever leaving again. “Of course, darling.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p>After a predictably delicious meal, Agatha awkwardly followed Rio into the Twins’ room behind a purple door that had appeared in the kitchen. It held more futuristic devices and two cribs stood side by side. Carousels of unfamiliar solar systems and planets twirled above their beds, the pitch black room beautifully lit by galaxies of stars and constellations shining from the walls and ceilings like a miniature universe. It was absolutely breathtaking and yet all Agatha could do was stare at Rio and her children.</p><p>“I would normally bathe them myself…” Rio softly said after cleaning and changing them with her magic. “I read that it’s good for bonding, but they make it a very difficult and time-consuming task and I wasn’t sure how long you—</p><p>“Being around your power and seeing you use it would also be good for them, I think.” Agatha gently interrupted the anxious rambling.</p><p>Rio nodded, carefully laying them in their cribs where they were already dozing, exhausted from demanding their undivided attention throughout dinner.</p><p>“Have they changed into anything else since the House of Ideas?” Agatha softly asked, standing near where the purple door had been, trying not to intrude any more than she already had.</p><p>“No,” Rio said just as quietly, and kissed each twin on their head. Agatha ached to kiss them too. “I don’t think they’ll change again unless it’s to take their true forms. Preferably when they’re old enough to understand and handle that power.”</p><p>Rio then straightened from the cribs and Bartol appeared in the room, seated on a rocking chair. He pulled a pair of knitting needles and a ball of yarn from thin air. Agatha smothered a snort to not disturb the Twins and Rio chuckled under her breath, smiling fondly at him, before walking to Agatha’s side.</p><p>A silver door materialised in front of them. The same star tetrahedron symbol which had led to the white room and Chthon’s message, emblazoned on it.</p><p>Rio held it open for her and Agatha walked into a bright room, made of about sixty per cent glass. It was built over the black lake with its white pebbled beach Agatha recognised as the view from the terrace in the guest wing. Though she couldn’t recall seeing any structure in place where the building supposedly was, nor could she see anything in the spot where the guest wing should’ve been…</p><p>The moon was full again, shining down on them, and there was no sun, so how it was reflecting at all she would find out another time because they were in Chthon’s study. The one from the simulation. The fireplace and shelves filled with books and tomes were there. The winged back chair stood behind an ornate obsidian desk, and the Darkhold’s pedestal was starkly empty.</p><p>The room was larger than expected, and Agatha smiled up at the painting hanging above the fireplace, brought to life by Rio’s familiar brushstrokes. It was of Chthon and Rio dressed in evening wear. Bartol stood beside Rio in a black bow tie and Scratchy was in Chthon’s arms like he was their baby. She would need to ask whether he was the same familiar, or if Agatha just had an unknown obsession with bunnies in particular.</p><p>What had not been in view within the simulation, was a section walled and roofed with glass out over the massive lake that offered a panoramic view of the water and forest. A small table with two chairs, and a hammock was placed amongst a plethora of potted roses she identified by scent only as a few held differently shaped blooms to the ones she was used to. Most were clearly from other planets, mutated and propagated under Chthon’s will.</p><p>Rio walked up to one such an alien bud. “These you named after my eyes,” she said, gaze glittering with mischief. Before turning to a bunch of purple petals behind her. “These ones my fingers.”</p><p>Agatha grinned back, Rio’s smile infectious as she flitted to a nest of rosy pinks. “Oh these…You got <em>really</em> filthy naming these.”</p><p>Agatha burst out laughing.</p><p>“You’re obsessed with me,” Rio said with a teasing smirk.</p><p>“Can you blame me?” Agatha replied, a tad too earnest, and Rio licked her lips and glanced away, a pretty red flush spreading up her neck.</p><p>Deciding to give Rio a moment to breathe, Agatha looked around the room again. Without being distracted by Rio, she noticed the painting above the fireplace had changed from Chthon, Scratch, Bartol and Rio, to Agatha and Nicky, and gasped.</p><p>Avoiding Agatha’s questioning gaze, Rio walked to the desk where a photo album lay. Agatha rushed toward it, falling into the winged back chair, holding onto her locket as she greedily opened the album and instantly burst into tears at the high resolution photographs of her and Nicky, Nicky and Rio, Nicky and Scratchy, candid shots of Nicky playing and laughing.</p><p>Rio bent down beside her. A lightly trembling hand resting on a black square in the desk, and a sixty inch screen appeared in the air in front of them, a few feet away from the desk. Rio’s fingers flitted across the pad and then pressed play on a video.</p><p>“What are you doing, mother?” Nicky’s voice sounded before he came into frame and Agatha’s shoulders shook with silent sobs, unwilling to make a sound so she could continue hearing his voice again.</p><p>“Making a gift for your mama,” Rio answered from behind the camera. “Look right here at the red light and say something you want Mama to know.”</p><p>“I love you, Mama,” Nicky said in sing-song voice, grin wide and all Rio, and Agatha was two seconds away from falling apart entirely.</p><p>“Pause it,” she roughly said, chest heavy and heaving.</p><p>Rio did so immediately, eyes wide and apologetic. “I planned to give it to you. I swear. I tried to so many times, but you—</p><p>Agatha launched herself out of the chair and wrapped Rio in her arms, hugging her so tightly it might’ve broken the bones of a human. Rio held her back, slowly relaxing in the constricting embrace and caringly rubbed Agatha’s back while she wept into her neck. “Thank you,” Agatha managed between sobs. “<em>Thank you</em>.” It was the best gift she’d ever received and she would tell Rio that later once she’d rid herself of the aching knot that had lodged itself in her throat.</p><p>Rio held her until Agatha’s need to see and hear Nicky again pulled her away and she shakily sat down in the chair. With red teary eyes, Rio queued the videos for her. Gently explaining to Agatha how to work the media player, as though a normal tone and volume might break her. She was feeling so fragile, it actually might have.</p><p>A pack of tissues and a jug of water with a glass already poured appeared on the desk that Agatha gratefully took with trembling hands and gulped down.</p><p>“I’ll give you a moment,” Rio said. “Call me when you’re ready.” She wiggled her wrist to indicate the purple ouroboros and vanished from the room.</p><p>Inhaling a shaky breath, Agatha eagerly pressed play.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>There were pictures and videos of Nicky from birth up until he was six. So many of him and Agatha taken from afar and zoomed in, and Rio was just the best stalker in the entire cosmos. Agatha had gone through all of the pictures and videos twice, taking hours, crying non-stop, not only because of Nicky but that Rio, despite how awful Agatha had been, had decided to make the collage of memories with the intent of sharing it with her.</p><p>On her third perusal, she felt lighter and happier, able to focus on the joy Rio had carefully captured.</p><p>It was difficult pressing stop, reminding herself that Rio would give her copies if she asked. Copies she could keep with her and look at whenever she wanted.</p><p>Sitting back in the seat and remembering Chthon, billions of years ago, in the exact same position, Agatha attempted to pull herself together. She could feel multiple inter-dimensional spaces throughout the area. No doubt secret drawers, cabinets, and other rooms. And could imagine what wonders Chthon had hidden away.</p><p>After cleaning up and cooling her face with a spell, Agatha wandered around the room, noticing that a painting of her and Rio in their wedding dresses beneath the Jacaranda at the villa was now above the fireplace. Pretty purple blossoms fluttered around them, gorgeously animated as they fell around their widely grinning figures.</p><p>Smiling at the happy memory, Agatha looked out the window, across the peaceful placid lake and breathed in the Rio roses until she felt as calm and in control as she could manage considering everything.</p><p>After working up the courage to call for Rio, she was distracted by a pale bloom lightly accented with green and lilac placed near a section of the bookshelves. Inhaling, she discovered just how close Chthon had gotten to capturing Rio’s scent and froze at a familiar tug at her heart.</p><p>“My favourite thing,” Rio said from behind her. “Is watching you experience something you love for the first time, over and over again.”</p><p>Agatha straightened, blindly staring at the ancient tomes in front of her, unable to turn around lest she confess her undying love and beg Rio to take her back. She had no more defences left. Her chest had been clawed open, leaving her heart exposed and raw.</p><p> She stood there, holding her breath. Feeling Rio’s warm presence at her back, and moaned when Rio’s lithe fingers lightly played with the tips of her hair. Affected not only at the tender touch, or the familiar sensation, but at the fact that Rio had initiated the contact between them. She remained very still, her body loosening and let Rio play with her hair for as long as she wanted.</p><p>When Rio’s hands fell away, Agatha slowly turned, reaching up to cup Rio’s face. Brushing her silky hair behind her ears. Breathlessly staring at her mouth.</p><p>Rio’s eyes glistened even as they darkened looking at Agatha’s lips. She trembled, a hint of fear peaking through that had Agatha’s chest clench. She could imagine how waiting around for your wife for a few billion years, accidentally getting her pregnant, losing your child, only to let said wife tell you to fuck off and then go off to fuck half the women she came across, could really break a person's trust.</p><p>“Take your time, darling,” Agatha softly smiled, caressing Rio’s cheeks with her thumbs. “I’ll wait for you as long as you need me t—</p><p>Rio crashed their mouths together. Grabbed at Agatha’s face and fused their lips. Agatha whimpered and returned the kiss with as much fervour. And it was as though no time had passed at all as Rio’s tongue slipped between her lips and mapped her mouth as though she owned it.</p><p>Agatha never understood why kissing ones’ wife for hours on end had been labelled as ‘horny teenager’ behaviour. She and Rio had always enjoyed it. Were connoisseurs of the lost art of dry-humping. Keeping things at a slow intense simmer until one of them—usually Agatha—escalated.</p><p>This time though, it was Rio who bit her bottom lip and slipped a thigh up Agatha's dress, firmly pressing between her legs as a greedy hand palmed her breast. Agatha broke form the kiss with a soft cry as though she hadn’t been touched in ages.</p><p>Rio used her haze to push Agatha up against the bookshelves. She went willingly, clutching Rio’s hair and jacket. Pulling her closer. Needing her closer.</p><p>“So good…always so good…” Rio mumbled as she frantically kissed down Agatha’s neck. “Need to make you feel good...”</p><p>Unable to form words, Agatha rocked her hips in encouragement, her damp underwear brushing across Rio’s thigh. Rio met her rhythm easily, hungrily kissing her again. The shelves dug into Agatha’s back as they moved together, locked in a familiar dance, books falling and scattering across the floor.</p><p>Rio released her mouth with a gasp, breathing heavily. “You’re going to kill me,” she groaned, thigh still firm for Agatha to grind on. Always such a considerate lover.</p><p>Agatha mindlessly looked to the tomes, about to deny it, but she cringed at the disturbing scene. Some of the ancient looking pages were folded and crumbled, getting entirely ruined. She waved her hand to straighten out the pages and neatly stacked the tomes atop one another.</p><p>“There, I fixed it,” she said, grabbed Rio’s face, and kissed her again. Then whined in disappointment when Rio’s mouth moved away, sighing contently when soft kisses were peppered down her neck, across her clavicle, moving to her chest.</p><p>The straps of her dress were slipped off her shoulders and the material across her breasts fell away, exposing her stiff nipples to Rio’s hot breaths.</p><p>Rio who had dark magic wafting off her person, clearly struggling to remain in control. Agatha let out an obscene moan at the sight of her. An out-of-control Rio was her favourite experience. Sometimes she could even sneakily siphon a little of her power. A tiny taste of Death that wouldn’t kill her, but hit like an aphrodisiac shot straight into her veins.</p><p>“Want more…” Rio still managed to check in, heatedly staring at Agatha’s breasts.</p><p>Agatha twisted her fingers into Rio’s hair, pushed her forward, and groaned at the hot mouth that covered her nipple.</p><p>“Yes,” she breathlessly encouraged, stroking Rio’s hair, head falling back to hit against a couple of bookspines. “<em>Yes</em>,” she hissed when Rio’s teeth dragged across her nipple, before sucking it into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even care that she was on the verge of climaxing already. Too perplexed trying to decide whether she wanted Rio’s mouth to leave her breasts so she could kiss her again.</p><p>A hand slipped beneath her knee, lifting her leg up onto Rio’s hip so Agatha could feel her thigh more precisely pressed where she was wet and aching.</p><p>“Rio,” she moaned, unsure what she wanted. Wanting too many things. Her hips moving on their own accord, and she got stuck moaning Rio’s name with every thrust. “<em>Rio</em><em>…Rio…Rio…Scratch</em>…”</p><p>Agatha blinked at Scratchy sitting on the desk and pouted down at Rio who had gone still against her, releasing Agatha’s nipple with a wet plop to stare up at her in confused disgust.</p><p>“Don’t be gross,” Agatha defended like she hadn’t just moaned her familiar’s name, and covered her breasts defensively. Scratch was practically her child and he was staring at her very intently.</p><p>The little pervert.</p><p>Rio followed her gaze and sighed, unhooking Agatha’s leg clutching her in a vicegrip.</p><p>“I must've been doing magic while you were tongue fucking my tits,” Agatha mumbled. She’d been having too many magical accidents of late.</p><p>How humiliating.</p><p>Rio snorted, and helped Agatha straighten herself out. Caringly pulled up the straps of her dress, brushed her fingers through the tangled knots in Agatha’s hair, and then sweetly pecked her on the lips, before walking over to the desk.</p><p>“<em>¿En serio, chico? ¿Ahora eliges?</em>”</p><p>“What? What did he choose now?” Agatha demanded, unsure why she wasn’t having sex any longer.</p><p>Scowling, she followed Rio over, eyes darting between Rio and Scratch staring at each other. Probably locked into one of their silent conversations while Agatha ran a hand through her hair and tried to emotionally prepare for the fact that maybe Rio was ignoring her in favour of Scratchy because she wasn't ready for sex. Which meant Agatha needed to calm the fuck down and fast.</p><p>She rubbed her thighs together and froze when her stomach knotted, blood surging in her veins when those all too familiar whispers filtered into her head.</p><p>“<em>Bueno</em>,” she could make out an deep male voice in the whispers before they faded and only the voice remained. “<em>Lo siento por interrumpir.</em>”</p><p>“You are <em>not</em> sorry you interrupted,” Rio said out loud. “Is this because I got angry you created a vessel?”</p><p><em>‘Maybe.’</em> The voice—Scratch’s voice?—sounded in her head.</p><p>“I can hear him,” Agatha dumbly said.</p><p><em>‘Fucking finally</em>,’ Scratchy said, looking at her with beady little eyes.</p><p>Agatha took a step back. “Rio…I was two seconds away from coming all over you. This better not be a joke.”</p><p>Both Rio and Scratch looked at her expectantly. Well, Scratchy looked like a bunny and could hardly be expressive, but it felt expectant. He didn’t even move his little whiskers.</p><p>Agatha laughed. “<em>No</em>.”</p><p>“Sí—</p><p><em>‘Sí</em>—</p><p>Agatha’s heart rate managed to somehow tick up and she laughed again, feeling a little insane. And Agatha had heard the comment about Scratch making a vessel. Heard it and quickly filed it away in her brain compartment of things she wasn't sure she wanted to deal with…</p><p>“You expect me to believe that <em>Scratchy </em>had the Darkhold <em>all. This. Time!</em>”</p><p><em>‘Imagine my frustration with you!’</em> Scratchy exclaimed in her mind.</p><p>Agatha cackled deliriously, feeling unhinged. “Prove it.”</p><p>The Darkhold appeared beside him in a cloud of familiar shadowy purple, Agatha’s entire being pulsing at its presence.</p><p><em>‘I don’t </em>have<em> the Darkhold. I </em>am<em> the Darkhold. Behold the splendour of the almighty Se</em><em>ñor Scratchimus Maximus Prime, performing for your pleasure, my lady.’</em></p><p>Agatha groaned. “Not you too with the my ladies.”</p><p>‘<em>Mockingly, I assure you, my lady.</em>’</p><p>She chuckled, delighted at her sassy perverted boy. Her shoulders easing because despite the bizarre and frankly unbelievable turn of events, Scratch still felt familiar. As familiar as Rio had been when she’d met her. As familiar as the copy of the Darkhold she had for three centuries. It felt so right that Agatha found it hard to muster her usual level of scepticism. Or maybe she was still too horny to think clearly.</p><p>She grinned sharply. “You little bitch.”</p><p>‘<em>Learned from the best, didn</em><em>’t I?</em>’</p><p>Agatha stared at him in wonder. “I get hiding the Darkhold after Rio explained why, but you could’ve been talking to me this entire time?”</p><p>‘<em>And what would you have done if I had? Poked and prodded until you figured out why I could until I threw the Darkhold at you to get you to stop dissecting me?</em>’</p><p>“Hm. True. But now I feel like I’ve been holding you back.”</p><p><em>‘It’s been a very depressing couple of centuries. Not gonna lie.</em>’</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p><em>‘I get it. I loved Nicky, too.’</em></p><p>Agatha refused to cry again. Certain she had no tears left. Scratch and Nicky had been inseparable. Nicky had often fallen asleep with his arms wrapped around Scratchy like a teddy bear every night.</p><p>She uselessly fought the sting of tears in her eyes. <em>‘You and I are going to have a very long chat about keeping secrets.’</em></p><p><em>‘I exist only to serve you, my lady.’ </em></p><p>Feeling the sarcasm wash over her like a soothing balm, Agatha smirked. <em>‘In the morning, okay?’</em></p><p><em>‘Of course. One thing that never changes is the two of you fucking like rabbits.’</em></p><p><em>‘Ironic coming from you.’</em></p><p><em>‘I'm asexual. Not sex-repulsed, just don't give a fuck. The two of you have turned me immune. Also technically not a rabbit.’</em></p><p>Agatha grinned and slowly walked toward the desk and stroked across the cover of the Darkhold. Over that same star tetrahedron symbol that seemed to belong to Chthon and hadn’t been present on the copy of the Darkhold she’d held. Burning violet embers tickled her fingertips, sending the hairs on her arms standing upright.</p><p>The copy had always felt like it was trying to take from her in the same way it withheld things. The original Darkhold though, remarkably, felt like Scratchy. Not tactilely, of course, but in the feeling it evoked. Like when she clutched Scratch to her chest to calm and soothe herself.</p><p>What extraordinary magic Chthon had… Ancient and forbidden. So much power packaged into a tiny vessel. Right there beneath her fingertips, existing only for her to wield and to control…</p><p>Agatha bit her lip and shuddered, stomach knotting in anticipation. Her fingers slipped beneath the cover, slightly lifting it, wondering if she could finally make Rio happy again by remembering, and then stopped short. Fingers trembling with restraint sliding away from the temptation.</p><p>Instead, she bent down to place a kiss onto Scratchy’s head, breathing in the scent of shortbread and custard, the only thing that had kept her relatively sane after losing her family and her mind. Her chest tightened when Scratchy gently pressed back into the kiss.</p><p><em>‘I love you, my handsome boy.’</em></p><p><em>‘Yeah, yeah. Love you, too. Obviously. But you really fucked up this time. So go make your gesture, I'll be here.’</em></p><p><em>‘Here? You just move around now without needing to be summoned?’</em></p><p><em>‘This is home,’ </em>he said, stretching on his side and kicking out his hindlegs. <em>‘It's safe for me to do so here.’</em></p><p><em>‘Oh. Okay.’ </em></p><p><em>‘Yeah. Now go, before Rio's blue balls implode into a black hole.’</em></p><p>Agatha snorted, unbelievably fond and relieved that the Darkhold was familiar to her. Connected to her. Already a part of her. Even Scratchy suddenly talking felt evident and right. Fated.</p><p>“I’ll leave you to it, then,” Rio said and Agatha spun around. “Once you get your power back, you’ll be able to control the doors and access the rest of the house.” She smiled bashfully, eyes shining with joy, with genuine happiness for Agatha.</p><p>Agatha closed the short distance and touched Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“Call me, and I’ll come get you,” Rio murmured, longingly leaning into her palm. “I know it must have been torture without the Darkhold.”</p><p>“It’s been worse without you.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted in surprise and her cheeks turned a pretty shade of pink, prompting Agatha to hungrily kiss her again.</p><p align="center"> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha was led by her hand toward the dark double doors, where Rio let go to pull them open for her. It had been easier when they were still touching. To bask in the warmth and surety of Rio’s hand in hers and not get caught up in her head.</p><p>Her thoughts immediately went to Scratchy. To the Darkhold. She could feel his comforting presence as always. Maybe she should have at least taken a look—</p><p><em>‘No,</em>’ Scratchy said. <em>‘Stop running. I’m tired.’</em></p><p><em>‘I think I preferred it when you didn’t speak and simply allowed me to distract myself.’</em></p><p><em>‘Oh, I’m sure…’</em></p><p>Chastised and chagrined at being called out by her familiar, Agatha brushed a loose strand of hair behind her ear and tentatively walked into the bedroom. Fine. So it wasn’t really the Darkhold she was focused on. For once. No, Agatha was second-guessing her next steps. Whether they were moving too fast. She didn’t do well with self-doubt. Wanting Rio had always been easy. When Agatha had been deemed too young to be with, chasing after Rio had been an exhilarating challenge leading toward an inevitable conclusion.</p><p>Now that they’d stopped kissing and the excitement of the Darkhold revelation had lessened, Agatha couldn’t help but wonder whether she was going about things the right way, and was frustrating herself with the thought. As anxious as she’d been on the night of their hand-fasting ceremony, but even then, she’d been determined. Knowing what Rio wanted had made things less nerve-wracking.</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Would you like a drink?” she asked as the doors shut and disappeared.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip and watched Rio walk over to the wet bar with relaxed shoulders and confident strides. And missed the Rio of a few minutes ago, who had been leaking shadowy power, too overcome by want for her to form a complete sentence.</p><p>“No. Thank you,” she mumbled and awkwardly halted in front of the recliner by the window, having followed after Rio on impulse.</p><p>The bedroom was located up high and she took in the beautiful greyscale landscape, fixing on a glassy onyx pyramid in the distance. Slightly smaller than the Great Pyramid of Giza if she was judging the distance correctly. It was lit up in the silvery glow of the moonlight and she stared at it as she tried to pull herself together. Carefully breathing through her nose, tense and angry at herself for not just—</p><p>She yelped at the pinch to her ass-cheek, spinning around to face a wide grin and mischievous eyes.</p><p>“You’re hot when you brood in the moonlight.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, and leaned back against the window glass, crossing her arms over her chest. She blew a stray strand of hair from her face, and tried not to smile at Rio.</p><p>“I know there’s a lot to think about,” Rio said, taking a step closer. “But if you like, we don’t need to think tonight.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her gaze dragging along Rio’s body before meeting her eyes again. “It’s been a while…”</p><p>“We’ve been apart longer.”</p><p>Agatha had always exercised careful control over who she allowed into her bed. The when and the how, and especially the how-long.</p><p>She exhaled. “It’s been two centuries since I’ve given away control.”</p><p>Rio’s tongue poked into her cheek. “If you wanna be in control, Agatha…you can be.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to be in control. Well, she did. But not tonight. They went with what the mood called for, or they fought each other for control. The outcome was always enjoyable for them both. It had only ever mattered when Agatha had been a hateful mess and the only control she’d felt in her life was when Rio had granted it to her.</p><p>She needed to move as far away from that dynamic as possible. Didn’t need the reminder of how selfish she’d been. She wanted to be vulnerable. To show Rio that she had changed. That Rio could trust her again. Things were still so fragile between them. She couldn’t risk a stray memory breaking them and Rio disappearing for another two hundred years.</p><p>The scent of roses washed over her, clouding her mind and senses when Rio stepped into her space, tilted her chin up, and brushed their lips together. Long fingers cupped her face, delicately holding her as Rio deepened the kiss, slanting her head at the perfect angle.</p><p>Agatha sighed into the pressure. Her arms falling to her sides where she placed them behind her back, pinning her hands against the glass with her body. Avidly listening to the sharp inhales, gentle hums, and needy whimpers that slipped from Rio’s throat.</p><p>Agatha had missed her so much.</p><p>It didn’t help that Rio’s mouth was pure sin. An irresistible temptation. Her entire body grew tense with the restraint it took to not grab Rio and pull her closer.</p><p>She whimpered when Rio sucked on her bottom lip and broke the kiss. Dazedly watched as Rio took two steps back until the fog of roses left and Agatha had enough bland air to think clearly.</p><p>She blinked slowly as Rio thoughtfully studied her.</p><p>“Would you like me to walk you home?” Rio gently asked.</p><p>The statement brought a knot to Agatha’s throat, because Rio could be so careful with her. So tender. Even when she didn’t deserve it. Especially when she didn’t deserve it.</p><p>“No. No... I just don't want to ruin things by acting on my wants.”</p><p>“And you want to have sex?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“I want to have sex, too. Sex has never been our problem.”</p><p>This was all Wanda’s fault. Fucking Wanda the consummate romantic and her speech about sex and feelings. Agatha had separated it just fine with other women. But Rio…</p><p>“I can't.”</p><p>“Okay. Is there anything else you want? Would you like to go back to your study?”</p><p>And it was just infuriating that Rio was giving her everything she needed without giving her anything she really wanted.</p><p>“I want to know where your head’s at!” she shouted, because honestly, Agatha wasn’t sure how long she could keep going like this. Not acting on her wants. It’s what she did. She wanted and she took. Simple. Uncomplicated.</p><p>Rio’s brows rose and she opened her mouth—</p><p>“No.” Agatha stopped her from speaking.</p><p>Despite what everyone might think, her and Rio’s relationship had always been uncomplicated. Effortless. Agatha loved her and she loved Agatha and that was it. No doubt, no confusion. A solid foundation they’d built their life on that had crumbled apart and now what was she supposed to do with the broken remnants caused by her mistakes?</p><p><em>God, just rebuild it</em>, an annoyed voice sounding remarkably like Jen’s, echoed in her mind.</p><p>“No?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I don't want you to tell me.”</p><p>“You don't want me to tell you what you want to know?”</p><p>“I don't want to pressure you into telling me how you feel just so I can calm the fuck down and have the sex with you I really want.”</p><p>“Agatha—</p><p>“I want you to take your time. It's important to me that you know you can.”</p><p>“So you're punishing both of us because you're trying to be considerate?”</p><p>“Putting it like that is just rude, Rio.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Will you let me speak?”</p><p>“If you must.”</p><p>“I'm still struggling to let go of a few things. What I do know is that I missed you and I want to express that by making you cum a few times. Specifically with my mouth. And if you ask very nicely, I'll let you go down on me, too.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a little laugh even as heat bloomed in her belly. She loved the way Rio moved, tasted and felt against every stroke of her tongue…Had spent many a night and day picturing it as she feverishly touched herself. Recalling from memory the sensuous sounds Rio would make—</p><p>“I don't feel much of anything toward the grander cosmos, Agatha.” Agatha snapped out of her thoughts and focused back on Rio’s now earnest gaze. “I love my family. A pleasant, mellow kind of love that brings me comfort. The way I love you...it can be overwhelming at times. You hurt me a lot, like only you can. I know I should’ve told you then how everything was affecting me, but I didn't want to prioritise my own feelings over what Nicky needed from us.”</p><p>“Rio, no—</p><p>“I know, I know. But feelings are hard.” She ran a hand through her hair with a self-deprecating smile. “They're still difficult for me even after all this time. I try for you and its always worth it. I'm a lot less hurt than I was before... But I worry you’re gonna push me away again. It's not like you've given any indication that you will, but I’m not very rational when it comes to you. And I'm also still so angry, but that’s manageable. I can divert it into other things. It’s the hurt that still has me terrified, worried that maybe this is finally the end for us.”</p><p>“What? <em>Why</em>?” Agatha moved forward, and Rio tensed, so she stopped and leaned back against the window.</p><p>“When we argue about things that matter,” Rio continued, “you implode and I shut down. We’re aware it’s not the best way to deal with things, but forcing communication when we’re not ready makes it so much worse. So we take our time, using how much we have available to us to get over ourselves. Usually, you throw yourself into a project or behind a goal and I become Death, but this time...”</p><p>“But this time what?”</p><p>“You've never strayed before.” Agatha flinched. “We've had plenty of arguments. Once we remained separated for a thousand years. And not Earth years, either, like Jupiter years. My creator refers to that time as The Thousand Year War.”</p><p>Agatha smirked at the dramatics of The One Above All. “What was the argument about?”</p><p>“We’ve sworn to never speak about that in case we start all over again.”</p><p>“Of course.” Agatha nodded sagely. “Please continue.”</p><p>“We remained loyal throughout that time, we didn't—I understand losing Nicky can’t compare to anything else we’ve been through. But I'm hesitant now…because…Do you know what it's like to like someone, but also want to kill them? To be grateful that Wanda's in your life yet wanting to delete her from existence for ever having touched you?”</p><p>“Rio, there’s no—</p><p>“I love that you had her, I hate that you had her and not me. Because I look at you and Wanda, and your<em> friendship </em>and the life you built with her<em>. </em>At how calm you are around her. How you trust and confide in her…And I wonder and worry, that what if Wanda is better for you—</p><p>“<em>No</em>,” Agatha fused her back to the glass, clenching her fists to keep from grabbing Rio and shaking that thought out of her head. “It was time, okay? Just the timing of it. Seeing her not dealing with her grief held up a giant mirror I couldn’t ignore anymore. And still I was going to take her magic. She spared me and I started mentoring her with the sole intent to kill her. It was her and the coven looking to me for guidance and protection, needing me, creating this makeshift family, that made me realise just how tired I was of pretending that I hadn’t fucked up my entire life. They forced me to deal with my loss and my mistakes. My biggest regret…”</p><p>Rio stared at the floor, still looking uncertain. “When Scratch told me you and Wanda had destroyed the copy of the Darkhold together, I thought you'd made your choice. That you no longer wanted what the Darkhold promised. That you wanted a simpler existence.”</p><p>“I could hardly make the best decision when I didn't know what my options were.”</p><p>Rio hung her head guiltily.</p><p>“Did Scratchy tell you anything else?” Agatha asked. God, what must he have thought of Agatha and the awful decisions she'd made over the last couple of centuries.</p><p>“He's loyal to you first. He wouldn't tell me anything you wouldn't want me to know.” Rio gnawed at her bottomlip and averted her gaze. “I looked into Wanda's mind. I needed to know her intentions.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“I won't share her private thoughts with you.”</p><p>Agatha snorted at the hypocrisy. Not calling it out since Rio was clearly aware judging by the look on her face.</p><p>“Look into my mind, too,” Agatha said. “Then you'll see the truth and you won't need to worry about what I want and how I feel, because you’ll know.”</p><p>“No. I've never looked and I don't ever intend to.”</p><p>“You're very hot when you respect my boundaries.”</p><p>“I'm always hot.”</p><p>Agatha hummed her agreement.</p><p>“Wanda's great, Rio. A wonderful friend. But she’s not for me. <em>You're</em> for me. Just give me more time. I’ll show you.”</p><p>Rio hesitantly met her gaze. “Well, if you’re willing to do that, I’m going to ask something very selfish of you.”</p><p>“Be as selfish as you want to be.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Just don't give up on me, please.”</p><p>Rio’s shimmering eyes rapidly searched her face. “You’re it for me, which is why the thought of losing you is so terrifying.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to say that her fate was sealed too. That Rio wouldn’t lose her. But what use would words be when Rio already didn’t believe her? When she’d already callously and mercilessly pushed Rio out of her life once before.</p><p>“What do you need, darling?”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, eyes darting away. “I need you to wait a little longer before receiving your memories.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows knitted. The one thing she’d been certain of, was that Rio wanted Chthon back.</p><p>“I would like us to reach a place of certainty first,” Rio murmured. “So that you don't think that things got better because you remembered, and I don't feel like I need to rush myself because you remembered. It feels very important that the you and I we are now find each other as we are. Does that make sense?”</p><p>It did. “It does.”</p><p>“When Scratch gives you access to your core memories, you’ll remember significant details from your life before. People you were close to, things you held dear that are no longer around. You’ll mourn them and miss them. It's always been the most difficult adjustment and something I supported you through...I would like us to be in a place where I can be that for you.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly. “I would like that too.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes. I just need to feel like we're working toward something, not this current haze of uncertainty where I don’t know what to do or how to act around you. It’s <em>weird</em>, Rio.”</p><p>“We <em>are</em> working toward something, doesn't it feel like we have been?”</p><p>“You have a million other things going on. I wasn't sure.”</p><p>“I feel so much better than I did a week ago.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and softened. “Me too.”</p><p>“You can still ask Scratchy about receiving your power.”</p><p>“I don’t need my memory to cast the spells?”</p><p>“The spells are the easiest for you. They come naturally, so you can learn them from the source if you like. Scratch will provide you whatever you need.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“May we have sex now?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, thinking about what Lilia had said. Thinking about rebuilding what she’d torn down. “I'll have sex with you after you go on a date with me.”</p><p>Surprise, intrigue and delight lit up Rio’s pretty face. “Yeah? Where will you take me?” she asked through an impish grin and any regret at the inane request dissipated.</p><p>Absurdly, the thought of driving somewhere with Rio popped into Agatha's head. One hand on the steering wheel, the other resting on Rio's thigh. Rio covering that hand with her own. The Twins in the backseat. Agatha hated driving, yet that image got emblazoned in her brain. Also not a date, so she had no idea what they would do.</p><p>“It's a surprise.”</p><p>“For the both of us?”</p><p>“Yes. Why can't I also enjoy our date?”</p><p>Rio laughed and Agatha’s heart fluttered like she was eighteen again.</p><p>“The last time I dated was you in the early 1700s, so cut me some slack.”</p><p>“I’ve married you twenty-seven times, Agatha. We’re very good at dating each other.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted. “How many times have we separated?”</p><p>“We've had a few voluntary separations.”</p><p>“A few?”</p><p>“Yes, when we reached an impasse and realised we needed a break or risk arguing forever. You go off to cause trouble, I focus on my job, and we let ourselves miss each other…and then after a while...” Rio swallowed, staring at Agatha’s mouth and huskily said, “Our reunions usually get us over whatever it was.”</p><p>Agatha nodded knowingly.</p><p>“Only twice has our separation felt like something that could be permanent. One of which we’re currently coming back from. The other I told you about earlier.”</p><p>“But we’ve always gotten back together.” Agatha felt the need to remind her.</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yes, we have. We like weddings. Well, we like our own weddings and rubbing our epic love in people’s faces.”</p><p>That sounded about right.</p><p> Rio’s eyes sparkled. “Will you dress up for me on our date?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Would you expect me to dress up for you?”</p><p>“That would be nice.”</p><p>“Will you try to cop a feel?”</p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p>Rio took a step closer. “I wore this suit for you. Do you like it?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed and nodded, playing with the button on Rio’s jacket until it popped open. She drew in a breath, her fingers trailing the length of Rio’s abdomen. Warm smooth skin twitching beneath her touch.</p><p>Sometimes, because of Rio’s face, it was easy to forget that her body looked and felt the way it did.</p><p>“I've been wanting to ruin this dress since the moment I saw it on you,” Rio husked and placed her hands on Agatha’s waist, caressing over the material.</p><p>Agatha had selected it with that exact purpose in mind. Chosen the material to make the most delicious tearing sound just for Rio’s satisfaction.</p><p>“Did you wear it for me?”</p><p>Agatha pushed into the touch. “Yes.”</p><p>“You invited me to a party and we dressed up for each other.”</p><p>“We did,” Agatha hummed when Rio cupped her breasts, moaning at the light pinch to her nipples through the material.</p><p>“I invited you over for dinner and cooked for you.”</p><p>Agatha absently stroked across Rio’s ribs and below her breasts. “And you gave me the best gift ever before kissing me up against a bookcase.”</p><p>“I took you and your friends shopping,” Rio distractedly mumbled as her fingers trailed up Agatha’s back and found the zipper to her dress, tugging lightly in question.</p><p>“I’ll just forget about your mortal vessel perishing,” Agatha said, and arched from her self-imposed window-prison so Rio could drag the zipper all the way down. Sending goosebumps across her entire body.</p><p>Rio’s fingers brushed up her naked back, to Agatha’s shoulders and peeled the straps of her dress down her arms. “My family loves you…”</p><p>Agatha pressed her warm skin against the cool glass, breaths ragged when her dress fell away and pooled at her feet. “My coven loves you.”</p><p>Rio lowered down onto her knees and helped Agatha step out of the material, tossing it onto the recliner without ruining it at all. She was about to insist Rio do something with the dress, but dark eyes stared up the length of Agatha’s body, boring into her own. “It sounds like we’ve been on a few dates already.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha rasped, stomach clenching at Rio’s hot breaths across the thin, damp material of her lacy panties.</p><p>Rio lightly took hold of the underwear at her hips, kissing along the hem as she tugged them down. Open-mouthed kisses were placed across Agatha’s thighs, the material travelling passed her knees before Rio simply vanished them with a flourishing flick of her wrist like some street magician.</p><p>Any comment on that died in Agatha’s throat when her leg was lifted over Rio’s shoulder, instead a whimpering whine escaped as she was spread open and the ache between her thighs throbbed with anticipation.</p><p>Rio kissed the inside of her knee, caringly caressing Agatha’s thigh while she unabashedly stared between Agatha’s legs. A low rumbling hum of appreciation sounded from her chest, before she brushed a finger through Agatha’s slick.</p><p>Agatha’s hips jerked at the touch. </p><p>“Oh, <em>sweetheart</em>,” Rio groaned, trembling against Agatha’s thigh as her finger stroked through Agatha’s folds. Sounding nearly as wrecked as Agatha felt.</p><p>Agatha moaned softly, aching so badly she could do nothing but focus on the way Rio wet her fingers, absently kissing her thigh, eyes not leaving the apex of Agatha’s legs.</p><p>“Rio,” she whispered a plea for mercy. She’d been uncomfortably aroused for too much of the evening. Too much of the week. Her body couldn’t handle anymore teasing without it hurting in a bad way.</p><p>Rio slid a single finger into her and Agatha’s breath caught on a small cry. Stilling to savour the moment, needing to make it last, and cried her disapproval when Rio slowly slipped out again.</p><p>“Shh...let me take care of you,” Rio husked, filling her with two fingers instead and Agatha curled into herself, clasping Rio’s hair, lightly tugging until Rio looked up.</p><p>“Come here?” Agatha’s voice cracked and Rio’s gaze grew soft with understanding.</p><p>She carefully lowered Agatha’s leg from her shoulder, mercifully staying inside her as she rose up Agatha’s body like a coiling snake. Agatha wrapped her arms around her, holding Rio in a hug as she pressed her face into Rio’s neck, and allowed herself to want again. She wanted to be Rio’s wife. She wanted Rio's family. She wanted everything Rio was willing to give her. The thought that someday she could possibly have all of it, made Agatha’s chest tighten painfully.</p><p>“I thought I would never see you again...” Agatha wetly rasped against Rio’s skin, tightly clinging to her, the loneliness and agony of the last two centuries escaping with the confession.</p><p>Rio craned her neck to see Agatha’s face and softly kissed her.</p><p>“When people fall in love with someone's flowers and not their roots,” Rio murmured, “they don't know what to do when autumn comes.”</p><p>Agatha all but sobbed when Rio’s fingers finally moved inside of her. Her shoulders loosened in surrender and she smothered her face into the cradle of Rio’s neck. The only times she'd truly felt safe and at ease enough to switch off her brain, had been in Rio's arms.</p><p>Rio lips brushed against her ear. “I'll be quick.”</p><p>Groaning in relief at hearing that, Agatha rolled her hips to meet Rio’s steadily building thrusts.</p><p>“Just to take the edge off...”</p><p>Agatha nodded feverishly and sucked on the skin of Rio’s throat, relishing in the twitch of Rio’s hips against hers.</p><p>“And then we can take our time,” Rio gruffly promised.</p><p>Agatha bit into her neck in agreement, smothering a moan when Rio hissed against her ear and drove into her harder.</p><p>Drooling over the flesh she still held between her teeth, Agatha’s foggy brain fixed on Rio moving against her. The material of Rio’s suit brushing against her skin. The open jacket allowing their breasts to press together. Spellbound at the sound and feel of Rio’s fingers moving and twisting inside of her in exactly the way she liked it.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathlessly whispered, lips still against her ear and Agatha’s entire body shuddered. “Look at me.”</p><p>Agatha released Rio’s bruised skin, pleasure building with each ragged inhale. She tilted her head back, eyes squeezed shut. Unwilling to let go of the feeling just yet. Holding on and denying herself release. Clenching tightly around Rio’s fingers to keep them there forever.</p><p>Rio’s smiled knowingly against her lips, and Agatha smiled back into the soft kisses. “My love...I won’t stop until you ask me to. I promise. Let me watch you come for me.”</p><p> Unable to deny her, Agatha met Rio's gaze, letting out a hoarse cry as she climaxed, lost in the wonder and adoration clearly written across Rio’s face, sobbing at the knowledge that Rio could still look at her like that. Like Agatha was everything to her.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>She woke with her face smothered in silky black hair, her chest pressed to Rio’s back, their bodies practically melded together and Rio wrapped tightly in her arms. Noticing the intense strain in her limbs, Agatha slackened her death-grip, then stiffened at the clear betrayal of her subconscious neediness.</p><p>How humiliating.</p><p>Rio’s fingers lightly brushed across Agatha’s forearm, secured snugly beneath her breasts. A gentle caress that had Agatha relaxing against her back and breathing in the scent of roses.</p><p>She groaned at the delicious aches in her body, and placed a light kiss to Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio softly said, a smile evident in her tone.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha replied, voice gravelly, and shifted upward, Rio mechanically turning onto her back to welcome Agatha on top of her.</p><p>She rested on her forearms, lining their bodies so they were chest to chest, hip to hip, legs tangled together, and looked down at Rio’s face.</p><p> After her initial freak-out, they’d come together like no time had passed. Agatha had been so overwhelmed and exhilarated, she’d fallen asleep way too fast. She had wanted to take her time, like Rio had done with her. Now that she was rested and less emotionally overwrought, she wanted to reacquaint herself with every inch of Rio’s gorgeous body.</p><p>She smiled at Rio’s softly sparkling gaze on her. Always able to tell how crazy her hair was by the twinkling wonderment in Rio's eyes. Then hissed when Rio’s stroked her back, moaning at the memory of the scratches that had been left there.</p><p>Feeling Rio’s magic tickle her skin, Agatha shook her head. “Leave them.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip and smiled, breath hitching when Agatha slipped a thigh more firmly between her legs. It was both surreal and nostalgic to have Rio so close again.</p><p>“I missed seeing you smile at me like that,” Agatha murmured, placing kisses across her face. Rio lazily turning her head to allow the languid exploration.</p><p>They liked it rough. They liked to play. They liked to experiment. But Agatha’s favourite by far, was lazy mornings with a soft Rio trapped beneath her. And since she had started being more honest with herself, it was easier to admit that the reason Agatha loved lazy morning sex, was because of how much Rio enjoyed it.</p><p>She kissed her way along Rio’s jaw, dazed by Rio’s fingers playing with the hairs at her nape.</p><p>“I don't want you to make other connections,” Rio murmured, and it took a moment for Agatha to register what she meant.</p><p>Scowling, she lifted her head. “I literally have no interest in anyone else.”</p><p>Rio’s failed attempt at a pout turned into a smirk instead. “I don't want to risk being dumped from the island.”</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened and then her grin followed. “You watch it?”</p><p>“A little bunny told me it was one of your new favourite things to hate,” she said, playing with Agatha’s hair. “I figured it would be fun watching together.”</p><p>And it must be her post-coital soft brain that had her feeling so unbelievably touched and fond by the admission.</p><p>“Rio...” she thickly rasped.</p><p>“We always have the most fun hating on people.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and was about to kiss her senseless when something dully impacted her back.</p><p>She grunted, shifting her head to avoid hitting her face against Rio’s, as another heavy projectile landed on her. Her magic swirled defensively, but a light tug on her hair had her pause, looking at Rio’s amused smile. Agatha grinned back when she felt tiny hands grip her hair, little knees digging into her scratched up back.</p><p>She bit back another hiss at the aching burn, and exhaled, laying flat on top of Rio as the Twins mercilessly crawled across her.</p><p>“You’re sure they have baby brains?” Agatha mumbled. “They don’t understand why we’re naked in bed together?”</p><p>“I’m sure,” Rio said, soothingly scratching her scalp.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha called her magic, focusing on the little bodies making contact with her skin, and gently levitated them into the air.</p><p>She rolled off Rio, onto her back, and beamed up at the Twins kicking and squealing in delight at the levitation. She pulled up the sheets across herself and lowered them down and into her arms, hugging them close.</p><p>Rio shifted onto her side to watch them. “I’ll ward the room. I wasn’t expecting them to be able to track you through the house. They must’ve missed you.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened and she pressed a kiss to Eternity’s head and said nothing. Too afraid to confess anything out loud. Afraid that her severe attachment to the Twins would scare Rio off.  Pressing her nose to their hair, she breathed them in, wondering if Rio was waiting for her to leave so she could spend some time with her children.</p><p>“Scratchy will probably give you about five to ten per cent of your power first.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Why not all of it? Is he angry with me?”</p><p>“Never. Our demon boy loves you. So much he created a backup body for you to make sure you didn’t lose your chance during this iteration.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “He’s a demon?”</p><p>“Summoning demons is your speciality.”</p><p>“Sounds like I have a lot of specialities.”</p><p>“Mhm…It’s dangerous to give you all your power at once.”</p><p>“Like I could short-circuit? Explode? Does my body need to be prepared for the influx of magic?”</p><p>“No, your body will be ready. You built that part into the attunement process.”</p><p>“Then why?”</p><p>“Your first rebirth during the Second Cosmos didn't go well. You accounted for your memories to be shared in increments to avoid the mental and emotional strain, but took all your power at once. You know that feeling you’ve described when siphoning? The invincibility? The high? Being more prone to act on impulse?”</p><p>Yes, Agatha remembered the feeling rather vividly. The rush is addicting.</p><p>“Unfortunate then, that you’d been born into a world where magic users were enslaved and culled, or collared and used like weapons during wars…Needless to say, you were angry. Enraged. You destroyed everything.”</p><p>“Everything?”</p><p>Rio pointed up at the photograph above the bed. Of the shadowy wasteland with the pretty purple lava. “That was all that remained of your Earth after you calmed from your frenzy. The destruction of an entire planet.”</p><p>“Does she keep the photo there out of guilt?”</p><p>“I don’t think you felt guilty. You were more angry at yourself for losing control. Said if you were going to destroy something, you wanted it to be intentional.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in agreement, rubbing the Twins’s backs where they cuddled into her neck, tiny fingers curled around her necklace.</p><p>“You keep it there as a reminder for me to not give in to you when you try to persuade me to not follow  your directions.”</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>“This also isn’t our main bedroom.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>“I’m banned from our bedroom until you remember.”</p><p>“That seems a bit harsh.”</p><p>“You said it’s so I don’t take anyone else in there while I wait for you to be reborn.”</p><p>Agatha grinned wickedly. “Good. You shouldn’t.”</p><p>Chuckling, Rio took Infinity into her arms who had been reaching for her.</p><p> “It took you some time to regain control after all that.” She motioned to the painting. “And by then the legend of the evil god Chthon had grown and spread across the universe. You leaned into it and worked on the best way to take in your power next time. That’s why Scratch took so long to show himself to you. Because of your grief, he couldn’t be sure what affect attunement would have on you. He was only acting on your instruction.”</p><p>Agatha was pretty sure she would’ve destroyed everything again. Just to see the world burn. What use did it have without Nicky and Rio in it with her.</p><p>“I can see why he would’ve been worried…”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “Because the initial increase in power is a lot for you to manage at first…” she said, cheeks flushed and pupils blown wide. “I could help you with that if you’d like—</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha instantly responded, remembering Chthon’s advice from the simulation.</p><p>Rio looked confused at the eager response, but smiled at it nonetheless. “Okay. Good.”</p><p>“How is it that you help me? Specifically?”</p><p>“To counteract your amplified emotions, I’ll attempt to serve as a distraction as best I can. Try to get you to focus on me instead.”</p><p>“As best you can? Can’t handle me all powered up?”</p><p>“You know very well that trying to handle you when you don’t want to be handled only ever makes a situation worse.”</p><p>Agatha could only snort a little chuckle at that.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Feeling equal parts apprehensive and excited, Agatha entered Chthon’s study after spending the morning and afternoon with Rio and the Twins, getting to put them down for a nap and kiss them on their sleeping heads. Her sanity slowly unravelling with how deep in she was, how right everything felt. She clutched her locket to her chest. How almost perfect everything felt.</p><p>Rio led her to the greenhouse section all the way to the back where a glass door appeared, and held it open for Agatha to walk out onto the lake. Onto the same type of invisible path they’d traversed in the void. The black water beneath though, made its existence feel more distinct.</p><p>There was no wind, the only sound coming from the placid water. A gentle hum of magic pulsed in the air and all around them. The moon was full, stars glittered brightly against a pitch-black canopy, colourful constellations and galaxies shone so brightly they were visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Breathtaking and mesmerising in a way that had Agatha staring into sky, trying to take it all in, before she even realised she’d come to a halt to do so.</p><p>“Are those planets or just balls of burning gas? I thought the Outside was mostly dead space?”</p><p>“This isn’t technically the Outside…It’s…me. My creator forged me here in this space by combining the energy from the stars and galaxies with their own power and essence.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha breathed, understanding that it was Rio she felt buzzing all around her, making her hairs stand on end in a most pleasant and comforting way.</p><p>“And don’t bother making any jokes about being inside of me,” Rio mumbled, cheeks pink. “I’ve heard them all from you before.”</p><p>Agatha smiled at Rio’s bashfulness. “You’re beautiful, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders eased, as though she’d been anxious to disclose the sheer magnitude of her being. Sure it was difficult to comprehend when Rio presented herself in such a small pretty package, but like with Scratch and the Darkhold, being there on that lake with Rio all around her, felt fated.</p><p>“You love the sky here,” Rio said when all Agatha could do was stare at her. “And suggested that this should be where we build our home.”</p><p>Agatha glanced again to where the Dark Palace should have been, but only a pretty shoreline ran the expanse of the giant lake, leading into a lush silver grey forest. “Inter-dimensional spaces...” she realised out loud. The entire house must have been built that way. Hence all the doors.</p><p>“Yeah. You’re idea. Different areas are spread throughout the realm, offering different views. Before bringing you here, I didn’t think this place was anything special. That it would be somewhere you would feel comfortable and safe…”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, and shoved her hands into her pockets. Trying not to tackle Rio to the ground.</p><p>“Sometimes we take on little projects together.” Rio smiled, eyes flickering and distant as though she was lost in memories. “Building rooms and halls. Designing and constructing vacation homes across the cosmos.”</p><p>“Not us being DIY lesbians who like to renovate.”</p><p>Rio snorted, grinning widely. Agatha smiled back until her cheeks her hurt.</p><p>“What's this place we’re currently in? A project of ours or something Chthon built?”</p><p>“It’s your closet.” Rio amusedly said.</p><p>Agatha reached out with her magic, feeling more inter-dimensional spaces on either side of her. What a strange an interesting place to put a closet. All that power must’ve made Chthon a lot more eccentric than anticipated.</p><p>“This corridor has a few doors leading to halls filled with costumes, witches garb, designs from each iteration organised by time period, planet and universe. Why you need enough clothing to dress the entire cosmos I’ll never know.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Not everyone can just conjure their outfits like you.”</p><p>“You literally can do that right now.”</p><p>Agatha sniffed. “Well, I like to support designers and tailors. Do my part for job creation.”</p><p>“Okay, Agatha.” Rio grinned. “Your library is on the northern side of the realm, a looming tower as tall as a skyscraper.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. “Show me.”</p><p>“Not for me to show you that one, sorry.”</p><p>“Let me guess, the Darkhold will decide when I’m ready.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Your rules, Agatha, not mine. There’s a lot of knowledge locked away in that tower. Probably things that would be very dangerous in the wrong hands.”</p><p>“Probably? You don’t know what’s in there?”</p><p>“I like that you have things that are just for yourself. Your study is like a nexus,” Rio explained like a tour guide as they continued their walk across the lake. “It connects to your workshop where you like to tinker with weapons of mass destruction.” They both smirked. “And your greenhouse, where I do spend a lot of time with you. It also connects to your stables and probably a few secret dungeons you haven’t told me about.”</p><p>“Stables?”</p><p>“No Andulusians there. Not yet, at least. But a few equine and other type creatures you enjoy riding. Best to postpone meeting them until you have more power.”</p><p>Agatha’s excitement then easily drowned out any apprehension, until she took another step and a circular room appeared, walls made entirely of crystal-clear mirror. Familiar eldritch magic hung thick in the air and she felt it like a caress over her body. Warm and pleasant. Like a hug from Rio.</p><p>In the centre of the twenty-foot radius room, a fluted cast stone pedestal sat with the Darkhold on top and Scratchy perched beside it.</p><p>Smiling, Agatha hurried over, picked him up and hugged him to her chest. Then remembered that he was a lot more of an individual than she’d initially thought, and froze.</p><p><em>‘All good, Agatha,</em>’ Scratchy softly said, rubbing his head against her chest. <em>‘You can still cuddle me whenever you need to.’</em></p><p>Her throat constricted and she did need to cuddle him right then, so she took a moment to do so, before carefully placing him back on the pedestal.</p><p>“Why are we doing this here?” she asked Rio.</p><p>There was no ceiling, no light fixtures anywhere, yet the lighting was perfect for trying on outfits. Her reflection appeared only where she looked, instead of the circular mirror reflecting itself. And when she glanced over her shoulder, she had a perfect view of her back. Despite the presence of the pedestal and Rio, only Agatha remained visible in the reflection.</p><p>A three-hundred-and-sixty-degree unobstructed view of herself.</p><p><em>Genius.</em></p><p>“You like the lighting here,” Rio said. “And you get frustrated trying to cast a mirror after your attunement.”</p><p>“But I can summon and conjure mirrors now? It’s not hard.”</p><p>“It takes a while to adjust to your magic. You once summoned a Titannica demon instead of the mirror you wanted. So here isn’t only safer, but more convenient, as it instantly sates your curiosity as to what you might look like.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and looked to the Darkhold. Scratchy’s bunny form had disappeared but she still sensed him there as the closed tome. The oddness more disconcerting than it had been the day before. The realisation that he was the Darkhold itself and not its keeper was somehow the hardest to wrap her head around.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha glance toward Rio after getting lost staring at the Darkhold, and her breath hitched at the sight of Rio flanked by two of her simulacra.</p><p>The one on Rio’s left was wrapped in dark bondage. Inky braided ropes weaved pretty patterns across her body. Her wrists were cuffed in front of her with leather bands bound by silver chains linking them to each other and a studded collar around her neck.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha breathed out, stomach clenching, and she dragged her gaze toward the simulacrum on Rio’s right. Naked too, save for the thin black bands that wrapped her torso like the outline of a corset, culminating in the black dildo that proudly jutted between her thighs.</p><p>Agatha wished she could see the view from behind them and at the thought, their reflections appeared in the mirror. Showing off Simulacrum Rio’s taught bare ass, the straps hugging her curves perfectly.</p><p>Chthon was a fucking genius.</p><p>The three Rios directed identical devilish looks at her. Unlike the simulacra of mortal magic users, Rio’s were an extension of herself. Like extra limbs…</p><p>Agatha brushed a trembling hand through her hair and walked closer, coming to a halt opposite Rio. Already soaked at all the possibilities. Not knowing what Rio had planned for her only added to the pleasantly building pressure in her stomach.</p><p>She opened her mouth to say something, but got distracted by her runaway imagination. Images accosted her of the three Rios surrounding her, touching her, and her breath left her in a soft groan instead.</p><p>All three smirked knowingly, but only Rio spoke. “I’ll only offer you the three of us. No more. You'll ask for more. Beg me for them. But I’ll deny you. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded shakily, she could barely handle the sight of three right then. “Okay.”</p><p>“We’re creatures of habit, you and I. I still prefer your magic as restraints, but these,” Rio motioned to the simulacrum. “Should you feel the need to use objects to restrain me, I like these ones the most. You made them for me. They're tougher and can hold me more securely. Not entirely, but I can put up an actual struggle if that’s what we’re going for.”</p><p>Agatha breathed out, staring over the fine detail of the ropes, unsure what material they were made of. Knowing Rio would deny her if she tried to touch them.</p><p>“You’ve always preferred that I restrain you using my hands. Pin you with my body.” Rio took a step closer. “Do you still?”</p><p>Agatha forgot about the ropes. “Yes.”</p><p>They didn't have a long list of kinks. Bondage, breathplay, and blades. Nice and simple. Uncomplicated.</p><p>Rio reached up, fingers curling around Agatha’s neck. She lifted her chin to accommodate the touch as a soft keening noise whistled from her throat.</p><p>“No knives...” Rio murmured with glazed over eyes, even as a pained expression crossed her awed features. “No breathplay.”</p><p> “Why not?” Agatha whined.</p><p>“Because you can't be trusted to know your limits.”</p><p>“But we're setting them now.”</p><p>“And I'll spend the next few days needing to remind you of that and dealing with you either pouting or throwing lightning bolts at me in response.”</p><p>Agatha smirked when Rio tried and failed to not look amused, but her smile dropped when Rio stepped away to go stand beside the other simulacrum wearing the strap-on.</p><p>“I still prefer your fingers and mouth,” Rio said. “And don't like any other form of penetration.”</p><p>“I remember,” Agatha softly said.</p><p>“You don't often ask me to wear this, preferring to use your magic instead. But should you feel the need later, this is what I'll wear for you. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek. “Okay.”</p><p>“You also made it for me.”</p><p>“Seems more like a gift she made for herself.”</p><p>Rio went to stand behind the simulacrum, reaching around to grip the length of the dildo and languidly stroked it. The simulacra moaned and fell back against her shoulder.</p><p>Dark hooded eyes locked on Agatha. “It’s double-ended,” Rio husked. “An attachment on the other side, an exact replica of your fingers. Same texture and dexterity.” She stroked the dildo, the simulacrum’s hips rocking into her palm, soft breathy moans filtering into Agatha’s brain. “At the base there’s a spell that mimics your mouth, your tongue…Your heat and your wet...It responds to me, adjusts to my body's reactions…” Rio moaned along with her simulacrum, holding her closer and stroked her harder.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha tremulously said.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Are you trying to kill me? Is that what's happening here? You hate me?”</p><p>Rio chuckled filthily. “Foreplay is a crime now?”</p><p>“You dragging this out is a crime.”</p><p>Rio let go of the strap, helping her blissed-out simulacrum to straighten and stepped away from her. “This is very much a gift for me. I have plenty more, but we both like this one best for general use.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Plenty?”</p><p>“A whole room full.”</p><p>“You collect them?”</p><p>“Every single one was a gift.”</p><p>Agatha scowled. “Who's been giving you sex toys as gifts?”</p><p>Rio snorted. “You remember that workshop I mentioned? You spend half your time in there making gifts for me.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“Half those gifts are sex toys. You incorporate magic into all of them and then you invite me inside,” Rio’s eyelids fluttered, tongue poking her cheek, a flush spreading up her chest and neck… “You sit back on this spartan chair like it’s a throne, and then you watch me use them on my myself.”</p><p>Agatha moaned at the image that evoked.</p><p>Rio’s voice dropped lower, raspier, as she got lost in her memories. “You instruct me on what to do, how to move…Make me tell you in vivid detail how it feels…And then based on how hard I cum for you, you take the toy back and add it to a care package.”</p><p>Agatha closed her mouth and cleared her throat. “A care package?”</p><p>“You make millions of them. Literally. Give them all to Bartie to hide away and give to me at random intervals while I wait for your return.” Rio smiled softly and Agatha smiled back.</p><p>“I guess Chthon isn't so bad after all.”</p><p>Rio was the true demon at the moment, as Agatha had no need for foreplay.</p><p>“Can we begin now?” she flippantly asked.</p><p>“I need you entirely focused on me.”</p><p>“Believe me, I am.”</p><p>“Once, during your frenzy—</p><p>“So we're just calling it that without discussion? Like I’m some drugged-up monster on a rampage?”</p><p>Rio ignored her.</p><p>“The rush of power doesn't necessarily cause you to be horny. Well it does, but you’ve described it as more impulse than anything. Combating intrusive thoughts. Getting you focused on sex has been the least dangerous for society as a whole.”</p><p>The thought of not being in control was rather unsettling and Agatha frowned, apprehension returning with a vengeance.</p><p>“One time, you saw a deer while we were taking a walk and it reminded you of when we lived near a forest filled with deer, and then of our neighbour at the time, a woman who started a rumour that you wanted to seduce her husband.”</p><p>Agatha pulled a face. “Disgusting.”</p><p>“Yes. You were only ever annoyed with her. Easily ignored her before. But in that moment, the annoyance grew into something else. You teleported away before I realised what was happening or where you were going, and by the time I caught up with you, you'd flayed her alive. Her entire village flattened and laid at your feet.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Don’t get me wrong, it was very hot, but you felt bad about it, which made it less sexy.”</p><p>“Well, sorry I ruined the mood.”</p><p>“I forgave you. So yes. Even minor inconveniences can become so much more. Your impulse control will be zero. So I need you to only be thinking about me and how good I'm gonna make you feel.”</p><p>Agatha instantly thought of only of that. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Mhm…You'll feel the urge to fight me on occasion. I’ll fight back. The way we used to. Would you like that?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You'll attempt to siphon my power, I’ll give you a little. It's usually the best way to return your attention to me when you get distracted. Would that be okay?”</p><p>“Yes—wait, no. So you <em>do</em> want to kill me?”</p><p>“You'll be able to handle a limited amount after attunement. It will make you feel good and the higher amount will slightly calm you instead of the rush you got when you’ve stolen it from me in the past.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Agatha licked her lips. “Okay.”</p><p>“Because of the looming First Firmament threat, Scratch has decided to give you about ten per cent of your power. As high as we can safely go. After the first attunement, you usually take a few months to study the Darkhold and then unlock your core memories. Then we do this again, though it will be less intense than the first time. The process can last a few years, but you can trust that Scratch and I will be here to guide you through it.”</p><p>A few<em> years?</em></p><p>“I do trust you.”</p><p>“Good. The first power transfer is the hardest for me too. You'll be in a euphoric state so you don’t have anything to worry about.”</p><p>“Why's it hard on you?”</p><p>“You're slippery, you cast spells without remembering them, so I may have to use my power at times to bind you to a specific plane. I don’t like it, but do I have your permission to do so should it be needed?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I’ll stay for as long as I can, but at some point, a noticeable part of me will need to go to the Twins.”</p><p>Agatha was confused as to why that would be a problem, because obviously.</p><p>“You’re very possessive. More so during your frenzy.”</p><p>“I don’t understand why we need to call it that,” she mumbled.</p><p>“And you won’t like that so much of me left you. Though the Twins seem to know when I send a simulacrum and get equally upset.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Since you are the common denominator, our possessiveness is clearly your fault.”</p><p>Rio laughed.</p><p>“I’ll understand,” Agatha said. “Given the circumstances. Knowing where you’re needed.”</p><p>“Yes, I suppose you will. Bartie and Scratchy will also be able to handle them. Just in case.”</p><p>Rio’s hand brushed across her own stomach and she bit her lip. “You’ll fight me for control. I won't let you have it.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered, feeling the shift in tone and intent. Chest flushed and stomach coiling.</p><p>“You’ll demand more, beg for me for it. I’ll give you only what I deem you can take.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, staring at Rio's mouth.</p><p>“You'll get angry with me.”</p><p>“But I'll like it,” Agatha rasped.</p><p>“You'll attack me.”</p><p>“And you'll pin me down.”</p><p>Rio hummed. “Do you trust me to know and respect your limits, my love?”</p><p>“Rio, the answer is yes to everything.”</p><p>Rio smiled and stepped closer. “Good. I just wanted to make sure your preferences were still the same.”</p><p>“My preferences are anything involving you.”</p><p>Rio chuckled and blushed.</p><p>“Can we start now?”</p><p>“Yes—</p><p>Agatha grabbed her face and kissed her, tugged at her clothes to try and get them off without disconnecting from Rio’s mouth, and whined when Rio pulled away.</p><p>“Aren't you forgetting something?” Rio breathily said, smiling with kiss swollen lips that Agatha needed back on her mouth.</p><p>She scowled at the continued delay, because there was a limit to the amount of teasing she would tolerate, and then followed Rio’s gaze passed her own shoulder toward the Darkhold. The entire reason they were there. Not to just have sex.</p><p><em>Right.</em></p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “I knew that,” she said, flipped her hair, and sauntered toward the pedestal. “God forbid a woman wants to kiss her wife she’s just started dating.”</p><p>“Okay, Agatha.” she heard Rio’s amused voice behind her.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Her apprehension returned, Rio still stood where Agatha had left her near the mirror, watching from afar while Agatha stared at the Darkhold, unsure how to proceed since she’d received sex instruction but nothing on what to do regarding this.</p><p><em>‘Scratch?’</em></p><p><em>‘Finally,’ </em>he said, voice dripping with sarcasm. ‘<em>You know, you</em><em>’re probably one of the smartest mortals in the cosmos.’</em></p><p>Agatha preened. <em>‘Is that so?’</em></p><p><em>‘But sex makes you stupid. Rio makes you stupid. So it significantly drops you down on that list.’</em></p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her shoulders loosened and she felt more at ease. <em>‘What do I do?’</em></p><p><em>‘You ask me to guide you when you’re uncertain.’</em></p><p><em>‘Okay. I’m uncertain how to attune to this Darkhold so guide me through it. How about that?’</em></p><p><em>‘I prefer to be called </em>The<em> Darkhold, but will allow it. Here.</em><em>’ </em></p><p>The Darkhold flipped open, pages rapidly flickering as though there were millions of them, more than its size would suggest it contained, until it fell open and Agatha smiled as on one page there was a charcoal drawing of a hooded, half-skeletal faced Rio, delicately lifting her robes to reveal a bare foot stepping into a puddle.</p><p>There was no spell, seemingly only a reminder to Chthon of why she was doing this. Agatha reverently brushed her fingers across the drawing, before looking to the other page, finding the now familiar star tetrahedron symbol complete with annotations, and finally understood what it represented.</p><p>Three triangles intertwined, denoting three types of magic. Spirit, Chaos and Dark.</p><p>Spirit magic was ideal for summoning and conjuring spells. Agatha had learned that much from Evanora when she was still a little girl. Spirit witches were often leaders of their covens, as they could channel other magicks easier than the rest, which made them integral to successfully performing ritual spells and strengthening coven bonds.</p><p>Agatha had barely tapped into her innate Spirit magic. Once she’d attuned to the copy of the Darkhold, the dark magic was all she felt and used. When she’d siphoned Wanda right before the hex came down, the chaos magic had her so intoxicated, she couldn’t think clearly. Drowned her so deliciously she never saw the trap being set up, the giant runes crafted into the sky right in front of her eyes.</p><p>But Chthon had used her Spirit magic to bind the other two into a very specific cocktail that created the perfect balance and harmony, allowing her absolute control over the chaotic and dark urges.</p><p>Agatha shivered in anticipation and glanced toward Rio who smiled fondly, patiently waiting, and Agatha’s heart pulsed with love for her.</p><p>“Did you know you're in here?”</p><p>“I'm aware. Is it porn?”</p><p>“She didn’t tell you?”</p><p>“No, you didn't tell me, and Señor keeps it from me too.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha who chuckled, Scratchy’s laughter echoing in her mind.</p><p>“It's nothing salacious,” she said, smiling down at Rio’s image. “There’s an incantation here, too. Not as intricate as I imagined it would be, but I suppose that since Scratch and I are already connected, it’s more a key rather than a spell needing to be performed.”</p><p><em>‘That’s right,’</em> Scratch said as Rio nodded.</p><p>“Are you ready?” Agatha asked her.</p><p>“Give me a second.”</p><p>Rio then proceeded to do a series of elaborate full body stretches, cracking her neck and her fingers so loudly Agatha clearly heard it. Then her robes start hovering, her power rising outward, gorgeous smoky tendrils wafting from her, before she looked too Agatha.</p><p>“Okay. I'm ready.”</p><p>Agatha's brows rose into her hairline, a grin tugging at her lips. Certain Rio was just playing around to make her less nervous.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>Agatha looked back to the page, scanning the incantation. Hearing the words in whispered echoes through her mind, raising the hairs at the back of her neck even before she uttered them out loud.</p><p><em>“Enamorath…Emmoreth…Ba'al Set Elianath…”</em></p><p>As she repeated the phrase, her breaths picked up. And on the third repetition she felt it take hold.</p><p>“Oh...” Agatha shuddered at the trickle of power that filled her.</p><p>She bowed over the Darkhold when the current grew stronger, not painful, just more forceful, like trying to move against the velocity of a rollercoaster. Her hands clutched the pedestal as her hair blew back from her face, blinded by the purple glow emanating from the Darkhold.</p><p>Agatha couldn't breathe. Couldn't move. Her eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>She groaned when the influx of magic gradually dissipated and gasped, blinking her eyes open.</p><p>Her surroundings came into focus. Clearer and sharper.</p><p>Still, Agatha didn't feel much different from when she’d had the copy of the Darkhold. She only felt more. More of her emotions. More of her wants. More of herself.</p><p>Had the magic rejected her? Surely this couldn’t be it? She’d felt more when siphoning a powerful coven…Was she not Chthon after all? Her stomach dropped and a wave of panic and devastation froze her in place.</p><p>“Sweetheart?”</p><p>The clear note of anticipation in Rio's voice had her smothering her disappointment and looked to Rio, but paused midway when she caught sight of her reflection in the mirror.</p><p>She was decked out in a shadowy purple witch’s costume, similar to what she usually wore. Her hair was great, her fingers obsidian and familiar, and maybe that was okay. Maybe this was what ten per cent felt like.</p><p>She brushed her fingers across her waist and smirked. At least see looked good.</p><p>A delirious giggle had her turn to Rio, who stood with her magic wafting all around her, a look of flagrant hunger in pitch black eyes.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Am I supposed to be feeling anything?”</p><p>Rio grinned madly and rose a few feet into the air.</p><p>“Levitate with me,” Rio roughly said, dazedly dragging her gaze across Agatha’s body.</p><p>Agatha smirked, anticipation knotted her stomach in response to Rio’s excitement. Her hands moved to cast the levitation spell and then everything went white. Agatha’s body lifted into the air and arched, her head thrown back as a languid moan tore from her throat and raw power coursed through her veins. Like draining a thousand covens at once, unable to form a coherent thought other than yes, yes, <em>yes</em>...</p><p>She heard Rio growl in satisfaction, causing a throbbing pulse that shook her to the core. And oh, she understood it now. Understood why Rio had needed to walk her through it so thoroughly.</p><p>Breathless and aching, Agatha managed to gain enough control to right herself, hovering in the air.</p><p>“Oh,” she gasped, spotting herself in the mirror. Touching her voluminous white hair. The colours of her robes appeared inverted. The usual shadows replaced with an ethereal white. “Check me out...” she all but purred, salaciously brushing her black fingers across her body.</p><p>“That’s it, my love,” Rio whispered, practically vibrating with excitement.</p><p>Agatha could feel the magic surrounding them. Recognised it as<em> hers</em>. See where all the hidden doors were located. The room was bathed in masterful spellwork and enchantments. And yet, outside the loud thrum of magic, she remained fixated on where Rio floated in the air.</p><p>Agatha sensed her similarly to how she could feel Scratchy. Was now more aware of the ancient primal magic that bound them together as her Ouroborous glowed white and Rio’s matched her in a shadowy black.</p><p>But what drew her attention most, was the brilliant energy pouring out of Rio. The supreme raw power of her being.</p><p>Even at only ten per cent of Chthon's magic, she could feel that Rio was all there. Entirely for her. Sense the miniscule fraction of Rio that split between her two simulacra.</p><p> In response to Rio’s preening, Agatha’s magic surged, beating against her ribs like a caged beast.</p><p>“Is there anything you feel like doing?” Rio rasped, lips twisting into a knowing smirk, gaze gleaming with promise.</p><p>Agatha chuckled low and dangerously. “Buckle up, buttercup. You may not survive this.”</p><p>Rio cackled in delight as they flew at each other, meeting in a thunderous clash of power and magic.</p><p align="center"> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke naked and spread-eagled in bed, a leg and arm flung haphazardly across Rio's body and groaned when memories of her “frenzy” slowly dripped into her brain.</p><p>Turning her palm, eyes still closed, she felt for Rio’s head, gave her hair a little scratch, then flung her arm over her own face when the most recent memory accosted her, from just before she’d finally passed out. Of her becoming more lucid, yet still begging Rio for more. More of her hands and her mouth, until Agatha hadn’t been coherent enough to stop her words and could only beg her to stay and never leave her again.</p><p>How humiliating.</p><p>Rio shifted, gently moving Agatha’s leg to close them together, before she wrapped an arm around Agatha’s stomach, curling up against her side, and laid her head on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to her hair and held her close, breathing her in as her body gently thrummed from overuse and Chthon’s power.</p><p>The magic had somewhat settled. Not the raw impulsivity of chaos magic, nor the dark urges of black magic, only a controlled, deeply satisfying feeling of absolute power.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Another rush of magic surged forth, tempered by Rio gently stroking her stomach through it, distracting enough for Agatha to push it back down.</p><p>She hummed when she succeeded. Her thighs coated with a fresh layer of arousal as she licked her lips and absently rubbed them together. At least the want was less desperate now. Less consuming. Had it been anyone other than Rio there with her, she would’ve been terrified at the utter lack of control she’d had over her actions.</p><p>“Thank you,” she gruffly said, her voice hoarse and broken. “You were perfect.”</p><p>Rio lifted her head and kissed her. “How are you feeling?” she asked, searching Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Better than ever.”</p><p>“Good. You were out of it a bit longer than usual. I was worried.”</p><p>“Had a lot to make up for,” Agatha mumbled, cupping her cheek, trying to pull her into another kiss.</p><p>“Your coven’s looking for you,” Rio said, kissing Agatha’s swirling green ouroboros instead. “They’re at the edge of the shield.”</p><p>“Will I ever get morning sex again?” Agatha scowled. “Yesterday it was the Twins, today it’s my kids. ”</p><p>Rio snorted. “It’s been nine days.”</p><p>She laughed and settled into the pillows, Rio’s fingers idly stroking across her skin causing an instant relaxation of her muscles.</p><p>“How are the Twins?” she asked, remembering the times Rio had gone to check on them and Agatha pinning her to the nearest surface in righteous possessive indignation upon her return. God, she’d been even worse than Rio warned her she would be.</p><p>“I'm on a walk with them around the lake right now.”</p><p>Agatha focused her magic, the feeling of guiding it to her will sent a delicious shiver up her spine. She was far less intensely tuned to Rio’s presence, but yes, she could feel a large part of Rio split at present. Insane that she was able to differentiate, considering that Rio was everywhere in that realm. She couldn’t wait to read through the Darkhold and actually put Chthon’s power to use.</p><p>Rio smiled, proud and loving. “They love water.”</p><p>“Just like you,” Agatha murmured. Chest growing tight with fondness.</p><p>“I've barred them entry to the room for now.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said, pushing Rio onto her back and trailed kisses down her neck and chest as she spoke. “Mine don’t know the meaning of the word boundaries, but at least they can’t teleport in here. Are they safe, though?”</p><p>“They say they’re fine.” Rio distractedly said, glazed eyes watching Agatha’s mouth on her breasts, her fingers stroking through Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Agatha leaned into the touch like a cat. “Tell them to come back tonight.”</p><p>“It's night time on Earth.”</p><p>“Tell them to come back in six hours.” She shifted lower between Rio’s legs, kissing across her stomach and nipping at her hipbones.</p><p>“The government’s with them,” Rio shakily said.</p><p>Agatha snorted, remembering how often Rio had needed to distract her from going after the S.A.B.E.R. agents. The impulse entirely overshadowed by Agatha’s determination to go strangle The First Firmament. She really had been a lot to handle and that was going off only the flashes of memory that were gradually returning.</p><p>Rio had the patience of a saint.</p><p>Needing to show her appreciation, Agatha placed a wet kiss to Rio’s pubic bone and settled between her thighs. She spread them wider and Rio released the most delectable sound as her knees fell open.</p><p>“Tell them two hours,” Agatha distractedly mumbled. “Non-negotiable. And they’ll get ten minutes, or I fuck you right in front of them.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers tightened in her hair, her voice breathless. “They said you promised not to be one of those married people.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled filthily. “I promised them no such thing,” she said and greedily lowered her head between Rio's thighs.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Rio left her to freshen up while she went to greet her guests. Rather, Rio escaped Agatha’s clutches so Agatha could focus on getting out of bed without her distracting presence. She managed a shower instead of the spells she’d been using to freshen up, and went to stand in front of the giant full-length mirror she’d conjured without thought.</p><p>After admiring her pitch-black fingers, Agatha ran them through the streak of white in her luscious shiny hair. Her eyes sparkled violet, clear and bright to go with the healthy gleam of her skin.</p><p>She spent an exorbitant amount of time simply looking at herself and how good and right everything felt. As though this was the image she’d been aspiring to recreate her entire life. For the first time, the insatiable need for more, the search for power, had faded into a simple feeling of pure ambition. A manageable craving that didn’t eat away at her, but was identifiable as a genuine curiosity to learn more of her craft.</p><p>How strange it was, to feel at home in her skin, not entirely complete, but closer to it than she ever imagined she could be.</p><p>Dragging herself away from the mirror, Agatha drew on a silky black robe from a closet Rio had pointed out to her. There were other clothes too, all to her taste and in her size, but Agatha decided that she was about as presentable as she was willing to get. Hopefully everyone would be awkward enough about her wild sex hair and bruised up neck and chest, to leave quickly.</p><p>She had so many questions, for both Rio and Scratchy, but was also unwilling to leave the blissful bubble Rio had carefully curated to her taste. Maybe if she kept having sex with Rio, she wouldn't need to leave the Realm of Death. Very certain that it was being there in their home that added to the anomalous feeling of fulfilment she was experiencing.</p><p>The thought of leaving dulled her happy buzz and she reached out to summon Scratch from his pocket dimension but stopped and frowned, wondering if she should still be pulling him from whatever he might be doing.</p><p><em>‘Scratch?’ </em>She telepathically reached out instead. Her awareness of him clearer and stronger.</p><p><em>‘You summon me like always, Agatha,’ </em> he said, appearing in a cloud of shadowy purple, sitting on the bed without her having summoned him at all.</p><p>“If I leave here, can I still summon you?”</p><p><em>‘I go where you go. When you leave home, I’ll be in my dimension, available to you as always.’</em></p><p>“Right. Good to know.”</p><p><em>‘Would you like me to show you how to cast a portal to Earth?’</em></p><p>Agatha’s eyes and magic lit up in excitement.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Her new power reflected in the sultry confidence of her gait, the sensual sway of her hips, and the upward tilt of her chin. Her shoulders were loose and thrown back, not an ounce of tension in her body, as she sauntered through the purple portal and into the throne room to what appeared to be a silent standoff between three distinctly separate parties.</p><p>Rio sat up on her dais, blankly staring down at Fury and the captains, the coven was off to the side near where she’d exited, watching them warily. The difference between Earth and the Realm of Death was stark. Not only visually, but in the way her magic surged, slightly less stable, needing to lash out.</p><p>Magic crackled in the coven’s eyes and palms as Agatha’s new power flowed unbidden through their connection. She was delighted to discover the vibrant blue hue around Billy who was awed and flushed with excitement as he stared at the magic in his palms. Still not innate, but just witchy-enough to have it manifest in Agatha’s presence.</p><p>“Oh, wow,” Alice said, smiling dazedly.</p><p>Agatha smirked and flipped her hair. “I know, right?”</p><p>She caught Wanda’s red eyes, a translucent crown around her face. Her chaos magic, for the first time, wasn’t distracting and tempting, but kindred. Though it appeared the affect her magic had on Wanda now, was similar to how it had been for Agatha before.</p><p><em>‘Easy there, tiger,</em>’ she purred into Wanda’s mind, who had risen to hover above the floor, fiery gaze sultry and intent on Agatha.</p><p>Wanda gasped, rapidly blinked, and then pulled herself together, lowering back to the floor. A relief really, that it only appeared to have been the initial surge that had caused the response. Agatha wouldn’t wish that constant craving on her worst enemy.</p><p><em>‘Sorry,’</em> Wanda sheepishly said, warily glancing toward the throne.</p><p>Agatha turned as well and swallowed down a moan at the sight of Rio, face expressionless, eyes cool on Wanda, man-spreading in a way that made Agatha want to fall on her knees between Rio’s legs.</p><p>Rio's gaze shifted to her, eyes growing hooded, like she knew exactly what Agatha was thinking. Agatha had never felt more powerful than when her face was smothered between Rio's thighs. Listening to the broken sounds that left Rio's throat, feeling the desperate grip in her hair, and experiencing the sublime way Rio utterly shattered apart…</p><p>She shifted in place. Needing everyone to leave.</p><p>“Agatha, <em>please</em>, can you control yourself for<em> five minutes</em>,” Lilia hissed, holding her stomach, looking flushed and uncomfortable.</p><p>Agatha winked at Rio and turned to her squirming coven. “I was safely in quarantine to deal with this, <em>you</em> were the ones who insisted on a visit,” she said, muting the link they shared with an elegantly flick of her wrist, so they weren’t quite so aware of her emotions.</p><p>“They won't leave us alone,” Alice said, pointing accusingly at the S.A.B.E.R. agents. “Just hear them out and tell them to stop annoying us.”</p><p>“So is the hair from all the magic, or all the fucking?” Jen asked, by far the least outwardly affected of the coven as poor Billy couldn’t even look at her.</p><p>“The magic. But the fucking stole the show,” Agatha said and languidly stretched, her robe riding up precariously high on her thighs, while Jen cackled in the delight.</p><p>Fury awkwardly cleared his throat and walked over to hand Agatha a tablet. “Ms..Mrs...uh Death? You and your wife caused several disturbances around the world this past week. We ran interference with allied nations, but we need to let them know what it was they saw.”</p><p>Agatha took the tablet with a raised brow and her eyes widened when she saw herself, all white hair and glowing ethereally, having sex with Rio on a picturesque moonlit beach that most definitely wasn’t in the Realm of Death. And then she vaguely remembered casting a portal. Rio telling her that it would be better to stay home, but Agatha had wanted to go fuck on Evanora’s grave. Had been very determined to do exactly that when she’d arrived on Earth, until Rio appeared and slipped her fingers inside of her, effortless in her distraction.</p><p>She hadn’t even known she could cast an inter-planar portal. Had listened very studiously when Scratchy had instructed her earlier… The little bastard was probably very amused about that.</p><p>“Darling,” Agatha said. “Come look at the porn the government made of us.”</p><p>Instead of blinking from her dais, a simulacrum appeared behind Agatha to watch over her shoulder, while Rio remained on her throne, blankly watching the S.A.B.E.R. people.</p><p>Lilia snorted “Can I have my own Rio, too?”</p><p>Another Rio appeared and hugged her from behind. Lilia startled, but relaxed into the friendly embrace surprisingly quickly. It was so sweet that Agatha was barely jealous at all.</p><p>Jen opened her mouth—</p><p>“No,” Agatha said and rolled her eyes when Jen cackled again.</p><p>“Are you copies? Clones?” Fury asked, studying the simulacra with interest. “How many can you make? Do you share a consciousness or act independently? Do they have your powers?”</p><p>“<em>We are all Rio</em>,” the Rios chorused as one and Agatha’s stomach bottomed out as multiple salacious memories hit her at once. God, so many hands, so many breasts, so many mouths… Agatha bit her lip to stop from moaning and the Rio behind her chuckled knowingly and wrapped a steadying arm around her waist.</p><p>Agatha leaned back against her, proudly focused on the tablet screen. “My very first sex tape.”</p><p>“Your first?” Lilia said in disbelief, comfortable in the simulacrum’s embrace.</p><p>“Why is that so hard to believe?”</p><p>“You're a shameless exhibitionist.”</p><p>“True,” Agatha easily admitted. It had honestly never occurred to her to record herself with any past lovers. Mostly because, aside from Wanda, they were around for a night or two before Agatha had swiftly moved on.</p><p>“Not your first,” Rio murmured against her ear.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“We can go through them all once you remember.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, and looked to Fury. “This is a clear invasion of our privacy, Fury.”</p><p>“<em>Privacy?</em>” he sputtered. “You two were fucking like rabbits all over the world for a week for everyone to see!”</p><p>“We didn't consent to being filmed,” Simulacrum Rio said.</p><p>“At least it’s nicely edited,”Agatha mused.</p><p>“I demand all copies be deleted,” Rio continued.</p><p>“You <em>demand</em>?”</p><p>“Billy, can you put a soundtrack over it?” Agatha asked, tilting her head as she watched herself draped over Rio who was driving into her as they hovered in the sky in broad daylight. Rio’s glutes, hamstrings, and triceps attractively contracted at the strain of doing so without any surface to balance against. For some reason seemingly only using her magic to keep them in the air. “Something fast-paced, but meaningful.”</p><p>“I'm not going anywhere near that,” Billy said.</p><p>“Look at me go.” Rio chuckled at a clip of them on the White House lawn, a shield around them keeping the Secret Service at bay. “Don’t know why you suddenly pretended to hate scissoring,” she whispered into Agatha’s ear. “And then begged me to cum all over your pussy…”</p><p>Agatha moaned and rubbed up against her. “I hate the <em>terminology</em>, not the act.”</p><p>They both knew how much she loved feeling Rio warm and wet between her thighs. That there was nothing that made Agatha cum faster than feeling Rio spill all over her lap. Agatha whimpered at the thought, at the vivid memories, and reached up to thread her black fingers into Rio's hair. “If you don't stop, darling, I will fuck you in front of everyone here,” she roughly promised.</p><p>Fury coughed, taking a few steps away from them, and Agatha lazily smirked when she made eye contact with a red and flustered Captain Marvel. Captain Rambeau was intently studying a wall.</p><p>“May I tell them to go?” Rio asked. “You clearly aren't ready to be unleashed onto the public.” She glared over at Wanda. “You might be taken advantage of.”</p><p>Wanda scoffed and Agatha stared over at her coven, who had been dealing with the PDA in their stride. Aside from Billy, who had turned his back on the scene and had covered his ears with his hands.</p><p>“You two are disgusting,” Jen said through a wide smile. “Just hear them out so they'll stop bothering us, please.”</p><p>“Do you think we can sue them?” Agatha wondered, looking into Rio’s face so close to hers.</p><p>“We were recording what appeared to be a threat—</p><p>“Here we are in a desert,” Agatha said, flipping through the clips on the tablet. “Oh, in the Appalachian Mountains, and is this…the Amazon?” she asked Rio, who nodded. “Such remote and private locations.”</p><p>“You were flying across the sky and <em>glowing</em>.”</p><p>“She always glows,” Rio said. “Because of her purity and innocence, which the United States government has taken from her with this heinous violation.”</p><p>“You defaced Mount Rushmore.”</p><p>Rio snickered. “De-<em>faced</em>.”</p><p>“I did that for the children,” Agatha said.</p><p>“You decapitated the statue of Liberty! You straightened the Leaning Tower of Pisa! You took out the top part of the Burj Khalifa and shattered every window in a ten-mile radius!”</p><p>“Dubai’s so gaudy,” Agatha said. “Built on genocide and slave labour, you know. Isn’t that right, Billy?” she asked his back.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s really disgusting how much people allow the wealthy to get away—</p><p>“You know what? This is revenge porn is what it is,” she told Fury.</p><p>Billy giggled even though his ears were still covered. “Not what revenge porn means, Agatha.”</p><p>Fury pinched the bridge of his nose. “Fine. You know what, just do with that what you did with the evidence of your thefts so I can get the world off my ass while we focus on the real threat instead of you two kinky freaks. Okay?”</p><p>“I’m not making it look like you’re fucking my wife, Fury!” Rio dramatically exclaimed. “What is <em>wrong</em> with you?”</p><p>Fury glared at her, a thick vein throbbing against his temple. “Make it not exist anymore. Scrub it from my brain, too.”</p><p>Rio smiled sinisterly sweet. “Already taken care of.”</p><p>Fury grumbled something under his breath that Agatha didn’t pay attention to, but was no doubt some colourful cursing. Too busy watching herself getting railed on top of the Eiffel Tower. She remembered the first time visiting all those places in the video clips and wishing that Rio was there with her to share in her hatred. They’d always enjoyed travelling. Neither were fans of the big landmark attractions, though. They rarely gave you a proper feel of a place. A possible motive for all the vandalism, though Agatha could hardly remember much of her motivation aside from wanting Rio and needing Rio.</p><p>She chuckled when her magic surged as she climaxed in the clip, breaking a telescope clean off its metal stand. The least egregious of their offences she was sure, but the French were most likely labelling it a terrorist attack.</p><p>“I'm keeping the tablet,” she said.</p><p>“There's sensitive—</p><p>“I'm keeping the tablet.”</p><p>“We can remotely wipe all sensitive data, sir,” Captain Rambeau said.</p><p>“Yes, fine. Let’s just get to the real reason we’re here.”</p><p>Simulacrum Rio placed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek and the other one gave Lilia a little squeeze, before Rio merged herself on her throne.</p><p> She stared Fury down until he walked back to the captains. “I've given Monica Rambeau all the information I have on the threat and its army. What more do you want from me?”</p><p>“We've had reports from other sectors,” Captain Marvel said. “Multiple planets have fallen to The First Firmament. Obliterated as though they never existed. Swallowed up by an endless void.”</p><p>“I told you that would happen.”</p><p>“You said you'd protect us.”</p><p>“No, I said I would protect my wife's home.”</p><p>“Aladna is gone. Zenn-la, too.”</p><p>“Okay, <em>Annihilator</em>,” Rio said and Captain Marvel flinched. “Now tell me something I don’t know.”</p><p>“An Oracle from Nornheim told a friend of mine that you were present when the other planets fell…”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“If you couldn't save them,” Fury said. “How will you save your wife’s home?”</p><p>“I wasn't trying to save them. They tried to save themselves, unlike you who insist on making your problems, my problem.”</p><p>“We need your help,” Captain Rambeau said. “I’m not above begging.”</p><p>“My Legion will hold them off. The only way I can help anyone is if The First Firmament shows up. It hasn't yet on any of the planets destroyed or under siege. I was there waiting for it.”</p><p>“I could try to track it down?” Captain Marvel said. “I have allies I could call on to help with the search?”</p><p>“It’s creating Oblivion. Hiding in the growing void. Beyond my sight, beyond anyone’s reach. You may look, but I doubt you'd be successful.”</p><p>“There has to be a way to lure it out,” Captain Rambeau mused.</p><p>“Don’t you have something it wants?” Nick Fury carefully said.</p><p>Rio bristled and then a look of horror crossed her features before it was replaced with complete and utter terror.</p><p>Agatha’s magic sparked to life, so effortlessly she was barely in control of the teleport that placed her in the air above the S.A.B.E.R. agents. In between them and Rio. Her shadowy violet witch’s garb had materialised in a split second, and her purple lashed out around each of their necks, holding them like dogs on leashes.</p><p>The captains lit up like torches in response, powering up.</p><p>Agatha curled her fingers, tightening the strands of magic and chuckled lowly.</p><p>“Oh, I can sparkle too…” She sneered, her robes and hair turning white, glowing blindingly, and if she hadn’t connected with the Darkhold, she was very sure the captains would’ve broken free from her control already.</p><p>It was intoxicating, holding two such powerful beings and Nick Fury in her grasp. To have them at her mercy. To feel her coven surrounding them in a show of support, magic lit up brightly as Agatha had subconsciously opened the connection again.</p><p>She cackled madly then moaned when she felt Rio’s arm circle her waist, slightly behind her in the air, breasts pressed to Agatha’s shoulder. The black shadowy fabric of her cloak fluttered around her and brilliantly contrasted with Agatha’s white and purple.</p><p>“Tell me, my love,” Rio softly said, pulling her close. “Do you really want to kill them, or are you only annoyed at their presence?”</p><p>“I want to kill them for coming here and speaking about things they know nothing about. Demanding things they have no right to demand.”</p><p>“I understand…But it would be less of a headache to simply send them away and go have a nice dinner with your coven. Don’t you think?”</p><p>Agatha had been hoping to go have sex with Rio after she killed them, but she looked to her coven, who even as they stood with their magic ready, worriedly stared at Agatha’s magic wrapped around the throats of the S.A.B.E.R. agents. Wanda’s concern focused entirely on Captain Marvel turning purple. Killing them would attract unwanted attention to the coven if anyone knew they were the last to see the agents alive.</p><p>Agatha deflated even as she glared down at Fury and smoothly cast them out of the Dark Fortress and to the response base.</p><p>Rio turned Agatha in her arms, fingers threading into the hair at the back of her head, and softly kissed her until Agatha’s rage melted away to a more manageable level.</p><p>“Take them through to the guest wing,” Rio murmured. “I’ll come join you later.”</p><p>Agatha cupped her cheek, but Rio took hold of her hand, staring at black fingers before she pressed a lingering kiss to them.</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“I need some time to think.”</p><p>Reluctantly, Agatha nodded, and sighed when Rio vanished from her arms.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Leading the coven through the glass doors of the guest wing, Agatha continued to scowl as she considered going after Nick Fury. Not even showing off her portal casting and inter-dimensional door summoning skills could get her out of the brooding rage she’d fallen into after Rio had left her presence.</p><p>The only thing preventing her from heading to the response base, were the tethers she felt to Scratchy and thankfully Rio, who apparently hadn’t gone too far to ‘think’ and was somewhere there in her realm.</p><p>Still the discontent wouldn’t leave her, gnawing at her stomach, crawling through her chest, making her magic spark sporadically.</p><p>Lilia, who’d quietly fallen into step beside her when they entered the guest wing hallway, placed a hand on Agatha’s back, resting it against the silk of the black robe Agatha still wore. Her magic a calming presence that instantly eased the strain knotting in Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she took in Jen and Wanda up ahead, purposefully focused on an awed Billy who had a million questions streaming out. Billy who very uncharacteristically wasn’t directing any of those questions at her. Alice was glued to Agatha’s other side, stoic and tense with protectiveness. The coven’s magic gently yet purposefully moved through Agatha until the last bit of maddening agitation slowly faded away.</p><p>“It can work both ways if you let it,” Lilia said, gently patted her back, and went to join the others at the bar in the guest wing’s piano lounge.</p><p>Agatha stared at them, unable to form a response. And they knew her well enough to not even look to her for a reaction.</p><p>“I’m going to get some air,” she muttered and stalked through the open floor to ceiling glass doors, onto the massive plant-covered terrace, and lowered onto the comfy corner lounge set. Finally calming fully when she saw the silhouette of Rio in dragon form, flying over the shadowy mountains in the distance.</p><p>She watched Rio soaring through the air for a while, blindly accepting the glass of wine placed in her hand some time later. Sipping silently as Wanda sat beside her, not saying a word.</p><p>The soothing sounds of the coven’s laughter and Alice’s piano playing, had Agatha finally drag her gaze from Rio, deciding to distract herself.</p><p>“So, did Blondie treat you well?” she asked, turning to Wanda and crossed her legs at the knee.</p><p>Wanda snorted, the novelty ashtray of a gold and ruby elephant Agatha had gotten her on their trip to Thailand, appeared on the couch arm. “Yes. Please don’t threaten her about it,” she said, lighting up the joint that appeared between her fingers.</p><p>“You wouldn’t hear about it if I did.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“So is it a casual thing?”</p><p>Wanda took another deep drag and handed her the joint. “It appears so.” She sighed through a cloud of smoke.</p><p>Agatha scowled, thinking through her arsenal of spells, and wondered if Chthon had something special that would really make Captain Marvel reassess her life choices.</p><p>“You were emotionally unavailable, she's physically unavailable,” Wanda tiredly mumbled. “I’m going to join a convent.”</p><p>“You’ll definitely have a lot of options there.” Agatha chuckled. “But what did she say, exactly?”</p><p>“She didn’t need to say anything. She’s a wanderer and I'm more of a stay in Westview type.”</p><p>“Red, I know you want a family. I want that for you too.”</p><p>“Thanks?”</p><p>“But you do realise that you're a very powerful witch, who will most likely live a very long life. Especially if I have anything to say about it.”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>“You have time. You were so young when you lost your family and got drafted into war after war. Loss after loss. Maybe consider taking some time to travel the universe with Captain Dumbass. Platonically or otherwise. I can cast inter-planar portals now, because of how unbelievably powerful I am. Far more powerful than any witch in existence. The most powerful in the entire history of time—</p><p>Agatha laughed when Wanda shoved her and took the joint back.</p><p>“The coven can visit you wherever you are.” She smiled. “Hell, go find out if the Never Queen wants to fuck you or adopt you or whatever that was she’d been implying she wants to do to you.”</p><p>“You only want me to distract her from Rio.”</p><p>“The least you can do for your dearest friend.”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “I'll consider it.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>“Right now, I just need us to survive The First Firmament.”</p><p>“Perfectly understandable. Though, if you do decide you’d rather settle down, there’s always Harold.”</p><p>“Who’s Harold?”</p><p>“Harold our neighbour Harold.”</p><p>“Harold Proctor? Married to Sarah Proctor Harold Proctor?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“He’s married...”</p><p>“I’m very certain I could get Sarah to give him to you if you want him.”</p><p>“You would mind-control her into divorcing her husband?”</p><p>“No need. A year supply of homegrown for her bookclub should do it.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled. “You’re awful. And yet I'm more disturbed that you’d think Harold and I could work.”</p><p>“You multisexual women often have the blandest taste in cishet men. I figured it would be a match made in heaven.”</p><p>Wanda broke out into a fit of giggles that was definitely more weed-induced than anything. “So I'm taking advice from a monosexual bottom into bestiality?” she said, motioning to dragon-Rio majestically soaring through the sky, then burst out laughing again.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “Did you just call me a bottom?”</p><p>“I saw the video clips, and the censored news broadcasts.”</p><p>“Pervert,” she deadpanned and Wanda giggled harder. “Billy!” Agatha called.</p><p>Billy appeared a moment later, grinning and still looking like he was about to burst with excitement at being in a different realm. “Yes?”</p><p>“What's my biggest pet peeve?”</p><p>“Denim on denim,” he instantly said.</p><p>Wanda gasped. “You said I looked hot!”</p><p>“I meant you as a person are hot, despite your unfortunate fashion choice.”</p><p>Billy nodded sagely and Wanda looked unsure whether to be offended or not.</p><p>“What's my biggest pet peeve regarding sex, Billy?”</p><p>“People using the term scissoring.”</p><p>Agatha ran a hand through her hair. She had far too many pet peeves. People really needed to be less annoying. “Second biggest.”</p><p>“People conflating top-bottom with dominant-submissive dynamics.”</p><p>“And why is that?”</p><p>“Because the reckless co-opting of terms meant to establish boundaries and preferences has resulted in awkward, dissatisfying, and dangerous sexual encounters that could've been otherwise fun,” he recited like he was defending a dissertation.</p><p>“And why is it dangerous to casually throw out terms like that?”</p><p>“Because people consume porn that get them off and then try to emulate and enforce it thinking it's normal to choke someone they'd just met without checking if it’s okay.”</p><p>“And how do you protect yourself against a random choking, Billy?”</p><p>“I communicate my wants and desires and expectations openly and without shame. Discussing limits can be the best kind of foreplay.”</p><p>“And what do you do when you're not listened to?”</p><p>“I walk away when they aren't respectful of my wants and my body.”</p><p>“Because?”</p><p>Billy sheepishly ducked his head. “Because I have self-worth.”</p><p>“Good boy, now go refill our drinks, would you?” They handed him their wineglasses. “If you have something yourself, I’ll definitely think it's soda. So don't make it weird for the both of us.”</p><p>He flushed and grinned and hurried away, probably relieved that she hadn’t gotten graphic with her questioning.</p><p>“Well, that conversation certainly took a turn,” Wanda said, carefully watching her.</p><p>She <em>had</em> been bottoming for Rio in those clips and didn’t care who saw it. Agatha had initiated the conversation with the intent of flustering Wanda and Billy, but then she realised she’d opened the door to Wanda leaving, and Billy would also be going in a couple of months…</p><p>“He grew up so fast,” Wanda said. “Yet he's still that little boy who followed you around with stars in his eyes, hanging on your every word.”</p><p>“He's a good youth.”</p><p>Wanda smiled. “Are you worried about him going off to college?”</p><p>“I'm worried that our little twink will attract the wrong attention.”</p><p>“Is that why you have him reciting safe sex rules like the pledge of allegiance?”</p><p>“Gay men are still men.”</p><p>“Women can be dangerous too.”</p><p>“Statistically less so. Though I did kill a witch once who tried to choke me out of nowhere. She was dead before my brain registered she was trying to be sexy.”</p><p>Agatha, in fact, had only enjoyed one woman’s hands around her throat, around her wrists, pinning her face down by the hair as she was roughly pounded into—</p><p>“<em>Agatha,</em>” Wanda hissed, red eyes glowing.</p><p>“Jesus!” Jen yelled from inside. “Calm the fuck down, Agatha! You're gonna make us start humping the furniture!”</p><p>Wanda’s gaze was glued to the exposed skin of Agatha’s thighs, dragging up to where her robe fell open to reveal her chest.</p><p>Agatha smirked, and closed herself off from the coven connection again. Their fault entirely for opening it up in the first place. “Rio said I’ll eventually stabilise, but I’ll probably have a few slip-ups until I’m at full capacity.”</p><p>Wanda's breaths were ragged as her gaze snapped away. “Was this what it was constantly like for you?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “It was a good exercise in control.”</p><p>As her breaths calmed, Wanda’s brows knitted, eyes still red and not looking at Agatha. “Do you feel guilty about that woman you killed accidentally?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Do you think I could kill someone similarly? I've only been with you and Vis and you both could handle me.”</p><p>“The cosmos has just become a lot more accessible, Red. I think there are plenty of people out there who can handle you just the way you like it,” she said with a wink.</p><p>Wanda turned bright red to match her eyes and tried to fight a smile as she purposely looked away from Agatha again.</p><p>“Is that dragon getting closer?” She frowned. “It<em> is</em> Rio, right?”</p><p>“It's her,” Agatha sighed, killing the joint in the ashtray, and freshened up her hands of the stink.</p><p>“She's not slowing down, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and sat back to watch the dragon’s approach.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Wanda put up a shield as Rio rapidly neared them, a gust of wind preceding a cloud of swirling black smoke that settled on the terrace floor and shifted into a black jaguar. Rio’s green eyes glinted as she dipped her head low, teeth bared and glaring at Wanda.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Rio growled over Wanda’s questioning tone, low and threatening, and stalked through Wanda's shield like it didn’t exist. She kept the intense eye contact as she prowled toward the couch and climbed into Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“Oof, okay,” Agatha grunted, adjusting to Rio's weight and wrapped her arms around her giant body to keep her from slipping off.</p><p>“Seriously?” Wanda pouted, and got hissed at, long sharp canines bared, causing Wanda to instinctively jump up and out of reach. “Rio, come on, we could be great friends.”</p><p>Rio growled again, vibrating in Agatha’s arms at which point Billy, who had entered with their wine, spun around and went back inside.</p><p>Wanda looked to Agatha, clearly putting on a show rather than actually being afraid or offended, which good. Agatha hoped she and Rio could one day at least hang out together, but that seemed like still awhile away.</p><p>“Agatha, please tell your wife that your and my relationship has evolved into more of a mother daughter type of thing.”</p><p>Agatha glared at Wanda’s mischievous smirk. “You should eat her, darling,” she said and kissed the side of Rio's furry head.</p><p>Wanda cackled. “Fine, I'll go before she pees all over you to mark her territory.”</p><p>“Don't kink-shame, Wands!” Agatha called after her and had to readjust again when Rio flipped onto her back in Agatha's lap, tail flicking from side-to-side, twinkling emerald eyes staring up at her.</p><p> Agatha cradled her like a human and smiled at how every form Rio took, came out pretty. “If you pee on me, gorgeous, I’ll set you on fire.”</p><p>She got a massive tongue licking the side of her face, from chin to temple.</p><p>Agatha sighed and petted Rio's belly, staring out at the mesmerising full moon, soothed by the tranquil droning of Rio deeply purring in her lap. She stroked up Rio front leg, absently playing with Rio’s gigantic toe beans, digging her fingertips in between the cushioned gaps, making the sharp claws hypnotically extend and retract.</p><p>“You know,” she murmured. “This would be really nice if you weren't going through an emotional crisis right now.”</p><p>Rio nuzzled into her neck, and Agatha rubbed her cheek against soft fur that shifted into silky hair. With a more malleable and lighter Rio to work with, she wrapped her in a hug and quietly held her close. Rio absently playing with the tips of her hair.</p><p>The moon caught Agatha’s eye again, like it was facing her directly. “Rio?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“I know we’re technically inside your body, and I’ll admit that’s kinda hot, but it’s always dark here. I haven’t seen a sun…what is the moon reflecting off? How is it full all the time? Is it a moon at all?”</p><p>Suddenly suspicious of the silver moon staring at her, Agatha shook off her mild high with a quick spell.</p><p>“I made it like that for you.”</p><p>Agatha relaxed. “Of course you made me a moon.”</p><p>“Witches are into moons, I hear.”</p><p>“True,” Agatha murmured. “It's a beautiful moon, darling.”</p><p>Rio hummed and grew quiet again. Agatha continued to stroke her stomach, waiting patiently.</p><p>The view was truly mesmerising. She had always loved the mountains, because being that high up, away from all the smog and light pollution, had offered her the best view of the night sky. Though nothing could ever compare to the view in the Realm of Death.</p><p>“What do you think I should do?” Rio asked in a small voice that made Agatha’s heart constrict.</p><p>“I think you should stay here with me and the Twins until they’re adults and can protect themselves. Fury and Earth can fuck right off. Ungrateful asshole.”</p><p>Rio looked up and smiled, leaned closer then licked the other side of Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha sighed exasperatedly and drew her into a kiss Rio easily fell into. She tugged at Rio’s body until she was straddling her lap, and then rose to her feet with Rio clinging to her front like a koala. Legs around her waist and arms around her neck.</p><p>She carefully walked them inside, navigating with a face half covered by Rio’s hair, distracted by Rio’s fingers massaging her scalp. By some miracle, she managed to make it to the bar without tripping over or bumping into anything.</p><p>Her hold remained firm and secure on Rio, who needed to be held tightly and suffocatingly when she was upset. Only grateful that Rio was allowing her to offer comfort.</p><p>Agatha adjusted her grip using magic to aid her and poured a glass of ice cold apple juice into a tumbler glass, before making her way to the nearest armchair she spotted passed Rio’s head. She then lowered Rio down into it and climbed sideways into her lap. Pressing the glass into her hand.</p><p>Rio had shifted a knee up for Agatha to lean back against, spreading her legs so Agatha was comfily situated in the cradle of her thighs, an arm slung around Rio’s shoulders and studying her face as Rio downed half of the apple juice, absently stroking Agatha’s legs.</p><p>“Darling?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“What are the Twins, specifically, in terms of their roles in the greater cosmos? I know they’re cosmic entities, but why does everything end when they do? Can’t you just not let them be that?”</p><p>“Oh. Well, Eternity was created to be the sum of all life that exists. He’s become the embodiment of the Multiverse. Without him, it collapses.”</p><p>“I see.” The First Firmament’s threat toward Eternity finally made sense since it professed to despise the Multiverse.</p><p>“Infinity is the embodiment of time, space, matter, energy, reality, and magic. Without her, nothing life-sustaining can exist. As aspects they share a common purpose. Unable to survive without the other, the cosmos unable to exist without them. I act as their counterpart.”</p><p>“To bring balance,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Yes.” Rio drained her glass and vanished it from her hand. She licked her lips and looked at her fingers stroking Agatha’s legs. “I don't want them to think that I wouldn't fight for them.”</p><p>“They won’t think that because it’s untrue.”</p><p>“Then tell me what to do.”</p><p>“I think you've decided already, or you wouldn't be entertaining it. And for what it's worth, despite hating the idea, I think you're making the best decision for them. Eliminating The First Firmament now will allow you to focus on your family."</p><p>Rio pressed a kiss to Agatha’s throat.</p><p>“Now, tell me your plan so I can pick it apart.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and bit her neck, making Agatha chuckle.</p><p>“It will take millions of years for The First Firmament to destroy the cosmos,” Rio said, leaning back in her seat. “It spreads itself thin as it targets candidates to fill The Living Tribunal. For it to be successful before the Twins grow into entities that can defeat it, it will need to eliminate them while they’re weak.”</p><p>“So it will be desperate to get to them now.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “To lure it out of Oblivion, the Twins will need to be without me. It doesn't know that I have the Edge of Reality. Only that I have ways to shield them and hide them.”</p><p>“Why would it think you would ever leave them? Wouldn’t that be too obvious a trap?”</p><p>“I've been speaking to Never—</p><p>Agatha twisted her fingers in Rio's hair tugging her chin up, causing Rio to moan, her eyes glazing over.</p><p>“Rio...” she lowly gritted out. “Did you fuck her?”</p><p>Rio's smirked lazily, eyes hooded. “No.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>“I’ve only been with one insufferable witch my entire existence,” Rio said, stroking her inner thigh when Agatha’s grip eased and guilt gripped her heart. “Never is one of your closest friends.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “She certainly wasn’t acting like it.”</p><p>“I can’t say why you insist on having such antagonistic relationships with your friends.”</p><p>A chorus of snorts and chuckles had Agatha’s head whip around to where the coven sat lounging with drinks in hand staring at her in amusement.</p><p>Jen lifted a brow. “So did you guys forget we're here, or do you just not care?”</p><p>“She forgot,” Rio said. “I don't care.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at all of them fighting a smile.</p><p>“Never has offered to lend her army and launch an offensive,” Rio continued. “If it believes we're making our move and that’s why I left the Twins and took the majority of my Legion with me, it won't think twice to come to Earth. It’s pompous enough to be angry that it appears I underestimated its strength and desperate enough to try even if it means losing some of its strength in the process. It has grown a lot more powerful this past week and that could give it the confidence to try and break through my shields and wards again.”</p><p> “So let’s say it falls for this obvious trap,” Agatha said. “You come to surprise it. What’s stopping it from running away again? What do we do then?”</p><p>“If it runs, I'll chase it until it disappears into Oblivion. And I'll find another way to lure it out. I may not be able to kill it for a few centuries.”</p><p>“Comforting,” Alice mumbled.</p><p>“It works.” Everyone froze when Lilia spoke. “I saw The First Firmament in the air above the forest outside the fortress. I’m not sure when it will appear, but it does show up here at some point.”</p><p>“Great,” Jen muttered.</p><p>They all fell silent. Most likely lost in the memory of what had happened at the Marketplace. They would be prepared this time, though.</p><p>“Why didn’t you protect Agatha before?” Wanda asked, frowning at Rio. “Why did you let her die each time? Why are you only stopping it now?”</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha scolded. She knew Wanda was genuinely confused, but Rio had gone entirely still, and Agatha cupped her cheek. “Darling, she didn’t—</p><p>“We stopped many similar threats from occurring,” Rio said in a dead voice and Agatha’s hand slipped away from Rio’s suddenly cold skin. “On our own. Together. With help. We always tried to prevent her death.”</p><p>“Rio, I didn’t mean—</p><p>“But there were times where we didn't know that anything was coming. Where it was too late to stop what had already been set in motion. Twice it was a catastrophic cataclysmic accident due to a series of convoluted events not even Never could foresee.”</p><p>Agatha took her hand. “Darling—</p><p>“No mortal can survive the destruction that follows the death of the Twins. The void that sweeps across the cosmos. Even here it permeates through my wards, invades our home, and steals the life right from it. It takes the only life from it...”</p><p>Agatha squeezed the hand limply held in her own, helplessly staring into the vacant flickering of Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“She’s powerful.” Rio swallowed thickly. “But she’s still mortal. Her life linked to Eternity. Her magic to Infinity. All her power can do then is grant us time. Just enough to come home and for me to promise to find her again.”</p><p>A single tear slipped down Rio’s cheek and Agatha wanted to wipe it away, but her hand trembled in Rio’s, who was still entirely focused on a guilty-looking Wanda.</p><p>“We come home so I can hold her as she fades, because it’s the only thing I can do. Powerless and impotent. Selfishly bound to my duty. And I watch as our bond fades from her wrists. I listen to her last breath as it leaves her body. And I feel the exact moment her heart stops because mine does too. Remaining dormant until her soul is reborn.”</p><p>Chest tight and aching, Agatha pressed a kiss Rio’s temple, whose eyes fell shut as she leaned into the gentle pressure.</p><p>She’d very wrongly assumed that Rio had accepted Nicky’s death easier because of her job. That Rio wouldn’t mourn as intensely because of who she was. But it seemed to have been worse because of who she was. After losing Chthon so many times, Nicky might have been the straw that broke the camel's back. Because at least with Chthon, there was the hope of a reunion. Even with the Twins, Rio always got some part of them back. Nicky was lost to her forever…</p><p>Rio inhaled a shuddering breath, picked Agatha up as she stood, then deposited her back on the chair. “I need to leave,” she softly said. “You're all welcome to stay.”</p><p>Agatha jumped up after her.  “Let me walk you out,” she said to prevent Rio from teleporting away.</p><p><em>‘Agatha,’</em> Wanda's voice cracked.</p><p><em>‘I know,</em>’ Agatha replied as she hurried to keep up with Rio’s strides.</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair, watching the glass doors grow nearer.</p><p>They walked into the Gothic style entry hall, where Rio's bedroom doors appeared.</p><p>Certain that Rio didn't actually need to leave the guest wing to conjure them, Agatha straightened her spine. “I would like to stay with you,” she said. “If that’s okay?”</p><p>Rio instantly wrapped her in a hug, sagging in relief in Agatha’s arms.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Agatha was led into the bedroom, delighted to discover the Twins’ cribs had been set up near the window. Beside them, Bartol sat in his rocking chair with Scratchy in his lap, gently petting him.</p><p>Agatha smiled at the scene, at the Twins drowsily sitting up and babbling when Rio stepped into view, affectionately running her hand across Bartol’s skull. “Thanks, Bartie.”</p><p>“A pleasure, mistress.”</p><p>As he rose to leave, Scratch abruptly appeared in Agatha's arms and she placed a kiss on his head before he disappeared again in cloud of shadowy purple after Bartol.</p><p>“Well goodbye to you too, then,” she muttered.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “He’s just happy to be home. He and Bartie are best friends. They miss each other more than they care to admit.”</p><p>Agatha would have asked more about that relationship, but Infinity’s sleepy eyes were staring up at her and she wasn't sure how familiar to act with Rio's children.</p><p>“You and Infinity have always been close in all her iterations,” Rio said, picking up Eternity. “The only reason she wasn’t at our wedding was because like my creator, she can’t be trusted to not tell you everything.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and reached down to lift Infinity into her arms and nearly cried when Infinity gave a gummy smile before sluggishly falling against her.</p><p>“They've been bathed and fed,” Rio murmured, soothingly rubbing Eternity’s back, who kept jerking himself awake despite how clearly tired he was.</p><p>Agatha nodded and lowered into the rocking chair, fighting down all the emotions threatening to have her magic burst out of her.</p><p>“Do you ever wonder why they're in these forms?” Rio softly asked, suspiciously facing away from Agatha.</p><p>“I assumed it was the form you were in when you created them.”</p><p>“It wasn't,” Rio rasped. “They sleep like human babies do even when they don't need to. They appear to get hungry and need to be changed…”</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“It doesn't matter.”</p><p>“It feels like it does to you.”</p><p>“They're perfect. No need to question what I was thinking. Right?”</p><p>“The way your mind works, I'm certain you're able to recall exactly what you were thinking.”</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>Agatha brushed her cheek to Infinity hair, brows knitted as she wondered what was bothering Rio. “What were you thinking when you created them?”</p><p>Rio exhaled, protectively cupping the back of Eternity’s head. “I was thinking not again. Not yet. I can't do this again.” Agatha’s chest tightened painfully. “I was thinking about you and Nicky.” Rio’s shoulders hunched. “I know I wanted to save you, but do you think I wanted to replace him?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said instantly and decisively, causing Rio to turn and hesitantly look at her. “I think loving Nicky may have lead to their creation in these particular forms. But I'm very sure they're not a replacement. And I'm always right. So please, there’s no need for you to worry about that too.”</p><p>Rio smiled tenderly, and Agatha smiled back, relaxing into the rocking chair. She instinctively began humming a familiar lullaby that took them all the way back to 1750. Rio’s smile grew bittersweet and her eyes fell shut as she cradled Eternity to her shoulder, softly swaying to Agatha’s melody.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha sat behind the desk in Chthon’s study, entirely absorbed in the contents of the Darkhold. Each new page was a wondrous discovery leading to another and another… The current page contained a spell that would connect her to all copies of the Darkhold in circulation throughout the cosmos. She would be able to cast the Dreamwalk spell and enter the holder’s mind. Take on any form she wished in their imaginations to influence them while she siphoned their power.</p><p>Chthon was an evil genius.</p><p>“So you're really going to spend our last few hours together before I go off to war, with the Darkhold.”</p><p>Startled, Agatha looked up to find Rio reclining on a giant black bean bag, Scratchy stretched out across her chest like a furry seatbelt. Both looked settled and comfortable, and Agatha had no idea how long Rio had been there.</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed, gaze snapping to Scratchy. <em>“Me cago en tus muertos,</em>” she hissed, grabbed him by the scruff and lifted him to glare daggers into his eyes. “She does <em>not</em> love you more than me!” she said and tossed him across the room, his delighted cackling filling Agatha’s head before he disappeared in a puff of shadowy purple smoke.</p><p>Agatha looked down at the Darkhold, still feeling like Scratchy, and frowned at the strangeness caused by his projections appearing as separate entities.</p><p>Deciding to not overthink it, she shifted her gaze to a pouting Rio and smirked. “You're going off to war, now?”</p><p>“Yes. I'm so brave and courageous and you don't even care.”</p><p>“I thought you were going off to fake a war?”</p><p>“The First Firmament needs to believe it’s real. So I’m going to make it real.”</p><p>“Rio—</p><p>“I can’t die remember? It’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. She kept on forgetting that and nodded, eyes going back to the Darkhold, thinking about the page she’d discovered that morning. Thinking about how little she knew about anything. How Rio might not be able to die, but her love for her family made her vulnerable. She could still be hurt…</p><p>“How does Scratchy survive the destruction of the cosmos each time?” Agatha asked to stop that train of thought. “I thought the void swallowed everything?”</p><p>“Demon dimensions remain unaffected as they’re not the creations of The One Above All, existing on entirely different planes.”</p><p>“Then who created them and their planes of existence?”</p><p>“The One Below All.”</p><p>Agatha lifted a brow. “A relative of yours?”</p><p>“Ask my creator if you need to know now, or wait for your memories to return. It's their story to tell.”</p><p>Agatha nodded thoughtfully. “I take it demon dimensions aren’t conducive to mortal living?”</p><p>“Depending on the demon dimension, you might be able to visit briefly, but no, it’s not very survivable or easily accessible to mortals.”</p><p>“Hmm. According to the Darkhold, I can <em>summon</em> demons…and werewolves, vampires, zombies,” she began listing off, “harpies, goblins, whatever troids and nightgaunts are…”</p><p>“I know. I've seen you do it. You once invaded an entire planet with your demon army and made the inhabitants worship you for millennia.”</p><p>“Really? Why, though?” Agatha loved attention, sure, but subjugation for no reason wasn’t her style. Much too tacky to just be flippantly flaunting power around like that without challenge.</p><p>“We vacationed there and one of their leaders grabbed my ass.”</p><p>“So I invaded an entire planet?”</p><p>Rio nodded like that was normal.</p><p>“I thought you said I was more relaxed with my memories.”</p><p>“Oh, you were pretty relaxed about it.”</p><p>Agatha had done some mass murder in defence of Rio's honour before. It wasn't that far-fetched that she would become possessive enough to consider invading an entire planet. Actually doing it though had her worried whether she ever learned control over her power…</p><p>“If it makes you feel any better,” Rio said. “The guy was a sorcerer. And you've always hated sorcerers.”</p><p>Agatha nodded sagely. She<em> really</em> hated sorcerers.</p><p>“And he’d been antagonising you for a while. You felt he’d overstepped dragging me into your dick measuring contest.”</p><p>“You don't have to sell me on it. I was just wondering about my control over the situation. I'm sure Chthon's plan was formed the second he touched you.”</p><p>“You were very much in control…” Rio hummed, looking lost in a lascivious memory.</p><p>“So…”Agatha said, drawing those dark eyes back to her.</p><p>Rio huffed and shook her head. “You won't be able to control your demon army right now.”</p><p>“I could—</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and decided to fall back on her initial plan. She’d already found the perfect spell, she just needed a little more information.</p><p>“How much does The First Firmament know about witchcraft?”</p><p>“I can't say. It looks down on mortals, so I can't imagine it bothered to study the intricacies of witchcraft. It barely tried that hard to break through the shield I placed on the Twins before it opted for threats and intimidation instead.”</p><p>“Can it sense magic?”</p><p>“Not in the way you can, but I think it can recognise it.”</p><p>“It didn't seem to be aware of the shield you were casting over the Marketplace.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Only seeing it after the casting completed.”</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>“What are you thinking?”</p><p>“Just curious.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a long moment making Agatha squirm in her seat as she pretended to read the Darkhold page she’d already memorised.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I need you to make me a promise.”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>“Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to siphon The First Fucking Firmament. It will kill you.”</p><p>“You said I could handle—</p><p>“You could handle some of my power. The minuscule fraction I share with you because it makes you feel good. It will use your attempt to take control of you. And once it has you, there's no fixing that. Your soul will be destroyed. No more reincarnation. No Spirit Realm. Nothing. Okay?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Promise.”</p><p>“Fine. Ugh. I promise I won't siphon The First Fucking Firmament. Happy?”</p><p>“Not really no.”</p><p>“What did I do now?”</p><p>“I don't like this train of thought.”</p><p>“What train of thought?”</p><p>Rio’s knife appeared between her fingers. Fidgeting, she averted her gaze, and Agatha’s chest tightened.</p><p>“The only reason I’m even attempting this stupid plan, Agatha, is because I know you’ll be here with Eternity and Infinity. That you’ll protect them. That if anything goes wrong, you’ll portal them home where it’s safe. That it will be your priority. Right?”</p><p>Agatha softened, closed the Darkhold and appeared in Rio’s lap who grasped Agatha’s hips, knife gone, and earnestly stared up into her eyes.</p><p>“If it looks like we’re cutting it too close,” Agatha said. “I’ll bring them here and we’ll wait for you. The First Firmament won’t find it strange that they’ve been left in my care?”</p><p>“It knows who you are to me.”</p><p>Agatha smiled too widely and Rio ducked her head, grinning to herself.</p><p>“If the Twins are safe here…” Agatha carefully asked, brushing a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear, letting her fingers trail down Rio’s jaw to settle beneath her chin, tilting is up so Rio would look at her again. “Why didn’t they come here before?”</p><p>“Our realms are us. My brother and sister had their own realms…My children are currently tethered to me, to the core of my being. To the heart of my realm.”</p><p>Agatha had missed seeing the contrast of her fingers against Rio’s skin. And reluctantly removed her hand, sitting back in Rio’s lap to ponder this new information. “Is it a physical thing? The heart of your realm?”</p><p>“The pyramid. It’s at its centre.”</p><p>“What’s inside of it?”</p><p>“Something precious to me.”</p><p>“Will you show me?”</p><p>“When I come back, I’ll take you there.”</p><p>Agatha remembered staring at the pyramid from Rio’s bedroom window. Shiny and black and prominent in the landscape. “And it’s indestructible too, right? Because you are?”</p><p>“Yes. Most entities prefer to carry their cores with them, to keep them safe rather than leaving them unattended. The Twins will no doubt have their own realms in future, create their own vessels to store their life force, but for now they share my heart and while they remain vulnerable everywhere else in the cosmos, <em>here</em> they’ll be safe. Which was why I wanted to wait it out.”</p><p>“Does The First Firmament have its heart with it?”</p><p>“It has no heart, as it has no realm. It’s a manifestation of a past that’s no longer feasible, born from the spite and hatred of all the entities once trapped in the Far Shore.”</p><p>“How do you kill it then?”</p><p>“I’m going to slice it up.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Just like that?”</p><p>“Taking it down will be easy. It ran from me even at the Marketplace, before I had a weapon that could permanently destroy its essence.”</p><p>“Confident, aren’t you?</p><p>Rio smirked. “A couple of minutes is all I need.”</p><p>“Minutes?”</p><p>“Yes. I’ll put on a little show for you and then you can finally take me out on that surprise date.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Are you trying to be sexy right now?”</p><p>“Only stating facts, sweetheart,” Rio said, drawing teasing circles across Agatha’s hipbones.</p><p>“Seriously, Rio,” she rasped, leaning closer, bracing her hands on either side of Rio’s head. “This is a very simple plan for a very intense problem.”</p><p>“I've told you, I've got it handled.” Rio caressed up her waist, clever fingers making Agatha grow warm all over. “You're the one doing the dangerous part, playing bait.”</p><p>“You’ll eliminate a cosmic threat in only a few minutes?” Agatha murmured, eyelids fluttering.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said, tongue in cheek as she heatedly stared at Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Agatha sighed when Rio cupped her breasts, arching into the touch. “Because you're so very strong and powerful?”</p><p>Dark eyes gleamed, as a cocky smirk spread over Rio’s stupidly attractive face. “You've only seen a drop in the ocean of my power.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha muttered and crashed their mouths together.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>She knew it was coming, and still Agatha wasn’t prepared to say goodbye to Rio. Not after things were just starting to settle between them. To feel <em>right </em>again…</p><p>They stood out in the courtyard at the Dark Fortress where Rio planned to vanish from Earth taking some of the shield’s power with her. She would then wait for Agatha to call for her using her Ouroboros should The First Firmament show up. A simple plan, resting solely on the theory that The First Firmament would be desperate enough to get to the Twins before they grew stronger and before Rio got to it. Too much was being put on Lilia’s vision, but Agatha decided to be quiet for once about that. Rio was stressed enough about leaving.</p><p>Holding the Twins in her arms, the coven at her back in silent support, Agatha watched with a painfully twisting heart as Rio softly murmured sweet goodbyes to her children before looking at Agatha.</p><p>“Bartol is like my familiar in a sense. He protects our home and he’ll protect the Twins and stand with you against any threat.”</p><p>Agatha glanced over at Bartol leaned against a wall, smoking a cigar whilst wearing a fedora. The smoke visibly travelled down into his rib cage before being exhaled through his jaw and mouth.</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>Rio grinned. “He’s got your back. I promise.”</p><p>“I believe you. He just clashes with my aesthetic. He’s going to need to fight separately in case people are recording or taking pictures.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’ll let him know.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>They stared at each other until Rio sucked in a breath, jaw twitching, and looked to the Twins again.</p><p>“You be good for your ma—for Agatha,” she said, cheeks flushed a deep crimson as she kissed the Twins on their heads.</p><p>Agatha’s chest grew warm and tight when Rio hesitantly looked to her after the almost slip.</p><p>“I want you to know,” Agatha rasped. “That I want to be your wife again. And when I’ve regained your trust, I’ll be so happy to raise the Twins with you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes shot full of tears, and she smiled tremulously.</p><p>“We’ll take our time, okay?” Agatha thickly said. “Nothing needs to be decided now.”</p><p>Rio nodded shakily, looking both apprehensive and hopeful.</p><p>Agatha adjusted the Twins, needing to touch Rio but her hands were full and she refused to hand them over to anyone else. “I can’t speak on a past I don’t remember, Rio. But the me I am now, is very certain that I have and will love you in every life.”</p><p>Rio’s breath visibly caught, gaze flickering across Agatha’s face. “The first time I saw you was in the mist, standing beside a burning pyre. You’d been cursing me for decades after the loss of family, friends, mentors, and lovers. Before, you’d masked your grief with anger. This time, though, was different.”</p><p>Agatha held the Twins closer.</p><p>“I don’t know why, but I left my realm and went to you. And heard you whisper a soft prayer, asking me to protect your little brother. To make sure he wouldn’t be scared when I collected him. You’d found him as orphaned and alone as you were. Raised him and loved him, and when he was taken too, I could almost feel your heart shatter. The grief of so many consuming you at once.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her nose to Eternity’s hair and breathed him in, trying to not get swept up. The story felt familiar. Not only because it made her think of Nicky, but it felt like a truth she knew somewhere deep in her soul.</p><p>“And for the first time in all existence, Death took a mortal by his little hand and guided him to the Spirit Realm to make sure he wouldn’t be scared. Projecting only a shadow that evoked instant trust and acceptance. He used that time to make me promise to protect his big sister and make sure she was happy.”</p><p>Agatha sniffed, trying to ignore Infinity’s questioning gaze and Eternity touching her neck to get her attention, understanding now why Rio needed them to be in a good place once she remembered again.</p><p>“He made me swear an oath to you.” Rio smirked fondly. “I easily agreed, thinking I was only placating him. But instead of leaving after I guided him to my creator, I returned to your side at the pyre. I watched you sit beside coal and ash for two days. Exhaustion and hunger taking you…I didn’t understand immediately what was happening…”</p><p>Agatha nodded, eyes burning. Remembering those nights after Nicky and Rio were gone, being too tired to be angry, how close she’d been to giving up entirely. Too ashamed to follow through because it would’ve meant seeing them again after everything she’d done...</p><p>“I still don’t know what made me show myself to you then. Incorporeal, omniscient and omnipresent, everything you despised about me. Using an unused voice to speak your language into your mind, mercilessly taunting you about your failure to hex me.”</p><p>Agatha snorted wetly as Rio chuckled.</p><p>“But it got you to rise from the dirt. Your hair was…<em>crazy</em>. Wild like a lion’s mane. And I felt a reciprocal spark within me as I watched pure rage and indignation light up your eyes. You stole a breath I didn’t have or need and when your body erupted with beautiful purple magic, everything changed…I changed.</p><p>I haunted you. Feeling reckless and free at the novelty and not understanding what was happening or why I couldn’t stop myself. I became an unwitting companion on your journey for vengeance. And during that time, I grew to want, to crave, to desire your time and attention.”</p><p>“So obsessed with me,” Agatha croaked and Rio smiled, tilting her head, tenderly gazing at her.</p><p>“I had no physical form, but I took shape to feel your eyes on me…Your hands on me…Your lips on me…”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“I had no mortal heart, but one grew in my chest to love only you, and to be loved by only you.”</p><p>“Darling…”</p><p>“I had no home, but I built one with you in the place where I was born, where my very being is tethered.”</p><p>Tears rolled down Agatha’s face, mirroring Rio’s own even through her smile.</p><p>“I had no idea what wonders the cosmos held, until you took my hand and allowed me to experience them with you. Who I am exists in response to your existence. And there is nothing I want more than for my children to have you in their lives and know what an extraordinary thing it is, to be loved by you.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders shook with silent sobs, the Twins staring at her, and she wanted to reassure them, but her chest ached and she didn’t want Rio to leave, but knew she couldn’t ask her to stay.</p><p>Rio leaned in to place the softest kiss on Agatha’s salty lips before resting their foreheads together, her eyes squeezed shut. She ran her hands over the Twins’s heads, down their backs and lightly grasped Agatha’s wrists, thumbs brushing over her Ouroboros, a silent reminder that she was only a thought away. The concept of their bond was so foreign to The First Firmament, Rio was certain it didn’t know that a mere mortal could summon a cosmic entity to her side within seconds.</p><p>“Te veo, my loves,” Rio whispered.</p><p>With the awareness that came with Chthon’s power, Agatha didn’t only watch her vanish from sight, but could feel Rio leave the plane entirely. An emptiness settling in her chest in her absence.</p><p>The Twins started wailing and the lump in Agatha’s throat grew larger when she remembered they could feel Rio leaving too.</p><p>Agatha held them closer, pressing her face to their hair. “Mommy’s coming back, babies,” she croaked, a sob painfully catching in her chest. “She’ll come back to us.”</p><p>The words failed to pacify any of them and Agatha turned as she rocked the Twins, tears streaming down all three their faces, and froze when she saw the coven there. Not a dry eye among them as they moved as one and wrapped her and the Twins in their arms.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Agatha was going to not do anything regarding The First Firmament, but then Rio had gone and said all those things. And now she had to go and be someone worthy of such declarations. So really, it was Rio's fault when her initial plan was back on track.</p><p>Rio had moved a replica of the guest wing to the Dark Fortress. The Twins would need to remain discoverable and the Fortress was still fortified by a small contingent of Undead and the shield surrounding them, so she could only hope it was an enticing enough trap for The First Firmament to risk showing up for. No doubt Rio was giving it hell wherever she was in the cosmos in order to make it more desperate.</p><p>Agatha spent her time studying the Darkhold in the replica of her study while the Twins napped nearby. And when they were awake, she spent time with them and the coven. Both she and the Twins miserable and missing Rio, but doing their best.</p><p>For nearly six long horrible weeks she fell into that pattern, and then the shadowy portals finally appeared outside of Westview, on a random Tuesday afternoon. She’d felt the change in the air even before Bartol came to inform her where the coven was gathered in the piano lounge watching Love Island on a giant flat screen TV.</p><p>Everyone awkwardly rose from their seats, tension thick in the air as they stared at Bartol after the announcement. Or maybe it was because he was wearing a black tricorn hat and a glowing green scimitar sheathed at his hip.</p><p> “Shall I gather Mistress’s Legion and ready our defence?” Bartol suggested into the silence.</p><p>“Oh, uhm. Yeah, you should do that.” Rio’s plan didn’t involve much for her to do. Agatha only needed to call her when The First Firmament showed up. She cleared her throat. “Well…be safe.”</p><p>“You too, my lady.”</p><p>“Wait, Bartol. Bart. What would you and I usually do, in a situation like this?”</p><p>“You would kiss me on the head and tell me to destroy our enemies.”</p><p>“And the my lady thing, we do that too?”</p><p>“You have had many names, but you have always been my lady.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and looked back at the tense coven. Billy was there, and annoyingly Mrs. Hart too. She then lifted Bartol’s hat, bent down, and pressed a kiss to his skull, before placing the hat back on.</p><p>“Have fun destroying our enemies,” she said with a smile.</p><p>“With pleasure, my lady,” he said, did an about turn that rattled his bones, and marched off.</p><p>Agatha watched him until he vanished into thin air, then turned to Wanda as the others left to make their own preparations. She unfastened the necklace from around her neck, swallowing thickly when she handed the locket to an apprehensive Wanda.</p><p>“You couldn’t place the portal spell into anything else?” Wanda muttered.</p><p>“If something happens to me, I need Rio to have that.”</p><p>“I’m very sure she’ll kill me before I even get the chance to give it to her. ”</p><p>“She won’t, because you kept her children safe when I couldn’t.”</p><p>“I want to kill you for asking me to do this.”</p><p>“This is only a precaution. I don’t intend to die. The risks are minimal to me. But if I do need to die, I want to do so knowing you’ll take them home and wait for Rio there.”</p><p>“Agatha, Rio scrubbed your sex montage from the minds of everyone in the world. Only <em>I</em> remember it. Vividly. I have dreams about it. Of her making intense eye contact with me while she has sex with you. It’s really hot, though I doubt that’s what she intended—</p><p>Agatha smirked and Wanda rolled her eyes.</p><p>—<em>regardless,</em> Rio hates me. And she's going to kill me out of grief and anger that I didn't stop you.”</p><p>“Stop me from what? This is only a fail-safe. I need to know if anything goes wrong the Twins have you to take them home. Please…”</p><p>Wanda hesitated.</p><p>“Wanda, I need you to tell me that whatever happens, your first priority will be keeping those babies safe for me, okay?”</p><p>Wanda sighed, but Agatha knew the answer would have been yes even if they’d been a stranger’s normal children in need of protection. “I promise I’ll protect them.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p>After Wanda left for her own preparations, Agatha went to collect the Twins, feeling remarkably calm. She’d prepared. Had been preparing every second she wasn’t tending to the Twins. Agatha had treasured every second she could spend with them. The coven too were entirely enamoured, and had helped with babysitting, but more often than not, the quickest way to pacify the Twins, was letting them play with Scratchy. Achingly, he’d had the same soothing effect on Nicky as well.</p><p>Every part of Agatha wanted to cast a portal and go hide them far away in the Realm of Death. She hated that the plan’s success rested solely on placing them in danger.</p><p>She entered the large terrace of the guest wing, up high in the Fortress overlooking the forest where Lilia had pointed to having seen The First Firmament in her vision. Flying Undead were already engaged in battle with the shadow wraiths outside the shield. And down below, Bartol sat atop a phantom steed. He raised his glowing green sword and multiple ramps appeared over the ravine. Rio’s Legion filed across and charged at the creatures skittering their way toward the Dark Fortress.</p><p>Agatha licked her lips, and tried to shake the disturbing sight outside their bubble from her mind.</p><p>Walking to the corner lounge set, she laid down the plush pink blanket Jen had gotten the Twins, settling them on top of it, along with their favourite toys. She then summoned Scratchy and he instantly got their attention. Agatha smiled when he relaxed his furry body and embraced the curious onslaught from tiny hands and mouths.</p><p>Satisfied that they were preoccupied, she activated the protection wards around them, covered them in another shield, and summoned the Darkhold to hover in the air beside her before donning her shadowy purple witch’s costume, feeling her spine straighten and her chin lift mechanically as her power pleasantly thrummed inside of her.</p><p>A dull thudding noise drew her attention upward, where multiple wraiths were throwing themselves at the shield. Splotches of black stained the magical barrier before evaporating into nothingness.</p><p>Agatha sighed, trying not to look at how the Legion was faring. They were Undead. They would be fine. Bart would be fine. All they had to do was look as though they were putting up a desperate defence to prevent the capture of the Twins.</p><p>The coven arrived on the terrace, and Agatha gasped, stilling at the look of them, the Darkhold floating in the air beside her in a vibrant purple glow.</p><p>“Do you like them?” Alice awkwardly mumbled, self-consciously brushing her fingers over her flaming orange witch’s garments off-set by pretty shadowy inlays.</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly, tears stinging her eyes and affectionately took all of them in, dressed up in costumes that matched their magic, that matched <em>her</em>. “Yes,” she breathed. “You all look great.”</p><p>Jen sent her a lopsided grin. “Figured that if we’re going to die, we’ll die looking like witches.”</p><p>“I’m not letting any of you die,” Agatha said, a little too intensely, and cleared her throat when they softly stared at her. She abruptly turned to the Darkhold page containing the ritual spell instead. “We’ll start when The First Firmament arrives, until then, feel free to enjoy the show.” She blindly motioned to where Bartol and the Legion battalion were decimating the shadows that kept pouring out of portals.</p><p>Billy in his blue robes skulked over. “This is really important, Agatha…”</p><p>“I’m aware.”</p><p>“Are you sure I should be a part if it? I'm not—what if it doesn’t work because—</p><p>Agatha grasped his chin with black fingers. “You are a part of this coven. <em>My</em> coven. I need all of you to anchor me, because we are bound together. This will literally not work without you. So if you don't want to do it, tell me now so I can come up with a different plan.”</p><p>His eyes darted toward Mrs. Hart in her green frilly witch’s garb. The same scepticism Agatha had watched him suppress for weeks seeming to pour out now when they were on the brink of annihilation. “You know I’ll follow you anywhere, Agatha, but is <em>she</em> bound to the coven?”</p><p>Agatha released his chin and straightened, Billy impulsively mimicking her posture. “What’s the Covenstead rule, Billy?”</p><p>“Wherever you are, a coven there shall be,” he dutifully recited. “Within a three mile radius there’ll be witchy-enough people who when together, can bring about a magical spark. Agatha, you can’t seriously—</p><p>“I needed a green witch to ground the elementals,” she motioned to Jen, Lilia, and Alice. “And since I couldn’t leave here to recruit, <em>she</em> popped up out of proximity. Thanks to Wanda’s mommy issues, she was at least somewhat linked to the coven already. Unlike you though, she knows nothing, but we’re going to make it work. Okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, we will. So…” He looked down at his hands, no glow yet as Agatha was  keeping her emotions firmly locked up. “What kind of magic do I have?”</p><p>“Dark.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Disappointed?”</p><p>“No.” He smiled. “Just surprised. Should I be worried? I know it can be consuming…”</p><p>“No need. It will only manifest when we’re all together, and when we’re all together, you have nothing to worry about. Right?”</p><p>He nodded, shoulders loosening but worriedly glanced at Mrs. Hart again, who was animatedly yapping at Wanda.</p><p>“Personally,” Agatha said, drawing his attention. “I would’ve preferred your mom seeing me in all my magical glory.”</p><p>Billy scoffed and Agatha smirked, glancing over at Mrs. Hart too who was grinning like a psychopath.</p><p>“Hart!” The squirrely woman jumped in the air, and Wanda sent Agatha a warning look she promptly ignored. “<em>Don't</em> let me down.”</p><p>“It’s <em>Sharon,</em>” she said through a grin. “And I won't.”</p><p>“Did you memorise the chant?”</p><p>“Yes! It was so much fun.”</p><p>Agatha's eyes narrowed. “If you mess this up, I’ll rip your throat out.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Wanda said, stepping in front of Mrs. Hart. “She won't mess up.”</p><p>“What's your job, Hart?”</p><p>Mrs. Hart peeked out from behind Wanda, still grinning. “Stand on my spot. Chant in harmony. I was in the choir—</p><p>“I need you to lock in, Hart. Are you locked in?”</p><p>“I’m locked in!” she said, her fists clenched in excitement.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She would hold her in place with magic if it came to that. Move her mouth and vocal chords if need be. Breaking the circle was out of the question.</p><p>“I'll make sure she does what she needs to,” Wanda said. “You focus on the hard part, okay?”</p><p>Agatha was too tense to feel gratitude, so only nodded stiffly, because out over the forest, the sky tore apart, revealing a shadowy abyss from which a dark familiar figure emerged like it was climbing out of a sleeping bag. It was a couple of miles away, yet the air grew thick and oppressive. Its presence stilling everything around them.</p><p>They’d tipped off S.A.B.E.R. that they were laying a trap, so they could get ready to evacuate the area, a warning they apparently took to ready their weapons. Several missiles whistled through the air, The First Firmament standing nearly a mile tall as the missiles hit it, only for the orange explosions to be absorbed into the inky void of its body.</p><p>Agatha glanced toward the Twins, both clutching Scratchy’s fur, staring toward the terrace railing, like they could sense The First Firmament too, despite being unable to see it from their angle on the floor.</p><p>“Right,” Agatha hoarsely said and cleared her throat. “Showtime, ladies and gay! Positions, please!”</p><p>Wanda guided a shocked and gaping Mrs. Hart to her spot and took her own spot right in front of Agatha.</p><p>She’d drawn a star tetrahedron on the terrace floor, using the ancient runecraft Chthon favoured to enhance her magic. The six coven members each stood at a point on the two base triangles, Agatha in the centre at the pinnacle of the third and smallest one. The perfect shape for balance and harmony.</p><p>She straightened her spine, attempting to exude confidence as The First Firmament batted away a fighter jet like it was an annoying fly, sending it hurtling to the ground and exploding on impact.</p><p>When it seemed to set its’ sights on the Fortress, Agatha opened her connection to the coven, setting their magic aglow. She’d spent a lot of time getting them used to the magic surge, and yet Mrs. Hart still gasped, eyes glowing green and giggled like a whore. Agatha winked at her and smirked when she flushed bright red.</p><p>At the playful gesture, everyone relaxed as much as they could under the circumstances, and Agatha released a breath when she felt the roiling magic settle and their connection clear up and stabilise.</p><p>In her hand she summoned a small brass bell, a treasured memento of her time with Nicky, and dinged it with a delicate brass striker. On cue, in perfect harmony, the coven hummed, the sound sending goosebumps across Agatha’s arms and she momentarily forgot about the approaching threat, absorbed in her coven.</p><p>The first line of the ritual droned from them in plainchant and Agatha shuddered as her magic bloomed and swelled with their voices. Oh, Agatha loved her coven and Mrs. Hart was okay. too.</p><p>Her body glowed white along with her hair as her magic reached toward The First Firmament, attempting to bind it to Earth. To prevent it from escaping, and give Rio the time she needed to destroy it. Her power built steadily, the spell intertwining in pretty purple patterns around the gigantic body of The First Firmament. It was meant to be unobtrusive, to weave the trap and ensnare the victim at the very last moment. She couldn’t tell if The First Firmament was unaware of the spell or simply didn’t care, as it continued its strides toward the Fortress, flattening the forest beneath its feet.</p><p>A spellbound mortal could be prevented from teleporting and portaling permanently depending on Agatha’s intent, yet as she continued casting the ritual, Agatha could feel The First Firmament’s strength. Could calculate that it would be able to shake off the binding eventually. She’d prepared for that. Only needing it to stay put a few minutes, but without even knowing what she was doing, its mere presence was preventing the spell from taking hold. An anti-magic field similar to that of the Chaos King surrounding it.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>A shadow spear came hurtling directly at them.</p><p><em>‘Don’t move,’</em> Agatha growled across the coven connection a moment before the spear impacted the shield and made the Fortress tremble.</p><p>She glanced at the Twins who started crying and her heart plummeted from her chest, aching to go to them, but she inhaled a fortifying breath and continued the chant, trying to assuage her guilt at leaving them to be frightened by reminding herself that this was for them. So they would be safe and grow to become teenagers and adults and <em>live</em>.</p><p>She blinked away her tears and refocused on the spell as The First Firmament neared the ravine and stomped on Bartol and the group of Undead trying to distract it. Agatha’s heart jumped into her throat.</p><p><em>‘He’s Undead,’</em> Scratchy’s calming voice entered her mind. <em>‘He’s Rio’s, he can’t die.’</em></p><p>Agatha’s knees trembled, her entire body shook as she fought to control her emotions and her magic, fought to break through The First Firmament’s barrier.</p><p>She stared at the shadowed Ouroboros swirling across her wrists. Perhaps she should abandon the plan and just call Rio.</p><p><em>‘I’ll buy you some time,’</em> Scratchy said, hopping toward the end of the terrace. <em>‘Don’t fuck this up, Agatha.’ </em></p><p>He then leapt over the railing, and Agatha’s heart leapt with him when his trajectory took him out of sight and straight toward the bottomless ravine.</p><p>She reached for him, feeling his presence, feeling him more than she’d ever done before as a large creature climbed from the ravine. Long clawed fingers digging into the boulders, massive bat-like wings expanded half a mile in width, attached to a dark mauve muscular giant that hauled itself out of the ravine and took flight .</p><p>Scratchy turned to her mid-air, his head looked like an octopus, long tentacles flowed from the bottom of his face and toward his chest nearly reaching his abs. He looked like a Lovecraftian horror, his eyes glowing violet, and then he spun around and flew toward The First Firmament, still only half its size.</p><p>Fuck. Shit. Fuck.</p><p>A shadowy claw swiped at Scratchy’s wing and Agatha heard him roar in agony, her heart tightening. She needed to concentrate. She needed more power. She stared at the Darkhold still hovering in front of her. The pages flitting until it fell open to where Rio’s charcoal drawing greeted her.</p><p>Her gaze wildly flickered between her Ouroboros, Scratchy fighting a cosmic entity, the Twins wailing and needing her, all while her coven continued to chant, unwavering, unrelenting.</p><p>And then an influx of power entered her, making her moan.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze snapped to Wanda, who stood with a solid crown around her face, eyes gleaming red and determined.</p><p><em>‘Do not let this risk be for nothing,’  </em>The Scarlet Witch commanded and because she needed Wanda to stop immediately, instead of arguing, Agatha gathered the powerful magic and fuelled the spell. It wrapped around The First Firmament, snapped into place, and Agatha instantly cut off the coven who all sank to the ground, Wanda’s crown thankfully disappearing.</p><p>She had no time to see to any of them or the Twins as a roaring screech filled the air and Agatha looked to where a shadowy claw had pierced through Scratchy’s chest and out his back. His body evaporated into a purple cloud, and a tiny bunny form appeared in the sky before careening toward the ground.</p><p>Agatha screamed, feeling her connection to Scratchy fade, desperately calling to Rio as she teleported to him on instinct. Falling to her knees amongst the flattened forest trees and stared at the black ichor drenching his white fur, and leaking from his nose, eyes and ears and the multiple gaping wounds on his body. The sight was so horrific, her heart seized at the thought of losing him too.</p><p>“Scratch,” she breathed, tunnel-visioned, an all too familiar grief having her move mechanically as she lifted his limp little body into her arms and cradled him to her chest. Their connection had grown dull and distant.</p><p>Tears blurred her vision, because this was all her fault. Because she didn’t listen. She made them all believe in this stupid plan.</p><p>A dull <em>boom</em> had her jump in her skin and glance up at where The First Firmament’s foot had collided with a shield, stopping it from smashing Agatha into the ground. Beneath the shield, Rio stood in her leaf outfit, eyes glowing green, her hand and forearm entirely black as it was raised in the air, holding the shield in place like a giant umbrella over them.</p><p>The First Firmament rained its shadow spears into the shield, roaring angrily, but Rio only looked at Agatha.</p><p>“Sweetheart, just this once, will you listen to me, please?”</p><p>Agatha barely heard what Rio said, too busy staring at the effortless way she kept the spears at bay. Above them, the sky had turned green, dark clouds gathering, bringing with them a familiar buzz of magic found only in the Realm of Death. Rio’s power crackled in the air around them, making Agatha shiver.</p><p>Her brows knitted when she remembered Rio had spoken to her. “What?” she dumbly asked.</p><p>“Scratch will be okay,” Rio said, like it wasn’t the first time she’d said it. “Just place him in his  dimension with the Darkhold tome he’s still projecting for you, and give him time to recover.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders loosened with relief and she placed a kiss to Scratchy’s head. “Thank you, my handsome boy,” she murmured and dutifully stowed him away. She then summoned the tome and did the same with it and then looked to Rio for further instruction.</p><p>“Good,” Rio said and Agatha’s stomach bottomed out. “Thank you for binding it.”</p><p>Agatha only nodded, watching the black spread further across Rio's skin.</p><p>Watching as Rio grew larger and larger…</p><p>Needing to rapidly back up and away from Rio’s expanding and blackening body, craning her neck to keep staring and gaping…</p><p>Rio’s cosmic form was entirely obsidian, littered with familiar stars and constellations. Agatha’s moon a tiny silver speck resting low on her abdomen above the arch of her hipbone. A short black leafy skirt hung on her hips, matching the inky leaf detailed plate armour that covered her chest. Agatha stared dumbstruck at the obsidian skull bones that made up the lower half of Rio’s face, a solid mask with a metallic gleam covered her eyes, a sharp tip like an eagle’s beak framing her nose. Her hair wasn’t hair at all, instead long black vines wildly whipped about her head like Medusa’s snakes.</p><p>She was magnificent.</p><p>The shadowy clouds had darkened the world, lined by the green sky, and caused the stars and constellation across Rio's body to sparkle brilliantly.</p><p>“Prepare for Death,” Rio’s deep voice rumbled in every language, and Agatha shuddered again, gnawing at her lip.</p><p>A silly statement, and yet The First Firmament backed off, rising high into the air, calling its shadows toward itself. Portals opened all around him as he seemed to collect the shadows from wherever they’d been terrorising people, to absorb their power.</p><p>Rio bent down, taking a knee, and carefully placed her hand on the ground in front of Agatha who after a valiant battle to not look up Rio’s skirt, mechanically climbed up into her palm. She went to hold onto Rio’s giant thumb as Rio carefully walked her toward the Fortress, squishing trees and shadows beneath her gladiator sandled feet.</p><p>“I want to rut against every part of your galactic body,” Agatha dumbly said. “Hump your little toe until I pass out.”</p><p><em>‘Gross,’</em> Rio said in her head and Agatha grinned, because this was just the best thing that could have happened. She could feel her connection to Scratchy getting stronger and it allowed her to just enjoy the sight of this new form.</p><p>“You are gorgeous, darling.”</p><p>If Rio had lips, Agatha was certain she would be smirking. <em>‘Stay put, will you? I'll be done soon.’</em></p><p>Agatha moaned at the confidence and hugged Rio’s thumb, giving it a sweet kiss. Then teleported back to the terrace like she could've done without the lift. But Rio was well aware what her current form would do to Agatha.</p><p>After sending a quick glance to where the Twins were still warded on their pink blanket, Bartol sitting beside them as they excitedly stared up at Rio with gummy grins, Agatha searched for Wanda and released a breath when there was still no crown, only Wanda’s soft green eyes.</p><p>“Is Scratchy okay?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha murmured. “Thank you,” she told Wanda then looked to her coven who was staring between Agatha and Rio, mostly lingering on Rio. “<em>Thank you</em>,” Agatha told them and received smiles in return, turning to join the coven to gawk at Rio some more.</p><p>As though she’d been waiting for Agatha to look, Rio bowed, extending her wrist where a white gleaming dragon Ouroboros swirled, and blew across it. Millions of white rose petals fell around the Fortress like snowflakes, melting into the shield and fortifying it once again.</p><p>“Coven,” Agatha roughly said, feeling them gather around her, gazes still glued to Rio. “I’m going to need at least a week to fuck this vision out of my system and may relapse multiple times thereafter.”</p><p>The statement was met with a chorus of snorts and chuckles.</p><p>Lilia smirked. “Understandable.”</p><p>“We’ll babysit,” Wanda’s amused voice said.</p><p>“Call me if you want a third,” said Alice.</p><p>“So jealous,” Jen said through a grin.</p><p>“Oh my,” Mrs. Hart gasped.</p><p>“Oh god,” Billy groaned.</p><p>Agatha felt absolutely feral.</p><p>Rio tilted her head back, opened her mouth wide as inky tendrils slithered out. From their centre, the silver handle of a sword rose up. Rio’s shadowy fingers grasped it and pulled, and pulled…and pulled, the long silvery blade of the Edge of Reality right from her throat.</p><p>Agatha moaned, loud and lewd.</p><p>“Here we go again,” Lilia drawled somewhere in background. “Keep the children away from her.”</p><p>It was probably for the best that Agatha wasn’t anywhere near the Twins. She'd known who Rio was, of course. But she'd never seen her quite like <em>this</em>. Had never felt the magnitude of her power as it charged the air all around her.</p><p>“I’m going to crawl into her vagina and make my home there,” Agatha mindlessly mumbled as with sword in hand, Rio rose up into the sky until she was level with The First Firmament.</p><p>“Agatha!” Mrs. Hart gasped, clutching imaginary pearls, and Agatha turned on her in disbelief.</p><p>“<em>Look</em> at my wife, Sharon!”</p><p>“It’s Sha—oh.” Mrs Hart looked at Rio. “W-well yes, she's quite something.”</p><p>“She. Is. <em>Glorious!</em>” Agatha proclaimed, wildly gesticulating in Rio’s direction.</p><p>Mrs. Hart giggled. Cheeks flushed. “Yes, she’s very lovely, dear,” she breathily said.</p><p>Agatha scowled. “Pervert,” she said, rolled her eyes, and went back to staring at Rio. Falling silent as the world faded away. Watching as Rio’s long black serpent tongue flicked out and licked from the handle of the sword all the way up to the tip of the blade.</p><p><em>Fuck.</em></p><p>“Can she fight with a sword?” Jen wondered loudly, pulling Agatha from her debauched imaginings. “Why aren’t they just using their powers?”</p><p>Agatha had watched Rio with scimitars and longswords. Rapiers and sabres. Daggers and knives. Expertly cutting down people with a precision that left them incapacitated yet alive. Rio with a blade was the sole reason for Agatha’s knife kink.</p><p>Her chest heaved, stomach knotting in excitement.</p><p>Rio absently twirled the Edge of Reality, watching as the The First Firmament summoned more shadows to form its own dark blade, both standing on a large invisible platform about a mile up in the sky.</p><p>“Why do you protect them?” The First Firmament’s baritone blandly queried, its voice appearing to be broadcast to their minds rather than actually speaking out loud.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her hair vines seeming to have a personality of their own as they twisted and coiled about. “Does it matter?”</p><p>“You lower yourself to lay with a mortal. That thing is beneath you.”</p><p>Rio threw her head back, a chorus of cackles echoed from everywhere, ominous and chilling. An unsettling cacophony evoking an instinctive fear Agatha could feel spread through the coven.</p><p>Rio looked to The First Firmament again, drawing the tip of the Edge of Reality across the invisible platform. As though sliding against a grindstone, green sparks sprung forth that rocketed to the forest below like fireballs, setting it alight in green flames.</p><p>“Beneath me, on top of me, behind me, inside of me,” Rio drawled. “I'm verse, baby. And for insulting her, I won't only destroy you, I’ll turn you into a cautionary tale for all those who dare to threaten what’s mine.”</p><p>The clouds rumbled with thunder, gathering above The First Firmament. “I will swallow you into Oblivion, Lady Death. Destroy all you foolishly hold dear. Only you and I will remain and I will watch you suffocate in your failure until the end of time.”</p><p>Rio cocked her head to the other side. “You will wither beneath my wrath. Be obliterated by my omnipotence. I will strip you of everything that you are and remake you as an organism, a permanent part of this Multiverse you so despise. A relic for mortals to gawk at an pity for its hubris.” She shifted into a battle stance, raising her sword, tip pointed at The First Firmament. “Find peace, aberration, for you will be unmade by the spawn of Creation and creation’s ultimate end.”</p><p>“Do you think they all attended the same monologuing class?” Jen asked.</p><p>Wanda snickered. “Finishing school for little cosmic entities.”</p><p>“Shush,” Agatha said, gaze locked on Rio, ignoring the cackling from her coven.</p><p>The First Firmament roared, lightning struck from the sky as it flew forward, Rio meeting the swing of its shadowy sword with the Edge of Reality in a deafening crack that made the ground shake and Agatha’s ears ring. The Twins though, squealed in delight, as magic sparked with every strike, falling to the ground like meteorites cratering into the earth.</p><p>They were high enough that a considerable part of New Jersey was affected, setting fire to the forest and hitting parts of Eastview.</p><p>“Should we like, do something?” Alice asked.</p><p>In the distance Captains Marvel and Rambeau appeared as tiny glowing specks flying about attempting to contain the fire along with a few more costume-clad heroes Agatha had no interest in knowing the names of.</p><p>“I suppose,” Agatha said, reluctantly gathering her magic because she would much rather be watching Rio with her full attention. “Let’s shield the area beneath them.”</p><p>She had made it sound simple, but the shield would need to be able to absorb the powerful cosmic debris. The coven was determined though, no doubt in fear for their homes being affected, and Agatha guided their magic to build a barrier beneath the clashing titans.</p><p>Rio still moved the same, smooth arches and graceful twirls, as she sliced her sword across The First Firmament torso, ducking beneath its swing and leaving a long silver gash leaking glittery ichor in her wake. And after the call out from The First Firmament, Agatha could imagine that Rio had chosen a more shapely humanoid form to piss it off. Could imagine sinking into Rio’s cleavage and happily being smothered to death by her giant black breasts.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Lilia growled. “For the love of god, contain your horniness while we're <em>this</em> connected.”</p><p>“Can you blame me?”</p><p>She was met with a vindicating silence. Good, she was glad for the lack of distraction as Rio’s strikes landed faster and faster, severing first one arm, then the other. The limbs falling to the Coven’s shield, forming an inky pool that dripped down onto the forest fire, killing the flames and the trees, and gathering in a large black pool.</p><p>She glanced up and bit her lip when Rio continued slicing away piece after piece, her maniacal cackling filling the air, until there was nothing left of The First Firmament aside from the obsidian ichor lake that had flattened a good part of the forest.</p><p>The world fell silent and Agatha dropped the barrier spell.</p><p>A light, rose-scented breeze blew past them, fluttered over the forest, and extinguished the flames.</p><p>The Edge of Reality vanished from Rio’s grip as she stood facing the black lake. And from its centre, something rose into the air, cylindrical and large, taking on the shape of a blackened tree trunk. Rising upward, the pool receded to give it form and the forest regrew lush and healthy around its’ base. It reached toward the sky, as tall as The First Firmament had once stood, then black branches flicked outward, stretching far and wide as pretty silver leaves grew in the shape of an Angel Oak tree.</p><p>Agatha exhaled.</p><p>The clouds faded away to reveal a clear blue sky.</p><p>The buzz of Rio drew back, presumably returning to her realm.</p><p>Rio vanished from the sky and appeared on the terrace in her mortal vessel. Instantly rushing toward the Twins who squealed in delight as she levitated them into her arms while she was still a few feet away. Agatha smiled, staring at the tender scene as Wanda slipped her locket around her neck and gave her shoulder a squeeze.</p><p>Agatha patted her hand, eyes glued to Rio and the Twins.</p><p>“This is your one and only warning to escape, coven,” she thickly said, feeling them merrily scurrying into the the guest wing. Probably in delirious relief that it was over. That they were safe. The only one not getting the message was Mrs. Hart who was clutching her chest and staring at Rio and her children with teary eyes.</p><p>“Come on, Sharon,” Wanda softly said and guided her inside as Rio pulled Bartol into a hug.</p><p>Despite wanting to go to them, Agatha felt glued in place.</p><p><em>'Feeling better?'</em> She checked on Scratchy even though she could feel him getting stronger.</p><p><em>'Much. I'm going to nap. Summon the Darkhold if you need it.'</em></p><p><em>‘You were amazing.’</em></p><p><em>‘I know.’</em></p><p><em>'Rest well.</em><em>’</em></p><p><em>‘Love you.'</em></p><p><em>'Love you too.'</em></p><p>A portal appeared, and Bartol was sent through it with the Twins. Despite the threat being defeated, Agatha still felt a wave of relief that they were safely at home. And she wanted to follow, wanted them all to be together, but also needed Rio closer and all to herself, and clenched her fists at her sides, struck with indecision.</p><p>Rio turned to her. “Could we have a moment alone?” she asked and Agatha’s world shifted to her as she walked closer. Focused on the arms that wrapped around her shoulders, wrapped her own around Rio’s waist and pulled her in, breathed her in.</p><p>“I’m a little angry at you,” Rio murmured, scratching the hair at the base of Agatha’s skull.</p><p>“For binding it?”</p><p>“No, for standing there and have it nearly stomping you.”</p><p>“I knew you were on your way.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but the second Agatha had called for her she’d been certain Rio would arrive soon. Had no doubt that Rio had everything else covered so she could focus on Scratchy.</p><p>“I missed you,” Agatha rasped, pulling her closer, smirking when she watched whatever anger Rio was pretending to have melt away.</p><p>Rio hummed. “I missed you too. Did you enjoy the show?” she asked, causing Agatha’s magic to roar at the reminder.</p><p>“I'm going to ruin you,” Agatha lowly purred, cupping Rio’s face.</p><p>“That much, huh?”</p><p>“I’ve added something <em>huge</em> to my list of preferences,” she said and kissed the giggles from Rio's mouth.</p><p>Rio moaned softly. “Are you thinking what I'm thinking?” she murmured against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“You, me, and the Edge of Reality, christening the Firmament Tree?”</p><p>Rio grinned devilishly and transported them away.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Chthon leapt out of the portal, landing in the silver blades of grass, and rolled a few times to extinguish the green flames burning through her witch’s robes.</p><p>She tossed and turned and finally settled breathlessly on her back, her satchel beside her and groaned at the feather-light weight of Scratchy appearing on her chest.</p><p>Beady little eyes filled with judgement stared down at her. <em>‘You couldn’t magic the flames gone?’</em></p><p><em>‘Shut up.’</em></p><p>He chuckled. <em>‘Done now?’</em></p><p>Chthon sighed and absently stroked through his fur as she stared up at the pretty constellations in the Realm of Death. <em>‘Almost.’</em></p><p><em>‘Do you want to do the rest alone?’</em></p><p><em>‘Yes, please.’</em></p><p>She chuckled as his whiskers tickled her neck in a goodbye nuzzle before he vanished, no doubt to go harass Bart.</p><p>Jumping to her feet, Chthon brushed off the dust from her scorched clothes, rolled her eyes at herself, and repaired the damage with a flick of her wrist. After retrieving her satchel and placing it over her shoulder, she set her sights on the obsidian pyramid about a mile away.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>She entered what some on Earth might describe as the Garden of Eden. The glass inside the pyramid reflected a clear blue sky, sun rays breaking through the thick green foliage. Trees and plants decorated the inside, sectioned by pretty stone pathways that ran throughout the large surface area and was lined with colourful flower beds.</p><p>Chthon walked toward the centre where a small waterfall cascaded into a pretty pond covered in water lilies and lotus flowers. The trees gave way to a grass covered meadow where the only notable structures were the seven sarcophagi propped up to face the gorgeous water fixture at a forty-five degree angle.</p><p>Each sarcophagus was made of its own unique material, wood-crafted, metal-crafted, and stone-crafted. Yet what bound them by design, was River’s signature style and artistry. The time and care that had gone into creating a final resting place for her bodies, always brought a bittersweet smile to Chthon’s face.</p><p>River knew they were only vessels. Knew they would see each other again one day. And yet she’d built this memorial inside her heart. Somewhere she visited frequently, especially when Chthon was absent.</p><p>She swallowed thickly.</p><p>What was once River’s special place, had now become theirs. River shared it openly and freely and Chthon doubted there was anything in the cosmos River wouldn’t give her should she want it.</p><p>Her chest tightened, eyes landing on the eighth sarcophagi. A smaller one nearest to the waterfall in its own special place. Behind it, River had crafted shelving in the shape of a tree. On the branched platforms, she’d placed small whittled animals. Like the ones she’d gifted Nicky on his birthday each year.</p><p>There were well over two hundred of them, Chthon had memorised them all. Hadn’t dared touch any, yet she still recognised the newest one that had been added. A tiny platypus. Which meant River had already been there that day.</p><p>She lowered onto the lush grass at the foot of the small sarcophagus and opened up her satchel.</p><p>Chthon was careful to not leave anything behind after her visits. Not in there. River had said she could, but it was enough for her that both of them could finally have this. That they were able to stand beside each other and mourn their son. Especially on days like today when every thought became ‘what if’…</p><p>She carefully unpacked the items she’d risked her life to gather, and set to work assembling them.</p><p>“It’s a Blood Moon, which means your mother’s going to go all out again,” she murmured as she watched her careful spellwork mould the items to her will. “But I won’t let her win this time.” She chuckled to herself.</p><p>Wanda’s therapist had said that even if Nicky couldn’t hear her, it was still good for Chthon to express the things she wanted him to know out loud. To not keep them inside.</p><p>She sighed, that familiar doubt creeping up her belly. Two years since her core memories had returned. Two years since grasping the full extent of her immortality. She was still only at sixty percent of her power. But two years of knowing and she couldn’t shake this one persistent thought…</p><p>“Do you think that this time I should come to you?” She finally gave voice to it. The guilt. The longing. The feeling of her utter failure as a mother…</p><p>Tears burned in her eyes, falling onto the burning green embers she was carefully crafting.</p><p>All Chthon had ever had, had ever wanted and needed, was River. Now Nicky was there in the Spirit Realm. Joining him meant leaving River. Continuing this cycle of rebirth meant being unable to see Nicky again.</p><p>Her intent had been immortality. She wasn’t sure the magic could even be reversed. The only way she could think of would be if the indestructible Darkhold could be destroyed. If <em>Scratchy</em> was destroyed… Her soul was intrinsically linked to him. They were bound as tightly and irrevocably as she and River was. Chthon’s life felt like theirs as much as it was her own.</p><p>She swallowed thickly. “Grandy says you don’t experience time like I do. That you don’t feel the years that have passed. That when I see you again, you’ll remember me as you did on the day I lost you.” She sniffed, and blinked the tears from her eyes. Could they have that? Could they be together again one day?</p><p>But River, she wouldn’t be able to—</p><p>A soft breeze blew across her wet cheeks and Chthon ducked her head toward the phantom hand on her shoulder.</p><p>“Please stop,” Rio’s father’s voice spoke in her mind. “Nicky understands. He wants you to be happy.” Chthon’s shoulders shook when the phantom touch enveloped her in an embrace. “They all want you to be happy, sweetling.”</p><p>“I miss him, dad,” she cried. “I miss them all.” Being encircled by the soothing presence caused her to sob harder, more openly than she would allow herself anywhere else. “I can’t leave River.”</p><p>“Neither have asked you to make a choice.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Do you want to know what Nicky thinks?”</p><p>“You’ve spoken to him about his?”</p><p>“Many in the Spirit Realm anticipate seeing loved ones again. Given the particular situation your soul finds itself in, I thought it best to let him know why it may be different for him with his mothers.”</p><p>Chthon exhaled, wiping her tears. “What did he say?”</p><p>“He loves that his mothers can be together. He loves that you can be there for his siblings.”</p><p>Chthon burst into tears again and groaned. “Oh god, just make it stop.”</p><p>“You’ve always been very affected by Earth’s Blood Moon.”</p><p>She snorted wetly. “I’m sorry my wailing drew you here. Every year its like I lose him all over again.”</p><p>“Aoens have passed and still I long for my children. What helps is accepting comfort from the family that remain. Sharing in the joy of togetherness.”</p><p>Chthon smiled softly and nodded.</p><p>“It’s the nature of The Spirit Realm to offer contentment for the soul. To ease worry. Our family is happy there, my darling girl. All they want is for you to be happy here.”</p><p> “I am happy,” Chthon breathed, chest aching. The reason for the abrupt onslaught of guilt was because she was happier than she had ever been. And she and River had millennia of pure unadulterated happiness behind them. But this feeling now…</p><p>“Good,” her father murmured. “Now, dry your tears. Your guests have arrived.”</p><p>Chthon nodded. “Thirty minutes?”</p><p>“Take as long as you need, moonbeam.”</p><p>“Thank you for coming.”</p><p>Chthon felt the whisper of a kiss to her temple. “Always.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p>She walked out of the portal into their bedroom at the Villa in Spain. Their first holiday home in that iteration of the cosmos and Chthon was happy that it had become a family destination more than the couple’s retreat she and River enjoyed creating for themselves.</p><p>She made her way through the house, sensing the lingering magic of where the guest rooms had all been occupied. Her heart growing tighter at the feeling of contentment and fulfilment that threatened to overwhelm her every fucking full moon when they all came together.</p><p>Stepping onto the porch, Chthon stared across the moonlit courtyard illuminated by the fairy lights that lit up the ever-blooming Jacaranda tree. Beneath it, on the large quilt Mrs. Hart had taken over a year to make for them, River’s mother and the Never Queen—who wore an emerald jumpsuit and had shrunk herself to a shorter six feet—sat nibbling on the snacks laid out on a wooden board that showed River had been there not too long ago.</p><p>The Twins would turn four years old soon. Growing too fast, but still innocently unaware that Chthon could sense their magic. Could sense when they were catching on mischief. Infinity’s aura shone brightly as she camouflaged up in the branches of the Jacaranda. Eternity had turned invisible, yet his magical signature glowed from behind the trunk as both tried to very poorly hide from her.</p><p>Chthon smothered a grin and lowered onto the blanket, hugging The One Above All. “Thank you, mom,” she murmured, for earlier in the pyramid. For them being there to visit. For entertaining her guests and babysitting the Twins.</p><p>“I figured since River said she would cook, I would come celebrate the Blood Moon with you.”</p><p>Chthon smiled, grateful as always for their tact, and leaned over to Never placing kisses on either of her cheeks, trying not to look in the direction of the snickering coming from the Jacaranda tree.</p><p>“You’re looking very domesticated, Never.”</p><p>“You must be mistaken,” Never drawled, delicately sipping on a glass of wine. “Your sedentary lifestyle is not for everyone, dear friend.”</p><p>Chthon snorted. Wanda would wear her down in no time. Never was already a regular at their monthly family dinners. A lunar cycle for an entity like Never was a blink of the eye. They’d seen each other more in that iteration than they had for the first billion years post Chthon remembering during the seventh.</p><p>“My lifestyle is perfect, thank you very much,” Chthon faux pouted. “You would be so lucky to have a fraction of my happiness. But what is this?” she loudly exclaimed, eyes rounded wide. “Is my happiness fading?”</p><p>Little gasps were heard from the Jacaranda tree and The One Above All grinned. “Oh no, dear Chthon, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“My children! Where have my children gone?” she dramatically said, a wrist to her forehead, palm over her heart. “I need hugs from my children or my happiness will fade away!”</p><p>“No, Mama!” Eternity predictably broke first, teleporting into her arms followed closely by Infinity, more subdued, little red brows furrowed as she shrewdly looked Chthon over.</p><p>“Mama?” Infinity softly asked.</p><p>“My children are here!” Chthon exclaimed and wrapped them up in her arms. “Oh, my happiness is saved. Thank you, my darlings.”</p><p>They happily giggled in her lap and Chthon lavished them with kisses and tickles until they squirmed away and ran off chasing each other across the lawn.</p><p>She watched them with a large smile that slowly dropped as she addressed her guests. “Did River tell you we’re considering sending them to an Earth school?”</p><p>“Is that wise?” Never asked.</p><p>“Much as I wish to keep them with us forever, we need to consider what’s best for them. They’re growing at a human rate. Their minds are developing like human children.”</p><p>“River mentioned this school you’re considering is adept at handling special cases,” The One Above All said.</p><p>“Not <em>this</em> level of special.”</p><p>Never scoffed. “All parents think that of their children.”</p><p>“No, my children are objectively more special than all others, but what I meant was that this school is only used to dealing with aliens and meta-humans. Not cosmic entities. The thought of leaving them in anyone else’s care terrifies me with them still being vulnerable outside of home.”</p><p>“Understandable,” The One Above All said. “Though you have time to consider it some more. For now, don’t you have somewhere to be?”</p><p>Chthon smirked and stood. “Yes, it’s about time for my grand entrance,” she announced, and shot up into the sky.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>It was a short flight over their property. They’d procured most of the surrounding land in the valley to ensure privacy. Chthon easily spotted the coven in a meadow near the stream that ran into the river that flowed passed the main house.</p><p>She was sure not to accost them with her magic as she gathered purple lighting all around her, having it strike from her palms to the ground at their feet, causing them to startle and glare up at her as she descended in style, hands raised, hair blowing from her face and grin wide and pompous.</p><p>She landed in front of them with a lift of her chin, arms spread grandly to unimpressed looks that only tickled her more. Mrs. Hart was the only one to enthusiastically clap and Chthon winked at her, causing a predictable flush of delight.</p><p>“Finally,” Jen muttered and walked into Chthon’s still open arms for a quick hug.</p><p>“I’m a busy woman, Jen.”</p><p>“Good to see you, Agatha.” Alice was a lot more apt at expressing her emotions and hugged her a little longer.</p><p>Chthon smiled at Billy over her shoulder who hadn’t been able to attend the last three family dinners and the second Alice left her arms it was filled with a boy who had fast grown into a man. They didn’t speak and Wanda’s soft gaze and smile was patient as the coven let her hold him, as Billy allowed her to hold him like he was twelve years old again.</p><p>“You’re staying the weekend?” Chthon checked.</p><p>Billy nodded and stepped away averting his gaze and Chthon let him compose himself.</p><p>“A whole weekend without the boyfriend,” Lilia drawled leaning into Chthon’s embrace next, Mrs. Hart following soon after. “However will he survive.”</p><p>“Eric might’ve moved on by the time he gets back,” Chthon said.</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. “He’s name’s Derrick, Agatha. Get it right,” she said stepping into Chthon’s arms next, both of them waiting for the little huff that followed.</p><p>“It’s Eddy,” Billy mumbled and they all burst out cackling, simply enjoying being together again. Feeling their magic flow comfortingly throughout the coven bond.</p><p>Naturally, they took up position in a circle, the spot across from Chthon notably empty.</p><p>She released a long-suffering sigh. “Yes, River darling, you beat me at being fashionably late. We’re all awaiting your grand entrance!”</p><p>She crossed her arms and pouted, feeling the air grow thick as the sky turned green. Rolling her eyes she avoided looking at the coven who simply loved it whenever River decided to be ostentatious, but it was apparently tedious and overdone whenever <em>she</em> felt like adding a little flare to their lives.</p><p>The stream up ahead turned inky black and the scent of roses filled the air.</p><p>Chthon’s inhaled, eyelids fluttering. No matter how many times that scent washed over her, it was never enough. She could never get her fill.</p><p>The oily water rose and took the shape of River’s gorgeous body, the figure walking out onto the bank before it took the shape of her beautiful wife in her signature black cloak.</p><p>“Hello, Agatha’s coven,” River said, eyes glued to Chthon. Her entrance was very subdued, which meant that she had something bigger up her sleeve.</p><p>“Hey, Rio,” the coven said. Still simping after three years. River unable to do anything wrong in their eyes.</p><p>“Hello, my love,” River said.</p><p>“Hello, darling.”</p><p>Jen snorted. “And here I thought that maybe<em> this</em> full moon would be different. That maybe Agatha and Rio would decide to spare us this time.”</p><p>“Let's just get on with it so I can start drinking.” Lilia sighed.</p><p>Despite the complaints, everyone was smiling at Billy and Mrs. Hart, who stood opposite each other in the circle and took a step toward each other.</p><p>“This used to be part of a mop I had in the seventies,” Mrs. Hart said motioning to the Hexenbessen broom she held. “I crocheted the end so you wont get hurt when riding it.”</p><p>“Aw, thank you, Mrs. Hart.” Billy looked genuinely touched, as he always did. “I love it.” He then presented the broom he’d been holding. “I got some wood from the hardware store and Eddie helped me whittle it for you…”</p><p>“Oh, my!” Mrs. Hart said like she was speaking to a five year old showing her his crayon drawing.</p><p>Chthon tuned out the pleasantries, meeting the dark challenging gaze burning into her face, head on.</p><p>“You gave this to me last time,” Wanda said holding out a broom to Lilia in the centre of the circle.</p><p>“Same,” Lilia said with a smirk and after a perfunctory exchange, they returned to their positions in the circle.</p><p>“I found this in the woods.” Alice grinned at Jen, holding up a glorified branch. They’d gotten married the year before and had defiled the villa for a large portion of an extensive honeymoon.</p><p>“I got this by the stream over there,” Jen pointed in the direction, grinning back just as widely at Alice as they exchanged their brooms and went back to their spots in the circle.</p><p>Chthon held River’s stare.</p><p>“I went first last time,” River said.</p><p>Despite having expected the response, Chthon rolled her eyes. She gathered her magic and moved her black fingers in languid yet precise gestures. A small tear in the fabric of time and space opened, the scent of brimstone and petrichor preceding the sleek metallic broom handle that floated into their plane of existence.</p><p>Chthon smirked at the immediate interest from River. “The handle was forged with vibranium, stolen from the belly of Mount Bashenga in the heart of Wakanda.”</p><p>River’s pretty brown eyes lit up.</p><p> Chthon motioned to the bouquet of green lava flowers at the brooms head. “I picked these deep down at the bottom of a volcano in Arallu. The seeds had taken root and have bloomed in the magma since the fourth iteration of the cosmos. For as long as the flowers remain connected to the vibranium they will continue to bloom for your pleasure alone.”</p><p>She touched the handle, the flowers bursting into pretty green flames and River looked ready to explode as she stared at it with wide eyes filled with want.</p><p>“Their fire burns as eternal as my love for you,” Chthon said and smirked at the predictable groans that followed, loving every second of the coven’s discomfort and River’s delight, who poked her tongue into her cheek, gaze dragging lazily from the broom to Chthon, who could tell that River intended to express her gratitude for the gift very thoroughly.</p><p>She licked her lips when River held out her fists, pressed them side-by-side, and then slowly moved them apart, a broom taking shape in the space widening in front of her.</p><p>With a gasp, Chthon took in the dark midnight handle, glittering with tiny stars and constellations. The head was like the nucleus of a comet, a violet dust trail bursting out to form a gorgeous tail.</p><p>“This is an undiscovered quasar galaxy,” River murmured, staring at Chthon, while Chthon stared at the broom. “Uninhabited by sentient life since its formation five billion years ago. It's most extraordinary feature is its sun, that radiates a luminescent glow reminiscent of your eyes.” Rio’s fingers trailed across the top of the broomhead where the purple sun seemed to be encased in glass, likely lending the dust trail its brilliant violet hue. “I gift you this galaxy to be viewed and enjoyed for the ten million years it will take its black hole to swallow it entirely. I hope that each time you look at it, you’ll be reminded of how utterly its beauty pales in comparison to yours.”</p><p>Chthon grinned widely at the groans from the coven, matching River’s brilliant smile.</p><p>Alice and Jen actually facepalmed and Chthon gleefully ignored them as she rushed toward River who met her halfway and crashed their mouths together.</p><p>“I love it,” she mumbled, in between kisses, wrestling River to the ground who willingly went down, letting herself be pinned.</p><p>“I love you,” River said, bucking up into her.</p><p>“I hate you both so much,” Jen muttered.</p><p>Alice sighed. “You’re lucky this place is the best vacation spot, or we would ignore all your calls.”</p><p>“Should we just come back later?” Wanda asked.</p><p>River smiled and their teeth knocked when Chthon smiled too. But she got up and helped River off the ground.</p><p>One of their favourite things these days, was making the coven cringe, who after watching far too many cosmic monologues and intense farewell declarations of eternal love, assumed that—“because they were old as time”—it was just the ridiculous way they spoke to each other on occasion.</p><p>“No, I want to test out my new broom,” Chthon said. Summoning Rio’s gift closer, who did the same with her pretty galaxy broom so they could exchange them.</p><p>“Thank god,” Jen muttered and they all paired up again.</p><p>River’s hand brushed against hers, a silent promise as she carefully took her gift.</p><p>They touched their broomheads together. Their ouroboros lighting up as their magic mingled. As River allowed a taste of her own power to flow through the coven connection. Soothing, calming, slotting perfectly in place like a puzzle piece.</p><p>Chthon stared softly into pretty brown eyes. Unadulterated happiness filling her chest to bursting capacity.</p><p><em>“Pro te, dilecta, aperio viam,” </em>they murmured in perfect harmony, the echoes of the coven accentuating the declaration.</p><p>For you, beloved, I open the way.</p><p align="center">*********</p><p align="center"><strong>THE END</strong></p><p align="center">*********</p>
