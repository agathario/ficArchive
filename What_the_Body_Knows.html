<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>At 37, Rio joins dance therapy as a last resort—disconnected, grieving, and unsure how to move through the world, let alone a studio. When she’s paired with the quiet, guarded Agatha, something shifts.

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Dance therapy was Rio’s last option.</p><p>Actually, not even that—more like a desperate shot in the dark. Nothing else was working, so when she came across this dance-therapy promising emotional and physical healing, expression, connection, listening to your body… well, it sounded like exactly what she needed.</p><p>Even if it also sounded terrifying.</p><p>It had been two weeks since she started, and so far it was going… okay? Maybe. Kind of.</p><p>She still struggled to express herself in front of others, even though the group was small—just six people, including her. As a 37-year-old woman, Rio found it deeply embarrassing to move in front of strangers. Especially when she felt like every part of her was awkward, heavy, offbeat.</p><p>And yet, here she was again.</p><p>Walking to the studio in leggings and a white sweatshirt, gym bag slung over her shoulder. As soon as she stepped inside, everyone turned to look.</p><p>
<em>Awkward.</em>
</p><p>“Oh! Hello, Rio!”</p><p>Wanda, the therapist—and a relentlessly sunny woman—beamed at her.</p><p>Rio offered a tight, polite smile. “Hi.”</p><p>“Come on in! We’re just about to start.”</p><p>She dropped her bag in the corner and quietly joined the others in the center of the room. A quick, subtle nod to the group. Arms crossed in front of her chest. Shrinking.</p><p>Wanda clapped her hands once. “So! Today we’re doing something a little different.”</p><p>People shifted, curious.</p><p>“We’re working in pairs!” she said, with a grin that made Rio’s stomach twist.</p><p>Dancing was already hard enough alone. Now she had to do it with someone else?</p><p>“Can we choose our partners?” Jacob asked, grinning like he was in summer camp.</p><p>“Well,” Wanda said, walking slowly across the floor, “I have an idea for that. Since there are six of you, let’s split into two groups—three on the right side of the studio, three on the left. Those on the right will choose someone from the left to be their partner. Sound good?”</p><p>A mix of excited and hesitant sounds filled the room.</p><p>Wanda smiled, like this was going exactly as planned. “Great! Take a minute and choose your side.”</p><p>After a bit of shuffling, Rio ended up on the left. Which meant she’d be picked. Or not.</p><p>Neither option felt good.</p><p>Across from her were Jacob (too eager), Benjamin (who looked perpetually lost), and… Agatha.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t looking at anyone. She stared at the floor like it held a secret only she could hear. She fidgeted with her fingers, a nervous storm wrapped in stillness.</p><p>Rio had been trying to figure her out since day one. Agatha wasn’t mysterious in some poetic way—she was tired. Not broken, but dimmed. Like a flame still burning, but barely.</p><p>Rio had once overheard her talking to Wanda. Words like “abuse” and “pain” Things Rio recognized.</p><p><em>She’s not going to pick me,</em> Rio thought, that familiar ache of unworthiness curling in her chest.</p><p>
<em>Why would she?</em>
</p><p>“Alright,” Wanda said gently. “Those on the right can choose who they feel drawn to.”</p><p>Jacob darted forward to his friend, Beatrice, all enthusiasm. Benjamin hesitated, then wandered over to Rose.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move.</p><p>She was the last one on the right side. All eyes were gently waiting.</p><p>“Take your time, Agatha,” Wanda said softly.</p><p>Agatha slowly looked up. Her gaze moved across the room, checking the pairs. And then—</p><p>She met Rio’s eyes.</p><p>Only for a second.</p><p>But it landed deep.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t going to move any sooner. And that was okay.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. Something about that look—raw, uncertain, real—pulled her in. Without letting herself think too much, she stepped forward. One, two, three small steps.</p><p>And now she stood in front of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha blinked, surprised.</p><p>“That was beautiful, Rio,” Wanda said, her voice full of warmth. “Really beautiful.”</p><p>She clapped her hands gently. “Now, take a few minutes to connect with your partner. This part matters.”</p><p>Around them, quiet conversations began. Rio stayed still, her eyes still on Agatha. And Agatha looked right back.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said softly.</p><p>Rio extended her hand. “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated but reached out and shook it.</p><p>Then she glanced toward Wanda. Wanda met her gaze, smiled, and gave her a thumbs-up, like a quiet nod of encouragement.</p><p>Agatha turned back. “Are you… okay?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then nodded. “Yeah. I’m fine.”</p><p>They both knew that wasn’t true. No one came to therapy like this because everything was fine. But Agatha didn’t push. She just gave her a small, understanding smile.</p><p>When Rio opened her mouth to say something more, Wanda’s voice returned.</p><p>“Alright, everyone. Are we ready to begin?”</p><p>“But we don’t know what we’re doing,” Rose said, raising a hand.</p><p>“You’re absolutely right,” Wanda replied. “That’s why I’ll guide you.”</p><p>She walked to the center. “This isn’t about touching. It’s not about doing it right. This is about feeling. Staying present with yourself—and noticing the other person beside you.”</p><p>A few people nodded. Someone took a shaky breath.</p><p>“If anything feels uncomfortable, that’s okay. You can break eye contact. You’re in control of your own body. There’s no failure here.”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha and noticed how tense she was. Her shoulders high, fingers restless.</p><p>“Are you ready?” Wanda asked the room.</p><p>Everyone nodded, or something close to it.</p><p>“You and your partner can pick a corner where you feel safe dancing. Go ahead.”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha. “Where do you want to go?”</p><p>Agatha pointed to a quiet corner near her bag. “There.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Okay. Let’s go.”</p><p>They walked together, quiet.</p><p>Once everyone had found a place, Wanda began again.</p><p>“Feel your feet on the ground. The weight of your breath. Let it settle you.”</p><p>The room grew calm.</p><p>“Now, gently raise your arms above your head. Feel the stretch in your chest, your shoulders.”</p><p>They moved slowly. The quiet grew thicker, like mist.</p><p>They stretched and released for five long minutes.</p><p>And then—Wanda’s voice again.</p><p>“Our first activity: Emotional reflection.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow and looked at Agatha, who looked deeply uncertain.</p><p>“In this activity,” Wanda said, “you’ll begin to move with one core emotion. Whatever you’re feeling most. Let it guide you. Let it live in your body. Your partner will mirror you. Not copy—mirror. They’ll witness. Respond.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. Her chest already ached.</p><p>Let herself be seen? Even just a little?</p><p>Agatha looked at her, and for a moment, they both stood there—<em>two women with too many invisible wounds, about to speak without words.</em></p><p>Rio took a shaky breath and let her arms fall loosely to her sides. She focused on the tightness curling low in her stomach—an ache she’d carried for years. She allowed her body to sag just a little, slow and heavy.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened as she watched. Then, almost instinctively, she lifted her own arms—slowly, carefully—mirroring Rio’s weight and hesitation, but adding a delicate tremble, like she was testing the air.</p><p>Rio noticed. Her chest tightened again—but in a different way. Not fear. Something closer to hope.</p><p>She shifted slightly, letting her movements grow a bit freer, swaying like a fragile wave.</p><p>Agatha responded with the same gentle rhythm, their bodies slowly syncing—not perfectly, but honestly.</p><p>Neither spoke. Neither tried to fix or control.</p><p>They simply moved, sharing their invisible wounds in silence.</p><p>Wanda circled quietly around the room, her smile warm and encouraging, reminding them all that this was a space for honesty, not performance.</p><p>Rio’s breath trembled, her gaze flickering to Agatha’s.</p><p>Then, unexpectedly, Agatha whispered, “Is that sadness?”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>She hadn’t expected words.</p><p>She didn’t even know how to answer.</p><p>But she nodded.</p><p>Agatha exhaled like she’d been holding that breath for years.</p><p>Then, without breaking eye contact, she mirrored Rio’s movement again—arms curling gently in and out, like tides pulling in something tender.</p><p>They kept dancing, but now… something had shifted.</p><p>They weren’t just mirroring anymore.</p><p>They were <em>listening</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes didn’t leave Rio’s.</p><p>But something in them had changed.</p><p>The stillness she’d carried—tense and guarded—began to crack, just slightly. Her mouth parted like she might say something, but nothing came out. Instead, she moved again—barely. A slow, shaky gesture: her hand lifted toward her chest and then curled into a fist, pressing lightly against her sternum.</p><p>A gesture of pain.</p><p>Of something locked in.</p><p>Rio mirrored her—not exactly, but in essence. She moved a little closer, her posture soft, her breath calm.</p><p>Agatha’s movements grew disjointed, less like mirroring and more like <em>leaking.</em> Her hands fluttered, stopped. Her shoulders lifted, like she wanted to shrink away.</p><p>And then—</p><p>Her whole body trembled once.</p><p>Not violently, not dramatic. Just… enough.</p><p>Her arms wrapped around herself, and she turned slightly—not away from Rio, but inward, as if trying to hold something together that had been crumbling for too long.</p><p>Rio didn’t reach for her. She didn’t move forward.</p><p>Instead, she mirrored the rhythm of Agatha’s breath—slow, steady, anchored.</p><p>A tear slipped down Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>She didn’t wipe it away.</p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose and let herself settle into stillness, staying present—<em>not watching</em>, but <em>witnessing.</em></p><p>Around them, the room was silent.</p><p>And then, from the center of the studio, Wanda’s voice returned—soft, gentle, like a warm blanket:</p><p>“Now slowly… let your body return to stillness. Notice your breath. Your heartbeat. The space between you.”</p><p>Rio stayed still, eyes on Agatha.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look back right away. But after a moment, she straightened, wiped her cheek with the back of her hand, and finally met Rio’s eyes again.</p><p>There was no smile. No “I’m fine.”</p><p>Just a flicker of something Rio recognized instantly:</p><p>
<em>Trust.</em>
</p><p>And it was enough.</p><p>They stared at each other for a while until Wanda broke all the thoughts in their own heads.</p><p>“Great job, everyone! I could feel everything by just walking next to you. The next activity is Trust Walk.”</p><p>
<em>Huh</em>
</p><p>Wanda started to walk around the room once again. “This one is more delicate, so it’s ok if you’re not ready for it.”</p><p>Everyone was quiet, waiting for the instructions.</p><p>“One partner will close their eyes and the other will guide them through the space. You can use gentle touch or verbal cues to guide your partner, being respectful of their boundaries of course. After a few minutes, switch the roles.”</p><p>Rio actually thought this idea was really interesting. It can help with self-reflection and reflecting others as well.</p><p>“So, are we ready?”</p><p>Everyone nodded slowly, except Agatha, who was now staring at the floor just like when session started.</p><p>Rio noticed that she was nervous. “I can start if you want.” she said with a small smile.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. “Yes.” was all she said.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll close my eyes then.” Rio closed her eyes and waited for Agatha’s guidance.</p><p>Rio felt Agatha move behind her, but Agatha hadn’t made any more moves.</p><p>The silence stretched, long and heavy, like something caught between them.</p><p>Rio kept her eyes closed, trying not to tense up. She waited… and waited.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>So she spoke, voice soft but steady.</p><p>“It’s okay, Agatha. You can touch me.”</p><p>Another beat of silence.</p><p>Then a breath—not Rio’s. A shaky one. Agatha’s.</p><p>Still, no hands came. Just the warmth of her standing close, just out of reach.</p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, smiling without opening her eyes.</p><p>“I trust you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know where that came from. They have never spoken until today but it felt so right to say. So right to feel.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. But Rio could <em>feel</em> the hesitation, thick in the air between them. Like Agatha was standing on the edge of a cliff, unsure if she should jump.</p><p>Then—the faintest touch.</p><p>Fingertips brushed Rio’s shoulders like a question.</p><p>Rio didn’t move, didn’t flinch. She stayed still, and closed her eyes again.</p><p>Agatha's hands settled, finally—one on each shoulder. Light, like they might vanish again at any second.</p><p>Only then did they begin to move.</p><p>Agatha stepped forward.</p><p>Her hands gave the tiniest nudge, and Rio followed, blind but calm. She let herself be led, one foot after another, the world quiet except for the shuffle of their steps and the hum of nerves under her skin.</p><p>Agatha guided her around something—maybe a chair? Rio wasn’t sure. She felt the soft pressure of one hand lifting slightly, and she turned left. It was clumsy, a little offbeat, but Agatha adjusted immediately, steadying her with nothing but the curve of her palms.</p><p>And through it all—not a word.</p><p>But it didn’t feel cold. It felt like a secret. Like something important was being said in silence.</p><p>Rio smiled faintly.</p><p>“You’re doing good,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, but her hands got just a little more confident after that.</p><p>By the time they stopped, Rio’s pulse had slowed. She felt grounded. Held. She didn’t open her eyes right away—she just stood there, letting Agatha’s presence wrap around her like warmth from a fire she hadn’t realized she needed.</p><p>And Agatha?</p><p>She let go so gently it was like she was still there.</p><p>Wanda clapped her hands. “That was majestic! You all did a fantastic job.”</p><p>Rio smiled as she looked at Agatha—who felt tense but light at the same time.</p><p>“Now it’s time to switch. Who was guiding now will be guided and who was being guided will now guide.”</p><p>Agatha froze. Rio could see that she wasn’t even breathing normally anymore.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha?” she asked with a worried look.</p><p>Agatha was keeping her eyes buried on the floor.</p><p>Rio didn’t want to cross any boundaries. She didn’t touch her.</p><p>But she took one small step closer, enough for her voice to reach softer.</p><p>“You don’t have to do anything you’re not ready for. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Her shoulders were stiff, hands clenched loosely by her sides. Still staring at the floor like it might open up and swallow her whole.</p><p>Wanda’s voice floated again, light and encouraging.</p><p>“Take your time. Remember, this isn’t about doing it right, it’s about it’s about feeling safe.”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha, really looked. And for just a second, she saw past the face Agatha always wore like armor.</p><p>She was scared.</p><p>So Rio took a breath.</p><p>“You’re safe. I promise.”</p><p>That made Agatha’s head lift a little—just a flicker. A glance that barely touched Rio’s face, but it was enough.</p><p>“I thought I was safe once,” she whispered but Rio almost couldn’t hear it.</p><p>That made Rio’s body freeze.</p><p>“It’s okay. We can just stay here without doing anything, yeah?” Rio smiled to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha sniffed and nodded slowly.</p><p>They stayed like that until the exercise ended. No steps taken. No dance begun.</p><p>But Rio knew something had shifted.</p><p>Not forward, maybe. But inward.</p><p>And that was something.</p><p>After the other pairs were done with the activity, Wanda spoke.</p><p>“That’s it for today! I hope you enjoyed this activity. If you did, next session will also be in pairs—but we’ll start to go a little deeper… always respecting everyone’s boundaries, of course.”</p><p>Agatha was already slipping out the door when Rio moved—instinct, maybe. Or hope.</p><p>“Agatha!” she called, just loud enough to stop her.</p><p>Agatha turned around.</p><p>Rio didn’t rush. She just smiled—small, sincere. “I liked being paired with you.”</p><p>For a beat, Agatha said nothing.</p><p>And then—she smiled.</p><p>Not wide. Not showy. But real. Soft around the edges, like something thawing.</p><p>“I had fun today,” she said. “More than I’ve had in years.”</p><p>Then she turned and walked away, the door clicking gently shut behind her.</p><p>Rio stood there for a moment longer.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Holding that smile like a fragile secret in her chest.</p><p>And for the first time in those two weeks, there was presence where there used to be silence.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio didn’t work—not because she was lazy, but because she didn’t have to. Her parents had left her more than enough. Her mom, a respected doctor. Her dad, a high-powered lawyer. What a combo, right?</p><p>Her mom was the first to go. She got sick—first a stroke landed her in the hospital. Just when it seemed she might get better, a hospital infection took her away.</p><p>That shattered their family, especially her dad. A year later, he couldn’t carry the weight anymore and took his own life.</p><p>Rio was 20 when everything happened.</p><p>Since then, time had stretched itself into something shapeless. Some days she’d wake up and it felt like years had passed. Others, like none at all.</p><p>She had the money. The house. The silence. Everything that looked like safety—until you lived inside it.</p><p>Grief doesn’t care how big the bed is.</p><p>Most days, Rio lived small. Quiet routines. Morning coffee. Long walks. Watering plants she didn’t remember buying.</p><p>The world outside moved fast. She didn’t.</p><p>People asked if she worked, and she never quite knew how to answer.</p><p>“No,” she’d say, politely. “I’m not working right now.”</p><p>And that was the truth. Just not all of it.</p><p>Rio has a friend—Alice, who was there for her since they both were 18. When her parents died, Alice and her family were really supportive. They invited Rio to live with them for as long as she needed but Rio politely declined the offer—she needed time for herself.</p><p>What hurt her the most was that her dad seemed to have gotten over her mom’s passing. Everything seemed fine. He seemed fine.</p><p>For a while, Rio was angry at him.</p><p>She thought he had moved on too quickly. He laughed at jokes again. He went back to work. He made breakfast like nothing had changed.</p><p>She wanted to scream at him. <em>How are you fine? How are you not destroyed?</em></p><p>But grief has its tricks. It wears different masks.</p><p>He wasn’t fine. He was just quiet about it. And by the time Rio realized that, it was already too late.</p><p>She stopped trying to make sense of it after a while.</p><p>Grief doesn’t follow logic. Neither did healing.</p><p>That was then.</p><p>Now?</p><p>She was just trying to feel something again.</p><p>When Rio was finally ready to be in a relationship—which was two years later her parents death—she got into a toxic one. She didn’t know it was toxic at first. Of course not. It didn’t look like toxicity. It looked like Elena—sharp smile, fast talk, the kind of presence that made you feel like the world had been boring until she walked in.</p><p>They met at a bookstore event. Elena was standing at the back, leaning against a shelf like the whole place was her living room. She made some sarcastic comment about the author’s metaphors, and Rio laughed—the only one who did. That was the beginning.</p><p>Elena was everything Rio wasn’t. Loud. Reckless. Charming in the way that made waitresses blush and strangers overshare. She’d drag Rio into late-night drives, into spontaneous plans, into rooms full of people and noise. For a while, it felt good. Like living again. Like being shaken awake from grief’s long, dull sleep.</p><p>But then it started.</p><p>Little things, at first.</p><p>Elena never seemed to have her wallet. She’d laugh it off—“God, I’m the worst, can you get this one?” She’d borrow Rio’s car because hers “was in the shop,” but it always seemed to be in the shop. She said things like “You’re so lucky you don’t have to worry about money,” with a soft bitterness that made Rio feel guilty for every comfort she’d inherited.</p><p>Eventually, Elena stopped asking. She just expected. Groceries. Rent. A new phone. “It’s not a big deal, babe—you’re not even gonna feel it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t care about the money. That wasn’t the point.</p><p>It was how Elena made her feel when she gave. Like she was only worth loving if she was useful. Like she was lucky someone as bright as Elena even chose her.</p><p>And then came the control.</p><p>Subtle, at first. She’d make fun of Rio’s clothes. Say her music taste was boring. Roll her eyes every time Alice texted. She once said, “I don’t know why you still talk to her so much. You act like she’s your girlfriend.” It was half-joke, half-accusation. And it stuck.</p><p>Rio started pulling back. From Alice. From everyone. She thought maybe that’s what being in love meant—choosing one person so fully that the rest of the world faded.</p><p>But love wasn’t supposed to feel like erasing yourself.</p><p>By the end, Rio barely recognized her own routines. She stopped listening to her dad’s old records. Stopped watering her plants. Stopped laughing. Elena filled the space in her house and hollowed it out at the same time.</p><p>She didn’t leave because of one big fight. There wasn’t yelling. Just a slow erosion.</p><p>One night, Elena left to “grab drinks with a friend,” and Rio sat alone in the quiet. For the first time in a long time, she let the stillness settle instead of chasing it away. She put on a record. Ella Fitzgerald.</p><p>And something broke.</p><p>Not loud. Not dramatic. Just a quiet realization that she didn’t want this kind of love. Not anymore.</p><p>Rio wrote a letter. Short. Not angry. Just done.</p><p>She left it on the kitchen table. Changed the locks. Blocked the number. Called Alice the next morning and asked if she could come over.</p><p>Alice just said, “I’m already making coffee.”</p><p>It took months to feel like herself again—if she ever really did. But slowly, she rebuilt. Not everything. Just the small things. Like Wednesday lunch with Alice.</p><p>Wednesdays were her favorite. Not because of the day, but because they meant two hours with someone who made her feel like a person again.</p><p>Alice ran the most talked-about tattoo shop in town, and her schedule was usually packed—appointments lined up weeks in advance. But every Wednesday, from noon to two, was reserved just for them. No exceptions.</p><p>Each week, one of them chose where to go. Last Wednesday, it was KFC, because Alice had been craving fried chicken like it was a lifeline. True craving, no shame.</p><p>This week, the plan was different. They were meeting at Ça va, a “new” French bistro that had opened just three weeks ago.</p><p>Rio was already inside, waiting, wrapped in a soft sage-green sweater and flared jeans—feeling the chill of the day seep in from outside. Her thoughts drifted, as they often did lately, to Agatha—the woman who hadn’t left her mind since their session the day before.</p><p>She was the first person besides Wanda that Agatha had spoken to in therapy—at least since she’d started it.</p><p>Technically, they have only spoken to each other because of the pairing thing but that meant something to Rio and it meant something for Agatha too.</p><p>The bell above the door chimed, snapping her out of the thoughts.</p><p>Alice breezed in, all bold eyeliner and windblown hair, her leather jacket half zipped and cheeks pink from the cold. She spotted Rio and lit up instantly.</p><p>“Hey, RiRi,” she said, heading straight to the table. “Sorry I’m late. A guy wanted a phoenix rising out of a skull and his ex’s name covered up.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly. “You’re not late. I was just… thinking.”</p><p>Alice arched a brow as she shrugged off her jacket and sank into the chair across from her. “About therapy girl?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. She just looked down at her hands, then nodded. “I don’t know what it is. She barely talked. But…”</p><p>“But it’s something.” Alice finished, not teasing—just understanding. “You feel it.”</p><p>Rio nodded again. “Yes, I do.”</p><p>Alice smiled, reaching for the menu. “Alright, let’s eat something absurdly french and maybe get you a glass of wine. You look like your soul needs to warm up.”</p><p>Rio gave her a small smile. “Only if you’re having one too.”</p><p>Alice smiled. “Oh, honey. I’m two sips ahead of you in my mind already.”</p><p>They ordered quickly—Alice choosing something with goat cheese because she liked the name, and Rio picking the daily special without asking what it was.</p><p>“I’m gonna assume anything with ‘du jour’ in the name tastes good,” Alice said, leaning back as the waiter walked away.</p><p>“It just means ‘of the day,’” Rio replied, taking a sip of her wine.</p><p>“Well then. I’m a cultured woman,” Alice said, deadpan. “Next stop, Paris.”</p><p>The conversation shifted to random topics—someone from high school who got married in Vegas, a terrible tattoo trend Alice hoped never came back, whether or not Ça va was worth a second visit.</p><p>By the time they left, Rio felt steadier. Not fixed. But less tangled.</p><p>Outside, the cold bit at their faces. Alice lit a cigarette and offered Rio one, knowing she’d say no.</p><p>“You okay?” she asked again, eyes on the street.</p><p>Rio pulled her sweater sleeves down over her hands. “Getting there.”</p><p>“Good. Just… don’t disappear into someone else’s mess, okay?”</p><p>Rio looked at her. “I won’t.”</p><p>Alice nodded. “Alright. Same time next week?”</p><p>“Always.”</p><p>They parted at the corner, Alice disappearing into the blur of traffic and chill, Rio standing for a moment longer, hands deep in her pockets, thinking about a woman with too many walls and eyes full of weight.</p><p>And then she started walking.</p><p>Rio was on her way to the grocery store. Just a few things—milk, fruit, something for dinner. Since she was already out, she figured she might as well get it over with.</p><p>She was a block away when she saw someone up ahead—familiar shape, familiar stillness.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Dark gray sweater, black beanie pulled low, cigarette in one hand and grocery bags in the other. Her head was slightly down. She moved quickly, like she didn’t want to be noticed. Maybe she didn’t.</p><p>Rio barely caught a glimpse of her face before she turned the corner.</p><p>There wasn’t time to wave. Not even time to decide if she should.</p><p>And just like that, Agatha was gone again.</p><p>After buying everything she needed—and some unnecessary stuff as well, Rio went back home.</p><p>Home was quiet, as always.</p><p>Rio dropped her keys in the bowl by the door, kicked her shoes off without looking. The grocery bags ended up on the kitchen counter, untouched. She’d deal with them later.</p><p>She walked straight to the living room and sat down on the couch—not collapsed, not curled up, just… sat.</p><p>The silence wasn’t heavy. But it wasn’t light either.</p><p>She leaned her head back, eyes on the ceiling. Not thinking, but also not not-thinking.</p><p>Recently, Rio had been remembering her parents too much.</p><p>She remembered one night, a week after her mom’s passing, waking up to find the kitchen light on. Her dad was standing by the sink, eating cold lasagna straight from the dish. “Didn’t feel like using a plate,” he’d said, not looking at her. And she hadn’t asked anything else. Just stood there with him for a moment. Two ghosts in the same house.</p><p>She also remembered that every morning, no matter how rushed, her mom took five minutes to sit with a cup of tea by the window, watching the world wake up. Rio wished she could’ve been brave enough to ask what she was thinking about in those moments.</p><p>Rio accepted the fact that those memories—good or bad will always come back. And that’s okay.</p><p>A new day had finally begun, and there was Rio—back at the studio.</p><p>She’d arrived earlier than usual, just in case.</p><p>
<em>(Just in case Agatha did too.)</em>
</p><p>When she walked in, the space was quiet, almost too quiet. Wanda stood by the mirror wall, sipping tea from a thermos and adjusting a speaker. Something about the silence made it feel heavier than Tuesday.</p><p>“You’re early!” Wanda called out, smiling. Then paused. Narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“You’re early?”</p><p>The second time wasn’t a greeting. It was a diagnosis.</p><p>Rio gave a sheepish nod. “Yup. Here I am.”</p><p>Wanda leaned back against the mirror. “Everything okay?”</p><p>“Uhum,” Rio said too fast, then cleared her throat. “Just… waiting.”</p><p>“For what?”</p><p>Rio shrugged like a teenager caught snooping in a kitchen drawer. “Nothing. Really.”</p><p>Wanda gave her a long, quiet look. Then let it go with a soft smile. “Alright. You don’t have to tell me now. But if you ever want to… I’m right here.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio whispered.</p><p>She slipped into her usual corner—she liked corners. Something about them made her feel held. Like she could pretend the rest of the room didn’t exist.</p><p>A few minutes later, Jacob and Benjamin arrived, laughing about something dumb and hand-gesture-filled. They greeted Wanda, threw Rio a wave. Then came Rose, headphones in, thumbs flying over her screen. She didn’t look up, but gave Rio a faint nod. That counted.</p><p>Rio was, of course, the oldest in the group. Older than Wanda, even. And sometimes that felt like armor. Other times, like glass.</p><p>Then Beatrice came in.</p><p>Still no Agatha.</p><p>Wanda stepped into the center of the room and clapped once. Her lips parted to speak—</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>Agatha walked in.</p><p>She looked… the same. But she wasn’t. Not really.</p><p>It was in the way she stood—shoulders drawn up tight, jaw clenched, hands balled into fists at her sides. Like her body was bracing for impact. Like showing up had cost her something.</p><p>She didn’t look around the room. She didn’t need to.</p><p>Rio felt it the moment their eyes met.</p><p>She didn’t want to be here.</p><p>But she was.</p><p>Agatha sat on the floor, away from everyone else. Not dramatically far. But far enough.</p><p>“Hello, Agatha!” Wanda chirped.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Just gave a single nod. That was all she had today.</p><p>Wanda offered a smile in return. Then turned to the group.</p><p>“Today we’re working with pairs again!” she said, more excited than anyone else in the room. “Like I mentioned on Tuesday, today’s activity will go deeper. It’s not about movement, it’s about what’s under the movement.”</p><p>She walked slowly through the space as she spoke.</p><p>“You’re welcome to change partners, but I encourage you to stay with the same person. You’ve already built a bridge.”</p><p>Everyone nodded or murmured some version of agreement—except Rio and Agatha. Neither of them said a word. But neither moved away, either.</p><p>Rio took a slow breath, walked toward Agatha, and sat down beside her. Careful. Close, but not crowding.</p><p>Wanda returned to the center.</p><p>“Today’s exercise is called ‘This Is Where I Hurt.’” Her voice softened. “It requires three things: willingness to be vulnerable, trust, and readiness to witness someone else’s pain without trying to fix it.”</p><p>Rio heard a sharp breath from beside her. She looked.</p><p>Agatha was clenching her jaw again.</p><p>“Start by closing your eyes,” Wanda said. “Scan your body gently. Ask: Where do I carry pain? It might not be pain you talk about. It might not even have words. But your body remembers.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes. And instantly, she knew.</p><p>Her hand drifted to her lower belly, where the grief sat. Not sharp. Just… weight. Where everything she’d ever swallowed seemed to pool. Years of waiting for things to get better. Of being tired. Of being alone. Of pretending she wasn’t.</p><p>Beside her, Agatha stayed stiff for a long time. But then, slowly, one hand lifted and pressed flat to her throat.</p><p>Rio didn’t look directly at her. But she saw enough.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers were trembling.</p><p>Wanda spoke again. “Place your hand on that place. Breathe into it. Say it to yourself. This is where I hurt.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say it out loud. But she felt it echo inside her:</p><p>This is where I hurt.</p><p>This is where I was left alone.</p><p>This is where I became small so I could survive.</p><p>Wanda continued, softer now: “Begin to move from that place. Let it lead. There’s no right or wrong. Just truth.”</p><p>Rio folded slightly forward, hand pressing into her belly, spine curling. Her breath came deeper, more ragged. She let the ache guide her body like tidewater—surging, pulling, collapsing.</p><p>Beside her, Agatha didn’t move at first.</p><p>Then she did.</p><p>Her hand stayed at her throat, but her other arm extended outward. Her shoulders tensed, then shook—like she was reaching for something and flinching away from it at the same time. Her chest rose in sharp, shallow breaths, but no sound came out. Like her body was screaming inside glass.</p><p>Rio turned toward her slowly.</p><p>She didn’t touch her. Not yet.</p><p>But she opened her palm, placed it gently on the floor between them—an invitation. Nothing more.</p><p>Agatha saw it.</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>Then she moved her own hand—shaking slightly—and rested it on top of Rio’s.</p><p>Neither of them looked at the other. They didn’t need to.</p><p>They moved together now. Carefully. Silently. Agatha’s shoulders dropped a fraction. Her arm folded inward. Rio shifted, curving her body around the ache in her stomach, but keeping their hands linked between them.</p><p>It was slow. Unspoken. Sacred.</p><p>Wanda didn’t say anything. She didn’t need to. The music faded. The room held them.</p><p>“Take a moment to close,” Wanda eventually whispered. “You’ve done something brave.”</p><p>Rio felt the tremor in Agatha’s hand even as it stayed pressed to her own.</p><p>She gave it the tiniest squeeze.</p><p>The session ended, but neither of them moved.</p><p>The music faded. Wanda’s voice softened to a hush, thanking everyone, inviting them to breathe, to stretch, to take care of themselves.</p><p>Rio didn’t hear much of it.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand leave hers—slowly, with intention. No flinch. No rush. Just a withdrawal, like someone carefully unthreading herself from a trap.</p><p>And then she stood up and walked out.</p><p>Not a glance. Not a goodbye.</p><p>Just gone.</p><p>Rio waited five seconds. Then followed.</p><p>Out in the hallway, the air was colder. The lights too bright. Her footsteps echoed.</p><p>She didn’t see Agatha right away, but then she caught movement at the far end—by the stairwell door.</p><p>Rio didn’t call out.</p><p>She just walked. Quiet steps.</p><p>When she pushed the door open, Agatha was sitting on the landing, back against the wall, knees drawn up, arms wrapped around them. Not crying. Just sitting there. Rigid.</p><p>Like she didn’t know what to do next.</p><p>Rio hovered in the doorway.</p><p>“I wasn’t sure if you wanted space,” she said. Her voice was low, steady. No softness, no performance. Just words.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. “Then why’d you come?”</p><p>Rio leaned against the frame. “Didn’t feel right to leave.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Rio waited.</p><p>Agatha finally said, “I didn’t plan to do that. The thing with your hand.”</p><p>Rio let out the tiniest breath. “I know.”</p><p>More silence.</p><p>Agatha shifted slightly, resting her head back against the wall. She still wouldn’t look at her. “It felt… awful. And not awful. I don’t know.”</p><p>“That tracks,” Rio said. No attempt to soothe. Just agreement. “It was weird for me too.”</p><p>A pause. Agatha’s fingers tightened around her knees.</p><p>“I didn’t want to come today,” she said. The words were flat. Not confessional—just a fact.</p><p>“I know,” Rio said again. “You showed it.”</p><p>This time, Agatha did look up. Just barely. Her eyes were tired, red at the edges. Not from crying. From holding everything in.</p><p>Rio met her gaze and held it.</p><p>She didn’t step closer. Didn’t sit. Just stayed there—present, not invasive.</p><p>After a beat, Agatha said, “Don’t make this a thing.”</p><p>Rio’s lip twitched. Not quite a smile. “Too late.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw worked, but she didn’t answer.</p><p>Rio turned to leave. Not in anger—just giving her the out she clearly wanted.</p><p>But before she pushed the door open, she said, “You were brave. Even if it was just for a few minutes.”</p><p>And then—nothing but the click of the door behind her.</p><p>But the feeling stayed.</p><p>Soft and heavy in her chest.</p><p>
<em>This is where I hurt.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe… this is where I start to heal.</em>

<p>“Rio, come onnnnn, it’s Friday!”</p><p>Alice was practically kneeling on the floor like this was a matter of national urgency.</p><p>Rio fought hard not to laugh. “Get up, Al.”</p><p>Alice flopped over dramatically, arms out like a fainting princess. “Not unless you promise to come.”</p><p>Rio rubbed her temple. “I’m not even showered yet.”</p><p>Alice sprang up like a cat. “I’ll wait. Go on.”</p><p>“Nooo,” Rio groaned, already regretting ever unlocking the front door.</p><p>“Please?” Alice whined, eyes sparkling with mischief.</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, feigning resistance. “Where exactly are we going?”</p><p>Alice tried—and failed—to hide her excitement. “Bar.”</p><p>Rio just stared.</p><p>“C’mon,” Alice pleaded, giving her the most irresistible puppy eyes in existence.</p><p>Rio sighed, defeated. “Fine.”</p><p>Alice shot up, practically bouncing. “YES!” She started pushing Rio gently toward the stairs. “Go shower. I’ll wait down here.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but didn’t argue. “Right.”</p><p>Thirty minutes later, she finally came downstairs.</p><p>“Oh. My. God.” Alice’s eyes widened as she took in the sight. “I think you’re the hottest person in the world.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I think so too.”</p><p>She wore a short red dress—tight and sleeveless, hugging every curve, bold without begging for attention. The hem stopped high on her thighs, just daring enough. Her hair was down, tousled in that effortless, just-rolled-out-of-bed-but-still-stunning kind of way. Silver hoops glinted at her ears, lips painted a daring shade of red. Her heels clicked with quiet confidence.</p><p>Alice blinked. “Totally worth the wait.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes again. “Let’s go before I start regretting this.”</p><p>Alice grinned, looping an arm around her shoulders. “With that dress? There’s no way you’re regretting anything tonight.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly. “Al, I’m not looking for a one-night stand.”</p><p>“Alright, Riri,” Alice said, hands up in surrender. “Just saying.”</p><p>The bar was packed. Music thumped under the hum of laughter and clinking glasses, and someone was already butchering a karaoke song with full drunken commitment. But Alice, of course, had a table waiting—tucked in a cozy corner, away from the crowd. She knew Rio liked the edges.</p><p>Alice touched Rio’s forearm. “Go grab us some drinks. I’ll hold the fort.”</p><p>Rio nodded and slipped through the crowd toward the bar.</p><p>When she reached the counter, she leaned over and called out, “Two strong ones, please.”</p><p>The bartender looked up, flashing a knowing grin. “You Alice’s friend?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>He grabbed two glasses filled with something glowing amber and set them down.</p><p>Rio blinked. “What is this?”</p><p>He smirked. “Alice told me to make something strong.”</p><p>“Oh,” she cleared her throat. “Well… thank you.”</p><p>“On the house,” he added with a wink.</p><p>Rio smiled politely, picked up the drinks, and made her way back to the table.</p><p>Alice looked up as she arrived. “Perfect timing.”</p><p>Rio set the glasses down and asked, “How strong is this?”</p><p>Alice took a big sip—then immediately winced.</p><p>Rio didn’t need an answer. She laughed. “Got it.”</p><p>“Damn,” Alice said, staring at the drink like it had personally insulted her. “This thing is intense.”</p><p>Rio took a cautious sip—then instantly coughed, hard. “What the fuck.”</p><p>Alice burst out laughing. “Marco knows how to make a cocktail.”</p><p>Rio was still recovering, fanning herself lightly. “He sure does.”</p><p>Rio took another simp of her drink , this time prepared for the burn that almost killed her.</p><p>Across from her, Alice was talking about something. Probably someone from the tattoo shop or her crazy life experiences but Rio’s attention started to drift.</p><p>The music felt louder now. The crowd heavier. Bodies moving, laughing, clinking glasses.</p><p>Then, like a static charge in the air, Rio felt something before she even saw it.</p><p>Her gaze landed on the back corner of the bar—and froze.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Same pulled-back hair. Same careful posture. But something was off.</p><p>She sat right next to a woman who looked like she walked out of a magazine ad—long legs, high gloss, and a laugh that sparkled a little too loud.</p><p>But it wasn’t the laugh Rio focused on. It was the hands.</p><p>A lingering touch to Agatha’s thigh. Fingers brushing her wrist, staying just a second too long. A lean-in that felt rehearsed, performative—too close, too loud, too much.</p><p>And Agatha? She wasn’t pulling away. But she wasn’t present either.</p><p>Her smile didn’t reach her eyes. Her shoulders were high, her body still, like someone trying not to breathe too loud.</p><p>Rio’s hand tightened around her glass.</p><p>She told herself to stay put.</p><p>Maybe it was fine. Maybe she was overreading it. Maybe Agatha didn’t want her involved.</p><p>But the look on Agatha’s face—like she was quietly leaving her body just to endure the moment—burned right through her.</p><p>Rio stood up.</p><p>Alice looked confused but didn’t say anything. She just watched Rio walk away.</p><p>She walks until she was at Agatha’s table.</p><p>Both of them, Agatha and the woman, looked at her.</p><p>“I think it’s time for you to leave.”</p><p>The woman laughs nervously. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Rio tilts her head, still calm.</p><p>“You heard me. She’s not enjoying this. You know that.”</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>“So I’ll ask again. Leave.”</p><p>The woman stares at Agatha for backup. Agatha doesn’t look at her. She just shifts slightly toward Rio. That’s all.</p><p>The woman stiffens. “Are you her girlfriend or something?”</p><p>Rio gave the woman a small smile. “No. I’m the reason this ends here.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The woman huffs, grabs her bag, and mutters something under her breath—maybe “psycho”—before brushing past Rio on her way out.</p><p>Rio watches her leave. Then slowly turns to Agatha.</p><p>“You okay?” she asked Agatha.</p><p>Agatha nods once. Her voice low. “I didn’t know how to get out.”</p><p>“I'm sorry for intruding. It just seemed like you needed an escape hatch.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio. “I did.”</p><p>Pause.</p><p>“Thanks for being it.”</p><p>Rio smiled to Agatha.</p><p>“Do you want to join us?” Rio pointed at the table she was.</p><p>“Us?” Agatha asked confused.</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. Me and my friend Alice.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands. “I don’t want to interrupt.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said with a more serious but soft tone.</p><p>Agatha looked at her, deeply in the eyes.</p><p>“I wouldn’t invite you to our table if I—if we didn’t want you there.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then nodded slowly. She stood up, clutching her purse a little tighter, and followed Rio through the crowd. The noise seemed to dim around them, like they’d slipped into a bubble of quiet.</p><p>Alice waved from their table, grinning like she’d been waiting forever. “Hey, stranger. You made it.”</p><p>Agatha gave a small, almost shy smile. Rio caught it and felt her heart soften.</p><p>As they settled, Alice slid a glass toward Agatha. “Something to drink?”</p><p>Agatha glanced at the glass, then at Rio, and finally relaxed just a little. “Thanks.”</p><p>The three of them fell into an easy rhythm—Alice talking about a wild tattoo client story, Rio laughing softly, and Agatha listening more than speaking, but inching closer with every smile and quiet comment.</p><p>At one point, Rio caught Agatha’s eye and gave a subtle nod, like an unspoken promise: no pressure, no rush, just here.</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders loosened.</p><p>Maybe, this was a place she could start to breathe again.</p><p>An hour later, Alice went home after she started crying because she forgot to feed her cat so there were only the two of them at the table. Rio didn’t want to go home yet so she stayed.</p><p>The bar was less crowded—which neither of them complained about.</p><p>“Your friend is very nice.” Agatha said to Rio.</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yes. She is the best.”</p><p>She paused.</p><p>“I’m glad you liked her too.”</p><p>Agatha took a sip of her drink. “Is there anyone who doesn’t like her?”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Touché.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled.</p><p>That chuckle was the cutest thing Rio has ever heard and she knew she could spend the rest of her life listening to that sound.</p><p>Agatha yawned. “Sorry.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Are you tired?”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly. “A bit.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her purse. “Do you want to go home? I can walk you to your car.”</p><p>“How are you getting home?” Agatha asked Rio.</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I'll get a cab or something. Don’t worry.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio, giving her an assertive look. “I will drive you home.”</p><p>Rio gave Agatha a small smile. “Well, in that case, thank you.”</p><p>The walk to the car was pretty quiet. It was short but it also felt so long with all the thoughts in Rio’s head.</p><p>When they got to the car, Agatha opened the door for Rio and she could clearly tell that Agatha was nervous.</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio smiled as she sat on the car seat.</p><p>Agatha gave her a small nod, close the door for her and went to the driver's seat side.</p><p>Rio gave Agatha her address and the ride was quiet. No one said a word. For a long time.</p><p>“What happened in there?” Rio broke the silence.</p><p>“What you mean?” Agatha asked without talking her eyes off the road.</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha’s side profile. “With that woman at the bar.”</p><p>Agatha gulped. “Oh.”</p><p>They stopped at a red light.</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.” Rio said warmly to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn her face to look at Rio. That was until the lights were green again,</p><p>“She…seemed nice.” Agatha started. “But then—all of sudden, she started to touch me.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. Not yet. She waited for Agatha’s timing.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were still firm on the road. “She touched my thigh.”</p><p>She paused. “She touched my thigh and I didn’t do anything about it.” Agatha’s voice was almost like a whisper. “She seemed nice.”</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio didn’t even know what to say. “You couldn’t have known.”</p><p>Agatha’s grip on the steering wheel tightened. “That’s the problem, I never know.”</p><p>The rest of the ride was quiet. Rio could see—actually, she could feel that Agatha was feeling guilty for that silence even though Rio knew that wasn’t true at all.</p><p>When they got to Rio’s house, she unbuckled her seatbelt and looked at Agatha. “Thank you for the ride home.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “My pleasure.”</p><p>There was a short pause.</p><p>“Thank you for helping me with that woman. I owe you.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “You don’t own me anything. Yeah? I did that because I wanted to.”</p><p>Agatha gave Rio a small smile and nodded slowly.</p><p>They just stared at each other for a while until Rio came back to reality.</p><p>“I should go.” she said opening the car door. “See you Tuesday?”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>Rio left the car and when she was about to close the door, Agatha called her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha called softly.</p><p>She paused, half-out the door, and looked back.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly on the steering wheel. “I don’t usually have someone show up for me like that.”</p><p>Rio's heart pulled in her chest.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was quiet, but certain. “But I think… if it’s you, I could get used to it.”</p><p>For a moment, they just looked at each other — two hearts tiptoeing closer, no rush, no pressure.</p><p>Rio smiled, something tender blooming behind her eyes. “Then I’ll keep showing up.”</p><p>She closed the door gently, and Agatha sat there for a second longer, breathing in that promise like air.</p>

<p>Tuesday came too fast.</p><p>Rio stood in front of the studio door, heart thudding louder than it should’ve.</p><p>Not from nerves. Not exactly.</p><p>Just… wondering if Agatha would be there.</p><p>If she’d look at her.</p><p>If she’d say anything about what happened in the car.</p><p>When she got in, Rio greeted Wanda. Agatha was there on her phone, but she immediately looked up at her.</p><p>She couldn’t quite read Agatha’s face. But then Agatha nodded toward the seat next to hers.</p><p>Rio walked over to her.</p><p>“Hey, you.” Rio smiled.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said warmly.</p><p>Rio didn’t sit right away. She waited—</p><p>Agatha patted the seat beside her. That was all the confirmation Rio needed.</p><p>She sat down and looked at her. “How was your weekend?”</p><p>Agatha glanced at the floor. “Other than what happened at the bar… it was fine.”</p><p>“About that,” Rio said softly. “How are you holding up?”</p><p>Agatha looked her in the eyes. “It’s going. I’ll get over it.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “If you need anything… I’m right here.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha smiled, gentle and grateful.</p><p>“So,” Wanda began, stepping into the center of the room. “Today’s dynamic is called The Room I Left Behind.”</p><p>“In this exercise, we won’t meet a person—we’ll enter a space. One that shaped you. Maybe it sheltered you. Maybe it didn’t. It can be real or imagined. What matters is how your body remembers being inside it.”</p><p>She paused.</p><p>“I want you to find a place where you can move freely. Somewhere just yours. Close your eyes if that feels safe. And now… step into the memory of a room. One that left a mark. Maybe your childhood bedroom. A hospital hallway. An empty studio. Look around in your mind—what’s there? What’s not?”</p><p>Her voice softened, like a hand on the shoulder.</p><p>“Don’t force it. Just let the room appear.”</p><p>Rio backed into a quiet corner of the studio, near the mirror wall. She let her eyes fall closed.</p><p>At first—nothing.</p><p>But then—</p><p>There it was.</p><p>Small. Damp.</p><p>A concrete floor once painted blue, now dulled to gray from wear.</p><p>Stacks of boxes in the corners. A thin mattress laid flat with no frame.</p><p>A single window, high and barred.</p><p>She hadn’t seen that room in years.</p><p>The storage space her family had turned into a bedroom during the worst of it.</p><p>Cold air seemed to touch her skin even now, the memory sharp as glass.</p><p>She was maybe fourteen. Curled up on that mattress with headphones on, trying to disappear.</p><p>Rio took a shaky breath. Her body was already changing—shoulders drawing inward, arms held tight to her sides.</p><p>Her movements weren’t graceful. They weren’t supposed to be.</p><p>She crouched. Sat. Reached for an invisible corner.</p><p>She could almost feel the plastic crate she used as a nightstand—the one that held three books, a broken CD player, and a stuffed animal missing one eye.</p><p>A room where she stopped asking for anything.</p><p>A room where she started surviving.</p><p>“Let your body remember how you existed there,” Wanda’s voice came. “Let the space speak to you.”</p><p>Rio shifted to one side, her palms pressing to the floor like it still held the cold. Her eyes squeezed shut tighter. She curled slightly, as if the ceiling were too low.</p><p>She felt the ache rise—not just sorrow, but the dull pride of having made it through.</p><p>Her hands moved slowly, as if folding something—clothes? Memories?</p><p>No. A piece of herself.</p><p>Next to her, she caught a glimpse of Agatha.</p><p>Still. Intent. One arm wrapped across her torso like a shield, the other reaching forward—toward something unseen.</p><p>Their eyes met briefly.</p><p>But the moment passed.</p><p>Because Rio saw something in the corner of the imagined room.</p><p>Something she hadn’t noticed before.</p><p>A box of dance shoes. Her old ones. Torn at the seams.</p><p>Left behind when she stopped trying to audition. When she stopped moving for herself.</p><p>She crawled toward the box.</p><p>And with trembling hands, she picked it up.</p><p>Heavy. Not with weight—but with memory.</p><p>“When you’re ready,” Wanda’s voice said, “leave the room. But not empty. Leave with what you need to carry forward.”</p><p>Rio stood.</p><p>Not fast. Not fluid. Just… steady.</p><p>She held the invisible box to her chest.</p><p>Not everything in that room deserved to stay there.</p><p>But this—this, she would take with her.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, she wasn’t the only one crying.</p><p>Agatha stood a few steps away, arms at her sides now, eyes wet. Her breath shallow.</p><p>They didn’t speak.</p><p>They didn’t have to.</p><p>They had both just walked out of the rooms they left behind.</p><p>And now… they stood in this one. Together.</p><p>Wanda gave the group a few more moments of silence before speaking.</p><p>“That’s all for today,” she said gently. “Please take care of yourselves this evening. And remember—sometimes showing up for yourself is the bravest thing you can do.”</p><p>Chairs creaked as people began to move. Someone wiped their face. Someone else let out a long exhale, like they’d been holding it the whole time.</p><p>Rio sat still for a moment longer, grounding herself.</p><p>Agatha was doing the same.</p><p>Eventually, they both stood—almost at the exact same time.</p><p>No rush. No words. Just two people collecting themselves.</p><p>And somehow, without needing to say anything, they walked side by side down the hallway toward the exit.</p><p>The air outside was soft with the fading light of early evening.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said quietly.</p><p>Agatha looked over.</p><p>“I saw you,” Rio said. “In there.”</p><p>Agatha blinked once. Lips pressed together like she was weighing her words. Then: “I saw you too.”</p><p>A pause. Not uncomfortable—just full.</p><p>“Do you want to walk a little?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Rio smiled softly. “Yeah. I’d like that.”</p><p>They walked in silence. Not awkward—just… peaceful. That kind of quiet where your head is full but you don’t want to ruin the calm.</p><p>Rio glanced sideways. “You were really still today. During the exercise.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>“I didn’t know what to say. Or if I even wanted to.” She paused. “But I didn’t want to pretend either.”</p><p>“That’s fair.” Rio kept her pace slow. “I think just staying with it counts.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her. “You always say things like that. Like you’re not in a hurry for anything.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Rio said simply.</p><p>They passed a bakery just as it was closing. The warm smell of bread hung in the air. A cat darted across the sidewalk ahead.</p><p>“Still thinking about the bar?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Sometimes. Not as much as before.” Agatha looked ahead. “It’s weird how something can feel over but still stick to you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. She just walked beside her, present.</p><p>“I meant what I said,” she added. “If you need anything.”</p><p>“I know.” Agatha’s voice was quiet—but sure.</p><p>At the corner where they’d split, they both stopped.</p><p>“I’m gonna walk a bit more,” Agatha said, adjusting her bag.</p><p>Rio nodded. “Alright.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“Thanks again. For today. For… that night.”</p><p>Rio gave a small nod. “No problem.”</p><p>Agatha held her gaze a moment longer. Then turned and walked away.</p><p>Rio watched her go.</p><p>She didn’t feel the need to say anything else.</p><p>Some things didn’t need to be wrapped up neatly.</p><p>They just needed space.</p><p>When Rio got home, she took a long shower—trying to calm all the thoughts in her head.</p><p>Which all led to one name.</p><p>Agatha this. Agatha that.</p><p>Always her.</p><p>She was eating cursed pizza she made herself when her phone buzzed.</p><p>
<strong>hark.agatha requested to follow you</strong>
</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. She grabbed her phone and accepted the request. Then immediately requested to follow back.</p><p>A few seconds later, Agatha accepted.</p><p>
<em>
<strong>New message from Agatha.</strong>
</em>
</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Hi Rio</em></p><p>Rio’s heart skipped. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard.</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Hey you</p><p>She smiled, imagining Agatha seeing that message.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: <em>Is it okay that I followed you?</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> More than okay. I was hoping you would</p><p>Her cheeks warmed. She tried not to sound too eager. Failed gloriously</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Oh… really?</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Yeah. I smiled when I saw your name pop up</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Good. I wasn’t sure if it would be weird</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> It’s not weird. I like weird anyway</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>So you’re saying I’m weird?</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> The best kind 😌</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I’ll take that as a compliment</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> You should</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I almost messaged you earlier but didn’t know what to say</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> You just saying hi is already kind of perfect</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Well… hi again then</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Hi again ☺️</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I hope you had a good night after you got home</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> I did. Made terrible pizza. Worth it though</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Terrible how? Like… burnt or cursed?</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Cursed. Definitely cursed. Looked like it had beef with me personally</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I wish I’d seen that 😂</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Next time, I’ll make you one. Just sign a pizza liability waiver first</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Deal</em></p><p>Pause.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>It was nice walking with you</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> It was my favorite part of the day</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Mine too</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Feels like something shifted</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Yeah. Hard to say what exactly</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> I’m not great with words sometimes</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Neither am I.</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> (a beat) I’m glad you messaged</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Me too</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Want to grab coffee sometime?</p><p>Pause.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Yeah. I’d like that</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Cool. I know a place that makes a mean black coffee. No fluff, just the way it should be</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Sounds perfect</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> I’ll text you the details later?</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Please do</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Honestly, I wasn’t sure you’d reach out. So this feels… good</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Me too. I guess sometimes the quiet ones just need a little nudge</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Yeah. Or maybe the quiet ones just want to be heard</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Maybe that’s it</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Looking forward to that coffee, then</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Same here</em></p><p>The typing dots lingered—then disappeared.</p><p>Rio stared at the screen, heart full.</p><p>Outside her window, the city lights began to flicker on, one by one.</p><p>Somewhere out there, Agatha might’ve been watching them too.</p><p>Maybe wondering what came next.</p><p>And maybe… that was enough for now.</p><p>The promise of something new, fragile but real, hanging quietly between two women who had both learned what it meant to show up for themselves.</p>

<p>Rio was trying all different ways to find herself again, and it was in that bookstore that she saw Elena for the first time.</p><p>She had a charm that Rio had never seen before — a charm that made people turn their heads just to watch her.</p><p>The book was about sex life and how to fix it. Maybe Elena saw Rio looking at her. She smirked and said loud and clear:</p><p>“Apparently, she isn’t having any.”</p><p>Rio laughed, and some people turned to look at them, not finding it funny at all.</p><p>At the end of the event, Elena asked for Rio’s number and invited her for a date.</p><p>The date started with Elena bringing two of her friends—yes, she brought her friends to a date—and Rio was there, feeling nervous and awkward.</p><p>They were basically detectives, asking her questions all the time, even though she wanted some time alone with Elena to enjoy their date.</p><p>Elena was older than Rio; she was thirty-nine. She had way more experience than Rio, and that amazed her.</p><p>They started dating after a few more dates—Elena didn’t bring her friends anymore.</p><p>It was paradise.</p><p>Elena would take Rio to parties and events—more parties, really. That made Rio feel alive again.</p><p>She would always introduce Rio as her girlfriend, which sometimes sparked jokes about their age difference and how Rio was a baby compared to Elena, but with Elena holding her hand, nothing else mattered.</p><p>After some time, Rio’s life became Elena.</p><p>Elena would give Rio the world, but Elena was Rio’s world.</p><p>Rio often felt jealous of women who hit on Elena because who was she compared to them?</p><p>They were older, smarter, prettier, and it was exactly what Elena deserved.</p><p>But always, at the end of the night, Elena showed Rio how much she liked her—and only her.</p><p>Sex with Elena was like everything else about her — intense, deliberate, and impossible to ignore.</p><p>Rio had never felt so desired, so completely claimed.</p><p>Elena knew what to do with her body like she’d studied it in a language only she could read.</p><p>In the beginning, it was addictive. Almost sacred.</p><p>Rio sometimes wondered if it was love, or just the way Elena made her feel like nothing else existed beyond that bed.</p><p>By the third month, Elena lost a lot of money gambling, something she casually admitted over dinner like it was nothing more than forgetting to do laundry.</p><p>“I’ll figure it out,” she said with a shrug, swirling wine in her glass. “I always do.”</p><p>But the next day, she didn’t figure it out. She texted Rio asking for help. Just for now, she wrote. Just until I get things sorted.</p><p>Rio sent the money without hesitation. Of course she did. Elena needed her—and Rio had never felt needed like that before.</p><p>At first, it was framed like a loan. Then, like a favor. Eventually, it became a pattern.</p><p>Elena would hint at money problems— unpaid bills, missed paychecks, “unfair” situations that always ended with a sigh and a helpless look.</p><p>And Rio would offer. Sometimes before Elena even had to ask.</p><p>Then it became more casual. Venmo requests for groceries that never made it to the fridge.</p><p>“Can you cover dinner?” turned into “Can you spot me rent this month?”</p><p>Rio’s savings drained slowly, like water through cupped hands. She didn’t notice at first, because Elena would always say thank you—with kisses, elaborate plans for the future, and promises that they were a team.</p><p>And sometimes, with sex.</p><p>Rio couldn’t tell if she liked it or if she just didn’t want to disappoint her.</p><p>Elena always seemed so sure of her own hands, of what Rio needed, of what they were.</p><p>
<em>It was hard to know where pleasure ended and discomfort began.</em>
</p><p>She wanted to believe Elena loved her.</p><p>Maybe she did.</p><p>But love shouldn’t feel like a transaction.</p><p>And still… Rio kept giving. She didn’t want to lose her. Didn’t want to be alone again.</p><p>She told herself it would get better. That Elena was just in a rough patch. That things would even out.</p><p>Alice noticed first.</p><p>“She’s bleeding you dry,” Alice said one night, not bothering to soften her voice. “And you’re letting her.”</p><p>Rio defended Elena, of course. Defended her like it was her job.</p><p>“You don’t understand her,” she said. “She’s had a hard life.”</p><p>But so had Rio.</p><p>She just hadn’t realized how easy it was to confuse pity for intimacy.</p><p>When Elena caught wind of Alice’s concerns, she didn’t get angry—not at first. She became calculating.</p><p>“She’s jealous,” Elena said, playing with Rio’s hair. “She doesn’t want you to be happy. She wants to control you.”</p><p>And Rio — twenty, naive, and already too far gone — believed her.</p><p>She stopped texting Alice. Avoided her calls. Told herself she was growing, maturing, building something real with Elena.</p><p>But what she was really doing was isolating herself.</p><p>What she was really doing was losing track of where her needs ended and Elena’s began.</p><p>There were days when she couldn’t remember the last time she’d bought something for herself.</p><p>Weeks where she ate noodles every night so she could send Elena money for a new dress, or a weekend trip, or a missed payment on something Rio never saw.</p><p>And every time she thought about stopping — every time her stomach knotted with discomfort — Elena would kiss her just right, or whisper, “You’re the only person who’s ever really shown up for me,” and Rio would cave all over again.</p><p>Until one day, she didn’t.</p><p>One day, she looked at all the transactions on her bank account, saw the unread messages from Alice, and finally told herself:</p><p>This wasn’t love.</p><p>It was need.</p><p>It was dependency.</p><p>It was survival—but not hers.</p><p>She left. It wasn’t dramatic. No yelling. No closure.</p><p>Just a quiet exit.</p><p>And in the months that followed, Rio didn’t just rebuild her finances — <em>she rebuilt herself.</em></p><hr/><p>Rio woke up from her nap with the faint ache behind her eyes — the kind that didn’t come from sleep, but from memory.</p><p>Not a dream.</p><p>Just a thought that lingered too long.</p><p>Elena.</p><p>She turned to the side, staring at the soft morning light spilling through the slats of the blinds. The sheets were twisted around her legs, warm and restless. Her hand instinctively reached for her phone, not to check messages, but as if the weight of it might anchor her to the now.</p><p>She exhaled.</p><p>That was years ago. A different version of herself. A different girl, really—eager to be loved, terrified to be left.</p><p>And yet…</p><p>Some days, Elena still showed up.</p><p>Not in texts or calls. But in the way Rio hesitated before trusting someone.</p><p>The day before, Rio suggested Agatha dinner instead of grabbing coffee, they agreed to meet up at a sushi restaurant a few hours after their Thursday session.</p><p>The studio was warm and quiet, the kind of quiet that pressed softly against the skin. Rio sat cross-legged on the studio floor, her back still stiff from the Tuesday — not physically, but emotionally. That ache that stays after remembering too much.</p><p>Agatha was near, close enough for comfort but not touching. They hadn’t said much. Just a glance, a soft smile. That was enough today.</p><p>Wanda stood, voice even and calm.</p><p>“Today’s dynamic is called Where I End, Where I Begin.</p><p>We’re working with boundaries — how we feel them, how we move with them, how we protect them.</p><p>One person stays grounded, the anchor. The other explores.</p><p>When someone gets close, notice what your body does. Do you lean in? Step back? Close off?</p><p>There’s no wrong move. Just awareness.”</p><p>She clapped once, gently. “Let’s pair up.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look around. She didn’t need to.</p><p>Agatha had already taken a step toward her.</p><p>“Wanna…?” she asked quietly.</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha went first — the anchor. She stood, feet planted, arms down, eyes soft.</p><p>Rio exhaled and began to move. Slowly, like she was walking through shallow water. Her arms drifted up, then down. She circled Agatha once. Then again, closer.</p><p>But when she got too close, something inside her clenched — a memory, maybe. A shadow of someone else’s hands.</p><p>She stepped back, instinctively. No apology. Just breath.</p><p>Agatha stayed still.</p><p>Rio circled again. This time slower. Her fingertips fluttered near Agatha’s shoulder, not touching, just noticing. Agatha tilted her head slightly but didn’t move. She was just… there. Letting Rio test the space.</p><p>Then they switched.</p><p>Rio stood in place, planted as best she could.</p><p>Agatha moved differently — more fluid, more uncertain. She approached, stopped. Stepped again. Her eyes checked in with Rio’s — subtle, brief.</p><p>When she got too close, Rio raised her hand gently. Palm open. A soft stop.</p><p>Agatha paused.</p><p>No words. Just a nod.</p><p>She backed off by inches and kept moving, this time more slowly, more carefully. She never crossed that invisible line again.</p><p>When it ended, they sat again in the circle. Breathing. Quiet.</p><p>No one said anything.</p><p>Rio didn’t need to.</p><p>Neither did Agatha.</p><p>Their bodies had already had the conversation.</p><p>After a few moments to breathe, Wanda stepped into the center of the circle again, her voice low, almost a whisper now.</p><p>“Let’s slow it down even more,” she said. “This next one is called Hold Without Holding.”</p><p>A pause, then:</p><p>“One of you will sit or lie in a position that feels real — maybe closed, maybe open, maybe somewhere in between. The other person’s job is to stay close. Not to touch. Not to fix. Just to be present. Just to hold… without holding.”</p><p>Her gaze softened as she looked around the room.</p><p>“When we hurt, people often rush to change it. This is about not doing that. This is about staying — even when staying feels helpless. Even when it feels like too little.”</p><p>The group slowly began pairing again. Rio didn’t move. She just looked at Agatha — who met her eyes right away.</p><p>They didn’t speak.</p><p>Agatha nodded slightly, already settling back onto the floor, legs tucked in, arms loose in her lap. Her posture was upright, but soft — like she was bracing for something without letting it show.</p><p>Rio sat a few feet in front of her.</p><p>She didn’t move closer. Didn’t reach out. Just sat.</p><p>At first, it felt strange — like she should do something. Say something. Offer her hand, a smile, a word.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>She stayed.</p><p>And as the minutes passed, something shifted. Agatha’s shoulders loosened, just barely. Her head dipped down, her breath slowed. She wasn’t crying, not visibly. But there was a tension unraveling in her chest, like someone was finally letting her rest.</p><p>Rio watched, not staring — just… witnessing. A silent I’m here. A quiet I know.</p><p>When Wanda gently signaled the switch, Rio nodded and moved into the center.</p><p>She sat cross-legged, then changed her mind and leaned back on her hands, legs stretched out. It felt exposed, but she stayed like that anyway.</p><p>Agatha took her place in front of her, grounding herself quietly. Her presence didn’t change the space — it just settled into it. She didn’t look directly at Rio. Just… near her. With her.</p><p>And for some reason, that made Rio’s throat burn.</p><p>She blinked a few times, looked at the ceiling. Exhaled. Shifted.</p><p>Still, Agatha didn’t move. She didn’t rush in. She didn’t ask anything from Rio. She just let her be.</p><p>It was the first time in a long time Rio didn’t feel like she had to perform comfort or strength or even healing.</p><p>She could just be a person.</p><p>A tired one.</p><p>Held in silence.</p><p>Not by arms.</p><p>But by trust.</p><p>And when Wanda said, “That’s enough for now,” Rio didn’t want to move.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>Slowly.</p><p>She met Agatha’s eyes for just a moment.</p><p>No smiles.</p><p>Just understanding.</p><p>Just this quiet thing they were building between them—one held breath at a time.</p><p>“All right, loves. Let’s take a moment to just be here , and then, when you’re ready, we’ll wrap up for today.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, feeling the lingering warmth of Agatha’s presence nearby. The weight of the day, the memories, the small breakthroughs—all seemed to pulse quietly in the space between them.</p><p>Agatha stood first, stretching her limbs as if waking from a long rest. She offered Rio a tentative smile, eyes full of something unspoken but understood.</p><p>Rio stood too, her body still humming with the strange comfort of having been truly seen and held even without words.</p><p>“Dinner is still up?” Rio asked softly, her voice carrying a hopeful weight.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Definitely.”</p><p>They gathered their things slowly, the studio now echoing only with the faint sounds of movement — shoes against the floor, jackets being zipped, whispered goodbyes.</p><p>As they stepped outside, the cool evening air brushed against Rio’s skin, sharp and real. The noise of the city wrapped around them—distant car horns, footsteps, the low murmur of life going on.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her fingers twitching near Rio’s hand, almost reaching but pulling back, caught in some quiet storm.</p><p>Rio noticed without looking away. She smiled softly, heart steady.</p><p>Without a word, she reached out first, her fingers brushing gently against Agatha’s before slipping into hers.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched—a soft, almost shy inhale—before she finally curled her fingers around Rio’s.</p><p>After a quiet moment, they slowly released each other’s hands. Agatha gave Rio one last lingering look, the kind that held promises yet to be spoken.</p><p>“See you in a couple of hours?” Rio asked, voice soft but hopeful.</p><p>Agatha nodded, a shy smile blooming on her lips. “Yeah. Can’t wait.”</p><p>They parted ways, each stepping into the night alone—Agatha heading back to her place, Rio to hers. The streets felt emptier now, but their minds buzzed with the anticipation of what was to come.</p><p>“Date with therapy girl!” Alice said sitting on Rio’s bed after Rio called her for a ‘date emergency’.</p><p>Rio stopped going through her closet and turned around to look at Alice. “It’s not ‘therapy girl’, it’s Agatha.”</p><p>Alice laughed. “You’re soooo in love, you didn’t mind the nickname like two days ago.”</p><p>“Are you here to help me or what?” Rio asked Alice.</p><p>Alice got up from Rio’s bed. “Sorry, sorry, let me see what you’ve got.”</p><p>Rio let out a soft breath. “I have basically everything, but now it seems like I don’t have anything.”</p><p>Alice put her arms around Rio’s shoulder. “That’s normal. Do you remember my date with Lisa?”</p><p>“No?” Rio raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. “Yeah, nevermind then.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “Please help me, I gotta be there in like forty minutes.”</p><p>“Do you have anything in mind?” Alice asked already going through Rio’s clothes.</p><p>Rio held up a soft, cream-colored oversized sweater, the one she always reached for when she wanted to feel safe. It draped over her hands and looked impossibly cozy. She matched it with her favorite skinny dark jeans and those simple white sneakers she loved — nothing flashy, just her.</p><p>“This,” Rio said softly, “I feel like me in this. Simple, comfortable.”</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow, giving the sweater a playful shake like it was a security blanket. “Rio, babe, no. You went with that stunning dress at the bar and for a date you want to wear this?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Is it that bad?”</p><p>“Yes! This is a sushi date, not a pajama party. You want Agatha to notice <em>you</em>, not your laundry schedule.”</p><p>Alice tossed the sweater onto the bed and began rifling through Rio’s closet with purpose. “Let’s find something that says, ‘I’m here, I’m glowing, and I definitely don’t live in sweatpants.’”</p><p>Rio laughed, feeling that nervous flutter in her chest, but also that warm reassurance that Alice had her back.</p><p>“How about this?” Alice held up a long sleek black dress—simple but elegant, with just enough edge to catch the light and hold attention without screaming for it.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened slightly. “That’s… different. I don’t know if I can pull that off.”</p><p>Alice gave her a confident grin. “You can pull off anything. You just need to believe it. Now come on, let’s get you glowing.”</p><p>She carefully pulled the black dress over her head, the fabric smooth and light against her. It hugged her just right—not too tight, but enough to remind her she was more than just ‘comfortable.’</p><p>Okay… what do you think?” Rio asked, voice small but curious.</p><p>Alice came up behind her, peeking over her shoulder with a grin that lit up the room. “Damn, Riri, you look like you just stepped out of a dream. This is the dress that says, ‘I’m a whole vibe.’”</p><p>Rio laughed nervously, twisting a strand of hair around her finger. “It feels… different. Like I’m trying on someone else.”</p><p>Alice spun her around playfully, making Rio laugh more freely than she had in weeks. “You’re gonna knock Agatha’s socks off.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, the flutter in her stomach settling into something like courage. “Alright, let’s do this.”</p><p>Alice threw an arm around her shoulders. “That’s the spirit. Now, let me fix your hair and you’ll be unstoppable.”</p><p>Alice grabbed a hairbrush and a little styling spray from Rio’s dresser, tugging her gently toward the mirror. “Alright, we’re gonna keep it natural but <em>wow</em>—like you just woke up this gorgeous, okay?”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks warmed, but she nodded, trusting Alice’s magic hands.</p><p>As Alice worked, she chatted easily, filling the room with light energy. “Remember that time you wore that wild floral dress to the party and rocked it like a queen? This is the same vibe. Just… sleek and mysterious instead of floral garden.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, relaxing into the moment. The knots in her stomach loosened with every brush stroke.</p><p>“Now,” Alice said, stepping back to admire her handiwork, “let’s try that smile you have when you’re thinking about something funny but trying to hide it.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip, feeling shy, but then a slow smile curved her lips — warm, a little mischievous, and entirely hers.</p><p>“That’s the one,” Alice declared with a triumphant grin. “That smile? Agatha won’t know what hit her.”</p><p>Rio looked at herself in the mirror again — the girl reflected back was still her, but braver, softer, glowing with a kind of quiet strength she hadn’t noticed before.</p><p>Alice nudged her playfully. “Okay, date time! Go show her the magic you’ve been hiding.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her purse, took a deep breath, and with Alice’s supportive squeeze on her shoulder, stepped out ready to be seen.</p><p>The restaurant was small, warm, and softly lit, with the faint scent of grilled fish drifting through the air. Rio stepped inside and scanned the room until she saw her.</p><p>Agatha was tucked into the farthest table, shoulders drawn in slightly, her green sweater sleeves pulled halfway over her hands. Her gaze kept flicking toward the entrance, then away again, like she was bracing for someone else to walk in.</p><p>When Rio finally made her way over, Agatha sat up straighter, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “Hey,” she said, her voice quiet, but her smile trying to reach her eyes.</p><p>Rio slid into the seat opposite, her own smile warmer, steadier. “You beat me here.”</p><p>“I, um… didn’t want to be late,” Agatha murmured, glancing down at the table as she fiddled with her chopsticks in their paper sleeve.</p><p>The server came by to pour tea, and Agatha thanked him in almost a whisper. Rio noticed her shoulders drop only after the server left, as if she’d been holding her breath.</p><p>“You look nice,” Rio said, without hesitation.</p><p>Agatha’s lips quirked into a small, uncertain smile. “Thanks. I… almost changed. Twice.” She laughed under her breath, a sound too quick to be fully relaxed.</p><p>“That’s funny,” Rio said, resting her forearms on the table, “because it looks like you picked exactly the right thing.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked up at that, just for a moment, and Rio caught the faintest flush at the tips of her ears.</p><p>“So… hm, do you go out a lot?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Not really, even though my friends practically have to drag me out of my house.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “What about you, do you go out a lot?”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Let’s say once or twice. Most of the time I go out with Alice.”</p><p>“As you should, she is very nice.” Agatha smiled softly.</p><p>“She made quite an impression on you, hasn’t she?” Rio teased.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “She did. But you don’t need to get jealous.”</p><p>Rio drew in an exaggerated gasp, a hand to her chest. “Me? Jealous? Never.”</p><p>That finally coaxed a real laugh from Agatha, quick but warm.</p><p>Agatha glanced toward the window where cars and people walked by, then back at Rio. She hesitated for a moment before speaking.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“How old are you?”</p><p>Rio blinked, a little surprised but smiled gently. “Thirty-seven.”</p><p>Agatha nodded like she’d expected something else. “Okay. I thought you might be younger.”</p><p>“I get that.”</p><p>There was a quiet pause. Agatha glanced at her tea, then back up. “I’m twenty-four.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “You’re younger than I thought.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said softly, “sometimes I feel like I should be older.”</p><p>Rio’s smile was warm, patient. “It’s not about the number. It’s about the person.”</p><p>Agatha gave a small, grateful smile.</p><p>Just then, the waiter arrived with their sushi, breaking the silence but not the feeling between them.</p><p>“Ah, this is my favorite one.” Rio said as she grabbed a salmon roll.</p><p>Agatha laughed. “This is the most common one.”</p><p>Rio moaned when she put it in her mouth. “Yeah, as it should because it’s the best.”</p><p>“That is sooo wrong, the best one is obviously tuna rolls.” Agatha smirked.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Can’t believe you just said that. Just eat your food.”</p><p>Agatha laughed really hard.</p><p>Rio smiled, savoring the last bite of her salmon roll. “You know, I once tried making sushi at home. Disaster. Ended up ordering takeout anyway.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly. “I can imagine. I’d probably burn the kitchen.”</p><p>“Definitely,” Rio said, eyes crinkling with amusement. “But it was fun trying, even if it was a mess.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her gaze lingering on Rio a moment longer. “I like that about you — trying, even if it’s messy.”</p><p>Rio felt a warm pulse behind her chest. She looked down at hands, suddenly aware of how quiet the restaurant had become around them.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, lifting her gaze, “what’s one thing you like about dance therapy so far?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, fingers tracing the rim of her teacup. “It’s strange — I didn’t expect to feel this… safe, I guess. Like, finally having space to just be.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “Yeah. That makes sense. It’s not just the moves. It’s the feeling behind them.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, a little more openly this time. “Exactly.”</p><p>There was a pause, filled only by the soft clink of chopsticks and quiet murmurs from other tables.</p><p>“Thanks for asking,” Agatha said quietly, eyes meeting Rio’s. “It means a lot.”</p><p>Rio reached out, her fingers brushing lightly against Agatha’s hand on the table. “Anytime.”</p><p>Rio smiled, taking a bite of her sushi. “So, what’s your go-to comfort movie when you just want to relax and forget everything?”</p><p>Agatha thought for a second, then smiled shyly. “Honestly? <em>Pretty Woman.</em> It’s silly but somehow always makes me feel better.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly. “Classic.”</p><p>“What about you? Any guilty pleasure shows or movies?”</p><p>“It’s actually a reality show called <em>Nailed It,</em>” Rio said without hesitation. “I’ve watched it at least three times.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes lit up. “No way, me too! I love seeing those failed cakes.”</p><p>They both laughed, the conversation flowing easier now.</p><p>“So, are you more of a morning person or a night owl?” Rio asked, leaning in slightly.</p><p>“Definitely a night owl,” Agatha said with a small grin. “Mornings are a struggle.”</p><p>“Same here,” Rio said. “I’m pretty much useless before my first coffee.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Glad I’m not the only one.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her plate. “Okay, real talk—what’s one thing you’ve always wanted to learn but never got around to?”</p><p>Agatha paused. “Playing the piano. I’ve always loved music but never took lessons.”</p><p>“That’s awesome. I wish I could play an instrument.”</p><p>“Maybe one day we can take a class together,” Agatha suggested quietly.</p><p>Rio smiled. “I’d like that.”</p><p>The plates were nearly empty, and the warm glow of the restaurant wrapped around them like a quiet comfort.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, a little shy. “Would you want to do this again? Maybe somewhere a bit louder next time? I feel like we haven’t talked enough.”</p><p>Agatha looked up, surprise flickering, then a shy smile bloomed. “I’d like that.”</p><p>They stood slowly, gathering their things as the server brought the check.</p><p>They stepped outside together, the cool night air a gentle contrast to the warmth still radiating between them. Streetlights cast a soft golden glow on the pavement, painting everything with a kind of quiet magic.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her fingers brushing lightly against Rio’s as if testing the waters. Rio felt the small, almost hesitant contact, and instead of pulling away, she let her hand settle over Agatha’s with a slow, comforting squeeze.</p><p>The moment stretched out—no words, just the pulse of something fragile and new weaving between them.</p><p>Rio finally broke the silence, her voice low and steady. “I’m really glad you came tonight. I was a little nervous, I’ll admit.”</p><p>Agatha looked up, eyes shimmering in the soft light. “Me too. But… I’m glad I did. More than I thought I would be.”</p><p>A shy smile curved Rio’s lips. “Maybe this is a good start. Not everything has to be loud or rushed, right?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, biting her lip as if gathering courage. “Yeah. Slow is okay. I… like slow.”</p><p>Rio’s heart caught at the honesty. “Me too.”</p><p>They stood there, wrapped in the quiet of the city night, two people letting down their walls just a little.</p><p>After a breath, Rio took a small step closer. “So… dinner again? Maybe next time somewhere with more noise, like I said.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, a sound that felt like sunlight breaking through clouds. “I’d like that.”</p><p>The street was empty enough that they didn’t have to pull away just yet. Agatha’s hand lingered in Rio’s, fingers curling together. Her voice was barely above a whisper. “Thank you… for tonight. For being patient with me.”</p><p>Rio smiled wider, the kind of smile that reaches the eyes. “Thank you for trusting me.”</p><p>Finally, with a reluctant squeeze, they let go.</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha,” Rio said, her voice warm and tender.</p><p>“Goodnight, Rio,” came the reply, soft and sincere.</p><p>They went their separate ways, but the night felt different now—full of possibility, quiet hope, and the promise of something real slowly unfolding.</p><p>As Rio walked away, she glanced back once more, catching Agatha’s tentative wave. She smiled to herself, heart a little lighter, ready for whatever came next.</p>

<p>Even after getting home, Agatha’s heart couldn’t stop pounding in her chest. She had a lovely day, and that was all because of Rio, who had a certain way of making her days brighter.</p><p>Her mind was replaying tiny moments from their time together—how their hands had brushed twice in the same day, how Rio’s laughter seemed to linger in the air even now, how they could talk without feeling the need to hide anything.</p><p>But beneath the glow, there was a quiet ache in her chest. She lay back on her bed, phone in hand, thumb hovering over the keyboard. She typed out <em>“I had a great time today”</em>, then erased it. Too simple. She tried again: <em>“I can’t stop thinking about you”</em>. Too much.</p><p>Her screen dimmed, and she caught her reflection in the black glass. <em>What if I scare her off? What if she’s just being polite?</em></p><p>The buzzing of a notification made her jolt, but it wasn’t from Rio. She let out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding. The house was too quiet, the night too long.</p><p>Agatha pulled the blanket over her and closed her eyes, holding on to the sound of Rio’s voice as if it could carry her to sleep. She promised herself she’d be brave tomorrow. Maybe she’d even be the one to send the first message.</p><p>The blanket was warm, but it couldn’t stop the restless energy thrumming through her. She turned to her side, hugging her pillow like it could somehow fill the empty space beside her.</p><p>Her mind refused to stay still. It kept replaying the exact curve of Rio’s smile when she’d been caught mid-thought, the way her voice dipped low when she said Agatha’s name, the brief touch of their hands that left more heat than it should have.</p><p>Her phone was still on the mattress, unlocked, the chat with Rio open. She thought of sending a single emoji—something light, something safe—but her eyelids grew heavy before she could choose one.</p><p>Sleep crept in slowly, pulling her into a hazy replay of the day. She was laughing again, sushi on the table, Rio leaning in just close enough for their knees to brush. In the dream, it felt like they didn’t have to leave, like time had stopped just for them.</p><p>A soft sigh escaped her in her sleep.</p><p>And in that half-dreaming space, Agatha wondered if Rio was lying in her own bed, thinking about her too.</p><p>Morning light spilled through the curtains, soft and unrelenting. Agatha blinked a few times, her body still tangled in blankets, her mind already skipping ahead to the day. The warmth of last night’s memories clung to her, like a soft, dangerous pull.</p><p>She reached for her phone again, heart thudding faster than she wanted to admit. The chat with Rio was still open. She stared at it, thumb hovering over the screen. Say something. Just one thing. But every word she typed seemed either too bold or too timid, too much or too little.</p><p>Finally, she exhaled, leaning back against the headboard.</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha: </em>
</b>
<em>Morning</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Rio:</strong> Morning! I was hoping to hear from you.</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Agatha:</strong> I almost didn’t text, overthinking everything</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Rio:</strong> That sounds familiar. But I’m glad you did.</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Agatha:</strong> Me too. I had a really nice time yesterday</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Rio:</strong> Same. I keep thinking about that sushi. You kept stealing the tuna rolls though. 😒</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Agatha:</strong> Okay, guilty. But the salmon ones were yours. You can have those</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Rio:</strong> Deal. But only if you promise to laugh like that again. That laugh… it’s kind of unforgettable.</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Agatha:</strong> You’re making me nervous</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Rio:</strong> That’s part of my charm. 😉</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Agatha:</strong> Mean. But… I kind of like it</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Rio:</strong> Good. Mission accomplished.</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Agatha:</strong> Maybe we can do it again soon?</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Rio:</strong> Definitely. How’s tomorrow night looking?</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Agatha:</strong> Free. And a little excited, not gonna lie</em>
</p><p><em><strong>Rio:</strong> Same here. Can’t wait to see you again.</em> ❤️</p><p>Agatha grew up in a loving home, where emotions were their priority and not just a check box. Sometimes, she felt lonely; she quickly learned how to take care of herself and to read the moods of people before speaking. Friendships came and went, sometimes leaving more questions than comfort, and she learned to guard her heart carefully.</p><p>When she was fifteen, Agatha was alone at the park late at night, sitting on a bench, when another girl came up to her.</p><p>“Hi,” the girl said.</p><p>Agatha looked up, her eyes puffy from tears. “Hi.”</p><p>The girl extended her hand, “I’m Jennifer but most people call me Jen.”</p><p>Agatha took it. “Agatha.”</p><p>Jen tilted her head. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha barely knew the girl, of course she wasn’t going to tell her personal stuff.</p><p>She noticed that the girl understood what she meant by that—she didn’t want to talk about it. “Can I sit down?”</p><p>Agatha sniffed. “I just want to be alone.”</p><p>Jen gave Agatha a soft smile. “Maybe we can be alone together.”</p><p>“Okay.” was all Agatha said.</p><p>So they sat there. They sat there for hours just looking at the view with a million thoughts in their heads.</p><p>And in that quiet companionship, Agatha felt less like she was alone, and more like she was exactly where she was supposed to be.</p><p>They would always hang out—all the time. It was sleepovers, birthday parties together (even though they were months apart), and as they got older, bars, club parties, and everything else possible.</p><p>Jen was the first person that made Agatha feel truly seen, and now, now Rio was there too—but this time it felt bigger, heavier in the best way.</p><p>When Agatha started dance therapy, she was at her lowest—her true lowest.</p><p>Of course she didn’t enjoy it at first. She never enjoys things on the first try but she didn’t give up even though all voices inside her head were telling her to.</p><p>If you look at it, it’s very weird: dancing in a studio full of people that the only thing you know about them is that they’re also going through stuff. That’s how she felt in the beginning, but after three sessions, she started to understand what it was all about.</p><p>It was about remembering she still had a body, a voice, a presence beyond her pain. That even when those memories dulled her edges, there were parts of her that wanted to breathe, to stretch, to reach for someone else’s hand and not let go immediately.</p><p>And that was exactly how Rio was making her feel. <em>Alive.</em></p><p>Agatha was never a romantic person—even though she is young. During her high school years, she’d hook up with some girls here and there but it was never serious. One that really stuck with her was Estella.</p><p>They were sort of dating (if you can call it that), and then one night at Agatha’s home, they were having dinner with Agatha’s mom and she was talking about how she got married at a young age and how, quote, “the beautiful and cute Agatha was born.” After dinner, when they were in her room, Estella told Agatha that they would get married right after finishing high school and two days later, Agatha called things off.</p><p>She couldn’t explain it, not even to herself—only that the word “forever” felt like a lock, not a promise.</p><p>Jen had shown her what it was like to be seen. Estella had shown her what it was like to feel wanted but not understood. And now Rio was here—steady, patient, pulling her into something that felt dangerously close to hope.</p><p>Agatha worked as a graphic designer. It paid well, and more importantly, it was something she genuinely enjoyed. Working from home meant she could control her schedule, her environment, and the pace of her day — which suited her perfectly. Despite the comfort her career provided, she preferred simplicity. Her Mediterranean-style 150 m² apartment was more than enough, filled with the things she loved, arranged just so. She lived alone, but the walls didn’t feel empty — they felt like a space she had made entirely her own.</p><p>She liked her apartment just the way it was — quiet, ordered, hers. But yet, sometimes she wondered what it would feel like if someone else lived here too. Someone who made her laugh, who left crumbs on the floor without apology… someone like Rio.</p><p>But it was too soon to even think about that.</p><p>Rio was older, way more interesting and Agatha, Agatha was merely a true adult.</p><p>Those thoughts lead her to a more experienced person in the area — Jen.</p><p>Agatha grabbed her phone and called her best friend. The moment Jen answered, Agatha immediately spoke:</p><p>“Come over.”</p><p>“Oh, hey! Good morning Jen, I’m sorry I haven’t texted or anything in like… forever.” Jen mocked Agatha.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Jen, I need help. Just come over.”</p><p>“So polite!” Agatha could feel Jen’s sarcasm through the phone.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath. “Please, come over?”</p><p>Jen clicked her tongue. “That’s how I like it. I’m on my way.” Agatha didn’t even have time to answer, Jen just ended the call.</p><p>After long fifteen minutes, Jen had finally got to Agatha’s apartment.</p><p>She barely had time to open the door and Jen was already busting in, pajamas on (?), phone in hand, and a bonnet even though she’s bald (?????). The woman has no shame.</p><p>“Tell me what’s going on.” Jen was already on her way to the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha rubbed her temple and followed her. “Jen, when you were younger you were more polite.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m glad I’m not a teenager anymore then.” She said smiling not even looking at Agatha. “So, tell me.”</p><p>Agatha sat on the kitchen counter. “So, in dance therapy, there is a woman tha—“</p><p>“Hmmmm, a woman?” Jen said, smirking.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “A woman that is very interesting and pretty.”</p><p>“Uhum, interesting a pretty.” Jen crossed her arms.</p><p>“Can you like, let me speak?”</p><p>Jen put her hands up apologetically. “Sorry.”</p><p>“So, last night, we went on a date and we are going on another one tomorrow.”</p><p>Jen widened her eyes. “YOU WENT ON A DATE?! AND DIDN’T TELL ME?!!”</p><p>Agatha looked at the windows. “It’s not that I didn’t want to. It’s because I started to think about <em>that.”</em></p><p>“Oh… That <em>that</em>?” Jen, who was looking for something on Agatha’s cabinet, stopped what she was doing.</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly. “Yes, and it’s making me feel insecure about everything even though I know I don’t have to worry about it.”</p><p>A short pause settled in between them.</p><p>“I know I don’t have to worry but my conscience keeps telling me that it could happen again and when I think about it it feels like I’m talking thirty steps backwards.”</p><p>Jen came closer to Agatha. “Look, you’re the strongest person I know. I’m not saying that because you’re my best friend, don’t ever think that.”</p><p>“I’m saying it because it’s true. You’ve been through things that would’ve broken someone else in half, and you’re still here. You still open up, you still try. And now you’ve found someone who makes you light up in a way I haven’t seen in years.”</p><p>Agatha lowered her eyes, suddenly feeling small under Jen’s gaze.</p><p>Jen tilted her head. “You’re scared because it matters this time. That doesn’t mean you’re not ready—it just means you’re human. And honestly?” She nudged Agatha’s knee. “Rio would be an idiot not to see how lucky she is.”</p><p>A tiny smile tugged at Agatha’s lips despite herself.</p><p>“See? There she is.” Jen grinned. “That smile is proof you want this. So stop letting your brain write horror stories before anything even happens. Just… let yourself enjoy it, okay?”</p><p>“I love you.” Agatha had trouble saying those three words but when she did, she meant it with all her heart and soul.</p><p>Jen’s expression softened immediately. “I know. I love you too, park girl.” She reached over and squeezed Agatha’s hand, her thumb brushing lightly over the back of it. “That’s why I want you to have this. To let yourself be happy again.”</p><p>Later, when Jen finally left, Agatha stood by the door, staring at the empty hallway with a strange flutter in her chest. Tomorrow didn’t feel as terrifying anymore. Tomorrow felt possible.</p><p>And then—tomorrow came.</p><p>She almost canceled three times. Her thumb hovered over the screen, crafting excuses she’d never send. But when the time came, she showed up anyway.</p><p>She chose to wear a purple sweater, a short black leather skirt, black leather boots and a purple Fendi bag that her mom had gifted her.</p><p>It was the same sushi restaurant but this time there were more people inside and that definitely did <em>not</em> freak Agatha out.</p><p>She took a deep breath, smoothing the front of her sweater, trying to calm the fluttering in her chest. The moment Rio saw her, a grin spread across her face like sunlight breaking through clouds.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, voice warm and teasing. “You look… amazing.”</p><p>Agatha felt heat rush to her cheeks. “Thanks… you too.” She noticed the subtle shift in Rio’s expression—the kind that made her heart skip.</p><p>They slid into a booth near the window, sitting side to side. The soft hum of conversation around them seemed to vanish when they were together, as if the restaurant had quietly decided to exist just for them.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, leaning back slightly, “still stealing all the tuna rolls?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, a little louder than she intended. “Maybe… but only because you make them too easy to steal.”</p><p>Their hands brushed again, accidentally on purpose, and this time Agatha didn’t pull away. She let the warmth linger, letting it anchor her.</p><p>Rio ordered extra tuna rolls, she said she was starving, but deep down they both knew she only did that so Agatha could ”steal” them. And that made Agatha’s heart way warmer than it always is when she’s next to Rio.</p><p>While they were waiting for the food, they were asking each other questions about life in general.</p><p>“I forgot to ask the last time, what do you work with?” Rio asked Agatha.</p><p>“Oh, I’m a… graphic designer. It probably doesn’t sound like the coolest job out there but.” Now that she was saying out loud to someone she really likes, the job did sound out of character.</p><p>Rio shook her head slowly. “For the contrary, I think this is one of the coolest jobs out there.”</p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p>“First of all, you have to be creative; second of all, you have to be really smart; and third, if you like it, you don’t have to prove to me or anyone else how cool or interesting your job is. You’re the one having fun creating stuff, not them.”</p><p>Agatha felt heat creep up her neck, not from embarrassment but from something tender and fluttering. She looked down at her hands, fidgeting slightly with the napkin in front of her. “You… really think that?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her eyes softening, gaze locking onto Agatha’s in a way that made her heart skip. “Absolutely. I can tell you care about what you do, and that’s what matters.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest felt like it was expanding with something she hadn’t realized she’d been holding in for so long—hope, maybe even a little courage. She glanced up again at Rio, and something in that look, that patient, warm attentiveness, made her pulse spike.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers trembled as she reached for Rio’s hand, her heart thundering in her chest. The warmth of Rio’s smile and the soft way her eyes held hers made something inside her unravel. She leaned in slowly, almost hesitantly, brushing her lips against Rio’s.</p><p>But as soon as she did, her stomach dropped. “I—I’m sorry, I didn’t mean—I shouldn’t have—It’s too soon, isn’t it? she stammered, pulling back slightly, panic prickling at the edge of her chest.</p><p>Without saying a single word, Rio closed the distance, pressing her lips against hers again. This time, there was no hesitation—just a steady, confident heat that made Agatha’s knees feel like jelly. Her heart stuttered, then raced, each second stretching deliciously as Rio deepened the kiss, tilting her head slightly, letting Agatha melt into the moment.</p><p>Agatha’s hands rose almost instinctively, resting against Rio’s hand. Every small movement—the curve of Rio’s smile she could feel through the kiss, the warmth of her touch, the soft sighs that mingled between them—sent waves of something fierce and tender through her.</p><p>When they finally parted, just enough to breathe, Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s, eyes half-closed, whispering, “I’ve wanted to do that forever.”</p><p>Rio smiled, voice soft and low, “Me too. Me too.”</p><p>When the sushi finally arrived at their table, neither of them cared about it anymore.</p><p>Agatha finally let out a soft laugh, shaking her head slightly. “We should probably… eat. Before it all gets cold.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, brushing a strand of hair from her face. “Yeah… that would be smart. But, honestly, I don’t even care about the sushi right now.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, a little shyly, but that warmth in her chest didn’t fade. She realized she didn’t feel rushed or anxious anymore—the fear that usually gripped her before intimacy was replaced with something lighter, freer. She could just… be.</p><p>They ate slowly, stealing glances at each other, occasionally reaching to touch hands again, fingers lacing naturally. Conversation meandered from light jokes about tuna roll “heists” to small personal stories—funny childhood memories, the little quirks of their lives, favorite movies. The comfort between them grew, layering over the excitement of the kiss.</p><p>By the time they left the restaurant, the night air was cool, crisp, and refreshing. Agatha kept close to Rio as they walked, letting herself relax fully, the tension that had gripped her chest all day finally melting away.</p><p>When they reached Agatha’s car, they lingered by the door, neither quite ready to let the evening end.

<p>Rio was ecstatic for many reasons—and, of course, all of them were because of Agatha. They had gone on two dates, and they kissed on the second one. It was probably—no, it was—the best kiss Rio had ever had, and she had kissed a lot of people.</p><p>She wasn’t sure where things were headed or how it would all unfold, but she promised herself she would wait for Agatha’s own timing—never rushing her, never doing anything that might overwhelm her or make her feel pressured.</p><p>One thing that made Rio admire Agatha the way she did was the fact that Agatha had her own universe—she lived according to her thoughts, her needs, and never because someone else told her to. That independence fascinated Rio. She also loved the way Agatha talked about the things she adored, how her eyes sparkled with intensity when she was immersed, and that shy smile that sometimes appeared out of nowhere—a smile Rio wished she could see every day.</p><p>And there was her laugh. That laugh—the one that felt like sunlight catching the edges of Rio’s chest, making her cheeks warm, her heart beat faster, and a soft thrill curl in her stomach.</p><p>How could a single person make her cheeks heat up, her heart race, and yet feel completely safe all at once?</p><p>Rio didn’t know. She only knew it was Agatha—and that was enough.</p><p>Monday pulled her back down to earth. The weekend glow, the memory of Agatha’s smile, all had to share space with the quiet truth of her reality. Mondays meant routines, work, schedules. For Rio, it meant opening her laptop, scrolling through job listings she didn’t care about, and feeling a tight knot in her chest as each irrelevant posting blurred into the next.</p><p><em>None of this is me,</em> she thought, shivering at the thought of sitting in an office, answering to someone she didn’t respect, counting hours until freedom. She wanted more. No—she <em>needed</em> more.</p><p>Maybe it was time to carve something for herself, something alive, something that could grow from her hands instead of just a line on a résumé. The thought was terrifying. But so was kissing Agatha—and she survived that, didn’t she? More than survived, she <em>lived.</em></p><p>By Tuesday, Rio returned to the studio, her heart quietly humming. She was late, caught up in conversation with Alice about her business idea. Alice’s encouragement had been infectious; she’d even offered to help find customers for Rio’s future flower shop. Rio had felt a small, shy flicker of excitement at the thought.</p><p>The first thing she noticed was the empty space where Agatha usually sat. A pang twisted in her chest, sharpening the edges of her nerves. Confidence fled, leaving only questions and insecurities.</p><p><em>Did she regret the kiss? Did she get tired of me?</em> The thoughts spiraled before Rio could stop them. <em>Everyone does. Why am I even surprised?</em></p><p>It was strange—when Agatha was present, the other people in the room barely existed. Now, with her absence glaringly obvious, Rio was hyperaware of every movement, every laugh, every small sound.</p><p>Jacob sat cross-legged, munching on a snack, while Benjamin laughed at something he had said. Beatrice danced through a delicate ballet sequence, her feet light and precise, as if tracing invisible lines in the studio. Rose fiddled with her hands, her eyes flicking nervously to the floor.</p><p>Wanda clapped her hands, sharp and bright, calling everyone’s attention. “Alright, everyone! Today, we’re trying something different,” she said, her energy spilling into the corners of the room. “No choreography, no steps—just a circle. We’ll speak, we’ll listen, and we’ll let movement come from inside, not outside.”</p><p>Rio found her spot, cross-legged, and took a quiet breath. She stole glances around the circle. Everyone seemed calm, centered, prepared to participate. Her eyes kept flicking to the empty space where Agatha usually sat, and each glance made her chest tighten.</p><p>Wanda’s gaze swept the circle, landing on Rio for just a moment before moving on. “Remember,” she said softly, “this is a safe space. Speak only if you want, listen if you don’t. And sometimes… just feeling is enough.”</p><p>Wanda sat down on the floor next to the Rio, and after a beat, added, “Alright—who wants to start?”</p><p>Benjamin tilted his head, uncertain. “What are we… supposed to say?”</p><p>“Anything,” Wanda answered, smiling. “Recent experiences, moments that made you feel alive, proud, scared, vulnerable—anything. Even small things that seem silly.”</p><p>Benjamin swallowed, then spoke. “Well… I went to a club with my friends. I haven’t done that in forever. It was… nice. To be around people I like, and just… enjoy it.”</p><p>Jacob leaned forward, a grin spreading across his face. “I adopted a dog. Her name is Chérie. She’s… a handful, but I love her.”</p><p>Beatrice’s voice was soft but sure. “I started ballet again. And my grades… they’re actually improving.”</p><p>Rose lifted her gaze briefly from her fingers. “I learned how to make sushi. Like… for real. It was messy, but I made it.”</p><p>Wanda’s smile widened, almost radiant, as the circle hummed with shared vulnerabilities.</p><p>Rio’s turn was inevitable. She swallowed, cheeks warming. “I… kissed someone,” she said, her voice quieter than she expected, but steady enough.</p><p>“My, my, my, I’m so glad you all shared your recent experiences. Not only with me but with the whole group, that means a lot. It really does.” Wanda’s eyes softened, her voice a gentle anchor. “Sometimes, it’s the smallest moments, the tiniest connections, that teach us the most about ourselves. Keep noticing them, honoring them, and letting them grow inside you.”</p><p>They went for another 4 rounds of questions, which included:</p><p>
<em>1- What’s their favorite thing to do;</em>
</p><p>
<em>2- Describe their comfort zone;</em>
</p><p>
<em>3- Why they started dance therapy;</em>
</p><p>And lastly:</p><p>
<em>4- What’s their motivation.</em>
</p><p>Those last two questions made Rio hesitate before answering, but the last question made her hesitate, not from the feeling of becoming vulnerable — but the feeling of not knowing how to answer it.</p><p>At her age, society said she should have an answer—should know what she wanted, what she needed. But she had only just begun untangling the threads of herself. To admit she didn’t know… that made her feel small, almost fragile. And yet, in that fragility, there was a flicker of something thrilling: a chance to really discover what made her heart hum, what made her alive, what could—maybe—grow into something real, like the plants she dreamed of tending.</p><p>Rio was curled up on her couch at home, staring at her chat with Agatha deciding if she should text her or not. There were two possibilities if she did: Agatha would feel pressured or she’d feel sort of comforted.</p><p>Even though texting her was what Rio wanted to do, she was trying to do this is Agatha’s terms—especially because she was still feeling weird about it. Not because of Agatha’s age, but her own. She fears that somehow she will do to Agatha what Elena did to her—suffocated her. She’d promised herself, after that, never to make someone feel caged.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t Elena. <em>She knows she isn’t.</em></p><p>Her screen dimmed, forcing her to tap it back awake. She scrolled back through their last exchange, rereading the handful of words that lingered between them.</p><p>She set her phone face down and leaned her head against the couch cushion. For now, maybe it was better to let the silence breathe. Agatha would come back to the circle when she was ready. And Rio… Rio would be here.</p><p>Another day began and it was “lunch with Alice” Wednesday! And whenever Rio needed advices, Alice was the one. This time they chose to have lunch at an Italian trattoria near Alice’s apartment. Her plan was to have lunch with Alice and then look for places to start her new business.</p><p>Rio arrived at the Italian trattoria, the warm smell of garlic and tomatoes wrapping around her like a blanket. Alice was already there, a half-eaten breadstick in one hand, her phone in the other. She looked up, her expression a mix of concern and mock exasperation.</p><p>"Don't even tell me," Alice said, gesturing to the empty space across from her. "It's the Agatha thing, isn't it?"</p><p>Rio slid into the chair, sighing as she set her purse down. "She wasn't at therapy yesterday. And I haven't heard from her since our date."</p><p>Alice's expression softened. She set her breadstick down and leaned forward. "Okay, so what are you scared of? That she's ghosting you? That she regrets it? Or that she just needs a minute?"</p><p>Rio picked at the napkin on the table. "All of the above. I feel like I'm back in high school. I keep thinking, 'Did I do too much? Did I move too fast?' And then... the other part of my brain says, 'It has been four days, Rio. Get a grip.'"</p><p>"Well, which one do you believe?" Alice asked. "The high school girl or the one who will start a business?"</p><p>Rio looked up, surprised. "What does that have to do with anything?"</p><p>"Everything," Alice said, her voice firm but kind. "You're literally about to start a flower shop. You're building a whole life for yourself from scratch, which is a terrifying, beautiful, grown-up thing to do. And you think you're going to suffocate someone by sending a text message? You are not Elena. She was a leech. You're a garden, Riri. You're planting things, not taking them away."</p><p>Rio didn't have an answer for that. She just sat there, letting the words sink in, a small smile slowly growing on her face. A waitress came to take their order, and as soon as she was gone, Rio spoke again, her voice softer this time.</p><p>"I keep thinking about the empty space where she usually sits at. It felt so loud, you know? Like her not being there was the only thing I could feel."</p><p>Alice nodded, reaching across the table to give Rio's hand a gentle squeeze. "I get it. But that's a part of her story you don't get to control. She gets to decide when she's ready to show up for herself, and for you. The best thing you can do is keep showing up for yourself, too."</p><p>Rio took a long, steadying breath. "You're right. You're so right."</p><p>Alice let go of her hand and smiled. "Good. Now, what's this about looking at flower shop locations? We have a whole afternoon to get our hands dirty. It’s a start. Let's make this something real."</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, a true, genuine smile that reached her eyes. "Let's do it."</p><p>Later that afternoon, Rio was walking down a quiet, sun-dappled street with a notepad in her hand, Alice striding purposefully beside her. The air was crisp, and the scent of budding flowers from a nearby park was a soft perfume. Rio felt a spark of something she hadn't felt in years—purpose. She wasn't just a girl with a trust fund and a past; she was a woman with a plan.</p><p>They stopped in front of a small, quaint building with large windows and a worn brick facade. A dusty <em>"For Rent"</em> sign hung in the window with the owner’s number under it, and Rio felt her heart rate quicken. The building was old, but she saw potential in it, the kind of potential you could only find in a place that had been left to its own devices for too long. The location was also good — it was next to the most famous club in town, called The Witches Road.</p><p>"This is it," Rio said, her voice a mix of awe and excitement. "This is the one. I can see it.”</p><p>Rio knew it would be a lot of work. But the prospect of work didn't feel like a burden. It felt like an invitation.</p><p>Rio was standing on the sidewalk, looking at the building, when her phone buzzed. She almost didn't check it, but something made her pull it out of her pocket. It was a text from Agatha.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>So, I wasn’t there yesterday</em></p><p>Rio's heart skipped a beat, a mix of relief and a new kind of anxiety. She quickly typed a response.</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> I know. I missed you.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I had a lot on my mind. Sorry for disappearing</em></p><p>Rio felt a rush of warmth. The silence hadn't been about her after all. It had been about Agatha.</p><p>Rio: Don’t ever be sorry. Take all the time you need. I just... wanted to make sure you were okay.</p><p>Agatha: <em>I am. I’m better. Just needed a minute to... process everything</em></p><p>A small smile tugged at Rio's lips. She looked at Alice, then back at the text message. Alice knew exactly what was going on and she nodded, smiling to herself.</p><p>Rio: Good. Just let me know when you’re ready to see me again. No pressure.</p><p>Agatha: <em>Soon</em></p><p>Rio felt a sense of calm wash over her. She knew that "soon" could mean a day, a week, or a month. But for the first time, she wasn't afraid of the wait. She had her own thing now, her own life to build, her own garden to tend.</p><p>And when Agatha was ready, Rio would be waiting.</p><p>Alice smirked. “From the look on your face, that was a good exchange of texts.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. Everything’s good.”</p><p>Alice gave her a side hug. “See,” she said softly. “It’s all about timing.” Rio’s smile itself spoke more than words.</p><p>“We have to go out sometime again,” Alice smiled. “Us three.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curved into a smile. “I’ll invite her.”</p><p>Alice’s face turned to the shop ahead of them. “This is it, huh? I can already see how it’s going to look like, it will be Rio all over the place.”</p><p>“I can already see it too.” Rio’s heart was warm—warm with pride, excitement and most important, full of love.</p><p>Alice hugged her—really hugged her. “I love you so much, Rio. I’m so proud of you, proud of how you had overcome your traumas. I love you.” Alice was sniffing on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Rio hugged her back. “I love you too, Al.”</p><p>After spending a long time hugging in the front of the shop, Rio was finally back home, phone in hand, she began dialing the number that was on the sign. After fifteen seconds, a man's voice picked up.</p><p>Rio sat up straight on her bed as if he could see her. "Hello?"</p><p><em>"Hello, good evening,"</em> the man said warmly.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, a little nervous. "I saw your sign in front of the shop next to The Witches Road, and I'm interested in renting it, or maybe even… buying it? If possible."</p><p>There was a slight pause on the other end. <em>"The rent is a flat $1,500. As for the purchase, I'd have to take a look at it myself, but do you have an offer in mind?"</em></p><p>Rio took a moment, her mind racing back to the numbers Alice had helped her figure out. "Maybe... $180,000?"</p><p><em>"Hmm,"</em> the man said. He paused, then chuckled. <em>"Deal.”</em></p><p>Rio's breath hitched. "That easy?"</p><p><em>"I know I'm selling it for a lower price, but that sign has been there forever,"</em> he explained, a warmth in his voice. <em>"My wife, who is pregnant, and I were just waiting for this shop to finally be rented—or purchased, like you offered. If it wasn't you, I don't think we would sell it at all."</em></p><p>A genuine smile spread across Rio's face. "Well, congratulations! I'm glad I could help somehow."</p><p><em>"Can we meet up tomorrow to finalize everything?"</em> he asked.</p><p>It was real. She was going to have her shop. "Yes, I'm available."</p><p><em>"Alright. I'll text you the details tonight,"</em> he said.</p><p>"I'll be waiting." Rio said, already getting up from her bed.</p><p>
<em>"Have a good night."</em>
</p><p>"You too." With that, Rio ended the call, her heart pounding with a thrilling mix of excitement and disbelief.</p><p>She spent the rest of the night walking around her house, a giddy smile plastered on her face. She kept replaying the conversation with the man, the kindness in his voice, the way he had practically given her a gift. It felt like the universe was telling her she was on the right path.</p><p>The next morning, she woke up with the same feeling of electric anticipation. She went through her morning routine in a daze, her mind already at the shop, arranging flowers and talking to customers. The text from the owner arrived right on time, giving her the details for their meeting. She dressed with a new sense of purpose, choosing an outfit that felt both professional and true to herself.</p><p>When she arrived at the shop, the owner was already there, a kind-faced man in his late 30s. He shook her hand warmly, his smile reaching his eyes. "You must be Rio," he said. "I'm Chris."</p><p>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Chris," she said.</p><p>He unlocked the front door, and they stepped inside. The space was even better than she remembered. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The worn brick walls felt less like a flaw and more like a canvas.</p><p>"It needs some work," Chris said, "but it's got good bones. We were going to fix it up, but then the baby came along, and we just knew we had to sell."</p><p>Rio nodded, her mind already buzzing with ideas for renovations. "It's perfect," she said, almost to herself.</p><p>They went over the paperwork, and Rio didn't hesitate. She had her financial advisor's number on speed dial, ready to make the purchase official. Within an hour, the deal was done.</p><p>
<em>Rio was a business owner.</em>
</p><p>She stood alone in the empty shop, the key clutched tightly in her hand. The silence was deafening, but it wasn't an empty silence. It was a silence filled with possibility, with hope, with the quiet promise of a future she was finally building for herself.</p><p>That night, Rio was so exhausted she could barely keep her eyes open, but she couldn't go to bed. She was a business owner now, and there was so much to do. She sat on her couch with her laptop, doing research, making lists, and dreaming up a business plan. She was lost in her own little world of inspiration when her phone buzzed. It was a text from Agatha.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I'm sorry for being so quiet. I was nervous about everything, but I'm ready to talk now</em></p><p>Rio smiled, a genuine, tired, and deeply happy smile. She put her laptop down and picked up her phone.</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> I'm so glad. I was so worried about you.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I know. You didn't push me, though. I really appreciate that</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> I would never.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Can I call you? I don't want to talk about it over text</em></p><p>Rio's heart fluttered in her chest.</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> Yes, please.</p><p>The phone rang, and Rio didn't hesitate. She picked it up, her voice a little shaky but full of warmth. "Hi."</p><p><em>"Hi,"</em> Agatha's voice was soft, almost a whisper. <em>"I'm sorry. I just... I got scared. After our date, I felt so happy, and that scared me. I didn't know what to do."</em></p><p>Rio's heart ached for her. "I get it. It's a lot. But I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere."</p><p>"I know," Agatha said, her voice a little stronger this time. <em>"And I'm so glad you're not. I just... I don't want you to think that I don't want you. Because I do. So much. I just need time."</em></p><p>Rio closed her eyes. "Take all the time in the world. I'll be right here, building my shop."</p><p>Agatha's voice grew curious. <em>"Your shop? What are you talking about?"</em></p><p>Rio smiled, a new kind of confidence swelling in her chest. "I bought it. The building on next to that club—The Witches Road. The one with the worn brick facade. It's all mine."</p><p>There was a long pause on the other end, and Rio could almost feel Agatha's surprise through the phone. <em>"Rio... that's amazing. I'm so happy for you."</em></p><p>"I'm happy for me, too," she said.</p><p>Agatha's voice was full of warmth and admiration. <em>"You did it. You really did it."</em></p><p>"Yeah," Rio said, looking around her house. "I did."</p><p>They talked for a long time, the conversation flowing easily between them, no longer burdened by the unspoken questions that had separated them. Rio told her everything about the shop, the price, the plans, and the overwhelming feeling of purpose that had finally settled inside her.</p><p dir="ltr">When they finally said goodbye, Rio felt a sense of peace she hadn't felt in a long time. She was finally building a life she wanted, on her own terms, with no one to hold her back. And what made her even happier was that in this new garden of hers, she would not have to plant her roots alone.</p>

<p>The next two weeks were a blur of sawdust and paint. Rio became a woman of purpose, trading her laptop for worn-out work gloves and a stubborn paintbrush. She spent her days ripping up old flooring and brushing crisp white over the tired brick walls, her mind already buzzing with ideas for flower arrangements.</p><p>Alice dropped in whenever she could, her encouragement as infectious as her laughter—even if her “help” with a roller usually left more streaks than progress. But it was Agatha who became Rio’s constant. She came every day, sleeves rolled up, her shy smile steady in the whirlwind. Rio had wanted to surprise her with the finished shop, but Agatha’s quiet insistence on helping was a kind of warmth she couldn’t turn away.</p><p>One afternoon, in the cramped storage room, Agatha dabbed an absentminded smudge of paint on Rio’s nose. Rio retaliated instantly, streaking white across Agatha’s cheek. Their laughter rang against the walls—until Agatha leaned in and silenced it with a tender kiss. Rio surrendered, her hands sliding to Agatha’s waist, squeezing gently just to feel her there, solid and close. When they parted, Rio brushed a bit of paint from Agatha’s cheek, while Agatha’s breath caught as if the air had grown too heavy to hold.</p><p>They still hadn’t spoken about the future—hadn’t even stepped into each other’s homes. But Rio knew she was waiting. Waiting for the shop to be ready, for the right moment to invite Agatha over. Waiting for the conversation where they would finally—<em>really</em>—talk about them.</p><p>That moment came on Thursday, after dance therapy. Agatha agreed to come over, though her car had been acting up, so a friend named Jennifer had been giving her rides all week. Which meant this time, Jennifer dropped her off, and Rio got to bring her home.</p><p>The drive was quiet, save for small questions here and there, the kind of silly exchanges that filled the spaces between them. But Rio noticed the way Agatha kept stealing glances at her, as if weighing a question she hadn’t found the courage to voice. At a red light, Rio finally turned, catching her in the act.</p><p>“Whatever you’re thinking, you can ask,” Rio said softly.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her gaze steady now. “Do you ever get scared?”</p><p><em>Yeah, Rio hadn’t expected that one.</em></p><p>She nodded. “All the time,” she admitted, her voice low. “Sometimes I don’t even know what I’m doing, and I get scared because—what if I mess everything up?” The light shifted green and Rio turned back to the road, her hands steady on the wheel. “I used to think fear meant weakness. But now… now I think it’s just the price of building something real.”</p><p>Agatha went quiet, her expression unreadable. Rio risked a subtle glance at her, wishing she could see inside that guarded head, wishing she knew what those words had stirred.</p><p>“Do you get scared?” Rio asked back.</p><p>"Yes," she said, her hands clenching in her lap. "But my fear is different. It's not about what my head thinks. It's about what my body remembers.”</p><p>Rio felt the words land like a physical weight in the car. Her hands tightened on the wheel, and the familiar warmth she felt for Agatha turned into a deep ache of concern. She didn't press for details, sensing the fragile truth in Agatha's confession. The silence between them was filled with understanding—not unspoken questions.</p><p>When they finally pulled into Rio's driveway, the gentle hum of the engine felt too loud. Rio turned off the car and looked at Agatha, whose hands were still clenched in her lap. Rio reached over and gently placed her hand on top of one of Agatha's, careful not to squeeze. "You don't have to tell me anything you're not ready to," Rio said, her voice soft and steady. "But I'm here. For whatever you need, whenever you're ready."</p><p>Agatha's eyes, full of a pain Rio was only just beginning to understand, met hers. A single tear rolled down her cheek, and Rio's heart broke just a little. "Thank you," Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio was the first to step out of the car. She circled around to the passenger side and opened the door for Agatha, extending her hand in quiet invitation. Agatha took it without hesitation, her touch gentle but sure. Their fingers laced together—and stayed that way, warm and certain—until Rio finally let go to unlock the front door.</p><p>Inside, Rio’s house was filled with a different kind of warm than the shop—not the heat of hard work, but the quiet comfort of home.</p><p>“Can I get you anything?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I’m really thirsty,” she said, emphasizing the really.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Let’s fix that,” she said, leading her toward the kitchen. “I’ll give you a tour after we quench your thirst.”</p><p>The kitchen opened into the living room, and Agatha paused, taking it all in. “Wow,” she breathed. “It feels like I’m in a palace.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “You mean the size of the decoration?” Her parents had always been fascinated with Tuscan architecture, so after their passing, Rio had kept the style intact—the only modern touches were the kitchen appliances.</p><p>Agatha walked toward the island. “Everything… it feels like a Renaissance universe.”</p><p>Rio smiled, moving to stand beside her. “Well, that’s because Tuscan architecture was popularized during the Renaissance—and also codified.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head toward Rio. “You know a lot about this style.”</p><p>“My parents were obsessed with it,” Rio said.</p><p>“They were right to be,” Agatha said softly. “It’s beautiful… definitely a dream house.”</p><p>They lingered in each other’s eyes for a moment before Rio returned to the present. “What do you want to drink? I’ve got water, sparkling water, juice, uhh…” she paused, scanning the fridge. “Soda, beer… I don’t have coffee right now, but I can make some if you want.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “You basically have everything.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “You never know when you might need it.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Water is fine.”</p><p>“Alright, boss,” Rio said, grabbing a glass and filling it. She handed it to Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said softly.</p><p>Rio showed Agatha her house—the whole house was Tuscan styled but what Agatha loved the most was the suites, which were in total, four suites.</p><p>She also told Agatha that it took her years to move into her parent’s old bedroom because it felt like she was taking a space that wasn’t hers.</p><p>“Wow, this is insanely huge—like, <em>insanely</em>.” Agatha’s eyes were scanning the whole room. “I’m in love with your house.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “It’s very unique.”</p><p>“In a very cool way.” Agatha added. Her eyes went to Rio’s bed. “What size is thing thing?”</p><p>Rio sat on her bed. “It’s an Alberta king bed.”</p><p>“Another insanely huge thing.” Agatha smiled. Agatha pointed towards the bed, “Can I?”</p><p>Rio nodded eagerly. “Yeah—sure, go ahead.”</p><p>Agatha sat on the bed. “It’s pretty soft too.” hands doing circles on the bedspread.</p><p>Agatha turned to look at Rio. “Was this your parent’s bed?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No, I got a new one. It was hard enough to sleep in their room, imagine in the same bed.“</p><p>“I understand. The only things my mom owned that I kept was the family photos—sometimes I regret donating her things even though that was what she wanted me to do.”</p><p>“What matters is what is in the heart, not in your hands.” Rio’s voice was full of tenderness.</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio as if she were a constellation—a pattern of light and purpose in a vast, dark sky.</p><p>Rio reached for Agatha’s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. “You’re probably hungry, aren’t you?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “A bit. Yeah.”</p><p>“Do you know how to cook?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>Rio got up from the bed and took Agatha with her. “Cool, because we’re cooking together.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Alright.”</p><p>They both walked to the kitchen, hand in hand.</p><p>Rio sat on the kitchen counter. “Okay, let me make it clear, I’m definitely the worst cook ever so we can’t trust my skills in the kitchen.”</p><p>Agatha rolled up her sweater’s sleeves. “Well, good thing we can trust <em>my</em> skills.”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms. “And what can your skills do?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “A lot of things.”</p><p>Oh. <em>Oh.</em></p><p>Rio’s cheek turned red. “Let’s keep those skills in the kitchen—for now.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “What are we making?”</p><p>Ugh, Rio loved when Agatha snorted. She loved a lot of things about Agatha. Their friendship meant a lot to Rio—just as much as it meant to Agatha, who was finally letting herself just… be. <em>But friends don’t kiss the way they do, do they?</em></p><p>Rio hopped off the counter. “I was thinking something easy.”</p><p>“Easy as…?”</p><p>Rio widened her eyes. “Oh. My. God.”</p><p>Agatha squinted her eyes in suspicion. “What?”</p><p>“We’re making mac n cheese!” Rio said, wiggling her hands.</p><p>“Have you ever made it before?” Agatha raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “That’s the thing, yeah—no, I haven’t.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Okay… Have you eaten it before?”</p><p>Rio drew her brows together. “No…”</p><p><em>“WHAT!?”</em> Agatha shouted. She shook her head. “Nah, uh—we’re about to fix this right now.”</p><p>Agatha started going through Rio’s cabinet. “Where do you keep your stuff?”</p><p>Rio came closer to Agatha. “What are we looking for exactly?”</p><p>“Pasta—the elbow one, cheese, milk…” Agatha clicked her tongue. “Onions, these kind of things.”</p><p>Rio opened the fridge. “I have like all kinds of cheese in here—except the smelly ones.”</p><p>Agatha came behind her. “We need cheddar, parmesan and mozzarella—oh and don’t forget the milk.”</p><p>Rio grabbed the ingredients. “Here.” she handed the items to Agatha.</p><p>“Where are the onions?” Agatha said, putting the ingredients on the table.</p><p>“There,” Rio pointed to a little basket near the toaster. “You don’t want garlic?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I’m allergic.”</p><p>“Are you a vampire?” Rio joked.</p><p>Agatha shrugged and smiled. “I may be.”</p><p>Rio slightly bumped her shoulder on Agatha’s. “Well, I was never a big fan of garlic anyway.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks turned a bit red. “Okay, let’s start. Grab a cutting board.”</p><p>“Here,” Rio handed it over to Agatha.</p><p>“I’ll cut the onions and you will grate the cheese. Alright?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Okay but how much?”</p><p>Agatha, without taking her eyes of the onions she was cutting said: “Just grate it and when you think it’s enough, I’ll tell you if it needs more or not. Yeah?”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yeah.”</p><p>Another one of many things she loved about Agatha is how she has never made Rio feel weak or useless, no matter what.</p><p>They made the pasta together, laughing, talking and learning from each other—not just recipes, but about life itself.</p><p>“I think this is the second wonder.” Rio said as she took a bite from the mac n cheese.</p><p>Agatha hummed. “Let me guess, the first one is sushi.”</p><p>“Bingo!”</p><p>Agatha took a sip of her wine. “Totally didn’t expect that one.” she joked.</p><p>“We totally have to make sushi together some day.”</p><p>Agatha nodded eagerly. “We definitely will. We make a great team.”</p><p><em>I know we do.</em></p><p>“The best.” Rio corrected.</p><p>They were on Rio’s bed watching <em>The Conjuring</em>—but unlike Rio, Agatha wasn’t paying attention to the movie at all.</p><p>Her eyes were fixed on Rio, tracing the curve of her cheek, the soft line of her jaw, the way her hair tumbled over the pillow. The flickering light from the screen cast shadows that made every detail of Rio’s face sharper, more alive, and Agatha felt heat pooling in her chest and throat, a fluttering ache she couldn’t ignore. Every inch of her body hummed with attention, every sense alert to Rio.</p><p>Rio noticed the intensity of her gaze and leaned in slightly, just enough for Agatha to feel the nearness of her, and her pulse skipped. It was as if the world had tilted, and all that existed was the quiet magnetism drawing them together.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, a soft, almost vulnerable whisper:</p><p>“Is this what having a partner feels like?”</p><p>The words were out before she could think, yet they felt exactly right—an admission and a question all at once.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer with words. She closed the space with sudden, irresistible force, pressing her lips to Agatha’s in a kiss that was hungry and unrelenting, yet threaded with tenderness. Agatha felt a shiver run through her, a delicious mixture of surprise and longing, the kind that stole her breath and left her dizzy.</p><p>Her hands shot to Rio’s shoulders, then threaded into her hair, pulling her closer, matching the intensity, the hunger, the desperate yet careful passion of the kiss. Every tilt of their heads, every movement of lips and hands, felt like a conversation they didn’t need to speak—an unspoken exchange of need and wonder.</p><p>Agatha’s mind spun, a mixture of awe and disbelief. She’d never imagined something could feel so immediate, so consuming, so <em>right</em>. Every nerve ending sang with desire and affection, her body responding instinctively to the rhythm Rio set, every press and caress a language she had longed to understand.</p><p>Time stretched and folded in on itself; the flickering light, the sound of the movie, the quiet night—everything disappeared. There was only this: two hearts colliding, two breaths mingling, two souls acknowledging something fragile, fierce, and utterly new.</p><p>When they finally pulled back, it was slow, reluctant, their foreheads pressed together. Agatha’s cheeks burned, her chest heaving, her eyes locked with Rio’s in silent understanding. Every shiver, every flutter, every ache of longing lingered in the space between them, a quiet testament to the kiss that had said everything words never could.</p><p>Agatha held Rio’s hand. “I have to go, it’s getting late. Jen will probably be here soon.” she said warmly.</p><p>“Maybe you could stay?” Rio asked soft and hesitant. “We can go to the shop in the morning, if you’d like—unless you’re busy.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression was unreadable. Rio’s panic began to rise.</p><p>“There’s a guest room if it’d make you more comfortable.” Rio added immediately.</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “It’s not about the room, I don’t have any clothes or even a toothbrush with me.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “You can wear mine and I have a spare toothbrush.”</p><p>“Yeah? If I won’t bother you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened. “You would never bother me. If you did, I wouldn’t have invited you to stay.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly. “I’ll stay.”</p><p>“Do you…” Rio hesitated. “Do you want to stay in my room?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yes, I do.”</p><p>Rio gave Agatha one of her baggy shirts and they laughed together of how big the shirt looked on her. Rio also gave her a purple toothbrush—Agatha’s favorite color.</p><p>When they returned to the bedroom, Rio climbed into her side of the bed. The lights were low, leaving the room in a soft, warm glow. Agatha hesitated for a moment, looking at the large bed as if it were a new, unknown land.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio said gently, sensing her hesitation. “There’s plenty of room.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and climbed in on the other side. She settled in, pulling the blankets up to her chin. The air was quiet, filled only with the soft sounds of a house settling for the night.</p><p>“Thank you for today, Rio,” Agatha said, her voice barely a whisper. “For everything.”</p><p>Rio turned on her side to face Agatha, propping herself up on one elbow. “Thank you, too. I didn’t know I needed a partner in crime for mac and cheese, but I’m glad I found one.”</p><p>Agatha’s laughter was a soft, warm sound in the quiet room. “A partner in crime for everything, I think.”</p><p>Rio’s smile lingered, even after Agatha’s laughter faded into the hush of the room. For a long moment, they just looked at each other, shadows and soft lamplight painting their faces in gold. The world outside seemed far away, as if the night had closed itself around them like a cocoon.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened, and she shifted slightly closer, the blanket rustling between them. “Goodnight, Rio,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio reached across the small stretch of sheets, her fingers brushing gently against Agatha’s hand. The touch was light, tentative, but Agatha turned her palm upward, lacing their fingers together.</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha,” Rio murmured back, her voice steady now, though her heart thrummed with a quiet urgency.</p><p>They lay like that, hands entwined, the silence between them no longer heavy but tender, alive. Slowly, their breaths fell into the same rhythm, two hearts learning how to rest in the same space.</p><p>And as the warmth of sleep began to pull them under, Rio thought that perhaps home could be more than just a place.</p><p>It could be a person.</p>

<p>Rio woke to sunlight spilling across her bedroom, warm and golden against the sheets. She turned her head, and there was Agatha—still asleep, lips parted slightly, a loose strand of hair falling across her face.</p><p>She smiled to herself and reached out, brushing the strand away with gentle fingers. Her hand lingered for a moment, careful not to wake her, savoring the quiet miracle of having her there—as if the universe had slipped her a gift she wasn’t sure she deserved, but couldn’t bear to let go.</p><p>Rio slipped out of bed, moving slowly so as not to disturb the quiet moment. She pulled on a comfortable shirt, slid her feet into socks, and padded softly into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio moved around the kitchen quietly, opening cupboards and pulling out plates and mugs. She set a small tray on the counter and arranged everything with careful attention: two mugs, a little pot of coffee, a small plate of toast with butter, and a few slices of fruit. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the room, mingling with the faint scent of the morning sun through the open window.</p><p>Finally, she set the tray on her arm, careful not to tip anything over. Every movement was slow, deliberate, almost reverent, as if she were carrying something precious—and she was.</p><p>Rio carried the tray carefully back toward the bedroom, the warm aroma of coffee and toast mingling with the morning sunlight. She peeked in and saw Agatha still curled under the blankets, hair falling softly across her face.</p><p>Sliding onto the edge of the bed, Rio leaned forward and pressed a tender kiss to Agatha’s cheek, then another soft, teasing kiss to the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Agatha stirred, a sleepy hum escaping her lips as her eyes blinked open. “Mmm… morning,” she murmured, voice heavy with sleep, a small smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>Rio smiled back, brushing a strand of hair from Agatha’s face. “Good morning,” she whispered. “I brought breakfast.”</p><p>Agatha reached out lazily, her fingers brushing against Rio’s hand, letting herself settle into the warmth of the morning—and into the quiet intimacy of being there, together.</p><p>Rio carefully lifted the tray onto her lap, making sure nothing tipped. Agatha shifted slightly, sitting up with a yawn, pulling the blanket around her shoulders. “This looks… amazing,” she murmured, eyes soft and still half-lidded with sleep.</p><p>Rio chuckled quietly. “Well, you’ve got to start the day right, don’t you?” She offered Agatha the plate of toast, brushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>Agatha reached for it, her fingers brushing Rio’s as she took it. “You didn’t have to,” she whispered, but there was a warmth in her tone that made Rio’s heart swell.</p><p>“I wanted to,” Rio said simply, her voice gentle, letting her eyes linger on Agatha’s face. “And I wanted to see you wake up like this… peaceful.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head toward Rio, a small, sleepy smile spreading across her face. “You’re too soft,” she teased lightly, though her voice still carried that morning grogginess.</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning a little closer. “Soft with you. Everyone else… not so much,” she murmured. Her hand brushed against Agatha’s, holding it lightly as they shared the quiet intimacy of the morning.</p><p>They ate slowly, savoring the toast and coffee, but mostly savoring the gentle presence of each other. Every glance, every touch, was tender, unhurried, a quiet kind of connection that made the morning feel infinite.</p><p>Once the toast was gone and the coffee mugs were nearly empty, Rio set the tray aside, brushing crumbs from her lap. Agatha leaned back against the pillows, stretching lazily, the morning light catching the curve of her cheek.</p><p>“You know,” Agatha murmured, a teasing lilt in her sleepy voice, “you make breakfast sound like a full-on ceremony.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, reaching over to tuck a stray strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. “Well… it is a ceremony. A celebration of mornings with you,” she said, voice warm.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a small, contented smile, and she nudged Rio gently with her shoulder. “You’re ridiculous,” she whispered, though the fondness in her eyes betrayed her words.</p><p>Rio leaned closer, letting her hand rest lightly over Agatha’s.</p><p>For a moment, they simply sat there, the soft glow of sunlight and the quiet of the morning wrapping them in a cocoon. Agatha rested her head lightly against Rio’s shoulder, and Rio leaned just enough to let her cheek brush against Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Don’t want to get up just yet,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio chuckled softly. “Neither do I,” she agreed. “We have a whole morning. No rush.”</p><p>And so they stayed like that, fingers intertwined, shoulders touching, letting the warmth of each other and the quiet rhythm of the morning stretch into something infinite.</p><p>“Rio, I have to talk to you.” that was the first thing Agatha said as they sat on the living room couch after a long time spent in bed.</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha, scared of what she’ll say.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “You know, you bought your shop and… umm … I could help with the designs—the graphic designs?” she said in a nervous but hopeful tone.</p><p>Rio blinked. “Really? You’d do that for me?”</p><p>Agatha nodded smiling. “Of course I would, and I will if you want.”</p><p>Rio’s smile went from ear to ear. “That would be really, really good.” she hugged Agatha. “Thank you so much, for everything.” Agatha hugged her back, holding Rio close.</p><p>Agatha pulled back from the hug, but only just enough to look at Rio’s face. There was still that shy little smile tugging at her lips, as if she wasn’t sure if she had overstepped.</p><p>“You don’t have to thank me,” she said softly, brushing invisible dust off Rio’s sleeve to avoid meeting her eyes for too long. “I… I want to. It feels good, being useful.”</p><p>Rio’s heart tightened at the words, at the way Agatha said them like she didn’t quite believe she already was enough just by existing in Rio’s space. “Agatha,” she said gently, her voice dipping into something steadier, firmer. “You are useful. You’re more than that—you’re…” She trailed off, because there was too much to say, too much to name.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, curious, maybe a little uncertain. “I’m what?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then smiled, letting her hand find Agatha’s and squeeze. “You’re someone who makes everything lighter. Easier. You make me want to do things I didn’t even know I wanted before.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, her eyes flicking away quickly, but Rio saw the way the corners of her mouth softened, how she swallowed like she was holding back a reply she couldn’t quite let out.</p><p>Instead, Agatha shifted closer on the couch, their knees brushing. “So… you’ll let me help?” she asked, her tone lighter now, trying to keep the mood from tipping into something too heavy.</p><p>Rio laughed softly. “If I say no, will you pout?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her chin, feigning indignation. “I don’t pout.”</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning in until their noses almost brushed. “Oh, you definitely pout.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a reluctant smile, and for a moment, the air between them felt charged, delicate, as if one wrong move would shatter it.</p><p>Rio leaned back before she could do something reckless. “Then yes,” she said, her voice warm. “I’d love for you to help. You’d make it… ours. Not just mine.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at that, her expression flickering into something Rio couldn’t quite read—surprise, maybe even a little wonder. “Ours,” she repeated softly, as if trying the word on her tongue.</p><p>Silence fell for a moment, comfortable but filled with something unspoken. Agatha broke it with a small laugh, leaning her head against the back of the couch. “Then I guess you’re stuck with me.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened as she reached over, letting her fingers brush lightly over Agatha’s hand again. “Good,” she said quietly. “That’s exactly what I want.”</p><p>Agatha shifted a little, pressing more firmly against Rio’s as she settled into the cushions. Rio still hadn’t let go of Agatha’s hand. Her thumb traced slow, absent circles over her skin, like she was memorizing it. Agatha didn’t pull away—in fact, she leaned into the touch, her shoulders easing as if she’d been carrying tension she hadn’t even noticed.</p><p>“You know,” Rio said after a moment, her voice gentle, “I don’t think I’ve ever let anyone help me like this before. Not with something that matters so much.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, watching her carefully. “Why not?”</p><p>Rio gave a soft shrug, eyes flicking down to where their hands were joined. “I guess… it always felt safer to do everything on my own. If I don’t rely on anyone, then there’s nothing to lose, right?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, and for a second, she didn’t know what to say. But then her hand squeezed Rio’s, just enough for Rio to look back at her.</p><p>“You can lose things anyway,” Agatha said quietly, her voice steady but threaded with something deeper—experience, maybe even grief. “But sometimes, letting someone in… it makes it worth it.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened at the words, at the way Agatha’s eyes softened when she said them, as if she wasn’t just talking about the shop at all.</p><p>“Worth it,” Rio echoed softly, her gaze lingering on Agatha’s face.</p><p>For a long moment, neither of them looked away. The air between them seemed to stretch thin, fragile as glass, yet unbreakable at the same time.</p><p>Then Agatha smiled faintly, breaking the tension with a softer tone. “Besides,” she said, nudging Rio’s shoulder lightly, “I have good taste. Your shop will thank me.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, shaking her head. “Oh, so this is purely selfish on your part?”</p><p>“Completely,” Agatha teased, her smile growing just a little wider.</p><p>But then her laughter faded into something gentler, her voice dropping. “And… maybe not.”</p><p>Rio’s hand tightened over hers, grounding her, holding her there.</p><p>“You’re not selfish, Agatha,” Rio said softly. “Not even close.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted like she wanted to argue, but she didn’t. Instead, she leaned a little closer, their shoulders brushing, her voice barely above a whisper. “Then maybe I just… want to belong to something good.”</p><p>Rio’s heart ached at that—tender, fierce all at once. She tilted her head until her temple rested lightly against Agatha’s, closing her eyes for a moment.</p><p>“You do,” she whispered back. “You already do.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. Instead, she let her eyes fall shut, her head tipping just slightly until it rested more fully against Rio’s shoulder. Rio stayed still, barely breathing, afraid that any sudden movement might shatter the delicate weight of the moment.</p><p>The quiet stretched between them, not uncomfortable but full—like the air itself was holding them. Their hands stayed linked beneath the blanket, thumbs brushing slowly, their breaths gradually falling into rhythm.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes too, allowing herself to sink into the rare peace of it. For so long, her mornings had been empty, quiet in a way that gnawed at her. Now, this quiet felt different—it was alive, warm, shared.</p><p>After a while, Agatha murmured, “You’re warm.” Her voice was so soft it was almost swallowed by the stillness, but Rio heard it, and it made her smile.</p><p>“Good thing,” Rio whispered back, turning her head just enough that her cheek brushed Agatha’s hair. “I’m your personal heater now.”</p><p>That earned her the smallest huff of laughter, muffled against her shoulder. Agatha shifted, curling just slightly closer beneath the blanket. “I could get used to this,” she admitted, her tone lighter, teasing—but her hand tightened over Rio’s in a way that said more.</p><p>Rio’s chest swelled at the words, at the vulnerability tucked behind them. “You should,” she murmured, glancing down at Agatha with a grin tugging at her lips. “Because I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her face up then, not quite meeting Rio’s eyes, but close enough that Rio could see the faint pink touching her cheeks. “You sound too certain,” she said, trying for playful, though her voice came out softer than she meant it to.</p><p>“I am certain,” Rio replied, her gaze steady, voice low and warm. “About this. About you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her, caught between disbelief and something softer—hope, maybe. Then she nudged Rio again, shaking her head with the faintest smile. “You’re impossible,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio grinned, squeezing her hand. “And yet, here you are.”</p><p>Agatha finally let out a laugh—small but genuine, light spilling through the cracks of her guardedness. She leaned her forehead against Rio’s shoulder, shaking her head. “Ridiculous woman,” she muttered.</p><p>“Your ridiculous woman,” Rio teased softly, before she could stop herself.</p><p>The words lingered in the air, heavier than she’d meant them to be.</p><p>Agatha froze for the briefest second, her hand stilling in Rio’s. But then, slowly, she relaxed, a small smile brushing over her lips where Rio couldn’t see.</p><p>The silence that followed stretched, delicate but not brittle. Rio’s heart thudded a little too hard in her chest, her mind replaying her own words—<em>your ridiculous woman</em>—as if she could rewind time and swallow them back down.</p><p>Rio swallowed, her voice quiet when she finally spoke. “Sorry. That just kind of slipped out.”</p><p>Agatha shifted, not pulling back but tilting her head slightly so that Rio could see her eyes—still tired, still soft, but sharper now, searching. “Why are you sorry?”</p><p>Rio blinked, caught off guard. “Because I don’t want to push you,” she admitted. “I don’t want to… say too much too soon.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment, her expression unreadable. Then, almost imperceptibly, she shook her head, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “You talk too much,” she murmured, her voice gentle, almost amused.</p><p>Rio let out a small, shaky laugh, relief flooding her chest. “Yeah, probably.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand, grounding her. “But… I don’t mind it. Not when it’s you.”</p><p>Rio’s smile faltered into something softer, her throat tightening at the words. For a second, she didn’t know what to say, so she didn’t. She just leaned her head against Agatha’s, their temples brushing, letting the silence say everything else.</p><p>They stayed as they were—warm, close, suspended in a moment that felt fragile and infinite all at once.</p><p>It was Agatha who finally broke the silence, her voice low, careful. “I… like this,” she said simply.</p><p>Rio smiled, her eyes closing as she breathed her in. “Me too.”</p><p>Rio leaned back slightly on the couch, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face. She glanced at Agatha, whose eyes were still warm and sleepy from the morning light.</p><p>“So… how about lunch?” Rio asked gently, her voice soft, teasing just enough to hide the little flutter of nerves she felt. “I mean, we could go out. Somewhere… not too far. Just you and me.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, her lips parting slightly as she processed the invitation. For a moment, she said nothing, just let her eyes rest on Rio’s. Then a small, tentative smile curved her mouth.</p><p>“I… I’d like that,” she said quietly. Her voice was calm, but Rio caught the faintest lilt of excitement beneath it.</p><p>Rio grinned, feeling a little lighter all of a sudden. “Great. I know a place—nothing fancy, just… good food and maybe a little sun. Perfect for two lazy mornings like this.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, still smiling softly. “Lazy mornings… yes, I think I could get used to that.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, leaning a little closer. “Then it’s a date. Well, not a date-date—unless you want it to be,” she added, a teasing glimmer in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha’s smile widened, warmth pooling in her chest. “I think… I’d like it to be a date,” she admitted, the words soft but steady.</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped. She reached out, brushing her thumb across Agatha’s hand. “Then it’s a date,” she whispered, letting the simple phrase hang between them, full and unhurried.</p><p>They lingered on the couch a little longer, savoring the quiet intimacy before the world outside nudged them forward. Even the idea of leaving the apartment felt lighter because they’d be together—just the two of them, stepping slowly into this new rhythm.</p><p>“Do you want me to drop you off so you can change for lunch?” Rio asked, now both in Rio’s pool area. “I promise I won’t peek.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, quirking an eyebrow. “Oh, you promise?” she teased, voice playful but her cheeks warming slightly.</p><p>“I swear,” Rio said, holding up a hand in mock oath. “Scout’s honor.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, shaking her head. “Fine… but only because my car decided to abandon me.”</p><p>Rio opened her door, holding out her hand. “Come on, let’s go. I’ll wait for you inside.”</p><p>They stepped into Agatha’s apartment together. The space smelled faintly of fresh citrus and sun-warmed stone. Soft terracotta walls caught the morning light, linen curtains swaying gently in the breeze from the open windows.</p><p>“Wow… it’s so… you,” Rio said, her voice filled with quiet admiration. “It’s warm, light… like you brought the sun inside.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a small, shy smile. “Thanks… I like it here,” she said softly. “It’s… quiet. Comfortable.”</p><p>Rio leaned against the doorframe, brushing her fingers along the edge of her seat absentmindedly. “Comfortable sounds nice,” she murmured. “But I have to warn you… I do tend to pace when I wait.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, heading toward her bedroom. “Pace all you want. I’ll be quick,” she said, tossing a casual glance over her shoulder.</p><p>“Quick is relative,” Rio called after her. “And by relative, I mean slow.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, disappearing into her room. “Patience is a virtue.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly and wandered into the living area, perching lightly on the edge of the couch. She let her gaze wander, taking in Agatha’s Mediterranean-inspired apartment—the soft mosaic tiles on the kitchen backsplash, the little pottery figurines lining the shelves, the sunlight spilling across the terracotta floors. It felt… hers, and somehow, Rio’s heart lifted just being there.</p><p>Minutes passed, filled only with the muffled sounds of Agatha moving around her bedroom. Then a sound of Agatha clearing her throat brought her back to reality.</p><p>“Ta-da!” Agatha called, stepping out in a light, airy blouse and low-rise jeans, hair styled just slightly differently than the morning.</p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up. “Wow… you clean up nicely,” she said, letting a teasing grin slip onto her face.</p><p>Agatha gave a small smirk, pretending to be offended. “Clean up nicely? I’m practically blinding you with my radiance,” she teased, one hand on her hip.</p><p>“Oh, absolutely,” Rio said, stepping closer. “I might need sunglasses just to survive this glow.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, twirling slightly. “Careful, or I’ll start charging a cover fee.”</p><p>“Worth every penny,” she murmured, her voice low, warm.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks tinged pink.</p><p>“Shall we?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, linking her arm through Rio’s as they moved toward the door. “Lunch,” she echoed, voice warm. “I can’t wait to see where you’re taking me.”</p><p>“Patience,” Rio said, smiling as she held the door open. “All in good time. But I promise… it’ll be worth it.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “I’m very patient.” she said as she looked the door.</p><p>“Are we getting there?” Agatha said, already anxious.</p><p>Rio laughed. “So much for being patient.”</p><p>Agatha put her hands up. “Can’t blame me for being hungry.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Don’t worry, we’ll be there soon.”</p><p>“My stomach is basically talking to me—begging me for food.”</p><p>Rio hummed. “It will be quiet in just a few minutes.”</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio and smirked. “I think I already know where we’re going.”</p><p>Rio fake gasped. “No, you don’t.”</p><p>“Yes, I do.” Agatha said, fake checking her nails.</p><p>They stopped at a red light, Rio turned to Agatha. “Then tell me.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Nope.“</p><p>Rio slightly bumped her arm into Agatha’s. “So you don’t know.”</p><p>Agatha bumped back. “I do know, I just want to see if I’m right.”</p><p>Rio just stared at her, waiting for Agatha to tell Rio her guess.</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “Fine.” she smiled. “We’re going to eat sushi.”</p><p>Rio let her head fall back, out of disappointment. “Damn it.” she muttered. “It was supposed to be a surprise.“</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Look, Ri, sushi is our favorite food so it was pretty obvious.” she grabbed Rio’s hand, intertwining their fingers. “I will still enjoy it as much as if it were a surprise because it’s <em>you.</em> I’ll be with <em>you.</em>”</p><p>Those words echoed in Rio’s chest long after the light turned green. She squeezed Agatha’s hand, unable to stop herself from murmuring, “Then I guess it’s already perfect.</p><p>When they pulled into the little sushi place, Rio shut off the engine but didn’t get out immediately. She lingered, her eyes drifting to Agatha’s profile—her hair catching the sunlight, the faint contentment on her face as she looked through the window.</p><p>“It’s nothing fancy,” Rio said, suddenly aware of her own nerves. “But… it’s special to me. I only ever bring people here if they mean something.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head, her eyes softening as they met Rio’s. “So this is… special access?”</p><p>Rio swallowed, her smile tilting crookedly. “More like… sacred territory.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a knowing smile. “Then I’ll take care of it.”</p><p>Something tightened sweetly in Rio’s chest. She almost leaned in right there, but instead she laughed softly and got out of the car, circling around to open Agatha’s door.</p><p>“Smooth,” Agatha murmured as she stepped out, though her blush betrayed her.</p><p>Rio leaned in close, her voice low. “Only for you.”</p><p>Inside, the restaurant was warm and quiet, lantern light glowing like amber. The hostess led them to a small table by the window, where sunlight spilled in like liquid gold.</p><p>Rio pulled out Agatha’s chair, earning another playful look.</p><p>“You’re really laying it on thick,” Agatha teased, settling into her seat.</p><p>Rio just smiled, leaning down to whisper before she sat. “You deserve to be spoiled.”</p><p>Agatha froze for half a heartbeat, then looked away, her smile soft and flustered.</p><p>As they looked over the menu, Rio leaned closer, pointing. “Their spicy tuna roll is incredible. And the miso soup? Tastes like coming home.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, glancing sideways at her. “You’re very persuasive.”</p><p>Rio met her eyes, her tone turning gentle. “Only because I want you to have the best.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard again by the tenderness. For a moment, she just looked at Rio, really looked, and the air between them grew quiet, heavier.</p><p>“I do trust you,” Agatha said finally, her voice soft but steady.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. She wanted to joke, to keep things light—but instead, the truth slipped out before she could stop it. “Then I hope you know… I won’t ever let you down.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, as if she might answer, but then she only smiled, a small, glowing thing that went straight through Rio’s ribs.</p><p>Rio leaned back, but her heart was still pounding. She realized then, as she watched Agatha tuck a strand of hair behind her ear, that she wasn’t just happy Agatha was there. She was falling. Slowly, deeply, without even meaning to.</p><p>The waiter left them with tea and menus, and Rio leaned her chin into her hand, not even pretending to study the page.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Agatha said without looking up.</p><p>Rio blinked, caught, then grinned sheepishly. “Guilty.”</p><p>Agatha finally glanced up, raising a brow. “At least you admit it.”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Rio shrugged, her voice turning softer. “If there’s something beautiful in front of me, I’d rather look at it than at a menu.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, her playful retort faltering for just a second. She busied herself flipping the page, though the corners of her mouth tugged upward. “You’re something,” she muttered.</p><p>“Something beautiful,” Rio teased before she could stop herself.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked up sharply, and Rio felt her own pulse stutter. She almost backtracked, but Agatha only shook her head with a quiet laugh. “You really don’t know when to quit, do you?”</p><p>“Not when it comes to you,” Rio admitted, her voice low but sure.</p><p>When their miso soup arrived, Agatha blew gently at the steam rising from her bowl. “So this is the famous hug in a cup?”</p><p>Rio smiled, watching her. “Try it. Tell me I’m wrong.”</p><p>Agatha sipped, her eyes fluttering shut for a moment. “Mm… okay. Maybe you’re not wrong.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, chin on her hand again. “You look like you just melted.”</p><p>Agatha opened one eye, smirking. “Don’t get cocky.”</p><p>“Too late,” Rio said, laughing softly. “I’m taking credit for that smile.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she was still smiling, softer now.</p><p>The sushi rolls came next, neatly arranged on a wooden board. Rio picked one up with her chopsticks and held it out across the table.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “You’re really going to feed me in public?”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “Unless you’re too shy.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her chin stubbornly. “I’m not shy.”</p><p>“Prove it,” Rio teased.</p><p>Agatha leaned forward and took the bite from her chopsticks, her lips brushing lightly against the wood. Rio’s heart did a strange flip in her chest as she watched her chew.</p><p>“Well?” Rio asked, her voice huskier than she meant.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, then smiled, slow and deliberate. “Worth it.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, but her chest was too full, her hand tightening on the chopsticks like they might steady her.</p><p>They ate slowly, trading bites and laughter. Rio caught herself memorizing the way Agatha’s eyes softened when she laughed, the way she tucked hair behind her ear when she got flustered.</p><p>At one point, Agatha caught her staring again and narrowed her eyes playfully. “What?”</p><p>Rio smiled, unguarded this time. “Nothing. Just… I like this. I like <em>you</em> like this.”</p><p>Agatha’s teasing faded into something quieter. She set her chopsticks down, fingers brushing the edge of her plate. “You keep saying things like that.”</p><p>“Because I mean them,” Rio said simply.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a small, almost shy smile. “You’re dangerous when you’re honest.”</p><p>Rio leaned closer, her voice low, steady. “Then I’m going to be very dangerous with you.”</p><p>Agatha lowered her gaze, but her hand slid across the table until her fingers brushed against Rio’s. She didn’t pull away.</p><p>Rio’s heart raced, the sushi momentarily forgotten. She turned her hand palm up, letting Agatha’s settle there, her thumb brushing lightly over her skin.</p><p>The silence stretched, warm and full. Finally, Agatha spoke, her voice soft. “This is… nice.”</p><p>Rio smiled, her throat tightening as she answered. “It’s more than nice. It feels like… the start of something I don’t ever want to end.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, but she didn’t let go.</p><p>They stepped out of the restaurant, the afternoon sun warm against the sidewalk. Rio walked a little slower than usual, not wanting the moment to end.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her. “You’re quiet now.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “I’m just… full. Food and you. It’s a lot to take in.”</p><p>Agatha gave a short laugh, shaking her head. “You’re incorrigible.”</p><p>“And yet you keep laughing at my terrible lines,” Rio said, tilting her head.</p><p>“Only because you deliver them with those ridiculous eyes,” Agatha murmured, almost to herself.</p><p>Rio stopped for half a second, heart skipping. “Ridiculous eyes?”</p><p>Agatha kept walking, but her lips curved. “Don’t make me repeat it.”</p><p>Rio caught up, her shoulder brushing lightly against Agatha’s. “I like when you say things like that. You don’t realize how… dangerous you are to me.”</p><p>Agatha’s steps slowed. “You are dangerous to <em>me.</em>”</p><p>“Every time you smile, I fall a little harder,” Rio said quietly. “And I don’t think I mind the fall.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, searching, as if weighing how much of Rio’s honesty she could handle. Finally, she exhaled softly. “You shouldn’t say things like that in the middle of the street.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Why not?”</p><p>“Because,” Agatha said, her cheeks coloring, “someone might see me blush.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, brushing her hand against Agatha’s briefly, like an accident that wasn’t one. “I like the blush. It means I got to you.”</p><p>Agatha tried to glare but failed, her lips twitching into a smile.</p><p>They reached Rio’s car. She opened the passenger door for Agatha, leaning on it with a crooked grin. “I could get used to this—feeding you sushi, making you blush, walking too slowly so the day lasts longer.”</p><p>Agatha slid in, but before Rio closed the door, she looked up at her with eyes that held something softer. “Careful, Rio.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Careful of what?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice dropped, almost a whisper. “You might actually win me over.”</p><p>Rio froze, her chest tightening, but she managed a smile. “That’s exactly the plan.”</p><p>When Rio slid in, she looked at Agatha and gulped. “Agatha,” Rio began, her voice unusually quiet, almost hesitant, as if trying to test the words before letting them escape. Agatha glanced at her, curious.</p><p>“I… uh…” Rio swallowed, her fingers tightening slightly on the steering wheel. “This is going to sound sudden, maybe a little crazy, but… I have to say it.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, her eyebrows knitting slightly, sensing the seriousness in Rio’s tone. “Okay…”</p><p>Rio exhaled, then met Agatha’s eyes. “I’ve been… thinking a lot. About us. About… every moment we’ve shared, every laugh, every quiet morning, every time I’ve watched you smile and felt… I don’t know… like the world stopped just for us.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard, the warmth in her chest quickening. “Ri…” she started softly.</p><p>“Wait, wait, let me finish,” Rio said, leaning forward in her seat, voice trembling slightly despite her best attempt at calm. “I… I want you to know that being with you—being close to you, sharing mornings, lunches, sushi runs, the dance therapy… it’s made me realize something.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, eyes wide, but she stayed silent, letting Rio speak.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, heart hammering. “I… I don’t want to just… keep seeing you. I don’t want to just… fall in love with you slowly, secretly, day by day, and never say it. I…” she paused, her voice breaking a little. “I want you. I want you fully. I want you with me. And I know this is sudden, and maybe it’s crazy, but… Agatha, would you… be my girlfriend?”</p><p>The words hung in the air, heavy and trembling with all the weight of Rio’s heart.</p><p>Agatha froze. Her eyes widened in shock, her mouth opening and closing as if she were trying to catch the right words but couldn’t. Silence stretched between them, the faint hum of the city outside filling the gap.</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened. She swallowed hard, panic creeping in. “Agatha? Did I… did I say something wrong?” Her voice faltered, a hint of desperation creeping in. “I—I mean, you don’t have to say yes. I just… I needed you to know. I thought… I thought you might feel the same, but if you don’t… I’ll understand. I—”</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha finally breathed, her hand lifting slowly to touch Rio’s arm, grounding her. Rio’s heart jumped, her panic spiking, afraid of the answer.</p><p>“I… I just…” Agatha’s voice wavered, soft, hesitant. She blinked, swallowing against the sudden lump in her throat. “I… wasn’t expecting that. I… I need a moment.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted. “A moment? Okay… okay, I can wait. Take all the time you need. I just…” She trailed off, panic tightening around her chest like a vice. “I thought maybe you wouldn’t… want that. That maybe—maybe I scared you off. And I just… I can’t lose this. Not you. Not this… us.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened, a faint sheen of emotion glimmering. She took a slow, deliberate breath, and Rio’s hands, still gripping the wheel, tightened in nervous anticipation.</p><p>Finally, Agatha’s lips curved into a small, tentative smile. “Rio…” Her voice was trembling, quiet, vulnerable. “I… I wasn’t expecting that… but…” She took another breath, meeting Rio’s eyes directly now, soft and steady. “I want that too. I… I just didn’t know if it was… okay for me to hope you felt the same.”</p><p>Rio blinked, relief crashing through her in a rush so sudden it made her dizzy. “You… you mean it?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her smile growing, a mixture of shyness and warmth, like a sun breaking through clouds. “Yes. I… yes, I want to be your girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio’s chest felt like it might burst. She reached across the console, taking Agatha’s hand in both of hers, holding it as if never letting go could keep the moment from ending. “Really?” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.</p><p>“Really,” Agatha confirmed, a soft laugh escaping her, mingled with a hint of disbelief at her own happiness.</p><p>Rio leaned forward, pressing her forehead gently against Agatha’s, letting their hands stay intertwined, breaths mingling, hearts syncing in the quiet intimacy of the car. “I… I like you, Agatha,” she murmured, almost breathless. “So much. And now… now I can finally say it out loud, and you… you’re mine.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile softened, eyes glimmering as she pressed her forehead against Rio’s. “And you’re mine,” she whispered back. “I… I like you too, Rio. So damn hard.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, her forehead still resting against Agatha’s. “Good. Because I was starting to panic thinking you’d say no.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, tilting her head to look at her. “No chance. You’re… impossible to resist, Rio.”</p><p>“And yet,” Rio murmured, her lips brushing against Agatha’s temple, “you did. And now… you’re mine.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, a soft, full sound that made Rio’s heart soar. “Yes, I guess I am.”</p><p>And in that afternoon light, with the city humming quietly around them, Rio realized something: she had fallen, truly and completely, and Agatha… Agatha had fallen too.</p><p>“I know we were supposed to go to the shop but…” Agatha started. “Can we go to your house?”</p><p>Rio froze, in a good way. “Yeah—we can.”</p><p>Rio started the car, the engine humming softly as the sunlight dipped lower, painting everything gold. She stole a glance at Agatha, whose eyes were fixed on her hands, twisting the seatbelt nervously.</p><p>“Ready?” Rio asked, trying to keep her voice steady, though it trembled just a little with excitement.</p><p>Agatha nodded, lips pressed together, a small, shy smile tugging at the corner. “Yeah… I just… I want to be with you.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened at the words, warmth pooling low in her stomach. “You’ve got me,” she said softly. “All yours.”</p><p>The drive was quiet, comfortable, the city blurring past. Every so often, their hands brushed, lingering just a heartbeat longer than necessary, sending sparks up Rio’s arm. Agatha didn’t pull away. Rio noticed. She noticed everything—the way Agatha’s eyelashes lowered when she looked away, the faint catch in her breath when their knees bumped, the tiny, shy smile she gave when Rio’s fingers grazed hers under the console.</p><p>When they arrived at Rio’s house, Agatha stayed in the car for a moment, letting the silence stretch, as if savoring it. Rio glanced at her. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, finally meeting her eyes. “Yeah… I just… I’m… happy. And a little nervous. In a good way.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, shaking her head. “You’re adorable when you’re nervous.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks warmed at the praise, and she let herself laugh, a soft, airy sound that made Rio’s chest ache. “Maybe… maybe I just like being with you too much,” she admitted, voice low.</p><p>Rio leaned closer, close enough that Agatha could feel her breath. “You don’t have to hide it,” she whispered, fingers brushing against Agatha’s hand again. “I feel the same way.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, but she didn’t lean in—not yet. Instead, she rested her head lightly against Rio’s shoulder, letting the closeness speak for them both. Rio’s heart nearly stopped at the simple touch, at how perfect and right it felt.</p><p>“Come on,” Rio murmured, voice thick with emotion, “let’s go inside before I start embarrassing myself with all the things I want to say.”</p><p>Agatha giggled, letting Rio take her hand. “Okay… lead the way,” she said, a warmth in her voice that made Rio grin from ear to ear.</p><p>They stepped out of the car together, fingers entwined, the afternoon glow wrapping them in a quiet, private world, a world that suddenly seemed a little brighter because they had found each other.</p><p>Rio opened the door to her house, stepping aside so Agatha could enter first. The familiar scent of home greeted them, warm and comforting, yet somehow different now—charged with the weight of their conversation in the car.</p><p>Agatha paused in the doorway, her eyes scanning the space quickly, then back at Rio. “Can we skip the living room this time?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, heart skipping a beat. “Skip it?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a small, shy smile. “Yeah… can we go straight to the bedroom?” Her voice was low, hesitant, yet firm enough to carry intention.</p><p>Rio swallowed, feeling a flush rise to her cheeks, and nodded. “Of course… yeah, we can do that.”</p><p>They moved down the hallway together, the house quiet except for the faint hum of the city outside. Agatha’s hand brushed against Rio’s side as they walked, a light, grounding touch that made her pulse quicken.</p><p>When they reached the bedroom door, Rio hesitated for a moment, fingers lingering on the handle. She glanced at Agatha, her eyes soft but serious. “Are you sure…?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was steady, though her chest felt like it was trying to leap out. “I’m sure. With you, I’m always sure.”</p><p>Rio let out a small breath, then pushed the door open. She stepped inside, moving toward the bed, and Agatha followed, closing the door behind them. The room was bathed in the golden light, the space familiar yet somehow more intimate now, carrying the quiet thrill of something unspoken, something waiting between them.</p><p>Agatha perched on the edge of the bed, her fingers tracing the soft folds of the sheets. “I… I like this,” she murmured. “Being here, with you… it feels right.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, her gaze locked on Agatha’s. “It does. So right.”</p><p>For a long moment, they just stood there, the quiet stretching around them, both aware of the closeness, both savoring the anticipation of what came next.</p><p>“You look like you need to sit,” Rio said, guiding her toward the bed. “Come on, just rest a little.”</p><p>Agatha sat, fingers tight on her knees, and for a moment, stayed still, trying to breathe through the sudden spike of tension. Her mind raced with warnings, memories she hadn’t wanted to recall tonight—but the warmth of Rio’s presence kept her from fleeing.</p><p>Rio leaned closer, brushing a strand of hair from Agatha’s face, unaware of the storm behind her eyes. “You’re so beautiful,” she murmured. “I can’t… I just can’t stop looking at you.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, a small shiver running through her. She wanted to lean in, wanted to close the space between them, but instinct whispered caution. She pressed her hands into her lap, gripping her own clothing to ground herself.</p><p>“May I…?” Rio’s voice was soft, hopeful, as she tilted her head, not realizing the tiny hesitations hiding behind Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>Agatha nodded, barely, trembling under the pressure of wanting closeness and fearing it at the same time. “Yes.” she whispered, almost to herself.</p><p>Rio smiled, thinking it was simple shyness, and let her hand rest lightly against Agatha’s. The faint brush made Agatha inhale sharply, heart hammering. She froze, gripping the sheets, caught between desire and panic.</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Rio said, leaning closer, voice gentle. “Just… stay here with me.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, eyes flicking to Rio’s with a mixture of trust and fear. She wanted to melt into her, wanted to let herself feel everything—but part of her remained on guard, silently screaming that closeness could hurt. Still, she stayed.</p><p>Rio, unaware, smiled and leaned in further, brushing her lips near Agatha’s hairline in a tender gesture. Agatha’s breath hitched, a soft gasp she tried to hide, and she pressed a hand to her own chest. Her mind was screaming, but her body betrayed her, leaning ever so slightly toward Rio despite the fear.</p><p>Rio lowered herself onto the bed, and Agatha followed, her hands trembling slightly as she pressed herself close—but not too close. Her chest thudded painfully, both from desire and a creeping tension she couldn’t quite control.</p><p>Their lips met softly at first, tentative, like testing the waters, but even that simple touch sent a jolt through Agatha’s body. She pressed her hands to Rio’s chest, trying to stay grounded.</p><p>“Agatha… you’re shaking,” Rio whispered, her forehead resting against Agatha’s, voice soft. “Hey, tell me what you need. Please.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her throat tight. “I… I don’t know,” she admitted, voice barely audible. “I want this. I want you. But…” Her hands tightened in the fabric of her shirt. “…I can’t stop thinking. Memories. Things I… I don’t like thinking about.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, heart catching in her throat. “Oh… oh, honey. I didn’t know. I—” She hesitated, unsure, then pressed a gentle hand to Agatha’s cheek. “You don’t have to do anything. You just… tell me. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. She had wanted to reach for Rio, to feel the closeness they’d been building all evening, but her body was screaming caution. “I… I was… hurt,” she said, voice breaking. “Before… someone—someone did things to me. And now…” Her hands moved to cover her face. “I can’t… I can’t just… I’m scared I’ll feel it again.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened with guilt and fear for her, but she moved closer, letting their foreheads touch, fingers brushing Agatha’s arms lightly. “Shh… it’s okay. You’re safe now. I promise. I’m not them. I would never hurt you.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, leaning slightly into the warmth of Rio’s chest. Tears pricked her eyes, and she whispered, “…I’m scared I’ll push you away. I… I don’t want you to leave. But sometimes… I just can’t stop my body from remembering.”</p><p>Rio tightened her embrace, brushing her lips gently over Agatha’s temple. “I’m not going anywhere. We’ll go at your pace. I’ll follow you anywhere you need me to. We can stop anytime, slow down, or just stay like this.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands moved to Rio’s back, tentative, testing the waters, feeling the weight of trust forming. “I… I want this,” she admitted, voice trembling. “I want to be close. I want… you. But I need… I need to be able to breathe, too. To know I’m not in danger.”</p><p>Rio nodded, understanding immediately, letting her lips linger near Agatha’s ear. “I get it. We’ll breathe together. I’ll stay right here. Every step. I promise.”</p><p>For a long moment, they lay like that, Agatha pressed softly against Rio, the heat and closeness mingling with careful boundaries. Then, slowly, Agatha lifted her head and met Rio’s eyes. “Kiss me,” she whispered, almost a plea, voice shaking.</p><p>Rio smiled softly, brushing her lips against Agatha’s with tender care. Agatha responded, leaning in cautiously, letting the warmth and trust slowly replace the tension. Her hands explored gently, tentative, over Rio’s shoulders, memorizing the safe feel of her body.</p><p>Rio held Agatha close, afraid she’d broken the moment. “Tell me what’s wrong. You don’t have to explain if you’re not ready. I just want you safe.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, tears slipping free. “I… I can’t… I’m scared you’ll leave me if I tell you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart cracked. She pressed her lips to Agatha’s hair, holding her tightly. “I would never leave you. Never. You can tell me anything, or nothing at all. I’ll stay right here. Always.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled shakily, letting the panic ease into the comfort of Rio’s arms. “I… I want this. I want you,” she whispered, her voice trembling but firm. “But… in my timing.”</p><p>“We’ll go as slow as you need. We don’t have to do anything.”</p><p>Agatha sniffed. “My mom died four years ago. Remember?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yes.”</p><p>“There was… there was a funeral for her.” Agatha sniffed again. “There were lots of people there—people I didn’t even know.</p><p>Rio started to run her hand through Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“My mom’s best friend was there too. They were really close, she was always there during my birthdays, family dinners—everything, and of course, the funeral wouldn’t be any different.”</p><p>“I was doing the speech that day. The speech I had to practice so I wouldn’t stumble my words in front of all those people.”</p><p>“When I finished the speech, I couldn’t hide my tears anymore. So I went to the bathroom.” Agatha paused. “And that was the worst decision I could’ve ever made.”</p><p>Rio already knew what was coming next, so she brought Agatha closer to her.</p><p>“I went to the bathroom that was upstairs, in my bedroom and since it was my bedroom I didn’t lock the door.” her eyes started to tear up.</p><p>“I… I was there sat on the toilet crying when the door opened — it was her.”</p><p>“She came inside the bathroom asking if I was ok and then, she locked the door.”</p><p>“I was telling her that the whole things was too much for me and that I couldn’t stay there any longer. Then she… kneeled down to my level with her smiley face and then hugged me saying everything was okay.”</p><p>“I hugged her back—immediately hugged her back. She was basically a second mother to me, she was there since I was born.”</p><p>“When we pulled apart, she pulled me off the toilet and put me against the wall. The smile on her face still there—but it was different.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice began shaking. “She said…” the tears started falling from her eyes. “…She said she’d make me feel better.”</p><p>“Her hands were on my shoulders but in a blink, one of her hands went lower while the other went over to my mouth, to shut me.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. “I told her to stop. I did.” Agatha hid her face in the crook of Rio’s neck. “She kept going.”</p><p>“She kept saying things like “I know you’re enjoying it because you’re moaning” or…” Agatha was trying so hard to hold her tears as much as possible.</p><p>Rio hugged Agatha really close. “Agatha, it’s alright, you don’t have to say it.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I want to. I <em>need</em> to.”</p><p>“She also said… I always knew that’s how… how I’d feel like around her fingers.”</p><p>“And that kept going for a long time until my uncle knocked on the bathroom asking if everything was alright in there.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, but the smile didn’t reach her eyes. “I’m glad he showed up because I don’t know what else could’ve happened.”</p><p>After Rio was a hundred percent sure Agatha finished telling her what happened that day, she asked: “Where is she now?”</p><p>“I don’t know. But she’s not here anymore.”</p><p>Rio exhaled. “Lucky for her.”</p><p>Rio was never a type of woman to have thoughts about killing someone but now she’s not so sure she can say that.</p><p>Agatha looked straight into Rio’s eyes. “I’m sorry for telling you this now and not sooner.”</p><p>“I understand if you don’t want me anymore.”</p><p>Her hands trembled as she gripped the edge of the bed, fingers digging lightly into the fabric to ground herself. “I… I was scared,” she whispered, voice cracking. “Scared you’d… leave. Scared I’d ruin… what we have.”</p><p>Rio’s thumbs brushed softly over her cheekbones, tracing gentle circles. “You’re not ruining anything,” she murmured. “Nothing could make me leave. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere, Agatha. Promise.”</p><p>Tears welled in Agatha’s eyes, and she blinked rapidly, trying to fight them back. She let out a shaky breath, her shoulders tensing as memories flickered behind her eyes. “It wasn’t… it wasn’t supposed to happen. I thought… I thought I’d be safe. I thought…” Her voice faltered, and she pressed her palms against her own thighs, trembling.</p><p>Rio leaned closer, resting her forehead lightly against Agatha’s. “Shh… it’s okay,” she whispered, letting her warmth envelope her. “You’re safe now. I’m right here. We can breathe together. I won’t let anything happen to you.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened around Rio’s wrist, anchoring herself in the present. “I… I want to feel close to you. I want this,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper, “but… I need to go slow. I can’t… I can’t push past the memories too fast.”</p><p>Rio nodded, letting her hands remain on Agatha’s face and shoulders, her eyes soft and steady. “We’ll go slow. Every step you need, I’ll follow. No rush. No pressure. Just us, right here, right now.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, letting herself lean just a little closer, enough to feel Rio’s heartbeat through the closeness. Her body still trembled, but the warmth of Rio’s arms made the fear easier to bear. “I… I’m scared,” she admitted. “Scared I’ll… remember everything, and I don’t want… I don’t want to push you away.”</p><p>Rio pressed her lips to the top of Agatha’s head, holding her gently. “You won’t push me away. Not now, not ever. We’ll face it together. One moment at a time.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes briefly, letting herself absorb that comfort.</p><p>“I promise,” Rio replied softly, leaning close again. “Slow. Gentle. Only as fast as you feel safe.”</p><p>Agatha let herself rest against Rio, trembling a little less, allowing the closeness and trust to start softening the tension she’d carried for so long.</p>

<p>Ever since that night at Rio’s house, Agatha felt lighter. The weight that had clung to her chest for years had loosened, leaving space for something gentler, something alive. She carried herself differently now—straighter, steadier, even a little brighter. For the first time in a long while, she recognized herself in the mirror without quickly looking away.</p><p>Two weeks later, sitting across from Wanda after their last group session, she found herself saying words she never thought she’d be brave enough to speak.</p><p>“I think… I think I’m ready to stop coming,” Agatha said, her voice steady but soft. “Not because I don’t need it anymore—but because I finally feel like I found what I was looking for.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head, her kind eyes searching her face. “And what is that?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved faintly, almost shy. “Peace.”</p><p>Later that evening, back at Rio’s house, Agatha couldn’t shake the thought. Home wasn’t just Rio’s arms or her smile—it was the quiet strength she had begun to find in herself. Still, as she curled up on the couch with Rio, a movie forgotten on the screen, there was one thing she hadn’t yet voiced.</p><p>Rio shifted closer, draping an arm across her shoulders. “You’re quiet tonight,” she murmured, pressing a kiss into Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Agatha’s heart picked up. She turned toward Rio, chest tight, words swelling like a tide she couldn’t control. Say it. Just say it.</p><p>Her lips parted, breath trembling. “I lo—”</p><p>Her courage faltered. The word shattered on her tongue, replaced by something safer. “…I love this. Being here. With you.”</p><p>Rio smiled warmly, squeezing her hand. “Me too.”</p><p>Agatha leaned into her shoulder, hiding the sting of what she hadn’t been able to finish. She knew Rio hadn’t noticed—but her heart did. She wasn’t afraid of Rio anymore. She was afraid of what those three words would mean—how they would make everything real, permanent, unshakable.</p><p><em>Next time,</em> she told herself. <em>Next time I’ll let them out.</em></p><p>That night, long after the movie ended and the house had gone still, Agatha lay awake. The room was hushed, bathed in shadows, the only sound the faint rhythm of Rio’s breathing beside her.</p><p>Rio slept on her back, one arm draped across Agatha’s waist like an anchor, her face soft in the dim light spilling through the curtains. She looked so peaceful, so unguarded, that it made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>Agatha turned onto her side, careful not to wake her, studying every detail—the curve of her lips, the faint crease between her brows, the way her hair fell over her forehead. She wanted to touch her, to trace every line, but instead her hand hovered, trembling, before settling back against the sheets.</p><p>The words rose again, fierce and unstoppable. Her lips parted, whispering into the quiet.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>The air seemed to shift, her chest tightening with both relief and fear. She said it again, softer, as if repeating it could make it easier. “I love you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio stirred slightly but didn’t wake. Her arm tightened faintly around Agatha, as if replying in her sleep—and that nearly broke her.</p><p>Agatha pressed her face into Rio’s shoulder, voice cracking. “I wish I was brave enough to tell you when you’re awake.”</p><p>Her eyes stung, but she didn’t cry. She stayed wrapped in Rio’s warmth, clinging to the safety of the dark—knowing that sooner or later, she’d have to find the courage to say it in the light of day.</p><p>That week, Rio’s shop was finally opening. Agatha helped with marketing, designs, and finances.</p><p>She had planned to tell Rio she loves her on the inauguration day—<em>really</em> tell her. Was she scared? <em>Yes.</em> Scared that Rio might not feel the same way, even though she knew Rio cared deeply. She wanted it to be after the inauguration so the event wouldn’t be ruined if things went wrong.</p><p>Opening day arrived. Everyone was at Rio’s place. Alice was eating the chocolate cake Agatha had baked with Rio the day before. Jen was giving a self tour of the house and Agatha was on Rio’s room helping her pick an outfit.</p><p>“Is this one appropriate?” Rio asked, holding up a button-up shirt and jeans.</p><p>Agatha hummed thoughtfully. “Yeah, it looks nice.” She smiled. “For shoes, I think you should wear the green Converse—the ones I gave you.”</p><p>“Too basic?” Rio pouted.</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Flower shops should feel welcoming. If you overdress, people won’t feel that connection.”</p><p>Rio leaned in slowly, squishing Agatha’s cheeks playfully and stealing a quick peck. “So smart…” she murmured, face still close.</p><p>Agatha grinned. “I know.”</p><p>Rio teased, “It’s a shame it’s my shop opening. I wanted to do other things.”</p><p>Over the past weeks, Agatha had grown more confident with Rio—who was always patient, always making sure she felt safe. It was a progress she cherished, made even more special because it was with someone she loved deeply.</p><p>Rio changed, fixed her hair, and joined the living room, bonding with the others while Agatha finished getting ready.</p><p>Jen was telling a story from her high school days. “There was this girl I liked… we went into the bathroom together, and… well, we were doing <em>things.</em> Then the classroom “star” saw us and snitched.”</p><p>Alice raised her eyebrows. “Wow, not what I expected.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Me neither.”</p><p>Jen shrugged. “I got grounded for a month, but we’d sneak out to meet and do well… stuff.”</p><p>Agatha arrived in the living room, and Rio froze. All she could see was Agatha in the light sage green satin dress, soft shine catching the light, thin straps, draped neckline, gentle ruching at the waist, long straight skirt with a high slit—bold, perfect, entirely Agatha.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Alice snapped her fingers. “Rio? Earth to you.”</p><p>Jen laughed. “Distracted much?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “What do you think?”</p><p>“It’s… I—” Rio struggled for words. “It’s perfect.”</p><p>“Thank you, Miss Vidal.” Agatha teased.</p><p>Jen stood. “Let’s go before she drools all over the couch.”</p><p>Rio walked over to Agatha, hand resting on her waist. “This dress… it’s doing things to me,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha leaned close. “That was the intention.”</p><p>Jen grimaced. “Private moments… inside, please.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Says the girl who fucked someone in a school bathroom.”</p><p>“I was seventeen!” Jen defended herself.</p><p>Alice held up her hands. “She’s got a point.”</p><p>Agatha tugged Rio toward the door, Rio’s hand still on her waist, warmth and quiet intimacy lingering between them.</p><p>They stepped into the shop together, the bell chiming softly behind them. Sunlight poured through the windows, illuminating the fresh flowers, ribbons, and vases arranged with Rio’s usual care. Agatha’s eyes swept over everything, a smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>“This is all you…” she murmured, more to herself than anyone else.</p><p>Rio shrugged, cheeks tinged pink. “Had a little help,” she said, glancing at Agatha with that familiar warmth that made her chest flutter.</p><p>Alice and Jen were already mingling with the first visitors, complimenting every little detail. Agatha felt the nervous excitement building—not just from the shop opening, but from standing here, close to Rio, her hand brushing the small of her back as they moved through the space.</p><p>Rio leaned closer, her breath warm against Agatha’s ear. “You’re quiet,” she murmured. “Thinking about something?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks warmed. She bit her lip, letting a small smile slip. “Maybe,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio smirked, the kind of knowing smirk that always made Agatha’s heart skip. “Maybe’s dangerous,” she said softly, fingers brushing against Agatha’s waist. “Keeps me guessing.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse quickened, but she kept her gaze steady, determined not to let her feelings slip too soon. She could feel Rio’s warmth through that small touch, the subtle pressure of her hand, and it made her chest ache in the sweetest, most complicated way.</p><p>Over the next hour, they floated through the shop together—Rio charming the customers, Agatha quietly ensuring everything ran smoothly. They shared small smiles, lingering touches, and playful nudges, all while the room buzzed with excitement around them. Each time Rio’s hand brushed hers or she rested a palm on Agatha’s waist, Agatha’s heart leapt, but she stayed silent.</p><p><em>Soon,</em> she reassured herself. <em>Soon, I’ll say it.</em></p><p>Even without the words, the intimacy between them was unmistakable—an unspoken language of glances, touches, and shared laughter that made the shop opening feel like their private world, even amid the crowd.</p><p>Agatha watched Rio guide a customer to a display, her chest swelling with pride and love.</p><p>By the time the afternoon sun streamed through the windows in golden rays, Rio and Agatha found themselves alone for a quiet moment. Rio leaned back against the counter, hand brushing against Agatha’s as they both reached for a small bouquet. Their fingers lingered together, just long enough to send shivers down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>“You’re amazing,” Rio said softly, looking into her eyes. “Everything’s perfect.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, letting her heart swell without speaking the words she longed to. “You’re amazing too,” she whispered instead, a subtle brush of her lips against Rio’s hand sending a thrill that didn’t need explanation.</p><p>The sun was already down and when Alice and Jen, along with all the customers, had gone home, it was just Rio and Agatha.</p><p><em>I’ll tell her. I’ll ter her now.</em></p><p>Rio was in the storage room, checking on the flowers when Agatha went inside.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said softly, her voice almost swallowed by the hum of the shop closing down around them.</p><p>Rio turned, mid-step, and smiled. “Hi.”</p><p>Agatha shifted on her feet, hands twisting nervously in front of her. “I… I need to talk to you.”</p><p>Rio froze, a flicker of unease crossing her face. “Yeah?” she asked cautiously, her voice low but steady.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her chest tight. She had spent weeks, months even, rehearsing this in her head, yet now that she was here, finally alone with Rio, the words felt impossibly heavy. “I’ve been holding something in for a long time,” she said quietly. “And I can’t anymore. I… I can’t not say it.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, her hand brushing against Agatha’s. “Okay,” she said gently. “Whatever it is, you can tell me. I’m listening.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart thudded, a frantic drumbeat in her chest. She looked down at their hands, fingers touching lightly, a simple contact that sent heat rushing through her. She wanted to take a step back, to hide, but she couldn’t. Not now.</p><p>“I…” she started, faltering, the words threatening to catch in her throat. She drew a shaky breath, eyes locking with Rio’s. “I love you.”</p><p>The shop seemed to stop around them. The faint smell of flowers, the lingering sunlight on the polished floors, the half-finished arrangements—all of it faded behind the weight of the words.</p><p>Rio blinked, stunned, her hand lingering on Agatha’s. Then slowly, deliberately, she stepped closer, closing the small gap between them. Her thumb brushed against the back of Agatha’s hand, warm, steady, grounding. “You… love me?” she asked softly, almost like she couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha whispered, her voice catching slightly. “I’ve loved you for a long time. I’ve… been scared. Scared of what it would mean, scared I’d lose you if you didn’t feel the same. But I can’t hide it anymore. I love you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes glistened, soft and bright, and her smile was slow, wide, filled with something tender and certain. She slid her hand to Agatha’s waist, resting it there with a weightless confidence. “I love you too,” she said.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. Relief, joy, disbelief—all tangled together. Her hands lifted, trembling slightly, and she pressed them gently against Rio’s chest, feeling the steady heartbeat beneath her palms. “I didn’t think I’d ever be able to say it,” she admitted quietly.</p><p>“Me neither,” Rio whispered, leaning in closer, her forehead brushing Agatha’s. “But you did. And now… now it’s real.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips trembled, a soft laugh escaping her. “It feels… unbelievable.”</p><p>“It feels real,” Rio said, her voice low, intimate. She leaned down, letting her lips brush lightly against Agatha’s temple, then the tip of her nose, teasingly close but not yet a kiss. “And I’ve wanted this for so long,” she admitted, fingers tracing gentle, lazy circles on Agatha’s back.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head up, meeting Rio’s gaze. “I’ve wanted this too,” she said, voice stronger now, more certain. “More than I realized.”</p><p>Rio smiled, a little teasing, a little tender, and finally closed the distance, brushing her lips softly against Agatha’s. It was a featherlight touch at first, testing, savoring, before deepening ever so slightly. Agatha leaned in fully, melting into the warmth, letting her hands rest on Rio’s shoulders as if anchoring herself to this moment.</p><p>They broke apart just enough to look at each other, foreheads still touching, breaths mingling. “You have no idea how long I’ve waited to hear you say that,” Rio murmured.</p><p>“I didn’t think I’d ever have the courage,” Agatha admitted, still pressing close. “But I had to. You’re too important to me.”</p><p>Rio’s hand cupped the side of her face, thumb brushing lightly across her cheek. “You’re too important to me,” she whispered back. “I’ve loved you too, Agatha. <em>Always.</em>”</p><p>A silence fell over them, comfortable and intimate, the kind of quiet that only comes when words are no longer necessary. They stayed like that for a long moment, pressed together, hands intertwined, hearts syncing without needing to say more.</p><p>Finally, Agatha rested her head on Rio’s shoulder, letting herself relax fully, her chest finally unclenching. “I love you,” she repeated softly, as if saying it again could make it sink in even deeper.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio echoed, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. “I always have. And I always will.”</p><p>The shop around them buzzed faintly with leftover energy from the day, but for Agatha and Rio, the world had narrowed down to just the two of them. Warmth, love, and the quiet certainty of finally being open with one another wrapped around them like a soft, unbreakable blanket.</p><p>For the first time, Agatha felt completely, undeniably… home.</p><p>And for Rio? Rio didn’t feel vulnerable. She felt <em>unstoppable.</em></p>
