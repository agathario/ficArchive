<h2 class="heading">Chapter 1</h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p1">She can hear the alarm going off in the hallway and in the apartments below hers. Beeping. Shrill and constant.</p><p class="p1">“Oh hell,” Agatha whispers under her breath.</p><p class="p1">There’s no worse time for her apartment complex to catch on fire than <em>tonight</em>, when she’s supposed to be writing the final chapter of her new novel, the one her editor has been harassing her to finish for weeks now.</p><p class="p1">Well, there goes her peaceful night on the couch, she thinks, already annoyed as she stands and starts grabbing the essentials.</p><p class="p1">Passport. IDs. Devices. Birth Certificate..</p><p class="p1"><b>Shit.</b> <b></b></p><p class="p1">She can smell smoke already.</p><p class="p1">In the chaos of her gathering her things now five minutes have passed already and she still hasn’t gotten out.</p><p class="p1">She hears the sirens now, faint but growing louder. The fire trucks are here. They're downstairs.</p><p class="p1">Alright, what else?</p><p class="p1">She moves quicker, stuffing more into her emergency bag.</p><p class="p1">“The manuscript. Shit!” she mumbles, eyes darting around. “Where the hell did I put it?”</p><p class="p1">Smoke’s already curling under the door. The air feels thick. Visibility is dropping fast.</p><p class="p1">Heat radiates through the walls and floor. She feels it even through her shoes.</p><p class="p1">Then a lightbulb moment, through the haze in her head. Top shelf of the bookcase. She shoved it there to keep it safe from coffee spills a few days ago.</p><p class="p1">Her body already feels heavy, every breath like breathing through cotton. Her eyes sting, and her lungs fight for every inhale.</p><p class="p1">Still, hell if she’s losing that manuscript now.</p><p class="p1">She coughs hard as she reaches up, stretching toward the highest shelf.</p><p class="p1">Another cough tears through her chest. One hand clutches her ribs. “God fucking damnit, why did I put the damn thing that high up?” Her voice is hoarse. Cracked. Now mad at herself for a decision that made sense at the time but is now an inconvenience in the ass.</p><p class="p1">She stumbles. The smoke is thicker now, her balance off. She tries to stand again, determined, but the dizziness pulls harder this time.</p><p class="p1">Then.. she collapses.</p><p class="p1">She doesn’t even realize it at first. Her cheek hits the floor near the bookcase, body hit the floor <b>hard</b>. Emergency bag still slung over one shoulder.</p><p class="p1">Eight minutes since the alarms started. Her limbs are too heavy now. Her body doesn’t respond the way it should. She can’t open her eyes anymore and she hears only the high pitched ringing in her ears and her own shallow breaths.</p><p class="p1">And then—</p><p class="p1"><b>CRASH.</b> <b></b></p><p class="p1">Her door slams open. Wood splinters. There’s shouting, but distant, muffled. A woman’s voice cuts through the ringing. It’s strong. Sharp.</p><p class="p1">Probably searching for survivors.</p><p class="p1">Agatha still can’t open her eyes. She groans, barely audible. That’s all she can manage.</p><p class="p1">Seconds later, she's being lifted, scooped up into someone’s arms like she weighs nothing. The sudden motion makes her dizzy again, but she feels warmth. Movement. A steady grip.</p><p class="p1">They move fast through the stairwell. Several flights. Her head lolls to the side. She feels cold air hit her lungs like a slap.</p><p class="p1">She’s outside.</p><p class="p1">Saved.</p><p class="p1">The world around her starts to return in broken pieces. Light. Noise. Cold. The beeping in her ears starts to fade. Her vision sharpens just enough to catch a glimpse, just a <em>blur</em> of a face leaning over her. Helmet off now. Eyes locked on hers.</p><p class="p1">A woman.<br/>
A <em>gorgeous</em> woman, Agatha realizes in a foggy haze.<br/>
Broad shoulders. Defined jaw. Sweat slicked skin. Messy strands of dark hair stuck to her forehead.<br/>
Too beautiful.</p><p class="p1">God. This is so embarrassing.</p><p class="p1">She’s not even fully conscious, and she’s already flustered. Great.</p><p class="p1">Jen is never going to let her live this down.</p><p class="p1">The firefighter lowers her onto what feels like a medical cot or stretcher. An oxygen mask covers Agatha’s face, cool and tight.</p><p class="p1">There’s a mess of noise around her, tenants being treated for their injuries and smoke inhalation, first responders putting the fire out and rushing to keep the building from collapsing.</p><p class="p1">Within two minutes, the fog in her head starts to lift. Her breathing evens out. Her hearing comes back. But her mind’s still spinning.</p><p class="p1">The firefighter’s voice breaks through gently,</p><p class="p1">“Hi. Hey. You’re okay. You’re safe,” the firefighter says softly.<br/>
A pause.<br/>
“You were out for a bit. Breathe in through the mask. Nice and slow, alright?”<br/>
Then, with a slight chuckle,<br/>
“You’ve got a hell of a dramatic streak, huh? i carried you down ten floors.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s stomach twists again, but for a different reason.</p><p class="p1">Her eyes flick up.</p><p class="p1">The woman is smiling at her.</p><p class="p1">And oh what a beautiful smile..</p><p class="p1">Her voice, her face, <em>everything</em> about her is unfair.</p><p class="p1">Her eyes are so beautiful and unique.</p><p class="p1">That’s the first actual thought Agatha has with a clear head.</p><p class="p1">Ew. What the hell was that, she scolds herself immediately.</p><p class="p1">Focus.</p><p class="p1">“My bag,” she mumbles under the mask.</p><p class="p1">The firefighter leans closer. “Sorry, ma’am? Say that again?”</p><p class="p1">“My bag,” Agatha repeats, sharper.</p><p class="p1">“Oh, the one on your shoulder? Yeah, it’s right next to you. You didn’t let it go. Had a death grip on it, actually.” She sounds almost impressed.</p><p class="p1">But still...</p><p class="p1">Shit.</p><p class="p1">She never got the manuscript.</p><p class="p1">Agatha groans and closes her eyes, lifting a shaky hand to her face.</p><p class="p1">The firefighter’s tone shifts quickly. “Are you in pain? What’s wrong?”</p><p class="p1">That’s when it hits her.</p><p class="p1">Now that the adrenaline is gone, the pain rises fast and brutal.</p><p class="p1">Her elbow.</p><p class="p1">God. Her elbow.</p><p class="p1">She gasps and groans through gritted teeth, still half breathing through the mask.</p><p class="p1">“Fuck. Fuck. Ow,” she rasps.</p><p class="p1">The firefighter’s eyes sharpen instantly.</p><p class="p1">“Where?” she asks, already moving.</p><p class="p1">Agatha winces and points weakly with her good hand.</p><p class="p1">“Okay, don’t move it,” the woman says quickly. “Let me take a look—”</p><p class="p1">Her gloved hands are gentle, surprisingly so.</p><p class="p1">She mutters under her breath, mostly to herself:<br/>
“Yup. Damn. That’s definitely broken.”</p><p class="p1">Then, louder, “Alice! Over here!”</p><p class="p1">Another firefighter rushes over, crouching beside them and inspecting her arm.</p><p class="p1">After a minute or so, she looks at the firefighter who saved her and says, “Rio, she’s got a severe displaced fracture at the elbow. Needs immediate transport.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha barely hears anything after that. Just the key words:<br/>
Fracture. Surgery. Hospital.</p><p class="p1">“What?” she croaks under the mask, panic blooming in her throat.</p><p class="p1">“Don’t worry, ma’am,” the firefighter, Rio, says, her voice gentler now. “We’ll get you the help you need.”</p><p class="p1">She turns to her partner. “Alice, call another ambulance over. Now.”</p><p class="p1">A few minutes pass. The oxygen mask is off. The ambulance is ready. Agatha’s breathing picks up again, shallow and fast. Panic pushing at her ribs.</p><p class="p1">She hates hospitals.</p><p class="p1">She hates being alone in hospitals even more.</p><p class="p1">As they begin to roll her toward the ambulance, she reaches out instinctively, her good hand searching until it catches onto someone’s wrist.</p><p class="p1">It’s hers.</p><p class="p1">Rio.</p><p class="p1">The woman turns, startled at the touch. Her eyes find Agatha’s again, and Agatha can’t stop herself. She’s scared. Shaking. She feels like she’s going to cry, and she doesn’t care if she sounds pathetic.</p><p class="p1">“Don’t leave,” she whispers. “Please.”</p><p class="p1">Rio stares at her for a long moment.</p><p class="p1">Her eyes soften. Her shoulders drop.</p><p class="p1">She wraps her hand around Agatha’s and gives a firm, warm squeeze.</p><p class="p1">“okay.” she mutters, then calls out, “Alice! I’m going with her.”</p><p class="p1">Alice calls something back, but Agatha doesn’t catch it.</p><p class="p1">Rio lifts her gurney carefully, mindful of her elbow, and climbs into the ambulance beside her. Still holding her hand.</p><p class="p1">“I’m here,” she says quietly.</p><p class="p1">Hand still holding Agatha’s hand in her warmth.</p><p class="p1">Agatha doesn’t know which eye the tear comes from, but in the quiet between panic and pain, she knows. Somewhere in her gut, deep and certain, this woman isn’t just her rescuer. She’s the beginning of something.</p><p class="p1">The last thing she hears is the steady beep of the heart monitor as everything starts to blur again, the pain, the noise, the warmth of Rio’s hand. Then comes the sedative. Then, <b>black</b>.</p><p class="p1"> </p><hr/><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">She wakes up to the beeping of the machines around her.<br/>
Eyes slowly open as she notices her surroundings.</p><p class="p1">She looks down at her body and realizes her arm is now in a brace and elevated. It’s wrapped in layers, non stick dressings underneath, gauze over them, held carefully in place.<br/>
She must’ve had a few burns that needed care.</p><p class="p1">She feels numb all over, but she knows she’s probably still under some pretty strong pain meds at this point.</p><p class="p1">There’s no one sitting in the seat next to the bed though. Which, for some reason, she finds herself disappointed by.</p><p class="p1">A minute later, a nurse shows up in her room.</p><p class="p1">“Hello, Ms. Harkness. Glad you’re finally awake and alert,” the nurse says warmly, looking through the chart at the end of the bed.<br/>
“You were brought in after a fire incident in your complex. Do you remember any of that?”</p><p class="p1">Agatha lets out a hoarse breath. “I do.”</p><p class="p1">“Good,” the nurse nods. “So, you had surgery on your elbow. It went well. You’ve been resting for a few hours. I’m just going to check your vitals now.”</p><p class="p1">She moves to the monitors beside the bed, adjusts a wire, jots something down.</p><p class="p1">“How’s the pain level?” she asks.</p><p class="p1">“Tolerable,” Agatha answers, keeping her voice flat.<br/>
She’s still upset at the fact that she had to deal with this shit alone.</p><p class="p1">Well, that’s what it seemed like to her.<br/>
Until—</p><p class="p1">“Oh! The firefighter who brought you in wanted us to let you know she’ll be back in a few hours, as soon as her shift is over.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha blinks. “What?”</p><p class="p1">The nurse smiles as she adjusts the IV drip. “She didn’t want you to think she left you alone. She actually spent most of the time here in your room, just until about an hour ago when her team needed her back on duty. Sweet girl, that one.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha felt her insides warm up just a little bit at that.</p><p class="p1">Oh.</p><p class="p1">Rio did stay.</p><p class="p1">Why does that feel so good to know.</p><p class="p1">She’s a stranger.</p><p class="p1">Well.. A sexy stranger that saved her life and is probably super strong, Strong enough to carry her down ten flights of stairs.</p><p class="p1">She doesn’t get why Rio fulfilled her promise though.. She really thought she just dropped her off and left after.</p><p class="p1">Afterall.. Agatha was nothing but a stranger to her.</p><p class="p1">Now that she’s awake and stuck here, she figures it’s time to let her friends know she’s in the hospital.<br/>
She grabs her phone, apparently placed conveniently next to her, and calls Jen.</p><p class="p1">“Agatha! What the hell is going on?! I saw the news, there was a huge fire in your neighborhood and I tried calling you but you didn’t answer!”</p><p class="p1">Jen starts the call with a full blown panic scolding.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah… about that... I’m in the hospital, Jen.”</p><p class="p1">“WHAT?! Are you okay? Do you need me to cancel my work thing and come back home early?!”</p><p class="p1">“No, no, calm down, Superman. I just broke my elbow and have a few burns. The fire started a few floors below my place and I may have… spent a few extra minutes gathering my shit and lost track of time and collapsed. But, not to worry, I was found and saved. So don’t pop a vein, I’ll be okay in no time.”</p><p class="p1">“What the <em>hell</em> were you thinking not getting the fuck out first chance you got, dumbass?! Fucking hell, you’re gonna give me a heart attack one of these days.”</p><p class="p1">“Look! I know it wasn’t the best reasoning, but I was trying to get my newest manuscript, which is now completely gone in the fire, by the way. Alison is going to <em>kill</em> me…”</p><p class="p1">“To hell with your fucking editor. You’ll write other best selling books, Agatha. What matters is you made it out alive. And I mean… maybe next time, stop being stubborn and keep a digital copy. Quit it with your nonsense tradition of only keeping physical ones.”<br/>
Jen chuckles at her own point.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, yeah, whatever… Anyway, I’m fine. Everything’s fine. I just wanted to let you know,” Agatha says, trying to reassure her.</p><p class="p1">“Are you <em>sure</em>? I know your ass will never admit it if you actually need help.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha rolls her eyes on the other end. “Yes, Jennifer. All is well.”</p><p class="p1">“And where the hell are you even going to stay since your apartment is now ashes?”</p><p class="p1">“I’ll find an excellent Airbnb to stay at, Jen. Don’t overthink things.”</p><p class="p1">She never grew up with people who cared about her well being, so Jen’s care for her is still something she refuses to accept. It’s easier to brush it off.</p><p class="p1">“Okay, okay, I concede. <em>But</em> fucking call if you need anything, and I <em>mean</em> it, Agatha.”</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I will.”</p><p class="p1">They end the call.</p><p class="p1">Agatha checks her emails and watches some tv for a few hours until a nurse comes in to drop off a tray of food for her. Agatha opens the plate, grimacing at the smell and the way it looks like someone blended beige sadness into the shape of a chicken breast.</p><p class="p1">“That doesn’t look edible.”</p><p class="p1">She lifts her head up so fast it makes her dizzy.</p><p class="p1">Oh. It’s the firefighter. Rio. She remembered her name.</p><p class="p1">She’s standing there in the doorway, still in uniform, a streak of soot across one cheek and her arms. Her <em>very</em> strong, muscly arms. Soft tan skin. Beautiful brown eyes.</p><p class="p1">
<em>God. Focus. Say something, Agatha.</em>
</p><p class="p1">“Uh… yeah. It doesn’t smell any better either,” she answers, trying not to sound like she’s short circuiting.</p><p class="p1">“Sorry I had to leave for a few hours…” Rio says, rubbing the back of her neck, a little sheepish. “They needed me for a third alarm fire across town, but I came back as soon as it was contained. I probably still smell like smoke though, so… forgive me.” She chuckles softly, stepping closer to the bed.</p><p class="p1">“No, it’s fine… I didn’t even know you stayed, until the nurse told me.” Agatha’s voice comes out softer than she means it to.</p><p class="p1">“I promised I would.” Rio smiles at her, warm and sincere. “How’s your arm? They said the surgery went well, so that’s something.”</p><p class="p1">“The doctor hasn’t come in yet actually,” Agatha says, shifting slightly. “But I’m hoping I’ll get an update soon.”</p><p class="p1">There’s quiet for a few seconds.</p><p class="p1">“Oh. I just realized I never introduced myself. I’m sorry,” Rio says, a charming grin on her face. “My name’s Rio. Rio Vidal. I’m a firefighter, well you know that..” She chuckles nervously, “A lieutenant, actually, in Station 15. And I’m very glad you’re okay, Agatha.” She lets out a soft laugh. “Oh, and I know your name because your phone wouldn’t shut up while you were in surgery. Someone named Jen was texting you like twenty times a minute.”</p><p class="p1">“Yea that’s just my friend. It’s fine, I already talked to her.” Agatha waves it off, then pauses. “And… thanks. For, you know… saving my life. And staying with me. I don’t do well with hospitals and you really came through, for a stranger you didn’t know, no less. So… I appreciate it.”</p><p class="p1">“Please. don’t mention it. I mean, it <em>is</em> my job, but more than that, it’s just what any decent person would’ve done. I’m happy to stay as long as you’d like.”</p><p class="p1">“I wouldn’t want to be a burden, you can leave if you wi—”</p><p class="p1">“Agatha,” Rio cuts in gently, “It’s cool, I promise. I <em>want</em> to stay.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s nerves settle a little after that.</p><p class="p1">“Well… as you now know, My name is Agatha. Agatha Harkness—”</p><p class="p1">“Wait. <em>The</em> Agatha Harkness? The famous author?” Rio blinks at her in surprise.</p><p class="p1">Agatha chuckles. “Yeah, well, probably not for long. My newest manuscript went up in flames yesterday…” She grimaces. “Sorry about that, by the way. It probably made your job harder.. carrying me out after I refused to leave without it.”</p><p class="p1">“I mean, I understand it's your life’s work, but please… next time, prioritize yourself,” she pleads with the beautiful brunette on the hospital bed.</p><p class="p1">Agatha feels a surprising warmth inside at Rio’s words.<br/>
“Well, hopefully there’s no next time.. but if there is, I’m just glad I can count on Station 15 to send me their strongest, most beautiful firefighters,” she flirts.</p><p class="p1">Rio instantly turns red, chuckling shyly.<br/>
“You’re trouble, Harkness.”</p><p class="p1">“Maybe I am,” Agatha shoots back, pleased with herself.</p><p class="p1">Just then, the door to Agatha’s room opens and a tall woman in a white coat steps in, interrupting the moment.<br/>
“Ms. Harkness, I’m Dr. Danvers. How are we feeling today?”</p><p class="p1">“Good. Fine. Though… the pain’s starting to come back,” Agatha admits.</p><p class="p1">Rio stays standing beside the bed, listening closely.</p><p class="p1">“That’s normal,” the doctor says. “We’ll give you some more meds in a little bit. For now though, we need to discuss your case.”</p><p class="p1">The doctor glances at the chart, then looks up at Agatha with a calm, practiced tone.<br/>
“Alright, so, here’s where we’re at. You sustained a displaced elbow fracture, which required surgical fixation. The good news is, the surgery went well. We stabilized the joint with pins and plates, and the bone should heal over the next few weeks.”</p><p class="p1">She moves to the side of the bed, gently checking the position of Agatha’s brace.</p><p class="p1">“You’ll be in this brace for at least four to six weeks. You won’t be able to use your arm normally during that time, no lifting, no pulling, not even propping yourself up. After that, we’ll refer you to physical therapy to regain your strength and full mobility.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha nods slowly, absorbing it all, though her stomach sinks.</p><p class="p1">She’s so used to being on her own. Independent. This is going to change her lifestyle so much for the next few weeks..</p><p class="p1">“As for the burns,” the doctor continues, “they’re mostly superficial, nothing too deep, but they still need to stay clean and covered. We’ll be changing the dressings daily while you’re here, but once you’re discharged, they’ll need regular care at home.”</p><p class="p1">A pause. The doctor gives her a gentle smile.</p><p class="p1">“Normally, we’d suggest having someone around to help, at least for the first few weeks. A visiting nurse is one option, or if you’ve got a friend or family member you can stay with while you recover i know your apartment was damaged in the fire...”</p><p class="p1">Before Agatha can even open her mouth, Rio blurts out,<br/>
“She can stay with me.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s head whips toward her.<br/>
“What?” she says, eyes wide.</p><p class="p1">Rio shrugs like it’s no big deal, but the tips of her ears are a little pink.<br/>
“You need someone. Your apartment is ashes, remember? My place is big, I live alone and have an extra guest room. It just makes sense.”</p><p class="p1">The doctor glances between them, then smiles at Rio.<br/>
“That works too. As long as she’s got someone to help her move around and keep the arm stable, I’m fine discharging her in a day or two.”</p><p class="p1">With that, the doctor gives a quick nod and turns to leave but Rio calls her out, “Dr. Danvers, can i have a minute of your time later for a few questions about how to care for Ms. Harkness as best as i can?” She asks the doctor in a hushed voice but Agatha hears it.</p><p class="p1">Is this some guilt thing where Rio feels guilty she couldn’t save her faster or something? why’s she making all this effort for.. me? Agatha thinks to herself perplexed at Rio’s caring nature.</p><p class="p1">After the doctor answers Rio she finally heads out.</p><p class="p1">Once the door clicks shut, Agatha looks at Rio still shocked.<br/>
“You really don’t have to do this. I’ll figure something out. I don’t like being a burden.”</p><p class="p1">“You’re not,” Rio says firmly. “I meant it. I’ve got the space, and it’s only temporary, right? Until your apartment’s back in shape. Think of it like an Airbnb stay.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha hesitates… then sighs, already defeated by the rationality of it.<br/>
“Fine. But I’m only saying yes because it makes things easier.”</p><p class="p1">Rio smirks.<br/>
“Of course. Nothing more.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha rolls her eyes, but she’s smiling now too.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">The nurse comes by five minutes later and gives Agatha more pain meds, which knock her out.</p><p class="p1">She wakes up a few hours later to the door opening. Rio walks in, arms full of what looks like vending machine snacks. Like, twenty of them.</p><p class="p1">Rio notices she’s awake now and smiles sheepishly.<br/>
“Um… I didn’t know what you’d like, so I got you one of everything.” She dumps them onto the bed.</p><p class="p1">Agatha raises her eyebrows.<br/>
“Thanks, I guess.”</p><p class="p1">Rio then pulls out an iPad from her tote bag.<br/>
“I also went home and grabbed a few things to entertain us. I downloaded some movies we can watch.”</p><p class="p1">Rio’s eagerness to please, to make her happy, is honestly kind of adorable. Agatha has to admit that. She's like a puppy.</p><p class="p1">A strong, muscular puppy.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">They sit there all day, watching movies and laughing at the dumbest scenes, snacking on vending machine chips and chocolate.</p><p class="p1">Every once in a while, Agatha glances over at Rio, at how invested she is, how that soft smile never quite leaves her face, and it makes Agatha smile too.</p><p class="p1">She likes her company.</p><p class="p1">She doesn’t feel the need to perform around this beautiful stranger.</p><p class="p1">Is this that gratitude transference thing she read about once?<br/>
Is that why she’s feeling this warm, stupid flutter in her chest every time Rio laughs?</p><p class="p1">She doesn’t know. Not really. But… she <em>wants</em> to know.</p><p class="p1">Because Rio is warm. Kind. Strong.<br/>
Everything Agatha was told a person like that would never want to be near her.</p><p class="p1">Not by society.<br/>
By her horrid mother.</p><p class="p1">But here’s Rio Vidal, the kind, strong firefighter, spending the whole day with her. Making sure she’s cared for. That she’s fed. That she has somewhere to go until her apartment is rebuilt.</p><p class="p1">It makes Agatha feel something dangerous. Something soft.</p><p class="p1">It’s fine.</p><p class="p1">It’s not like this is forever though.</p><p class="p1">She’s only staying with her for a few weeks.</p><p class="p1">What’s the worst that can happen?</p>

<p class="p1">Trying to put on a sweater with a huge brace turns out to be more of a pain in the ass than Agatha anticipated.</p><p class="p1">“Let me help you, Agatha. Come on,” Rio chuckles beside her.</p><p class="p1">“No,” Agatha grunts. “I’ve always been a self sufficient, strong woman, and that’s not changing n—”</p><p class="p1">She twists her only functional arm and immediately yelps, “MOTHERF—”</p><p class="p1">Rio rushes to her and gently stretches the sweater’s neck hole over Agatha’s head, guiding her arms through the sleeves with careful attention to the brace.</p><p class="p1">Agatha pouts. “I hated that.”</p><p class="p1">Rio laughs. “Well, get used to it, because I <em>will</em> be helping you for a while. And it’s just a little while in the big picture, Agatha. Please don’t be stubborn about this. I’ve seen how much worse it can get if you don’t rest and let someone help.”</p><p class="p1">“Fine. Whatever.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha steps into her pants on her own, holding them up awkwardly with her good hand.</p><p class="p1">A nurse walks in, clipboard in hand. “Alright, Ms. Harkness, everything is set up and you’re officially ready to be discharged from the hospital.”</p><p class="p1">The past two days have been exhausting.</p><p class="p1">But Rio stayed by her side every minute she wasn’t on shift and Agatha doesn’t know how to repay this amazing woman who just stumbled into her apartment, saved her life and decided to care for her for no logical reason.</p><p class="p1"> </p><hr/><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">The drive to Rio’s place is quiet.</p><p class="p1">Agatha stares out the window, reflecting on the past few days and how fast everything spiraled. Her life has gone to shit. One moment she was <em>so</em> close to finishing the last chapter of her new book… and now? Now she’s on her way to stay with a stranger because her home burned down.</p><p class="p1">Oh. And she almost died.</p><p class="p1">“We’re here,” Rio says softly.</p><p class="p1">The moment they walk through the door, Agatha freezes.<br/>She blinks. Once. Twice.</p><p class="p1">“Rio, I feel like I’m in the fucking Amazon rainforest,” she deadpans.</p><p class="p1">Rio chuckles. “Yeah, plants are sorta my thing. They make me feel calmer. After a long, hard shift, I like coming home to them and watering them. They’re also great for air quality.”</p><p class="p1">“Very nerdy for a strong, tough firefighter,” Agatha mutters, mockingly.</p><p class="p1">Rio shrugs, smug. “What can I say? I contain multitudes.”</p><p class="p1">“Oh yeah? What are those other multitudes? Nerd documentaries and a collection of something?”</p><p class="p1">Rio stays quiet.</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s mouth drops open. “I <em>knew</em> it!”</p><p class="p1">“Alright, enough. Come on, I’ll show you around.”</p><p class="p1">Rio grabs her hand, like it’s something she’s done a thousand times, and gently leads her through the apartment.</p><p class="p1">She points out the bathroom, kitchen, her own bedroom, and finally the guest room, where Agatha will be staying.</p><p class="p1">“I just changed the sheets and stocked up the bathroom. Sorry we’ll have to share it,” Rio adds, glancing around the guest room and biting her bottom lip. “But I don’t take long to get ready most days, so… hopefully that makes things better.”</p><p class="p1">“Sounds great, Rio. Honestly. I appreciate all of it,” Agatha replies, a little softer, noticing Rio’s nerves.</p><p class="p1">“Alright, well… I gotta get ready for my shift in a few, but take your time settling in. Snoop as much as you want, I don’t mind.” Rio grins. “I get the feeling you’re curious, and the type who likes to be in control of their environment.”</p><p class="p1">She chuckles as she walks out of the room, leaving Agatha alone with her thoughts.</p><p class="p1">A second later, she hears Rio’s bedroom door shut. Then her phone starts ringing.</p><p class="p1">She pulls it out and. oh crap. It’s Alison, her editor.</p><p class="p1">“Alison! Sweetheart, how are ya?” Agatha starts the call, feigning cheer.</p><p class="p1">“Agatha, what is this I’m hearing about you being in an accident? And why haven’t you called me earlier?” Alison snaps.</p><p class="p1">“Oh, it’s not so bad. Just a tiny surgery,” Agatha says, waving her hand like Alison can see it. “Bad news though... the manuscript may have been... in the apartment... as it burned down...”</p><p class="p1">“…<em>WHAT</em>?” Alison yelps. “Completely gone? No other copy? How could you be so <em>reckless</em>, Agatha? You’ve been working on this for <em>months</em>!”</p><p class="p1">“Aliii... come on, calm down. You know me! I’ll make up for it. You’ll have a new book from me soon, I just need a little time to heal my <em>literally</em> broken bones and get back on my feet. Can you do that for me, hon?”</p><p class="p1">She can hear Alison exhale loudly on the other end.</p><p class="p1">“Let me see how much time I can get you,” she says wearily, “but Agatha, I can’t promise anything. The big bosses may drop you if you don’t submit a new book this year.”</p><p class="p1">“Won’t be a problem, darling. Just get me a few more months.”</p><p class="p1">They end the call, and Agatha now feels more stressed than before.</p><p class="p1">“Fucking hell.” She mutters then walks out of her room and looks around. Gym gear, dumbbells, resistance bands, scattered on the floor.</p><p class="p1">Well, of course Rio worked out. It must be a requirement for her job.</p><p class="p1">But the fact that she might now <em>witness</em> said working out...</p><p class="p1">Maybe staying with Rio won’t be so bad after all. She thinks to herself.</p><p class="p1">A few minutes later, Rio steps out of her room. “Here.”</p><p class="p1">She’s holding a pile of shirts and pants in her arms.</p><p class="p1">“Use these until you can get new clothes.”</p><p class="p1">Oh. Right. She has no clothing of her own anymore.</p><p class="p1">Goddammit, she misses that navy blue blazer she wore to every book signing. She <em>loved</em> that blazer.</p><p class="p1">“Thank you,” she murmurs, watching Rio walk into the guest room and set the clothes on top of the dresser before heading back to her own room.</p><p class="p1">She doesn’t close the door.</p><p class="p1">The moment Rio pulls her shirt off, Agatha lets out a tiny gasp.</p><p class="p1">Rio is <em>fully</em> ripped.</p><p class="p1">Abs carved like marble, arms solid and muscled, shoulders broad and confident.</p><p class="p1">And her skin.. soft and glowing like her job isn’t literally <em>fighting fire</em>.</p><p class="p1">Then the pants come off, and Agatha has to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from groaning aloud.</p><p class="p1">Toned thighs, perfect calves.</p><p class="p1">Jesus Christ.</p><p class="p1">She sits frozen on the arm of the couch, just watching as Rio slips into her Station 15 T-shirt and then grabs a pair of uniform pants. She steps into them, pulls the suspenders over her shoulders, then reaches back to snap them into place, her muscles flexing with the twist of her torso.</p><p class="p1">Agatha is sure she’s wet by now.</p><p class="p1">“Enjoyed the show?” Rio asks suddenly, a smirk in her voice but not yet looking her way.</p><p class="p1">“If you didn’t want me to watch I’m sure you would’ve shut the door,” Agatha shoots back, dry as ever.</p><p class="p1">Rio chuckles, grabs her duffel bag, and steps fully into the living room.</p><p class="p1">She locks eyes with Agatha.</p><p class="p1">“And what if I left it open for<em> your </em>benefit?” she says, head tilted, teasing.</p><p class="p1">“I did, by the way,” she adds casually. “What are you going to do about that?”</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s face falls and is rendered silent for the first time in her life.</p><p class="p1">Rio takes pity on the clearly flustered woman and chuckles.</p><p class="p1">“My shift ends at 9 pm, so I’ll be back by then. Fridge is fully stocked up and you’re welcome to anything i have. My phone’s on me the whole time. Text or call if you need anything.”</p><p class="p1">“Umhmm, sure,” Agatha mutters, now pretending like the brunette firefighter didn’t just catch her openly drooling over her body.</p><p class="p1">Rio gives her one last grin before heading out the door and off to her job.</p><p class="p1">Fucking smug, sexy, annoying firefighter.</p><p class="p1">Agatha hates how much this woman is matching her own freak after only knowing her for a few days.</p><p class="p1">She grabs a snack from the fridge, takes her pain meds, and soon feels the drowsiness creeping in.</p><p class="p1">Heading back to her room, she sinks into the bed, finally something soft and quiet after the awful sleep she got in the hospital.</p><p class="p1">Yeah… this bed is very much a welcome thing.</p><p class="p1"> </p><hr/><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">She wakes up to the smell of something that makes her want to drool.</p><p class="p1">Grabbing her phone, she checks the time… damn, it’s 10:22 pm She slept through most of the day, and that mouthwatering smell must be Rio cooking up something for dinner.</p><p class="p1">She steps out of her room and heads toward the kitchen, stopping when she sees Rio, back turned, swaying slightly to music playing in the background.</p><p class="p1">Agatha doesn’t want to interrupt her. Rio looks so in the zone that she just stands there, watching… until Rio senses her presence and turns with a smile.</p><p class="p1">“Oh hey! You woke up just in time,” Rio says enthusiastically. “I’m making chicken fajitas! my favorite! I hope you like them too.”</p><p class="p1">“Uh, yeah, no, I love a good fajita. Thanks,” Agatha replies, walking up to the kitchen counter and sitting on one of the stools.</p><p class="p1">They eat together at the counter.</p><p class="p1">Agatha moans out loud at the first bite. “Holy shit.”</p><p class="p1">Rio freezes, wide eyed, still holding her own fajita mid air.</p><p class="p1">“Who taught you how to cook? Please let me know so I can send them a fruit basket or something,” Agatha says, still chewing.</p><p class="p1">Rio chuckles, lowering her head a little. “Actually, it was my mom. She taught me how to feed myself before I went off to college. Taught me everything I know.. especially how to make these.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s expression softens. “Well then, she deserves three fruit baskets.”</p><p class="p1">There’s a pause before Rio lets out a quiet, slightly bitter laugh and says, “Uh… my parents passed away when I was twenty.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha freezes, stomach sinking. “I’m so sorry, Rio.”</p><p class="p1">Rio waves it off gently. “It’s okay. It’s been a long time. I just hold on to the good memories now… and how much they loved me.”</p><p class="p1">“You definitely should,” Agatha says, chuckling darkly. “My mother’s a raging cunt who disowned me when I came out.. and even before that, I never heard the word <em>love</em> in my life. Not until I started reading books and fell in love with literature for what it taught me about love and life that she never did.”</p><p class="p1">Rio laughs and says, “What a pair we are, huh? Traumatic past and all…”</p><p class="p1">Agatha grins. “I actually think it’s what makes us this hot.”</p><p class="p1">“So you think I’m hot, is what you’re saying?” Rio teases, eyebrow raised.</p><p class="p1">“Well, you’re hosting me <em>and</em> you saved my life, so I’m not about to call you ugly and risk losing my housing.. so… take that how you want,” Agatha fires back, pretending she’s not completely into Rio’s smug face and stupidly beautiful eyes.</p><p class="p1">They finish eating in a silence so easy, so domestic, it drives Agatha insane how much she likes it.</p><p class="p1">After taking both their plates to the sink, Rio starts washing them while Agatha stays perched on the counter, watching her.</p><p class="p1">Then Rio turns, drying her hands.</p><p class="p1">“Wanna go rot on the couch with some popcorn and watch a movie?”</p><p class="p1">“Sure,” Agatha hops down, already heading for the remote. “But no nature documentaries. I know your type. I’m picking something.”</p><p class="p1">“Your loss...” Rio shrugs with a smirk. “I was going to show you this amazing documentary about this cool animal that looks like wood but is actually an owl <em>but</em> now you’ll never see it.” She rambles as she plops down next to Agatha on the couch.</p><p class="p1">Agatha scrolls through Netflix, eyebrows furrowed like she’s flipping through a stack of terrible manuscripts like the author she is.</p><p class="p1">“This,” she says suddenly, hitting play on <em>The Wonder</em>.</p><p class="p1">Rio glances at the screen. “What’s it about?”</p><p class="p1">“It’s a good movie. Watched it once. It’s basically about a woman minding her own business, trying to do her job, and then promptly losing her mind because people around her are stupid,” Agatha mutters as the opening credits roll. “So basically… relatable.”</p><p class="p1">Rio chuckles. “Sounds uplifting.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha narrows her eyes at the screen. “It’s Florence Pugh in period clothes, emotionally repressing everything and solving mysteries with her eyes alone so..”</p><p class="p1">They fall into a quiet stretch of watching, but every few minutes, Agatha can’t help herself.</p><p class="p1">“She’s going to snap. I can feel it.”</p><p class="p1">“She’s surrounded by idiots. That’s the real horror here.”</p><p class="p1">“Oh look, another man telling her she’s being ‘too emotional.’ I need her to cut his dick off on screen.”</p><p class="p1">Rio, fully invested now, sneaks glances at Agatha more than the screen.</p><p class="p1">“You’re way more entertaining than the movie,” she teases.</p><p class="p1">Agatha doesn’t look away from the TV. “You’re just saying that because I’m hot and mean.”</p><p class="p1">Rio grins. “Just my type.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha smirks, and maybe, just maybe, leans a little closer to Rio on the couch.</p><p class="p1">Sitting side by side.</p><p class="p1">They get closer and closer until their thighs are touching.</p><p class="p1">No one comments about it though..</p><p class="p1">Once the movie credits roll, Agatha turns to look at Rio. “Why did you choose to get into firefighting anyway?”</p><p class="p1">Rio keeps her eyes on the screen for a beat before replying in a low voice, “It’s uh… it’s a long story. For another day.”</p><p class="p1">She pauses, then adds, still softly, “But I do love what I do. It makes me happy to help people… it really does. And I meet such interesting, unique people. Hear so many stories that make me grateful for what I have.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha twists her head back, groaning, “You’re such a good person. It’s terrible for us normal evil people to have people like you existing.”</p><p class="p1">Rio chuckles. “I don’t think it’s like that, to be honest. I think we all have different paths we need to walk toward. Some of us recklessly run into fire, and… others use amazing words to inspire people to live more courageously.. more boldly.”</p><p class="p1">Her eyes are on Agatha now as she says it.</p><p class="p1">“Okay, that was smooth. Shut the fuck up,” Agatha fires back and chuckles.</p><p class="p2">“Well, I started writing, like I mentioned before, because I fell in love with the written word… and, well, to overcompensate for the hole in my chest my bitch of a mother left in me.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha shrugs a little.</p><p class="p2">This is hard for her she’s never opened up to anyone else like this before.</p><p class="p2">But she finds herself spilling her soul even more,</p><p class="p2">“Books transported me to a different world and made me forget. And then, well… I tried writing myself, sent a few things to some publications and turns out—” she grins, “I’m quite good.”</p><p class="p1">“I’d lie and say I’ve read your work,” Rio says with a teasing smile on her face, “but between running into fires and taking care of my babies…” she gestures toward the plants.</p><p class="p1">Agatha rolls her eyes at that.</p><p class="p1">“Well… I never got the chance to. Yet. But I’d love to read them,” Rio continues genuinely. “Next time I pass a bookstore on my way home, I’ll grab a few copies.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha rolls her eyes again, but this time with a smile.</p><p class="p1">“No need for that. I’ll call my agent and have her send a few copies over.”</p><p class="p1">“Looking forward to that, then.”</p><p class="p1">They both go quiet for a beat, eyes locked. Longer than either expected.</p><p class="p1">It’s intense.</p><p class="p1">They’ve spent a few days together.</p><p class="p1">Rio took care of Agatha like no one ever had.</p><p class="p1">Rio is the most selfless, beautiful, strong person Agatha’s ever met.</p><p class="p1">She looks intensely into her eyes and hopes these thoughts convey to Rio telepathically somehow to show her appreciation without having to say it out loud.</p><p class="p1">Then Netflix does that annoying thing where it plays the next movie without asking and the loud noise of the Netflix anthem jolts them both, and the spell breaks.</p><p class="p1">Rio clears her throat.</p><p class="p1">“Well… I think it’s time I change the gauze on your arm. Come on.”</p><p class="p1">She helps Agatha up, leading her to the bathroom.</p><p class="p1">Agatha sits on the edge of the tub as Rio kneels in front of her, carefully unwrapping the old bandages.</p><p class="p1">The touch is gentle. Focused.</p><p class="p1">She holds Agatha’s arm like it’s something precious, a sacred duty in her hands that’s honorable to be in charge of healing.</p><p class="p1">All Agatha can do is feel Rio’s heart and soul though her actions.</p><p class="p1">“they’re looking much better today.”</p><p class="p1">Rio says as she cleans the area and rewraps it.</p><p class="p1">They do the entire process silently and comfortably.</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s phone pings in her pocket.</p><p class="p1">“Oh, it’s my landlord…” she mutters. “Apparently the apartment is getting assessed for the remains tomorrow morning. They need me there.”</p><p class="p1">She glances over at Rio. “Can you take me?”</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, of course. I’m not on shift until 6 pm,” Rio replies easily.</p><p class="p1">After that, they quietly start getting ready for bed together in the bathroom, brushing teeth, washing faces, like they’ve done this routine a hundred times before. Like they’re an old married couple.</p><p class="p1">It’s strange how natural it feels.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">It’s two in the morning now, and Agatha is trying to sleep. She really is. But another nightmare jerks her awake, heart pounding, skin clammy.</p><p class="p1">The dreams been a lovely addition to her routine since the fire...</p><p class="p1">Her body aches, not just from the injuries, but the exhaustion of interrupted sleep. And worse than the pain is how it's started to bleed into her writing. She hasn’t been able to string a proper sentence together since the accident.</p><p class="p1">Even with Rio helping her heal and feeding her and catering to her every need.</p><p class="p1">So she throws her blanket around her shoulders and shuffles to the living room. Maybe the glow of the TV and some brain numbing sitcom will quiet the noise in her head.</p><p class="p1">She’s sitting there for a good thirty minutes, still wide awake in the dark and quiet, when Rio’s bedroom door creaks open.</p><p class="p1">Agatha twists around, guilt tugging at her. “Was I too loud? Sorry.. I couldn’t sleep. Thought some tv might help.”</p><p class="p1">Rio steps out, voice soft. “It’s okay. What’s going on? Bad dream?”</p><p class="p1">She sits beside Agatha, settling onto the couch, partly on the edge of her blanket.</p><p class="p1">Agatha doesn’t look at her. “Yeah… I keep dreaming I’m back there. Collapsed. The fire getting closer.”</p><p class="p1">There’s a long silence.</p><p class="p1">Then Rio speaks, gentle and slow. “Makes sense.. and i know how that goes. I have some experience with the PTSD that comes from fires. My friend Alice… when we first started working together, she was a firefighter too. Then one day, we got hit with this massive four alarm fire. She got trapped inside alone. Barely made it out.”</p><p class="p1">Rio’s voice cracks a little, but she keeps going.</p><p class="p1">“After that, she couldn’t do it anymore. The nightmares were too much. She moved over to the aid car full time. I tried to be there for her, and I think one of the best things she ever did was finally see a therapist. Really helped her deal.”</p><p class="p1">She chuckles softly, side eyeing Agatha. “But… you strike me as the stubborn type.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha chuckles back at that too.</p><p class="p1">Rio pauses, then smiles gently</p><p class="p1">“For Alice, it was peppermint tea, her girlfriend’s hand holding hers, and her therapist. For me, it’s the weight of a warm heavy blanket, my plants, and working on my strength, just to reassure myself that I can take care of myself no matter what i face on shift.”</p><p class="p1">She looks into Agatha’s eyes as she says it.</p><p class="p1">“You’ll find yours. But in the meantime… you can borrow mine.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha laughs softly. “Thanks... but I don’t know how much Ferdinand the plant can help me calm down.”</p><p class="p1">“Hey, don’t underestimate the power of taking care of something. People manage PTSD all the time with service animals, and for me, well... as you know... plants.” Rio chuckles.</p><p class="p1">“Actually, that’s not a bad idea. I’ve always wanted a pet,” Agatha says with a shrug, mostly to herself.</p><p class="p1">“See? My wisdom helped you already. And tomorrow, after the visit to your apartment, we’ll pass by the shelter. See if we can find you a cute, furry friend to adopt.”</p><p class="p1">“I’d like that. Thank you for sharing your wisdom, Lieutenant Vidal,” Agatha says teasingly, but with a genuine smile on her face.</p><p class="p1">They stay on the couch, watching a few episodes of <em>Friends</em>, while Agatha delivers creative commentary about what a little bitch Ross is. Within the hour, she’s out cold.</p><p class="p1">Head resting on Rio’s shoulder.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>She wakes up in bed.</b> <b></b></p><p class="p1">Which is weird, considering she fell asleep on the couch beside Rio.</p><p class="p1">Welp… guess that’s <em>twice</em> now Rio has carried her in the span of a week.</p><p class="p1">More than anyone else ever has in her entire life.</p><p class="p2">She chuckles to herself as she heads to the kitchen, spotting the knight in shining armor herself, pouring coffee while pancakes and bacon sit steaming on the counter.</p><p class="p2">“Good morning,” Agatha says, startling Rio a little.</p><p class="p2">“Oh hey, hi. Good morning back,” Rio replies, then gestures to a second mug. “Want a cup?”</p><p class="p2">“Yeah, for sure. Could probably use it before I go face the wreckage of my home,” Agatha sighs, holding out the mug for Rio to fill.</p><p class="p2">Agatha eats a pancake, two pieces of bacon, and starts getting ready for the day.</p><p class="p2">She knows going back to the apartment won’t be easy, not after all the nightmares, but she needs to see what’s left, what survived, and assess the damage.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">What she doesn’t expect when she and Rio walk through the (still shattered) door is... most of her furniture still standing. Not in the best shape, but still standing.</p><p class="p2">It’s everything <em>on</em> and <em>around</em> them that’s blackened, charred, and ruined.</p><p class="p2">“Maybe some of the stuff in the drawers is still usable. Worth a check,” Rio says gently, placing a comforting hand on Agatha’s shoulder as they move through the place.</p><p class="p2">“I don’t really do emotional ties to items,” Agatha replies, chuckling darkly. “Learned that a long time ago when I left my mother’s house with nothing but a jacket to keep from freezing to death.”</p><p class="p2">It feels very weird walking through her what used to be home.</p><p class="p2">She’d lived here for the past five years, ever since her books became best sellers and she could afford this kind of place.</p><p class="p2">But now, as she walks past the bookshelf where she collapsed,</p><p class="p2">all she feels is dread, a tightness wrapping around her chest.</p><p class="p2">She really was going to die here.</p><p class="p2">If it weren’t for Rio,</p><p class="p2">she wouldn’t be here at all.</p><p class="p2">Her breathing quickens. Her face tightens. Her hands go clammy.</p><p class="p2">“Agatha? Are you okay?”</p><p class="p2">Rio’s voice comes from behind, soft but urgent. She places that same hand, the one that had been on her shoulder moments ago, gently on her arm.</p><p class="p2">The pressure grounds her, just a little.</p><p class="p2">“I feel like I was supposed to die that night,” Agatha says, barely above a whisper. “I don’t know why, but it felt like the end.”</p><p class="p2">A tear slips down her cheek, but she wipes it away quickly, like maybe if she moves fast enough, she won’t have to feel any of it.</p><p class="p2">“Hey hey,” Rio says, stepping in closer. “I’m here. You’re alive. You’re safe now. That means no. You were not supposed to die that night, Agatha.”</p><p class="p2">Her voice pleads, as if she hurts too if Agatha’s hurt.</p><p class="p2">“But I was. It was you who changed things,” Agatha says, voice low.</p><p class="p2">“One misstep. If I wasn’t loud enough… if the smoke had been thicker… you wouldn’t have seen me lying here on the floor.” Agatha’s eyes are glued to the spot she was collapsed in.</p><p class="p2">“Hey now, you underestimate how good I am at my job,” Rio tries to joke, offering a soft chuckle, trying to pull a smile from her.</p><p class="p2">But Agatha doesn’t laugh.</p><p class="p2">So Rio steps closer and gently takes Agatha’s face in both hands, turning her toward her.</p><p class="p2">“Look at me,” she says softly. “I promise I would’ve found you.</p><p class="p2">I don’t know how… but I would have.</p><p class="p2">Please believe me, Agatha.</p><p class="p2">I <em>would’ve found you.</em></p><p class="p2">I just know it in my soul i was meant to be here.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha smiles, a soft, sad curve of her lips, eyes still glistening.</p><p class="p2">“Such a hero, Lieutenant Vidal,” she chuckles quietly. Then, after a beat,</p><p class="p2">“Then.. I’m glad your fate interrupted mine.”</p><p class="p2">And in this moment, their hearts didn’t skip a beat, instead, they swelled, loud and certain, like they knew something their minds hadn’t caught up to yet.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">The landlord gave Agatha a box of items that somehow survived the fire, random things like a few pieces of jewelry, some plates and cups, and old photo albums that had been locked away</p><p class="p2">Nothing she would’ve cried over… but still, it’s nice to have something back.</p><p class="p2">As they drive away from the wreckage, Agatha feels herself saying goodbye to a chapter of her life.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">“Okay, we’re here,” Rio says as they pull into the lot. “I drop off lost animals we save on the job in this place. I usually stay for a bit and play with them if I have the time.”</p><p class="p2">They both unbuckle their seatbelts.</p><p class="p2">Yes, Agatha now wears a seatbelt.</p><p class="p2">Well <em>forced</em> is more accurate</p><p class="p2">After ignoring it for years. She didn’t care enough to bother before.</p><p class="p2">But now… well, let’s just say Rio doesn’t mess around when it comes to safety do’s and don’ts.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">“Welcome to Mystic River Animal Shelter. What can we do for you today?” the front desk lady says without looking up, typing on a computer.</p><p class="p2">Then she glances up and brightens. “Oh! Firefighter Vidal!”</p><p class="p2">Agatha blinks, unsure how to react to the way this thirty something pretty blonde lights up at the sight of her- of Rio.</p><p class="p2">“Welcome back! How can we help you today? Got another cute feline for us to find a home for?” the woman says, leaning forward over the desk with a smile that might as well be a wink. Agatha rolls her eyes at that move.</p><p class="p2">Rio chuckles. “Not today, Miranda. Actually, my, uh, friend, Agatha, is looking to meet some potential companions. See if anyone here wants to go home with her.” Her tone is warm, joyful, completely oblivious to Miranda’s very obvious flirting.</p><p class="p2">Finally, Miranda glances her way and says, “Oh! yes, of course! We’d love to find you a suitable pet. Come with me to the back to meet the cuties we have up for adoption.”</p><p class="p2">They head to the back, and Agatha looks around, unimpressed. A dog doesn’t really appeal to her.</p><p class="p2">Cliche lesbian that she is, she prefers something more independent, something that doesn’t want her attention 24/7.</p><p class="p2">She drifts toward the far end of the room.</p><p class="p2">“Oh, this section is for our more… <em>special</em> rescues,” Miranda says, casting a fake pout in Rio’s direction. “Most people don’t even give them a second glance.”</p><p class="p2">And of course, Rio falls for it. “Oh man, that’s just sad. Come on, Agatha, let’s go meet those poor babies.”</p><p class="p2">Rio casually walks past Miranda, grabs Agatha’s hand, <em>again</em>, like it’s the most natural thing in the world, and leads her toward the crates in the back.</p><p class="p2">“Aww, look at this adorable baby!” Rio says, crouching near one crate.</p><p class="p2">Agatha looks over. It’s a spider.</p><p class="p2">“Rio. FUCK NO.” she deadpans and keeps walking.</p><p class="p2">“Oh come on, she was cute,” Rio protests, following her.</p><p class="p2">They walk past a few lizards and then, Agatha hears a soft <em>thump</em> from one of the crates and turns toward it.</p><p class="p2">“Oh, that’s Preston,” Miranda says, noticing her interest. “He’s a gray lionhead rabbit. Bit of a grump. Very selective about who he likes, only my coworker Noelle can go near him. Last time I tried, he bit me.” She laughs a little too hard.</p><p class="p2">“Maybe try a different one?”</p><p class="p2">Naturally, Agatha does the opposite.</p><p class="p2">She steps up to the crate and peers in. Preston is all fluff and attitude, with mischievous eyes that look like they’ve seen some shit.</p><p class="p2">Or, done some shit..</p><p class="p2">Agatha crouches, opens the crate just enough to slide her hand in, not too close, and whispers, “Yeah, I get why you don’t like her. She’s annoying as fuck. What do you think, mister? Want a new home?”</p><p class="p2">The rabbit watches her for a moment, then hops closer toward her hand.</p><p class="p2">“Oh, you <em>like</em> me, don’t you?” Agatha chuckles and turns to Rio, eyes wide with that rare glint of childlike joy.</p><p class="p2">“Rio, I think he likes me.”</p><p class="p2">Rio beams. “I’m not surprised. From the sound of it, you two are soulmates. Same exact personality.”</p><p class="p2">“I don’t see your point. Our personalities are delightful,” Agatha mumbles, eyes still on the rabbit as he gently nudges her hand.</p><p class="p2">“No biting, huh! Curious little thing…” Miranda comments, voice dipped in passive bitterness that Agatha picks up on instantly. Rio, of course, seems oblivious still.</p><p class="p2">“Maybe your hand smells like some food he likes!” Miranda adds with an exaggerated laugh that grates on Agatha’s nerves.</p><p class="p2">Agatha doesn’t even flinch. “Okay, enough with that. I want him. Go prepare the papers.” Her tone is firm. Sharp.</p><p class="p2">“Sure thing, ma’am,” Miranda says with a tight smile and enough attitude to wanna make Agatha slap her, as she turns and walks back to the front desk.</p><p class="p2">“whore.” Agatha mutters under her breath.</p><p class="p2">“What?” Rio asks.</p><p class="p2">“Oh, nothing,” Agatha replies with a sudden smile, bending down toward the rabbit. “Just excited to bring this little boy home.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">She pays the fee and walks out with a cardboard box in her hands, her new baby inside.</p><p class="p2">“I think I’m gonna rename him. Preston is ugly. It sounds like a white frat boy who plays beer pong and gaslights women,” Agatha says.</p><p class="p2">Rio chuckles as she unlocks the car. “Agree. What did you have in mind?”</p><p class="p2">“Umm… how about <em>Señor Scratchy</em>? Feels right. He’s a scrappy little biter.” Agatha laughs, peeking into the box now resting on her lap in the passenger seat.</p><p class="p2">Señor Scratchy is already clawing at the cardboard walls and gnawing through the first layer like he’s trying to jailbreak himself.</p><p class="p2">He keeps at it the whole car ride, scratching and chewing the cardboard, and Agatha can’t help but smile at his antics. Her mood is already better, which surprises her after how the day started.</p><p class="p2">“Settle down, Mister,” she coos. “We’re just going to get you some supplies so you can be happy in your new home.”</p><p class="p2">Rio chuckles from the driver’s seat. “You talk to him like he understands you.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha scoffs. “Don't be a hater. I think he does, actually.”</p><p class="p2">“Whatever you say, sweetheart.” The term slips out so casually, so naturally, that Rio doesn’t seem to register it. But Agatha does, she holds her breath for a few seconds too long.</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">At the pet store, they walk the aisles together picking out Señor Scratchy’s food, toys, and all the supplies he’ll need. It feels weirdly domestic. Like grocery shopping with someone you love.</p><p class="p2">Which is so fucking weird.</p><p class="p2">And also kind of comforting.</p><p class="p2">Like Rio was her… nevermind.</p><p class="p2">The next few days fall into a rhythm, one that feels dangerously good.</p><p class="p2">They fall asleep around the same time.</p><p class="p2">Agatha wakes up to the smell of breakfast or finds a plate left out with a sticky note in Rio’s handwriting.</p><p class="p2">Rio insists on feeding her and makes sure she stays far away from the stove with her brace and burns.</p><p class="p2">Rio comes home to Agatha either napping from her pain meds or curled up with her laptop, writing.</p><p class="p2">On the days Agatha’s napping, Rio feeds Señor Scratchy and sits with him like he’s her new best friend.</p><p class="p2">Agatha’s caught her a few times, crouched on the floor beside his little enclosure, explaining fire safety procedures to him in earnest, how to stay safe if a blaze ever breaks out in a rabbit’s living space and how he can get out.</p><p class="p2">Agatha has three videos on her phone of it. She’ll never admit to taking them.</p><p class="p2">She’ll <em>definitely</em> never admit that watching Rio become the other parent in Señor Scratchy’s life makes her heart ache in the best way.</p><p class="p2">The way Rio takes care of her.</p><p class="p2">Feeds her.</p><p class="p2">Looks after her new baby.</p><p class="p2">It all feels like too much goodness in one place.</p><p class="p2">Agatha doesn’t understand how someone can be <em>that</em> kind after knowing her for such a short time.</p><p class="p2">Rio is dangerous.</p><p class="p2">To her walls.</p><p class="p2">To the cage she built around her own heart.</p><p class="p2">Now, Agatha spends her afternoons on the couch writing her new novel, a story that came out of nowhere but won’t stop growing, while Señor Scratchy chews carrots on her lap and Rio works out a few feet away in a super tight tank top and gray sweatpants while Agatha pretends to not glance at her every few minutes.</p><p class="p2">You’d think it would be too distracting to get anything done.</p><p class="p2">But actually, Rio’s presence has been… comforting.</p><p class="p2">Steady.</p><p class="p2">Safe.</p><p class="p2">Writing with Señor Scratchy in her lap and Rio moving around her space has become her favorite part of the day.</p><p class="p2">She doesn’t know how she’ll go back to her lonely existence after this.</p><p class="p2">But she also doesn’t know how to <em>keep</em> this without it eventually breaking down, because that’s all Agatha’s ever known:</p><p class="p2">That everything good must end.</p><p class="p2">That nothing stays.</p><p class="p2">That she can’t hold on to the warmth for long.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">Now here she is, in the middle of a surprisingly productive writing session, when her phone rings.</p><p class="p2">“Oh, hello Jennifer. To what do I owe the pleasure?” she says, answering the FaceTime call.</p><p class="p2">“Agatha? Where the hell are you?” Jen asks, narrowing her eyes and looking around suspiciously. “It looks like you’re in someone else’s home. is that a <em>plant climbing a bookshelf</em>?”</p><p class="p2">Agatha resists the urge to slam her phone down.</p><p class="p2">“Oh… yeah. About that. I’m staying with someone.”</p><p class="p2">Jen’s eyes light up. “<em>Someone?</em>”</p><p class="p2">“A friend,” Agatha says casually shrugging her shoulders.</p><p class="p2">“Which friend? I know all your friends.” Jen squints at the screen.</p><p class="p2">And then, of course, Rio walks behind her in one of her tight shirts, the kind that shows off her toned back and strong biceps, on her way to the kitchen.</p><p class="p2">Jen gasps dramatically.</p><p class="p2">“OHHH who’s <em>that?!</em>”</p><p class="p2">Agatha stiffens. “The <em>friend</em>.”</p><p class="p2">Jen leans closer to the screen. “A <em>HOT</em> friend.”</p><p class="p2">“Stop it,” Agatha hisses. “She’s just a friend.”</p><p class="p2">Jen smirks. “Where’d you <em>meet</em> this very hot <em>friend</em>?”</p><p class="p2">Agatha glances toward the kitchen, lowers her voice. “I met her the night my apartment burned down.”</p><p class="p2">Jen blinks. “Wait, what do you mea—”</p><p class="p2">She gasps. “<em>No.</em> Is your hot friend a <em>firefighter?!</em>”</p><p class="p2">“…Maybe,” Agatha mutters.</p><p class="p2">Jen fully squeals. “This is so HOT. Firefighters are <em>top tier uniform hotness.</em> Oh my <em>God.</em> So wait— how did you end up <em>living</em> with her?!”</p><p class="p2">Agatha looks past the phone at Rio and answers, “Oh you know how it goes. Lost consciousness that night, she happened to be there doing her job, Took me to the hospital and offered her place so I could heal while my apartment gets repaired.”</p><p class="p2">She says it all in one breath like it’s <em>not</em> the setup to the most romantic story ever written.</p><p class="p2">Jen just stares at her with a deadpan expression, the kind that said <em>“I’m about to rip your stubborn little head off.”</em></p><p class="p2">“Agatha, fucking hell. That’s the most romantic shit I’ve ever heard. Please tell me you’re planning to make a move soon.”</p><p class="p2">“Huh? Nah it’s not like that. She’s just a good person, you don’t get it. You don’t know Rio—”</p><p class="p2">“Oooh, so it has a name!” Jen cuts in, eyebrows raised. “And that was the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. No one invites a <em>stranger</em> to live with them in their private space unless they feel <em>something.</em>”</p><p class="p2">“Well, that’s not what’s going on here, so I don’t know what to tell you,” Agatha shrugs, trying for nonchalance, and failing miserably.</p><p class="p1">Agatha knows that’s not true, at least for her.</p><p class="p1">But when it comes to Rio? She’s not sure.</p><p class="p1">So no, she’s not making a <em>“move,”</em> or whatever Jen called it.</p><p class="p1">She can’t.</p><p class="p4"> </p><p class="p2">Rio makes them spaghetti that night, and they watch TV before falling asleep like usual, Agatha’s head resting on Rio’s shoulder, pretending like that isn’t intimate as hell.</p><p class="p2">And like every time, she wakes up in her bed, pretending like she doesn't do it on purpose because she feels warm all over her body from the fact that Rio can carry her like she weighs nothing.</p><p class="p2">The next morning, after breakfast, she realizes she needs a change in routine.</p><p class="p2">She also misses waking up to Rio cooking breakfast for them.</p><p class="p2">It’s been a few days of morning shifts for her, and the absence stings a little more than she expected.</p><p class="p2">So today, she decides she’ll grab lunch and finally see what Rio’s job is really like.</p><p class="p2">She’s been curious about the station, about Rio’s world outside this little comfort bubble they’ve been sharing.</p><p class="p2">And Rio <em>did</em> say she could give her a tour one day.</p><p class="p2">Now feels like a good time.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">So, she gets an Uber and heads to Station 15. Which turns out to be just eight minutes away from Rio’s place.</p><p class="p2">The moment she walks through the door, she sees a woman with short blonde hair coming down the stairs in uniform.</p><p class="p2">“Hi! Can we help you with something? I’m Captain Bishop of Station 15,” the woman says with a bright smile, offering her hand for Agatha to shake.</p><p class="p2">“Um, yes. hi. I’m Agatha. I’m a friend of one of your lieutenants, Rio Vidal. I was just passing by to bring her some lunch,” she says, eyeing this captain suspiciously.</p><p class="p2">Are <em>all</em> of Rio’s coworkers this hot?</p><p class="p2">She doesn’t like this.</p><p class="p2">“Oh wow, yes! We’ve heard a lot about you,” Captain Bishop says, more enthused now.</p><p class="p2">What the hell?</p><p class="p2">What’s Rio telling people about her?</p><p class="p2">“Come in, come in. The team’s in the common room, we’re just resting between calls,” Captain Bishop says as she leads Agatha up the stairs and down a hallway to a room with glass walls.</p><p class="p2">And there she is.</p><p class="p2">Sitting on the arm of the couch, hot as ever in her uniform, laughing at some joke her coworkers probably made.</p><p class="p2">With that gap between her front teeth that makes Agatha feel insane.</p><p class="p2">“Vidal! Your lady friend is here bringing you some lunch,” Captain Bishop calls out as they step into the room and now all the other firefighters are whistling at that statement teasingly and looking at her and Rio.</p><p class="p2">Rio’s head whips around so fast. Her eyes widen.</p><p class="p2">“Agatha!” she blurts out in shock, falling off the arm of the couch, rushing over and gently pulling her to the side for privacy. “How did you get here on your own? Please tell me you didn’t drive, that’s dangerous—”</p><p class="p2">“Oh relax, I took an Uber. That’s a thing now, Rio.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha cuts her off, then holds up the takeout bag with her good hand. “I uh... brought you lunch. From your favorite Italian place.”</p><p class="p2">A beat.</p><p class="p2">“And I figured it’s about time you gave me that tour you promised me or whatever.”</p><p class="p2">Rio chuckles at Agatha’s fake i don’t give a fucker attitude. “Sure thing. Come on, let’s do it right now.”</p><p class="p2">“What <em>are</em> you doing right now, Vidal?” one of the firefighters teases with a smug grin as the others snicker.</p><p class="p2">“Oh, screw off, Ava. We’re just doing a tour of the station,” Rio fires back chuckling at her friends’ antics, flipping her off before grabbing Agatha’s hand and pulling her out of the room.</p><p class="p2">“Alright, that was the common room, we just hang out there between calls,” Rio says as they walk down the hall. She turns left and gestures ahead. “This is the kitchen area. We eat here together most days as a team. Yelena makes the best mac and cheese, and Bob usually takes care of the dishes.”</p><p class="p2">“I like it,” Agatha says, nodding thoughtfully. “Very open space. Nice calming tones.” She says it like she’s some kind of interior designer.</p><p class="p2">Rio grins. “Yeah. I’ve always loved sitting by the windows after a long shift. It’s a good place to ground myself, you know? Just… reflect.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha watches her as she speaks, the soft lighting catching in her hair. Most people she’s known wouldn’t know how to <em>reflect</em> if it smacked them in the face. But Rio? She makes being a good, reflective person look so easy.</p><p class="p2">“Okay, and now this way,” Rio says as they turn right.</p><p class="p2">“This is the shower and locker room area. We reek of smoke after every fire, so we’ve gotta shower at the station before we leave, otherwise our families would hate us.” She chuckles, then adds, “Or, well, the people <em>with</em> families shower here. I usually just go home and clean up in my own place.”</p><p class="p2">There’s a hint of sadness in her voice that Agatha catches immediately.</p><p class="p2">“Well, I’m living with you now,” Agatha replies, trying to lighten the mood, “so please don’t come home smelling like a campfire.”</p><p class="p2">Rio chuckles, softer this time. “Aye aye, Captain Harkness.”</p><p class="p2">“Speaking of that,” Agatha says, nudging her, “what’s up with <em>your</em> captain? She looks like a Barbie.”</p><p class="p2">“Oh, Bishop?” Rio laughs. “Yeah, they actually used to call her ‘Firefighter Barbie’ before she got promoted.”</p><p class="p2">“And now?”</p><p class="p2">“Oh no, now we don’t. Big no no. Not unless we want bathroom duty for a week.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha raises an eyebrow, teasing, “So... you two never.. dated or anything like that? You seem kind of close. She said you talked to her about me.”</p><p class="p2">Rio blinks, then smiles, reassuring. “Oh, no, no, Bishop’s been married to a gorgeous Italian doctor for seven years. They’ve got a son and a daughter. She’s just a good friend. That’s all.”</p><p class="p2">“Aha.. Yea no i figured.” Agatha replies with a nonchalant attitude again which makes Rio chuckle internally.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">Then they go downstairs, and Agatha, like a kid, climbs into the firetrucks and lets Rio tells her what all the buttons do and equipments are for and she actually found the information quite interesting.</p><p class="p2">“And so yea,” Rio leans casually against the engine, pointing at a set of gauges on the side of the truck.</p><p class="p2">“This right here is literally a foam system. It mixes special Class A or B fire suppression foam with water depending on what we’re fighting. Like, water won’t cut it with oil or chemical fires, right? So we add foam, and boom. fire suffocates.”</p><p class="p2">She glances at Agatha with a small grin.</p><p class="p2">“It’s kinda like potion making, honestly. You get the ratio wrong, and you either flood a kitchen or piss off your whole team.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha raises an eyebrow, amused.</p><p class="p2">“So you’re basically a witch with a hose?”</p><p class="p2">Rio winks.</p><p class="p2">“Exactly. Very cool right?”</p><p class="p2">Agatha laughs at that, “Yes, Lieutenant Vidal. Very cool.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">After the tour, they head back to the kitchen area, sit at the table, and eat their takeout while talking about their day.</p><p class="p2">“Wait—” Rio suddenly blurts out mid bite, “Is Scratchy okay alone at home?”</p><p class="p2">Agatha bursts out laughing. “He’s fine! I gave him a mountain of greens and tossed in a few toys for him too.”</p><p class="p2">Rio furrows her brows, a hint of panic creeping in. “You gave him the teddy bear, right? That’s his favorite. He goes feral and chews on the furniture without it.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha chuckles, rolling her eyes. “Yes, <em>mami</em> Vidal, I gave him the teddy bear.”</p><p class="p2">Rio kind of glitches at what Agatha called her, then chuckles nervously and looks back down at her pasta.</p><p class="p2">“I love that you bonded with him,” Agatha says, teasing. “It’s adorable. Totally not too cutesy for a badass firefighter.”</p><p class="p2">Rio pouts. “Firefighters can be soft, have pets, and <em>still</em> be tough badasses, you know?”</p><p class="p2">“For sure. Hard agree. You’re basically the poster child for that type,” Agatha continues, smirking.</p><p class="p2">“Whatever. It’s someone’s type. I just have to find that someone.” Rio chuckles again, brushing it off casually.</p><p class="p2">Agatha stills for a second at that, suddenly unsure. <em>Does Rio now think she doesn’t find her attractive? </em></p><p class="p2">She can’t have that.</p><p class="p2">“I think you’d be surprised how many people would fight over that spot.”</p><p class="p2">She stirs her pasta, pretending to sound offhand, but her eyes sneak a glance at Rio.</p><p class="p2">Before Rio can respond to the hint, the alarms go off, much louder than Agatha expected.</p><p class="p2">“Oh crap, I gotta go, Agatha. Thanks for the lunch! I really appreciate it!”</p><p class="p2">Rio jumps to her feet. And just before running off, she leans down, and kisses Agatha on the head.</p><p class="p2">Then she bolts toward the stairs, yelling over her shoulder, “Wait for me! I’ll drive you home as soon as I get back!”</p><p class="p2">Agatha just sits there, gobsmacked, trying to process what the actual <em>fuck</em> just happened.</p>

<p class="p1">Agatha is noticeably distant after the firehouse visit.</p><p class="p1">Rio can definitely tell that she has been.</p><p class="p1">Agatha knows it’s not very emotionally mature but she cannot stop playing the kiss over and over again in her mind.</p><p class="p1">Unsure of it’s implications to Rio.</p><p class="p1">Was is just Rio being Rio?</p><p class="p1">Was it romantic?</p><p class="p1">Was Rio interested in her?</p><p class="p1">Or was it some caretaker type thing affection, like Rio saw her as a fragile patient she was nursing back to health?</p><p class="p1">She can’t help but spiral over it.</p><p class="p1">I mean.. They live together. Act like a couple who sort of cuddle on the couch every night.</p><p class="p1">But.. They’re <em>not</em> a couple.</p><p class="p2">Not even friends with benefits.</p><p class="p2">What <em>are</em> they?</p><p class="p1">So that’s why the past few days Agatha keeps pretending to be be asleep when Rio comes home.</p><p class="p1">She waits until the coast is clear, then emerges like a guilt ridden owl to quietly eat the dinner sweet sweet Rio still leaves out for her, even though Agatha’s been avoiding her like an asshole.</p><p class="p1">Lucky for her, Rio’s been working longer shifts lately. She’s barely been home anyway.</p><p class="p3">But after a full week of Agatha keeping to herself, she starts to notice something.</p><p class="p3">Rio is trying.</p><p class="p3">She’s making her favorite meals every night like a deliciously cooked steak to perfection the way Agatha likes it and mashed potatoes with a perfectly poured glass of her favorite wine on the side.</p><p class="p3">No comments. No questions. Just... there. Waiting for her.</p><p class="p3">Fresh azaleas keep appearing in the middle of the counter, vivid and purple and impossible to ignore. Agatha only mentioned once, the first few days she lived here, that they were her favorite. Just once. And yet here they are. Again.</p><p class="p3">It feels like a message.</p><p class="p3">
<b>I miss you.</b>
<b></b>
</p><p class="p3">Agatha isn’t sure though. So she lets it go.</p><p class="p3">Rio also stops smelling like smoke when she comes home without Agatha having to complain about it, therefore the apartment stops reeking of smoke too, Agatha noticed.</p><p class="p3">She now also knocks gently on Agatha’s door to deliver her meals, wearing those damn tank tops Agatha always sneaks extra glances at. The ones that show off her biceps in ways that feel unfair to Agatha’s sanity.</p><p class="p3">And one evening, she comes home with a tote bag from a local bookstore.</p><p class="p3">“I saw these and thought you’d like them,” she says casually, setting the bag down and walking away before Agatha can even respond.</p><p class="p3">It’s so fucking sweet and caring and <em>gentlewomanly</em> that Agatha is going to snap one day and just kiss her on the mouth.</p><p class="p3">She feels fucking horrible, too. Because now Rio clearly thinks she’s not appreciated and needs to do more for her.</p><p class="p3">“Jen, this fucking woman is buying me books, making my favorite foods and delivering them to my room like fucking room service and I don’t know what to make of this shit! I feel like I’m going insane,” she blurts the second Jen answers the phone.</p><p class="p3">“Well first of all, hello, Agatha, whatever happened to <em>Hi Jen, how are you, my best and closest friend?</em> And second of all, HA! I <em>knew</em> it! You <em>like</em> her, and she <em>clearly</em> likes you back! Awwww, you guys are so cuuuute—” Jen teases on the other end of the call.</p><p class="p3">“Shut the fuck up, Jen. What do you mean she <em>clearly</em> likes me back?” Agatha snaps.</p><p class="p3">“Are you telling me your dumbass wrote all those bestselling romantic novels and you <em>STILL</em> can’t tell that this woman is <em>very obviously</em> into you?”</p><p class="p3">Agatha stays quiet for a few seconds before muttering, “Well… when you put it like that…”</p><p class="p3">“I <em>am</em> putting it <em>exactly</em> like that! Please, for the love of God, Agatha, just talk to this poor woman who’s basically begging on her hands and knees for your attention!”</p><p class="p3">
<em>Well Rio on her hands and knees isn’t a bad image to have in her mind.</em>
</p><p class="p2">“FINE! Fine. I’ll talk to the attractive, kind, caring woman who saved my life and has been taking care of me ever since, whatever could go wrong!” Agatha snaps, throwing her hands in the air like Jen can see her dramatics.</p><p class="p2">Then, quieter and grumpier,</p><p class="p2">“If she breaks my heart, I swear to God, Jen, I’m taking it out on <em>you</em>.</p><p class="p3">“I have a feeling about this one, Agatha. Trust me. Just talk to her. Be real. Stop avoiding her.”</p><p class="p3">“How the hell did you know I’m avoiding her?”</p><p class="p3">“You think I didn’t clock your avoidant ass behavior the first week we became friends?” Jen shoots back, cackling.</p><p class="p3">“I’m hanging up now. I’m not tolerating this abuse.” Agatha says, but she still waits.</p><p class="p3">“Bye, lovergirl.” Jen sings.</p><p class="p3">“Fuck you.”</p><p class="p3">She ends the call and then walks straight out of her room to find..</p><p class="p3">Wait..</p><p class="p3">Is Rio building a… pillow fort?</p><p class="p3">“Uh, what’s… going on here?” Agatha asks, approaching slowly, brow raised.</p><p class="p3">Rio turns to her with the biggest grin on her face, stands up, and says,</p><p class="p3">“Surprise! I made a fort out of the couch pillows. For you!</p><p class="p3">Because, um… I noticed you’ve been kinda distant, and I thought—</p><p class="p3">Well, when I was a kid, a pillow fort always made me feel better.”</p><p class="p3">She shrugs, a little shy now.</p><p class="p3">“We’ll watch TV, eat junk food, and just stay under the fort until you feel better.</p><p class="p3">Does that, uh… sound like something you’d enjoy?</p><p class="p3">Actually, now that I’m saying it out loud, maybe you think it’s childish..</p><p class="p3">We can totally do something else if this is weird or—”</p><p class="p3">“Rio,” Agatha cuts in softly.</p><p class="p3">Because her heart has just cracked open in half.</p><p class="p3">This precious fucking being.</p><p class="p3">She thought Agatha was going through <em>something</em>.</p><p class="p3">Not realizing Agatha had been <em>avoiding</em> <em>her</em>…</p><p class="p3">Just because she was too scared to face whatever the hell this was between them.</p><p class="p3">“I would love to hang out in your pillow fort with you,” Agatha says, a soft smile tugging at her lips.</p><p class="p3">Oh God. If pre fire Agatha saw her now, she’d probably laugh in her face and call her a simp.</p><p class="p3">They sit under the fort, a blanket stabilized over a chair above them, cocooning them from the rest of the world just for these few sacred hours.</p><p class="p3">“I know you don’t trust my taste, but you’ll <em>love</em> this show, I promise. It’s called Motherland Fort Salem basically it’s about women, witches, and lesbianism,” Rio says as they lie on their stomachs over the blankets spread beneath them.</p><p class="p3">“Alright, I’ll reserve judgment until the end of the night,” Agatha replies, amused, as they start the first season.</p><p class="p3">She truly thought Rio’s taste would flop again, but this show is… so interesting.</p><p class="p3">By the time they hit episode seven, Rio has tears in her eyes watching the reunion scene between the main lesbian couple, and Agatha is staring at the screen, uncharacteristically quiet.</p><p class="p3">She hasn’t even made that many snarky comments. Just asked a few thoughtful questions about the lore.</p><p class="p3">“I mean, I dig the strength Anacostia has to do what needs to be done, but damn, can’t help but feel bad for Scylla. She only did what she thought was right after watching her parents get shot by the army… I’d go evil too,” Agatha says after the particularly emotional scene.</p><p class="p3">Rio lets out a wet chuckle, still wiping tears from her eyes. “I <em>should’ve</em> known you’d empathize with the one with the shady grey past.”</p><p class="p3">“What? Am I wrong?” Agatha grins. “And Raelle <em>clearly</em> felt the pull to be with her even when she knew something was off. That’s just how it is! people fall for the complicated ones. Anti-heroes with messy pasts are irresistible.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha rolls onto her back, but turns her head toward Rio and asks with a teasing smirk, “You’re telling me you’ve never had one? No dating disaster stories where you fell for a complicated person?”</p><p class="p3">Rio chuckles softly, but her voice goes quieter. “To be honest… I’ve never had a serious relationship.”</p><p class="p3">She hesitates, then continues, “Being in my line of work makes things more complicated. Some days, I watch how my colleagues stress their families out so much, they need support groups and therapy just to deal with the fear.</p><p class="p3">Constant danger. Constant waiting for them to come home.”</p><p class="p3">She gives Agatha a sad smile. “I hate the idea of putting someone through that. Of putting the woman I love in a position where she’s always bracing for a call, one that either means I made it out… or I didn’t.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha feels her whole body tense at that. Her breath catches. She hadn’t considered any of this before.</p><p class="p3">“That makes sense,” she says carefully, “but… shouldn’t that be up to the other person to decide? Whether they want to be in your life or not?”</p><p class="p3">Rio sighs and nods, but there’s something weary in her posture now. “Yeah, sure. Logically, I know that. But logic doesn’t mean shit when you’re standing in the street, watching someone you love being rolled into an ambulance. Not knowing if they’ll wake up and then you run barefoot to the hospital just to be told they didn’t make it.”</p><p class="p3">She pauses, her gaze fixed somewhere far away.</p><p class="p3">“And if you’ve ever felt that kind of helplessness,” she adds softly, “you never want to be the reason someone else has to feel it too.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha watches her, and for a moment, she’s sure of it.</p><p class="p3">Rio wasn’t just speaking hypothetically. That look in her eyes… she was talking from experience.</p><p class="p3">Agatha feels a sudden tightness in her chest. Panic, quiet but creeping.</p><p class="p3">Does she have to start worrying every time Rio leaves for work? Wait for her call to let her know she’s okay and is coming home?</p><p class="p3">Her face must give something away, because Rio notices.</p><p class="p3">“But hey,” Rio says gently, trying to ease the tension, “I’m really good at my job. I take precautions. Always.”</p><p class="p3">She offers a small smile, tongue pressing into her cheek like she always does when she’s nervous. Agatha had caught on to that, “And, who knows? My goal’s always been to make battalion chief one day. Way less danger in that role. So…”</p><p class="p3">They fall into a quiet stretch, soft sounds from the show playing behind them, until Rio breaks it gently.</p><p class="p3">“What about you, Ms. Famous Author?” she asks with a smile. “Any heartbreak stories that inspired your novels?”</p><p class="p3">Agatha exhales through her nose, half smile twitching at her lips.</p><p class="p3">“Well, you know how it goes,” she says, still on her back, eyes tracing the folds in the blanket above them. “People come, people go.”</p><p class="p3">Her voice is light, but there’s no real humor in it.</p><p class="p3">Rio leans slightly more towards her. “It’s okay if you don’t wanna talk about your love life. We can change the subject.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha snorts, “What love life?”, but there’s a rawness beneath it now. “Nah, I’m too fucked up to let anyone in.”</p><p class="p3">She pauses, fiddling with a loose thread in the blanket beneath them.</p><p class="p3">“I grew up conditioned to seek control to feel safe, Rio” she says, quieter now. “So that’s what I chased in people. Control.”</p><p class="p3">She finally glances at Rio, then looks away just as quickly.</p><p class="p3">“The few relationships I had... never lasted longer than a few months. It was all games. All surface.”</p><p class="p3">Her voice drops, bitter and tired. “Mind games and sex. That’s all it ever was.”</p><p class="p3">She swallows, blinking up at the ceiling again, like she’s trying to hold something in, or maybe just breathe through it.</p><p class="p3">She doesn’t know how Rio does it.</p><p class="p3">How she makes it feel <em>safe</em> to open up. Like Agatha could place every sharp, ugly piece of herself on the table and Rio would just take her hand and say, <em>okay.</em></p><p class="p3">No judgment. No flinch.</p><p class="p3">Rio hums softly, acknowledging her honesty.</p><p class="p3">And as if sensing that this was Agatha reaching out, showing her cards, Rio offers something in return.</p><p class="p3">“You asked me why I became a firefighter,” she begins, voice quiet.</p><p class="p3">She pauses. Looks directly into Agatha’s eyes.</p><p class="p3">“I was visiting my parents during a break from uni,” she says. “Just for a week. One night, I was out with some friends. Then as i was driving home after the night ended..”</p><p class="p3">She swallows.</p><p class="p3">“I saw a bunch of firetrucks and ambulances speeding past me, all heading in the same direction I was going.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha’s breath catches. Her heart is already sinking.</p><p class="p3">Rio’s voice is thinner now. Almost hoarse.</p><p class="p3">“When I got there... our house was on full on fire.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha instinctively reaches out, placing a hand on Rio’s arm and rubbing gently, grounding her.</p><p class="p3">“There were hazards in the house that we didn’t even know about. One of them caused an explosion. The fire spread too fast. My parents were trapped inside.”</p><p class="p3">Rio’s eyes start to glisten, her mouth trembling as she keeps going.</p><p class="p3">“They tried. The firefighters tried. But we lived in a poorer neighborhood. Not enough trucks. Not enough gear. They couldn’t get to them in time.”</p><p class="p3">A tear rolls down Rio’s cheek.</p><p class="p3">“I wasn’t even allowed to run inside,” she says, voice breaking. “I just stood there… helpless. Watching. I never even got to say goodbye.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha’s chest aches.</p><p class="p3">“They loaded them into ambulances and sent them to the hospital,” Rio whispers. “But they were already gone.”</p><p class="p3">There’s a stillness between them now. A pause too thick for words.</p><p class="p3">Agatha stares at her, stunned by the depth of her pain, this steady, strong woman who saved lives for a living... and once couldn’t save the two who mattered most to her.</p><p class="p3">She wants to wrap Rio in her arms. Protect her from every hurt.</p><p class="p3">Keep her here, in this pillow fort, hidden away from the world.</p><p class="p3">“That feeling… being useless. Helpless. I never wanted to feel that again.”</p><p class="p3">She swallows hard, her voice cracking as she said that.</p><p class="p3">“So I decided, if I couldn’t save my family, maybe I could save someone else’s. I became the person I needed that night. The one that terrified little girl was waiting for.”</p><p class="p3">She glances at Agatha, a faint, broken smile tugging at her lips.</p><p class="p3">“And maybe… if I do this right, some other girl won’t have to live with the kind of pain I did.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha takes a long pause, trying to find the right words, something that might be enough to show Rio how deeply she sees her.</p><p class="p3">“You took something that broke you… and turned it into purpose,” she says softly.</p><p class="p3">“That’s not just strength, Rio. That’s something else entirely. Something I don’t even have words for.”</p><p class="p3">She hesitates, then slowly reaches out, her hand rising to Rio’s cheek, gently turning her face so their eyes meet.</p><p class="p3">“You carry all this pain… and still make space to care about others. About me.”</p><p class="p3">Her voice trembles now, stripped of sarcasm, of deflection, only honesty left.</p><p class="p3">“I’m so sorry you went through that. No one should have to… not alone. Especially not as young as you were.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha’s eyes glisten with tears. She exhales slowly.</p><p class="p3">“I know it’s not the same, but… I’m here. And I’d really like to stay in your life. If you’ll let me.”</p><p class="p3">She gives a small, fragile smile.</p><p class="p3">“And for the record… that little girl? I think she’d be so proud of the woman you’ve become. And i don’t know if this makes any difference to you but, I am.”</p><p class="p2">Rio lets out a shaky breath, her eyes glassy.</p><p class="p2">“That means a lot to me.”</p><p class="p2">She glances down for a second, then back up to look into Agatha’s eyes,</p><p class="p2">“I didn’t even know I needed to hear this to be honest… until you said it.”</p><p class="p3">She pauses, then adds softly,</p><p class="p3">“I know you think you’re too fucked up, but Agatha… you’re one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met. Your heart is huge, you’re just good at hiding it with all the sarcasm and bluntness, which I like, actually. So I hope you never lose those.”</p><p class="p3">Rio chuckles lightly, then continues,</p><p class="p3">“All I mean is… I hope you know how incredible you are too.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha shifts, leaning onto one elbow while Rio remains on her stomach, propped up on both.</p><p class="p3">Their gaze locks, so intense it feels like they’re old lovers from 1860, reunited after years of secret letters exchanged through a war.</p><p class="p3">Slowly, they lean into each other’s space.</p><p class="p3">They can feel each other’s breath.</p><p class="p3">Eyes close.</p><p class="p3">Lips hover. Just a hair away from touching.</p><p class="p3">And then,</p><p class="p3"><b>BZZZT.</b> <b></b></p><p class="p3">Rio’s phone buzzes loudly against the hardwood floor.</p><p class="p3">Both of them freeze.</p><p class="p3">Agatha pulls back just slightly, her heart pounding.</p><p class="p3">Rio clears her throat and sits up, reaching for her phone.</p><p class="p3">One glance at the screen and her expression shifts.</p><p class="p3">“It’s the station,” she says, sitting up quickly, her body already shifting into work mode.</p><p class="p3">Agatha nods, the words stuck in her throat.</p><p class="p3">Rio brings the phone to her ear.</p><p class="p3">Agatha watches her closely, sees the tension ripple across her features as she listens.</p><p class="p3">Rio nods once, then again, before letting out a quiet breath.</p><p class="p3">“Understood. I’m on my way.”</p><p class="p3">She ends the call and lowers the phone slowly.</p><p class="p3">“There’s a four alarm fire downtown,” she says, already rising to her feet. Her tone is gentle, but firm. “They need every available unit. I’m so sorry our night will have to get cut short but i have to go.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha just stares at her for a second, stunned. The intimacy of moments ago still lingers between them like static, but reality rushes in fast.</p><p class="p3">She didn’t even get the chance to sit with what Rio just shared, or figure out how to handle the weight of it and the weight of what having an emergency responder in her life would mean, before reality came crashing in.</p><p class="p3">Rio’s already moving, grabbing her station bag, throwing on her turnout pants, reaching for her keys by the door. She doesn’t have time for a proper goodbye, but as she gets ready she keeps glancing at Agatha, her eyes hold an apology.</p><p class="p3">The words leave Agatha’s mouth before she even realizes she’s saying them before Rio grabs the door handle,</p><p class="p3">“Rio?”</p><p class="p3">Agatha’s voice stops her in her tracks.</p><p class="p3">Rio turns.</p><p class="p3">Agatha swallows, forces a smile that wobbles around the edges.</p><p class="p3">“Come back in one piece, please.” Her voice is quiet. Almost teasing. Almost not.</p><p class="p3">Rio’s expression softens.</p><p class="p3">“I’ll try my best to,” she says with a small nod. “I promise.”</p><p class="p3">And then she’s gone.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p1">It’s dead silent in the apartment after Rio walks out the door.</p><p class="p1">Agatha finds herself back in the pillow fort, staring at nothing.. for how long, she can’t tell.</p><p class="p1">What pulls her back to the present is Señor Scratchy darting past her, heading straight for the TV wires, his latest obsession.</p><p class="p1">It’s been driving Rio up the wall, which Agatha secretly found hilarious.</p><p class="p1">"Come here, mister. Don’t cause Rio more grief than she’s already in,” she whispers against Scratchy’s fur.</p><p class="p1">For an hour, she paces the living room, overthinking every possible scenario.</p><p class="p1"><br/>
What if Rio gets stuck in whatever fire she’s fighting?</p><p class="p1">What if it flares up and catches her? What if too smoke inhalation kills her?</p><p class="p1">What if she falls through the floor like in those dramatic firefighter shows?</p><p class="p1">
<em>What if Rio dies?</em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Agatha feels like she can’t breathe properly. Can’t break out of the loop of shitty thoughts.</p><p class="p1">The only thing centering her is Scratchy squirming in her arms, trying to flee.</p><p class="p1">She glances at the clock on the wall behind her and mutters under her breath, “<em>How long does a four alarm fire take to fucking put out?”</em></p><p class="p1">Only now does she start to truly understand what Rio meant, that the families of firefighters live with this kind of worry 24/7.</p><p class="p1">She tries lying down on the couch, setting Señor Scratchy on her chest like a weighted blanket for anxiety. It helps… a little. But she’s still on edge, every part of her buzzing.</p><p class="p1">A door creaks open in the apartment above, and she flinches and so does Scratchy.</p><p class="p1">"She’s too cocky and good at her job to die, right?<em>"</em> she whispers to the rabbit, like he might understand. Like he might actually answer.</p><p class="p1">To her amusement, Scratchy gives a tiny thump on her chest.</p><p class="p1">“Was that a yes?” she asks with a shaky smile. “You think so too, right?”</p><p class="p1">He twitches his nose in that adorable, twitchy, bunny way while locking eyes with her. Her chest tightens, but she lets out a soft breath, clutching him a little closer.</p><p class="p3">Her mind spirals, What if this is it? What if she loses Rio before she can even figure out what this even was between them?</p><p class="p1">She can’t take the wait any longer.</p><p class="p1">She grabs her laptop off the coffee table, flips it open, and starts scouring news sites, anything that might have coverage of the fire Rio’s at.</p><p class="p1">To her surprise, it’s actually easy to find a live feed.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">It’s bad.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Way worse than the fire at her own complex. This one spans multiple buildings, flames leaping from one to the next with no signs of slowing down.</p><p class="p1">Her eyes scan the screen, jumping from firefighter to firefighter. She knows how to look for the stations by their uniforms now.</p><p class="p1">Her gaze darts, searching for a 15.</p><p class="p1">She knows she shouldn’t be doing this. It’s only going to stress her out more. Rio warned her about this, the stress, the panic, the helplessness that comes with caring for a firefighter.</p><p class="p1">But here she is.</p><p class="p1">Trying to find Waldo. Her brave, beautiful Waldo.</p><p class="p1">And then, she sees it.</p><p class="p1">A 15.</p><p class="p1">Not just any 15.</p><p class="p1">She knows that bun. The one Rio always does in her own unique way. And weirdly… the walk. That unmistakable way Rio walked.</p><p class="p1">Then, she can see Rio talking to her captain, Captain Bishop, if Agatha remembers right.</p><p class="p1">Then Rio takes off.</p><p class="p1">Straight into the burning building.</p><p class="p1">Agatha gasps. Her lungs stop working.</p><p class="p1">Rio disappears into the smoke and out of sight.</p><p class="p1">Agatha exhales only to suck in another breath like she forgot how. Her hand tightens around Señor Scratchy, clutching him like he might anchor her the way Rio’s hand would, if she were here. Right now. Holding hers.</p><p class="p1">She feels her eyes burning from holding back tears.</p><p class="p1">She’s not someone who scares easily.</p><p class="p1">She’s never cared about anyone like this, never enough to be <em>consumed</em> by fear.</p><p class="p1">Slamming the laptop shut, she shoots up from the couch like the cushions were burning her ass.</p><p class="p1">She needs distractions. New ones.</p><p class="p1">So she organizes Rio’s bookshelf, straightens the frames on the walls, even reorders Rio’s skincare shelf in the bathroom from smallest to largest.</p><p class="p1">Anything to keep moving. Anything to not <em>feel</em>.</p><p class="p1">Another thirty minutes pass.</p><p class="p1">She gives in. Takes out her phone and tries calling Rio, hoping, somehow, that she’ll answer.</p><p class="p1">She doesn’t.</p><p class="p1">Just voicemail.</p><p class="p1">She knew it was a long shot but still..</p><p class="p1">“Hey… um… give me a call as soon as you’re out and good. Um… yeah, that’s all. Bye.”</p><p class="p1">That’s all she can manage.</p><p class="p1">She goes to the kitchen, she figures maybe Rio would want a snack when she gets back.</p><p class="p1">She thinks about what she can make her..</p><p class="p1">Grilled cheese.</p><p class="p1">Yes.</p><p class="p1">Simple. Comforting. Easy enough, she thinks.</p><p class="p1">Laying the cheese on the toast is fine. But heating it up on the stove? With one hand in a brace and the other doing all the work? Not ideal.</p><p class="p1">Still, she manages to get the sandwich to melt just right. But when she tries to slide it off the pan using a fork while holding the pan with her braced arm..</p><p class="p1">Her fingers accidentally graze the hot metal.</p><p class="p1">Agatha yelps in pain and instinctively jerks her hand away. The pan drops, right onto her foot.</p><p class="p1">“MOTHERFUCKER!”</p><p class="p1">She doubles over, cradling her burnt hand to her chest and simultaneously stumbling from the pain shooting through her foot.</p><p class="p1">That’s it. She’s done.</p><p class="p1">She sinks to the kitchen floor, back against the cabinets, both hands aching, one from surgery (she just now realizes she forgot her pain meds in the chaos of tonight), the other freshly burned, and finally, the tears start to spill.</p><p class="p1">She didn’t sign up for this kind of vulnerability. Didn’t ask for someone to matter this much.</p><p class="p1">Maybe it was easier when she had no one to care about. When no one cared enough to make her feel this fucking fragile.</p><p class="p1">Maybe she should’ve just stayed at that fucking Airbnb.</p><p class="p1">But it’s too late for that thinking now.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">She takes her phone out of her pocket and tries calling Rio again.</p><p class="p1">Nothing.</p><p class="p1">Again.</p><p class="p1">She leaves another voicemail.</p><p class="p1">“You better call me back, Vidal. I swear to God… If you don’t, I don’t think I can.. Just call me as soon as you can. Please.”</p><p class="p1">Her voice cracking throughout the entire thing. She’s aware of how pathetic she sounds. She still sends it.</p><p class="p1">She stays there, sitting on the kitchen floor, staring ahead at the oven like it’s a TV screen.</p><p class="p1">She doesn’t move.</p><p class="p1">Time passes by, how much of it, she’s not sure. Her eyes start getting heavier… and heavier… and heavier.</p><p class="p1">She’s not asleep, but she’s not awake either.</p><p class="p1">The world turns hazy. She starts hearing footsteps.</p><p class="p1">Rio’s.</p><p class="p1">But.. She knows it’s not real, though in the moment, even the hallucinations are a comfort.</p><p class="p1">It lasts for a while. Her eyes are shut, but her mind is still running.</p><p class="p1">She doesn’t know when she drifts off.</p><p class="p1">But she wakes to the slam of a door.</p><p class="p1">Disoriented, she jerks upright and then stands up, glances at the clock, 5 am</p><p class="p1">Then she sees her.</p><p class="p1">Rio.</p><p class="p1">Covered in soot, bruised and beat up, walking in from the hallway, breathing heavily.</p><p class="p1">Her face has some cuts and she looks exhausted but, She's alive.</p><p class="p1">Here.</p><p class="p1">Agatha stands frozen, staring at her in shock.</p><p class="p1">Then the emotions start to overcome her, and she feels her eyes stinging again.</p><p class="p1">“Hi,” Rio breathes out gently.</p><p class="p1">Agatha doesn’t know how her feet moved that fast.</p><p class="p1">All she knows is that the only thing she could do was throw herself into Rio’s body, hard, with no regard for either of their injuries.</p><p class="p1">Rio instantly wraps her arms around Agatha, holding her tight and breathing her in, face buried in Agatha’s hair.</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s tears streak down her cheeks and rub into Rio’s neck as she clings to her, holding herself up with the last of Rio’s strength after what must’ve been the longest night of their lives.</p><p class="p1">“You idiot! You didn’t answer,” she mumbles, face still pressed into the crook of Rio’s neck.</p><p class="p1">Rio, breathless, hugs her even tighter and whispers,</p><p class="p1">“It’s okay, baby. I’m okay. I’m here.”</p><p class="p1">After what seems like forever of holding each other, they pull apart just slightly, but their bodies stay tangled.</p><p class="p1">“You said you’d come back in one piece,” Agatha says, laughing softly through her tears.</p><p class="p1">“I did,” Rio replies, just as softly.</p><p class="p1">“You look like shit,” Agatha chuckles again, reaching up to lightly touch the cuts and bruises on Rio’s face.</p><p class="p1">Her voice turns small. “I saw you on the live stream in the news… you ran in. I didn’t know if I’d ever see you again.”</p><p class="p1">She pouts, that little toddler pout she does when she’s overwhelmed and trying not to cry again.</p><p class="p1">Rio slides her hand up from under Agatha’s arm, over her shoulder, and into her hair. “I didn’t know either,” she says gently. “But there were people inside. I had to try.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s voice wavers, soft, but sharp with feeling. “And me? What if you didn’t come out? Did you even think what that would’ve done to me?”</p><p class="p1">Rio meets her eyes, gaze steady and intense. “Of course I thought about you. You’re all I thought about while I was in there, Agatha. You’ve been all I can think about lately..”</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Agatha can’t take it anymore.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p4">She rises onto her toes, grabs Rio’s face, and pulls her in hard, kissing her lips like it’s the only thing that can heal her after the night she’s had.</p><p class="p4">Rio freezes at first, surprised, only kissing her back after a beat as she stumbles back a step.</p><p class="p4">It’s slow and desperate, heavy with emotion, every unsaid thing spilling into the kiss.</p><p class="p4">They stay like that, wrapped up in each other for what feels like forever, Agatha’s tears sliding down her cheeks, and Rio’s hands rubbing gentle circles along her back, holding them both upright.</p><p class="p4">The kiss starts firm, urgent, born of fear and adrenaline, but softens the longer it lingers.</p><p class="p4">It deepens slowly, like they’re both afraid to break the moment.</p><p class="p4">Agatha’s fingers curl into Rio’s hair, not pulling, just holding on. Her thumbs brush the grime smudged lines of Rio’s cheekbones as if grounding herself in proof that she’s real and standing here.</p><p class="p4">Neither of them pulls away. Not yet.</p><p class="p4">Agatha’s tears keep slipping from her eyes throughout the kisses. But she’s unbothered by them. She doesn’t care if Rio tastes the salt.</p><p class="p4">Rio notices after a while though. She pulls back just enough to rest her forehead against Agatha’s, their breaths mingling between them.</p><p class="p4">“I’ve got you,” Rio whispers, voice low and hoarse. “You’re okay. I’m okay. We’re both okay.”</p><p class="p4">Agatha exhales like she’s been holding it in for hours. Maybe she has.</p><p class="p4">She nods faintly, lips still brushing Rio’s. “I know,” she whispers back. “You’re here.”</p><p class="p4">And then she kisses her again. Slower this time. Tender. A promise. A beginning.</p><p class="p1">This time, when they pull away, Rio lingers, breath hitching, eyes searching Agatha’s like she’s weighing whether to say somethiing.</p><p class="p1">Agatha can see it, the vulnerability there, the hesitation. So she softens, smiling gently against Rio’s lips.</p><p class="p1">That seems to be all the encouragement Rio needs.</p><p class="p1">“I’ve been wondering if you felt it too,” she says quietly with a nervous smile.</p><p class="p1">Agatha lets out a soft chuckle, breath warm between them. “That’s all I’ve been feeling you dumbass.”</p><p class="p1">They lean in again and kiss softly, arms wrapped around each other like an anchor.</p><p class="p1">And then they stay that way, still and close, holding on for as long as it takes to believe this is real.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">After a few minutes, they’re standing in the bathroom again, only this time, it’s Agatha tending to Rio’s wounds instead of the other way around, like it’s been for the past few weeks.</p><p class="p1">“Why didn’t you get these taken care of? You’re hurt!” Agatha gently scolds, grabbing the first aid kit from the drawer and starting to clean Rio’s cuts, carefully placing bandages over them.</p><p class="p1">“I’m just a little bruised up. This is nothing, I’ve been through worse,” Rio chuckles.</p><p class="p1">But Agatha doesn’t laugh.</p><p class="p1">“Is that supposed to make me feel better?” she says, glaring at Rio like a mom scolding her reckless toddler.</p><p class="p1">Rio gulps. “No, ma’am. Sorry. I just… I heard your voicemails and wanted to rush back to you as soon as I was done.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha softens at that. Her hand slows on the bandage.</p><p class="p1">“I didn’t mean rush back and ignore any injuries you’ve suffered…” she murmurs. “I’m sorry. I didn’t want to add more of a burden to your life or your job than you already have. I know you said that’s why you don’t date. So… I’ll back off.”</p><p class="p1">“Hey. No! No. That’s not what’s happening.”</p><p class="p1">Rio steps closer, gently taking Agatha’s hand. Her voice is soft, a little rough from exhaustion, but certain.</p><p class="p1">“I didn’t rush back because you put any pressure on me. I rushed back because I wanted to. Because I knew you’d be worried, and I hated the idea of you sitting here not knowing if I was okay.”</p><p class="p1">She squeezes Agatha’s hand.</p><p class="p1">“Yea this is exactly what I’ve always tried to avoid. Having someone care enough to worry like that. I didn’t want anyone to have to go through it.”</p><p class="p1">Rio glances away for a second like she’s gathering her thoughts and wanting to convey them right, then she looks back at Agatha</p><p class="p1">“But tonight made it clear, keeping you at arm’s length doesn’t stop the worry. It just makes it lonelier. And I don’t want that. Not with you. Worrying about someone is a hell of a lot better than not having anyone to worry about. And I think… I’d rather have this. Even if it’s messy. Even if it scares us.”</p><p class="p1">She steps even closer now, their foreheads nearly touching.</p><p class="p1">“You’re not a burden, Agatha. You’re… kind of the only thing that’s kept me steady in every single scene i go into ever since you factored into my life.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s eyes well up again. Her mouth curves into something between a smile and a pout as a tear slips free.</p><p class="p1">"You're incredible, you know that?” Agatha says to Rio, voice trembling. “You show up for everyone, you carry so much without ever letting it show, and you still manage to make me feel safe. Even now on one of the hardest nights for you. I’m sorry I never said this before, but… I need you to know how much i appreciate everything you do for me. I don’t know what I would’ve done without you these past few weeks. You’ve been my anchor."</p><p class="p1">Rio just sits there, looking at her like she hung the moon, sang to the stars, and misted every single leaf in her apartment.</p><p class="p1">They sit in soft silence as Agatha continues quietly wiping away the soot and ash from Rio’s face and arms with a damp cloth, her touch careful, gentle.</p><p class="p1">Rio’s eyes are barely open now, and she begins to lean into Agatha without meaning to from exhaustion.</p><p class="p1">“Just sit still for two seconds, we’re almost done, you big baby,” Agatha teases softly.</p><p class="p1">Rio pouts, and Agatha chuckles, leaning in to kiss the corner of her mouth.</p><p class="p1">“Run into fires all you want, but I’ll never be convinced you’re anything but a puppy.”</p><p class="p1">“I’m just tired,” Rio whines. “Stop being mean to me.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha smiles, setting the cloth down. “Come on, Sleepy. Let’s get you to bed.”</p><p class="p1">She helps Rio down from the counter and holds her hand as they walk together to the bedroom.</p><p class="p1">Rio starts peeling off her uniform without a second thought, too exhausted to care that Agatha’s still in the room. She grabs the sweatpants and tank top that were thrown on the bed from earlier before and tries to pull them on, but her limbs are sluggish and uncooperative.</p><p class="p1">Agatha chuckles softly and steps in to help, guiding Rio into the clothes with quiet care.</p><p class="p1">Once dressed, Rio immediately flops onto the bed with a deep, bone tired sigh.</p><p class="p1">Agatha pulls the covers up over Rio’s tired body, tucking her in gently, but before she can move away, Rio grabs her hand.</p><p class="p1">“Can you stay here with me tonight please?” Rio asks softly, voice laced with nerves. She looks up at Agatha like she’s still bracing for rejection.</p><p class="p1">“We’ll just sleep. You can turn the tv on if you want,” she adds quickly, like she’s trying not to ask for too much.</p><p class="p1">Agatha doesn’t even hesitate though.</p><p class="p1">“Scoot over,” she murmurs.</p><p class="p1">Rio does, and Agatha climbs into bed beside her, settling against the headboard. Without a word, Rio lays her head in Agatha’s lap, arms wrapping tightly around her waist.</p><p class="p1">Agatha rests a hand in Rio’s hair and exhales, finally letting herself relax.</p><p class="p1">After a quiet moment, just as Agatha assumes Rio has already drifted to sleep, she hears the tired firefighter on her lap whisper,</p><p class="p1">“Didn’t think I’d ever have someone to come home to again after my parents were gone.”</p><p class="p1">Agatha’s breath catches. The weight of the confession hits her chest like a wave.</p><p class="p1">She leans down, presses a soft kiss to the top of Rio’s head, and whispers back, almost like a promise,</p><p class="p1">“I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p class="p4">They fall asleep tangled together that night, holding each other like the world might try to take them apart.</p><p class="p4">Agatha clings to Rio as if afraid she’ll disappear again.</p><p class="p4">And Rio holds onto Agatha like her second chance at having a home might slip through her fingers if she lets go.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p2">The warmth of waking up in Rio’s strong, protective arms is like waking up inside a wish she never dared to make.</p><p class="p2">Everything is quiet. Everything is still. Everything is okay.</p><p class="p2">She doesn’t want to open her eyes yet. It feels like meditating, like if she keeps them closed, she can focus more deeply on the sensations of her body.</p><p class="p2">Touch.</p><p class="p2">Rio’s touch.</p><p class="p2">Smell.</p><p class="p2">Rio’s scent.</p><p class="p2">Sound.</p><p class="p2">Rio’s soft breathing.</p><p class="p2">Agatha doesn’t think she can define what happened between them yesterday, not yet. But she liked it.</p><p class="p2">She liked the feel of Rio’s lips against hers.</p><p class="p2">
<em>She liked that part a lot.</em>
</p><p class="p2">She liked the way Rio looked at her… the way she made her feel lovable.</p><p class="p2">Somehow, without saying it out loud or even fully realizing it, Rio became hers. And she became Rio’s.</p><p class="p2">And this apartment? It became a second home before she even realized it.</p><p class="p2">It certainly felt warmer than her own.</p><p class="p2">She sits up slowly, careful not to wake Rio, and reaches for her phone.</p><p class="p2">No more kitchen experiments with a brace, lesson learned.</p><p class="p2">Instead, she orders from her favorite cafe, buttery pastries, two steaming coffees, and Rio’s beloved <em>disgusting</em> muffins, pineapple coconut and chili, because apparently her firefighter has the palate of a mad scientist.</p><p class="p2">Swinging her leg over the side of the bed, she freezes at the sound of a sleepy mumble.</p><p class="p2">“Agatha… where’re you going? Come back to bed.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha turns, smiling at the sight of Rio half buried in the blankets, hair wild. “I’m just getting breakfast,” she murmurs, smoothing a stray lock back behind Rio’s ear. “Go back to sleep, love. I’ll be right back.”</p><p class="p2">She presses a soft kiss to Rio’s forehead, feeling her relax instantly, then slips away to prepare the tray. A small vase of azaleas, freshly bought by Rio earlier this week, sits on the table, and she tucks three blooms in beside the plates to make it prettier.</p><p class="p2">Minutes later, a knock on the door. She accepts the bags, arranges the food on the tray, and heads back toward the bedroom… only to find her beautiful firefighter still sound asleep, the faint rise and fall of her chest almost lulling Agatha into crawling back under the covers.</p><p class="p2">So she does, setting the tray carefully at the end of the bed before crawling back beside Rio.</p><p class="p2">Her fingers graze over the bandages she’d placed on Rio’s cuts last night, and the touch makes Rio stir, mumbling,</p><p class="p2">“You were gone for so long.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha lets out a quiet laugh. “I was gone for like ten minutes.”</p><p class="p2">Rio’s eyes flutter open just enough to meet hers. “Longest ten minutes of my life.”</p><p class="p2">“You’re so dramatic,” Agatha teases, leaning over to nudge the tray closer. “Sit up. I got you breakfast in bed. Even got your favorite disgusting muffin.”</p><p class="p2">Rio’s head pops up instantly. “Oooh muffin.” She sits up far quicker than any injured, sleep heavy person should, making Agatha shake her head with a smile.</p><p class="p2">Rio shoves the muffin into her mouth, crumbs scattering everywhere, and Agatha remembers she hasn’t eaten since before leaving to fight that fire yesterday.</p><p class="p2">Over breakfast, they don’t talk about the kiss, or anything heavy at all, but it isn’t awkward. It’s a quiet, easy sort of awareness. They sit shoulder to shoulder on the bed, watching a ridiculous rom com Rio put on the tv, laughing at the dumbest lines, and sneaking glances at each other like teenagers with crushes.</p><p class="p2">“Thanks for breakfast,” Rio says shyly, glancing at Agatha before grabbing the tray. “I’ll take care of the dishes.” She heads to the kitchen.</p><p class="p2">A minute later, Rio’s voice calls out from the kitchen, hesitant.</p><p class="p2">“Uh… Agatha? Why is there a pan on the floor?”</p><p class="p2">Oh.</p><p class="p2">“Yeah… about that…” Agatha walks in, holding up her palm to show the faint mark. “I may have, uh, touched it while it was still hot and then dropped it.”</p><p class="p2">Rio’s brows knit. “What the hell happened?”</p><p class="p2">“I was <em>trying</em> to be nice and make you something to eat for when you got back!” Agatha gestures toward the counter, where a very sad looking grilled cheese sits cold and forgotten from the night before.</p><p class="p2">Rio stares at the grilled cheese for a solid ten seconds, dead silent, before bursting into laughter.</p><p class="p2">Agatha crosses her arms, glaring. “What’s so funny?” she grumbles.</p><p class="p2">Rio steps closer, slipping an arm around Agatha’s waist. “Nothing, baby. Just… you’re officially banned from the kitchen.” She presses her lips to Agatha’s for only the second time ever, and Agatha’s frown melts instantly.</p><p class="p2">She lifts her uninjured hand to cup Rio’s chin, deepening the kiss.</p><p class="p2">Agatha smiles into Rio’s mouth before pulling away. “Alright, alright. Enough sappy shit. What are we doing today?”</p><p class="p2">“Umm… well, it’s my day off, so I was thinking we can just chill at home and hang out together. Around noon I do have to swing by the station and drop off the incident report from last night’s fire before the captain starts breathing down my neck. But aside from that, I’m completely free.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">They sink into the couch together, Agatha leaning back against Rio’s chest, their bodies pressed close in easy comfort.</p><p class="p2">For a long while, they just sit there, watching whatever’s on tv without really paying attention. It’s quiet, calm.</p><p class="p2">“So… we’re kissing now,” Agatha says at last, breaking the quiet and addressing the elephant in the room.</p><p class="p2">She had to say it. She didn’t want there to be any ambiguity between her and the firefighter.</p><p class="p2">“I mean yes I think we are,” Rio replies without hesitation.</p><p class="p2">Agatha tilts her head to glance back at her. “So… what does that mean for us? What do you want from this?”</p><p class="p2">Rio’s lips curve into a small smile, her eyes full of something that looks a lot like hope. “I don’t know all the answers yet… but I do know I’d love to take you out on a proper date. If you’re open to it.”</p><p class="p3">Agatha feels the heat rush to her cheeks and quickly turns back to face the TV, hoping Rio won’t notice.</p><p class="p3">Rio notices.</p><p class="p3">“Uh… yeah I’d like that,” she says, trying to sound casual but failing just a little.</p><p class="p3">Around three in the afternoon, Rio says she needs to head to the station to drop off the incident report.</p><p class="p3">Agatha hesitates before asking, a little nervous, “Mind if I come with you?”</p><p class="p3">It’s not about clinging, she tells herself that, but after yesterday, the worry still lingers like smoke in her chest.</p><p class="p3">Rio, of course, says yes. They head to their rooms to get ready, the first time they’ve been apart for more than a few minutes since last night.</p><p class="p3"> </p><hr/><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">The minute they walk into the station, the whole team greets them like Agatha’s already part of the family.</p><p class="p2">“Heeeyyy, it’s Rio and the Mrs.,” calls a passing firefighter with the name tag <em>Kate Bishop</em>.</p><p class="p2">…She didn’t hate that.</p><p class="p2">Weird.</p><p class="p2">Thinking about being Rio’s wife is… intriguing.</p><p class="p2">Wait what? No.</p><p class="p2">Uh uh!</p><p class="p2">Shake it off, Harkness.</p><p class="p2">You haven’t even been on your first date yet.</p><p class="p2">“Hey, can you wait here for a sec? Just gonna drop this on the Captain’s desk,” Rio says, gesturing to the papers in her hand.</p><p class="p2">“Yeah, sure.” Agatha replies, watching her walk away.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">“Hey again! Agatha, right?” Another one of Rio’s friends passes by, smiling.</p><p class="p2">“Yeah, that’s me,” Agatha says.</p><p class="p2">“We’re just about to eat, come join us!” the friend offers.</p><p class="p2">“Oh, that’s sweet of you to offer. I’ll let Rio know and see if she's up for it,” she says with a polite smile.</p><p class="p2">Rio’s friends treat her like one of their own, and she’s never really had that before.</p><p class="p2">It’s… nice.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">“All done! Wanna head out and grab lunch?” Rio asks, walking back toward her.</p><p class="p2">“Actually, your friend just invited us to stay and eat with them,” Agatha says.</p><p class="p2">“Oh… well… you wanna? It’s totally fine if you don’t.” Rio’s voice is careful, like she’s worried Agatha might find all this enmeshment of their two lives too much too soon.</p><p class="p2">“Yeah, sure. Why not?” Agatha shrugs, and they head toward the kitchen together.</p><p class="p2">They sit and eat with the crew, and Agatha starts to wonder if this is what family feels like.</p><p class="p2">She’s never really had one, so she wouldn’t know.</p><p class="p2">This team treats Rio like blood. They tease her, laugh with her, ask about her life, and by extension, they treat <em>Agatha</em> like family too.</p><p class="p2">Someone slips a slice of pie onto her plate. Another asks how she’s feeling, how her elbow is doing.</p><p class="p2">She likes it. A lot.</p><p class="p2">And that scares her.</p><p class="p2">Having this.. having <em>them.. </em>means having something to lose. She’s spent her whole life avoiding that, keeping people at arm’s length so no one could hurt her once they saw her the way her mother always said she was.</p><p class="p2">And yes, Agatha knows her mother was a cruel cunt.</p><p class="p2">But knowing it hasn’t stopped her from internalizing every word.</p><p class="p2">She and Rio sit side by side, their hands brushing under the table.</p><p class="p2">Rio keeps trying, cheekily, to catch her hand, and while Agatha doesn’t mind, she decides to torture her a little and keep her guessing.</p><p class="p2">Just because.</p><p class="p2">Every so often, they steal glances at each other, and Agatha catches Rio’s friends across the table wagging their eyebrows and gesturing toward them, openly teasing their friend.</p><p class="p2">It’s… very amusing to watch.</p><p class="p2">They’re not girlfriends yet.</p><p class="p2">But something has shifted in the air since yesterday when they kissed.</p><p class="p2">In the way they talk, the way they look at each other, the way they laugh together with the team.</p><p class="p2">“Thanks for the meal you guys, but we’re gonna head out now!” Rio says as they stand to leave. She reaches for Agatha’s hand, and this time, Agatha takes it, lacing their fingers together without hesitation.</p><p class="p2">“Don’t be a stranger Agatha!” Captain Bishop tells her before they leave.</p><p> </p><hr/><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">As Rio drives them home, she glances over.</p><p class="p2">“I know this great place downtown… was thinking about booking us a table for tomorrow. You know, for that date we talked about. What do you think?”</p><p class="p2">Agatha smiles. “Sounds lovely.”</p><p class="p2">Rio’s face lights up at her answer. “Great! Amazing! You’ll love it, I tried it once and the food is incredible. Their chicken parm is—”</p><p class="p2">She keeps going, excitedly rambling about the menu and the chef and whatever else, but Agatha isn’t listening anymore. She’s too busy watching Rio’s side profile, thinking how damn handsome Rio looks from this angle.</p><p class="p2">Everything else just fades into a soft stream of: <em>blah blah blah… proper name… place name… backstory stuff.</em></p><p class="p5"> </p><p class="p2">“Oh hey, mind if I stop for groceries real quick?” Rio asks, snapping Agatha out of her thoughts.</p><p class="p2">“Uh, yeah, sure.”</p><p class="p2">They stop at the store, Rio pushing the cart as they wander aisle by aisle.</p><p class="p2">Agatha watches Rio toss in a few basics, then notices quietly how Rio is slipping her favorite foods and snacks into the cart as well without her asking or ever telling Rio those were her favorites.</p><p class="p2">It hits her in that soft, warm place she tries not to admit exists. Rio remembers.</p><p class="p2">And she understands now when people say to beloved is to be seen and considered.</p><p class="p2">When they get home, Rio tells her, “Go get comfortable.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha disappears for a minute and when she comes back, Rio’s at the counter, chopping vegetables.</p><p class="p2">“Alright,” Agatha says, leaning on the island with a smirk, “since I’m banned from cooking, I’ll just stand here.. keep you company, and look cute.”</p><p class="p2">Rio laughs, “I’m very okay with that deal.”</p><p class="p2">So Agatha lounges in the kitchen, taste tests the sauce, and “accidentally” leaves lingering touches on Rio’s waist and arm when she passes by her, just to see if she can get the firefighter to fluster a little.</p><p class="p2">Rio’s making them pad thai.</p><p class="p2">And so it turns out, a firefighter with strong arms who can cook is just as appealing as you’d imagine.</p><p class="p2">She hands Agatha a plate, leans in to kiss her cheek, then makes her own and sits beside her.</p><p class="p2">Yeah… Agatha could get used to this.</p><p class="p2">After that, they get ready for bed and head to Rio’s room.</p><p class="p2">The both of them.</p><p class="p2">And Without having to ask, Agatha slides in beside her with her laptop in hand.</p><p class="p2">Like she assumes Rio would want this arrangement from last night to repeat again for as long as they could have it.</p><p class="p2">She clicks open her tabs of her novel on her screen and starts typing and typing while Rio is just scrolling through social media on what Agatha knows is videos of people doing plant tours and other nerdy shit.</p><p class="p2">Now here’s the other thing..</p><p class="p2">Rio’s been curious about her writing for a while now.</p><p class="p2">Agatha can tell.</p><p class="p2">She never asks outright, but it’s obvious in the way she tries to sneak glances when walking past, or how her eyes linger when Agatha leaves the laptop open while running to the bathroom.</p><p class="p2">“Sooo… am I allowed to ask what your new book's about?” Rio blurts, her tone aiming for casual but landing firmly in <em>nosy</em>.</p><p class="p2">Agatha chuckles, eyes still on her screen. “You’re allowed.”</p><p class="p2">That’s all the invitation Rio needs to scoot closer until her head rests on Agatha’s shoulder. “Okay, so… what’s it about?”</p><p class="p2">Agatha glances down at her, lips quirking. “It’s a story based on real events. I don’t have it all down yet, but the idea came to me in the past few weeks. My editor’s already approved a few chapters. Apparently, they think it’s my best work.”</p><p class="p2">Rio grins, eyes lighting up. “Can I read it?”</p><p class="p2">Agatha pretends to think, then shakes her head. “No.”</p><p class="p2">“What??? Nooo. Come on, pleaseeee,” Rio groans, full pout in place.</p><p class="p2">“It’s not ready!” Agatha chuckles at her dramatics.</p><p class="p2">“Fine! Let’s see how you like it when I stop wearing my tight tank tops at home.” Rio turns away, flopping onto her side.</p><p class="p2">“That supposed to punish me, sweetheart?” Agatha asks with an amused grin.</p><p class="p2">Rio mumbles into her pillow, “You can’t deny it. I see the staring you do when I wear them.”</p><p class="p2">…Oops. Seems Agatha wasn’t as subtle as she thought.</p><p class="p2">Still, she won’t ever admit it.</p><p class="p2">“You’re imagining things.” She shuts her laptop, sets it aside, and scoots in close, wrapping her arms around Rio’s body. Hugging her body to her own.</p><p class="p2">Rio relaxes instantly, and they drift off tangled together.</p><p class="p5"> </p><hr/><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">The next day, they go about their routines separately. Rio heads to her shift, but texts Agatha after a few hours to <em>“be ready by 7pm<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for our date.”</em></p><p class="p2">Agatha spends most of the day buried in her writing, losing track of time until she glances at the clock and realizes she has only three hours left. Panic hits. She calls Jen immediately for backup.</p><p class="p2">“How about this one?” On FaceTime, Agatha holds up a black, form fitting dress.</p><p class="p2">Jen squints at the screen. “I like it, but it’s a little much for a first date. Try something simpler. What about that cute green top you wore when we went to that bar last time? You said Rio’s favorite color was green. This could be your secret weapon.” She smirks knowingly, and Agatha rolls her eyes, though she’s already digging through her closet.</p><p class="p2">“Yeah, yeah, I’ll wear it,” Agatha says, holding the green top up to the camera before pulling a short skirt from her closet. “And I’ll pair it with this skirt.”</p><p class="p2">Jen’s eyes widen. “<em>HOT.</em> Rio won’t be able to resist you for much longer. Your ass is finally getting laid.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha snorts, shaking her head as she tosses the skirt onto her bed. “Suck my dick.”</p><p class="p2">Jen grins wickedly, leaning closer to her phone camera. “Rio certainly will tonight.”</p><p class="p2">Rolling her eyes, Agatha reaches for her makeup bag. “Goodbye, Jennifer.”</p><p class="p2">“Text me updates later!” Jen sings out before ending the call.</p><p class="p2">Agatha applies simple makeup and curls her hair into soft waves when she hears the apartment door click open, followed by the familiar jingle of Rio’s keys hitting the tray on the side table.</p><p class="p2">“Agatha!” Rio’s voice carries from the other side of the bedroom door, warm but a little rushed. “Don’t come out yet. I’ll be ready in ten, and then I’ll knock on your door to pick you up.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha raises an eyebrow at the door, lips tugging into a smirk. “Rio… are we playing pretend? Like we’re not living together, and you’re some normal person picking me up from my own place?”</p><p class="p2">There’s a pause, then Rio’s voice drops just enough to sound sheepish. “…Maybe.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha laughs under her breath, shaking her head as she turns back to the mirror. “You’re ridiculous.”</p><p class="p2">Rio sticks to her word, exactly ten minutes later, there’s a knock.</p><p class="p2">Agatha opens the door and almost forgets to breathe. Rio stands there in a crisp, ironed button up with the sleeves rolled to her elbows, paired with perfectly tailored dress pants that Agatha is already looking forward to watching her walk in front of her in.</p><p class="p2">“You… um… you look pretty. This color on you… uh… very nice…” Rio stumbles over her words, eyes trailing over Agatha like she’s seeing her for the first time.</p><p class="p2">Agatha’s lips curl into a smug little smile. Outfit choice? Confirmed success.</p><p class="p2">“You look pretty great yourself, pretty boy.” Her voice is low, deliberately teasing as she steps past, fingertips brushing over Rio’s cheek. She heads for her purse without looking back, though she’s certain Rio’s still watching her.</p><p class="p2">Rio trails after her like the puppy she is, taking every chance to play the gentleman, opening doors, guiding her with a hand at the small of her back, fingers lacing with hers for the entire car ride.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">She’d booked ahead, of course. So when they arrive, the host leads them straight to the best table in the house, one with a perfect view of the city lights sprawling beneath them.</p><p class="p2">“They make the best gnocchi. It melts in your mouth, you have to try it,” Rio says, her voice buzzing with excitement at sharing one of her favorite spots in town with Agatha.</p><p class="p2">There’s a comfortable tension between them. Not awkward or anxious, more like suspense. The kind of charged stillness that makes everything feel sharper, as if what happens tonight might open a whole new chapter for them both.</p><p class="p2">They banter lightly over menu choices until the waiter arrives, and Rio orders for them both like a perfectly chivalrous date.</p><p class="p2">The conversation flows easily. Agatha tells Rio about Jen, how they met, how quickly they clicked.</p><p class="p2">She shares stories from her book tours, the whirlwind signings, and the outrageous fans she’s met along the way.</p><p class="p2">“And I swear to you,” Agatha says, eyes wide in mock disbelief, “this woman just drops to one knee in front of the press and proposes. With a real diamond ring.”</p><p class="p2">Rio bursts out laughing, loud and unrestrained, then covers her mouth as if realizing half the restaurant might have heard.</p><p class="p2">“What do you even <em>do</em> in that situation?” she asks, leaning forward, eyes locked on Agatha with eager curiosity.</p><p class="p2">“I just stood there in shock and looked at my agent for help. Thankfully she swooped in, told everyone the show was over, and gently let the woman down on my behalf,” Agatha says, shaking her head but smiling at the memory.</p><p class="p2">They get their food, and Agatha admits she’s impressed by how delicious and perfectly made each dish is.</p><p class="p2">Between bites, they share quiet touches, a brush of fingers here, knees bumping there, and every time it happens, their eyes meet for just a fraction of a second, inevitably darting to each other’s lips.</p><p class="p2">When the plates are cleared, Agatha asks the waiter for their best dessert. They’re soon sharing a molten brownie cake crowned with caramel drizzled vanilla ice cream, rich and warm and entirely too good to eat politely which Rio does not much to Agatha’s amusement.</p><p class="p2">“You’ve got a little something… right there,” Agatha says with a small, knowing smile.</p><p class="p2">Rio, oblivious, swipes at the wrong spot.</p><p class="p2">Without hesitation, Agatha leans in, her thumb brushing the smear of chocolate at the corner of Rio’s mouth. She brings it straight to her own lips, tasting it as her eyes stay locked on Rio’s.</p><p class="p2">Rio’s face flushes in less than three seconds.</p><p class="p2">They get the check, and after a playful back and forth (and Rio's promise to let Agatha handle the next one), Rio pays.</p><p class="p2">They leave hand in hand, the drive home wrapped in a quiet mix of comfort and anticipation.</p><p class="p2">They walk into the apartment and pause in front of Agatha’s door. Rio’s mouth curves into a goofy smile.</p><p class="p2">“So, I had fun tonight, Ms. Harkness. We should do this again sometime.”</p><p class="p2">“You’re such a dork,” Agatha says with a soft laugh. After a beat, her voice drops, warmer. “I had a great time too… and..” she meets Rio’s gaze, holding it just a second longer than necessary, “I’d like to take you out next time.”</p><p class="p2">“I would be honored,” Rio says softly, leaning in until their bodies touch and their lips meet, slow at first before melting into each other.</p><p class="p2">Rio’s hand slides to the back of Agatha’s head, keeping her close, while Agatha grips Rio’s waist with her free hand, the other still wrapped in its brace.</p><p class="p2">The kiss deepens, heat flaring as it grows quicker, harder.</p><p class="p2">It lasts what feels like hours and hours.</p><p class="p2">When they finally pull back, foreheads resting together, Agatha’s eyes darken.</p><p class="p2">“Wanna spend the night in my bed tonight?” she murmurs.</p><p class="p3">Rio nods so fast it’s almost ridiculous, grabs Agatha’s hand, and all but drags her through the door.</p><p class="p3">Agatha goes to sit on the bed, tilting her chin toward Rio in a wordless invitation.</p><p class="p2">Rio climbs onto the mattress, sitting beside Agatha. She cups Agatha’s face in both hands before diving in for a hard, urgent kiss.</p><p class="p2">They move together in perfect sync, tugging and pressing against each other until Agatha decides she’s had enough of the teasing.</p><p class="p2">In one smooth motion, Agatha lies back, bringing Rio down with her. Her legs hook around Rio’s waist, pulling her closer.</p><p class="p2">One hand slips around Rio’s waist, the other, still in a brace, rests against her side.</p><p class="p2">She tugs Rio’s button up over her head, eyes drinking in the sight. “These are so nice,” she murmurs, practically drooling over Rio’s abs and biceps.</p><p class="p2">Rio chuckles low in her throat.</p><p class="p2">Leaning down, Rio presses kisses over Agatha’s face, her neck, and down to the edge of her green top.</p><p class="p2">“Can I?” she whispers against her skin.</p><p class="p2">Agatha nods, helping her pull it off.</p><p class="p2">Rio takes her time, leaving slow, deliberate kisses over Agatha’s chest and stomach.</p><p class="p2">Agatha can only breathe in shaky bursts, occasionally trying to push back against Rio’s mouth, whispering, “Please… please…”</p><p class="p2">“I got you,” Rio breathes, stripping the rest of Agatha’s clothes away, shedding her own, and moving back over her.</p><p class="p2">Every touch is careful, reverent, so gentle it makes Agatha’s chest ache with vulnerability. It feels less like sex and more like being seen, being loved.</p><p class="p2">Rio trails kisses down, lower and lower, until she’s at Agatha’s thighs. She leaves open mouthed kisses wherever her lips land, pulling soft whines from Agatha.</p><p class="p2">When Agatha’s voice rises into desperate, shaky pleas, Rio smiles against her and finally gives her what she wants.</p><p class="p2">The first slow, soft lick makes Agatha’s whole body arch. A breathy moan slips from her lips.</p><p class="p2">“Harder.” she gasps, and Rio obeys without hesitation.</p><p class="p2">“You’re good at this,” Agatha moans, which earns her another pleased smile against her skin.</p><p class="p2">Minutes later with Rio's perfectly paced licks and sucks on her clit, Agatha is pushed to the edge, moaning, trembling, a single tear slipping from her eye as the orgasm crashes through her.</p><p class="p2">“Too sensitive, Rio, I can’t—” She pushes Rio back gently, flipping their positions so she’s on top.</p><p class="p2">Bending close to Rio’s ear, Agatha murmurs, “Let me take care of you now.”</p><p class="p2">Rio’s “yes” is whispered again and again as Agatha’s hand roams over every inch of her skin, finally sliding two fingers into her. Rio squeezes her eyes shut, biting gently into Agatha’s neck.</p><p class="p2">Agatha’s pace is deep but unhurried, every thrust deliberate, every kiss down Rio’s neck tender. It feels like being loved in return.</p><p class="p2">When Rio comes, she cries softly into Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha presses kisses to her hair, her temple, her cheek.</p><p class="p2">“That was amazing,” Rio whispers.</p><p class="p2">“It was,” Agatha replies, smiling against her skin.</p><p class="p2">They stay there for a while, tangled together, until the faint beep of Agatha’s phone breaks the quiet. It’s still in the pocket of her leather skirt, lying on the floor. She leans over to grab it, glancing at the screen.</p><p class="p2">“Oh.”</p><p class="p2">Rio tilts her head. “What’s up?”</p><p class="p2">“It’s my landlord. He says my apartment will be ready in two weeks.” Agatha’s voice is careful, her eyes flicking to Rio’s face to read her reaction.</p><p class="p2">“Ha… um, well, that’s supposed to be good news, right?” Rio asks, looking down and speaking quietly.</p><p class="p2">“I guess.” Agatha puts the phone aside, then nestles back in, resting her head on Rio’s naked chest and looping an arm around her waist.</p><p class="p2">“I’m uh.. gonna miss this… when the two weeks are up,” she murmurs into Rio’s skin.</p><p class="p2">Rio feels her throat tighten. She swipes quickly at her eyes against the pillow, hiding the tears. “I’m gonna miss coming home to you.”</p><p class="p2">They don’t say anything else after that.</p><p class="p2">Eventually, they fall asleep wrapped around each other, the air between them warmer and heavier, as if they both know something has shifted, even if neither of them dares to name it.</p><p class="p5"> </p><hr/><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">The days pass, and they sink deeper into each other’s lives. Now that they’re dating, the routines they’ve built together feel even more intimate.</p><p class="p2">They cook together, or rather, Rio cooks while Agatha wraps her arms around her from behind, offering the occasional stir of the pot or sprinkle of seasoning when asked.</p><p class="p2">Every night, they curl up in bed and work their way through all the movies they’ve been meaning to watch before Agatha moves back to her own place.</p><p class="p2">It’s sweet, but it feels like there’s a countdown in both their minds.</p><p class="p2">A quiet ticking toward the end of this phase of their relationship.</p><p class="p2">And it scares them both.</p><p class="p2">Rio takes Agatha to every doctor’s appointment for her burns and injured elbow, promising she’ll still come with her to physical therapy even after she moves out and the brace is off.</p><p class="p2">This is their life most days, comfortable, warm, steady.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">But not every day.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">One evening, Rio comes home from work… different. Quieter.</p><p class="p2">The usual spark in her eyes was gone. She doesn’t greet Agatha, doesn’t even look at her.</p><p class="p2">But Agatha knew better than to push.</p><p class="p2">She knew the kind of scenes Rio’s job threw her into, and that not all of them ended well.</p><p class="p2">So instead, she cared for her the only way she knew how, by running her a bath, scattering the leftover petals from the bouquet Rio had brought home earlier that week across the water’s surface.</p><p class="p2">She took Rio’s hand without a word, led her to the bathroom, undressed her piece by piece, and eased her into the hot water.</p><p class="p2">Agatha was about to leave her to soak when Rio’s hand shot out, fingers curling tight around her wrist.</p><p class="p2">Agatha understood instantly.</p><p class="p2">She stripped off her own clothes and slid in behind her, wrapping her arms around Rio’s waist and pulling her close until their breathing synced.</p><p class="p2">For a long moment, there was only the soft sound of water lapping against porcelain. Then, Rio’s voice broke the quiet.</p><p class="p2">“I lost a little kid today.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha’s heart dropped.</p><p class="p2">“I got everyone out, but the parents… they didn’t know their boy was home from soccer practice. He was in his room. They only realized when they saw his bike on the front lawn.” Her voice was hollow.</p><p class="p2">“I ran inside even though the flames were too dangerous. I couldn’t not try. But… it was too late. I got him out, but he’d inhaled too much smoke. He couldn’t handle it. He was gone before we even made it to the medics. I had to tell the parents.”</p><p class="p2">She turned sideways, burying her face in Agatha’s neck.</p><p class="p2">That’s when Agatha felt it, warm, quiet tears soaking into her skin.</p><p class="p2">“I’m so sorry, love,” Agatha whispered, her lips brushing Rio’s hair.</p><p class="p2">“Sometimes life is just… cruel. Sometimes it’s not in our control, baby. And I’m so sorry you had to be the one to bear it.” Her own eyes stung. “I’m here. Always.”</p><p class="p2">“Thank you,” Rio murmured, voice muffled against her collarbone.</p><p class="p2">They spent the rest of the night in bed, tangled up together, eating fruit with chocolate sauce between kisses and long, comfortable silences.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">Over the following weeks, Rio brought Agatha to the station often too, and Agatha found herself knowing Rio’s crew by name. She’d never been a people person, and still wasn’t, but something about knowing the team that had Rio’s back eased the gnawing worry when she was out on calls.</p><p class="p2">They’d been living together for two months now. Agatha’s apartment would be ready in a week.</p><p class="p2">One evening over dinner, Agatha set her spoon down, her gaze flicking to Rio. “I was thinking… we’ve been living together but only just started dating. Do you think we’re… normal? Is this.. right?”</p><p class="p2">Rio blinked, caught off guard. Agatha had never seemed like the the <em>what are we?</em> type.</p><p class="p2">“I mean…” Rio shrugged, smiling softly. “I don’t even know what ‘normal’ is, but I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t want to be it. I’ve never been one for rules or timelines. If I want anything, it’s for us to keep going. our way.”</p><p class="p2">“I like that,” Agatha said, her smile tugging wider. “I like that we’re not following someone else’s path. It’s a bit of an odd way to start something, but it’s ours.” She reached across the counter, resting her hand over Rio’s. “I never thought I’d have any of this. To find someone as great as you. So whatever the pace is, I’m in this with you.”</p><p class="p2">Rio leaned in and kissed her deeply.</p><p class="p6"> </p><hr/><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">And a week later, Agatha was now packing her things into a duffel, dread a solid weight in her chest.</p><p class="p2">The night before she was due to leave, Rio asked her to spend the day together.</p><p class="p2">They went to dinner, grabbed ice cream cones, and walked hand in hand through the quiet streets, laughing at stupid things and pretending the goodbye wasn’t waiting for them.</p><p class="p2">That night, they ended up in bed again, clinging to each other, touching like they were trying to memorize skin and breath and heartbeat. When they finally stilled, Rio lay fully on top of Agatha, pressing her into the mattress.</p><p class="p2">“I hate this. I wish you’d stay longer.” Rio whispered into the hollow of her throat.</p><p class="p2">Agatha smoothed a hand down Rio's bare back. “Rio.. I loved living with you. And i’m certain that… after some time, I’d be honored to make this more permanent, baby.”</p><p class="p2">“Yeah?” Rio asked, lifting her head, vulnerability written all over her face.</p><p class="p2">Agatha nodded, smiling through the tears brimming in her eyes. “We’re already doing this out of order. I just don’t want to push our luck and ruin it.” She brushed her thumb over Rio’s pout.</p><p class="p2">“How often can I see you then? After you move out.” Rio’s voice cracked just a little.</p><p class="p2">“As often as you want. I still need my favorite first responder to keep fussing over my injuries and dragging me to doctor’s appointments,” Agatha teased.</p><p class="p2">Rio chuckled, the sound low and warm.</p><p class="p2">“I’ll sleep over here often. You can also stay over at my place as much as you want. I can even visit the station and bring you takeout from your favorite place during your free time. We’ll figure it out.”</p><p class="p5"> </p><p class="p2">And that’s what they do.</p><p class="p2">The next day, Rio helps her pack everything.</p><p class="p2">To soften the blow, Agatha suggests Rio also pack an overnight bag and stay with her tonight in the new place so they can ease into the separation and make it feel less like a permanent goodbye.</p><p class="p2">Her newly renovated apartment looked amazing.</p><p class="p2">With fresh furniture and updated walls, Rio instantly started plotting ways to add her own touch, plants for every corner.</p><p class="p2">Agatha happily agreed, as long as Rio felt included in her life, she could do whatever she wanted to help ease the sting of being apart.</p><p class="p2">They made love in Agatha’s new bed for the first time, then fell asleep tangled together, just as they had in Rio’s home.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">The next morning was the hardest, it was time to separate.</p><p class="p2">Even if only for a little while, it didn’t make it any easier.</p><p class="p2">Rio pouted all through breakfast while Agatha made her toast.</p><p class="p2">“Come on. We’re going to see each other after your shift tomorrow. Give me a smile, handsome,” she teased.</p><p class="p2">Rio cracked, grabbing Agatha and tossing her over her shoulder, carrying her back to bed while Agatha shrieked for her to put her down.</p><p class="p2">Before leaving for work, Rio paused at the door, turning back with a wounded puppy look. Agatha rolled her eyes, dragged her back inside, and kissed her for ten more minutes before sending her off.</p><p class="p2">Agatha won’t admit to anyone that she teared up in the shower after Rio left.</p><p class="p5"> </p><p class="p2">Agatha spends the day putting her life back together, or rather, her career.</p><p class="p2">She calls Alison, her editor, and they dive into a discussion about the new book.</p><p class="p2">Turns out everyone at the agency is obsessed with the story and want her to release it as soon as possible.</p><p class="p2">After hanging up, Agatha works through the stack of mail she’s missed, orders groceries, and finally gets a text from Rio after noon.</p><p class="p2"><b>Rio:</b> I miss you :(</p><p class="p2"><b>Rio:</b> I’m so sad I won’t see you when I come home.</p><p class="p2"><b>Rio:</b> I even miss Señor Scratchy.</p><p class="p2"><b>Rio:</b> Tell him his other mami loves him.</p><p class="p2"><b>Rio:</b> I bought him three heads of lettuce so he doesn’t forget me.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">Agatha rolls her eyes but can’t stop the chuckle that escapes.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"><b>Agatha:</b> I miss you too, idiot.</p><p class="p2"><b>Agatha:</b> <em>[Image attachment of Señor Scratchy]</em> He says he appreciates your bribery very much and can’t wait to see you tomorrow.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">That night, Rio calls, and they talk for hours, long enough for Agatha to fall asleep mid conversation to Rio’s yapping about work procedures.</p><p class="p2">The next evening, Rio shows up much earlier than expected, still in her turnouts, which Agatha greatly appreciates.</p><p class="p2">“I got dinner, your favorite ice cream, and Ferdinand the snake plant. Housewarming gift.” Rio grins, her gap toothed smile on full display.</p><p class="p2">Agatha grabs her by the suspenders and kisses her so hard Rio almost loses her balance. “I really missed you,” she murmurs against her lips.</p><p class="p2">They eat, laugh, and trade stories about their day.</p><p class="p2">“So,” Rio says between bites, “are you finally going to tell me what your new book is about?” She asks after Agatha tells her how excited she is about the new release being soon.</p><p class="p2">Agatha shifts in her seat, suddenly shy. “It’s… uh… a love story.”</p><p class="p2">Rio’s brows lift. “Oh? And what’s this love story based on?” Her tone turns teasing.</p><p class="p2">Agatha mumbles something under her breath, looking away.</p><p class="p2">“Babe,” Rio says, grinning, “did you write a book about <em>us</em>?” She exaggerates the question with a dramatic eyebrow raise.</p><p class="p2">“It’s a nice story. I just thought it would make a good book, that’s all,” Agatha mutters, her words tumbling together.</p><p class="p2">“Aww, you’re just a big softy, aren’t you, Ms. Harkness?” Rio teases, climbing onto Agatha’s lap and cradling her face before leaning in for a kiss.</p><p class="p2">“I can’t wait to read it,” she says with a laugh. “See how you wrote the ending. Maybe it’ll be my cheat sheet on how to keep you.”</p><p class="p2">“Like you didn’t already have me from the moment your heroic ass carried me down ten flights of stairs,” Agatha replies with a smile and an eye roll.</p><p class="p2">Rio tilts her head. “Wait… does that mean you’re my girlfriend? Why am I just finding this out now?”</p><p class="p2">“Well, I’m not usually one for labels,” Agatha admits, “but if you need me to say it… I want you to be my girlfriend. Officially.”</p><p class="p2">Rio pretends to think it over, tapping her chin. “Hmm… I’ll get back to you.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha’s jaw drops. “Say yes right now or I’m rescinding the offer.”</p><p class="p2">Rio bursts out laughing. “I would <em>love</em> to be your girlfriend. Officially.”</p><p class="p2">“I’m.. i’m glad you came into my life busting down my apartment door and finding me,” Agatha says softly.</p><p class="p2">“I’m so happy I found you,” Rio replies, her voice catching. “And that I found my second chance at a home in you.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">At that moment, without either of them saying it aloud, they both realized it,</p><p class="p3">they were already in love, and maybe had been for a while.</p><p class="p3">Maybe it started the moment Rio stayed through the hardest time of Agatha’s life, when she still knew nothing about her.</p><p class="p3">Maybe Agatha felt it from that moment.</p><p class="p3">Maybe their fates were always meant to collide and interrupt each others’ just in time to save them.</p><p class="p5"> </p><hr/><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
<b>Epilogue</b>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
<b>3 Months Later</b>
</p><p class="p2">Agatha shows up at the station unannounced, leaning casually in the doorway as Rio steps out of the garage in full gear. The sight makes her mouth go dry.</p><p class="p2">“God, you’re unfair,” Agatha mutters under her breath.</p><p class="p2">Rio grins when she catches her staring. “You okay there, Ms. Harkness?”</p><p class="p2">“Not even a little,” Agatha replies, eyes roaming shamelessly. “You look like a calendar I’d actually buy.”</p><p class="p2">Rio’s laugh follows her all the way to the bench in the corner, where Agatha pulls a book from her bag and hands it over.</p><p class="p2">The cover gleams under the station’s overhead lights.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
<strong>Between The Flames And Her Eyes.</strong>
</p><p class="p2">Big and bold on the cover.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">“Signed copy,” Agatha says.</p><p class="p2">Rio opens it, reading the scrawled note on the title page: <em>Chapter six. That’s when I realized I was in love with you.</em></p><p class="p2">Rio’s throat tightens. “Agatha…”</p><p class="p2">“Before you get all sentimental on me,” Agatha interrupts softly, “I have a question. Move in with me. For real this time. No temporary arrangements. Just us.”</p><p class="p2">They both knew it should takes longer to move in together but they never cared for normal anyway.</p><p class="p2">They knew it’s time.</p><p class="p2">They both wanted this.</p><p class="p2">Rio’s eyes shine as she nods. “Yeah. Yes. Absolutely.”</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p2"><b>Five months later</b> <b></b></p><p class="p2">They live in a comfortable kind of chaos.</p><p class="p2">Rio’s plants spill into Agatha’s once minimalist space, Agatha’s neat shelves now share room with Rio’s scattered mugs and tools and weights.</p><p class="p2">It’s organized disorder, and somehow, it works for them both.</p><p class="p2">One rainy afternoon, Rio finds Agatha curled up on the couch, typing away, with señor scratchy chewing on the hoodie’s drawstrings she was wearing.</p><p class="p2">“You know,” Rio says, “you got your own clothes now.”</p><p class="p2">Agatha shrugs without looking up. “This one’s mine now.”</p><p class="p2">Rio crosses the room, bends down, and kisses her, slow and lingering. “My favorite hoodie thief.” she murmurs against her lips.</p><p class="p2">Agatha rolls her eyes, but the smile she hides in the kiss gives her away.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p>One year later, They get married in a small ceremony, just them, their closest friends, Jennifer, Alice, Lilia from Agatha's side and a handful of Rio’s firehouse family.</p><p>Two years after that, they welcome a baby boy named Nicholas into the world, his tiny fists already holding onto Rio’s finger like it’s the only anchor he’ll ever need and she swears she'll always protect him and Agatha and be their home.</p><p> </p><p>Five years later, Rio’s badge reads <em>Battalion Chief</em> now, a title she wears with pride.
