<b>Exceptions</b>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness hadn’t really ever seen herself becoming a mother. Her own childhood had been pretty awful, her mother a sadistic narcissist who had made the first seventeen years of Agatha’s life a living hell until she was able to escape to college a full year early. From that day, she had cut off all contact with her mother, moving across state lines just to hide from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t really want to do that to a child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But shit happens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Specifically, one night stands happen when one is so deep in the closet that they’ve allowed themselves to get drunk and swept away by a guy that kind of looks like a woman in the right light (complete darkness) and has impossibly soft hands and a hairpin trigger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Seriously, the guy hadn’t even lasted a minute, leaving Agatha wholly unsatisfied (but that could have been the whole ‘being a man’ thing) and more certain than ever that she was a lesbian.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately, approximately six weeks after this little </span>
<em>
<span>incident</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha got the disturbing news that she was expecting Mr. Sixty Seconds’ baby. Fucking fantastic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And, of course, she had never even gotten the prick’s name. Even better. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had considered terminating, but she hadn’t been able to force herself to walk into the clinic that was about a twenty-minute drive from her apartment. She had nothing against it, but her legs just would not carry herself the last fifty feet through the bullet-proof doors. It had nothing to do with the protesters outside, whom she’d given the middle finger when they cheered as she walked back to her car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She donated the money she would have spent directly to the clinic the second she got home. Then she immediately booked her first prenatal visit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even after cancelling the termination, Agatha took six months to decide she actually wanted to keep her baby. She had looked into private adoption companies and had even gotten as far as reading through a contract, but there were stipulations. Like if the child were born with certain conditions or spent too long in the NICU, it would not be considered for adoption. Agatha’s heart had ached at that, unable to fathom leaving a sick infant without anybody to love or care for them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d vetoed adoption at nearly eight months pregnant. There was nothing wrong with the child growing inside of her, as far as she knew from her prenatal visits, but she still didn’t want to risk leaving him alone. She had learned he was a boy later than she probably should have, due to the stubborn little shit’s unwillingness to cooperate. This was </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> her son.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The day he was born, she had just finished and sent in her final thesis for grad school to be checked over by her advisor. Her due date was still a week away, but her baby had been kicking her ribs like a soccer ball player all morning, so she knew something was about to happen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She arrived at the hospital before she even felt the first contractions, arguing with the doctors that it was </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> about to happen. She could feel it. They made her sit in the waiting room even still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Three hours later, she held her son in her arms in the maternity ward, smiling down at this little wriggly body on her chest. He was </span>
<em>
<span>perfect</span>
</em>
<span>. He had ten little fingers and ten little toes. His eyes were a murky brown and his little button nose sent a surge of warmth and affection through her body. She held him closely, kissing his face every now and then (she found herself unable to stop) and stroking his soft skin.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nicholas</span>
</em>
<span>. His name came to her randomly as she stared down at him. It fit him so perfectly. He looked like a Nicky, even at just two minutes old. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So Nicky he was. His middle name was </span>
<em>
<span>Scratch</span>
</em>
<span>, based on a joke between her and her nurse, Mabel, who was the second woman to hold him in her arms, cooing down at the baby, telling him that his mama had made him from scratch, so he better appreciate it. Agatha had laughed as she handed Nicky, who was now clean and dry and wrapped in a baby blue blanket, back to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicholas Scratch Harkness,” she murmured, holding him against her shoulder, pressing yet another kiss to his soft head. “It’s surprisingly nice to meet you, my love.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky was a good kid. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He was sweet and goofy and intelligent. He loved physical touch, so he was always clinging to Agatha’s side, but not in a way that irritated her. Usually, it was a hug from behind as she prepared dinner, or climbing into her lap when they watched movies together. Sometimes, she woke in the morning with him sprawled across her chest, his shaggy brown hair tickling her nose. He always held her hand when they walked down the street together, tugging on it whenever he saw anything that excited him - which was a </span>
<em>
<span>lot</span>
</em>
<span> of things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had never wanted to be a mother, but shit happens sometimes, and she couldn’t actually imagine her life without Nicky in it. She loved him with every fiber in her being and sometimes that made her…sad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not when Nicky was around, of course. It was usually after he had gone to bed that Agatha sat alone in the living room, looking at the only picture she had from her childhood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the picture, she was alone, dressed in a private school uniform on her first day of kindergarten. She was smiling, but it wasn’t quite reaching her eyes, which were slightly red. Agatha could remember the moments immediately preceding that moment, when her mother had been screaming at her over a spilled bowl of oatmeal. It had been too hot for Agatha’s little hands and she hadn’t been able to keep a tight hold on it. She had apologized profusely and immediately cleaned it up, but her mother had lost her everloving </span>
<em>
<span>mind</span>
</em>
<span> over it, regardless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had stood over Agatha as the little girl cried, apologizing with every breath she took, and screamed until her voice was hoarse. Then, as if nothing had happened, she had pulled out her camera and told Agatha to dry her tears and smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The photo caused Agatha more rage than she could ever truly express. And it confused her, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How could her mother have hated her so much, even as a child? The </span>
<em>
<span>second</span>
</em>
<span> Nicky was born, she knew that she would do </span>
<em>
<span>anything</span>
</em>
<span> for him. Anything to make him feel truly loved and cherished. She couldn’t understand how any parent might feel differently, even a parent that didn’t necessarily want their child at first, like Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The second Nicky was born, Agatha decided that she would be an infinitely better mother than Evanora Harkness had ever been - and the bar was ridiculously low to begin with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On his first day of kindergarten, Nicky clung to her leg as they walked into the school together. Agatha was just as nervous. It wasn’t as though she’d never left Nicky before (as a history professor at the local university, she’d had to leave him in the college’s daycare in order to teach her classes and earn them enough to get by) but this was </span>
<em>
<span>different</span>
</em>
<span>. He wouldn’t just be a short walk away, anymore. She’d have to drive at least twenty minutes across town if anything happened to him. She considered transferring to the community college just around the corner from the school, just so she’d be within running distance from him in case of any emergency…but that would be ridiculous, wouldn’t it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>After all, she wasn’t the only working single mother at this school. And she needed to make enough money to pay the mortgage on the house she’d bought just a year or so ago. She couldn’t leave them homeless. What kind of mother would allow herself and her child to be homeless just so she could stay close to him while he was under the care of other, just as capable adults? </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they’d reached his classroom, Agatha had debated changing careers to a teacher or a janitor or a security guard or </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> at this very school in order to be within arm’s reach of her child. Then the more logical side of her brain shot that all down as she thought of the considerable pay cut each of those careers would come with, forcing her to sell their home in a relatively nice neighborhood and move back to their old apartment building, with the spotty wifi and limited hot water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, she would stay a history professor at her university, making more than enough to keep them afloat and she’d just simply hire Nicky a bodyguard. That was a reasonable compromise, wasn’t it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama,” Nicky said, tugging on her arm, “I think that’s my teacher.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman standing outside the classroom, greeting new students and their parents, was…</span>
<em>
<span>breathtaking</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha was literally struggling to breathe normally as they approached her. Her hand tightened slightly on Nicky and she saw him glance up at her out of the corner of her eye, his little brow furrowed in confusion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama,” he said, “you’re hurting me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s grip immediately loosened at that as she looked down at him with a frown. “I’m sorry, honey,” she said, stroking his hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay,” he assured her. “I sometimes hold your hand too tightly, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not even possible,” Agatha said, smiling down at him. “You ready to meet your teacher?” Her voice was barely above a whisper as she glanced over at the woman, who was dressed in a forest green polo shirt and dark gray slacks, a pair of black Keds on her feet. Her hair was tied back in a slightly messy bun. There was a tiny gap between her teeth as she smiled at the students and parents that approached her, shaking their hands before giving the kids high fives. Agatha swooned a little bit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d been on few dates since Nicky was born. Not as many queer women were as interested in dating a single mom as she’d hoped. Her longest relationship, if it could even be called that, had lasted about three months before she was completely ghosted. Nicky had been two and a half and didn’t even remember Wanda, though he knew that his mother was interested in other women.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He’d actually taken to pointing out pretty women at the grocery store and restaurants whenever they were out, asking Agatha if she thought they were pretty, too. Agatha had been embarrassed more than once when her son asked a cashier if they were single and liked pretty girls, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d started using the self-checkout for this very reason.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think she’s pretty?” Nicky asked as they got closer to the teacher. Agatha’s eyes widened and she immediately placed her hand over her son’s mouth, glancing up at the dark-haired woman, who, thankfully, seemed not to have heard his question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What have I told you about asking me that?” she whispered, crouching down at his level.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only when we’re alone,” he said, rolling his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And are we alone right now?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky glanced around as if realizing they weren’t the only two people in this elementary school. “No?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that a question?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” he said, more definitively. “We are not alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Agatha said. “So no more questions like that. Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” he said, pressing his lips together. “But, </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes, praying for strength. She loved her son, but holy shit this kid was going to be the death of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she said, through gritted teeth. “I do. But that’s only between you and me, capisce?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what that word means,” Nicky said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means that you’re gonna keep this a secret,” Agatha said. “And not embarrass Mama. Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Nicky said, with a sigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are you sad that you don’t get to embarrass me?” Agatha asked, standing up straight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because it’s funny,” Nicky said, teasingly. Agatha stuck out her tongue at him, reclaiming his hand as she walked him toward the gorgeous teacher.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello,” the woman greeted, and her voice was warm and smooth and deep and Agatha was </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> too gay for this. “I’m Miss Vidal. And who is this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” Agatha said, clearing her throat. “Nicholas. Harkness. My son, Nicholas Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I prefer Nicky,” the boy said, his eyes twinkling with mirth, the little shit. “Nice to meet you.” He stuck out his hand to Miss Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A gentleman,” the teacher said, taking his hand in hers. “We love gentlemen in this class. It’s very nice to meet you, Nicky. Go ahead and find the seat with your name on it and say hello to your classmates.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nodded, turning to Agatha, motioning for her to come down to his level. She crouched in front of him, stroking his hair, pushing it back from his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You need a haircut,” she murmured, trying to fight back the tears that threatened to spill from her eyes. She wasn’t going to cry, goddammit. It wasn’t like she was never going to see him again. She’d see him at the end of the day. She had two classes between now and then to distract her, anyhow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Be good,” Nicky said, pressing a kiss to her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Moi</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha said, with a mock gasp, pressing her hand to her chest. Nicky giggled, wrapping his arms around her neck. Agatha pressed her face into his shoulder, holding him a little too tight as she pressed a kiss to his temple. “Be good,” she whispered, pulling back. “My good boy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Love you, Mama,” Nicky said, before turning and running into the classroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A tear escaped from Agatha’s eye as she stood, crossing her arms over her chest, watching him for a moment as he searched for his name before he disappeared from his view.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’ll be fine,” a soft voice said. Agatha turned to the pretty teacher with a smile, nodding. She was unable to speak past the lump in her throat. Miss Vidal placed a comforting hand on her shoulder that sent a frisson of electricity down Agatha’s spine. “We’ll see you at three, Mrs. Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miss,” Agatha corrected, immediately. It wasn’t the first time that somebody had incorrectly assumed. She cleared her throat as she looked at Miss Vidal. “</span>
<em>
<span>Miss</span>
</em>
<span> Harkness. Not married. And, please, Agatha is fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was technically </span>
<em>
<span>Doctor</span>
</em>
<span> Harkness, but that wasn’t really the point she was trying to make with this criminally attractive teacher, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Miss Vidal echoed with a tiny grin. “Beautiful name. Very fitting.” Agatha flushed, smiling shyly as the teacher offered her hand. “You can call me Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha said. “Like River.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Rio said, her fingers wrapping around Agatha’s hand in a firm hold. “You know Spanish?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just what was taught to us in high school,” Agatha said, shrugging. “</span>
<em>
<span>Mucho gusto, Señora Vidal.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Señorita</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio corrected with a smile. “I’m also not married.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat as they locked eyes for a moment, their hands still clasped but no longer moving - except for Rio’s thumb, which was rubbing circular patterns over the back of Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, that,” Agatha said, a little breathlessly, “is very interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it?” Rio asked, tilting her head to the side, her deep brown eyes twinkling with mirth. “How so?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to answer (completely unsure what she would actually say) but then her phone started ringing and she stepped back from the other woman as if burned, reaching into her pocket for her phone as she shot Rio an apologetic smile. The other woman shrugged her shoulders, sinking her hands into her pants pockets and looking toward the classroom, but Agatha didn’t miss the faint blush on her cheeks, which sent a thrill down her spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was nobody calling her. It was just one of the many alarms she’d set for herself, reminding her not to linger too long at the school so that she had more time to get to the university all the way in Eastview. She sighed, flicking off the alarm and turning back to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was nice meeting you,” she said. “Please call me if you have any trouble with Nicky. Anything at all. Please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He seems like a good kid,” Rio said. “I’m sure he’ll be just fine. But, yes, I will definitely call. Have a nice day, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of her name on those lips made the hairs on the back of Agatha’s neck stand up and she offered the other woman one last smile and a wave as she started back down the hall, toward the exit. “You too, Rio,” she called over her shoulder, almost as an afterthought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal didn’t grow up wanting to be a teacher, but that’s sort of where she ended up. And she didn’t regret a single bit of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d always loved kids. She’d been the eldest of seventeen grandchildren and the de facto babysitter of the majority of them since she was twelve years old. She was also pretty good in school and had even tutored some of her younger cousins for extra spending cash from her uncles and aunts. She was the only one in the family that was an only child, though she felt as though she had </span>
<em>
<span>sixteen</span>
</em>
<span> siblings. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In college, she had majored in biology and had even considered working up to get her PhD, but money was tight in her family and she decided that the cost of all the student loans that came with the advanced degree weren’t really worth it, especially in the current economy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she’d gotten her MA in early education, deciding that she could put more focus on setting kids up with good building blocks that could help them with the rest of their schooling for years to come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she met Agatha Harkness, Rio had been teaching for over a decade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had never hidden her sexuality from anybody. When she was a girl, she had her first crush on a girl in her second grade class. The girl’s name was Rosa and she had the most beautiful black curls that Rio had ever seen. And she seemed to like Rio back. The two held hands on the playground for most of the year, ignoring the teasing from some of their classmates.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rosa’s parents, however, were a little harder to ignore. They had demanded that Rio be removed from the school, that she was corrupting their little girl and condemning Rosa to an eternity in hell with her wickedness. Rio’s mother, Marisol, had fought back, standing up for her daughter, telling the other couple that there was absolutely </span>
<em>
<span>nothing</span>
</em>
<span> wrong with the way her daughter loved, that their daughter should be so lucky to be the object of her affections.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rosa’s family moved by the next school year, giving Rio her first ever heartbreak - but certainly not her last.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Growing up, she didn’t have much better luck in love. She was usually the dirty little secret that her female classmates kept from their friends and family, making out in the girls’ room or the back of the library, where nobody could see them together. In college, she had her first official girlfriend, but the relationship didn’t last past their first semester. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After that, she didn’t really have a serious relationship that lasted longer than six months at a time, with </span>
<em>
<span>years</span>
</em>
<span> in between romances, usually. She was focusing on her education, then her career, during that time, anyway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she got the job at Westview Elementary, she was pretty okay with being single. She still went out on weekends - to the only lesbian bar in town - and met petty women to warm her bed for the night, or she warmed theirs. She’d had second and even third dates, but they didn’t usually pan out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Most of her Saturday nights at The Witches’ Road were spent watching the WNBA games on the flatscreen behind the bar, cheering on her favorite teams with a cold glass of craft beer in her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The night she saw Agatha Harkness there, however, she couldn’t take her eyes off of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a month into the school year when Rio caught sight of Agatha Harkness entering the bar, practically being dragged in by an older woman with a </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> colorful cardigan, looking pretty uncomfortable in a tight, form-fitting dress, her face etched in a deep scowl. She still looked gorgeous despite this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hair fell in loose waves around her shoulders, her eyes lined in smoky purple makeup and lips painted a deep wine red, her dress plum-colored and practically painted onto her, with thin straps and an almost indecent hem. Rio felt her mouth go dry as she stared at her, missing something big that happened in the game as she was unable to tear her gaze away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was her student’s mother, which typically meant that she was off-limits at least until her son, Nicky, graduated from Rio’s class. Rio didn’t sleep with the parents of her students.</span>
</p><p>
<span>True, that was mainly because none of them had ever really shown an interest in her the way Agatha seemed to, with her slightly flirty smiles and lingering looks at drop-off (most of the moms were either explicitly straight or married and uninterested or unaware that their child’s teacher was any flavor of the LGBTQ+) and Rio was definitely getting vibes that Agatha wouldn’t be opposed to </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> happening between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that was beside the point, which was…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t really remember the point to her ‘No Dating Parents’ rule when Agatha claimed a stool with her friend on the opposite side of the bar from her. The older lady she was with had graying dark hair and a pair of glasses perched on her nose. She was poking Agatha as the other woman slapped her away and rolled her eyes. Rio didn’t miss the affection in her look, though, as she raised her hand to order them a couple of drinks. The older woman’s laugh carried across the entire bar as she shook her head at Agatha, then her gaze started to scan the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked back at the screen the </span>
<em>
<span>second</span>
</em>
<span> the woman’s gaze found hers, trying to act nonchalant as she ordered another beer, though her first was still only half-finished. She thanked the bartender - Candy, with whom she’d had a brief fling - and tried to focus on the game, but she could feel eyes on the side of her face, which was burning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She suddenly wished she had shown up in an outfit more like the kind she usually wore to bars and clubs: a loose-fitting dress shirt with a few too many buttons undone to just barely tease the edge of whatever color bra went best with it, a pair of tight-fitting slacks that showed off the enticing curve of her ass, and a pair of heels or Docs - whichever went best with her outfit. There were even times she’d worn a dress, usually green in color, though she preferred more masculine clothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tonight, however, she was dressed more in what Alice liked to call “Adam Sandler chic” with an oversized New York Liberty jersey (they weren’t even playing) and a pair of ripped, slightly baggy jeans. Her hair was under a backwards baseball cap, and she’d forgone makeup for the evening, not really planning to take anybody home after gorging herself on beer and the peanuts that the bar offered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Some ladies actually </span>
<em>
<span>dug</span>
</em>
<span> the Adam Sandler look, anyway. There was a reason Adam Sandler’s wife was so hot, after all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chanced a glance back at Agatha and her companion and found the latter staring straight at her with a lopsided grin, her eyebrow raised, lips pressed together as if she were trying not to laugh. Agatha, on the other hand, was looking down into her martini glass, wrinkling her nose adorably as a blush painted her cheeks. Her hair was draped over her left shoulder, baring the right side of her throat, and Rio bit her lip as she imagined tasting the flesh of her neck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio caught a knowing look from Agatha’s friend and turned her attention toward Candy, clearing her throat as she ordered a glass of water. She really needed to cut herself off before she did something stupid like walking over there to say–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She practically jumped out of her skin at the sound of the familiar voice, her neck snapping as she turned in Agatha’s direction. The other woman gave her a little smirk, though the blush on the cheeks was betraying her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“H-hey,” Rio replied, offering her a smile in return. “Fancy seeing you here, Miss Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wrinkled her nose. “It’s Agatha,” she said, “remember? And, technically, it’s </span>
<em>
<span>Doctor</span>
</em>
<span> Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyebrows rose at that, impressed. “Doctor?” she asked. “Really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that surprising?” Agatha asked, setting her drink down as she claimed the stool next to Rio, perching herself on it before crossing one leg over the other, tilting her head, blue eyes glimmering in the low light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “Not at all, actually,” she said. “It makes a lot of sense, actually. So, uh, PhD or MD?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“PhD,” Agatha informed her, taking another sip of her martini, then wrinkling her nose again as she placed it back. “World History.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, nice,” Rio said. “Love a smart woman. Do you work at a museum or something?”</span>
</p><p><span>“College,” Agatha corrected. “Eastview. I teach four classes. </span><em><span>History of the World</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>European History II,</span></em> <em><span>Social Hierarchies in Medieval Europe</span></em><span>, and</span><em><span> The Wicked History of Witches</span></em><span>.” She raised her eyebrows at the last one. “Can you guess which one is my favorite to teach?”</span></p><p>
<span>“Well, it’s </span>
<em>
<span>obviously</span>
</em>
<span> the second one,” Rio said, grinning as she drained the last of her beer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, shaking her head. “Absolutely </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span>,” she said. “Lilia - my friend over there -” she pointed to the older woman across the bar, who lifted her own martini at them “ - suckered me into taking that class from her this semester. Luckily, I only have about fifteen students in that one, but it’s dreadfully boring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I bet it can’t be </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> boring,” Rio said, “with you as a teacher.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a shy smile, taking another sip of her drink and wrinkling her nose once more before Rio took it from between her fingers. Agatha barely protested, frowning at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You obviously aren’t loving this,” Rio commented, pushing the drink away, then waving at Candy to get her attention. “What do you </span>
<em>
<span>usually</span>
</em>
<span> get when you’re not being peer-pressured by your colleague over there?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Scotch,” Agatha said. “On the rocks. I was trying not to go for the hard liquor tonight, though. I have to pick Nicky up tomorrow and I don’t want to be hungover.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where is he?” Rio asked. “With his dad?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He doesn’t have a dad,” Agatha huffed. “Not really. The guy was a one-night stand when I was </span>
<em>
<span>convinced</span>
</em>
<span> that I actually liked men. The only good thing that came from it was </span>
<em>
<span>Nicky.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And the realization that you don’t like men?” Rio asked, tilting her head to the side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That, too, I guess,” Agatha laughed. “Anyway, I never got the guy’s name, so I’m going to leave it up to Nicky in the future if he wants to do some kind of DNA test to find him.” She shrugged. “Currently, though, he doesn’t really seem to be missing a dad in his life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s good, at least,” Rio said, taking a sip of the water that Candy placed in front of her, nodding to her in thanks. Agatha took the glass of scotch, taking a long sip and letting out a sigh. “So, then, where is he?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sleepover,” Agatha sighed, pouting a little. “His first one. With Billy and Tommy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. Billy was another student in Rio’s class. He and Nicky were </span>
<em>
<span>inseparable</span>
</em>
<span>. Tommy, Billy’s twin brother, was in Jen Kale’s class. He was a bit of a troublemaker whereas Billy was definitely the teacher’s pet, but he was still a good kid. Rio had seen the three of them play together sometimes during recess. Their parents, Rebecca and Jeff Kaplan, were pretty nice people, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It must be tough,” Rio said, placing a hand on Agatha’s knee, trying to come off as comforting and not-at-all like she was hitting on her. “Kids grow up really fast.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, offering Rio a thankful smile in return. “Do you have any?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted, shaking her head. “No,” she said. “I do not have any children. Not that I would be </span>
<em>
<span>opposed</span>
</em>
<span> to them obviously, but I just…” She shrugged. “It just hasn’t happened for me yet. I mean, it can’t exactly happen accidentally for a lesbian who lives alone, you know?” She blushed at her own statement, clearing her throat as she took another sip of water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded in agreement. “I never thought I’d be a mother,” she said, surprising Rio. “I was nearly finished with grad school when I got pregnant, already applying for my PhD program. I was </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> certain that I would be a terrible mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio asked, shocking even herself. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> mother was terrible,” Agatha admitted. “History has a way of repeating itself. Who better to know that than somebody who spent the majority of her adult life studying history?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For what it’s worth,” Rio said, “I think you’re an amazing mom. And Nicky is a fantastic kid. I don’t think I’ve met a kid with such a kind heart, and I’ve been teaching for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “You’re, what, twenty-five?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Thirty</span>
</em>
<span>-five, actually,” Rio said. “About to be thirty-six, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened at that. “There’s no way,” she said, her eyes scanning Rio’s face. The other woman batted her lashes, pulling a playful pose. “You must be a vampire or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just have a baby face,” Rio said. “Also, thirty-five isn’t that old. The media just wants you to </span>
<em>
<span>think</span>
</em>
<span> it’s old, so they have an excuse to sell you bogus skincare products that make you look ‘younger.’” She rolled her eyes. “Anyway, how old are </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>? You had Nicky when you were, what? Twenty-four? Are you even thirty yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m thirty-one,” Agatha informed her. “I took a gap year between grad and undergrad to travel around Europe. I almost went to Oxford for grad school, but then I got a scholarship to Princeton, so I came back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Smart </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> worldly,” Rio hummed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guilty as charged,” Agatha chuckled, blushing more deeply. “How about you? Did you always want to be a teacher?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio laughed. “No. I wanted to be a biologist. Or a zoologist. Or a botanist. </span>
<em>
<span>Something</span>
</em>
<span> to do with biology. I always loved science.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So why didn’t you?” Agatha asked, taking another sip of her drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Money,” Rio said. “My mom was a single mom. We had a big family - lots of cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents - but not a big bank account. I got into undergrad on grants and scholarships from financial aid, which I am forever grateful for, but I didn’t have as much luck with grad school. A PhD program would have kept me in debt indefinitely and I didn’t think I could face that. So I switched my focus to education. Originally, I had wanted to be a science teacher for high school, but then I decided to do early education because I figured those are the building block years, you know? That’s where kids </span>
<em>
<span>start</span>
</em>
<span> their education journey. I struggled a little bit my first couple years of school because my kindergarten teacher didn’t really take the time to explain things to me, like how to write my numbers and letters correctly, or how to count. She just rushed through things. I’m not going to do that with these kids. They deserve the best chance at success, you know?” She looked up at Agatha, who was watching her with a look in her eyes that Rio had seen before, sort of. It was soft but also wanting. Like Rio was this beautiful masterpiece in front of her, confounding her, but also drawing her in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It made Rio’s entire body go hot. She took another sip of her water, then pressed the glass to her cheek, cooling herself down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” she said, “I get a little passionate about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t apologize,” Agatha said. “You’ve never even </span>
<em>
<span>heard</span>
</em>
<span> me go on and on about the history of witches. I could talk for </span>
<em>
<span>hours</span>
</em>
<span> on it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d actually like to hear that,” Rio said, truthfully. “I love witchy stuff. I do tarot, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is not surprising in the least,” Agatha laughed. “The amount of queer women I’ve met who do tarot…” She rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The difference is,” Rio retorted, “I’m actually </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span> at it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tarot is entirely subjective,” Agatha huffed. “You can’t be </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span> at it.” She took another sip of her scotch. Rio watched the way her throat bobbed as she swallowed, how her cheeks flushed as the alcohol burned down her throat. Agatha closed her eyes, pressing the now empty glass to her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I bet I can change your mind about that,” Rio said, when Agatha’s blue eyes focused on her again. “I’ve spent </span>
<em>
<span>years</span>
</em>
<span> perfecting my tarot readings. You may be shocked at what comes up in the cards.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “I doubt it,” she said, “but I </span>
<em>
<span>am</span>
</em>
<span> intrigued. Do you have your tarot cards with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I say yes, will you mock me?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely.” Agatha lifted her glass to the bartender for another drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good thing I don’t then,” Rio said. “I didn’t come here to read tarot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then why did you come here tonight?” Agatha asked, leaning in slightly. The alcohol in her system was making her bold, which Rio didn’t mind all that much except that they were entering dangerous territory. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t lean away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To watch the game,” Rio said, looking up. She frowned when she realized that the game was over and the news had come on. “Which I guess is finished now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re leaving then?” Agatha asked, frowning for a second, though Rio could tell that she was trying desperately to hide her disappointment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, shooting her a smile. “Not necessarily,” she said. “The game is over, but the night is still young.” It was only nine. Most nights, Rio was in bed by nine-thirty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tonight, she could make an exception.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And how do you plan to spend the rest of it?” Agatha asked, her voice almost a purr, her new glass of liquid courage in her hands. Rio’s pulse thrummed in her neck, warmth spreading through her body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Depends,” she retorted, picking up Agatha’s abandoned martini. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“On what?” Agatha asked, tilting her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “What were </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> hoping to happen tonight when you showed up at a lesbian bar?” She took a sip of the martini and immediately regretted the action, her entire face screwing up as she let out a wheezing cough. “Jesus Christ, what is </span>
<em>
<span>in</span>
</em>
<span> that? Battery acid? Candy, what the fuck?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just did what the old lady told me to do,” Candy said, holding up her hands in surrender. “She seems to be enjoying it. That’s her third one.” She motioned to Lilia, who was deep in conversation with another older woman, the two of them talking with their hands as much as with their mouths. She didn’t even look </span>
<em>
<span>buzzed</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is your friend an actual witch?” Rio asked Agatha, pushing the martini away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a peal of snorty laughter that made Rio’s insides melt with pure affection. “She might be,” she said, between giggles. “She was pretty much my mentor when I started at Eastview. I think she </span>
<em>
<span>also</span>
</em>
<span> studies tarot if you’d like an introduction. Something tells me you two would get along pretty well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nah, she’s busy,” Rio said, watching as the other woman leaned closer to Lilia, whose face began to flame, eyes going wide at the sudden closeness. “She might be taking somebody home, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lucky her,” Agatha said, smiling over her shoulder at her ‘mentor’. “But she was hoping that </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>would be leaving with somebody tonight. That was the whole goal of her dragging me out here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You still could,” Rio remarked, motioning for more waters, tilting her head in Agatha’s direction, pointedly. Candy filled two glasses immediately and placed them on the bar in front of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio turned back to Agatha, the woman was closer, her knee in between Rio’s, her foot on the rest at the bottom of Rio’s stool. Rio swallowed thickly as she stared into those blue eyes, willing herself not to look down into the space between the dress and Agatha’s body, where her cleavage was on full display.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You offering?” Agatha practically purred.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes, praying for strength. “Goddess knows I would </span>
<em>
<span>love </span>
</em>
<span>to, Agatha. I really would.” She allowed herself one glance down at Agatha’s body, from the heels that were just barely clinging to her feet, up the expanse of her legs to where the tight-fitting dress barely reached mid-thigh, the purple fabric (she couldn’t even tell what it was, but it was tight and form-fitting and she wanted to feel the material under her fingers as she ran her hands over the curves that it covered) that stretched across Agatha’s gorgeous body to an almost indecent neckline. She was starting to lose her train of thought, the reasons why she couldn’t do this, especially with a woman who was so obviously willing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then why not?” Agatha asked, abandoning her half-finished scotch for the water glass, taking a long sip with a soft sigh. “What’s stopping you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” Rio said, hoping that the sound of her son’s name would pour ice water over Agatha’s </span>
<em>
<span>obviously</span>
</em>
<span> amorous mood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it did. Slightly. Just not in the way Rio intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, so you don’t get involved with single parents? I’ve heard that before.” Agatha visibly deflated, reaching again for her scotch. Rio placed her hand on the other woman’s wrist, stopping her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she said, too softly. She cleared her throat as Agatha turned her gaze back, the tiniest bit of hurt etched in her gaze. “Hey. I don’t have a single problem with single parents, okay? I </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span> kids. I’d like to have some of my own, someday, maybe.” She shrugged. “I just don’t date the parents of my current students. It makes things…messy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Things already feel pretty messy,” Agatha sighed, turning her hand so that it captured Rio’s, her other hand coming up to play with Rio’s fingers. Rio shivered when the pad of Agatha’s thumb ran over a callous on her middle finger. “I think we both know that the attraction is there, don’t we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We do,” Rio admitted. “But, if we cross that line, it could get </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> much worse. I’m supposed to be a professional.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can still be a professional,” Agatha said, her voice low and so damn sexy. “I can be a professional. We can be professional </span>
<em>
<span>together.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are also </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> drunk,” Rio said even as she leaned closer, able to feel Agatha’s breath on hers now. “I don’t think I should start anything with a drunk person.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha breathed, tilting her head so that her lips would line up </span>
<em>
<span>just so</span>
</em>
<span> with Rio’s if she took the plunge and leaned in, “the night is still young, as you said. There’s plenty of time to sober up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever in that martini is worth four shots of liquor,” Rio said, leaning back, away from temptation. “That’s going to take four hours, minimum, to work its way out of your system.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I only took a couple sips,” Agatha huffed. She was still playing with Rio’s fingers. “One hour, maximum.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And the two scotches,” Rio pointed out, still not willing to reclaim her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“One and a half,” Agatha corrected. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That still makes two and a half hours,” Rio said. “Minimum. And then you have to deal with the hangover.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t get hungover,” Agatha said, a bit proudly. “Not if I drink enough water, anyway.” She took another long sip of her water. Rio snorted, reaching for her own water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To not hating ourselves in the morning,” she said, very much only talking in regards to how the hangover was almost certainly going to make them feel. But Agatha’s eyes were sparkling with mirth as they clinked water glasses, each taking a long sip as they continued to share eye contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha said, “what game were you watching?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Basketball,” Rio retorted. “WNBA playoffs.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh. Who was playing?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you actually interested?” Rio asked, leaning on the bar. “You don’t seem the sporty type.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m really not,” Agatha chuckled. “I was always the scholar at school. Kind of the teacher’s pet, which is probably why Lilia and I get along so well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia and the other woman were sitting more closely, their hands no longer waving in the air as they rested on each other’s bodies, their faces inches apart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it also because she’s a lesbian?” Rio asked with a snort. “Were you a little hot for teacher?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s my colleague,” Agatha said. “I don’t sleep with colleagues…but, yeah, I did kind of have a crush on her when I started at Eastview.” She shrugged. “She’s not hard on the eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was probably a womanizer in her day,” Rio said, glancing over again at the older woman. She must have been in her sixties, maybe seventies, but she still looked </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span>. Rio could see herself having a crush on her, too. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha whispered, glancing at her ‘colleague’. “She has a little black book with all their names. She still calls them sometimes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Legend shit,” Rio said, emptying her glass. Candy placed down two more before they even asked. “You are a queen,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Heard that before,” Candy huffed, taking their empty glasses away. She gave Rio a pointed look before walking away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the story there?” Agatha asked, shooting a pointed look at Candy, who was flirting with a cute blonde a few stools away, leaning over the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Short and not worth telling,” Rio said, taking a sip as her cheeks flamed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have two hours and,” Agatha looked at her phone, “twenty-two minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We had a fling,” Rio admitted. “It was nice, but we’re not compatible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like, relationship-wise or…” She lifted her eyebrows and Rio snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In all senses of the word,” Rio said. “Lifestyles, chemistry, preferences…all of it was mismatched with Candy.” She shrugged. “But the craft beer here is amazing, so I couldn’t really stay away if I tried. Besides, it doesn’t look like she really harbors any feelings for me.” She motioned to where Candy was plucking what looked like a phone number written hastily on a napkin from the blonde’s hand, sliding it into her bra. She turned, catching Agatha and Rio’s gaze, and winked at them, before busying herself with other patrons across the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is also the only lesbian bar in Westview, isn’t it?” Agatha commented with a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That, too,” Rio laughed. “How about you? Any notable hookups that you still see on a regular basis?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“None that I see on a regular basis,” Agatha said. “No. But I did have a relationship that lasted…a while. Not that long.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh,” Rio said, genuinely intrigued, “do tell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Her name was Wanda,” Agatha said. “She had bright red hair and a hot temper.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Naturally,” Rio commented. “Is that what led to the breakup?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, what led to the breakup,” Agatha said, “is her just deciding that I wasn’t what she wanted. This was two weeks after meeting Nicky, too. She just…disappeared from our lives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit, I’m sorry,” Rio said, her voice soft and genuine. “That’s…fuck.” She took another sip of her water, wishing it was more alcohol but not willing to add more time to their little waiting game.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “It is what it is,” she said. “She’s the only one I ever introduced to him. He doesn’t even remember her. He was barely a toddler when she left.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does he know you like women?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why wouldn’t he?” Agatha asked, wrinkling her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “I’ve been not-so-subtly encouraged not to mention my preferences in my classroom,” she revealed. “Some people think that kids are too young to know about </span>
<em>
<span>those kinds of things</span>
</em>
<span>.” She rolled her eyes. Agatha mirrored the gesture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s no different than dating men,” Agatha said, “at least as far as children are concerned. Though my mother would absolutely disagree with me on that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry about that, too,” Rio said. “I’m guessing she was unsupportive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She would be,” Agatha said, taking another long sip of water, “if she knew. I left home for college at seventeen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, smarty-pants,” Rio teased. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. “Studious, more like,” she said. “I wanted to get away from my mother so badly that I studied my </span>
<em>
<span>ass</span>
</em>
<span> off in high school and ended up skipping sophomore year, which she bragged about to all of her friends.” She rolled her eyes. “She never even suspected that I was gay because I didn’t have time for partners. Hell, </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>never even suspected I was gay until I was away at college, free to explore myself. I thought I was bi for the longest time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Until Nicky’s dad?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Until Nicky’s dad,” Agatha confirmed with a smirk. “He was an idiot in one of my Euro seminars. Failing miserably, but he was always hitting on me. I had never…</span>
<em>
<span>been</span>
</em>
<span> with a man before. I figured since I considered myself bisexual, I should probably at least </span>
<em>
<span>try</span>
</em>
<span> to have sex with a guy once, but…well, you know the rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you really don’t know his name?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It may have started with an R,” Agatha admitted. “Something exotic. Raphael, maybe? Nicky has his eyes, but thankfully no other inherited traits.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s very smart,” Rio said. “Probably the smartest in my class. He’s </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> inherited your brains.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled softly at that. “Yeah,” she said. “And he’s so sweet. I don’t know </span>
<em>
<span>where</span>
</em>
<span> the hell he gets that from. I was never that sweet as a child or even as an adult. I don’t think Raphael or Ralph, or whatever the fuck his name is, was either.” She shook her head. “He’s just…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Incredible,” Rio finished for her, blushing when Agatha looked back at her. She shrugged. “He’s a great kid. You should be very proud of him.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky Harkness was one of her favorite students, by far. He was polite and kind and whip-smart. His hand was always the first in the air when Rio asked a question, he was always the first to volunteer for help, and he stood up for other students against bullies on the playground, but he never got into physical altercations. He was a dream of a student.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am,” Agatha said. “I never thought I’d even </span>
<em>
<span>be</span>
</em>
<span> a parent, let alone one so young. I always thought that, after I achieved my PhD, I’d spend the rest of my twenties…I don’t even know. Clubbing? Dating? Finding myself? I’d probably spend a lot more time here.” She motioned to the bar. “Instead, I am doing a bath and bedtime routine with my child and I don’t think I could be happier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a good mom,” Rio said, her voice so soft and genuine. “Trust me, I’ve met a lot of moms in my career.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes immediately filled with tears and she pulled back, wiping at them. “Goddess,” she said, sniffling, “I’m sorry. I have no idea what’s wrong with me.” She reached for a napkin, dabbing at her eyes. “This is…not how I wanted this night to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s fine,” Rio said, though she was a little shaken by the tears. “It’s…I’m not a mom, but I imagine it’s good to hear that you’re doing something right? Like I said, Nicky is a fantastic kid, so it stands to reason that you’re a fantastic mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I didn’t have one of those growing up,” Agatha said, “as previously mentioned, so…” She shrugged, tears still leaking out. “Please, change the subject now. I cannot do this for,” she looked at the time, “over two more hours. Goddess, is this thing slow or something?” She shook the phone as if that would magically make time go faster. Rio chuckled, placing her hand over Agatha’s, forcing her to put down the phone on the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Patience is a virtue, you know,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck patience,” Agatha retorted. “I’m sober enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t fully disagree, but that may have just been her own horniness talking. “What was your sexual awakening?” she asked, receiving a look of shock from her companion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What kind of question is that?” Agatha huffed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“An ice-breaker,” Rio said, shrugging. “A change of subject. So, who was it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “Maybe…I have no idea. First person who comes to mind is Keira Knightley, but I don’t know which film it was, specifically. Maybe </span>
<em>
<span>Duchess</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good choice,” Rio said. “Hayley Atwell and her in that one scene…” She let out a low whistle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded in vehement agreement. “But I think I might have known even before that,” she admitted. “Maybe </span>
<em>
<span>Buffy</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vampire Slayer?” Agatha nodded. “Another good choice. Sarah Michelle Gellar was–</span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> very hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was yours?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rosa Diaz,” Rio said, smiling softly. “Second-grade. We held hands all through recess for, like, the majority of the school year. At least until her parents found out and accused me of corrupting her. She was my first love, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> parents take it?” Agatha asked, giving Rio a sympathetic look. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mom was just fine with it,” Rio admitted. “My dad passed away when I was little, but I had two gay uncles on his side. Mom assured me he would also be cool with it if he was still around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry that he wasn’t,” Agatha said softly, placing her hand on Rio’s on the bar. “My dad wasn’t around, but that was by choice, I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If what you told me about your mother is even a tiny bit accurate,” Rio said, “I’m sure it had nothing to do with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll never know,” Agatha said. “He died when I was twelve, according to my mom. Left me with some money in a college fund that </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> couldn’t touch, but I’m pretty sure that was something that </span>
<em>
<span>his</span>
</em>
<span> parents had actually left in their will, not that they knew about me, either. Their will just said ‘any biological grandchildren’ and a DNA test proved that I was one of those.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds complicated,” Rio said, raising her eyebrows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was pretty straight-forward, actually,” Agatha said. “I got a call from a lawyer when I turned eighteen. He said that my father had left me the fund to use for my education and we ironed out all the details. I ended up using about half of it for my PhD and some living expenses. The rest is going to be passed down to Nicky. It’s the only thing that man was ever good for, anyhow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Salud,” Rio said, clinking her glass with Agatha’s and taking another long sip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Salud,” Agatha echoed, taking a sip of her own water. “So,” she said, placing it back down on the bar, “got any other icebreakers?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had never met anybody quite like Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was confident and self-assured, but she shot Agatha shy smiles over her water glass, and she was good with kids. Nicky </span>
<em>
<span>adored</span>
</em>
<span> her, Agatha knew that much already, so she didn’t have to worry about introducing them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But would she have had to worry even if Rio </span>
<em>
<span>wasn’t</span>
</em>
<span> Nicky’s teacher? What if she’d been just another woman at the bar? What if this had been their first meeting. Would Agatha have even approached her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Probably. Lilia had been pretty insistent on it. She had been the one to drag Agatha out when she found out that she’d dropped Nicky off at the Kaplans for his first-ever sleepover. Lilia had even been the first to spot Rio, in her backwards baseball cap and basketball jersey with the jeans ripped at the knees. Agatha had almost not recognized her until Rio opened her mouth to say something to the bartender, revealing that familiar little gap between her teeth that Agatha found oddly attractive. She’d seen it every time she dropped Nicky off at Rio’s classroom, flashed at her from Rio’s wide, warm smiles. That smile still made her stomach do flips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia hadn’t missed the recognition that flitted over Agatha’s face at the first sight of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who is that?” she had asked, whispering in Agatha’s ear though the volume in the bar was loud enough not to need to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky’s teacher,” Agatha whispered back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh,” Lilia said. “Scandalous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” Agatha huffed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You should talk to her,” Lilia said, nudging Agatha’s shoulder. “You obviously like her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I don’t,” Agatha hissed in return. “Shut up!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, babe, </span>
<em>
<span>please</span>
</em>
<span>,” Lilia said, holding up her hand to get the bartender’s attention. “It’s </span>
<em>
<span>glaringly</span>
</em>
<span> obvious right now with the way you can’t keep your eyes off her for more than a few seconds at a time. Go ahead. I’ll be fine alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t talk to her,” Agatha hissed. “Not </span>
<em>
<span>here</span>
</em>
<span>. She’s my son’s </span>
<em>
<span>teacher</span>
</em>
<span>, Lilia. He’s only been in school for a month; I can’t hit on his goddamn teacher!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure you can,” Lilia said, sliding over one of the neon martinis that the bartender had placed on the bar for them. “All you need is a little liquid courage. Salud.” She clinked her martini with Agatha’s and took a long sip. Agatha rolled her eyes, taking her own cautious sip of the martini and immediately screwing her face up in disgust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the hell is </span>
<em>
<span>in</span>
</em>
<span> this?” she huffed. “Shoe Polish?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re such a lightweight,” Lilia cackled, taking another sip. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not </span>
<em>
<span>drunk</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha said. “Just </span>
<em>
<span>disgusted.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go over there or I’m going to make you drink the whole thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was an empty threat, Agatha hoped, but she still got up and made her way over to Rio, just in case. Besides, the two sips of the drink Lilia had practically threatened her to take were already sending warmth through her entire body and she was certain that Rio was about to reject her, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So what was the harm?</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was before they got to talking, waiting for the two and a half hour time limit on their intoxication to run out before…what? Agatha couldn’t sleep with her son’s teacher. As much as she was flirting and touching Rio’s exposed knee through her jeans and tilting her head to bare her throat and watching the way the muscles flexed in Rio’s arms as she rubbed the back of her neck and…</span>
</p><p>
<span>What was her point here? Because she forgot it even as she sobered up, the conversation between them flowing like a waterfall into a clear lake. Rio was smart and funny and </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> charming as she talked about growing up with her big family, surrounded by all her younger cousins and her aunts and uncles. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s only family growing up had been her mother, unfortunately. As far as she knew, her father hadn’t had any more children, either. None that the lawyer had been aware of, anyway. Nobody had reached out to her after his death or even after she had received the fund for college. It was interesting to hear about such a big family being so close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio’s stories were hilarious. Agatha found herself crying with laughter as Rio told her about the time they’d had a full funeral for her baby cousin, Laura’s, favorite Barbie doll after her brother, Javi, crushed her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was a closed casket,” Rio said, sending Agatha into full body hysterics, snorts coming from her nose as she struggled to contain them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That,” snort, “is,” snort snort, “adorable,” snort snort snort. Her face was flaming, but she could </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> stop, tears spilling from her eyes in her mirth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That </span>
<em>
<span>laugh</span>
</em>
<span> is adorable,” Rio said with a grin as Agatha finally started to compose herself, just barely keeping herself from falling off the bar stool.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh god, no,” Agatha said, still giggling as she attempted to take a few calming breaths. “I </span>
<em>
<span>hate</span>
</em>
<span> my laugh. I’m way too old to be snorting like a pig.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio huffed. “Says who? It’s a great laugh, really. It’s super genuine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt warm all over even as she continued to laugh, reaching out to place her hand on Rio’s knee, attempting to steady herself. She felt Rio’s hands land on her waist, helping her stay upright. Agatha found herself placing her arms on Rio’s shoulders then, looking up to meet her eyes, her face matching the flush on Rio’s as their noses brushed. Rio’s hair fell over one eye and Agatha instinctively reached up, pushing it away from her face, causing that blush on Rio’s cheeks to deepen as the other woman let out a sigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha…” Rio murmured, almost involuntarily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How much time is left?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio said again, starting to shake her head. Agatha stopped the movement with her hand cupping Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How much time?” she asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio checked her phone. “Twenty minutes,” she said, disbelief in her voice. Time had flown by. It was inching closer to midnight already.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanna go for a walk?” Agatha husked, leaning closer. Their lips were almost brushing. Agatha wanted to lean in that last centimeter or so, but she wasn’t about to push the other woman. Instead, she waited, searching Rio’s brown gaze until the other woman nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio said, the warmth of her breath on Agatha’s lips. She turned toward the bar, raising her hand but Candy was already at her side with her card and her receipt, handing her a pen to sign. Rio rolled her eyes as Agatha snorted, pressing her forehead to Rio’s chin, still fighting the giggles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt like a teenage girl. Or what she assumed she </span>
<em>
<span>would</span>
</em>
<span> have felt like as a teenage girl if she’d allowed herself to be even a little bit freer instead of studying day and night to get out of her mother’s clutches. She wondered, if she had met Rio earlier, maybe in college, what would have become of her life. Would the spark between them have been as instantaneous as it had been the day they met the first time she dropped Nicky off?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gazed at Rio as she leaned over the bar, scribbling her name before tossing a twenty on the bar as a tip for Candy. Agatha averted her gaze when Rio looked back at her, wrinkling her nose when she found Lilia with her tongue down another woman’s throat. Rio followed her gaze and let out a bark of laughter at the sight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Looks like your colleague isn’t going to miss you much, is she?” Rio said, smiling down at Agatha. She still had on that ridiculous ball cap. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Doesn’t seem like it,” Agatha retorted, shrugging her shoulders. “Let me send her a text, just in case.” She took out her phone, tapping out a quick ‘see you on Monday’ and then slipping her phone back into her pocket. “Ready to go?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, lips pressed together. Agatha could practically hear her heart pounding as she motioned for the other woman to follow her out of the bar. She shivered when she felt Rio’s hand on the small of her back as they made their way through a relatively thick crowd by the door, keeping her close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t let go as they stepped out into the chill Autumn air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio woke with a dull headache and a dry mouth, her arms wrapped around something heavy next to her. The sunlight streamed in past the curtains she had forgotten to close the night before and she buried her face into her pillow, only to freeze when something hairy tickled her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> hairy, she found as she pulled back. </span>
<em>
<span>Hair</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat straight up, unwrapping her body from the one she had been holding onto. Her entire body felt like it was on fire as she stared down at the mess of familiar deep brown curls sticking out at all angles, her eyes wide in shock as her jaw dropped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They had fallen asleep. Fully clothed. They were both </span>
<em>
<span>fully clothed</span>
</em>
<span>. That last part was only slightly a relief, but then she remembered exactly </span>
<em>
<span>who</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha Harkness was and she let out another groan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Agatha herself turned over, mouth slightly open in sleep, a trail of drool falling down her chin. Then Rio’s entire being seemed to soften as she gazed down at the other woman. She wasn’t wearing the dress that she’d show up to </span>
<em>
<span>The Witches’ Road</span>
</em>
<span> in. Instead, she was wearing a pair of sleep shorts and an oversized hoodie that Rio had loaned her after they had decided </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> to have sex.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their walk had led them straight to Rio’s apartment, which was only about a block and a half away from the bar. Rio had hesitated to invite her upstairs, knowing what it would mean, </span>
<em>
<span>knowing</span>
</em>
<span> that it would break her own unspoken rules about fraternizing with parents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she did it anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha had accepted, following her inside the building, riding in the elevator with her, not saying anything to break the unbearable tension between them until they were safely inside the fourth floor apartment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re not having sex,” Agatha had said, almost as soon as the door shut behind them, “but I would like to kiss you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as the words left her lips, Agatha was flushing bright red and looking anywhere but back at Rio, who couldn’t take her eyes off of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s fine,” Rio said, swallowing thickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The no sex thing or the kissing thing?” Agatha asked, still avoiding her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Rio said, without thinking. “Both.” Agatha’s eyes met hers then and it was like a magnet, pulling Rio in until Agatha was in her arms and she was leaning in, pausing just before their lips could make that final connection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had searched her eyes for a few moments before closing the distance between their lips, and Rio had felt as though fireworks were going off inside the apartment, her arms holding Agatha more tightly as her fingers sunk into Rio’s hair. Then she felt Agatha pushing her, walking her back until Rio was pushed into her own couch, forced to sit down as Agatha straddled her lap, grinding down at her. Rio’s hands landed on her thighs, her fingers digging in so hard that she was practically leaving bruises on the soft, porcelain skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the need for oxygen became too much, Agatha leaned back, gasping as she pressed her forehead against Rio’s, her hands cupping Rio’s cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is </span>
<em>
<span>such</span>
</em>
<span> a bad idea,” she murmured, but she didn’t let go, instead opting to press more kisses to Rio’s lips, then her cheek, then her jaw, then down her neck, her fingers raking back up to sink into her hair, finally knocking that stupid baseball cap off of her head as she painted Rio’s throat with her lipstick.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to stop?” Rio gasped, even as she felt Agatha’s teeth scrape against her pulse, moaning a little bit. “Because you just say the word and I’ll kick you to the curb. We don’t ever have to talk about this agai–mmph!” Agatha cut her off with another bruising kiss to her lips, pressing her body as close to Rio’s as she could without fully melding into her. Rio’s arms wrapped around her in return, one hand sinking into her hair as the other one wound around her waist, turning their bodies so that Agatha was beneath her on the couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t protest. At first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both got kind of swept away in the feeling of their bodies pressing together as they kissed on the couch, both of them feeling like teenagers as hands roamed over curves and lips strayed to necks, leaving lipstick stains and bite marks. Agatha opened her legs, allowing Rio to settle between them, grinding against one another as they moaned and groaned and…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No sex,” Agatha gasped out, pressing her hands to Rio’s shoulders and pushing gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio practically leapt off the couch, falling with a thud to the carpeted ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, that was a little overdramatic, don’t you think?” Agatha chuckled, looking down at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let it be known that Rio Vidal is all about consent,” Rio groaned, sitting up and running her fingers through her hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Duly noted,” Agatha said, pulling her back in by the neckline of her jersey to place another soft, lingering kiss on her lips. Agatha moaned against her mouth before pulling away again. “Ugh, this is gonna be harder than I thought.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what she said,” Rio retorted, winking up at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And suddenly, I am no longer horny,” Agatha huffed. “Actually, can you point me toward the closest convent? I am ready to accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s mean,” Rio said, with a pout. “Besides, I’m </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> certain that nuns have more lesbian sex than anyone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to get struck by lightning one day,” Agatha warned, sitting up and running her hands through her hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And it will be one hundred percent worth it,” Rio retorted. “God can’t hate me just for being correct.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t he?” Agatha snorted. “I never went to church, actually. My mother only believed in worshipping herself. She didn’t have time for any god.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She sounds…very unpleasant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have no idea,” Agatha snorted. “And you never will. I left her behind in Salem, Massachusetts, where she belongs. Let the witches deal with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you loved witches,” Rio said, with a grin. She stroked Agatha’s ankle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do,” Agatha said. “Because I grew up around them. They hated my mother, too. I’m pretty sure they would whisper curses at her when we went to the grocery store and she complained - </span>
<em>
<span>very loudly</span>
</em>
<span> - about </span>
<em>
<span>their kind</span>
</em>
<span>.” She rolled her eyes with a sigh. “I’m never going to subject Nicky to that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Speaking of Nicky,” Rio sighed. “Should we talk about…this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s not much to talk about,” Agatha said, with a shrug. “We kissed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We just made out like horny teenagers,” Rio corrected. “If you hadn’t pushed me away, I’m pretty sure it would have led to something that is </span>
<em>
<span>very much</span>
</em>
<span> not nothing.” She took a deep breath. “We should talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What would we even talk about?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How we want to handle…this,” Rio motioned between them. “Is </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> a thing now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Depends on if you want to kiss me again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know I do,” Rio said, her fists clenching in her shirt. “Very badly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then, I suppose it </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> a thing,” Agatha replied, smiling softly down at her. “Because I very much want to kiss you again, too. </span>
<em>
<span>Very</span>
</em>
<span> badly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio said. “That’s a start. But is it…are we…I don’t know how to have this discussion.” She laid back down on the ground. “It’s been at least five years since I started anything with anybody that went further than a single night.” She turned her head to look up at Agatha, who was peering at her from over the edge of the couch. “I don’t think I could take </span>
<em>
<span>just</span>
</em>
<span> one night of this, though. I’ve…kind of had the hots for you since the first time I saw you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“‘Had the hots’ for me? What are we, teenagers?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We sure act like it,” Rio said, grinning. “You make me feel like a teenager. Like I’m giddy or something. I’ve </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> been giddy.” Her cheeks warmed at the admission. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve liked you since we met, too,” Agatha admitted, smiling down at her. “The first thing Nicky asked was if I thought you were pretty. He only does that when he can see I like somebody.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” Rio asked. “Would he be okay if…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If his mother started dating his favorite teacher?” Agatha asked with a laugh. “Oh, one thousand percent.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m his favorite teacher?” Rio asked, a little breathlessly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, you’re the only teacher he’s ever had so far.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Details,” Rio said, waving her off. Agatha snorted. “So…we’re doing this? We’re dating?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I suppose,” Agatha said, smiling down at her. “But I don’t put out on the first date.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something I clearly understand,” Rio said, motioning to her place on the floor. “Do you need a lift home? Because I don’t think I’m really in any condition to drive right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was actually considering just…sleeping here tonight,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But, you said…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I said no sex,” Agatha said. “I’m far too exhausted for sex. I need </span>
<em>
<span>sleep</span>
</em>
<span> right now.” She let out a long yawn, which seemed far too genuine to be fake. “Mind if I crash on your couch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> want to sleep on the couch,” Rio said, pushing herself to her feet and holding out a hand. “You won’t be able to walk right for a week. Come on, you can sleep in my bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…” Agatha said, warningly, even as she took Rio’s hand, allowing herself to be pulled to her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just sleep, Agatha,” Rio promised. “I know how to keep my hands to myself, or was me throwing myself to the ground not proof enough of that already?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes affectionately as she allowed Rio to pull her toward the bedroom. Inside lay a king-sized bed, the only true luxury Rio allowed herself, along with the expensive sheets, pillows, and comforters. She had always loved big beds. Her three cousins had shared a bed for the majority of their childhood because it was cheaper than buying three separate ones. It was king-sized, as well, and fit all four of them comfortably whenever Rio slept over. The first thing she’d bought when she moved into her own place was a bed big enough for her to stretch out on and sink into after a long day of work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha eyed it with appreciation. “Nice,” she said. “We won’t even have to touch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unless you want to,” Rio purred teasingly in her ear. Agatha gave her a playful glare and she laughed, holding up her hands in surrender. “Kidding,” she said. “Just kidding. But you may need to change out of that,” she swallowed thickly as her eyes ran over Agatha’s body, “dress. It looks </span>
<em>
<span>fantastic</span>
</em>
<span>, but I have a feeling it’s not the best thing to sleep in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You would be correct,” Agatha said. “Alas, I did not bring anything else to sleep in, so unless you have something you could lend me, it’s either this or my underwear.” She leaned forward, pressing her lips to the shell of Rio’s ear. “And I’m not wearing a bra.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are making this </span>
<em>
<span>infinitely </span>
</em>
<span>harder,” Rio groaned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what she said,” Agatha retorted with a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio immediately fell to one knee. “Screw dating,” she said. “Marry me, Agatha Harkness. I’ll be a good stepfather to Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut </span>
<em>
<span>up</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha huffed, hitting the back of Rio’s head as she flushed. “Go get me something to wear before I decide to </span>
<em>
<span>walk</span>
</em>
<span> home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio had, choosing her most comfortable sleep clothes, allowing Agatha to get dressed and washed up in her bathroom while she got herself into a pair of sweatpants and a tank top, pulling down the comforter as she situated on the far left side of the bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha came out of the bathroom, she had a face clear of makeup, looking just as - if not infinitely more - beautiful as she had with it on. Rio’s heart stuttered in her chest as Agatha padded across the room to the bed, slipping in next to Rio, sticking to the right side of the bed as she lay down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodnight, Rio,” Agatha said, sounding utterly exhausted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached out for the lamp on her bedside table, the only light on in the room, her eyes tracing over Agatha’s figure in her bed, a sight she’d only previously dreamed of.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodnight, Agatha,” she said before shutting off the lights. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now she lay in bed, gazing at a woman she’d been unable to stop thinking about since the day she dropped her son off at Rio’s classroom, sleeping next to her in bed. At some point during the night, they had gravitated toward one another, Rio’s arms naturally reaching for her and Agatha sinking back into her embrace. It had felt…nice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio missed waking up with somebody in her bed, in her arms. She couldn’t actually remember the last time she’d fallen asleep next to a romantic partner without having had sex beforehand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop staring, ya creep.” Rio nearly fell off the bed when Agatha’s eye peeked open, so clear blue that she may as well have had the ocean in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio said, looking down for a moment, then peeking back up, smiling affectionately at her. “I can’t help myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good lord,” Agatha huffed, turning onto her back, but Rio didn’t miss the tiny grin that curled up the corner of her lips. She crawled over to the other woman, leaning over her as she allowed the curtain of her hair to surround them. Agatha smiled back up at her, fully and unabashedly. “Good morning,” she said, her voice still a little rough from sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” Rio returned, leaning down to press her lips to Agatha’s, this kiss softer and slower than any of their previous kisses had been, but no less filled with want or affection. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she pulled back, Agatha’s eyes were closed, her teeth sinking into her bottom lip as if savoring the kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t really blame her: it was a great kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she said, leaning back, still straddling Agatha’s body, “what time do you need to pick up Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a deep breath even as her hands came to rest on Rio’s thighs, her thumb rubbing absentminded patterns on her through the material of her sweatpants.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told Rebecca I’d pick him up after lunch,” she said, “so the boys had some time to play.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do we </span>
<em>
<span>also</span>
</em>
<span> have some time to play?” Rio asked, leaning down to press a kiss to Agatha’s jaw, which elicited an instant moan from the woman’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you,” Agatha said, turning her head so that Rio had easier access to the flesh of her neck, “I don’t put out on the first date.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This still counts as a first date?” Rio purred, her hands playing with the hem of the hoodie Agatha was wearing, pushing it up slightly to feel the skin of her belly, which was soft against her fingertips. She started trailing her kisses lower, tugging down the neck of the hoodie as far as she could. Agatha didn’t stop her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is until one of us buys the other a meal,” Agatha gasped as Rio ran her teeth over her collarbone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have some cereal in the other room,” Rio countered. “Technically, I bought it with my own money. I bought the milk, too. It’s almond milk though. Does that count?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Depends,” Agatha said, her own hands becoming a little bolder in exploration. “Are we talking Special K or Frosted Flakes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does it really matter?” Her mouth barely moved away from Agatha’s body, her hands pushing the hoodie up further with every word, fingers getting bolder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It very much does,” Agatha sighed, placing her hands over Rio’s, stopping them just before they reached too far up her torso for decency’s sake. “Because </span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span> is something that grownups eat, and the </span>
<em>
<span>other</span>
</em>
<span> is what I buy for my kid as a </span>
<em>
<span>treat</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a treat,” Rio said, pressing another kiss to Agatha’s lips, her tongue running over the seam of Agatha’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am,” Agatha agreed, “so therefore it would be cannibalism.” She pushed Rio’s hands away from the undersides of her breasts. “Make me some real food, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned, pressing her face into Agatha’s shoulder, her hair tickling the other woman’s nose. “Fine,” she groaned, the sound vibrating against Agatha’s neck, forcing her to let out a tiny, involuntary moan. Rio grinned as she clambered out of the bed, smoothing down her hair as she pointed at Agatha. “Don’t move,” she said. “You’re getting breakfast in bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope it’s good,” Agatha said, sitting up against the headboard, her hair still going in all different directions. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It will be,” Rio called over her shoulder as she padded into the other room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second she was gone, Agatha grabbed a pillow, pressed it against her face, and screamed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>This is a mistake. This is a bad idea. This is going to blow up in my face. This cannot happen. What the fuck was I even thinking?!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It had made so much sense the night before to follow Rio home. It had made so much sense to enter her apartment, to kiss her, to put on her offered clothes and sleep in her bed. It had made so much sense this morning to kiss her again, to allow her lips to travel down her neck, her hands to sneak under the borrowed hoodie. Just </span>
<em>
<span>seconds</span>
</em>
<span> ago, everything had made sense while Rio was in the same room with her, giving her that charming, gap-toothed grin that made Agatha’s knees turn to jelly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But now?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, Agatha had deal with her own inner-demons calling her a fucking moron, sounding like her mother as they told her all the ways this was going to fuck up her kid. Yeah, it was true that Nicky wanted nothing more than for Agatha to find a girlfriend and be happy. Hell, he’d probably be over the moon to find out that his mom and his teacher had just </span>
<em>
<span>held hands</span>
</em>
<span>, let alone that they’d </span>
<em>
<span>kissed</span>
</em>
<span>! But one day, when he understood how fucked it was, that same information would probably take </span>
<em>
<span>years</span>
</em>
<span> of therapy to work through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wouldn’t it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s phone chimed on the bedside table next to her, and she reached for it, smiling at the photo Rebecca Kaplan had sent her of their three boys, smiling up at the camera, their mouths covered in syrup as they shoveled French toast into them. Nicky had syrup in his hair. How the hell did he get syrup in his hair? Oh, he was getting a </span>
<em>
<span>long</span>
</em>
<span> bath tonight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha texted back a series of hearts, reminding Rebecca to tell Nicky that she loved him and she’d be there by three to pick him up. Rebecca responded with a thumbs up emoji. Then another pic of Nicky blowing the camera (and her) a kiss. Agatha heart-reacted it before placing the phone back down with a sigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shit was complicated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Breakfast is served,” Rio said, coming back in with a tray topped with two bowls of </span>
<em>
<span>thick</span>
</em>
<span> oatmeal and several other bowls of differing ingredients, most of which were fruit. “It just occurred to me that I have no idea what you like in your oatmeal or if you even like oatmeal, so I got a little of everything. You can just eat the fruit if you want. I can definitely down two bowls of oatmeal right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I happen to like oatmeal,” Agatha said. “What kind is it?” Rio put the tray down on the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Plain,” she said. “I usually sweeten mine with brown sugar and cinnamon, both of which I have, as you can see.” She pointed to some brown sugar packets and a spice jar of cinnamon. “Also plantains. I brought you a banana if you’re not into that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Plantains taste better,” Agatha said, with a shrug, opting for the green fruit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Marry me,” Rio said, getting down on her knees again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is the second marriage proposal,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes as she took a bite from the plantain, “and we’re not even past the second date.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can be the father that stepped up for Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” Agatha huffed, snorting. She plucked one of the freshly sliced strawberries from the platter and popped it into her mouth next. “Where did you get this fruit? It’s surprisingly good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fruit and vegetable market on the west end,” Rio said. “Freshest produce in all of New Jersey and </span>
<em>
<span>insanely</span>
</em>
<span> affordable on a teacher’s salary. You should come with me sometime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Already planning our third date?” Agatha asked, her stomach clenching at the thought even as her heart fluttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Actuall, I’m going to leave the third date planning up to you,” Rio said, “considering I’ve just paid for the first two.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes as she constructed her bowl of oatmeal, tossing some of the fruits in with some cinnamon and two packets of brown sugar. She was honestly the one who usually planned and paid for dates, allowing whatever partner she had at the time to do so only occasionally. She liked to be in charge on dates, usually. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But this was nice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They ate in silence for a while before Agatha placed her bowl back down and cleared her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t usually do this,” she started, holding up a hand when it looked like Rio wanted to interrupt. “Nicky had three daycare ‘teachers’ at Eastview when he was too young to go to school, but I couldn’t exactly teach with him clinging to my chest. One of them was a woman who had shown obvious interest in me, but I had shot her down at every turn because I just…I </span>
<em>
<span>don’t</span>
</em>
<span> do this. I don’t interfere with my son’s life, with his carers. I don’t want to make things awkward for him or for them or for myself, you know? I just…I don’t do this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Neither do I,” Rio said, placing her hand on Agatha’s knee, stopping her from continuing. “It’s always been a rule of mine to keep away from the parents of my students. Not that I really had the option, anyway, what with so few queer women showing up at parent-teacher conferences nowadays.” She let out a weak chuckle, running her hand through her hair. “But I’ve also never really felt this…drawn to somebody before. And I do feel </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> drawn to you, Agatha. I have since the first day I saw you walking down the hall with your son. You were–</span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> so beautiful. And if you want to wait until Nicky is no longer my student so that this doesn’t affect him, I’d be cool with that. I don’t want to hurt him either. He’s a pretty great kid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Marry me,” Agatha said, the words bursting from between her lips without a second’s hesitation. She slapped her hand over her mouth, her cheeks flaming as Rio gave her a shit-eating grin. “That was the oatmeal speaking,” she said. “Obviously, it’s been poisoned.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What kind of poison makes one propose?” Rio teased. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Agatha huffed. “I studied history, not biology, like </span>
<em>
<span>somebody I know.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her an affectionate smile, leaning forward to press a kiss against Agatha’s lips that she didn’t protest or even try to back away from. Instead, she let out a soft sigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can revisit this conversation another time,” Rio said, pulling back. “Maybe when we actually know what we’re doing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which is?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hell if I know,” Rio said, taking a bite from her own oatmeal. “But I think it’s clear that I like you and you like me. Do we need to know more right now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, I have a child,” Agatha said, suddenly completely serious. “A child who is in your class and who </span>
<em>
<span>adores</span>
</em>
<span> you as his teacher. Defining what </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>,” she motioned between them, “is feels very important before I leave this apartment to go pick up said child today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay,” Rio sighed. “Okay. Well, then, what do </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> want? Without thinking of Nicky or anything else about the nature of how we know each other or what implications that would have…what do you want?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You,” Agatha said, the word dropping from her lips without a second’s hesitation, her gaze longing as she stared at Rio across the bed. She felt the urge to take it back, the honesty in the simple word leaving anxiety in its wake as it stretched between them, but she couldn’t find it in herself to really care all that much. “I want you. But–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not buts,” Rio said, holding up a hand. “I know you’re worried about it. So am I. Like I said - like we </span>
<em>
<span>both</span>
</em>
<span> said - I don’t do this. I’ve been a teacher for over ten years and I’ve </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> felt this way about any of my kids’ parents like I do about you.” She swallowed thickly. “And it scares the shit out of me. But if you’re truly in this, if you really want me, want </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>, then I’m willing to make an exception. For you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is too romantic a speech to be given over oatmeal,” Agatha said, but Rio could see the unshed tears in her eyes, could hear the thickness of her voice. “You just keep making it harder to say no.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then don’t say no,” Rio said with a shrug. Her heart was pounding in her chest, her pulse thrumming in her neck. “Not if you truly don’t want to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “Okay,” she said, blinking away tears that threatened to fall from her eyes. “I’m not saying no.” She took a deep breath. “But - don’t shake your head at me, just listen, okay?” Rio pressed her lips together, nodding. “I need time. I need time to figure out a way to explain this to Nicky. I know he’ll be </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> excited about it now, but once it gets out that his mom is dating his teacher…other parents are not as understanding or accepting as he is. And some kids can be pretty shitty when they want to be, you know? I don’t want this affecting him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t have to tell anybody anything,” Rio said, reaching over the tray to take Agatha’s hand. She cleared her throat. “Except Nicky, of course. Because, well, you know…” She blushed. “But everybody else…it’s none of their business.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know if you know this,” Agatha said, “but my son is not exactly known for keeping secrets very well. Quite the opposite, actually. He’s told me what he was going to give me for Christmas and my birthday as soon as he got the gift every single time. There’s no way it’s not going to be an </span>
<em>
<span>immediate</span>
</em>
<span> announcement the second he learns that we’re together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then it’s up to you,” Rio said. “I’m not going to tell you that you can’t tell your son about us, but I don’t want to put you in an awkward position, either. I just…I don’t want this to end so soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Neither do I,” Agatha said, her fingers squeezing around Rio’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then…why don’t we take it slow?” Rio said. “Once a week, we meet up at the bar or somewhere else, have drinks or dinner, maybe kiss, maybe more…” Agatha’s cheeks went pink. Rio chuckled, squeezing her hand. “We just take it one date at a time. I’m sure Nicky would </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span> all the sleepovers he gets to have with the Kaplan boys.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s been telling people that those are his cousins, encouraging Billy and Tommy to call me </span>
<em>
<span>Aunt</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha.” She rolled her eyes, grinning. “I don’t actually mind it. They’ve invited us to spend Thanksgiving at their house next month.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m happy for you,” Rio said. “And, maybe, if this all works out, we can all spend Thanksgiving together in the future, when I’m no longer your son’s teacher.” She tried to say it casually, but she could feel Agatha’s fingers squeezing around hers, probably more tightly than she’d intended. “Too much?” Agatha nodded. “Okay,” Rio said. “That’s fine. One date at a time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One date at a time,” Agatha said, squeezing her fingers once more before letting go to finish her bowl of oatmeal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They ate in companionable silence, then washed the dishes together in the kitchen. Rio had insisted that she could do it alone, but Agatha had just rolled her eyes and pushed her sleeves up to her elbows, shoving Rio aside to make space for herself at the sink. In the end, Rio washed the dishes and Agatha dried them with a rag. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio handed off the last bowl to be dried, she leaned forward, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s lips that lasted several moments and ended up with Agatha sitting on the adjacent counter, her fingers buried in Rio’s hair as the other woman nibbled at a particularly sensitive spot under her ear, the bowl abandoned in the sink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When it was time to leave Rio’s apartment, Agatha wore her dress under the hoodie she was pilfering from Rio, promising to return it after their next date at the bar. Their kisses lingered at the door to Rio’s building while the cab idled on the curb, waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Same time next Saturday,” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going to make me watch the game with you?” Agatha sighed, her arms still wrapped around Rio’s neck, a pair of borrowed flip flops on her feet as her heels dangled from her fingers at Rio’s back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you not like basketball?” Rio asked, between kisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sports are dreadfully boring,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you wouldn’t be up for watching me play with my team this winter then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You actually </span>
<em>
<span>play</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha asked, a pink flush spreading across her cheeks as her teeth sunk into her bottom lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Rio said, “on a local league. My team is the Pistol Shrimps.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The </span>
<em>
<span>Pistol Shrimps</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha let out a bark of a laugh. “Where did that name come from?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I honestly have no idea,” Rio said, shrugging. “But our games start in November, if you’re interested. Unless basketball is really too boring for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think Nicky might be interested in that, actually,” Agatha said, playing it nonchalant. “Let me know where it is and we might show up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would like that,” Rio said, pressing her forehead to Agatha’s, pressing another kiss to her lips before pulling back. “You should go,” she said. “I don’t think you want to show up to the Kaplans’ with last night’s dress on. Or their teacher’s hoodie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good call,” Agatha said. “I’ll, um, see you next weekend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tomorrow, actually,” Rio reminded her. “At drop-off?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flushed bright pink. “Right,” she said. “Right. Um, bye!” She pressed another peck to Rio’s lips before escaping her embrace for the safety of the waiting cab.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched it go, feeling a maelstrom of emotions swirling through her, but the most prominent one was the easiest to name: </span>
<em>
<span>hope</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
