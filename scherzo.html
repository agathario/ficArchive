<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Most people hated the start of the winter quarter, but not Rio Vidal. Every year, while Rio’s colleagues bemoan the horrible weather and the miseries of teaching in a quarter system where the first day of classes starts up again almost immediately after New Year's Day, Rio is chipper and excited to be back in her element: causing absolute chaos and mayhem for her students and colleagues in the music department at Westview University.</p><p>The fact that this is Rio’s first day back at WU since taking a sabbatical to teach a semester of composition at the Conservatorio de Musica in San Juan makes today even sweeter. Rio has never considered herself to be sentimental, but she did fiercely miss her colleagues while she was away, which is why she’s come in to work a bit earlier than is strictly necessary.</p><p>Lilia is the next person to arrive in the Music faculty lounge, still shivering and shaking snow out from her hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio gets up and starts to make Lilia an espresso from the machine Lilia convinced the dean to buy for the department. Last year, Lilia’s Grammy nomination awarded her some long-deserved public notoriety and some heavy swinging power in faculty meetings, hence the espresso machine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I brought back the good beans from Puerto Rico,” Rio tells Lilia as she fills the portafilter with fresh coffee grounds. She can feel the happiness radiating off of Lilia in response. Back when Rio was a student, Lilia would try to pay for Rio’s flights home to the island to ensure that Rio brought back the precious beans from her uncle’s coffee Hacienda.</p><p>“This is the real real reason I voted yes to keeping you around and giving you tenure, honey” Lila teases and Rio wonders not for the first time how true that statement is.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I thought it was because of those songs I wrote you that secured your Grammy nom,” Rio pouts, fishing for a compliment, and Lilia just laughs.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio’s composition, <em>Songs of Sicily,</em> had been the hit of Lilia’s latest album. Well, as much of a hit as any song written for marimba, accordion, and Lilia’s soprano could be. Rio hands Lilia her freshly made cappuccino as Jen enters the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Rio,” Jen says and looks at Lilia pointedly, “You know you don’t have to make her coffee. You’re not her intern” Jen begins to unbutton her pink wool peacoat and sets it onto a coat rack.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Anymore,” Lilia says wistfully, and Jen just shakes her head and smiles.</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia, I was never your intern, <em>gross</em>” Rio pipes in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What would an intern in composition even do” Rio wonders out loud, “And why would they be assigned to the head of the voice department?” Rio wrinkles her nose. “Unless you wanted me to sing, in which case I completely understand-” Rio is cut off by a resounding and emphatic “No!” From both Lilia and Jen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Come on!” Rio smirks, “I’m not that bad”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You’re singing at the fall faculty concert in 2017 gave me nightmares for weeks,” Jen replies seriously, and Rio notices she suddenly seems very stressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My throat hurts just thinking about it,” Lilia says sweetly and pats Rio on the shoulder. Lilia continues fondly, “You were never my intern, but you did TA my Italian art song class when you were doing your masters”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen looks aghast, “You let Rio TA a class with <em>singing</em>” She balks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t let her sing, and she wanted to learn more about how to write for the voice! Also, the school had promised her a TA position, and no other faculty member was willing to work with her.” Lilia frowns and then smiles at Rio “My little hellion.” Lilia reaches out to Rio and squeezes her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Speaking of hellions,” Jen starts with a shudder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Ooh! Yes, yes!” Lilia cuts in, and a kooky smile lights up her face. “You’ve got some competition this year! Mrs. Hart in HR thinks this student may even be worse than you were.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia smiles at Rio like she knows something, and Rio knows from experience that this is usually not a good sign. Before they can continue, Alice rushes into the room. Her eyes go wide at the sight of Rio, and she runs up and wraps her arms around her. Rio goes stiff, and Jen snorts with laughter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“They let you come back!” Alice exclaims gleefully and playfully punches Rio in the shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“For the last time, I didn’t leave because of disciplinary action,” Rio grumbles. “My composition teacher from undergrad was retiring and they needed an interim” she continues testily.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“And I needed the beans!” Lilia pipes up helpfully. Alice looks confused, and Jen points to the espresso machine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Ah,” Alice nods. “Well, I’ve<em> missed </em>you. Nobody else is willing to listen to experimental jazz fusion during office hours” she grins.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Babe, I do that with you at home, you can’t seriously be upset that I won’t do it here too,” Jen lovingly admonishes and Rio looks at Lilia and pretends to gag. Lilia doesn't even have the decency to shoot Rio a sympathetic look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Anyways,” Jen continues as she takes out her laptop, “We were just telling Rio about our new <em>favorite</em> student”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Alice groans. “The girl is a monster”</p><p> </p><p>“And a genius” Lilia gives a warning look to Alice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“She made Jen cry, Lilia” Alice defends.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“She makes everyone cry,” Lilia says, almost tenderly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen scoffs and flushes red,“She didn’t make me cry”</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels something almost akin to admiration for this new student. Creating a hostile work environment was Rio’s <em>thing,</em> and she never was able to make Jen cry (Not that she’d want to, anymore. Since starting to date Alice, Jen has become significantly less terrible.) Still, Rio takes the bait.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What? Did she compare the soprano section in your choir to cats in heat or something? Because last I heard that would be a pretty accurate description,” Rio grins at Jen. Lilia groans out loud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Dude, how did you know?” Alice whispers to Rio. Rio blanches. Jen’s soprano section was quite good, as was her entire choir. Rio’s loathe to admit it, but Jen is an extraordinarily gifted choral conductor. Rio is surprised the new student would say something so nasty to Jen. She was impressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Nevertheless, Rio sees the genuine hurt in Jen's eyes, and grimaces. “I was.” Rio takes a breath, hating to diffuse what could be a fun situation, but knowing that for the good of the department, she must. “Joking.” Rio finishes, and the apology tastes bitter in her mouth as she goes on. “Your choir is good. It's really good. I’m sorry I said that.” Rio scowls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen sniffs. “Thank you”. </p><p>Rio nods curtly and asks, “Anyway, who is this cun-“</p><p> </p><p>“Billy” Lilia exclaims loudly, cutting Rio off, and gestures to Billy Kaplan as he enters the faculty lounge. <em>Didn’t he graduate last year</em>, Rio thinks bitterly. This kid had been a major pain in her ass the last four years. He was too much of a goody-two-shoes to have flunked something and be forced to do an extra year. Why was he here? It was unnatural. Rio levels a glare at him and mutters a greeting of “Teen”</p><p> </p><p>Billy, per usual, doesn't read the room. “Hey, Professor Vidal!” He cheerfully greets. “Welcome back!” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at Lilia. “Is this real? Aren’t we done with him?” Rio asks pointing at Billy. Billy takes it in stride.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m, uh, doing my masters now” Billy nervously admits and blushes. Rio groans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You didn't get in anywhere else?” Rio asks incredulously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I didn't apply anywhere else. I like the work I’m doing with Professor Proctor, and I’m concertmaster this year, and I-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio puts up a hand silencing him. Billy continues anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m just here to grab the Mahler 5 scores from Dr. Kale. I need to put Agatha’s bowings in before we give them to the orchestra today.” Billy says as he walks towards a large stack of music.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Who the fuck is Agatha and why is she making you do her work?” Rio asks, intrigued. She’s also slightly concerned. If anyone was going to take advantage of Billy Kaplan’s people-pleasing nature it was going to be Rio herself, thank you very much. Then Rio understands. Billy,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the poor sweet soul that he is, must have been tricked into doing this.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks and looks at Billy with a hint of tenderness, “Agatha’s your girlfriend, and she duped you into doing her work in exchange for sexual favors?” She asks, voice full of pity, and is surprised when Lilia, Jen, and Alice all start guffawing loudly. Billy’s face has turned so red it’s almost purple.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Professor Vidal, that is so inappropriate,” Billy stammers. “Also, you were my faculty advisor for my research project on queer composers last year, and we talked at length about my identity as a gay musician. And you bought like $200 worth of cookies from me to support the gay student alliance my sophomore year. You were our best customer.” Billy looks almost as if he’s about to cry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen snorts, and Rio tries to recover the situation. “Sexuality is fluid, and I don't make a habit of getting to know my students personally, Bailey” Rio brushes him off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Billy glares at her, “You know my name, Professor.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Okay, <em>Billiam Kaplan</em>, fine. I’m sorry, I assumed you were cool enough to have a mean girlfriend who manipulated you into doing her work for her,” Rio apologizes in a disinterested monotone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen lets out a breath and hands Billy an alarmingly large stack of scores. “Good luck, Teen” Jen tells him. “And remember, Agatha is just another student. Don’t let her intimidate you into doing her job, okay?” Jen looks at him sternly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Billy swallows. “I know she’s intense, but I don’t mind writing in the bowings. The rehearsal before break she didn't have any written in and it was chaos. If I didn't do them, I don’t think they’d get done.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio is intrigued. “I always thought bowings were stupid” she adds. “I’ve written a couple of pieces that specifically ask for the players to not talk about bowing and leave it to chance”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I remember,” Billy responds glumly. “When we did it in orchestra Eddie and I disagreed on what we thought the correct bowing for the adagio in your piece should be, and it almost split up our friend group my junior year ”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorts. “That was exactly what I was hoping for when I wrote it”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia chuckles at that. “You crazy kids and your new-fangled music” she laughs. Billy smiles and starts to head out the door.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Thanks for the scores! And Professor Vidal, I’ll see you in rehearsal! You’re my stand partner for the Mahler!” Billy cheerfully adds as he leaves, and Rio stares disbelievingly at his back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Lilia,” Rio growls, “I refuse to play under Maximoff. You know I can’t stand her.” Rio looks darkly at Lilia. “Also, why would faculty be playing in the student orchestra? And why me? Why not one of the violin teachers? Rio glowers at Lilia, and Jen and Alice don’t look nearly as afraid as Rio thinks they should. Lilia, who is never truly scared of Rio, just smiles calmly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“History repeats itself,” Lilia says and smiles that mysterious smile that Rio knows means she’s hiding something.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I have to go teach my first lesson. Alice and Jen will catch you up to speed.” Lilia slips out of the room, and Rio is left feeling tricked and a little stupid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I swear the jazz department never has drama like this” Alice says shaking her head. She gives Jen a peck on the cheek and heads out the door presumably to the safe haven of her office in the music history department.<em> Fucking nerd</em>, Rio thinks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen, now left alone with an angry Rio, finally has the decency to look nervous. She shifts her weight, crosses her arms, and clears her throat. “I, uh, only killed one of your plants while you were gone” Jen offers and Rio bites her tongue in order not to scream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio feels her jaw tighten “Which one” she grinds out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Let's go to your office and I’ll show you. I’ll buy you a breakfast sandwich on the way.” Jen offers and Rio can’t help but nod her head. She <em>is</em> hungry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio settles into her office after confirming that Jen did in fact kill only one of her many plants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a snake plant, and Rio is fairly certain she’ll be able to coax it back to life with a good trimming and a sunnier spot. Jen waits until Rio’s mouth is stuffed with breakfast burrito and then she starts to talk, taking a seat on the small black loveseat across from Rio’s desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“So,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we did email you all about this, you know” Jen starts and looks at Rio judgementally.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’ve never met anyone as vehemently opposed to reading email as you” She shakes her head. “Well, actually, maybe Agatha, but I’m convinced she just screens out my emails,” Jen grumbles.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is half listening as she eats her burrito-it’s not great. She nods her head for Jen to continue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“So, first off. You won’t be playing under Maximoff. She’s on maternity leave.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jen starts, and Rio sighs in relief.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Thank fuck. I was thinking of ways I could break an arm to get out of having to play under her.” Rio admits. She’s fairly certain Alice would help her smash her wrist in a door if she asked really nicely, but she’s relieved to avoid that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Wanda thinks you’re an excellent player, Rio. And you are.” Jen tells her seriously, and Rio rolls her eyes. She spent her childhood being a world-famous violin prodigy; she knows she’s excellent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Seriously. Your dislike of her is all one-sided, but anyway,” Jen continues. “Because of budget cuts and because Wanda will only be on leave for the winter quarter, the school is letting Wanda’s doctoral candidate conduct the orchestra this semester instead of finding a real substitute,” Jen explains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her plants and inhales deeply, waiting for Jen to continue. When Jen doesn’t, Rio speaks up. “And they need me to beef up the violin section because…? Rio asks, trying to make it make sense.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Wanda was only able to take one doctoral student last year” Jen continues slowly, and Rio wonders what any of this has to do with her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods. “I remember watching a tape of her audition. She was incredible. But the orchestra is perfectly sufficient as is. She should be satisfied,” Rio says, still unsure why this student conductor needs Rio in the room so badly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen scoffs. “She’s not that good.” And as Rio stares into Jen’s scowling face she finally starts to connect the dots. “<em>History repeats itself…She made her cry… It was chaos.”</em></p><p> </p><p>“She needs supervision,” Rio begins to laugh. “I’m not there to play; I’m just a glorified babysitter to make sure she isn’t abusing the other students.” Rio is wheezing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Jen says humorously. “I don’t understand what you find so funny, Rio. Agatha Harkness is an absolute fucking terror, and nobody else would agree to supervise rehearsal. Lilia volunteered you because she let you be her TA back when you were an absolute fucking terror, and nobody agreed to supervise you. She called it karmic justice. We put this all in an email.” Jen shakes her head at Rio in disbelief.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Okay, but why am I playing?” Rio asks grumpily, but she is intrigued nevertheless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You're too good to sit in the room and do nothing.” Jen shrugs. “And Lilia knows you need all the brownie points you can get with administration. Now they can market that the famous Rio Vidal is joining Westview orchestra.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. This whole situation seems too ironclad for Rio to get out of.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen gets up off the couch and starts to leave. “Your first rehearsal is tonight at seven. Remember, you are a forty-year-old woman, and Agatha is a twenty-five-year-old with behavioral issues. Don’t stoop to her level, okay? Jen looks at Rio pleadingly. Rio doesn’t respond</p><p> </p><p><em>Yikes, this Agatha seems to have done a real number on everyone, </em>Rio thinks<em>.</em> Rio glares at Jen, and shouts “Whatever, Mom” as Jen leaves her office. How bad can Agatha really be?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Rio takes her time getting to the orchestra rehearsal hall. The last thing she wants to be doing is attending a shitty student orchestra rehearsal, so she meanders slowly down the hall. She’s supposed to be nursing a beer with Alice at their favorite dive bar, <em>the Road</em>, to celebrate the start of the quarter. Or, if not that, then at least in the comfort of her own home without pants on. Instead, Rio has to go to this stupid rehearsal because the snowflake undergrads can’t handle a conductor with a little backbone. <em>Maximoff coddles them</em>, Rio thinks disgustingly. And now, Rio is stuck babysitting them all and wearing pants. They aren’t even comfortable pants. After she was written up for dressing ‘too casually’ last year, Rio invested in a couple of pairs of slacks. Or rather, Rio told Lilia what happened and Lilia forced Rio to go out on a shopping date to ‘update her wardrobe’. Apparently, dressing like a co-ed into middle age was not as subtle or cool as Rio had hoped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio figures that since she can’t wear comfortable clothes, she might as well try and make the clothes she’s already wearing more comfortable. She pops into the bathroom, where she loses her belt, takes off her bra, and unbuttons the first five or so buttons of her white dress shirt. If her nipples are visible through her shirt, so be it. Free the nip and all that. Rio shakes out her hair and checks her wristwatch, seeing that she is already about five minutes late to rehearsal. Perfect. Now she won’t have to make small talk with Billy Kaplan, her new stand partner. Rio shudders at the thought of Billy cheerfully prattling on about something innocuous. She sneaks into the rehearsal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Herb, can you hear yourself?” Rio hears a stern voice cruelly mock. “Do you even know what the Trumpet solo is supposed to sound like?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The voice continues, and Rio sees the mouth it comes out from, and her heart catches in her throat. Her entire body freezes, and she is almost certain little cartoon hearts are shooting out of her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And Rio is suddenly staring at the most beautiful woman she has ever seen. Mounds of wild red-brown hair are piled up on the girl’s head, staying put as if by magic. The bluest eyes Rio could imagine are absolutely eviscerating Herb, the trumpet player (<em>Senior, failed the final exam in Rio’s orchestration class last year and had to take the course twice- </em>Rio remembers). A perfectly imperfect nose scrunches up, and lips that Rio thinks she could write poetry about scowl. This must be Agatha. Twenty-five-year-old <em>student</em> Agatha. Fuckity fucking fuck. But, Rio reasons, back in Lilia’s generation, post-grad students like Agatha used to be in relationships with their supervisors and professors all the time. Lilia got married during the first year of her masters, and her first husband was her voicer teacher, Rio remembers with only a mild hint of distaste.</p><p> </p><p>“Again, Herb,” Agatha demands cooly from her conductor's stool, and Rio, skeptical, cold-hearted, chaotic Rio, decides then and there that she is in love with Agatha Harkness. At forty years old, Rio has never experienced love at first sight, but she knows this is it. She understands why men go to war, why Van Gogh cut off his ear, and suddenly Rio has the inspiration to write tens of thousands of hours of music. Rio has finally found her muse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth goes dry, and her heart becomes twitchy. Something curdles in her stomach. Meanwhile, Herb seems to be making up an improvisation instead of playing the trumpet solo he’s been tasked with.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans loudly. “Herb, what the <em>fuck</em>” and shakes her beautiful head. Rio wants to know what the inside of her mouth tastes like.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Fix it by tomorrow, or you’re getting an F this quarter. Get out of my rehearsal and don’t come back until it’s perfect,” Agatha glares at Herb, who looks like he wants to cry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio's snort of laughter is too loud, and she tries to cover it with a cough. Rio blushes as she makes her way to Billy Kaplan. She’s surprised to see that he’s not first chair. Instead, the spot is left open-presumably for her. Rio goes to sit. This is when Rio realizes her big mistake.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She does not have her violin. Admittedly, Rio knew this and wasn’t concerned. She was going to sit through rehearsals and maybe, if Agatha was lucky, show up with her instrument and play at some point before the concert. Probably the final dress rehearsal. This was Rio’s plan before she decided that Agatha Harkness was going to be her wife. Now, she couldn’t imagine doing something so cruel to her beloved, who is just trying to shepherd a student orchestra through Mahler’s famously tricky fifth symphony. How could Rio not be the perfect concertmaster for her?</p><p>Agatha sighs and glares out at her orchestra. Rio can feel the tension in the room, and it’s <em>delicious.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifts her hands in preparation for a downbeat. “From rehearsal marking B,” she commands, and Rio feels a familiar stirring low in her belly. <em>Christ,</em> she thinks. Then, with terror, Rio remembers that the concertmaster has a sizable solo in this movement. Without her instrument, Rio does not have a way to play it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Billy” Rio hisses as she sees him get into position, “give me your violin”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Billy looks at her incredulously. Idiot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I need your instrument. Now.” Rio repeats.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Billy must see the wild panic in Rio’s eyes and he nods silently, handing over his instrument. Rio could cry from relief. The weight of Billy’s violin feels solid in her hands. She lifts it into position and begins to play.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Agatha’s elegant hands shape the music and command Rio’s every move. Rio looks directly into Agatha’s eyes as she plays, and the rest of the room melts away. Rio played Mahler Five with the Philharmonic when she was eight years old in San Juan. The notes come back to her nimble fingers just like they always do, and Rio doesn’t need to look at the music. She can focus entirely on Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bow gliding across the strings feels like coming home. Rio, slightly shocked, realizes she’s missed playing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The first movement starts to deteriorate. The cellos are flat. The wind instruments are three measures behind everyone else, and without the trumpet solos, the entire piece is falling apart. None of this is Agatha’s fault, Rio reasons. Agatha’s beat patterns are clear and frankly stunning. Her shaping is exquisite. That is until Agatha throws her hands into the air and screams.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Stop” she shouts, and Rio is alarmed by how sexy she finds this. She’s not quite scared, but she certainly doesn’t feel at ease.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath to calm herself. Rio has to stop herself from getting up and trying to brush a fallen piece of Agatha’s hair out of her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I knew this wasn’t going to be good, but I didn’t realize it would be horrendous” Agatha speaks plainly to the entire orchestra. Rio feels shame in her gut, unfamiliar and dizzying.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Everyone except for Professor Vidal, was atrocious” Agatha hums. Rio feels like she can breathe again. She feels wetness in her underwear and casually wonders if she’s going to leave a mark on the chair. Agatha knows her name.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And Kaplan, where the fuck is your violin?” Agatha glares at Billy who has been patiently sitting in his seat doing nothing as Rio played his instrument.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I let Profess-” Billy starts and Rio kicks him in the shins. Hard. Billy looks at Rio accusingly, and Rio just glowers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’ll bring it next time. I’m sorry” he mumbles sheepishly and glares at Rio. Agatha smiles, but it’s mostly teeth and Rio feels her palms grow sweaty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha blows a raspberry and turns around to check the timer on the wall. She turns back and stares out at her orchestra, saying nothing as the last thirty seconds on the clock run down. Everybody is completely silent, staring back at her. Rio has never seen anyone command a room so completely and viciously. When the timer is up, Agatha makes a dismissive gesture with her hands, and the orchestra begins to pack up and leave.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio wordlessly hands Billy his instrument back, and without thinking about what she’s doing makes her way to Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“We need to talk about what just happened,” Rio says breathlessly as she realizes that Agatha is even more devastatingly gorgeous up close.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks, and sizes Rio up as if preparing for a fight. Rio’s hands itch to touch her. “Dr. Maximoff warned me about you,” Agatha tells Rio sternly, but Rio swears she can see a hint of a smile behind her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio breathes in and tries to muster up some courage “Agatha, I really think we need to discuss this” Rio states and Agatha won’t quite meet her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues as if Rio hadn’t said anything, “And I mean, I’d heard of you and seen the videos from when you were a kid, but I guess I wasn’t prepared to see you in person. I’ve never seen anyone<em> play</em> like that in person,”</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Agatha continues, shaking her head. “And on Billy Kaplan’s shitty little violin.” Agatha pauses for a moment,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>looking up at Rio through impossibly thick eyelashes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Professor Vidal, you are magnificent,” Agatha breathes out, and Rio can feel her cheeks darken.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You knew it wasn’t mine? Why would you ask him where his violin was if you knew I was playing on it?” Rio asks astonished and wonders what Agatha’s breasts would feel like in her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes glint with mischief, and she shrugs “I guess I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>like to watch him squirm,” She says, and Rio debates getting on her knees right there in the rehearsal hall. Most of the students were already gone, anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Rio uses all of her self-restraint and manages to stay off her knees and a foot away from Agatha. “We need to discuss this,” Rio says, and Agatha looks disappointed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I know the way I run a rehearsal is a little old school, but I don’t think my etiquette was so bad that we need to break it down tonight” Agatha huffs defensively and Rio’s jaw drops open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You think I have notes on your behavior?” Rio asks and notices that Agatha’s eyes have dipped down to her shirt, where her nipples are clearly visible, and pointed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Hm?” Agatha says looking up, and Rio sees something new in Agatha’s gaze. A raw hunger that wasn’t there just a moment ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I think we should go to my office and have a chat,” Rio tells Agatha and looks at her pointedly. Agatha finally seems to be picking up what Rio is putting down and Rio feels the abrupt shift in power.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Follow me,” Rio orders and walks out. She says a silent prayer, hoping that Agatha understands what she’s trying to do and that this doesn't turn into a Title Nine disaster. Rio picks up her pace and grins when she hears Agatha’s footsteps fall behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s office was only a few doors down from the rehearsal hall, but the walk could have been miles. Rio’s sense of time and space is shattered. When she finally reaches her office and unlocks the door, she turns and sees Agatha slightly flushed behind her. She looks so young, so delicious, so perfect. <em>Has Agatha ever done this before? </em>Rio wonders. Rio was no saint, but it was unheard of for her to move so quickly. She never had one-night stands and usually didn’t even try anything physical until after a few dates with a woman. But this is different. Never in all of her life has Rio felt a need like this. She swallows heavily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio tries to imagine Agatha hooking up with someone, and the idea of Agatha with another person is anathema. Agatha is such a brilliant and diligent student. Surely, she doesn’t have time for distractions and casual sex.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha is breathless as she enters Rio’s office, and her mouth is open slightly. She looks at Rio with a knowing smirk. “So, what do you want to discuss?” she asks, sarcasm dripping from her words, and Rio crumbles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio quickly closes and locks the door. She hurriedly pushes Agatha onto the loveseat and gets down to her knees in front of her. Agatha’s grin doubles in size.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Is this okay?” Rio asks looking up into Agatha’s eyes, getting lost for a moment. Agatha bites her lip and nods. Rio, to her own absolute mortification, whimpers softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I want to taste you” Rio begs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Please” Agatha hums, and Agatha begins to card her fingers through Rio’s hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio undoes the zipper of Agatha’s plum dress pants and shimmies them down her legs. Agatha reaches out and tilts Rio’s head up. Agatha gently runs her thumb along Rio’s lips. Rio opens her lips and wraps her tongue around Agatha’s thumb, sucking it into her mouth and biting it softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god” Agatha exhales, and Rio drags down Agatha’s panties. Green lace. Absolutely soaked. Rio wonders if Agatha will let her keep them after they’re done. Rio can smell Agatha’s arousal and groans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes Rio’s head into her cunt, and they both sigh with relief as Rio’s tongue finds her wet curls and parts her dripping folds. Rio hikes Agatha’s leg over her shoulder and finds Agatha’s clit with her lips, sucking hard. Rio wants to spend hours with her mouth between Agatha’s legs. After a few moments of open mouth kisses to Agatha’s cunt, the spell is broken.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Professor Vidal,” Agatha whines. “Please” Rio looks up and can see tears in Agatha’s eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What do you want, sweet girl?” Rio asks, willing to do anything for Agatha. If Agatha wanted Rio to sign away the deed to her house she would.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha breathes out and stutters, “Your” She’s interrupted by a moan that she can’t seem to swallow down, “your fingers”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And Rio would chop off her fingers and give them to Agatha on a silver platter if that's what she wanted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio purrs, “I’ll start with two” and Agatha hums. Agatha makes the most delicious sounds as Rio fucks her. Somewhere between a whine and a cry. Rio thinks that Agatha has the most beautiful voice in the world, and idly wonders if Agatha sings. When Rio curls her fingers into Agatha just so Agatha lets out a sound that’s clarion and bright. The way the Trumpet solo in the Mahler should have been. Rio sucks and bites at the delicate skin on Agatha’s thighs as she adds a third finger and fucks Agatha through her orgasm. Rio doesn’t want to hurt her, but she wants Agatha to feel stretched tomorrow. Wants her to remember Rio’s fingers with each step she takes, to see bruises that remind her of Rio’s teeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio feels her pussy throb as Agatha cums and she chokes out a low moan. Agatha catches her breath, her cheeks flushed a rosy red, and asks “What do you want, Professor Vidal?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs gently and settles into Agatha’s lap, straddling her thigh. Her pants are still on, and Rio realizes, as she grinds into Agatha, that she is about to come in her slacks. <em>Jesus</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Kiss me” Rio begs and Agatha obeys, cradling Rio’s face in her hands and pressing their lips together. The kiss turns filthy almost instantly, Agatha licking into Rio’s mouth. Rio, still fully clothed, comes like a little dog humping Agatha’s leg.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio pockets Agatha’s underwear without asking and helps her back into her pants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My lady” she says, offering Agatha a hand to help her up from the loveseat. Once they’re both standing Rio realizes that her back is fucked from their dalliance. She groans as she stretches out and Agatha laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Okay Grandpa, let’s get you back to home” Agatha grins and Rio glares at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m not that old, Rio pouts moodily, and Agatha nods seriously.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Agatha speaks softly with a smile. “I 'm twenty-five, but I have the life experience of someone in their mid-forties, I swear,” and Rio snorts back a laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I turned forty last month” Rio admits shyly. It feels nice to show all her cards.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, “God that's hot” and looks at Rio like she wants to blow out her back, again. Before this can happen, Rio gathers her things and starts to lock up her office.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I like all the plants, professor,” Agatha says approvingly as they’re leaving. Rio suddenly feels shy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’d like it if you call me Rio when we’re alone” she quietly admits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“So, you want to be alone with me again, huh?” Agatha says coyly and raises an eyebrow. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“As often as you’ll let me”, Rio replies simply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It feels like a promise.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Rio” Agatha replies, stretching out the syllables in Rio’s name. Testing how it feels in her mouth. She smiles wide and reaches out to take Rio’s hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>They walk silently together to the parking lot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After meeting Agatha, Rio realizes she must take action. Step one of her plan is to find out if Westview University allows faculty to be in relationships with graduate students. This is why Rio finds herself reading through Lilia’s faculty handbook and sitting in Lilia’s big leather swivel chair with her feet up on Lilia’s desk. Rio knows that it’s impolite to break into someone's office, so she bought Lilia a coffee and croissant for her troubles. Rio’s not an animal. Rio hears Lilia enter, looks up from her reading, and gestures loosely to the coffee and pastry instead of greeting Lilia. Rio is annoyed but unsurprised when Lilia has questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio! How’d you get in here?” Lilia asks, looking slightly concerned and trying to see what Rio has done to her office. A filing cabinet is open, and there are a couple of stacks of paper on the floor, but all in all, Rio was mostly respectful of the space.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You know I love to pick a lock now and again” Rio mutters as she continues reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia cranes her head to see what Rio’s so engrossed in. “Why are you looking at my copy of the faculty handbook?” Lilia asks, a touch of concern in her voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Burned mine.” Rio mumbles and continues to read.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia shakes her head lovingly. This is par for the course with Rio. Lilia lets Rio keep reading for a few minutes uninterrupted but eventually breaks the silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Okay honey, well, I have some emails to catch up on if you don’t mind” Lilia clears her throat and gestures to the chair and desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio jumps up out of the seat. “Of course, of course!” Rio says, closing the notebook and shoving it back into Lilia’s filing cabinet. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Got what I needed anyways,” Rio tells Lilia and speeds out of the office.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The words from the handbook Rio was hoping to find are already ingrained in her. She can practically see the writing on the back of her eyelids as she closes her eyes. <em>‘A romantic or sexual relationship between a consenting faculty member and a consenting graduate student may be allowable with an appropriate relationship disclosure, approval, and conflict management plan in place.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p> </p><p>Step one accomplished. Now Rio knows she can pursue a romantic relationship with Agatha and won’t need to resign. Rio wouldn't mind getting fired, but she would hate for Agatha’s name to be tarnished on her behalf. This is why Rio stayed up late last night, drafting her letter of resignation to the university, just in case that’s what it came to. Rio would have been fine if she needed to leave. She has some big commissions coming up and is getting decent pay from her music royalties. The job at Westview is mostly a way for Rio to have structure in her days and not revert into a full gremlin. Also, Rio loves making mayhem for the department and would miss her colleagues if she left. So, Rio is ultimately relieved that she won’t have to leave. But it would have been worth it for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p><em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If Agatha wants, that is</em>. Rio worries. She suddenly feels slightly faint, considering that her feelings may not be reciprocated. Rio needs to find out what Agatha wants. If it’s just a casual hookup, then Rio might need to hand in the letter of resignation after all. She can’t bear the thought of seeing Agatha every day and not being allowed to love her. To watch her in rehearsals and pretend that Agatha wasn’t her reason for getting out of bed in the morning. Rio shivers. She is either all in or she is out, and it’s entirely in Agatha’s beautiful, tender hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The next step in Rio’s plan is to get Agatha’s phone number. Rio has three ideas on how she can accomplish this: 1. bully and intimidate Billy Kaplan into giving it to her, 2. get it from Maximoff under the guise of wanting to talk to Agatha about rehearsal, or 3. find it in a student directory. Rio obviously doesn’t want to interact with Maximoff and doesn’t even know where she would find a student directory. She sets off to find the Kaplan boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio remembers that Billy usually spends his morning in the faculty lounge sucking up to her colleagues and making coffee. Lilia’s lenience with Billy using the espresso machine is one of the woman’s only flaws, Rio thinks. Rio walks into the faculty lounge to find Alice, Jen, and Billy already deep in conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“And then, Professor Vidal took my violin and used it for the entire rehearsal,” Billy complains loudly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jen and Alice humm sympathetically, and Rio is still unnoticed in the doorway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It was the worst instrument I’ve ever played on” Rio scoffs and Jen and Alice laugh at Billy’s startled expression as he realizes Rio overheard him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Billy tries to play it cool, “Oh, hey, Professor Vidal. I was just telling Jen and Alice how great it was to watch you play yesterday.” Alice snorts into her mug of coffee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, “You can play on my Strad next rehearsal if you want.” Rio offers. “As a thank you”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Billy’s mouth hangs open. “Better close your jaw, Teen” Jen teases, “Flies might get in”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“The Strad that the Guggenheim Foundation bought you after you won the Paganini competition when you were sixteen?” Billy gapes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio glowers. “I don't like talking about my performance career. My career as a composer is much more personally<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rewarding than my time as a violinist ever was.” She glares at Billy, who starts stuttering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh-okay”. Billy says and lifts his coffee to his lips. Rio sees his hands shaking slightly, <em>good, </em>she thinks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Anyway, Teen” Rio starts. “I need Agatha’s phone number. Do you have it?” Rio asks casually. Jen and Alice are looking at her strangely, but Rio ignores it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Um yeah, let me text it to you” Billy reaches out for his phone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Ew, I don't want your number in my phone. Just read it out loud” Rio scoffs, and Billy looks like a kicked puppy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Alice lets out a low whistle, “Harsh, Vidal.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes and puts Agatha’s number in her phone as Billy rattles off the digits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once he finishes, Billy mumbles something about meeting Eddie and leaves the faculty lounge. Rio takes a seat in her favorite chair. Now it’s time to think about how to accomplish the final step in her plan: getting Agatha to love her.</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio can truly start plotting, Jen interrupts, “I almost don't want to know what happened” Jen says tentatively and takes a seat across from Rio as she asks, “How’d it go last night? It was so bad that you need to call her to talk about rehearsal management strategies?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio raises her eyebrows at Jen and pauses a moment before she responds “I didn’t think anything she did was out of line”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen’s puzzled expression makes her look slightly constipated. She looks at Rio with disbelief, “Really?” She draws out. “Then why do you need her number?” Jen asks slowly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blanches. “Oh, you know…for, uh, to get information on…bowings?” Rio mumbles hoping against hope that Jen will be dumb enough to buy it, but based on the look Alice is giving her Rio knows she’s fucked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen’s face drops and Alice walks over so she’s standing behind Jen. Alice puts her hands on Jen’s shoulders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio thinks that they’re the perfect image of the disappointed parents Rio’s never had. Rio knows that when her parents were still alive they were always extremely proud of her, it was part of the whole prodigy thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio, babe” Alice starts delicately at the same time as Jen harshly says “Vidal we know you don’t give a shit about bowings”. Rio wonders if they’d run after her if she tried to make a break for it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen gestures for Alice to speak. Alice continues in a hushed voice, “Rio. Don’t get mad, but I just want to make sure of something, okay?” Alice is rubbing small circles on Jen’s back.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“You didn’t just get Agatha’s number from one of her peers so you can try and connect with her” Alice pauses trying to find the right words, “Like…socially, right?” Alice finishes and waits for Rio to defend herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio may be sneaky and perhaps doesn't always tell the full truth, but Abuelita back in San Juan always tells her never to be ashamed of love. Rio decides this is her moment to embrace radical honesty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio gulps and looks at both of her colleagues in the eyes, she nods resolutely, “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen gives a nervous laugh. “Yes, no, or yes, yes. Vidal?” Jen asks, and her voice is rising in pitch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio is confused. “Yes?” She asks. “Yes, yes?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice nods slowly and blinks at Rio. “Yes, as in you’re agreeing with me, and you got Agatha’s phone number for a professional reason, right?” Alice asks hopefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio is starting to feel fed up by all of this. Are they really so shocked that she wants to pursue a relationship with Agatha? Rio wonders. The handbook said it was <em>fine</em>, and Rio is nearly certain Agatha is her soulmate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, “Yes, as in, yes, I want to call Agatha…socially,” Rio states evenly, borrowing Alice’s word for it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god you fucked her already” Jen groans and Alice laughs but it seems to be out of discomfort more than humor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia chooses this exact moment to walk into the faculty lounge. She’s carrying a large tray that Rio recognizes as her famous lasagna. Rio’s surprised she didn’t notice it when she saw Lilia in her office. It’s not unusual for Lilia to bring in food for everyone, but Rio wonders what the occasion is.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Lilia!” Rio shouts, extremely grateful for the diversion. She runs up to Lilia and grabs the tray from her. Lilia kisses her on both cheeks in greeting. Lillia starts to gather plates and utensils and Rio hears that she’s humming <em>“That’s Amore” </em>under her breath<em>. Fitting,</em> Rio thinks and smiles to herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen barrels on without even acknowledging Lilia’s lasagna. “Lilia,” Jen huffs, “Rio is pursuing a romantic relationship with a student. “Please, please try and talk some sense into her.” Jen begs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia gives Jen a pitying look. “It’s perfectly acceptable so long as Rio’s not in a position where she needs to give Agatha any grade, or has leverage over her.” Lilia stares Jen down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio Almost drops the tray of lasagna, she is too stunned to speak. How did Lilia know it was Agatha?</p><p> </p><p>Alice, ever the peacemaker, chimes in, “I mean the handbook does say it’s okay. I remember from when we checked to make sure interfaculty relationships were kosher” Alice gently tells Jen.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is still staring at Lilia. “ Why did you say Agatha?” Rio asks, shocked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh, honey,” Lilia grins, “The moment I met her I knew there was only one way this could end.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Lilia sighs and pauses. “Also, I overheard you admitting that you want to call her, socially” Lilia admits and winks. Rio is so embarrassed she could melt. She shoves the tray of Lasagna back into Lilia’s arms and rushes out of the room. She has to go teach ear training to the sophomores, anyway. Surprising them with an unreasonably difficult dictation quiz will soothe her nerves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio is stopping by her office to have some plant time before teaching and sees the note. It’s just a regular Post-it, but the loopy scrawl of the penmanship is almost a work of art, Rio thinks. She reads the cursive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
<em>Prof. Vidal, the new music ensemble, is having a reading session next week. Do you have any compositions you’re working on that you’d let us play with? I’ll be in my office from 12-3. It’s on the third floor by the vending machines. My name is on the door. Find me, and we can discuss. -A</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio beams. She was not expecting this. Agatha reached out first. Her stomach does a summersault, and she feels a dopey smile light up her face. Not only did Agatha reach out, but she wants to work with Rio’s music. Rio knows her music isn’t to most people’s taste. In her last published review words like bizarre, and terrifying were used to describe her composition style. And here Agatha is, seeking it out. Seeking Rio out. Rio feels her body vibrate and has to fight the urge to do a small dance. She pulls out her phone and types a text to Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
<em>Good afternoon, Agatha. This is Rio. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio sends the text and exhales, nervously. She sees three little dots indicating that Agatha is typing. They disappear, but no text comes through. Rio wants to smash her phone into the floor. She shoves her phone into her pocket, and it immediately vibrates with an incoming message. Rio takes out her phone, but instead of a text in response, Agatha just reacts to Rio’s last message with the infuriating little question mark thing. <em>What does that mean</em>, Rio wonders, groaning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio thinks for a moment and then sends another,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>more direct text to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>I got your number from Billy Kaplan. Hope that’s okay. I saw your note. I’ll stop by your office with some music during my lunch break in an hour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s phone dings again with a new message.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
<em>Sorry you had to talk to Billy. See you soon.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, remembering how Agatha bullied Billy in rehearsal. Then, Rio has an idea. Her abuela has always said the way the heart is through the stomach. Rio figures no one will notice if she takes an extra piece of Lilia’s lasagna and brings it to Agatha. She shoots Agatha one more text.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
<em>Hope you’re hungry ;)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio powers down her phone and heads to class. She’s in such a good mood that she doesn’t even end up giving the sophomores the surprise test. Instead, she spends the class listening to her students poorly sight sing, and only makes one of them cry.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio is just finishing walking to the third floor with a plate of lasagna in one hand and a few of her newer compositions in the other when she hears the aching and sensual opening lines of Chopin’s Nocturne op. 9 no. 1. She’s surprised; she didn’t know the third floor has practice rooms. She also didn't realize Westview had any decent pianists. This is some very nuanced and skilled playing. The music grows stronger as Rio walks down the hall towards the vending machine, searching for Agatha’s office. She stops in front of the door the music is coming from, noticing the handmade sign that reads ‘Harkness’.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes her tongue against her cheek, pausing. She doesn’t want to interrupt Agatha’s playing, but she’s dying to see the way Agatha’s hands move on the keys, to watch her chest expand and open as she breathes into the phrases. Rio aches to see Agatha’s sculpted arms reach across the instrument. To see her legs slightly open and pressing down on the piano pedals. She suddenly feels ten degrees warmer and notices a thrumming between her legs. Rio imagines Agatha completely naked, playing the piano, and the image is so strong and magnetic that she finds herself opening the door, hoping that’s what she finds on the other side. Agatha, unfortunately, is completely clothed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues to play, not acknowledging Rio’s presence. Rio softly shuts the door, sinks to the floor, and watches Agatha. Rio feels spellbound. Agatha at the piano is even more gorgeous than Rio imagined. Agatha’s playing grows softer as the piece is ending, and Rio doesn’t dare say a word. She holds her breath, hoping Agatha will start the second piece on the opus. Instead, Agatha abruptly gets up from the piano bench, turns, and scowls at Rio. Rio wonders if it's healthy that she finds Agatha’s anger so hot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha glares down at Rio for a moment and breaks the silence. “You are ruining my day,” she tells Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heart sinks into her stomach, and her breath is suddenly gone. She feels ill. “How can I-” Rio starts, and Agatha interrupts. Rio starts to try and stand up, but Agatha points at the ground, indicating for Rio to stay put.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No. I’m talking.” Agatha tells Rio sternly, and Rio feels her insides go to mush. <em>How in the fuck<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is this twenty-five-year-old woman making her feel so powerless?</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha starts pacing the room, barely looking at Rio, and tersely starts to speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I can’t stop thinking about you. I’m not able to focus on anything. I couldn’t practice my conducting patterns for the Mahler without thinking of the way your fingers look when you play. I didn't catch a word of Professor Wu-Gulliver’s lecture in her seminar, and it was on my fucking thesis topic. I couldn’t think of anything meaningful to say to the undergraduates in the conducting 101 class I teach. I barely said anything to them. They just waved their hands around like fucking idiots and I barely watched. All because I was thinking of <em>you</em>” Agatha growls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles so big it hurts her cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No!” Agatha shouts. “Don't look at me like that.” She groans, and Rio can’t help but laugh at the girl's exasperation. Rio notices that Agatha is flushed. Her pupils are slightly dilated, and whispy baby hairs are sticking to her forehead. Agatha’s hair is down, untamable. Rio wants to wrap her fingers in it. She wants to put it in her mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, finally looking down to where Rio sits on the floor. “I’m too busy for this. This can’t cut into my work day. Outside of my workday, fine, but not while I’m supposed to be productive,” Agatha whines and Rio smirks up at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio chuckles, “it’s okay to be a little distracted’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles up at Agatha and reaches out to touch the smooth skin of her calf. Agatha’s blue linen skirt ends just below the knees, her blue and white striped cotton tee and gray cardigan make her look professional but far less intimidating than the purple slacks and blue coat she wore to rehearsal last night. This makes Rio feel brave. She snakes her hand up under Agatha’s skirt and quickly pulls down her underwear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio, Jesus.” Agatha huffs as her panties pool around her ankles. Rio looks up into Agatha’s eyes, asking for permission, and Agatha sighs.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“If you must,” Agatha mutters, but sinks to the floor until she’s laying on her back with her legs bent at the knees. She hikes up her skirt and spreads her legs. Giving Rio full access.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I don't have all afternoon,” Agatha grumbles, and her put-upon attitude is so campy that Rio can’t help but play along.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be fast, darling, I promise,” Rio tells her as she climbs on top of Agatha and gently kisses where Agatha’s neck meets her shoulder. Agatha tastes like lavender and brown sugar and sunshine. Rio wants to remember this moment for the rest of her life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio cups Agatha’s sex and finds her dripping. She smiles wide against Agatha’s shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a puff of air, clearly impatient. “Stop teasing or I’ll do it myself.” She threatens.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio giggles, which seems to make Agatha even more frustrated. Before Agatha can respond Rio finds Agatha’s clit with her thumb and presses down hard. Agatha gasps and Rio slides in two fingers and starts to pump quickly in and out of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hisses and Rio stills her fingers. “Sorry,” Agatha breathes out. “I think I’m a bit sore from yesterday, just go slow?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha asks softly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, and mumbles, “Don’t apologize,” into Agatha’s skin. She fucks her more gently than she ever thought possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha makes delicious little mewling sounds. Then, Rio feels Agatha’s walls tighten around her fingers and watches in awe as Agatha’s face scrunches up, and her toes curl. Agatha begins to cry out, and Rio puts her hand over Agatha’s mouth and gently shushes her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My good girl” Rio coos as Agatha comes around her fingers. She removes them slowly, but Agatha winces anyway. “I’m sorry,” Rio says softly, staring into Agatha’s eyes. “I never want to hurt you” she promises.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her quizzically. “What good is pleasure if you never feel pain?” Agatha takes a moment to catch her breath, and Rio wonders if she was in a terrible accident and this is all just some crazy coma dream. It all seems too good to be true. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head, still in a state of disbelief. “You’re kind of weird, you know that, right?” Rio asks giving Agatha a quick peck on the lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a chuckle “I’m well aware” She grins up at Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio crawls off of Agatha and gets up to fetch the water bottle from Agatha’s desk. Agatha looks at Rio pointedly “And I don’t get a turn?” She asks haughtily and Rio snorts out a laugh. This girl will be the death of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I thought you had work to get done”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio teases and Agatha rolls her eyes. Agatha sits up and Rio goes back next to her, handing her the water. She watches Agatha drink greedily and feels, nonsensically, jealous of the bottle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha finishes her water and looks at Rio curiously. “I thought when you asked if I was hungry it meant that I was going to get to go down on you,” Agatha accuses, and Rio laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No, I meant that literally. I brought you lunch” Rio grins and gestures to the plate of lasagna.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Wait” Agatha looks at Rio disbelievingly. “You’re joking, That’s <em>your </em>lunch.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, this is for both of us,” Rio says, slightly offended, “This is an absurd amount of lasagna. You thought I would eat an entire nine-inch square worth of lasagna for lunch by myself?” Rio asks, appalled.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sniffs, “If it wasn’t an innuendo why did you send me the winky face? You wrote, Hope you’re hungry ‘winky face’”. Agatha makes air quotes with her fingers. “You’re going to sit here and tell me you weren’t planning on letting me eat you out?” She asks, incredulously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Also, when you came in I wasn’t exactly focused on the size of the lasagna,” Agatha says moodily and Rio can't help but laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry you had a tough day,” Rio tells Agatha honestly. “But I swear, this is some really good lasagna, and it will help turn things around,” Rio promises. Agatha gets up, pulls two plastic forks from a desk drawer, and sits back down next to Rio. She hands Rio a fork, takes a bite of the lasagna, and moans softly. Rio feels feral.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god” Agatha gushes. “Did you make this? This is the best lasagna I have ever eaten.” Rio shakes her head no and tries not to be offended that Agatha looks disappointed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Lilia made it.” Rio offers, and Agatha hums in understanding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Her cooking is what I miss most about accompanying her student’s singing. She always brought me lunch.” Agatha says as she takes another bite of the lasagna.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles happily at this. “She must really like you, she doesn't cook for just anybody, you know,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>she tells Agatha conspiratorially.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs softly, “Lilia always said I reminded her of someone important. She’d never say who it was” Agatha shrugs, “I think she likes the drama of a mystery”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio nods in agreement. “Absolutely.” Rio pauses, curious, “Why don't you play for her lessons anymore?” she asks. “I know she pays well.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “Lilia has a rule where you can’t make the students cry every lesson. I wasn’t trying to be cruel. I’m just honest” Agatha says and shrugs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio cackles, and eats some lasagna. They sit in an easy silence for a couple of minutes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My day is a lot better now, but not just because of the lasagna,” Agatha admits softly, blushing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio grins wolfishly and wiggles her fingers in front of Agatha’s face. “I have been told these are my greatest asset,” Rio tells her, and Agatha snorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I wasn’t just talking about the sex. That was great, but I enjoy your company.” Agatha pauses and takes a breath, “I don’t like spending time with most people but you are astonishingly…tolerable”. Agatha declares, avoiding Rio’s eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio preens. “I also don't like most people,” Rio says carefully and quickly shoves a bite of lasagna in her mouth to stop herself from continuing and telling Agatha the full extent of her feelings. Rio gets the sense that if she told Agatha the truth, told her that she knows deep inside of her heart that Agatha is the only woman she will ever love, then Agatha would run straight out of town. So Rio pushes it all down and takes another fucking bite of lasagna.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious about not having you distract me during working hours” Agatha warns and looks at Rio darkly. “I’m a very busy woman.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns slightly and nods, she’s disappointed that afternoon lunch dates ending with her fingers inside Agatha won’t be a regular occurrence. “I can respect that.” She concedes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives a small snort of laughter, “I don’t know if that would hold up in court” She tells Rio, raising her eyebrows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Seriously, though”, Agatha says, “I couldn’t get anything done because of you.” Rio flushes with happiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues, “I accompany Dr. Kale’s choirs, which is hell, but I have rent to pay, and I was so distracted and played so poorly that Dr. Kale had me leave early and the choir rehearsed acapella,” Agatha says crossly. Rio wants to laugh but thinks better of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It was humiliating. I was convinced I suffered some sort of brain injury that made me forget how to play the piano. That’s why I was playing Chopin earlier. To see if I could still play. Which I can, by the way, so my shitty playing in choir rehearsal was <em>your </em>fault .” Agatha says angrily and gives Rio a look that would kill a weaker woman.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at Agatha adoringly, “You’re a brilliant pianist. Your playing is so sensitive” She says and reaches out to take Agatha’s hand. “You have magic fingers,” Rio tells her, as she laces her fingers together with Agatha’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You don’t seem to want me to use them” Agatha grumbles under her breath, and Rio laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m not a stone, I promise,” she says. “I’m just a quality-over-quantity type of person,” Rio tells Agatha with a smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins wickedly, “That sounds like something an old person would say to make themselves feel better about not being able to keep up with the hot younger girl they’re banging” Agatha challenges, and Rio just groans in response.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio tries to change the subject, “Did you ever consider trying to be a concert pianist, the world deserves to hear you play.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at Rio as if she has three heads. “The best solo violinist of the century, who famously refused to publicly play the violin after she turned twenty is asking why I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>don't want to be a soloist?” Agatha scoffs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio grins, “Best solo violinist of the century, huh?” She asks Agatha, elbowing her ribs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha glares and pushes Rio away. Rio laughs but then pauses. <em>Is Agatha ready to have a real conversation?</em> She wonders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Delicately, Rio starts, “I’ll tell you my reasons if you tell me yours, but fair warning, it’s dark.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods her head, and Rio feels a release of tension she didn’t even realize she was holding.</p><p> </p><p>Rio goes straight to the point. “When I was twenty my parents died” She breathes out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m so sorry,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha whispers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio continues, the faster she gets through the story the easier it is to tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“There was a car crash in San Juan and they both died on impact.” She shrugs. “After they died, I <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>couldn’t bring myself to play. I was always playing for them, anyway, never for me.” Rio says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods her head and gives a hum of understanding. “You compose for you, though,” Agatha says thoughtfully. “That’s your outlet,” She finishes.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio has never felt so seen. She looks at Agatha, and suddenly, her feelings are too big for her body. Too big for the room. She starts to cry and wipes her eyes furiously, looking away from Agatha. Agatha takes her hand and softly places it on Rio’s cheek. She turns Rio’s head gently until their eyes meet. Rio finds herself drowning in the soft blue of Agatha’s eyes, and it’s too much. She closes her eyes tightly and feels Agatha’s lips press into her cheek. Agatha is kissing away her tears. Rio feels Agatha’s hand gently stroke her hair, and Agatha places small butterfly kisses down, following the path of Rio’s tears, until she finally reaches Rio’s mouth. Rio opens her mouth, begging Agatha to deepen the kiss. Agatha responds eagerly, and Rio melts into her. Agatha’s lips are gentle, sucking and nipping at Rio’s bottom lip. Rio realizes the acceleration of her heart is shifting from panic and pain into something else entirely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio also realizes that Agatha has snuck a hand under the back of her sweater and undone her bra. Rio laughs lightly. “Really, Agatha?” She questions, smiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha matches her grin, “Baby, it’s my best move” She winks at Rio and they laugh together for a moment. Then, Rio takes off her sweater. Agatha reverently palms her breast.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” she murmurs and ducks down to capture Rio’s tit in her mouth. Rio lets out a sigh, needy and high, as Agatha swirls her tongue around Rio’s nipple. Agatha bites down, and Rio cries out. Agatha replaces her teeth with two nimble fingers, tugging gently at Rio’s pebbled breast, and begins to kiss her way down Rio’s stomach until she reaches the Apex of Rio’s thighs. Rio lets out a low shuddery breath as Agatha uses her tongue and teeth to undo the button of Rio’s dark wash jeans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at Rio, grinning like the cat who got the cream. “Want to see what else I can do with just my mouth?” Agatha asks, and Rio finds herself letting out a barely intelligible sound of agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifts and turns and Rio’s not quite sure how it’s happened, but now Agatha’s face is underneath her, and Agatha’s gently guiding Rio onto it. Rio rides Agatha's face hard and fast until she comes abruptly. It’s so strong that her vision goes dark for a moment. Something uncoils inside of her, and suddenly, hot liquid gushes out of Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She feels Agatha opening her mouth wider, trying to swallow it, trying to swallow her whole, Rio thinks. Finally, Agatha darts out from under Rio, wiping liquid off her chin with the back of her sleeve.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“I think I died for a minute back there” Rio confesses and turns to look at Agatha, who barely seems to have heard her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha is smiling hugely and has a faraway look in her eyes. Rio feels so in love that her entire body lights up like a Christmas tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Thank you, thank you,” Agatha chants, and Rio breathlessly lowers herself down next to Agatha and opens her arms wide for Agatha to crawl into. Rio wraps herself tightly around Agatha and matches the rhythm of her breath to Agatha’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha breaks the silence, “I conduct because I like the power,” she tells Rio honestly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs and nods, her chin moving against the top of Agatha’s head. “I could have told you that. I’ve been in your rehearsal room” Rio teases.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs softly, “I don’t play solo piano in public because my mother beat out any love for it I ever had.” Agatha says quietly in a detached voice. She pauses before adding “Physically, I mean.” Rio just holds onto Agatha tighter, never wanting to let go.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m not sure if anyone’s mentioned it”, Agatha continues, “but my mom is Evanora Harkness, the concert pianist,” Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio turns to face Agatha and brushes a strand of her hair away from her eyes. Rio lets out a low breath, choosing her words carefully. “I did a concert with her towards the end of my career. We did some Beethoven sonatas at Carnegie. It was my my last public performance” Rio tells Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“I remember.” Agatha shifts so her head is resting on Rio’s breast. “I was five, and I was in the audience.” Agatha plays with a strand of Rio’s hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“To this day, I would say she is the most awful person I’ve ever had the displeasure of meeting,” Rio says, her heart breaking for Agatha. She can’t imagine growing up in the shadow of that temperamental and unstable witch of a woman.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“I didn’t know she had a kid,” Rio says sadly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“She shouldn't have” Agatha replies darkly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at Agatha sternly. “Your mom is a cunt, but I, for one, am extremely grateful you exist.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs and says, “Rio Vidal, I think I might be falling in love with you,” and she keeps laughing gently under her breath. The laugh shimmers silver and peals like bells.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio has never</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>in all of her life heard a more perfect or beautiful sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha interrupts Rio’s reverie. “Now you said you had some music, I can look at?” She asks, and Rio can’t help but admire the look of hunger on Agatha’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You have fire in your eyes when you think about music”, Rio tells her as she reaches to get the scores.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her hand dismissively. “Enough about my gorgeous face, give me the goods’ she tells Rio and she tries to grab at the music, which Rio is holding just out of reach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio hands them to her with a flourish. Agatha starts to read the music, pouring over it, and in her own world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio watches but realizes she has to go teach a composition lesson. Rio gets dressed silently and places a kiss on the top of Agatha’s head as she gets ready to leave.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“These are astonishing.” Agatha looks up catching Rio’s eyes. Love blooms strong in Rio’s chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>‘Te Quiero’ <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>she blurts as she’s about to leave the room. Fuck. Fuck. Rio turns back to catch Agatha’s reaction, certain the girl will be horrified that Rio’s said it out loud so soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha, head back in the score, asks nonplussed, “Sorry I missed that. What did you say?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And Rio is grateful to the universe for saving her in this moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I said, te veo” Rio lies swiftly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums. “That means you see me?” She asks and Rio nods, trying to look chill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues smirking at Rio, “So that’s what this is. We’re seeing each other?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles wide. “I certainly don’t want to see anyone else,” Rio tells Agatha whose eyes shine brighter at that admission.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“But, ‘te veo’ means ‘I’ll see you later’, and sometimes it means ‘I get you’ does that make sense? “Rio asks, fidgeting with her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets up and goes to Rio, whispering in her ear. “I get you, too, ” She tells Rio and presses a quick chaste kiss to Rio’s lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Now get the fuck out of my office so I can get some work done” She commands, and Rio taps the door with her knuckles on the way out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s a sleepy, snowy Saturday morning about halfway through the winter quarter when Rio Vidal realizes that this is the happiest she has ever been in her adult life. She’s been seeing Agatha for about a month and is certain, even though Agatha hasn’t said so out loud, that Agatha loves her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha is currently naked and curled up in Rio’s sage green sheets. Rio has been watching her sleep for the past twenty minutes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em> It’s only creepy if Agatha knows about it,</em> Rio assures herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio knows that Agatha would stay in bed well past noon if she let her, but the last time that happened, Agatha was pissed that Rio let her sleep so long.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to Agatha, <em>‘thinking that someone is adorable when they sleep does not mean that you can shut off their alarm and let them keep sleeping.</em>’ Rio thinks Agatha is in the wrong but still plans to wait a few weeks before she tries that stunt again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio curls her body up against Agatha’s, hoping to wake Agatha by cuddling. Rio has learned over the past month that Agatha is not a morning person, but she is most definitely a snuggler.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio shifts her thigh so it’s in between Agatha’s legs and wraps her arm around her waist. She nuzzles into Agatha’s hair and breathes in deep, smelling lavender mixed with something spicy and warm and distinctly Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha purrs out a content “G’ morning”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and sinks the back of her body into the front of Rio’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio loves the feeling of her breasts resting against Agatha’s shoulder blades. Agatha bears down onto the thigh Rio has wedged between her legs and begins to grind on it, her pace slow and lazy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Hi, sweetheart’ Rio sighs happily as she pushes her thigh up into Agatha. She can feel Agatha’s stickiness against her skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio gives Agatha’s neck slow, languid kisses. When Agatha’s slick is dripping down Rio’s thigh, and Agatha’s breathing gets heavier, Rio bites down hard on Agatha’s neck and sucks a hickey into her skin. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha whines, her voice still thick with sleep, “I’m gonna cum, my love. Can I cum?”</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio’s heart catches in her throat at the pet name. “Face me, and then cum, Aggie” Rio orders, and Agatha turns around, repositions herself on Rio’s thigh, catches Rio’s eyes, and comes undone. Rio uses her fingers to wipe Agatha’s juices off her thigh and puts them into her mouth, tasting.</p><p> </p><p>“Delicious,” she grins at Agatha, and shifts to hold her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs sleepily, “You’re nasty.” She tells Rio with a smile. The smile is quickly replaced with a scowl.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“If you ever call me Aggie again, I will replace your liquid plant food with bleach” Agatha snarls, and breaks free of Rio’s embrace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio cackles. “That’s diabolical. You’re not that mean”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious” Agatha warns, and Rio considers that Agatha may be that mean. Rio is into it but is still worried on behalf of her plants.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll never do it again, darling,” Rio swears. Rio pauses for a second, slightly nervous,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You called me something new too.”</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Instead of responding right away, Agatha leaves the bed and goes to put on a pair of Rio’s gym shorts and her ratty old Westview sweatshirt. She turns to Rio, cheeks flushed red and slightly frowning, “I was barely awake, I might’ve said anything, and whatever it was I’m sure I didn’t mean it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio nods her head, looking at Agatha sadly. Love is patient and kind, so Rio must be as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Agatha,” Rio says, and she watches as Agatha calms down visibly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“We should buy you some proper pajamas, Rio,” Agatha tells her, stasrting to walk out of the bedroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“If I’m going to spend time around here, I want some nicer lounge clothes to steal from you. I mean, it doesn't seem like money is an issue.” Agatha says, gesturing loosely at Rio’s belongings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio is fairly conservative about using the money she made as a violinist, but her house is the exception. She lives in a contemporary cabin on the outskirts of town and has a large yard with a greenhouse, and raised beds that Rio tends to. The house is a new build. Rio had it custom-designed when she took the position at Westview. It’s a three-bedroom made up of beautiful cedar, steel, and glass. The walls are mostly windows. Rio’s furnished it with cozy but minimalist pieces, taking inspiration from Scandinavian and Japanese designs. Her furniture is all admittedly high-end, and some of her rarer plants were expensive, but she doesn't feel like she shows her wealth too obviously.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blushes. “We can go shopping if you’d like. Maybe pick you up a couple of sets of clothes and basics that would stay here.” She offers, following Agatha into the kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins mischievously and pops down on a bar stool. Rio starts making two pour-over coffees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Well you know,” Agatha starts sweetly, “I never had a recording contract with <em>Deutsche Grammophon</em>, so my shopping budget is pretty limited.” She sighs dramatically and bats her eyelashes at Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio cracks up at this, “I can take you shopping, Agatha. My treat,” Rio amends and Agatha jumps off the bar stool and runs behind Rio, wrapping her arms around her waist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And when Agatha sneaks behind Rio, wrapping her arms around her waist, and whispers ‘Thank you, Daddy.” Rio’s knees nearly go out. Agatha takes her coffee from Rio, smirking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s just finishing up making a veggie and egg scramble for herself and Agatha when her phone starts ringing incessantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I can take over if you want to get that,” Agatha offers. Last week, Agatha told Rio a story about burning pasta, so Rio is inclined not to let Agatha anywhere near the stove.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“That's alright, sweetheart.” Rio says, “Just grab the phone and tell whoever it is that I’ll be right there”. Rio instructs and Agatha gives her a two-finger salute.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Yes, chef”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio Vidal’s phone” Agatha answers in a serious voice. The person on the other line says something and Agatha scrunches up her face in distaste.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Ew. What do you want from Rio?” Agatha asks petulantly. Rio takes this as her cue to butt in. She plates breakfast and turns to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, who is it?” Rio asks, surprised that Agatha still hasn’t handed her the phone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowns, “Dr. Kale”, she says and whispers in a voice that Jen can definitely hear over the line, “She won’t tell me what she wants. I’m sorry you have to deal with her now. What a downer on a perfect morning.” Agatha shakes her head sadly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio raises her eyebrows at Agatha’s theatrics and takes the phone. “You eat. I’ll handle this” She tells Agatha and puts a plate down for her at the breakfast nook.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey Jen, what's up?” Rio asks taking the phone and sitting next to Agatha, who is eating breakfast as though it was her first real meal in weeks. Rio makes a mental note to make sure Agatha feeds herself when she’s not around.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Does Agatha not know that she could’ve pressed the mute button?” Jen asks, and Rio laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I think she wanted you to hear that,” Rio tells Jen and grins at Agatha. Agatha smacks Rio in the arm. Rio mouths, “Ouch!”</p><p> </p><p>“You two are the same kind of annoying,” Jen tells Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m not dignifying that with a response, Jen. Why’re you calling?” Rio asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Can’t a girl just call her favorite friend to catch up?” Jen asks sweetly, and Rio lets out a laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“We both know I’m not your favorite friend.” Rio rolls her eyes, and Agatha snorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen sighs into the phone, “Alice has a cold, so she can’t help me with my stand at the farmers market today. Can you come help at 11?” Jen pauses, and Rio waits a moment to respond. Knowing Jen will sweeten the deal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen continues, “I’ll buy you lunch, grade one of your classes’ next exam, and even let you try to convince me that I shouldn’t hate Agatha.” Jen weedles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio is sold, but she can’t let Jen know she’s excited. She mutters, “Fine,” into the phone and hangs up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Well?” Agatha asks, and Rio finds her impatience very cute. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Jen needs me to help her at the farmers market today. She sells a line of beeswax-based skincare, and makeup up” Rio starts, and Agatha groans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, you’re part of her pyramid scheme?” Agatha accuses and puts her head in her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio busts out laughing. “It’s not a pyramid scheme. It’s literally a one-woman business. She raises bees and then makes beauty products with the wax. She has no employees, just Alice, who helps out for free because she’s pussy whipped.” Rio chuckles, and Agatha looks at her curiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“If it’s not a pyramid scheme why did she try to give me free samples the first time I met her?” Agatha asks skeptically. Rio is still laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Probably because she was being friendly,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>you ass,” Rio tells Agatha who shoots her a dark look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You love my ass,” Agatha says and smiles sweetly, standing up next to Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha bends to gather her and Rio’s empty plates, giving Rio the perfect view of said ass. Rio can’t resist and bites at it through the gym shorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Down, boy,” Agatha scolds and laughs. Rio lets out a whine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>On the way to the farmers market, Rio plans to drop Agatha off at her place. Agatha lives a few blocks away from the University in an old building that all the graduate students seem to live in. Agatha says her place is fine, but she’s never invited Rio inside. Agatha’s said that her roommate is super annoying. As Agatha is about to get out of the car, Rio sees Billy Kaplan leaving the building.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to run off before he sees me. Have a great day, sweetheart.” Rio tells Agatha and gives her a quick kiss on the lips. Her foot is already on the pedal, ready to speed off, when she sees Billy Kaplan has run out and stood directly in front of her car. <em>Well, Fuck</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” Billy shouts, “I’ve been trying to get in touch with you for days! You’re always gone when I’m home and home when I’m gone!” Billy yammers excitedly.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Is this the woman you’ve been seeing?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Billy goes on, still somehow not seeing Rio’s face. He ducks down and peers into the car window, “Hi! I’m Billy Agatha’s roommate. It’s good to-” He cuts off as soon as he sees Rio’s grimace. He backs away from the car.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He murmurs. “Oh my god. Professor Vidal I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to assume anything. Please excuse me” He blushes furiously. “Agatha, I’m so sorry. What a silly misunderstanding, I’m mortified.” Billy laughs, and Rio wonders if he is seeking psychiatric help.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at Rio with her eyebrows raised, questioning. Rio lifts her hands, gesturing that it’s Agatha’s call.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Billy, Rio, Rio, Billy” Agatha introduces drily, and poor Billy Kaplan keeps gaping like a fish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio shoots him a glowering look. “Teen, before you freak out, this isn't breaking any rules, okay?”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It’s not?” Agatha and Billy ask in unison. <em>Yikes</em>, Rio thinks.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I would never jeopardize your career like that,” Rio says earnestly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Awe,” Billy says, looking at Agatha sweetly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck are you still doing here, Kaplan.” Agatha scowls, and to Rio's shock, Billy just laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha ignores him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles radiantly at Rio. “I’m not going to lie; I’m pretty relieved that this won’t end with you getting fired,” Agatha admits. “The violin section in the Mahler would go to absolute shit without you,” Agatha says and looks pointedly at Billy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Hey! Rude.” Teen retorts and Rio laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“This makes so much sense though” Teen continues. You’ve been making eyes at each other during rehearsals.” Billy smiles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Seriously Kaplan” Agatha groans. “Find somewhere to be” she begs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles at Billy and stage whispers to him, “Do you think she likes me?” Agatha looks murderous. Rio blows her a kiss, and heads to the farmers market.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio gets to the market and spots Jen’s booth immediately. Jen is absolutely swamped with customers, and Rio catches her eye, smiling and giving her two big thumbs up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio, get over here!” Jen calls. Rio isn’t sure what the best way to get over to Jen is, but the most immediate seems to be crawling under her display table, so that what she does.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m not even going to address that.” Jen shakes her head at Rio, “Just start cashing out customers for me, okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio starts collecting people’s money and doesn’t stop for three more hours until Jen’s completely out of product. She helps Jen pack up, and Jen hands Rio a fat stack of cash.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Your cut. Don’t worry, its only ten percent of what I made today.” Jen tells Rio when Rio tries to decline the cash.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You know who could probably use this money more than me?” Rio asks, as she pockets it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen glares at her, “If you say Agatha I’m going to take that money right back from you.” She says sharply. Rio laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I was going to say your students, generally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You should have them help you and Alice out. But, yeah, I don’t think Agatha would hate getting a stack of cash for minimal labor” Rio says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You realize I’m already technically her boss at school, right? Her GA is accompanying my choirs and she’s unbearable.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jen tells Rio, and Rio balls her hands into fists. If Rio throws the empty boxes she was carrying into Jen’s trunk with more force than is strictly necessary, that's not her problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Jen exhales. “Okay, okay, I won’t say anything mean about Agatha, sorry.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a breath. “She probably isn't the best fit to play for your choirs” Rio admits. “But, I know you’ll love her when you get to know her outside of that,” Rio tells Jen vehemently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“She’s brilliant and funny, and impulsive, and difficult, and more fun than anyone else I’ve ever met before.” Rio gushes. Jen laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’ll take your word for it. And not just because I think you might punch me if I don’t”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jen promises. “I mean, I hated you for years, before we became friends” Jen admits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles wide, “And now you can’t get enough of me, Kale” she teases. Jen rolls her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t go that far, but if you’re serious about her then I’ll figure out how to at least pretend to like her,” Jen tells Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Like I do with you, for Alice.” Rio nods her head in understanding and feels closer to Jen than ever before.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>On the morning of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Westview Symphony Orchestra’s Mahler five performance, Rio wakes up to the pale, wintry sun streaming into her bedroom. She turns, expecting to find Agatha sleeping soundly, but instead, the other side of the bed is empty. Rio’s gut twists with worry. Agatha’s been sleeping over most nights, and not once has she woken up before Rio. Rio pops out of bed, picks up Agatha’s silk robe from the floor, slips into it, and leaves the bedroom to find Agatha and make sure everything is okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio spots Agatha quickly. She’s standing in the middle of the living room in a forest green chemise that Rio bought her. In the soft morning light, Rio thinks she looks like a Vermeer painting. Her hair is wild, curling down her back, and Rio can see her nipples pebble through the delicate silk of the nightie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The light shines across Agatha, beautifully highlighting her collarbones. Rio wants to lick them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio notices that Agatha’s eyes are closed, and Rio watches raptly as Agatha lifts her arms and starts to conduct an invisible orchestra. Agatha floats her baton through the air so gracefully that it looks as though it’s a wand and she’s casting a spell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha is quietly humming the opening lines of the Adagietto from the Mahler.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio feels a thrill low in her stomach as she watches. Her mind fills in the harmony and countermelody to the line Agatha is focusing on. Rio walks over to the leather sofa and sits down, happy just to watch. Agatha hears Rio and turns around, startled. She’s flushed from the exertion of conducting, and her pupils are blown wide. Rio is tickled as she recognizes the look on Agatha’s face. It’s arousal. Agatha stops and watches Rio for a moment, and neither one of them speaks. Agatha then turns her back to Rio, lifts her baton once more, and continues conducting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio watches Agatha hungrily. As she moves, her chemise lifts higher, showing Rio just the very bottom of her toned ass. Rio sits on her hands to keep from grabbing at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’s enjoying this far too much to interrupt. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio feels herself grow wet as Agatha continues. She thinks about how hot and bothered she gets watching Agatha during rehearsals and how she can’t do anything about it. But now, Rio is in the comfort of her own home. So instead of just pressing her thighs together and trying to focus on the music, Rio quickly slips her hand underneath the robe she’s wearing and touches herself. She glides a finger through her slick and starts drawing small circles around her clit, watching Agatha hungrily. Rio finally presses her finger against the hard edge of her swollen clit and chokes off a gasp at the contact. Agatha hears, turns around, meets Rio’s eyes, and smiles magnificently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha drops her baton, walks over, and puts her head between Rio’s thighs. Rio doesn’t last a full minute. After Rio catches her breath, she drags Agatha up from her lap and kisses her intensely. Instead of melting into Rio and deepening the kiss, Agatha stays stiff. Rio breaks away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Everything alright, cariño?” Rio asks gently, smoothing her thumb across Agatha’s brow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My mind is a little bit all over the place because of tonight,” Agatha admits sheepishly. “I’ve always had pretty bad nerves.” She explains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio nods her head. Performance anxiety was never a problem for her, but she knows it’s because she’s never actually been invested in performing. Rio shuffles Agatha into her lap and gently scratches Agatha’s back the way Agatha loves. Agatha sighs, relaxing into the touch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Are you nervous for tonight?” Agatha asks in a small voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio blows a raspberry into the back of Agatha’s hair, and Agatha giggles at the sensation. “Not even a little bit,” She tells Agatha honestly. “You are going to be tremendous, Agatha Harkness,” Rio says very seriously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes her away, “No, you dope.” Agatha rolls her eyes, “Not nervous about my conducting.” She elaborates. “ I meant are you nervous to play in public? It’s been twenty years.” Agatha looks at Rio curiously.</p><p> </p><p>“Eh” Rio shrugs, and Agatha lets out a small shout of frustration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Don’t tell me you're one of those freaks who doesn’t get stage fright” She moans, and Rio begins to laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I was playing violin in front of people before I could speak.” Rio defends. “I never felt nervous, but it’s because I never cared the way you do,” Rio says thoughtfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You also have never played poorly,” Agatha says testily, and Rio cackles.</p><p> </p><p>“Not the violin, but let me tell you, I would never touch a piano in public,” Rio tells Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, “Oh come on, you can’t be that bad.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio grins, “Yeah, I’m not that bad” she sighs, “I wanted to make you feel better.” She admits sheepishly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, when I played Rach two with the philharmonic in San Juan. It was very stressful, and I had a bad time!” Rio insists.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha smacks Rio in the chest. “Fuck off, little miss perfect prodigy”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs and gets up off the couch. “You still want to be left alone for today until the performance?” Rio checks. Agatha had asked that Rio drop her off at her apartment so she could focus before the concert.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Yes, please,” Agatha confirms and Rio nods.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Let me make you breakfast first. How about pancakes?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio grins, and heads to the kitchen already knowing Agatha will want extra chocolate chips in hers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When the performance is about to start, Rio is surprised when she finds that she is, in fact, nervous. It doesn't hit her until she walks out onto the stage and sees the concert hall filled. It’s the same feeling as running into a former friend after the relationship had soured. It’s uncomfortable, as though her skin doesn't quite fit right on her skeleton. She doesn't start to feel any better until she spots Lilia in the front row waving at her excitedly. Lilia’s smile gives Rio a jolt of confidence, and Rio takes her seat and begins warming up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Billy Kaplan comes in and takes his place next to her, shooting her a grin. “Profesor Vidal, your jumpsuit tonight is an absolute slay,” he says. Rio looks at him strangely. <em>Slay can’t be good</em>, she thinks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>She glowers at Billy. “You don't know what you're talking about” she scolds him.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>She knows that she looks fantastic in this jumpsuit. She bought it a few months ago to wear to the New York Phil concert when they premiered one of her new pieces. The reviews of her piece were bad (Music journalists wouldn’t know good art if it hit them over the head), but the reviewer did talk at length about how great her outfit was. Which was enraging-Rio was positive that no review would mention a composers outfit if the composer was a man. But, Rio knows the jumpsuit is <em>hot</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It’s a matte black satin with long sleeves and a plunging neckline that ends just underneath her solar plexus. It has a thick belt cinching the waist, and the pants are cut like tuxedo trousers. Rio scowls at Billy, <em>idiot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p> </p><p>Billy looks confused for a moment at Rio’s reaction. “You know slay is good. Like, cool, right?” He asks Rio and has enough sense to look afraid of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio’s not embarrassed that she didn’t know this new jargon.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, and mumbles “Thanks”. Billy smiles wide.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio stands to tune the orchestra, and the audience applauds. Her bow slides across the string of her violin and she feels a shiver run up her spine as the orchestra tunes to her instrument. Rio knows it’s going to be a good performance. Once everyone has matched her pitch, Rio sits down again. It’s time for Agatha to enter. Rio holds her breath and finds, implausibly, that she’s nervous again. She doesn’t want to let Agatha down. Rio’s palms begin to sweat.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Agatha enters, and a hush descends over the concert hall. Rio feels her heart swell with pride as the audience claps for Agatha. <em>She deserves people to appreciate how good she is. </em>Rio thinks. She stands to face Agatha, and her mouth goes dry. Rio’s heart speeds up impossibly fast, and she feels happiness bloom deep inside her. Based on Agatha’s smirk and how warm Rio’s face feels, Rio is certain it’s obvious to everyone that she wants to eat Agatha alive. She can’t be bothered to care.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio swallows thickly, looking at Agatha. Her hair is loose and just as wild as when Rio found her conducting in the living room that morning. She has a burgundy lipstick that Rio wants to kiss off and is wearing a tuxedo that is so perfectly fitted to her that Rio thinks it may be custom. Rio is practically drooling. <em>Pull it together, Vidal</em>, Rio tells herself as she reaches out to shake Agatha’s hand. ‘<em>A show of respect that lets the conductor know the orchestra is ready’</em>, Rio can hear the voice of her very first teacher saying in her head. Agatha looks calm and regal as she takes Rio’s hand. Instead of shaking it, Agatha slowly lifts Rio’s hand to her lips and kisses it. Rio nearly faints. Agatha steps up to the podium, glares menacingly at her orchestra, and coaxes magic from them for the entire performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>In Rio’s opinion, Agatha’s conducting was flawless. She imbued each phrase with potent feeling and gave a powerful, glorious performance. The orchestra responded to the best of its ability, but Rio can’t wait for Agatha to conduct a group that’s actually worthy of her talent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>After Agatha takes her bow, she gestures for the orchestra to stand and take theirs. Rio rises and n feels dangerously joyous. Agatha is smiling at Rio, and Rio feels her heart skip a beat. After the final bow, instead of walking off stage, Agatha walks straight up to Rio and kisses her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At first, Rio is so stunned that she doesn't move. Then she leans in, registering what is happening. Agatha and her haven’t been particularly public about their relationship. Every time Rio tries to discuss her feelings or put a real label on them,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha shuts down. And now, Agatha is kissing her in front of a packed concert hall. Rio practically dissolves in Agatha’s arms. Agatha breaks the kiss and Rio tugs on her sleeve, grabbing her attention before she can run off stage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You were divine,” Rio tells her over the roar of applause, and Agatha nods her head in agreement.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio follows Agatha back to her dressing room where Agatha practically pounces on her. “You singlehandedly held up the violin section,” Agatha tells Rio, kissing underneath her jaw. Rio grins.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“And the violin section was the only decent section of the orchestra,” Agatha continues, grabbing at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio’s ass through her jumpsuit.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“So you were the only reason why anything I tried worked tonight,” Agatha mumbles into the shell of Rio’s ear, and Rio is putty in her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks at Agatha, “Everything you tried worked tonight.” She beams, and Rio leans in to give Agatha a bruising kiss. When she pulls away, Agatha is panting and her face is blotchy. Rio wants to drag Agatha down to the floor and be wrist-deep inside of her, but she knows that if they stay on campus much longer, people will start looking for Agatha. Students and professors alike will want to congratulate her and bask in her light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio steps back from Agatha. “I have some surprises for you tonight,” Rio sings, a smile playing on her lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“If the first isn’t you fucking me in this dressing room, I don't think I even want the others.” Agatha huffs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Greedy, aren’t we?” Rio chuckles. “Unfortunately, I think we should probably get out of here. Unless you want to spend the next twenty minutes making small talk with the parents of the undergrads who played tonight, and then get roped into going out drinking with the graduate students who played.” Rio raises an eyebrow, and Agatha shudders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You’re right about the undergrad’s parents, but I think we both know I’m too mean for any of my players to want to spend extra time with me now that the concert is done,” Agatha tells Rio seriously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio gives Agatha a questioning look. “I think you 're seriously underestimating Billy Kaplan if you think he's not going to try and get you to drink some stupid little gay drink with him tonight,” Rio says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts, “As opposed to me drinking some stupid little gay drink with you?” She asks Rio, laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Among other gay things, starting with dinner reservations and ending with us spending the evening in a hotel room with a killer view of Central Park,” Rio promises.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“I already have an overnight bag packed for you in the car,” Rio confesses and watches as Agatha glows with pleasure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Two hours later, Rio’s changed out of the jumpsuit into a pair of slacks with a white button down, and Agatha’s comfortable and cozy in the change of clothes Rio’s packed for her: an eggplant-colored cashmere sweater and dark wash jeans. They’re at a small bistro in the Upper West Side, sharing a plate of steak frites and finishing up their second bottle of a heinously overpriced red wine. Rio feels pleasantly drunk. The type of drunk where she’s hand-feeding Agatha fries, and Agatha is drunk enough to eat them and nibble at Rio’s fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“The fries are good, but your fingers are tastier,” Agatha says as Rio lifts another fry into her mouth. Agatha bites the fry and then grabs Rio’s hand before she can put it down. Agatha wraps her lips around the tip of Rio’s index and middle finger and sucks hard, using her tongue to pull Rio’s fingers into her mouth up to the first knuckles. Rio’s eyes go wide, and wetness seeps out of her. <em>This underwear is useless</em>, she thinks. Agatha’s eyes twinkle, and Rio just knows Agatha’s going to do something unhinged. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>First, Agatha sucks Rio’s fingers down her throat, deeper and deeper, looking up at Rio through impossibly thick eyelashes, and then, smiling, she gags on them. Agatha spits Rio’s fingers out and coughs delicately. Rio is fucking cooked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“That’s it, you’re done,” Rio tells Agatha in a low voice, taking out her wallet and leaving a stack of bills that should be more than enough to cover the meal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio stands to get ready to leave, and as she helps Agatha put her arms through the sleeves of her coat, Agatha whimpers softly into her ear. “I don't want to wait to get to the hotel.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And Rio is nothing if not attentive to the needs of the woman she loves. She takes Agatha’s hand and starts to lead her in the direction of the bathroom. They’re almost at their destination when Agatha pauses, suddenly immobilized.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio turns, surprised that Agatha has stopped, and her heart shatters when she sees the look of fear and surprise flash across Agatha’s face. Rio turns to see what could be causing this and tastes bile on her tongue when she sees the face of Evanora Harkness standing with a plain-looking man.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face quickly hardens as she masks the fear Rio saw just a moment ago. Her spine stiffens, and she takes in a quick breath of air through her nose. She lifts her chin and meets Evanora’s eyes. “Mother,” Agatha greets in a measured voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Evanora looks shocked to see Agatha, almost panicked, and Rio feels an ache in her gut. If Rio’s mother saw her out of the blue, Rio knows she would have been immediately wrapped in a fierce hug. Rio’s chest feels sore, knowing she’ll never be able to do that again. Rio glares at Evanora.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha” Evanora says dismissively and nods. Rio is shocked when Evanora starts to walk away ending the interaction. Agatha looks as though she’s about to vomit. Rio can’t stand for this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Evanora Harkness” Rio barks out, maybe too loudly, Rio realizes. People are staring. Rio clears her throat, takes a breath, and tries again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Evanora,” she says politely. Agatha is frozen in place, and Rio can feel every inch of Agatha’s panic as if it were her own. Evanora turns, wearing the fakest smile Rio has ever seen. It makes her insides curdle.</p><p> </p><p>After a moment of staring, Evanora’s face lights up with recognition. “Rio Vidal,” Evanora says in a voice dripping with charm. “A pleasure to see you again. I was at the concert where the phil premiered your orchestral suite. Your compositions are certainly unique.” Evanora tells Rio and turns to the man by her side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“This is Rio Vidal.” She explains to him. “She writes the pieces with all of the marimba. You know, the<em> ethnic-</em>sounding ones.” Evanora whispers, and Rio has to bite her tongue to stop herself from making a scene.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Evanora continues, “Rio, this is John. He’s part of the hiring committee at Juilliard. I’m in charge of their piano program now,” Evanora beams. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>John looks curiously at Rio and Agatha before speaking, “Hi Rio, I love your work. I think your writing for percussion is brilliant, and I loved how you incorporated <em>bomba</em> rhythms into your last symphony.” He says, shooting Evanora a strange look. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He continues, “And Agatha! Lovely to see you again. I didn’t realize you were related to Evanora. Correct me if I’m wrong, but you didn’t use Harkness as the name on your application last year? It was ‘O’conner’, right?” He asks intrigued.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My father's name.” Agatha mumbles, and looks at the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>John nods. “I can see why you wouldn’t want us to make the connection during the application process. What with your mother being in consideration for a faculty position at the same time and all.” He gestures his hands loosely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“We were so disappointed we lost out on you to Westview,” John says, turning to Evanora, “Your daughter was the best-conducting candidate we had seen in <em>years</em>, we were shocked when she turned us down. But I’m sure she’s in good hands now with Wanda Maximoff ” He tells Evanora amicably.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Evanora looks sharply at Agatha. “You’re conducting?.” She laughs bitterly, “That must be a joke. Where would you get the idea that you’re capable of that?” She snarls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at Agatha. Agatha’s eyes are still trained on the ground, and she looks smaller than Rio has ever seen her. She’s transformed back into a young girl who simply wasn’t given enough love. Rio wants to destroy Evanora.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha conducted Mahler five tonight, and it was brilliant. We’re out celebrating her triumph.” Rio tells Evanora with a glare.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally looks up at Rio and smiles. Rio feels the world shift back on its axis. Evanora looks skeptically at Rio. “And your connection to Agatha is?” She asks with a grimace, looking between Agatha and Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha straightens her spine and looks her mother directly in the eyes. She grabs Rio’s hand and tells Evanora calmly. “Rio is my girlfriend, and I love her.” Agatha turns on her heel and guides Rio out of the restaurant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio wants to leave space for Agatha to voice any of her feelings, so they walk a couple of blocks in silence. Finally, after a few minutes, Rio stops walking and pulls Agatha into her, looping her arms around Agatha’s waist and cradling her gently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I love you too, Agatha,” Rio says softly and Agatha presses harder against her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I know” Agatha mumbles into Rio’s shoulder. “You might be the first person who ever really has,” Agatha admits very quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses. “I love you more than anyone has ever loved another person in the history of the universe,” Rio declares. “You don’t need her love; you have mine.” Rio feels her neck grow wet with Agatha’s tears. She tilts Agatha’s head up and kisses her fiercely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>After a minute, Agatha breaks away, breathing heavily and grinning. “How far away are we from a bed?” She pants, and Rio takes her by the hand and they speed walk to the hotel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Once they’re settled in their hotel room, a modern and luxurious king-size sweet overlooking Central Park, Agatha stares at Rio with a very serious expression on her face. “I need you to fuck me really hard and really good, immediately,” Agatha demands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I need you to make me cum so hard I forget that I’m a person. You up to the task?” She raises an eyebrow at Rio and gives an animalistic grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio stretches out her arms, interlaces her fingers, and cracks out her knuckles. “I’ve been training my whole life for this.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio helps Agatha out of her sweater and peels off her jeans, Agatha is left in a lacy lilac thong and matching bra. The bra is unlined, so Rio sees the pink rosebud of Agatha’s nipples. Rio lets out a contented ‘hmmm” and goes to kiss Agatha. Agatha pushes her back with one hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No touching until I get to see you.” Agatha orders and Rio immediately starts to undo the buttons of her dress shirt. She sheds it quickly and takes off her pants. Then, Rio remembers what she’s packed in the overnight bag, and pauses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I have something I’d like to try with you.” Rio brings up casually and walks over to the bag and pulls out a harness and strap. Rio looks up at Agatha’s face, to gauge her reaction. Agatha is practically drooling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Put it on. Now,” Agatha commands, and Rio nods with a smirk, her fingers deftly fastening the straps and working to secure the shaft. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha walks up to Rio and places her hand just below Rio’s mouth. “Spit” she orders and Rio gathers the saliva in her mouth and spits into Agatha’s waiting hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Good boy,” Agatha tells Rio, and Rio whimpers in response. They’ve never talked about this before, but Rio’s not surprised in the least that Agatha understands exactly what she needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha begins to pump her hand up and down the shaft until it’s covered in Rio’s spit. Rio feels her own arousal drip down her thighs. Rio softly groans, and Agatha turns away and walks toward the bed. She crawls on top of it, lays on her stomach, and kicks up her legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio” She whines, “what are you waiting for?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Something inside of Rio snaps. She lunges to the bed, scrambling to get to Agatha. She can’t think straight. Her brain can’t string together words to make sentences. Her hands reach for Agatha’s hips and she lifts Agatha’s ass off the bed. Agatha shifts so her weight is on her elbows, and pushes her ass up into the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Perfect”, Rio sighs, and Agatha groans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I need you inside me,” Agatha begs and Rio gives her ass a light slap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“When I’m ready,” Rio says sternly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Now.” Agatha growls and Rio laughs. She sees Agatha’s arousal dripping down her thighs and can smell it. Rio takes her hand and fists it into Agatha’s hair, pressing her face down into the mattress. Rio lines herself up with Agatha’s pink swollen pussy, and plunges deep, burying herself entirely in Agatha with one thrust.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha cries out and it’s pure music. Agatha starts shifting her hips back and forth, riding Rio’s strap at a furious pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Mmmm” She hums, “I feel so full of you, my love” Agatha breathes and Rio hips pump in and out quickly. Rio bites into the meat of Agatha’s shoulder and continues thrusting at a breakneck speed, practically folding Agatha in two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio sees Agatha’s hand reaching down to touch herself. She swats it away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No touching. You’re only for me, sweetheart,” Rio tells Agatha as she replaces Agatha’s hand with her own. She finds Agatha’s clit, swollen and raw and can feel it pulsing. She rubs circles into it, and Agatha stops breathing. Rio can feel Agatha tense underneath her like the string of a bow pulled taut. Agatha finally releases, and a gush of liquid sprays out of her. She groans low and raw into Rio’s ear. Rio keeps fucking into Agatha until Agatha pushes herself off of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Enough,” Agatha laughs, pushing a damp strand of hair away from Rio’s sweaty forehead. “Let me take care of you, my good boy.” She murmurs dreamily and unfastens Rio’s harness. If Rio wasn’t already sleepy and sex-drunk, she’d be ashamed of how quickly she comes undone by Agatha’s tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When Rio wakes up the next morning, her limbs are tangled with Agatha’s. She snuggles into Agatha and lets herself drift off once again. She’s comforted by the soft sound of Agatha’s breathing and the warm heat of her body and is swiftly lulled back to sleep</p><p> </p><p>Rio wakes to the sound of Agatha's voice. She cranes her neck and sees Agatha, wrapped in a hotel robe at the door of their suite, accepting a tray of food. Agatha walks over to the bed, and Rio flushes when she sees the bite- marks she left on Agatha last night, knowing whoever brought up room service received the same view. Agatha sits next to Rio on the bed and leans down to kiss her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, my love” Agatha purrs into Rio’s ear and Rio smiles wide.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, cariño” Rio croaks out voice still thick with sleep. Rio gently traces her finger over a bruise below Agatha’s ear. “Are you alright after last night?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods her head, as she takes the lid off of their tray of breakfast. Rio sees eggs, potatoes, bacon, pancakes, and fresh fruit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha waves a hand at the tray. “I hope you’re hungry, you worked up quite a sweat last night, so I ordered us a bit of everything,” She tells Rio with a glint in her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs and sits up in bed. “Let's take this over to the table,” She says grabbing the tray, and bringing it to the small breakfast nook nestled in the window overlooking the park.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, “This view is incredible”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hums, “I always love Central Park during winter.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, “I was talking about your ass,”</p><p> </p><p>“Always happy to receive a good review” Rio smirks, and grabs a piece of bacon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“So I hate to break our bubble, but I got a shitty text from Billy this morning,” Agatha tells Rio.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio's heart starts to race, and she feels her adrenaline soar, ready to protect Agatha’s honor. She looks Agatha in the eyes, “I can get him expelled at the drop of a hat”. She promises. Rio’s not sure how she’ll do it, but <em>where there's a will there's a way</em>, she thinks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her adoringly, and Rio melts. “No, my love, Billy didn't do anything wrong. He just shared some bad news. There’s been water damage in the apartment, and last night the ceiling in my room caved in.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs a breath of relief. “You should just move in with me.” She tells Agatha, the words leaving her mouth before her brain catches up and realizes what she’s doing. Rio looks at Agatha half expecting her to be packing up and running away. Instead, Agatha’s smiling brightly at her, and Rio’s chest cracks open with joy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha says simply and takes a bite of pancake. She pauses, looking up into Rio’s eyes, a flash of concern crossing her face. “You don't think it's too soon, do you?” She asks. Rio is already booking the U-haul</p>

<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>A note on the overall timeline of this fic- The quarter system at universities is quirky. Each quarter is about ten weeks, so our first chapter was on day one of the quarter, and the Mahler performance would have been the last week of the quarter, so about 10 weeks after our girls meet. This new chapter takes place at the end of the spring quarter, so 10 weeks or so after the events of chapter 6.  (If you do the math, our gals have known each other for just about five months at this point) But in my headcanon, this is just the type of psychotic they are.</p><p>Also peep the surprise Agatha pov ;)</p></blockquote>

<p>Agatha shuffles around nervously after putting down the last dips for the party on the patio table. Rio, for some Godforsaken reason, has volunteered their home as the location for an ‘end of the year’ gathering. Rio didn’t bother asking Agatha if she would be interested in this; she decidedly <em>is not</em>. But, because Agatha loves her girlfriend, she will dutifully assist Rio in hosting this afternoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels Rio’s toned arms wrap around her and a familiar heat spreads low in her belly. She turns around and gives Rio a kiss, which Rio deepens almost immediately, sucking Agatha’s bottom lip into her mouth and reaching a hand out to cup Agatha’s breast. Agatha leans into Rio and sighs happily.</p><p> </p><p>“Do we have time?” She asks Rio, and Rio is already trying to slip her hand underneath Agatha’s gingham dress. The dress was a joke at first. Agatha had bought it, telling Rio, ’<em>If you’re making me pretend to be your perfect little 1950s housewife and host a party, I might as well dress the part’</em>, but the way Rio had already fucked her in it twice this morning and was angling for a third go makes Agatha think the dress might not be banished to the back of her closet after all. Rio even decided to ‘<em>meet Agatha’s freak</em>’ (Rio’s grasp on Gen-Z slang is getting better, but is still not good) and is wearing cigarette pants and a retro-style bowling shirt. When Rio told Agatha what she was planning on wearing, Agatha laughed and certainly didn’t expect Rio to pull it off so well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em> She looks delicious,</em> Agatha thinks. Agatha was startled back into the present by Lilia’s voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Lovebirds!” I’m here and I brought baked manicott!” Lilia sings, and Agatha slaps Rio’s hand away from under her skirt. Rio smirks and wiggles her eyebrows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a breath, trying to get her heart rate back down. She clears her throat, and shouts “Gates open!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio goes to help Lilia with the food, and Agatha can’t stop looking at Rio’s ass as she walks away. Once the food is settled, Agatha walks over with two glasses and a bottle of Lilia’s favorite white wine. Rio sees and reaches for a glass. Agatha quickly steps back so the glass is out of reach, and smiles at Rio’s adorable little pout.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“These are for Lilia and me,” Agatha tells Rio sternly, and Lilia chuckles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues, “Besides, don’t you want a beer, big boy? And Rio flushes so red she’s almost purple. Agatha laughs, <em>just a little payback for this whole party thing, </em>she thinks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Next to arrive are Jen and Alice. Agatha likes Alice. She’s smart and kind, and her lectures are always interesting. She also has a great sense of humor and is always down to chat about the drama on <em>Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</em>. Rio refuses to watch; she thinks it’s unrealistic that none of the women on the show are fucking each other. Alice comes over to Agatha, holding a picnic basket that has two tumblers, a picnic blanket, and a bottle of wine inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Jen made this for you and Rio. She wanted to make sure you and Rio could picnic together at Tanglewood in style this summer” Alice explains, handing Agatha the gift basket.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Agatha’s touched. Agatha and Rio serendipitously ended up with the same gig this summer. At Tanglewood, Agatha will be a conducting fellow, and Rio will be the composer in residence. They get to have their big lesbian summer out in Western Massachusetts. Agatha’s half convinced they’ll never come back to Westview. Agatha blushes and thanks Jen for the thoughtful gift. she’s still not very comfortable with people being nice. Particularly Jennifer Kale.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It was all Alice’s idea,” Jen admits, wrapping her arm around Alice and smiling at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha and I are not that gross, right, Lilia?” Rio asks, pulling a face at Jen and Alice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio, honey” Lilia sighs, “you two are so, so much worse”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“We walked in on you fucking in the music faculty lounge,” Jen says, disgusted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“That was one time! And we thought nobody was still at the school it was midnight” Rio defends</p><p> </p><p>“I blocked that out”, Alice says wincing.</p><p> </p><p>Jen interrupts, “Of course, someone would still be on campus. We’re musicians, we don’t have a work-life balance.” Jen laughs. “Also, Rio, I wanted to let you know how proud of you I am that you invited Wanda to this party” Jen continues. “She’s so excited to be included.”</p><p>Rio balks, “I what?” She asks, staring daggers at Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes Rio’s hand in hers. “I’m sorry my love.” She says earnestly. “She heard Billy and I talking about it in a rehearsal, and I couldn’t just not invite her. She’s my adviser. If I want to have conducting opportunities next year I have to play nice.” Agatha explains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio just nods her head, pursing her lips. “Where is Billy, by the way?” Rio asks and is immediately answered as Billy bursts through the gate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I carpooled with Wanda and Vision. They’re just unloading the babies.” Billy explains and goes over to hug Rio. He extends his arms out and Rio makes no move to embrace him. He wisely turns to Agatha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Have you met the boys yet? They’re adorable” he gushes and Agatha <em>is</em> genuinely excited to see the babies again. Agatha tries to keep it secret, but every time she sees a baby she immediately turns to goo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not a great look for the bad bitch image she tries to maintain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I have, but Rio hasn’t,” Agatha tells Billy. She turns to Rio, starry-eyed, “Those babies really are perfect” She says, and Rio just raises an eyebrow in response.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Wanda comes through the gate pushing a stroller, and her husband follows holding a large cake. Agatha tries to remember his name.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio! Agatha!” Wanda exclaims and Rishes over to hug them. “Thank you so much for having us, it’s so great to have an excuse to get out of the house these days,” Wanda says, and Agatha notices her messy hair, the spit-up stain on her shirt, and how tired she looks. Agatha notes that the husband, <em>Victor? Viston?</em> does not look much better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Can I get you anything to drink”, Agatha asks, and just as Wanda starts to speak, one of the babies begins to cry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“That's Tommy.” Wanda sighed, “he’s been fussy all day. We think he has a tooth coming in.” She explains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>To Agatha’s surprise, Rio walks over to the stroller, and leans down, smiling at the baby, and he calms down almost immediately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Can I hold him?” Rio asks, and Wanda nods her head yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio picks up Tommy, making sure to support his neck, and starts softly murmuring in Spanish. Tommy coos back at her, and Agatha suddenly imagines that Rio is holding <em>their</em> baby, and she feels dizzy with want.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia breaks the spell, “Rio you really have the touch”, she smiles, impressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My Abuelita always said so too”. Rio, tells Lilia. Agatha finds herself suddenly blushing furiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Who wants food?” Agatha asks cheerfully, and the group begins to eat and drink, and Agatha has to grudgingly admit that the party wasn’t half a bad idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The image of Rio holding the baby doesn’t come back to Agatha until later that night. Rio is fucking into her with a double-sided strap. Agatha’s arms are behind her, pushing into the headboard, and when Rio hits that one spot just right, Agatha cries out, loudly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio keeps pumping in and out of her and then takes her hands to cradle Agatha’s face, She looks into Agatha’s eyes. “I want to cum in you” Rio pants “Can I cum in you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes her arms down and cusps Rio’s cheeks. “Yeah,” Agatha babbles,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes. Cum inside me” She whines, and beautiful, magnificent Rio does. Rio groans as she comes suddenly and the sight of Rio being pushed over the edge makes Agatha orgasm all over again. This time moaning in tandem with Rio.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>After Rio pulls out, Agatha lays her head on Rio’s chest and pictures Rio holding the baby again. She’s frightened by how strong her need for it is, to build a family with Rio. She holds the feeling close to her chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I wish you could” She speaks softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Hm?” Rio responds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Come inside of me, I mean. Get me pregnant” Agatha whispers. Saying the words out loud is so exposing that Agatha feels as though she has ripped into her chest and handed Rio her raw beating heart. She might as well have.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s response is to immediately hold Agatha tighter. “I’ve always wanted kids,” Rio says dreamily, and Agatha relaxes, letting out a breath she didn’t know she was holding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m too old now, though. I also don’t think I’d like to be pregnant” Rio continues forlornly, and Agatha looks at her seriously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rio” She starts, trying to find the right words. “My love, let me carry your baby.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rio looks at Agatha confused. Agatha looks deep into Rio’s eyes. “Your egg, I mean. We could use your egg to get me pregnant.” Agatha continues excitedly, and Rio’s face lights up with understanding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“We should wait until you graduate, sweetheart,” Rio says but Agatha can hear the excitement in her voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins widely. “I’m done with all my coursework. I just have to write and defend my dissertation this next year. Might as well grow you a baby at the same time, no?” She asks and gives Rio teasing kisses along her jaw. “Maybe we start trying in September? You're not getting any younger,” She teases, burrowing into the spot between Rio’s neck and shoulder and giving it a playful nip.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Rude,” Rio scoffs, “but it’s true, like, medically” Rio admits. “That would mean a spring baby” Rio giggles. “Una pequeña Agatha en primavera,” she says, going down to Agatha’s lower stomach and peppering it with kisses.</p><p> </p><p>As she’s about to fall asleep, Agatha feels Rio shift and sees her reach into the bedside table. Rio pulls out a small box, and Agatha feels all the breath leave her body. Rio’s eyes are shining with tears, and Agatha notices that she’s also started to cry. She feels giddy and giggly and so full of joy that she doesn't know what to do. Rio opens the box, and inside is a beautiful golden ring embedded with a large circular violet sapphire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio slips it onto Agatha’s finger, and it’s a perfect fit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
