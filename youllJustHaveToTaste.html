</p><p align="left">
  <strong>"The Salemites" teammates Rio Vidal and Alice Wu-Gulliver spotted out and about in New Jersey before semi-finals game this evening.</strong>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The notification had been brief in its appearance, slotted between a text from Wanda and a settings update Agatha had been putting off for a few days. She didn't even know why she decided to download Twitter in the first place, and the only notifications she got from it were clickbait engagements or trashy news headlines.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It was the name that had caught her eye - Rio Vidal.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha's son, Nicholas, was insanely into basketball. He'd been a fan since four years old, when his kindergarten had organised a game between him and his classmates, and he'd scored three times in a row and won the round for his team.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Particularly, he idolised the Salemites, which were a (unsurprisingly, given the name) Massachusetts-based basketball team that had won more games this season than ever before. Even more particularly, Nicholas adored Rio Vidal, an impressive and insanely skilled player who was arguably a celebrity regardless of being a decorated athlete. Her online presence and appearances in pop culture meant that a huge chunk of the internet loved her, and that only furthered Nicholas' admiration of her.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Granted, the name was of familiarity to Agatha, and so she glanced down at her phone to open the notification.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She paused on the photos taken, snapped by paparazzi a few feet away - Rio and Alice were walking somewhere downtown, coffees in hand. Rio smiled through it all, dressed in a striped white button-down, denim shorts and a pair of sunglasses perched on the top of her head.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha felt herself lingering on the picture. There was... something about her energy, the air around her. It was oddly attractive for a simple photograph.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She clicked out of the picture and ended up in the replies, curiously scrolling as Nicholas sat beside her on the sofa watching cartoons.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
  <strong>@<em>MUSIlNGS: </em>the way she holds that coffee. this lesbian......</strong>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> <strong>@yenvgb: </strong></em> <strong>the button-down omfughjdghjsahg i need her bad</strong></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> <strong>@vidalapologist:</strong> </em> <strong> they both look so fucking good im like feral. needingtons!!!!!</strong></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Her mindless scrolling was interrupted by a knock on the front door, and Agatha gave Nicholas a quick pat on the head as she stood up to answer it. On the other side, Wanda was waiting with a smile that reached her ears.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"What did you do?" Agatha asked sarcastically, letting her in on instinct at this point.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Where's Nicky?" She asked in a hushed voice, glancing around.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"He's just in the living room, is everything-"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Wanda reached into her pocket and pulled out two small tickets, shaded dark green. Agatha would've recognised that logo anywhere - the Salemites'. She stared at them in disbelief, then back up at Wanda's grinning face.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"How the fuck-"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Vision's buddy has connections, two of his friends couldn't come tonight. Agatha, these are <em>courtside </em>seats." She pointed to them excitedly, biting her lip. "Nicky will probably get to meet some of the players!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Oh my God." Agatha laughed in continual disbelief, then she grabbed Wanda and hugged her tightly. "Oh my God, Wanda! Jesus, I can't thank you enough!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Go on, go give them to him! I have to get back home for the boys, but let me know how it goes?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I will. Oh my God, thank you, Wanda."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">With that, she squeezed Agatha's hands goodbye and left as quickly as she'd come, leaving Agatha to hide the tickets in her pocket and walk back into the living room as nonchalant as possible.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">-</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">
  <em> <strong>@PopCrave</strong> </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>Rio Vidal stuns in new mirror picture as The Salemites prepare for the semi-finals tonight, taken by teammate Alice Wu-Gulliver.</strong>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The notification popped up on her phone just as Nicholas had taken his seat, practically bouncing around with excitement. He was in his green Vidal jersey, something he'd only worn on what he deemed special occasions, and Wanda had been around their house earlier that day with her boys to celebrate that Nicholas would get to see his favourite team play in person - thankfully, there was no jealousy on Billy and Tommy's part, as they preferred soccer to basketball. They'd eaten and laughed together, and Wanda had helped paint the Salemites' logo on Nicholas' cheek before they left to head to the game.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He'd been a endless ball of energy the whole car ride up, constantly asking if they were there yet and (adorably) nagging Agatha with questions about her favourite player.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She'd given the same answer every time - Rio. Which wasn't exactly a lie; she'd said it at first because she knew Nicholas would be happy that his mother shared his love for the player, but Agatha was particularly enamoured with her too, it seemed.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Suddenly she looked forward to those little pop-ups on her useless Twitter account, and she'd raced to open it this time as she sat next to her son, waiting for the game to start.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The picture was stunning - more so, the subject of the photo. Rio was in her uniform in what appeared to be the team's locker room, hair a mess in front of her face, and her jersey had ridden up to reveal a sliver of her toned stomach. Alice could be seen just in the corner, phone covering her eyes, but the smile on her face was knowing and mischievous. She knew exactly what she'd be doing posting it to her Instagram story.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha's tongue poked against the inside of her cheek as she stifled a laugh, scrolling down to read the inevitably insane replies underneath the tweet.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
  <em> <strong>@w0menluvr: </strong></em>
  <strong>ALICE YOU MOTHERFUCKER IM SOGJJDGSKGD</strong>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> <strong>@coveneve:</strong> </em> <strong> her stomach oughhhghgf i just fell to my knees in a walmart</strong></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> <strong>@sapphicwitch999: </strong> </em> <strong>the way alice is feeding us my god everyone say thank u alice</strong></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> <strong>@lovethrns:</strong> </em> <strong> everyone who sits courtside gets to see her up close..... just know im jealous of u bitches</strong></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Admittedly, that last reply got a breathy laugh out of Agatha, but she didn't have time to read anymore as the commentator announced the game's start. The crowd roared with cheers and applause, and Nicholas joined in with rampant yells of excitement. Agatha smiled down at her son, filled with glee at his own happiness, before joining in and clapping as the players flooded onto the court.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Unsurprisingly, the jumbotron lingered on Rio as she ran out, side by side with Alice, and she smiled and waved to everyone in the stands in that easily charming manner.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha couldn't draw her eyes away from it; how Rio seemed to effortlessly glide out to her position and nod to her teammates as they readied themselves for the opposing team to come out onto the court. She was boundlessly energetic and skilfully tracking the other players with her eyes, as if psyching them out from halfway across the floor.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Then, in a moment that stunned Agatha into stopping her applause altogether, Rio's eyes drifted straight over to meet hers. It felt like the entire world had gone quiet in that second, and Rio gave her a smile that knocked any sense from Agatha's head. But it was over just as quickly as it'd happened, and Rio was back to staring at the ref as he grabbed a ball from the courtside and tossed a coin between the two point guards.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It was decided the ball go to the opposing team first, and the Salemites readied themselves quickly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">With one final raise of his finger, the ref blew the whistle and tossed the ball over to the other side's point guard, signalling the start of the game.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Nicholas watched in amazement as it all fell into motion - players darting up and down the court, intercepting and dribbling the ball to the other side, and one of the opposing players got close enough to the basket. She took the shot from the outer circle, but it was brilliantly diverted by Rio, who leapt up in an impressive feat of athleticism and launched it in the other direction. Nicholas let out another cheer of excitement, and he grabbed onto Agatha's arm in his outburst.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Momma, Momma, did you see that? That was awesome!" He cried.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I did, Nicky, that was amazing!" She nodded back with a laugh, clapping along with everyone else in the stands.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The commentator congratulated Rio's smart move over the loudspeaker as she grinned and ran towards Alice, who'd managed to snag the ball before it could fly out of bounds and was currently dribbling it down the court. She faked a move right, then passed left to where Rio stood at the corner of the court and took the shot. It bounced off the backboard before dropping straight through the hoop, scoring the first shot of the game for her team.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Another roar of cheers from the crowd ringed out, and Nicholas shook Agatha's arm with excitement as they cheered together.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio wore a shit-eating grin as her teammates shook her shoulders, hugged her, jumped around her, and she mockingly blew a kiss over to the opposition before returning to her starting position.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The game grew tense as it progressed, and while the other team did manage to score, they were devastatingly outmatched by the Salemites' and their star player's tricks. By the third quarter, their win was almost certainly secured, and the opposition were clearly struggling as they fumbled and missed shots all the way into the fourth quarter.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">A nasty interception by their team meant that the ball flew out of bounds, and Agatha had barely registered what was happening until Nicholas somehow managed to catch it above his head, stopping it from potentially injuring him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Oh my God, Nicky, are you alright?" She asked, but he grinned wider than ever before at the realisation he was <em>actually </em>holding the ball the players had been using.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio just so happened to be the closest player to where the ball had gone, and she came running over to the boy with concern written all over her face.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You alright, buddy?" She asked, and Nicholas stared up at her, star-struck. "Sorry about that."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"It's alright, I caught it before it could hit me!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha stared at her in disbelief - seeing Rio right in front of her, a little sweaty and breathless; it was unbelievably attractive. Rio looked over at her, smiling that <em>fucking </em>smile of hers, before turning back to Nicholas.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Well done, little man." She laughed and ruffled his hair a little as he smiled up at her. "I like the jersey - you keep the ball, we've got plenty more."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">With that, Rio nodded a farewell to Nicholas and ran back onto the court, signalling for the assistant coach to grab a new ball to use. Nicholas held his new gift to his chest tightly, squealing with delight at the fact that he'd just talked to his favourite player of all time.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Momma, Momma, did you hear that? Rio said I could keep the ball!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I heard, baby, I'm so happy for you!" Agatha couldn't stop smiling, even as she pushed back his hair to check for any unmissed injuries. "Are you sure you didn't get hit? We don't want you to have a concussion, Nicky."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I swear, Momma. I caught it!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Satisfied, Agatha nodded and turned back to watch the game as it started back up.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">By the time they'd reached the final minute, the opposing team's clear tactic was to keep the Salemites from getting the ball and stop them from getting another shot before the buzzer. However, one player was a little too slow passing to their teammate, and Alice quickly intercepted the ball. She dribbled it all the way to the other end but the opposing team quickly surrounded her, and she passed it over to Rio on the other side, just at the three-point line. It was risky, but Rio took the shot, and the crowd erupted a final time as the ball dunked straight through the hoop.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The Salemites' all rushed to Rio, just as the buzzer sounded and the team was secured a place in the finals. She was pulled up into the air on Alice's shoulder, arms stretched out as she cheered, and flashes from courtside photographers filled the room.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Nicholas suddenly grabbed onto Agatha's shoulders in a tight hug, still clutching the basketball in one arm.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Thank you so much for bringing me here, Momma!" He said into her ear, pulling away to smile up at her in that adorable way. "This is the best day ever!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I'm so glad you had fun, baby." Agatha smiled back at him, and their attention was drawn back to the court as the team took a post-game photo together in front of the crowd. Rio, at the centre of it all, smiled at the camera, an arm slung around Alice's shoulder.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Suddenly, her phone buzzed in her pocket, and Agatha was surprised to find a new notification from her Twitter already.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">

  <strong>Rio Vidal seen comforting a fan and giving him the ball after it almost injured him. The video was taken by a fan sitting courtside, a few minutes before Vidal secured the Salemites a spot in the finals with an 82-68 final score.</strong>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Jesus, they work quick.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The video was pretty clear, taken somewhere across from Agatha and Nicholas to the right, and it began with Rio running over to them. She could be seen talking to him, their conversation unheard, but Nicholas' bright smile and Rio's ruffling of his hair was admittedly sweet to watch from another perspective. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Then, Rio nods them a goodbye and the focus turns to her running away before the video cuts out.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">On instinct, Agatha scrolled down to look at the replies.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> <strong>@vidalapologist: </strong> </em> <strong>oh she is so sweet to the fans im gonna kms</strong></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> <strong>@w0menluvr:</strong> </em> <strong> okay but the mom's reaction to rio is so real omfg</strong></p><p align="left"><em> <strong>          @coveneve: </strong> </em> <strong>wait omg help i didn't even see that at first she's just like us lmaosjhfsakjgd</strong></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha scrolled back up to the video, this time watching her own face - like a lovestruck fool, she stared up at Rio like she'd moulded the Earth in her palms. In fact, Agatha looked embarrassingly ready to jump Rio's bones right there on the court. She covered her mouth in shock, and another reply caught her attention.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> <strong>@MUSIlNGS:</strong> </em> <strong> help why is the mom kinda...</strong></p><p align="left"><em> <strong>          @yenvgb:</strong> </em> <strong> no ur right thats a milf right there!!</strong></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">

</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She couldn't believe it - the tweet was gaining attention fast, a video of her and Nicholas' interaction with Rio circling the internet. She slipped her phone back into her pocket and grabbed Nicholas' hand, trying to push the thought of it away as she ushered him up out of his seat.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"What do you say we head home and invite Wanda and Vision and the twins around? You can show them your new souvenir, Nicky!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Yes please!

  <p>"So..."</p><p> </p><p>Wanda reached over to nudge Agatha's shoulder, a shit-eating grin on her face. The boys had all gone into the living room with Vision to play Minecraft together, huddled up on the sofas as they battled the Ender Dragon, and Wanda and Agatha sat together in the sunroom with a movie playing in the background.</p><p> </p><p>"What?" Agatha asked, taking a sip of her drink.</p><p> </p><p>"Haven't you seen that video of you and Nicky going around? It's all over <em>my</em> social media."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh God." She rubbed her eyes, letting out an embarrassed grunt as Wanda poked her shoulder teasingly. "I had no idea somebody was filming us, it's so humiliating."</p><p> </p><p>"You looked at her like she'd hung the moon and stars, Agatha!" Wanda sounded amused, lowering the volume of the TV. "I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if <em>she's </em>seen the video at this point."</p><p> </p><p>"Please don't even suggest that, I can't even think about it. Nicky adores her, he's bound to see it at some point himself - I'll deal with <em>that </em>when it happens."</p><p> </p><p>Before Wanda could come up with a snarky retort at that, Vision came strolling into the sunroom just as he was finishing up a call. He smiled at the two and kissed the top of Wanda's head as he hung up the phone.</p><p> </p><p>"Mr and Mrs Davis can't go to the finals game either. Looks like you and Nicky will be able to go again, after all."</p><p> </p><p>"Seriously? Oh my God, he'll be over the moon. Thank you, you guys." Agatha said, reaching around to give him a brief hug. "Are you sure you don't want to go yourselves?"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, we actually bought our own tickets. You're gonna be stuck with us the whole game, unfortunately." Wanda smiled, nudging their shoulders together.</p><p> </p><p>"That's perfectly fine, that means Nicky can direct all of his questions to you, Vision."</p><p> </p><p>"Of course. Right then, ladies, what are we watching?" He asked, nestling up next to his wife.</p><p> </p><p>Truth be told, Agatha couldn't remember what they'd been watching, but her attention was quickly drawn to an almost familiar vibration in her pocket. She casually pulled it out and opened the notification, not even bothering to check it and assuming it to be that <em>familiar</em> platform.</p><p> </p><p>

  <strong>Rio Vidal stuns in new selfie with Alice Wu-Gulliver as they celebrate tonight's win.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>It almost felt scandalous to look at in front of Wanda and Vision - Agatha angled her phone just away from the couple on the other side of the couch, staring down at the photo. Rio's hair was wet and hung slightly in front of her face, and her fingers covered her mouth as Alice pointed up at the scoreboard above them displaying their 82-68 win.</p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>@vidalapologist:</strong> </em> <strong> the way they just stayed behind to take a photo with the scoreboard is so real</strong></p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>@delucabishvp: </strong> </em> <strong>i wonder if they've seen the video omg</strong></p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>@</strong></em><em><strong>aliceg: </strong> </em> <strong>oh we look too good i fear</strong></p><p>         <em><strong>@riovidal: </strong></em><strong>i forgot i have twitter but yeah so true</strong></p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat up in shock, staring down at the verified handle. She had no idea Rio had a Twitter account, and the sight of it immediately piqued her interest. That and the profile picture she’d chosen - Rio looked to be in some sort of club, disco lights decorating her face, and she stared at the camera with the oh-so familiar smile that Agatha had come to know and love.</p><p> </p><p>Checking to ensure their focus was on the TV, Agatha slightly turned herself away from Wanda and Vision as she clicked on Rio’s profile.</p><p> </p><p>The first thing she noticed was Rio’s header photo - a team photo from one of the Salemites’ previous wins, with Rio front and centre (of course). Agatha scrolled down, and she was surprised to find that the only tweet posted was from six months ago.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>"Momma?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jumped at the sound of Nicholas' voice, dropping the phone into her lap (screen-side down, thankfully) and smiling at him. "Yes, Nicky?"</p><p> </p><p>"Can Tommy, Billy and I cook some pizza?" He asked, perching his head atop the couch cushion to smile back at his mother. "Billy said he's big enough to take it out of the oven, I swear."</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, but wear oven gloves. And be careful, alright?"</p><p> </p><p>He nodded enthusiastically, and Agatha pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead before he ran back off to join the twins.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">—</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">It happened a few days after.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha and Nicholas always went to the Westview diner on Saturday mornings - he loved their chocolate chip pancakes, and she loved to see him so happy about the smiley faces they always arranged the chocolate chips into. She sat across from him in their booth, taking a long sip of her coffee.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"And then Billy jumped down from the towers, and me and Tommy put a bed down underneath the dragon, and we blew him up!" Nicholas recounted, stuffing a bit of pancake into his mouth. "Tommy said we can use the rest of the ender pearls to go to the End City, and then we'd get to use these cool Elytra wings that can make us fly around the map."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She was half-listening, trying her hardest to understand the intricacies of Nicholas' favourite game (Minecraft, was it?), and nodded along.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"That sounds like fun, baby."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"It's awesome. Can I go play at their house today?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"As long as you finish your pancakes." Agatha gestured to the almost-finished plate.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He grinned and stabbed the last piece with his fork, chewing and washing it down with the rest of his apple juice. "Thank you, Momma. Love you!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Love you too, Nicky." As he got up to run out of the diner, she called out to him one last time. "Stay on the sidewalk!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I will!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She laughed to herself and watched from the window as he excitedly ran through town, back towards theirs and Wanda's neighbouring houses.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The diner, thankfully, was pretty empty this time of the morning, and Agatha was happy to be in the quiet of it all for a moment. She casually scrolled through her phone, replying to Wanda's teasing texts about <em>that </em>video - when someone practically flew into the seat in front of her, startling Agatha and making her drop her phone in surprise.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Sorry, sorry, I just need a second."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">No.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Fucking.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Way.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha's eyes went wide as she stared at her - Rio Vidal herself, sitting in the booth with her hood pulled up and her eyes frantically searching the diner and the outside for something. When she seemed satisfied, she turned back to Agatha with a sigh of relief and pulled her hood down.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Hey, I'm really sorry but I need to hide out here for a bit. I'll leave you alone in a minute, I swear."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She smiled at Agatha, and all she could muster back was a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio, to put it plainly, looked beautiful. Her hair was curled at the ends and sat perfectly against her tank top, and she had a way of smiling that made her eyes look dark and smoky - and they shifted into something akin to recognition.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Do I know you?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em>Fuck. </em>That fucking video.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Uh... I-I don't think so?" Agatha lied, quickly switching off her phone and sliding it onto the table.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Oh my God, you were at the game last night, weren't you?" Rio smiled widely at the memory. "With your son? I gave him the ball, didn't I?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha laughed. "Yeah. Nicky was really excited you talked to him that night."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Really?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"He's a big fan. Won't let the ball out of his sight." </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"That's sweet. I really am sorry he nearly got knocked out, though."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Oh, it wasn't your fault." Agatha shook her head. She was struggling to comprehend how nonchalant she was being in that moment, sitting across from <em>Rio Vidal </em>and having casual conversation as if Rio wasn't a decorated celebrity and Agatha was... well, Agatha.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I'm sorry, I just realised I never got your name."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I'm Agatha."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Agatha." She nodded, leaning back in her seat. "You guys coming to the finals next week? I'd love to say hi to... Nicky, was it? Properly, this time."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"That's okay, I wouldn't ask you to do that-"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"No, seriously." Rio continued. "He seemed like a real sweet kid, it's no trouble at all. And his mom seems pretty cool, too."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She scoffed, but not in a distasteful manner. "You flatter me."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Anything for a pretty lady, Agatha."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha stared at her for a second. Was she... <em>flirting</em> with her?</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio's face stretched into another one of her grins, and she sat up, straightening her neck.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Look, why don't I..." She reached into her pocket, pulling out her phone. "Get your number, and I'll text you before the game starts."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha was speechless. Maybe she was hallucinating it all. Maybe the coffee was drugged.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You... want <em>my </em>number?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"If that's alright with you."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
  <em>I mean, what else was she supposed to say to that?</em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha took the phone from Rio's hand, typing in her number into a new contact, before handing it back over. With that, Rio nodded and slid it back into her pocket as she stood up.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"As much as I'd love to stay and talk, I am running late to an interview. But it was really nice to meet you properly, Agatha."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Yeah. Yeah, nice to meet you too, Rio."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio gave her one last smile before pulling up her hood and waving goodbye, walking out and down the street out of view, and leaving Agatha to sit in utter disbelief.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It was only later in the day, sitting at the countertop in Wanda's house as she, Nicky and the boys ran around cooking dinner, that she got the notification.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She stared down at the headline, and her heart fell down into her stomach.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">

  <p>Dinner was cooked, and the boys, Wanda and Vision were all laughing and eating together happily, but Agatha's mind was completely occupied by the headline and the photo.</p><p> </p><p>She re-read it over and over, looking at the picture and cursing whatever piece-of-shit paparazzi had snapped it. They were camped out somewhere across from the diner, and had somehow managed to get a clear shot of Rio and Agatha in the booth together, smiling at each other as Rio handed her the phone.</p><p> </p><p>Now it all made sense - Rio had tried to (and, unfortunately, failed) avoid any paparazzi, sliding into the booth of a random patron's table at a diner in a small town such as Westview. It made Agatha feel sympathetic to her situation, having to avoid every aspect of your life recorded and plastered online for the world to see.</p><p> </p><p>She picked at the food on her plate, bracing herself as she looked at the replies.</p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>@vidalapologist: </strong></em> <strong>friends... ✂️❓</strong></p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>@delucabishvp: </strong> </em> <strong>hey </strong> <strong>guys i don't want to sound delusional but is that the mom from THAT video????</strong></p><p><em> <strong>          @vidalapologist:</strong> </em> <strong> OH MY GOD WAIT SHE IS STOP???</strong></p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>@MUSIlNGS:</strong> </em> <strong> rio meeting up w the woman who was giving her heart eyes at the semi-finals... what in the wattpad</strong></p><p> </p><p>Suppressing a sigh, Agatha switched off her phone and put it away, turning her attention back to the kids and her friends across the table.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you think, boys?" Vision asked, stacking his and Wanda's plate, as they'd already finished their food earlier. "Finish your dinner and then we'll go out and shoot some hoops, as the kids say."</p><p> </p><p>"Awesome, we can use the ball Rio gave me! It'll make us as good at shooting as her!" Nicholas said, high-fiving Billy before the three boys started up a race to see who could finish their food the fastest.</p><p> </p><p>Once they'd eaten it all and ran off to the back yard to play, Wanda turned to Agatha and frowned as she gestured to her full plate.</p><p> </p><p>"Not hungry?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Oh, no, not really. I ate earlier." Agatha lied.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright. Well, I'm gonna go put on a movie." She grinned, tapping their shoulders together before walking over to the living room and plopping down onto the sofa.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha got up to join her, but a buzz in her pocket caught her attention before she could.</p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>unknown: </strong></em> <strong>hey stranger</strong></p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>unknown:</strong> </em> <strong> it's rio, don't block this number immediately please</strong></p><p> </p><p>"Hey, could you bring the wine over?"</p><p> </p><p>She quickly snapped out of staring down at the text, trying her best to ignore how <em>insane </em>her life seemed to get as it progressed, and nodded, grabbing the bottle and settling down beside Wanda to hand it over.</p><p> </p><p>The movie of the night was some period drama, Wanda's favourite genre, but Agatha found herself struggling to focus, her mind drifting back to the texts. She closed her eyes and rubbed them in defeat, turning to her best friend.</p><p> </p><p>"Wanda?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hm?" She replied, eyes still on the screen.</p><p> </p><p>"I have to tell you something."</p><p> </p><p>That got her attention, turning to Agatha with furrowed brows. "Uh oh, what happened now?"</p><p> </p><p>"I... may or may not have gotten Rio Vidal's number this morning."</p><p> </p><p>They were silent for a moment, the only sound present being that of the movie playing in the background. Wanda held her gaze for a few seconds, then took a sip of her wine, laughing.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh. Ha ha, very funny, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p>"Wanda." She said, assertively. "I'm not kidding around. She was in the diner this morning, came in just after Nicky left to go over and play with the boys."</p><p> </p><p>"You really expect me to believe that, Agatha? What the hell would <em>Rio Vidal</em> be doing in Westview, of all places-"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as Wanda spoke, and she abruptly cut her off by shoving the phone in her face, headline and photograph plastered across the screen. Wanda's brows furrowed again, and she practically snatched it from Agatha's hands, before her eyes widened like a cartoon character.</p><p> </p><p>"Holy shit?" Wanda nearly screamed, smacking Agatha's arm in a non-harsh manner. "Oh my God, how the fuck did this happen? How the fuck did you get her number?"</p><p> </p><p>"I didn't get her number, she asked for mine!" Agatha shot back, as if that would help.</p><p> </p><p>"How... how did you even start talking to her? I mean, have you told Nicky? He'd flip if he found out his own mother had his favourite player's phone number!"</p><p> </p><p>"No, I haven't told Nicky yet. She came into the diner, basically threw herself into the seat across from me to evade all the cameras and shit, and we talked. Embarrassingly enough, she remembered me. And then she offered to say hi to Nicky. Properly, this time."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh my God..." Wanda scoffed, smiling at Agatha as she leaned her chin on her hand. "Well, did you at least flirt with her?"</p><p> </p><p>"Wanda!"</p><p> </p><p>"What? I'm just saying; the look you gave her at the game when she came up to you, coupled with the fact that she <em>asked</em> for your <em>number</em>..."</p><p> </p><p>"She's a celebrity, Wanda." Agatha scoffed back, rolling her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"A celebrity you want to fuck."</p><p> </p><p>At that, Agatha shoved her best friend away in a fit of laughter, and they eventually settled back into the movie. Their talk did manage to quell Agatha's nerves about the entire situation, but then she remembered the texts Rio had sent earlier.</p><p> </p><p>She subtly opened the number without Wanda noticing, staring and letting her thumbs hover over the keyboard as she contemplated a response.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Agatha started typing back.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: i wasn't planning on it. hi rio</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>To her surprise, it only took a few seconds for a typing bubble to appear.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: yay u didn't block me!</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: i thought you said you were going to text me before the game...</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: game's not til saturday, rio</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: does it bother you that i courteously decided to message you a little earlier?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: not necessarily</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: perfect</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: soooo</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: what are you doing rn?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: drinking and watching a period piece</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: sounds utterly boring</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: not all of us are star athletes who party every night and go clubbing for fun</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: is that what you think my idea of a good time is?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: isn't it?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: it isn't</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: i'd love to show you my version of a good time, in fact</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>If it hadn't immediately given her whiplash, Agatha might've blushed at the implications behind that text. She struggled to formulate a response for a few minutes, before settling on <em>not </em>indulging Rio's flirting too much.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: how about you tell me instead?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: hmm ur no fun</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: my version of a good time would be good food, good talking and good laughter together</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: how romantic of you, rio</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: did i mention it'd all be topped off with a good fuck, too?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: ...</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: see, im not as predictable as you may think</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: i mean, you do have a way with literally dropping into people's lives</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: you nearly gave me a heart attack in that diner</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: aww</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: let me kiss it better, gorgeous?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: tempting, but i'm going back to my movie now if you don't mind</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: waittttt</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: one last question?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: go on</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: what are you doing tomorrow?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: goodnight rio</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: booooo ur no fun for someone so gorgeous</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: ...</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: ask me again in the morning</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: :)</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>The movie ended after an hour, conveniently just as Nicky walked back into the house with tired eyes and a big yawn. Agatha said her goodbyes to their friends, ignoring the sly comment from Wanda about Rio (<em>'Don't stay up too late sexting, will you?'</em>) and walking hand-in-hand with Nicky back over to their neighbouring house.</p><p> </p><p>He settled down quickly and was asleep mere moments after Agatha had kissed him goodnight, and she crawled under her own covers as her phone buzzed for the final time that night.</p><p> </p><p>The photo this time could've sent anyone spiralling. A dim selfie from Rio's own Twitter page, this time; she was laid in bed, staring up at the camera with a thin sleep shirt on, and the blanket just covered her lower half enough to reveal the black lace peaking out from underneath.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>@riovidal</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>goodnight, gorgeous 💋 </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn't even need to think about it before scrolling down.</p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>@MUSIlNGS: </strong> </em> <strong>coming back to twitter the day we clock ur tea... rio ily</strong></p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>@vidalapologist:</strong> </em> <strong> rio who is gorgeous... WHO IS GORGEOUS RIO</strong></p><p> </p><p><em> <strong>@coveneve:</strong> </em> <strong> posting this after those paparazzi pics today is insane work omg</strong></p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, sliding her phone onto the nightstand without another thought and lying down to finally go to sleep.</p>

  <p>It's as she's sitting at work the next morning, fiddling a pencil around the rim of her mug of black coffee, that Agatha got the text. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, and she thought nothing of it as she retrieved it, instinctually clicking on the notification.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: so what ARE you doing tonight, gorgeous?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced around the office, ensuring her boss was nowhere nearby to catch her using her phone, before typing back a response.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: nothing special</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: why?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: come over tonight</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: alice is throwing a party and i want to bring you :p</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: all that stuff about you not liking parties and clubs last night... wow</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: was it all a lie?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: ha ha very funny</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>rio: seriously, can u come with me plssss</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>agatha: i dont know...</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>The three dots appeared as Rio began formulating a response, but they suddenly disappeared, and Agatha was ready to put her phone down and return to a particularly boring spread of work. That was, until her phone rang on the desk, and the screen flashed with Rio's number and an <em>answer</em> or <em>decline</em> choice.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, pressing answer.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello?"</p><p> </p><p>"Nice to hear your voice again, gorgeous." She could practically hear the smirk in Rio's voice, leaning back in her seat with a grin.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm a little busy right now, Rio."</p><p> </p><p>"So say yes. And I'll hang up, and you can go back to whatever it is that's more important than me - I swear."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckled under her breath, leaning forward onto the desk by her elbow. "I'm at work right now."</p><p> </p><p>"And that's more important than me, how?"</p><p> </p><p>"Goodbye, Rio."</p><p> </p><p>"Wait, wait, wait!" Agatha stopped, hovering her thumb over the hang-up button before she raised it back up to her ear. "Say yes. Please. Or I'll keep calling. Better yet, I'll call your boss and make you answer from their phone."</p><p> </p><p>"And how would you know where I work?"</p><p> </p><p>"Lucky guess. Or I'll call every business in Westview until I reach you." Rio laughed.</p><p> </p><p>"Fine." Agatha conceded, sighing like the decision had been a hard one to make (it wasn't). "Yes, I'll come."</p><p> </p><p>"Yay!" Rio squealed, unbelievably childlike, and there was a shuffling noise from her end. "Okay, I'll pick you up at 10. Wear something sexy, please?"</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know if I own anything like that, but I'll try my best."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh please, you'd look sexy in a nun's habit."</p><p> </p><p>"Is this your way of telling me you've got some type of religious kink?" Agatha flirted, toeing the line to gauge Rio's reaction.</p><p> </p><p>"No, but I'd <strong>love</strong> for you to bend me over and sp-"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm hanging up for real now."</p><p> </p><p>"Boo, you're no fun."</p><p> </p><p>She didn't give it another thought, dropping the phone onto the desk and poorly masking her laughter with her hands over her face.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚢</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">The car pulled up just before 10, and Agatha stared at her reflection one more time in the mirror beside her front door. After an <em>excitable</em> conversation with a much-too proud of herself Wanda about the party invitation from Rio, she'd dragged enough dresses to fill the Titanic into Agatha's bedroom and dumped them onto the bed. Through many miles of trial and error, they eventually settled on a dark green number that dipped into a sweetheart neckline and fell just around Agatha's mid-thigh.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Admittedly, it was the nicest and most done-up Agatha had looked in years. Her hair was free of its work braids and flowed down her back in her natural, wavy fashion, and the heels Wanda had let her borrow made her legs look insane.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em>'Seriously. If Rio doesn't put out, I will.' </em>Wanda had joked, sending them both into a fit of laughter on Agatha's closet floor.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">To explain to Nicky why she'd be out all night, Agatha had chalked it up to a meeting with an old friend from college. She didn't necessarily enjoy having to lie to her son, especially given his adoration for the woman Agatha was meeting, but the promise of getting to sleep over at Billy and Tommy's house was enough to take his mind off of questioning it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">There was a set of knocks on the door, and Agatha swallowed nervously as she opened it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">On the porch stood Rio, in an unbelievably gorgeous black dress of her own. The fabric dipped around Rio's waist, leaving the tanned skin of her hips on display for the world, and her mouth brightened into a sultry smile as she met Agatha's eye.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"<em>Fuck, </em>you look good."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha couldn't help the laugh that sprang forth, and Rio offered out a hand to her. "You scrub up nice yourself. It's good to see you out of a basketball jersey."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You don't like how I look in my uniform?" She faked a pout, leading Agatha down her driveway and to the car waiting outside.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I didn't say that." Agatha shrugged as nonchalantly as she could. Truth be told, Agatha had been having some not-so savoury thoughts about Rio in her uniform; sweaty and lithe as she hovered above Agatha in her bed, sliding those skilled hands down her stomach and-</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
  <em>Jesus. Get it together.</em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio chivalrously opened the back door for Agatha, ushering her inside and then getting in on the other side. The driver gave Rio a nod and she nodded back, settling into her seat as they set off.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"So." She paused, glancing over Agatha coyly. "What made you say yes in the end?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Besides your incessant nagging and threats to call my boss?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Of course."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha smiled, leaning back against the headrest for a moment. "I don't know. You... intrigue me, Rio."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Yeah?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You're pretty hot, too. That's a plus."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She was surprised at her own boldness, and Rio clearly had been too. The tips of her ears tinged pink and her tongue poked against the inside of her cheek, a habit she'd never tried to kick. Rio turned to look forward, and Agatha was surprised to find they were pulling into the drop-off section of a Hilton Hotel. She was also unnerved to find a crowd of photographers waiting outside the barriers of the hotel entrance, eager and seemingly readied with their cameras.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Fuck, what are they doing here?" Rio groaned, leaning forward to ask her driver.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I'm so sorry, Miss Vidal. There's no other way into the hotel, but I can escort you two inside if you'd like."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Forget it, they'll get pictures of us either way." She sighed. She then turned to Agatha with a sympathetic look. "If you're not up for this then I totally understand. I can take you somewhere else, I'll text Alice and let her know-"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"No." Agatha shook her head, glancing over at the crowd through the tinted windows briefly. "It's fine. Wouldn't want to blow off a party with a celebrity, would I?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio smiled at that, giving their driver the okay and allowing him to step out and open the car door for her. The street was immediately filled with flashing lights and yelling voices, all directed towards the car and to Rio. She chivalrously offered out a hand to Agatha and helped her step out, sliding their fingers together as she quickly led Agatha inside of the hotel. They avoided any and all invasive questions, and Agatha blushed as the stereotypical <em>'Rio, Rio, is this your girlfriend?!' </em>was called out by one of the paparazzi.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The doormen helped them inside without a second thought, and Rio finally relaxed as they entered the lobby together.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"So the party's in a hotel?" She asked.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Yup. Alice and I sprung for a penthouse suite, the other girls on the team are in a Ritz across town."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"So it's in a hotel <em>room?" </em>Agatha chuckled, her nerves quelled slightly as Rio continued to lead her to the elevator, never once dropping her hand. "You must be terrible neighbours."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"The worst."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio smiled, eventually dropping Agatha's hand, much to Agatha's disappointment. The elevator took a couple more seconds before the tell-tale ding, and the doors slid open to reveal a dark hallway with people littered about. Everyone turned and cheered upon seeing who was waiting in the elevator, raising their solo cups to Rio as she laughed and led Agatha out, stopping to say hi to a few of them before entering the open double doors into the suite.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She hadn't been lying - this really <em>was </em>a party.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The lights were off, and the room was instead filled by the flashing of multicoloured LEDs, all set to a loud track of club music playing over speakers. There were even more guests inside, dancing wildly and mingling throughout the giant space of the penthouse suite.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Rio!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha swallowed, taken aback, and she watched as an overbearing Alice Gulliver pushed through a few people to run over to Rio and pull her into a hug.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Finally, where the hell have you been?" She yelled over the music, pulling back to shake her best friend's arms.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I thought I'd bring a guest." Rio turned to Agatha, wrapping an arm around her forearm and sending sparks of electricity all through Agatha's limbs. "Alice, this is Agatha."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Alice looked over her, smiling all the while, and her eyes seemed to flash with... recognition?</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Nice to meet you, Agatha!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She then reached forward, grabbing both of their hands and dragging them through a crowd of dancing bodies to the kitchen area of the suite. There were bottles strewn across the countertops - tequila, vodka, rum, and whiskeys which Agatha was almost certain cost more than the entirety of her closet. Alice reached for three solo cups, mixing together an insane cocktail of spirits with a seemingly minimal amount of mixer.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">They all took one, cheers-ing them in the air before downing them in one gulp.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha recoiled, face scrunching up as Alice let out a drunken-sounding laugh. "Fuck, what is this?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I call it the blackout. Because, well..." She giggled to herself, taking another drink that she'd seemingly pulled out of nowhere. "Enough of these and you won't remember a fuckin' thing the next morning."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Alright, take it easy. I don't want her paralytic in front of her son, Alice." Rio scoffed.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You have a son?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Yeah, cute kid. Nicky." She answered for Agatha, sliding over a cup of mystery drink. Thankfully the taste didn't immediately churn Agatha's stomach; instead it was a healthy mix of vodka and diet coke.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Come on, you guys, let's dance!" One of their teammates yelled, Jennifer, as she grabbed Alice's arm and dragged her over to the makeshift dance floor. She went willingly, but Rio offered a look to Agatha questioningly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Well?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha shook her head with an unbelieving laugh, but she nodded and took Rio’s hand as she led them over in the direction Alice and Jen had gone.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The people around them were caught up in a world of their own, jumping and swinging around to the upbeat music filling the air of the suite, and Rio dragged Agatha in a little closer for comfort. Her arms lifted above her head, Rio grinned down at Agatha as her hips moved in time with the music.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">As the night progressed, Agatha felt the alcohol finally begin to hit her - her movements grew looser, and she could feel herself getting closer to Rio as they danced together.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Eventually, Agatha felt Rio’s hands slide around her waist and turn her around, boldly pressing herself into Agatha’s back. She let her hands drift down and encourage Agatha’s movements by her hips, leaning into the side of her neck to speak directly into her ear.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“You having fun tonight, gorgeous?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She didn't respond verbally, <em>couldn't </em>over the insanely loud music without having to yell, instead nodded enthusiastically enough that Rio could see her response. Agatha felt an embarrassing shiver run down her back as Rio's nails dug into her sides, biting through her dress and wrenching Agatha into a state of drunken desire. Not from the many drinks she'd consumed, but from the closeness - how she hadn't ever felt so comfortable in someone's presence before.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha turned in Rio's arms, never breaking the contact as her hands settled at the small of Agatha's back. She stared up into Rio's lidded gaze, their faces a breath apart, and it was almost enough for Agatha to completely forget where she was - in a sea of dancing bodies, standing in the penthouse suite of a fancy hotel, with a celebrity's hands wrapped around her, looking at her like she was about to take her by the hand and fuck her into the sunrise.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The tension between them, palpable and thick despite their environment.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It hit Agatha like a semi-truck.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She regrettably took a step back, noticing the flicker of disappointment in Rio's eyes.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
  <em>This isn't over, yet.</em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Is there somewhere around here I can smoke?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">That seemed to bring the excited spark back to Rio's eyes - she brought her hands around from her waist to take Agatha's hand instead, lacing their fingers together as she started leading her out of the crowd. They could clearly see the balcony was full of people, and so Rio eventually just walked them back out to the hallway, into the elevator and descending to the ground floor.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">They were silent as it moved; Agatha spared a single glance over at her, finding Rio was already looking back at her, and she failed to hide a grin.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Neither had let go of the other's hand.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The doors slid open, revealing a deserted lobby and an empty street outside. Thank <em>God.</em></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio chivalrously reached over to open the door, hesitant to let go of Agatha's hand but doing so to reach into her back pocket.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She retrieved her carton of cigarettes and lighter - a green number with the oh-so-familiar <strong>brat </strong>album cover splashed on it; a gift from Alice that Rio had nearly used up and was in need of a refill.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She pulled out two cigarettes, handing one over to the other woman and lighting her own with the very last of the lighter fluid, until it flickered out and died. They then leaned into each other, using Rio's to light the end of Agatha's, and Rio smiled as a cloud of grey escaped her mouth.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha just... looked at her, for a moment.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Her head wasn't swirling now, finally away from the intense environment upstairs. It wasn't that she hadn't been enjoying herself; moreso the closer she'd gotten to Rio, the more terrifying the reality of the situation she was in.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">But <em>fuck,</em> Agatha wanted to indulge it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Thank you." When Rio gave her a confused look, she smiled, taking a drag from her cigarette. "For inviting me, I mean."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"No need to thank me. I didn't want to come with anyone else but you, gorgeous."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">She reached up, brushing away a stray hair from Agatha's face. Agatha felt a warmth spreading across her face from where Rio had touched it, and she leaned into it as Rio moved down to cup her cheek. Her thumb circled Agatha's cheekbones lightly - as if acting on instinct, her eyes glanced down at Agatha's lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The world around them seemed to disappear in that moment.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">No more drunken dancers around them; no more thumping music filling the space; no more flashing lights blinding anyone within a five-mile radius.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">This was just them. Just Rio, with her stupidly soft hands and expression that could've shattered the resolve of thousands.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha inhaled shakily as she moved in, closer so that there was little space left between them, and she slowly plucked up the courage to lean in. It felt like they were moving in slow-motion, and Rio (though she'd never admit it) could've squealed with delight as excitement built in her chest. Their noses bumped momentarily, and Agatha had finally readied to just move in and kiss her-</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
  <em>Snap.</em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The noise was near-deafening in the moment. Breaking through their bubble, crashing like a glass against hardwood floors. Rio turned her head to the side, quickly followed by Agatha.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">A man in dark clothes, holding up a camera, perched behind a car on the opposite side of the street. The flash went off once again.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Fuck."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Rio's voice was laced with anger, practically dripping with utter rage.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Oh my God." Agatha breathed out, her face dropping.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Her mind first went to Wanda. She'd <em>never </em>hear the end of this after it got out. But it then went to Nicky - she prayed to any higher power in that moment, pleading that his iPad would suddenly break  and leave him with absolutely no way of finding out what she'd done before she could tell him herself.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Come on."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Agatha was suddenly brought back into reality as Rio's hand slipped around her wrist, pulling her towards a car and opening the door to usher her inside.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Take us back to Agatha's now." Rio managed to stop herself from physically seething, her voice clipped as the driver nodded and sped off, away from the hotel and the piece-of-shit camped outside of it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">⚢</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>The first thing Agatha registered upon waking up was buzzing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A buzz rattling around in her head, resulting from her stupid, stupid, </span>
  <em>
    <span>stupid </span>
  </em>
  <span>choice to continue drinking when she stumbled into her house last ni... or, wait-</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, the buzzing was coming from her nightstand. She cracked an eyelid open, groaning through the headache that quickly made itself apparent, to see her phone screen briefly light up in the darkness of her bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It also provided just enough light for her to notice Wanda's sleeping body on the floor beside the bed, her hair an absolute mess and her hand clutching onto an empty bottle of red wine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jesus. Christ.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>hell </span>
  </em>
  <span>was she thinking?</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After... the moment outside the hotel... her mind seemed to blur. A blackout, perhaps. She remembered Rio spurring her into the backseat of a car, urging the driver to take them back to Agatha's house-</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha whipped her head around in a panic, but she sighed and closed her eyes with relief when she </span>
  <em>
    <span>didn't </span>
  </em>
  <span>find Rio lying in bed next to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For one, it would've been incredibly weird and hard to explain as to why Wanda was in the room with them if they'd been... uhm, </span>
  <b>secondly</b>
  <span>, Agatha really didn't want the first time she'd </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally </span>
  </em>
  <span>get to kiss Rio (or more, perhaps) to be in the midst of a drunken blackout that she was struggling to work her way through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wait. Her phone.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned back to the nightstand and snatched it, clicking the first notification to appear and hoping it was Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, the familiar Twitter logo popped up, and directed her to some random user's tweet on her timeline. A video steadily reaching 20 thousand likes, and growing as the seconds passed. Agatha squinted as she watched the video, set to a track she recognised as some 2000s Rihanna song, and her eyes widened to find the video was of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, not exactly of her - a compilation of her, almost, except it slowed down and transitioned and shook in tandem with the beat of the music. Not to mention the fact that it wasn't just the video of her at the game, but this user had now managed to get their hands on paparazzi footage of her and Rio walking into the hotel together last night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, she dared to look up at the caption.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>@villxnelle</em>
  </b>
</p><p><b><em>#basketballgamemilf :</em></b> <strong>g</strong><b>uys just hear me out...</b></p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A groan from below the bed ripped Agatha from her phone, and she dropped it onto the nightstand defeatedly and let her hands fall onto her face, covering her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda reached around to grasp the comforter in her shaky fists, wrenching herself upward and blinking at her equally-dishevelled best friend in the bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck </span>
  </em>
  <span>am I on the floor?" She mumbled, climbing into the space on the other side of the bed. "We've shared a bed, like, a thousand times."</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shushed her gently, willing her headache to go away as she turned her face into the pillow. Her leg hiked up against the comforter and Wanda was about to settle into the bed too, ready to let them both keep sleeping off their bad decisions, when an involuntary gasp escaped her throat and she shot up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh my God!" She cried out, making Agatha groan with the way her voice assaulted her currently-fuzzy eardrums. It didn't help in the slightest when Wanda shook her shoulders. "You and Rio kissed last night!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At that, Agatha admittedly froze up. Her eyes shot open, staring up at her now very-awake best friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I saw the photos. It's, like, all over Twitter." She pulled the pillow out from underneath Agatha's head, ignoring her groan of protest. "Tell me </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span>, right now."</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Didn't we go over this last night?" Agatha sighed, though she had absolutely no idea if that was true. Her mind was a </span>
  <em>
    <span>complete</span>
  </em>
  <span> blank.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bitch, I can't remember, we were too drunk!" Wanda rebutted, much to Agatha's disappointment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She rolled over and let out a huff of a sigh, covering her eyes once again to shield them from any light that could reach her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We... we didn't kiss."</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Liar!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, seriously." Agatha half-heartedly gestured to her phone. "The pictures- they're not what you think. I... I was </span>
  <em>
    <span>about </span>
  </em>
  <span>to kiss her, but I stopped."</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What in the hell possessed you to stop yourself from kissing Rio-fucking-Vidal?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The guy invading our privacy across the street!" She groaned. Then, she uncovered her eyes and let a look of vulnerability pass over her face as she winced at Wanda's expression. "I really wanted to. And... I don't know if I fucked it all up now."</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh."</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda's face morphed into a look of compassion, realising that her best friend wasn't simply kidding around anymore. She sighed, laying back down against the pillow. "What if you texted her? Maybe... ask her out for lunch, or something?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before she could even think of a response, the doorbell downstairs rang out through the house. Agatha, still reeling from a headache, winced at the noise and slowly collected herself, slipping out of bed. She trudged down to the front door and opened it without a second thought, unprepared for what was waiting on the other side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good morning, sunshine."</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked perfect, because of course she did - standing on the porch in a pair of flares and a sweater, eyes masked with her trusted pair of black sunglasses. She pushed them up onto her head, letting out a chuckle as she took in Agatha's current form.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Dressed to impress, huh?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha's brows furrowed in confusion, until she looked down and realised she'd answered the door in only a shirt that reached just above the waistband of her panties, leaving them completely on display. She yelped and grabbed ahold of Rio's arm to yank her inside and slam the front door shut, barely taking the time to consider the potential consequences that action could yield.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Woah, if you wanted to drag me into your house, you could've just asked, sweetheart." Rio joked, an all-too grin of amusement plastered on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's not funny, I was half-naked in front of the whole neighbourhood!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's a little bit funny, c'mon."</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn't have time to give another sarcastic retort, as a gasp from the bottom of the staircase drew both of their attention to it. Wanda stood against the banister, looking equally dishevelled and wide-eyed as Agatha, but dressed in more clothes than her counterpart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're Rio Vidal." Was all Wanda could get out, glancing over at Agatha as if to say <em>what the fuck?!</em></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio just laughed, hands stuffed into her pockets. "I am, yeah."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At that, Wanda let out a nervous laugh and reached out to shake her hand. “I’m Wanda. Uh, Agatha’s best friend. Big fan of your work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, it’s nice to meet you, Wanda.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They separated, and Wanda practically scurried over to the front door to make a hasty exit. “You too. I, uh… gotta get home, check on the boys and all that-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Actually-” Agatha grabbed Wanda’s arm before she could leave, leaning in to speak in a hushed whisper. “Could you keep Nicky for a little bit longer? I need to… you know-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I get it. Have fun fucking!” Wanda giggled, a little too loud and just enough that Rio caught the end of her sentence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She slipped out of the door to avoid the inevitable shove from her best friend, leaving Rio and Agatha to give each other an awkward laugh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples. “Look, I’m really sorry about last night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you sorry for?” Rio asked, head tilting in confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know… getting drunk and dragging you back here and trying to kiss you outside the hotel, and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t drag me back here.” She laughed. “And you shouldn’t apologise for any of that, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stared at her for a moment, taking her words in. </span>
  <em>
    <span>You shouldn’t apologise for any of that… any of it?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really.” Rio nodded, the amusement never leaving her face. “Who said I didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>want </span>
  </em>
  <span>you to kiss me last night?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. She swallowed nervously, swaying slightly on her feet, and she suddenly felt the need to cover herself up - still standing there in a ratty t-shirt and her underwear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look, why don’t you go upstairs and change into… more clothes, and we can go get breakfast somewhere?” Rio suggested, and Agatha’s breath hitched as she took a step closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where were you thinking?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know a spot.” She grinned, a hint of mischief sparkling in her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Trusting her judgement, Agatha did indeed change into a more appropriate outfit, and twenty minutes later she and Rio were pulling into the parking lot of a generic-looking cafe in downtown New Jersey. Thankfully, there </span>
  <em>
    <span>weren’t </span>
  </em>
  <span>any paparazzi crowding them as they stepped out of the car, and Rio had an air of nonchalance as she led Agatha inside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The interior was that of a usual coffee shop, although there was an overwhelming amount of plantlife and bookshelves in this particular cafe. Rio walked over to a booth that was nestled in between two bustling bookshelves, taking the seat across from Agatha and ordering them two coffees.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers tapped nervously against her thigh, contrasting with Rio’s casual demeanour as she leaned forward on her elbows. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m really sorry about last night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, just let me finish.” She interrupted, looking around before lowering her voice. “Honestly, I blacked out last night after we got into the car, and I shouldn’t’ve forced you to leave the party early-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha!” Rio caught her attention as she spiralled by reaching over and gently grabbing Agatha’s forearm. “You didn’t force me to do anything. I wasn’t about to let you get swooped up into a bombardment of photographers; I did the sensible thing by taking you home. And besides, the party was much less enjoyable without you there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A moment of silence fell over them, and Agatha opened her mouth to say something, </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything </span>
  </em>
  <span>in response, but was swiftly cut short by the waitress bringing over their drinks. Rio, unfortunately, let her forearm go and reached for her latte, smiling all the while at Agatha over the lid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She said nothing as Rio drank, reaching for her own coffee and scoffing as the realisation settled in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>They were flirting. Publicly.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>They were going to parties together.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And they were almost-kissing each other on the streets.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You look beautiful, you know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The statement caught her off guard, cup frozen mid-sip in front of her mouth, as Agatha watched Rio’s expression soften. She just looked at her, face free of any teasing or amusement, replaced by something akin to… familiarity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wrapped around Agatha’s heart like a warm hug. Tight and comforting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Shit.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha ha.” She scoffed, shaking her head and letting her walls go up in typical Agatha fashion. “I’m hungover, I haven’t brushed my hair, and this outfit was lying on the floor, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t change the fact that you look good, does it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does this kind of shameless flirting usually work out for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“God, always with the deflecting.” Rio rolled her eyes playfully, leaning back in her seat. “But yes. Yes, it usually does.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I find that hard to believe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mhm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then why are </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> still here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha narrowed her eyes at that. “Okay… touché.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you’re interested, then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I am.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, running her hands over her face and up into her hair. “Fuck, you’re sexy when you do that avoidant shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha could only laugh at that, gingerly sipping her coffee, only for her brow to furrow as Rio reached into her pocket, whipping out her phone. “What are you doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m taking a photo. Obviously.” She snickered to herself as she narrowed one eye, lining up her shot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, Rio, I look terrible-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bullshit.” Rio shook her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re the most gorgeous thing in here, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Try as she might, a fierce blush fought its way onto her cheeks, and Agatha attempted to hide the accompanying smile behind her cup. Rio grinned, clicking and letting the audible </span>
  <em>
    <span>snap </span>
  </em>
  <span>ring out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perfect.” She nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Show it to me, then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” Agatha let out a humorous scoff, reaching out to swipe the phone but failing as Rio pulled it back, the amusement returning to her face. “Rio, come on, show it to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll get to see it later. Maybe on our next date, who knows?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, this is a date, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d say so, yeah.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A buzz in her pocket drew Agatha’s attention away from Rio’s terrorising, if only for a moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>wanda: hey, nicky says he misses you :)</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That put a dampener on her mood, as she realised that simply avoiding telling him about hers and Rio’s… </span>
  <em>
    <span>situation</span>
  </em>
  <span> could only end badly. Despite his young age, Nicky was clever and good with his iPad, so he was going to find out that his own mother was hanging around with Rio Vidal one way or another.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha slipped her phone back into her pocket and finished up her drink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have to get home.” She gave Rio a half-sided smile, and she tried to ignore the tug on her heartstrings as Rio's face fell a little.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s alright. Let me drive you, at least.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took one last sip of her drink, dumping it into the trashcan nearby, and gestured for Agatha to walk ahead in that oh-so chivalrous manner of hers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They walked alongside each other in mirrored steps, and Agatha found herself glancing up at Rio curiously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Something about her - dressed so casually, the sun shining down on her, the flippant manner she had about speaking her mind, never backing down despite Agatha’s insistence; </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio was sensational in every aspect of the word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her heart raced in her chest as Rio turned to look at her, their eyes meeting as they reached the car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha couldn’t ignore it anymore. Her guard down, walls crumbled to pieces before Rio’s feet, all she wanted in that moment was her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was hesitant at first, toeing the line between risk and safety.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck safety.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her hands reached for Rio’s face and she surged forward, pulling her down into a kiss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And suddenly, </span>
  <b>everything</b>
  <span> felt like it had shifted into the right place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It took her a brief second to realise what was happening, but the moment she did, Rio's hands slid up to cup Agatha’s face and lean into it. They melted into each other, Agatha’s body pressing her into the side of the car in a delicious motion, and Rio almost whined as the kiss deepened. Intensity rushed through her body, a heated, fiery feeling filling her veins as she slipped her tongue into Agatha’s mouth, memorising the moan that left her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were completely caught up in one another, and Agatha was unsure of where she started and Rio ended. She couldn’t keep her hands still; roving across the small of Rio’s back and digging her nails into the skin of her waist. The feeling of her lips, her tongue, her breath, all coupled with the hands raking through her hair; Agatha could feel her senses become overwhelmed in the most pleasurable way possible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The kiss was only broken when the need for air outweighed the need for Rio to keep kissing Agatha, and she pulled away, their faces remaining close enough that their noses bumped slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She exhaled shakily, the hand around Agatha’s neck slipping down onto her shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt a strange laugh fill her chest, and she couldn’t contain it, her head falling forward onto Rio’s shoulder. They never let go of each other, still pressed together with Rio up against the side of her car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Holy shit.” Rio laughed too. “Where the </span>
  <em>
    <span>hell </span>
  </em>
  <span>have you been all my life?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“New Jersey, apparently.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pulled away from Rio’s shoulder and they eventually separated, once Agatha remembered why she’d wanted to leave in the first place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The drive home was lighter; Agatha meagrely fought to keep the lingering smile off her face, and she only glanced over at Rio when she slid a hand onto Agatha’s thigh affectionately. Her eyes were covered by the sunglasses, but Agatha could almost sense the mischievous look in them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once the car pulled up outside Agatha’s house, only then did Rio move her hand away. She pushed her sunglasses back up onto her head, meeting Agatha’s eye as she gave Rio a balanced look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So. I’ll text you an hour before the game starts tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’d better.” Rio nodded. “Wouldn’t want to let Nicky down, hm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what about me?” Agatha raised a brow quizzically.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I haven’t forgotten about you, gorgeous.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was thinking… would you want to come to the afterparty with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed dramatically, as a way of antagonising Rio the way she loved to antagonise Agatha. “Oh no, not another one of those-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, this one will be better, I promise. Or, at least, it’ll </span>
  <em>
    <span>end </span>
  </em>
  <span>better than the last one. Plus, I need you there to celebrate <strong>properly</strong>, or for comfort if we lose.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Impossible. But yeah, I’ll come with you.” She nodded, already planning to ask Wanda if she’d take Nicky home for that night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Jeez, that woman deserves a medal for the shit she does for me.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck yeah.” Rio pumped her fist dramatically.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Chuckling, Agatha unbuckled her belt and leaned back against the headrest for a moment. “See you tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can’t wait.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio flashed her another one of those unintentionally charming smiles, and Agatha couldn’t help but reach over the dashboard to kiss her one last time. It was shorter and more chaste than their last, but it filled her with excitement just as much, lingering even as she pulled back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped out of the car and walked up onto her front porch, glancing back at Rio as she drove away with effortless nonchalance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She walked back into her house and pressed back against the door once it’d shut, and Agatha covered her mouth, almost in disbelief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Holy shit.” She whispered, to no-one but herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Holy shit, indeed.</span>
  </em>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>“Are you excited, baby?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky could barely contain his excitement enough to nod, bouncing in his seat as he looked wildly out the window.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mhm. I can’t wait to tell the team about how I kicked Vision’s butt using their moves! Oh, and that I’ve kept the ball that Rio gave me safe. So she doesn’t worry or anything!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha just smiled, a breathy exhale out of her nose, as they drove into the stadium’s parking lot. She’d shot Rio a text that they’d be getting there soon about ten minutes before, so the security stationed at the doors were ready for her and Nicky as they approached.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha and Nicholas?” A woman with a professional-looking lanyard asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Welcome. The team is very excited to meet you, young man.” She motioned to Nicky, leading them past the security team and into a side entrance with a branded </span>
  <em>
    <span>Staff Only </span>
  </em>
  <span>sign on the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky became even more restless than he had been in the front seat, tugging Agatha forward as he kept in step with the woman in the lanyard, who’d introduced herself as Lilia.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I love the jersey, Nicky.” Lilia smiled, her inflection being that of genuine friendliness. “I’m sure they’re gonna love it, too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Rio said she liked it the last time I saw her!” He grinned. “The ball almost hit me in the face, but I caught it before it could.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh right, you’re the boy from that video. Well done, that was a good save!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cringed at the thought of this stranger having watched the video; it meant she’d </span>
  <em>
    <span>also </span>
  </em>
  <span>seen Agatha practically drooling at the sight of Rio - a feat which she was admittedly embarrassed about. She knew there were probably thousands of other women who did the same, but to be caught on camera, doing it right in front of her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yeah, embarrassing is certainly one word for it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t have time to mull that over, however, since Lilia had led them straight onto the empty court, gesturing at the space around them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Here we are!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The team were already getting in some last minute practice on the court, and though it wasn’t all of the players, Agatha could already see Rio, Alice and Jen amongst them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Guys, this is Nicky and Agatha. Nicky here is your number one fan!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They all gave him a wave as he dropped Agatha’s hand and ran over to the team, jumping up and down as he waved back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi! I know all of your moves, and you guys are really cool, and I know you’re gonna win this game, I bet five bucks that you would, and I always win bets!” He rambled on, all of the built-up energy from the anticipation of meeting his favourite team spilling out at once.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s awesome, Nicky.” Alice grinned, kneeling down to high-five him. Jen gave him a fist-bump, listening to him list off a bunch of their techniques and the ones he deemed ‘the coolest’, and Agatha simply watched from afar, a pleased smile on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She glanced over at Rio, standing there in her uniform, and an untimely blush filled her cheeks as the memories of yesterday morning flooded her mind. They only looked at each other for a moment, but it could’ve lasted a lifetime and Agatha wouldn’t’ve noticed, too caught up in just how </span>
  <em>
    <span>good </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio looked in that uniform.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio finally looked away to greet Nicky properly, </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and kneeling down to his level along with Alice and Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, little man.” She gestured up at his forehead. “How’s the head?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You remember me?” Nicky’s smile couldn’t be wider as Rio nodded. “It’s fine, I caught the ball before it could hit me, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, of course. I forgot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I made sure the ball is safe in my room, by the way. Now it can’t hit any other kids in the head!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That got a chuckle out of Rio, and she turned towards the court where some of the players were warming up, passing and dribbling amongst themselves.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you think about joining us for our warm ups? I bet, if you and I teamed up, we could totally beat Alice and Jen in a round.” She suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Totally, let’s do it!” Nicky yelled excitedly, gesturing to his jersey. “If I win, can my Mom get a jersey too?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha coughed at the sudden mention of her name, and she stepped forward to protest. “Oh, that’s alright, you don’t have to-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Deal.” Rio said before she could finish, giving Agatha a look laden with mischief, before taking Nicky’s hand and running with him towards the far end of the court to start up their little game.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched them from afar, taking a seat next to the court at one of the folding chairs. Rio and Alice flipped a coin for the ball, and it went straight to Rio, who dribbled for a few seconds before passing it over to Nicky. He jumped and took the shot, where it bounced off the corner box and dropped straight through the net.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes!” Nicky cried out, a big smile painted on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their mini-game went on for a few more minutes - Alice and Jen were purposefully slow, because who would try and </span>
  <em>
    <span>actually </span>
  </em>
  <span>beat a seven-year-old in a game of basketball?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At some point, Rio’s corner shot led to the ball getting wedged and stuck between the net and the backboard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh no…” Nicky sounded dejected, as though he was expecting it all to be over after that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, you think you’d be able to get it out, Nicky?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No way, I’m not tall enough!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What if I put you on my shoulders?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He nodded enthusiastically, and Agatha smiled as she watched Rio kneel down to let him climb up. She kept him securely on her shoulders as he reached up to grab the ball, struggling for a second before it eased up, and they cheered triumphantly as he held it above his head in victory.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I got it, I got it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed as she let him down, giving him a double-handed high five before he ran over to Agatha in a fit of laughter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mama, Mama, did you see that? I scored a bunch of times, and me and Rio were awesome, and we beat Alice and Jen!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was amazing, Nicky.” She laughed, reaching for his face and pressing a few kisses to his forehead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re the best, Mama!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed contently, running her fingers through the messy hair at the front of Nicky’s face, before the team called him over again to try shooting three-pointers. He ran over without a moment’s hesitation, and Agatha would’ve been fine to watch from afar again, until Rio walked over and stopped a few feet away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey there, stranger.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She grinned, and Agatha couldn’t help but stand up to meet Rio’s height. Even then, Rio managed to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>just </span>
  </em>
  <span>taller than her, glancing down at Agatha with watchful eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Could I offer you…” Rio trailed off, subtly slipping her hand into Agatha’s, out of view of everyone else. “A tour of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>very lovely</span>
  </em>
  <span> changing rooms that I often hole up in?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” Agatha nodded, trying her best not to laugh out loud at Rio’s ridiculous attempt to be subtle. “Lead the way, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she did - taking Agatha through a set of double doors, down a bright hallway, until they reached a door with the Salemites’ logo slotted into the card-tray. This was an away game, after all, and so these changing rooms weren’t the permanent ones that Agatha saw in the background of her Instagram photos, when she may or may not have been scrolling through Rio’s feed at 3AM…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The space inside was huge, an entire wall lined with lockers and accompanying mirrors. The lights weren’t on inside just yet, and Rio continued walking until they reached the individual shower rooms, all hidden by half-walls.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>When in Rome…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha seized the opportunity laid out in front of her, tugging Rio into one of the shower rooms by the hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She cut Rio off by pressing her into the wall, slipping her hands up around Rio’s neck and pulling her down for a kiss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio made a surprised noise before quickly sinking into it, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s waist and allowing her hands to settle just above her ass. She moaned into Rio’s mouth, feeling herself grow wetter at an embarrassingly quick rate as Rio ran her tongue along Agatha’s bottom lip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They stayed like that for a while, bodies moving against each other in a deliciously hot rhythm, until Agatha pulled away to suck in a breath before she inevitably passed out from oxygen deprivation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed with relief, a chuckle escaping her throat. “I missed you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s been less than 24 hours.” Agatha laughed, snorting a little.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I love your laugh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t.” Agatha shook her head, frowning. “I hate it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m serious. It’s endearing, and you look cute when your smile gets all big and shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t you make me?” Rio challenged, tilting her head, letting their noses brush as Agatha smiled at that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She leaned in to press her lips to Rio’s again, but the sound of a door opening caused them to wrench apart - Rio slipped out from beneath Agatha’s grip, swiftly exiting the shower room and acting as casual as she could muster.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So yeah, nothing fancy in here.” She nodded, and Agatha saw that it’d been Alice who walked in. “Oh, hey, Alice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi, you two.” Alice raised a brow, a knowing, shit-eating grin on her face. “Nicky’s a blast, Agatha. I’m glad I got to meet him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s a little shit, is what he is.” She chuckled, glancing over in the direction from where they’d come. “Thank you for doing this. He really loves you guys.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was no trouble.” Rio smiled, leaning back against one of the lockers, which Agatha presumed was her own.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. Plus, it gave Rio an excuse to see you again.” Alice said, snickering, much to her best friend’s look of betrayal. “Seriously, she wouldn’t stop talking about-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You dick, shut up!” Rio scoffed, shoving Alice’s shoulder to get her to be quiet, all the while Agatha laughed with pure amusement at this revelation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were talking about me to your friends?” She said with unencumbered glee.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, take it easy.” Rio rolled her eyes, just as a few more players started filing into the locker room. “Oh, I forgot-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned around to open her locker, rooting around for a minute before pulling out a fresh jersey and holding it out for Agatha to take.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nicky and I won the bet. You get a jersey too, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed with amusement, but she did in fact take it, holding it over her arm. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Game’s starting soon, we need to get ready.” Jen mentioned, walking over to her locker beside Alice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll go get Nicky, I need to find Wanda and Vision.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They friends of yours?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. You met Wanda yesterday, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, </span>
  <em>
    <span>that’s </span>
  </em>
  <span>Wanda. I was hungover, so.” Rio shrugged, and Agatha couldn’t help but laugh at that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She reached over, cupping Rio’s cheek and pressing a soft kiss to it. “I’ll see you out there. Good luck.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to cover up the obvious blush that arose on her face, smiling as Agatha pretended not to notice it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She gave Alice and Jen a small wave goodbye before leaving, briefly hearing Alice start to laugh and tease Rio, to head back onto the court. Nicky was waiting with Lilia, and he grabbed ahold of Agatha’s hand when she finally reached them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mama, when are Wanda and Vision getting here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’ll be here soon, sweetheart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>⚢</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Safe to say, Wanda and Vision did turn up around ten minutes later, and they were allowed onto the court a little earlier than everyone else, thanks to Lilia’s intervention.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As per usual, Nicky opted to sit next to his mother and Vision, while Agatha had Wanda sit beside her in the other seat. The stadium started to fill as Wanda nudged her arm, gesturing down at the jersey Agatha had half-heartedly stuffed into her bag.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, what’ve you got there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” She reached in and pulled it out, and Wanda’s eyes couldn’t’ve grown wider at the sight. “A gift from Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She </span>
  <em>
    <span>gave </span>
  </em>
  <span>you her jersey?!” When Agatha simply nodded at that, Wanda reached over and shook her shoulders. “Why the hell aren’t you wearing it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t think I needed to, jeez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you genuinely crazy, woman? If a star athlete gifts you a part of their uniform just before a game starts, you wear the fucking uniform, psycho!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you love it so much, why don’t you wear it then?” Agatha said, raising her hands defensively.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wanda glanced over at Nicky, seeing that he was preoccupied with telling Vision all about the game he’d played earlier with Rio. She lowered her voice as she said, “Idiot, I’m not the one dating the athlete!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We are not dating.” Agatha whispered back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, you definitely are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, we’re… it’s- you-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>dating, don’t lie to me. I’ve been your best friend for nearly fifteen years, I can tell when you lie, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh my God, you’re infuriating.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, and you </span>
  <em>
    <span>love </span>
  </em>
  <span>me for it!” Wanda grinned, giving Agatha her best look of innocence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The announcer started up, and before they knew it, the game was starting. The opposition came out first, taking their places on the court and strategizing with their manager, quickly followed by the Salemites. The crowd erupted into cheers, with all four of them sitting courtside joining in. Nicky’s smile couldn’t’ve been bigger as he cheered, and Rio eventually caught up to where they were sitting and smiled back, giving him and Agatha a wave.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It took a couple minutes before the coin was flipped, luckily guessed right by the Salemites’ point guard, and Agatha watched closely as Rio took her position, her demeanour a mask of being calm and collected. She was psyching the other players out; letting them know she wasn’t scared of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hot.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The ref’s whistle rang out, signalling the start of the game, and they were off in a flurry of motion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their point guard only dribbled for a second before passing it straight over to Alice, who led it down the court towards the net, accompanied by Rio following in her footsteps from the other side of the floor. She stopped just outside the inner circle, faking out a pass to Jen before throwing it overhead to Rio, who caught it as she leapt up just behind an opposing player. She twisted herself around them and their attempts to divert her, dribbling down towards the corner before grabbing the ball in both hands and shooting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unsurprisingly, it fell straight through the net, scoring their first shot of the game. Rio couldn’t hide the smile on her face as Alice shook her shoulders excitedly, running in sync together to the back of the crowd of players.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched in complete awe, unaware of her best friend beside her who laughed light-heartedly at the look on Agatha’s face. She followed Rio all the way until it all started up again, finding it hard to tear her gaze away from her for the rest of the game.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were nearing the end now, with the Salemites’ score sitting at a nerve-wracking 54-54 tie with the opposition.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked strategic and sweaty as she dipped up and down the court, using the advantage of her quick feet to psych one of the players out and have them let their guard down enough that she swiped the ball mid-dribble. She tore down towards the net, passing it over to Jen and letting her take the shot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It bounced off the backboard and unfortunately rolled off the rim of the net, almost falling down into the hands of a rival player. But Alice was quick to intercept, hitting the ball out of their reach and across the court, where Rio managed to jump out in front of two rival players and steal the ball.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Four seconds left!” Vision cried out, with Nicky yelling incoherently beside him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now, shoot now!” Wanda nearly screamed, caught up in the energy of the game.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched with nerves wracking her body, and Rio eventually took the shot from the three-point spot. The stadium went quieter as everyone watched the ball - until it fell straight into the net, right at the buzzer, and the court exploded into yells and cheers of victory.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Salemites’ all rushed to crowd Rio, drowning her in shakes and hugs. Alice nearly took her down with the force of throwing her arms around her, jumping up and down in the crowd, and Wanda was excitedly clapping as she tugged on Agatha’s arm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nicky and Vision were practically whooping with glee, double high-fiving each other as the voice over the jumbotron announced the Salemites’ victory in the league.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mama, Mama, they won!” Nicky cried out with a laugh, looking up at his mom. “I told you they’d win!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know, baby, I know!” Agatha nodded, grabbing his face and pressing a kiss to his forehead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tommy owes me five bucks!” He said with a look of utter triumph on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned back to where the team had converged, and in the crowd Agatha managed to meet Rio’s gaze. She grinned like a kid in a candy store, slipping through her teammates and catching all three of the adults sitting courtside off-guard when she walked straight up to them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled Agatha into a crushing hug, much to the chagrin of Wanda and Vision beside her. In a moment of pure euphoric excitement, Rio picked her up and spun them around in a move that made Agatha laugh aloud.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You did so good, Rio.” She said into Rio’s shoulder, pressed into the side of her neck for a second, before pulling back to look her in the eye. “I’m so proud of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Realising the absolutely cheesy grin still on her face, Rio let Agatha down and instead kept ahold of her arms as they looked at each other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Guess we’re celebrating tonight, then?” She asked, raising a brow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Definitely.” Agatha nodded, and Wanda reached over to congratulate Rio, letting their hands drop from each other as Vision nudged Agatha, a knowing look on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then, Rio turned to Nicky with an even bigger smile, breathless as he reached up to give her a high-five.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was awesome, Rio! You guys won!” He cried out, much to Rio’s amusement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, bud! All that practice we did earlier really paid off, hm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Totally!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilia started waving Rio over, to take post-game photographs and do the inevitable TV interview, and she turned back to Agatha to lean in and hug her one last time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have a driver take us to the hotel after this, okay? Alice is throwing the afterparty there. Wait for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She nodded, letting Rio give them all one last goodbye before running off to cater to the press.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>⚢</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sky outside was dark by the time they’d gotten out, and Wanda smiled up at Nicky through the rearview mirror as Vision drove them home.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you have a good time tonight, Nicky?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was so awesome, Wanda!” He grinned back. “Rio is so cool. We played a round with Alice and Jen before the game started, and we totally killed those guys on the court. And I won a jersey for Mama to keep!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s good, bud. I’m glad you had fun.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He fell silent, and Wanda turned her attention back down to her phone. A notification popped up at the top of her screen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>@PopBase</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Rio Vidal seen hugging fan after scoring the winning shot of tonight’s finals game, securing the Salemites’ 57-54 win. </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The video pictured below was of the jumbotron after Rio’s winning shot - it followed her as she slipped past her teammates, and ran straight up to where the four of them had been sitting courtside. It showed a clear view of her wrapping Agatha up in a tight hug and lifting her up, and Wanda covered her mouth to stifle a laugh as she watched it from a different perspective than her own.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha could be seen whispering something to Rio, then pulling away to look down at her with the most adoring look on her face - something Wanda had only ever seen her give to Nicky before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shrugging, Wanda opted to scroll down and look at the replies.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p dir="ltr">The afterparty was electric - a celebration filled to the brim with the rich and famous, who danced and drank to the obnoxiously loud music playing over the speakers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept her hand in Agatha's as they entered the room, fingers laced together, and nearly everyone turned to Rio with a cheer as the door closed behind them.</p><p> </p><p>From the crowd, Rio grinned as she spotted Alice approaching, bumping past different people to get to them.</p><p> </p><p>"Give it up for the motherfucker who scored the winning shot!" She yelled, though it was partially drowned out by the sheer volume of the music filling the room.</p><p> </p><p>"So fuckin' proud of you, man." Alice continued, and she held out two solo cups to Rio and Agatha with a smirk. "Don't worry, this time it's just vodka and red bull. I swear."</p><p> </p><p>Nodding, Rio threw back the cup with a wince. Agatha followed in step, though she took slower sips before finishing it; all the while, she allowed herself to be led through the sea of bodies towards the kitchen area.</p><p> </p><p>It was almost nostalgic to the party they'd thrown mere days before; flashing lights, a magnetic air in the room, expensive drinks laid out all across the countertops. Rio took the liberty of grabbing them two fresh cups, mulling over what to mix as Agatha slid herself up onto the counter next to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>"What are we thinking?" Rio thought aloud, brandishing a bottle of spiced rum.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a small laugh, a simple breath through her nose. "Go for it."</p><p> </p><p>She poured the double shots into the cup, mixing in a healthy dose of diet coke that was perched in the sink filled with ice - Agatha couldn't help but raise a brow at the absurdity of it.</p><p> </p><p>"I've never been to a party where the sink was full of ice to keep drinks cold." She pondered. "That's a new one for me."</p><p> </p><p>"Alice probably would've used the refrigerator, were it not for the fact that we may or may not have broken it during the last party." Rio snickered to herself as she spoke.</p><p> </p><p>"What? How?"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't ask me, I was preoccupied!" Agatha smiled, watching Rio's look change into that of amusement.</p><p> </p><p>She took the drink from Rio’s hand, placing it onto the counter beside her, before reaching out and grabbing ahold of Rio's button-up by the collar. She dragged her into the space between Agatha's legs, and Rio didn't hesitate to make a bold move; sliding her hands around Agatha's waist in a motion that, admittedly, sent a shiver down her spine.</p><p> </p><p>"I've got an idea." Rio whispered, in a tone that gave Agatha pause.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh no..."</p><p> </p><p>"Ever done body shots?"</p><p> </p><p>"Body shots, huh?" Agatha's voice was smooth now, almost purr-like as she grinned at the idea. Her legs shifted slightly on the counter. "You sure move fast, Vidal."</p><p> </p><p>"Anything to get my mouth on a pretty lady." She adds in a wink, her grip tightening on the small of Agatha's back.</p><p> </p><p>The music from the rest of the party turned faint as the moment dragged on. Agatha tilted her head, looking Rio up and down as if she were assessing her next move.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright." She nodded, her voice lower now. "Let's make this interesting."</p><p> </p><p>"Interesting?"</p><p> </p><p>"No touching me until it's your turn." Agatha said, gently prying Rio's hands off her waist to put some space between them. "If you can manage that, I’ll let you drag me onto that dance floor.”</p><p> </p><p>"Alright, Harkness. You're on."</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed a lime slice sitting in a bowl atop the ice-sink, holding it up between two fingers. "Hold this."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her touch slow and deliberate as she slipped the wedge between Rio's lips, never breaking their eye contact as her other hand reached for the salt shaker.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's fingers twitched at her sides, aching to touch Agatha, but the prospect of losing her chance to dance with her was too much of a risk. She kept them still as Agatha sprinkled a light dusting of salt along the curve of Rio’s collarbone, her breath warm against Rio’s skin as she leaned in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a point of dragging her tongue along the line of salt slowly, lingering for just a little too long to be deemed innocent, and Rio felt like her body was practically humming with tension. With the lime still perched between her lips, Rio let out the faintest of breaths, a mixture of a sound between a laugh and a gasp.</p><p> </p><p>She finally pulled back, just enough to be able to reach for the tequila sitting amongst the pile of drinks. Not bothering to search for a shot glass, Agatha held it up in a toast-like motion before downing a shot’s-worth of the alcohol.</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t speak with the lime still in her mouth, but the look in her eyes spoke volumes – locked on Agatha’s as she leaned in, letting their lips brush teasingly as she took the wedge from between her lips. Then, Agatha pulled away and bit into the citrus, a dribble of its juice falling down her chin.</p><p> </p><p>“You kept your hands to yourself. Good girl.” Agatha nodded, wiping it away with a brush of her thumb.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha noticed the slight shiver that ran through Rio’s body at the pet name, then she’d done a good job of pretending not to.</p><p> </p><p>Satisfied that her ‘punishment’ was over, Rio took the opportunity to finally get her hands back on Agatha, slotting them right back around her waist and letting her fingers press into her hips.</p><p> </p><p>“My turn.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, Rio did something that caught Agatha completely off-guard. Urging her hips forward to the edge of the counter, then pushing her down to lay back slightly, not all the way but just enough that Agatha had to lean back on her elbows.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let one hand reach over to pick up the salt shaker, while she used the other to gently tug at the hem of Agatha’s shirt, dragging it up just enough to reveal a sliver of her stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t protest; in fact, she thought she’d rather die than stop Rio in that moment. Her teeth sunk into her bottom lip as she watched Rio work, eyes following her fingers as she leaned forward to sprinkle a line of salt above her navel.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed back the dryness in her throat. “Undressing me already?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned up at her, reaching for another lime wedge and holding it up to Agatha’s mouth. “Open.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha obeyed; holding it between her teeth as Rio took it a step further and began to pour the tequila above the salt, letting it run down Agatha’s stomach. She quickly moved down to lick it up, her tongue warm against the coolness of the liquid, and it felt like a flame beneath Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like the moment stretched on for hours; Agatha savoured the feeling of Rio’s tongue against her stomach, and she entertained the lingering thoughts of her tongue touching Agatha somewhere else, if only for a second.</p><p> </p><p>Unbeknownst to them, their actions didn’t go unnoticed. From across the room, sitting on the hotel’s ridiculously large sofas while they passed a joint around, Alice nudged Jen to look over to the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit, Jen, look!”</p><p> </p><p>They both watched Rio’s movements, the way she held Agatha close whilst dragging her tongue up along her stomach, and Alice couldn’t hide the laughter bubbling up in her chest - amusement at the situation, but mostly because of the weed in her system.</p><p> </p><p>“Do they know they’re in a room full of, like, a hundred people?” Jen scoffed, taking a hit from the joint.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, I’m not really sure.” Alice shrugged, stretching her legs out against the sofa. “Fuck it. Let them have their fun, it’s a party!”</p><p> </p><p>She held her hands up to the sky, almost victoriously. “We fuckin’ won the finals!”</p><p> </p><p>Jen nodded with a grin, grabbing her cup and clinking it nonchalantly against Alice’s. “Damn straight.”</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally lapped up the last drop, she finished with a flourish, letting Agatha’s shirt fall back down to cover her stomach as she swallowed. Then, she guided Agatha to sit up again, before craning up to her lips and claiming the lime for herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t make a move to pull back, simply biting into it as their noses brushed from the close proximity, removing the skin from her mouth and carelessly dropping it onto the counter.</p><p> </p><p>“Well?” She said, breaking the tense silence between them. “Aren’t we gonna dance, my lady?”</p><p> </p><p>The formality got a laugh out of Agatha, who nodded and took Rio’s outstretched hand. She let herself be pulled into the living room, where the crowd of dancing bodies was thick and the pulse of the music bordered on deafening.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned to look over her shoulder at Agatha, slipping between people until they found a space towards the centre, slotting themselves in and finding a rhythm.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped closer to Rio, close enough that the space between them disappeared almost entirely, letting her hands drift down to Rio’s hips. Taking over from Rio’s earlier position, she now guided her hips to move them in sync with one another.</p><p> </p><p>It started innocently enough, as innocent as dancing to club music could’ve been, but the tension grew thicker and the space between them got impossibly smaller. Agatha spun around slowly, pressing her back against Rio’s chest and revelling in the feeling of Rio’s hands running up her waist.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her head fall back onto Rio’s shoulder, and Rio couldn’t hide the desire dripping from her gaze - the flashing lights in the room cast over her face, painting it red, then blue, then green. She could feel the rise and fall of Agatha’s breath against her ear, and she tightened her grip on Agatha’s waist to spin her around again.</p><p> </p><p>The boots Rio had thrown on post-game left her an inch or two taller than Agatha, and she looked down at her, adoration mixed deliciously with desire filling her chest.</p><p> </p><p>She raised a hand up to the back of Agatha’s neck, her fingers raking through the baby hairs there, and Agatha followed by lifting her own up to Rio’s jawline, tracing her fingers along it.</p><p> </p><p>“Kiss me.” Agatha whispered, nearly drowned out by the music, but their closeness left just enough for Rio to hear.</p><p> </p><p>“In front of all these people? Scandalous.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t want to kiss me, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t say that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio ran her tongue up along her teeth, and Agatha reached up slowly, their lips a breath apart.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me to stop.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not stopping you.”</p><p> </p><p>And that’s all Agatha needed.</p><p> </p><p>Without a moment’s hesitation, she leaned in and closed the gap, her lips finding Rio’s in a kiss that was tentative and soft. It soon deepened as the tension that’d plagued their night finally evaporated, gone like the space between them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed into the kiss, her hands tangling in Agatha’s hair and pulling her closer. She sighed against her lips, letting her mouth open and allowing Agatha to slide her tongue into her mouth. It was invigorating, the absolute heat of it all - the dancing, the body shots, the thrill of winning the game earlier.</p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled away suddenly, grabbing ahold of one of Rio’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Where’s your room?”</p><p> </p><p>At that, Rio just smiled and said nothing, turning to drag Agatha out of the crowd. They passed by Alice and Jen on the sofa, who said nothing and simply raised their drinks in Agatha’s direction, and she gave them an offhanded goodbye before Rio led them out into the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>She continued down the gradually-emptying hallway until they reached the elevator, and Rio was restless as they waited for it, practically bouncing on one foot.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, the doors dinged open and they stepped inside together. Rio hit the button for her floor before turning to face Agatha, who was already closing the gap between them.</p><p> </p><p>The elevator started moving upwards, but Rio barely took notice of it as Agatha tugged at her collar, their mouths connected in a kiss that felt hotter than anything they’d shared on the dance floor. Perhaps it was the clarity that intensified the kiss, having stepped away from the dark, cramped space inside the suite, but it didn’t matter - Rio’s back hit the wall as Agatha pressed against her, their bodies fitting together like a puzzle piece.</p><p> </p><p>“You sure we’re even gonna make it to my room?” Rio murmured between kisses, her hands sliding around Agatha’s waist.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe we don’t need to.” Agatha whispered back, her voice laced with a teasing manner.</p><p> </p><p>Just as Rio was about to respond, the elevator jolted and came to an abrupt halt. The sudden stop sent Agatha stumbling, clutching at Rio for balance as the overhead light flickered.</p><p> </p><p>“What the–” She started.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked around, her brow furrowed. “Did the elevator just… stop?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached over to push the button for Rio’s floor again, then the emergency button, but nothing happened. She let out a frustrated groan. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course this would happen.” Rio just laughed, running her hands over her face with a sigh. “The universe can’t let us have anything easy, can it?”</p><p> </p><p>“At least we’re in good company.” Agatha snorted, tilting her head at Rio and reaching out to run her hands up Rio’s stomach.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re right.” She nodded, leaning in and stopping a breath away from Agatha’s lips. “We’ve got time to kill, might as well make the most of it.”</p><p> </p><p>Neither of them needed any more convincing. Agatha leaned in and closed the distance in another kiss, the intensity of it building quickly as her hands greedily indulged the feeling of Rio’s tight abdominal muscles. Rio took her own fill, sliding her hands down from Agatha’s waist and gripping her ass, anchoring them together.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you an ass girl, by any chance, Rio?” Agatha said against her lips, her voice lower than ever.</p><p> </p><p>“How could you tell?” She grinned, pulling back just enough to meet Agatha’s eye. “God, yours is perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t argue with that. She responded in kind by pulling Rio back into the kiss, sliding her tongue along her bottom lip, when a sudden, crackling voice came through the elevator’s intercom.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, folks, we’re aware of the issue. Just a minor technical fault, it should be in working order now.”</p><p> </p><p>The elevator buzzed back to life, beginning its ascent once again. Rio burst out laughing, burying her face in Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>She sighed dramatically, though a grin tugged at her lips. “Can’t a girl make out with her date in peace?”</p><p> </p><p>“Patience, baby.” Rio smirked, her voice still tinged with amusement as the elevator slowed to a stop.</p><p> </p><p>The doors slid open, finally, to reveal a much quieter, emptier hallway than the one hosting the afterparty. Rio wasted no time, grabbing Agatha’s hand and pulling her out of the elevator with an unfaltering grin. She followed, laughing as they stumbled their way over to Rio’s hotel room, still riding the adrenaline of their kiss - both in the elevator and on the dance floor.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shoved the door open carelessly, spinning around to grab Agatha by the waist. “This peaceful enough for you?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fucking perfect by all accounts.” Agatha groaned, allowing herself to be tugged inside, and kicking the door shut behind them.</p><p> </p><p>The room was dimly lit, the city skyline glittering through the floor-to-ceiling windows, but neither of them paid much attention to the view. Rio didn’t even bother reaching over to turn on the lights, instead busying herself with pressing Agatha into the nearest countertop and lifting her effortlessly up onto the cool granite surface.</p><p> </p><p>“About time we didn’t get interrupted.” Rio murmured, before surging forward and capturing Agatha’s lips in a fast, messy kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Her hands were already in Rio’s hair, pulling her closer as she slipped her tongue into Agatha’s mouth. The tension from their entire night together was spilling out with every touch and grab - Rio’s fingers skimmed along Agatha’s thighs, gripping just enough to steady her as their bodies melted together.</p><p> </p><p>Then, Rio caught Agatha by surprise and lifted her up once again. Agatha instinctively wrapped her legs around Rio, her hands gripping those strong shoulders as she moaned against her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>, it’s sexy when you do that.” She sighed, pulling her into another kiss as Rio walked them into the bedroom and over to the king-sized bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait ‘til I get your pants off, that’ll be <em>really</em> sexy.” Rio responded, dropping Agatha onto the foot of the bed and reaching down to pull off her own shirt.</p><p> </p><p>That got an appreciative groan out of Agatha’s mouth, her eyes scanning up the muscles of Rio’s stomach. She dragged her hands up it and over Rio’s bra, squeezing softly.</p><p> </p><p>“You know…” Agatha murmured, her voice low and intimate. “Watching you play today… you were unreal. You <em>owned</em> that winning shot, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed at that, her hands coming up to trail along Agatha’s cheekbones. “You sound like one of those people on my Twitter. Should I be worried you’re a closet fan account?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked, tightening her grip on Rio’s hips and pulling her hard so that she fell forward, resting on both hands at either side of Agatha’s head. “I’m definitely not. Although, I have to agree with them…”</p><p> </p><p>She punctuated her sentence by grinding her hips up into Rio’s front. “You looked insanely good out there on the court, and I want nothing more than for you to<em> fuck me into this mattress.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk faltered, replaced by an overt look of lust.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you do that for me, baby?” Agatha pouted, her eyes pleading (insincerely) with Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me what to do.” She whispered back, nodding slowly as her gaze drifted down to Agatha’s parted lips.</p><p> </p><p>“You can do whatever you want to me sweetheart… just, <em>please fuck me</em>, or I swear I’m gonna explode.”</p><p> </p><p>It only took those words for Rio to nod and lean back in, her tongue lashing out and entangling with Agatha’s as she tore off her clothes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio broke it only to kiss down her jawline, all the way to the juncture of her throat, and she internally brightened at the idea that entered her mind. She bit at the skin of Agatha’s pulse point and soothed over it with a suckle, her tongue warm against the spot until she was satisfied and pulled back.</p><p> </p><p>As expected, a dark, reddish mark had begun blooming on Agatha’s throat.</p><p> </p><p>“You dick.” Agatha laughed at her, slapping Rio’s arm playfully as she stripped Agatha of her shirt. “You’ve been wanting to do that all night, haven’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Guilty.” Rio shrugged, a pleased smirk on her face.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha was only left in her bra and panties, Rio started to press kisses down her body - down her neck, licking over her collarbone and the newer marks she’d left behind, and reaching up to pull down Agatha’s bra, letting her tits free.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, followed by a deep moan as Rio ran her tongue along an exposed nipple, sucking experimentally as her hand squeezed the other.</p><p> </p><p>“Shit, yeah, that feels good…” She breathed out, letting her fingers snake their way into Rio’s hair and tugging at it gently.</p><p> </p><p>“Your body is so beautiful, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>The comment just slipped out of Rio’s mouth, influenced by the brutal mixture of alcohol and arousal. Her eyes roved down Agatha’s body as she spoke, gazing over the flushed skin of her chest, the smooth expanse of her stomach, down toward her trembling thighs. Rio slipped a hand around the underside of one of them, her teeth sunken into her bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p>“I…” Agatha stammered for a response, letting out a nervous laugh. “I’m not- I mean, you don’t… don’t have to say that-”</p><p> </p><p>“I wanted to.” Rio interrupted, quelling her thoughts with a shake of her head. “<em>Fuck</em>, you turn me on.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t leave Agatha any room for a response, craning her neck up to pull Agatha in for another kiss. Rio let her unoccupied hand slide up to the waistband of her panties, hooking her fingers into it and pulling back to check if it was okay to take them off.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t reply verbally, just nodded her head in an enthusiastic manner and buried her face into the side of Rio’s neck. She tugged the fabric down Agatha’s legs, throwing them onto the floor unceremoniously. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t waste any time after that, slotting herself into a knelt position between Agatha’s legs and dragging her thigh up onto Rio’s shoulder, leaving teasing, agonisingly slow kisses up along the inner flesh of it.</p><p> </p><p>She felt Agatha’s hips jump up at the contact, squirming in place as she stared down at Rio, her brows downturned as if she were holding something back.</p><p> </p><p>The air in the room felt hot and heavy, not to sound cliche. Agatha’s body was practically simmering with anticipation, her eyes tracking every move of Rio’s mouth, every squeeze of her fingers around Agatha’s thigh, every brush of her nose against-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Oh, fuck.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head downwards, running her tongue up along the entirety of Agatha’s cunt. The motion dragged an ungodly, almost pornographic moan out of Agatha’s throat, her back bowing against the bed and her hips twitching against Rio’s face, desperate for more.</p><p> </p><p>She slid her fingers around a fistful of Rio’s hair, twisting it up into a makeshift ponytail to keep it out of her face.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio failed to notice it, too caught up in the taste of Agatha to consider anything getting in her way. She groaned against Agatha’s wetness, the vibrations of it sending a spark of pleasure through her lower stomach, and lapped it up like a starved dog.</p><p> </p><p>Her grip on Agatha’s thigh tightened, nails digging in hard enough to leave a mark, and Rio mouthed up to give a slow lick over her pulsing clit. When Agatha whined above her, a high-pitched little noise, she repeated the action and closed her lips around it, sucking on the bundle of nerves and simultaneously laving over it with her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>“God, j-just like <em>that</em>, yes-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cut herself off with an involuntary groan, the hand not in Rio’s hair white-knuckling the sheets beneath them.</p><p> </p><p>She spared a glance down the bed, and Agatha could feel her arousal simply worsen at the sight of Rio’s head working between her legs. She felt her body reaching the edge of bliss embarrassingly quickly; every flick of Rio’s tongue was like an electric shock passing through her body, and the pain of Rio’s nails digging into her thigh only heightened the pleasure of it all.</p><p> </p><p>The bed creaked beneath Agatha’s chasing hips, and with the rate of moans and groans slipping out of Agatha’s mouth, she was sure their neighbours next door were getting an earful of what they were doing. But, unlike her rational self, Agatha found that she didn’t care - someone could’ve walked straight into that hotel room, and she probably wouldn’t’ve bothered attempting to cover her bare self, or the fact that the Rio Vidal was eating her out like her life depended on it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled against Agatha’s cunt as her hips started to move erratically; a tell-tale sign that she was getting close. She doubled down on her movements, sucking on Agatha’s clit as hard as she’d done whilst leaving hickies all over her neck, and Rio felt the thigh on her shoulder start to close in around her head.</p><p> </p><p>“F-Fuck, Rio… I-I’m close, baby. Keep going, <em>don’t stop.</em>” Agatha moaned, her words broken up by short, staccato intakes of breath.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, taking her words in stride, moved her hand around and suddenly plunged two fingers inside of Agatha, her soaking entrance leaving no resistance to the intrusion. Agatha nearly folded in on herself as her body shot up from the bed, hips slamming up against Rio’s face as she yelled out in pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>Her head tipped back as Rio thrust her fingers at an insane pace, her mouth frantic and her tongue lashing at Agatha’s clit wildly. She drove her digits in and out in tandem with her tongue, using the force of her arm as a source of energy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s body tensed up, her muscles tight with an overwhelming sensation, and she let out a final, loud cry - her body fell back against the comforter and her head slammed back into the pillows as she came. Her eyes squeezed shut as the waves of pleasure rocked through her body, worsened by Rio’s actions never faltering as she rode out her orgasm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched the woman above her come undone, a satisfied grin on her face as she prolonged Agatha’s pleasure for as long as possible, before Agatha’s legs noticeably shook with overstimulation and she tugged at Rio’s hair, tighter than before.</p><p> </p><p>“T-Too much, baby.” She croaked out, face flushed and her eyes still closed tight.</p><p> </p><p>At that, Rio nodded and moved her head back, resting it against the heated skin of Agatha’s thigh. She allowed her a moment to recuperate before gently sliding her fingers out of Agatha, smiling at the little yip that escaped her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t hesitate to slide her dripping fingers into her mouth, tasting Agatha once again and swallowing it all down whilst climbing up her body, letting the thigh on her shoulder fall back down onto the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha eventually opened her eyes, the room a little fuzzy for a second, but she felt them lock on Rio immediately. The smirking woman released the fingers from her own mouth and crawled up to situate herself, face-to-face with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“So… final verdict?” Rio quipped, capturing Agatha’s lips in a brief and surprisingly chaste kiss. Agatha couldn’t suppress the moan that slipped out at the taste of herself on Rio’s lips. “How’d I do?”</p><p> </p><p>The question got a little chuckle out of Agatha, and she slid a hand around the back of Rio’s neck to keep her close. At the same time, she slid her other hand down Rio’s stomach and pushed past the waistband of her pants, palming over the soaked fabric below.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed with relief as she leaned into the touch, her throat bobbing as Agatha stared up at her.</p><p> </p><p>“You did so good for me, Rio.” She nodded, reaching up to bite at Rio’s neck as her fingers sneakily slipped underneath Rio’s boxers.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me return the favour, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚢</p><p> </p><p>The party was nearing its end, and Alice and Jen were still sprawled on the not-so plush hotel sofa, remnants of their drinks in hand.</p><p> </p><p>“I swear…” Alice started, her voice slurred and low. “If I drink anything else, I’m gonna sink into this couch.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen snorted, her phone in one hand as the other lazily swirled her cocktail around. “Yeah, I’m surprised we’ve lasted this long.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice leaned her head back, closing her eyes with a groan. “Hey, did Agatha and Rio ever come back?”</p><p> </p><p>“Seeing as to how they were practically eating each other’s faces on the dance floor, I’m gonna venture that they’re not coming out of Rio’s suite for a while.” Jen replied pointedly, nudging Alice’s leg with her foot.</p><p> </p><p>She continued tapping away at her phone, laughing at the reactionary groan Alice let out, until a headline caught her eye.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice cracked an eye open. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t respond for a moment, simply staring at it in shock, before turning the screen to Alice, her grin widening.</p><p> </p><p>Below the headline was a grainy, high-angle still from a security camera in the corner of an elevator; Rio, pressed up against the wall, shirt halfway up her stomach, her hands on Agatha’s ass as Agatha’s were groping Rio’s stomach, clearly in the middle of a very heated moment.</p><p> </p><p>Alice sat up so fast she nearly spilled her drink all over the carpet. “You’re fucking kidding me.”</p><p> </p><p>She was already pulling out her own phone, searching for other articles. “Oh there’s more. Everyone’s picking it up, New York Times, PopBase — oh shit, this one has a video.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen leaned over to watch, both of them now doubled over as the video showed a short clip of the two in the elevator, Rio’s hands sliding around Agatha’s waist as they kissed, completely oblivious to the camera.</p><p> </p><p>“This is – this is art.

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Agatha stirred late the next morning, her eyes cracking open to find the sight of rain beating down against the windows, the sky crackling with thunder occasionally. She blinked and reached up to rub the sleep from her eyes, smiling when she felt a soft arm tightening around her waist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled to herself, running a hand through her tangled hair. She could still feel Rio’s touch from the night before, even with the gentleness of her arms now — the warmth of her hands, the strength of her arms as she lifted Agatha, and the way her mouth and fingers brought her over the edge numerous times, leaving her thighs shaking and jaw aching from the screaming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her cheeks flushed at the memory. But her smile faded as she became acutely aware of her current state; she was completely naked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right.” She muttered, exhaling a soft laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pushing the covers aside, she climbed out of bed, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. A quick scan of the room revealed her scattered clothing – her shirt hanging over a chair, one shoe near the door, the other nowhere to be seen. Instead of retrieving them, her gaze fell on a familiar item: the jersey Rio had given her the day before, a little crumpled on the floor from where she’d tossed her bag in the corner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The name </span>
  <em>
    <span>Vidal </span>
  </em>
  <span>splashed across the back in bold white letters made her smile. She picked it up, holding the oversized garment to her chest for a moment before slipping it on. The fabric was impossibly soft and smelled faintly of Rio. It hung loosely on her, as it did Rio, the hem brushing mid-thigh. She caught her reflection in the full-length mirror near the closet. Her dark curls were wild and untamed, her cheeks were still a little flushed, and the sex hair was </span>
  <em>
    <span>insanely </span>
  </em>
  <span>obvious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked… happy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s stomach grumbled, pulling her out of her reverie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Food. That was the next logical step.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned back to look at Rio's sleeping form one more time, the beautiful expanse of her back, the messiness of her bedhead, before padding over into the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rifled through the fridge and cabinets, pleasantly surprised to find an array of fresh ingredients – she concluded Rio had likely not bought these herself, but it was rather the work of an assistant that slipped into the room while they were gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was so focused on the task at hand, frying up some eggs in an oddly similar way she did for Nicky back at home, that she didn’t hear the soft footsteps behind her until it was too late. Warm hands slipped around her waist, and a body pressed against her back, enveloping her in Rio’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning.” Rio’s voice was a low, sleepy murmur against her ear, sending a shiver down Agatha’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned her head slightly, her lips curling into a smile. “Morning. I thought you’d sleep in longer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Couldn’t.” Rio replied, her tone warm and teasing. “Not when I smelled whatever delicious thing you’re making out here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her arms tightened around Agatha’s waist, and she rested her chin on her shoulder. The intimacy of the gesture made Agatha’s chest ache in the best way possible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Jesus, what the fuck kind of karmic justice was this? Had Agatha stepped in front of a bullet for a King or something in a past life?!</span>

</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s just eggs.” Agatha said, her voice soft. “Nothing fancy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, the sound rumbling through her chest. “Fancy or not, I appreciate it. Waking up to you in my kitchen is… a sight I could get used to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt her cheeks heat, but she played it cool, nudging Rio lightly with her elbow. “You’re laying it on thick this morning, Vidal. And this isn’t even </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>kitchen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, pressing a kiss to the nape of Agatha’s neck. “The sentiment remains.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eventually, Agatha managed to convince Rio to let her go so she could plate up their breakfast, and decidedly ignored the slap to her ass as Rio slinked off into the dining area. The rain continued its insistent downpour, beating against the floor-to-ceiling windows and giving the room an almost cosy, intimate feel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat cross-legged in her chair when Agatha finished and set their plates down, smiling up at her thankfully and sliding her phone onto the table face-up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Breakfast is served, madame.” Agatha joked, taking the seat across from her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes lit up as she picked up her fork. “You really know how to spoil a girl, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re not exactly hard to please, are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Only when it comes to breakfast.” Rio took a bite of her eggs, closing her eyes briefly in appreciation. “These are perfect.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Glad you like them.” Agatha said, trying not to blush. She hadn’t expected to be cooking for anyone this morning, let alone someone like Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I’ll keep you around just for the eggs and your... other... talents.” Rio winked, her voice dropping an octave as she took another mouthful, her gaze lingering on Agatha’s face as if daring her to respond.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s cheeks burned furiously and against her better judgement, but she held her ground, raising an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, is that all?” She grabbed a piece of toast and took a deliberate bite, watching Rio’s eyes flicker down to her lips briefly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, not exactly. There’s also your charming personality, of course.” Rio’s voice was a purr, and her grin grew wider.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm-hmm.” Agatha replied, her tone teasing. “And I’m sure I’d keep </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>around for your knack for making me blush. It’s a rare skill, you know. I might just have to write a book titled 'The Art of Embarrassing Agatha' and sell it for millions. Make you a legend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, the sound rich and making Agatha’s heart palpitate in her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d be flattered, but I have a feeling I’d be the one buying copies to give out as gifts. Maybe I could use it to my advantage, though. Like, 'Oh, sorry I’m late for practice, Lilia. I had to give Agatha a personal lesson in the art of blushing'."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, though she couldn’t help but laugh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I bet I can make you blush, Vidal.” She teased, ignoring Rio’s hushed laugh of amusement. “Seriously. You’re not the only one who’s good at that, or are we forgetting last night?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha paused, taking Rio by surprise when she stood up and climbed directly into her lap, straddling her. Rio’s hands instinctively shot to Agatha’s hips, her breath hitching in her throat at the unexpected move.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands drifted up to Rio’s shoulders, indulging for a moment and squeezing them softly, appreciating the strength in them. Then, Agatha made a point of moving her hips down against Rio’s front, breath picking up as she tipped her head back in an exaggerated expression of euphoria.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, </span>
  <em>
    <span>God</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Agatha moaned out, obscene and borderline pornographic in its inflection. It was a poor imitation of Rio’s voice, but she persevered nonetheless. “Fuck, right </span>
  <em>
    <span>there</span>
  </em>
  <span>- oh my God, Rio, you’re so</span>
  <em>
    <span> good</span>
  </em>
  <span> at that, baby!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed as she watched the performance, and Agatha was doing her job perfectly, a flush rising on Rio’s cheeks as her eyes followed Agatha’s exaggerated gasps of air and the way she thrust her chest out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took it even further, moving in now to moan right in Rio’s ear, grasping ahold of her jawline with one hand, the other wrenched to her shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“F-Fuck, Rio… I-I’m close, </span>
  <em>
    <span>baby</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Keep going, </span>
  <em>
    <span>don’t stop.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, alright!” Rio coughed, cheeks now bright red, and Agatha pulled away with a satisfied grin, pressing a kiss to the heated skin of Rio’s ear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Told you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their moment was cut short when Rio’s phone buzzed on the table. She glanced at it, her expression shifting from playful to tense in an instant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What's up?" Agatha asked, noticing the sudden change and turning slightly in Rio’s lap to allow her to reach over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio picked up the phone, her thumbs flying over the screen as she read a text. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's Lilia, my PR manager." Her eyes widened as she took in the message. "Without trying to sound like an episode of SVU, we’ve got a situation."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's heart skipped a beat, and not from arousal this time. "What is it?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took a deep breath before speaking. "The paparazzi somehow got their hands on some CCTV footage from the hotel elevator last night." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned the screen to show Agatha the headline.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>
    <em>@nytimes </em>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <b>Leaked footage from an elevator security camera shows Salemites’ star player Rio Vidal in a romantic embrace with a stranger.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt the blood drain from her face. "Oh fuck."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Below the headline was a grainy, high-angle still from a security camera in the corner of an elevator; Rio, pressed up against the wall, shirt halfway up her stomach, her hands on Agatha’s ass as Agatha’s were groping Rio’s stomach, clearly in the middle of a very heated moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah." Rio nodded, her jaw tightening. "It's everywhere."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's hand flew to her mouth, her eyes scanning the screen with horror. The article was already gaining traction, with comments pouring in faster than she could read them. Her heart pounded in her chest, a mix of fear and disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What do we do?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As if on cue, Rio’s phone rang, the screen flashing </span>
  <em>
    <span>LILIA </span>
  </em>
  <span>in bold letters and a pick-up button. Agatha stood up to allow Rio to answer, smiling when Rio reached up to press a quick kiss to her lips before shuffling into the other room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The phone call lasted longer than Agatha expected. Rio’s low, steady voice hummed in the background, alternating between serious and occasionally sharp as she responded to Lilia. Agatha sat at the table, her fingers idly tracing the rim of her coffee cup, her thoughts a tangled mess.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t that she regretted last night – how could she? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio had been nothing but kind, attentive, and utterly irresistible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But this? Being thrust into the public eye for real now, with everyone knowing she and Rio were actually a thing, and not some tabloid story for fans to speculate on? It was something Agatha wasn’t sure she was ready for, let alone the complications it might bring to her life – and, more importantly, to Nicky’s.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio ended the call with a sigh, setting her phone down on the table as she walked back into the dining area. She looked over at Agatha, her dark eyes searching hers with an intensity that made Agatha feel both exposed and comforted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well?” Agatha asked, her voice quiet but steady.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lilia says we’ll figure it out,” Rio said, leaning forward and resting her forearms on the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s going to handle the PR fallout and spin this the best way possible. But…” Rio hesitated, her jaw tightening briefly. “She thinks, if you’re okay with it, I don’t need to hide us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha blinked. “Hide us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, her expression carefully measured. “Lilia believes this could be a good thing – for the team, for me, for us. She thinks being open about our relationship, if we’re ready for that, might actually generate positive press.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words hung in the air, heavy with implication. Agatha wasn’t sure what she had expected, but it wasn’t this. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms over her chest as she considered the idea. The thought of their budding relationship being public knowledge – open to scrutiny, to judgment – made her stomach churn. But at the same time, the thought of Rio hiding her, pretending she didn’t exist, stung just as deeply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…” Agatha started, then paused, trying to find the right words. “I don’t know, Rio. This is all happening so fast. And I have Nicky to think about.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brow furrowed, her expression softening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know.” She said, her voice low. “That’s why I told Lilia that nothing’s happening until you’re comfortable. We can take this as slow as you need, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha bit her lip, her thoughts drifting to her son. Nicky was only six years old, her whole world, and she’d worked hard to shield him from anything that could disrupt his sense of safety and stability. The idea of paparazzi showing up at their door, or snapping photos of him at the park, made her stomach twist with dread.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I need you to understand something, Rio,” Agatha said, her tone firmer now. “If we do this, if I agree to let the world know about us, I won’t tolerate anyone crossing the line when it comes to my son. Nicky’s off-limits. No paparazzi. No invasive questions. Nothing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s gaze was steady, her expression serious as she nodded. “Agatha, I promise you—I’ll do everything in my power to make sure Nicky is protected. I’ll talk to Lilia, and we’ll set clear boundaries with the media. If they can’t respect that, then we’ll pull the plug. No press is worth putting him at risk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha searched Rio’s face for any hint of doubt or hesitation, but there was none. She exhaled slowly, some of the tension in her chest easing. Still, she wasn’t ready to give a definitive answer just yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll think about it,” she said finally, her voice soft but resolute. “I just… I need time to process all of this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached across to cup her face tenderly, and Agatha took it upon herself to lean into her touch, pulling Rio into a waist-first hug. “Take all the time you need. I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stood like that for a moment, the quiet between them filled with unspoken understanding. Agatha could feel the sincerity in Rio’s touch, the way her thumb brushed gently against her cheek. It was a small gesture, but it grounded her in a way she hadn’t expected.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Agatha said quietly, her eyes meeting Rio’s.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, that dimple in her cheek making an appearance again. “Don’t thank me yet. I’ve still got to convince Lilia not to plaster my face all over the team’s social media today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The joke managed to pull a small laugh from Agatha, easing some of the tension that had settled over her shoulders. For the first time since seeing that headline, she felt like she could breathe again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Later, as Agatha sat on the edge of the bed, pulling on her clothes from the night before, she glanced over at Rio, who was scrolling through her phone with a look of mild irritation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alice already sent me five new articles,” Rio muttered, her tone half-exasperated, half-amused. “Apparently, we’re the talk of Twitter this morning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great,” Agatha said dryly, slipping her feet into her shoes. “And your fans?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned as she scrolled for a second, before reading out some of the highlights.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>I fucking called it, Rio is an ass over boobs lover.</span>
  </em>
  <span>’” She began, breaking out in laughter that eventually infected Agatha too. “Holy shit, listen to this one – ‘What the hell would’ve happened in that elevator if they hadn’t fixed it quickly?’ ‘I guess we would’ve finally figured out if Rio is a bottom or not.’”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, setting her phone aside and walking over to Agatha. She crouched in front of her, resting just on the edge of the bed, her hands resting lightly on her knees. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey.” Rio said softly, grabbing her attention. “No matter what happens, we’re in this together. Okay? As cheesy as that sounds.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, the sincerity in Rio’s voice helping. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned in, pressing a gentle kiss to Agatha’s lips before standing and offering her a hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now, let’s get you home to your little man. I’m sure he’s wondering where his mom is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled, taking Rio’s hand as she stood. “He’s probably more concerned about whether I’ll bring him a donut.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Rio said with a grin, grabbing her keys from the counter. “I think we can make that happen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha and Rio left together pretty quickly, and Rio took notice of the camera in the corner of the elevator as they rode down. Or, the lack thereof – clearly, staff had caught wind of someone leaking the footage from last night, and Lilia had probably ordered them to remove it along with a threat to sue the hotel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s leaned into Rio slightly as they waited, oddly calm – unfortunately, though, the calm wouldn’t last very long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the elevator doors opened to the hotel lobby, Agatha froze. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Through the windows lining the entrance, she could see them; a sea of flashing cameras and shouting voices. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Paparazzi. At least a dozen of them, maybe more, jockeying for position as they aimed their lenses toward the main doors, waiting like vultures.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her breath hitched, and she instinctively stepped closer to Rio, who had already noticed the commotion. Rio’s expression darkened, her jaw clenching as she placed a protective hand on Agatha’s lower back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re relentless,” Rio muttered, her voice tight. “I’m sorry, Agatha. I didn't think they'd be here because of the storm, <strong>fuck</strong>. Fucking vultures.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed hard, her pulse racing. The scene was overwhelming, and the last thing she wanted was to be caught in the middle of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned down slightly, her voice calm but firm. “We’re not going out there. Not like this. There’s a back exit through the service hallway – no cameras, no press. I’ll call the car to meet us there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded wordlessly, allowing Rio to guide her toward a side door near the concierge desk. But as they walked, her eyes kept darting back to the paparazzi outside. She could hear their muffled shouts through the glass, fragments of invasive questions floating in:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Rio! Who’s the mystery woman?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>
      <br />
    </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>“Are you two dating?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>
      <br />
    </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>“Miss Vidal, how long has this been going on?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s chest tightened, a whirlwind of emotion crashing over her. Fear, uncertainty, and a lingering sense of dread. But beneath it all, there was something else – a quiet stubbornness to Agatha’s demeanour, and a resolve that refused to be ignored.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>By the time they reached the discreet exit Rio had mentioned, Agatha stopped in her tracks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait.” she said, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio turned to her, confusion flickering across her face. “What is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a deep breath, her heart pounding. She looked up at Rio, her eyes searching hers for a moment before she reached out and took her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve made my decision.” Agatha said softly, her fingers tightening around Rio’s. “I don’t want to hide this anymore. I’m ready to be public about us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked, momentarily stunned. “Are you sure? Agatha, you don’t have to do this for me. We can still slip out the back-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure.” Agatha interrupted, her voice firm. “This isn’t just about you, Rio. It’s about us. And if we’re going to do this, I want to do it on our terms. Not theirs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s lips parted in surprise, but then a slow, genuine smile spread across her face. The pride and admiration in her eyes made Agatha smile too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Rio said, her voice low and steady. She squeezed Agatha’s hand, her grip warm and reassuring. “Let’s do this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Together, they turned back toward the lobby. Agatha felt the weight of Rio’s presence beside her, grounding her, as they walked toward the front entrance. The moment they stepped outside, the cameras erupted in a frenzy of flashing lights, the paparazzi shouting over one another in a chaotic yell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Rio, who is she?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>
      <br />
    </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>“Are you in a relationship?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>
      <br />
    </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>“Honey, what’s your name? Are you dating Rio Vidal?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha kept her head high, her hand firmly clasped in Rio’s. She didn’t answer any of the questions, and neither did Rio. The noise and chaos buzzed around them, made worse by the rain that didn't let up, pummelling down onto her and Rio, but she refused to let it shake her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio led the way toward the waiting black SUV, her posture relaxed but commanding. She opened the car door for Agatha, shielding her from the cameras as much as possible before climbing in beside her. The door slammed shut, cutting off the buzz of noise outside, and the car began to pull away from the curb.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the silence that followed, Agatha let out a breath and glanced over at Rio, who was watching her with a mix of concern and admiration.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You okay?” Rio asked, her voice gentle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, managing a small smile. “I think so. That was… intense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled softly. “You handled it like a pro. I’m impressed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her smile grew. “Don’t start. I’ll be needing a stiff drink by the end of the day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, reaching over to take her hand again. “Deal. But first, let’s get you home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha glanced at the driver through the rearview mirror. “Can you take us to my house, please?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The driver nodded, and the car veered onto a quieter street, leaving the chaos of the hotel behind.</span>

  <p>The car’s interior was silent as it drove down the street, the cityscape of New Jersey fading into the quieter, suburban roads of Westview.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back in her seat, the warmth of Rio’s oversized jersey against her skin providing a strange sort of comfort. Her left hand fiddled absentmindedly with the hem, while the other remained lazily entwined with Rio’s, secretly relishing in the feeling of Rio’s thumb brushing over her knuckles.</p><p> </p><p>She was absentmindedly scrolling through her social media feed, stumbling across new reactions and headlines with every refresh.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>@TheCinesthetic</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>rio vidal photographed outside a club in new jersey (2024)</b>
</p><p> </p><p>The photos were of her and Agatha from those few weeks ago, when some scumbag got photos of the two of them in an almost-kiss. The fans, of course, didn’t know that, though, and their reactions to the pictures were as feral as always.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>@riosbabygirl: cinesthetic know exactly what they’re doing reposting these pics today lmao</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>@villxnelle: no but why r they kinda fucking adorable??? this is some romantic comedy ahh shit</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>@salemitezoid: ignoring how much i hate cinesthetic to appreciate how good these two look together omfg</b>
</p><p> </p><p>“So." She began, breaking the quiet as she turned her head toward Rio, who was gazing out the window with a relaxed demeanour. “What exactly is your manager going to say to the press? You know… about us.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, if I know Lilia, she’ll probably keep it vague. Something like, ‘Rio Vidal values her privacy and appreciates the continued support of her fans.’ You know, the usual PR jargon.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised a brow, unimpressed. “Oh that's not gonna cut it, the entire world just saw us making out in an elevator."</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t hide a grin at the memory.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re probably right.” She nodded, pulling Agatha a little closer by their conjoined hands. “Honestly? Let them talk. If you’re fine with it, then so am I.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a public figure, Rio.” Agatha frowned, her lips pressed into a thin line. “People care about who you’re dating. They’re going to care about who I am and I’m just… some woman you met at one of your games.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha-”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not a star athlete, or some top-notch basketball player, <em> fuck </em>– I’m just a mom who brought her kid along to a basketball game, I don’t even-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, cutting her off by the most logical means; cupping Agatha’s face and pulling her up into a kiss.</p><p> </p><p>It was chaste, slow and lingering, and Rio made no effort to move away when Agatha broke it, their noses brushing.</p><p> </p><p>“You are <em> not </em> some mom, Agatha. You’re a fucking gorgeous specimen of a woman, who’s way too funny for her own good and way too good at calling <em> me </em> out on my crap.” She leaned back at that, looking into Agatha’s sad, wide eyes. “If people want to talk about us, then let them. They’ll never know the <em> half </em>of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s easy for you to say. You’ve had years to get used to being in the public eye. This is all new to me.”</p><p> </p><p>“True.” Rio admitted, her tone lightening as she moved away fully now, still holding onto Agatha’s hand. “But I’d like to think you’re a quick learner. I mean, you handled the paparazzi earlier like a total pro. Didn’t even flinch when they started shouting questions.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a dry laugh. “That’s because I was too busy trying not to trip over my own feet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you looked cool as hell doing it.” Rio said with an overzealous wink.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, a reluctant smile tugging at her lips. She fell silent for a moment, her thoughts drifting. </p><p> </p><p>When she spoke again, her voice was quieter, more contemplative. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s the plan, then? If we’re not going to hide this… what do we call it? Us?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, a certain teasing manner returning to her eyes. “What do you want to call it? Friends? With benefits? Eternal soulmates? Or should we just skip the drama and go straight to girlfriends?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head whipped around to face her, her mouth dropping open in surprise before she caught herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Girlfriends? You’re not serious.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why not?” Rio said with a shrug, though her grin betrayed her amusement.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m forty-seven, Rio. I don’t <em> do </em>the term ‘girlfriend’.”</p><p> </p><p>“What does that have to do with anything?” Rio full-on laughed. “It’d make things a lot easier for Lilia. She wouldn’t have to figure out how to spin our ‘relationship of undefined status.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though her cheeks betrayed her with a telltale blush. “You really have a way with words, don’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s part of my charm,” Rio shrugged, all nonchalant.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a laugh, shaking her head. “You’re impossible.”</p><p> </p><p>“But you’re still here.” Rio pointed out, her voice softening. “And that has to count for something, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha met her gaze, something unspoken passing between them. The car hit a brief stoplight, and in the pause, she found herself wondering if maybe, impossibly so, Rio was <em> right </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, let’s say I’m considering it,” Agatha said, her tone light but her words careful. “What would that look like? Us, as… girlfriends.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin widened, but she didn’t immediately reply. Instead, she leaned forward, propping her elbow on the console between them and briefly bringing Agatha’s hand up to press a kiss to the back of it. </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm. Well, for starters, I’d take you out on more dates. Real dates. None of this sneaking-around bullshit. And I’d probably have to <em> actually </em>meet Nicky, away from the court, not just as his favorite basketball player but as someone who’s important to you. How am I doing so far?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched upward despite her resistance. “Not bad. Go on.”</p><p> </p><p>“And.” Rio continued, her voice turning mock-serious. “I’d have to make sure you understand the sacred rules of dating a basketball player.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, really? And what are those?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised a finger, ticking off an imaginary list. </p><p> </p><p>“Rule number one: you’re not allowed to cheer for the opposing team, even if they’re the underdogs.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “I think I can handle that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rule number two: you have to be okay with me stealing your fries. It’s non-negotiable.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stealing my fries? That’s a red flag right there.”</p><p> </p><p>“And rule number three…” Rio’s voice dropped slightly, her teasing replaced with a sincerity that may or may not have scared Agatha a little.</p><p> </p><p>“You have to let me be there for you, Agatha. All of you. The good, the messy, the outright bad, the weird as fuck. Deal?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, and for a moment, she couldn’t find the right words. </p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard, managing a small smile. “You make a compelling argument, Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p>The car turned onto her street at that moment, the familiar sight of her house coming into view. As the driver pulled up to the curb, Agatha felt a flicker of nerves. She unbuckled her seatbelt but didn’t immediately get out.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you…” She hesitated, watching Rio’s reaction. “Do you want to come inside?”</p><p> </p><p>At that, Rio let out a little laugh. “I only fuck after the third date, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>“Liar.”</p><p> </p><p>They both broke out into laughter, and Agatha cupped the side of Rio’s neck to kiss her cheek, murmuring against it. “Not for sex, you minx.” She pulled away to look into Rio’s eyes whilst speaking to her.</p><p> </p><p>“You can come in, and meet Nicky properly. Like you wanted.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio seemed happy with that, squeezing the hand still nestled in Rio’s own. “Of course. I’d love to.”</p><p> </p><p>She told her driver to head back home, and that she’ll call later if and when she needed to be picked up. Then, Rio climbed out of the car with Agatha shortly following behind, walking up her driveway side-by-side to go inside.</p><p> </p><p>They were both immediately met with the smell of burnt toast permeating through the foyer, as well as the rampant footsteps of a six-year-old bounding up to the front door.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama, Mama, I made myself a-”</p><p> </p><p>He quite literally skidded to a halt in front of them, crashing into Agatha’s legs as he stared up at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Woah, hey Rio!” He seemed to recover immediately, jumping for joy and tugging at his mother’s hand. “What are you doing here? Oh my Gosh- wait, are you gonna help me show Vision how good I am at shooting? He totally doesn’t believe me, and if I had you there, we could show him together!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned and knelt down to match his height, nodding. “That sounds awesome, bud. I’d definitely be up for that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky, baby, I wanna talk to you about something.” Agatha added, kneeling down too and squeezing his little hand as he glanced between them animatedly.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, Mama. What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>“You know how yesterday we went to the game, and you got to meet Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.” Nicky grinned, nodding enthusiastically and turning to her. “It was so awesome!”</p><p> </p><p>“Well.” Agatha continued, her voice gentle but steady. “Rio and I… we’re friends. But we’re also maybe something a little more than friends.”</p><p> </p><p>“Like best friends?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, the tension in her chest easing. “Something like that, sure. But maybe… maybe she’s something a little more than that.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky’s grin faltered for a moment, replaced by a look of confusion. He glanced between Agatha and Rio, his small hands clutching the basketball tightly. “More than a friend? Like… a girlfriend?”</p><p> </p><p>The question hung in the air for a beat, and both women exchanged a look—half amused, half nervous.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, uh…” Rio scratched the back of her neck, her signature confidence momentarily replaced by a sheepish smile. “That’s a good question, buddy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her lip, suppressing a laugh as she ruffled Nicky’s curls. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s a little complicated, sweetie. But what’s important is that I really like Rio, and I think she really likes me too. And she likes you a lot, which makes it even better.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky seemed to mull this over, his expression shifting from confusion to delight. “Does that mean she can come to my birthday party?!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the sudden pivot. “Your birthday isn’t for another six months, Nicky.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know.” He dragged out, bouncing on his toes. “But if Rio’s gonna be around, she has to come! She can help me beat everyone at basketball!”</p><p> </p><p>“I think I can make that happen. But only if you keep practicing your jump shot, okay?” Rio laughed.</p><p> </p><p>“Deal!” Nicky exclaimed, throwing his arms around Rio in a quick, enthusiastic hug.</p><p> </p><p>As Nicky pulled back and darted into the living room to resume his basketball moves, Agatha stood, crossing her arms and giving Rio a playful look. “Well, that wasn’t as awkward as I thought it’d be.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned, leaning casually against the doorframe. “Told you I’m good with kids. He’s awesome, by the way. You’re doing an amazing job with him.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha said, her voice softening. “That means a lot.”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, they stood there in comfortable silence, the sound of Nicky’s laughter echoing from the living room. </p><p> </p><p>Then Rio leaned in slightly, her tone playful. “So… about that ‘girlfriend’ question. What do we tell him next time he asks?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, though a small smile tugged at her lips. “Oh, so now you’re letting a six-year-old define our relationship?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, he’s a smart kid.” Rio said with a shrug, her dimples flashing. “But seriously, no pressure. We don’t have to figure it all out right this second.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, her gaze softening as she looked at Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“I know. But for the record…” She hesitated, then let out a quiet laugh. “I wouldn’t exactly mind being your girlfriend.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile widened, her voice dropping to a warm murmur. “Good to know, Agatha. Real good to know.”</p><p> </p><p>Before either of them could say more, Nicky’s voice called out from the living room. </p><p> </p><p>“Mom! Rio! Come see the toast I made!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, shaking her head. “Guess that’s our cue.”</p><p> </p><p>“Lead the way, Coach.” Rio teased, gesturing toward the kitchen.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Agatha had absolutely zero idea how she ended up sprawled on her bed, in the middle of the day, with one hand clutching Rio’s jersey to her nose, and the other working furiously between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>The laptop to her right played on, the screen lighting up Agatha’s face as she glanced over at it, brows knitted in concentration.</p><p> </p><p>“My name is Rio Vidal, and I’m going to be reading… your guys' thirst tweets.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice was like silk as it flowed out of the speakers, filling Agatha’s ears and sending her fingers into a frenzy.</p><p> </p><p>They'd been apart for an entire week now, with Rio having been dragged away to New York City for a strategic game after their victory in the finals. Before then, most of their days had consisted of a lot of texting between Rio and herself during the day, and Rio would eventually give up on her plans to stay at the hotel for the night and would turn up on Agatha's front porch with a grin.</p><p> </p><p>For the most part, their time together had been full of great sex, good smokes, amazing talk, and a hell of a lot of laughter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was funny. Incredibly so; enough that Agatha found herself clutching at her stomach for a reprieve, begging Rio to stop before she caved in on herself.</p><p> </p><p>But it wasn't just that - Rio was <em> amazing </em> with Nicky, too, and he couldn't've been happier when she was around. They'd joke around too, antagonise Agatha, prank Wanda whenever she and the boys would come over, shoot hoops for hours on end, and Nicky even managed to get Rio to sit and watch <em> Fantastic Mr Fox </em> with him as he followed along with each line of dialogue, animatedly recreating the movie himself.</p><p> </p><p>And so, yeah, Agatha was missing Rio now that she'd packed up for New York.</p><p> </p><p>A lot.</p><p> </p><p>A lot <em>more</em> than she'd expected.</p><p> </p><p>So much so, that when Rio's latest interview dropped, a Buzzfeed classic of having a celebrity read out the public's horny tweets about them - Agatha had gone positively feral.</p><p> </p><p>It really didn't help that Rio had chosen a jaw-dropping fit for the interview; a skin-tight muscle shirt, which did absolute wonders for Rio's abs, arms, shoulders, tits, stomach, <em> everything. </em></p><p> </p><p>She'd grinned at the camera, flashing that adorable gap in her teeth, and Agatha had barely hesitated to fish out Rio's jersey from her bedside table. The sheer smell of Rio on it; her natural scent, permeating off the <em> Vidal </em>shirt...</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's fingers found their way into her panties without even thinking about it.</p><p> </p><p>"First tweet..." Rio continued, and Agatha's distracted mind flitted back to the video. Her attention was briefly drawn to the flex in Rio's bicep as she adjusted the phone in her hand, leaning forward.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>rio take it out it's hurtinggggg...</em>" The photos underneath were of Rio knelt down during a game, her face positively dripping in sweat as she frowned and scowled at something. She leaned back with laughter, shaking as she covered her mouth to stifle the giggles.</p><p> </p><p>"So, we're starting off strong, alright. Well, okay, that's certainly something..."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the frozen frame of Rio on her laptop screen — smiling, blushing, the veins in her arms popping in a way that felt almost <em> disrespectful </em>— and took a deep breath, which sent an unintentional bout of Rio’s scent into her nose, and her eyes practically rolled back into her skull.</p><p> </p><p>She needed to stop. She needed to turn this off. She needed to take her goddamn hand out of her panties, stop rubbing her clit in that way that made her hips jump <em> just </em> right, throw the goddamn shirt off the bed so she’d stop getting a trace of the smell that made her just a <em> little </em>bit feral.</p><p> </p><p>She needed to <em> not </em> spiral into insanity over her insanely hot, freakishly strong, and unfairly <em> beloved </em> girlfriend, actually. It wouldn’t’ve been good for her health, really.</p><p> </p><p>But instead, she hit play again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was wiping at her eyes, still laughing, as she squinted at the next tweet. "<em> Oh, my God. </em> You guys are nasty for real. Okay, uh, <em>put me in a room with rio after one of her games and we're both coming out pregnant. the backshots are gonna sound like black widow hitting the ground.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Why did her voice have to be so sexy? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Against her better judgement, Agatha’s fingers sped up. She rubbed in little circles now, chasing the feeling as her stomach tightened and released with pleasure. It really didn’t help that Agatha’s mind kept drifting back to their last encounter before Rio left for New York.</p><p> </p><p>Which, funnily enough, happened in an airport bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>Why Rio’s manager decided Rio needed to catch a <em> plane </em> from <em> New Jersey </em> to <em> New York </em>,Agatha’ll never know.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not like they planned it or anything, either – Rio just <em> had </em> to wear that stupidly tight-fitting compression shirt all day, and Agatha wasn’t holding back when she dragged Rio by the hand into the singular restroom, shakingly locked the door behind them, and allowed Rio to absolutely <em> devour </em>her as she sat astride the sink countertop.</p><p> </p><p>Present, video-Rio on the screen flexed her fingers and grinned at the camera. "I <em> can </em> bench press a person, actually."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot up straight with a confused moan. Clearly she’d missed the context of that comment, too caught up in pleasuring herself. "<em>What.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>She reached for her phone, half a second away from texting Rio to tell her to <em> elaborate immediately</em>, but the video kept going.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes widened comically at the next one.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>once again begging rio vidal to get me pregnant three times, abandon me &amp; refuse to pay child support. then i’ll show up at her house, make a scene, break everything just so she’ll grab me by the arm, drag me to a corner, take me against the wall &amp; get me pregnant a fourth time. </em>"</p><p> </p><p>Rio just <em> cackled </em>, shaking her head before wiping a fake tear from her eye. "I… I don’t even know what to say to that one. Oh… Oh my God, you guys."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked but then frowned when she saw Rio’s eyes flick downward on the screen — reading ahead — before she let out a loud, full-body <em> wheeze </em>.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my God — shit, she’s gonna… oh, she’s gonna love this one."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped. Her fingers paused in her panties, and she stared at the screen.</p><p> </p><p>Rio clutched her chest, struggling to get through it. "<em>agatha could step on my neck, rio could bench press my body straight into the ceiling, and i would simply say thank you. actually nah i’d say AGAIN PLEASE GOD.</em>'"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swore under her breath, her pace faltering a little as the video kept going.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, last one,” Rio wheezed, wiping at her eyes before looking at the screen. "<em> i saw that video of rio and agatha making out in that elevator, and i have never known peace since.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha <em> threw </em> her phone onto the bed, forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>"I <em> hate </em> this.” She muttered, fingers working even harder as Rio grinned into the camera.</p><p> </p><p>"I mean, I haven’t known peace since that day either, to be fair." Rio teased before winking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped her ministrations.</p><p> </p><p>Stared.</p><p> </p><p>Considered her options.</p><p> </p><p>Two days. Two <em> long</em>, <em> excruciating</em>, days.</p><p> </p><p>Or.</p><p> </p><p>She could drive to New York.</p><p> </p><p>Right now.</p><p> </p><p>Crash the game.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe tackle Rio onto the court.</p><p> </p><p>Just a little.</p><p> </p><p>For science.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe they’d kiss a little. Or a lot, realistically. And Rio would probably be strong enough to flip Agatha over, put her on her back, rip off her bra and panties and get her face in between Agatha’s thig–</p><p> </p><p>Jesus. <em>No</em>.</p><p> </p><p>It was literally two days until Agatha would see Rio again. Forty-eight hours. Less than that, even.</p><p> </p><p>Still…</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚢</p><p> </p><p>

Once Lilia caught up to it, she hadn’t hesitated to lead Agatha through the stands and down to the courtside seats whilst the opposing team attempted to run out the clock.</p><p> </p><p>She tried to suppress her smirk as the woman Agatha was dating – dating, good <em>Lord </em>– moved with the finesse that’d secured her as the star player of the Salemites. No wonder there were millions of crazy girls on Twitter going batshit for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chewed her lip with a mixture of nerves and excitement, eyes trained on Rio’s darting form.</p><p> </p><p>She took a particularly risky shot from just outside the three-point line. It soared, spinning perfectly – and the ball swished right through the net.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Game over. Salemites win. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The entire court and stands erupted. Rio’s face split into a huge grin as she let out a relieved yell, all bright eyes and sweat-drenched victory. Her arms were outstretched as her teammates practically tackled her in celebration.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled and rolled her eyes as she saw Alice bringing the rest of their team into a successful chant, literally <em> jumping </em>as they whooped and cried and shouted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio eventually broke free, and Agatha knew what was coming the moment Rio’s gaze finally fell on her girlfriend.</p><p> </p><p>She inhaled, applauding quietly.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you–” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha began to protest, but Rio was already there and vaulting over the courtside barrier in a surprising display of agility.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby!”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, for fuck’s–” She was cut off again as Rio swept her up in her arms, hands securely fastened around her thighs beneath the bright lights. It was a little dizzying, figuratively and literally, as she spun Agatha around. Laughter bubbled out of Rio’s mouth, unstoppable and uncontainable.</p><p> </p><p>“Put me down!” Agatha breathed out, even as her arms wrapped instinctively around Rio’s shoulders and clasped over one another.</p><p> </p><p>“Nope.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed a kiss to her cheek, then to the corner of her mouth, and lastly, shamelessly, <em> fully, </em>on her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“You look hot under the stadium lights, you know that?” Rio murmured against her, and Agatha rolled her eyes again as she pulled back, cheeks warm. “Wait… what the fuck are you doing here?”</p><p> </p><p>“I… may have driven.”</p><p> </p><p>“From Westview?” Rio near-exclaimed, laughing at the absurdity. “Aw, you missed me that much?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha half-heartedly shoved her shoulder, feigning nonchalance and changing the subject. “Go and find your coach before he loses his mind.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, giving a two-finger salute as she set Agatha back down, kissed her one more time for good measure, before jogging back to her team.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her go, heart racing, and laughed under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>There was a buzz in her pocket, and Agatha knew what was coming the minute she pulled her phone out and opened up the notification.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda: you make it in time? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda: i cannot fucking believe you just decided to drive to new york for a basketball game </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha: excuse you </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha: my girlfriend is very much part of that basketball game </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda: girlfriend ojgfjhhfjfhj </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda: it’s so crazy to hear you say that sorry </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha: shut up </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha: how’s nicky doing? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda: having the time of his little life beating my sons in minecraft bed wars </em>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda: you think i know?? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda: half the things my boys say sound like gibberish i just run with it </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was just about to respond, when two hands slipped around her waist and a familiar, warm body pressed into her back.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t believe you’re here. I fuckin’ missed you, you know.” Rio murmured, and Agatha felt the words vibrate through her like a second heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t make a big deal out of it.” She huffed, but let herself sink into Rio’s hold, her grin betraying her outward appearance. “But, um. Yeah. I sort of missed you too.”</p><p> </p><p>They stood there, the chaos of the victorious stadium swirling around them, like they were in their own little universe.</p><p> </p><p>“So… you staying for the night?”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess I could be persuaded.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled against her neck. “I’m very persuasive. You might even say relentless.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed again. She managed to get an arm free just enough to tap a response.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha: spending the night </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha: be back tomorrow, ty for having nicky </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda: mhm whatever </em>

  <em> Wanda: this is for him not for u horny freak </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda: oh and tell rio i said hi </em>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>The moment the text was read, Rio turned Agatha around to face her and slipped her hand into her girlfriend’s. She began tugging her somewhere off the court.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on.”</p><p> </p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin was devilish as she leaned in to whisper, “Locker room.”</p><p> </p><p>She pulled her into the room without a complaint, still buzzing with post-game euphoria. </p><p> </p><p>The second the door swung closed behind them, Agatha barely had time to register the <em> Salemites </em>logos plastered everywhere before Rio was kissing her again, guiding her backwards until she felt the cool metal of a locker against her back.</p><p> </p><p>“You are completely insatiable.” Agatha said between hurried, breathless kisses as Rio’s hands traveled under her shirt and up her sides.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s news?” Rio replied, laughing against her mouth. “You know you love it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head tipped back, hitting the locker with a soft clang as Rio nipped at her neck and collarbone. Her fingers were tangled in Rio’s hair, tugging just enough to drive her wild.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus.” Agatha got out on an unsteady exhale as Rio moved lower. </p><p> </p><p>There was absolutely <em> nothing </em>refined about this; it was sloppy and desperate and impatient in all the ways that reminded Agatha exactly why she’d decided to drive two hours on a whim through Saturday traffic to see her girlfriend.</p><p> </p><p>Wordlessly, Rio dropped to her knees. Her grin was devilish as she began undoing Agatha's jeans with deft fingers, looking up at her with those bright eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“How much time do we have?” Agatha asked, trying for casual but landing somewhere closer to <em> frantic </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Enough.” Rio kissed along her hipbone, teasing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath through gritted teeth as hands slid beneath denim and lace. Relentless; that was one way of putting it. She could barely think straight as she looked down at Rio unzipping her fly and boldly tugging the denim right down Agatha’s thighs, letting them bunch at her knees.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, Rio, baby—” She struggled to get out through arousal and heavy breaths, still watching closely as Rio began mouthing at the inner meat of her thigh. “What if someone comes in?”</p><p> </p><p>“Post-game interviews run for a half hour, Lilia makes sure of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then why aren’t you—”</p><p> </p><p>“I made an excuse.” Rio <em> giggled </em>, right as she tugged Agatha’s jeans all the way off and guided her to step out of them, focusing her attention on her panties now. “I’ll make up for it by doing team promo later tonight, we made a deal.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Alright, well then—”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cut her own sentence off with a sharp gasp, as Rio pushed the fabric aside and ran her tongue over her center, unhurried but with an urgency all the same.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Rio mumbled against her, hot breath sending Agatha’s knees shaking as she hitched them over her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>“God, yes.” Agatha breathed out, clutching at her hair for support now. Rio didn’t stop. She kissed and licked and sucked at her clit in a way that was absolutely relentless, and Agatha could do nothing but roll her hips into it as she moaned loud enough to echo.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had always been able to unravel her like this, press every button without missing a beat. It sent a thrill through Agatha because it was wild and reckless; because Agatha knew exactly who she was losing control with.</p><p> </p><p>“Shit, that feels—” Agatha’s voice cracked on another gasp. There was nothing restrained left in her at this point, no chance of keeping herself quiet or composed. Not if Rio kept up like that.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio did, slipping two fingers inside her without warning while working a perfect rhythm with her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha choked out, feeling heat pool low in her belly and spread like wildfire through the rest of her body. She could barely process anything beyond how good it was; how much she wanted this, needed this.</p><p> </p><p>She was so close, right there, when Rio suddenly slowed her tongue to a maddening crawl.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha gasped out, hips bucking involuntarily in an attempt to find any kind of relief. “<em>Eat my pussy</em>, what the fuck is your problem.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled, kissing the inside of her thigh before starting up again with agonizing patience. The drag of her tongue was languid and slow now; her fingers worked a teasing rhythm that was almost cruel.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swore under her breath as Rio edged her, as she pulled back just enough to keep Agatha from tipping over again and again.</p><p> </p><p>“Too much?” Rio smirked against her.</p><p> </p><p>“Not enough,” Agatha growled down at her. “Fuck, I swear…”</p><p> </p><p>“You want it that bad?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes! You already fucking <em>know</em> I do.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed at that, dipping two fingers deep inside and curling them until Agatha almost couldn’t stand it.</p><p> </p><p>“You said you might be persuaded to stay the night,” Rio mused between strokes, deliberate and slow. “I’m gonna make sure you don’t leave for a week.”</p><p> </p><p>“Gonna die before then if you <em>—<b> gah</b></em>—” She broke off into a whimper as Rio picked up speed again, this time not stopping. It was relentless; it was perfect; it had Agatha <em> unraveling </em>completely.</p><p> </p><p>Her whole body tensed and shuddered when she finally came, a long moan echoing through the empty locker room as she rode out wave after wave on Rio’s skilled mouth and hands.</p><p> </p><p>When the last tremor subsided, Agatha fell back against the cold metal, legs still trembling around Rio’s shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood up slowly. Her lips were wet and swollen, and she looked very pleased with herself. “Good?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw stars. </p><p> </p><p>“Shut up.” She managed weakly.</p><p> </p><p>With one last kiss on Agatha’s neck, Rio let her go to fumble for discarded jeans.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re lucky interviews take forever, you shithead.” Agatha said with mock exasperation as she got dressed again, shaking strands of hair from her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabbed a fresh shirt from an open locker and slipped it on. “Didn’t hear you complaining.”</p><p> </p><p>“Next time I’m gonna edge you for a goddamn hour, see how you like it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow at her. “Can’t wait.”</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in, catching Agatha’s mouth with her own. It was insistent and messy; all tongue and teeth as they stumbled back against the lockers, Agatha’s shirt half-buttoned and forgotten. Rio’s fingers tangled in her hair while Agatha gripped greedily at the new fabric against Rio’s torso.</p><p> </p><p>“Missed you.” Agatha mumbled between kisses that left her dizzy.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just groaned in response, lips moving down Agatha’s jaw before meeting hers again with the same hazy lanquidity. They kissed until it was breathless and sloppy, until their mouths were a blur of heat and want and moans swallowed between them.</p><p> </p><p>“Missed you too.” Rio managed when they pulled apart just long enough to breathe, her voice low.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha drew her back with a hand at the nape of her neck. She bit at Rio’s bottom lip, tugged, then let go with an impatient noise that had Rio pressing closer, pinning her fully against the cool metal of the lockers now.</p><p> </p><p>Hands roamed over each other—greedy, familiar—as they came together again in a rush. Agatha curled a leg around Rio’s hip to pull her closer still, knees weak as Rio kissed down the side of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“No fair.” She muttered as nails scraped along her scalp from where Rio couldn’t stop touching.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed into her skin. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“That you’re still dressed.”</p><p> </p><p>“You have no idea how sexy you look right now.” Rio said as she caught Agatha's mouth again with another deep kiss that sent them both reeling.</p><p> </p><p>The way she said it made Agatha clench helplessly around nothing. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck.” She breathed out, hips grinding against Rio with thoughtless need.</p><p> </p><p>There wasn’t any time for more than this — just kissing and pushing hands under shirts until they were aching and desperately pressed together, to the point where it was difficult to tell where one began and one ended.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you.”</p><p> </p><p><b>Everything </b>stopped for a minute.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze up under Rio’s touch.</p><p> </p><p>She’d just said I love you. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Out loud.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> To Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back too, looking at Agatha with wide eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you just—”</p><p> </p><p>“Shit.” Agatha blurted out.  “I didn’t mean to—” </p><p> </p><p>She clamped her mouth shut instead of continuing, cheeks aflame.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her, silent for a <em> terrifying </em>moment from Agatha’s perspective.</p><p> </p><p>Then she broke into the biggest grin Agatha had ever seen. </p><p> </p><p>“You love me, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt like she might spontaneously combust. “I didn’t say that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You <em> literally </em>did.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t mean to.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you <em> accidentally </em>love me?” Rio teased, eyes bright.</p><p> </p><p>“Something like that.” Agatha’s heart pounded in her ears; she was almost afraid to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her again, slower this time. It was warm and gentle and made Agatha forget how to stand.</p><p> </p><p>They broke apart and Rio pressed her forehead against Agatha’s with a sigh. </p><p> </p><p>“Good.” She said, soft enough that it made Agatha’s chest ache in the best way possible. “'Cause I love you too.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” Agatha said stupidly, blinking at Rio like she couldn’t quite believe it.</p><p> </p><p>Her shock must have shown on her face because Rio laughed, pulling back with an affectionate tug on Agatha’s hair. “Did you really think you were the only one?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what I thought.” Agatha admitted with a sheepish smile. Her heart still felt like it was doing backflips.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head with a fond look that sent heat spiraling all through Agatha again.</p><p> </p><p>“God, I’m so screwed.” Agatha laughed, feeling lightheaded and giddy.</p><p> </p><p>“That makes two of us.” Rio stole another quick kiss before stepping away just enough to let them both breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched as Rio grabbed her bag from the bench. She felt warm and dizzy and deliciously undone, more than a little unsteady on her feet still.</p><p> </p><p>“So about staying the night…” Rio began as they headed for the exit together, a wicked tilt to her smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swatted at her with mock indignation but couldn’t quite keep her own grin away. “Don’t push your luck.”</p><p> </p><p>She ended that night in Rio’s bed, curled up in her girlfriend’s arms, who she <em> loved. </em></p>
