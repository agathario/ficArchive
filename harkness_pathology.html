<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha and Rio as surgeons.<br/>Slow burn, lots of smut, they're horny idiots.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>“You have zero chill,” Agatha mocked, amused.</p>
<p>“No, you have zero chill. You kept looking at me.”</p>
<p>“Did not.”</p>
<p>“Did yes.”</p>
<p>“Looked how? We were literally having dinner together, how could I not have looked at you…”</p>
<p>Rio’s smile got smugger, and one of her hands finally went to Agatha’s knee, index slowly trailing up her leg.</p>
<p>And now she was going to be the one catching fire.</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Heels clicking on the beige floor of the general surgery department, Agatha sipped on her coffee. It was a good morning. She’d had two full days of rest, which she’d spent taking Nicky on a day-trip on the closest lake and curling up on the sofa in front of a movie on his most recent obsession, which she kind of hated. <em>Bugs</em>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The morning meeting with plastics had been uneventful enough, residents from the previous shifts had managed to screw up slightly less than their usual, and there was no new complicated patient to worry about.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Such a good morning, it could only mean something bad was going to happen soon, something in the scale of mass disaster, hurricanes, earthquakes, a plane crash. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She shrugged, stepping into the general surgery meeting room, and she was feeling so generous she even held the door open for the resident following after her like a stray cat. </span>
<span>She'd never admit it out loud, but she kinda liked this one. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, tolerated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy politely smiled at her, clutching his notepad against his chest as he slipped in. He waited for her to take a seat around the large square table taking half the room before sitting to her right. He knew better than to sit to her left, where, being left-handed, she liked to have a little more personal space. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Good boy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sipped on her coffee some more as Billy handed her some papers, charts of the patient they’d come to discuss. Oh, this was going to be fun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the general surgery team sat around the table, all known faces even though she couldn’t remember some (ok, most) names, she rapidly went over the chart. </span>
<span>That was when </span>
<em>
<span>someone</span>
</em>
<span> pulled back the chair to her left and decidedly sat in it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And they were definitely too close, leaning towards her to stare at the big screen up on the wall. She turned back to shoot them a dirty look, whoever the idiot was. They all knew not to bother her by now, right? She had a reputation to uphold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But, to her surprise, she actually hadn’t seen </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> idiot before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was a young woman in her thirties, wavy dark hair and long lashes, her lips pursed as she sat back and glanced at her phone. When she noticed Agatha staring and looked up, her eyes were </span>
<em>
<span>huge</span>
</em>
<span>, and the warmest shade of brown. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s frown deepened, and the woman’s eyes sparkled with something that looked an awful lot like amusement. And then she looked her up and down-an awful lot like she was checking her out...</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Have you heard of something called personal space?" Agatha bit at her, trying to keep her tone level. The girl-annoyingly so-seemed to hold back a chuckle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No one here knows what that is. Look around," she gestured at the room, cramped with attendings, nurses, fellows sitting too close to each other around the table, some residents to the back of their attendings, a student even standing against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was going to shoot back a reply when the chief of general surgery, a short bald man in his sixties, started introducing her, and she had to turn back to him, sitting right below the screen in his swivel chair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Doctor Harkness, should your resident to introduce the case?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely nodded at Billy, and he sat up straighter as someone passed him the pointer. He opened the patient’s files on the big screen and started going over their history. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"62-year-old female, obese with a BMI of 34, diabetes mellitus and chronic venous insufficiency. She got an hysterectomy at 45 and a gastric bypass at 50. No drug allergies… - </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted, highly aware of the woman to her left when she stretched her legs and her feet shuffled closer into Agatha’s personal space. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ugh</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she bent her legs back, her green scrubs pants slid up, revealing a pair of white socks with the word “BITCH” sewn into the front. </span>
<em>
<span>Professional</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her swivel chair more to the right, trying to get that annoying fuck out of her view completely. When Billy was done with the patient’s history and everyone started staring at her like she could snap her fingers and fix the case, Agatha stood up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Pictures," she pointed at the screen as she shot Billy a look, and he knew what to do. As she walked below the screen, a picture of the patient’s abdomen lit up on it. "Next," she said, and Billy complied. She slid a hand in the pocket of her white coat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you see this?" She pointed at the almost 20cm large necrotic wound on the patient’s abdomen as her eyes scanned the room. "You think slapping a flap on it will fix it?" a sarcastic smile started growing on her face, and she could see some weaker links starting to squirm. "Or do you think, </span>
<em>
<span>maybe</span>
</em>
<span>, you guys should try and manage the infection before we peel some more of her skin off to try and cover up this medical disaster?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>No one replied and Agatha gestured at the screen for Billy, who went to the next picture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have a suggestion," she continued, "look at this for all of five seconds and maybe </span>
<em>
<span>next time</span>
</em>
<span> you will light a few neurons before you call plastics for a procedure that only helps </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>get rid of a complicated patient for a few days. Mmh-kay?" She smiled wide, "We appreciate your effort." </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked down at their chief, who looked almost as pissed at his colleagues as she’d felt at getting called in for the case. She shrugged apologetically, hands raising at her sides to gesture defeat</span>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"But let’s make this a teaching moment, shall we? The resident who hands in the best plan of action for plastics on this patient-I wanna know graft or flap, how, where, when, blood supply, tension, </span>
<em>
<span>everything-" </span>
</em>
<span>she waved an index at the residents, "</span>
<span>whichever of you does an acceptable job will scrub in with me when I finally cut…" she let it linger for a moment, "partially as first operator," and their faces shot up, <em>"</em></span>
<em>
<span>if </span>
</em>
<span> you general surgery guys ever manage to treat the wound." She crossed her fingers up next to her face as she made a toothed smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When her eyes fell on the annoying woman who’d been sitting to her left, her smile almost fell. As everyone else in the room looked away or frowned, she was smirking, eyes darker than before, and Agatha felt her control slip by the slightest of threads.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned back to the chief, patted his shoulder in a familiar gesture as she jokingly apologized about the situation, then strode out the room without a second thought. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Billy, of course, was after her, perfectly timed as he handed her her half empty coffee cup.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Did you see the new resident?" Billy asked as he skipped next to her along the corridors. They came to a halt in front of the elevators.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What new resident? Isn’t it too late for interns this time of year?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You don’t know?" </span>
<span><em>Obviously</em> she didn't know. </span>
<span>Billy’s eyes widened to twice their size, mouth dropped open, but Agatha felt too nice today to tease him about it. "They transferred a resident from another hospital. She was sitting next to you…"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew why his speech was dying out at the end of that sentence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, that one! Hmm, I hate her." Her tone dripped honey, but Billy knew better than to not take her seriously. </span>
<span>They greeted some nurses as they entered an elevator, Carl… Coral? And, ugh, the other one was new. She’d have to ask for her name again; if they found out she didn’t remember, she’d never live it down. She’d have a month of endless venous catheters and blood tests on the nurses account.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why did they transfer her this late? Give me all the juicy details, Teen."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy’s cheeks reddened a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Please don’t call me that…" He nervously looked around the elevator, even though no one could care less. Even less where Agatha was involved; she tended to have this effect when she walked around the hospital. People turned away and silently minded their business. Well, to be fair they </span>
<em>
<span>were</span>
</em>
<span> probably listening, but they'd learnt to hide it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"And I don’t know why, no one knows. She’s a fifth year too, why transfer less than three months from the end of her residency program?" He raised his shoulders as they got off the elevator. "She’s the talk of the moment, but no one knows anything."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fourth floor, Agatha’s favourite, and she felt her shoulders relax as they walked into white and lilac corridors. The place, other than the ORs, was basically her work-home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She let the topic Billy was yapping on about drop, switching to work as soon as they entered consulting room 14.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let’s get rid of these follow-up visits, we don’t even have that many today. We’ve got that kid with syndactyly this afternoon, yeah?" They both sat down behind the desk, and Billy nodded as he accessed his account on the pc and called in the first patient. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha relaxed against her chair. It was going to be an easy day and she’d be home by eight, nine tops, she repeated as if it were a mantra. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They had barely over a half hour for lunch, and that was more than the usual. Agatha slid into a chair next to Jen, stretching her legs under the table as Wanda and Lilia greeted her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She saw Billy in the distance scurrying over to the other residents, and </span>
<em>
<span>of course</span>
</em>
<span> he’d sit next to the new one, the golden retriever that he was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl was basically lying on the table, head lying on crossed arms, but Billy didn’t take that as a hint to stay away, and he started animatedly gesticulating as he probably talked her EEG flat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hadn’t she been so annoying earlier, Agatha might have pitied her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Harkness, I heard you gave general surgery a pep talk this morning," Lilia made her attention snap back to the conversation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a dry laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Who came crying to you, </span>
<em>
<span>boss</span>
</em>
<span>?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You wish I were your boss." Lilia sipped on her drink, but she couldn’t hide her smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, no, why do you say that? You know how I love our esteemed chief of surgery," Agatha playfully widened her eyes and took a forkful of her salad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah well, if I were your boss, I’d probably hate you." Jen interjected, and Wanda chuckled. "Wait, I do hate you!" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span> me, Jen."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen scoffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I swear, medicine got all the luck with Lilia, and we were left with that…"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’ll stop you right there, before you say something about my fellow chief. What’s happened to you anyways, handing out compliments? I should be flattered." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"You should be <em>so </em>flattered."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Movements caught her attention, and her eyes wandered over to the residents table again. Many of the residents were researching something on their ipads or phones as they ate, and she was pretty sure the fuss a couple of them were making was over the promise she’d made to let them scrub into her surgery. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They were so excited it was almost cute. She’d actually been surprised at the restraint Billy had shown all morning, managing not to get caught researching on his phone more than twice. Unfortunately for him, he hadn’t had any free time for that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The new resident was showing Billy something on her phone now, with him briefly fixing his hair in what could have been an embarrassed gesture, and Agatha narrowed her eyes suspiciously. Then, as if feeling her stare, bitch-socks looked up at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead of embarrassedly looking away as any fairly smart person would, she stared directly at Agatha, lips curling up into the shadow of a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Billy caught up by following the direction his new friend was looking, Agatha turned away. She almost wanted to get bitch-socks assigned to her now. As soon as she got her hands on her, she’d teach her what terror was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You’re like a month from term Wanda, just-why overwork yourself so much when you can get extra holidays?" Jen was pestering Wanda about her maternity leave again. She had a point-Wanda’s pregnant belly was <em>enormous</em>, and watching her waddle around the hospital had become kind of comical. But the woman really loved her job. <em>That</em>, Agatha could respect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Obgyn is on the 3rd floor, Jen, in case you want to switch specialties." Agatha huffed out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda patted her hand, smile too sweet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It’s ok Agatha, she just worries." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, like, every single day she’s pestering you!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen elbowed her ribcage, and Agatha couldn’t help but laugh over the pain.</span>
</p><p>***</p><p>
<span>Unsurprising: as research from desperate-to-cut residents started to slide into her hospital mail in the next couple days, Billy’s job was </span>
<em>
<span>by far</span>
</em>
<span> the best. </span>
<span>Mildly interesting: the new resident never sent anything. Suspicious: she’d seen them bending over screens together more than once. She’d even seen one of her own papers on flaps open on a laptop once, in front of the new resident.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the time came, in the midst of whining little doctors, she requested Billy for the flap surgery. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Irritating: the new resident didn’t even flinch. </span>
<em>
<span>She high-fived Billy</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was just perfect. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"So, the flap is scheduled for tomorrow." said Wu, the chief resident, "as for today…" she went on to list which residents would be assigned to which attendings, and Agatha thanked the gods she’d exceptionally decided to grace the smelly changing room with her presence, cause now she got to have fun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Change of plan, kids," she interrupted Alice as she was sending the residents off, assigning her Darcy Lewis, "I’m taking </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>." She pointed at the new resident, who lazily stopped in her tracks to look at Agatha. "About time we made friends, right?" She smiled broad, and Alice nodded. In the back, a few residents started whispering excitedly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Vidal, you heard her. Lewis, with me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha strode away, already savoring the satisfaction of having that brat run after her all day long, she couldn’t help but overhear a resident whisper: “</span>
<em>
<span>The Purple Witch choose a new prey</span>
</em>
<span>”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her smile grew wider.<br/>
Let them talk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Needless to say, it wasn’t that satisfying when the brat in question looked so relaxed one could think she was on a field trip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hi, I’m Rio." She said once Agatha stopped for an elevator, holding a hand out for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored it, and all she did in response was purse her lips and let it fall back down. "I thought you wanted to make friends."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, she was a funny one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Figure of speech, darling." She pressed the elevator button again, impatient. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"It’s ok, you don’t need to tell me your name. I know who you are."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, do you? I could have sworn my reputation had flown over your head with the way you were behaving." She sounded icier than she’d intended. Well, let it serve her purpose. But the resident-Vidal-was smiling as she climbed into the elevator after her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Should I be flattered you noticed me?" She leant a shoulder against the wall as they went up, and Agatha’s stomach churned in annoyance. "You see, I’m a big fan of yours. I’ve read all your papers, you </span>
<em>
<span>overachiever</span>
</em>
<span>." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot a fast look to her left where Vidal was openly staring at her, eyes twinkling. She had the widest eyes, huh. They made her look like a manic deer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That’s rich." The elevator blinked to a stop and Agatha stepped off, Vidal sliding to her left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your interest must be why you haven’t submitted a proposal for the flap tomorrow. Or are you simply too good for plastics?" She smoothed her tailored skirt with a hand as she opened the door to her office, then gave the resident a sardonic smile as she went and sat behind her glass desk. "Close the door."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal complied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a seat to the other side of her desk-weird, those were for patients or whoever had a meeting with her-and comfortably leaned back in it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I already know I’m going to be a trauma surgeon, so why take someone else’s opportunity?" she played with the dark green stethoscope falling from her neck, turning the chest piece around the stem, and Agatha glanced at her twice. She was a fifth year, she was allowed to know what she wanted. Hell, it was </span>
<em>
<span>encouraged</span>
</em>
<span>. Still…</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This is not just any surgery, it’s complicated by several factors, something you might not get the chance to see again, especially as you move on to trauma. And-what, it’s not enough for you?" Agatha barely glanced at her as she accessed her work desktop. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’ve already done a symilar one, beginning to end."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finished opening up her patients list, then leaned back into her amazingly comfortable, specifically selected by her, black leather swivel chair. She folded her hands on her lap and stared right at the resident.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Is that why you handed your work to Billy?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>That one took a hit. </span>
<em>
<span>Finally</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha could watch the flicker of surprise change Vidal’s face. She even sat up a little straighter. A win for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think… he could have done it all by himself." She tried, leaning forward like she was playing a particularly interesting hand in a game of cards. Agatha scoffed, eyebrows shooting up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>Please</span>
</em>
<span>, he’s good, but not that good. He’s just a second year."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal made a little sly smile. "Oops," she said, like she’d been caught with her hand in the lollipops jar. "Why did you give it to him then?" She was still leaning forward, dark eyes staring at Agatha in a way that was just a touch unsettling. Like she was trying to see through her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Because," Agatha leaned forward too, "None of your business." And she flashed her a toothed smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She only lingered for a moment before her eyes went back to the screen, signaling to Vidal that the conversation was over. She checked a couple appointments and then stood up, pushed her chair back and gestured for the resident to sit in the one next to it. She was not about to let her use her </span>
<em>
<span>personal</span>
</em>
<span> ergonomic chair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Since you’ve done every surgery in the world, I thought you might do with rounds and paperwork too. If you’ve got any questions, don’t find me. You know where the patients are." And she left her with an inhuman amount of charts to update and lame ass informed consents to fill in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>To her credit, Vidal didn’t even try to complain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p>
<span>A short, well paid blepharoplasty later (the hospital </span>
<em>
<span>loved</span>
</em>
<span> those), still in her the purple scrubs and clogs she’d changed into for the surgery, Agatha went to check on Vidal’s progress. Sure, a fifth year was supposed to be competent, and </span>
<em>
<span>sure</span>
</em>
<span>, Jen had said she was good-which coming from her meant something, even though Agatha would never admit it. Still, she wasn’t about to let a new resident do the rounds without checking for mistakes-she wasn’t a psychopath. Plus, every hospital and every ward had their little variations on how they did things-filling charts, for example-and Vidal was doomed to mess up Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal wasn’t in her office, and Agatha moved on to look for her in the ward. After a couple rooms, there she was, visiting one of her favorite patients. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah, ok, she shouldn’t have favourites. Whatever. She was only human.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leant against the doorframe. Bitch-socks was changing the little kid’s wound dressing, giving Agatha her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The kid was around ten years old, a shy girl with messy, curly black hair. It wasn't her being a kid that Agatha liked-it was something else. She was quiet, she didn't complain, she wasn't a pain in her ass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the kid's much older brother cut some wood with an axe, she’d put her hand on a log, and he’d accidentally amputated two of her fingers. Lucky for her, the cut had been clean, and they’d come to the ER in time to fix her up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kid looked up at Agatha with big black eyes which widened in fear, and Vidal, who’d been talking to her to distract her, followed her stare and turned around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don’t worry Doris, she’s not here to do surgery on you again." She paused, gaze lingering on Agatha, "She just likes to watch me work." she looked so smug Agatha would have loved to smack her, but it did seem to calm down the child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too bad smacking residents wasn't allowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As bitch-socks went back to her job, Agatha moved closer. She took some disposable gloves from a cart and slipped them on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hey, I take it you remember me." She smiled at the kid and Doris nodded. "Did your brother take you the books you wanted?</span>
<span>"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shifted closer to Vidal, careful to leave a little distance, and without a heads-up she moved back the dressing Vidal had started to make. The resident let her, hands lingering around hers as she waited for Agatha to check on the wounds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I took pictures," she said when Doris was finished answering, and Agatha briefly glanced at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"What, do you expect me to congratulate you?" she felt Vidal shift to watch her, "Still better to take a look myself. Keep going," She looked up at Doris. "Did you get breakfast this morning? They told me there was jelly!" and the kid nodded. "Do you like jelly?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s hands were fast but precise, and Agatha distractedly passed her some medical tape. Doris was listing the jelly flavors she liked, which meant she was not concentrating on the discomfort bitch-socks was causing her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"She told me nurse Jack even gave her stickers with breakfast," Vidal added when the list was over, and Agatha passed her the scissors. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, I’m </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>jealous, can I see them?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Doris pushed a book at her, its cover filled with animal stickers, Vidal looked up at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Would you say you're a jealous person then?" She smirked a little. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pretended like she hadn’t spoken. </span>
<span>Doris seemed to forget all about her shyness and forced her to point at her favourite animals. Lucky for her, by the time she’d jokingly refused to choose between a kangaroo and an owl cause they were both </span>
<em>
<span>too cool</span>
</em>
<span>, Vidal was done. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>fine</span>
</em>
<span>, the dressing was great, but it was too easy a job to mean anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your parents will come visit you soon, and in a couple days you can go home to Lady Cawley, okay?" Lady Crawley was her dog-and the name of some fictional character Agatha had forgotten all about, but somehow she remembered that  dumb name. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave the kid a reassuring pat on her arm and left the room, Vidal enthusiastically high-fiving Doris before following her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"So you’re not a total bitch, huh? Are kids your soft spot?" Vidal asked in an amused tone, and Agatha immediately spun on her heels and cornered her with her stance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Bitch-socks didn’t bulge. She smiled, seemingly enjoying the closeness. <em>Annoying.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you trying to get fired? What makes you think you can talk to your superior like that, bitch-socks?" and </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, she shouldn’t have called her that. That exposed her. She wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> good at keeping her temper level, and this brat was unhinged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m sorry, I thought you wouldn’t care." she held her hands up in surrender, but still looked way too relaxed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"How? You’ve talked to me twice."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Billy talks about you, </span>
<em>
<span>a lot. </span>
</em>
<span>Like, the kid is genuinely obsessed." she looked down at Agatha’s neck, probably to her necklace, and Agatha gave in to the need to physically retreat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ok, the praise might have made her feel a little more generous. Whatever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don’t do that again."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What, talk about you? I can’t stop him, and I gotta admit it’s pretty interesting." she tilted her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course it would be interesting. Agatha smirked to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, not that, don’t play dumb." Why would she mind people talking about her? She relished it, really. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, okay, sorry." Vidal pursed her lips and had the decency to actually look a little regretful. But then she smiled again. "… Bitch-socks?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck. It hadn't slipped her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had to turn away before she smacked that stupid smirk off Vidal's face and got </span>
<em>
<span>herself</span>
</em>
<span> fired.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don’t have a soft spot." it was a lie, she had Nicky, but this brat didn’t need to know. "What you saw is called bedside manners, but we’ve established you have an issue with </span>
<em>
<span>manners, </span>
</em>
<span>so, watch and learn."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she strode into the next patient’s room, patting away the annoying thought that she </span>
<em>
<span>had,</span>
</em>
<span> maybe, regretfully, kind of enjoyed how unhinged Vidal had been. </span>
<span>Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> a bitch-a powerful one, and she liked how, as busy and chaotic as hospitals could be, people always minded her and shrunk away from her path when she walked around wards. They respected her, they </span>
<em>
<span>feared</span>
</em>
<span> her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By this time, </span>
<em>
<span>maybe,</span>
</em>
<span> she was in dire need of a challenge. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook the thought off. This shithole must finally be getting to her head, cause no way in hell she’d tolerate-let alone enjoy-a resident standing up to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That night, as she went over the charts Vidal had updated before finally going home to Nicky, she felt a restlessness build up in her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The charts were fucking flawless.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha yawned, barely remembering to cover her mouth, not doing it anyways. </span>
<span>An on-call night after a day at her clinic really made her question her life choices. Why not abandon hospital life entirely? Energy-filled Agatha was an ambitious piece of shit, and she-tired Agatha-had to pay the price. Especially when she got called in for a big emergency.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The clinic was so organized and peaceful, and here…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The first responders barged in and set the rigid backboard with the patient down, a collar around his neck, as they rapidly introduced the case, people buzzing around and doing a million different things at once. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“35-year-old male, high-speed head-on collision. He was ejected from the vehicle and found approximately 20 feet from the car,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>None of the trauma attendings were around, and Agatha frowned. Those fuckers. Wouldn’t be the first time they left a resident to fend for themselves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Conscious but disoriented on arrival, GCS of 10,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the resident was, </span>
<em>
<span>of course</span>
</em>
<span>, because this was doomed to get worse, Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, at least she was a fifth year. She’d seen abandoned first years in similar situations before, and it hadn’t been pretty. Vidal might <em>actually</em> do something right. Or so she hoped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yeah, because Agatha had dared think positive, the residen was currently checking the airway patency, all the while making a mess of the patient’s facial lacerations and likely fractures in the process. Trauma surgeons were, simply put, classless butchers, and Vidal was clearly ready to become one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vitals at the scene were BP 80/50, HR 130, RR 28, SpO2 88% on room air. We did 2 liters of saline and 2 units of O-neg,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Move. I’ll intubate, move on to the rest.” She didn’t even have time to make a snarky comment at how Vidal had been handling the patient’s face, which was just another of the downsides of emergencies. She physically stepped in next to her and Vidal slid away, easily letting her take control as she moved on to check the patient’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Suspected tension pneumothorax, distended abdomen with guarding, multiple abrasions and contusions. No known medical history or allergies, no medications reported.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha re-intubated the patient, because of course the tube had been misplaced by the twelve-year-old looking first responder, Vidal listened to the chest sounds with her stethoscope. Well, apparently a lack of sounds. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She asked for a chest drainage kit and Agatha stopped to look over her, just in case. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Without hesitating, Vidal made a small cut between two ribs at the mid-axillary line, to the patient’s left, to insert the chest tube. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had good hands, Agatha found herself thinking as she went back to concentrating on her own job. And fuck, considering Vidal’s attending was nowhere to be seen (they would regret being alive once Agatha found them), it was also kind of her job to check on the resident.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At a first look, the patient seemed to have at least one open facial fracture, possibly more closed ones. The left maxilla, orbital wall, and nasal bones were exposed, but it was hard to see through the heavy bleeding—as heavily perfused as they were, faces tended to be messy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And where were all the maxillofacial surgeons when they needed one? Night shifts, those fuckers all seemed to vanish.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then </span>
<em>
<span>of course</span>
</em>
<span>, as Agatha worked on stopping the facial bleeding and Vidal did a quick neurological examination, the patient coded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swore, not even trying to keep the volume down. No one would hear her either way. Machines were beeping, her compression on the facial bleeding was doing close to nothing to stop it—a major vessel had to be damaged—and Vidal was suddenly next to the patient, defibrillator paddles in her hands, forcing everyone to move away. Which was really bad for the gushing waterfall-no, bloodfall?-that the damned butchery of a face was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had to let it go.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>”Clear!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Vidal discharged once, a sharp jolt surging through the man's body, lifting him momentarily off the gurney before he collapsed back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The monitor line stayed flat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Again! Clear!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha writhed. She needed to find the source of that bleeding. Vidal shocked the patient again, he was still flat-lining, and Agatha couldn’t just watch anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took the single step to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Give it to me!” She practically tore the defibrillator paddles from her, Vidal so taken by the reanimation she took a second too long to react, and it was enough for Agatha to take over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Charge to three-sixty!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck is your problem?” Vidal practically screamed at her, “I know how to use a stupid defibrillator!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness, it’s…” the nurse started protesting, but Agatha interrupted him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Do it!” The nurse complied, and Agatha pressed the pads against the guy’s chest. “Clear!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all stared in silence, even Vidal. The chaos from before had subsided like it had never even been there, time pausing as they waited for the monitor to show </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Each time this happened, those were some of the longest seconds in Agatha’s life. It felt like she could step away, grab a coffee and come back before anything happened. Come to think of it, it was almost relaxing, which was—</span>
<em>
<span>maybe—</span>
</em>
<span>a borderline psychotic thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The monitor beeped once, then again, a sinus rhythm setting its pace, and Agatha saw Vidal start breathing again in the corner of her eye. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she spared her a glance before going back to the patient’s face, she looked pissed, her eyes dark, but she was focusing on the patient nonetheless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ignoring her, Agatha started packing the patient’s facial wounds to temporarily stop the bleeding before taking him to the OR, stabilizing the main fractures and covering up the exposed bones and tissues with saline-soaked gauze, all</span>
<span> the while Vidal kept sending her the most annoying, distracting piercing stares, as if she were a cat whose tail Agatha had run over with her car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the fifth such glance, Agatha had caught up to her in terms of being pissed off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she was done and the patient was stable, she stood up from her stool, threw her latex gloves into the trash, and </span>
<em>
<span>patiently,</span>
</em>
<span> graciously waited a few seconds for Vidal to be done ordering imaging and an OR. Then, she unceremoniously grabbed her arm and pulled her towards the nearest on-call room, pushing her inside and closing the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ow, what do you want now?” Vidal rubbed at her arm, staring at her with big, mad eyes, shoulders hunched up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were doing it right, ok? You didn’t do anything wrong. Stop looking at me like that.”<br/>
</span>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>I’m sorry I took over”</span>
</em>
<span>, she could have said.<br/>
She didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal seemed to relax nonetheless, shoulders dropping as she took a deep, shaky breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Okay. Sorry I raised my voice, I guess.” She rubbed at her neck, and Agatha’s eyes fell to her fingers, now free from blue latex gloves. Yeah, she’d shown to have good hands in there, fast and steady. Good surgeon hands, and nothing else. Nothing about her thumb pressing into the side of her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away. What the hell. Emergencies played weird tricks on her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”It’s, you know, the adrenaline.” Vidal went on with her unnecessary explanations. Agatha just laid against the windowed wall between two bunk beds, looking up at her, arms crossed against her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t need to apologize, I get it.”<br/>
</span>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Maybe I deserved it anyways”</span>
</em>
<span>. She wouldn’t say that out loud either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess you’re not as bad as your attitude makes you look,” Agatha added, half rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident's eyebrows scrunched, but Agatha could swear the corner of her lips was pulling up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are compliments from you always back-handed?” Vidal stretched her neck against her flexing fingers, and Agatha had to keep herself from staring too long. She huffed to dissimulate any reaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what you mean.” she pushed herself off the wall, uncrossing her arms, and walked past her. “I need coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, aren’t we going to discuss the patient?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened the door and walked out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I still don’t know if you’re as bad as your attitude makes you look!” Vidal called after her and, forcing herself not to smile, Agatha finally turned around. The resident’s head was ridiculously peeking out the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, are you coming?” She gestured for her to follow, well-crafted unimpressed tone and facial expression slipping on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s mouth turned into an “o”, eyebrows raised, and then she skipped after her as if completely forgetting the many “I want to burn you where you stand” stares she’d shot Agatha up until minutes before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, she was weird. That much was clear.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you having?” Agatha tapped her phone against the NFC symbol on the vending machine, and Vidal selected an overly sugared macchiato, because of course she would. Disgusting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” she said as she took her cup and waited for Agatha to get her black coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t even thank me, this shit is liquid poison.” She would have loved to get a decent coffee from the cafeteria, but they didn’t have enough time for that. They needed to get to the OR soon, by the time the nurses and anesthesiologist were halfway done with prepping the patient. But hey, feeding Vidal that shit was a sweet victory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She spun to her, cup in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to give his face a temporary fix as you do the trauma part. Where’s your attending?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal shrugged as she sipped her coffee, a hand reflexively slipping around the phone in her pocket. </span>
<span>“Home, I guess. Sleeping or… doing whatever the grown-ups are up to these days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was so chill about it, chuckling and looking at her coily, Agatha narrowed her eyes. Something was up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They started walking to the stairs, and she had to work hard not to spit out that acidic hell she was throwing down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Did you call them?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Vidal didn’t immediately respond, she looked at her to her left. She was checking the time on her watch, and immediately looked back up at Agatha, ridiculously long lashes batting over eyes heavy with sleepiness. </span>
<span>It usually hit hard right after an emergency, when the adrenaline subsided. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It must be around 3am, but Agatha would rather not get confirmation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, yeah. No, I didn’t call him.” She raised her eyebrows and grinned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to strangle her. She battled the need to scream at her right then and there. If she did it too often, it would lose its effectiveness, and she had a feeling this crazy bitch was going to make her wanna scream often as not. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She counted mentally, trying to level her temper, but only got to three before Vidal pulled lightly on her scrubs at the back of her ribs, making her shiver.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>What the fuck?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where do you get the purple scrubs? It’s cool.” she pursed her lips, fingers grazing the fabric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooo-kay, first of all, don’t touch me,” Agatha spun around and batted her hand away, stopping in her tracks in between staircases, cause personal space, what the hell? And what the fuck was she even shivering about? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? I thought we were besties. Y</span>
<em>
<span>ou</span>
</em>
<span> just grabbed me by the arm and dragged me around the ER in front of everyone.” She shrugged, a sly smile pulling at her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored her. “Second, you have to call your fucking attending. You’ve started working here, what, a week ago? We don’t know what you can take, and it’s a big case.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal didn’t shrink away, didn’t step back. She leaned even closer, and Agatha’s irritation peaked together with a warm sense of unsettlement, low in her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>, I can take it all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was smirking, and the way her name sounded on her lips, so low it was almost whispered, made Agatha’s stomach flip. </span>
<span>Frustrating, cause </span>
<em>
<span>how dare she. S</span>
</em>
<span>he basically growled in response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will address me as Doctor Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck, she was maddening. And they’d have to spend hours in the same OR just now. Hopefully, getting her hands dirty would take her attention off Vidal, make her a little more bearable. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She doubted it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal tilted her head like she’d just said something curious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>”Right, as you prefer. </span>
<span>You</span>
<span> can call me Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Looking disturbingly unfazed, she stepped back and waited for Agatha to start down the stairs again, following after her. At least <em>that</em> she always got right. The following.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha really needed a win. </span>
<em>
<span>Now </span>
</em>
<span>she wanted to break her.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*******</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Very sadly, the surgery was so complicated that she didn’t have time to torture Vidal. It might also not be wise, considering the damned resident was elbow deep in the patient’s abdomen, removing his spleen and dealing with major vessels. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d had nurse Espinosa phone the on-call trauma attending, and they’d said they were on their way. </span>
<em>
<span>That</span>
</em>
<span>, at least, had seemed to annoy Vidal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Watching her work now and then as she looked up from the guy’s face, Agatha found herself doubting the attending was going to be of much help, but of course, you never knew. Attendings were not just supposed to be there for the patient, but also to protect residents from making stupid mistakes that would change their lives forever. And yes, even this irritating brat was worth a few hours of her attending’s sleep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>If he came and took over from Vidal, ruining the fun for her, well-that was just a bonus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like what you’re seeing?” Vidal glanced up at her in the spare seconds she waited to get a clip, bloody hand relaxedly extended to the scrub nurse, and Agatha rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just checking that you don’t murder the patient before your attending gets here, since I’m putting so much effort into making him able to breathe and eat in the near future. Emphasis on future- I kinda need him alive for that.” She gestured to Espinosa to pass her some gauze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, wouldn’t want to waste your time, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Wow</span>
</em>
<span>, this must be the first time we agree on something.” If she hadn’t had a mask on, Vidal would have seen her sarcastic grin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm, 'cause you’re one of the most expensive surgeons in the hospital, right? I'd better speed up.” Vidal chuckled, and Agatha wanted to choke her again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Answering </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>would definitely be a waste of time.” She smiled at her nurse, her tone light. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As anyone but Vidal would have known, money talk in a room full of co-workers was a terrible idea, but apparently her lack of boundaries extended to depths unknown to mankind. Plus, no way she'd let Vidal give anyone here the impression she had any kind of power over her; surely it was already unsettling enough for everyone to have a resident not shrink before her in public. No spooking the babies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before the brat started talking to her again, Agatha asked a nurse to raise the music volume and started humming and singing along as she kept debriding a wound. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, the scrub nurses and Agatha had chosen the music. Of course, Vidal had tried -and failed- to add some songs of her choice. </span>
<em>
<span>Eh</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>******</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately for Agatha, the trauma attending hadn’t taken over from Vidal. He’d come, checked on her work for all of five seconds, approved every single detail of her management plan, and gone to take a nap with a “call me if you need me” and a wave of his hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That had been bad for two reasons: one, Agatha hadn’t gotten her revenge on Vidal for pissing her off so much, and two: she’d had to witness her work for a couple more hours, and she was so good it had forced Agatha to feel some </span>
<em>
<span>respect</span>
</em>
<span> for her. Which was unacceptable and horrifying, seeing as she was an irritating little…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to talk to the family?” Her voice cut through Agatha’s thoughts as she took off her purple surgical cap and crumpled it into her pocket, walking the corridors outside the ORs’ changing rooms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> will talk to the family. You can take everything, right?” She smirked at Vidal, and this time the resident didn’t smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, I’ll do the talking.” She slipped her hands into her pockets, uncharacteristically looking at the floor in silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What a welcome change. Agatha basked in the newfound peace, a relaxed smile on her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They entered the waiting area for relatives and called for Mrs Larson; when she got up, a toddler in her arms and another kid following her, Agatha felt </span>
<em>
<span>exhausted</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course he’d be a father of two. Good for her she didn't have to be the one destroying their lives</span>
<span>. Poor Vidal, huh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They took them to one of the private rooms for meetings with relatives, had the wife- a light skinned, dark haired woman in her 30s- sit down across from them, then Agatha crossed her arms and looked at Vidal. The little girl in front of her was holding her mother’s coat so tight, Agatha couldn’t help but think of Nicky pulling at her clothes whenever he was nervous. She didn’t really wanna watch that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry I had to take my daughters, I didn’t have anyone to…” the woman broke off, voice cracking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”It’s alright,” said Agatha when Vidal looked down at the kids but didn’t reply. Weird. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, Vidal started to explain: “Your husband is stable. As you know, he was in a car accident which caused major abdominal organs damage, but it’s under control, and we’re feeling positive about him pulling through this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman was clearly still terrified, but her eyes softened a touch, which in turn made her look more tired.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He had severe spleen damage, which can cause profuse bleeding that’s a risk for his life, so we had to take his spleen out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The little girl looked worried out of her mind, but Vidal was just looking at her mother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She went on to explain the rest of the issues, including rib fractures and the tension pneumothorax, and Agatha just knew that kid was hearing too much. When Vidal was done with everything but the patient’s face, the girl looked up at her, big brown eyes watery with oncoming tears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is daddy going to be ok? He told me we're going to the park tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Vidal stared at her, face blank. Agatha frowned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took over. “Doctor Vidal—Rio, is an incredible surgeon. I watched the whole time as she was taking care of your dad, and you can trust me: he’s so lucky to have her.“ she smiled at the kid, leaned forward and offered her a hand, which she took so fast it felt like she‘d been waiting for something to hold on to, even as her mother was hugging her shoulders to her side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He won’t be able to go to the park for a while, but you can probably see him in a day or two, alright?” The patient was full of tubes and would be unconscious for a while; definitely not an experience for children. Agatha knew it personally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But Rio told my mommy that we can see my daddy now!” the kid was on the verge of tears, and Agatha ignored how intent Vidal’s look on her was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry sweetie, your dad is very tired, he can only see your mom today. We need to let him rest, ok?” she let the kid squeeze her hand harder than such a small child should be able to; “can you do that for Rio and me, please?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kid pouted, small dark eyebrows knitting together, but after a few seconds she gave in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You promise I can see my daddy after he naps?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “As soon as he can have visitors, you will be the first to know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She seemed satisfied by the answer and dropped her hand, so Agatha went on with explaining her plan for the patient’s face, trying to keep it as impossible to understand for a child as she could. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once they were done, she squeezed Mrs Larson’s shoulder as she weakly thanked them, and they went their separate ways. That had been a long family meeting, and there would be more. Many more. </span>
<em>
<span>If</span>
</em>
<span> everything went as hoped and he made it, the patient would have to adjust his lifestyle by a lot. For starters, he was already missing his spleen, and his face was not going to be the same.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook the thoughts off; she needed a break. But first, she needed to take care of something. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to Vidal, who looked to be distractedly going towards the changing rooms, and grabbed her arm; Vidal turned to her, seemingly spooked by the interruption of whatever thoughts she’d been mulling over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come outside?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyebrows furrowed, but she nodded so fast it was almost endearing. Or, wait, <em>embarrassing</em>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Funny how little she was talking now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They went out a door to an isolated alley that was used to transport stuff in and out the hospital, a place Agatha knew she could relax, and she laid against a wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Vidal untied the bun she’d made to fit her hair in the surgical cap, Agatha took her e-cig out of her scrubs pocket—she’d gotten it from the changing rooms as they’d passed through them as they left the ORs, and took a short puff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Vidal’s hair pooled softly around her shoulders; she messed it up by threading her fingers through her roots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You smoke? That’s…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Spare me.” She interrupted her, ”I’ve heard it all. Yeah, it’s terrible, and I’m a horrible influence on “the kids”,” she made air quotes with both hands, ”but at least I’ve switched to e-cig, and…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you read the research? E-cig is just as bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took another puff and was really tempted to let the vapor out in Vidal’s face, but unlike her, she was a </span>
<em>
<span>professional</span>
</em>
<span>, so she didn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, the day you find something that can help me let off some steam in this hellhole so I don’t end up taking out someone’s eyes, which in this case would probably be yours,” she’d taken a hand to the side of her mouth for that last past as if telling her a secret, then continued: “you can phone me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled a big, sarcastic smile at her, and Vidal gazed intently into her eyes, thoughtful. It was kind of unsettling when she stared like that, but Agatha didn’t look away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal uncrossed her arms then, a smirk pulling at her lips and making her look way less spent, and she took a half step too close to her. “I can think of a way or two, off the top of my head.” Her eyes sparkled. Agatha fought the urge to step away. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Was she fucking flirting? With her superior? Who she didn’t know anything about?</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>To be fair, she had kinda walked right into that one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, she did blow the vapor in her face, but Vidal’s smile just grew as she raised an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah? What ways?” She wanted Vidal to be the one to back down. As she said it, though, she <em>might</em> have been the tiniest bit </span>
<span>afraid</span>
<span> that the unhinged brat would actually step up and say it out loud. When Vidal had the nerve to </span>
<em>
<span>slowly</span>
</em>
<span> look her up and down, Agatha had this worryingly satisfying mental image of getting away, faaaar away from her after shoving her hard against the opposite wall. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Shoving her against a wall. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her heartbeat picked up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily, there either was a limit to her madness or she was feeling generous, because Vidal stepped away. She leant against the wall to Agatha’s left, smug smile still lingering. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck her, it felt like nothing could faze her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, one thing could, but it wasn’t a fun one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was that in the family meeting?” Agatha’s tone was more serious now, but she was still too aware of Vidal’s closeness to her side. She could practically feel the heat radiating from her arm, and the mere thought she noticed was utterly pathetic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not like she hadn’t had little crushes in the hospital before, but—wait, crushes? No way, </span>
<em>
<span>ugh</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do you mean?" Vidal interrupted her thoughts, looking up at some random corner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You know what I mean. The kid."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What about her?" She was totally feigning indifference, that light tone of voice and her eyes roaming. But she couldn't escape Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you going to make me spell it out for you? You looked like you were scared that if you so much as acknowledged her presence, she would swell up and explode in your face."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal took a deep breath and shifted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> told her I’m an amazing surgeon." She turned to Agatha and hid behind a smile again. Did she really think it would be that easy to slip away?</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Again, communication skills. She needed to hear that."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Was it a lie then?" she pouted, and her eyes were so wide it kind of looked cute, and Agatha almost felt like patting her arm or giving her a hug, consequently wanting to climb to the seventh floor and jump off the building.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>Stop it</span>
</em>
<span>. What was going on?" Her tone left no room for arguments; Vidal took another deep breath, she pursed her lips, and finally gathered the courage to stop playing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The kids shouldn’t have been there. It sucks that there was no one available to look over them as we talked to their mother."</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Whiny</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha refrained from making fun of her in that specific moment, but it was </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> hard. She was being such a good person, she totally deserved a Nobel Peace Prize.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But they were there. And that wasn't the best way to manage them."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal crossed her arms on her chest but didn’t look away from her.</span>
</p><p><span>"Look, they hate us, Ag… Doctor Harkness." Agatha almost mourned the loss when she didn’t use her name. </span><em><span>What the fuck was going on with her?</span></em> <span>"They’ll remember us forever as the surgeons who told them everything was going to change, and they’ll hate us. Or be scared of us, or both."</span></p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could answer, Vidal continued:</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’ve tried before, it’s obviously not the first patient I have who has kids. The adults hate us, but they understand, most of them anyways, after a while. But the kids… There’s no way for them to wrap their heads around the fact they’re losing their father or mother or sister, or…"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers found her forearm, a gesture that came natural to her after years of comforting patients and their families. It felt a little different now, more vulnerable on her part, and it threw her off. She wished she hadn’t done that, not with that resident. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Stupid habits betraying her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s arms twitched like she was going to uncross them and she’d changed her mind. But the back of her fingers was touching Agatha’s wrist now, and she didn’t move them away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pretended not to notice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She also pretended not to notice when her own thumb swept over Vidal’s forearm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The easiest part to not notice was how she wasn’t taking her hand back either. Of course, she was just doing this out of the kindness of her heart-no further motives. There was no pathetic tightening of her chest at Vidal’s fingers brushing her wrist, and certainly no compassion at her sad, deep brown eyes, which flickered down… to her lips?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes lingered for a few long seconds, until Agatha took her hand off her and leaned away. Her brain needed a factory reset, thank you very much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"They could surprise you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal looked back up to her eyes, lost, until realization softened her eyebrows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, well. They always can, I guess. People in general." She uncrossed her arms and rubbed her scalp. "That’s the magic, right?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, mind wandering over memories of her past work experiences.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I guess I’m just tired," Vidal added.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her for a spare second before answering, and she knew Vidal needed an excuse to hide away from what she’d said. So, the saint that she was, she provided.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"We say a lot of stuff after a night shift. Part of the fun, isn’t it?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, no," Vidal’s eyes opened wide and she smiled like a maniac, "the fun is having my arms covered in blood up to at least here," she showed her a point that was almost at her shoulder. Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shut up, you trauma butcher."</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both laughed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Vidal openly yawned in the face of her attending, not covering her mouth, and when he just looked surprised, Agatha rolled her eyes. That fucker wasn’t even gonna ask for a drop of respect. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She went on briefing the day-shift team about the joint trauma-plastics case they’d had, making it as fast as possible so she could finally leave. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she was almost done, Vidal, who was rigorously sitting to her left as she enjoyed pissing her off even this late in the shift, leaned in to look at the labs on the papers in front of her. A subtle smell of shampoo or something caught Agatha's attention, Vidal's hair tickling her arm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was so sleepy, her defenses so low, a thought seeped through her brain that the smell was kind of soothing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Vidal touched her arm, Agatha’s head snapped to her-as fast as it could right now, which was not that fast—as she realized she’d gotten distracted and missed something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"<em>What</em>?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sounded colder than intended, and Vidal's eyes widened slightly, a faint smile on her lips. She withdrew her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oops."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone was watching them, but Agatha was too tired to verbalize the thought that they should close their mouths unless they wanted to eat some flies for breakfast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I meant: say again?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You forgot to mention the orbital fracture to Maxillo." Vidal was still leaning towards her, and Agatha hated it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you, a plastic surgeon now? Stick to your side. I was just getting there."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Sure," she raised her hands up beside her face, palms out, definitely looking too smug and not too sorry. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made a point to remark every single time Vidal missed a detail during her report, and by the time they were done, she was feeling positively avenged. So much so that when they walked out of the meeting room, she was overtaken by generosity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Breakfast before going home?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal was so surprised she was asking, she actually glanced around to check if she was talking to someone else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Suure," she answered then, and Agatha caught the glimpse of a smile. Yeah, Vidal’s features were cute when she smiled. And </span>
<em>
<span>god</span>
</em>
<span>, she really needed to sleep, cause these intrusive thoughts were disgusting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time they’d gotten to the cafeteria, Agatha couldn’t stand herself anymore. After she'd forced Vidal to order for herself, she just asked for a decaf black coffee, paid for everything and followed Vidal to a table, but didn’t sit down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why are you always paying? It’s unfair," the resident complained.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh honey, what’s unfair is the amount of money you newborns get paid, and as you pointed out in a room full of personnel, I have it coming out of my ass." She shrugged as she waved a hand. "Don’t worry, you’re not special. I do this for the others, too." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal raised a smug eyebrow at her. Ok, maybe that last part had been flirting. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Actually, you know what? </span>
<em>
<span>Not ok</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not a newborn." She pointed to herself, "Almost 30." And why she felt the need to point that out, Agatha didn't know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don’t care. All residents are babies."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’ll be an attending in less than three months." She mock-pouted. "Are you going to sit down? You’re creeping me out." But her lopsided grin said otherwise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, then fake-smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No. See you never!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wiggled her fingers at Vidal and, basking in the confused look on her face, she walked away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky would love it if she made it home in time to take him to school-rigorously driven by a driver, cause she wasn’t about to fall asleep on the wheel and kill her son. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought of seeing his little face beam up at her warmed her chest. And just like that, she’d forgotten everything about the shift.<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, almost everything.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha got two full days of rest. Doomed to be a zombie for at least the first 24h, she had to keep Nicky’s manny around. <br/>
</span>
<span>And then, all too soon, it was hospital time again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Two blissfully peaceful days, asking her 4-year-old son about his new school best friends, taking baths, reading, always made it hard to go back.<br/>
</span>
<span>Two full days of freedom from Jen saying things like: “I’m taking Vidal tomorrow”, and “ever thirsted after one of them?” as she tipped her chin towards the chirping residents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, life was good when Jen wasn’t withing earshot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What is this about?" Lilia mused over her lunch, and Agatha really didn’t care what Jen had to say. "Is this related to taking Vidal?" Lilia continued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha choked on her salad. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Wanda patted her back, Jen snorted at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"About time you choked to death. And no, it’s not about Vidal, I just like the way she works. Unlike most residents, she makes my job easier."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Who is it about then?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Answer my question first, Lilia."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The older doctor chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It’s happened, yeah. We’re just human, right? Doesn’t necessarily mean we act on it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But did you? "Wanda beamed curiosity at her, and Lilia laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Wouldn’t you like to know?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not really, "said Agatha. No one listened. But she secretly did want to know, just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Something might have happened many years ago. I’d been an attending for a little over ten years, and this resident I tried to avoid just kept coming around. It happened, it was a little messy, but when I cut it off, he eventually got over it without too much fuss.” She shrugged, took a bite of her sandwich, “Now, Jen-” her tone left no space for argument.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Jen leaned closer to the table, voice low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think Wu has a crush on me. Is it bad if I enjoy it?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was smiling so bright–just her eyes, not her whole face, but it wasn’t lost on Agatha–and Agatha wanted to throw up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"<em>Yes</em>, really bad," she answered fast, with a grin, earning a dirty look from Jen. Wanda turned to gawk over the surgical residents’ table, Jen slapped her wrist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be that obvious!” she hissed, and Wanda jokingly slapped her back.<br/>
Should have slapped harder<em>.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha shot them a glance, Alice Wu was sitting between Billy and Vidal, the latter laughing her ass off over something Agatha was sure was inappropriate at best, because Billy’s face was the color of a ripe tomato.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Do any of the other residents ever flirt with you? "The words left her mouth without much thought, and Lilia eyed her suspiciously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Lilia knew her audience. She was maybe the best judge of character Agatha had ever met; as such, she knew not to ask her too many questions, and she kept her doubts to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not lately, "said Wanda, and Agatha laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Honey, you’re basically ten years pregnant. That might put most people off."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shrugged, a small fond smile down at her belly, rubbing a hand on it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I just have Alice making eyes at me over surgeries. "Jen’s eyes pierced Agatha, and she obviously wasn’t as people-reading smart as Lilia-"Why, who’s flirting with </span>
<span>you</span>
<span>?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha immediately feigned the greatest possible indifference.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Me? Do you know me at all? They’re scared shitless to even talk to me. How could they flirt? "She grinned, basked in the chuckles she’d prompted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She technically hadn’t said no–and Jen might not have noticed, but Lilia’s judging eyes roaming on her said otherwise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You’re horrible," Jen said, and Agatha giddily agreed. When Wanda joined Lilia in observing her for a few seconds after the exchange, she thought she hadn’t done too good a job at looking indifferent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Later that day, she was idly puffing on her e-cig, wishing away the irritation from all the rich as fuck patients that had bugged her about minor inconveniences all afternoon. Five minutes of alone time wouldn’t be enough to recharge her, but she’d take what she could get. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Another puff out, she crossed her legs and draped an arm over the back of the bench. Pulling strings to get a bench and a few plants on this roof had been the best of ideas-s</span>
<span>he had many of those. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had closed her eyes, head falling back and basking in the sunlight, when a voice startled her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her head shot up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh god, </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>."</span>
</p><p>
<span><em>She</em> was walking towards her, Vidal, phone in hand. She sat down next to her, clearly not taking the hint when Agatha spread her arm further along the bench to take more space, actually forcing her to remove it or else she’d be sitting against it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Happy to see you too." She sat down facing her, a leg bent on the bench, knee almost touching Agatha’s side. One hand encircled her own ankle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What do you want? This is plastics-my territory. Go away."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she was dead serious, not even the hint of a joke in her voice, but the demon incarnate that was Vidal chuckled brightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It's as much my territory as it is yours. Maybe more so."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What?" That didn’t make any sense.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hmm." Vidal shrugged and laid her head against her hand, elbow on the back of the bench.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"O-kay, you’re just crazy. Nothing you say should be taken seriously, right?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Maybe. "she sang-songed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t look at her, but she </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> she had one of those stupid smug smiles plastered on her stupid smug face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She kept puffing on her e-cig in silence, piercing holes into a vase as the resident shamelessly stared at her. She was certainly not giving up her favourite spot for her. Time for an evil plan to make Vidal leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then, the resident finally stated her business.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I checked on the trauma from the other night, thought you might want an update."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She unlocked her phone and handed it to Agatha, labs open on it. And well, that was kind of thoughtful of her-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha went over the labs fast, only getting a general idea of the patient’s wellbeing: she was just interested in whether she’d be doing the reconstruction or not. Whether the guy was going to make it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Looks pretty good."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. I also took pictures for you,” and she leaned in to open the pics on her phone as Agatha held it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was that softly sweet, fresh smell again, and when her fingers accidentally brushed Agatha’s thumb over the screen, she withdrew from the touch by reflex. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal paused, looked up at her, but didn’t lean back. </span>
<em>
<span>Of course</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha loved her personal space. Vidal also loved Agatha’s personal space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked at the pictures, trying to ignore the tingling to her side where the resident was only inches away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Great. Also, you could have sent me all of this by text, did you know? Texts are these short messages that you can type on your phone and send to people who also have phones…"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal chuckled. </span>
<span>"Are you trying to give me your phone number?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha couldn’t believe she’d actually said that. She locked her mobile, let it dangle between two fingers as she slipped it in the scrub pocket over Vidal’s heart, and looked directly at her for the first time on that terrace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes, lighter than usual in the sunlight, were sparkling with mischief. Not amusing, fuck her very much. But-were her eyes actually hazel? Huh...</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can ask my secretary for my number, as all the other good boys do."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal didn’t answer right away, lips dropping half an inch open, and Agatha could swear her pupils were swallowing the brown center of her irises. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And what the hell was that twist in her stomach?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked away, heart rate picking up a little. Crossing her arms protectively over her chest, she raised the e-cig to her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Can I get that? "Vidal pointed at it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned at the rapid change in vibe. "What? Of course not." Crazy bitch. They were not a couple of friends sharing vapes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Come on, please? "she tilted her head, batted her lashes, and Agatha side-eyed her. That felt like one of her own moves–which was why it would never work on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I thought you didn’t smoke."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don’t," She was beaming, hand out, palm up. "Come ooon."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ugh, fine. If it makes you leave any faster." and she </span>
<em>
<span>actually</span>
</em>
<span> handed it to her. Which was crazy, yes. Maybe that move did work on her just a little-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could feel fully disgusted at herself, Vidal stood up, slipped the e-cig in her pocket, and Agatha’s mouth dropped open as she started walking away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What the hell do you think you’re doing? "She was after her in two seconds, and in another she was blocking her way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Vidal being Vidal, she was ok with physically walking into her, and Agatha had to move away in an attempt to keep a shred of professionalism.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you fucking crazy?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal turned back to her, a big, unbearable smirk on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Game recognizes game."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Give it back this second, or help me god I will ruin your life." She spun her around and tried to reach for the e-cig. Vidal pulled it away above her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Tell you what, you give me your phone number yourself, I’ll give it right back."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was unsure whether to strangle her or push her off the side of the terrace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"T</span>
<em>
<span>ell you what</span>
</em>
<span>, give it back right now, you don’t lose your job."</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal pursed her lips and looked up in fake thought, then she tapped her index finger to her chin, humming. </span>
<span>"Hmmm, no. I think you're bluffing. You like me too much."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed. </span>
<span>"That's never stopped me from getting what I wanted, darling." She wiggled the fingers of the hand she'd been holding out, realizing her mistake too late. "And I </span>
<em>
<span>don't</span>
</em>
<span> like you," she tried to correct, but Vidal was positively beaming. "If anything, I spend every moment you're close wondering if murdering you would be considered self-defense. I think it should."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal wasn't impressed by her try at deflection, and only snorted lightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You’re the funniest."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha was so done with not being taken seriously.<br/>
</span>
<span>Her chest burned in anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fine, whatever. Keep it as a souvenir for the day you're jobless and want to reminisce on the good old times. I'll just buy another." She shrugged, dipped her hands in her pockets, and with her shoulder hitting Vidal's as strong as she could, she walked back inside the hospital.</span>
<span><br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fucking hell, she needed to get rid of that bitch.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Needless to say, she couldn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Come on, Agatha, so she’s a little weird, don’t take our acceptable interns from us. "Jen rolled her eyes, Agatha’s frown deepened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you listening to me? She </span>
<em>
<span>stole</span>
</em>
<span> from me. The disrespect-"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why did you give her your e-cig in the first place? Sounds to me like she asked and you said yes."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds to me,” Agatha mock-imitated her, gesticulating, “You’re missing the point entirely!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen raised her eyebrows at her, and Agatha wanted to dig a hole in the ground and lie down forever. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Better yet, Jen should.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Agatha, do you </span>
<em>
<span>like</span>
</em>
<span> her? I haven’t seen you in such a frenzy over a coworker in-ever. And over such a small thing."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha growled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m going to </span>
<em>
<span>accidentally</span>
</em>
<span> spill my coffee on your face."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen shrugged. "You’d do terribly in prison, bitch. No baths, no skincare, no luxuries…"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m not </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>, Jen. I’d do great in prison. I’d be the queen of all bitches. Probably build a criminal empire. Have a lesbian army at my back."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen shot her an unimpressed look, but didn’t deny it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't you dare touch my face, Harkness."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident following Jen around that day, a short, blonde-haired guy, was very obviously trying not to look at Agatha as he patiently stood beside them in the break room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha growled again, free hand fisting at her side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Is everyone going mad? </span>
<em>
<span>Ugh!</span>
</em>
<span> "and she strode away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>If she told that story, more people might question her relationship with Vidal. There was </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span> relationship, there </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> would be, not in a million years, but fuck her if she was going to let them drill her on it, or believe </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> for even a second. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The world was upside down, nothing made sense, and she just wanted to get through the day and go home.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her next shift, Vidal was still there. Worse so, she was in her department, working with Jen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Knowing it beforehand hadn’t helped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she raised her eyes during the morning meeting, Vidal was staring at her, and she didn’t even look away after getting caught. She waved her hand and smiled like she knew it would piss her off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kept her stare icy, giving nothing back. No reaction was probably the best course of action, right? She just needed to ignore her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Damn, at least she had Wu that day, which meant she might actually get to relax a little.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When the meeting was over, she tried to skip her usual coffee break with Jen, but the evil witch managed to drag her to the cafeteria with some lame excuses such as: “I want to consult you about a patient”. Jen would rather drown herself in mud than ask Agatha for her opinion when it wasn't strictly necessary: that’s how she knew it was actually about Wu. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen wanted to take Wu to breakfast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, her “Sorry, I have a meeting with an important patient” didn’t stop Jen from physically dragging her as she protested that no one ever had those before 9am.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Whatever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Vidal just stood boredly next to Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Oh my god, really? "Alice Wu was looking at Jen, wide-eyed and smiling, as Jen went on with her story. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to roll her eyes out of her skull. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sipped her coffee and tried not to look over the table at Vidal, who–amazingly, thank god–was being as quiet as her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Agatha, do you remember? "Jen, from her right, interrupted her deep stare at that very interesting tree outside the window. Definitely more interesting than this conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That guy! "Jen’s eyes sparkled with joy. </span>
<em>
<span>Ugh</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What guy? "Agatha’s tone couldn’t have been flatter. Jen huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>, the snake guy."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal, who’d been sitting back without engaging, only letting her eyes roam over Agatha as per usual, leant forward and rested her arms on the table. The movement caught Agatha’s attention, and when Vidal’s lips curved imperceptibly up at her, Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> roll her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"The guy who wanted us to make him look like a snake? "She glanced back at Jen, who nodded. "Yeah, that was kind of fun."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen frowned and slapped her arm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"What is </span>
<em>
<span>up</span>
</em>
<span> with you? You’re being so lame."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sipped on her coffee and looked from Jen to Vidal, who was studying her the way you’d watch a monkey in a zoo. Agatha hated zoos.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Maybe I’ve lost my only means for winding down." She was obviously talking about her e-cig, and Vidal quirked an eyebrow as her smile deepened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to Jen. "Maybe I needed that before I used my brain power to listen to another one of your stories, </span>
<em>
<span>Jen</span>
</em>
<span>."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wu chuckled uncomfortably and shot Jen an apologetic look, and her fellow plastic surgeon was so distracted by that she didn’t even bite back a retort. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jesus-fucking-christ</span>
</em>
<span> she was being a teenager. </span>
<span>That was a full-on crush.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she pondered the depth of Jen’s fall into the abyss of pathetic thirsting, she suddenly felt a touch to her foot under the table, her head shooting to Vidal again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She just knew it had been her, and she </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> it had been on purpose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident shielded the side of her mouth from Alice and Jen as she silently mouthed something at Agatha, who, despite herself, leant forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What? "She mouthed back, skeptical, and Vidal’s eyes and head gestured to the two surgeons sitting next to them, still deep in conversation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had to stare at her lips as she repeated what she’d said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>They’re so obvious</span>
</em>
<span>," was what she understood Vidal was saying. She had a small gap between her incisors Agatha hadn’t really noticed before, and her lower lip looked fuller than she remembered…</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Agatha?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her head spun to Jen. Fuck, had she been staring?</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>, did you? "Vidal asked, and Agatha’s eyes narrowed at her, annoyance building up in her chest again. Correcting Vidal would draw attention to the use of her first name, so she didn’t. No other reason.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jen, look, as amazing as reminiscing about our enmity-development adventures is, I’ve got a lot of work to do today. Next time, you can schedule your…" Jen’s eyes widened threateningly, and she refrained from saying “dates” because she was too nice. <em>Or</em> because she liked having something hanging over Jen’s head in case she needed to blackmail her one of these days. "…Charity chats with residents outside my working hours. "</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen sighed, trying to mask the relief as annoyance at Agatha, and Vidal chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed her chair back then, she stood up and curled her index finger at Alice. "Come, chief resident. Let’s put your talents to better use." She laid a hand on Jen’s shoulder, "Sorry we have to cut this short, </span>
<em>
<span>best friend</span>
</em>
<span>!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned and walked away, heels clicking softly against the hospital’s vinyl floors. Wu was quickly at her side.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>So she couldn’t make Vidal’s life hell herself, true. But she was nothing if not resourceful, and she’d find other ways. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tapped the pen against her desk in thought. She was in between patients, one had skipped their follow-up appointment, so she had a little time to think. Wu was diligently taking care of everything else for her, and she knew she could trust her. She’d still check on her work later, especially on the 3rd degree burns patient in pre-op, but for now she was fine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smirked to herself. An idea shaping into her mind, she got up, hooked the pen in her chest pocket, and walked out of her office. She was going to find Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Talking to Jen was as simple as it could be (which meant utterly annoying, but uncharacteristically worth it). She had too many questions, of course, and knowing Agatha wouldn’t answer wasn’t enough to stop her from asking. But after all, she owed her more than one no-questions-asked (more like no-questions-answered, whatever). Agatha liked to stack favours.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That put her in a good mood, so she didn’t stop there: before having to go back to work, she called in a few more favors. She was going to have a blast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All the gods graced her that morning by not having her meet Vidal more than twice, and both times they crossed paths, Vidal barely had time to look up at her. She didn’t smile her dumb grin at her, and Agatha’s wish for her to be having a terrible time seemed to be getting granted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nice. Agatha totally wasn’t missing the attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She went through the surgery that afternoon with Alice doing most of the work, Agatha just assisting her and the third operator, going in and out of the OR to take care of other patients. When she walked in the second time, hands washed and waiting for a nurse to dress her in a sterile surgical gown, she had to roll her eyes.<br/>
</span>
<span>But she was in such a nice mood, the scene only amused her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>Jen</span>
</em>
<span>, terrible seeing you here."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fellow surgeon, who was standing behind Wu in her normal scrubs, careful not to touch her sterile gown, looked up from the surgical table to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not as bad as seeing you, but you’re just who I was looking for." Jen chirped behind her mask, but didn’t leave her position. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha spun around as David, a nurse, held her surgical gown ties and then tied them for her. They handed her sterile gloves in that new brownish grey the hospital had acquired, and she swiftly put them on. The ritual was so familiar she could have done it in her sleep, without breaking sterility.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>Sure.</span>
</em>
<span> "She smirked at Jen behind her mask. "What for?" She got to the table, a hand out for the nurse to hand her a small retractor, and looked at Alice’s work. She’d finished debridement and was now starting to harvest the graft, which was why Agatha had been called.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The surgery was pretty straightforward, a full-thickness skin graft from the patient’s groin to the anterior part of her thigh. She was a 30-something woman with an almost overwhelmingly sunny personality. She’d had a motorbike fall and the exhaust pipe had caused a deep burn to her right thigh, but luckily not much more damage. She’d get away with just a few scars. Big ones, yeah, but Agatha would make sure they were as pretty as possible, a work of art as per usual. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched Wu work, instructing her here and there, as Jen went on about some patients Vidal was taking care of. Agatha knew what she was doing, using that as an exchange: Vidal was on the worst possible cases, and Agatha had to let Jen stay for as long as she wanted, or else she’d fuck that up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen was being a horrible person. Agatha almost had to love her for that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jen, do you know how horrible you are? "she smiled at her, eyes sparkling, and Jen raised her eyebrows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Right back at you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, but keep it up, you might be able to steal the crown. "</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen scoffed, and Agatha continued: </span>
<span>"It was obviously a joke. Don’t touch my stuff."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stayed for a good fifteen minutes. Crazy how much time she could waste… but it was kind of fun to poke and prod her and see her wriggle in fear of Agatha saying too much, working her up until the point she finally left. Yeah, </span>
<em>
<span>sometimes</span>
</em>
<span> Jen was fun.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That evening, Agatha sat across from Wanda and Vision in a booth of the bar closest to the hospital. An emergency had led to her staying longer than expected, which meant Nicky would already be asleep by the time she got home. Might as well stay out a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen was sitting to her left, Lilia at the head of the table to her right. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nursed her almost empty scotch glass, the alcohol already making her feel lightheaded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she tried to steal a fry from Wanda, she got her had patted away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Get your own! I need the extra calories."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I don’t want my own,</span>
<span>" Agatha whined, "They’re unhealthy."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Then don’t eat </span>
<em>
<span>hers</span>
</em>
<span>." Jen rolled her eyes at her, but Agatha couldn’t help but grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know why you’re not having fries. There’s something else you want to eat… or<em>, </em></span>
<em>
<span>someone</span>
</em>
<span>."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh my god, Agatha, that makes it sound horrible!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen widened her eyesin mock shock, the others laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision was sitting with an arm wrapped around Wanda’s shoulders-they’d always been a cute couple.<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha smiled at them, and, <em>bleagh</em>. Must be the alcohol making her sappy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This is so rare, all of us here at the same time." Lilia followed that statement by getting one of Wanda’s fries, to which the younger woman didn’t react. Agatha gaped at them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jen, did you see that? Jen!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shh, shut up!" Jen shushed her in a screamed whisper, a hand moving up to cover her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scraped the hand off her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>What</span>
</em>
<span>?" she whispered back. Jen’s head was half turned to the booth behind them, and everyone’s eyes focused there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>They’re talking about us!"</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Right as she was asking, "</span>
<em>
<span>Who?" </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha tried to look to the other side of their booth, but Jen stopped her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>The residents! I think they haven't noticed we're here!"</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She held Agatha’s head down, and as much as Agatha wanted to slap her hands away, her ears trained on their voices, and she forgot about the rest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, her skin is so flawless it should be illegal!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy’s voice. Jen hand-signed that they were talking about her, Agatha rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"She does have incredible skin, yeah." Alice. "Billy, why do you like Dr. Harkness so much? She’s kind of scary. I mean-not to me..."</span>
</p><p>
<span><em>Liar</em>. Agatha smirked at that, receiving an amused look from Lilia as Wanda and Vision tried to stop each other from laughing out loud like two idiots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"That’s an understatement, he’s basically in love with her. "</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fucking hell. That voice, low and sultry, had to be Vidal’s. Agatha could picture Billy blushing hard at her comment.<br/>
Wait, </span>
<em>
<span>sultry</span>
</em>
<span>? God. The alcohol, it was the alcohol.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"She’s a great teacher, okay? Haven’t you learnt so much from her?" Billy. Agatha found herself smiling fondly at the compliment, but when her view caught Lilia’s knowing look, she wiped the smile away, fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, but Jen is so much more available… Rio, tell him he’s crazy!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause, and Agatha’s heart inexplicably beat a little faster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She heard a little chuckle then, </span>
<em>
<span>her </span>
</em>
<span>chuckle, and Vidal finally spoke:</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I mean, I do see the appeal in Dr. Harkness." Another pause. Hell. "Nothing better than topping someone that dominating." Agatha’s eyes narrowed as she tried to hide any reaction, carefully not looking at any of her friends’ faces. She swallowed hard. </span>
<em>
<span>That unhinged brat.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"I can totally get why Billy is so in love…"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It’s not like that! I’m gay! "Billy blurted out, causing both girls to laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Well, she’s </span>
<em>
<span>hot</span>
</em>
<span>. Maybe you… "</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally freed herself from Jen’s claws, her head popping over the booth as she turned and got up on her knees to be able to see to the other side of the backrest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Thanks, guys." She chirped, smiled wide at them, Billy turning impossibly red, impossibly fast, Alice choking on her beer, and Vidal…</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was sitting to the other side of the backrest across from Agatha, and she looked up at her, eyes gleaming in the low lights. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Next round on me for the free reviews!" Agatha continued, ignoring Jen’s hard slap to her arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stared at Vidal, smirk mirroring hers: apparently, she had no shame. Well, Agatha had kinda figured that out already, but she’d still wished to catch her off guard…</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked closer, eyes narrowing. Was that on her cheeks a blush? </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>God. </span>
</em>
<span>She needed to see more of that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was about to tease her about it when Vidal raised her glass at her, and her drink looked exactly like what Agatha was having.<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Weird</span>
</em>
<span>. It was the most expensive in the bar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her one last, rapid glance before getting up and moving to the bar, pushing Lilia down when she tried to follow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’ll get you another round too, Lil."</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leant against the bar, trying to push away that warmth in her lower abdomen that had settled there at the intensity of Vidal’s stupid eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When a hand settled lightly on her back, she almost jumped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course she’d see that as an invitation to follow her. Agatha mentally choked herself for being that stupid-Vidal’s closeness to her made the tingle on her skin impossible to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Need any help?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned around, and her dumb face was too close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m not taking the drinks myself. You know what table service is?" She sounded amused, definitely not as icy as she’d intended it to be, and Vidal chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Are you always this nice to everyone?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, darling. You get the extra package, no advertisements, 4K and all that."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gestured for the barman when he looked towards her, and he signaled to wait.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I'm a little disappointed you call everyone that." Vidal semi-whispered, her hand slipping away from her back as she sat on a stool to her left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Call them what?" Agatha shifted a little further from her, shooting a look to her booth. Wanda, that evil witch, was watching them. Under Agatha's stare, she smiled a little before looking away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"“Darling”, “honey”. Kinda wish it were special."</span>
</p><p>
<span>She focused back on Vidal. That was some new level of crazy.<br/>
Her eyes were dark, long lashes batting slowly, and she did look a little flushed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"How much have you been drinking?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s smile faltered a little. "Just the one drink. It’s been a long day, Jen had me do the most disgusting and annoying stuff for 12 hours straight… "</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha smirked wide, Vidal frowned a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Boo-hoo." She dried fake tears from her cheeks, "I thought you could take </span>
<em>
<span>everything</span>
</em>
<span> and nothing ever fazed you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s frown deepened. Then, realization dawned on her:</span>
</p><p>
<span>"It was you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha shrugged, smiling wide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Did you really think you could play with me and win? Give back my e-cig, I’ll only keep this up for one month."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal raised an eyebrow at her, looking mildly amused, but before she could answer, Agatha's index finger went under her chin, tilting her face up a little. Vidal froze, lips parted, and she sucked in a small, sharp breath.<br/>
Agatha felt her own chest flush.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I do have a name just for you." She leant in a little. "Do you want to know?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could see Vidal hanging from her lips, and it was<em>-wow. </em>It felt </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span>. She was </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> wrapped around her finger…</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded slowly, dark eyes shifting between Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"You’re a little </span>
<em>
<span>brat</span>
</em>
<span>." Her nail lightly scraped Vidal’s chin as she released her in a smooth motion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal took a few beats to recover, and how </span>
<em>
<span>delicious</span>
</em>
<span> that was.<br/>
Then the corner of her lips twitched, slowly shifting into a lopsided smile, her eyes searching Agatha’s face. She was </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> blushing now, and her pupils were </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> blown. As she leaned in an inch closer, her lips forming words, the bartender finally came, and Agatha felt fucking relieved. She didn’t want Vidal to get the chance to ruin her game.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d definitely won that battle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Turned out Vidal had been having exactly the same drink as her, and when they went back to their booths, a bartender following soon, it also turned out Alice had drawn Jen and Wanda to her table. Agatha would have rolled her eyes, but as she sat down in front of Vision, she was in too good a mood to complain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That was until Vidal sat down next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What are you…"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You wanted your e-cig, right?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia smiled into her drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, so </span>
<span>what</span>
<span>?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Agatha, you smoke? I didn’t know." Vision and his polite voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah," she waved him off, "I would if this bitc-</span>
<em>
<span>resident</span>
</em>
<span>, weren’t crazy."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal smirked. She dipped her hand in the inner pocket of her jacket and fished out none other than her beloved purple electronic cigarette.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Give it…" Agatha tried to snatch it back, but Vidal leaned away, tricking her into leaning against her side. She huffed and sat back, arms crossed against her chest, as Lilia laughed at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Harkness, I didn’t know you could be bullied this easily."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Shut up." She was seconds away from acting crazy. Her fingers dug into her biceps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Did you know I played basketball?" Vidal absentmindedly threw the e-cig in the air and caught it back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Oh, you did?" Vision asked, sounding interested, and Vidal nodded cheerily at him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Who cares?" Agatha’s fingers twitched. When Vidal raised her hand up and back, she got where she was going with that. And her instincts kicked in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don’t you dare! "she all but shouted as she threw herself at Vidal, all pretense of professionalism gone, practically climbing on the booth to pull at Vidal’s arm that was holding the e-cig. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal tried to escape her clutch, Agatha’s fingers digging into her clothes and pulling on anything she could find as Vidal snaked away in every possible way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t register the gasps of excitement people sent their way as she managed to wrap an arm around the back of Vidal’s neck, the other hand shooting up to her precious e-cig that was being held up in the air…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s head moved then, and Agatha felt her face, or </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span>, against her collarbone through her shirt, and like a hundred bricks falling over her head, the situation dawned on her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She froze, hand in the air, the other clawing at Vidal’s jaw from her clutch around her head. Her body seemed to realize too then, and it got </span>
<em>
<span>warm</span>
</em>
<span>. Warm in all the worst places. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she met Lilia’s face, she could tell Lilia was trying (and failing miserably) not to laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hesitated a second too long. Vidal wriggled in her hold, and a sharp pain shot through Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Fuck! God!" She withdrew, setting the resident free. "Are you insane? You bit me! These are my only surgeon's hands!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal laughed like the maniac she was, pure joy in her eyes. She turned away, and the next thing Agatha saw was her e-cig drawing an arch in the air. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mouth dropped open. It landed straight in the closest bin, several meters away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gaped, Lilia’s face mirroring hers, except she still looked amused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision just hummed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Nice throw! But why did you…"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Let it go, Vi. "Agatha wasn’t looking at him, barely able to pour the fake sweetness in her voice when all she wanted to do was scream. "She’s just signed up for months of the worst possible work in every single department she gets assigned to."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But her residency is due in like two months, right? "Lilia mused. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah, her being an attending won’t change anything." She turned to Vidal, "So, you either get a job in another hospital once your residency is over, or you’re </span>
<em>
<span>mine. </span>
</em>
<span>Every minute of your life in the hospital will belong to me. Either way, I win."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Vidal could answer, a dangerously smug look already on her face, Agatha pushed on her shoulder and motioned for her to get up. She got off the booth after her, rapidly said her goodbyes, and left. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t turn around, but she could feel Vidal’s eyes on her the whole way out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Once she’d stepped outside, she leant against a wall and took a deep breath. That bitch was simply unhinged. Hell, she’d been a little unhinged herself, but when the choice was between that and getting bullied…</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ugh</span>
</em>
<span>, she hated Rio Vidal. Really, she did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So why was her heart still hammering against her chest?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes and breathed in the cool air. Her Uber would be coming soon. Oh, how she needed her e-cig right now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><br/>
*** <br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The next morning, she made a point of spending the little time she could with Nicky. She woke him up, coddling him when he refused to get out of bed. She knew he only did it when she was the one waking him, just a performance to get more attention from her, and so she gave it. When he hid under the covers, she played along to get him out, tickled him until he couldn’t breathe, then sat on his bed and held him until his breathing slowed, kissing his head as his little arms held tight onto her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I’m sorry I had to work so late yesterday, you know I always choose you when it’s even remotely possible, right?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt Nicky nod into her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mama? "He sounded uncertain, and Agatha leant away to look at his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yeah?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I saw a paper at school, Mrs. Day had it. It said that smoking is bad. "He paused, looking away from her for a second. "Do you smoke, mama?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her heart clench. She took a few seconds to reply; she really hadn’t thought of facing the topic with him just yet. In the end, she wrapped her head around it, and-what a fucking coincidence, huh?</span>
</p><p>
<span>"No, I don’t." She moved his hair back from his forehead, but he didn’t look convinced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"But you have that thing that makes smoke. I saw it at aunty Jen’s house."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised her eyebrows in surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ok, first of all, Jen isn’t your aunt. We hate her, remember?" Her tone was light, and Nicky chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"We don’t hate her, mama! She makes me the best gifts! But-" he frowned, "uncle Vision too. And she’s </span>
<span>pretty</span>
<span>, and she told me the story about you and the snake…"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Okay, okay, let’s not revisit that." Agatha playfully rolled her eyes. "Yes, that thing you saw is a type of cigarette, and it’s really bad, and I made a mistake. I promise I won’t use it anymore, okay?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looked up at her, lips curving slowly upwards.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Pinky promise?" he offered her a tiny pinky, which Agatha tangled with hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Pinky promise. A friend of mama’s actually threw the cigarette away, so you don’t have to worry about it anymore. "</span>
</p><p>
<span>"He-she-" he paused, uncertain, "she did?" His face finally lost all semblance of doubt, a big smile cracking up. "Who? Aunty Jen? I bet it was aunty Lilia. You do everything she says, mama."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t have to feign her shock at that. Mouth wide, she gaped at him. "How dare you! No one tells me what to do!" She tickled him again, and they laughed together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Go get dressed now, before you’re late. I’ll make you breakfast."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky pulled away, breathless, and smiled brightly up at her, an excited look on his face. He’d only recently started getting dressed by himself, even though she chose his clothes for him each night or morning, and every time Agatha was around to see it, he’d go and show off his work, proud. Agatha almost always had to fix something-an inside-out tee, or reversed shoes, but she made a point to compliment him each time in any case.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He ran off to grab his clothes from a chair close to his bed, and Agatha went downstairs to make him breakfast. Truth be told, she wasn’t that good at cooking-one couldn’t be perfect, and she was close, but there were a few things she’d managed to learn to make, for Nicky’s sake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She thanked Nicky’s nanny, Josh, as she took over the pan he’d already-thankfully, cause they’d be late otherwise-been making pancakes in, and told him he could go home. He’d slept over, as he sometimes did when Agatha had to work late, and she was eternally grateful he existed. She paid him profusely, and it was worth every penny.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Nicky finally came down, his little blue zip sweatshirt hanging wrong on him in every possible way, Agatha was setting two plates full of pancakes and blueberries on the kitchen island. She smiled at his proud, twinkly eyes, knelt in front of him and discreetly repositioned the sweatshirt, selling it as just a gesture of affection. It was funny, really, how many ways to wear clothes wrong he could find, but she’d learnt not to laugh at him too often.<br/>
She’d wait until his ego had built a little before teaching him self-irony.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You’ve gotten way too good at this!" He smiled impossibly brighter; her heart melted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She picked him up to settle him into a tall chair, and as they had breakfast together, Nicky telling her all about his recent drama at kindergarten, she knew she was happy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<span>That didn’t last long enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She dropped him off to school, letting go of his little hand as he ran to his friends, forgetting all about saying goodbye to her. She was okay with that. It was important for him to have a good relationship with school, even though it did sometimes make her a bit melancholic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That wasn’t the issue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She climbed into her car, laid her head against the headrest and closed her eyes. She hadn’t slept much the previous night. Not once, but twice, </span>
<em>
<span>twice</span>
</em>
<span>, she’d woken up from dreams of Rio </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> Vidal. Or, well, fucking Rio Vidal. The bitch had kissed her in her dreams, and she’d turned the brat around and bent her over the bed of an on-call room, and Vidal had </span>
<em>
<span>loved </span>
</em>
<span>it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Even thinking about it, the vividness of it, made her stomach coil and heart beat faster, warmth seeping into her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She growled. It wasn’t the first time she dreamt of fucking a coworker, that wasn’t the worst part. The worst, truth be told, was how Vidal had taken control in her dreams. She’d taken control, and Agatha had let her. Hell, she’d </span>
<em>
<span>begged</span>
</em>
<span> for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a steadying breath, irritation building up with the stupid arousal. She didn’t want Vidal. She hated her. The woman was a fucking menace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even as she told herself that, the picture of the resident smirking over her, knuckles deep inside her as Agatha's hands were tied over her head, seeped into her mind again-unwanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck fucking Vidal. She needed to stop teasing her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave her overly expensive car a good kick before turning the engine on and driving away.</span>

<p>“Do you remember Ms. Doona?”</p><p>Billy offered her a coffee, which she gratefully snatched from his hands.</p><p>"The breast cancer patient?" He followed her closely, head tilted as he tried to hear her over the chaos of the ER.</p><p>"Yes. Her reconstruction surgery is scheduled for tomorrow, and I requested you to assist. I don’t want it messed up." She could see Billy nodding in the periphery of her vision as they strode to the elevators.</p><p>"Is that why you paged me? Is she already in the ward?"</p><p>Agatha didn’t hide a small, proud smile. Billy knew her workflow.</p><p>She nodded. "We’re going to see her now." </p><p>She pressed the button to their floor, a hand automatically going into her white coat pocket to fish for her e-cig. It had been over two weeks since she’d stopped using it, yet the habit still popped up frequently. She couldn’t deny how much she missed it. She huffed, and Billy had the decency not to ask her about it.</p><p>They stopped by the break room on the plastics floor to finish their coffees, and Agatha was almost grateful for his rambling about his personal life. He’d started to date a nurse from their hospital and was trying to convince him not to move closer to his family in Chicago, or something like that.</p><p>Agatha smiled and made mock-interest comments at him, but, as always, they flew over his head. What a dork. He’d always been one to gossip and tell her about his personal life, but she had a feeling it had intensified since she’d caught the other residents and him talking about her in the bar. He was probably afraid she’d taken the teasing his colleagues had done seriously… which, come on, she wasn’t an idiot. Billy was a fanboy, sure, but she’d hardly ever met anyone gayer than him. </p><p>Vidal’s words, on the other hand…</p><p>She took her last sip of coffee and crumpled the paper cup a bit too forcefully, throwing it into the trash as she ignored whatever Billy was going on about, and walked out.</p><p>"Come, pet." She shot him a last look over her shoulder as he blushed and followed. Too damn easy to fluster.</p><p>When they walked into the patient’s room, Ms. Doona was sitting up in her bed, flipping through a tourist guide of some sort. She was a young woman in her late 30s, just a couple of years older than Agatha, of Korean descent. Her hair was short, halfway to her shoulders, which might have been related to the complete hair loss her chemo had caused.</p><p>It had been almost a year since then, and Agatha wished she could wait longer for the reconstruction, to let her tissues heal and check for recurrences of the cancer. Unfortunately, the woman couldn’t afford it, neither economically nor psychologically. So, here they were. They’d pay extra attention to every detail to make sure nothing went wrong.</p><p>"Hey Natalie!" Agatha smiled at her, taking her hand out of her pocket and squeezing her shoulder. "How are you feeling?"</p><p>The patient set the book down on her lap as she smiled up at them.<br/>"Great, honestly. Remember I told you I was screwed because I’d left my job and everything?" She looked at Billy and grinned, "Sorry, language."</p><p>"Oh, don’t worry about it, he’s used to it. He works with me." Agatha gave Billy a little nudge with her elbow, but he didn’t dare confirm.</p><p>"Uh, it’s alright!" He smiled back at the patient.</p><p>"So, I thought: when life gives you lemons… I’m moving to Thailand, where I can live comfortably with my savings for months, and I’ll audition for jobs remotely. Not in a hurry to go back to work too soon anyways," and she laughed.</p><p>Billy chuckled, "Wish I could do the same."</p><p>"You wish you had cancer?" Agatha gaped at him, rapidly winking at Natalie, who was also sporting a shocked expression.</p><p>Billy folded as rapidly as a house of cards in a hurricane, blushing and stuttering that he didn’t mean it like that.</p><p>When the patient finally laughed, Agatha patted his shoulder.<br/>"Agatha, don’t be mean to the resident who’s going to help open me up. I don’t want him to get revenge on my breasts."</p><p>Billy was–impossibly–even more uncomfortable after that.</p><p>"Alright, alright. Just because you’re my favorite patient." She turned to Billy, "Go on, tell me her history right, I promise I won’t bully you until the surgery is done." That was a blatant lie. She couldn’t resist teasing residents if she tried.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Billy yawned. He’d been there since 6 am, making sure everything was in order before Dr. Harkness’ reconstruction. It was only 7.30 and the patient, Ms. Doona, had just been brought downstairs to the ORs. He’d made the terrible mistake of going for one, <em> one </em> drink with Eddie the previous night, which had led to him only getting 5 hours of sleep. If Dr. Harkness picked up on it, she’d eat him alive, maybe rightfully so… but to be fair, seeing Eddie’s smile over his beer was worth it. All of it. Not such a terrible mistake. </p><p>He could feel the smile take his full face, a fondness soothing over his worries.</p><p>Damn, he was down bad, and he was <em> so </em> ok with it. Especially now Eddie was thoroughly convinced not to leave for Chicago.</p><p>He yawned again. Thankfully, he had a few cards up his sleeve, he thought as he left the ORs to go to the cafeteria. He’d skipped his morning coffee in order to have it right before the surgery started, in hopes it would save him for a few hours.</p><p>He made his way through the hallways, rubbing at his eyes as he texted Eddie with one hand:</p><p>Billy<b>:</b> <em>Cafeteria. Come save me before I flatline.</em></p><p>Eddie<b>:</b> <em>Be there in 10. What are you dying from this time?</em></p><p>Billy<b>:</b> <em>Just a lack of caffeine. Serious stuff</em></p><p>Eddie<b>:</b> <em>Shit, that is serious.<br/></em>Eddie:<em> Don’t worry, it’s my field of experience </em><b>🖤</b></p><p>Billy chuckled, slipping his phone into his pocket as he stepped into the cafeteria. The warm scent of coffee and freshly toasted bagels wrapped around him like a hug, and he sighed. The line was mercifully short that early. </p><p>He ordered a latte with oat milk, grateful for the personnel discount as always, and found a table near the window. The sky outside was still in that early-morning haze, not quite awake yet, but definitely more awake than he himself felt.</p><p>Eddie appeared a couple minutes later, tousled hair, sharp grin, a lazy confidence in the way he slid into the seat across from Billy. His own coffee in hand, black and fuming.</p><p>"Well, you look like death," he commented, taking a sip.</p><p>Billy huffed out an incredulous laugh. "You tempted me into the dark side last night. This is your fault."</p><p>Eddie smirked as his free hand went to wrap fingers with Billy’s over the table. "I’d say I’m sorry, but I’d be kind of lying."</p><p>Billy couldn’t stop the big, traitorous smile pulling at his lips, before launching into a description of what his day was going to be like. He knew he talked a lot, but Eddie seemed to be endeared by it... </p><p>After a few minutes of much-needed normalcy, Billy checked the time and groaned. "Gotta get back."</p><p>"Try not to pass out mid-surgery," Eddie said, standing up with him.</p><p>"If I do, will you be there to catch me?" Billy shot back as they headed out, towards the stairs.</p><p>“Always.”</p><p>He blushed.</p><p>As they climbed down the stairs together even though Billy knew Eddie was supposed to go the opposite way, he smiled and took his hand. He was in the process of stopping to lean in and kiss him, and then—</p><p>"Oh, fuck, not <em>now</em>!"</p><p>A voice, sharp and strained, broke through the quiet of the staircase. Was it…</p><p>Billy and Eddie turned in sync to see Dr. Maximoff, a super nice though occasionally terrifying neurosurgeon, halfway up the stairs, gripping the railing, wide-eyed and <em> very </em> pregnant, in dark blue scrubs.</p><p>Then he saw the wetness pooling at her feet.</p><p>"Oh, <em> shit </em>," Eddie muttered.</p><p>Billy was already moving. "Dr. Maximoff, how do you feel? How long have you been having contractions?"</p><p>She gritted her teeth. "I—ugh, just a couple hours, I thought I had time. This is ridiculous-"</p><p>"Okay, let me help you," Billy said, slipping a steadying hand under her elbow. "Eddie, would you go grab a wheelchair from the ER?"</p><p>Eddie nodded and hurried away, leaving Billy with Dr. Maximoff, who was doing an impressive job of pretending she wasn’t in agony, face only twisting ever so little.</p><p>"Alright," Billy said, shifting so he was half-supporting her, half-guiding her down a few steps. He tried to sound steadier than he felt. "We need to get you down a floor so Eddie doesn’t have to carry you to the wheelchair."</p><p>She snorted between breaths. "Look, Eddie seems like a nice guy, but I doubt he could carry my very heavy twins and me anywhere right now."</p><p>Billy huffed a laugh, keeping his focus on getting her down safely. "Yeah, he’s not crazy fit. Definitely more than I am, though!” He wanted to keep talking, to take Dr. Maximoff’s mind off the pain. That was kinda his specialty. “Hey, maybe this was fate. You were <em> just </em> saying last week that I needed to get hands-on OB experience."</p><p>"This isn’t what I pictured," she huffed through gritted teeth.</p><p>"Yeah, I guess hospitals have a sick sense of humor. But you’ll be fine, Dr. Maximoff."</p><p>She shot him an apologetic smile, a little crouched, one hand below her belly like she was trying to hug the babies to her. “I think we’re past pleasantries. Just call me Wanda.” She smiled, but her eyebrows betrayed her worry.</p><p>By the time Eddie skidded back with a wheelchair, Wanda’s grip on Billy’s arm had tightened enough to cut off circulation.</p><p>Eddie crouched next to her. "Alright, let’s get you in before Billy decides to turn into a midwife."</p><p>Between the two of them, they got Wanda seated, and Billy took over pushing as Eddie cleared the way. The trip to OB/GYN was a blur of hurried steps, Wanda’s labored breathing, and Billy muttering a steady stream of, "You’re good, you got this, just don’t pop ‘em out in the hallway, alright?"</p><p>By the time they crashed through the double doors of OB, the nurses were already moving. Someone paged the attending, someone else took Wanda’s vitals.</p><p>Billy stepped back, his heart still hammering from the rush. Eddie laid a soothing hand on his shoulder blade.</p><p>Just as Billy was about to step away, one of the nurses turned to him, looking harried. “Dr. Kaplan, all our OB attendings are caught up in emergency C-sections and high-risk deliveries. Can you stay with her until we get someone?”</p><p>Billy opened his mouth to protest—he wasn’t even supposed to be here; he was supposed to be in OR 3 before than Dr. Harkness—but as he tried to get a word out, Eddie’s pager beeped.</p><p>Eddie checked it and winced. “Damn. Trauma’s calling. I gotta go.” He clapped Billy’s shoulder. “Good luck with the babies, baby.”</p><p>Billy half-glared at him. He’d recently found himself incapable of really glaring at Eddie. “You’re <em> leaving </em> me? After that joke?”</p><p>“I have no OB training and a very strong aversion to watching people give birth. I’m not the man for the job.” Eddie shrugged and jogged off, leaving Billy standing there, confused and panicky, trying to think of someone else to ask for help.</p><p>He sighed and pulled out his phone. </p><p>Billy<b>:</b> <em>Rio, get to OB. I need you, code red.</em></p><p>A few minutes later, a testament to how fast she always seemed to move–well, teleport–through hospital floors, Rio strolled in, looking relaxed. “You better be dying.”</p><p>Billy gestured with his chin to Wanda, who was now clutching the bed rails, breathing through another contraction as he checked her dilation. “She’s six centimeters dilated, the first twin is cephalic, and I’m completely alone.” he walked around the bed to Rio. “I need you to take over here. I’m supposed to be in plastics, and—”</p><p>“Wait,” Wanda’s voice cut in, weak but firm. He turned to her and she reached for his arm, gripping it hard. “Please don’t go.” Her voice cracked, fear breaking through her strong front. </p><p>Billy hesitated. “Wanda—”</p><p>“They can’t get a hold of Vision. My–” she exhaled sharply, “my husband. He’s not picking up, is he?” Billy nodded, and her fingers dug into his sleeve, panic creeping in. “I don’t—I don’t want to do this alone.”</p><p>Billy’s eyebrows shot together in apprehension. He couldn’t leave her like that, could he? Dr. Harkness would understand. She had to. Wasn’t she close to Dr. Max–Wanda?</p><p>He looked at Rio, who was watching the scene with scrunched eyebrows, hands in the pockets of her scrubs, and soon enough, he’d made up his mind. If his staying would make Dr. Maximoff feel safer, he would. This was why he’d gone into medicine: being there for people.</p><p>“Please Rio, <em> please </em> go to Dr. Harkness. Tell her I’m stuck here, take my place in the OR.” He gave her an imploring look, hoping his face would keep her from being as unserious as she often was, and she'd just do what he’d asked her, <em> rapidly </em>. She knew how much plastics meant to him. What giving up a surgery meant.</p><p>Rio blinked, then grinned. “Oh, <em>hell</em> <em>yes</em>. My lucky day.” As inappropriate as ever.</p><p>Billy sighed, relief mixing with shame even though the comment hadn’t come from him, a blush threatening to creep up his neck. “Yeah, great, enjoy it. Go now. She’s already texted me twice, which means she’s probably going to kill me.”</p><p>Rio bit her lower lip, clearly trying to hold back something. A dirty joke, if he knew her well. <br/>She smirked at Wanda, wiggling an index towards her belly: “Good luck with the whole <em> pushing humans out of your body </em> thing.” Then she strolled off, visibly thrilled, but right as she was getting out, she stopped at the door and briefly turned to them. “If Dr. Harkness kills me, write on my headstone that I died the happiest.” </p><p>
<em> Aaand there it was. </em>
</p><p>Billy exhaled and turned back to Wanda, who was still gripping his arm like a lifeline. “Sorry about that. She’s just joking–” he patted Wanda’s shoulder, “Guess you’re stuck with me now.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Rio adjusted her surgical cap—the one with little succulents printed on it, her favorite—before stepping into the OR hallway. She didn’t even try to fight the smug grin tugging at her lips. Billy <em> owed </em> her for this one. Big time. Such a win-win, she couldn’t have seen it coming in a thousand years.</p><p>She made her way to OR 3, where Dr. Harkness would surely be waiting for her in an amazing mood.</p><p>Pushing the big red button she’d so missed to open the sliding doors, she found Agatha sitting at the OR computer, frowning at the screen. A few scrub nurses glanced up, some said hi as Rio strolled in like she belonged there.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness,” she greeted, voice betraying her excitement.</p><p>Agatha, the lovely beast that she was, slowly turned, gaze sharp, taking in Rio’s presence like it physically offended her. “Vidal. What the hell are you doing in my OR?”</p><p>Rio clasped her hands behind her back, tilting her head. “Hmm, Billy got hijacked by OB. I'm always looking to help, he asked” she shrugged, "I couldn't refuse."</p><p>Dr. Harkness’s nostrils flared. “Really, couldn’t you?”</p><p>What she meant was “I’d rather you had”, and Rio held a laugh in. She gestured at the room, “Hospital’s unpredictable, you know. One minute you’re prepping a patient for plastics, the next you’re delivering your boss's twins.”</p><p>Dr. Harkness crossed her arms, jaw twitching. For over a week now, everyone had been sticking Rio with the most mundane tasks on Agatha’s behalf, hoping to teach her a lesson on private property or some other nonsense. She’d heroically been going through it all with a grin and an unwavering will to annoy Dr. Harkness into fucking her.</p><p>She was probably delusional, but it didn’t matter. Billy hadn’t even been able to confirm her sexual orientation, and Rio and he were the only residents convinced she must be into women. And all she knew about her personal life was that she wasn’t married.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes wandered above for a second then, fingers clutching at her forearms. “Is it Wanda?”</p><p><em> Awn </em>. She was worried.</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio felt a sudden compulsion to comfort her, and her whole demeanor slipped. “She’s ok.” Her voice came out soft. “Billy’s great, and I’m sure an OB will be there as soon as something remotely interesting happens.”</p><p>Agatha shifted in her seat, eyes fixed on her face, all semblance of annoyance lost. Like she was waiting for Rio’s words to settle into her beautiful brain.</p><p>When she spoke, her voice was unusually quiet. “I know that.”</p><p>After one more short, tense beat, Agatha exhaled sharply, her facade building back on, and her tone was biting once again: “Fine. I’ll allow you to scrub in.”</p><p>Rio <em> did </em> grin at that, at the choice of words. Everything felt like power play with Agatha.</p><p>“But,” Dr. Harkness tried-and failed-to cut her victory short with a pointed glare. “Do <em> not </em> screw this up, Vidal. I care about this patient. This is a complicated reconstruction, and if you so much as fuck up one <em> minuscule </em> detail, I will personally make sure you regret it.”</p><p>“Noted,” Rio said breezily. Not that there was much more Agatha could do to punish her, but for once she gave in to the feeling that it wasn't the right time to point it out. </p><p>She made a mental note to point it out later.</p><p>Agatha shot her one last glare before turning back to the computer. “Come here.”</p><p>Rio stepped up, eager as ever to carry out her commands, as the attending pulled up the patient’s chart and surgical plan to take her through every detail. She was thorough-Agatha always was-but there was an unusual edge to her voice.</p><p>“Get this,” She said, clicking through images on the screen. “I’m only letting you in because I want the best for the patient. Unfortunately for me, I have to prioritize her over what <em> I </em>want.”</p><p>Rio smirked, purposefully leaning in closer over her shoulder, the hand she was leaning on on the desk sliding closer to Agatha’s around the pointer. The attending briefly glanced up at her, eyebrows knitting, swallowing air. <br/><em> Oh, </em> Rio <em> lived </em> for those little signs of her control slipping. </p><p>“Hmm, am I the best for the patient? Was that a compliment?”</p><p>Agatha’s face soured, but then, as expertly as she had many times before, she turned it into a toothed smirk. It didn’t get to her eyes, which was—to anyone other than Rio— terrifying. </p><p>“No. That was a threat.”</p><p>To Rio, it just felt like foreplay.<br/>She grinned wider and stepped away to scrub in.</p><p> </p><p>***<br/><br/></p><p>Hours in, the surgery was proceeding steadily, Agatha almost on autopilot. She worked with precise, practiced movements, the familiar weight of the forceps in her hand, the soft beeping of the monitors blending into the background. Across from her, Vidal was just the usual: overconfident and irritatingly smug.</p><p>Agatha pulled at delicate tissue with forceps, her voice calm as it only really was in two situations: in ORs and around Nicky. "The key here is preserving the perforators. If you rush, you’ll compromise blood flow. See this? You need to dissect just enough to free the space without damaging the recipient vessels."</p><p>Vidal leaned in, their heads close together as she followed Agatha’s movements. "Got it,” she said, and Agatha handed her the instrument. "Show me."</p><p>She took over, mimicking Agatha’s technique as she carefully worked around the intercostal perforators. Agatha watched closely, breathing on her neck-metaphorically, hell-ready to stop her at the first sign of a slip. Thankfully, the damned resident was unbearably perfect. <br/>Fuck her if she didn’t have talent.</p><p>She gave her a brief nod, fighting the need to roll her eyes. "Okay, not too bad,” she admitted. Actually, fuck her even if she did have talent—<em> Oh, hell </em> . Agatha mentally chastised herself for that thought. Not in the OR, not ever, <em> please </em> let her brain be free of such horrifying ideas.</p><p>Rio hummed across from her, sounding amused. "Not bad a teacher yourself. No wonder your boy Billy is so obsessed."</p><p>That brought the bar conversation back to Agatha’s mind, and she snorted to hide any honest reactions. She had to bite something back, and fast: "Teen is a decent student, he actually uses his ears to listen… you might want to learn a thing or two from him." She winced at how petulant that was; she hadn’t been thinking clearly enough to formulate a smarter retort. Damn her.</p><p>Rio scoffed playfully anyway. "<em> Please </em>, I listen when it makes sense. I literally just proved it." She took the aspirator back from Agatha, then glanced at her. "And as much as you hate me, I think we make a great team."</p><p>Agatha didn’t bother looking up. "I make a great team with anyone, <em> darling </em> . I’m just that good." She held a hand out to the scrub nurse for a bipolar. “You guys do the boring part of the work, I make sure it looks <em> good </em>.”</p><p>“Mm, kinda hoped you’d say you don’t actually hate me. Felt like we were bonding.” Rio hummed, and at a rapid glance, Agatha could see the smile in the shape of her eyes. Pretty.</p><p><em> Ugh. </em> Pretty <em> irritating </em>, that’s what it was.</p><p>“Oh, but I do,” Agatha said, looking back down at the surgical field. “...hate you.”</p><p>They kept on bickering for a while, which was always a good sign in the OR. People had this perception of surgery being deadly serious, but the truth was, as long as everything went fine, an OR would be filled with jokes, music, small talk. A silent OR, on the other hand? You could be sure something hard, complicated, or very wrong was going on.</p><p>It didn’t occur to Agatha that anything might go wrong this time. Of course, something could always go wrong, and they were prepared. It was part of the job. And yet, as every time before, when it happened, it hit her like a freight train. </p><p>She knew it could happen. She never <em> believed </em> it would.</p><p>Under Vidal’s instruments, blood surged into the field, dark venous blood pooling rapidly, saturating the sterile gauze. It wasn’t a slow leak—it looked fucking catastrophic. Agatha didn’t hesitate. “Switch,” she snapped, already stepping to the opposite side as Rio withdrew her hands. The motion was automatic, her mind analyzing the situation at lightning speed. </p><p>“The fuck did you do?” She didn’t think before saying it. And she didn’t have time to register Vidal’s wince. No time for anything, they couldn’t afford to <em> feel </em> anything.</p><p>“BP dropping,” the anesthesiologist called. “Eighty over sixty.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers moved fast, but maintained the surgical precision that had gotten embedded into her DNA. Vidal’s aspirator kept gurgling, clearing the view to look for the damaged vessel, but it wasn’t <em> fucking </em> visible. Agatha swore some more, Vidal unusually quiet and still, seamlessly following her lead. </p><p>“I can’t see shit. Floseal–” She held a hand out, dropping a divaricator on the anti-slip silicone mat over the drapes on the patient’s abdomen. As soon as her fingers closed around the new instrument, she started spraying the hemostatic foam on the area of the source of bleeding. </p><p>The bleeding slowed down. “I see it!” Vidal still had a voice, apparently. She pointed at the damaged vein with a clamp, and Agatha unceremoniously pushed it away. “No shit, Sherlock.” she sneered. Okay, not entirely called for. </p><p>“Suction. Clamp.” The scrub nurse reacted instantly, placing the instruments in her hands. The moment the clamp locked down, she could finally see the tear better—it was likely a side branch of the internal mammary vein. <em> Fuck. </em>Fucking nightmare.</p><p>“Need another unit of packed RBCs,” the anesthesiologist added. “She’s lost too much already.”</p><p>Agatha tried to ignore that. Rio repositioned the retractor to grant her a better view of the tear, her movements just a tiny bit tenser than usual. The tear was larger than expected, the thin venous wall that remained intact struggling to hold. </p><p>“Ligation or repair?” She asked Vidal, testing her. They could afford a few seconds now that the bleeding was controlled. Vidal looked up, surprised, and Agatha felt the impatience roar up her chest.</p><p>Right as she went for a 5-0 prolene suture, Vidal answered: “Repair. Can’t afford to lose the perfusion”. It was a small thing, but her answer made Agatha feel a little better. Like she wasn’t alone. Like their grasp on the situation was coming back as she carefully threaded the needle.</p><p>“BP’s still dropping—seventy over forty.”</p><p>“Give the fucking next unit already,” Agatha snapped, “and push fluids.”</p><p>As she placed the first stitches, painfully slowly so as to not damage the thin vessel any further, she started feeling like this was going to get fixed. They’d push through it.</p><p>But Natalie’s vitals weren’t improving. She was compensating, heart rate rising, but her saturation was still declining.</p><p>“Something’s wrong,” Rio murmured, almost frozen over the divaricators she was gripping, watching the monitor. And that was another thing Agatha knew: a surgeon stuck watching monitors was a terrible sign.</p><p>She placed the final knot and withdrew slightly, eyes narrowing. “Lungs sound clear?” She paused, looking at the surgical field like it could give her some sort of magic solution. But it was fine, no bleeding, nothing.</p><p>The anesthesiologist leaned in, placing the stethoscope over the patient’s upper chest above the surgical field, under the sterile cloths. A frown deepened across his face. “Breath sounds are diminished on the left.”</p><p>“Pulmonary embolism?” Rio suggested, hands twitching on her instruments, lingering on the patient, useless.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach clenched so hard it felt like it might claw its way out of her, but her voice remained steady. “Could be. Check the waveform capnography.”</p><p>“EtCO2 is dropping,” the anesthesiologist confirmed. “Let’s...”</p><p>“Give heparin,” Agatha confirmed quickly. “We need a—”</p><p>The monitor let out a piercing alarm.</p><p>“BP crashing—fifty over thirty!”</p><p>And now she truly, passionately hated that sound. The sound that always anticipated disaster. A disaster that was starting to feel impossible to stop.</p><p>The flatline tone filled the room, and it was fucking chaos.</p><p>“Starting compressions!” Agatha barked, already moving as someone lowered the operating table to a more accessible height. She interlocked her fingers and pressed down hard against the woman’s chest. The dull thud of compressions filled the OR, punctuated by the hiss of the ventilator the anesthesiologist was hovered around.</p><p>“Push one milligram of epinephrine,” the anesthesiologist told his resident.</p><p>Agatha’s arms soon started to burn too hard. “Take over”, she ordered Vidal. Jaw clenched, Agatha checked the airway tubing, ensuring proper ventilation, the anesthesiologist not even daring to complain that they knew how to do their job. Every thirty compressions, Vidal paused just long enough for her to deliver two breaths before continuing the cycle.</p><p>Another round. Another injection. A shock. More compressions.</p><p>The monitor remained flat.</p><p>“Pupils non-reactive,” the anesthesiologist murmured.</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth, pulse roaring in her ears. “Again.” <br/>She switched with Vidal more than once, and each time the resident was ready, focused, but she still looked like the ground had opened below her feet and threatened to swallow her.</p><p>It was all pointless. <br/>They tried hard, harder probably than they should have. </p><p>When she gave up, Vidal kept going, and Agatha just watched her. It was rare for someone to keep going longer than she did. Not giving up was her thing. She had a shitty, incredibly hard time giving up on her patients. This woman was young. She’d survived that fucking cancer by miracle. She hadn’t needed the reconstruction to stay alive.</p><p><em> Fuck </em>.</p><p>“Let it go.” She wrapped her fingers around Vidal’s wrist, not too hard, but steady. The resident didn’t stop. “Let her go.” Agatha’s fingers clutched at her wrist now, and she pulled at it harder, until the resident’s arms slipped off the patient’s chest.</p><p>Vidal looked up. </p><p>Agatha wanted to say something. Anything, really. She’d thought those eyes were pretty, that they were huge, irritating, stupid fucking beautiful... <br/>She couldn’t take the way Vidal’s eyes looked now. Blank, devoid of any emotion. Empty. Somehow, it made the whole thing even less bearable.</p><p>She couldn’t think of anything to say, except-“Call it.” Voice ice-cold.</p><p>Vidal looked up at the clock as her eyes hardened, like claws digging into Agatha’s chest, because she knew exactly how she felt.<br/>“Thirteen forty-two.”</p><p>Silence swallowed the room, the absence of the monitors’ frantic beeping fucking deafening, and Agatha was the first to step away.</p><p>Feeling on auto-pilot-feeling <em> nothing, </em>really—she pulled off her gloves with a sharp snap, not even stopping to stare at the blood staining her whole sterile scrubs as she tore that off too and threw everything into the closest bin. </p><p>She didn’t look at the patient, she didn’t look at Vidal, she didn’t look at anyone. In a few, long strides, she was out.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rested her forehead against cool, wet yellow tiles, hot water streaming down her body. The parts of her that had been exposed—neck, face—had been stained all over with blood. She had to shower. She had to shower it all off, rinse and repeat. </p><p>She drew another long breath in.</p><p>She’d been in there for a while when she’d heard someone—Vidal, in all likelihood—get into the other shower stall and turn the water on. </p><p>What she hadn’t noticed until now, though, was the sniffling. <em> Was it </em> sniffling? Was she hallucinating? <br/>She stood straighter, alert, ears trained to the sound. She must have imagined it, because…</p><p>Nope, there it was again. Someone was definitely crying. Someone she would ignore.</p><p>…Except she couldn’t. Because it was Vidal, and thinking back on it, she’d more or less blamed her when the emergency had first started. Maybe, <em> maybe </em>, she could have, like, not done that. Maybe she’d been too harsh.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Steadying herself, a steel plating to hide how soft, weak, and vulnerable she felt, she turned the water off, grabbed her towel from the hook right outside the shower and wrapped it around her body, tying it at the chest before stepping outside.</p><p>She paused for a moment. Maybe the showers weren’t the best place for serious talk.</p><p>But then she heard it again: a faint sob. And <em> hell </em>, she’d done way more embarrassing things than this.</p><p>“Vidal? Get out.” She leant on a hand against the wall, head dropped to stare at her flip-flopped feet. She felt so, so tired. But now wasn’t the moment for that. Now she’d think of the resident.</p><p>There was no response, but the sniffling paused. She wondered for a moment whether she should give up.</p><p>“...Rio, please. Get out.” She never pleaded. If Vidal didn’t come out now… </p><p>Water sounds ceased and the shower door opened a crack, a hand coming out to grab her towel, and Agatha recognized it as the resident’s. At least she hadn’t gotten the wrong person.</p><p>After what felt like a month, Vidal finally came out, wet hair dripping water around her shoulders. And Agatha definitely wasn’t used to waiting, and Vidal wasn’t used to wringing out her hair before walking out of the shower.</p><p>She’d surely been crying, her cheeks flushed, eyes and lashes still wet—well, from the shower too—and Agatha couldn’t find it in herself to think of anything other than making it better. Even just a tiny bit.</p><p>Before she could say anything, Vidal’s brows knitted together by a sliver, eyes trained on Agatha’s face. Her lips parted slowly and trembled before she spoke:</p><p>“Did I do it?”</p><p>Agatha felt it in the back of her own eyes, burning, because she <em> knew </em> how Rio felt, and she knew it wasn’t her fault. She needed her to know that too.</p><p>“No.” Her hand moved of its own will to take Vidal’s, lifelessly hanging by her side while the other clutched at her towel. Vidal didn’t move at first. “It wasn’t your fault. Radiotherapy and surgeries had weakened the tissues, you know that. It wasn’t you, it was…” she had to swallow the next words down. “You didn’t do anything wrong.” She squeezed her hand, “You must know that.”</p><p>Vidal’s eyes searched hers, and Agatha didn’t waver. She <em> had </em>to make sure Vidal believed her. The resident’s wet eyelashes batted slowly, and she looked away. But she gripped Agatha’s hand back, hard.</p><p>“Okay.” Was all she said, almost a whisper, eyes fixed on something to Agatha’s back.</p><p>“I know you won’t believe me. Not right now anyways, not fully.” Agatha paused, thumb swiping up and down the back of Rio’s hand. “You’ll have the instinct to re-think of everything you did, over and over again, until every detail is burned irreversibly in your memory.” </p><p>Vidal looked up, tears welling up in her eyes again, but before one slipped down her face, Agatha’s free hand went to catch it. The back of her fingers grazed Rio’s cheek and then she rapidly withdrew, burnt. The gesture had come unconsciously.</p><p>When Vidal’s head leaned towards her hand, though, her fingers stopped mid-air.</p><p>After a beat, even as her heart was aching from the pain, the shock, the fear, a thousand different feelings mixing up–she recollected herself, remembering her role. “Don’t. Don’t torture yourself. I promise it was not your fault.”  She cupped Vidal’s face, her cheek warm and soft under the swipe of her thumb. “I’ll be here if you need a reminder.”</p><p>Vidal’s eyes went back to her then, a flicker of surprise breaking through the exhaustion and the pain, quickly swallowed back. Then, she nodded. Almost imperceptibly. </p><p>Agatha wanted to pull her into a hug, fuck the situation, to hell with how wrong it would be to hug a coworker in their towels, she just needed to fucking hold her. Hold her against her chest and show her how wrong she was if she still had a sliver of doubt. She needed to cradle her head and whisper everything would be fine. Even as she thought, to herself, that it wouldn’t. </p><p>Rio clutched her hand a little harder before letting go, and Agatha’s fell back to her sides, fingers twitching. And then she watched her leave. </p><p>She’d seen residents, attendings, nurses freak out before. Rarely, she’d held their hands and let them cry on her shoulder.</p><p>Why had it never felt this intense?</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>They got dressed in silence, separated by a line of lockers, and Agatha was aware of Vidal’s presence to the other side like it was prickling at her skin. <br/>She was <em> so </em> tired, and it was just barely after lunchtime. And she didn’t feel hungry at all. What she really needed was a little bit of alone time, a safe place just for her to wind down. Hopefully, this hellhole would grant her ten minutes of isolation.</p><p>She closed her locker with a thud louder than necessary, and stalked away.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fucking hell, Jesus Christ, <em> no </em> .” Agatha <em> literally </em> wanted to cry. Scream first, hit second, cry third. Not <em>sadness-frustration.</em></p><p>Vidal just stood there, door clicking closed behind her, towering over her in a soft stance, definitely more recollected than before. </p><p>Agatha was sitting on cement, her back against the wall, arms hugging her knees in the alley she’d made the mistake of taking Vidal once or twice. Her little, ugly safe place. She could see a piece of sky from there, and more importantly, no one could see her.</p><p>Vidal didn’t seem to take the hint, <em> of course </em>, as she stepped closer and sat down next to her.</p><p>“Would you leave me alone? In case you can’t tell by the swearing, I’m a <em> little </em> overwhelmed.” Agatha tried to use the last slither of her energy to burn her with a <em> look </em>, but Vidal just crossed her legs in front of her, hands wrapping around her ankles.</p><p>“Look, retract your spines, little porcupine. You took care of me, I just thought the mighty Harkness might secretly fall too. Besides, you always swear.” She shrugged tiredly.</p><p>“I… little porcup… what?” Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose between two fingers. “I used the last of my brain power to give you the pep talk, did my part, now just… trot off, go away. Run into the wilderness or whatever it is that you do when you’re not in my visual field.”</p><p>Vidal seemed to almost smile at that. Almost. And why did that make a thread of relief slither its way up Agatha’s chest?</p><p>“Do you do that with everyone?” </p><p>“<em> What?” </em> She bit back, exasperated.</p><p>“The… pep talk.” She made air quotes at that. “Do you always wipe away your colleagues’ tears in a shower towel?” Her voice was almost shy, almost uncertain, and Agatha was fucking baffled.</p><p>“No! What the actual…” She trailed off, “Does that seem important to you right now? <em> Oh my god.” </em></p><p>Vidal shrugged again, hands twitching around her ankles. “I dunno. What’s important?”</p><p>“Uhm, I don’t know, maybe that a woman is dead? A patient I’d followed for months, who'd survived one of the worst, pieces of shit cancers she could get, who didn’t need that last surgery to survive?”</p><p>"Life is not about surviving-"</p><p>"Fuck that dropout flowerchild motivational quote," Agatha broke like a dam, and suddenly she couldn’t stop "Are you the one who chose to go through with it? No. Enjoy your last days hiding behind someone else's decisions or approval, when your hands are dripping blood from all the patients you killed, so many for you to even count, we'll see if you come to me with such a shitty-”</p><p>When she caught a glimpse of Vidal through her rambling, the resident was looking at her with a new expression. She hadn’t seen that on her yet. What was it, fucking compassion?</p><p>She certainly didn’t need her pity.</p><p>“The fuck are you looking at?” She barked, but it came out a tiny bit shaky, and Vidal’s glance drifted across her face. Agatha realized then: her vision was a little blurry. <br/>Her cheeks felt wet. <br/>She turned away from the resident, furiously wiping her face.</p><p>Vidal’s soft voice cut through her frustration. “Don’t do that. Don’t hide. My nanny used to say it’s harder to show our tears, but we’re stronger for it.”</p><p>When Agatha didn’t turn around, cause fuck whatever bullshit phylosophy that was, she felt Vidal shift next to her, until her hand brushed Agatha’s back.</p><p>“Can I?” Asking for permission to touch her-that was a first.</p><p>Agatha wanted to say no, to tell her to leave her alone, to push away. But Vidal’s fingers withdrew from her, and in a surge of panic, all she heard herself say was: “Whatever. Fine.”</p><p>Vidal’s arms wrapped around her and she pushed Agatha’s hands away from her face, pulling her into her neck. She smelled like shampoo and something softly sweet and earthy Agatha had come to recognize in the hallways, whenever she stepped too close. It soothed her. </p><p>Her heart clenched. She didn’t deserve the soothing.</p><p>“Your nanny? I’m not five.” She muttered into Vidal’s neck. She surely didn’t feel five. No one had comforted her like this when she was five.</p><p>Vidal chuckled. “Are you sure? I could have sworn…”</p><p>“If I were five, you wouldn’t be talking to me. You’d be frozen, or running away.”</p><p>“Point taken.” a pause, then: “I’m only letting you win because you’re crying.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to teleport away. She wanted to dig a hole in the ground and put her head in it. Instead, she said: “Was she important to you?”<br/>And she had no clue why she asked. She didn’t care about her coworkers’ personal life, not really. It was just a means to control them, but controlling residents was way too easy for her to put that extra effort.</p><p>Vidal’s fingers traced patterns against Agatha’s shoulder. “My nanny? Yeah, she was. She basically raised me—” Agatha hummed, but Vidal wasn’t done. “–After I was adopted.”</p><p>“Hmm.” She nodded against her, arms still clutching around her legs. </p><p>“When I was six, thanks for asking.” Vidal’s voice was still soft, but Agatha could tell she was joking.</p><p>“I didn’t ask.”</p><p>“I know. Maybe that’s why I felt like telling you. Or maybe I'm distracting you to keep you from crying even harder. I'm nice that way…”</p><p>Agatha huffed lightly, and when Vidal tucked some hair behind her ear, she felt an overwhelming warmth take over. It was a simple gesture, but it felt so caring. And she <em> needed </em> to deflect.</p><p>“What about your parents? Where were they?”</p><p>“I don’t know, dead?” She joked.</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>. I mean your adoptive parents.” She almost had to roll her eyes. Vidal knew what she’d meant. She was teasing, and it was so familiar it almost felt like life could go back to normal. <br/><em> Except she was breathing in the warmth of Vidal's neck. </em></p><p>“<em>Hmm </em>,” she hummed, and Agatha felt the vibrations from her chest, “I like it when you say my name. You should use it more often.”</p><p>“Shut up.” It was so quiet and weak, like a little whine, it didn’t sound convincing at all. Just humiliating, really.</p><p>“Okay. You talk then.” </p><p>When Agatha didn’t, Vidal finally answered: “My parents weren’t around that much. They were always working, planning something, they had events to attend. They needed me to be small and pretty and perfect, and that was kind of it.” Her nails trailed Agatha’s jaw, up and down, and it made sense, really, why Vidal was such a brat. </p><p>She would have joked about how far she was from “small and pretty and perfect”, but she was feeling so spent, and so comfortable in a way, like coming home to her bed after a hard night shift… she let herself be quiet for once. Even as the guilt for it nagged at her chest. She didn't deserve it.</p><p>“I didn’t mind,” Vidal continued when she didn’t answer, “I had my nanny.”<br/><em> Sure she didn’t </em>.</p><p>“Do you still see her?” Agatha asked, and she found she did, in fact, care. She wanted to know. Anything was better than thinking about the present—that must be why.</p><p>Rio’s throat bobbed. “Oh. She’s dead.”</p><p>“Is anyone is this story alive? <em> God </em> . Did you want to make me more depressed than I already was?” <br/>Aaand good<em> job, Agatha</em>. Always the most tactful, she was known for it.</p><p>But Vidal chuckled, and it was the best sound ever.<br/>“I’m alive, aren’t I? My parents are, I just don’t see them that often.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Agatha considered keeping her mouth shut for a completely new reason. There was a pause, and her thoughts threatened to swirl again. She tried to concentrate on Vidal’s hands still soothing her, her arms still making her feel warm. The calm pulse in her neck compelled Agatha’s heart to slow down with it.</p><p>Right. She didn’t <em> deserve </em> to be soothed. She’d killed a person. Again. Because she always thought she could get away with anything.</p><p>“<em>You’re not fit for this job. You already have blood on your hands.” </em>Maybe her mother had been right. </p><p>Just like that, a painful wave broke over her, and an unexpected, silent sob escaped her. She pushed to get away from Vidal, but her hold grew stronger, and she just ended up with the side of her face against the resident’s, Agatha’s hands now gripping the fabric over Rio’s shoulders.<br/>Tears were probably running down her face again, she wasn’t sure. All she knew was that the world made no fucking sense, and she’d killed a woman, <em> again</em>.</p><p>Vidal pulled slightly back, their cheeks brushing, but her hands held Agatha’s head in place. </p><p>“It will be alright.” she whispered into her ear, into her cheek, warm breath on the wet tracks left by her tears. “We’ll be okay. In time, it will get better.” </p><p>She didn’t believe her for a second. </p><p>“We?” Her voice raised from a whisper to angry, broken against Rio’s ear, Rio’s hands keeping her sane. “You didn’t make the choices, I—“ </p><p>“Right. I know.”</p><p>She'd just done it again. Taking it out on her when she didn't deserve it. Fuck, she just couldn't do anything right-</p><p>"I'm sorry," it was a whisper, and it hurt like a bitch when it came out, but not as much as the guilt from making Vidal feel worse.</p><p>And her face was so close, her cheek so soft, Agatha’s heart hammered in her chest.</p><p>It hammered from the guilt, from the anger, the sorrow, from…</p><p>She shifted a little, face tipping to the side towards Rio’s, hands moving to grip the neckline of her scrubs of their own accord. Her pulse thrummed in her ears. It was too much, all these feelings, all the thousand fucking shades of hurt, and the–the yearning…</p><p>Vidal’s head tilted another degree, and her lips were just an inch from Agatha’s. She felt Vidal’s eyelashes flutter against her cheek and realized her eyelids, too, had been feeling heavier.</p><p>When Rio’s lips barely brushed hers, her chest caved in. Her stomach violently twisted, and she tipped her chin up. </p><p>They kissed, soft and unmoving, and it tasted a little bit like salt. Agatha’s heart was in her fucking throat, and Vidal parted her lips. Her hands slipped around Vidal’s neck and into her hair, a little wet still, pulling her closer as the kiss slowly deepened, lips starting to glide. Before she knew it, Rio’s tongue, soft and warm, carefully traced her lower lip before Agatha granted her access to slide over her own, and the resident let out a breathy hum. </p><p>Agatha burnt. Her breath hitched, their lips parted and found their way again, desperate, Vidal’s grip on the nape of her neck almost painful. For a moment, she didn’t have to think about anything else, heart racing and brain shutting down—or flaring up.</p><p>Then, as Agatha slowly sucked Rio’s lower lip into her mouth and drove her tongue over it, Rio let out the softer of moans.</p><p>And when it hit her—a deep, hot want in her lower abdomen—it was like a slap on the face.</p><p>
<em> What the fuck was she doing? </em>
</p><p>She pulled away, pushing Rio back, hands finding the ground to help her scramble to her feet. Vidal didn’t react at first, and when Agatha glanced at her she looked frozen in time, her hands still curling around the air where she’d been, wide eyes looking up, searching for her.</p><p>“What…” she managed, but Agatha was already walking away.</p><p>“Wait, Agatha,” she heard Rio struggle to get up, but she was already opening the door. “Agatha-”</p><p>And <em> poof </em>, she was gone.</p><p> </p><p>***</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When she heard back from Billy, Wanda had just given birth. </p><p>Agatha managed to leave Jen to deal with emergencies, playing the dead patient card, cause she was nothing if not callous. Right? She hadn’t just recently cried in a resident’s arms. Nope. </p><p>Denial looked good on her.</p><p>She didn’t knock before entering Wanda’s room. If she remembered correctly, Wanda would barely be conscious of anything other than her babies right now.</p><p>“Hey! Number one best aunt is here!” She announced herself. Vision, holding one twin to his chest next to Wanda's bed, looked up at her, tears in his eyes.</p><p>“Agatha.” Wanda smiled. She looked disheveled, tired like she’d run 12 marathons, but Agatha couldn’t help but marvel at how beautiful her ginger was right now. </p><p>She walked up to her, briefly registering the tiny baby in her arms. “I’m so proud of you.”</p><p>Wanda beamed, then looked back down at her tiny human. “Who knew it would only take pushing out two babies for Agatha Harkness to finally tell me she liked me?” She chuckled. “I would have done it much sooner.” When Vision laughed, it sounded wet from crying.</p><p>“Come <em> oon</em>, you’re not Jen. You always knew I liked you, <em> best friend </em>.”</p><p>“I bet you call everyone that.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. She felt happy for them, she really did. It didn’t mean she could just make the bitterness in the back of her throat disappear. One life ends, one—or two—begin, whatever the useless saying was. It didn’t make it feel any better when the blood that had just spilled was on her hands, <em> again</em>, because her god complex made her say yes to any surgery.</p><p>She took in the baby on Wanda’s chest better. It was as ugly as any, wrinkles and deformed head and all.<br/>
He was perfect.</p><p>“Do they have names?” </p><p>“This is Tommy,” Vision answered, “And that’s Billy.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. So they’d called one after Wanda’s late brother. She released a deep breath, squeezing Wanda’s arm when a hint of sadness crossed her features. </p><p>But the other twin…</p><p>“Wait, Billy? What the…”</p><p>“Do you not like it? It’s short for William.” Wanda shifted the baby in her arms and slowly, like it could break at a sudden movement, gestured for Agatha to take him.</p><p>“Is Teen the reason for this? Wanda, did he do something to you? Did his nerdiness put you under a spell when the birth hormones were making you vulnerable? Tell me, I will snap him in half like a twig.” She widened her eyes at Wanda, flashing a grin, and carefully took the baby from her arms. </p><p>It was tiny, tinier than she remembered Nicholas ever being. Could be because he was a twin, could be she’d just forgotten how small they felt.<br/>
The idea of Nicky’s years slipping away through her fingers like that made an intense melancholy tie a knot around her throat. But the baby gurgled, stirring softly in his blanket, and Agatha’s chest melted. She smiled.</p><p>And then she remembered she wasn’t supposed to feel happy<em>. </em></p><p>As Wanda was about to answer, the door to her room opened. Agatha turned around to the sound, and if she hadn’t been holding a literal, live baby, she would have dropped it and run.</p><p>“Hi, Doctor Harkness!” Billy chirped. “Look, look! They named him after me.” He pulled Rio by the arm, taking her to see Tommy.</p><p>“You have the wrong one,” Vision smiled, gently rocking his son. “That’s Billy.” He tilted his chin up towards Agatha.</p><p>When they got closer to her, Rio looked at her like a fucking wild deer. As if Agatha needed any more emotions to stir in her stomach, as if she didn’t have a thousand different ones competing already. The room started feeling suffocating.</p><p>“How did you get them to do this, Teen? What have you done? I’ve been working my way to it for years, you come in and steal the spotlight?” She was only partly joking, but Billy—the grown one—raised his hands in self-defense.</p><p>“I just helped Dr.Maximoff a little…”</p><p>“Stop being modest, you literally saved Billy.” Wanda dropped her head back against the pillows, tired.</p><p>“I mean, someone else would have done the maneuver if…”</p><p>Wanda cut him off with a weak wave of her hand and turned to Agatha. “Anyways, as much as we love you, I don’t think "Agatha" would be the best name for a baby boy.”</p><p>Vidal laughed. “Why not? It’s 2025. I dig that.” Head leaning down to baby Billy, she looked up from him to Agatha, and her face had gone back to almost normal, only hinting at a tiny bit of openness, like she was expecting something from her. </p><p>And Agatha couldn’t bite back a retort when her claims had been supported. </p><p>She felt unusually grateful at not having to think of something—the day had, and was, actively draining her.</p><p>“Well, there you go, Agatha. Rio will call her son like you, if she gets one.” Wanda mused, her eyes slowly moving between them, eyelids weighing down.</p><p>“Nah, I don’t want kids. Maybe Billy can do that, return the favour, full circle.” She grinned at him, and Agatha felt a pang of deception at her words.</p><p>With one last look, she put the baby down in his crib. She then proceeded to bark at everyone to let Wanda rest and found some lame ass excuse to go back to her department. That was definitely too many feelings for one, only 24h hours long, day… time to disassociate to make it through her shift.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>A few days went by. Nicky insisted on meeting Wanda and Vision’s new twins, and Agatha had to wince through the happiness that kept warming her at seeing her son that excited. He didn’t seem to notice her mood, and she was always careful not to show, but kids could be way more receptive than adults, and Nicky would probably catch up sooner rather than later.<br/>
She really hoped later, because it was incredibly hard to resist him when he tried to make her feel better. And she wasn’t ready for that. </p><p>The night after that first meeting for Nicholas and the twins, a Wednesday, Agatha had just thrown herself onto her bed, fully clothed but in comfortable sweatpants after reading Nicky a book to get him to sleep. </p><p>She was going to fall asleep too, destroyed by the day of work and coming home to push through the tiredness to spend time with Nicky. He’d been particularly whiny today; he missed her. Not that they’d spent less time than usual together… Agatha suspected he might have started to feel her detachment: the way she’d been bottling her feelings was weighing down on him. She was used to losing patients, sure, but somehow she actually wasn’t, and as hard as she tried to avoid it, it always rubbed off on Nicky.</p><p>As her thoughts drifted off and melted into darkness, a bling startled her awake. She opened her eyes to see her phone light up, and as she thought of checking it, she slowly oozed off again. </p><p>She wasn’t on-call, was she?</p><p>Another bling jolted her awake. She groaned, heavy arm moving to grab her phone.<br/>
When she saw who’d texted her, a small rush of adrenaline made her feel instantly awake.</p><p> </p><p>Vidal<b>💀</b> : <em> Hey Ags, haven’t seen you in a while </em></p><p>Vidal<b>💀</b> : <em> I’m sad. Soooo, sooo sad. People always leave. Please don’t leave </em></p><p> </p><p>As Agatha frowned, confused on so many levels it was hard to start deconstructing them, more texts came in:</p><p> </p><p>Vidal<b>💀</b> : <em> She’ss druuuunk, ignore her–Alice! </em></p><p>Vidal<b>💀</b> : <em> Am not. Come over? We have drinks</em></p><p> </p><p>That was followed by a series of random characters, like someone was fighting over the phone.</p><p>Agatha felt a pang of irritation.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I have a 4yo son, I can’t just come over.” </em>She typed.</p><p> </p><p>She deleted that. No sharing info just because she was pissed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha: <em> I have a life, I can’t just come over. </em></p><p> </p><p>When she put the phone down, eyes closed again but still frowning, the tiniest sliver of guilt started nagging at the back of her mind. Ever since the… <em> accident</em>, she’d been avoiding Vidal. She’d seen her from afar sometimes, eating lunch in the cafeteria or walking around wards, and the times Vidal had spotted her, she’d looked like she wanted to reach out. </p><p>Agatha had promptly bolted.</p><p>That was what she did. Run from anything that required emotional labor.</p><p>She’d promised to be there in case Vidal needed support after Ms. Doona had died, and then hadn’t kept her word. It wasn’t that she didn’t care, it just… maybe she cared too much. Maybe she’d been getting a little crush. Maybe she'd had several dreams about that kiss, in between dreams of her patients dying. Post-traumatic bonding or whatever.  </p><p>She couldn’t afford to care, she didn’t deserve it, and she certainly couldn’t open herself up to a fucking resident–least of all a crazy one she didn’t trust.</p><p>Still, she’d promised.</p><p>Her phone blinked again, and she held it up with resignation.</p><p> </p><p>Vidal<b>💀 </b>: <em> You’re right</em></p><p>Vidal<b>💀 </b>:<em> I’m sorry</em></p><p> </p><p>Her chest ached a little. Fine, she could talk to Vidal… maybe confronting one issue would make her feel a little more normal, a little more in control. She knew she wouldn’t be able to sleep now anyways, with all those thoughts swirling around her damned brain. Plus, tomorrow was a clinic day, she could survive one drink. She just had to call Nicky’s manny.</p><p>Truthfully, she knew she’d regret it in 12 hours, but the damage was already done.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha: <em> Where are you? </em></p><p> </p><p>Vidal texted the address and a sticker of that guy from The Office going “Parkour!”, and Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>The fuck was she getting herself into?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha: <em>Call me Ags again, I'll burn down your house.</em></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p>When she got to the address around an hour later, driven by her usual nightly driver, Agatha sighed. </p><p>It looked like the fucking sorority parties they used to have in college.</p><p>The house, visible behind an open gate, was pretty big, with a nicely messy garden if not for the drunk people stumbling about. She’d expect them to be coworkers, but she recognized none of them as she looked between the overly diverse variety of trees and plants. </p><p>She considered leaving, because this made it feel more like a drunken mistake than a drunken vulnerability text, but clearly she’d taken a second too long because, as she made up her mind, Alice came up to her window and knocked on it.</p><p>Now, the windows on this car were tinted, she couldn’t have known it was her. Still, the saint that she was, Agatha opened it for her.</p><p>“Oh, hey! Hi!” Alice chirped before seemingly realizing who she was and taking a step back from practically putting her head inside the car. Her excited smile only faltered by a tenth. “I didn’t know you were coming, Dr. Harkness. I was waiting for…” She turned around, distracted by a sound.</p><p>Agatha snapped her fingers at her. “Wu! I’m still here.”</p><p>She turned back to her and grinned. “Come, come! Rio is probably inside.” She stepped back and opened the car door for her, and Agatha rapidly instructed the driver to leave. She’d call him back soon. </p><p>As she followed Alice inside, trying to ignore the unsettling feeling of Wu knowing exactly why she was there, Agatha kept looking around for familiar faces. All she found were a couple nurses and a guy from management—<em> weird</em>. Who were all those people?</p><p>Alice finally found Vidal in the kitchen, sitting on the marble counter, drink in her hand. She was wearing black slack pants and a cropped shirt that clung to her waist, neckline down to her stomach. Her hair was up in a bun over her head, her hands full of golden rings that matched the rest of her jewelry. And she looked so, <em> so </em> different than she did in the hospital, Agatha had to forcefully tear her eyes off her.</p><p>That was when she noticed the blonde, ripped guy who was pining over her as she grinned, and when she saw his hand on Vidal’s knee, an inexplicable, dark feeling twisted her stomach.</p><p>“Rio!” Alice carelessly pulled her friend off the counter by the arm, completely disregarding the guy. That made a subtle satisfaction pull at the corner of her lips.</p><p>Then, Vidal saw her. </p><p>Her grin faltered, lips parting, and her brain must have short-circuited cause she blinked, pushed her glass to Agatha’s chest, and said: “Drink?”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow at her. “<em>Sure</em>,” she went, a smirk slipping on to deflect from the discomfort of the situation, new environment and all, “if you can find another glass.” She pushed her hand away by the wrist, only trapping it between three fingers. </p><p>Vidal looked down at the glass and back at her, then a little smile danced on her face.</p><p>“Why, I wouldn’t think you’d mind sharing bodily fl—”</p><p>“<em> Ookaaay,</em>” Agatha interrupted her, clapping her hands together, “let’s get that <em> other </em> drink, shall we?” She didn’t look at Wu, but she really hoped she hadn’t picked up on Vidal’s terrible joke. Well, maybe her friend had told her everything anyways, and <em> maybe </em> Agatha’s career and promotion and reputation were already on the line.</p><p>Time to gather some info. Damage control.</p><p>Vidal looked over to Alice, she went “Thanks for the delivery,” with a grin and, deliciously ignoring the blonde guy at her back, she strolled away.</p><p>Agatha followed.</p><p> </p><p>Vidal took her through a corridor and into a hall, where she kneeled in front of a cupboard and grabbed a cut crystal glass similar to hers, handing it to Agatha as she walked away once again.</p><p>Agatha then followed her upstairs and into a corridor with several doors. When Vidal opened one, revealing a queen-sized bed surrounded by indoor plants, she had to fight the urge to bail. Her leg twitched the nervous energy away.</p><p>“Is this your house?” She asked, voice sharp. </p><p>Vidal didn’t turn to her. “Yeah. Alice recently moved in,” she said as she set her glass down on a drawer and stretched her arm up to reach a bottle on top of a bookcase.</p><p>“This is where I keep the good stuff.”</p><p>Her cropped shirt slid up as she reached for the bottle, revealing the small of her back and the soft curve of her hip, and Agatha’s eyes lingered longer than they should have.</p><p>She finally turned to Agatha with a smile and showed her the bottle. It was a crazy expensive Canadian whiskey, Agatha knew it well. And based on the house and <em> that</em>, it was finally pretty clear: the brat had to be from a rich family.</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha eyed her now full glass, ready to complain about the absence of ice stones, when Vidal walked up to her, unbecomingly close, and she was so surprised she couldn’t stop the <em>evident </em> sharp breath she drew in.</p><p>Vidal didn’t seem to notice, though. She just forced her aside by walking too close, no manners as usual, and she kneeled down to a—</p><p>“Is that a fucking mini-fridge?” Agatha laughed drily. “You are “this” close to turning into a frat-boy.” She gestured with her index and thumb.</p><p>The resident chuckled as she stood up, ice stones in her hands, and dropped a few in Agatha’s drink. Directly from her hands. She should know hygienic measures better than that—Agatha scrunched her nose, but before she could say something, Vidal interjected: “Maybe I am. I’d love to see <em> you </em> dressed as one, though.” and she back for her own glass.</p><p>“What, with chino shorts and a polo shirt? No thanks. Not that kind of gay.” Agatha withdrew her glass when Vidal tried to clink hers against it and flashed her a sarcastic smile before taking a sip.</p><p>Vidal just stared back at her with her stupid smugness, as per usual. “I was thinking more like a nice double-breasted suit, but sure, your idea sounds interesting too.” She tilted her head and looked Agatha up and down with a smirk, working her tongue against the inside of her cheek. </p><p>And Agatha thanked the gods that the first clothes she’d found and put on were her purple slack pants and white shirt, because feeling undressed by that irritating brat would have been much worse if she’d stayed in sweatpants. </p><p>“Alright, cut the crap.” The tension in her snapped. Vidal’s fucking tongue against her cheek had become way too interesting to her stupid, horny brain. “What do you want? Drunk-texting your superior draws a new line for unhinged behaviors in the workplace.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m not drunk. Told you. That part was all Alice.” At Agatha’s frown, Vidal chuckled. “Maybe I let you think I was to lure you here. Who knows?” She sloshed her drink around her glass and took a sip.</p><p>“My my, I thought manipulation was <em> my </em> thing.” Agatha raised an eyebrow at her. “You sure you’re not making it up now?”</p><p>Vidal shrugged, smugness never fading. “Either way, you’re here. Sounds like a win to me.” She let her eyes silently pierce Agatha for a moment. “Why did you come?” </p><p>She stepped to the bed and sat on its edge, propping a hand down on it, and Agatha felt like her control over her surroundings was slipping. This was Vidal’s home, Vidal’s room, her territory. Such a terrible idea for Agatha to come here, but she surely hadn’t expected her to be at a <em> party, </em> in <em>her house</em> .</p><p>“Just needed to make sure you weren’t planning on destroying my reputation.” She leant on a shoulder against the library, careful to look relaxed, facing Vidal. And-she could have sworn a sliver of doubt crossed the resident’s features.</p><p>“You know I would never.” That had finally gotten her to stop smiling.</p><p>“Do I?” Agatha sipped on her drink, the cold liquid deliciously burning down her throat. “Be real. I barely know you.”</p><p>Vidal hummed, and as she was about to answer, someone noisily ran up the stairs, laughing and joking as they stumbled through the corridor. At Agatha’s silent look between her and the door, Vidal dutifully got up and closed it. Last thing Agatha needed was for someone to overhear, whoever those people were.</p><p>“Fair enough. You don’t trust me.” She walked to her, causing Agatha to roll onto her shoulder until her back was pressed against the bookshelf, arms twitching to go rest protectively against her chest. <em> Vidal was too close</em>. But Agatha couldn’t let her body language show weakness.</p><p>“That’s not an issue,” Vidal kept going, “Time will prove I’m trustworthy.” She licked the corner of her lips, dark with lipstick. “<em> Time </em> is the issue. I don’t want to wait.”</p><p>Agatha had to force back a swallow, lest she appear too affected by the closeness, the words, the stupidly good, intoxicating new smell Vidal was wearing. She decided to ignore the last part of the conversation entirely: “Wu knows, doesn’t she?”</p><p>Vidal sipped on her drink annoyingly slowly before answering. </p><p>“No.” Her eyes narrowed slightly as she shifted her weight, one hand slipping into a pocket. “She just thinks I have a huge, hugely inappropriate crush on you. That I express in ways expected of me.”</p><p>Wondering what exactly that meant—had she behaved the same with other people? Was that why Alice wouldn’t be surprised?—Agatha felt her fingers curl at her side. Why was the thought so <em> irritating</em>?</p><p>Before she could think it through, she took a half step forward, forcing Vidal back. And seeing how easily she complied, Agatha took another step, and another, reveling in the power she started to feel burning through her, until the back of Vidal’s legs hit a dark desk and she heard her gasp ever so slightly. The sound coiled in her lower abdomen.</p><p>“Can your spoiled little brain understand how serious it is for my career and reputation to be on the line?” Her voice was low, and Vidal’s eyes, even more gigantic with the smokey make-up, danced between hers. She set her drink down on the desk and leaned one hand there next to Vidal’s, close but not touching, reveling in the way the resident physically tensed.</p><p>“Answer me.” A smirk threatened to take over her features, but Agatha schooled it back.</p><p>“I–yeah. I’m not… I <em> know</em>.”</p><p>And <em> oh</em>, how delicious the stuttering was. Agatha licked her lips. When Vidal raised her glass between them, gulping the last of it down, Agatha’s eyes fell to the necklace around her neck, a tiny golden dagger hanging from it. Vidal set her glass down too, and her shirt moved to show more of the smooth skin of her breast. </p><p>And Agatha looked up from her neckline a fraction of a second too late: Vidal’s lips were curling in a faint knowing smile, her eyes dark as she leant back on the desk on both hands, invisible strings pulling Agatha in. It felt impossible not to get closer, but she was strong, and she just inched slightly forward.</p><p>She knew what she needed to do. She needed to tell Vidal to stop flirting with her, step back, and leave. If she quit giving mixed signals, if she told her to stop, Vidal would listen. </p><p>What she did was entirely different.</p><p>Vidal raised a hand to her shirt, slowly enough to give her time to react, and she didn’t. If anything, she inched even closer. Vidal’s fingers closed around the top button of her shirt.</p><p>Agatha roughly pulled her hand away to smash it against the desk, but the top button was already undone.</p><p>“Did I give you permission to touch me?”</p><p>At the darkness in her voice, Vidal’s leg started to twitch, her lips parting to say something.</p><p>“We’re not in the hospital. You don’t call the shots here.” </p><p>And Agatha had to restrain herself from turning her around and smacking her ass.</p><p>“Alright,” they could play that game. A game she was going to win. “What would you like <em> me </em> to do?” She leaned further on her hand on the desk, getting close to Vidal’s ear as she whispered, and the resident visibly shivered.</p><p>Well, fuck.</p><p>When Vidal turned her head towards her, chin tilting up, Agatha had to put a little distance. She was surely not giving her anything for free. “You’re a big girl, use your words.”</p><p>And Vidal’s little frown was adorable. She batted her eyes and bit her lower lip, seemingly mulling it over, then promptly gave in: “I want you to kiss me.”</p><p>And Agatha had to smirk. She had her right where she wanted her. Vidal’s brows twitched as she just looked at her, unmoving. Agatha inched in then, her hands brushing Vidal’s hips.</p><p>“Hop on.”</p><p>This time Vidal didn’t complain, didn’t even resist at all. She let Agatha’s hands guide her to sit on the desk, spreading her legs for her to stand between them, chest heaving as she looked down where Agatha had stepped in.</p><p>Vidal’s hands, Agatha noted, were duly resting at her sides, not raising to touch her. She wasn’t that bad at following orders after all. Maybe she deserved a treat.</p><p>She brushed her fingers against Vidal’s neck, to the nape of it, savoring every inch of warm skin and the way the resident’s eyes were stuck on her, like nothing else existed. The way her head tilted ever so slightly towards Agatha’s hand. </p><p>She could take a little <em> something</em>, right? Vidal could shut up about it, and Agatha certainly didn’t have trouble keeping secrets. She could stop now, save some plausible deniability, or…</p><p>Taking her time, Agatha pulled her in.</p><p>It was different than the first time. Vidal’s lips were more eager, the kiss hungrier, teeth biting and tongues licking over the faint pain, and she tasted like cola. When Agatha’s fingers dug into her waist, Vidal hummed softly into her mouth, the sound shooting straight to her core, and she had to stifle her own-</p><p>Wait, <em> cola? </em></p><p>Agatha pulled away, and it was harder than it should have been, her own chest rising and falling fast. The resident tried to follow after her, but she promptly shifted a hand around her neck and to her collarbone, stopping her.</p><p>Vidal immediately shut her eyes for a second, head tilting back, looking way too into it.</p><p>Well, that was definitely <em>something...  </em>she should delve into later.</p><p>“You taste like...” she paused. She needed her voice to be steadier, but the smooth skin at the curve of Vidal’s neck wasn’t making it easy. She wanted to trace it, the shape of her clavicle, her shoulder, with the shirt that would so easily slip off... </p><p>She had to tear her eyes away from it. </p><p>“What have you been drinking?” And she really hoped her cheeks weren’t showing how flustered she felt.</p><p>Vidal took a second to process it, heart beating fast under Agatha’s palm as her eyes wandered, lost over her face. But she soon recovered, and she smirked.</p><p>“Diet coke. Told you I wasn’t drunk. You ought to take me seriously more often…” </p><p>When Vidal’s fingers began to thread between Agatha’s hair, playing with a few strands, she barely noticed. </p><p>“Why?” She asked, confused. It wasn’t the right question. She couldn’t think of the right question. Was Vidal really that mad? Was she actually that into her? Did she do that to anyone else? Why hold a party like that and…</p><p>A pair of hands gently wrapped around her jaws, pulling her away from her thoughts, and Agatha’s hands went to rest on Vidal’s thighs.</p><p>“‘Cause I’m working.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to growl. That answered nothing. It just made more questions pop up, and she did <em>not </em>like the feeling of not knowing stuff.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow at Vidal. “Feel free to elaborate.”</p><p>“Oh, I didn’t know you cared.” Did she always have to make it so hard? <em> Annoying fuck, </em>she thought, even as Vidal’s fingers drew soothing patterns on her jaws. </p><p>She seemed to sense her irritation, because she graced her with more: “Alright, here goes, and I’m not proud of it.” When her hands fell to her lap, Agatha’s stopped their ministrations too, giving her a little space with the mood shift.</p><p>“I work for the Walsh Foundation.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth dropped open, surprise turning into amusement in a fraction of a second. She let out a laugh.</p><p>“Vidal, don’t tell me…”</p><p>“Yeah. Carol Walsh is my boss.” Her voice was so quiet, Agatha just <em>knew </em>she could use this against her forever. </p><p>It did, though, open up a whole new set of implications with having just kissed her <em>again</em>. Did Vidal outrank her?</p><p>“You work for the bitch that owns the hospital?” She laughed. “This is literally making my day.” </p><p>Vidal rolled her eyes, huffing lightly as she looked around the room, fingers flying to play with her hair again.</p><p>“And how did <em>that </em>happen—family friends? Did mommy and daddy put you up to it?” She gestured at the room, the overly expensive house, and Vidal pursed her lips, shrugging lightly. “To think you teased me <em> endlessly </em> about the money I make, the tastes I have, and it turns out you’re a spoiled little girl who works for the biggest bitch in town?” It was too good to be true.</p><p>Vidal was pouting so hard it almost reminded her of Nicky whenever he couldn’t get his way. <em> Childish</em>.</p><p>“Yeah, well, I didn’t<em> choose </em>to.”</p><p>“Just you wait and see the next time you tease me at work…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.” Vidal looked serious now, steadier. “Don’t tell anyone. I don’t want to get special treatment.”</p><p>“Oh <em> honey</em>, I’m sure you already do.”</p><p>The resident’s eyes darkened, pupils swallowing her irises. What was it? Just the pet name?</p><p>“I don’t. Only the chiefs know of my role, and people in management. I had to fight my parents endlessly to let me go into medicine; all they wanted me to do was business and money-related. Don’t ruin it for me, it’s the only thing I got to do myself…”</p><p>“Wait, is this why you were transferred from another hospital? To work for mommy and daddy’s friends?”</p><p>Vidal paused at that. She tilted her head.</p><p>“No. The previous hospital belonged to the foundation too.”</p><p>Before Agatha could push it, Vidal grabbed her by the neck of her shirt and pulled her in roughly, stopping short of kissing her again, and Agatha humored her. She opened her mouth for her, let her tongue slid against hers, tension building up-and down her thighs again.</p><p>Such an obvious way to try and avoid the topic; Agatha knew them all, she was basically the inventor of avoidant behavior. <em> Fine. </em>That was a talk for another time. As much as she hated it, she wouldn’t push if it made it less likely to eventually get answers.</p><p>But she'd get <em>some</em> answers.</p><p>She hardly managed to pull away. ”So, what is <em> work </em> exactly?” her voice dropped low, almost a purr as she tilted her chin towards Vidal, fingers now digging into her thighs. The resident wouldn’t resist if she asked that way, would she? ”Doesn’t feel much like you’re working right now, <em> Vidal </em>.”</p><p>“So why do you keep calling me that? We’ve been over this, just use my name already.” She whined.</p><p>“Answer me, <em> maybe </em> I will.”</p><p>“Okay.” Vidal—<em>Rio </em>, pursed her lips. “I wanted to ask for your help anyways.” Agatha’s curiosity shamelessly piqued at that. </p><p>“In order to avoid people from management coming to me with requests all the time, I decided to have a party like this every few months. They come here, get a little tipsy and tell me what they want without as much fuss as they would any other day.”</p><p>Agatha hummed. That was a good idea. She prevented them from blowing her cover by talking to her at work, and saved time too.</p><p>“I was thinking of doing the same with all our chiefs…”</p><p>“That wouldn’t work.” Agatha immediately took the bait, and she didn’t even mind. “You’ll never get them all on the same day. Plus, their personalities are too big for this kind of plan.”</p><p>“So, what do you suggest?” Vidal’s eyes fell to Agatha’s chest, fingers trailing the hem of her white shirt.</p><p>“You have to be specific.” She inched closer, voice almost falling to a whisper. “Each one has their weakness.” </p><p>One more button of her shirt fell open under Rio’s fingers, then another. She hummed, and Agatha continued: “Davis needs a one-on-one. Fancy place, make him feel like he’s getting in on something the others aren’t.” She’d gotten so close she was whispering over Rio’s jaw, and the nepo baby was shivering. Surprisingly, still, her fingers unbuttoning her were steady.</p><p>“Rodriguez will need a little more effort. She wants to feel like it’s not just work, y—”</p><p>“I’m not going to fuck anyone over this,” Vidal interrupted her, and Agatha chuckled, a dangerously warm but dark sensation irradiating her chest.</p><p>“You’re not?” She brushed a light kiss against the corner of her jaw, then a nip, and Rio’s hands stopped abruptly at the last button visible over the point where her shirt was tucked into her pants. She didn’t answer the question, but Agatha didn’t take it personally. She was looking quite… <em> distracted</em>.</p><p>“<em>As I was saying</em>,” Agatha’s lips brushed over her earlobe now, and Rio’s head tipped back, giving her access to her neck, “You need to make Rodriguez feel like you’re making friends. It might take longer, but you can group her with some others.”</p><p>She couldn’t resist then, the warmth and the smell and the way Vidal’s hands were curling around her shirt and to her waist—her lips parted, brushing against Rio’s neck, hands flying to pull her head back as she sucked on her pulse. Rio made a deep moan beneath her—maybe the best sound Agatha had ever heard—her hands finally venturing inside her shirt, pulling her closer.</p><p>“Keep going.” Vidal’s voice cracked even as she obviously tried to keep it smooth, and Agatha’s insides churned. She released her pulse with a little bite, followed by a slow lap of the tongue up to the soft spot below her ear, and when Rio’s hips bucked forward, she felt it deep in her core. It was ridiculous, really, what she did to her—<em>this little brat</em>. She could already feel the wetness pooling. She’d never let Vidal find out.</p><p>“Calderu is no-nonsense,” she moved back to Rio’s mouth, pulling her head back in with no resistance. “Don’t try to woo her,” she whispered against her lips, voice thick. “One-on-one meeting, but make it efficient.” Vidal’s chin tipped forward and Agatha mercifully allowed her to pull her back into a kiss, slow and hungry. She was going to take Rio’s shirt off, to make things more even as the resident’s nails scratched below the margins of her purple lace bra, but she didn’t even have time to move before Vidal pulled away briefly and slid her own shirt off in a smooth motion. She threw it to the side, giving her a short pause, and Agatha got to see it <em> all</em>.</p><p>The blush on her cheeks, the way her hair bun was starting to get messier, the glint on her wet, plump lips. And of course, <em> of course </em> she was wearing no bra. Agatha had known, but she hadn’t really <em> known</em>.</p><p>At her stillness, Rio leant back on the desk, weight on the heels of her hands, and she tilted her head.</p><p>“Found a way to shut you up,” voice amused. And then, as if the joke wasn’t obvious enough, she specified: “<em>Boobies.” </em></p><p>Agatha groaned. “Shut the fuck up.” She wasn’t wrong, though. And hers were beautiful. Every inch of her naked skin was intoxicating to look at.</p><p><em> Oh, fuck</em>, she barely had time to think on the absurdity of her thoughts as she pulled Rio into another kiss,  hands traveling up Rio’s sides, teasingly brushing over her nipples on the way to her hair. Trying not to give her much-the fucker had to gain it.</p><p>She didn’t know how exactly, but she undid Rio’s bun as the resident bit into her lower lip, sucked on her tongue, drew an involuntary small whimper out of her. By the time she’d gotten her hands through her hair, Vidal was pulling her impossibly close, legs wrapped around her, hips bucking now and then, and Agatha’s core almost hurt at how much she wanted her, and the idea she’d had of keeping this at bay seemed far, far into the past. Stupid, impossible, unbearable, and dumb.</p><p>Rio suddenly pulled at her wrist and guided one of her hands between her thighs, and Agatha gasped embarrassingly loud into her mouth. </p><p>“This feels insane,” Rio panted out in between kisses, “I wasn’t sure you’d actually—” </p><p>Agatha’s fingers traveled up her inner thighs, Rio’s hand still digging into Agatha’s wrist, trying to move her closer. “I’d actually… what, <em> Rio </em>?” Agatha smirked against her lips, and the resident sucked her own lower lip into her mouth, dark eyes traveling between hers. </p><p>“Fuck me.”</p><p>Agatha’s knees almost buckled. Vidal’s low voice, her eyes. The damned eyes. She needed to steady herself, so she kept playing: “Is that the end of the sentence, or is it a plea?” Her voice cracked a little, betraying her. She tried to slow her breathing.</p><p>“<em>Both.”  </em></p><p>And with that, Vidal suddenly grabbed her jaw and moved it aside, panting in her ear at the same time as her nails dug into Agatha’s wrist.“<em> Please</em>. You’ve no idea how many times I’ve—”</p><p>Before she finished her sentence, Agatha cupped her center, fingers dragging slowly up over her pants, and Vidal’s hips bucked forward as they groaned in unison. She was hot as hell through the layers of fabric, and sure, her pants were thin, but how the fuck was she wet through them?</p><p><em>"This</em> is insane, fucking hell-” Agatha swore as her skilled fingers teased Rio, slowly moving over her, adding pressure and taking it away when Rio's hips bucked forward, each tiny gasp and writhe she gained from Rio burning in her own center. She spread her through the thin pants, pressing at her entrance before softly moving over her slit, and Rio’s nails dug painfully into the nape of her neck.</p><p>When Rio pleaded again, whining against her jaw, Agatha decided to grace her. Not because she couldn’t help it, not because she would go crazy if she didn’t touch her right that second, just out of her kindness and good will. She was <em>totally, </em>one hundred percent<em>, </em>in control.</p><p>She unbuttoned her pants, a hand impatiently diving in, and <em>then </em>it made sense. </p><p>Vidal was wearing no underwear.</p><p>She groaned. </p><p>“Vidal, you <em> brat </em>…”</p><p>“Uh-uh, nam—” she cut herself off with a high-pitched, close-mouthed moan when Agatha’s fingers dipped between her folds, sliding in her wetness, and it felt so fucking great that Agatha herself closed her eyes and lost herself against Rio’s panting mouth. </p><p>She drew careful circles around her clit, occasionally dipping lower, Rio’s boots digging in the back of her legs in an attempt to bring her closer as she whimpered into her mouth, and she tried to lift one of Vidal’s legs over her arm for better access, but the pants were making it complicated.</p><p>She pulled away from the kiss, her hand on Vidal giving a bit more right before slowing down, and the resident tried to follow after her, veiled eyes opening when she couldn’t get her back.</p><p>“<em>No</em>, more…”</p><p>“<em>So </em> spoiled.” Agatha couldn’t help but smirk. “Can’t you wait one second?” She pulled her off the desk, Vidal’s eyes widening in confusion.</p><p>“I think you’re projecting.” Rio said, clearly trying to recover,“<em> You’re </em>the one that always gets what she wants. I don’t…” she gave a small grin, “except for right <em>now.</em>” She leant against the desk, legs shaky, and Agatha just felt the more smug for it.</p><p>“Hmm, I do get what I want, yes.” She dragged Vidal’s pants down her butt, with them getting caught on the curve of it, and—</p><p>The door handle rattled behind her.</p><p>“Fuck.” She turned around, suddenly doing the exact opposite of what she’d been doing before, zipping Vidal’s pants back up. </p><p>“I’m trying…” the resident joked, teasingly hooking an index under her bra and pulling, but as much as Agatha wanted to let her, she managed to shoot her a glare capable of turning back a small army, and Rio stopped. </p><p>"Lock the door?" she hissed, but Rio shook her head.</p><p>"No key." She turned then, screamed: "Go away!” but whoever was outside was laughing, and it sounded like someone had been smashed against the door.</p><p>The handle rattled again, Agatha trying to button her shirt up as fast as she could. </p><p>“Put your shirt back on!” She whisper-screamed. Rio was just standing there, gaping at her like a fucking fish, and Agatha got her shirt off the ground and threw it at her. </p><p>The door slammed open just as Vidal’s head popped out of the shirt, hair messy and face a mask of indifference.</p><p>And it was Agatha’s lucky day, cause it was none-other than fucking <em> Jen</em>. And Alice Wu. </p><p>With <em> Jen</em>.</p><p>They proceeded to stumble into the room, clearly drunk, until Jen locked eyes with Agatha and made a strangled sound.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha fought the intense need to close more of her shirt buttons, which would risk bringing attention to how many were still open—at least four. Her fingers twitched at her sides.</p><p>“Oh,” Alice turned around and giggled at them. “Rio! Sorry, someone was in my room.”</p><p>“Okay.” The state Rio was in, so flustered she was speechless, would have been funny in any other circumstance. <em> Now</em>, Agatha needed her to be less than super obvious.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Jen gaped between them and Wu, hands leaving the shorter woman’s.</p><p>Agatha shrugged ostentatiously. “We’re talking about work.” It wasn’t even a lie.</p><p>Jen seemed to have recollected herself, and she narrowed her eyes at Agatha. “Do you always talk about work with your pants unbuttoned?” She had the audacity to point at her crotch.</p><p>Agatha automatically looked down, realizing too late that Jen had probably played her to see if she’d check. When she found her pants had actually been undone without her noticing, a wave of dread washed over her.</p><p><em> Fucking hell</em>.</p><p>She looked up. <em> Don’t look at Vidal. Don’t look at Vidal. </em>She stared right into Jen’s face. </p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>“Of all people, I thought <em> you </em> would remember how I talk about work.”</p><p>She smiled big and tauntingly, draining the energy in the room as everyone took her words in, ready to bolt. Jen’s mouth had fallen to the floor, eyes threateningly wide. </p><p>Before anyone could answer, Agatha picked herself up and left the room.</p><p>“Agatha, what do you mean?” She heard Rio ask as she got out the door, promptly ignoring her.</p><p>“Come back! <em> Agatha! </em> ” Vidal sounded ready to go after her, and kinda pissed, and <em>oh, shit</em>. </p><p>She’d never admit it, but her steps picked up to almost running.</p>

<p>
<span>So, Rio’s boss, the woman in black, rigorously wearing black tailleurs to every single one of her meetings. Rio’s boss, one of the hateful Salem Seven, the group of people who owned half of the country’s hospitals–which also meant monopoly over their medical research. You wanted to study a disease? You'd better find a way to make it lucrative.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would have said Carol Walsh was the devil incarnate, but she had a kind of fascination with demons and evil creatures of sorts, so it felt wrong. She felt a kinship with those creatures. After all, her mother had </span>
<em>
<span>loved</span>
</em>
<span> to tell her she was one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, Carol Walsh was a fox, a perfectly dressed, fake-smiling fox, whose favorite hobby in Agatha’s presence was to backhandedly kiss her money-making ass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t mind that. She loved getting her ass kissed, whoever that came from. Even if it was a woman who pissed all over morals and didn’t bat an eye at the many issues of private healthcare, clearly soulless. But hey, Agatha herself probably didn’t have a soul.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, the real reason she hated Carol Walsh was simple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was friends with Evanora Harkness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>No one could be friends with Evanora Harkness—the devil’s mother, source of all evil, founder and supporter of countless anti-abortion, transphobic, homophobic organizations—and be a nice person.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha was generally lenient, with her not being nice herself, she didn’t judge other people’s evils. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But being friends with Evanora Harkness? </span>
<span>That was where she drew the line.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, Carol Walsh was a terrible influence on the world, and a… </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! </span>
<em>
<span>Dear…” </span>
</em>
<span>And there she was, wearing, guess what?</span>
</p><p>
<span>A black suit, black heels, black ideals. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put on her best fake smile as she turned to give her a hug. The hug, as always, was as fake as everything else, and they left something like 20 centimetres between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Carol… so good to see you. It’s been too long.” She wondered briefly how Rio, bratty Rio, allergic-to-rules Rio, managed to deal with her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Even more than that, she wondered how Carol managed to deal with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had to push the thoughts aside as Carol led her into the meeting room she’d managed to colonize this time. It wasn’t the largest–it never was. A large, empty room might make her look small. Still, it was carefully tended to, every piece of furniture looking brand new, the wooden table shining, twelve chairs arranged around it at overly precise distances.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A tray was set to one side of the table, where Carol had decided they’d sit. On it, two cups and a small carton box. Agatha didn’t have to look inside it or lift the lid off the cups to know it was donuts and black coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t a coincidence either. Carol knew the breakfast preferences of everyone who mattered. If Carol Walsh knew your coffee order, you were a big deal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In Agatha’s case, she’d known even before she mattered, from the times Evil-anora Harkness had let her hang around them as a child (not that she’d <em>wanted</em> to be around them).</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat down opposite Carol, casually pushing her wheeled chair back to hit the next one, ruining the perfect arrangement. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Anything to make her feel less in control.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Carol offered her a donut. She loved to try and make Agatha squirm about her past, reminding her how small she used to be in her mother’s “care”, back when she had to beg her mother to let her have a stupid donut. She’d inevitably end up stealing it (Agatha had never been great at taking a no) and get punished in return. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The thrill of rebellion was always worth the marks her mother’s retaliations left on her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Needless to say, Agatha was all grown up. She took a donut and ate it in three bites, giving Carol the little time she could stomach for telling whatever polite bullshit she was leading with. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She counted seconds in the back of her mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Three…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Two…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, </span>
<em>
<span>Carol, </span>
</em>
<span>let’s cut the bullshit, shall we?” She failed to count to zero, often did. Whoops.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The faintest hint of disdain twisted Carol’s features, promptly schooled back into a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want me for the new Aesthetics Program. I want you to let me do more pro bono cases,” she continued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> you always want more pro bono? I don’t understand. It’s not in line with your… personality.” Carol looked at her with curiosity now, calculating, reminding her why she wasn’t just another soulless CeO. </span>
<em>
<span>As if she knew anything about her actual personality.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Pro-bono cases are usually the most interesting, patients who had to wait so long they’ve become unique, cases so complicated no insurance covers them.” Agatha smiled, trying to come off as slimy as Carol herself. “I’m a surgeon. You know we’ve all got God complexes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, my daughter says the same.” She had a few adopted daughters and sons, five or six, Agatha didn’t remember. She’d met a couple of them over the years, barely retained the memory, and couldn’t care less. So, one of them was probably a surgeon… figures. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The fox slightly narrowed her eyes at her, then cocked her head, and Agatha had a weird feeling she’d recently seen that mimic somewhere. And Carol wasn’t buying her explanation. She hadn’t lied, though. Everything she’d said was technically true.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I can see you’ve thought about this. Let’s hear your terms.” She lay back in her chair, hands intertwined over her crossed legs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha felt adrenaline slowly rise through her. Carol would listen, then try to give as little as possible, and Agatha would have to fight back. Of course, she’d start with unacceptable terms and end up getting exactly what she’d planned since the very beginning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t have an infinite amount of time. Put my name on the program, but I won’t do any of the procedures. I’ll spend my precious time on actually… </span>
<em>
<span>challenging</span>
</em>
<span> cases.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Carol’s lips spread into a thin, wide, fox smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now now, Agatha…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the battle began.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*****</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“A pleasure, as always.” Carol fake-kissed her cheek once again as Agatha opened the door behind her. “We shall go visit your mother together soon…” She looked behind Agatha then, and her eyebrows shot up. </span>
<span>“Rio!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned around, and there she was in her green scrubs, messy hair falling softly on her shoulders, and when she looked at Agatha, her eyes… widened in discomfort? </span>
<em>
<span>That was weird.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Mh, I’ll come back later.” She spun on her heels so fast, Agatha hadn't thought her capable of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Was it about their… </span>
<em>
<span>talk</span>
</em>
<span> the other night? She hadn’t been squirmish about such things before. Maybe they’d gone too far? Had Agatha made her feel uncomfortable?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t get much time for the discomfort-maybe panic-to prick at her skin, because Carol called Rio back in an authoritative voice, and when she only glanced back without stopping, looking like one of those guilty dog memes, Carol went and physically stopped her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The hell was happening?</span>
</em>
<span> Carol Walsh didn’t do such things. It was impolite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, have you met my daughter?” Carol’s hand was still clutching Rio’s arm, dragging her closer after kissing her cheek just a little closer than she’d kissed Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha wanted to take a minute to savour that sentence. She wanted to record the moment, edit the recording into a one-hour-long video and use it as an audiobook for falling asleep. Or something like that. What was it, ASMR? She’d get to tease Rio about it for-fucking-ever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But real life moved fast, and she only got a second for the corner of her lips to curve at Rio’s desperate face. Rio took a deep breath, looking everywhere except to her, stubbornly silent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve met, yes. We’ve had… a few disagreements.” She wasn’t about to tell Carol about the </span>
<em>
<span>agreements</span>
</em>
<span> they’d had, too. No. Not telling that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, that’s unfortunate. Rio has a tendency to antagonize people.” She shot her daughter a cold look, and Agatha felt an even deeper distaste for Carol than she had before, and that was saying a lot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I keep telling her she should consider plastics… “ Carol went on, “Yours is a truly marvelous specialty.” She smiled, and Agatha nodded back. Truly marvelous, yes. Truly marvelous money for mommy Walsh. If she </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> to lose her daughter to surgery, Agatha thought, plastics was the closest to acceptable she could get.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio and I are going to dinner at Nozomi tonight.” Agatha saw it coming like a freight train, and couldn’t stop it: “You should join us. We can talk about the new program some more, and Rio could take some trusted advice on her future.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted, rolling her eyes, and her mother finally let her arm go. Just as Agatha was about to politely refuse, Rio spoke in a flat tone:</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure Doctor Harkness has a busy schedule.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Doctor Harkness, huh. </span>
</em>
<span>And Rio looked at her, widening her eyes in a silent plea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, what a mistake. What a huge mistake. She should have known it would make Agatha want to go, just to torture her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So kind of you to worry, but you seem to be in luck.” She set a hand on her hip, flailing the other around as if revealing a big surprise. “I’m free tonight.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>******</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The dinner was as cringe as expected, but totally worth it to see Rio wriggle and squirm in her chair like a child with a hyperactivity disorder. Rio couldn’t keep her cool around her mother. </span>
<em>
<span>Fun information</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The way Rio looked in the black dress her mother’s eyes had skimmed over in open distaste, her back bare except for a strip of fabric running up it and rounding her neck, also didn’t hurt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Actually, it did hurt–Agatha cringed at the thought of appreciation. But after all, she had eyes, and Rio’s neck was meant to be…</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ugh.</span>
</em>
<span> Nope.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dinner was all cringe and internal laughs, until Agatha realized Carol knew about her embargo on Rio’s surgical activity in her hospital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe that was the actual reason she’d been invited to dinner: for Carol to manipulate her into releasing said embargo.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure she deserved it, Lord knows we should have been stricter with her as she grew up…” Carol went on, and Agatha thought about the few times Rio had mentioned her adoptive parents. She’d said they weren’t around much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at Rio, who was looking back at her with the blankest face she could muster, which made Agatha suspect she was </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> annoyed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I worry for her education, especially now that her time is almost over. I’m afraid she might make the wrong choices if she wastes these last months…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, smiling fakely. She didn’t give a shit. </span>
<em>
<span>R</span>
<span>io was ready anyways.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“What if she started by helping you with the Aesthetics Program?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With one syllable, Rio broke a long personal silence streak: “No,” deadpan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother briefly looked at her like she was crazy, and Agatha wanted to laugh. </span>
<em>
<span>Brat</span>
</em>
<span>. She had to admire the rebellious child in Rio, despite herself. She knew a thing or two about that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you sold your soul to my mother, huh?” Rio finally flashed a lopsided grin at her, “with the Aesthetics Program. And there I was telling her you’d never be into it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s attention spiked. They’d talked about her. That was confirmation Carol already knew Rio and her had met. Rio knew about her mother’s plans—how much did Carol share with her? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Also, Rio didn’t think she’d be interested. She wasn’t too bad a judge of character, huh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When something moved up Agatha’s calf over her slack pants, she almost choked on her wine. </span>
<em>
<span>Fucker</span>
</em>
<span>. <em>It was Rio.</em> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coughing to hide her shock, she promptly moved her leg away, then waved her fork at Carol. “Don’t worry about her education. She has every chance to fix this </span>
<em>
<span>unfortunate </span>
</em>
<span>situation herself, if she wants to.” She smiled overly wide at Rio, then took another bite. She was starting to feel restless herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s demeanor changed a bit from that point onward. She didn’t tease Agatha as forwardly as usual, but she did try her best, and Agatha found herself unable to bite back. Carol wasn’t that dumb. If she responded to Rio, Carol would pick up on it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, she shifted the attention. She managed to poke back at Carol a few times, looking over to Rio for reactions, and found herself smiling disgustingly proudly whenever her poking made Rio happy. She casually mentioned everything she’d managed to get from Carol that morning– more paid conferences, more PhD scholarships for plastics (which meant more little servants for her research), a couple more vacation days… she’d managed to get to take Nicky to conferences with her too, but she didn’t tell Rio that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Carol watched her with her signature calculating look when she skipped that part, but luckily didn’t mention Nicky herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All fun and play until Carol felt she’d been poked enough, and she went for the big guns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Agatha, how’s your ex-husband? Your mother keeps asking me about your… endeavors.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tensed. “He’s fine.” She didn’t look at Rio, but she could feel her eyes studying her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is he still in the…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” Agatha cut her question short. “I think so. It’s not my job to check on him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, your mother is worried about you, you know? She’s thinking of introducing you to some nice, respectable men…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck, she hadn’t just mentioned her mother trying to sell her over to rich men like a fucking goat, which is what she’d started doing as soon as she’d found out about Agatha’s sexual preferences.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha suddenly felt a touch to her ankle, and she had to keep herself from looking over to Rio. It felt different this time, like quiet support, and she didn’t take space from it. Rio must have read the cringe on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s afraid you might still, you know…” Carol continued, clueless. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck women</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha concluded the sentence in her mind. “She’s a bit old-fashioned like that, you know her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Old-fashioned about what?” Rio asked, her foot still against Agatha’s ankle, a sort of steadying presence. Agatha was pretty sure she knew “about what”. She was just trying to force her mother to say it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be like that, Rio,” Carol scolded her. “I’m just trying to be polite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not impolite to say “lesbian”.” Rio looked straight at her mother, challenging her, and Agatha felt kind of warm. And uncomfortable too. She shouldn’t be in that hell of a situation once again. She was an adult, for fuck’s sake. And homophobia was totally out of style, and Evanora Harkness was…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something had caught Carol’s attention though, and Agatha had been so thrown off she realized a bit late: Rio had come to the conclusion too fast. She couldn’t have thought of it, “lesbian”, just from her mother’s sentence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And as much as the idea of having almost fucked Carol Walsh’s precious daughter tickled her, she didn’t want mama bear to know something was up. Well, mama tarantula, more likely. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So, she tried to take the attention off that: </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mother is an old, dried-up bitch. She can keep marrying those patriarchy poster boys herself, I can make my own income and status.” She managed to muster a fake smile, or so she hoped. “Thank you for reporting her worries, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t like feeling so vulnerable, and even more so, she didn’t like it in front of Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Carol tried to defend her mother, Agatha set her cutlery down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me as I use the restroom.” She abruptly got up, pointedly avoiding looking at Rio as she walked away as calmly as possible.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>******</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The restrooms were lavish, because of course they were, smooth marble and golden highlights and all those dumb, tiny hand towels. Agatha wanted to shred them all to pieces. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked at herself in the mirror, leaning against the marble, until the only other woman there left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t supposed to show any weakness. Not to Rio, not to Carol fucking Walsh. She’d met her at her weakest time, and Agatha had fought hard to make her forget how powerless she’d been around Evanora. Yet the smallest of comments still got a reaction out of Agatha…</span>
</p><p>
<span>The restroom door opened, and someone stepped behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Rio. Bold of her to assume that she’d keep her distance with Carol around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for a towel and pretended to be drying her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s a lot. I’m sorry.” And she sounded genuinely soft. She reached for Agatha’s arm and spun her gently around, and Agatha tried to wear a mask before having to face her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Rio was pretty in the low lights, dark eyes and soft cheeks. Agatha’s hands stilled around the little towel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached out for it then, took it from her, and as she threw it into a basket, she smiled. Not soft now, no. She smiled a little teasingly, and Agatha’s stomach twisted, and as a reaction, she stood taller.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure you don’t. That’s why you’re here, pretending to dry your hands.” Her eyes twinkled, a hint of her signature unhinged look dancing behind them, and Agatha wanted to move a rebellious strand of hair behind her ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was what her dumb brain did when she didn’t want to feel things. Distract her with other things. It’s not like she was actually that into her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Whatever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved the strand of hair behind Rio’s hair, and Rio’s eyes widened. “Oh.”, she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond, just let her fingers linger below Rio’s ear, unable to tear her eyes off the place where she lightly brushed Rio’s skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So, Rio continued:</span>
</p><p>
<span>“About the other night…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t.” Agatha said, her voice a little too pleading, and Rio’s lips froze, open. She pulled Rio closer by the waist, Agatha sitting against the marble sinks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In a heartbeat, Rio’s hands were on her clavicles above the few open buttons of her shirt, slipping into her hair, and Agatha tipped her chin up. She pulled her even closer, their hips flush, and breathed out at the deep spark in her lower abdomen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio cocked her head, eyes narrowing ever so slightly, Agatha swore under her breath, and not in a funny way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio said, alarm in her tone, pulling back as she held Agatha’s head still to look into her eyes, so attentive that Agatha felt a strong need to push her away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she did. She took her hands off her face and dropped them to Rio’s sides.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve picked up some body language from your mother. It’s…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.” Rio interrupted. “But I don’t use it the same way. I’m not her. It doesn’t have the same meaning.” She was suddenly defensive, and Agatha felt a little chuckle bubble up her chest. </span>
<em>
<span>Ouchie</span>
</em>
<span>. That was cute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Never mind the fact that Agatha could understand exactly how she felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve noticed,” she said, mercifully deciding not to tease her. Not about this. And she </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> noticed. </span>
<span>When Carol had looked at her that way, she was trying to see </span>
<em>
<span>through</span>
</em>
<span> her. To play her. <br/>
</span>
<span>When Rio had done the head tilt, she was trying to </span>
<em>
<span>see</span>
</em>
<span> her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>No, Rio didn’t seem to have much in common with Carol Walsh. More likely, Agatha did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought made her feel so disgusted with herself, she had to push it all down. Down, deep down, where she wouldn’t have to face it again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio watched her, patiently studying her face, she stood taller. She slowly drew her hands up from Rio’s hips to her bare back, savoring the faint shake of Rio’s body in response. Her naked skin was cool, a contrast with the heat that radiated from her front. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, wicked once again. “Your mother didn’t approve of this dress, did she?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio worked her tongue against her cheek, Agatha thought she was debating whether she should say something. </span>
<em>
<span>Hmm</span>
</em>
<span>, it was going to be good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t wear it to piss her off, </span>
<em>
<span>A-ga-tha</span>
</em>
<span>,” she purred, voice lower than usual, her eyes slowly shifting between Agatha’s. “I wore it for you. Just in case you were tempted to run from me again, since you enjoy that so much…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cut her off by moving in to kiss her. She stopped an inch short of it, and Rio took a small, shuddering breath, sucking her own lips into her mouth. And Agatha thought her eyes must be matching Rio's. Dark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going back to the table now, and you’ll take a bit longer.” She brushed a hand over Rio’s shoulder blades and to the nape of her neck. “Then, I’ll get a call from the hospital and I’ll have to rush there.” She drew her nails down Rio’s spine and felt her hips buck lightly against hers. “You’ll wait ten minutes, then you’ll get called in for the same trauma.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded frantically. “Okay.” And Agatha pushed her back and left the restroom, eyes straight ahead.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>****** </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Is everything alright, Agatha?” Carol asked as soon as she sat back, and she knew she was not asking out of kindness. She wanted to know why she’d taken so long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just a bit of a stomach ache. I seem to have inherited my mother’s issues with that…” she smiled. Leave it to her to make it disgusting to get the questions to stop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She only had to entertain a conversation with Carol for a few minutes until Rio came back, and when she did– </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hell, she’d positively broken Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Any time her mother talked to her, Rio gave her a vacuous stare, then said: “What?”. She said it so often, it had to be her new favourite word. Her mind was very clearly somewhere else, and Agatha had a clue to exactly where. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio went as far as to stare at her a while too long as her mother tried to get her attention back, Agatha gave her a little kick under the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ouch!” She went to soothe her calf with a hand, ”Why did y-“ Agatha widened her eyes at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I-“ she panicked, of course. Great moment to start panicking. “Some insect bit me. Bad spider!” She looked under the table, slapped her own thigh and then watched her mother, who didn’t seem too concerned with it. Lucky. She must be used to Rio’s weird antics.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had to work really hard to school down a smirk. Rio was completely smitten.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A moment later, eager to avoid such situations repeating themselves, Agatha faked the hospital call.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry Carol, had I told you I’m on-call?” She gave her best apologetic look, showing her phone with Billy’s number over his smiling picture. “It’s a big trauma, I gotta head in.” And she closed the call she’d texted Billy to make.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Carol waved a hand. “Of course, it’s part of the job.” Then, realization seemed to cross her features: “Rio, why don’t you go with Agatha? You could help her out. Prove yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry about it,” she lied, “I wouldn’t want to ruin your reunion…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, nonsense!” Carol asserted, and Rio was up faster than Agatha, who couldn’t stop herself from rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll help.” Rio offered, nodding a bit too eagerly as Agatha stood after her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, I guess it wouldn’t hurt.” Agatha leant down to give Carol a kiss. “Your daughter is actually one of our best interns.” Hopefully, the praise would distract Carol.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, I raised her for the best. But she can still do better.” She casually called a waiter for the bill, and Agatha took the chance to study Rio’s reaction to her mother’s comment—she looked neutral, but Agatha didn’t really buy it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take my car.”, Carol continued, “The driver will be outside in a minute,” and she already had her phone out to call them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, there’s no need-“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just take it, Agatha. I shall see you soon.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*******</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The car turned out to be a ridiculous limousine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess you would need such a family car when you have so many kids.” Agatha teased, and Rio rolled her eyes as she threw her oversized black blazer on in a swift motion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We never travelled in the same car as her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I’m sorry. Two limousines then? Quite a menace for traffic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was the good part. If my siblings and I played our cards right, we could be late to her boring galas.” Rio grinned smugly as she opened a door for her, “I once set so many frogs free in our car, it took over half an hour to catch them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled as the resident slipped into the car after her, casually sitting too close. There was plenty of space, and yet there she was, almost pressed to her side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that Agatha minded. As a matter of fact, when Rio’s leg brushed hers, she wished she'd sat closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Had I done something like that, my mother would have locked me in my room for weeks.” She chuckled drily. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio studied her. “Seriously?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hid behind a smile, she shrugged. She didn’t need anyone’s pity. No idea why she’d just made that… </span>
<em>
<span>joke. </span>
</em>
<span>Only three people Agatha trusted with that kind of talk, and Vidal wasn't one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ignoring whatever reaction Rio was having, she gave the driver her address, and when he politely commented that Mrs. Walsh had told him they’d go to the hospital, Agatha smirked. She knew exactly what he was trying to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled a few too many bills out of her wallet and shifted next to the open compartment divider.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Carol doesn’t need to know exactly where we’re going,” she handed him the money, but when he reached out for it, she held onto it. “And if she does find out, mind you, I’ll know. And your life will be over.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He turned around, his blue eyes skipping away when he saw Agatha’s smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No need for her to know,” he said. He then proceeded to close the divider as soon as Agatha shuffled away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked at Rio, who was reaching inside the pocket of her blazer for something–close to her side once again. When she took out a bi-fold black leather wallet, Agatha stopped her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As funny as it would be for your mama’s money to pay for </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>… Don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, tilted her head as she looked up, and she relented. “She wasn’t all bad, you know.” She pursed her lips in thought, “I mean, I guess both my parents did the best they could with the little time they had. Maybe they shouldn’t have had kids if their jobs were so demanding.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ouch</span>
</em>
<span>. That kinda twisted a dagger into a soft spot. She didn’t think she’d ever get over the guilt of having such a high-demand job, and Nicky. Rationalizing it? Sure. Getting over it? Doubtful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wondered if Vidal would say the same if she knew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just hummed, not willing to take that conversation further. Time to redirect. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you’d burst into flames at that table,” she said with a faint smirk, trying to keep her cool as she noticed Rio’s hands going to rest politely in her lap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I might have caught fire a little, not gonna lie.” Her plum lips, dark with lipstick, closed in a small smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have zero chill,” Agatha mocked, sounding amused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> have zero chill. You kept </span>
<em>
<span>looking</span>
</em>
<span> at me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Looked how? We were </span>
<em>
<span>literally</span>
</em>
<span> having dinner together, how could I have not looked at you…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile got smugger, and one of her hands finally went to Agatha’s knee, index finger slowly trailing up her leg.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now she was going to be the one catching fire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>looked</span>
</em>
<span>. Just like you’re looking at me now.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hungry</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha thought. </span>
<em>
<span>Impatient</span>
</em>
<span>. Maybe her eyes were as dark as Rio’s right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio’s fingers trailed back down to her knee, she swallowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Yeah, well, you’re one to say.” Poor comeback. Not strong enough. She was getting distracted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not the one denying anything.” She leaned in, and Agatha’s heartbeat raced up her chest. ”I </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span> you.” She cupped her cheek, and Agatha braced for impact. She wanted to be in control, she </span>
<em>
<span>needed</span>
</em>
<span> to be, but maybe just this once, she could let Rio be the one to kiss her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t, though. Her thumb swept over Agatha’s lower lip. When her lips parted of their own will, she had to fight the urge to open her mouth wider.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio had stopped smiling for a moment, her eyes trained where her thumb rested.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sudden movement, the resident grabbed the back of the seats behind Agatha and climbed onto her lap, knees to each side of her, Agatha’s hands automatically moving to her waist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The soft curve of her waist under her fingers made her feel like she was going to melt, and she knew Rio’s dress had ridden up around spread legs. She had to will herself not to look down. And as godly a vision as the resident’s face was looking down on her, it was fucking hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio inched closer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t pretend you don’t want this as much as I do,” she whispered against her lips, and Agatha shivered. “You’ve already had me wait too long.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her smell was everywhere, intoxicating. She needed to taste the soft skin over her pulse, she needed… </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could make you wait longer.” She lied in a low, raspy voice. Liar, liar, liaaar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed the gap, secretly dying to get her lips on Rio’s neck, but the devil-unhinged moved back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, frowning up at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you?” Rio mused, smirking. Fuck her if she needed to wipe that smugness away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think you want to find out.” Her hands slid down Rio’s waist, thumbs drawing mindless paths on the spines of her hips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pretty safe bet if you ask me.” Rio’s devilish fingers were suddenly on her legs between them, thumbs to the inside of her thighs, so unexpected, so close to her center, that Agatha’s eyes shut closed and her head threw back. </span>
<em>
<span>Damn. So much for keeping control.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She felt Rio before she saw her, her hot breath as she whispered against her ear: “I can raise the stakes even higher.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer. She turned sideways to kiss her, but the horrible person Rio was, she pushed away again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There had to be some international law against this kind of torture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of her hands went to Agatha’s hair, grabbing a fistful of waves and forcing her head to tilt up. Agatha hated her, hated not having </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> the power, so why was it so </span>
<em>
<span>hot</span>
</em>
<span> in that fucking car? Why was her stomach twisting so hard?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if I said… You get nothing unless you release the punishment you’re inflicting on me at the hospital?” She purred against her lips, a horrible, beautiful, scary smile on her perfect fucking face. And Agatha took a second to process what she’d said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A pang of uncertainty knotted her chest. What if Rio had been planning this—getting out of the punishment—since the beginning? What if she didn’t really want this? What if she didn’t want </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio unbuttoned her pants with one hand and slipped it in, only stopping right above where she </span>
<em>
<span>needed</span>
</em>
<span> her, and Agatha’s doubts got shoved down hard, somewhere she could ignore them. Her hips bucked up, and she had this </span>
<em>
<span>unholy</span>
</em>
<span> vision of Rio in the same position, the dress riding up her thighs, Agatha wearing a strap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wrong move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The insides of Rio’s thighs, pale in the faint car lights, looked like they fucking needed her tongue on them. And when her fingers carried themselves to Rio’s legs, she once again realized… she was wearing no underwear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her left thumb brushed up and up to that small concavity at the top of Rio’s thigh, and </span>
<em>
<span>then</span>
</em>
<span> the resident forced her to look up once again, a sharp pain against her scalp, and killed a throaty moan against her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was heaven, and they hadn’t even done </span>
<em>
<span>anything</span>
</em>
<span> yet. Rio tasted like water, like she’d been thirsty for a hundred years, her tongue soft and hot, her… </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she realized what her thumb was feeling was–Rio’s thigh was </span>
<em>
<span>wet</span>
</em>
<span>, she inadvertently bit her lip a little too strong, causing a small sound which might have been a complaint.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t take a little—” she tried to put in between hungry kisses, breathless, Rio’s hands in her curls, “a little pain?” And she felt Vidal smile into the kiss, her hands slid around Agatha’s neck–</span>
</p><p>
<span>The car came to a sudden halt, and Agatha’s hands rose up to better hold Rio in place, moving the dress up with them. She hummed throatily into Rio’s mouth, because if she looked down now, she would be able to see—</span>
</p><p>
<span>A voice came over the intercoms: “We’re at your destination, Ms. Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, the kiss ending abruptly, and Rio was looking down at her with that lost expression for a second or two, her eyes heavy-lidded, chest rising and falling fast. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” She exclaimed as soon as she recovered, and actually looked annoyed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go.” She gave her butt a little slap, to which the resident reacted with a grin before (to Agatha’s great displeasure) sliding off her lap.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>******</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The walk to her apartment felt like ages, Rio trailing after her in the damned blazer that was supposed to make it easier for Agatha not to </span>
<em>
<span>stare</span>
</em>
<span>, but it didn’t. Somehow, it didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the elevator, Rio kept a distance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Floor 1-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio casually leaned against the wall opposite her, crazy, warm eyes locked on hers in defiance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Floor 2-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hated the way it made her feel. The </span>
<em>
<span>need. </span>
</em>
<span>Lust coiling tight in her abdomen, heart threatening to beat out of her chest with every passing second.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Floor 3.-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. Agatha wasn’t bulging. No way she’d lose this game.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Floor 4-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bulged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed Rio by the lapels of her blazer, pulling her in, and Rio groaned a “Finally” as their lips crashed together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Floor 5-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed the handrail to her sides, pushing her hard against the wall, her head hitting it with a painful </span>
<em>
<span>thud</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha’s nails digging into her scalp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Floor 6-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s leg slipped between hers. Agatha’s breath hitched at the contact, her core burning with the friction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Floor 7-</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, Agatha, you’re so hot—” If she meant in general or between her legs, Agatha couldn’t tell. Rio pressed the stop button, the elevator came to a halt, she attacked her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha writhed. Every bite and suck sent a jolt of electricity through her, and then Rio unbuttoned her pants—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait wait wait—“ She didn’t want her to wait, but—“There’s cameras.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up where she pointed at, groaning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.” She pushed the button again, went in to resume her work on Agatha’s neck—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed her lower jaw, fingers pressing into both sides. “No marks.” Rio whined.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Floor 8-</span>
</p><p>
<span>The elevator dinged and Agatha pushed her out, kissing her all the way to her door, hands roaming needily, Rio starting to unbutton her shirt, the </span>
<em>
<span>brat. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I said,” She kissed her as she fumbled for her keys, “there’s cameras.” Rio pushed her against the door, pressing against her back, and Agatha didn’t let people do this kind of shit to her, but </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span> if it didn’t make her ass arch into Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is already enough footage for Herb the porter to get off—” her voice was raspy, Rio mouthing at her jaw,</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then open the door, </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>.” She breathed out against her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha was trying. She was trying fucking hard. The resident wasn’t making it easy at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pushed her back, clutching her blazer to keep her away–but not too far–and she finally managed to unlock the damned door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stumbled in, slammed the door closed–good thing Nicky wasn’t home—she threw her stuff at the hanger–or did she?–and her stilettoes somehow came off at the same time as Rio’s high-heeled boots. Rio stopped her when she gave her her back, warm body pressing against her, moving her curls to one side to grant access to her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head in embarrassingly fast compliance, only to feel Rio’s lips and nose brush against her cheek, her fingers swiftly unbuttoning her shirt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you thought about my offer?” Rio whispered in her ear, causing a shiver.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What…” Agatha let her hands help her in her mission with the buttons. </span>
<em>
<span>Faster</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Call off your little doggies. I want my full job back.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d totally forgotten about that–It made her chest cave in again, and then she burned. Not the sweet kind of burn, the mad one. The angry one. Why did the idea of Vidal only doing this for that reason annoy her so much? Okay, it would be unethical. More unethical than generally fucking a resident, yes. But unethical was kind of her thing… so why did it </span>
<em>
<span>burn</span>
</em>
<span> that bad?</span>
</p><p>
<span>”No.” She grabbed Vidal’s hands to stop her. They wouldn’t fuck—Not like this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine. I’ll have to punish </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> then, just to make it fair…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha suddenly spun around, put a hand to the center of Rio’s chest, pushed her back until she hit the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then punish me.” A powerful hatred burned her stomach like acid, and she wasn’t sure who it was for. Was it hatred? Maybe it was shame. “Punish me all you want. I deserve it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And she did deserve it. She was bad. She did bad, unethical things, </span>
<em>
<span>all the time</span>
</em>
<span>. She ruined everything she touched. Just a matter of time before she ruined Nicky too. Hell, she was in the process of it. </span>
<em>
<span>It was all her fault.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands slid up Rio’s neck and she kissed her, rough and hungry, and Rio moaned into her mouth, the vibrations of her throat against her right palm shooting directly to her core.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident finished unbuttoning her shirt, hands roaming all over her, scratching her waist and impatiently digging into her back, pressing their bodies flush, waves crashing through Agatha’s body from the contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s blazer followed the shoes and shirt on the ground. Before Agatha could work on taking that borderline-illegal dress off, her fingers found their way between Rio’s legs. She couldn’t wait—only slowing down to brush up her inner thighs, single-mindedly absorbing the way Rio’s mouth dropped open against hers in anticipation. The way her breathing practically </span>
<em>
<span>stopped</span>
</em>
<span>, like every clock itself had stopped ticking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then she had to ask. She </span>
<em>
<span>needed</span>
</em>
<span> to make sure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you only doing this because you want something from me?” She paused, left hand clutching the nape of Rio’s neck, and the resident had to re-focus before she could answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she grinned, lopsided, tipped her chin up. “Of course I want something from you.” Agatha’s throat knotted. </span>
<em>
<span>No way. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio wasn’t done: “I want </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha felt like she could breathe again. The rage simmered down to a low boil.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I swear to God, Vidal–if you actually expect something in return at work…” She still sounded pissed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “What? No!” She clutched her left forearm, “I’d never—that’s crazy!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> crazy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not that kind of crazy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha studied her. Could she trust her? She didn’t look like she was lying—but if she were, if she decided to blackmail her the next day on the threat of telling her fucking mother…</span>
</p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span>,” Rio seemed to have realized she wasn’t convinced. She pulled her closer by the waist, “I simply like you. Years before we met, I’d already seen you present at conferences. </span><em><span>Trust</span></em> <em><span>me</span></em><span>, this is a dream come true. Besides, I’d never exploit sex for personal gain. My whole point is to make it as a surgeon without extra help.”</span></p><p>
<span>Okay, that was interesting. Not the sappy stuff about making it—the stuff before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god.” A smirk took over her lips, ”You’re a fangirl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kept smiling. “</span>
<em>
<span>Maybe.” </span>
</em>
<span>She said, coy. “We’re called stans now. And you have a ton.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? That’s ridiculous.” The hell was she talking about?</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There aren’t many overachieving, hot as fuck, </span>
<em>
<span>mean</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha Harknesses who publicly crushed more than one misogynist, all-powerful chief. Plenty of women wanting to be crushed by you. People talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah?” She dug her fingers into the soft flesh between Rio’s legs, and the resident lost her smile briefly. “Are people </span>
<em>
<span>you?”</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t talk. I watched you.” And yeah, it made sense. Rio still always stared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Creep,” she said, but she was smiling, fingers trailing around Rio’s cunt, the resident’s head dropping back against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So keep watching,” She dipped a finger through her folds, and it was </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> heaven</span>
<em>
<span>.</span>
</em>
<span> Rio shut her mouth and moaned throatily, Agatha releasing a shaky breath she’d been holding, and then Rio’s hands in her hair pulled her back into a kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She only allowed that for a short while, with Rio feeling so desperate for it. She spread Rio’s legs with her knee to make space, to get </span>
<em>
<span>more</span>
</em>
<span>, pulling Rio’s dress all the way up and stabilising her with one arm around her waist. With every stroke, Rio panted in her mouth, and she was giving close to nothing, but Rio was soaking wet and holding onto her like she was her only anchor to the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without stopping, she pulled back from the kiss. “I want you to see exactly who’s <em>crushing</em> you.” She whispered against her lips, a smirk curling around the words. Rio hummed through a moan, tried to kiss her again, Agatha’s left hand trapping her jaw and pushing her head against the wall. "<em>Look at me</em>," she added.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did, pupils swallowing her irises. “Fuck,” she croaked, “Is this happening?” she panted between her fingers, ”It’s—mmh—it’s happening—“ she answered herself in between shaky breaths as her hips stuttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It almost drew a chuckle out of Agatha, but the power she felt building up tension in her own cunt didn’t allow it. Her fingers added the slightest pressure, and Rio ground hard against her and moaned, and she felt it deep in her core, heat blazing. She left Rio’s jaw and raised her leg over the free arm, Rio’s other knee buckling, and she caught her by pressing her against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna—“ Rio moaned between shaky breaths, then got lost, eyes fluttering closed-very bad, nails hurting Agatha’s neck. She couldn’t have cared less about the pain. If anything, with every dig of Rio’s claws in her skin, she felt a heat coil tighter and tighter in her lower abdomen, and with every breath hitch, and every thrust of Rio’s hips…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Open your eyes.” Agatha’s voice was dark. And Rio did. She opened her eyes, glazed over, and Agatha could tell she was trying really hard to look at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll c—“ Rio tried again, and failed, a throaty moan leaving her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha slowed down. Might be something important after all… or </span>
<em>
<span>maybe</span>
</em>
<span> she just wanted to see Rio suffer the loss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Needless to say, there ended up being no suffering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My god, </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>—“ another moan interrupted her </span>
<em>
<span>fluent </span>
</em>
<span>speech as Agatha rewarded her by giving her more pressure. She teased her entrance, drawing and pressing around it with two fingers, gathering wetness, and Rio seemed to forget she’d been trying to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You ought to call me that more often…” she joked, but it didn’t get through to Rio. She trailed down from the very top of her to her clit, drawing around it with two fingers and then pressing them against her entrance, trying to stop herself from going in. She wouldn’t. She’d save that for later. But </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, she </span>
<em>
<span>wanted</span>
</em>
<span> it now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She managed to stop herself at one knuckle. Rio gave her the most fulfilling, shaky moan, interrupted by her messy breathing, and Agatha was coiled so tight she could have come from the view.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha,</span>
</em>
<span> I’m gonna come in like thirty seconds—“ she finally managed, hips bucking faster against her, and all Agatha needed to do was kiss her neck, her jaw, her lips, all the while letting Rio’s responses guide her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s movements became messy, her breathing ragged, and she couldn’t keep up with the kissing, only moaning softly against Agatha’s lips, until it stopped being soft. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hung back, watching her, and her eyebrows were almost imperceptibly furrowed, her eyes barely open but dutily trained on Agatha’s–she’d need to reward her later, her mouth slightly open. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha thought with a startling clarity that she’d never seen anyone look that beautiful as they came. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was climaxing in her hands in what had only been a few minutes, and it was </span>
<em>
<span>hot as fuck</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gradually slowed down with her, letting her leg fall down to hold her by the waist, just in case. Her knees did give out for a moment, and Agatha held her weight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally took away her hand, Rio whined and pulled her into a soft kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only once Rio had recovered half her brain-power, Agatha, still holding her, whispered with a smirk: “You took all of five minutes. Like a teenager.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you—“ But Rio’s pupils had grown visibly wider again, and Agatha laughed. “I mean—</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>, I will fuck you so hard you’ll forget all about that. Laugh all you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh </span>
<em>
<span>honey</span>
</em>
<span>, that’s cute. But there’s no way I’ll ever forget any of this.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, fuckity fuck</span>
</em>
<span>. She shouldn’t say stuff like that. That sounded pathetic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio was smiling like an idiot. The handsomest idiot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha peeled her off the wall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sit.” Rio complied so fast, she chuckled. But then she saw the wetness glisten between Rio’s thighs, and the chuckle turned to fire down her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want–I want my turn.” Rio totally failed to sound convincing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yes,</span>
</em>
<span> you were supposed to be the one doing the punishing, hmm?” Sitting behind Rio, she spread the residen’t legs wide, unable to tear her eyes off the reflection in the mirror in front of her bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio whined. “Wasn’t I supposed to be the one doing the watching, too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> doing the watching. Watch </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio’s dress was crumpled up to her waist; she pulled it all the way off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, the brat was hot. Unable to for proper thoughts, Agatha paused. She silently stared-maybe gaped, but she’d never admit that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve seen this before, </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha.</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio’s short nails dug into her knee. “I want to see </span>
<em>
<span>you.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was too taken by her reflection to really compute that. Her hands roamed Rio’s body, fingers digging into her chest, nails drawing lines on her breasts, and Rio’s head dropped back against her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, it’s unfair–mmhhf,” She closed her eyes, sucked her lips in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Isn’t this what you wanted? For me to fuck you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Y-yes, but…” Rio stuttered as she lightly pulled one nipple and played with it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just one more, darling. Don’t you want one more?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows furrowed in the moonlight, but when Agatha’s hand traveled down her abdomen, skimmed over her center and scratched at her inner thigh, she nodded frantically through a shaky breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? Say it.” She raised her other hand to Rio’s lips, and the resident easily took two fingers in. She sucked on them, her tongue so hot, Agatha couldn’t help but think of other places it would feel </span>
<em>
<span>amazing</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took them out, used them to spread Rio. “</span>
<em>
<span>Say it</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hips bucked. “I want one more, </span>
<em>
<span>please</span>
</em>
<span>.” Breathless, Rio didn’t even complain, like she’d forgotten about that entirely. Her abs quivered below Agatha’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t even had to instruct her to say please. Considering how she normally behaved, that was insane. Not such a brat after all…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t make her wait. Eyes trained on Rio’s reflection, she trailed two fingers through her, Rio immediately melting and then tensing hard in her arms, throaty moans escaping her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, after drawing a few paths around her clit, Agatha pressed her fingers to her entrance. Rio clutched her thigh so tight, she was definitely leaving marks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She slipped inside her. That wet sound-it was a threat to Agatha's sanity, and she moaned into Rio's ear-Rio released an unholy sound, mouth open, one hand flying to grab a fistful of Agatha’s hair behind her as she started a slow pace, met by Rio’s needy hips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, Agatha, fuckfuck,” she bit Rio’s neck, sucked on it, her pace turning faster. “D-don’t stop–” </span>
<em>
<span>Hell</span>
</em>
<span>, if Rio only touched her right then… her cunt was clenching with every throb of Rio’s around her fingers. It was a fucking nightmare. The intensity almost hurt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re lucky I don’t feel like stopping,” she rasped, “don’t tell me what to do.” She set a punishing pace as her fingers curled against that spot inside Rio, palm pressing against Rio’s clit, the resident frantically grinding against her. And the noise she was making, coupled with the wet sounds coming from her pussy–they should have been illegal. Agatha groaned into her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You need to stop fucking smelling this great,” she said before she could think better of it, “staying away is–” </span>
<em>
<span>torture.</span>
</em>
<span> She didn’t finish the sentence, and luckily Rio didn’t react, caught in her undoing. Agatha focused back on watching her reflection. <em>The fuck was wrong with her brain? </em>The sex was playing tricks on it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio’s walls were clenching harder around her, tearing away all her thoughts. “More, <em>more</em>,” Rio pleaded, sounding desperate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“More, </span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She got it right away. </span>
<em>
<span>So good-</span>
</em>
<span>“Please, </span>
<em>
<span>please</span>
</em>
<span>, more…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“<em>Good girl</em>.” The praised rolled on Agatha's tongue, and she gave her more. She slipped a third finger in, Rio arched into it with a loud moan. Her walls started to flutter, Agatha’s hand that was torturing the soft skin of her waist and her tits moved to her neck, and Rio fucking mewled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, </span>
<em>
<span>yes yes, </span>
</em>
<span>fuck yes,” her fingers closed around Agatha’s, adding pressure on her pulse points. Agatha groaned pathetically into her ear. </span>
<em>
<span>God</span>
</em>
<span>. This was going to be the death of her. Bye bye Agatha Harkness. <em>And </em>she needed to practice euthanasia on her brain after having these thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before Rio came, she needed to–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now </span>
<em>
<span>look</span>
</em>
<span>,” she rasped against her hot cheek, and Rio’s eyes fluttered open surprisingly fast. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re fucking perfect.” She didn’t know where that had come from. Rio seemed to regain some consciousness, eyes widening almost imperceptibly. “</span>
<em>
<span>My perfect little toy.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was more like it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio came. With a long, close-mouthed moan, eyes only rolling back and closing for one moment before dutifully re-focusing, she came. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Cheeks flushed, dark lipstick almost gone, soft hair falling messily around her shoulders. She tensed and shook desperately, Agatha following the way her eyes shifted over her body–from Agatha’s hand between her legs, to Agatha’s hold around her neck, to her own face, to–</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stared at </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>. Impossibly dark eyes half-lidded, head thrown slightly back with the gap between her teeth showing, the last thing she concentrated on as she came around her fingers was </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only once she came down, thighs quivering deliciously and slumping back against her, she closed her eyes. She’d been so good, she was </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> allowed to. Agatha gently pulled out, dried her hand on the sheets and wrapped both arms around her, allowing her a little respite. And yes, maybe she’d normally get up and leave at this point, or get some space, one way or another. But Rio had been </span>
<em>
<span>so good</span>
</em>
<span>–</span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched her. Hell, she </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> perfect. Her chest still rising and falling fast, she stirred in Agatha’s arms and rested both hands around her forearms, nails releasing Agatha’s knee, leaving four small crescent moons it.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Beautiful.</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha’s stomach stirred. She felt a strong pull to bite into her neck, mark her. Kiss her cheek. Kiss her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio turned in her arms and pushed her down, she let her.</span>

<p>Rio kissed her, and her chest stirred a little too hard, but she let her. Lips slowly gliding against hers, Agatha thought she shouldn’t let her take control. It might be too much. There might be no coming back from it.</p><p>But Rio’s leg went between hers, and she’d been clenching around nothing for so long, she couldn’t stop the deep moan that got killed into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>Rio didn’t allow her to think about it either. She groaned and deepened the kiss, a hand slipping below her arched back, nails drawing painful lines on it. </p><p>When she moved down, kissing and biting and sucking at her pulse, above her clavicles, below her ear, Agatha let her.</p><p>The friction between her legs, Rio’s hips grinding against her, was already too much. Agatha had been so coiled up, she was going to last an unacceptably short time–</p><p>When Rio trapped her hand against the sheets, the other going between her legs, she was growing restless, but she let her. She hissed and pulled Rio back to her lips.</p><p>She let Rio unbutton her pants again. She let her cup her through them, and–</p><p>“Fuck <em> no </em> , mmhf,” the simple touch, the pressure Rio put on her entrance, her clit had been throbbing painfully for <em> so </em> long, and Rio’s <em> fucking </em> perfect fingers, they were <em> finally </em> where she needed them–</p><p>“What…” the resident rasped against her lips, watching her, but Agatha pulled her roughly in, hips tensing as she arched below her, and she killed the whining into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>The orgasm was pretty short, all things considered, she thought as she came down from it. Short, yeah, and <em> sweet </em> . She normally had to put a lot of work into it, people really didn’t know how to drag orgasms out of her, <em> she was complicated </em>. That was what they said, and she’d always agreed. It must be her. Except, now–</p><p>When Rio-fucking-Vidal didn’t stop, oblivious to what had gone down, she grabbed her wrist and squeezed it to slow her down.</p><p>Rio sucked on her lower lip before hanging back and looking at her, eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>“Is everything ok?” <em> Damn </em>. She was genuinely worried.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha didn’t want to admit <em> it </em>. “Peachy.”</p><p>“So, what…” she looked down between them, looked back up, frowning. Agatha rolled her eyes. Only then, realization hit her: “<em> Wait </em>, did you…”</p><p>Agatha groaned. What-fucking-ever.</p><p>And Rio, of course–Rio beamed.</p><p>“Oh my <em> god </em>, fuck yeah!” Agatha half-expected her to fist-pump at that point. “I win, I’m the winner, the champion, forever and ever!”</p><p>And Agatha very much wanted to hate her. Did she have to be-<em>ugh</em>-cute? </p><p><em> Bleagh </em>. Scratch that. She wasn’t cute, she was dumb, stupid Vidal. </p><p>“Would you be kind for me?” she smiled, and Rio looked at her in surprise, soft features, her whole demeanor changed.</p><p>“Of course, what do you need?”</p><p>Her smile dropped. “Shut the fuck up.”</p><p>Rio whined, mock-frowning, but her hips reflexively bucked up. <em> Fuck </em>. Agatha was definitely ready for more.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio replied.</p><p>***</p><p>She kneeled between her legs. </p><p>She’d dragged Agatha to the edge of the bed, spread her legs and kneeled between them—that was more like it—and Agatha’s hands were in her hair and down her neck, and she could feel Rio’s hammering pulse below her thumbs…</p><p>It was divine, having her kneel for her. Agatha could feel the wetness drip down her thighs, the tension from before not tamed by the short release <em> at all </em>.</p><p>Impatient, Rio unclasped her purple lace bra and threw it to the ground. And Agatha expected <em> something </em>, but Rio just hung back and stared. </p><p>“Yes, those are called breasts,” she started, sarcastic. It made her restless—Rio <em> watching </em> , Rio setting the pace. But then those dark eyes looked up at Agatha, almost <em> feral </em>, and she felt like she was getting devoured. </p><p>And she was the one to shut up.</p><p>“I can’t believe how hot you are.” Rio licked her lips. “Pants, off.” And she started working on it, and Agatha had forgotten she didn’t let others order her around, so she dutifully raised her butt for Rio to slide her pants off. Heat radiated all the way up her body, and she was already getting lost.</p><p>Rio played with the hem of her panties, giving her core more <em> nothing </em> to clench on, but then she looked up, and Agatha couldn’t help but lean down to kiss her. </p><p>Rio hummed into the kiss, opening up for her, sliding her hot tongue against her lower lip, biting and—she grabbed her jaw and moved it aside, and when she flattened her tongue on her pulse and then sucked on it, Agatha’s throat let out a groan.</p><p>She kissed and licked and bit all the way down her neck, clavicles, chest, until one hand went to her breast, her mouth spread in front of the other, hot breath making Agatha shiver, stomach twisting in expectation…</p><p>Rio stopped, inched back, looked up at her, and as much as she was dying for her to go on, Agatha silently stared–the damned vision getting carved into her brain.</p><p><em> Fucking hell, </em>her brain needed to quit being that pathetic.</p><p>“Why the hell are you stopping?” She could only be silent for so long.</p><p>“To ask for permission.” </p><p>Agatha smirked, core clenching. “My, my, what a <em> good girl </em> .” She dragged the words, savoring the way Rio swallowed thickly, the hand in Rio’s hair grabbing a fistful to tilt her head back. <em> Tasted like taking back control. </em> Her other hand, at her back, held her weight against the mattress.</p><p>“A-ga-tha,” Rio pronounced every syllable, then sucked her lip in, “<em> Please.” </em></p><p>“How can I deny you when you ask so nicely?” Agatha’s grip on her hair relented, and Rio was on her in a heartbeat. Her tongue flattened on Agatha’s nipple. She sucked on the side of her breast, nails digging into the other and winning her a moan. When she bit down too hard, Agatha forcefully pulled her back.</p><p>“Be careful, honey. I’m sensitive.” And well, <em> that </em> was a sentence she didn’t expect to come out of her mouth. She was hardly ever that receptive. <em> Definitely a thought to brush past. </em></p><p>Rio nodded fast, pupils blown. “Sorry, it’s just too g—“ she swallowed, “you’re too good. I’m excited.” She nodded to herself.</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “I can see that.” She released her, drew a thumb over her jaw and went to play with her earlobe.</p><p>The way Rio looked up at her, like she held the whole world in her hands… It was dangerous, but it felt <em> so good. </em></p><p>She didn’t deserve it.<br/>She wasn’t letting it go.</p><p>Rio’s eyes shifted between hers for a few moments until Agatha moved to lightly kiss her, sucking on her bottom lip. Her chest ached a bit.</p><p>Once she’d pulled back, the ghost of a smile on her lips, Rio resumed her work. She was softer this time, slower. With every path drawn by her tongue, Agatha’s waves of need rippled up her body, until Rio moved away from her breasts and down her abdomen.</p><p>Agatha’s abs quivered with the kisses as she stared and stared at Rio, so concentrated, her eyes closed, drawing waves of pleasure out of her with such dedication. By the time Rio’s mouth sucked at the skin right above her panties, Agatha’s world was hazy with need.</p><p>Rio’s hands traveled up the insides of her thighs, making them tremble pathetically, and when a thumb drew under the lateral hem of purple lace, Agatha drew in an embarrassingly shaky breath.</p><p>She didn’t have time to regret it. Rio kissed the inside of her thighs, and licked, and bit, the want turned a dull pain pulsating in Agatha’s clit. Then, she went down and kissed her over the lace.</p><p>Agatha’s head threw back, she leant on both hands against the mattress behind her, sucking in her lower lip to bite back a moan, but it came out deep and throaty. She felt her clit wanting to betray her, to give her a release too soon–<em> again </em>, and had to suppress it.</p><p>Rio didn’t help. She moaned hard as she sucked on her through the lace, hands hooking below her legs and pulling them up to spread her, fingers pressing into the sensitive skin of her thighs, and Agatha felt like she would burst into flames. The need pooling in her lower abdomen had turned into a fucking pit of hell.</p><p>“<em> Fuck </em>, Rio…” she breathed out, husky voice, and Rio hummed, vibrations making her legs tremble in Rio’s arms.</p><p>Rio put a few inches between them, giving her time to breathe, and Agatha didn’t even have to mourn her because she looked up in pure, beastly lust—Agatha accidentally<em> groaned.  </em></p><p>The resident smiled, her teeth showing, and she felt intoxicated, hips bucking uselessly in Rio’s hands.</p><p>“<em> Can I eat you out? </em>” Rio murmured throatily, and the needy intensity, the contrast with her previous expression—it was startling.</p><p>Agatha gulped. She was completely gone. Who was she to deny Rio anything? If she asked for it, Agatha would hand her all control.</p><p>So what she said was: “You do realize how stupid it sounds when you keep asking so late into the…” she gestured between them, “into the act, do you?” she managed to huff out through her haze. A credit to her self-mastery.</p><p>“Just say yes, <em> Agatha </em>. I know you want it too.” </p><p>She arched an eyebrow at Rio, unmoving–the resident got the hint right away.</p><p>“Please, I didn’t mean... <em> Please </em> let me eat you out.” Her breath was hot against Agatha’s thighs, the whiny vibration to her voice like honey melting down her throat, and Agatha couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>“Do it.” She sounded way steadier than she felt.</p><p>Rio pushed her down to the mattress, and Agatha was ready to buck her hips up, but the resident didn’t take her panties off right away.</p><p>She carefully hooked a finger below the hem and moved it aside, and Agatha’s hips thrusted up at nothing. <em> Oh my fucking God, </em> was all her brain could conjure.<br/>“ <em> Fuck, </em>I hate you, stop teasing—” was all her mouth could say.</p><p>Rio nodded and she inched in, spread her open, and her warm breath was <em> right there </em>, and Agatha’s caught–</p><p>“You don’t hate me.” She had the audacity to smirk up at her. “Considering how drenched you are, I think you must like me very, <em> very </em> much.” And before Agatha could think of a retort, she licked her outer lips—bottom to top, taking her time, like a devout kneeled at her altar. Agatha swore, arching into her. She was going to fucking die. She wanted to drag it out as long as possible this time, but it was <em> so intense, so fucking hard </em>. As soon as Rio got to her clit, she would… </p><p>Hiding her face in her elbow, she tried to concentrate on breathing. <em> Be less pathetic. </em></p><p>She failed miserably, of course. Rio’s tongue went to put a slow, torturous pressure at her entrance, and Agatha bit on her own arm as she let out a high-pitched moan.</p><p>Rio’s tongue dipped inside her. Agatha bit harder, oblivious to the pain in her arm. She needed her on her clit, she needed her right then and there, like she’d never needed anything ever before. She was going to tell her, she was going to…</p><p>“Up.” Rio closed her legs and moved them aside, sliding her underwear off when Agatha complied. Agatha’s brain was a melted mess, her breathing unsteady, and she let Rio manoeuvre her around her head, legs on her shoulders, her feet tangling behind Rio’s back.</p><p>And she was <em> this </em> close to kindly asking her to get on with it. She never <em> pleaded </em>. Never. But then again, she’d never had Rio’s mouth that close to her cunt and not doing anything. </p><p>Thank Jesus or whomever, Rio was merciful: only stopping to suck hard on the inside of her thigh, likely leaving a mark—not that Agatha cared right now—she was suddenly on her cunt, tongue curling around her clit, hot and wet and <em> fucking perfect </em>. It sent an intense first wave up Agatha’s body, which turned into a loud moan, then more with each new stroke.</p><p>And Agatha could barely register her own pants and the swearing, pressure building relentlessly under Rio’s mouth, sucking and licking in mysterious shapes and lapping up her entrance and over her clit…</p><p>Rio gradually added pressure in circles around her clit, and Agatha was crying out her fucking <em> name. “Rio </em>, more–” She tangled a hand in her hair, pulling her closer, Rio complying with a low moan that brought her ridiculously close to the edge.</p><p>“Oh my fucking <em> god </em>, Rio, mmhf—“ she got cut off by her own breath hitching when Rio’s fingers spread her open and her tongue went flat all over her, and the pressure in her body almost snapped. She held it back, hips snapping away and back arching, her breath stuttering out. She wanted Rio inside her, before—</p><p>But Rio’s mouth was too sweet, her fingers playing around to aid it in its devilish works were treacherous, and she forcefully dragged Agatha over the edge. <br/>She cried out Rio’s name, forgetting all about hiding her face as she fisted the sheets and dug her nails behind Rio’s neck, hips stuttering uncontrollably against her face, legs shaking around her head.</p><p>Pleasure rippled through her body and it felt almost too intense until it exploded, her own voice a muffled cry in her ears, for Rio, for more, Rio, Rio, <em> Rio </em>. </p><p>And Rio guided her through it, a hand painting her wetness over her breast and splaying against the center of her chest, grounding her in her breaking, her shattering.</p><p>When the waves of pleasure started to subside and melt into darkness, Rio slowed down with her. And once it was over, the area swollen and tender, Rio gave it a small, lightly overstimulating peck and rudely dried her cheeks against the inside of her thighs. <br/><em> Brat </em>.</p><p>She then manoeuvred her to slide to the centre of the bed, splaying herself over her between her legs, slowly sliding their tangled hands over her head as she went to lean on one elbow to look at her.</p><p>Agatha let her do all of that, still trying to catch her breath, eyes barely open to take it in. <em> This one hadn’t been short. </em></p><p>“Hmm, look how compliant,” Rio’s eyes signalled to her hands being held over her head, ”Who knew breaking the mighty Agatha Harkness would be this easy?”</p><p>Agatha huffed. Under Rio’s proud smile, in the silver light of the full moon, her chin glistened with Agatha’s wetness. She reached out to wipe it off with her thumb, Rio easily letting her wrists go.</p><p>“You’ve broken nothing. You’ve simply bent to my will.” She murmured, looking up at her. Unacceptable, above all: she didn’t feel like hating her at all.</p><p>“Maybe I did.” Rio mused. She kissed her lips, Agatha’s hand cupping her cheek. It was too soft, but Agatha couldn’t keep herself from taking it. <em> She wanted it all </em>. </p><p>And then Rio kissed her jaw, sending a dull want through her again, and she slithered a hand between her legs–</p><p>“<em> More, </em>” she said, and Agatha whined into her ear.</p><p>“Wait, I-I can’t.” Stuttering<em>.</em> <em>Hell</em> no.</p><p>“You can’t do more than one–wait, <em> no </em>, two?” A proud smile cracked through her curious tone.</p><p>“No, I just–let me <em> breathe </em> , <em> okay </em>?” It had been fucking intense. She wasn’t sure she could take more right away. </p><p>She ended up finding out.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>***</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>She stirred, something tickling her nose, someone in her arms. <em> Agatha. </em></p><p>She was spooning Agatha, her frame satisfyingly complementing Rio’s, and a smile took over her whole face. Last night had been a blast.</p><p>Somehow, they’d maneuvered themselves into the sheets during the night, and after a minute of bashing in Agatha’s quiet warmth as her brain wired awake, Rio carefully removed her arm from Agatha’s grip and lifted the sheets a few inches to take a peek.</p><p><em> Score </em>.</p><p>Agatha was deep asleep, and she didn’t even stir when Rio sat up and settled the sheets back up to her naked shoulders. Her lips were slightly parted, a little drool puddle staining her pillow, and Rio’s smile turned into a full-toothed grin.</p><p>
<em> Super score. </em>
</p><p>She got off the bed, clumsily hit her pinky toe against the bedside table–how? It wasn’t even in the way–but her whispered cursing and jumping around didn’t wake Agatha either. </p><p><em> Cool, cool. </em> Agatha-the-mighty-purple-witch was a heavy sleeper.</p><p>Rubbing the sleepiness out of her eyes, Rio looked around for some random clothes and found a small pile on a chair. She grabbed a faded black tee and purple shorts (Agatha seemed to have a favourite color) and put them on, inhaling at the tee’s neck. <br/>It smelled like last night’s memories, and even though Agatha was right in front of her, it gave her that sense of melancholy at something past that other people’s clothes often did.</p><p>She looked over Agatha for a short while to make it go away. She really, <em> really </em> wished she could take a picture, but Agatha would throw her out the window if she did. <br/>That made her smile.</p><p>Tiptoeing around, she left the room and found a bathroom outside Agatha’s bedroom, guessing the room right at the first door she opened. Through the haze from the previous night, she remembered the apartment was big, definitely too big for one person. It had a homey feeling to it even though everything was neat and polished, the living room especially in dark colors. <br/>Well, neat except for the books. Agatha had books everywhere, sometimes in small stacks. Rio even found a couple in the bathroom. </p><p>She looked at them as she peed. One was a few years prior’s review on Neurosurgery research, <em> weird </em> , and one was… a kid’s book on bugs? <em> Super weird. </em></p><p>As she washed her hands, looking at her reflection in the mirror, Rio smirked. First of all, Agatha’s clothes were made to be on her and she would <em> so </em> “borrow” them. Second of all, a raised, red nail mark drew all the way from behind her ear to her clavicle. <em> Sweet </em>. Agatha would love a reminder of what she’d done (as in, she’d hate Rio rubbing it in her face every chance she got). </p><p>Pulling down the tee’s neck, she found her shoulder sported a couple red-purplish marks. She remembered those. She’d been deep into Agatha when her teeth had sunk into her shoulder.<br/>Her reflection in the mirror looked insane at the memory, pupils swallowing her irises. <em> Fun </em>.</p><p>Okay, out. She’d do some exploring, wait for Agatha to wake, ravage her some more.</p><p>Feet bare against the cool wooden slatted floors, Rio passed the living room. A plushie on the couch caught her eye–<em> not </em> something she pictured Agatha owning. She picked it up, the need to squish the soft penguin between her hands impossible to ignore, then set it in the crook of her elbow, petting it as she looked around–</p><p>Her stomach growled. <em> Hungry </em>. She put the plushie back and walked away.</p><p>She was in the kitchen next, opened the fridge as she ignored the thought that Agatha wouldn’t love someone to be all up in her stuff, and looked for eggs. Agatha wouldn’t be able to complain if Rio shoved some food in her mouth <em> and then something else in her pussy </em>. </p><p>She chuckled to herself.</p><p>When she closed the fridge, hands happily closed around her prize, she noticed the drawing attached to the side. A cat? Some kind of four-legged animal? Unless Agatha had some unlikely hobbies and a remarkable inability to hold crayons, it was definitely made by a child. Probably the child in the picture next to it. It was a toddler, and those people around him were–Doctor Maximoff, Doctor Kale and Lilia? </p><p>Huh, Alice hadn’t told her anything about Doctor Kale having kids, and Lilia didn’t have any. The neurosurgeon’s child it was, then.</p><p>As she turned and set the eggs on the counter, looking for a pan, someone rang what Rio supposed was the doorbell. She frowned in confusion as she shut a cupboard and, soothingly rubbing her scalp, went to open the door. </p><p>Behind it was a tall man she’d already seen around–Vision, was it? Dr. Maximoff’s husband. He was holding a short kid’s hand. Looked like the one in the picture on the fridge, just older.</p><p>“Oh, hello.” The guy said, polite and a bit surprised. “You’re a colleague of Wanda and Agatha’s, right?” Rio nodded. “The porter let us into the building. Is Agatha home?”</p><p>Rio stared at his nice, unjudging face, and the kid preceded her:<br/>“Are you her new friend?”</p><p>She looked down at him, his brown hair and brown eyes, the way he smiled at her giving a natural sense of kinship. Cute kid.</p><p>“I am.” She smiled back. “Are <em> you </em> her friend?”</p><p>“No, silly! She’s my mama!” he laughed and pulled at Vision’s hand.</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>She–what? </p><p>Agatha had a son?</p><p>She looked between the kid and Vision, the man smiling apologetically. </p><p>“He stayed over at Wanda’s and mine, but he really wanted to see Agatha this morning. Can I leave him with you?”</p><p>“I, uh–” Rio stuttered, “She’s asleep, I– I think.” The kid looked expectantly up at her. “Yeah, you can, if that’s ok with…” she didn’t even know his name. “Is that okay with you?” She asked the boy.</p><p>He stood on tiptoe, Vision letting go of his hand as he urged Rio to squat down.</p><p>“Don’t wanna wake mama up, she gets cranky.” He whispered into her ear, hands on both sides of his mouth, then he checked on Vision with a serious look. He’d obviously heard everything, but he pretended not to.</p><p>“Cranky, huh? Pretty big word.” Rio whispered back.</p><p>“Shhh!” He covered her mouth with a sticky hand and Rio made a mental note to wash her face later.</p><p>She stood back up.</p><p>“This is Nicholas’ stuff.” Vision handed her a small bag. “Thanks,” he added, and Rio smiled back at him, on autopilot.</p><p>The kid, Nicholas, took her hand and dragged her inside, and Rio waved at a smiling Vision over her shoulder as he shut the door behind them.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>******</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Can you cook better than mama?” </p><p>“I don’t know. Is she really good?”</p><p>Nicholas shook his head. “Aunty Jen says she can’t cook,” he whispered. “But don’t tell mama I told you.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened. She’d never thought about Agatha’s cooking abiilties, but if what the kid said was right, it was an interesting contrast to her precision in the OR. </p><p>As minutes passed, she’d gotten more relaxed around Nicholas. She could survive this kid. She’d taken care of way too many children as she grew up, in foster care and her adoptive family, and then she’d stopped. She never thought of going back, nor did she feel the need to. Maybe she even actively avoided it.</p><p>But Nicholas was fine, after all. He was funny. Easier than she remembered. Might be less problematic than the average child she’d been around-which said something about Agatha as a parent. Something great.<br/><em> <br/>He was definitely not as challenging as Rio had been .  </em></p><p>“I won’t. Pass the spatula.” </p><p>She’d sat the kid on the kitchen counter, and he was directing her on how to find cutlery or just passing her stuff. Made him feel included and it made it easier for Rio to keep him in one spot.</p><p>“But I like it when mama cooks.” Nicholas clumsily passed her the black spatula. “Josh cooks super good!” </p><p>“Who’s Josh?” Rio asked, a pang of jealousy lightly twisting her stomach. Did Agatha have a guy over regularly?</p><p>“My manny!”</p><p>Rio hummed. Not Agatha’s lover then, hopefully. That would be a twist… she didn’t picture Agatha as the nanny-fucking type, but you never knew. She’d thought Agatha was gay too, but then apparently she’d been married to a man. Not that labels mattered much-she was just curious. As long as Agatha didn't like <em>one</em> specific man-</p><p>“Rio?” Nicholas’ small feet curled around a wooden spoon she’d made the mistake of leaving too close. She let him have it to play with and got a clean one, the sharp edge of jealousy-maybe insecurity?-lingering under the surface.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Do you know my dad?”</p><p>Rio briefly looked at him. He wasn’t smiling anymore; he seemed curious.</p><p>“Nope.” She flipped a pancake in the pan, and Nicholas gaped at it. “Why are you asking?”</p><p>He took a second to remember what she was talking about, then- “I want to see my dad. Do you know where he is?”</p><p><em> Huh </em>. Weird. Maybe that was a conversation for Agatha to oversee.</p><p>“No, I’m sorry. Have you tried asking your mom?”</p><p>“Mama says he feels bad, but he will be better soon. But then she’s sad.”</p><p>Rio’s mind swirled. Was his father sick? What was wrong with him? How long had it been?</p><p>“Why can’t I visit him? I didn’t see dad for ten years!” Nicholas continued. He was still sounding curious, but also a little distressed, and Rio was afraid it wasn’t her place to fix this. Also, ten years sounded impossible: the kid looked half that age.</p><p>“How old are you?” She asked as she settled a pancake on the little pancake tower they’d built.</p><p>“I just turned four!” He showed her his hand, four fingers out. Made sense.</p><p>“Wow, you’re almost my age.” Rio set the dirty pan in the sink, “I don’t know why you can’t see your dad, but I’m sure your mom can explain. And I’m sure there’s a good reason for it. Even if she gets sad, you can ask her, okay?” She doubted Agatha would prefer her son not talking to her. And if she did, she was wrong.</p><p>Nicholas nodded, distracted as he stole a piece of pancake from the bottom of the pile, as if that would make it harder for Rio to notice. </p><p>Rio laughed. “Ha, thief!” She playfully moved the dish away but the kid tried to get up and follow it, all bubbly laugh and clumsiness, and Rio’s heart sank as he moved to the margin of the counter. She stepped in front of him, pancake dish balanced in one hand, and he practically climbed onto her, arms hooking around her neck as he pointlessly reached for the plate.</p><p>Rio hooked an arm around him, let him sit on her hip and set the pancake dish down again to use both arms. The boy was heavy. </p><p>“Does your mama drink coffee with her breakfast?” She asked, and Nicholas nodded as he played with her dagger necklace.</p><p>“Alright. Let’s make her coffee then, can you help me?”</p><p>“Yeah! I know how mama does it!”</p><p>Rio turned around to look for the coffee machine, and the corner of her eye caught something. <br/><em> Someone </em>. She turned back. Agatha was coming to a halt at the kitchen door, barefoot and wearing a purple nightgown with a plants and snakes pattern. She looked at her in what Rio might have described as pretty well-hidden terror. </p><p>Then, Nicholas stopped concentrating on playing with her hair and looked at his mom, and Agatha smiled. It was the softest smile Rio had ever seen on her. </p><p>Her stomach knotted. <em> She wanted to see more. </em></p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>*****</p><p>The first view she got was utterly terrifying.</p><p>Nicky was sitting on Vidal’s hip, both her arms wrapped around him as his weight made her lean back. The resident looked so comfortable, Nicky smiling so bright, Agatha could have sworn they’d known each other since forever. Of course, she knew better. </p><p>“Mama! We cooked you breakfast!”</p><p>Agatha felt like digging a big hole in the ground and lying down for, say, two thousand years. When Nicky looked at her with that huge grin, though, she couldn’t help but smile.</p><p>“Did you cook? I’m scared.” She joked, and Nicky pouted. </p><p>“I can cook, mama! I can cook!” He kicked in protest, hitting Rio in the process. Agatha went and took him from her as Vidal laughed around a painful grimace, then helped him to sit around the kitchen island.</p><p>“What did I tell you about kicking your feet when people are holding you?” she said, and Nicky, still pouting, turned to Rio. </p><p>“Sorry, Rio.” he said. </p><p>“Thanks for making breakfast.” Agatha kissed Nicky’s head, and he finally stopped pouting. She looked over to Rio, unsure exactly what to do. She wanted her out, but like, <em> before </em>she’d met Nicky. Out of her stuff, out of her private life, out…</p><p>But the damage was done, wasn’t it?</p><p>And Rio looked pretty as ever as she fixed her hair in a fast bun, hairband between her teeth. Her neck was showing now, and the many piercings in her ears, and… had she made that mark to the side of her neck? <em> Well, shit. </em> </p><p>Rio must have noticed her eyes roaming, cause she now wore a faint smirk.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “Thanks,” she told her, then made herself busy making coffee and setting the table. “What happened? I meant to go get Nicky by lunchtime. Didn’t mean to have you ambushed.”</p><p>“It’s ok,” Rio cut in as she helped her however she could, “he missed you. He told me how scary you get if someone wakes you, so we chose to live.” She chuckled, and Agatha rolled her eyes. </p><p>“Nicky, you sold me out to the enemy?” </p><p>He looked up at her in dismay. “But mama, Rio said she’s your friend!”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Yeah yeah, I was joking. Here,” She set a fork in his left hand–he seemed to be a leftie like her–and went to sit.</p><p>Rio leaned against the island, looking uncertain, lips pursed in thought and eyes roaming the room. “I, uhm… Should I…”</p><p>“Sit.” Agatha ordered, and when Rio’s eyes widened, she recognised the memory from last night in the faint blush of her cheeks. As Rio complied, Agatha guessed she herself sported some of the same blush. Probably more so, if the heat in her cheeks was any indication.<br/>She swallowed.</p><p>“Rio, why do you have mama’s clothes?” Nicky asked as he hardly managed to cut a piece of pancake with the side of the fork, using both hands.</p><p>“It’s ‘Why are you wearing mama’s clothes’, munchkin,” Agatha corrected. She smirked in Rio’s direction, “And <em> yes, </em>Rio, why are you?”</p><p>The resident wasn’t impressed. She raised her eyebrows at her, smiled and popped a piece of pancake in her mouth. “I met a werewolf who woke up naked after the full moon and needed clothes, so I gave her mine,” she said, not even waiting to be finished chewing her food. <em> Ugh </em>, it was like having an adult-sized version of Nicky in her kitchen. </p><p>Then again, Jen loved to tell her she was a messy eater, so maybe <em> she </em> was the adult-sized Nicky.<br/>Whatever.</p><p>“And mama gave you her clothes?” the boy talked with his mouth full as well.</p><p>“Yeah!” She nodded with a grin.</p><p>“Nicky, don’t talk with your mouth full.” </p><p>“But Rio did it!”</p><p>“So what, are you going to do everything she does now?”</p><p>Nicky actually thought about it, chewing with his mouth closed as he looked at Agatha.<br/>“Sometimes,” he said.</p><p>Rio laughed a bubbly laugh, and Agatha couldn’t even find it in herself to stare daggers at her. The blueberry pancakes were freaking delicious, and the scrambled eggs too. What sort of witchery had she used, and did Agatha even have whatever those spices or herbs were in her apartment?</p><p>“If you talk with your mouth full, you’re going to bite your tongue,” Agatha settled for, and hoped Nicky would listen. He was staring at Rio like he was in love, took a sip of milk when Rio drank her latte, and then he switched the fork to his right hand like her.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. <em> Fine </em>. Let her be the cool novelty.</p><p>“Do you want my socks?” Nicky suddenly asked Rio, and she looked at him in confusion.</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“Mama didn’t give you socks.” He explained like it was obvious, pointing at Rio’s naked feet to his side.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio huffed out a laugh, “I don’t think yours can fit. You have tiny feet.”</p><p>“Mama, give Rio your socks!”</p><p>Vidal smiled at her with a cheek full like a chipmunk with a nut, and Agatha sighed dramatically.</p><p>“Fine. She can get all my clothes, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>******</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The next thing Rio knew, she was standing in Agatha’s room, Nicky temporarily left to play on the floor of the living room.</p><p>“Catch.” Agatha threw her a pair of socks, and she caught them mid-air and put them on. “Thanks for watching him. It wasn’t my plan, surely wasn’t yours, uhm…” she trailed off. Something Agatha never did, really. She must be uncomfortable. <em> Nice. </em></p><p>“It’s okay. It was fun.” Rio debated whether to make her more uncomfortable, quickly choosing to do so, because every chance at poking Agatha was a gift. “Definitely worth seeing what a softie you are.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. <em> Fun.<br/></em> “I’m not a softie.” She stepped in front of her, and Rio wondered if she was going to kiss her. Were they on kissing grounds? Would Agatha let her get close, or did she want last night to be a one-time thing? Rio didn’t want it to be a one-time thing, and up till recently, she hadn’t even thought it could be, but—Agatha had a <em> son </em>. </p><p>That changed everything, didn’t it?</p><p>But her eyes were such a comforting blue, and they were staring right through her, and… wait, Agatha was telling her something, and Rio was getting distracted by her perfect, godly face.</p><p>“…don’t have to.” Agatha concluded, still close enough that Rio could have easily pulled her into a hug.</p><p>“I, uh…” she scratched the nape of her neck. “Sorry, got distracted. What?”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow at her. “I said I know it’s hard to say no to kids, maybe harder when they’re not yours, but he’ll survive. You don’t need to go to the museum with us.”</p><p>Ooh. That.</p><p>"No worries, I can say no to kids, I’ve done it plenty of times. Just the other day a kid really wanted to give me a cookie and I said no.” Agatha looked at her like she was waiting for the story to end, so Rio shrugged. “He cried a little.” </p><p>“Why didn’t you take it?”</p><p>“I wasn’t hungry.”</p><p>There was a short pause.</p><p>“Aaallright,” Agatha clapped her hands together, “you’re crazy, but we already knew that. You could have taken the cookie and given it to someone else, but that would have been too normal,” she made finger quotes at the last word, and Rio’s lips curled up to one side.</p><p>“<em> Please </em>, you would have taken the cookie, poisoned it, and given it back to the child.”</p><p>Agatha put a hand to her chest, feigning shock. “I would never! Stop spreading lies. I don’t bite.” She spun around and started walking to the door, then paused and looked at Rio over her shoulder.</p><p>“Well, I did bite a kid once.” She winked, and Rio could have melted and died on the spot. For a moment, looking at Agatha’s hair swinging over her back, she did just that.</p><p>How was she that cool?</p><p>Rio put both hands in the pouch of Agatha’s hoodie she was wearing, tucked her chin against the perfume on her chest and, reluctantly, she walked out.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>******</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Nicky was obsessed with Rio that day, so much so that Agatha could have considered retiring from her job as a mother. Of course, she knew it was just a matter of time before the novelty wore off and he went back to normal, but it was still fun to watch.</p><p>Maybe too much fun. </p><p>Nicky was still kinda short, forcing Rio to sometimes to hunch down to one side as he pulled her around by her hand. Agatha knew exactly how tiring that was-“Thank you very much,” secretly said her back to Rio.</p><p>The resident walked Nicky all the way through his favorite part of the museum as she told him overly detailed stories on some of the bugs. How she ever had time to learn that much about bugs, Agatha would never understand.</p><p>Nicky, though, seemed to be having the time of his life. It went on for so long, Rio’s endurance started being surprising. Agatha herself, as used as she was to standing in the OR for hours on end, started craving a break. Luckily, Nicky was still easy to tire out, and he soon asked to be picked up. </p><p>They went around a little longer like that, Nicky holding Agatha’s neck as Rio answered his questions on dinosaurs and felines and whatever else. Thank god for glass encasings, because Nicky lunged to grab museum objects more than once.</p><p>They soon ended up in the museum gardens, Rio sighing in content the instant she got to sit on a bench. </p><p>“God, I’d forgotten how tiring kids are.” She said in a low voice, a faint smile on her nonetheless. Nicky was using the last of his energy to roam around the garden close by. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes didn’t leave him as she spoke: “How did you know it in the first place?” Did she have any friend or relative with young kids?<br/>Agatha put her hands in her pockets, standing around. She didn’t really feel like sitting next to Rio. Right now, as far away as possible was best. Rio didn’t want kids, and she’d been way too nice to Nicky. <em> Way too nice to her </em>. But Agatha knew how this worked; she had friends who loved to be around Nicky and still didn’t want children themselves, so…</p><p>“Foster kids and my siblings,” Rio replied matter-of-factly.</p><p>“Weren’t you a child yourself then?” Nicky started a slow walk back to them, something in his hands. </p><p>“Yeah.” When Agatha glanced at her, she shrugged.</p><p>“Mama, up!” Nicky ordered as he tried to climb onto the bench with his hands full. Agatha didn’t comply right away.</p><p>“Up, what?” </p><p>“Up, please!”</p><p>Agatha helped him sit next to Rio. <em> He </em> certainly didn’t have any worries about being too close to her. Agatha wished he could stay that careless–or clueless?–forever.</p><p>“Rio, Rio, look!” and <em> wow </em>, the ultimate Nicky offer. He carried little pebbles in different colors. Agatha would have been jealous, but she only had space for relief that he hadn’t tried to accidentally suffocate by munching on the stones.</p><p>“Oh, <em> score </em>.” Rio brightened, opening her palms for Nicky to drop the pebbles. “Are these for me?”</p><p>Nicky hummed in thought, “I want this one,” he grabbed a white one, “And you have to give mama one.” He ran his little fingers through them, turning them over.</p><p>“Sounds good, which one?” With a grin, she looked up at Agatha, who suddenly felt like looking away. Like she was getting caught looking at something she shouldn’t.</p><p>“This!” Nicky pointed at one, and Rio shifted all the pebbles to one palm and took that one between two fingers. </p><p>“Nice. It’s black, like my heart.” She handed it to her, Agatha schooling her face into <em>not</em> blushing. <em>That would be stupid</em> <em>as</em> <em>hell</em>. Why did Rio have to say things like that when they both knew they were meaningless?</p><p>She took the pebble and dropped it in her pocket anyway.</p><p>A minute later, after making sure Rio put her pebbles away and giving his to Agatha, Nicky had gradually and shamelessly managed to lie down on the bench, his head on Rio’s lap, and magically fallen asleep in all of two seconds.</p><p>Agatha went to pick him up, but when she reached for him, Rio’s hand shot out to her forearm.</p><p>“It’s ok. Leave him.” She sounded relaxed, her arm slung over the back of the bench, so Agatha let it be.</p><p>“Fine. Do you want a coffee then, or something?” She gestured toward the cafeteria.</p><p>“Or something.” Rio gave her a smug smile, but under Agatha’s unimpressed stare, she briefly looked away and only partly lost the smugness. “Iced latte, please.”</p><p>“Great.” She stopped mid-step right after starting to walk away– “If you don’t wanna lose your job, don’t lose my son.” She gestured that she’d keep an eye on her, and Rio chuckled.</p><p>“He’s not going anywhere. Besides, aren’t you the one who freaked out about involving work in this?” She beamed.</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Well fuck you, I knew I couldn’t trust you.” She flipped her off and walked. <br/><em> So fucking annoying. </em></p><p>She got both their drinks and walked back, handed Rio hers and almost sat down to her left. She hesitated–that would be too close–and changed her mind, instead sitting to the other side. </p><p>That way, Nicky would keep them apart. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>******</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio all but invited herself over for a very late lunch as soon as Nicky asked Agatha if she could stay, both looking up at her with unlawfully well-practiced pouts. </p><p>That combination was dangerous. </p><p>She should keep Rio away from Nicky in the future, cause <em> hell no </em> . She would probably let them do anything if they asked her like that, <em> together </em>. </p><p>And<em> god, </em> she hated Rio. Just a reminder for herself. <br/>Okay, maybe hate was a strong word by now, but she certainly didn’t like her much. Rio was fun, sure, and smart, and Nicky <em> really </em>liked her, and both of them had today off work. That was all there was to it.</p><p>And her stupid little crush? She’d meant to take care of it by sleeping with Rio, and it had worked. It had totally worked; she didn’t feel any attraction anymore, no she didn’t. She hadn’t spent the day measuring every line of her face, watching her eyes light up at her own stupid bug jokes, looking away every time the thought of Rio wearing her clothes made her smile. She 100%, for sure, had <em> not </em> spent the day holding pride for the scratch Rio sported down her neck. </p><p>Nope.</p><p>Once the pizza boxes were almost empty and discarded on the coffee table in front of the couch, Nicky napping in his room and a couple of wine glasses in Agatha and Rio’s hands, the latter splayed herself on the sofa. </p><p>The tip of her foot poked Agatha’s side.</p><p>“You don’t have to sit that far. I’m not plagued,” she complained, voice petulant, and Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“You can annoy me just as well from a distance.”</p><p>Rio smiled one of her <em> dumb </em> lopsided smiles, and Agatha looked away and took a sip. “Well, it wasn’t too weird today, was it?” She asked without much thought, sagging into the couch, talking to herself more than anything.</p><p>Being around Rio had been intense. Constantly having to guard herself, her mind studying Rio’s every move. Intense, yeah. <em> Exhausting.<br/></em>Now—be it the food, the tiredness, or both—she was finally winding down.</p><p>“Why would it be weird?” </p><p>Of course she’d say that. She was probably one of those people who just <em> go with the flow </em> , right? Not a single brain cell behind their eyes, just getting carried away by anything that feels right in the moment. <br/>Agatha hated those people. How carefree they were. </p><p>“I don’t know–for once, anytime you’re around, it gets weird.” She settled for a joke, too deflated to make it sound sarcastic as she wished.</p><p>Rio’s foot flexed against her ribs, and she considered cutting it off. But then again, even the small contact was… Her body craved it. </p><p>
<em> That’s exactly why you should cut it off. </em>
</p><p>“Do you let people into your life easily?” Rio asked, ignoring her completely. “Maybe that’s what feels weird to you.” She paused, giving Agatha time to huff out a breath. “Letting me–uh–someone, <em> see </em> you.” The correction was interesting. She was trying to make the talk more generic, not about herself. But Agatha was too tired to fathom why.</p><p>“You don’t know anything about me, I suggest you stop guessing.” There was an edge to her voice now, maybe Rio had hit too close to home.</p><p>“Okay, so tell me.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Tell me about you.” She played with the edge of her glass, then managed to sip on it without sitting up.</p><p>“You drop that on my sweater, I drop you in the middle of the ocean and let you drown,” she said quietly.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “<em> That </em>, I could have guessed. Tell me something I don’t know.”</p><p>And because Agatha’s defenses were low, she chuckled too. “You’ve already seen too much. Your turn.”</p><p>“Sure,” Rio seemed to perk up at that, her eyes sparkled, her fingers tapped on glass. “What do you want to know? Ask me anything.” As simple as that. </p><p>Agatha studied her. She had a little double chin now with her head resting like that against the armrest. <em> Cute. </em> Her eyes wandered over Rio’s face.</p><p><em> “What do you see in me that makes you want to be around?” </em> She was never going to ask that. It wasn’t the point anyways, and she knew the answer. Rio simply had a meaningless crush, and once–scratch that– <em> if </em> she saw what was inside her, she’d run.</p><p>Then, she remembered something: “Why were you transferred here from your previous hospital?”</p><p>Rio’s smile didn’t drop; it vanished so gradually, it felt like it had never been there at all. She looked back at Agatha with sharp eyes, like something ancient and secret hid behind them, and then she cocked her head. </p><p>In a heartbeat, all that was gone.</p><p>“I broke some rules, couldn’t stay.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “So much for asking you anything. You just said nothing.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio pursed her lips as she looked up at the ceiling, “unlucky, it’s the one thing I legally can’t say. I signed an NDA over it.”</p><p>“What? Who made you sign an—” The hospital, obviously. But wasn’t it… “Wasn’t it also one of your parents’ hospitals?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Long story. Can’t disclose. Sorry.” She shrugged with an apologetic look. “Ask anything except this?”</p><p>“I don’t want to ask something else. Just tell me, I can keep a secret.” She smirked, hoping it would make Rio bulge. </p><p>It didn’t. Good for her, she had a decent amount of self-control. Based on her work antics, on the way she flirted, Agatha never would have guessed it. </p><p>“Nu-huh,” was her only answer.</p><p>“Come on,” her voice went sultry, and Rio took a healthy gulp of wine. Agatha’s fingers trailed over her ankle and up her calf. “<em> Please </em> ,” she added. Rio grew still, her stare unwavering. She was definitely starting to <em> feel </em> something.</p><p>If she’d been any fuck-buddy Agatha had ever had before, she would have sat up. She would have slowly climbed over Rio’s legs and sat around her hips. Her fingers would have drawn the lengths of Rio’s clavicles as she spoke words sweet as honey, hips rolling so slowly Rio would have thought it was all in her mind.<br/>Rio would have blushed that pretty, flustered blush she offered whenever Agatha took her by surprise, her heart racing in her chest below Agatha’s palms.<br/>And then, after getting exactly what she wanted, Agatha would have kissed her.</p><p>She didn’t do any of that. Because it was Rio, and she had too much influence on her mood as it was. She had too much <em> potential </em> .<br/>The want tugging at her lower abdomen at that very moment was a tell. Her heartbeat drumming in her ears was another.</p><p>Rio hadn’t spoken since Agatha’s brain had started giving her all of those <em> terrible </em> ideas, but her eyes were darker than before, and Agatha wondered if she’d had some of the same thoughts.</p><p>She cleared her throat.<br/>“Alright,” she said in a forcefully lighter mood, “Tell me about your siblings then.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>******</p><p> </p><p>So, Rio’s family was complicated. There were so many of them, Agatha was surprised it wasn't <em>more</em> complicated.<br/>Rio seemed to love all her siblings, even though Agatha got the impression she was skimming over stuff that nagged at her as she superficially mentioned some issues.<br/>She shared quite a bit, the conversation a lazy stream of back-and-forth questions. Agatha never really answered any of Rio's, managing to turn the talk to her each time, but if the resident noticed, she pretended not to. </p><p>At some point, Agatha’s hand had gone to stroke over Rio’s ankle. It felt good, like she was meant to, like she had something to hold on to–and so it had stayed. </p><p>Not that she needed anything to hold on to. </p><p>Rio certainly hadn’t protested. Her feet had wiggled around for a few seconds, and Agatha hadn’t even bit back the smile taking her lips.</p><p>At some point, Agatha was so sleepy, walls down, that when Rio looked at her earnestly and said, “I need to tell you something,” her heartbeat took a while to react.</p><p>There was a silence. Agatha’s chest heaved through the weight on her eyelids, slowly pulling her back awake. <br/>Was Rio going to talk about–what, <em> feelings </em>? No thanks–</p><p>“Nicky asked me about his father.” Agatha didn’t get to feel relieved. She immediately needed to take a deep breath, and the resident looked her right in the eyes, not hard, not soft. Just Rio. </p><p>She wanted to keep that conversation at bay, to run from it as fast as she ran from Jen whenever she tried to drag her to shop for clothes, but it was Nicky. <br/>He deserved better.</p><p>“What exactly?”</p><p>“He wanted to know where he was. He asked why he’s not seeing him.” </p><p>Rio didn’t look at her with pity, nor with judgment or anger. She just looked, overwhelmingly calm, and Agatha’s fingers twitched around her empty wine glass.</p><p>“Do you want to know?” she asked, and she didn’t exactly know why. She let the sense of how strange it was for her to want to share simply drift away.</p><p>Rio nodded, a half smile taking her lips and none of the rest of her features. “Of course,” she said like it was obvious, her foot curling against Agatha’s ribs.<br/>It wasn’t obvious to Agatha. No one ever gave a shit about other people, not really. She could count the ones that <em> maybe </em> cared about her on the fingers of one hand.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at Rio, pondering. The resident actually looked interested, and not in a gossipy way. Her eyes were focused but soft, hands stiller than usual, as if a sudden movement might scare Agatha away.</p><p>And maybe it would. </p><p>Hell, maybe keeping it all close to her chest, taking care of everything by herself, actually made it easier to be in control. That was what she told herself.<br/>Or <em> maybe </em>, Agatha was just scared. </p><p>So she retreated. It was easier, yes, to go back to her safe place. The space she knew, inside her heart, that no one could reach. </p><p>It was hers. The one place that had always been hers. </p><p>When she switched topics, Rio only frowned for a moment.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>***</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio stretched, set her empty glass on the floor, stretched longer with a high-pitched sound that could have come out of a cat, her feet spreading over Agatha.</p><p>“Watch it, bitch-socks.” She slapped her feet away.</p><p>“Hmm, you hadn’t called me that in a while.” She cocked her head. “I’m hanging out with Alice and… other people, tonight. Do you wanna join?” She pushed through heavy-lidded eyes. Agatha’s stomach unhappily tightened, because it knew her answer even before she had time to muster it.</p><p>“No, I’ll be with Nicky.” She took a deep, satisfying breath. “Tell Jen I said hi, yes?”</p><p>Rio’s deadpan face, which Agatha had almost interpreted as deceived, turned into a smirk. “I will.”</p><p> </p><p>When she eventually got up to leave, Agatha had the distinct feeling she was waiting for her to do something. </p><p>She walked her to the door, opened it for her, said her goodbyes in an automatic manner, stuck in a cycle in her mind. </p><p><em> Kiss her, kiss her, kiss her </em> , her brain kept going, over and over. <em> Kiss her before it’s too late. Kiss her if it’s the last time it happens. Kiss her before she leaves this house, before this whole thing is over. </em></p><p>Rio’s thick lashes batted slowly, her warm-coloured eyes fixed on hers as they often were, concentrated.</p><p>“I’ll give your clothes back in the hospital then,” she said, still not stepping away. </p><p>
<em> She’s so close. Kiss the shit out of her, and with tongue, thank you very much. Kiss. Her. </em>
</p><p>“Leave them in the ORs changing rooms, I’ll find them. Just let me know when you do.” <em> Shut up and kiss her, hug her, touch her arm. Anything at this point, you coward. </em></p><p>Her fingers twitched around the door handle, Rio nodding softly. Her lower lip curled down so imperceptibly, Agatha thought she probably wasn’t aware of it.</p><p>And Agatha wasn’t going to kiss her. It wouldn’t make any fucking sense. Still, that knowledge didn’t stop the voice in her head begging her to.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio looked down. “See you.” She turned to leave, Agatha’s guts begging her to stop her–and suddenly she spun around and leaned in to give Agatha a small hug, one arm wrapping around her waist. </p><p>Agatha didn’t have time to react: in a heartbeat, Rio was gone. Her last view of Rio’s face as she turned away made her chest swell in surprise: Rio was blushing.</p><p>After everything they’d been through, after seeing Agatha naked and moaning her name, that was what made her blush. A two-second hug.</p><p>

<p>
<span>She was mulling over Nicky’s "situation" the next week, a sandwich in one hand as she sat on her favourite bench on the plastic ward rooftop, when Jennifer found her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey bitch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely spared her a glance, still caught in her train of thoughts. “Jen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The other surgeon sat next to her, mirroring Agatha’s pose, legs crossed.<br/>
</span>
<span>“How did it go with Nicky? Lilia told me you had the first appointment a few days ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Great. </span>
</em>
<span>Jennifer read her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>And</span>
</em>
<span> those hags were exchanging notes about her terrifying motherhood experience with a child therapist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It went </span>
<em>
<span>great</span>
</em>
<span>, thanks.” She took a huge bite out of her sandwich, and Jen curled her nose in mocking disgust. “We braided each other’s hair and talked about feelings,” she added, still chewing. She couldn’t believe she’d gone as far as to mention the ordeal to Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You eat like you haven’t seen any food in six months.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dramatically took a hand to her chest. “Are you food-shaming me, Jen? You know I had to fight for food under Evil-anora’s reign of terror, think of poor baby Agatha starving–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen rolled her eyes. “Untrue. And your jokes about your horrifying childhood have stopped working years ago, can’t make me squirm that easily.” She sighed, slumping slightly against the bench. “Open up, Agatha. Tell me about Nicky and Ralph, it’ll make you feel better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sharing everything makes </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> feel better. We’re not the same. If you want to help, take the foot reconstruction I’ve got in an hour.” She smiled, mouth full.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you’re disgusting. And it sounds long as hell, so no thanks. I have a life.” She threw her head back and sighed tiredly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What, are you seeing your girlfriend again tonight?” Agatha asked in a sweet, mocking voice, but Jen beamed at Wu’s mention– “Wait, are you officially together?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” she exclaimed a bit too fast. “We–I… We’re just dating. And yeah, I’m seeing her, so what? You should get a life too, maybe you’d stop being such a bitch. How long since you had some healthy adult fun?”</span>
</p><p><span>Agatha hummed, Rio immediately coming to her mind. </span><em><span>So</span></em> <em><span>Jen didn’t know. </span></em><span>Was she so drunk that night she and Alice had caught her in Rio’s room, she didn’t remember? Or was she trying to gather info?</span></p><p>
<span>“Having a life doesn't require a relationship, <em>and</em> I get all the adult fun I need. I’m a bitch to you ‘cause you just make it </span>
<em>
<span>too good</span>
</em>
<span>.” She smiled wide, and Jen huffed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t mean fucking random women in bars, Agatha-"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Hmm, </span>
<span>I’ve kind of stopped doing all that," she interrupted, "It's boring as hell. Last time I fucked a random woman, I almost fell asleep with her sitting on my face, and it wasn’t just the 18 hours long shift.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen's mouth had dropped, an incredulous smile on her. </span>
<span>“What–</span>
<em>
<span>god,</span>
</em>
<span> poor her. Did she realize?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think so.” Agatha shrugged. "Poor <em>me</em>, I kept dozing off."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen let out a sarcastic snort. "Yeah, well, maybe try sleeping with someone you can talk to after sex. Someone you don’t just give a fake number after screwing them in a public toilet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my </span>
<em>
<span>god</span>
</em>
<span> Jen, that again? I said sorry like–thirty times!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You never said sorry, you dumb bitch.” Jen softened after the insult, looking at Agatha sideways. She chuckled. “I remember quite clearly that you said you were “sorry we had to see each other again”. You said if you’d known we’d be in the same residency program, you would have skipped on this, and you fucking gestured at me like I was a piece of ham.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “See? I said sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>God,</span>
</em>
<span> you’re stupid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. “Don’t worry, I’m lucky enough now that I don’t meet my random bar women at work. You’ll always be special.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was not… ugh.” Jen slapped a hand against her own thigh, then got up and faced her. “Whatever. I was just here to tell you that I officially haven’t seen you out for a month, and we’re going to have drinks this Saturday."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t, I have–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I looked at your shifts. You’re free.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t it be something else?” She mockingly pouted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have anything other than this and Nicky, and you can pay Josh to obsess over him as he sleeps. Be there, asshole.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, eyebrows pointedly raised at Agatha, she spun on her heels and strode away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s phone chimed. When she looked at the screen, her heart did a tiny backflip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Vidal</span>
<b>💀</b>
<span>: </span>
<em>
<span>Hey, coffee break?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Another chime, Agatha set it to silent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Vidal</span>
<b>💀</b>
<span>: </span>
<em>
<span>Your treat ;P</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Being alone, she didn’t even bother to wipe away the traitorous smile from her face. </span>
<em>
<span>Pathetic</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How had it come to this?</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Good morning, pillow princess!” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The first day back to work after her two-day break, as she was asking for her coffee, Agatha had heard her voice behind her. She’d looked for ways to escape, but the cafeteria was almost empty, no crowd to fade into.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“‘Morning.” She’d grunted back like she hadn’t just spent a day and night obsessively remembering a definitely-too-clothesless Rio Vidal. And–princess? More like queen.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio had come to a stop at her side. She was wearing her faded blue sweatshirt. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She’d pointed it out, groggy from sleep: “You’re still wearing that.” Great observer, Agatha. Ten out of ten.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio had smiled, and if Agatha hadn’t known better, she would have said she looked sweet.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“It smells like you. Makes me horn–” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She’d interrupted Rio by grabbing her arm and dragging her to a far-away corner, fresh coffee in the other hand.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The stupid resident’s joke had jolted her awake, warmth spreading from her heart as it pumped a little stronger. From outrage, of–fucking–course. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Don’t say that in public, you idiot! You’ll get us reported!” She’d scream-whispered after spinning Rio around to face her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio had smirked, reminding her why she was meant to avoid her in the first place. The resident was unhinged.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“</span>
</em>
<span>Agatha</span>
<em>
<span>, no one gives a shit. And if you want me to stop, being rough to me doesn’t help. You’re just making me excited.” Her eyes had widened playfully, then shifted down to Agatha’s clutch on her arm, and Agatha had released it with a growl. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio’s pout had just pissed her off more.</span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Somehow, because she was totally a masochist, she'd ended up having coffee with Rio. She'd managed to keep herself as physically away from the resident as possible, and it had been a strain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sleeping with her hadn’t fixed anything; it had made it worse. She remembered details of her body vividly, the way Rio’s eyes had locked on hers as she kneeled between her legs, and her brain kept asking for more. Like a fucking addict, it kept going back there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, having their rapidly stacking breaks together in public was a risk, because Rio was reckless, and every time Agatha chastised her she just looked happier, which in turn made Agatha horn–no, mad. It made her mad. But taking Rio to a private space was out of the question, ‘cause who knew what could happen? Agatha wasn’t that confident about her self-control. </span>
</p><p>
<span>If it hadn’t been for Carol hanging over their heads, likely making Agatha’s life hell and killing her chances to make plastics’ chief if she found out, Agatha would have pushed her stupid feelings aside and fucked Rio over and over until she was all filled up, like a kid with a birthday cake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So apparently now she thought of Rio as a birthday cake. Great.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She groaned to herself, willing away that dangerous mental image of eating cake off Rio’s abdomen. What was wrong with her, with the horny teenager thoughts? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes hovered over Rio’s texts.<br/>
</span>
<span>She didn’t text back.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>******</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t help. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she thoroughly washed her hands to scrub into her next surgery, she thought of Rio probably having her break with someone else. She’d be laughing at someone else’s jokes, her eyes twinkling in the warm afternoon light, at the cafeteria table Agatha had dangerously started thinking of as–</span>
<em>
<span>their </span>
</em>
<span>table. <br/>
</span>
<span>The one with the most sunlight. The one where Rio always tried to get her to sit to the side hit by said sunlight, for some reason Agatha couldn’t fathom nor cared to know. Like, </span>
<em>
<span>at all. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She finished washing her forearms, let the sponge fall into the sink and waited a couple seconds for the water to run down her elbows, trying to concentrate on the familiarity of it. <br/>
</span>
<span>She needed to stop thinking about Rio. She needed her damned brain back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she should have known, the world had a sick sense of humor. As soon as she got into the OR, arms raised and letting the scrub nurse dress her in sterile scrubs, Rio strolled in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey everyone,” she said, but she was only looking at Agatha. “Let me help–” Rio closed in on her back, Agatha’s movements trapped in the need not to break sterility as the scrub nurse put gloves on her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers brushed her waist in search of the surgical gown’s drawstrings, decidedly lingering a bit too long over her hips. It gave her goosebumps, and she took a small breath in to avoid showing a reaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing here?” Luckily, her voice didn’t betray her. “We’ve got Billy and Chris today.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy’s head raised from under a sterile cloth he was fixing, “Hey Rio!” <br/>
</span>
<span>Christopher, the other resident, was still scrubbing in with his ortho-bro attending.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey.” Her breath was so close it tickled the back of Agatha’s ear. “I’m next door, we’ve got a stab wound.” Billy wooed, the easily impressed teenager, and Agatha rolled her eyes. “A guy stabbed his brother in the back during a fight. Bet it was about inheritance–” She chuckled to herself and finally finished tying the two knots behind Agatha’s back, setting her free.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha went to stand at her operating table, but Rio wasn’t done:</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since you ignored my texts,” she started in a coy tone, “I came here to thank you for reinstating me as a real resident. Your punishment is over, huh? I must have done </span>
<em>
<span>something </span>
</em>
<span>right.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep, calming breath. It didn’t calm her. Did she </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> to phrase things in such an ambiguous, suspicious way? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Teen</span>
</em>
<span>,” she snapped her fingers at Billy and he spun his blue-cuffed head to her. “What did I tell you when I sent you to deliver my message about Vidal’s punishment?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, uhm… you said “I’ll give that crazy bitch a lesson.” He had the nerve to sound fake-angry, in a very poor imitation of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. Maybe he wasn’t scared enough of her anymore. Something to fix later. “Not </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>, obviously. What did I tell you about how long the punishment should last?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh! Five weeks, you said five weeks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks!” She said mockingly, then gestured at Rio to her back. “I’ve made my point. Get out of my OR.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She heard Rio mutter an “</span>
<em>
<span>Ouch”, </span>
</em>
<span>chuckle, and step away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait,” she called after her, turning around, and Rio looked back in surprise. “Enjoy your surgery, you </span>
<em>
<span>idiot</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s huge grin was worth the questioning glances that got sent her way. She looked strikingly beautiful. Hell, one thing Agatha could never deny: she really </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> passionate about her job.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She got a couple days at the clinic, a much-needed break from the torture that was Rio Vidal. </span>
<span>Her Sunday with Nicky ended with him throwing a tantrum over misplacing–possibly losing at the park, but Agatha wouldn’t say it out loud–his favorite plushie, and she only managed to put him to sleep late. He tried to read his own book to Agatha, and only once he got tired, starting to doze off against her arm, Agatha took over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She texted Jen the reason she’d be an hour late–the witch better not be salty about it–and proceeded to wear one of her favourite dresses. It was a long, black one with a deep v-neck and a slit, cause–why not? Mama needed to turn some heads.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once she finally got to the bar Jen had chosen, a queer place full of polaroid pictures covering one wall, Agatha could admit she’d like a drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When her eyes found Jen’s table, she could admit she </span>
<em>
<span>needed</span>
</em>
<span> a drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen was there, of course. Sitting down next to Alice Wu, both smiling sickeningly bright as they chuckled at each other. To the other side of them were the fetus Billy and a fetus number two who, judging from the arm around Teen’s shoulders on the back of the bench, was likely his famous boyfriend.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As if that whole comrade weren’t enough to make her want to go find another table with actual, not brain-dead adults and use her charms to get them to adopt her for the night, well… Rio was sitting to the side of the booth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was seriously considering her options, eyes scanning the other tables, when Jen saw her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” She waved her arm, and Agatha looked directly at her and–<br/>
</span>
<span>She went the opposite way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ignoring Jen's calls after her, she sat at the bar. She felt a nagging sensation in the back of her head, but pointedly ignored that too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The barwoman, a blonde woman with light blue eyes, dared fucking send a studying look in her direction before pointing the other barman at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey love. Haven’t seen you in months, but I’ll forgive you ‘cause you look </span>
<em>
<span>fabulous</span>
</em>
<span> tonight!” He brushed a hand over hers on the counter. “What can I get you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at him. “I always look fabulous, Kurt.” Jen shall not find out she was on a name basis with the bartender here. The place had been a post-divorce phase, and hopefully none of the random women whose names she didn’t remember would be around. She did </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>need Jen breathing down her neck about finding fucking </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span>. Love was for people whose surname wasn't Harkness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Things had changed since she’d last been here anyway, with the new bartender and all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ordered her drink with a generous tip to Kurt on the oath to pretend he didn’t know her. When she finally got her tingling fingers on cold glass, she sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You come here often?”</span>
</p><p><span>Agatha jumped, choking on her drink.<br/>
</span><span>She was still coughing when Rio sat down next to her. She saw her hand reach to pat her back but then retreat. And t</span><span>ruth be told, Agatha had known this would happen. Rio deserved some credit for how long she’d resisted coming after her, so long that Agatha had started to doubt</span> <span>she would. </span></p><p>
<span>Had she wanted her to? Maybe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Had she wanted it </span>
<em>
<span>more</span>
</em>
<span> the longer she’d been waiting? Well yes, of course</span>
<em>
<span>. </span>
</em>
<span>Wanting what she couldn't have was one of her specialties.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she deadpanned. "Do you?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why did you bribe the waiter then?” Rio ignored her question, and Agatha’s eyes shifted towards her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s called a tip, you should try it sometimes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyebrows raised, unimpressed, lips curled up. “I </span>
<em>
<span>heard</span>
</em>
<span> you, A-ga-tha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, fuck her and her smoky voice. “What are you, the fucking Batman sliding behind me without a sound? Give a lady some privacy.” She sipped on her drink, looking away, and Rio raised a finger at the other bartender to get her attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tess, can you get me another?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha almost choked again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shooting an overly friendly “Of course, babe!”, the blonde villain poured Rio her drink. When she stayed and tried to start a conversation with Rio, asking how she was in a raspy voice, Agatha didn't care. The fact she didn’t leave was pure coincidence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pretended not to care so hard, concentrating on the inside of her glass, she almost didn’t notice the way Rio kept looking at her and back to the bartender. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m great </span>
<em>
<span>now</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio said, coy. Agatha wasn’t sure if she was referring to her or to the–</span>
<em>
<span>ugh–</span>
</em>
<span>that woman. Either way, no. Nope. Both would be unacceptable. <br/>
</span>
<span>No, Rio flirting with someone else in front of her?<br/>
</span>
<span>Absolutely, completely, utterly just–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry Tess, we have to catch up some other time. My…" Rio glanced sideways at her, "</span>
<em>
<span>friend</span>
</em>
<span> and I should go back to the others,” and she gestured with her dumb, perfect fingers towards their table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, bye Jess,” and with a flourish of the hand, Agatha made it a point to step off her stool, steady on her heels, and walk to the table first. Just so Rio would be the one to follow.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Billy startled </span>
<em>
<span>hard</span>
</em>
<span> when he saw them approaching. He blushed, stuttered a “Doctor Harkness” to which Agatha considered but then didn’t allow him to call her by name for one night, and got up in a show of respect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled next to Agatha. “Sit there,” she instructed Billy, pointing at the chair she’d been in before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy immediately complied, his boyfriend getting up after him to let Agatha and Rio sit in the booth, looking confused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, it made sense for Billy to let Rio bully him into giving up his seat. It also made sense she’d make a big show of wanting to sit next to her, in front of their colleagues.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to keep her murderous aura in check; she was feeling generous. After letting baby gay two introduce himself, she sat opposite Alice; Rio slid in next to her, and Billy’s boyfriend came third.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The space crowding, Rio’s thigh was flush with hers. Not that she’d notice something like that. Nope.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was two drinks in and unacceptably tipsy–which like, lightweight, ugh–when Billy and baby-gay-two said their goodbyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was halfway through her third drink when Rio punctuated a joke with a squeeze of Agatha’s knee, and she felt it way higher than she should have.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She managed to force herself to quietly remove the hand, and Rio didn’t even seem to notice, cracked in two by her own stupid joke–one that Agatha hadn’t registered, but was 100% sure had been dumb.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what, are you together now? Breaking the rules publicly?” She scrambled to find something to shift her focus to Alice and Jen. She knew they were together–once they’d signed the documents, the whole hospital had gotten the gossip in less than three hours. Even the contracted plumbers knew they were together-and had an opinion on who was exploiting whom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wu blushed, giggling in her beer. Jen, currently in her second stage of the Kale-alcohol-consumption scale (the loud stage), smacked her glass against the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah we’re dating!” She pointed an index at Agatha, clearly feeling funny. “There’s a thing called…” she turned to Alice. “Babe, what’s it called?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We signed one of those thingies that says it’s consensual,” Alice explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah Agatha, you should try that!” She gestured between Rio and her, and Agatha frowned deep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had the nerve to nod next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not gonna sign a relationship agreement over a one-time thing. Besides, imagine how many I would–I mean, </span>
<em>
<span>you and I </span>
</em>
<span>never signed one, and–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Jen’s whole face had opened like a clam, shock and excitement in one, and Agatha stopped talking too late. Fuckfuckfuck. The drinks made her do this. Maybe Jen hadn’t meant Rio and her specifically, she’d just been blabbering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“YOU GUYS SLEPT TOGETHER?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“SHUT UP, KALE!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who else did you…” Rio started, </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, agathaagatha!” Jen patted her hand over the table, “Why didn’t you tell me?! Alice,” she frowned at her girlfriend, “did you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“JEN!” Agatha slapped both hands over hers to get her attention back in a desperate attempt to fix it, “I didn’t mean </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>. I meant you and I, when we were residents.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen’s face fell, but then she narrowed her eyes at Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re lying, liar, we were </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> a one-time thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes we were.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You gaslighting bitch, even you can’t have forgotten how many times–I mean, not that I counted,” she looked to Alice, panic setting in, rapidly pulled her hands away from Agatha’s clutch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw the opportunity and took it. Better to have them fighting than Jen figuring out she’d slept with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, countless times.” She proudly smiled and nodded to herself, ready to watch the chaos unfurl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What Agatha hadn’t taken into account was–well, </span>
<em>
<span>Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio suddenly stood up, everyone’s attention snapping to her. She hit the table, her drink tipping off and magically pouring all over Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nooooo!” Jen scrambled up, trying to save her dress. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry.” Rio deadpanned, and Agatha silently stared. She’d done it on purpose, like, </span>
<em>
<span>for sure</span>
</em>
<span>. And for some sick reason, it did something for Agatha. It did a lot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat back down, not even offering an excuse for having stood up in the first place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she uselessly handed her girlfriend tissues, Alice looked over to her flatmate.</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Rioo</span>
</em>
<span>,” she whined, “behave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And shit, that bordered on illegality. No one should tell Rio to behave but Agatha. Right?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But they were flirting! Right in front of u–” Agatha kicked her under the table, maybe a little too hard. “Ouch! Why did you–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She got a glare in response, and the point seemed to kick in. <br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Kick in</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha chuckled to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They were flirting right in front of you,” Rio muttered, crossing her arms over of her chest. “Unfair. You know what? </span>
<em>
<span>We</span>
</em>
<span> should sleep together to get back at them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to sleep with you!” Alice laughed, Jen getting up and tugging on her hand,</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me neither! Gross! I was just saying… </span>
<em>
<span>revenge,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio sulked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guys, we’re going to the restroom to clean this up,” Jen spoke over her, giggling like a teenager.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Sure</span>
</em>
<span>, cause you need her help for that…” Agatha’s wish to make them uncomfortable wasn’t fulfilled. Jen and “</span>
<em>
<span>babe”</span>
</em>
<span> were already halfway to the restrooms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat back. She sipped on her drink, head light. She let her eyes wander around in front of her, to nothing in particular. Set on not talking to Rio. Not giving Rio a chance to pull her in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yet something felt wrong. That silence next to her, the stillness. If she turned to Rio first, would it make her a lose–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Were you guys together?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she did turn to Rio, her face was closer than she remembered. Yeah. Pulling her in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed. Rio’s face was also blanker than she remembered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She managed to huff out a laugh. “As if! I’d never date that… </span>
<em>
<span>that.</span>
</em>
<span> Besides, I was marr–”<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Oh, shit.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“You cheated on your husband?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I cheated on my wife.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were married </span>
<em>
<span>twice?!”</span>
</em>
<span> Rio’s mouth dropped only a little, but it was more shock than she’d ever shown before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, tilting her glass at her. “Just joking.” When Rio didn’t stop looking at her like a fucking owl, she theatrically sighed. “It’s not that interesting, okay? We were residents, both burnt out, no social life. What we </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> have were many late nights studying together…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked nauseated, nose curled up. “Okay, </span>
<em>
<span>ew, </span>
</em>
<span>stop</span>
<span>. And your husband?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about Mr. Bohner?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident paused, eyebrows pinched, then broke into a laugh. “That was his name? Oh my god, you were </span>
<em>
<span>Doctor Boner?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yes,</span>
</em>
<span> funny, ha ha.” Never mind that making Rio laugh was the exact reason why Agatha had just shared that. “As much as I hated my mother’s, I never took his family name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, Harkness is your mother’s maiden name? What about your dad?” And </span>
<em>
<span>wow</span>
</em>
<span>, taking a tipsy Rio off-topic was easy as fuck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Biological dad or mother’s husband-dad?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Both?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an index finger in Rio’s face, which was definitely too close to hers for a normal conversation. “Never met,” she raised a second finger, “dead.” And she smirked in Rio’s face, possibly leaning closer. Her eyes briefly darted to Rio’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face didn’t fall, she didn’t shrink back from the alleged tragedy of her fathers stories as Agatha expected–hence the smirk, cause she expected a win. <br/>
</span>
<span>No, Rio held her chin up, one hand making its way to Agatha’s thigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>shit</span>
</em>
<span>, only a crazy person would find that a good moment to make a move. <br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha fucking thrived in it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s tongue worked against the inside of her cheek, stupidly hypnotizing. </span>
<em>
<span>Pulling her in,</span>
</em>
<span> like a fucking black hole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I’d known it was a one-time thing…” Rio’s fingers trailed up her thigh and Agatha sucked the side of her lower lip between her teeth, eyes drifting down to Rio’s mouth again. So close… “That morning, when I woke up, I would have held you a little longer.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, no. No, no, fuck no…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers squeezed her thigh before letting her go, and she sat back. Blank expression, like she hadn’t been one inch from making out with Agatha’s face just a moment before–<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen and Alice messily slid back down in front of them. Right. Rio must have heard them coming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More or less like anything Rio did lately, the fact she was still putting effort into protecting Agatha’s prized privacy made her chest warm. Maybe it was that, or maybe it was what Rio had just said... no, definitely not what she’d said. Sappy little shit…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks felt hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or, like, I would have taken a picture of your drool puddle.” Rio deadpanned right before downing her drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right. Privacy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Jen and Babe didn’t seem to catch on.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Next thing she knew, Agatha found herself in Rio and Alice’s living room, sitting on a couch across from Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen and Alice sang along to a tipsy Rio playing pop songs on her ukulele, Agatha silently sipping on–well, water, for a change. No way she was letting a hangover win over her the next morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The music stopped, Rio scrolled on her phone, whatever app she was using for sheets. Babe shouted her requests, Jen outshouted Babe’s requests. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled to herself, not looking up from her phone as she set it between her bent knees–and hell, that couldn’t be comfortable, but she was managing to play as her legs held the phone up in front of her face, all curled up, feet on the sofa.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yes, Agatha had been staring; she wasn’t about to deny that. After all, Rio was playing, right? She was expected to stare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at her through long, slowly batting lids. A smile pulled at one corner of her lips, and then her teeth showed. The stupid slit between her incisors–</span>
</p><p>
<span>She started singing, eliciting a squeal of joy from Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I'm in bed texting girls</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But I'm thinking 'bout you, baby</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I'd hit you up, but I'm stuck</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Trying not to come off crazy”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen joined in, prompting Alice to stand up to dance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love this one!” Alice jumped around Jen or something–Agatha wasn’t paying attention to them anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“If it were up to me</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I'd be calling you mine already</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But I'm in bed texting girls</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Thinking 'bout you, baby, oh no</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Don't know what to say”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked </span>
<em>
<span>looked</span>
</em>
<span> at her. The same way she did when no one else was around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Probably shouldn't tell you this</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But fuck it, here's my confession</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I'm kinda hooked on you</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And in the mood for an obsession”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yeah, no shit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Must be the alcohol, but Agatha was cooked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Black hole vs speck of dust. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Buh-bye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Yeah, you might be someone I could love</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Or you're just somebody I fucked once</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Mm-mm, mm-mm</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Somebody I fucked once</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Mm-mm, mm-mm”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Definitely not someone she could love, nu-huh. Agatha was a selfish, unlovable asshole, and rolling with it. But–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was too fucking hot right then, her hair up in a clip, one too many buttons of her shirt undone, and those stupidly pretty lips. And now she was a lesbian stereotype with her ukulele, and she could sing, and she decided to sing </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>, to watch her with the huge eyes, and her fingers on the chords–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could barely hear the rest of the song. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed her other glass, the one with scotch, downed the remaining drink in one go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio’s stare, it coiled in Agatha’s belly. It was a strain not to rub her thighs together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Probably shouldn't tell you this</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But fuck it, here's my confession</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I'm kinda hooked on you</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And in the mood for an obsession,</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yeah, she was going to ask Jen for that video of Rio that Alice was taking. That would be a weird thing to ask for, but, hey. She fucking needed it. For scientific purposes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice trailed off, fingers still strumming, and Agatha couldn’t tear her eyes off those instruments of torture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A cough, laughs, Jen excusing Babe and her for going to bed so soon, Agatha didn’t even compute shit. In a whirlwind, they disappeared up the stairs, running and giggling and whispering between the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t give less of a fuck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a silence, in the end. <br/>
</span>
<span>Or was it a beginning?</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s legs uncrossed, she stood up. Hips swinging, her legs carried her to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident looked up at her in a trance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took the ukulele from her hands, set it down next to her. Rio’s feet slid to the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was a little pathetic,” she heard herself say in a raspy voice, but she was sitting down on Rio’s lap, both knees to one side, fingers trailing the nape of Rio’s neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio’s hands were immediately on her legs and back. Still. Thumbs swiping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” Her eyes grew dark. She licked her lips, chin tipped up. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Wow. She was into that. Called it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, coy. “Don’t tell me you also have a degradation kink, </span>
<em>
<span>Vidal</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I–maybe I just have an Agatha Harkness kink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha laughed, head thrown back. That was good. Her own, personal plaything…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> was pathetic,” she said once the laugh had died out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed, fingers digging into her, </span>
<em>
<span>waiting.<br/>
</span>
</em>
<span>But she wasn’t going to get anything that easily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you were texting girls?” She asked, voice cracking at the edges as her nails dug into Rio’s scalp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident frowned. “Wha…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The song. Did you fuck someone else?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.” She swallowed, “No. No, I didn’t, after–” She trailed off, eyes shifting between hers, “Did you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “You don’t get to ask.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now, handsome…” she whispered against her lips, and it was </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> easy to erase the frown from Rio’s face, “Let’s make a deal. You want this to happen again, right?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She trailed an index finger down Rio’s jawline, and the resident nodded once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’ll follow the rules, yes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What rule–” Agatha’s short, manicured nail dug into her pulse. “</span>
<em>
<span>Yes,” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio corrected herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good </span>
<em>
<span>boy</span>
</em>
<span>.” She shifted on her lap, and Rio pulled her closer with a whiny hum, eyes trained on her lips. “Rule number one,” She raised a finger next to her face, “You don’t tell anyone. Not even Wu. She would tell Jen, Jen would tell Lilia or Wanda, and in a week, the whole hospital would know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed. “Your reputation and all that, yes, I </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shush,” she took the counting index to her lips, and they twitched, parting slightly. Agatha had to will herself to wait a minute longer before taking everything she wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That brings us to rule number two,” a second finger raised, “you don’t tell anyone.” She saw Rio actively stopping herself from rolling her eyes. “Your mother can’t know about this. Our fossil chief of plastics is retiring in a few months, and I’m going to get his job if it’s the last thing I do, mmhkay?” She smiled big, mockingly nodding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rule number three… what’s your safe word?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The corners of Rio’s lips instantly pulled up. “Peaches,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She said it too fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, scratch that. What’s </span>
<em>
<span>our </span>
</em>
<span>safe word?” She was not about to use the same fucking word Rio had used before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Vidal’s eyes sparkled. “You’re letting me choose?” </span>
<span>God, what a dork.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Think fast before I change my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, uhm–” she stuttered, looked around, “Acetaminophen!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help the chuckle that bubbled up her chest. “Bit too long, darling. Try again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyebrows scrunched, eyes narrowing in thought, “Ringer?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As in, Ringer’s lactate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nerd.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident scoffed. “What, and you aren’t? I’ve seen your place. There’s more books than free surfaces.” She punctuated that with a squeeze of her hip, “Besides, I chose that because it’s the first thing we ever administered a patient together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sucked in her lips. “Wow. Even worse.” </span>
<em>
<span>Even better.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah. So, rule four, apparently–”Rule number four,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s more?!” Rio’s eyes widened. Agatha grabbed her by the collar of her shirt, and she tipped her chin up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Four, this is just sex. No strings attached.” </span>
<em>
<span>No feelings. </span>
</em>
<span>Rio was young, beautiful and on the verge of starting her career, God knew where. And there was Nicky. And by this point in her life, Agatha had accepted she wasn’t made for… whatever people with normal feelings had. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could have sworn Rio’s face fell for a fraction of a second, like she was deceived, and she looked down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.” Quiet. Like she didn’t mean it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Which didn’t make any sense, because Vidal certainly hadn’t expected anything different. She’d never been serious about this. She’d never been serious about anything in her life, probably. She was just a little brat, having fun at Agatha’s expense–or, soon, Agatha’s gain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Must be something else. She was likely getting bored with the rules, just needing to move on to the rest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands slithered around her neck, thumbs forcing her to look back up. “Okay,” she repeated to Rio, and she meant it. She’d save herself the drama.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, savoring the way Rio waited for her, hands tensing around her, Agatha closed the distance. And it burnt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kissed Rio slowly, keeping control, the resident immediately opening her mouth to let her tongue in, releasing a hum that made her throat vibrate under Agatha’s palms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss was wet and rapidly getting filthy, Agatha burying all her thoughts in it, all her doubts. When Rio sucked hard on her lower lip, hurting her, Agatha wasn't sure whether the sound she made was a protest or a moan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She broke the kiss–Rio hopelessly following after her with a whine that pooled between her thighs–and, with a smirk, she unbuttoned her pants. The way Vidal hung from her lips, desperate at the smallest offer, would never stop turning her on. Her body was already melting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was wearing–well, for once she was wearing underwear, but it wasn’t exactly what she’d expected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had to swallow back a throaty sound. “Are these–” she took a deep breath, “Is it either nothing or boyshorts?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down, then back up, and as Agatha drove a manicured finger along the inside of her boxer briefs, her lopsided smile turned into a shaky breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe. I–” Agatha’s fingers dug deeper, teasing at the edge of trimmed hair. “It depends,” she managed to get out, then bucked her hips below Agatha’s ass. “Why, like what you see?” she croaked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, </span>
<em>
<span>baby</span>
</em>
<span>,” the word slipped out–Agatha liked it. She liked it very fucking much. The boyshorts or the name-calling, or both. “You’ve no idea.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Baby</span>
</em>
<span>. Rule four. Don’t let it go to your head–</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was definitely going to her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Agatha withdrew her hand–please, no–and stood up–please, </span>
<em>
<span>please</span>
</em>
<span> no?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands suddenly empty, Rio knew she was just gaping at Agatha. Like a dumb fish. And she was okay with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was merciful. She drew her dress up a little, slid a leg through the lateral slit and–</span>
<em>
<span>god</span>
</em>
<span>, she needed to go back on “merciful” cause the view fucking wasn’t–and she set a heeled foot on the couch, between Rio’s knees. And Rio had never needed to bury her face in something as she did the milky skin of Agatha’s inner thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take it off.” Agatha’s voice was firm, a dark edge to it as her strikingly clear, cold blue eyes looked down at her, unmoving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thought she also could have kept her heels, and she also could have walked all over her, but didn’t hesitate–her hands were on Agatha’s leg. As they worked on undoing the strap on her heel, she kissed her knee. And up the inside of her thigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s balanced herself with a hand against her shoulder as she gently sucked and licked closer to her center, the heel forgotten, hands grasping Agatha’s calf–and Agatha’s thigh fucking quivered already. Rio’s boxer briefs were probably already wet, and she wasn’t being gentle anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved the dress aside, tongue lapping at the delicate hollow between Agatha’s thigh and her center, earning the most beautiful throaty sound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, she wanted to hear Agatha scream. She wanted to see her lose all sense of control, eyes turning back, the only word on her lips Rio’s name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she tried to slid her lace panties down, the smell of Agatha’s core intoxicating, her otherworldly beautiful torturer took in a sharp breath-but slapped her hands away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“<em>Heel</em>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed at the authority the single word held. “Yes, Ma’am.” And she took the shoe off, setting it on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was that?” Agatha’s voice curled with mirth, and when Rio locked eyes with her, she was smirking. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</em>
<span>She wished she were the death of Agatha as much as Agatha was hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ma’am?” she rasped, </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yes</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha rewarded her with a nail scraping the line of her jaw, “So you </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> know how to show some respect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. Because, like, what else could she do? Anything Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set her now naked foot on the ground, Rio’s hands empty once again and striving for something to grasp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, Agatha’s other heel got pressed against her crotch, causing a whimper to leave Rio’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck, fuck, fuck. </span>
</em>
<span>Her cunt twitched, hips canting up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t smirking anymore, her eyes a darker shade of blue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Off.” And she complied right away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t let Agatha take her leg away from her needy fingers, this time. She held her calf tight, kissing and biting down into the unbearably soft and pale skin of her inner thigh, and Agatha’s breathing hitched, her nails digging into Rio’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Agatha rasped when she moved her panties aside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was wet. As. Hell. Rio felt it all pool down her abdomen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t wait, this time–and immediately dipped two fingers between Agatha’s folds, moaning breathily at the feeling, at the way Agatha almost folded over her, but fought to stay upright. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed to taste her again, to smell her again, to get her tongue on her swollen clit before she actually came in her pants just from touching two fingers to her…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, </span>
<em>
<span>Rio,”  </span>
</em>
<span>Yes, that was exactly how she needed her to say it, but then, “Stop.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at her, heart hammering in her chest, eyes wide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“On the ground.” She pointed at her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, Agatha had something in mind. And Rio was nothing if not trustful, so she carefully removed Agatha’s leg from between hers (tragic), knelt to her, and lay flat on her back. And with the way Agatha stared at her, pupils fucking blown, she didn’t even feel a tiny bit ashamed about it. It was a total blast. Chef’s kiss, she'd totally recommend.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a second to speak. She had to clear her throat, then, “Just wanted to see how far you’d go.” And she laughed, insensitive. </span>
<em>
<span>Cruel</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s pussy fucking clenched around the sound. Now </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha would call pathetic. But Rio didn’t feel pathetic, she felt </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> great. And anyways, she needed to tire Agatha out before she could get the best out of the perfect, <em>sweet</em> plastics' goddess–before Agatha's control would slip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What was it she told herself?<br/>
</span>
<span>Let Agatha play, make Agatha pay. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stayed down, defiantly looking up with her arms spread around like a starfish, until Agatha curled a finger towards herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, pet. We wouldn’t want to be here if Alice or Jen came down for something, would we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“...No.” She looked towards the stairs, head rolling against the ground, and she couldn’t believe she was going to say it, but–“Alice’s room is too close to mine.” She wanted somewhere Agatha could be loud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm. Any place else?” Agatha towered over her. If she moved her legs wider, maybe Rio could see…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, uhm–the garage. Car,” she managed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seemed to realize–she’d probably followed her stare, “What, haven’t seen enough?” She smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never enough.” </span>
<em>
<span>Damn, </span>
</em>
<span>maybe she needed to tune it down. But it was so, so hard…</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha made it harder. She moved her dress and panties aside, her left hand dipped between her own folds, and she mewled, or Rio mewled, whatever, someone did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Under Rio’s hungry eyes, Agatha’s middle and ring fingers came out drenched. She took them to her own lips and fucking-yes-</span>
<em>
<span>god</span>
</em>
<span>–she sucked on them, cheeks hollowing and humming like the fucking tease she was. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio needed to get back at her soon…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sit on my face.” So she said that. And it didn’t sound like payback at all. Big deal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nu-huh, you’re not the one giving orders…” but Agatha was struggling to refuse, she clearly was. Rio could see it in the twitch of her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she smirked. <br/>
</span>
<span>And then she opened her mouth wide, spread her tongue out, chin tipped up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked, and Rio felt </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> confident she’d called her bluff. She looked for two long seconds before her knees were on either side of Rio’s head, and she killed Rio’s throaty moan into her pussy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pffuck wyeah,” Rio let out against her, finally tasting the mind-numbing sweetness, her own hips bucking up at the taste she’d missed for twelve long, </span>
<em>
<span>long</span>
</em>
<span> days. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d counted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More eating, less talking,” came the throaty reply from Agatha, but she sat slightly up. She reached a hand below Rio’s head and–</span>
<em>
<span>oh.</span>
</em>
<span> She took her hair clip off. Thoughtful. </span>
<em>
<span>Sweet</span>
</em>
<span>. Rio only realized it had been hurting her once the pain was gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat back down, and when Rio’s tongue lapped generously at her with a hum that mirrored the way her own core was clenching, fingers digging into Agatha’s thighs, Agatha moaned through closed lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand went to cover her own mouth. And Rio wanted to hear her. She really did. But Agatha seemed to have an issue with handing out control, so she’d be patient.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span> apparently wasn’t patient, this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled her hips over her mouth and nose, faster and faster, a hand leaning back on Rio’s hipbone for grip. Rio had lost count of the moans she’d hummed into Agatha–each time Agatha whimpered, each time she sped up, each time her nails grasped at Rio’s clothes, Rio’s thighs rubbing together for friction, her clit throbbing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck, she was soaked too. She could feel it. With Agatha’s soft curls on her face, wetness spreading down her chin, tongue rolling around Agatha’s clit as much as her frenzied movements allowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Agatha slowed down, Rio dipped her tongue inside her, dragged it up her clit and sucked on it, and Agatha put her full weight on Rio’s hip, arching up, knees closing around her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Other than the sound of Agatha’s thighs brushing against her ears, everything went silent. Rio opened her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Blessed, she was blessed. Agatha looked desperate, eyebrows pinched up in the middle, her lipstick smudged on the hand she was biting. Her hair still looked almost perfect–that had to be fixed soon. Rio’s stomach twisted violently at the view.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She left one of Agatha’s thighs, messily managed to get her hand around it and to her core, and as she sucked carefully on her clit, she dipped a finger in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ground down harder. A second finger, it was hard to angle properly, but Agatha, seemingly on the verge of coming, didn’t complain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her walls flutter around her fingers, and Agatha moved so suddenly and messily that she slipped out. She tried to go back, desperate, the look on Agatha’s face coiling around her center, but it was too late. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s thighs contracted harder around her and Rio gave up oxygen for a short while, Agatha’s hand finally falling out of her mouth so she could see–more than hear–her moans. She could </span>
<em>
<span>see</span>
</em>
<span> her name on Agatha’s lips, </span>
<em>
<span>Rio, Rio, Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck, fuck. The view was too much, Rio might actually come-</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s movements picked up for a few seconds as she took some space, and Rio let the stimulation be less intense, breathing in again. She let Agatha ride down the end of the orgasm, forgetfully still clutching her ass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha’s hand left her hip, Rio felt the bruise that would flourish there, and a sick pride at it. </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha had lost a little bit of control.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And when Agatha’s eyes re-focused on her before she stood up, fixed her dress, threw her hair over her shoulder like she hadn’t just come all over her face, Rio stood after her. Behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wouldn’t get away with it, not this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed a fistful of her hair, nipped at her earshell, and Agatha shivered into her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She drew two fingers over her own lips, gathering Agatha’s slick. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Want another taste?” She purred into her ear. Agatha turned sideways, mouth open and ready to talk, but when Rio’s fingers hovered over it, she just opened it wider and stayed quiet. </span>
<em>
<span>She, too, could be a good, obedient girl, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio thought. She just needed to learn how to pull it out of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sliding her fingers inside Agatha’s mouth, velvety tongue rolling below them together with suction, Rio had to stifle a groan. Her heartbeat hammered in her chest, breath hitching against Agatha’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck, those lips would look good around her strap-on.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wouldn’t let her prove it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not putting a dick you used on someone else, in–</span>
<em>
<span>fuck–</span>
</em>
<span>inside </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>–” She rolled her hips against Rio’s fingers, dipped in her wetness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The back of Rio’s car was too small a space for Rio to be able to handle Agatha as she wished, but she was making it work. Considering how naked, sweaty and flushed Agatha looked straddling her, she was making it work just fine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled the lever to recline the front seat partially forward, pushed Agatha against it. Agatha’s dress was pooled at her navel, and Rio’s teeth dug into her tit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>God, aah,</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha’s hand fisting her hair pulled on the roots, but Rio didn’t relent. She sucked a mark out of the side of her breast, and Agatha hissed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio’s head tipped back and she looked at her, fingers circling Agatha’s clit, the plastic surgeon moaned through gritted teeth. “Would you fucking get inside me?” She used the hold on the back of the seat to grind harder against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take off your dress,” Rio huffed, and Agatha luckily didn’t see it as “ordering her around”, this time. And she complied. </span>
<em>
<span>Good sign.</span>
</em>
<span> She was getting sloppier. She was forgetting herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s thighs rubbed together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yeah, she loved to see Agatha’s abdomen quiver under her hands. She looked down, over her abs, her navel, the faint stretch marks over her hips, almost invisible in the garage lights. Her free hand brushed over the pale skin–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha panted hard. “Rio, </span>
<em>
<span>I swear to God</span>
</em>
<span>–” her voice broke, </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yes</span>
</em>
<span> sweetheart.” She loved to hear the need in Agatha’s pleas. And </span>
<em>
<span>sure</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha might call them threats, but Rio saw them for what they were. In Agatha’s language (at least in Rio’s humble opinion) she was totally begging.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she slipped two fingers inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched back, sitting deep on her hand with a close-mouthed mewl before resuming her pace, slower now, Rio’s fingers meeting her and curling against that soft spot inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll buy me–” Agatha’s head threw back in a throaty moan, then she dug her nails into the nape of Rio’s neck and looked at her. “You’ll buy a strap just for me, and a harness too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could still pronounce such a long sentence? Not good. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers dug into her ass, forcing her to slow down but making the thrusts deeper. Agatha moaned throatily as she fell closer to her, a hand slipping below the underband of her bra and closing around her breast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, </span>
<em>
<span>princess,” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio answered her as she leaned in to kiss her, the stimulation from Agatha’s fingers rolling her nipple seeping down to her core.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed into the kiss, trying to move faster over her. When Rio didn’t let her, she growled and sucked hard on her lower lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Princess?</span>
</em>
<span> I’m not the–mmhf, fuck–the one who’s heir to a healthcare empire–</span>
<em>
<span>more, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio, fuck, go faster–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re the one who’s high-maintenance.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took it well. She inched back, smirked, released a pornographic moan as her head tipped back. “</span>
<em>
<span>Baby</span>
</em>
<span>, you feel </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>good inside me.” Rio’s pace unintentionally picked up. What the fuck was happening, Agatha praising her like that–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yes, </span>
</em>
<span>just like that, f-fuck, </span>
<em>
<span>don’t stop–</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha had just manipulated her into fucking her faster. What a huge bitch, she’d see what happened now–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand dipped between them, fingers digging into Rio through her boxers, and Rio’s </span>
<em>
<span>brain</span>
</em>
<span> skipped a beat. Was that a thing? No clue what she’d been thinking about just then–she spread her legs, Agatha’s fingers drew circles on her, and she barely even realized she was moaning into Agatha’s mouth–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can feel your slick through your boxers,” Agatha rasped, Rio’s thumb hitting her clit and causing a stifled moan, “bet you can't even last until I get inside–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes shut, and she caught Agatha’s mouth to make her stop, because if she kept going, if she got meaner–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ground down harder, faster, and she couldn’t stop her, not when the simple circles on her covered clit and the way she sometimes pressed at her entrance threatened to break her. And the sounds Agatha was making against her lips and around her fingers–fuck, Rio wouldn’t last–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Honey</span>
</em>
<span>, hmmf, I know you’re coming.” Agatha bit at her neck, pulling her head back by her hair, “Don’t even try to hide it. We both know you’re </span>
<em>
<span>pathetic</span>
</em>
<span>, dripping at the faintest touch–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> coming. She nodded frantically, Agatha looked almost–surprised? And she pulled her wrist closer, and Agatha started shaking, breath stuttering–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha,</span>
</em>
<span>” she mewled against her lips, “</span>
<em>
<span>harder–”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, you’re actually coming?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Y-yes, </span>
</em>
<span>I’m–mmhf”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh <em>god</em>, Rio</span>
<em>
<span>, </span>
</em>
<span>you’re such a loser–” but her hips stuttered madly against her, each thrust pushing Agatha’s fingers harder against Rio’s cunt, dragging her orgasm as Agatha’s hit too–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her walls rhythmically contracting around Rio’s fingers, Agatha followed her over the edge, deep moans breaking through Rio’s bliss and amplifying it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha was a little later than her, and as she came, her fingers overstimulating Rio’s twitching core, she had the brilliant idea of fucking </span>
<em>
<span>dipping into her boxers</span>
</em>
<span> and sliding over her, slow and trembling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio would have sworn it impossible, but she had a second, short-lived orgasm as Agatha came down from hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, when Rio’s fingers inside Agatha slowed down, Agatha stopped too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Forehead resting against Rio’s as she caught her breath, when Rio’s fingers slowly got out of her, she whined the prettiest, smallest sound Rio had ever had the blessing of hearing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised her fingers to their faces, slick bridging between them when she spread them. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, she needed that on her tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as she moved to get just that, eyes fixed on the sweet, faintly metallic-smelling slick, Agatha preceded her. <br/>
</span>
<span>Tongue drawing the length between Rio’s fingers, she moaned throatily and pulled both fingers into her mouth before sucking hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Again, fuck her for not wanting the strap Rio already owned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha released her, Rio kissed her cheek. She got the impression Agatha blushed over her post-orgasm flush, but then she tugged Rio’s hand down and pulled her into a deep kiss, and Rio lost all sense of reality.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha stirred, still mostly asleep. Something was weighing on her legs, making it harder to shift to her back. Once she finally managed, arm flying up to her left to rest her face against, something—no, <em>someone–</em>stopped it mid-air. </p><p>She opened her eyes, coming to her senses. <em>Rio.</em></p><p>“Morning, sunshine.” She was staring at her with a coy smile, propped up on one elbow, one leg laying above Agatha’s. Always in her space. Wearing Agatha’s oversized tee.<em> Hers.</em><br/>
…The tee, not Rio.</p><p>“Morning, creep.“ And she rolled her eyes. Not at Rio; at the idiotic pull to nuzzle into her neck and breathe into the source of that soft, warm smell…<br/>
But Rio didn’t need to know that.</p><p>The resident had stayed over a few times in the past couple of weeks, but Agatha had been sleeping alone for so long that her brain was struggling to catch up. Even before Ralph had finally moved out, they hadn’t slept in the same room—or at the same time for that matter, since Ralph had forgone sleeping schedules—for ages.</p><p>“Trying to slap me this early in the morning?“ Rio mused as she released her wrist.</p><p>“It’s always a good time for physical violence with you.” She flashed a wide smile–probably not her brightest, considering how groggy she felt.</p><p>“<em>Hmm</em>, we should explore that further.”</p><p>Ignoring her—she didn’t have the brain power to hate her body for heating up at Rio’s comments that early in the morning–Agata stretched and slumped out of bed. Unspoken rule number 5: no fraternizing the mornings after. Too soft, too sappy, too–ew. She did <em>not</em> want it. And she wouldn’t be late to work for it, especially today.</p><p>Rio whined behind her, shuffled—a slap sounded in the room, pain spreading on her buttcheek. Agatha let out an overly dramatic gasp as she looked back. Rio had slapped her butt.</p><p>“I’d complain you’re leaving if the view weren’t this great.” She worked her tongue against her cheek. <br/>
<em>Bitch</em>, she must have figured out that drove Agatha crazy.</p><p>A playful mood taking her over at the resident’s antics, Agatha jumped on the bed, turned Rio on her back—the resident started giggling, and they started a fight for supremacy, Rio wriggling and scratching at her to get free, Agatha straddling her and trapping her wrists—</p><p><em>Beep, beep, beep, beep—</em></p><p>Damn, just when it was getting good.<br/>
She had to climb off Rio to silence the brain-screeching alarm. <em>How she hated that sound.</em></p><p>“Too bad, that was starting to get fun,” she added for good measure with a smirk, side-eyeing Rio whose arms were still pinned where she’d left them.</p><p>When Rio just lay dead on her bed, breathlessly smiling up at her, Agatha pulled on her deadweight arm. “Come on, gotta leave before I wake Nicky.” </p><p>Unspoken rule number six.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>So yes, when Rio had said she knew a way to blow off some steam, she hadn’t been overplaying it. And though Agatha hadn’t planned on cashing in on their deal quite that often, they’d ended up sleeping together—well, actual sleeping didn’t happen frequently—a few too many times over the past two weeks. </p><p>And Rio had behaved, she’d followed the rules. Her flirting in the hospital had gotten a little tamer; of course, her flirting when they were alone far outweighed the loss. Even so, Agatha had found herself craving for it, since Rio had tuned it down in public. For some undeniably stupid reason (she’d been the one to tell Rio to behave, and it made <em>sense</em>), whenever the resident treated her like the average human being, it put her in a bad mood.</p><p>Anyways, as much as Rio followed the rules, Agatha couldn’t let her see Nicky every time she stayed over, lest he get too used to her and feel the loss once she left. Because she <em>would</em> leave. And the resident had never complained.</p><p>So that day, like every time before, Rio threw the borrowed pjs tee at her, Agatha said: “you know where the door is,” and didn’t kiss her goodbye. They didn’t do that shit–no kissing in the mornings, no kissing after sex. Oh, definitely no kissing at work, after sex. That was a big no. And if some kissing happened in the workplace during quickies, well, it was just the spur of the moment.</p><p>As every other day, after telling Rio to find the exit herself, Agatha followed her to the door. She needed to lock it; that was the only reason.</p><p>Right before walking out, Rio paused. “Good luck with the interview today,” she whispered with a grin, and raised a hand for… a high-five?</p><p>Agatha very slowly and skeptically clapped her hand against the weirdo’s. “No need for luck,” she deadpanned, and Rio stepped out with a small shrug.</p><p>“Oh!” She whisper-shouted then, backpack slung over one shoulder, “Wait, I forgot to get yesterday's tee, I couldn’t find it and then I got distracted–”</p><p>The distraction being a topless Agatha, she supposed. </p><p>Yeah, by the second sleepover, Rio had started taking a backpack with a change. Agatha had first thought there would be <em>something else</em> inside it, but <em>no</em>, stupid Vidal had never brought up straps again. </p><p>“Leave it, I’ll take care of it. You’ll get it next time.” <em>Next time</em>. That sounded dangerously nice.</p><p>Rio cocked her head, smile pulling her lips to one side, “You just want to wear it when I’m gone.”</p><p>And Agatha shut the door in her face.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>***</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Whistling some song that was stuck in her head as she strolled into the cafe–Agatha’s favorite—Rio checked her phone. Alice had left her a few texts, and none were about her staying out. After the first time it had happened and after Rio had given some random excuse, she’d stopped asking entirely. Which–Alice wasn’t nosy, but… suspicious. Especially considering the woman behind her now, the one she kept seeing around their place–Doctor Kale.  Other than being her number one sworn enemy, that one was a total gossip.</p><p>Rio shrugged to herself. Not an issue until it became an issue.</p><p>She ordered two drinks–one iced latte, one black coffee–and relaxedly took the walk back to Agatha’s building. Agatha wasn’t driving Nicky to school because of an early morning surgery, and then she had the tv stuff, and—<br/>
Well, point was that they were going to the same place, so… as she’d passed the cafe, the idea had sprouted in Rio’s mind to surprise her with great coffee, and <em>then</em> Agatha would totally drive her to work. Which meant more alone time with her.<em> Sweet</em>.</p><p>Feeling a little sneaky, a little like an undercover cop, she checked for Josh’s car absence before approaching Agatha’s and sitting against the hood. Sipping on her iced latte as she scrolled over her phone, she didn’t notice her approaching, until–</p><p>“Rio!” </p><p>Only it wasn’t Agatha. It was Nicky.</p><p>Rio startled, almost tumbling Agatha’s coffee on the hood of the car. As she miraculously kept it upright with both hands full, the kid managed to pull free of Agatha’s hand and run to her.</p><p>“Rio! I’m going to school!” He hugged her legs, grinning up at her. He wore a tiny backpack, shaped like a bug.</p><p>“Oh, that’s, uh–fun!” Rio slowly looked up at Agatha, feeling a little uncomfortable, a little <em>guilty</em>. That was rare. “I’m sorry, I thought Josh was taking him…” she said at a low volume, as if that would keep Nicky from hearing. </p><p>“Is that for me?” Agatha, looking incredible and not-at-all scary in her blue suit, lunged for the coffee like a starved stray. “I mean, the damage is done,” she added at Rio’s surprised look, and shrugged into her cup. </p><p>Rio perked up. Last thing she wanted was to make her feel like she wasn’t respecting an important boundary, threatening Nicky’s wellbeing. No, not just that—she herself didn’t want to hurt the kid.</p><p>“What damage?” Nicky only left Rio’s legs once she’d ruffled his hair, and he looked up at Agatha with tufts sticking in random directions. Super cute.</p><p>Agatha threaded her fingers through his hair to fix it, a fond smile on her face. “Nothing, Munchkin. Put your backpack in the car.” She set her coffee on top of the car and helped him into his seat. “My surgery got re-scheduled, the dummy had a 4am snack.” She explained as she fixed Nicky’s seatbelt. </p><p>“Mama, what damage?” Nicky insisted as Agatha strapped him in.</p><p>“No damage, don’t worry about it.” </p><p>But Nicky was clearly her spawn, and he wouldn’t give up: “Rio, what damage?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You’re the damage.”</p><p>“No, I’m good! Mama, tell Rio I’m good!” He looked up at Agatha from his seat, his little face scrunched in worry, taking it way too seriously. </p><p>“He’s really good.” Agatha said solemnly, nodding at Rio. “What do you think Nicky, should we give Rio a ride to work?”</p><p>The kid beamed, and when his eyes crinkled, even though they were brown, they looked a little bit like Agatha’s. Which was adorable—Rio’s chest melted so hard it almost hurt. “Yes, yes! I need to tell Rio about the other day!” He wiggled his feet.</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha for reassurance. “Are you sure?” </p><p>If there was one thing she was cautious about, it was kids, and Agatha was right. He shouldn’t get the wrong impression, if–well, rule four. Rio wouldn't become one of his childhood traumas. Stupid rule four–not that she’d considered what would happen with Nicky if that rule didn’t exist. No reason to consider something impossible. <em>Rule four.</em> She needed to keep it in mind.</p><p>Even so, after Agatha hummed in confirmation and she climbed into the passenger’s seat, she felt good. Like she was in the right place. Which was, <em>maybe</em>, kinda bad news, but the knowledge didn’t do anything to ruin her mood when Nicky was so excited about filling her in.</p><p>As Agatha drove, Nicky showed her his new plush animal. It was a triceratops, and Rio pretended to be surprised, but—back to that first night Agatha had set the rules…</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p><em>“I gotta get some sleep—Nicky was in a terrible mood, he’ll be whiny in the morning. I think we lost his plush penguin.”</em></p><p><em>Rio had pursed her lips in thought. “Wait here,” she’d said, and had left Agatha leaning against the car, regretfully—though super hot—in her dress once again.</em></p><p><em>She’d tiptoed through the house, silently sprinted up the stairs, and once in her room, she’d grabbed her only plushie from the shelf above her bed.</em></p><p><em>She’d seen Agatha’s heels abandoned on the floor on her way back, and had taken those too.</em></p><p><em>“Give him this.” She’d offered her the triceratops.</em></p><p><em>Agatha had stared at her like she was out of her mind.</em></p><p><em>“Why?” She’d hesitated before taking the plushie, studying it. Rio knew how soft it was, and she’d smiled when Agatha’s fingers had started reflexively petting its belly.</em></p><p><em>“This way you’ll have one in the morning.”</em></p><p><em>Agatha hadn’t been convinced. “He can survive one day without a new toy… I don’t want him to grow up an entitled prick.”</em></p><p><em>“Just take it, Agatha. He can care for it better than me, I’m in the hospital all the time… I bet it feels lonely.” She'd pouted, and Agatha had finally softened into a rare smile.</em></p><p><em>“Alright. Real grown up possessions, huh?” She’d wiggled the triceratops at her, and Rio had flipped her off, causing a mocking gasp.</em></p><p><em>“I got told to act like an adult since I was six, now I get to use my adult money on however many childish things I like.”</em></p><p><em>“Fair enough. Who am I to judge?” She’d shrugged, free hand spreading open at her side, smile lingering.</em></p><p><em>“Hmm,” Rio had drawn closer, where she could smell her perfume– “Rule four, right? Guess you’re my new friend.”</em></p><p><em>“Oh, we’re friends?” her heart had beaten harder against her ribcage–was Agatha going to imply they were more–“Don’t flatter yourself, darling.” </em></p><p><em>No, of course not. </em></p><p><em>She’d flipped her off again, and Agatha had laughed her genuine, bright laugh.</em></p><p><em>That one time, Agatha had let her kiss her goodbye. With tongue, and Agatha’s fingers finding their way inside her bra once again, but to Rio, it still counted.</em></p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>She got to hear about Nicky’s latest encounter with a praying mantis next, and once he was gone, she got to see Agatha steal a glance at her back on the way from his preschool to the car.</p><p>“Do you miss him when you’re away?” she asked once Agatha drove off. If Rio had done her homework well, it was always best to wait for Agatha to be distracted by some activity before asking her something that involved any degree of vulnerability.</p><p>Agatha hummed in thought, manicured fingers tapping on the steering wheel. “We don’t have much time to miss anyone at work, do we?”</p><p>She was evading the question. Also, false. Rio had time to think of Agatha at work. <em>Oops</em>. Rule four.</p><p>Unable to stay away until the next time they slept together, Rio patted Agatha’s knee twice. “Sure,” She said, trying not to sound too condescending. </p><p>“Okay, yes, I do wonder if he’s ok from time to time. If he’s having fun, if he’s learning enough… the usual, lame parent shit.” Agatha replied, eyes fixed on the road.</p><p><em>Dindingding</em>! Rio smiled to herself. She was beginning to master the Agatha Code: how to get her to talk. Agatha 101. Agatha Reading For Dummies. </p><p>So when Agatha told her to get off the car and get into the hospital five minutes before her, Rio tried to sound serious: “Come on, no one cares if we walk in together.”</p><p>“Untrue. Go.”</p><p>“Coooome oooon,” she sing-songed, “we could just be friends who carpooled. Or friends who had a sleepover.”</p><p>“Adult sleepovers are called fucking, sweetheart.” Agatha air-quoted the pet-name Rio sometimes used, “I got you here, didn’t even choke you once, now follow the rules.”</p><p>“Awn, more rules?” Also, Agatha could choke her whenever.</p><p>“Rule number seven, we don’t walk into the hospital together.”</p><p>“Wait, you do have more rules.” Crazy. She needed to know them all. “What are five and six?”</p><p>“Five and six are get off my car or we’ll be late for work.” She was getting pissed. Just what Rio liked. One more push, and…</p><p>“A kiss goodbye? Or a quickie?” She batted her eyes at Agatha.</p><p>“Oh my god, I’ll fucking choke you now—“ Agatha lunged for her, and Rio laughed. Before the other surgeon ruined the leather interiors with Rio’s blood as she ripped her head off, she was out of the car. </p><p>She didn’t want a kiss. Didn’t need a kiss. Just had to wait until the next time they fucked to kiss Agatha again.</p><p>Fun, not even in her longest dry spells had she felt so touch-starved.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“Drew, reconstruction-guy got postponed, call Darcy and tell her to come earlier.” Agatha’s head poked into the secretary’s office.</p><p>The 30yo, one of the plastics ward secretaries, looked at her through blonde bangs; that cut must be at least fifteen years too late. “Uh, you mean Darcy Lewis?” </p><p>Agatha nodded. Of course she meant fucking Darcy Lewis. </p><p>“Okay. I’ll let you know what time she can make it as soon as I get her.” Drew grabbed the phone on his desk–an embarrassingly ancient landline.</p><p>“Great, <em>thanks</em>.” Agatha waved as she closed the door. </p><p>This press thing was a little annoying—she basked in the attention, but patients usually didn’t, and it was a total drag to have to talk them through it. They wanted it, they signed up for it, and then inevitably started feeling self-conscious the moment the press arrived.</p><p>Time to check on Mrs. Hart, then.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>As it turned out, Mrs. Hart was not feeling self-conscious. On the contrary, she was all excited and perky—even worse?</p><p>“I can’t wait to make medical history!” She screeched, acute voice hurting Agatha’s sensibility. “And we’re going to be on tv! I told all my friends.”</p><p>“Yes, hmm, great.” Agatha clapped her hands together, “I’ll send Billy to get you when it’s time then, okay?” She flashed her one of her widest, fakest smiles. She’d need a lot of those today.</p><p>“Oh, please do! That little guy is so sweet—“</p><p>“Sure is!” Agatha was already halfway out the door. </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The moment they realized what was going on, people crowded inside and around Mrs. Hart’s new room—the prettiest, for the press. Residents, med students, nurses, even some attendings. The only one who seemed to be missing–and Agatha shouldn’t have noticed, and she shouldn’t have been feeling deceived–was Rio.</p><p>Lilia’s hands hung at the stethoscope around her neck, the foreign instrument Agatha never used. “You managed to gather a crowd once again. Thank god no one finds internal med this glamorous.”</p><p>“I love the glamour.” She stood, hands in the pockets of her white coat. They’d styled her hair into a complicated bun, her slack pants and shirt were perfectly ironed under a clean white coat, her make-up on point. Everything looked great. <em>Agatha,</em> she looked great.</p><p>“I know, it feeds your soul.” Lilia cackled “Have fun, doll,” and with one last look at Mrs. Hart, she left.</p><p>“Okay, shoo, everyone. All the students and residents, out.” A nurse started clearing the space, Darcy and the cameraman coming through.</p><p>“No, this one stays.” When the nurse started hushing him out, Agatha grabbed Billy by the back of his white-coat’s collar, and the resident looked at her like a proud puppy. “Stand behind them until I mention you,” she told him, no-nonsense. He nodded, his curls somehow looking <em>perkier</em> than usual.</p><p>And well, she needed a resident to show, so when they complimented her she could go: “Oh, it’s a team effort. I couldn’t do it without fetuses like him,” bla, bla.</p><p>“Are you ready?” Darcy asked her as she positioned herself at Mrs. Hart’s bedside.</p><p>“Do you even need to ask?” </p><p>Darcy chuckled, her dimples showing. “Okay, roll.” She gestured at the cameraman. She stood next to Agatha, tiny microphone in hand.</p><p>“We’re here again with Doctor Agatha Harkness, one of the most brilliant plastic surgeons in the country–”</p><p>“<em>Please</em>, I dare you to find a better one in the whole world.” Billy. Agatha wanted to strangle him for interrupting, and he was exaggerating–well, she could think of a few plastic surgeons she considered equals. </p><p>Still, when Darcy gestured at the cameraman to keep going, Agatha had to push down the disgusting proud smile that threatened to split her face.</p><p>“Doctor Harkness, can you tell us about the procedure you’re pioneering?”</p><p>“Of course, Darcy.” She smiled, taking her left hand out of the pocket of her white coat to gesture at Mrs. Hart. “Our kind, sweet Mrs. Hart here—“</p><p>Billy coughed, and Agatha turned and frowned at him. What the hell?</p><p>But he’d done it on purpose, he was mouthing something at her—</p><p>“What?” She asked, a hand flying up to block the camera. “We’ve just started.”</p><p>“I think he meant to say it’s Mrs. Davis, Agatha.” Mrs. Hart—no, <em>Davis</em>, nodded encouragingly up at her. Whoops. </p><p><em>Don’t laugh, don’t laugh…</em></p><p>Someone chucked from the doorway, and she knew that sound all too well. Liked it all too well. <em>Not the moment for that kind of thought.</em></p><p>Rio.</p><p>She spared her a glance, schooling her face into a sickeningly sweet smile for Mrs. Davis. “Ah, but of course, what did I say? Mrs. Hart? I’m <em>so</em> sorry,” she shrugged and touched her fingers to her forehead, gesturing how distracted she’d been. “Shall we start over?”</p><p>They started over. </p><p>“Mrs. Davis is the eigth patient in the human phase of our trial. As the previous two, she had to undergo a double mastectomy following a diagnosis of breast cancer, which she fought like the powerful bitch she is—“</p><p>Darcy dropped the mic, breaking into a smoky laugh. “Agatha, come on, you know I can’t let you say that…”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Alright, alright, I had to try.”</p><p>“You try that every time.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “I have to try it every time. Again.” She strained not to look at Rio shifting against the doorframe. Out of her mind. She needed to concentrate.</p><p>She started back, almost from the beginning. They got to Mrs. Davis' part, which Darcy said she’d take again after they were done with Agatha’s just in case they needed something different, then moved on to the big, basic explanation.</p><p>“We put Mrs. Davis’ own adipose cells, simply put her fatty cells, on an inorganic scaffold that allowed them to replicate following its specific shape. The scaffold was removed, and the newly formed tissue will be implanted tomorrow. The dimensions and shape of this self-made implant, of course, was planned together with Mrs. Davis to accommodate her wants and needs, and since it’s born out of her own cells, based on previous steps in this research field, we expect it to cause less complications than the usual breast implant. For one, it won’t need to be replaced in ten to—“</p><p>Her phone chimed. </p><p>“Ah, sorry, it could be an emergency—“ she fished it out of her pocket, checked her notifications—</p><p>Vidal💀: <em>You’re so hot right now, I’m going to rip that suit off you</em></p><p><em>Fuck</em>. How was she supposed to remember her script now with that image in her mind?<br/>
When she looked up, she was met with Rio’s lopsided smile. The resident leaned against the doorframe, fingers hovering over her phone.</p><p>Agatha was going to murder her. This thing where she kept sparing her ‘cause she was hot was just stupid.</p><p>Agatha: <em>No. 🔪</em></p><p>“All taken care of,” she slipped her phone back into her pocket, “where were we?”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Once that part was over and Darcy moved on to letting the lab rats (pathologists) and other such creatures shine, Agatha got called to the ER. </p><p>The patient she was consulting on turned out to be a 77 year old with a sudden onset of some weird kind of dementia—surprisingly young for her state. Severe osteoporosis had caused her hip fractures she hadn’t recovered from, and she’d stopped walking. And being bedridden, with diabetes and obesity, she’d developed pressure ulcers. Hence, for obvious reasons (no one else wanted to tell her relatives it was the end of her road) they’d called Agatha. Like surgically treating the ulcers would cure the poor woman.</p><p>As Agatha talked to her while Billy visited her, she realized there might be another reason why no one would want to take responsibility: the lady was kinda cool.</p><p>“Doctor, I know these look awful. Unlike my sons, who won’t let me leave this world in peace, I have eyes.” She laughed and pointed at them, ignoring Billy’s attempts to examine the wound under her elbow.</p><p>“Yes, I’m sorry you have to go through this.” Not much more she could say, nothing that would make it better. Either way, the lady’s memory would reset in a few seconds. “How many sons do you have?” She already knew. Two sons, 52 and 45.</p><p>“I have two. I would have made more, but a modern lady’s got to focus on her career.” She looked at Billy. “Am I right, boy? Who are you, a nurse?”</p><p>“I’m a medical resident, Mrs. Jefferson.” He repeated, smiling, and went on with the examination, risking an elbow in his face now and then.</p><p>“Well, I know these look awful. I have eyes, a lady knows when she’s got to leave the party.” She laughed, loud and spaced, and smacked Billy’s shoulder. “My sons won’t accept it, but I can. I don’t want any more surgeries. Would you talk to them, Doctor…?”</p><p>“Harkness. Of course I will, Mrs. Jefferson.” She dropped her hands into the pockets of her white coat, fingers curling around nothing in an old reflex to grasp her e-cig. Shit, that hadn’t happened in a while.</p><p>The patient smiled and nodded, her dark eyes wrinkling at the sides. “You look like a lady who can stand up for herself. My sons need a strong woman like yourself to guide them. Are you married? My Drew is single. He’s a good boy.”</p><p>Drew was 52 and married. Being a neurologist had to be its own kind of hell: this woman had had a whole life and personality, and here she was, trapped into a 12 seconds memory span, her long term memory full of holes too. Half of the neuro patients were some kind of variation of her.</p><p>“I’m sorry Mrs. Jefferson, I’m married,” She lied and pointed an index at Billy—“The resident’s single.”</p><p>Billy’s wide eyes, as huge as a deer’s in highlights, were worth the next seven seconds of the patient panicking in an attempt to let him down without coming off as a homophobe. Which, like—she might not have pulled it off so well, but considering her generation, kudos for trying.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Connel, her youngest son, was not as nice as his mother that day. He was also not being as realistic.</p><p>“Look, your mother has stage three and four ulcers. Even if I could do something about it, she can’t go through surgery. Her body wouldn’t be able to heal post-op, it’s not worth the pain you’d put her through.”</p><p>The guy ran a hand over his dark, overly gelled hair. “She’s not that old, ok? My friend’s father had ulcers at like eighty-five, and he got treated.” Great, the “my acquaintance said” argument. She hadn’t heard that one in a while. “First the neurologist says he can’t do anything to improve her deliriums—“ not deliriums, Agatha thought, but it wasn’t her place to correct that. Likely no point in trying anyway. “—Now you tell me this? It doesn’t make sense, she’s not even in pain.“</p><p>“The ulcers aren’t causing pain because they’re so deep that nerve endings have been destroyed. That doesn’t mean she can live with them. With wounds that deep, and with her comorbidities, she’s very susceptible to infections—“</p><p>“Then treat them!” He interrupted, raising his voice a little. “Do something! I—“</p><p>Agatha’s phone rang, cutting him off. It was just Drew calling, so she turned down the call. “I’m sorry, keep going.”</p><p>He huffed. “Do something, okay? This is unacceptable! I won’t stand for—“</p><p>Her ringtone interrupted him once again. Drew. Someone better be dying for him to call her again after she’d turned down one call—she silenced it instead of answering right away.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Jefferson, let me answer this and get back to you. You were going to visit your mother now, right?” This jerk better not complain about having to wait. Not Agatha’s fault hospital life was insane.</p><p>The guy’s face said he really, really wanted to complain. Loud and clear. “Yes, fine,” he said, sounding irritated, “but make it fast. I won’t be here all day.”</p><p>“Of course, we’ll finish our talk as soon as possible.” She was already walking away, “I’m so sorry about the inconvenience. Hospitals, right?” She shook her head in well-crafted disapproval and left.</p><p>Ugh, this guy was going to be hard to reason with. But her patient was his mother, not him. She had to fight for her.</p><p>Right now, though, she had to put that on hold. Striding to an isolated corridor, she called 2010-Justin-Bieber-bangs back–</p><p>“Doctor Harkness,” Drew’s voice sounded worried over the phone, like this was something he actually cared about. “There seems to be an issue with Mrs. Davis’ insurance coverage. They’ve found some loophole and won’t cover their portion of the surgery expenses. Should Mrs. Davis be discharged?”</p><p>No. No way this was happening again.</p><p>“What loophole?” <em>Fuck. </em>She’d just given a stupid interview about this. She needed her for the trial too, and they’d all spent so much time on it, and–no fucking way she was letting this happen to Mrs. Hart. If men had breasts, insurance companies would pay for reconstruction surgeries down to the last dime.</p><p>“I’m not sure, I think Billy–”</p><p>“Alright,” Agatha interrupted him, she had no time to waste, “I’m calling Billy. Don’t get her discharged, don’t do <em>anything</em>.”</p><p>“Okay Doctor Harkness–” she hung up.</p><p>She was on with Billy right away. “Update me on Mrs. Hart.” She paced the small, empty corridor.</p><p>And Billy didn’t waste her time. “Sharon’s insurance company has just changed a policy, they’re not covering experimental procedures as of tomorrow.”</p><p>Fuck, the procedure was scheduled the next day. “Can we do it by midnight?” She was asking herself more than him. But Mrs. Hart had definitely been eating, and even if she stopped in time, finding the personnel for the procedure late at night was going to be impossible. </p><p>“I don’t think–” Billy started,</p><p>“I know. Okay, don’t discharge her yet. I’ll get back to you.” She hung up on him too.</p><p>And what she had to do next—she didn’t necessarily like it.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>When Rio slipped into her office, she was wearing her signature smug smile.</p><p>“Did you page me so I could make good on my text?” She asked, walking to her side of the desk and sitting against it, forcing her to look up from her chair.</p><p>“In your dreams. I still have to do some takes in the glass tower and ORs, I won’t let you ruin my hair and makeup.” </p><p>Rio pouted, and Agatha only granted her a brief sarcastic smile before getting to business: “Sharon’s surgery was canceled. Her insurance fell through.”</p><p>Rio’s face fell. “Oh, shit. That always sucks when it happens, I’m sorry. Literally what I hate most about healthcare.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.” Agatha waved a hand. “I want you to get the board to pay for it. What they’ll make from promoting this will far outweigh the expense.”</p><p>Rio frowned. She swung slightly back over the desk edge, balancing her weight on the heels of her hands as her feet left the ground. “You can’t ask me this. It’s not fair.” </p><p>“Why not?” Agatha shrugged. But she knew where this was going.</p><p>Rio’s feet dangled as she swung back again. She better not fall and break her neck—</p><p>“Agatha, we’re sleeping together. It’s not fair that you get to do this when no one else can.”</p><p>“Everyone who knows you’re on the board can.”</p><p>“Yeah, but it’s different for you…” Rio’s eyebrows rose, she looked down. Her feet left the floor again—</p><p>“Why?” It wasn’t different. They had sex; so what?</p><p>“You know why.” Rio wouldn’t budge. She kept swinging back and forth, and it was driving Agatha crazy.</p><p>“No, I don’t.“ She held her stare.</p><p>Rio stayed silent for a moment, unmoving. <em>Finally,</em> thanks.</p><p>“It’s just—different.” She said quietly. </p><p>Did she mean… no, of course not. She couldn’t let such idiotic thoughts take her off-path. </p><p>She mulled the issue over briefly. New pl—</p><p>Rio started swinging over the edge of the desk again.</p><p>“Would you fucking stop that?! I don’t want you to slip and split your head!” When Rio’s eyebrows shot upward, Agatha specified: “—In my office.”</p><p>Rio hummed like she wasn’t convinced, she set her feet steadily against the ground and crossed her arms.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said, huffing lightly. As she was thinking—new plan: “Do you agree that Sharon should get the surgery?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Of course, but—“</p><p>“Would you think so even if I didn’t?” She interrupted.</p><p>“Yes, but—“</p><p>“So it’s not about me, see? Get her the procedure.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “I wish the whole world had free healthcare, that doesn’t mean I can make it happen. I can’t <em>force</em> the board to do anything, there are rules.”</p><p>“The rules suck. So—“</p><p>“They’re shit, but I can’t change them. Not that easily anyways.”</p><p>“Then work around them!” She lost her cool a tiny bit. This whole thing wasn’t working, she hadn’t expected Rio to be so stubborn about damned <em>rules</em>. Rio and rules weren’t something that normally went hand in hand.</p><p>“Agatha, I can’t. It’s not fair of you to ask me this.” Okay, so <em>maybe</em> it wasn’t really about the rules. </p><p>Agatha stood from her chair, dangerously close to Rio for a moment, dangerously close to losing her focus, pausing. Before the pause got too long, she stepped away, paced to the back of the room to pinch the bridge of her nose, squeezing her eyes as she timed out. </p><p>Okay, she hated the idea passionately, but she needed to bring in the big guns. </p><p>She turned around, walked back to Rio, dangerously close again—but this time it was on purpose. The resident’s eyes focused closely on her.</p><p>“Look, I can’t let this happen. After Mrs. Doona, I have to—“ she had to stop and exhale sharply. Maybe it was just a last resort, maybe some of it was true–either way, it was hard to get out. “I have to give Mrs. Hart what I couldn’t give Mrs. Doona.” Her voice went quieter, but she managed to keep it from shaking. Or so she hoped.</p><p>Rio’s features shifted from mildly annoyed, to soft, to… a smile?<br/>
She broke into a laugh.</p><p>“What are you…?” Agatha trailed away, baffled. Was Rio reading through her?</p><p>“I’m sorry, but you keep mixing up her name!” She dried the tear collecting to the side of her eye, sighing. Prettiest, most annoying thing ever. If it made Rio laugh, she’d mix up every name in the goddamn countr–</p><p><em>No. Stop it, you fool.</em></p><p>“Ugh, hell, she was married to a different guy when I first met her, ok? Not my fault society has this ridiculous, patriarchal custom…”</p><p>Rio just went on smiling, and Agatha took a deep breath. No time to go off topic.</p><p>“Rio, please. I have to do this. I need to make up for what I did.” And if she didn’t say yes to this, maybe there really was no difference between Agatha and anyone else. If she refused—</p><p>Rio’s features fully softened, she uncrossed her arms. “Agatha, it wasn’t your fault, you don’t have to make up for it. And even if you did, you’ve helped so many people, you’d be way far ahead.”</p><p>Agatha had to swallow back the nagging sensation in her chest. “That’s not how it feels. You don’t know how many decisions I’ve regretted.” She certainly regretted the stupid knot in her throat right now. And the small furrow of her brows she knew she wasn’t successfully smoothing.</p><p>She looked down, and Rio’s palms were suddenly on her cheeks, warm and calming. So gentle, the knot in her throat threatened to turn into tears, her eyes feeling watery. Why was it that every time the stupid resident was around she got so vulnerable and whiny? Maybe she wasn’t used to the softness. Or maybe ‘cause Rio was just… <em>good.</em> </p><p>So good, she’d give Agatha exactly what she wanted.</p><p>She steadied herself, held the tears back. She wasn’t the victim here–never had been. She didn’t get to cry.</p><p>When she looked up at her, Rio looked uncertain—to Agatha, that was a win. A bitter one. The way Rio’s eyes shifted over her face, studying her like she actually <em>understood</em>, was terrifying, but Agatha knew it played in her favor. Whatever the reason, Rio seemed to care a little bit about her.</p><p>So, she’d guessed opening up would help tip the scales for Rio. Another thing that might, as wrong as it would be to exploit it, was…</p><p>She let a fraction of the sorrow she usually pushed down show on her face, and—“Please, <em>baby</em>.” </p><p>Because Rio always lost her resolve at that.</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Rio’s face, and she took a moment to stare through her–Agatha felt like crawling out of her skin. Too exposed. Vulnerable and guilty as fuck, all in one.</p><p>Then, thank god, Rio gave the smallest of nods. </p><p> </p><p>*** </p><p> </p><p>She went back to the ER, Rio going with for a case she’d been paged over. When Agatha found Mr. Jefferson, he was ten times as pissed as before.</p><p>“I have a job! I can’t be here all day!” Too loud, in the middle of the ER, full of people who were already in pain. And it had only been half an hour. </p><p>His mother hadn’t been moved yet–every eligible department claimed they didn’t have beds. Most likely, if Agatha could venture a guess, they didn’t want a patient who might end up taking one for weeks. </p><p>“You’re right, Mr. Jefferson, I’m sorry about that,” she lied, hoping to calm him down. Behind him, Rio briefly stopped palpating her patient’s abdomen to stare daggers into Mr. Jefferson’s back. “Should we talk somewhere more private?”</p><p>“No, we’re talking right here, right now,” he spat out.</p><p>“Very well.” He wasn’t going to make it any easier, huh. “As I was saying, your mother herself has come to terms with her conditions, and–”</p><p>Wanda passed by. Right, she was back. She stopped at the bed next to Rio’s patient’s–</p><p>Wait, Wanda<em>?</em> <em>Rio and Wanda</em>.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck. She’d been so caught up in her stuff, she hadn’t considered Wanda. And Rio. And Rio meeting Vision when she’d first slept over.<br/>
<em>Hell,</em> how could she have been so stupid? </p><p>Wanda knew.</p><p>She realized she’d trailed off when Mr. Jefferson practically sneered at her. “What, another patient that deserves your attention more than my mother?”</p><p>She chose to ignore that. She was at fault this time, but saying sorry too often might take the meaning out of it. “Of course not. Look, your mother doesn’t want surgery. She–”</p><p>“She can’t remember a fucking thing right now! Anything she says is meaningless!” He raised his voice again, and Agatha briefly registered Rio moving in behind him. <em>Stay the fuck away.</em></p><p>“<em>Yes,</em> as I was trying to say–” Agatha tried,</p><p>“What are you, an idiot?” Okay, if she hadn’t been a professional, and if they hadn’t been in an ER full of witnesses, she would have punched him. And he wasn’t done, his muscles locked, a vein popping in his neck as he gesticulated too close to her: “All those cameras I saw—I was told you were the best, but it must all be for show! Or do you only have time for rich people, and us working class don’t matter?”</p><p>They definitely should have done this in private. Everyone in the ER was staring. </p><p>And Rio stepped behind her, too close. Fuck, she didn’t need her to escalate the situation. </p><p>Agatha turned an inch sideways, Rio in her peripheral vision. “Step away,” she said, razor-sharp. </p><p>But Rio wasn’t looking at her. She was single-mindedly focused on Mr. Jefferson.</p><p>“You bitch, anything is more important than my mother, is it!?” He screamed and seized Agatha’s arm too strongly, pain shooting up from his clutch– </p><p>“LOOK AT ME!” –He screamed,<br/>
“Don’t touch her.” </p><p>Rio, ice cold. She stepped to her side, forcefully pulled his wrist away by twisting his arm outwards. He growled, probably in pain. “Who the fuck are you, her lap dog!?” He lunged to grab Rio’s scrubs collar, the resident ducked back, his hand flying up and hitting her chin and mouth—if Rio got hurt, Agatha would kill her—</p><p>Blood smeared Rio’s hand when she drew it over her lips. But the guy pushed her aside and she stumbled back, Agatha following to catch her... </p><p>Mr. Jefferson yanked Agatha’s arm toward himself. “You <em>stay</em> here,“ eyes bloodshot, looking fucking possessed.</p><p>And then, Agatha saw it happen in slow motion. Rio caught his wrist again. Her free elbow tucked back, she yanked the guy’s arm down and outwards, pulling him in—and putting her whole weight into it, she punched him. A wet crack sounded, knuckles meeting cheekbone, and the plastic surgeon in Agatha couldn’t help but cringe, but–</p><p>“I told you not to touch her.” </p><p>Adrenaline surged through her, sweet and twisted, heart pumping stronger–</p><p>And sure, as many other surgeons, she loved the adrenaline. The sick exhilaration at seeing yet another messy, bloody trauma.</p><p>But this time, it was different. Adrenaline surged through her at the sight of blood—blood <em>Rio</em> had spilled for<em> her</em>.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>All hell broke loose.</p><p>Security came, Agatha barely had time to register what was happening. When Wanda came to check on her, she dismissed her by telling her they needed to talk, later. Somehow, between flatly telling a nurse to page ORL for the guy’s nose and convincing another that she wasn’t hurt, she managed to grab Rio and pull her away.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dragged her through the ER, through some corridors, up the elevator to the plastics’ floor, all without saying a word.</p><p>She didn’t even look at her.</p><p>Agatha’s clutch on her arm reminded her of the first time they’d fought, back to their first night shift together. She’d felt so unattainable back then–and now? Still too far, just a different way. </p><p><em>Four</em>. She hated that number.</p><p>Her lower lip and knuckles throbbed painfully, and she tasted blood, but she didn’t care.</p><p>This time, Agatha’s hold dropped gradually lower. She didn’t seem to notice nor care about the people around them; she never let Rio go. Her hand dropped down Rio’s arm, to her forearm, to her wrist. </p><p>For Agatha not to care who saw them, she must be pissed as fuck.</p><p>Rio wished the hold would drop even lower. Agatha had never held her hand.</p><p>Agatha finally dragged her into her office, pushed her down into her precious, forbidden throne, which–<em>wow</em>. What an honor.</p><p>“I don’t need you to lecture me, I–” Rio started, deadly serious, set on preceding her– </p><p>“Don’t move.” Agatha barely even looked at her, <em>still</em>. Rio needed her to look.</p><p>She left in a swirl of her white coat, door swinging close behind her, and Rio was left there with her brows furrowed, her bloody hand throbbing harder, a confusion in her adrenaline-pumped brain like she hadn’t felt in ages.</p><p>She sat back. Swirled in the chair. Studied the pain in her hand when she slowly opened and closed her fingers, touched them to the throbbing side of her lip. The thought never even crossed her mind not to follow Agatha’s order. It <em>did</em> cross her mind that going back, even knowing about the bruising, she would do it all over again.</p><p>As she was about to fish her phone out to watch her split lip in the internal camera, Agatha came back. She was carrying an ice pack, and she locked the door behind her.</p><p>Okay, she’d always thought of it as a joke, but Agatha might actually be about to murder her.</p><p>And then, voice dark, Agatha said: “Take off your shirt.” </p><p>“<em>What?</em> I told you I don’t need a lect–” </p><p>Agatha closed the distance in a few long strides and shoved the ice pack in her face, effectively shutting her up. And <em>wait</em>, Rio’s brain started processing, <em>her shirt?</em></p><p>Agatha temporarily pushed the ice pack down, unceremoniously pulling Rio’s bloody lip down to examine it, ignoring her painful whines. She grabbed her jaw and turned it left and right before letting her go and roughly putting the ice pack back.</p><p>And then, <em>finally</em>, Agatha’s eyes were on hers. And they were dark as fuck—the good kind of dark, pupils swallowing the blue.<br/>
“That was fucking hot.” </p><p>“I don’t…” Rio’s words were muffled by the ice pack as she snatched it from Agatha, keeping it in place herself, “Waiff, what?” <em>Hot.</em></p><p>Agatha didn’t answer; she impatiently turned her bruised fist, knuckles first, to hold the ice pack on her face, so it would cover both injuries at the same time.</p><p>“<em>Hmm</em>, bossy. Are you like fthis with all your patients?” Rio asked, muffled voice suddenly cracking at the edges, and she found her free hand was pulling Agatha into her lap. </p><p>“What if I am?” Agatha hissed and slapped her hand away, but she settled around her. <em>Good girl</em>. </p><p>Rio didn’t say it out loud, but she did subtly move the ice pack away from her mouth to stop sounding silly. “Then I should be your only patient.” <br/>
Oops. Was jealousy a feeling contemplated by rule four?</p><p>Agatha obviously chose to ignore her, instead focusing on impatiently helping Rio’s lonely free hand unbutton her pants. <em>God, yes.</em> </p><p>Was she going to let her fuck her? In her off-limits office, on her forbidden chair? With that outfit, and the hair, and the way she’d looked behind cameras all morning, like she owned the world—</p><p>“You’re letting me fuck you on the forbidden throne, Agatha?” Rio teased. <em>Oh</em>, she’d pay for it. Agatha would make sure of it. </p><p>“What the hell are you talking about?” She seized Rio’s left wrist, but then she seemed to change her mind, letting it go. She slipped her own hand into her pants, rolled her hips over it, and Rio’s brain immediately short-circuited. Was it possible to feel exactly what Agatha was feeling, without getting touched? ‘Cause she did.</p><p>She had to swallow thickly, holding back a moan–hospital policy–before she was able to speak. “Your throne.” Agatha’s lips parted as she released a shaky breath–which, illegal it wasn’t coming from Rio’s hands–”The chair.” Her voice sounded shakier than Agatha’s breathing. Damn, unfair. It was too easy for her to get to Rio.</p><p>“Shut up, nerd.” Hips meeting her own hand, Agatha’s beautiful, perfect eyes dropped to Rio’s lips, and her own twitched like she wanted to—<br/>
Dropping the ice pack, Rio moved in to kiss her.</p><p>Agatha pulled away. Her fingers hooked around Rio’s jaw, pushing her head back against the chair—<em>fuck yes, </em>Rio mewled. Low-volume, but still…</p><p>“No kissing. And don’t touch my hair.” Rio must have frowned, because–“Interview,” Agatha elaborated.</p><p>Stupid interview. She’d punch the interview, too. </p><p>She snagged Agatha’s hand out of her pants, replacing it with hers, causing a muffled groan out of Agatha as she pushed the ice pack and her bruised fist back where they belonged. </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio started, coy. She let the unruly surgeon grind against her uninjured hand, the damp fabric of her underwear shooting hot waves to Rio’s core, and Agatha’s lips thinned in an attempt not to make a sound.</p><p>“Mmhf, <em>what</em>?” </p><p>“I should use violence more often.” Rio slipped her fingers into Agatha’s underwear as she said it, and the beautiful beast above her shut her eyes, brows tilting up in the middle. <em>Perfection. </em>It was the definition of her face. </p><p>“You def—” she had to stop, fingers curling around Rio’s tense forearm, hips rolling in time with the circles her fingers were drawing through her slick–”You definitely should.” And then Agatha’s nails dug into Rio’s muscles, and Rio—she slipped two fingers inside her.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw went slack, she fell closer, arms wrapping around Rio’s neck. <em>Damn</em>, she needed to kiss her. She needed to kiss her. Slow and deep, like her life depended on it.<br/>
But Agatha’s walls twitching around her fingers, and the barely audible wet sounds, and <em>Agatha</em>, perfectly styled but in that godlike flush—Rio’s clit started throbbing in time with her injured lip. </p><p>She strained to remember where she’d been going.<br/>
“No lecture about how it might ruin my career?” Sounding surprisingly smug, still.</p><p>“I don’t give a fuck about your career,” Agatha said through clenched teeth. </p><p><em>This</em> <em>bitch</em>. </p><p>Ice pack falling to the ground, she grabbed her ass with both hands and stood up with Agatha around her. Papers and stuff flying to the ground, she set her roughly on her glass desk and slipped inside her again, Agatha mewling with her mouth closed, the sound pure bliss to Rio’s burning core.</p><p>She could finally use her dominant hand, now. And with each thrust, it hurt like a bitch, but it was totally worth it.</p><p>She undid Agatha’s bun with her left hand, fingers threading through falling curls, pulling her head back hard.</p><p>“I told you not to touch my hair–” Oh, <em>now</em> she was pissed.</p><p>“But baby, it looks best down. I want all those plastics rich fucks to see it and know they can’t touch. I’m the only one who can touch, aren’t I?” The amusement was clear in her voice—and she wasn’t just talking about Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p><em>Wrong answer.</em></p><p>She fisted most of Agatha’s now loose hair, gaining a muffled moan as she picked up her pace.</p><p>“Aren’t I, Agatha?” </p><p>“You, uhh..." Rio pulled on her hair-"Yes, hmff, you are, you <em>are</em>–” Her eyes fluttered closed, she was straining to keep the moaning down.</p><p>“Am I the only one who gets to fuck you? The only one the mighty doctor Harkness begs to screw her?”</p><p>“You wish—mmf—I never begged—“</p><p>“Come on, Agatha, be good. Liars get punished.” She said it close to her mouth, threatening to kiss her.</p><p>Agatha turned away. Asshole.</p><p>“We both—“ Rio pumped harder, Agatha had to start over, fingers digging into the back of Rio’s neck, “we both know, hmmmf, how it ends when you—ahh, fuck, how it ends when you say you’ll punish me—“ </p><p>“I guess we’ll have to change that.”</p><p>Rio bent over her, lips capturing her pulse and sucking painfully hard, thumb stimulating her clit as she curled her fingers inside her. Agatha’s head threw back as she panted hard, offering Rio her full neck.</p><p>“Good <em>girl</em>,” she purred against her skin, and Agatha actually <em>growled</em>. </p><p>Rio would never have enough of pissing her off. </p><p>With Rio’s teeth digging into her skin and her fingers still pulling her hair, Agatha’s walls started to throb harder and faster, and in a matter of seconds she was falling over the edge, gritting her teeth to keep silent, somehow still looking mad, grinding hard through the last waves of her orgasm.</p><p>There was a moment then, so fleeting it felt like a dream, when Agatha’s features softened. Her eyes focused on Rio’s, one hand sliding down to fist her scrubs shirt closer—and she stamped a featherlight kiss on Rio’s lips.</p><p>It took her only a moment to recover, looking like it had never even happened at all.</p><p>It took Rio’s heart forever to stop burning a hole through her chest. For her insides to stop twisting.</p><p>Rio had to suck her own fingers clean when she finally slipped them out, lower lip hurting a fucking lot—worth it for the way Agatha watched her, looking more pissed than ever, even after the sweet release she’d just given her.</p><p>What a soft-hearted angel, Agatha. The best.</p><p>She pushed both hands against Rio’s chest and stepped off her desk, buttoned her pants and, heels clicking on the ground, she walked to the door.</p><p>She gestured to the ground below Rio, barely even turning around. “Put that stuff back, then meet me in exam room 13.”</p><p>“Yes ma’am.”</p><p>“Don’t “yes, ma’am” me right now.” Okay, she must actually be pissed. And Rio wasn’t sure why, among other things, calling her a good girl had been such a trigger.</p><p>“Yes, angel.” That would make her even angrier.</p><p>Agatha violently opened the door—</p><p>“Sweetheart…?” Rio stopped her.</p><p>“What?!” </p><p>She pointed at her neck. “You might want to cover that up.”</p><p>Hand flying over the blood-smudged hickey, red from Rio’s split lip, Agatha growled. “I’m going to murder you in your sleep–”</p><p>“By all means, feel free to. Please.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>***</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>She was squatting down, gathering stuff from the floor, when Billy came knocking. His curly head popped in before he did, eyebrows shooting up.</p><p>“Was she super mad? She’s never thrown stuff around before.” He looked at her with pity.</p><p>Rio tried to hold in a laugh. “Yeah, pretty mad.”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” he said in a schooling tone, “you have to stop riling her up. I’m worried for your safety.“ he chuckled. “And she’s been so nice in the past couple weeks, really, you’ll ruin it…”</p><p><em>Hmm</em>, the last couple weeks. Interesting.</p><p>She looked at him, standing up. “Don’t worry about it, Billyboard. I’m having the time of my life.”</p><p>He basically gaped at her—.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You have blood on your upper teeth…” he trailed off, Rio running her tongue against the burning cut inside her lower lip as she stacked the last of the papers in a random order. “Why did you punch a guy, anyway?”</p><p>News flew in this hospital, Agatha wasn’t wrong about that. </p><p>“He was being aggressive. I was afraid he’d hurt—” Billy’s eyes got keener, ”—someone. I guess you already know the story.”</p><p>“I wasn’t asking for the story. I was asking about, like, your feelings.” </p><p>Rio smiled, a genuine one. “Thanks, I already have a shrink. And there’s really not much to add, I was just trying to protect a friend.” A friend she liked to kiss and stare at way longer than socially acceptable. </p><p>Billy hummed, pleasantly surprised. “You’re friends?” </p><p>Rio shrugged, a grin taking over her face. “Not sure she’d agree with me.”</p><p>He was sorting through papers, re-ordering them, and he hummed through a smile. “Maybe not out loud,” he replied. <br/>
He looked up at her then, Rio just hanging around, fidgeting with a weirdly-shaped promotional ruler from Agatha’s desk, some medical brand printed on it. “What will happen to you now? Will you get suspended or something?”</p><p>Rio hummed in though, looking up. “Not sure. I’m finishing my residency soon—what can they do, ban me from ORs for three weeks?”</p><p>“Aren’t you scar–”</p><p>“Why are you here?” Better turn the questioning on Billy, before he went full overthinking mode.</p><p>“Uhm, I needed to ask Doctor Harkness if I can discharge Mrs. Davis. Her surgery will likely be canceled, the—“</p><p>“Insurance. Yeah.”</p><p>Billy’s eyebrows raised in surprise again. “You know?”</p><p>“Sure.” Rio was not explaining—well, finding excuses—right now. Agatha was waiting for her, and she didn’t like to make her wait too long. Well, except <em>maybe</em> in specific circumstances…</p><p>Before her brain went down that road, she refocused on Billy. “Discharge her. There’s no way this will be fixed in a day, trust me.”</p><p>“But I need to ask Doct—“</p><p>“Discharge her. I’ll make sure Agatha knows, I’m seeing her now.”</p><p>Billy looked like he just wanted to nod, but as Rio began to step out, curiosity got the better of him: “Why are you seeing her now?”</p><p>“Aw, don’t be jealous, Billybug.” Rio waved her fingers goodbye, “You’re still mama’s favorite boy.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>***</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Exam room 13. The door was open a sliver, and she quietly entered and closed it behind her.</p><p>Agatha was crouching down and rummaging through a drawer, muttering about “whoever it was that kept reorganizing stuff”. She’d readied a Mayo stand and a stool in front of the exam bed, which had a few medical supplies scattered on one side.</p><p>Only once Agatha emerged victorious from her hunt did Rio notice the band-aid on her neck, covering her new, temporary Rio-tattoo. Which—<em>fun. </em>It would be in every interview take that afternoon.</p><p>Agatha pointed at the bed, oblivious to Rio’s thoughts. “Sit there,” she said.</p><p>She was going to patch her up, wasn’t she?  Rio smiled. Most adorable thing she could do, after all the… what to call it? <em>Brat bottoming</em>. </p><p>She complied, hopping on the blue exam bed. Legs swinging, she set her hands between her knees and waited. She’d go easy on Agatha, now; the cutiepie deserved it.</p><p>That was when she saw what the other surgeon had just thrown to the pile of stuff to her side, and—</p><p>“Wait, are you going to give me stitches?” The lip cut hurt like hell, but it felt just an inch long or so, and it couldn’t be very deep if she could still speak properly and all…</p><p>“<em>Maybe</em>.” There was mirth in Agatha’s answer, like she enjoyed the idea of poking her with a suture needle.</p><p>Rio’s smile grew. If that was what she needed to do to get over the hair thing, and the hickey thing, and the “good girl“ thing…</p><p>“Let me see—“ Agatha walked right in front of her and, without warning–<em>again</em>, she pulled her lower lip down with her thumb. And as Rio whined and fought the strange urge to bite her fingers, she hummed, gloved fingers doing whatever they wanted with her mouth.</p><p><em>Hmm</em>. She <em>could</em> do whatever she wanted with her mouth.</p><p>Agatha must have seen the thought reflected on her face, because she released her lip, gave her a small chastising slap on the cheek, and pulled the stool closer with a heeled foot to sit in front of her. </p><p>She was definitely in a better mood, huh?</p><p>And she was, because she raised an eyebrow at her, and then, “Does it hurt if I do this?” She poked the cut—fucking <em>ouch</em>, that wasn’t part of the examination.</p><p>Trying to hold back the small tears forming at the sides of her eyes, Rio shook her head no.</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows shot up, her lips pursed, and she hummed appreciatively. “What about now?” And she did it again. <em>Oh</em>, game on. </p><p>“Ouww,” a whine escaped her, but she snapped forward, biting on Agatha’s fingers. Hard enough to trap her, not enough to cause serious pain.</p><p>Agatha laughed as she tried to take her hand back, Rio only relenting her hold a second later, mesmerized. Cause <em>wow</em>, her laugh. Her eyes looked like waves sparkling in the sun.<br/>
<em>Ouff</em>, Agatha would deem the thought very pathetic.</p><p>“I’d get stitches if I were you, it’s going to heal horribly otherwise,” she said, smile only partially fading, snapping Rio back to reality, “but don’t worry, I happen to know a plastic surgeon, and she’s a goddess with 5-0s.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio pretended to think about it, “will it be very expensive?”</p><p>“Of course, darling. After all, I’m the best,” and her hand drew a flourish next to her face.</p><p>Rio smirked. “I know a way or two I can pay you back.” Her tongue drew the length of the cut, the burning somehow soothing her.</p><p>Agatha’s index tapped below Rio’s chin, tilting her head up. “I know you do, <em>darling</em>.” And Rio felt all the unreleased tension from earlier coil tightly in her lower abdomen.</p><p>Damn, fucking Agatha was the best, but she needed those perfect fingers somewhere <em>else</em>, as soon as possible. Not knowing she’d get her next chance was torture.</p><p>“Come over to discuss Mrs. Davis tomorrow night,” she blurted out as Agatha readied herself for the suture, putting on sterile gloves. “I have some ideas.” </p><p>Like she needed an excuse to ask Agatha over. She didn’t, but she’d just slept over the previous night…</p><p>Agatha waved at the surgical instruments, and Rio started unpacking and dropping them on the Mayo stand, careful not to touch them.</p><p>“After I put Nicky to bed?” She asked, pulling on a glove‘s fingers to fix it.</p><p>“Sure. Tomorrow’s Friday, no weekend shifts, and Alice is staying over at your girlfriend’s...”</p><p>Agatha let out a dry chuckle, raising an eyebrow at her. “My girlfriend?”</p><p>“Jennifer Kale.”</p><p>“I know who my girlfriend is. We cuddle to sleep every night.”</p><p>“<em>Ha ha</em>.” She fake-laughed. “Pretty sure you cuddled me last ni–”</p><p>Agatha physically covered her mouth. “We’re still in the hospital,” but were her lips just a little curled up?</p><p>That made Rio smile like a dummy until she got released. “So? Come over?”<br/>
<em>Say yes.</em></p><p>“Hmm, no sex for you, if that’s what you’re angling for.” She wore a faint smirk.</p><p>Rio’s face fell. “What? Why?” She gaped, “What?”</p><p>“You’re stuck, honey.” Agatha tapped her cheek. “Actions have consequences. You punch someone—” she looked away, laughing, “Who am I kidding? I don’t care.” and she shrugged. “You undo my hair, you give me a hickey on the day I’m getting filmed—you have to pay.”</p><p>Rio smiled to herself. Still totally worth it. “Come over anyways. We’ll actually talk work.” That, <em>and</em> Agatha would fold as soon as she saw some naked skin.</p><p>“I’m not giving in. Forget it.” </p><p>What was she, reading her mind? Witch. “<em>Suure</em>. Come over and prove it.” She grinned up at her, and Agatha finally capitulated.</p><p>“Okay.” <em>Fuck yeah.</em> Agatha’s smirk grew before fading, and she huffed, mood shifting. “I hoped Sharon’s thing would get fixed by tomorrow and I wouldn’t have to move her surgery. I need to get her discharged.”</p><p>“I already got Billy to do it.” </p><p>Agatha flashed her a threatening look, “Don’t give <em>my</em> little elf orders.” But then she softened. “Thanks.”</p><p>“No worries.“ She looked at her fix the suture needle into a needle holder—“Huh, I’ll have something of yours forever.” The suture, she meant the suture. She said it without thinking it through, pointing at the needle.</p><p>Agatha froze. She stared up at her, head tilted down. Hands still. <br/>
“Do you want someone else to do it?”</p><p>Rio swallowed. Yeah, she definitely should say yes.</p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>She took her time to fix Rio’s inner lip, but when she was done, it looked flawless. Like it had never split in the first place. Obviously, cause she had magic hands.</p><p>When she pointed it out, proudly examining her tiny work of art—the fact that she’d put her signature on Rio totally not inflating her ego—the resident smirked. </p><p>Also obviously, cause Rio loved to remind her they slept together any chance she got, “You do have magic hands,” she remarked, eyes drifting up from the object of discussion deliberately slowly.</p><p>She moved on to cleaning her knuckles then, and the resident was impressively immune to the pain inflicted. Not that she didn’t complain—she did, whining like a puppy and making huge eyes at her, but when she didn’t flinch at the worst parts, Agatha started suspecting it was all for show. She was whining for her attention.</p><p>And fuck her if it wasn’t kind of <em>horribly</em> endearing.</p><p>The simple, manual work she usually left to residents gave her a break from the insane day, and she was finally starting to relax. With Rio’s hand warm and soft under her fingers, and Rio humming a slow song… </p><p>She was almost done, lost in the calm of the moment, when she heard the door rattle open at her back. The real world had to come bursting in, eventually. </p><p>Billy’s voice got to her before she even turned around, as she reached for a gauze roll—“Hey, uhm, someone’s looking for—“</p><p>“<em>Move</em>, boy.” </p><p>Ah, shit. </p><p>Agatha’s hand paused, holding gauze mid-air, as she watched Billy get pushed aside by— </p><p>“Rio Roberta Vidal…”</p><p>None other than Carol Walsh.</p><p>“How could you do this again!?”</p>

<p>***</p><p> </p><p>“How could you do this again?!” Carol’s thin frame quite literally stomped to her daughter.</p><p>“Wha’ the hell are you…” Rio started, mood doing a 180. She would have sounded serious if her voice hadn’t been slurred from trying not to move her stitched lip too much.</p><p>“<em>Don’t</em> talk to me that way. You know how hard it was to move you to one of the best hospitals in the country, after what you did?” Carol was fuming. Nice. So there <em>was</em> something that could make her completely lose her mind: Rio. Good to know. “It hasn’t even been six months!”</p><p>“This was nothing like last time! And what the hell are you doing here? I didn’t even know you were in town!”</p><p>“I’m here because Agatha called me.” She pointed at her, and the accused kept pretending she wasn’t in the room, fixing the bandage around Rio’s hand at intern speed. Very fucking slow.</p><p>When Rio looked at her, nostrils flaring at the edge of Agatha’s vision, she couldn’t ignore the heavy silence. Okay, maybe staying quiet so they wouldn’t throw her out wasn’t an option.</p><p>“Who, moi?” She put out there as she snapped the latex gloves off, “I didn’t call her about you. She called me first!” She raised her hands defensively, “I’m not a snitch.”</p><p>Rio’s rage focused on her mother once again. But for a second there, it had been kind of fun to be its target. </p><p>“Alright, I guess I’m not invited to <em>this</em> party.” Agatha added with a shrug, Carol barely even looking at her, which she was so not used to. “See you later, happy family!” And she left.</p><p>Left the room, definitely not the area. As soon as she was out, door not even fully closed behind her, the screaming started. And what if she leaned against the wall and heard something? Not her fault they were being loud.</p><p>Which was all great, except Billy had had the same idea.</p><p><em>“We keep giving you everything, and this is how you repay us?! How could you–” </em>Carol was the one to start the match.</p><p>“Teen, are you eavesdropping?” Agatha whispered, feigning bewilderment.</p><p><em>“¡Mamá, no empieces, no tienes ni idea de lo que pasó!”</em> Oh, hell, Rio spoke Spanish. Slurred Spanish right now, but Spanish nonetheless. Why was Agatha only finding out now? </p><p>“No, I–” Billy started, “Wait, that lady is her <em>mom</em>?” Agatha just glared at him, and he looked around like the walls could give him the answers he was scrambling for, “No, uh, I was just…”</p><p><em>“I know exactly what happened! You’re lucky this guy is not planning to press charges–” </em>Carol again. </p><p>“No, uh, I was just…” Agatha mockingly repeated, “Go away!” She scream-whispered, pointing to the stairwell.</p><p><em>“Yeah, because he hit me first! No hice nada–”</em></p><p><em>“That doesn’t matter! You can’t do it! You promised you’d never do this again, after the–”</em></p><p>Billy had the nerve to hesitate, pivoting on one foot as he changed his mind mid-way. “Wait, are you staying?”</p><p>“Yes I’m staying, because I can do whatever I want and you can’t!”</p><p><em>“I never promised </em>you<em>. This guy was fucking aggressive, que se supone que haga, ¿mirar y ya, cómo hacen papá y tú? ¡Lo de Maya fue totalmente distinto, pero al menos yo hice algo!” </em></p><p>Okay, now Agatha wished she’d taken Spanish in high school. Damn it. At least Billy was finally leaving, though his walk was not as beat as it should have been. <em>Ugh</em>, his optimism was unshakable. May be why Agatha kinda respected him, but she’d never let him know. He was annoying enough already.</p><p><em>“How many times do I have to tell you? No Spanish!” </em>Thanks, Carol. For once, they agreed on something.</p><p><em>“No me jodas, todo el mundo sabe que lo entiendes, no sé cómo papá pueda aceptar que lo discrimines así…”</em></p><p>There was a pause, then Carol’s voice, a little quieter. Agatha got closer, ears trained to the sounds.<em> “Rio, we’re doing our best. About Maya.”</em> And who the hell was Maya?</p><p><em>“Yeah? How come the asshole is still roaming free?”</em></p><p><em>“Don’t ask stupid questions. He ended up in the ER because of </em>you<em>; that obviously made our claims weaker.”</em></p><p><em>“He already was in the ER. With her. Se te olvida ese pequeño detalle…”</em></p><p><em>“Yes, and he now claims he’s innocent, that you’re the abusive one, that you stalked and harassed him </em>and<em> her.”</em></p><p><em>“Please, that’s ridiculous. She’d never confirm that, it would never hold…”</em></p><p><em>“Your father and I wouldn’t let it. But this is a men’s world, and we can’t risk it. So stop acting like a fool, we don’t need another scandal on our hands, and I didn’t raise you to waste your life over a bunch of insignificant guys.”</em></p><p>A pause again, and Agatha could all but imagine Rio crossing her arms. A wandering patient passed by, shooting her a questioning look; Agatha shooed him away.</p><p><em>“... If you’d raised me, maybe I wouldn’t care about anyone. Just like you.”</em></p><p>Ouch. That must sting. If Nicky ever told her something like that… <br/>
For a moment, Agatha wondered if Carol had ever felt the guilt of being a parent with a demanding job.</p><p>But Carol didn’t skip a beat. <em>“If I didn’t care, I wouldn’t be here.” </em>Her tone was sterner than the words required. <em>“And everything we’re doing for Maya–”</em></p><p><em>“...Is not enough,” </em>Rio cut her off. <em>“You only care about appearances. If you didn’t, Maya’s abuser would be in jail.”</em></p><p>Rio’s voice was so cold, so unforgiving, a chill went down Agatha’s spine. Being on the receiving end of that, maybe even Agatha would take a hit. <br/>
And that Maya… if Carol was involved, she must be a family member. Most likely conclusion, right? But what if she wasn’t? What if she were someone Rio had loved, so much so that she’d turned into family business? <br/>
Unlikely. Probably just family. <br/>
Still, what if she were someone Rio <em>still</em> loved?</p><p>It was none of Agatha’s business, and she didn’t care. Shouldn’t care. The punch in the gut she felt at the idea had nothing to do with <em>anything</em>.</p><p>And yet, as Rio’s steps sounded towards the door, all Agatha could think about was finding out.</p><p>***</p><p>Rio slammed the door closed behind her and strode to the stairs–a stride she only slowed to look back at Agatha for a moment. Her eyes were dark, eyebrows barely scrunched in the middle, and Agatha wondered if any of it was for her, for eavesdropping.</p><p>But then, before turning away, Rio made an almost imperceptible nod towards the staircase. <br/>
Had she imagined it?</p><p>Her phone chose that specific moment to chime. <em>Darcy.</em> She looked between the screen and the stairs, and—Darcy could wait five minutes longer.<br/>
She went after Rio.</p><p>***</p><p>Rio had already gone down a couple of stair flights when she walked into the stairwell; she was now standing in a corner at a landing, full body slumping against it. <em>Weirdo</em>.</p><p>Agatha leaned out over the railing. “Are you okay, serial puncher?”</p><p>That elicited a grunt, and Rio left her time-out to point a finger all the way up at her. “Not funny,” she said threateningly. And without much of a pause, as Agatha walked down to her: “My lip hurts, my hand is throbbing, my mother treats me like a teenager, and maybe I even deserve it!” </p><p>Agatha stopped one step above her. She wanted to <em>ask</em>, but Rio kept going: “My parents are ridiculous, they say they’re doing their best, but this can’t be it! I <em>know</em> my mother’s giving the family name” she made air quotes at that, “priority. Over her own daughter! Who the fuck cares about family reputation over the actual family? I—“ She paused, fingers ghosting over her lower lip before moaning in complaint again. The adrenaline must have worn off, and she was finally hurting fully. </p><p>Agatha pulled her hand away. “Don’t touch it. And as much as it pains me to say this when you’re finally spilling your secrets, don’t talk too much. You’re going to ruin my suture.”</p><p>Rio went on frowning up at her, then seemingly ignored her: “How much did you hear?”</p><p>“Everything.” She held her stare. No regrets. </p><p>And Rio… Rio fucking smiled. What the hell was wrong with her? Freak. Whatever it was, Agatha <em>liked</em> it.</p><p>“What are you smiling at?” <em>And who’s Maya?</em></p><p>“I can finally tell you everything.” </p><p><em>Oh.</em> She wanted her to know. Why? “Great, ‘cause I have a lot of questions,” she settled for. And she needed to know. First question: who the hell was Maya? But Rio might find it suspicious. Agatha might look like she cared. She might look… jealous, even. Which she obviously wasn’t.</p><p>So she missed her opportunity: Rio’s beeper, now on her beltline, went off.</p><p>“Fuck, I have to go,” Rio muttered as she checked the code. “They want me in the OR, and I can’t even…” she raised her bandaged hand and waved it around, groaning.</p><p>Agatha condescendingly patted her cheek. “You’ll be fine by Monday. Just put a thin layer of bandage on before you glove up.” </p><p>Rio nodded, still frowning—but for some reason, she didn’t leave right away. She looked down, standing still, bruised hand moving to touch her lower lip <em>again</em>.</p><p>Now, Agatha wasn’t one for prying things out of people. They already talked too much without her actively asking. But something in Rio’s demeanor told her there was more she wanted to say.<br/>
When Rio looked up, eyes shifting between hers, Agatha did it.</p><p>“What is it?” She asked.</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment. “What if my mother’s right? I fucked up. What if it <em>is</em> my fault, Maya’s abuser roaming free? I don’t want her to get hurt again because of me. I…” </p><p>And shit, Agatha was in no position to answer that. She had zero knowledge about the facts, just really fucking wanted to know about <em>Maya</em>, and as a rule, she never sweetened the pill.</p><p>But one thing, she knew: it was Rio. She was annoying, weird, sometimes a huge idiot. And she was thoughtful, loyal, <em>protective</em>, she’d recently found out.<br/>
And the guilt on Rio’s stupidly beautiful face was clawing at her chest.</p><p>Before she could rein in her instincts, Agatha cupped her cheek. Rio’s head immediately tilted towards her fingers, brows furrowing slightly, and Agatha’s thumb couldn’t help but slowly draw the line of her cheekbone. </p><p>“I don’t know what happened,” she spoke quietly, “but I’m sure it’s not black and white. It can’t all be your fault.” </p><p>Rio’s arms crossed below her chest, and Agatha felt compelled to do more. She couldn’t blatantly lie to make her feel better, but…</p><p>“If you want to tell me about it, <em>when</em> you can talk again without messing up my art,” Rio huffed out a small chuckle—<em>good</em>, “I’ll listen.” </p><p>Her tone was so gentle. So kind. <em>Ugh</em>. That didn’t sound like her at all. What the hell was happening to her? Was she getting… <em>soft</em>?</p><p>But Rio nodded against her palm, wide eyes under scrunched eyebrows looking up at her like she held the world, and wasn’t that worth being a little soft?</p><p><em>Eww. </em>Disgusting<em>. </em>She was going to throw up ten times, then pack her shit up and move to the other side of the world.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio said, almost a whisper.</p><p>Desperately needing to shift the mood, Agatha patted her cheek. “Now, I know you really love the sound of your voice, but give it a rest for—”</p><p>“I love the sound of <em>your</em> voice!“ Rio cut in, and then she startled. And–yeah, <em>what? </em>“Wait, no, I mean—<em>you </em>love the sound of <em>your</em> voice!” Ah, now it made sense. She surely couldn’t have meant the first one.</p><p>“Who wouldn’t?” She shrugged. “Give it a rest for a day or two, your lip is swelling,” she finally ended her previous sentence.</p><p>Rio silently rolled her eyes. Good girl, she learnt fast.</p><p>“Go get your heart broken in the OR now, <em>Roberta</em>.” And wiggling her fingers at her, basking in Rio’s groan and not one, but <em>two</em> raised middle fingers, Agatha watched her leave.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>***</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t see Rio around for the next few hours, taken as she was by patients and interviewing and <em>everyone</em> apparently needing something from her, but at least she managed to get a hold of Wanda. Maybe she couldn’t find out who Maya was and why Rio went around hitting guys for someone other than her, <em>eh</em>. For now, she might be able to find out how much Wanda suspected. </p><p>So much digging to do, <em>ugh</em>. The day was feeling more like a month.</p><p>When she got her, Wanda was just getting out of surgery. As Agatha walked by after checking on Jen’s OR for a consult, she saw Wanda rip off her surgical gown and throw it to the closest bin, and she didn’t waste the chance. </p><p>“Hi-ya, neighbor! A word?” </p><p>Wanda looked surprised, but she let Agatha’s hand on her back push her outside.</p><p>***</p><p>“You have an insane meal schedule.” Wanda checked her phone; Agatha knew it was around 5 pm. “Is this lunch?”</p><p>Agatha hummed. “I was having so much fun today, I forgot to eat until I started shaking. Look,” she held a hand out, Wanda inspecting it in what looked like genuine interest. “But let’s talk about you, sugar bums! You’re back so fast, almost didn’t give us time to miss you.” So she was taking the digging slow. Whatever.</p><p>Wanda shrugged. “I love the twins, but all they do right now is sleep, eat, and poop, and as adorable as they are, Vi can take care of that for a while.”</p><p>“Damn right, you’re nine months ahead already.” She took a huge bite off her sandwich, and Wanda smiled for a moment, shifting down and laying her head back against the bench. </p><p>“You’ll get sunburnt, ginger.” </p><p>“Look who’s talking. You’re paler than I.”</p><p>“You wish. You look dead.”</p><p>“Geez, thanks.” </p><p>A pause, giving Agatha time to mull over her thoughts. How to go about the… Rio issue? Maybe Wanda didn’t know, maybe Vision was so chaste <em>he</em> didn’t even know. She’d never heard him make a sex joke in her life. Well, he’d had sex at least once, right? They’d made literal babies. Vision must know sex existed…</p><p>“I wonder if they’re ok,” Wanda said, keeping her eyes closed, sunlight highlighting the freckles on her cheekbones.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Tommy and Billy.”</p><p>“Ah, right.”</p><p>“They’re fine.” Her face twisted a little. “They’re fine, right, Agatha?” She opened one eye to look at her sideways.</p><p>“Hmm, Vision must be the number one safest person to leave babies with in the world. He’s the reason why I was never worried about leaving Nicky with you.” Sappy. She had to fix it, “<em>So</em> lame, by the way.”</p><p>Wanda feigned shock. “I thought you trusted <em>me</em>!” She pulled out her phone, rapidly texted Vision about the twins. And then, out of the blue: “So, you and Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart leaped. <em>Fuck</em>, direct. Wanda had always been decently good at reading her intentions; thank Jesus, she wasn’t one to beat around the bush. Saved everyone time.</p><p>“What about her?” Agatha wasn’t one to risk giving herself away, though. Not saving anyone time.</p><p>“Are you sleeping with her?”</p><p>Great, great. Cool. No reason to panic. Totally cool–</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“You aren’t?” Wanda looked surprised. Amazing, incredible, not at all disappointing: crisis averted. But then: “I’m kidding, yes you are.”</p><p>“No I’m not.”</p><p>“Yes, you are.”</p><p>“<em>No</em>, I’m not–”</p><p>Wanda laughed, painfully poking an elbow at her ribcage. “Stop it, you can’t hide this from me. You’re hitting that.” She looked away, tilting her head, “Maybe she’s hitting you?”</p><p>“No way, she’s not.” Except maybe she was. Alright, time for panicking: “Wanda, I swear on my mother’s grave, if you tell anyone, I’ll have Evanora haunt your kids for all eternity—” </p><p>“Your mother’s alive.”</p><p>“Just getting ahead, I can’t wait.” She shrugged.</p><p>Wanda simply hummed, hands intertwining over her stomach, still basking in the sun like a dumb otter or something. Silent. Torturing her. Not saying anything at all…</p><p>“Alright, alright, I’ll tell you everything, okay?!”</p><p>The redhead chuckled, opened her eyes and sat up, and Agatha had to swallow a pretty big chunk of sandwich before she could keep going.</p><p>“We’re sleeping together.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You’re the only person I’ve ever told, cut me some slack.” Maybe she was even a little excited about sharing<em>.<br/>
</em>Scratch that, no she wasn’t.</p><p>“You didn’t even choose to tell me…”</p><p>“Technicalities.” She waved a hand, “Here goes: no relationship stuff, it’s just sex, it’s fun, a lot of cardio, like, <em>a lot</em>—”</p><p>“I don’t need to know the details,” Wanda pointed out, but she was smiling.</p><p>“I said I’ll tell you everything, okay? So, a <em>lot</em>. Like a bunch of times a day cardio, and a bunch at night, and sometimes–”</p><p>“Now I know you’re lying, you don’t have all that free time. You’re always here…”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes through a smirk. She <em>was</em> exaggerating it for funsies, but, “Where do you think all that is happening?”</p><p>“Nooo, you’re doing it in the hospital? <em>Agatha…</em>” Wanda’s scolding tone was just going to rile her up. She should have known.</p><p>“Of course we are. We’re even making a list–”</p><p>“‘We’re making a list’ is not a good way to start a sentence about someone you don’t have a relationship with.”</p><p>Ugh, what did Wanda know? “<em>We’re making a list</em> of hospital spots to cross out…” </p><p>“You guys are... Whose idea was it?”</p><p>“Hmm, I have to humbly admit it wasn’t mine.” </p><p>Wanda looked at her in shock, but it was completely ruined by the smile that came through. “Just don’t do it in my department, okay? You guys are insane.”</p><p>“Sure, sure. Of course.” Well, <em>now</em> they had to do it in her department.</p><p>Wanda huffed out a chuckle. Then, “Are you sure it’s just sex? She punched a guy for you just today.”</p><p>Of course she’d ask that. <em>Yes</em>, she was sure. Rio apparently went around punching people for anyone, didn’t she? But Agatha couldn’t tell Wanda that; apparently she had some loyalty to <em>stupid</em> Vidal. And it wasn’t something she wanted to dwell on. ‘Cause what if Maya… <em>No</em>, stop it.</p><p>She shrugged. “I’m sure. Maybe we’re <em>almost</em> friends; she’d punch a guy for a friend. The woman is cray-cray.” Her eyes widened as she tapped a finger to her temple.</p><p>“And you aren’t? She matches your freak. That’s why I thought you might have something… <em>more,</em> together. I’ve never seen you fall in love, people get intimidated by you too easily. But Vidal... I think she could challenge you.”</p><p>She challenged her in bed, that was for sure. Challenged and lost. The rest, Agatha didn’t care about at all.<br/>
“Okay, first of all, <em>ugh</em>, I’m <em>not</em> falling in love with that psycho nerd. I don’t do, eww, <em>love</em>. Second, remember I have a son? And do you remember when you’d just popped <em>your</em> sons out, what did Rio say?” She didn’t give Wanda time to answer: rhetorical questions. “Third, she’s not the relationship type. Trust me, she’s too…”</p><p>“Fickle?”</p><p>Oh, so that was what Wanda thought of Rio. Not what Agatha had been about to say. “...Yeah.”</p><p>“I guess you know her better than I,” Wanda shrugged, “other than biblically.” Agatha hummed appreciatively at her joke. “You are aware, though, that she looks at you constantly?”</p><p>She was aware. Very aware. Wished other people wouldn’t notice. “I fail to see the point.”</p><p>“People pay you that much attention when they're into you.”</p><p>“She's into me enough. <em>Biblically</em>. Besides, take Kaplan: he looks at me, definitely doesn’t like me that way.” The simple thought made her feel like gagging.</p><p>Wanda hummed. “For the biggest ego I’ve seen, you’re really bad at admitting someone might <em>like</em> like you.”</p><p>“I’m not, because she doesn’t. She’s just playing around, as am I.” Agatha was going to die on that hill. That little voice in the back of her head that told her otherwise needed to be smothered to death.</p><p>“Oh. Well, that’s too bad. It would have been nice to see you fall in love, for once.” </p><p>And just like that, Wanda let it go. Just one of the <em>many</em> reasons she wasn’t as annoying as Jen. <br/>
But something was off…</p><p>“I’m good. There’s enough drama in my life as is.”</p><p>Wanda hummed, giving a quiet nod. Yet, something in her demeanor kept bugging Agatha…</p><p>And there it was: Carrot Head was not looking at her. <em>She was not being sincere</em>. She didn’t believe her, did she?<br/>
And why the <em>hell</em> would Wanda not believe her?<br/>
The voice in the back of her mind said Wanda was right.</p><p>The voice was stupid.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>***</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>She had to survive through surgery next, only scrubbing in for the fun part: microsurgery on a torn tendon in a guy’s forearm. His wife had thrown a lamp at him, and they’d had to remove glass fragments for almost an hour; thank all the gods, fifth-year residents existed to take care of that part, and the opening and closing, because Agatha was just about to pass out.</p><p>All went well, and she was about to <em>finally</em> be done and leave, when Jen entered the OR.<br/>
Up to that, it was fine. Hi Agatha, hi Jen, sarcastic remarks, bla, bla. But then Jen had to go and ask about the band-aid on her neck. </p><p>Fine. She could lie about the band-aid. All good. </p><p><em>Then</em>, as Agatha was trapped at the microscope, Jen had to go and <em>lift</em> the band-aid off her neck. And who the hell did that?</p><p>“It looks like a hickey,” Jen fucking said in the middle of the OR, putting the band-aid back.</p><p>“Your left eye will look like a hickey if you don’t leave right now,” Agatha very kindly offered.</p><p>She didn’t even have the energy to care what everyone else thought.</p><p>She sat on a bench in the changing rooms after that, tiredly taking off her surgical cap and letting her hair rain down her shoulders. If she didn’t go home soon, she was going to die right there, and they could turn her body into a nice hospital plant or something. <br/>
Burying her face in her hands as her elbows dug into her knees, she sighed.</p><p>Someone walked in. Agatha had no will to look up. </p><p>That someone walked up to her. Green clogs, green scrubs, white socks… Not just any white socks. She knew those socks.</p><p>A hand moved some locks of hair behind Agatha’s ear, and she didn’t hate it. </p><p>“Bitch-socks, I’ve missed you.”</p><p>“Oh. Thanks.” Rio’s feet looked tentative. Could feet look tentative? Well, they did.</p><p>“Not you, I literally missed the socks.” Her voice lacked its usual bite. What the fuck of an answer was “thanks”, if Rio thought… Yeah, Rio didn’t <em>like</em> like her. </p><p>The resident gave a small chuckle. Cute. <em>Do it again.</em></p><p>“Come with me,” Rio said, and Agatha took a second before finally looking up. “I’ll take you home.”</p><p>And she didn’t <em>need</em> her to, but she wanted to go. She really, really wanted to get home, cuddle up with Nicky on the sofa, accidentally fall asleep… </p><p>Rio offered her a hand, and for a second, as she stood up, Agatha dared to take it.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Slumped against the car seat, Agatha watched Rio’s side profile in the honey-tinted evening light. She only allowed herself to look for a moment, the warmth of Rio’s gesture sitting uncomfortably in her stomach. So unfamiliar, she wasn’t sure whether it felt scary or… </p><p>Well, Rio had no business making her feel that way. So, in exchange for her act of compassion, she got several minutes of Agatha tiredly teasing her about her middle name. There were so many “R”s in there, how could she not point it out? </p><p>Very disappointingly, Rio just gestured for her to get her wallet out of her pocket, proving the name wasn’t on her ID. Just a catholic confirmation name her nana had forced her to take, and given that she was not a believer, her sole religious devotion gone into making out with girls in Catholic school, Agatha technically had no business using the name.</p><p>Which obviously wouldn’t stop her.</p><p>By the time they made it to her place, both Rio and she had forgotten she wasn’t supposed to talk too much, and Rio was repeatedly trying not to laugh too hard, pressing her lips together to save the stitches.</p><p>When Rio finally parked the car, Agatha stayed slumped in her seat for a moment, so tired she didn’t feel like getting up. Was she supposed to thank Rio for driving her home? Sappy. Weird. No.</p><p>So she settled for: “I called you an Uber.”</p><p>Rio unbuckled her belt and pouted. “You’re not inviting me upstairs?”</p><p>On any other day, the pout would have worked. Agatha would have folded so fast, she wouldn’t even have realized until she had Rio in her bed. </p><p>Today, though… ”No way, you’re not getting within a hundred meters of my apartment. You’re not allowed to have any of this,” and she waved her left index finger at herself.</p><p>“I know, just kidding,” Rio said quietly. “Wait, don’t move, this is super important—” And under Agatha’s confused stare, she got out of the car, rapidly circled it, and opened the opposite door.</p><p>Agatha stepped out and took the keys from her, Rio making a theatrical bow. </p><p>“You’re an idiot,” she said, but Rio just grinned wider, and Agatha couldn’t help her own lips from curling up.</p>

<p><span>The next day, Agatha woke up kinda annoyed. Because she’d dreamt of Rio </span><em><span>again</span></em><span>, as she hadn’t in a while, but this time, Rio had simply kissed her. Stupid Vidal had kissed her and she’d melted in her arms, and when she’d woken up in the middle of the night, her heart had been hammering in her chest. It had felt so real, like the very first time they’d kissed. It made </span><em><span>zero</span></em><span> sense. They’d fucked like bunnies over the past weeks, they’d definitely made out so much that there was no reason for Agatha to dream of </span><em><span>that</span></em><span>. Eww. She needed to get a fucking grip. </span></p><p><span>Getting some distance back: that was what she needed. The sex ban had seemed like a terrible idea at first, when the words had slipped her–but it might play in her favor. Maybe getting used to Rio hadn’t been the most functional way to kill the crush. And well, she was Agatha fucking Harkness: she could do it. She’d make it out of the sex ban alive, looking as self-possessed as ever. She just needed a plan to survive the night at Rio’s… and she knew just how.</span></p><p><span>But first, she had to finally give Carol Walsh the meeting she’d been asking for, which was why she was currently, very much against her will, entering the designated meeting room.</span></p><p><span>Carol was on the phone when she got in without knocking. She never knocked with her, just to throw her off her feet a little. When Agatha gingerly sat down at an angle across from her, the Fox’s face twisted almost imperceptibly—Agatha had totally gotten to her—and she told whoever was on the phone that she’d call right back.</span></p><p><span>Good. That meant whatever this was wouldn’t be long.</span></p><p><span>“I’m glad you finally made it, Agatha,” Carol said with a cold smile. What she meant was: “no one has me waiting”, and for once, Agatha didn’t have to fake her cheerfulness:</span></p><p><span>“Of course.” She leaned back in her chair, elbows wide over the armrests. “What can I do for you?”</span></p><p><span>“Since I was in town, I thought of giving you some news in person.” She clasped her hands over the table, Agatha’s mind trying to anticipate her next words. The plastics chief was still months from retiring, couldn’t be that. Was she in trouble? Oh, bad news regarding her mother? </span><em><span>She wished—</span></em><span>“You’re getting an ASA medallion for surgical care advancement.”</span></p><p><span>Carol said that in a tone so casual, Agatha just stared at her for a couple of seconds before taking it in.</span></p><p><span>“What?!” was all she managed to answer, very casual herself. She would </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> smile like she cared, and so she frowned.</span></p><p><span>“You heard me. The ASPS nominated you.” Carol’s icy eyes didn’t waver.</span></p><p><span>“How would you know?” She wasn’t on the committe… and why the rush to tell her? Was it just a matter of ego, to swing her dick around about her connections? No, Carol wasn’t like that. She had her degree of vanity, sure, but she wouldn’t let it become a waste of her time.</span></p><p><span>“I have it on very good authority. Now, this is going to be good for the hospital—” </span><em><span>oh</span></em><span>, it was going to be fucking </span><em><span>great</span></em><span>. It would attract the best surgeons in the country to work there, and the wealthiest patients with them. “—So I need to ask: is there anything I should know that could jeopardize it?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed in thought. Fuck, what the hell was she even talking about? Did she know anything? Did she know about Rio? </span></p><p><span>“Nothing at all,” she said, as composed as possible.</span></p><p><span>Carol cocked her head ever so slightly. So fucking creepy to see it on her after getting used to Rio, still. “Anything about your most recent studies?”</span></p><p><span>Ah, great. She could breathe again: it wasn’t about Rio. Carol was just talking about Mrs. Doona, wasn’t she? “No one means to sue me or the hospital, if that’s what you’re asking.”</span></p><p><span>“Good.” Carol’s right index finger tapped the back of her left hand a couple of times, one of the rare involuntary gestures she hadn’t managed to get rid of. “I trust you’ll get everything else in order. After all, you’re the one who would benefit from this the most.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha unblinkingly stared back. Fuck, she needed to tell Nicky. He wouldn’t understand, but… oh, she needed to tell </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>. No, that was a stupid idea. She needed to keep it to herself until it actually happened, as she always did.</span></p><p><span>“Of course,” she cut through her own thoughts. “Is that all?” </span></p><p><span>“That’s all,” Carol replied, but she didn’t move, and her index finger kept tapping.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stood up. If Carol needed more as the tapping was giving away, threatening to leave would pressure her to spill it. “Thank you,” she said, and turned away…</span></p><p><span>“Wait—” Carol stopped her, like clockwork.</span></p><p><span>Agatha had to school back the smirk from her face before turning around. “Yes?” Her voice held a little too much mirth. </span><em><span>Oops</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>The Fox looked different than usual, cold eyes slightly narrowed, brows mildly furrowed in a way that didn’t look like anger. She’d never seen that on her. Was it… worry? </span></p><p><span>What she said next was the most surprising thing that had ever left her mouth. </span></p><p><span>“Is my daughter doing well?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyebrows shot up. Hands dipped in the pockets of her whitecoat, she shrugged. “I think she is.” And ffuuuuck, strike one. “I mean, we’re not close. Why are you asking me?” She should have led with that.</span></p><p><span>Carol also left her seat, standing tall in front of her. “You were involved in the… </span><em><span>incident,</span></em><span> yesterday.” </span></p><p><span>Oh, they weren’t acting like that had never happened? </span></p><p><span>Carol’s chin tipped up before she carried on: “And I hold your people-reading skills in high regard. You have that </span><em><span>something</span></em><span>… just like me.”</span></p><p><span>She wanted to throw up. “I think you’re mixing up people-reading and manipulation,” she replied bitterly.</span></p><p><span>Carol didn’t even blink. “The two go hand in hand.” And shit, she wasn’t even wrong. Except, if you asked a good person, they’d disagree. Well, Agatha wasn’t good, no news there; but that didn’t mean she liked to be compared to Carol fucking Walsh. The next step would be a comparison to her own mother, and that… she’d do worse than throw up.</span></p><p><span>Carol stared at her for a moment before opening the door for her. “See you soon, Agatha,” she said curtly. And before she actually left, “Make sure everything about your latest clinical studies is airtight.”</span></p><p><span>And Agatha’s mind was so caught in swirling thoughts, she almost didn’t hear her. She was several feet away, Carol’s door closed behind her, when she processed it and realised: </span><em><span>the Fox really cared about this.</span></em><span> She could use her to get Sharon’s surgery, too.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span>Rio paced the living room. Everything looked fine. Alice was out with her girlfriend, the too many pillows she’d brought over since she’d started dating Doctor Kale stacked neatly enough on the couch. She’d restocked coffee, there was likely some food around, beer in the fridge–shit, beer? What if Agatha didn’t drink that?</span></p><p><span>No, it would be fine. Just Agatha coming over to talk work. No biggie. They’d spent so much time together lately, there was literally no reason to worry.</span></p><p><span>She checked her clothes, just shorts and a tank top that said “Fuck me like the government”, and-too much? It might be too much. </span></p><p><span>She ran upstairs, threw the tank top over her bed–</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Ding-dong!</span></em></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Shit, the doorbell. </span></em><span>Okay. She rummaged through her tees, grabbing a black one at random, messily slid it over her head as she ran back down the stairs.</span></p><p><span>“Hey!” She shot as she opened the door–</span></p><p><span>“Hello,” Lilia pushed past her. “Nice front yard.”</span></p><p><span>Wait, Lilia? What?</span></p><p><span>Rio stood silent, staring at her back like a dummy, hand still clutching the doorknob.</span></p><p><span>“Hi, daddy.” </span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span>. Rio’s head spun back to see her walk in from the porch. </span><em><span>Daddy?</span></em><span> What–</span></p><p><span>“Okay, don’t faint on me.” Was she blushing that hard? “Your tee,” Agatha pointed at her chest.</span></p><p><span>She looked down. </span><em><span>Oh.</span></em><span> She’d picked the “She/Her/Daddy” tee. </span></p><p><span>“Right, I know. I’ve just been running, I was upstairs…” </span><em><span>Great</span></em><span>, cause that made her blushing sound less pathetic. Well, whatever. She pointed a thumb behind herself and tried to muster a grin, ”Do you need me to invite you in like a vampire?”</span></p><p><span>“I </span><em><span>am</span></em><span> a vampire.” Agatha flashed one of her performative smiles, and Rio’s guts twisted. “Got my invitation last time I was here.” She shrugged, pointed at Lilia, “Thought she could help.” And she stepped past Rio.</span></p><p><span>Rio absentmindedly closed the door. Lilia was nice, sure, cool lady, but–why had Agatha felt the need to bring her into this? No way she really thought they needed the extra help.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“…had to be sedated and intubated, but he wanted to see his sister before that, because there was no guarantee he’d wake, the metastases were… well. Huge tumor burden. So they called me, because the chief has a magic wand that’ll fix anything.” Lilia didn’t pause when Rio dropped a bunch of snacks on the coffee table in front of her. “And I had to go and tell this guy he had to choose between seeing his sister one last time and then dying, or letting us intubate him and possibly dying anyway, without seeing her one last time–” She pulled back the bell sleeves of her multi-colored blouse, “And that’s why I skipped dinner.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha hummed. “Fun,” she deadpanned. “What did he go for?”</span></p><p><span>“Intubation. His sister got there just ten minutes too late.”</span></p><p><span>“Rough.” Rio stood on the sides of her feet, watching Lilia gingerly pick a protein bar from the bunch of snacks she’d dropped on the coffee table. No crying over the shitty day then, she guessed. “Sorry, we forgot to order our groceries,” she added.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t think anyone expects a resident to have real food in the house.” Agatha. She ignored the snacks, just went for a beer.</span></p><p><span>“You have your groceries delivered?” Lilia asked before biting into one of Alice’s favourite bars.</span></p><p><span>“You don’t? Internal med has some of the longest shifts on the planet.” Agatha again. She was sitting on the couch, Lilia in an armchair to her right. It would look completely normal if Rio sat next to Agatha, right? </span></p><p><span>Right.</span></p><p><span>She did just that, grabbing a beer and snapping it open before falling against the backrest, leaving what felt like a humanly acceptable space between Agatha and her. Way too much space.</span></p><p><span>Lilia waved her protein bar at them. “I go to the store like a normal human being. Helps me keep in touch with the real world…” She looked around—at what exactly, Rio couldn’t tell. Funny lady. “Turns out there’s life outside the hospital.” Her tone was sarcastic, but she looked amused with herself.</span></p><p><span>Agatha chuckled, catching Rio’s attention. </span><em><span>Pretty</span></em><span>. <br/>
</span><span>She took a sip of her beer.</span></p><p><span>“Where’s this from? Never had it before.” Agatha studied the bottle, a Dos Equis. Rio’s favorite.</span></p><p><span>“It’s Mexican. It’s the first I ever had, my old nanny bought it for me.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay, either you needed a nanny late in your teens, or she was feeding a child alcohol. Neither looks good.” Agatha smiled, raising her eyebrows at her.</span></p><p><span>“No, it’s not like that. I was seven and we were stranded in the desert,” she looked up, pretending to be digging up old memories, “Two days in, we had nothing to drink but these beers. My nanny said to me, she said: ‘child, there comes a time when one must make difficult choices…’” </span></p><p><span>“Is she making this up?” Lilia interrupted, eyes shifting to Agatha.</span></p><p><span>“Definitely.” Agatha didn’t even have to look at Rio to guess. </span><em><span>Too bad,</span></em><span> ‘cause Rio really wanted Agatha to look at her.</span></p><p><span>She shrugged. “I used to visit my nanny most weekends all through high school.”</span></p><p><span>“Hmm.” Lilia studied her for a moment, then– “You should let me read your tarot sometimes.”</span></p><p><span>“Lilia, </span><em><span>no.</span></em><span>” Agatha rolled her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“Lilia, </span><em><span>yes</span></em><span>.” Rio nodded. It sounded fun.</span></p><p><span>“Good choice, doll.” </span></p><p><span>“Doll?” Agatha looked at her in dismay, “you call </span><em><span>me</span></em><span> doll!” </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, don’t be a baby.” Lilia deadpanned, examining a particularly ugly pillow.</span></p><p><span>“But she–” Rio started,</span></p><p><span>“Don’t say it.” Agatha pointed a menacing finger at her,</span></p><p><span>“What?” She shrugged, eyes widening.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t say ‘but she </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> a baby’,” Agatha parroted in a high-pitched voice.</span></p><p><span>Rio smirked. Served on a silver plate. “Not my intention. To me, you can be a baby all you want.”</span></p><p><span>It was Agatha’s turn to blush–probably out of rage. She muttered something that ended with “So stupid” as she rolled her eyes and plopped back against the sofa, arms crossed over her chest. “Don’t steal my friends,” And her light blue eyes narrowed menacingly at Rio. </span></p><p><span>Maybe someday she’d be that possessive of Rio. One could dream.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sneaked a glance at Lilia then, eyebrows slightly knitted together—and a lightbulb went off in Rio’s mind.</span></p><p><em><span>She’d brought Lilia as a buffer.</span></em><span> </span></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><span>So, taking Lilia with her? Best idea ever on the cockblocking front. Agatha felt no pull whatsoever to climb into Rio’s lap and take her stupid tee off. But on the working front? Lilia and Rio were both useless </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> ganging up on her, and she didn’t enjoy it one bit. After listing indigent care, sponsors, and everything she’d already thought of, they circled back to the very beginning.</span></p><p><span>“She’s part of a board-approved study, right? Just get them to pay for the surgery, doesn’t the foundation sponsor this research?” Lilia very helpfully offered.</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Yes</span></em><span>, thank you, why hadn’t I thought of this before?” Agatha tapped her forehead, “They’re already covering for too many; some of the patients were out of budget.”</span></p><p><span>Completely unaffected by her sarcasm, Lilia kept munching on another protein bar. “How much do you want this? You can always offer to do some surgeries pro bono. Cover the expenses that way.”</span></p><p><span>Rio hummed. </span></p><p><span>“Sure, but I can’t fix everything like that. It’s my job, I’m not a charity project. If I did more than one pro bono for every patient whose insurance fell through, I’d have no income.”</span></p><p><span>“Just do it once in a while,” Rio commented with a shrug, and Agatha frowned at her.</span></p><p><span>“Of course you’d say that, board member.” Agatha glowered at her, getting a laugh out of Lilia. “I already do it once in a while, you should know.”</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>You</span></em><span> should know how much I hate the money-making machine Carol is heading.” She looked a little hurt. “Don’t call me a board member. I was forced to take the job, after…” </span></p><p><em><span>After the Maya issue</span></em><span>. She trailed off, and Agatha came to the rescue, cutting Lilia’s forming question with: “Fine.” And she knew she probably didn’t need to do anything pro bono, not with Carol caring about her clinical studies so much, these days. But Rio seemed to like it when she was generous… “But we’re only offering pro bono as a last resort.” </span></p><p><span>Lilia clapped her hands together. “Great. Now that that’s settled…”</span></p><p><span>“Nothing’s settled!” Agatha protested, “I want to know your secret ways to get money out of the board…”</span></p><p><span>“It’s a political game, you were born for that stuff. You’ll do fine.” She waved a hand to dismiss her, getting a muttering complaint out of her, “Now, Agatha told me you also wanted help with managing some chiefs,” she told Rio. “</span><em><span>Their</span></em><span> secrets, I know like my own pockets.” Like what? Must be another of her italian sayings.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, yeah! Wait–” Rio sprinted up from the couch to grab her laptop from the coffee table, “Let me check…” And she pulled up her meetings calendar. “Yeah, endocrino keeps asking for another ultrasound machine for their biopsies, which is totally out of budget right now…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio waited. Lilia was helpful, sure, but she felt pretty confident that wasn’t the reason Agatha had taken her with, and she’d prove it. So she waited.</span></p><p><span>She got her chance when Lilia left for a call. She waited for her to get out of the living room, heart starting to hammer in her chest, and set the laptop down on the coffee table. </span></p><p><span>And then she turned to Agatha.</span></p><p><span>And </span><em><span>oh, shit</span></em><span>. Rio had expected her to be looking away as she’d been stubbornly doing all night, but… she was staring. Light eyes softer than usual, she hardened and turned aside the moment she got caught. </span></p><p><span>A lopsided smile started taking over Rio’s face. She </span><em><span>totally</span></em><span> wanted her.</span></p><p><span>“Gotcha,” she said, immediately getting Agatha’s attention back. “I know what you’re doing.”<br/>
</span><span>And it may be a bad idea to confront her about it, but she couldn’t resist the temptation.</span></p><p><span>“No clue what you’re talking about. I’m not doing anything.” She tilted her head up defiantly and crossed her legs.</span></p><p><span>Rio shifted closer, propping a bandaged hand against the couch between their thighs. “You’re avoiding me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha scoffed, looking her up and down in a way that made her internally squirm. “I’m literally in your house right now.”</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Yes</span></em><span>, and you brought Lilia because you were too scared to be alone with me.” Rio’s heartbeat picked up when she leaned in and Agatha just inched closer. </span></p><p><span>“Uh, </span><em><span>please</span></em><span>, I’m not scared. That’s ridiculous.” If her throat hadn’t bobbed, if her eyes hadn’t shifted down for a moment before settling back on Rio’s, she might have believed her.</span><span><br/>
</span></p><p><span>And because Agatha wasn’t pulling away, fingers digging into her own thighs, Rio pushed further.</span></p><p><span>“You </span><em><span>are</span></em><span> scared. And why is that?” She played with a lock of Agatha’s hair over her chest. “Afraid I might kiss you? Get you to break your sex ban?” Agatha grabbed her wrist, stopping her movements, and in a flicker of mischief, Rio kept going: “</span><em><span>No.</span></em><span>” She smiled at Agatha’s fingers twitching around her forearm, “You’re afraid </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> might kiss me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha only stared intently for a moment, eyebrows gradually scrunching in the middle, and Rio’s stomach knotted at the possibility that she was wrong. Agatha had said time and again it was just sex, and Rio had tried to listen. And if it were just sex, as incredible as it was, it wouldn’t be so hard for Agatha to stay away. Not as hard as it was for Rio, anyway. Because as much as she tried not to get attached, as much as she tried not to have expectations that Agatha had made clear she wouldn’t fulfill, Rio was starting to see: she was sincerely fucking </span><em><span>gone</span></em><span>. </span></p><p><span>So, as Agatha frowned, a pathetic little shiver ran through Rio. But then Agatha’s whole demeanor changed, her body relaxed a touch and she smirked, and what was left of Rio’s poor grey matter melted, because the control she had over her body was unfairly hot. </span></p><p><span>Then, Agatha said: “</span><em><span>Honey</span></em><span>, if I wanted to kiss you, I would.”</span></p><p><span>Warmth spread all over. “Would you?” she asked in a low voice. Agatha’s eyes had grown darker, she had that wolfish smile on her face, and the way she tilted her face up—almost there… </span></p><p><span>But then she hesitated; she inched slightly back, smile fading, and Rio’s heart sank in her chest. </span></p><p><span>Never mind, then. Maybe she’d miscalculated. Maybe Agatha was just toying with her. Wasn’t that what she did? Deep down, she’d been so stupid to think Agatha might feel the same…</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” she whispered, still so close to her it hurt, and she pulled away. “I guess you don’t want to, I’m sorry.” </span></p><p><span>She turned away, and—</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand cupped her jaw, pulling her back.</span></p><p><span>“Even if I wanted to,” Her thumb flexed into Rio’s cheek, nail slightly digging in, “and even though I can definitely kiss you and stop there, because unlike <em>you</em>, I have some self-control…” Her voice trailed away as her eyes shifted to Rio’s lips, and if she didn’t get the </span><em><span>one </span></em><span>kiss, Rio would literally die—“It’s a terrible idea.”</span></p><p><span>“Sounds like a great idea to me.” </span></p><p><span>“That’s because you’re insane. We have rules for a reason–”</span></p><p><span>“There’s no rule against this.”</span></p><p><span>“New rule: we can’t kiss unless it’s sex related.” Agatha’s voice was such a low purr, it was almost impossible for Rio to focus on the words. </span></p><p><span>Her brain had to work overtime to answer. “Oh, come on, no way.” She was starting to feel impatient. “A kiss won’t change anything.” It wouldn’t, not when she was already so far gone. Unless—would it change anything for Agatha? “...Or would it?” </span></p><p><span>The attending’s brows twitched in annoyance as her light blye eyes flicked between Rio’s, fingers shifting to squish into her cheeks until her lips puckered out. “It wouldn’t.” </span></p><p><span>“Then <em>p</em></span><em><span><em>rove</em> it,</span></em><span>” Rio whispered over Agatha’s lips, “prove you’re not scared.” And Agatha’s clutch on her face got a little painful, and she was so, so close, Rio’s stomach tightening with each second…</span></p><p><span>Someone cleared their throat. </span><em><span>Lilia.</span></em><span> And then–</span></p><p><span>“Well, this is awkward.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pushed her back, regaining her composure in an instant, Rio’s chest beating violently with adrenaline–when she looked over to Lilia, though, she was just turning the corner into the room. </span></p><p><span>“I just now realized who you are.” She paused one moment over the threshold before getting back to her armchair.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s breathing started to slow down. Shit. Close call. Also, </span><em><span>shit</span></em><span>. Agatha’s plan was paying back, huh. She seemed totally unfazed, too, which should start to sting by now—but it was just </span><em><span>too</span></em><span> hot.</span></p><p><span>She sat back, quietly shifting a few inches away from Agatha. </span><em><span>RIP almost-kiss, you’ll be missed</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>“I can’t believe I hadn’t put it together–</span><em><span>Vidal</span></em><span>. Guillermo Vidal is your father. You’re Carol’s daughter.”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed out a breath and leaned back against the couch, propping a leg up on it. “</span><em><span>Lilia, </span></em><span>you didn’t remember me?”</span></p><p><span>“No, I remembered you. I just hadn’t realized you were… you.” She gestured at her.</span></p><p><span>“What in hell are you talking about?” Agatha looked between the two of them, frowning, and Lilia went on to explain: </span></p><p><span>“We met when she was a child, and I a baby attending.” She looked at Rio. “You’re the kid who kept terrorizing my patients, right?”</span></p><p><span>Rio shrugged, arms crossing over her chest, still missing that lost kiss. Damn, </span><em><span>unfair</span></em><span>, she needed to touch Agatha so bad</span><em><span>.</span></em><span> “Yeah… at some point, my sister wanted to be around our father all the time. Our nanny took us to work with him a few times.”</span></p><p><span>“She went around patients' rooms carrying a scalpel and told them she was lady Death, once.” Lilia cackled. “You should have seen that, Agatha, the whole ward descended into chaos. Some geriatric patients believed her; it was a nightmare to calm them down and explain it to all the relatives...”</span></p><p><span>“Loving the part where a kid got her hands on a scalpel.” Agatha was trying to frown, but Rio could see the small upward curl of her lips threatening to take over.</span></p><p><span>“It wasn’t a scalpel, it was my Death dagger. If Lilia hadn’t caught me by the eighth room, who knows what I could have accomplished–I mean, other than my mother sending me back to foster care.” </span></p><p><span>Lilia laughed, Agatha snorted. “If this is your average childhood story, I’m surprised they kept you,” she said, eyebrows tipped up.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, well,” Rio shrugged, “I guess I’m just too funny, smart, and pretty to give up.” She grinned at Agatha, ready for the sarcasm to hit back.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hummed, cocked her head. “Guess so,” she conceded, turning to Lilia right away. And just like that, oblivious to Rio’s whole chest and face flushing in surprise, she went back to work talk.</span></p><p><span>The rest of the night wasn't very productive; maybe it would have been if Rio had managed to listen for half of it. But she was getting tired, and Agatha looked so naughty when she laughed at her own burns on some chiefs, and–she needed to get her alone just to make her smile and touch the apples of her cheeks. They looked so squishy when she lit up. Would it be ok if she did it now? Agatha would cut her fingers off, but it may be worth it.</span></p><p><span>She pursed her lips, nodding to something Lilia had said—the clinician had taken her laptop the third time Rio had asked her to repeat something, and she was now annotating stuff for her.</span></p><p><span>It would be great, everything would be great. Whatever happened, whatever shape or flavor of Agatha she got, she just wanted to be around. For as long as Agatha let her.</span></p><p><span>When Agatha’s arm draped over the back of the couch and she started distractedly playing with a lock of Rio’s hair, she shivered.</span></p><p><span>No problem at all. It would be great. All great—</span></p><p><span>“What is this you had open in the background?” Lilia frowned at the screen, Agatha leaning over to see.</span></p><p><span>She suddenly took the laptop from Lilia, sharply set it into Rio’s lap.</span></p><p><span>“Yes, </span><em><span>Rio</span></em><span>, what is this?”</span></p><p><span>When she saw it, Rio’s whole body froze. Shit, Agatha was going to murder her for real, this time.</span></p><p><span>It was a list of places, a couple crossed out; all the places she wished to kneel for Agatha in the hospital, or bend her over (once Agatha finally let her do that), or…</span></p><p><span>“Uh–” she looked sideways at Agatha, whose face was a mask of indifference… except for her eyes. Her eyes told Rio she was a walking corpse. </span><em><span>Hot</span></em><span>. “It’s just a list of places for my meetings.” Lilia frowned. “Yeah.” And Rio nodded to herself. Good excuse. Totally believable.</span></p><p><span>“Why is my office not there?” Lilia asked.</span></p><p><span>“Hmm, I don’t need to write it down to remember it…”</span></p><p><span>“No, write it down.” Agatha smiled sweetly at her, and she knew she was in deep shit. “You never know.” </span></p><p><span>“Okay…” she added the line, trying really hard not to look directly at Agatha again.</span></p><p><span>“Huh, you’re missing the neurosurgery department too.” Agatha leaned towards her, their shoulders brushing, and Rio was filled with clashing feelings. What the hell was happening? “Where do you usually meet their chief?”</span></p><p><span>“Uh, we haven’t met one-on-one yet…” What was she on about?</span></p><p><span>“Just write down the department, then.” Agatha pointed at the screen and then lay back against the couch, resuming her talk with Lilia like she hadn’t just secretly told her two extra places she wanted to… </span><em><span>do stuff</span></em><span>. Which also confirmed she </span><em><span>did</span></em><span> plan for the sex ban to end, eventually. </span></p><p><span>Well, Rio was going to die. Agatha was going to be the death of her. What better way to go?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She hit the jackpot less than half an hour later, when Lilia got another call: it was from the hospital, and she was the on-call attending.</span></p><p><span>When Agatha stood after her, Rio knew what little puppies must feel when their humans are leaving: dismay. It was tragic. She didn’t want Agatha to leave. </span></p><p><span>But then Lilia–what a saint–waved a hand to dismiss Agatha. “You don’t need to drive me, I’m calling a cab. Stay here, enjoy your free night. Just try not to eat Rio alive.” </span></p><p><span>Well, Rio wished to be eaten alive. She really did.</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked like she was trying to come up with an excuse, but she must have fallen short, because she just glanced over at Rio and gave a small grunt. And just like that, Rio’s heart was filled with joy. She got to be around Agatha a little longer. </span></p><p><span>Five minutes later, Lilia left.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey.” </span></p><p><span>Rio was deep into a pantry, on a mission Agatha had sent her on as she saw Lilia out, when she heard the voice behind her; she startled and spun around too fast, hitting her forehead against a cupboard door. “Ouuww…” She pressed a hand to the pain, and Agatha sighed.</span></p><p><span>“</span><em><span>God</span></em><span>, you’re hopeless.” She hung around the kitchen island, “Ice again?”</span></p><p><span>“No, it’s ok. It wasn’t that bad.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha hummed and just stood there, the resigned fondness on her face disappearing into a pensive look as she turned sideways. Her side profile was soft in the warm lights, pretty nose and pursed lips, and Rio just wanted to walk up to her and kiss her. </span><span><br/>
</span></p><p><span>Something, however—something other than Agatha totally kicking her ass if she did that—told her it wasn’t the right time.</span></p><p><span>“Do you want to talk about Mrs. Davis some more?” She tried.</span></p><p><span>“No, it’s fine.” She hesitated–rare–and then a small smirk pulled up a corner of her lips. “I have the board in the palm of my hand.” </span></p><p><span>“Hmm,” </span><em><span>Hot</span></em><span>. Despite her best intentions, Rio got pulled closer. “More than the usual?” And if she just took another step, Agatha would be stuck between her and the kitchen island.<br/>
</span><span>She didn’t. </span></p><p><span>Agatha pushed her fingers against Rio’s chest anyway. “Stay away, <em>lady</em> <em>Death</em>,” she said; when Rio compliantly stepped back, though, Agatha followed her. Damn her and her mixed signals. </span></p><p><span>“Weren’t you getting me Doritos?” Agatha pointed at the cupboard, but she was missing some of her cockiness again. Something was definitely up.</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled: she knew what to do. “Sure,” she said, and went back to her snack mission, giving Agatha some space. </span></p><p><span>She only had to rummage for a few moments before Agatha spoke: “I finally talked to your mother.” </span></p><p><span>Gleefully closing her fingers around a forgotten pack of Doritos, Rio hummed. “What did she want from you? So weird she didn’t tell me…” She threw the tortillas on the counter and studied Agatha, who was looking at her own index tracing the kitchen island, lips pursed in thought. It took everything in Rio not to get closer again. She was so beautiful, with her dark curls falling on her waist, and for once she even looked… insecure. Rio needed to touch her, to just </span><em><span>be closer</span></em><span>. </span></p><p><span>She waited.</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally looked at her. “She says I’m getting an ASA medallion.” And her hand that was tracing furniture curled back to her side.</span></p><p><span>It was huge—Agatha wasn’t even smiling, but Rio’s chest felt like it might burst from joy. </span></p><p><span>“Oh my god!” She closed the distance in two strides, immediately wrapping her arms around Agatha’s waist in a hug. She squeezed her so hard that Agatha’s feet left the floor, and she squealed as her arms found grip around Rio’s neck. And surely she was finally smiling. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, this is insane! I can’t believe it!” She spun her around, Agatha laughing into her arms, and her hair smelled so good, and she felt so soft, and she deserved to win that prize. She deserved the world.</span></p><p><span>When she finally set her down, Agatha was still laughing. Rio moved a lock of hair back from her cheek, and Agatha looked so beautiful with the soft smile on her face, Rio's chest ached. It hurt so bad not to kiss her right away. </span></p><p><span>“It’s not a done deal…” She started, but Rio could still see the small lines to the sides of her eyes from smiling.</span></p><p><span>“If Carol says so, it’s happening.” Rio’s face hurt from grinning. “Fucking insane!” She wanted to squeeze her some more, to kiss her whole face. “Are you crazy? You should be shouting this from the rooftops! You’re making literal history—” Agatha chuckled then, and she looked down, like she couldn’t take a compliment. And what the actual fuck was happening, Agatha Harkness acting that way? </span></p><p><span>Rio cupped her face, making her look up. “You’re incredible.” And because she was afraid a kiss to the lips would be too much, she pressed a soft one to her cheek.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re incredible.” Rio’s eyes sparkled in a way no one’s ever had in response to her accomplishments, and then she kissed her cheek. And Agatha’s chest swelled so much, she couldn’t stop grinning. Only one thing would have made it better: if Rio had kissed her lips.</span></p><p><span>“Thanks,” she said, and she didn’t even need to remark that </span><em><span>she knew she was incredible</span></em><span>. Not when Rio kept looking at her that way.</span></p><p><span>Her hands gripped the fabric of Rio’s tee at the waist, and she was going to be the one to kiss her. If Rio didn’t </span><em><span>stop </span></em><span>grinning that way, she was going to kiss her.</span></p><p><span>So she stepped back. She needed a change of topic. A distraction, before she did something stupid like make out with Vidal out of joy and warmth. She didn’t need to put herself through that.</span></p><p><span>Of course, her traitorous mind went to the one thing she wasn’t supposed to ask, the one thing she had </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> been wondering about all day. Before she could stop, she’d blurted out: “Who’s Maya?”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked in surprise, and Agatha felt like looking away—but this time, she didn’t.</span></p><p><span>“She’s my sister.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>It had started slowly. So slow, Rio hadn’t realized, at first; no one had. Maya had met a guy: a nice guy, for once. He bought her flowers, picked her up whenever she stayed out late with her friends, he was just kind, all over. </span></em></p><p><em><span>She was happy. They’d moved in together, and Rio had helped her unpack her infinite number of carton boxes. She seemed at peace around him—quiet, more than her usual.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She still visited their parents and siblings at first; the guy was very rarely with her, but he simply had a demanding job. Nothing strange there: not to Rio, used as she was to their parents. Except Maya’s visits had soon started spacing out, and she’d started making excuses to cancel. She had the flu one time, a job event the next, a game her boyfriend really wished for her to go watch with him; the excuses piled up, until they barely saw her for months. When she did show up, once, her arms were bruised, but she brushed it off as an accident.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio started asking to visit her, but her sister never had time. When she showed up unannounced, Maya was never home, and her boyfriend would turn Rio away. She always texted back, but she started avoiding calls; when Rio mentioned it to a close common friend, he said he hadn’t heard from Maya in eight months. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio got worried. It wasn’t very unlike Maya to get absorbed into a relationship, but she’d never withdrawn from social life that much. None of her male friends had seen her in ages, none of them knew what was going on. Several had tried to reach out unsuccessfully; only her girl friends were still able to see her. She often wore long-sleeved clothes in hot temperatures, claiming she just preferred the aesthetics. When Rio questioned her about anything suspicious, she would withdraw completely and find excuses to hang up the phone—or leave, the few times they actually saw each other.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio rapidly grew alarmed. She finally showed up at their place, and when the guy tried to turn her away, she pushed her way in. And there Maya was, lying on the sofa and watching something on TV, the picture of normality… if it hadn’t been for the dated, dark brown bruises all over her legs.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Obviously, Rio had tried to get her out of there. Something wasn’t right. But Maya had insisted she was fine, she’d just been really into bouldering lately. And she didn’t look that fit, but Rio had asked her to promise, and she had. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio had trusted her. Maya wouldn’t lie to her about that.</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sitting on the couch with Rio, Agatha listened so intently she didn’t realize when exactly she’d taken Rio’s hand—or Rio had taken hers. But as Rio traced the lines of her palm, up over her forearm and back, she let her. Humming along, asking questions here and there, she listened.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Maya had shown up at Rio’s place the next morning. Her face swollen, she had a black eye and several new bruises on her legs. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio hadn’t known what the fuck to do. She wanted to go murder the guy, but it clearly wasn’t an option. So she’d tried to convince Maya to go to the police, unsuccessfully. Maya had just asked her to treat her wounds, refusing to even go to a hospital.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“It’s the two of us, just like it’s always been. I don’t need anyone else,” she’d said, and Rio hadn’t been able to push her to change her mind. And though her promises had lost some of their credibility, Rio had made her swear she wouldn’t go back to the guy.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The abuser, of course, had come back crawling to her. He was smart: he worked on Maya gradually and relentlessly, only when Rio wasn’t around. She’d seen his name pop up in Maya’s notifications one day, some texts about how great they were together, and Maya had fucking smiled at it.</span></em></p><p><em><span>So, dreading the day he convinced her to take him back, Rio had shown up at his door. She’d blocked the door with a foot when he’d tried to close it in her face, and ignoring his sneers and insults, she’d grabbed him by the neck of his perfectly tailored shirt and shaken him. “If you get near her again, talk to her, text her—if you so much as breathe within a mile of her, I promise you you’re done. For each blow you ever gave her, I’ll punch you ten.” She’d shoved him back, “Don’t fucking test me,” She’d added through her teeth. </span></em></p><p><em><span>The abuser had smiled like a snake as he lied: “I’ve never harmed her in any way. I could never.” And then he’d sneered and pointed behind Rio: a security camera was on in his porch, aimed at them. “Thank you for your visit,” he’d added before slamming the door in her face.</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio had somehow ended up in her arms as she told the story, Agatha holding her without a word. Rio’s face was currently hiding in her neck, her voice soft as she spoke against her skin. And Agatha just kept listening: even though Rio’s legs, thrown over hers on the couch, were cutting off her circulation, she didn’t move. She kept drawing soothing patterns on Rio’s back and through her hair, quiet. In truth, she barely realized what the fuck she was doing, but Rio needed it. It was right.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Rio had told Maya everything, but it hadn’t helped. Eventually, he’d made a huge show of crawling back and asking Maya to marry him, and Maya had fucking said yes.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Before Rio had been able to process what was going on, Maya was gone once again. She hadn’t completely disappeared, and she wasn’t showing up bruised anymore, but Rio didn’t trust the change one bit.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Only one month (and many fights trying to get Maya to change her mind) later, Rio had been at work when she’d gotten a call to the ER for an incoming trauma—multiple blunt force injuries to the face, legs, and torso, likely abdominal bleeding. </span></em></p><p><em><span>She’d been putting on latex gloves, ready for whatever it was, when the gurney had been rolled in. </span></em></p><p><em><span>She wasn’t fucking ready for whatever it was. She’d seen a head of black curls, sticky with blood, over a swollen face—almost unrecognizable. And she’d searched for the tattoo to the back of her ear, as she did lately out of paranoia, because her brain couldn’t process that it actually was Maya, this time. How was it possible? What was the likelihood she’d end up in her care, if she even… No, it was completely out of the question. It could never really be Maya.</span></em></p><p><em><span>In truth, she’d known right away that it was her, but she hadn’t believed it. Not until she’d seen the small, white-ink tattoo: a series of numbers. It was the day Rio and her had officially been adopted.</span></em></p><p><em><span>And as she’d taken it all in, before she’d even gotten a chance to assess just how worried out of her mind she needed to be, the abuser—the fucking monster, had walked in.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She saw him through wet eyes, a little blurred. He was in tears, blood staining his white shirt, and Rio had seen red. She’d jumped him, dragging him to the ground, and punched him. And then she’d hit him again, over and over. She hadn’t heard the medical personnel screaming at her to stop, nor her sister crying weakly, nor the guy’s gurgling as he tried to fight back. She’d punched him repeatedly until security had dragged her away, his shirt finally drenched in his own blood. She'd realized her mistake right away. </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio had given back some space as she’d told the last part, as if expecting Agatha to want to get away from her. </span></p><p><span>“That’s why I… When I saw that guy being aggressive with you in the ER, it reminded me of </span><em><span>him</span></em><span>. I tried, though, I really tried not to resort to violence again.” She looked down, and was she tearing up? “But then he grabbed you again, and I was so afraid he might hurt you…” her voice cracked a little.</span></p><p><span>Cross-legged and facing Rio over the couch, Agatha cupped her face. “It’s ok. He hit you first, didn’t he?”</span></p><p><span>Rio chuckled wetly, still refusing to look up. “I still shouldn’t have. I never, </span><em><span>ever</span></em><span> want to do that again. I met Maya in a foster family, and she always took care of me, you know? And I protected her in a more… physical way. She’s the reason my parents adopted me: when she first met them, she refused to take them unless I went with. I—we always protected each other until we finally moved out in college, but I hadn’t hit anyone ever since I was eight.” She sniffed through tears, “I don’t want to do it again. I don’t want to turn into </span><em><span>them</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re not like them in the slightest.” She dried the tears from Rio’s cheeks, her chest hurting like hell. “It was wrong, but you did it out of love.” Rio’s eyes widened, and Agatha added: “for your sister.” She swallowed, and Rio nodded.</span></p><p><span>“You’re not scared of me, or…” she trailed off, glossy eyes shifting between Agatha’s.</span></p><p><span>“Honey, have you met me?” Her thumbs swiped Rio’s cheeks again before dropping back into Rio’s over her lap. “I do want to know more of your childhood stories, though,” she tried to lift the mood, “maybe the cheerful ones, yeah? Any story with you pissing off Carol would be great.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, her usual self finally seeping through again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>***</span></p><p> </p><p><span>A few funny anecdotes later, Rio was happily lying on her, head on her chest. Agatha’s traitorous fingers threaded through her hair. </span></p><p><span>She took a pause, and Agatha stayed silent, tracing the path from her temple down her jaw. Rio’s hand below her shirt played at her waist, fingers stroking her ribs, making it really annoying for Agatha to try and ignore the tingling it elicited.</span></p><p><span>And how the hell had she ended up in that position?</span></p><p><span>“Agatha…” Rio suddenly propped herself up, hips probably </span><em><span>accidentally</span></em><span> shifting between Agatha’s thighs, and she had to push the feeling down, shove it deep beneath the surface—the feeling of Rio moving against her, her whole stupid body firing up…</span></p><p><span>But she’d apparently decided to be a decent human being for one night, and Rio was telling her important stuff, opening up. </span><em><span>No </span></em><span>horny, be normal.</span></p><p><span>“The thing about Maya is… what if he doesn’t pay because of me? I was so stupid, I never should have shown up at his house. I fucked up so bad.” She looked at her like she was expecting something, like whatever Agatha said now would solve everything. </span></p><p><span>Agatha hummed softly. “Maybe so, but I would have done the same.“</span></p><p><span>“You would have been smarter about it.” Rio shifted again, fucking torturing her.</span></p><p><span>And why in hell had they ended up having that talk in that position? With Rio between her legs? What the fuck had possessed her to let it happen? Letting Rio do whatever she wanted, just because she was looking soft and cute and vulnerable… </span><em><span>shit</span></em><span>, it had been the tears. </span></p><p><span>She grounded herself, taking a deep breath. </span><em><span>Talk.</span></em><span> “I don’t think there really </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> a way to be smart about it without compromising your values. If what you’re saying is my values are not as rooted as yours, well, then you might be right…”</span></p><p><span>Rio shook her head. “That’s not what I meant. You work so hard for other people, for your patients. Why don’t you seem to realize?”</span></p><p><span>Finally something simple to answer. “Hmm, I don’t do it for them. My reasons are selfish.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hips bucked ever so slightly, fucking torture. </span><em><span>Think chaste thoughts, think chaste thoughts…</span></em></p><p><span>“Does it matter? Whenever people do good, you could argue they’re doing it for themselves, because it makes them feel nice. I don’t think you’re being fair to yourse—“ she paused, lips lingering open, studying her face. “What’s going on?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shut her eyes for a moment. </span><em><span>Fuck. </span></em><span>Not doing enough of a good job at hiding her stupid bodily reactions. “It’s nothing, I’m just listening. Keep going.”</span></p><p><span>Rio shifted again to lay her weight on one elbow, eyes narrowing as she moved her hair to one side, and Agatha had to use all her brain power </span><em><span>at once</span></em><span> not to meet the movement of her hips. </span></p><p><span>It must have been clear on her face when she pressed her lips together and let out a small huff through her nose, because Rio’s lips turned into an “o”. “You’re…” she looked down where their hips met. “Oooh.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m not </span><em><span>anything!</span></em><span> Just keep talking, I’m fucking listening, okay?” Embarrassing as hell. Ugh. Wasn’t it cringe enough that she actually wanted to listen to Rio talk about her </span><em><span>feelings? </span></em><span>Now she also had to be caught having the wrong kind of reaction, at the most inappropriate time…</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t tease her, didn’t smile one of her lopsided grins; she simply looked like the answer to all her problems lay on Agatha’s lips, eyes locked there. “You’re feeling it too, I’m not the only perv,” she mumbled.</span></p><p><span>Feeling it </span><em><span>too</span></em><span>. She was going through the inappropriate, torturous </span><em><span>want</span></em><span> as well? But still— “</span><em><span>Perv</span></em><span>? It’s normal bodily reactions! It’s </span><em><span>your</span></em><span> fault, this is ridiculous, why did you have to talk about your feelings with your dick between my legs?“ Rio chuckled, “Figure of speech—“</span></p><p><span>But Rio’s hips grinded against her, very fucking intentionally this time, cutting her off. And Agatha’s grip on the collar of her tee tightened, her jaw clenching in an attempt not to let the </span><em><span>insane </span></em><span>hotness that was spreading up her body show through.</span></p><p><span>“I’ll take the blame,” Rio whispered against her lips, and Agatha hated how easily she was letting her get close.</span></p><p><span>Fuck</span><em><span>, fuck fuck fuck. </span></em><span>Agatha‘s chin tilted up. Fuck being a decent person. “I guess you’re done being a whiny baby, then?” She heard herself purr, giving in. </span></p><p><em><span>No</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>wait, </span></em><span>she’d just set a sex embargo the day before. Could she last one day?</span></p><p><span>But Rio just nodded slowly. And then, her whole body pressing up </span><em><span>perfectly</span></em><span> against Agatha, she finally kissed her.</span></p><p><span>It was unhurried and soft, Rio tasting a little like iron, and Agatha could feel the fine suture line on Rio’s lower lip. And it was </span><em><span>hers.</span></em><span> <br/>
</span><span>She had to keep the kissing delicate, hold back from any intensity that would mess up the healing cut. Or hurt Rio too much.</span></p><p><span>She lost herself in it, Rio’s nose bumping against her cheek, lashes fluttering open every time they separated for a moment to change the angle. She lost herself for who knew how long, Rio’s cheek soft under her thumb, and it felt </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> sweet. So tender. And maybe, just maybe, they had no business doing </span><em><span>that</span></em><span>. That didn’t feel exactly like sex… </span></p><p><span>Rio came to the rescue. She felt nails scrape below her shirt and down her waist, so </span><em><span>annoyingly</span></em><span> good, taking her back to familiar territory. </span><em><span>That</span></em><span>, she could do.</span></p><p><span>She let a hand roam up Rio's thigh, fingers slithering into her shorts and digging into her ass—and then she pushed her aside. With Rio’s surprising complete lack of resistance, she managed to switch their positions.</span></p><p><span>She slid Rio’s arms over her head, not even having to pin her crossed wrists there, because Rio didn’t complain as Agatha settled between her legs. She just looked at her, entranced, pupils blown like an addict. Her chest already rose and fell deeply.</span></p><p><span>And </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span>, what a good girl. She was being so compliant, she must really, </span><em><span>really</span></em><span> want this.</span></p><p><span>Agatha smirked, and Rio visibly writhed, fingers curling around nothing.</span></p><p><span>“What a good girl, acting </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> nice. You keep this up, I might even forget the sex ban.” Rio’s eyes widened, and Agatha chuckled. “Oh? You thought you’d already made me forget?”</span></p><p><span>Rio hummed ever so softly before reluctantly shaking her head no. </span><em><span>Hell</span></em><span>. So perfect. And Agatha couldn’t just tease her with words any longer.</span></p><p><span>She drew her tee up over her braless chest, a hand immediately drawing the path of her clavicle and closing softly around her neck.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hips rolled up, and she let out a soft, close-mouthed whine. </span><em><span>Fucking hell. </span></em><span>She was </span><em><span>hers. </span></em><span>Just for one night, opening up so bravely… </span><em><span>she was hers.</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha descended on her. Softly kissing and licking up her neck after tilting her jaw to the side for space, finding no resistance. She didn’t bite, no roughness, for once: none needed when all Rio could do was whimper at every touch. And when she shifted down, down until she had Rio’s tit into an open-mouthed kiss, the other surgeon trembled under her, shooting an intense need through her body to just—take her whole. To kiss and bite at every inch of her, until she ultimately got between her legs…</span></p><p><span>Tasting the paths she drew on hot skin, she moved to the other side of Rio’s chest, rolling her tongue around and over the hardened nipple. Rio moaned a throaty whine, and she was trying visibly hard not to continuously grind up against her, and Agatha felt like melting into the sensations and giving her all of it, everything she needed, because her whole body was burning with each writhe, each uncontrolled twitch of Rio’s thighs, each sound that came out of her mouth...</span></p><p><span>She went on and on, until she wasn’t sure if she was teasing Rio or herself. And she was on Rio’s belly, kissing the smooth skin beside her hip spine like it was her only purpose in life—when Rio spoke.</span></p><p><span>It was nothing, really. Just one word, moaned out and cracking at the edges.</span></p><p><span>“Please…” </span></p><p><span>And it drove her insane.</span></p><p><span>She shifted down, hands hooking around Rio’s thighs, the sweet smell of her core inebriating.</span></p><p><span>“Say it again.”</span></p><p><span>Rio swallowed hard, glazed-over eyes fixed on her, wrists still obediently crossed over her head. <br/>
</span><span>“Please,” she whispered, and Agatha’s mouth descended on her inner thighs. “Please,” Rio repeated breathily, and Agatha kissed and licked the other side, closer to her center, “</span><em><span>Please…”</span></em></p><p><span>Teeth finally digging into the softest spot at the apex of Rio’s thigh, Agatha hummed throatily into it, Rio’s hips hopelessly bucking up. Agatha’s manicured nails clawed into her skin…</span></p><p><span>She sucked a mark there, unhurriedly licking the sensitive spot right after, and then, pushing herself to the limits of her self-control, she kneeled up on the sofa, scooting up between Rio’s legs.</span></p><p><span>She threw her long hair to one side, ignoring Rio’s heavy-lidded look turning confused over her heaving chest. Her hands were </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> so beautifully in place where she’d fist left them, and Agatha almost regretted what she was about to do.</span></p><p><span>Nails drawing down Rio’s inner thighs, she tutted. <br/>
</span><span>“Did you really expect it to be this easy?” She gave a mocking pout, “Hmm, I better go home now.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes widened, and she sat up so fast her forehead hit Agatha’s cheekbone, Agatha’s rapid reflexes the only thing saving them from matching bruises.</span></p><p><span>“Hey, don’t ruin my perfect face…” she brought a hand to it, but it felt fine.</span></p><p><span>Rio frantically nodded. “Sorry. Perfect.” She nodded again. Her brain wasn’t braining, huh. “You’re leaving now?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha was already climbing off the couch. She slid her heels back on and grabbed her phone and keys, all the while Rio stared at her with parted lips, messy hair and flushed cheeks, like Agatha could change her mind any second.</span></p><p><span>“See you, darling.” Agatha wiggled her fingers at her, and the completely lost look on Rio’s face was almost worth the loss.</span></p><p><span>To her credit, Rio didn’t try to change her mind. She sank back into the sofa, still catching her breath, until Agatha was almost out of there. </span></p><p><span>She heard her shuffle down the sofa and dash after her, until she preceded Agatha to the door, opening it for her. </span></p><p><span>“My lady,” she said, and she curtly bowed again. </span></p><p><span>“Hmm…” Agatha could get used to it. </span></p><p><span>Her hand went up to hook around Rio’s jaw, but she caught herself and stopped with it hovering mid-air. Because she was going to grab Rio’s face and kiss her, and that wasn’t something they did.</span></p><p><span>The hand dropped to her side. Rio’s flustered cheeks filled with air, and then, for some unknown Rio reason, she pouted. </span></p><p><span>“See you at work,” Agatha said, looking away from Rio’s intense focus.  </span></p><p><span>Because it was </span><em><span>too</span></em><span> intense, and that wasn’t something they did. </span></p><p><span>She left.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span>***</span><br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p><span>Alice came home hours after Agatha had left, stumbling about in the dark with doctor Kale, their loud whispers waking a barely-asleep Rio. </span></p><p><span>She got up. Might as well say hi. Her attempts at sleeping had been constantly disturbed by dreams of Agatha almost-but-never-quite kissing her, disappearing on her, refusing to open up to her after she had. Agatha telling her she wasn’t enough… Agatha leaving her.</span></p><p><span>She got it, there was a theme. The years of therapy had fixed a lot, but apparently not all her abandonment issues. </span></p><p><span>She stepped into the corridor, eyes puffy from sleep.</span></p><p><span>“Hey.” She waved at Alice, who was on the threshold of her room. “Greetings, Doctor Kale.”</span></p><p><span>“Hi, Alice’s weird flatmate. For the tenth time, call me Jen.” Doctor Kale rolled her eyes, but as she disappeared into Alice’s room, she smiled.</span></p><p><span>Alice walked the corridor back to Rio. “Oh, Rio, sorry! Did we wake you?” she asked, eyebrows knitting together in worry.</span></p><p><span>“No, no worries. I was having trouble sleeping.” She stood there, rubbing at her eyes. </span></p><p><span>Alice didn’t leave.</span></p><p><span>“Are you ok?” She asked a few seconds later, soft eyes on her. </span></p><p><span>Rio nodded, clutching the hem of her tee as she just stood there.</span></p><p><span>“Nightmares again?”</span></p><p><span>“Not really. Just some annoying dreams, but nothing serious.”</span></p><p><span>Alice got closer and pulled her into a hug, rubbing her back a couple times. Rio didn’t hug her back, but it was pretty comforting.</span></p><p><span>“You’re ok. Sorry we woke you,” Alice said into the hug, and then let her go. </span></p><p><span>“If you keep saying sorry, my next nightmare will be about that.” She chuckled, and Alice with her. “Thanks,” she semi-whispered. “Go tuck your girlfriend in now, I bet she charges you for each minute you let her wait.”</span></p><p><span>“No, you know, she’s actually really sweet. And not officially my girlfriend yet, but–”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, yeah. Sure.” Rio waved her off, starting to walk in the direction of the stairs to go grab a glass of water. “Just don’t be too loud with the tucking, okay?”</span></p><p><span>She heard Alice huff a laugh. “There will be no tucking. She spent all night helping me study for my board exam, we’re spent.”</span></p><p><span>“Fuck board exams,” Rio said, waving a middle finger over her shoulder. “</span><em><span>That</span></em><span> is the real nightmare.” And she disappeared down the stairs.</span></p><p><span>Fuck board exams, really. With all the working, and all the </span><em><span>other</span></em><span> working for her parents’ foundation, she hadn’t been able to study shit. Which would be fine, cause she’d been getting ready for it for five years, but still—fuck board exams.</span></p><p><span>She’d rather have all the Agatha nightmares in the world than go back to dreaming of </span><em><span>exams,</span></em><span> as she used to in college. </span></p><p><span>At least Agatha was hot.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>

<p>Agatha kept torturing her, but at least she wasn’t keeping her away. </p><p> </p><p>It was tuesday, and Rio had to rely on a giant latte to make it through the morning trauma meeting. Agatha had thrown her out of bed at 6am, half-naked and flustered, telling her to “take a cold shower, whatever you do is none of my business”. </p><p>And Rio had smirked, because Agatha’s eyes had been roaming over her naked legs as she said it, freshly-applied lipstick still smeared and matching the smudge between Rio’s thighs.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t told her to fix the lipstick. She <em>had</em> told her, however, how great her ass looked in that pencil skirt. And if she’d spent the whole shower trying to protect the red smudge from getting washed off her skin, it was no one’s business but her own.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had some obnoxious clinic patient to attend to that morning, and Rio hated the days when she wasn’t around the hospital. </p><p> </p><p>She doodled a skull on the printed out patients list—waste of paper—as the meeting went on, then a scalpel, then the letters A.H. She was staring at the initials, feeling a little pathetic, when some whispering caught her attention. </p><p> </p><p>She looked up; across the table, two interns were leaning together. One pointed at her, said something under his breath—the other caught Rio’s eye and pushed his friend’s hand down in a panic, shushing him.</p><p> </p><p><em>Weird.</em></p><p> </p><p>She ignored them. The meeting was almost done; she scribbled over the two letters in front of her and waited for her attending to call on her.</p><p> </p><p>She was finally out of there, falling in line with Dr. Kepner in the corridor, when someone walked by, too close, hitting her shoulder <em>hard</em>.</p><p> </p><p><em>What the fuck?</em></p><p> </p><p>It was Derryl, a dumb fourth year with an inferiority complex he couldn’t quite shake. At least he usually waited until after lunch to be an asshole.</p><p> </p><p>“Man, dislocating my shoulder isn’t going to get you my surgeries,” Rio shot after him. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, my mommy ain’t either,” he grunted at her, striding away too fast for Rio to answer.</p><p> </p><p><em>What a prick.</em></p><p><br/><br/></p><p>***</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>The day went on the same. She caught some nurses whispering after her, and then the anesthesiologist in the ER kept staring. </p><p> </p><p>Was it all in her mind? </p><p> </p><p>She had no time to wonder. Rounds, a six-hour-long surgery, and then a board meeting. <em>The</em> board meeting: among other things, they were voting for Agatha’s patient Ro had pushed—she still felt a little uncomfortable at having played favorites. </p><p> </p><p>Making sure no one was around to see her get in, she pushed the door to the meeting room open, and—</p><p> </p><p>“Dad?”</p><p> </p><p>“Good afternoon, mija.” Her father looked up from his phone, sitting against a windowsill in one of his usual soft, split-color suits, “¿Cómo estás?”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here?” </p><p> </p><p>He smiled at Rio ignoring his question. “Your mother wanted to oversee some things, but she didn’t feel like coming here herself. She’s still a little mad, but you know her, it’ll pass.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>She’s</em> mad?” Rio was bewildered. “<em>I’m</em> mad! At you too, by the way…”</p><p> </p><p>Guillermo stepped closer, phone sliding into a pocket. “I know, mija, but I’m doing what I think is best for Maya and you. You can disagree with me, but don’t ever forget I love you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, whatever.” Rio crossed her arms. He always got away with sweet words, when in truth he was doing the same shit as Carol.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not giving your old dad a hug?” His arms spread open. </p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a small grunt. “Not in the hospital, dad.” </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, okay. Later then. Can I take you to dinner tonight?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, okay.” She checked the open door; no one seemed to be getting close yet. And even though her father’s arms had gone back to his sides, she went and gave him a small hug. </p><p><br/><br/></p><p>***</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>A little late to the party—her latest clinic patient had taken a bit longer than she should have—Agatha knocked on the wooden door and pushed it open without waiting for an answer.</p><p> </p><p>Eleven people were sitting around the dark brown table, and she knew all of them in person, except for one. She’d only ever seen him in pictures: Carol’s husband, <em>Rio’s father… </em>Guillermo Vidal. Also one of the Seven, known as the Coyote. Broad shoulders and greying hair, he looked composed but relaxed, an ease about him that Carol certainly didn’t have. </p><p> </p><p>Strange Carol hadn’t shown up herself, considering she’d been the one to tell Agatha to come plead her case in person–but Agatha certainly wouldn’t complain.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat to the left of her father, hair pinned back, a pen between her fingers; she looked up, clearly not expecting Agatha, eyes widening for a heartbeat before she straightened up in her seat. </p><p> </p><p>After a few pleasantries, Agatha took a chair opposite Rio, blatantly ignoring her continuous glances. <em>Would she stop?</em> She was <em>so</em> obvious. </p><p> </p><p>It was cute, though. And she was feeling cocky, the vote definitely in her hands… </p><p>So, when everyone’s attention turned toward the old man at the head of the table, Agatha smirked. She leaned her chin into her hand, caught Rio’s eyes, and winked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, almost dropped her pen; it was so cute Agatha nearly laughed. But it was her turn to speak, and she had to rip her attention away from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She presented her case, keeping the medical talk to a minimum: most of these people didn’t want to hear about that, didn’t care, wouldn’t understand. Prognosis, ethics, costs; she had to be concise and just a little convincing.</p><p> </p><p>...Reconstructions aren’t about vanity, there’s so much more to restoring one’s self-image, their identity.” She wouldn’t even need to say it if nine out of the eleven people around the table weren’t men. “And if you’re not willing to invest in that, then at least live up to what this foundation claims to exist for: cutting-edge medical innovation.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence followed; a couple of them nodded, Guillermo smiled.</p><p> </p><p>When her gaze drifted to Rio again, she looked so serious, eyes focused and thumb tapping against the pen as she watched Agatha. Seeing Rio like that was strange—so composed, looking like the authority she secretly held. Something Agatha usually managed to tuck away in the back of her mind. </p><p> </p><p>And she <em>knew</em>, like no one in the room possibly could: she knew exactly how Rio’s breath hitched when Agatha kissed her, or how her hands fisted when she wouldn’t let Rio touch her.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, her stomach was twisting at the secret that was only between them—that Rio was, sometimes, a little bit hers. </p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p>***</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>She was getting away at the end of the meeting, the rush of victory still glowing in her chest, when a voice called from the other end of the room. </p><p> </p><p>“Doctor Harkness!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped in her tracks; Guillermo Vidal was walking towards her, a bored-looking Rio following suit as the other board members slowly left the room.</p><p> </p><p>“We haven’t properly met,” he said, offering Agatha a hand; when she took it, he clasped hers with both of his—a bit much, if you asked her. “I’m Guillermo Vidal, Rio’s father.”</p><p> </p><p>“Pleasure,” Agatha replied evenly. <em>What did he want?</em></p><p> </p><p>“About time we met in person, isn’t it? My wife talks about you. You’re quite the thorn in her side, apparently, but a very competent one.” If he was trying for a backhanded jab, he had it completely wrong.</p><p> </p><p>But Guillermo smiled brightly, lively dark eyes under long lashes, seemingly just joking. </p><p> </p><p>“I shall hope so,” Agatha settled for, “And I mean both.”</p><p> </p><p>To her father's side, Rio gave a lopsided smile; Guillermo broke into an open laugh. </p><p> </p><p>“I get why my daughter likes you, hah!” </p><p> </p><p>“Dad!” Rio certainly didn’t look bored <em>now</em>. “What are you even talking about…”</p><p> </p><p>“Mija, you haven’t tried to leave this conversation once.”</p><p> </p><p>“So what? <em>Ugh,</em>” she rolled her eyes, hands dipping in her pockets; when Agatha looked at her, however, she was smiling.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll leave you two to your incredible work, then,” Guillermo said at last. “I hope to see you again soon, Doctor Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please, call me Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” he nodded once. “Next time, I’ll be sure to ask all about the chaos my daughter brings to the workplace.” He smiled proudly at Rio’s groan and kissed the side of her head.</p><p> </p><p>As he left, Rio looked like she wanted the floor to swallow her whole.</p><p> </p><p>With a smirk, Agatha walked out and down the corridor, the faint click of her heels echoing against the walls. She didn’t need to ask Rio to follow her, nor did she need to look back to know she was; soon enough, the sound of her steps confirmed it.</p><p> </p><p>“You really let my dad call you by your first name?” Rio said as she caught up, sounding affronted. “You made such a big deal about not letting <em>me</em> do that when we first met!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced sideways, lips curving up. “Your father is polite. <em>And </em>kind of charming, I must say.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio frowned. “And I’m not?!”</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t help an amused hum. “No, not polite. Do you want to be?”</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio could come up with an answer, someone walking past gave her a strange look. Rio noticed it too, her eyes narrowing at them. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, what the hell is going on? I’ve been getting looks and whispers all day long. Do you think they know about…” She hesitated, giving her a look that said <em>“about us”</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, no,” Agatha turned a corner. “They know about your parents.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?! How did they…”</p><p> </p><p>“Billy, I guess. He was there when your mother and you had your little screaming match.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, then frowned. “I thought he didn’t know who she was…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just shrugged. “It wasn’t Lilia. She’s not such a big yapper.”</p><p> </p><p>They’d reached the end of a hallway, an empty supply room sitting half open to the left, and Agatha pushed the door wider and stepped inside. Rio followed, likely lost in thought.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned, watching her from the height advantage her heels gave, head tilted up in an amused smile. “Did you realize you just followed me into a supply closet?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked around, mildly surprised; before she could retort, Agatha moved closer, locking the door behind her. She stepped forward until Rio’s back hit the wood, and her hands came up, palms flat on either side of Rio’s head.</p><p> </p><p>The resident smiled, smug now, as her fingers softly traced the hem of Agatha’s white coat, asking for permission. <em>So disciplined.</em></p><p> </p><p>“What do you even care if everyone knows?” Agatha said softly, her breath brushing Rio’s jaw, “You’ll be an attending soon.”</p><p> </p><p>“Still,” Rio’s head tipped back against the door, her eyes half-lidded. “Even on a fellowship, I want to make my own way.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart thudded softly as she asked: “You plan on staying in this hospital for your fellowship?” </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe. Why not?”</p><p> </p><p>She shifted, forcing a casual tone. <em>Because I’m not enough to keep you. </em></p><p>“I don’t know. Why stay?”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, heartbeat in her throat. <em>Because you’re here.</em></p><p>“I don’t know."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked her up and down, expression unreadable. As always, when she stepped back and <em>actually</em> went to grab some supplies, the longing in Rio’s chest was only a little sharper than the last.</p><p> </p><p>Quiet, she stared at Agatha’s back.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The whispering and pointing didn’t subside over the next couple of days; if anything, it got worse. She tried to ignore it, tried not to talk back to Derryl’s snarky little comments or the way he was always talking behind her back—quite literally behind her back, whenever she couldn’t see him but was obviously within earshot.</p><p> </p><p>She was starting to get seriously annoyed, a couple interns staring at her over the desk as she updated patients' charts. Was it too early to start to reconsider her recently renewed non-violent lifestyle? </p><p> </p><p>She huffed, eyes shifting back down to the laptop, when her phone chimed. </p><p> </p><p>Billy: <em>Lunch together in 20? I feel like I haven’t seen you in ages</em> </p><p> </p><p>She checked the time. She had a lot of work to do, still, but if she didn’t see a friendly face soon, all her crying at Agatha over not beating people up would be for nothing. </p><p> </p><p>She’d wait for Billy in the cafeteria.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>She scrolled on her phone, sitting at her favorite table: the one Agatha and her usually had coffee breaks at. She always got Agatha to sit on the sunny side, just to see her eyes turn the clearest shade of light blue. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t texted her back the whole morning, she was probably still in the OR. The reconstruction she’d fought so much for had been scheduled right away, that morning, thanks to another patient dropping out of an elective surgery. It should have been over by now… hopefully everything was alright.</p><p> </p><p>Rio set her phone down, the conversation with Agatha open on it.</p><p> </p><p><em>“Look, just own it,” Agatha had said about her legacy issue. “Sure, you haven’t earned this power, but neither have any of the other idiot residents. And if you really need to, in time, you’ll prove it’s in good hands.”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“Is that what you’d do?” Rio had asked. Agatha’s head was resting on her belly; Rio had cupped her jaw and tilted it up to see her face. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha had laughed. “Please, I’d never need to prove anything.” Her fingers had dug into Rio’s hip, “It would be in horrible hands. I’d gladly use all that power…” her smile had grown wider as she’d pushed herself up on one elbow, “...for evil.” And she’d sunk her teeth into Rio’s thigh, below the hem of her shorts.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio looked outside the window. The weather was so nice, out there in the real world. It was starting to get hot, and people walked in and out of the hospital in simple tees, some even in shorts. A kid ran through a patch of grass, tripped; a smaller one kneeled to check on her. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, what are you smiling at?”</p><p> </p><p>Her attention turned to Billy, who was handing her the sandwich she’d texted him for as he slid into the chair in front of her. </p><p> </p><p>“A kid tripped.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy slapped her forearm. His eyes fell to it, then to her phone—Rio promptly snatched it away and locked it, along with the conversation with Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Next, Alice took the chair to Billy’s side. Behind her, a resident sent Rio a judging look; Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“What, are they still gossiping?” Alice turned to check behind her back.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio deadpanned. “Is it even that interesting?”</p><p> </p><p>“Pretty interesting, if you ask me,” Billy tossed around a forkful of veggies. “I can’t believe you never told us…” He frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You</em>.” Rio pointed a menacing finger at him. “This was <em>your</em> fault, wasn’t it? What have you done?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy started turning red. “I didn’t know it was such a big deal! I just thought your mom was visiting, I hadn’t put the pieces together, and…” He turned to Alice, pointing at her. “I only told her!”</p><p> </p><p>Alice’s lips thinned in a regretful expression, shoulders rising. “I told Jen…”</p><p> </p><p>“There you go.” Rio’s eyes were going to roll into her skull if she kept at it. Of course Doctor Kale would tell the whole world, she—</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, isn’t cafeteria food too lowly for you?” A blonde girl snickered at her as she walked past, <em>obviously</em> striding to Derryl’s table.</p><p> </p><p><em>Great</em>, she had a fan club now. If she couldn’t punch them, could she at least throw drinks at their faces?</p><p> </p><p>“She must be buying them a career too, no way they’d be her friends otherwise…” she heard the asshole club leader tell his friends.</p><p> </p><p>Alright, that was it.</p><p> </p><p>Pushing her chair back, she strode to the bar. She grabbed two empty food trays, found the only semi-empty table in the center of the cafeteria, and stalked to it.</p><p> </p><p>Ignoring Billy’s worried look from across the room and Alice’s small smile, she climbed on the table. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, what are you…” the old guy sitting at it with his coffee tried to complain–</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, man, not now.” </p><p> </p><p>She banged the two trays together—</p><p><em>Fuck</em>, they weren’t even making that much noise. Stupid pieces of plastics…</p><p> </p><p>Lucky her, everyone was already watching. Turned out standing on a table was good enough without making a concert, too.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, listen up, bitches,” she banged the trays together again over her head, just for funsies. “Yes, I’m a Walsh. Yes, Carol Walsh and Guillermo Vidal are my parents. If any of you big-mouthed fuckers think that makes my surgical skills less worthy, speak now or forever hold your peace.”</p><p> </p><p>A guy from Derryl’s table—Alex—raised his hand. <em>Huh</em>. Pretty civil for an asshole.</p><p> </p><p>“Not you, you’re an idiot,” Rio shot him down. “Next!”</p><p> </p><p>Billy raised his hand. <em>What the fuck?</em></p><p> </p><p>“You, really?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy cleared his throat. “I just wanted to say that I think you’re a great surgeon, and your parents don’t define you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Great, thank you.” She looked around, trays hanging at her side. “Anyone else? Thoughts?”</p><p> </p><p>From her back, someone snapped their fingers; Rio spun around—</p><p> </p><p>“Me. I think you’re an asshole. Step off that table and clean it, people eat on it.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Ah</em>, there she was. She loved an entrance.</p><p> </p><p>“Right. Sorry, <em>Doctor Harkness</em>.” She spun back around. “Meeting adjourned!” And she banged the trays together one last time. Damn, that was fun. She’d miss it.</p><p> </p><p>When she looked down, the 50% bald guy was staring up at her with his mouth wide open.</p><p>She jumped down the table, dangerously close to Agatha, feeling smug.</p><p> </p><p>“Just took your advice. Aren’t you proud?” She purred at her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked utterly unimpressed. <em>Damn.</em> Without looking at it, she pointed at the table, standing her ground.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a small pout. And then, of course, she strolled to ask the kitchen staff for cleaning supplies.</p><p> </p><p>Some interns and baby residents walked by as she sprayed alcohol on the table, and they slowed down next to it. She stared daggers at them, ready to push them away–</p><p> </p><p>“We think you’re alright, by the way,” one of them blurted out. And then, clustered together like a bunch of baby chicks, they ran away.</p><p> </p><p>Behind them, Agatha came to focus. She was sitting at a table, cheek resting on the palm of her hand. She smiled knowingly when she caught her eye, and motioned with her chin to her own phone on the table.</p><p> </p><p>Rio fished out her phone from her pocket. She had a message from Agatha:</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You’re welcome.</em>”</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh,</em> she’d scolded her in front of everyone on purpose. Rio’s chest warmed from it. <em>Agatha cared for her.</em> In her own way, she did. </p><p> </p><p>A few moments later, she was sliding back into her chair at the table with Billy and Alice, wishing <em>so</em> hard for Agatha to join them. She never would.</p><p> </p><p>“That went well,” Alice said, “If anything, everyone who had been left out of the loop will know about you, now.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m a rip-off-the-band-aid kind of doctor.” Rio shrugged, resuming her eating. She picked up her phone as Billy started on one of his tangents about his patients.</p><p> </p><p>She texted Agatha: “<em>You haven’t told me how the reconstruction went,” </em>and subtly sent glances at her as she nodded at Billy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t turn to her. Rio watched her side profile, face neutral, as she typed on her phone. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s screen lit up–</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness: <em>Come over tonight.</em></p><p> </p><p>Was it her way of saying it went well? </p><p>Rio chuckled at Billy’s joke, then looked back at her screen under the table. And fuck, she was feeling brave. </p><p> </p><p>Rio: <em>For dinner?</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up for a moment, fingers hovering over her screen. </p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck,</em> <em>say yes</em>, Rio thought. <em>Let me in.</em></p><p> </p><p>When Agatha’s thumb finally typed back, it was just two letters.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness: <em>Ok</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin took her whole face.</p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p>***</p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p>It was a slow day for Agatha at work, and she managed to get home pretty early. Rio, on the other hand, had all her boring resident work to do.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally rang the doorbell, Nicky ran to the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama, mama! Rio is here!”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, munchkin.” She opened the door, Nicky jumping at Rio before she could even step inside. </p><p> </p><p>His arms went up and Rio picked him up, laughing a bubbly laugh, and let him hug her before putting him down.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi buddy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, we made lasagna!” He took her hand and dragged her inside, to the kitchen. Agatha rolled her eyes. Still obsessed with her, huh. It wasn’t going away.</p><p> </p><p>“Ooh, you guys made it?” Rio gave a smug grin, finally really looking at Agatha. “I thought you couldn’t cook.”</p><p> </p><p>She huffed. “I can follow a recipe, okay? I just don’t <em>want</em> to.” She looked away as she set the food on the table, “The manny helped,” she admitted. <em>Eh</em>, whatever.</p><p> </p><p>Rio helped Nicky into his seat, the table set. “We’re safe, then!” </p><p> </p><p>“<em>You</em>,” Agatha pointed a knife at her, purposely outside of Nicky’s vision field, “Won’t be safe much longer if you keep at it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just joking,” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s right hand went to take the knife from her, fingers lingering over her wrist before she prided the metal away by the blade–Agatha’s skin tingled at the touch. </p><p> </p><p>“I’d very happily eat anything you offered.” Rio shrugged, looking directly at her for a moment before sitting down. “And I’m not just talking about fo—”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smacked the back of her head. “Not in front of him…”</p><p> </p><p>“What, mama?” Nicky chirped.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s making bad jokes. Now, eat.” And she slid some lasagna into his dish.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky spent the whole dinner telling them about his day, about some drama between his kindergarten friends or whatever, and Rio smiled the entire time. She asked him questions, sounding genuinely interested, and offered her own stories in return. Agatha had to force filters on her—bit too early to tell Nicky the gruesome details, but other than that, she was… well, perfect. A bit too nice, if the stirring in Agatha’s chest was an indication. A bit too cute.</p><p> </p><p>After playing around with him a bit, Rio insisted on cleaning up, so Agatha went to get Nicky ready for bed. It felt weird, having someone to rely on, even if it was just for one night. She wasn’t used to it. She’d always been a one-woman army—taking care of Nicky and herself, <em>alone</em>. Well, with Josh, but that was different.<br/>She’d been alone even before Ralph had left, with him being unable to do anything other than be a second kid to take care of, ever since Nicky had been born…</p><p> </p><p>“Mama, can Rio come listen to bedtime stories?” Nicky ripped her away from her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>She hummed. “If she feels like it. I’ll ask her.” </p><p> </p><p>Leaving Nicky in his room to play with a doll, she went to fetch Rio.</p><p> </p><p>The resident was leaning back against the kitchen counter, phone in her hands, when Agatha found her. She’d cleaned everything up, loaded the dishwasher, probably put stuff in all the wrong places as she usually did when she was over—but right now, Agatha couldn’t care less.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” she called her, pausing at the threshold.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes shot up to her, a smile forming instantly, and she set her phone down. “Hey,” she replied. “Thought I’d give you some space.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, and she hesitated a moment before finally walking in. She stopped close to Rio, and once again, she wanted to thank her for the help, but she <em>really</em> fucking couldn’t bring herself to.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers curled around the hem of Rio’s green tee instead; the resident immediately pulled her closer, cool hands hugging her hips.</p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>, it was soft. Wanda might be right. There was a little <em>something</em> there, at least on Agatha’s part. As Rio held her close, their hips and foreheads meeting, her heart thudded softly in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“We did it, by the way.” Her voice was low; she put a little distance between their faces to get a better view of Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>The resident just hummed a question, eyes shifting over her face. </p><p> </p><p>“Sharon’s surgery, it went great. We made it.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile widened, the gap between her teeth showing. “<em>You</em> made it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? The one time I try to share the merit?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’m sure the team members were all super helpful, but—”</p><p> </p><p>“Idiot, I meant you. You and I. You helped make it happen.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” Rio swallowed. “<em>We</em> did it.”</p><p> </p><p>“We did.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands traveled under her tee, up her naked back, bringing her closer. And she was about to kiss her, Rio fucking was. Agatha wanted nothing more than for Rio to kiss her, in that exact moment. Rio’s lips looked a shade darker in the warm light, so soft, but… </p><p> </p><p>“Nicky asked if you’d like to listen to his bedtime story,” Agatha cut off the moment. “You don’t have to, though.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face took a moment to react, eyebrows shooting up. “Oh. Sure, sure, I…” Agatha pushed both palms against the counter to get away, and Rio’s hands dropped from her waist. “I’d love to.”</p><p> </p><p><em>You would? </em>Agatha wanted to ask. She could not for the life of her fathom why Rio seemed to like hanging around Nicky. Her friends did it, fine, but this… they had a different deal. And it felt like something was shifting. And if it was all in her mind, Agatha would get <em>burnt</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Come, then.” </p><p> </p><p>As usual, she didn’t offer Rio her hand to take her with.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Nicky climbed on his bed. “Mama sit here and Rio here,” he patted to his left and right.</p><p> </p><p>“Your bed is too small, we won’t fit.” Agatha helped him get under the light sheets.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we get a bigger bed?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, once you’re older.” She sat down at his feet. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was standing around, looking at one of Nicky’s books, studying the pictures.</p><p> </p><p>“When?” Nicky asked,</p><p> </p><p>“In a few years.”</p><p> </p><p>“How many years? I’m almost five! Less than five years?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled. “You ask a lot of questions. I’ll just sit on the ground,” and she sat down next to his bed, legs crossed. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky looked at her like she’d just said something curious. “Can I sleep on the ground?”</p><p> </p><p>When Rio laughed, Agatha sent her a threatening look.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said matter of factly. “Now, let’s–”</p><p> </p><p>“Why not?” Nicky pouted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “It’s not as clean and soft as your bed. Come on, let’s read the book you chose,” and she held out a hand for Rio to give it to her, shifting to Nicky’s side.</p><p> </p><p>They got through half of it—which wasn’t much—before Nicky fell asleep. Must have been an exciting day for him, wearing him out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was staring at her when Agatha stopped reading; face strangely serious, she kept looking for a moment before shifting to observing Nicky.</p><p> </p><p>The kid was hugging Agatha’s side. His small hands twitched, then his legs. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled with her eyes. “He looks a lot like you when you’re asleep,” she whispered, and Agatha’s chest tightened softly. </p><p> </p><p>“You do that too,” Rio continued, her glowing eyes still fixed on Nicky’s face as she kneeled up to see him better.</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hypnic jerks.” <em>Oh. </em>The twitching limbs. “You do it every single time you fall asleep.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just stared back. It was too soft, the way Rio was looking at Nicky, and the way she saw her in him, and—</p><p> </p><p>“I’m out,” Agatha whispered. She carefully untangled herself from Nicky and stepped out, as fast but quietly as she could. She had to remove herself from… <em>that</em>. Because it made her feel like it could be something more, something she hadn’t dreamt of in many, many years. Something she’d never even believed she could have. </p><p> </p><p>Something Rio definitely wouldn’t give.</p><p>…Right?</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, are you okay?” Rio walked up to her in the corridor, the door to Nicky’s room closed behind her. Her fingers were light on Agatha’s waist.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to monitor my mood, okay? I’m fine.” She snapped, keeping her voice low. When Rio’s face fell, guilt wrapped around her stomach.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t…” Rio’s eyebrows scrunched, “I’m sorry.” </p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>, classic Agatha. Always taking it out on the wrong person.</p><p> </p><p>“No, no, <em>I’m</em> sorry.” She took a deep breath, cupping Rio’s face to take the frown away. “It’s nothing, I’m okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, looking down at her lips, and Agatha was fucking drowning. </p><p> </p><p>“I need to shower–”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm, okay,” Rio cut her off, a small smile tugging at her lips, “I showered at work, so…”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. I see.” <em>What? </em>Her hands dropped from Rio’s face. She wasn’t jumping at the possibility to…</p><p> </p><p>“I’m joking!” Rio chuckled softly, keeping her voice low. “I mean, I did shower, but—can I come with?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not funny.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s tongue stuck out in a grin, and Agatha couldn’t help but smile. </p><p> </p><p>But if they <em>were</em> showering together, it meant she could now—</p><p> </p><p>Rio suddenly kissed her, and Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</em> It felt too <em>good</em>. Rio’s embrace made her melt, her chest warming with the sweetest sensation—she soon found herself pushed against the closest wall, but it wasn’t just hot. It was gentle, and everything she’d been trying so hard to avoid.</p><p> </p><p>She pushed Rio back, the resident’s chest heaving as she looked at her in a trance. </p><p> </p><p>“Come,” Agatha took her hand.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>She undressed her slowly, as Rio did her. One piece at a time, leaving a trail from her bedroom entrance to the attached bathroom. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smelled like body wash and warmth, and Agatha pulled her head back by the hair to mouth at her neck, careful not to suck a mark in such an exposed area.</p><p> </p><p>Through Rio’s soft hums and hands roaming, they were in the shower, hot water on. She didn’t complain at her hair getting wet; she pulled Agatha in, kissing her under the gentle stream, wet lips gliding with no friction.</p><p> </p><p>She may not be able to stay, she might never be <em>more</em> for Agatha—and for Nicky. But she’d just shown her something Agatha had never thought she’d see. It wasn’t for her, she’d always known as much. But to be shown a snippet of what couldn’t be—even though temporary, it was worth more than she could ever give Rio. </p><p> </p><p>When she kneeled for her, Rio’s darkened, heavy-lidded eyes went wide. </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kneeled, and if her heart hadn’t kept her standing by hammering against her chest, Rio would have fainted.</p><p> </p><p>She looked up, Agatha, striking blue eyes and pointed nose, her lips red from all the kissing. <em>So</em> beautiful, as she’d painfully been all night as she’d shown Rio a part of her, the idea of eventually losing her hurt that much more. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumb drew the length of Agatha’s cheek, and then she cupped it. She needed to hold on to her.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure?” Her voice cracked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. But her eyes, lashes wet with water droplets, didn’t waver.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p><em>Thank you</em>, Agatha thought. </p><p>And then, <em>finally</em>, her lips drank in Rio’s sweetness.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p>It was Sunday morning, and Rio had stayed over the previous night, after a couple drinks with Lilia, Alice and Jen. She’d pretended to go flirt with a random woman at the bar—Agatha had known it was just so she could use her as a fake explanation as to why she wasn’t driving home with Alice, but she’d still hated it.</p><p> </p><p>“I was thinking about you the whole time I talked to her,” Rio had said as soon as she’d pushed her onto the bed, but Agatha had bitten her all the same. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was playing with Nicky in the living room the next morning, another rule broken. Those were starting to pile up.</p><p> </p><p>As Agatha sat on the couch, a coffee mug in one hand and a book in the other, Nicky showed Rio all his plastic dinosaurs, one by one. They made up stories with them, and—embarassing as hell—Agatha didn’t manage to read a single page.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled so brightly, cross-legged on the floor as Nicky stumbled around with his toys, Agatha couldn’t stop watching. When the resident caught her eye, she went right back to her book—totally stealth. Rio wouldn’t suspect a thing.</p><p> </p><p>Of course Rio would be that cute with Nicky but not want kids. Of–fucking–course. Agatha had never asked her to elaborate on that; totally cringe, it wasn’t her place to question people’s life choices. Nothing to do with the fear of getting definitive confirmation that there was no chance, ever, for Rio to want to be a parent. Definitely not that. </p><p> </p><p>But what if… what if basing the conviction on <em>one</em> simple sentence from Rio had been too rushed?</p><p> </p><p>What if Rio stayed, after her residency ended? What if she felt the same warmth in her cheeks Agatha did when they kissed—</p><p>And what if she could, eventually, want Nicky too?</p><p> </p><p>Too many “what ifs”.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s plesiosaurus swam over Nicky’s arm to go munch on his face, and he giggled so loud Agatha completely melted.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe she should ask Rio to elaborate. Maybe…</p><p> </p><p><em>Ding-dong!</em></p><p> </p><p>Her head snapped up to the door. Weird. She wasn’t expecting anyone. </p><p> </p><p>“Mama, someone else came over!” Nicky raised a dino over his head in exaltation. </p><p> </p><p>Looking more alert, Rio moved to get up, but as she went to the door, Agatha gestured at her to stay. Seeing as they were ringing directly at the front door, it was probably just one of her annoying neighbors. </p><p> </p><p>She swung the door right open—</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh, fuck.</em></p><p><em><br/></em><br/>“I’m back for my son.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The situation escalated pretty quickly.</p><p> </p><p>When his father called for him, Nicky looked at Agatha for approval. She nodded with a comforting smile, and Nicky went to hug Ralph.</p><p> </p><p>He ran right back to Rio, to curl in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>Before things got heated, Agatha asked Rio to take Nicky to his room; she only turned to Ralph once Nicky was out of earshot.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want? You’ve been away for—“</p><p> </p><p>“I <em>know</em>, Agatha. It’s not like I chose to. But I’ve been out of the psych ward for months, I’m better. And I want shared custody.”</p><p> </p><p>Like hell she’d let Ralph take care of Nicky. Ralph couldn’t take care of an invasive plant, let alone a human being.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said matter-of-factly.</p><p> </p><p>Ralph huffed, a hand trailing through his hair. “No? He’s my son. You don’t trust <em>me</em>, but you trust that…” he gesticulated towards the corridor to the bedrooms, “what is she, your girlfriend? You’ve finally accepted you’re a dyke?” He spat out, keeping a low volume.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slapped his pointing finger down. “She’s not my girlfriend, she’s—no one.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, sure, if we go by your history, a no one you like to fuck!”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t talk about her that way,” Agatha scream-whispered. “And leave her out of this. Whoever I fuck is irrelevant, I’m still a fit parent. <em>You</em>, on the other hand, have never—”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t get to decide this, he’s <em>my</em> son too,“ he pushed past her, to Nicky’s room.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing?!” Agatha was right after him, “You’ll give him false hopes, break his heart all over again!” </p><p> </p><p>Ralph huffed, waving a hand back at her. “I’m going to spend some time with my son, right<em> now.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up at them from where she was sitting with Nicky; she booped his forehead and said goodbye, Nicky pouting up at her as she let Ralph take her spot.  </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, little man,” Ralph had the decency to use a soothing tone, “I’ve missed you.”</p><p> </p><p>And Nicky looked so confused, Agatha wanted to stab Ralph. <em>Great</em>, weeks of therapy rendered useless. </p><p> </p><p>She gave one look at Rio, and the resident followed her back into the living room.</p><p> </p><p>“You better go.” Agatha crossed her arms defensively; Rio shouldn’t have been there to see all that. </p><p> </p><p>The resident hesitated. She looked back to the corridor, then pulled Agatha into a more private corner of the living room.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you okay?” She whispered.</p><p> </p><p>For a flicker of a moment, Agatha wished she could talk to her. What came out of her mouth instead, was—“Fuck, not this again. I’m fine, just go, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“I, uh–I just want to be here for you.” Rio’s touch on her arm, usually soothing, was making her nervous. She didn’t need anyone to comfort her.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t <em>need</em> you to be here, I said I’m fine.” </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” the way Rio looked at her, with fucking <em>pity</em>, was the worst. “I don’t know what’s happening, but—” she hesitated, “don’t keep Nicky away from his father. He needs–”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t tell me what my son needs.” He needed–what, his father? Certainly not. Agatha was enough; she’d <em>had</em> to be enough. “You think it was my plan to raise a child alone? You think I chose to? Fuck, god knows it was a terrible idea to have a son with a man I never should have married in the first place, but here we are. Nicky is the best thing I’ve ever made, however it happened, and no one, certainly not <em>you</em>, gets to tell me how to care for him. You’ve no idea what happened with Ralph—”</p><p> </p><p>“I know.” Rio was looking regretful. “I know I don’t understand, because you’ve refused time and again to open up to me. I wasn’t trying to tell you how to be a parent, just—” She drew a hand through her own hair, “Agatha, just talk to me. <em>Please.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>“No. You think I’m this <em>nice</em> person to try and help, but I’m not.” If Rio knew everything she’d done, she wouldn't even be there. “I don’t need your pity.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not pity, Agatha, fuck, can you just let me care about you?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Care</em>? You don’t <em>know</em> me. Stop pushing, you’ve managed to slither your way into my life, but it’s enough. Stay out of my business.” She took a step back-</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands fisted at her sides. “Why won’t you trust me? I’ve told you everything. You know my worst secret, I-“</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a sardonic laugh. “Hah, <em>please</em>, your worst secret is you fighting a little too hard to protect someone. That’s anti-hero behavior at best. I’m a villain, baby, and you know what villains don’t have?” Rio didn’t ask. She just stared daggers at her. “Nice little girlfriends giving them nice little pieces of advice,” Agatha concluded.</p><p> </p><p>Rio flinched. She looked down; when her eyes got back to Agatha’s, they were dark, her jaw clenched.</p><p> </p><p>“Great. You don’t have to worry about that, I never wanted to be your <em>nice little girlfriend</em>.” She spat it out like venom. “You make it sound awful.”</p><p> </p><p>She strode to her backpack, pulled it on her shoulder and, under Agatha’s pointed stare, she left.</p><p> </p><p>Still, as the door was about to slam closed, she had the thoughtfulness to stop it with a foot and slowly pull it the rest of the way. Probably still thinking of Nicky.</p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck</em>. Agatha was an idiot, but fuck Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
